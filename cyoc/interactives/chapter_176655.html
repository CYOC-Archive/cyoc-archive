<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Charlotte sleepily walked down the stairs towards the kitchen. She hadn&#39;t done a whole lot of anything besides sleeping and masturbating since yesterday afternoon. She hadnt expected it to feel nearly as good as it did, and managed to completely forget about eating. But now that she was both hungry and half asleep, she didn&#39;t remember to get dressed. So when her naked self entered the kitchen, she was awoken completely while also brought down to her knees from the shock as her Mother gave her a stern look. It was just a quick shock this time, and Charlotte quickly ran back upstairs to quickly put on her clothes. <br />
<br />
Now heqding back downstairs in a pink sports bra that was essentially useless as she didn&#39;t have breasts, at least not yet. She also had picked to wear a pair of leggings. Her Mother gave her another disapproving look, but didn&#39;t comment nor shock her this time.  Yet despite that, Charlotte felt that she had to clarify her clothing decision. &quot;I haven&#39;t showered since yesterday, and I had gotten pretty sweaty last night, so I didn&#39;t want to make more dirty laundry than what was necessary. And while I am speaking of it, where is the shower exactly? I do not know the full layout of the house quite yet.&quot; <br />
<br />
Hildia just starred at her daughter in disbelief for a few seconds until she suddenly started to laugh. After a few seconds of that, she calmed down once she saw that she was the only one laughing and that Charlotte simply looked confused. &quot;Oh my god you actually aren&#39;t kidding are you. I thought you would have figured it out since I did show you the bathroom. There is no shower. We are witches, we just clean ourselves with magic. It is not only faster, but it us cheaper too than paying for a water bill that accounts for 2 women who shower at least once, daily. It is the same with the laundry, magic is used instead of those machines.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. But I can&#39;t use magic, at least not yet. So... are you going to do it for me until I can?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck no. There is a wash bin out back. Do your laundry there. I will only be cleaning you. And, I want your first goal to be doing your own laundry with magic. In other words, using what is known as &quot;chore magic&quot;, &quot;housekeeping magic&quot;, or &quot;everyday magic&quot;. All 3 terms mean the same kind of magic. And that is all magic that one would use every day that is also not too taxing. In other words, the basics. Usually it takes kids maybe 1 to 2 years to be able to preform their first successful spell. But with you, since I am directly sharing my knowledge, I reckon that it will take you a week, maybe 2 tops. Of course that depends on how eager you practice, and how well I can boost your intelligence durring that time frame. Did you know that you already have gone from an IQ of about 73 to somewhere around 81? You no longer are considered to be possibly mentally disabled! And at the rate of improvement, I can say with confidence that you likely will end up as being very intelligent once we are done with it. Definitely a triple digit IQ for sure. My girl is going to be a genius.&quot; <br />
<br />
Charlotte wasn&#39;t quite sure how to take that. It was a somewhat backhanded compliment at best, so she just nodded and smiled as she sat down at the table. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, today I am not giving you any time off. It is a full cram day for you. Don&#39;t worry though, I will make sure you are able to keep up with the learning as there is a lot to take in, in so little time. Be prepared to feel like shit though. But since tomorrow we both have school to attend, it all has to be done today. Sorry. Oh, and may as well tell you now, but you are officially kicked off of the swim team for the rest of the year and on until you earn a semester average of a 3.75/4.0. But as you now are officially registered as my daughter, your tuition is still paid in full. That is, as long as I wish it to be though. So you know, behave in school or else. Understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlotte was fairly saddened by the fact that she was off the team, however this wasn&#39;t that much of a surprise. She had actually planned to quit as her current body was impossible to swim competitively in anyways. However hearing it was now a fact was still a bit depressing. &quot;Can I ask a question?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You may.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When you said that I am now registered as your daughter...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean exactly that. You are my daughter on all official records. However, you will still attend as your old self as you simply had far too many connections to flawlessly recreate your identity with. But don&#39;t get too excited. It will mearly be an illusion that others see and hear. You will still be a girl physically though. So as long as no one touches you inappropriately and finds out that you are... lacking, where it counts for men, the illusion will stop working on them and they will see you as you truely are now, so be careful. Anything else?&quot; <br />
<br />
Charlotte shook her head no, having no more questions, and took a bite of the breakfast that Hildia had set down in front of her. After a bit of silent eating, Charlotte had thought of another question although it wasn&#39;t necessarily related to the conversation before. &quot;Hey Mama, do I have a new Dad now too, or is it just us?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hildia, who hadn&#39;t been expecting that question choked a bit on the food she was eating before responding. After a bit of coughing and clearing her throat, she answered the question. &quot;Uh, well you see dear. Us witches, well, we live for a very, very, very long time. Often well over a millenia. And there is no male equivalent to us. So... uh... you&#39;re getting the picture right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, there isn&#39;t anything like a wizard or something?&quot; <br />
<br />
Hildia let out a long sigh. &quot;Often times I wish that were the case, sweetheart. But if there was how it was, then I wouldn&#39;t have gained a daughter, but a son instead. Now, aside from that, what made you think of this question in the first place anyways? Surely my daughter hasn&#39;t become drunk with lust after only her first night as a girl and wishes to find a husband?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No. NO! Definitely no. Mama, I have absolutely no interest in men, in that way at least, I swear!&quot; Reassured Charlotte in a panic. &#39;I don&#39;t have any interest in dating a man, at least I think I don&#39;t... at least not yet... right? Well, I am still into girls, so maybe I can find another witch to be my wife. Either way, I do not want to end up being single forever like Mama...&#39; she thought in her head. Hildia, having full awarness of her daughter&#39;s thoughts, heard that, but didn&#39;t acknowledge it as she felt that it was something that her daughter would either have or not, reguardless of even her influence in the matter. Her initial question was merely out of playful curiosity anyways. It was meant to just lighten the mood a bit. So since she didn&#39;t want to have made 2 ruined breakfasts in a row at least, she let whatever her daughter was thinking slide, just this once, with a light warning. Instead of using the chain, she flicked her finger underneath the table and lightly shocked her daughter with a much lighter charge than normal. <br />
<br />
Charlotte suddenly twitched and contorted in her chair for a few moments before letting out a seductive moan. The moment she did so the static that had just happened to have hit her clitoris stopped, and her Mother was just starring at her with her mouth open in disbelief.  Charlotte quickly covered her own mouth as well. She had moaned unintentionally. It was out of her control. Her body simply reacted to the static. Unlike when the chain shocked her, this one didn&#39;t hurt anywhere near as much, and instead felt really good too as it had hit her most sensitive place, making it all tingly feeling. And then when she moved, it brushed against her panties and at that moment, it had just happened. Now she was in full blown panic mode in a desperate hope to not get punished for being unladylike at the table. However her Mama just laughed and began to clean up both of their empty plates, while quietly apologizing to Charlotte in her head.</p>
