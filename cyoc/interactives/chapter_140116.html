<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Demi looked at the screen and was elated that she was pregnant.<br />
<br />
It was at that point she saw the link to Bryan&#39;s profile. She stared in horror as she saw that he too was pregnant.<br />
<br />
Tapping away at the screen and up popped a warning: PREGNANCY CHANGES CAN NOT BE ALTERED. PREGNANCY MUST GO TO TERM.<br />
<br />
She almost started to cry. <br />
<br />
She was going to have to tell him so she called him up and told him she had to talk to him immediately.<br />
<br />
When he got over she explained the whole dilemma.<br />
<br />
As she spoke he looked down at his abdomen. He had worked so hard on his washboard abs. That was all going to be history now. He was excited that Demi was pregnant and he had resigned himself to the fact that he would eventually develop a dad bod but he also didn&#39;t think that they were ready to be pregnant.<br />
<br />
As Demi finished her story he looked up and said they better get married.<br />
<br />
They were on a flight to Vegas and got married. He moved in and even though their pregnancies were unalterable she was able to change their surroundings. She gave them a nice house a good job and a doctor that would keep his mouth shut.<br />
<br />
As the weeks and months went by they both were getting incredibly large. That was when they asked the Dr. why.<br />
<br />
The first moment they were able to do an ultra sound on the two of them he discovered that they weren&#39;t just pregnant they both had multiples. Demi had 6 fetus&#39; growing inside her but the bigger concern was that Bryan had 8 growing inside him. <br />
<br />
The Dr. said you both are going to get massive. And Bryan because you aren&#39;t built for babies this is going to be harder on you. You are going to look like you have the biggest beer belly ever. And will probably have to be in bed rest for the last month or two and that inactivity will really put the weight on you.<br />
<br />
As for you Demi you may also need to be in bed rest but it might be possible for you to keep active and reduce some of the weight gain.<br />
<br />
As they got bigger and bigger eventually labor came and even though it wasn&#39;t easy for Demi the 6 popped out of her quite a bit easier than they did for Bryan.<br />
<br />
They had never done a Cesarean on a man before and were worried that it might not be a viable option so they put him up in sturrips and started watching as his ass began to dilate.<br />
<br />
Bryan passed out as the first passed through his ass. A second came as he was groggily waking from the first. Eventually they all came and Bryan was exhausted.<br />
<br />
Even though he was considerably he had put on quite a bit of weight and when he was finally able to stand his belly stuck out and down between his legs. He looked like he had yoyo dieted for years. His skin just hung on him.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t feel very hansom at that time and even though he loved his and Demi&#39;s babies he just felt down on himself.<br />
<br />
That was when Demi arranged for a romantic night and they found themselves in bed again.<br />
<br />
It was a few weeks later that Bryan found out he was pregnant again. And he was going to have to go through this alone this time. Demi wasn&#39;t pregnant this time.<br />
<br />
Bryan&#39;s hormones were going crazy and he asked her why she hadn&#39;t changed the profile once he was not pregnant.<br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t think it would last I figured that once you had yours you would go back to normal.<br />
<br />
Another 7 were growing inside Bryan and once they came Bryan demanded that Demi make sure he could never get pregnant again. And she did. But she was not able to do anything about the baby weight he had gained. He would have to try to work it off but he found he began to enjoy the weight. It was a habit.  And he looked so nice in his 6xl tailored suits. He really looked like a big business man. And he no longer minded.<br />
<br />
Demi remained voluptuous but no where near as big as Bryan. Their 21 kids grew and it wasn&#39;t until the first boy got pregnant that they realized that they hadn&#39;t checked on if their children could become pregnant.</p>
