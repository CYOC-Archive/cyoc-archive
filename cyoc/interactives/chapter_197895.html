<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Meanwhile, back at Jamie&#39;s house, there was a knock on the door.  Terry, who had been busy cleaning, paused and walked to the front door.  A lot of time had passed, but there were still chores to be done.  She had to be a good wife, after all!<br />
<br />
In the back of her mind, she knew that she was anything but a good wife, and that she didn&#39;t even want to be one, but, try as she might, she had to obey Jamie&#39;s instructions.<br />
<br />
As she opened the door, she saw what at first she assumed to be a very handsome man wearing a black business suit and tie, with a trilby hat.  But she realized the man had breasts- and in fact, was a very tall  young woman with short blonde hair and green eyes, dressed like a man.<br />
<br />
“Good evening, Miss.  Can I assume you are the lady of the house?”  The girl smiled.<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s right.  How can I help you?”<br />
<br />
The girl removed her hat, holding it over her breast.  “If I could just have a moment of your time, I&#39;d like to make you a very special offer.”<br />
<br />
Charmed by the woman, Terry let her in, and offered to get her a drink.<br />
<br />
“That would be wonderful, Miss.  It&#39;s pretty hot out today, and I&#39;m parched.” <br />
<br />
Terry came back with two bottles of Coke, and the saleswoman drank half of hers in one gulp.  “Ah, that hits the spot.  Now then, a lovely young woman like yourself no doubt worries about keeping her good looks.  I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve tried it all, cryo baths, special diets, exercise?  But nothing seems to keep the hands of the clock in place!<br />
<br />
Well, I represent a company, GemCo, that has been working on something completely revolutionary.  I know, I probably sound like a snake oil salesman, but I can demonstrate the product at no risk to yourself.  What do you say?”<br />
<br />
Terry blinked.  “And this is safe?”<br />
<br />
“Absolutely and completely, or my name isn&#39;t Meridiana.”<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s...a very unique name.”<br />
<br />
“Indeed it is.  Now watch!”  She set her briefcase down on the coffee table and opened it.  Inside were what looked to be several bottles of lotion.  Taking one, she offered it to Terry.  “Just rub a little of this on your hand, and you&#39;ll see what I mean!”<br />
<br />
Terry did as the saleswoman suggested, and felt a tingling sensation in the skin on the back of her hand.  Within moments, the skin looked healthier, and she touched it, to find it was soft and smooth!  “Oh...oh my.  How can this be real?  Everyone would want this!”<br />
<br />
“Well to be honest, that&#39;s the problem.  How can you sell a product that people would kill for?  On the open market?  I think not!  By the time the FDA concluded their testing, there&#39;d be cheap knockoffs everywhere!  That&#39;s why GemCo has decided to sell it as a &#39;dietary supplement&#39;, under the table, so to speak.  I know what you&#39;re saying to yourself- this sounds illegal!  And to be honest, Miss, it is.  But think about what we&#39;re really selling!  How can that be a crime?”<br />
<br />
Terry wasn&#39;t sure what to think.  All she knew was, she wanted to rub this lotion all over her body!  “How much?”<br />
<br />
Meridiana smiled.  “We have three plans at the moment.  One plan gets you a bottle of our product each month for a year, for 24,000 dollars.  The second plan gets you a bottle a week, but obviously, that&#39;s more expensive at 52,000 dollars.”<br />
<br />
Terry balked.  Where would she get that much money?  “And the third option?”<br />
<br />
Merdiana produced a small bottle.  “An experimental one-time dose.  Highly concentrated.  Not to be used by anyone under 20...are you sure you&#39;re old enough?”  She grinned, and Terry blushed.<br />
<br />
She normally wasn&#39;t into women, but something about Meridiana was very attractive!  “And the price?”<br />
<br />
“Well, since it&#39;s still a new product, this is actually my sample.  But you were kind enough to let me in on a hot day and give me a drink, plus, you are a lovely woman, so...12,000 dollars?”<br />
<br />
It would be hard, but Terry could do that.  “I&#39;ll take it!”<br />
<br />
“I just need you to sign some papers.  Standard contract, includes an NDA so you don&#39;t go running to our competitors.”  Meridiana produced some paperwork.<br />
<br />
Terry, naturally, barely glanced at it, and signed.  The saleswoman breathed a sigh of relief.  Part of her charm included a form of subtle hypnotism, and at first, Terry had resisted it- as if she either had very strong willpower, or someone else had used a similar power on her.  But her desire and greed had overcome whatever it was, and now Meridiana had the woman in the palm of her hand.<br />
<br />
Meridiana handed out the bottle, but Terry held onto the saleswoman&#39;s hand for a moment.  “Are you in a hurry to go?”<br />
<br />
Meridiana smiled.  A bonus for her hard work?  “No, not at all.”<br />
<br />
<br />
The demon saleswoman had been on Earth a very long time, and she&#39;d had many lovers, male and female.  Despite her advancing age, Terry was a remarkably pretty woman, and Meridiana was happy to show her techniques of lovemaking gained over her long life.<br />
<br />
As she lay there, stroking Terry&#39;s hair afterwards, Meridiana almost felt bad for the woman.  But the orders had come down from on high.  Terry had offended somebody high up, and for that, she was going to get a classic Luciferian contract.<br />
<br />
The kind that cruelly gives the other party more than they bargained for.<br />
<br />
Meridiana thanked Terry for the sex, but she had to be going.  There was a touch of longing in Terry&#39;s eyes, and Meridiana wished things could be different.  As she picked up her briefcase, she noted it was lighter than it should be- Terry had swiped another bottle or two!<br />
<br />
&#39;What a sly minx.  Too bad it won&#39;t do her any good.&#39;  The magic was in the contract, the lotion was just really good moisturizer.  That, and a touch of illusion and suggestion, had done all the work.  Now the fun began.<br />
<br />
Meridiana whistled as she walked down the street, eager to find her next sale.  And maybe, another bed to fall into...<br />
<br />
<br />
Terry took a shower after Meridiana was gone.  The woman had been an incredible lover, and Terry was sorry to see her go.  But if the product did what it claimed, then Terry would soon be able to have her pick of lovers.  And perhaps she&#39;d find another pretty girl!  Why not?<br />
<br />
Getting out of the shower, she rubbed the lotion all over her body.  Then, greedily, opened one of the bottles she&#39;d taken.  To her surprise, it had pills inside, but the bottle&#39;s label claimed they would make you feel &#39;years younger&#39;.  So she took a few of those as well.  &#39;Must be a related product&#39;, she thought.<br />
<br />
Almost immediately, her skin softened, regaining it&#39;s healthy glow.  Her crow&#39;s feet around her eyes faded, and her hair seemed to regain some of it&#39;s lost luster.  She felt amazing!<br />
<br />
She did her makeup and got dressed.  Time for a night out on the town!<br />
<br />
<br />
Jamie called Gemory&#39;s name, and the business card flashed.  However, rather than the demoness appearing to them, the three girls found themselves in a lavish office on the top floor of a skyscraper.  Gemory, looking to be about 16 or so.  She was still a small woman, at about 4&#39; 8”, but was dressed to the nines- a black Dolce & Gabbana heavy lace cocktail dress, and a pair of red Giuseppe Zanotti satin wing, jeweled, high-heeled sandals.<br />
<br />
Kelly couldn&#39;t help but whistle in appreciation of the girl&#39;s wardrobe.  <br />
<br />
Gemory was on the phone, but she looked up and gestured for the three to sit down.  Instead of chairs, her office had a couple of loveseats, and all three girls piled onto one.  Jamie sat in Kelly&#39;s lap, while Rachel sat to Kelly&#39;s right, leaning her head on the other girl&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
“So you sent Meridiana?  She&#39;s a good choice.  And the contract is signed?  What an idiot.  Thank you so much!  Make sure to give Meridiana a bonus.  Some cute piece of fluff, you know what a horndog she is.  Yes, I have to go, I have another meeting.  Thanks again!”  Gemory hung up.<br />
<br />
“Jamie!  I see you didn&#39;t waste any time.  And these girls must be Kelly and Rachel.  Such pretty things.  What brings you by?  Did Rachel want revenge on her father?  I have his file right here.”  <br />
<br />
Gemory picked up a thick envelope on her desk.<br />
<br />
“She knows about that?”  Rachel was shocked.<br />
<br />
“She does.  That&#39;s how I was able to convince her to help.”  Jamie explained.<br />
<br />
“Well that, and Jamie is very persuasive.  I am Gemory, by the way.  Duke of Hell, and CEO of GemCo.  This is my main office on Earth.”<br />
<br />
“Are you really a demon?”  Rachel frowned.  “You seem too pretty to be a demon.”<br />
<br />
Gemory laughed.  “Why thank you, but you know, Jamie is a demon as well.”<br />
<br />
“I...sorry, I must sound like an idiot.”  Rachel looked down.<br />
<br />
“No no, not at all!  I love compliments.”  Gemory got up and walked over to the girls, her chair following along under it&#39;s own power.  She sat it in it, and it was obvious it was intended for a taller girl.  <br />
<br />
“Well.  I&#39;m not here about my...father.  I hope he rots in Hell, but I don&#39;t care about what happens to him.”  Rachel said.<br />
<br />
“A pity, I&#39;d love to send him there faster.  More specifically, I&#39;d love to claim his soul so I can deliver his torment personally.”  Gemory cracked her knuckles.  “But let&#39;s hear what you do want.”<br />
<br />
“I want to be able to live with Kelly and Jamie forever.  A home of our own, that nobody can take away from us.”  Rachel said.<br />
<br />
Gemory&#39;s expression softened.  “That&#39;s a lovely wish.  So just get away from your families, start a new life someplace?  Hm...what about school?”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;d like to keep going, but not our old school.  The best things about it are right here in this room.”  Rachel said.<br />
<br />
“Though I guess the kids are our lunch table will be sad I&#39;m gone.”  Kelly said.  “They&#39;ll probably go back to being bullied.”  She frowned at that.<br />
<br />
“Yes, I was looking into your school.  One of the girls there made a pact with a rival of mine.  Shelly Clarke, do you know her?”<br />
<br />
“Shelly!  Oh no, what did she want?”  Kelly was shocked at this news.<br />
<br />
“Oh you know, to be the prettiest, most popular girl in school, probably some low-key revenge against her rival.”  Gemory shrugged.<br />
<br />
“Um, Mistress...Kelly is her rival.”<br />
<br />
“Oh!  Well, that&#39;s different.  Probably a good idea to get her out of the line of fire, then.”  Gemory frowned.  “Normally demons don&#39;t directly interfere with each other, but I&#39;ll talk to my business rival and see what their intentions are.  We may be able to come to some agreement that will save your classmates some grief.”<br />
<br />
“I guess that&#39;s the best we can hope for.”  Kelly sighed.<br />
<br />
“So.  What do you girls like?  Fun in the sun?  Someplace warm?  Maybe beachside property?  I can hook you up with this nice place in Oregon.  Everything paid for, a couple acres of land, split-level, three story, right on the beach, garden, cherry trees, and an indoor pool for colder weather.  Complete privacy, high security, environmentally friendly smart home.  Yours in perpetuity, where you can live safely and happily for as long as you shall live.”  Gemory gave her sales pitch.<br />
<br />
“It sounds lovely.”  Rachel smiled.<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t know.  All she gets for her soul is a house?”  Kelly frowned.<br />
<br />
“Kelly, be nice!  Milady Gemory is giving you a good deal!”  Jamie protested.<br />
<br />
Kelly looked at her ring and bowed her head.<br />
<br />
“Ah, don&#39;t be so quick to scold her, my dear Jamie.  She has a point.  Well, this also comes with new identities for you, a great private school and a good college nearby.  I&#39;d offer eternal youth, but the Slave Rings already allow for that.”<br />
<br />
Rachel looked at her ring.  “Really?”<br />
<br />
“Kelly, be a dear and demonstrate, will you?”<br />
<br />
Kelly smiled.  “Sure, I wanted to see if this works!  Rachel, I wish you were nine years old!”<br />
<br />
Rachel made an “eep” noise as her body began to dwindle in size, literally shrinking inside her clothing.  She stared at her hands, barely able to protrude from the sleeves of her sweatshirt.  “Oh...wow...I&#39;m a kid?”  She gasped, hearing her own youthened voice.<br />
<br />
“Oh man, you&#39;re adorable!”  Kelly reached over to ruffle the smaller girl&#39;s hair.  Rachel smiled and made happy noises at the attention.<br />
<br />
Jamie felt a tiny stab of jealousy, but repressed it.  She realized, however, that Gemory was staring at her intently.  She then heard the demon&#39;s voice in her head!<br />
<br />
&#39;What&#39;s wrong, Jamie?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I...uh...nothing...&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;You can&#39;t lie to me, Jamie.  I own you, remember?  Now spit it out.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I...I&#39;m...it just makes me jealous how much Kelly likes Rachel.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Ahh.  Because she&#39;s yours.&#39;<br />
<br />
Jamie started to nod, but stopped.  &#39;Yes.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;You chose to share your pet with another.  It&#39;s a hard decision to make.  But let me give you some advice, Jamie.  Don&#39;t see her as a rival.  See her as someone who cares about Kelly as much as you do.  And maybe, you&#39;ll find that you can love her as well.&#39;<br />
<br />
Jamie brightened.  &#39;Thank you, Gemory.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;You&#39;re welcome, kiddo.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Actually, about Rachel.  I think she&#39;d be a great candidate for Minuet.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Yes, I was noticing that myself.  Though the ring complicates things.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;But you are going to bargain for her soul anyways?&#39;<br />
<br />
The demoness shrugged.  &#39;I&#39;m gambling on your instincts.  We&#39;ll see how this one turns out.&#39;<br />
<br />
<br />
There was a little more discussion, but eventually, Rachel signed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Jamie returned home.  She would need to get a message to her Dad, and pack a few things she wanted to bring with her.  When she came in, however, she got a sense that something was wrong.<br />
<br />
“Jamie...?  Please...help me...”  She heard a soft voice coming from the master bedroom.<br />
<br />
Investigating, she saw a little girl on the bed, crying.  The only thing she was wearing was a shirt she recognized as belonging to Terry.<br />
<br />
The girl looked up at Jamie, tears in her eyes.  “Something&#39;s wrong, this wasn&#39;t supposed to happen...I don&#39;t want to disappear!”<br />
<br />
“Oh fuck...Terry?!”  Jamie was shocked.<br />
<br />
Terry broke down crying and explained what had happened.  How she&#39;d taken too much of the product she&#39;d bought, and went out.  She&#39;d hooked up with a girl, but then things got weird.  The bartender asked to card her, and the girl asked how old she really was.<br />
<br />
(Jamie was surprised to hear that Terry had been trying to hook up with a girl, but filed that away for later.)<br />
<br />
Then when she went to the bathroom, she saw a much younger face, a girl of maybe college age!  She&#39;d shivered, and shrank an inch or two and realized what was happening.  She made it out of the club, and got into her car, but by the time she got home, she could barely see over her dashboard!<br />
<br />
She read the labels on the drugs, even called the support numbers, but nothing.  So now she was afraid she was going to keep shrinking until she became a baby...or....worse!<br />
<br />
Jamie&#39;s demonic senses allowed her to see that infernal magic was behind this.  She sat down on the bed and pulled the crying girl into her lap.  She hated Terry, but she&#39;d been put through the ringer.<br />
<br />
“Listen Terry.  It&#39;s going to be hard to believe, but those chemicals don&#39;t do anything.  You signed some papers, right?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah-huh.”  Terry even spoke like a younger girl.  She had to be about seven.<br />
<br />
“You have copies?”<br />
<br />
“On the desk drawer.”  <br />
<br />
Jamie got up, holding Terry in her arms.  She walked to the desk and sat down at it, putting Terry in her lap.  “Ok, here we go, see this fine print?  Upon receipt of the services offered by the vendor, the recipient, henceforth known as the party of the second, shall remit their soul as payment, in addition to the above terms.”<br />
<br />
“My..soul?” Terry looked confused.<br />
<br />
“That salesman was a devil, Terry.  You sold your soul to be young again.  And you got what you wanted.”<br />
<br />
“No...not like this...this is too young!”  The girl wailed.<br />
<br />
“The good news is, you won&#39;t get any younger.”<br />
<br />
“Even so...how will I live?  Oh God, your Father...he&#39;ll divorce me...how can he be married to a child!”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;d like to say that&#39;s the least of your worries.  You really brought this on yourself, you know?”<br />
<br />
“But devils aren&#39;t real!”  <br />
<br />
“Oh, but they are.”  Jamie revealed her true appearance.  “You see, I&#39;m one of them.”<br />
<br />
Terry screamed and tried to get away, but Jamie&#39;s touch alone was sufficient to calm her as she kissed the shrunken woman on her head.  “None of that now.  If I wanted to hurt you, we wouldn&#39;t be having this conversation.”<br />
<br />
“Please, change me back!”<br />
<br />
“I can&#39;t.  You made the deal, your soul belongs to a more powerful demon.  When you die, you will go to Hell.  But you won&#39;t die of old age, at least.”<br />
<br />
“I want to kill myself.”  The girl said, sobbing.<br />
<br />
“You don&#39;t mean that.  You&#39;ll just get to Hell faster.  There&#39;s only one thing you can do, Terry.  Try to live your life as best you can.  Maybe you can stop being a hateful brat, and learn how to be happy again.”<br />
<br />
Terry burst into tears, throwing a tantrum.  “I hate you!  I hate you!”<br />
<br />
Jamie leaned in and nipped the girl on the neck, injecting her venom.  It started acting quickly, and the girl calmed down.  She was quiet for a long time.<br />
<br />
“Jamie.  Will you help me?”<br />
<br />
“I really shouldn&#39;t.  You treated me like shit.  You cheated on Dad.  Used his money to buy yourself nice things.  You deserve this, you really do.  But...yes, I&#39;ll help you.  However, first I&#39;m going to do something I&#39;ve wanted to do for a long time.”<br />
<br />
She then put the girl over her knee and spanked her.  Terry yowled in pain, but rather than curse and swear, she took her licks.  She was sniffling when it was over, and Jamie just hugged her.  She had no reservations on feeding on Terry&#39;s emotions.  They were wild and all over the place, and she was going to need the former woman to be subdued.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m going to write Dad a note.  I&#39;m going to tell him I caught you cheating, and couldn&#39;t bear to be in the house anymore.  So I&#39;m staying with friends.  He&#39;ll assume you left in shame.  We&#39;ll leave the wedding ring behind.  He&#39;ll be upset, but this is the best way.<br />
<br />
Then you and I are going to Oregon, where I&#39;m going to enroll you in school.”<br />
<br />
“School!  But I&#39;m a big gir...an adult!”  Terry protested.<br />
<br />
“Too bad.  You&#39;re going to school, and you&#39;re going to be a good girl, or else you&#39;ll get more than a spanking.  I might ask a demon I know to turn you into a little baby and put you up for adoption!”<br />
<br />
Terry&#39;s eyes got big.  “Please no.  I&#39;ll be good.”<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s better.  From now on, little miss, I am your God.  If you&#39;re good you will be treated well.  If you&#39;re bad, a whupping is the least of the things I can do to you.”<br />
<br />
Maybe it was her demon nature, but Jamie found she liked dominating others.  And spanking Terry had felt -good-.  She&#39;d have to ask Gemory about that.  She wasn&#39;t sure what to think about these new feelings, or what they entailed.<br />
<br />
“Now give us hugs.”<br />
<br />
Terry whimpered but hugged the youthful demoness.  And Jamie feasted on the turmoil in the tiny girl&#39;s heart, leaving her unnaturally calm.</p>
