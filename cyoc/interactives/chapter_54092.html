<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan woke up, a bit dizzy and worn out. But when he was human he had experienced more troublesome pains. He tried to open his eyes. Where was he again? What happened? As his eye lids opened a blurry morning sun awaited him. O yes, that’s right he remembered now. He readjusted his eyes to the light. His sister wasen’t  that pleased when he refused his cooperation as a dog. Ha! How could she ever think he would work with the likes of her!<br />
<br />
For some reason it was cold, but it didn’t seem to bother him. That crazy bitch wanted him to be a mother for some reason. Well, that wasen’t completely fair, he knew the reason. He had been a jerk to her all his life.<br />
<br />
Dan could slowly see more and more things around him. He was a small animal that was certain, but where was he? He looked around, It was new and strange, yet somehow familiar. He lifted his head. Around him there was grass, a few tree’s and a large pond. He KNEW this pond, when he was little he had been playing her in the summer, catching frogs, trying to catch fish, or just a quick dive. If this was the pond that he thought it was then…<br />
<br />
He turned his head to east. Yep there only 40 yards away was his house. He was in the large backyard of his parents. If he would ever get his hand on that sister of his then -. “Splash!”. Dan looked around, the sound had come from the pond. That’s right his sister had turned him into something else. Something much smaller then a dog. He took a step with his left foot, then his right. Damn I am really heavy, heavy and slow. He glanced at his left foot, or rather it was a strange green paw.<br />
<br />
“O great, another freak-show” He started to fasten up his pace to the pond. There at the edge he sighed and took a deep breath, what was he going to see? He slowly stretched his head, and looked at his reflection in the water. Yep, he had already suspected it, a tortoise, a smooth stomp face greeted him. Not just any tortoise a Snap tortoise. He recognized the snap jaw from biology class.<br />
<br />
He came a bit closer,  he could see his shell. He wasent that big yet, probably and adolescent,  His shell was about  13 inch wide, and 5 inches high. He moved another bit closer, was this really him?<br />
<br />
And that was to close. Dan lost his new balance and slided head down into the cold pond. “Brff, Grggl”  Dan instinctively  was trying to breath in as much as he could. The feeling of cold water hitting him in the morning was as throwing a rock to his face. After a few  dazed minutes his turtle body had adjusted to the temprature. His eyes slowly opened. He could see a greenish blurry light, he looked up. There was the sandy bottom of the pond. The BOTTOM of the pond? He wildly started to flip his paws. He had been laying upside down! He flipped and crawled, but he was only turning around in circles, This was harder then he thought, well he had only been a turtle for a few moments. Being unable to swim like one was not his fault.<br />
<br />
He noticed he didn’t need air yet. Dan could probably go half an hour without air. Still it was looking really, really clumsy. After a few minutes he figured out how to turn around. With one swirl, down was down, and up was up again. Diving up from the water, Dan realized it was actually quite comfortable. He looked up to the sky. It was morning, remembering class, turtles were reptiles, not amphibians. He had to get out of the water! Dan looked around, he could see the edge of the pond, half crawling, and half swimming, the shore was reached!<br />
<br />
With more luck and effort, then actual skill. He was able to crawl up the shore, back on solid ground. I know I don’t ever want to do that again! What was Kat thinking, Her only brother could have drowned in there. He took a few minutes to take take his breath. He would crawl to his mom and somehow convince her  that he was her son. Then Dan felt strange, and fuzzy. The sun was gaining more power. He blinked his eyes, This here, being in the sun. It felt so incredibly good. He sprawled his arms and legs laid his head resting on the ground.<br />
<br />
Mmmmm, He would get up in another minute, His mother would be convinced, His sister punished and “Yaaaawn” everything would be normal again. With this dream he doze off, having a nice vision of chasing frogs and mice.<br />
<br />
Unaware of his sister watching him from a few “magically” looking bushes, She smiled, Maybe now her plan could work.</p>
