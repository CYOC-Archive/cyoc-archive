<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake finds himself moving to his bedroom door, the curse puppeting his limbs to fulfill Kyle&#39;s commands. He tries to strain against his own muscles, to no avail. His eyes widen and begin darting around as he approaches the front door to his home, growing increasingly frantic as a sheen of sweat begins to appear across his skin.<br />
<br />
He&#39;s desperate for any sort of reprieve from the fate that has just been delivered to him by a petty nerd.<br />
<br />
His hand wraps itself around the door knob, and Jake marches outside, the curse not even pausing or slowing the motion of his legs to put on any shoes.<br />
<br />
Jake, suddenly thankful he&#39;s otherwise fully dressed sans one sock, winces in pain as stray rocks dig into the sensitive soles of his feet as the curse guides him along the path to Kyle&#39;s home. He finds himself gazing longingly at passing cars, desperately wishing the curse had chosen that option over this forced, barefoot march for god knows how many miles.<br />
<br />
By the time Jake finally makes it to Kyle&#39;s, it&#39;s been at least a couple of hours, his feet are sore, bleeding, are caked in mud, and he is soaked in sweat. Jake had previously known that his school pooled students from across town together, but never truly understood what a distance that was until now.<br />
<br />
The curse guides Jake&#39;s hand to the knob of the font door, pushing it open and forcing him to step inside. He feels some amount of petty satisfaction at the dirty foot prints he&#39;s surely leaving behind him on the flooring.<br />
<br />
Next, he&#39;s taken up the stairs. His muscles are tired, and he desperately wishes that the curse had paused for even just a moment to allow him a break, but he still has no choice but to continue. <br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t stop if he tried, and he had tried. The first 3 or 4 miles of his hike had felt like hell, and all the fighting he did against his own body rewarded him nothing. Jake had, at the very least, assigned himself to this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Finally!&quot; A door at the end of the upstairs hallway cracks open, and Kyle emerges. &quot;I&#39;m going to be marked absent from all my morning classes at the rate you&#39;re going.&quot;<br />
<br />
His voice is scathing, and dehumanizing in a way. It&#39;s obvious to Jake that Kyle is already divorcing the concept of humanity from the jock.<br />
<br />
Jake, with some alarm, notes that his hands are now going for the button of his pants. He feels nauseous as his fingers undo the fastening and pull the zipper down. His dread only grows heavier as he&#39;s forced to drop his pants, turn, and present his ass to Kyle.<br />
<br />
&quot;There we go,&quot; Kyle is speaking again, and Jake would jump if he could at the sudden feeling of Kyle&#39;s hands pulling his cheeks apart. &quot;We&#39;ll have you in your new home soon, Cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake wishes he had the control over his body to be able to stiffen at the sound of Kyle&#39;s own zipper. Or, perhaps, at the feeling of Kyle&#39;s blunt cock head bumping up against his unprepared hole. He wishes he could scream as he&#39;s suddenly penetrated, the forceful opening of his body immensely painful. <br />
<br />
Kyle moans behind him as he hilts himself within Jake&#39;s body, balls slapping against Jake&#39;s with the momentum of his thrust. Jake feels his entire body begin tingle as Kyle pulls out, only to ram himself back in.<br />
<br />
Their skin slaps together, but Kyle&#39;s thrusts are forced to become more and more shallow as the curse begins to take effect, fusing the two teenagers together. Kyle grinds his cock into Jake, relishing the feeling of both a warm body and the stimulating magic.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s now that Jake starts to change, his legs drawing upwards and pulling back to meet Kyle&#39;s balls. Kyle hoists Jake up into his arms, the jock no longer supported by his legs, and reach a hand down to fondle what is developing into his new testicles. <br />
<br />
He doesn&#39;t have full sensation, not yet, but it&#39;s beginning to creep in as the merging progresses. The bones of Jake&#39;s legs are dissolving, leaving a fleshy bag of skin for Kyle to tug at and play with. <br />
<br />
The skin softens, thins as it becomes more sensitive and delicate. Kyle&#39;s enthusiasm grows as what no longer resembles legs finally meets his old balls, the two merging together and his testicles dropping into his new, larger sack. The organs feel as if they&#39;re growing just as the skin shrinks around them, and Kyle moans loudly as he toys with them.<br />
<br />
Jake, still human from the waist up, is still fighting his own body for any modicum of control. He feels sick, violated, and the way Kyle is already treating Jake as simply a part of himself only amplifies the feelings.<br />
<br />
He gags, a sudden ray of hope for Jake. His nausea finally winning against the curse puppeting his body can&#39;t be anything other than a good sign. Jake gags again, and is allowed to start hacking. His hope is extinguished as soon as what&#39;s coming up from his throat finally hits his tongue. It&#39;s salty and bitter, and deeply unpleasant.<br />
<br />
There&#39;s no mistaking the taste of cum.<br />
<br />
Kyle begins to run his hands over Jake&#39;s form, the nerves finally connecting and allowing him to feel what is, essentially, an obscenely huge penis in the shape of a man. The transformation has crept up from Jake&#39;s new balls to his new base, his still human torso measuring nearly 3 feet long, still. Jake is held up by Kyle, rubbing against his chest with the nerd panting in his ear. His own cock still bobs in front of them both, forced erect not by Jake&#39;s doing, but by the force of Kyle&#39;s blood entering his own new erection.<br />
<br />
As Jake&#39;s shift to cockflesh continues, he slowly feels the pounding of Kyle&#39;s heart grow in intensity. There is no doubt in his mind that, if Kyle released him and allowed his new form to shift freely, he&#39;d bob along to the rhythm. Jake&#39;s panic only begins to grow as his own heartbeat starts to fade away, now extraneous with Kyle&#39;s blood flowing through him.<br />
<br />
Below, Jake&#39;s cock is finally beginning to shrink and dissipate, blending seamlessly into the cock that he is becoming. The part of him that is undeniably inhuman is nearing his navel, which is quickly wiped away with ease. It&#39;s becoming difficult for him to breathe, lungs being converted into nothing but another section of Kyle&#39;s new dick.<br />
<br />
Kyle&#39;s panting grows more intense, and Jake feels what used to be his legs draw up tighter against Kyle&#39;s body, still too large to easily fit between the nerd&#39;s own. Jake&#39;s mouth begins being flooded by foul tasting cum, the curse not allowing him to spit it out, causing it to dribble down his form slowly.<br />
<br />
Then, the force of Kyle&#39;s orgasm hits. Cum is launched from Jake&#39;s mouth, the body he still has no control over bucking in the cage of Kyle&#39;s arms, Jake&#39;s own flopping bonelessly. The pleasure is there for Jake, hitting his mind with the force of a train, but it still cannot overcome the disgust he&#39;s feeling. A prisoner in his own body, being changed and made nothing more than a tool.<br />
<br />
Finally, finally, Jake begins to shrink. He&#39;s still not flaccid by any means, but is slowly moving away from the obscene 3 foot cock he had been resembling before. His head, arms and torso are still relatively intact, a man&#39;s features shoved onto a penis.<br />
<br />
When Jake at last begins to grow limp, he&#39;s still nearly 12 inches long. Kyle runs his hands over his new piece of anatomy, squishing what would be a ribcage if Jake had still been whole together. Next, he pulls on Jake&#39;s arms, tries to mash his skull into his neck. Despite appearances, Jake is, indeed, nothing but a boneless piece of meat.<br />
<br />
Kyle releases his new cock, allowing Jake to drop freely to his new place in between Kyle&#39;s legs. Exhausted and horrified, Jake is no longer fighting. The curse may or may not still have a deathtrap on his autonomy, and he simply can&#39;t bear to bring himself to challenge the possibility.<br />
<br />
Jake sees the floor move beneath him as he swings alongside Kyle&#39;s gait. Wood, to carpet, to tile, to carpet and back to wood. Sees Kyle toss a towel down on the puddle of cum, though his sight is a little obscured as Kyle crouches to mop it up. Kyle returns to the bathroom, presumably to toss the towel into a laundry pile, before walking back out into the hall.<br />
<br />
He bends, scooping up the underwear and pants he had abandoned to claim his prize. Kyle grabs his new man-shaped cock, twisting lightly to force Jake to look at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope you enjoyed that,&quot; Kyle says, gleeful, &quot;because you&#39;re not leaving your new home.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that, Kyle steps into his boxers, pulling them up and tucking Jake away. The confines of the cloth are dark, and feel suffocating despite Jake no longer having a need to breathe. <br />
<br />
The seam of the pants Kyle&#39;s wearing mashes Jake uncomfortably, and he instinctively tries to squirm into a more comfortable position, before freezing. Jake takes a moment to process, before attempting to move his arms and neck. Somehow, despite everything, he can still move, at least a little.</p>
