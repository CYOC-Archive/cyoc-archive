Perfectly Fitting Clothes, Part 2<br />
By extramorphs<br />
<br />
&quot;Now hold on a moment,&quot; Amanda chided, &quot;you&#39;ve been hogging the spray and I haven&#39;t gotten to use any myself!&quot;<br />
I replied, &quot;Yeah, but you already had big breasts. Why would you need to use it?&quot;<br />
Amanda shot back at me a bit sarcastically, &quot;Hmm, ya think that since I have big boobs there&#39;s nothing about myself I want to improve?&quot;<br />
She tapped her foot as I thought about this. Since the first thing I tried it on was my breasts, it hadn&#39;t occurred to me that the spray might work elsewhere. &quot;Okay, I see your point,&quot; I conceded.<br />
&quot;Good. Now give me the spray... and one of your jackets.&quot;<br />
&quot;A jacket? Why?&quot;<br />
She gave me a deadpan stare, as if I&#39;d find out soon enough anyway, and I figured it was best to just do as she asked. I handed her the spray and turned to search my closet for a jacket that I thought would fit her short stature and arms.<br />
She didn&#39;t even have to say anything this time, and about half way through rummaging in my closet, I realized she didn&#39;t want a jacket that fit. That was the whole point. I grabbed the nearest jacket, a gray dress jacket with squared shoulders and three buttons down the front, and handed it to her.<br />
She took the jacket and put it on. It fit her so poorly it was almost comical. The sleeves were long enough to hide her entire hands, save for just the fingertips if she straightened them out. The tail of the jacket almost completely covered her butt, and with her breasts, the jacket couldn&#39;t even button the top button.<br />
Amanda picked up the spray and, as she was about to spray, asked me, &quot;Does it hurt?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; I paused long enough for her to start spraying and replied, &quot;You have NO idea.&quot;<br />
With her sleeves soaked, she gave me a panicked look, afraid of the pain I had implied that was about to bear down upon her.<br />
In reality, having the spray work on you wasn&#39;t that bad. A bit pleasurable, almost. Of course, I had used it only on my breasts, and she was about to have it work on bones and muscles, so in telling her it hurt a lot, I might actually have been right.<br />
She looked at me and winced, and then, her expression relaxed. Her lips parted as her mouth rested slightly open, and her eyes closed and she sighed a deep, pleasant sigh. I looked and saw her fingertips actually sticking out of the jacket, and slowly extending further. I could hear the fabric moving against her flesh. She held her arms out slightly away from her sides, as if anything touching them might interrupt the growth process. I could now clearly see the entire tip of her middle fingers. She began to breathe heavier, eyes still shut, chest heaving up and down. Her entire second knuckle of her middle fingers were now visible, and were shaking ever so slightly. Each breath she gave was a deeply contented sigh; if I weren&#39;t staring at her hands, the sound would have made me assume they were deep in her pants.<br />
Her knees locked and started to wobble as she became ever more absorbed in her transformation. The entire length of her fingers were now visible, and as I looked more closely, they seemed different. Amanda had always been a bit of a rough-and-tumble girl, but here her fingers were that of a delicate, elegant woman. Not dainty or weak, but smooth and pointed nonetheless. She began to wiggle them a bit as her growth continued.<br />
She stepped over to the bed and sat down, lest she collapse on the floor, though she still held her arms up as not to touch anything. Her heavy sighing evolved into what seemed to almost be a panting, and her eyes were opening but unfocused, clearly not looking at anything in particular. Her growth seemed to accelerate, as I could now see half of her hand, all the way to the joint of the thumb. The sleeve pulled back to show more of her hand - or did her hand extend from the sleeve? It was happening so fast it was hard to tell.<br />
With her hands now fully visible from the ends of the sleeves, she gasped and fell back onto the bed, immediately shooting her new, longer arms into her pants. I decided that it would be best to let her have her extremely intimate moment alone, so I left my own room, but not before grabbing the spray.<br />
I could hear Amanda&#39;s moans from the hallway, and tried to think about what I would use the spray on next. Part of me wanted to do something wacky just to surprise her when I came back, and another part of me wanted to think about a serious change. Another part of me just wanted to pleasure myself, but I knew I could wait until later. All three parts agreed: I&#39;d use the spray to change myself in a way that would let me pleasure myself.<br />
But what did I have that I could use to grow into? Amanda was still moaning in my bedroom, which had my closet. I decided to head downstairs.<br />
As I stepped on each step down, I could feel the weight of my four breasts shake with each step. I hadn&#39;t walked down stairs with big breasts before, let alone four of them. The upper breasts, which had as much weight as a large grapefruit, seemed to almost rest on the lower breasts, themselves closer to apples.<br />
I wasn&#39;t wearing any bras so I decided to cradle my breasts as I walked down the stairs, with my left arm around my lower pair and my right arm around my upper pair.<br />
It was bizarre to me to have breasts big enough to cradle, and fill up my hand. Further more strange was having a larger breast in my right hand than in my left hand. While my left hand could comfortably hold one of my lower breasts, my right hand seemed to sink into my upper left breast as I tried to get my fingers around it. I made a mental note to slightly downsize my upper breasts when I got the chance, but not too much. It would be nice to have four matching breasts.<br />
Downstairs was a bit colder, and I could feel all four of my nipples stiffen under my T-shirt. It was time to get creative with the spray.<br />
I rummaged through my purse and found a condom I had been carrying for a little while. It was a left-over from my past relationship; I wasn&#39;t sure why I was carrying it, since I would never use it on a stranger, but I guess it was an old sex-ed habit to always be ready in case the time came. Well, I was ready, and it was time to use it.<br />
I sat down on the leather couch, unbuttoned my jeans, and slid them down onto my thighs. I did the same with my panties. I admired my neatly-shaved pussy, still perfectly smooth from yesterday&#39;s shower. I deliberately took a long time to shave, and I was proud of my handiwork.<br />
I grabbed the condom and took it out of its package. It wasn&#39;t anything special; it was just a regular condom. No Magnum or Tiny Picker here. Like many condoms, it was lubricated, which made it a little slippery to hold, but I managed. I kept it rolled up and turned it over until the right side was pointing up, and then I set it on my mons pubis, just above my labia.<br />
For a moment, I paused. What was I doing?<br />
I looked down at my unique chest, admiring all of my new hills and valleys. They were quite beautiful, even hidden by my t-shirt. I took a moment to feel myself through my shirt, just to confirm again that they were really real.<br />
I overheard a particularly loud series of moans from Amanda, and creaking sounds from the bed. A few seconds later, silence. I listened for a moment more, and realized she had fallen asleep. I held the condom in place with my left hand, grabbed the bottle with my right, and with a quick mist, before my inhibitions came back, gave it a spray.<br />
I sat in silence for what felt like an eternity as it soaked in. I could probably still remove the condom and back out of this, but I couldn&#39;t move. Right as I was on the fence about it, something happened.<br />
I began to feel a strong tingling sensation right below where the condom was sitting, almost like when your leg falls asleep and wakes back up, but less painful. It was a combination of a static electrical charge, mixed with a deep, pleasant itch being scratched. I deeply wanted to touch the spot where all of this was happening, underneath the condom, but did not want to interrupt the process at all, so I held my left hand on the condom while my right hand gripped the couch.<br />
The feeling evolved into a deep pulling, almost like somebody had placed a powerful suction cup on my skin and was tugging at it. The feeling changed again, but this time felt more like a vacuum cleaner attachment pressed into my skin, stretching and pulling it. I looked down to find the tip of the condom had inflated with a tiny dome. I looked more closely and saw that the condom was semi-transparent, and that there was flesh growing inside of it. The mound was maybe three-quarters of an inch tall, perfectly domed in the ring of the condom which sat about an inch and a half across the inside.<br />
The pulling continued, bringing the static along with it. It still felt like the vacuum, but I could feel my skin stretching more, as if the vacuum&#39;s pull was pulling my skin and flesh into the tube. I looked down again and saw the dome had risen to over an inch tall. It continued to push its way up into the condom, which became slightly more see-through as the latex stretched out.<br />
The sensation of the tugging began to feel more like pushing from the inside. It felt like this new appendage was forcing its way out of me, longing to be freed. The latex was tight, but the growing force was stronger - the bulbous swelling continued, now almost two inches tall.<br />
The deep feeling of the itch being scratched turned even more pleasurable, and I moved my right hand from the couch to my upper right nipple and squeezed &quot;“ hard. If I weren&#39;t so deeply in pleasure at this point, I would have contemplated at how strange it was to now have four choices of nipples to play with instead of two. Pleasure and pain shot from my breast, though it was a bit like a leaf in the wind compared to the pleasure emanating from my loins.<br />
The accelerating growth now felt like a stroking sensation, like an invisible hand were pulling my own flesh from the surface. I looked down again to make sure there wasn&#39;t actually a hand there and found that the protrusion was now at least three inches long, and still an inch and a half wide. A ridge was clearly forming about an inch from the top, pushing itself into the condom like a whale about to break from the surface of the ocean.<br />
I used my forefinger and thumb of my left hand, still holding the condom in place, to squeeze the base of the shaft. It was stiff and rigid, and as I pushed on it with my forefinger to the right a little, could feel the movement all the way down deep inside of me.<br />
The stroking feeling intensified, and the static, itch-being-scratched feeling was still strong, moving up and down inside my rod, pushing it out from my body further and further. I moved my right hand from my upper right breast, down to my lower right breast, to give it a squeeze, and finally down to my pussy. I was not surprised to find myself soaking wet.<br />
I reached around my growing shaft and began to gently rub my clitoris. I had a deep orgasm building, and I was not going to let this new appendage have all the fun. I squeezed a muscle down there, and as I did, my bulging member shot out a full inch and a wave of pleasure shot over my body, starting from my pussy, soaring up through my breasts, up my neck, my face, and finally to the top of my head, while at the same time shooting into my hips, thighs, legs, and feet, reaching the tip of my toes. I squeezed again, rubbing myself vigorously now, and had the same result - another incredible wave of pleasure, along with another inch of growth. I estimated I was now at five-and-a-half-inches!<br />
I was on the very edge of my orgasm, and was ready to push over the edge. I squeezed again, and this time what I felt was more of a hurricane than a wave. My penis fully filled out the condom at a full six-and-a-half inches, and as the pleasure was crashing over me, my hips began to shake as my pussy twitched and I began to orgasm. I felt the deep pressure inside of me began to release as I came in both organs, my cock shooting load after load into the condom. My toes curled, my legs tightened, my butt clenched, my shoulders squeezed, my eyes fluttered, and my hands grabbed onto my genitals for dear life. I could feel my cock throbbing, coming in time with my pussy&#39;s rhythmic squeezing.<br />
Finally, with a deep, contented sigh, it was over, as a final wave of relief washed over me, though my hips were still occasionally twitching on their own. I rested my hands on the couch and let my head relax on my shoulder as I panted for a moment, deeply satisfied more than I had ever been in my life.<br />
I took a moment to inspect myself. I was sweating all over, sitting on the couch with my pants half-off, and a cock sprouting proudly from above my pussy, still with a condom full of cum on it. As my penis softened, I decided it would be best to clean up before the condom came off of its own volition. I walked, pants down, into the guest bathroom, removed the condom, and wiped myself down.<br />
As I was cleaning up, I stood up and admired myself in the mirror. I had four full, proud breasts sitting atop my chest, a neat little pussy, and a cock, now only four inches flaccid, resting above my pussy. I jumped up and down to move it, then shook my hips back and forth, marveling at its existence. Of course, I didn&#39;t have balls, but I figured that was because the spray knew better than to try to stuff the balls into the condom. I squeezed it a little more, and then decided to put my pants back on.<br />
Now, these weren&#39;t the tightest pants ever, but they certainly couldn&#39;t be described as &quot;baggy.&quot; I would say I had never exercised more caution in my entire life than in that moment when I was pulling up my zipper for the first time. I tucked my penis off to the right, buttoned the pants, and zipped up. If I hunched forward a little, you might not notice the tiny bulge; when I leaned back and thrust my hips forward, there was no mistaking it. I had no idea how I was going to hide it if I got an erection.<br />
I could hear rustling around upstairs and realized Amanda was awake. I wasn&#39;t going to tell her about my newest appendage... not yet, anyway. I heard footsteps coming down the stairs and grabbed a book, to pretend I had been reading to pass the time.<br />
She was a mess. Her hair was all over the place, and the jacket was wrinkled, though she still had it on - and her arms still cleanly reached out of the sleeves. She wiped her eyes for a moment and yawned, then, looking down at her hands, remembered what happened - she blushed and apologized for not controlling herself in my room.<br />
I comforted her, telling her it was okay, and that I wanted to come down here to read anyway.<br />
She took off the jacket, and I got to see her new arms - and they were stunning! Not only were they longer than before, but they were smooth and even slightly toned.<br />
&quot;What do you think?&quot; she asked, as she placed the jacket on a chair and then put her hands on her hips to show off her arms. &quot;Not bad, eh?&quot;<br />
I could only stare as she stretched her arms wide. &quot;Flex for me!&quot; I jeered.<br />
She flexed her biceps in a classic muscle-man pose. She didn&#39;t have big bulky muscles like a body builder, just smooth, shapely ones. As she turned around, I could clearly see her triceps even.<br />
She held her hands up to her face to admire her new fingers. &quot;I could get used to these,&quot; she said, a twinkle in her eye as she clearly thought about her experience earlier. &quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell me growing was so pleasurable?!&quot; she demanded.<br />
&quot;Honestly, I didn&#39;t know. Growing breasts felt good, but it wasn&#39;t absolutely mind blowing. It was like a pleasurable groping. What was so great about your arms?&quot;<br />
Amanda thought about it for a moment, and then sighed wistfully, as though she wanted to experience it again. &quot;Here, give me your arm for a second.&quot;<br />
I walked closer to her, careful to try to draw attention away from my new bulge, and reached my right arm out to her. She gently took my arm, and rested my hand upon her left shoulder. She leaned her head left to press her cheek into my hand, holding it in place, and gave me a little smile.<br />
She slowly lifted her arms up and let her hands hang as if they were flowers made of silk. She reached forward and touched her left hand to the underside of my arm and her right to the top. She touched my skin as lightly as possible, almost to the point that she wasn&#39;t touching me, and began to slowly draw her fingers over my skin.<br />
As she moved her hands down my arm, at an almost imperceptibly slow rate, I experienced what felt like tiny electric sparks dancing from her fingertips into my skin. The sensation was amazing, but was more sensual than it was sexual. As she drew her hands along my arm, half way toward my elbow, she began to gently flick her fingers up and down, so that instead of two groups of five fingers, it felt more like a million tiny fireflies dancing on my skin. I closed my eyes and relaxed, enjoying her caressing my skin.<br />
Her hands passed my elbow, though the tingling remained in my upper arm. I was amazed that she was able to do what she was doing to me. If I hadn&#39;t come just minutes ago, I would be getting extremely turned on by this.<br />
When she finally reached my wrist, my whole arm was glowing. It felt like we could turn off the lights and we&#39;d be able to see it. Of course, if we turned off the lights and Amanda continued doing what she was doing to the rest of my body...<br />
No, I couldn&#39;t do that. I had to stop this train of thought or else I knew for sure I&#39;d grow erect and she&#39;d discover my secret change. I couldn&#39;t have that. Not yet, anyway...<br />
She pulled her cheek away from my hand and gave me my arm back.<br />
&quot;Did you like that? Now imagine that times twenty. That&#39;s what growing my arms felt like.&quot;<br />
I&#39;d definitely have to try it some time.<br />
