<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gloria was on top of the world as she reveled in having drunk the blood of this titanic woman, but she knew she had to move on.  The woman reached under her own skirt to try to swat Gloria away, but, as is usually the case, all that happened was that the woman’s giant hand brushed a waft of air over to Gloria, sending her off the thigh.  Gloria took the hint and flew out under the skirt and off onto the resort lawn.<br />
<br />
Now she wasn’t sure what to do.  She loved sucking the blood of a giant human and was looking forward to doing it again,, but she was so full that she knew she wasn’t ready.  <br />
<br />
There was plenty else for her to do, though, to experience life as a fly.  Part of the appeal of the resort was its proximity to a small tropical forest, full of vegetation.  Gloria wanted to see what that was like.<br />
<br />
It turned out to be a lot of fun.  Gloria flew around the giant palm trees and lush grasses and bright, beautiful flowers.  Everything was so gorgeous, so aromatic, and so vivid.  It seemed like a fun place to explore at her size.  She found herself releasing some kind of secretion, probably from all the excitement of being a fly out in the wild.<br />
<br />
One thing Gloria found curious is the other flies who were, well, flying around nearby.  She had no idea about anything about them: whether she could communicate with them, whether they were male or female, or even whether they were the same species.  So she avoided contact, only touching other flies when they bumped into her.<br />
<br />
After a while Gloria was sick of the bumping and found a flower petal where she could land and relax for a bit.  To her dismay, another fly landed next to her.  Gloria thought about the times she was the only person in a movie theater and the next person to arrive sat next to her.  What is it with some people, and some insects?  <br />
<br />
Gloria quickly discovered that the other fly was not there to watch the movie together, though, as the fly climbed onto Gloria’s back and began stroking her head.  Gloria figured that the fly wasn’t trying to kill her, so she decided to see where things went.  Soon she began flapping her wings involuntarily, which the other fly took as a sign to back down behind her.  Gloria knew she was enjoying this, but she didn’t know why, until she felt one of her body parts in her lower abdomen—a body part she didn’t even know she had—thrust itself behind her and into the other fly.  In a flash she knew: she was mating.  She was an insect, and she was mating.<br />
<br />
Gloria couldn’t tell if it was the thrill of where the transformation had taken her or genuine insect sexual arousal, but she was in heaven.  She didn’t know who was pumping who, but she spent several minutes copulating with the other fly.  Eventually the two relaxed their organs and the other fly separated from her.  A few seconds later, it flew away and Gloria was alone on the flower petal, having had one of the strangest and most intense experiences of her life.  By this point, the sun was going down, and Gloria wanted to be less out in the open.  She found a nook in one of the palm trees.  With the cool night air breezing over her, she curled her wings over her fly head and went to sleep.<br />
<br />
She woke up the next morning feeling fine.  She was excited to see that she felt completely natural waking up as a fly, and no sense of surprise or waking from a dream.  She thought to herself that she must be pretty good at this.  She did notice that she was feeling pretty heavy for some reason, and that she felt dry and exposed.  <br />
<br />
After flying around the forest for a while and not finding anywhere that seemed appealing to land, she glanced out over the lawn towards the resort.  There, she watched a guest walking a dog around the resort.  Gloria assumed that the dog was a transformed human, but she had no way of knowing for sure.  In any event, she watched the dog crouch and take a dump on the lawn, followed by its owner doing absolutely nothing and walking off without cleaning it up.<br />
<br />
Gloria stared at the pile of shit and thought, that’s my place.  She flew over and noticed that the smell was far from nasty; in fact, it was kind of pleasant.  She landed on top of the fresh turd and dug in her legs.  After a couple of minutes digging her way into the pile of shit, Gloria crouched backwards herself and let out a huge mass of ... well, she didn’t know what.  All she knew was that she felt much better than she did after waking up.  Honestly, she felt kind of triumphant.<br />
<br />
Gloria flew away a bit and then flew back, turning around so she could examine what she had just pushed out of her.  It was a wet, mushy pile of something, with hundreds of little dots in it.  With a start, Gloria finally put it all together: those were eggs!  When she was mounted last night, she had been impregnated, and she had just laid dozens upon dozens of eggs.  Soon these eggs would be maggots, and maybe after that they would become flies like her.  This was crazy: she had just given birth in a gigantic pile of dogshit.  She was a fly.<br />
<br />
Gloria smiled, knowing that she had become a mother as a fly long before she ever had as a human.  She loved being a fly, and she loved the Transformation Resort.</p>
