<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She woke early the next day with a smile on her face.  Then she noticed her nipples were practically bursting through her shirt, and she remembered the dream she&#39;d been having.  Luke, sweeping her up in his arms.  Luke, whispering sweet nothings into her ear.  Luke...taking her under a full moon with a rough passion that had her screaming his name.  She realized her panties were soaked.  She might have even had an orgasm in the night.  Oh my.<br />
<br />
But she changed her panties with a spare pair from her inventory and went to work.  She had to do some things before she met with Luke today, some business things.  After all, she was out of money.  If she didn&#39;t complete a quest today, she&#39;d go hungry, and if she went hungry she couldn&#39;t restore her HP and MP, and that would send her on a downward spiral towards her end.<br />
<br />
So first she pricked her finger and drew a small magic circle on the ground in blood.  It was time to use her last ability.  After reading up on demon familiar summoning, she&#39;d decided to hold off until now.  They were fragile things at the low levels, and if one died the consequences were high.  Moreover, they were a dead giveaway that you had ties to darkness.  If common villagers saw you with one, you might get burned at the stake.  But she had a plan now.  While skipping through the streets yesterday she&#39;d come across a potion shop, and managed to use her incredibly high charisma(and maybe a little bit of leaning over to &quot;accidentally&quot; let him see down her dress) to persuade the owner to give her a powerful skill potion on loan.  She COULD drink it herself and level up her summoning, but that would just give her a more powerful familiar that was no less likely to get her burned at the stake.  So she&#39;d come up with another idea.<br />
<br />
She finished the circle and chanted the magic.  The lights flickered, and then there was a sudden poof of black smoke from the circle.  When it cleared, she had her familiar.<br />
<br />
It was...cute?  It was some sort of imp, she thought.  Black, horned, but looking a bit more feline than humanoid, though it was capable of walking on two legs.  Also it was absolutely tiny, much smaller than a cat.  Appearances were deceiving, though.  She could instantly feel her connection to it, and through it a connection to hell itself and all the power within.<br />
<br />
It looked up at her expectantly, and she dared say almost innocently, if a demon could be innocent.<br />
<br />
She brought up the creature&#39;s stats.<br />
<br />
:::<br />
Name:  Buut<br />
Lv. 1 Demon Familiar<br />
HP: 5/5<br />
MP: 80/80<br />
Element: Darkness<br />
Information: The familiar of Lillian Love, it was born in hell only a few days ago.<br />
Active Skills:<br />
-Spell Copy:  Whenever Lillian casts a spell, Buut may cast the same spell for half the MP cost, within 5 seconds.<br />
Passive Skills:<br />
-Mana Magnification:  Buut increases the MP of his mistress by 40% when he is within 36 meters of her.  In addition he increases the power of her offensive spells by 10%.  If Buut dies, his mistress will lose a large amount of XP, potentially lowering her level.<br />
-Curse of Hell:  When Buut is within range, his mistress&#39;s Succubus Transformation will be 30% stronger.  However, she will also become corrupted 40% faster.<br />
-Shared Sight:  Buut can allow his mistress to see what he sees, and vice versa.<br />
:::<br />
<br />
Lillian blinked.  Wow, that was a big power boost alright, though the part about being corrupted faster in Succubus form was a definite drawback.  She supposed she could always order Buut to get out of range if she needed her Succubus form?<br />
<br />
However, she still had the problem of how to hide him.  That was what the skill potion was for.  She&#39;d read up on familiars, and they didn&#39;t react to skill potions the same way as most species.  Instead of leveling up their skills, skill potions caused them to acquire NEW skills.<br />
<br />
She poured the potion into a little bowl, and gave Buut a command &quot;Drink up!&quot;  she said.  Buut tilted his head.  &quot;It&#39;s for you.  Come on, drink.&quot;  But Buut only stared at her.   &quot;Come on now, ya doofus, drink up or I&#39;m changing your name to Butt!&quot;  Buut proceeded to sit on his butt and yawn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Butt it is then. &quot; said Lillian, and she giggled when she saw his stats change to reflect the new name.  Butt seemed to be aware of this, and finally responded: with anger.  He growled and hissed like the world&#39;s meanest kitten.<br />
<br />
&quot;Complaining won&#39;t help you, Butt.&quot;  said Lillian.  What she&#39;d read had told her that demons needed a little training sometimes, but that a firm hand was good.  &quot;Drink up and follow my orders and I might change it back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Butt glowered at her, but at last he drank.  When he had finished, his eyes lit up as power coursed through him.  He looked at his mistress in shock:  he&#39;d never been given anything resembling a gift before.  It was every demon for itself in hell.  He watched her now with wide eyes as she dealt with a new window that had popped up in front of her.<br />
<br />
:::Familiar Skill Acquisition!<br />
<br />
Choose Skill:<br />
-Transformation<br />
-Possession<br />
-Demon Sight<br />
-Hell&#39;s Mark<br />
<br />
She looked through the options, though she already knew what she wanted.  Hell&#39;s Mark was apparently an ability to invisibly brand a target with a mark that would slowly corrupt them.  Not useful to her.  Demon Sight, on the other hand, allowed Buut and by extension her to view advanced information on targets as well as to see their auras.  That might be useful, later.  Possession also seemed incredibly powerful, once leveled up, but what she needed right now was transformation.<br />
<br />
She selected it and Butt&#39;s eyes lit up again as the ability to shapeshift poured into his brain.  He started to hop around in joy.  Lillian smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright alright, now, can you turn into a raven?&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked at her and tilted his head, but then sure enough he began to shift and grow feathers and soon a black bird sat there staring at her.  Now people would think he was her sorceress animal familiar, not a succubus demon familiar.  It was the perfect cover.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good job, Butt!&quot;  She said.  Praise was also new to Butt.  &quot;I guess I&#39;ll change your name back then, Buut, since you&#39;ve been a good boy.  Now I&#39;d like to take you for a walk, but you need to understand: You MUST stay in your raven form, or we will both be killed.  The people of this town don&#39;t take kindly to demons.&quot;<br />
<br />
This was something Buut could understand a little better.  Even demons didn&#39;t take kindly to demons.  Having to hide was nothing new to him.  The ability to hide in plain sight was just a wonderful new twist.  He nodded his understanding, and fluttered up to his mistress&#39;s shoulder.  He didn&#39;t understand this being that gave him gifts and seemed willing to look out for him, but he decided he liked her.</p>
