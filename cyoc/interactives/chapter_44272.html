<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>As people stood around, chatting with one another about what may or may not happen, Cassie walked up to David and Buzz who were having their own conversation. When the two noticed Cassie standing there, silently and politely, they stopped their conversation to see what she wanted.</Br>
<Br>"Yes Cassie, what is it that we can help you with?"</Br>
<Br>"Oh nothing much Buzz, but do you really believe that everyone here is going into some half human half animal creature?"</Br>
<Br>"Neither David or myself know what the outcome is going to be. We can only surmise that we are, since the computer H.A.N.K. stated that we all would at some point, including you."</Br>
<Br>"Umm... well, that was what I wanted to talk to you and especially David about. I... I lied on my application. I wanted to work here really bad because of what I had heard about the estate and David's parents. I had no clue, like anyone here, that they were military paid scientists. I had just heard that they paid their people well and treated them all like royalty. For once in my life, I thought that if I worked here that I could be treated like that too, since my life has been nothing but a heaping pile of dog-doo."</Br>
<Br>"So what you are telling Buzz and myself, is that you were not exposed to this genetic altering virus?"</Br>
<Br>"Yes, this is correct! I am so sorry for lying to you both, especially to you David..." Cassie stated as she wept profusely.</Br>
<Br>"Hey, hey... don't worry about it. Why don't you just take the rest of the day off and stay in your room. I don't know why, but I feel like things are going to get dangerous in here really quickly."</Br>
<Br>"O... ok, does that mean I still have a job here?"</Br>
<Br>"For now, I don't know... but as soon as I make my decision, since this is my estate, I will let you know."</Br>
<Br>Cassie hung her head low in shame, but then looked back up to David with a smile while looking directly into his eyes. "If you do fire me, I completely understand. To be honest, if I were you, I would fire me too." She then walked out of the study with tears in her eyes, while she hoped for the best for herself.</Br>
<Br>As the double doors closed behind Cassie, the sound of the two banging together in the middle was loud and deafening to everyone in the room. Not understanding why such a noise would be that loud, David called out to Buzz.</Br>
<Br>"What the heck? Why was that so loud?"</Br>
<Br>"I don't know, but I think our senses may be the first thing to get heightened. I do think something more is going to happen."</Br>
<Br>As Buzz finished, David looked at Buzz with wide eyes, staring at his teeth.</Br>
<Br>"Buzz! Your incisors look like fangs!"</Br>
<Br>Buzz quickly felt them with his tongue, then his index finger just to be sure and then Buzz's eyes went just as wide while looking at David. Not only did David have fangs for incisors, his once average body swelled with muscles a bodybuilder worked for years to have. Buzz just pointed for David to look, but he didn't need to look at himself, he was too busy looking at Buzz. While Buzz was already pretty muscular, his muscles ballooned to twice the size that they were already. Unbelievably, everyone could feel the follicles of hair push out of every one of their pores. Everyone in the room were now fur covered behemoths of muscle while their fur color matched their hair color. All of the men in the estate, who were all in that room together, started disrobing including Buzz and David since their clothes were becoming very restrictive and were starting to tear from the strain of covering the new physical forms of everyone there. Once they were all standing naked, looking around at each other, everyone was shocked to see their own cock and balls. Each man there gained an inch or two in length and several inches in girth. Buzz was wide eyed, shocked that he was erect again when he hadn't been able to have an erection for several years. Buzz was also impressed with his own testicles because they were now the size of a baseball each, which guaranteed him sexual stimulus and release.</Br>
<Br>With everyone naked, the physical changes happened even quicker since everyone was free of their human and restrictive clothes, where the body would have to adjust until freed of the clothing. Everyone started changing into what David and Buzz were becoming. David's face pushed out into a lupine muzzle; his eyes changed from his brilliant blue-green hue to an astounding amber; his ears grew somewhat longer while coming to a point while his triangular ears migrated to the top of his head; his hands and feet changed into paws while sharp and black claws pushed their way out from under his human fingernails; thick pads of skin developed on his palms as paw-pads; his feet had done the same while an extra joint developed on his legs to be anatomically correct to what a wolf would have; then finally his tail grew from the base of his spine, stretching the fur covered skin as it did so. Once David's transformation was complete, he looked at himself, seeing that he was covered in a rich auburn fur like his human hair color. Then looking to Buzz, David saw him in his anthrobear form. Buzz was a fine specimen of a bear man, with dark brown fur and Buzz pretty much had the same thing happen to him that David went through, except Buzz had more of a short round muzzle, rounded ears at the top of his head, and a short nub for a tail.</Br>
<Br>Looking around the room at each other, they we all in awe of what just happened. Some were a werewolf, while others were a werebear. Rick was a blond furred werewolf; Bill was a black furred werewolf; Luke was a dark chestnut furred werewolf; Ben, George and Jeff were auburn furred werewolves like David was. Mike was a deep cherry red furred werebear; Gus was a black furred werebear that resembled the size and bulk of a black bear, just more muscular; Ron was a light brown furred werebear. With everyone having different fur colors, it would be much easier for them all to tell each other apart. Looking around the room, with everyone's cocks rock hard and jutting out for all to see, everyone was pleased that even though they looked like animals, their cocks remained human in shape just not in size.</Br>
<Br>Not really knowing what to do, David decides...</Br></p>
