<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cage in hand, you and the boy briefly search and find a small fenced in area. Towards the front, the fence changes to thick glass to allow guest to see into the fenced in exhibit. But with the exhibit empty and no one around, it would make a perfect place to start your show for the young guest.<br />
&quot;If you want a good look, stand right behind that glass&quot; you tell the boy. &quot;I need to focus and don&#39;t want to mess up your clothes&quot;.<br />
The boy stays behind the glass as you enter the fenced off exhibit. You place the rabbit cage on the ground softly and remove the rabbit, and placing him and the carrot onto the ground.<br />
You look down at the rabbit and think. It was time to figure out how to use that new skunk &quot;equipment&quot; you just received and this was your chance. <br />
The first step was how to position yourself. You glance down at your thick clawed paws and feet and feel the muscles in your upper body. Your suddenly remember that skunk&#39;s can spray in a multitude of positions. Your new animal instincts suddenly enter your mind. Options like the classic &quot;u-shape&quot;, standing up anthro style, and even a handstand flood your brain.<br />
Figuring the classic method would be the best for your first time, you drop down onto all fours. You automatically shift into position with your rear and head both pointed towards the unsuspecting rabbit.<br />
Finding the muscles that control your tail, you can feel your tail twitch with life. Now knowing what to move, you raise your tail partially vertical, slightly exposing your rear. You continue to hoist up your furry black and white striped tail, now completely vertical. As you raise up your warning flag, your body automatically fans out your fur and the tip of your tail begins to arch over your back slightly as your tail becomes fully vertical.<br />
Moving to the second step, you start to think about how to spray the bunny. After all, you had the right position now. As you think this, you can feel your animal instincts guiding the way as a sudden weird shifting occurs in your rear. You concentrate and this happens again. You can see in the reflection of the glass a white spot suddenly bulge outwards and the white fur began to move away. As your fur moved your pink anus popped into view, remaining tightly closed.<br />
With your anus fully exposed, you begin to reach the final warning stages. You feel something quiver inside your anus. You focus and can move what feels like two fleshy nubs up and down inside your anus. You realize what these are and a smirk flashes across your face. Those are your stench guns. These are the business bits that do the heavy lifting for every skunk. You realize that those two flexible nubs connect to two large sacs of all natural skunk stink, brewed hot and fresh, fully ready for use.<br />
Your entire body tenses as you start to aim your glands. You being to feel those two fleshy nipples along your asshole slowly slither and tense up as you start to aim for the unsuspecting rabbit, still eating the carrot. Your body automatically starts to draw a target, one for each of the rabbits beady eyes. <br />
Your can feel rather large pink anus widen as your nipples approach the exit. With your anus fully widened, your two spray nipples begin to slither and push against the tightly closed anus. You continue your anal display as your nubs begin to extend and knock on the back door that is your closed pucker, ready to greet the world.<br />
You relax your anus, allowing it to yawn open as your spray nipples begin to push through the opening, extending from a stinky dark home. You can see your new spray nipples now as two large bulbous shaped nubs slip through, coated with a light greasy film. Each of them shine with a golden sheen as the light reflected off the oily film. Your anus continues to open until your nipples fully extend outwards. They start to move involuntary, as your brain works ensure laser precision for your target. Everything suddenly goes still. All that is left is for you to fire.<br />
You let out a low growl. The rabbit stops and quickly looks in your direction. Now was your moment. With the rabbit now looking straight as your anal display in a microsecond your body shifts your glands slightly and aligns with those black rabbit eyes. Your brain screams that the rabbit was in the firing zone and you are ready to fire.<br />
<br />
You clench down hard on your spray glands. Your anus quickly begins to bulge further as the spray glands contract and musk begins to pressurize your skunk spray system. Skunk spray rockets from the skunk glands to your spray nipples, eager to exit and attack your victim. As soon as the musk reaches the tips of your spray nipples, you allow them to completely open, allowing the musk to exit and rocket forward in the air.<br />
You watch in awe as a phosphorescent oily yellow liquid rockets from each nipple. Before the rabbit could even blink, your pressurized stream of skunk funk had already closed the small ten foot gap between you and your target. <br />
The large amount of skunk spray lands right on the rabbits face, perfectly in each eye as they reflexively slam shut, allowing the remainder of the thick spray to splatter across his eyelids and face, staining the fur from white to shiny yellow.<br />
The whole process made you feel great. The power you held, was immense. Without even thinking, you only slightly pause before spraying again. Your gland happily contract again, allowing more musk to rocket forward. As the second round reaches the exit, you take the liberty to moving your stench guns up and down, side to side, as you spray effectively covering the rabbit your horrid secretion. Some of it hits already soaked fur and forms globs of amber on the rabbit&#39;s fur.<br />
You pause and hold your defensive stance. You inhale deeply and notice, the smell of classic skunk was noticeable absent. There was no smell to be detected by your, in fact it smell kinda good. Confused, you close the gap between your and your target to get a closer look and  realize something.<br />
Below your awaiting rear sat a pile of oily yellow fur. What used to be pristine white fur, was now matted a bright slick yellow. Glancing over to the boy, you realized something. He was gagging and dry heaving. The skunk stench was there alright. What others smelled as the most vile stench (similar to that of a full dumpster behind a meat market on a hot summer day, mixed with a blended landfill, all topped off with the most horrendous smell of liquid shit and cooked fully loaded diapers) to you, it smelt like nothing. You were immune to the effects of your spray. <br />
You glance back down at the bunny. The now blinded bunny, violently scratched at his face in an effort to remove the cloying liquid to no avail. You reach and touch the blinded bunny, and your spray quickly transfers to your furry hand, soaking into your black fur as the oils easily move across your fur. Your spray was extremely runny and easy to move, but hard to get rid of. A smirk came again as you remember that this was your new ability. You had the control.<br />
You glance over at the boy, who regained his composure after your foul display. He looked pleased. There was more that he wanted to see and you were willing to show him.</p>
