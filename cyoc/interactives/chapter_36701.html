<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Shit!&quot; Andrew muttered. These two apparent druggies were becoming victims of his ill-phrased wish. The mustached biker had a growing dark spot forming around the bulge in his jeans and the wiry black dude's pants looked ready to burst with the size and strength of his rod. They both advanced slowly toward Andrew breathing heavily, sweating, and groping themselves. <br />
<br />
Andrew's eyes were wide with fear. This was not what he had meant! He had never actually thought the machine would work. He quickly decided not to think about that now. In a situation like this, it was best to remain in the present. And presently, his own dick had roused to its full 5 and 3/8ths inches (he had recently measured). But, as uncomfortable as having a boner can be, Andrew seemed to be getting steadily more uncomfortable. A quick glance down revealed to him that his dick was definitely growing. He could feel each beat of his heart sending more of his fiery hot blood to his crotch. His body knew that it's needs were about to be serviced and it was fast preparing. It would be so easy and feel SO good to let these two eager and willing--<br />
<br />
Andrew pinched himself in order to regain some control. 'Thank God that worked,' he thought. 'Well, almost.' His dick was pushing and pushing hard against the confines of his pants and boxers. It was only a matter of time before they could no longer contain his monster. He didn't know what to do. He needed to somehow either reverse or alter this wish, but the two men were between him and the wishing machine. He could probably get past or disable one of them but not two. He was really nervous and REALLY horny, so he was pouring sweat. His T-shirt was soaked through. He lifted his hand subconsciously to wipe the sweat from his brow, but doing so also gave him a powerful whiff of the stank from his pits. And then he remembered: it had been his smell that had turned these guys on...<br />
<br />
Andrew pulled off his soaking, clingy shirt and sized up the ever nearer men. The black guy looked tough, but he was around Andrew's height and pretty skinny. The mustached biker had a good six inches and at least a hundred pounds on him. 'Well,' he though as he balled up his sweaty shirt, 'here goes nothing.'   <br />
<br />
Andrew threw his shirt into the face of the mustached dude. At first, the guy tried to catch it or remove it, but as he took a deep breath, he fell to his knees and clawed at his crotch. With a loud moan, it became very obvious that he had just jizzed the hardest of his life right in his pants. He then lay on the floor, shirt still covering his face and giving intermittent sighs and groans of contentment. <br />
<br />
The black dude barely paused to notice what had happened. Just as he was about to reach Andrew and do...Andrew didn't want to think about it. Instead, he mustered his courage, pulled back and punched the guy dead in the face. The guy barely reacted to the punch except for the fact that it sent him sailing into the opposite wall. Andrew stood stunned. He looked at his fist and noticed that it looked bigger than it used to. Not only that, but his forearm was pretty thick and had what seemed to be cord running down it. He was brought, once again to the present by the movement and noise of the black guy on the ground across the room. He was stunned, but not out. <br />
<br />
Andrew moved as quickly as he could, given his present state, to the wishing machine. He had a quarter ready in his hand and dropped it in the slot...and just missed the magician's mouth. &quot;Dammit!&quot; he cried out. He reached into his pocket for more change just as someone grabbed his shoulders and spun him around. It was the black guy, now inches away from him with a deep lust burning in his eyes. Andrew looked down and saw that the guy's pants had broken open and his cock was straining against the waistband of his boxer-briefs. <br />
<br />
Andrew dug his hand further into his pocket, hoping to find a quarter with enough time to get this guy away from him and fix this wish. But, by moving his hand farther into his pants, he accidentally brushed his throbbing dick. In response, Andrew felt a tremendous shudder of pleasure and his penis swelled much larger, bursting from his pants and boxers and knocking the black guy in the chest. That, however, was not what caused him to fall backward. Moments ago, Andrew had used his sweaty, smelly T-shirt to bring the other guy to climax and thus disable him. The smell that roiled up from his crotch was at least ten times stronger and the black dude got the full brunt of it. His ejaculation was so strong and violent that he fell backward and his entire front, face and all, was covered with his jizz. <br />
<br />
Andrew, breathing heavily out of fear and erotica, turned quickly back to the wishing machine, desperate to correct his error. He dropped his last quarter into the slot and...</p>
