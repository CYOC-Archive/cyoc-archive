<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The group had arrived at the motel but knew that a large group such as themselves would more than likely be suspicious asking to see a certain room. They looked towards the lobby and saw a woman who looked to be in her late sixties with a cigarette in one hand and a can of beer sitting nearby.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect, how the hell are we supposed to get past her?&quot; Tanya asked as everyone now looked at her without saying anything and Tanya looked back and realized what they were looking to her to and sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I&#39;ll go in with you and I&#39;ll make her younger and you can...politely ask her for the key to Kane&#39;s room.&quot; Nat said as she pulled Tanya into the hotel lobby.<br />
<br />
&quot;For fuck&#39;s sake, what the shit do you want?&quot; The woman rudely asked, sounding like she had smoked for most of her life.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh....well, I wanted a room, but maybe I won&#39;t rent a room from a beautiful woman like you if you&#39;re being rude.&quot; Tanya said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah? Go ahead and kiss my....wait, did you just call me...beautiful?&quot; The woman said obviously surprised by the compliment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, I think any woman can be beautiful. But maybe smoking isn&#39;t the best thing for you. You could always stop, just put the cigarette down and see how beautiful you can look without it, once the cigarette is down.&quot; Tanya said in code to Nat obviously meaning for her to regress her a little once the cigarette was put out.<br />
<br />
The woman put out the cigarette and Nat regressed her slowly as her hair color brightened back up to a more vibrant brunette color that it had once been.<br />
<br />
&quot;There, I think you look better now, and maybe if you quit drinking alcohol, you&#39;ll find drinks like milk, juice, or a little bit of soda are a much better option.&quot; Tanya suggested as the woman dumped out the beer bottle into the trash and Nat now regressed her to the point where her skin was smooth again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Much better, now for the final touch, I want you to think of yourself as beautiful as you believe you are on the inside.&quot; Tanya suggested now.<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds like....&quot; The hotel clerk began to say before Tanya shushed her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, you&#39;ve been doing great, now I just want you to close your eyes and take a deep breath.&quot; Tanya asked as the hotel clerk did just as so and took a deep breath.<br />
<br />
Nat reduced her back into at least her mid thirties and adjusted her reality so she wouldn&#39;t be so shocked. Tanya and Nat were a little surprised at how well endowed this woman was at thirty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, now open your eyes and see.&quot; Tanya said holding up a compact mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, I look....I look...&quot; The hotel clerk tried to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gorgeous, now, my daughter and I have a relative who&#39;s staying here. He&#39;s got long hair with a mustache, seen him?&quot; Tanya asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah. Creepy guy, he&#39;s a relative of yours?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In a way, yes.&quot; Tanya said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I can give you my spare key to the room he rented. But don&#39;t tell anyone I did this.&quot; The hotel clerk woman said handing Tanya the spare key.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, beautiful and sweet dreams.&quot; Tanya said planting a kiss on the hotel clerk woman&#39;s lips as she fell asleep.<br />
<br />
Tanya and Nat directed the rest of the group around the motel and ended up at the motel room door, luckily it happened to be on the first floor. Akira got in front of everyone and opened the door first, everyone readied behind him expecting to find Kane there, but instead all they found was much worse, they discovered the room a mess, with some blood on the walls and dirt on the floor. They expected to Kane, the dead succubus women, or nothing at all, but they did find one woman in her succubus form tied up on a bed with gag over her mouth and trying to break free.<br />
<br />
Akira came over to the frightened succubus woman and untied the gag around her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;STAY AWAY! YOU&#39;RE WITH HIM, AREN&#39;T YOU?! DON&#39;T HURT ME, PLEASE DON&#39;T!&quot; The succubus woman shouted in fright. Akira covered her mouth to keep her from shouting.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re not here to hurt you, we&#39;re here to help you.&quot; Akira said as the woman continued to struggle away from Akira biting his hand and struggling to break the locks.<br />
<br />
&quot;BELLA SENT US!&quot; Sylvia immediately said hoping to calm this woman. The woman for a moment stopped struggling and looked at them.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re....you&#39;re lying, he told you to tell me that.&quot; The woman said still unconvinced.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, it&#39;s the truth. She...passed along something to help in case we ran into him.&quot; Tanya said as she shifted into her succubus form. The woman stopped struggling as Akira helped undo her handcuffs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bella...really did send you?&quot; The woman asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, she was worried about you and your friend. She thought passing along her succubus powers to me would help should I encounter him. Now, are you Trixie or Scarlet?&quot; Tanya asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Scarlet. Trixie....Trixie&#39;s dead. He made me watch as he killed her.&quot; Scarlet said as she couldn&#39;t hold her tears any longer and cried in Tanya&#39;s arms feeling a small kinship with this succubus woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;That psychopath. He can&#39;t stop ruining the lives of families, now he takes people&#39;s friends away too.&quot; Nat said.<br />
<br />
&quot;He...he kept me alive, because he had a message he wanted to pass along to you all.&quot; Scarlet said as she grabbed a nearby phone off the nightstand and press play.<br />
<br />
****************************************************<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, you don&#39;t have to do this, we&#39;re just trying to live normal lives.&quot; Trixie could be heard saying in the video.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but you ain&#39;t normal in the slightest, are you? you seductive skank.&quot; Ezekiel Kane said as she slapped her so hard on the face she began bleeding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please....please....I just want to go home.&quot; Trixie said as she began crying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Home? Home is a funny word, ain&#39;t it? Home is meant to be a place of loyalty and trust. None of my family were loyal and trusted me with what needed to be done. This world needs to be cleansed of supernatural filth like you. And you little brats that are watching. Yeah, I figured you would somehow end up here, so I&#39;m leaving this dump behind. But I&#39;m willing to talk if you want to listen, but here&#39;s the thing. I&#39;ll only talk with two of you. No magic bullshit at all or anyone associated with powers so that means I want to talk with the Moreland boy and your powerless little friend of...mixed heritage. I&#39;d use my own word for how I&#39;d really describe him, but I&#39;m trying to be civilized.&quot; Ezekiel Kane said as he sat the camera phone on the night stand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now I&#39;m gonna give you a choice, Trixie, wasn&#39;t it? You get to decide who lives. You or your friend, Scarlet here. The other well you can guess.<br />
<br />
&quot;Scarlet, Scarlet lives.&quot; Trixie said as she began shedding tears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Trixie, no, no, don&#39;t do this.&quot; Scarlet pleaded to her friend as Kane put a gag over Scarlet&#39;s mouth<br />
<br />
&quot;The day after you find this phone, meet me at the nearest location where the first hunters here used to meet Moreland. Ask your parents about it. Just so you know I won&#39;t do anything if it&#39;s just you and your powerless friend.&quot; Ezkiel then cut his palm drawing blood from it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Old hunter promise, I&#39;ve shed blood so no blood will be shed at the rendezvous.&quot; Ezekiel Kane said as he smeared blood on Trixie&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, getting back to you.&quot; Ezekiel calmly said as he grabbed a knife and proceeded to Trixie&#39;s body and began stabbing her.<br />
<br />
&quot;TRIXIE! TRIXIE!!!&quot; Scarlet could be heard shouting in the video through the gag<br />
<br />
***************************************************<br />
<br />
Everyone was horrified either listening to or watching the video as Scarlet wrapped herself around Tanya&#39;s body in need. Everyone now looked over at Connor as he looked confused as to what to think.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Kane has offered to speak with you and...you I presume.&quot; Akira said nodding towards Miles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Connor, what are you going to do?&quot; Spark asked in a soft concerned tone.</p>
