<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When you wake up, you are fully a German shepherd, looking around you see that you are in the back seat of a police car. In the driver seat you see the sergeant who currently is napping, giving a bark you wake him, he turns towards you smiling.<br />
<br />
“Aw, look who woke up from his nap.” He said.<br />
<br />
You give him another bark as you tail wags happily.<br />
<br />
He sighs, “I’m sorry that had to happen to you son, I never knew Rudy would do that type of thing, he looked like a promising recruit for the police force, but to do that just for his girlfriend and rob you of your place as an cadet, how selfish. But, just to let you know Rudy has been reprimanded, a new job as a K-9 cleaner is what in store for him now, and his girlfriend, apparently she didn’t know that he switched her file with yours and is very apologetic about it, even accepting her assigned job of being a K-9 for the force.” He says, “Now that that’s out of the way, let turn you back and welcome you to the ranks.”<br />
<br />
Getting out of the car, the sergeant walks to your door and opens it, hopping out of the car you see that in front of you appears to be the Police Academy. Snapping a leash on you he guides you inside where a bunch of the police seem to be looking at you, murmuring as you pass by.<br />
<br />
“Is that the one Mike?” One officer said to the sergeant.<br />
<br />
“Indeed.” The sergeant says.<br />
<br />
Looking at you the officer bends down before speaking to you, “Sorry that had to happen to you cadet.” Petting you on the head, you bark in response, happily wagging your tail and panting as everything is starting to get back on track.<br />
<br />
“Lead the way Sherry.” The sergeant asks.<br />
<br />
With a nod the officer guides you and the sergeant to a lab where one scientist is currently occupied on the computer.<br />
<br />
“Dr. Thomas.” She says but the doctor doesn’t answer, “Dr. Thomas!” She said again but the doctor is still entranced in his work, “DR. THOMAS!” She yelled, that is when the scientist finally notices.<br />
<br />
“Hm? Oh, hello Sherry, what could I do for you.” He says standing up.<br />
<br />
“Nothing for me doc, but for this guy.” She says revealing you to the doctor.<br />
<br />
“Oh? A K-9 unit? What seems to be the problem with him Sherry?” He asked.<br />
<br />
“He is actually a cadet who was turned into a dog because of a file switch up, he wasn’t actually supposed to be a K-9 unit.” The sergeant butts in.<br />
<br />
“Oh! Sergeant Mike! Hello there as well.” He says before realizing what they want from him, “So you want me to turn him back?”<br />
<br />
“Yes. The perpetrators for this has been caught and reprimanded so all that is to do is turn him back.” The sergeant says.<br />
<br />
“Hm… Well the thing is I haven’t actually made an antidote for this, I never knew this could happen.” He says.<br />
<br />
“So can you make one?” The sergeant says.<br />
<br />
“I can try. Though it may take a while.” He says.<br />
<br />
“Alright then, I’ll leave you to it.” The sergeant says to the doctor before talking to you, “I’ll be going now, you should stay put and not cause a scene alright. Thomas is here to help you.”<br />
<br />
You nod, your tail wagging behind you. The sergeant pets you before saying goodbye. Sherry leaves as well, petting you as she passes by leaving you and the scientist.<br />
<br />
“Ok. Just stay there for now. I don’t want you to get any close to my machines in case you spill something on yourself or just break it entirely.” Thomas says as he immediately gets to work on the antidote.<br />
<br />
Preparing for the wait you decide to sleep, curling into a ball you lie down and close your eyes before drifting off to sleep.<br />
<br />
——————————————<br />
A few hours later….<br />
<br />
You wake up, finding that the doctor is nudging your body. Lifting your head and looking up at him he then talks to you.<br />
<br />
“Hey… so…. I finished making the antidote for you, so if you could come with me for a bit we can see if it works…” He says.<br />
<br />
Getting up, you see the doctor walk back to his table to get what you think is the antidote before leading you into another room of the lab. The inside looks clean, sanitized, and white. A typical operating table is in the middle of the room as well as the bright lamp hanging over it that glares at whoever is under it.<br />
<br />
“Cmon, up!” The scientist says, you do as your told and hopped onto the table, “Alright, if my calculations are correct then if injected with this formula then the serum in your body will reset and hopefully turn you back into a human.”<br />
<br />
Using a syringe he injects the antidote into you, “There. Now let’s see what kind of result we will get.” He says.<br />
<br />
After a few moments from when the antidote entered your body you could feel it start to take effect as your body starting to grow until it was back to human size. Soon your spine cracks as it starts to straighten up as you take a more human position, your hind legs stay the same only that it is the size of an average human’s leg and allows you to walk upright again. Your forepaws changes, reverting back to arms but still maintaining its dog traits, before finally snapping your neck back to a human position.<br />
<br />
Looking at yourself, you are in shock with what happened to you, appearing to be an anthropomorphic dog, a dog-man. Looking at the scientist you start to growl as you get off the table and walk towards him.<br />
<br />
“What….did…you…do…to…ME!” You snarl.<br />
<br />
“L-looks like the antidote was defective…” He says.<br />
<br />
“You THINK!” You say, “Change me back to a human now!”<br />
<br />
“I’m afraid that’s not possible…” He says.<br />
<br />
“Why not?” You growl.<br />
<br />
“Hehe, eh, you see I made the antidote so that you won’t get transformed again, so I’m afraid that that’s your body from now on…”<br />
<br />
“WHAT!” You say, “I-I can’t be like this! What would everyone think of me? I’m literally a dog/human hybrid!”<br />
<br />
“Please calm down.” Thomas says, “Look, I know how this situation got a bit messy but I think it will work out for you.”<br />
<br />
“And how will that work out exactly?” You growl but quite a bit softer now.<br />
<br />
“You got the best of both worlds. And I’m pretty sure your one of a kind as well. Maybe you’ll be the first generation to both be a cadet and a K-9 unit.” He says.<br />
<br />
“Hm…” You thought, “Maybe this is a blessing in disguise.”<br />
<br />
“Find me some clothes.” You say.<br />
<br />
“Alright. I think the sergeant left you with some clothes.” He says before exiting.<br />
<br />
You wonder what’s in store for you, life at the academy might be more interesting now that type became a dog-man. What will others think of you.<br />
This is where the adventure begins.</p>
