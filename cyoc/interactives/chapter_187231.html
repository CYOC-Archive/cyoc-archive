<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After daddy had left the room, I started eating the pancakes he did for me as I checked my HUD once more. First, I stopped at Jake, deciding to better improve his daddy skills and change a few things. I started with his personality traits first, remembering the ones that he had by default in case things got too weird or the system failed me. It hadn&#39;t until now but you never knew.<br />
<br />
I only had a limited amount of slots to fill, so I knew I had to be careful. I started first adding the &#39;Family Centered&#39; trait, which would make all his main goals to be around family and its well-being. Then, I added the &#39;very dominant&#39; trait, changing his personality to not only a very extroverted one, but also where he enforced his wishes on others if he deemed so. Finally, I added the &#39;Romantic Incest&#39; trait, allowing him to have sex or romantic relationships with his family members without affecting his morals or any of that sort. There were other trait slots I could add, but those were still grayed out, meaning I couldn&#39;t use them just yet, though I couldn&#39;t wait until I could add more.<br />
<br />
Then, I started to change his physique. Though, in order to do so productively, first I had to undress him, making me impressed to what I was seeing. He, aparrently, had something like a 5 incher soft. It wasn&#39;t exactly big by normal standards, but it was still bigger than mine originally. First, I started changing his height, just like I did but in reverse, making the slider go up all the way to 8 feet tall. &quot;Fuck, he&#39;s going to be massive&quot; I thought as I then changed his muscle mass, increasing his muscles over all of his body all at the same time. There were some archetypes I could choose to make his build look similar to, so I picked the bodybuilder one and then moved the slider all the way to the maximum.<br />
<br />
He now was looking like the biggest man on earth. Not only was he the tallest man but also probably one of the widest ones. His neck was thick as a bull&#39;s and his shoulders and lats had grown so big to make room for his bulldozer arms that I knew he wouldn&#39;t fit through any of the doors in our house. His pecs were like titanic slabs of meat ballooning in front of him like shelves sticking out of his body. Both, seemed to be held by his big muscle gut, which no matter what clothes he wore on top, failed to hide the bricks he had as abs, each one stacked on top of the other, like a wall. You would think his waist was thick, but it was actually pretty tight despite the gut, specially once you noticed the sheer thickness of his titanic quads and the roundness of his giant glutes. His tree-trunk like legs were so big that I knew that if I sat on his lap I wouldn&#39;t be able to touch the seat with my feet even if I wanted to. Then, there was his massive calves, so thick with power you would think he could easily jump into and from a building without problem. Finally, my eyes stared at his massive feet, which I made even thicker just to make sure he didn&#39;t have a funny walk. <br />
<br />
I was in awe, and that was considering that I was only seeing a representation of how it was going to end up looking, not the real thing. I gulped as I continued to add some small details. I tied his hair into a short younger look and just more... tidy. Then I continued with the beard, making sure it wasn&#39;t a wild one, but a really nice stubble. Then I added the body hair, I wanted him to be the prime example of an alpha bear, so I added a thick pelt of body hair from the neck down, taking special consideration on his legs, forearms and chest. Finally, I continued with the most important part, I changed his penis and made it grow from 5 inches soft to 13, one that would grow into a massive 18 inches monster. I also made sure to make it very thick, enough so even his big ass hand would struggle to close around it. Once my titan of a dad was ready, I gulped and saved the changes I had done. <br />
<br />
Then, with a sudden loud clang, I heard something made out of metal hit the floor in the kitchen. Nervous about what I was going to find, I left my bed with some effort, now my shoulders being the same height as the mattress. Slowly, I got closer to the door and opened it, peaking from behind it to see what was going on. To my amazement, my eyes landed on what could only described as a hulking figure on his knees as it picked the pan that had just hit the floor. <br />
<br />
Jake had turned into the biggest man to ever walk the planet. He was wearing a white tight tank top that did little to hide his massive musculature, his lats flaring to the side, showing his huge hairy shoulders and arms, his back so wide and full of muscles you could easily mistake it for a landscape. His powerful legs and glutes holding his whole massive frame as I kept on staring. He was wearing a pair of shorts that only reached to the middle of his thighs, so I could see his bulked up hairy legs move as he accomodated himself in front of the kitchen sink. His ass was so big I could literally see how each glute was probably as big as I was.<br />
<br />
&quot;D-dad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry my baby boy, did papa scare you? I was just doing the dishes when I felt this weird tingling, but it seems I&#39;m fine. I don&#39;t have a rash in my back, do I?&quot;<br />
<br />
I gulped at his question as I started to get closer to him, each step making me more aware of how easily he towered over me, even though he was in his knees. That&#39;s when I noticed the crack on the ceiling, he must have hit his head with the rapid growth, and also made me realize why he was on his knees. He couldn&#39;t actually just stand fully on our petit apartment. &quot;T-there&#39;s no rash that I can see&quot; I replied once I got closer, his massive ass moving to the rhythm of his movements.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, great then. You okay there my little one? I&#39;m about finished here, want to spend some time with papa bear?&quot; He asked as he finished to clean the pan that had been on the floor a couple of moments ago.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; I answered without hesitation as I stopped myself from drooling, running towards my now refurbished old couch. It was kind of strange to think that now, basically everything I had worked for wasn&#39;t mine, it was my dad&#39;s, but when my eyes landed on him and the changes I had done, I couldn&#39;t help but feel a sense of excitement and a bit of fear. The sensation was so new and out of this world that half of me kind of expected to wake up at any moment, but since it hadn&#39;t happened just yet, I was just going to enjoy the ride. <br />
<br />
As I climbed onto the couch, waiting for daddy, I noticed that two of the three sections of it had massive curves, as if two extremely people had sat on them, but as my eyes posed on my dad&#39;s ass again, I realized it was probably the shape he left after sitting there. Excited, I sat where his right cheek would have been, finding strange confort in doing so. Then, on my excitement for changing my life, I went back to the system and decided to change once and for all our economic situation. I made the number jump from two grand, to a whooping 80 million. As I did so, I felt the place shake as my daddy was now standing, barely of course, and walking in massive strides of his huge feet towards me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Up we go, little one&quot; He said as he grabed me carefully with both hands, both of wich were massive with fingers maybe as thick as my wrists. I knew he could have lifted me with just one, but he seemed to tread carefully as he raised me into the air and in a quick motion let his massive behind fall onto the seat that was my former couch. As he did so, however, I was able to hear a crack and a little rumble as the whole thing collapsed under his new massive weight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oops, haha, I guess there it goes another one.&quot; He said with a slight chuckle of his handsome face as he got comfortable. Then, he got me close to his massive pecs, making me sit on top of his muscle gut and cradling me against his hairy chest. His giant arm surrounding me protectively as he held me, his eyes staring me with a smile. I could tell he had his undivided attention on me. &quot;Hi, little one, confy there?&quot; He asked with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes daddy, very confy.&quot; I replied with a smile of my own as I looked up to him, my arms exploring the vastness of his massive left pec. I couldn&#39;t help but notice how warm he was and the fuzzy feeling of his chest hair just made me more excited. Excited so, that before I even realized, I had sprung an erection that I was trying to hide under his shelf of muscles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hahaha, I see my puppy is excited to be with papa.&quot; He said as I felt his middle finger go all the way around my crotch, caressing my balls little penis. Then, I heard a loud sound similar to fabric being ripped, noticing how my dad&#39;s other huge hand moved to something behind me. Of course, I looked over my shoulder to see the magnificence of my dad&#39;s massive cock displayed before me in full erection as his hand started to jerk it off. &quot;As you can see, papa is also very excited. I missed this, having some time with my little boy.&quot; He said as he stroked his cock up and down, slowly. Apparently, his underwear and shorts just exploded once daddy had his powerful erection since they couldn&#39;t hold it anymore. <br />
<br />
I couldn&#39;t hold it any longer. Just being craddled by this titanic man was enough for me to make me blow all over him, though despite the fact that it looked like a big stain to me, I felt everything rumble as I noticed daddy was chuckling a little, his kind eyes, however, were stuck on me, never leaving his eye sight, not one moment despite being half occupied with his own monster. Then, the hand that han been just a second ago jerking him off moved to the little splash of cum I had left on his tank top, his thick index finger trying to take most right before he took it to his mouth, as if it was just a bit of spilled ice-cream.  &quot;You&#39;re so cute, my little one.&quot; He said as he tasted the flavour of my own cum, the arm holding me pushing me further against his massive body, hairy pecs like mountains spilling over my sides as I snuggled in the crevice that was his huge chest. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now is daddy&#39;s turn.&quot; He voiced as his hand went back to his huge cock and started to jerk off furiously, his head tilted to the back as he enjoyed the sensation. I could hear him grunting in pleasure whenever I cuddled my head against his massive chest or carresed the hairy landscape. &quot;FUUUUCK, I love you my little boy, I love you so much.&quot; He continued, now even faster as his hand moved up and down, his voice, however seemed strained as if he was ready to burst. I couldn&#39;t handle it either and I came again right on top of the hand that was holding me, splashing his thick finger with the little juice I could produce. &quot;I love you too, daddy.&quot; I replied in a tone of pure ecstasy.  Then, with a roar that I knew would be even heard from the first floor, my dad&#39;s cannon shot gallon after gallon, his seed shooting all the way to the ceiling and the wall opposite our living room.<br />
<br />
I was about to say something, but just as I opened my mouth, he lifted me up and kissed me on my lips tenderly. Though despite being very careful, his tongue was so big and had so much power I almost gagged at first before he found a rhythm I was able to handle. After I had been sent to heaven, my dad finished the kiss as his right hand went up all the way to behind his head, giving me a perfect show of his musky hairy armpit and the titanic size of his huge biceps. &quot;Had fun with papa?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah daddy, I loved it. Though I think we&#39;re going to need another couch.&quot; I said as I snuggled against his heaving chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you worry about that my baby boy, okay? Daddy will take care of it, besides, now that we have won the lotery we can finally see to getting a bigger house with furniture that can withstand the weight of a real man.&quot;<br />
<br />
It did make sense that he justified our new funds as being the result of winning the lotery, but the last part made me jump in excitement a little bit as he held me close to his huge body. The ceiling was still dripping with cum and I could see how the other wall was going to end up with stains, but my dad made no move whatsover with the intention of cleaning it. He just stayed there, holding me as he fumbled for the remote control.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey daddy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, little one?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How much do you weight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Close to 900 pounds, now that we can afford my suplements and bigger weights though, daddy plans to reach a 1000.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But daddy, you&#39;re huge!&quot; I said, my little dick already perked up once more<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha, there&#39;s nothing like too big, little one. You are a baby boy, so it doesn&#39;t matter, but men like me? We never stop growing.&quot; He replied with a gentle smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! I must remind you I&#39;m not a baby, I&#39;m 15&quot; I clarified, mostly so that I could check he wasn&#39;t confused or that the system broke at some point.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I know, but you&#39;re my son and no matter if you are 5, 15 or 75 you&#39;ll always be my baby. Besides, I doubt you&#39;ll grow any bigger, which is what I love the most about you.&quot; He said as he kissed me in my forehead right before turning the TV on. I don&#39;t know how he knew, but he just knew I was exhausted despite not doing much. Before long I was soon covered in a blanket, my little body resting against his huge pecs as I drifted to sleep in genuine bliss.</p>
