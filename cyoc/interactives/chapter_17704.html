<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sirens, police, firemen, and the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to animals all rounded up the three cattle loading them into one big trailer.<br />
<br />
Mooing and bellowing their thoughts, worries, and aspirations of of personal loss, Jonus and his parents were taken away. The neighbors and police had many questions and all seemed to think it was the doings of Doctor Phil.<br />
<br />
The Doc himself was surprised that for all the questions not one was asked about a house which did not stand next door to his. The basis for all the questions was on where the cattle came from and not a thought of who they belonged to, certainly not the Doc!<br />
<br />
An anxious moment gone by the board he could relax now. The worry of being discovered for what he'd done and caused to happen was over. The care for Jonus or his parents and what they lost by becoming Hereford cattle seemed to be of little consideration right then. What was on the good Doctor's mind was how he could use this wonderous book to make his life easier.<br />
<br />
Burning the late night oil he mulled over the hundreds of spells and incantations which were written inside the Tome. It was a sleepy eyed Doctor that at long last drifted off into slumber as the sun was just peeking over the eastern horizon.<br />
<br />
Not waking till late afternoon he jerked himself awake as dreams of yesterday danced the doom of his near neighbors.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Lord what have I done to them!&quot; the good doctor exclaimed.<br />
<br />
A quick and painful shave, showered, and dressed he headed for the office of the S.P.C.A. Looking and sounding just a foolish there before those who removed the cattle from off his front lawn, he begged to know where they were taken.<br />
<br />
The address learned he drove quickly out to the rural farm and made yet another foolhardy scene with one nice well meaning farmer.<br />
<br />
Shown to the pasture's gate the new bull was busy showing his worth. The mother and cow stood off to one side a good distance from her over sexed husband. A long hard look was needed to pick Jonus out of the crowd, yet he was spotted standing, grazing, and looking almost ready for market.<br />
<br />
The Doc made an offer to buy the three as long as they could be kept at the farm. A surprised and dumbfounded farmer stood listening only to turn the silly offer down flat!<br />
<br />
The fathering' bull saw the Doc and after he finished with his last conquest, he came prancing over to the gate.<br />
<br />
Bellaring his mind's question neither Farm owner, or the Doc could understand the beast's worries.<br />
<br />
Doc left them there his sense of fair play was making what little conscience he had left give his stomac a knot. He thought of going home and finding if there a spell to reverse what he'd done to two nice people and one brat of a kid.<br />
<br />
Seated at his dining room table he poored over page after page of the spells. Not a one seemed right and he was getting more and more frantic by the hour.<br />
<br />
He wanted to know what the neighbor now bull was saying to him but it would seem the only way to accomplish this was for he, himself to become a bull, if only for a short time.<br />
<br />
Looking over one spell it offered him the choice of form to become, and with it a time limit, suggesting when it came he'd change back to his ole' self. It had to work and he thought himself as ready as ever right then!<br />
<br />
Reading the spell came easy as like some odd piece of poetry the words rhymed together.<br />
<br />
Like with Jonus the face began nose and upper lip first. Then his head ached and grew larger becoming exceedingly heavy. His neck soon firmed up with massive muscles spreading down his torso and out his arms.<br />
<br />
Groaning of strange stretching sensations and not a pain to speak of, the Doc watched in wonder as the change spread. Arms became as forelegs and fingers twitched till they were as cloven hooves. He almost laughed to see his aged puny penis become enlarged and joined up unto his lower belly.<br />
<br />
Fingering his very bovine sheath with forehooves and enjoying the sensual sensation of being then a male creature made for having sex!<br />
<br />
It might have been the realization of lost dignity when his boney tail poked into existance, growing long and reminding him he was now going to be a real animal and beast.<br />
<br />
Expecting himself to be as the nieghbors became Doc was suprised to see his hair colour to be all black. Smooth thick black hair covered over a touch thickening black hide as he wondered why everything seemed different.<br />
<br />
Midnight a Black Aberdeen Angus bull pranced out the rear kitchen door of Doctor Phil little cottage home. Tail swaying with every step the sensation of it alone was enough to bring on a feeling of uforia.<br />
<br />
Memories to the distant south side farm in his mind the sights, sounds, and scents being denoted by the enhanced sensorium of such a bull's mind took president.<br />
<br />
All the questions he wanted to know the answers to were with every step being answered. Sensations of a new personal freedom filled his every thought. Doc was suddenly free of all morals, human rules, and stood a free spirit in a body made for one prime reason, sex!<br />
<br />
Instantly the desire was to locate that raw scent of others like himself. Angus, Hereford, the breed did not matter any more! He was a bull, a bovine animal with the drives known to such a creature. If he had ever considered what an animal felt like it was never thought to be like this!</p>
