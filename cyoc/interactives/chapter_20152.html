<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Steve could only stare at Peter in disbelief. He knew that Peter was the best swimmer on the team, but he wanted more dedication, discipline, and commitment. He was obsessed with getting the State Championship, and he was willing to go to great lengths to get it. He hated the thought of Peter even having anything which could remotely seem like a bit of a social life, and the thought of him doing anything else, outside of swimming laps in the pool, was absolutely revolting to him. He turned around and ran after Peter, who was still dressed in leather, while he was surrounded by three other girls from school.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Peter! Wait a minute! I’m not done with you, boy!” Steve shouted, as he ran after the tall boy.<br />
<br />
Peter was slowly walking back to the main building of the high school, when Steve had caught up to him. Steve quickly positioned himself in front of Peter and the girls. There was nobody else in the building, since it was Sunday afternoon and there were no classes that day. Only a few members of the staff were there, to take care of the building.<br />
<br />
“I’m not finished with you, boy! Where do you think you’re going?” Steve shouted to Peter.<br />
<br />
“Coach! I just spent an hour swimming laps in the pool, and I was the only one there! What more do you want me to do?” Peter asked him.<br />
<br />
“You’re my ticket to the State Title, do you hear me? If you want to be the best, then you have to work for it!” Steve shouted back.<br />
<br />
“But, Coach! Today is Sunday! I’ll be back tomorrow!”<br />
<br />
“Peter! Being the best doesn’t come on a silver plate, you know? Go back to the pool, or consider yourself off the team!” Steve shouted in reply. <br />
<br />
He wasn’t aware of the fact that Mr. Johnson, the Principal, was also in the building, and he was able to hear all the shouting, which was going on down the hall from his office. He decided to get up and take a look to see what the commotion was about.<br />
<br />
“But, Coach! I haven’t gone out in over a month. I’m in top shape, I know it! I just wanted one Sunday afternoon to go out and to have some fun…” Peter pleaded with his coach. But Steve wanted no part of it.<br />
<br />
“Fun? Life isn’t fun, boy! It’s about work, work, work!” Steve shouted back.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Allen spoke to Peter, and only Peter could hear him.<br />
<br />
“Oh no… He’s gonna start preaching a sermon again. Well, time to fix you up even a little more, while Steve is yelling his head off…” Allen laughed.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Peter felt Allen’s magic working in his body again. This time, he started to grow even a little taller, until he was now standing at about 7 feet and 7 inches tall! He was huge!<br />
<br />
Peter gasped as he looked in front of him. Steve seemed to be so much shorter. He was huge!<br />
<br />
Next, Peter felt his muscles inflate even more! He made his fists and flexed both arms, gasping at the site of his biceps slowly rising up from the top of his arms, and growing, growing, and growing… He looked like he had a set of soccer balls implanted in his arms! That’s how big has biceps had become!<br />
<br />
“Woww….. This feels soooo good…” Peter whispered to himself. The feeling of growing bigger and more muscular was the best sensation in the world to him! He closed his eyes so he could savor the moment as his body continued to grow.<br />
<br />
His arms were super thick and long pythons of layers of muscle and veins, all covered by the layer of thick, shining black leather. But, his muscles had become so huge, that the outline of his physique was still clearly visible, even underneath all that leather!<br />
<br />
His legs became long and thick, with a pair of monster calves to die for. Huge balls of thick, powerful rocks of muscle jutted out from the back of his legs. His calves were as thick as the stump of an old oak tree, with layers of muscles and veins providing strength to the legs, which would allow peter to run and jump faster, farther, and higher than any student in his school!<br />
<br />
“Whoa! I’m big and I’m all packed in leather… I feel great!” Peter thought to himself.<br />
<br />
Finally, Peter’s leather outfit changed a little, giving him that incredible “New Romantic” look. His makeup changed and became less garish. The changes were very obvious and after a few seconds, however, everything about him, including his makeup and cologne, fairly dripped, oozed, and radiated super-wealth, super-luxury, and super-extravagance!<br />
<br />
His outfit became even more impressive, as Allen allowed it to be a work of art, enriched with jewelry and objects of great value, making Peter look incredibly impressive. <br />
<br />
Allen gave him a double-breasted suit jacket, with waist-length, high-waist rave slacks with super-wide legs. He wore a very wide, patent-leather belt and a huge, oval-shaped, western-style buckle along with knee-high, patent-leather boots with 9-inch heels and 6-inch platform soles, and a white silk satin brocade poet shirt with huge sleeves and multiple layers of ruffles and lace, and a huge black satin brocade bow tie accented by a jeweled brooch in the middle of the knot! He looked fantastic! He even gained huge diamond ear studs with a fringe of smaller diamonds coming all the way down to his shoulders! He was dripping in leather and expensive jewelry!<br />
<br />
Not only that, but his outfit kept on changing, as more people started to walk up to Peter and started talking to him.<br />
<br />
Lastly, Allen changed Peter’s black Mohawk. His hair was still black, but it grew longer and longer, with a partition forming in the center of the scalp. The straight, long, black hair grew longer, until it passed his ears. Some of his hair covered his face, like a curtain. The hair came down to the bottom of the lower jaw.<br />
<br />
“Wow…” Peter said to himself. “I look awesome!”<br />
<br />
Steve was still screaming at Peter, through all the changes, and neither of them realized that Mr. Johnson had heard everything and was walking up to where they were holding their discussion.<br />
<br />
“Get into the pool, and I mean NOW! Or else, consider yourself off the team, you hear me?” Steve shouted.<br />
<br />
“But, Coach! I’ll be here tomorrow, and Tuesday, and just about every day this coming week! I’m ready for the tournament, Coach! Honest…” Peter pleaded with his coach.<br />
<br />
“If you don’t get into the pool, then I will drag you into the pool myself! You need to spend five hours per day, swimming laps! Do you hear me?”<br />
<br />
“Hold on!” Mr. Johnson said, as he walked up to the pair.<br />
<br />
Both Steve and Peter gasped, as they turned to face the man who was the short, stocky Principal of the school. <br />
<br />
“Steve, how can you subject Peter to such cruelty? You’re going to drag him into the pool? He needs to swim for five hours per day? He can’t even have a social life? You must be kidding me!” Mr. Johnson said to him.<br />
<br />
“What? These kids are lazy! They don’t want to work for it! They don’t practice enough…” Steve replied.<br />
<br />
“Steve: This is a school, not a concentration camp! And, I’ve seen Peter’s grades and I know that he spends a lot of time practicing for the swim team. You can’t have a more dedicated swimmer. I can’t believe you want to take him off the team! Not only that, but I’m very impressed that he even showed up to practice on a Sunday afternoon. And you want to take him off the team? May I suggest you take some time off from coaching, Steve… You’re pushing these kids too hard…”<br />
<br />
“What?” Steve replied in shock. “No! I’m not taking time off! I want these kids in the pool for 5 hours per day!”<br />
<br />
“Steve… I want you to take some time off from coaching the swim team. You are on leave, effective immediately!” Mr. Johnson said.<br />
<br />
“No, I don’t accept that!” Steve shouted back.<br />
<br />
“Fine! You’re fired!”<br />
<br />
For the moment, there was a deep silence in the hallway, where the 2 staff members and the tall student were standing. Peter and the girls were just tired of all the arguing and they wanted to get away from it all!<br />
<br />
“FINE!” Steve shouted, as he turned to the main doors, and marched out of the building.<br />
<br />
Mr. Johnson then turned towards the tall, muscular boy, who was completely dressed in thick, black leather.<br />
<br />
“So… You changed your look, huh, Peter? Very impressive…” Mr. Johnson said, as he stared at the muscular boy, who stood almost two feet taller than him.<br />
<br />
“Yes, sir… I guess you can say that…” Peter chuckled shyly.<br />
<br />
“I think our coach has gotten a bit too carried away… He can’t demand for you to give up your social life and to dedicate every waking minute to swimming in the pool. That is cruel and insensitive. I will assign a new coach for the swim team, is that understood?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, sir…” Peter replied politely.<br />
<br />
“Today is Sunday. I don’t mind you wearing all that leather. Just don’t wear it in class, okay?”<br />
<br />
“I won’t wear this in class, sir…”<br />
<br />
“Very well. Carry on…” Mr. Johnson said, as he turned around and walked back to his office.<br />
<br />
Peter took his three girls and strolled out the large, double doors at the end of the hallway, which took him to the large parking lot behind the school.<br />
<br />
When he just left the building, he spotted Allen, Ty, Dustin and Kent, as they were walking to the school.<br />
<br />
“Wow! Look at Peter!” Kent exclaimed, as he caught his first glimpse of the glam-rocker version of Peter.<br />
<br />
Just when Ty, Kent, Dustin and Allen had joined Peter, five other girls came walking down the sidewalk. They immediately headed for where Peter was standing. Peter was easy to spot, since he was completely dressed in leather, and he was the tallest and the most muscular guy in the whole parking lot.<br />
<br />
“Watch this…” Allen whispered to Kent and Ty. “As more girls walk up to him, the bigger he becomes! His suit also changes and he becomes more glamorous!”<br />
<br />
The gang noticed more changes, since Peter was now surrounded by eight girls, who all wanted to talk to him! Peter slowly became stronger and more muscular, and his outfit was growing richer and fancier! He resembled what could be called a teenage king--or emperor--or rock-and-roll sultan--with a harem to match! As more girls began to talk to him, more and more rows of diamonds were added to his earrings! He was an incredible site! His whole outfit was fairly dripping with gold, silver, platinum, and precious stones--even his makeup! His leather boots became crotch-high, and his 9-inch heels and 6-inch platform soles grew higher and higher as the outfit became more extravagant. Even the layers of ruffles and lace had increased! <br />
<br />
The more girls came after him, the more muscular Peter became, the fancier his outfit got, the handsomer and sexier he became, and the wealthier he had become, until he finally was the richest, sexiest, most super-muscular teen on the planet!<br />
<br />
“Hey, I want to look just as fancy as Peter!” Kent said to Ty.<br />
<br />
“That can be arranged!” Ty said with a grin.<br />
<br />
“I would love to be a glam-rocking cowboy!” Kent said to his friend. “Could you change me into that?”<br />
<br />
Ty nodded, with a grin on his face.<br />
<br />
Allen and Ty weren’t about to let Peter have all the fun and the fancy clothing on his own!<br />
<br />
What were Allen and Ty going to do next?</p>
