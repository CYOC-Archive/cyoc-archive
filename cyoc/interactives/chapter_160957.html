<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Meanwhile, back home, the Chronivac had a slight error popup. It was a minor glitch that this version had occasionally where it just needed a manual input to resolve, but no one was around to fix it. After a few minutes, it had to quickly reset, without saving too many details. Then, it immediately turned back on, attempting to restore the previous changes. Unfortunately, it took the reality change even further.<br />
<br />
Back in the car, Jenny happily listened to the radio while her two besties chatted up front. Although she didn&#39;t want to cheat on Jeff, it did feel a little fun to be technically single again. Part of her even wondered if it was cheating... after all, Jeff didn&#39;t exist in this reality. He was just her pussy. She placed her hand on her vagina again for a minute before giggling to herself and looking back out the window, seriously debating what to do later.<br />
<br />
Jeff continued to make motions much to Jenny’s delight. She looked over at her friends<br />
She then got the idea to test her friends’ memory. “Hey, do any of you guys remember Jeff?”<br />
<br />
“No, who’s that?” Brittany replied.<br />
<br />
“Oh, he’s an old friend, not someone you would know.” she told her, turned on by her soul knowledge of Jeff’s existence. <br />
<br />
When they arrived at the party all of Jenny’s friends spread out, except Brittany. She began pulling Jenny by the arm “C’mon you have got to meet Rick. He is so hot.” Jenny reluctantly followed still not being entirely comfortable with the idea of seeing someone while Jeff was a part of her. When they finally reached Rick, standing around talking to his friends, Jenny was impressed to say the least.<br />
<br />
Jenny didn’t want to approach first, so Brittany did, “Hey Rick, I want you to meet my friend Jenny.”<br />
<br />
“Um hi.” Jenny said shyly. Jeff started moving vigorously to try to stop her, buy that only turned her on even more. <br />
<br />
“Now what’s a girl like you doing in a shitty place like this?” Rick began talking to her. The two talk for an hour with Rick making advances on her, and Jenny only opened up more.<br />
<br />
Fluids began dripping out of Jeff. He tried to move, but that only made her hornier.<br />
<br />
The Chronivac, still sitting in her room, whirled to life. The users were reset, and it could no longer distinguish Jenny as a user who did not have her memory wiped of Jeff. The device determined that Jenny should forget about Jeff and that Jeff should be changed to fit his new environment. As Jenny talked to Rick the changes began.<br />
<br />
Under her dress, her pubic hairs got darker, and retracted to the length she normally kept them at. Jeff’s squirming died down until he was motionless. Jeff was now physically identical to Jenny’s original vagina. Jenny’s last few memories of Jeff and her use of the Chronivac left her mind. <br />
<br />
Jeff screamed silently to Jenny, anything to get her attention. Alas, she heard nothing. After all, a vagina couldn’t talk or move. His existence was now completely erased from reality and the only person who knew about the Chronivac had forgotten he existed.<br />
<br />
Jenny and Rick’s talking turned into flirting, which turned into teasing. While they were packed into a tiny room with several other people, Rick took the opportunity to start fingering Jenny, and Jenny made no move to stop him. “You little slut” he whispered to her when he found her not wearing panties. Jenny felt an orgasm coming on. Her moans were muffled by the loud music and crowd of people.<br />
Jeff felt like he had just had the sex of a lifetime. That had been like a full body massage, but it his whole body was his penis. He couldn’t believe that was what just fingering felt like.<br />
<br />
“Let’s take this back to my place” Jenny yelled. The two could barely keep their hand off each other as they escaped the crowd. To Jenny’s dismay, they bumped into Brittany on the way out.<br />
<br />
“Oh, hey Jenny. Leaving already?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, Rick will drive me home.” Jenny said as she shuffle towards the door, clearly wanting to skip the conversation.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I see how it is. You two have fun.” Brittany said “Oh wait, who was that Jeff guy you mentioned earlier?”<br />
<br />
Jenny searched her memory, she could recall mentioning him in the car, but not who he was. “I don’t remember” she replied “must not have been important”<br />
<br />
Rick and Jenny left the party and headed back to her place. They made it to her room without bumping into her family. Rick sat on the bed and pulled out his rock-hard cock. Jenny did not hesitate to straddle him. He went balls deep in one swift motion.<br />
<br />
Jeff felt like he was choking as she bounced up and down, but he couldn’t help wanting more. The pleasure was so intense, he felt like his entire body was as sensitive as the head of his penis once was. <br />
<br />
Jenny and Rick went at it for hours until the two of them collapsed late at night. Jeff began contemplating what he would do when the transformation was over. Would he do the same transformation but for a longer time? Take Rick out of the picture? Give Jenny a transformation for herself? Or go for a whole new change? It then dawned on him that Jenny had no memory of using the Chronivac on him earlier, so she might start changing people tomorrow.</p>
