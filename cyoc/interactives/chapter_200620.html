<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;W...well, of course I do want to change back. I&#39;ve just got hook up with a nice looking girlfriend. I can&#39;t imagine if she&#39;ll still ever want to be with me, when I basically look... like this...&quot; The rabbit says, looking over his small, plump, furry form.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t argue with that. alright, what should we do for now?&quot; You ask, looking apprehensively around the room as the rabbit ponders for a moment, before coming up with an idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... there&#39;s two of us, right? if so, then How many mirrors do you think are in here, at least 500?&quot; the rabbit asked as You see row after row of wall after wall full of mirrors.<br />
<br />
&quot;after for what I&#39;ve seen here, I think there&#39;s Probably more than what you think there are. why do you ask?&quot; You say. thinking about it when you even notice and saw a stairway off in the corner.<br />
<br />
&quot;listen to me for a minute, what I&#39;m trying to say is that there are now two of us here. that means we can check all the mirrors in double the time! with any luck, There has to be at least one somewhere here that can change us back.&quot; the rabbit said while moving around with a little bit of excitedly in your pouch as this was making you blush, before realizing it and settling back down sheepishly that you knew the rabbit did make a good point about looking for it together for it will double their chances with some odds on finding it.<br />
<br />
For the moment though as you look down at the rabbit, still in your pouch below you that you then turn to look into the kangaroo mirror again. admiring your beauty that you felt a strange feeling for the rabbit to stay in your pouch some more that you soon told the rabbit about it as you were willing to help out on what the rabbit had just planed, what ever it takes. &quot;you do make a good point about one, but there are some risks. we could be change into something too small for us to ever see the the mirrors, let alone about Either one of us could even lose our minds into the new forms as we&#39;ll forget that we&#39;re ever human...&quot; you begin to say while taking a breather, before speaking up and from where you left off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look! I&#39;m pretty sure you don&#39;t want to be in a body of this rabbit form you got there forever, as mush as I don&#39;t want to be stuck in this body and be screwed around of being a kangaroo with a pouch for a young joey to carry around in. the way you are doing to me is kind of feels like you are a joey in my pouch as a part of me now doesn&#39;t want to let you out.&quot; you said as it made you blush by just saying it while lowering your ears back in shame, tilting your head down to it for you were also looking away from the rabbit.<br />
<br />
&quot;s, sorry on saying it. I&#39;m...not sure how I feel yet, but I can definitely try and help you in any way possible as of to change back.&quot; you said finally as the rabbit wiggled his tail with excitement, tickling the inside of your pouch that you couldn&#39;t take him being in there anymore. Before you lowered yourself to let him out of your pouch however, you involuntarily swivel to the right again as you shortly after heard heavy footfalls while your rabbit friend noticed this to. Someone else was entering the hall of mirrors in here, and it sounded like who it was didn&#39;t come alone ether.<br />
<br />
You thought to just lay there on the floor with your rabbit friend and feel the untapped strength run through yourselves, but you&#39;ve instead of doing this and letting them see you both for them to bounce and flee out of here that your new instincts told you to try something interesting as you were careful this time around. Being careful as to not look into any of the mirrors that you careen behind a wall, and waited for it didn&#39;t take long though when a few moments later is where came a pair of nice twentysomething year old people. like you with the rabbit is where they found themselves entering and looking around excitedly as one was wearing a brown merino wool sweeter with black knee high boots to his blue jeans while his friend shocked you with fear for this person is someone that you know from your class.<br />
<br />
Of all the places to run into your friend who&#39;s in your class, why did it had to be here of all days?! Seeing him in his blue shirt with a yellow crown print on it to his white vest as he was wearing a 1980&#39;s black leather jeans to his brown steel cowboy boots, with his forearms covered in his purple sleeve warmers that were patterned in black stripped while wearing a pair of black studded wristbands. even though you teased him of his sleeves by calling them kitten warmers that he gets mad about it and yells out by saying they&#39;re the tiger sleeves as you were about to reach up and give the old one two hit job on both of them with the rabbit&#39;s help, but stopped yourself when your thoughts breaks through your haze once more for these were your thoughts.<br />
<br />
&#39;No, Not again. Not to my class mate. I don&#39;t want him to suffer an endless transformation the way we have. I don&#39;t care about the guy he&#39;s with, but not him. Still, I better be a nicer beast and do what must be done. Gatta scare them out of here, before they look into any of these mirrors. If I&#39;m going to do it... I got to do it now, and fast.&#39;<br />
<br />
Thankfully, you&#39;ve noticed that they haven&#39;t looked into any of the mirrors just yet as they seem to be doing well while one was preoccupied of hanging onto his friend who looked like he was ready to have one to many drinks of a hangover for the day and pass out. Quickly, you hopped just inches behind them as your rabbit friend in the pouch gave a soft squeaking sound for them to looked up behind them that you shortly after gave a low grunt. Soon after as they see you, a kangaroo with a rabbit in your pouch that they took a step back is when one of them started to mumble about you being someone in a suit character with a cute fuzzy rabbit in the pouch while seeing you standing just inches away from them for the other was stun out of this to know what&#39;sgoing on here.<br />
<br />
You were standing taller then them as you&#39;ve both squeaked and grunt again for you were about to use your massive feets to kick them off their own that even the rabbit showed off a few moves too, but stopped yourself when they shortly were yelling out for they turned tailed and run away. However, they were running down the wrong direction as they were heading back over towards the mirrors. You watched them run as you thought that they would accidentally look into a different mirror, thus this would probably change them both into something much worse than what they would be now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Run! Someone&#39;s trying to hurt us! Help!&quot; One says out in a state of panic that you hopped in frustration, again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, boy. &#39;Sigh!&#39; here were go again.&quot; You said, shortly giving chase as the rabbit was soon out of your pouch for the chase too that you were trying to corral them up towards the exit, while being careful of not to look into at any of the mirrors. However, it didn&#39;t work out like you&#39;ve planned.<br />
<br />
Holding your friend&#39;s hand as he ran, he turns to look back at you for a brief moment when your friend worn him to look out. Before he had a chance to move out of the way however, it was to late for he shortly after rams head-first into a mirror with his friend that they all fell down to the ground. Yes, even the rabbit was caught up in the cross fire miss up that you&#39;ve hopped over to your friend from class slowly to a near halt for you then back up as you were soon pawing at him to get him up and run out of here while also seeing if he was ok from any glass mirror cuts.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, he wasn&#39;t hurt as you thought that he slowly gets back up to his feet and wonders why is a kangaroo was helping him to see if he was ok at all. And yet, instead of getting up and running off out of here as he was planning on that he looked up into a mirror that you grunted in frustration for he was already changing into a tiger. Looking over to the other guy with the rabbit that he was now a grey wolf as the rabbit was now a big brown bear, yet you accidentally looked into another mirror of yours to see staring back was a white tailed deer buck of a big 8 poiner. Well, at least you&#39;re not a girl anymore. so, what now?</p>
