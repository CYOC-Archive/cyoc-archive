<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kit sat back in his chair sipping his beer. The party was well under way and the noise level was intense. People were running in and out of the frat house; a large rambling three story Victorian complete with a wrap around porch.<br />
<br />
He watched and grinned when he saw the pledgemaster inspect the table of toys and grab the Incredible Hulk toy. He hoped that this would get even more interesting in about 30 seconds, he had no idea how right he was.<br />
<br />
The pledgemaster as a large blonde boy named Josh who had a million dollar smile, and a million dollar dad. He was picture perfect in every way. He walked confidently up to the naked skinny freshman hanging by a rope strung around his shoulders in a harness. The huge oak tree in the back yard was more than capable of supporting his meager weight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look what we have here!&quot; bellowed Josh, getting the attention of most of the crowd. He leaned in close with the hulk toy in one hand, and from his other he produced a little paddle he had hidden under his shirt. The crowd hollered in approval and hooted like the drunken fools most of them were.<br />
<br />
Kit felt something pinch his hand, and reached down to swat what he assumed was a bug while the action unfolded in front of him. Looking down though he was stunned to see his fingers were all black... and getting longer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh oh.&quot; was all he managed to say as he dropped his beer on the porch, his other hand pinching together as well. He hadn't considered the fact that taking the toy to this party and enjoying what was done with it technically counted as playing with it. His time as a human was going to be short. He stood up just in time to feel his pants getting tighter. No, not tighter, something was pushing on them, and his back was aching terribly now.<br />
<br />
He turned around to see a big lump pushing upward from his lower back, and in front of him his hands pressed together tightly, his long black fingers growing like a snake and curving around. His wrists hurt, and from the center of his palms long silver wires began to form. He recognized the shape even before his arms began to darken and his skin began to turn to carbon fiber. He was turning in to quite an expensive toy indeed, he knew that soon he would be a bicycle.<br />
<br />
Behind him with a loud RIP! his pants tore as the seat sprouted from his back. He stumbled forward and landed hard on his front tire as his feet stuck together, tearing right through his shoes as they darkened to black rubber and began to form his rear wheel. His whole body ached now as he turned to hard carbon fibers and his legs stretched in to his new frame, his torso elongating and thinning out, and where his ears had been long handle bars began to push outward from his head. They curved around in front of his face, which was stretching as his neck shortened, his shoulders disappeared in to his new stem, and a second later he toppled on to his side. Even between his legs he could feel what had once been his manhood begin to harden and swell. On either side metal cranks began to push outward with a metal scraping noise his dick became part of his pedals and gears, metallic screws and fitting popping in to place all over him.<br />
<br />
He was done, a street worthy bike with 15 gears and some pretty nice components, all of which were part of him and he could feel every one. Whomever rode him would surely enjoy it, so would he, right up until his rider turned in to a toy and crashed him in to a car he thought dismally.<br />
<br />
But soon he was distracted, because in front of him the Hulk toy was done being played with. It was dropped to the ground temporarily forgotten as the pledgemaster and the pledge himself looked perplexed at their slow and strange changes creeping over their bodies.</p>
