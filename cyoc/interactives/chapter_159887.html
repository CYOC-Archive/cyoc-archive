<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You decide not to use the app and just let the diaper change play out normally.<br />
<br />
Kyle reached down and ripped the tapes holding the garment together free. Leaning forward you saw him lower the front to reveal a trio of brown turds in the seat. You wrinkle your nose at the increased stench of the other’s poo but didn’t turn away as the soiled padding was removed. With baby wipes in hand Kyle began to wipe down the toddler’s exposed privates while you give a giggle at the little boy’s small peepee.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile the host who had previously been laying still during the changing of his underwear started to squirm a bit in response to the wiping. Raising his legs he fussed about as the man moved down between them to his butt, exhibiting behavior very reminiscent of a 3 year old.<br />
<br />
“I know you like being cleaned sir but please try to settle down, I’m almost done” Kyle said as he dropped the brown stained wipes one by one as he used them into the old padding.<br />
<br />
The young boy gave the other a smile as he eased up on his kicking but didn’t stop.<br />
<br />
Removing a new diaper from the bag Kyle waved it in front of the host’s face, “Alright time to get you in another one of this” he said as his charge gave an excited grin.<br />
<br />
Slipping the clean garment under his naked rear end the man grabbed the powder and dusted his crotch and bottom before sprinkling some in the seat of the padding. As Kyle prepared to secure the thing to the boy’s waist the host decided to become vocal and say something.<br />
<br />
Turning his head to the right to face the audience he announced as the padding was brought up between his legs, “Now would actually be a good time to mention one of the sponsors of today’s show. Pampers baby dry brand diapers, Pampers…because your baby deserves to be. And in case you’re all wondering I myself prefer Pampers Cruisers, for when I need to go on the go.” He then flashed a grin to the crowd just as Kyle finished taping up the garment, the audience taking the surprise advertisement in stride while you giggled at hearing the host promote what brand he wore.<br />
<br />
Curious, a quick glance on your part revealed that you apparently wear the same.<br />
<br />
“All done sir, you now have a clean diaper” Kyle said upon completion of the change.<br />
<br />
He then wrapped up and disposed of the old one, dropping it in the trashcan where it joined yours from earlier. After putting everything away in the bag and zipping it back up Kyle helped the host put his pants back on and redo his belt. Finally with a heave he lifted the toddler up and promptly deposited him back in his chair.<br />
<br />
“Thank you for taking care of my doodie for me Kyle” the boy said appreciatively.<br />
<br />
“Your welcome boss” Kyle nodded before quickly walking off stage.<br />
<br />
The now freshly changed host, who smelled faintly of baby powder, then turned to face you, “Alright now that I’ve been changed we can finish the show. Are you still up for it?”<br />
<br />
“Yea, wets keep going” you replied also eager to get the interview over with so you can explore more of your new life of fame and fortune as a famous author.<br />
<br />
You manage to get through the rest of the show without further incident answering the other toddler’s remaining questions about your book while resisting the temptation to change things with the app. Both you and the host also managed to keep from going in your diapers again and causing another changing delay. Though yours was still a bit damp from the small amount of pee you let out from when you laughed earlier but you paid it no mind as you liked the warmness in your padding.<br />
<br />
“And that’s our show ladies and gentleman, I hope you all enjoyed it and I’d like to once again personally thank our guest for coming on and speaking about her book.”<br />
<br />
Everyone in the audience gave you a final big round of applause before getting up and vacating their seats. Once most of them had left the camera crew starting packing things up and your mom rushed on stage to come get you.<br />
<br />
“Oh honey you were absolutely wonderful, everyone loved you. I’m so very proud of you for doing so well on your first public talk show” she congratulated causing you to blush at the praise.<br />
<br />
“Did you have fun? You looked like you were having fun out there.”<br />
<br />
“Oh yea I had wots of fun” you replied with a hidden grin.<br />
<br />
Your mother was completely unaware that mid-show you regressed the host back to babyhood and made him like diapers as well as not want to potty train.<br />
<br />
“Before I forget let me check to see if you need a change before I put your overalls back on. After that surprise poopie you made during the show I can&#39;t be too careful with you now can I”  she said feeling the seat and then sticking a finger in one of the leg gatherers of your padding, “Hmm you’re a little wet but your diaper can handle another accident” your mom surmised before redressing you in your overalls and picking you up in her arms.<br />
<br />
Looking over you saw Kyle who had come back on stage and also had just finished giving the host a check picked up the young boy along with his bag and together the two of you were carried back stage. <br />
<br />
Once back there he was handed over to a woman who looked to be in her mid-30’s who had a 2 year old toddler boy standing by her side.<br />
<br />
It didn’t take you long to realize that this must be the host’s wife and son and you further confirmed this by checking your phone as well as their reason for being here.<br />
<br />
“The 37 month old host is picked up from work by his 35 year old wife and 2 year old son.”<br />
<br />
As your mom paused to search around for where she left your diaper bag you stare at the host interacting with his family then back to the sentence on the app. Knowing she would leave as soon as she found the bag and that you’d no longer be in range to make a change you decided to change…</p>
