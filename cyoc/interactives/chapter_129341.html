<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There were quite a lot of people looking forward to the adult Valentine&#39;s Day party. However, there was a small setback when it was realized that Valentine&#39;s Day and Ash Wednesday would be the same day. Considering it was a prominent holy day and the start of Lent, it would be distasteful to have such a party of debauchery on that day. But it was easily a simple matter of moving the party to the next day. Wednesday would be the night for the meet-and-greet dinner.<br />
<br />
The party at the Meat Market was certainly very interesting. There was an ongoing challenge for the guests called &#39;As Bare as You Dare&#39; which challenged them to go as naked as they could. That didn&#39;t mean they came to the party wearing nothing. Guests would go to the locker room normally held for the employees to strip down as bare as they dared. There were a few rules. For one, no one could go completely naked. They could wear as little as they wanted, but the naughty bits have to be covered up. They also couldn&#39;t wear anything where a wardrobe malfunction was more likely to occur than most. And of course, people who wanted to have sex would need to find a private spot in the back or in one of the booths. It was really quite interesting who would be willing to strip down more than others. Though a lot of them weren&#39;t surprising.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, I really shouldn&#39;t be shocked about this and yet I am,&quot; said Heather dryly. As Heather got into better shape, she felt more comfortable with showing off more of her body. But she still had her limits. She was down to her bra and panties, which was more than enough revealed for her.<br />
<br />
Tyra was on a completely different level. She was wearing what could only be called a &#39;caveman bikini&#39; if you were really generous. Namely because it was a micro-bikini that just barely covered her nipples and between her legs. And they did have a fur pattern so it could technically be called a &#39;caveman&#39; costume. &quot;I&#39;ve been wanting to wear this little number for months and I&#39;ve finally got the right occasion to do so,&quot; said Trya boastfully.<br />
<br />
A few months ago, Heather would have a conniption about her grandmother dressing up that scantily. They&#39;ve bonded a lot since then and Heather was a lot more comfortable with Tyra acting her new physical age. But that didn&#39;t mean she completely at ease with Tyra&#39;s debauchery. &quot;You don&#39;t have a problem with almost essentially being naked?&quot; asked Heather in an exasperated tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your boyfriend doesn&#39;t seem to mind,&quot; said Tyra teasingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have no idea what you&#39;re talking about,&quot; said Jeremy, who was holding his head up high. He was just wearing his boxers right now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, like I haven&#39;t seen you sneaking glances at me. And don&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve smuggled a cucumber to this party,&quot; said Tyra teasingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tyra...&quot; growled Heather threateningly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax, I&#39;d never steal him from you,&quot; said Tyra, &quot;But I wouldn&#39;t mind sharing him. Heck, you share Rex with me if you want. We really ought to have a more open relationship.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not that open...&quot; said Heather with annoyance, rubbing her brow. Then she turned to Jeremy and snapped, &quot;And you can stop fantasizing about that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wasn&#39;t thinking about it! I swear!&quot; yelped Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Boy, what a transparent liar,&quot; said Tyra.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Other times, the challenge was a good way to compare and contrast a near-identical pair. For instance, Sarah and Malice were also at the party wearing swimsuits. But while Sarah was just wearing her complete bikini set, Malice was only wearing the bottom half of hers. Instead of the bikini top, Malice was wearing a thin rubber tube top that showed a lot of cleavage and a lot of underboob. Of course, their boyfriends only had to wear their briefs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really, Mary Alice, did you have to put that on when you still had your top?&quot; asked Sarah.<br />
<br />
&quot;My mate likes the view,&quot; said Malice, though she seemed to be wincing.<br />
<br />
&quot;You ok?&quot; asked Simon with a bit of concern.<br />
<br />
&quot;I might have gotten a size too small,&quot; said Malice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you are a bit bulkier now,&quot; said Travis. The husky sisters gave him an annoyed look. &quot;I meant your muscles,&quot; said Travis, &quot;You&#39;re more muscular than you were last year.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yeah, but that wouldn&#39;t explain why it&#39;s too tight around my chest,&quot; said Malice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Simple, you really did get too small a size,&quot; said Sarah, &quot;And rubber? What were you thinking?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just thought I&#39;d look extra sexy,&quot; said Malice.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about we get you into something more appropriately-sized before you pass out?&quot; asked Sarah.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel fine,&quot; protested Malice. Simon reached forward and slightly yanked on the tube top. It made a &#39;boing&#39; sound sorta like a rubber band. Malice winced before saying, &quot;Ok, I need a different top.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good think I got your real bikini top,&quot; said Sarah as she lead her sister back to the dressing rooms.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Of course, most of the undergarments everyone was wearing had come from Ms. Vivian&#39;s store. As such, it was only proper that Ms. Vivian herself would be at the party. In a way, she was dressed both more and less than what other people were wearing. Her clothes certainly covered more skin, but it was a quite a bit racier than what most of the people there were wearing. Her clothes consisted a corset that covered just enough of her breasts to keep her nipples covered. She was also wearing a pair of tight panties that were connected by suspenders to very long stockings. She also had on a pair of long-sleeved fingerless lace gloves. Having her hair up in a bun and a pair of half-moon spectacles on her nose gave her an enticing and intimidating air.<br />
<br />
Not surprisingly, few people were wanting to be near the vampiress bat. But there was at least one person who had the nerve to strike up a conversation with Ms. Vivian. Sylvia slithered over to Ms. Vivian. Her own lingerie had also came from Ms. Vivian&#39;s store. Sylvia was wearing a buckskin bra which was really cotton and a matching garter belt to go around her hips. &quot;Say, Ms. Vivian, there&#39;s something I&#39;ve been meaning to ask you,&quot; said Sylvia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; asked Ms. Vivian.<br />
<br />
&quot;How are you able to wear all those different outfits without your wings getting in the way?&quot; asked Sylvia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, it&#39;s quite simple. My clothes all have slits that allow me to wear them without damaging my wing membranes too extensively. I&#39;ve working on designing several such clothing for bats like myself. I suppose I&#39;ll be doing more for the pterosaurs that will eventually be coming,&quot; said Ms. Vivian.<br />
<br />
&quot;Another thing, you refer to yourself as &#39;Miss Vivian&#39;. Don&#39;t you have a mate yet?&quot; asked Sylvia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I do. It&#39;s just Arthur and I agree that &#39;Miss Vivian&#39;s Intimacy Boutique&#39; is much sexier and inviting than &#39;Missus Vivian&#39;s Intimacy Boutique&#39;. We are mates, we just don&#39;t go by &#39;Mr.&#39; or &#39;Mrs.&#39; that much,&quot; said Ms. Vivian, &quot;You can call me &#39;Lucy&#39; right now if you&#39;d like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, I suppose you&#39;ll be working on Jill&#39;s wedding dress?&quot; asked Sylvia. The news about her engagement had already spread around quickly in the reptilian community.<br />
<br />
&quot;I might help a bit, but I think Jill deserves a more proper wedding dress,&quot; said Lucy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, she does,&quot; said Sylvia, sounding a little bit bitter.<br />
<br />
Lucy&#39;s ear twitched and she said, &quot;Sylvia, was that a note of jealousy I heard in your voice?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...I guess I&#39;ve kinda had a fantasy about a southern millionaire wanting to hire me to be his attorney, which would have eventually led to a burgeoning romance,&quot; said Sylvia.<br />
<br />
&quot;And now you feel like Jill is living your dream,&quot; said Lucy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, my fantasy man would have been a Texas oil tycoon, not a Louisianan swamp realtor,&quot; said Sylvia.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not Beauregard&#39;s actual job,&quot; said Lucy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still, I comforted her at the bachelorette auction when she was being self-loathing and then she gets swept away by her own Prince Charming,&quot; snapped Sylvia, more venom entering her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn&#39;t you also participated in the dating auction?&quot; asked Lucy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but I didn&#39;t get nearly as much attention as Jill did. My date and I had nothing in common. I think he was expecting some country girl with a sultry streak instead of an aspiring lawyer,&quot; said Sylvia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm... And are you really desperate for romance?&quot; asked Lucy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...I&#39;m kinda busy earning my degree to pursue a relationship. But still, Jill&#39;s getting everything I ever wanted,&quot; said Sylvia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just because Jill&#39;s living your fantasy doesn&#39;t mean you won&#39;t get to yourself,&quot; said Lucy, &quot;You might get something even better. But I think you should focus on being happy for Jill. I&#39;m pretty sure she won&#39;t forget how you helped her get over her doubts and put her in the position to meet Beauregard. In fact, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if she asks you to be her head bridesmaid.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sylvia sighed and said, &quot;Yeah, you&#39;re right. Still stings a little though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your time of happiness will come,&quot; said Lucy.</p>
