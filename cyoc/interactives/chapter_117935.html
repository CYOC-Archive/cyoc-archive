<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
While Claire and Barbara drove back to Moon Lake, Martha Anderson was preparing dinner for herself, her sons, and Kat Johnson, her new &quot;friend&quot;. Naturally Martha was worried how things would go. Eric and Nate seemed to take the news well at first, but maybe they weren&#39;t as ok with her moving on so quickly as they appeared to be.<br />
<br />
Nate and Eric were with their respective mates, enjoying their company and picking their brains regarding their mother&#39;s new relationship. The two had accepted their mother being bi, these days leaning more towards gay in the wake of their father&#39;s death. They had no problems with Martha and the Twists having their nights together. But this was a total stranger to them. And it was just about three months after their father&#39;s death. While most of the wounds had healed, some were still fresh. Everyone still felt waves of pain when they walked past the bedroom and smelled William&#39;s fading scent. Was Kat&#39;s going to replace his? <br />
<br />
&quot;I just don&#39;t want my mom to get hurt,&quot; Eric mused, lying in the grass with his girlfriend. Cassie nodded and continued to stroke his chest fur. The two, in the privacy of Cassie&#39;s backyard, were sunbathing in their fursonas. <br />
<br />
“I don’t think that will happen. I know Miss Johnson, I had her as a teacher when I was in middle school. She’s a little tough, but she’s nice.” Cassie assured Eric.<br />
<br />
“That’s just how she is in school. She might be a complete different person outside. I don’t want my mom to get taken advantage of because she’s in a vulnerable state or something. I won’t let her get hurt again. I don’t want anyone to hurt my family again.” Eric almost growled the last part. His wolf side was telling him to defend his territory, and protect his pack from this outsider. The human part of himself was telling him to relax. <br />
<br />
“I understand. I used to feel that way when men would hit on my mom. But I know she’s capable to taking care of herself. You just have to trust that your mom knows what she’s doing, and let things fall where they may.” Cassie said. <br />
<br />
“I guess. Say, did you ever figure out who that werewolf your mom is seeing is?” Eric asked, remembering that he wasn’t the only one whose mother had taken on a lover.<br />
<br />
“No. The scent is too vague and fading for me to properly identify it. I won’t go poking my nose where I’m not allowed. I hope Mom will tell me soon, especially since he seems to be making her so happy.” Cassie recalled how her mom came downstairs with a big grin the past few nights. Cassie hadn’t seen her that happy in a long while. <br />
<br />
“You don’t think it’s anyone from our pack do you?” Eric wondered.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know. Mom doesn’t go to many pack meetings, but maybe someone reached out to her.” Cassie shrugged. Her guess wasn’t too far off. Ben Twist had in fact started having regular rendezvouses with the older were. And the two had taken a liking to each other. <br />
<br />
“Mmm, well we have about two hours before I’m due home for dinner. What do you want to do in the meantime?” Eric asked, sitting up. <br />
<br />
“I think we should do what we always do after school. We’ve put it off long enough as it is.” Cassie said, also sitting up. Eric felt his cock twitch and poke its head out of his sheath. His tail thumped against the ground and he leaned over to kiss Cassie. Who, to Eric’s surprise, leaned away and laughed.<br />
<br />
“I meant do our homework you horny wolf. We can play later, after you have dinner. I don’t want you to eat a meal with your mother and her new lover smelling like wet fur and sex. That’s not very polite.” Cassie giggled. <br />
<br />
“It’s not like it would be the first time either Nate or myself showed up smelling like sex.” Eric pointed out. <br />
<br />
“All the same, I want you to leave a good impression. Tell you what, you come inside, do your homework and go be a good boy at dinner, and I’ll let you have as much dessert as you want later. Scout’s honor.” Cassie said. Eric couldn’t refuse that. <br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Nate and Alex were spending their afternoon in a very similar fashion. Relaxing in Alex’s basement, the two had pushed their homework aside and were talking about the impending Anderson dinner as well. <br />
<br />
“Do you know anything about my mom’s new ‘friend’? You must have had her as a teacher in school.” Nate asked, using the term friend very loosely. <br />
<br />
“Eh, I had my first transformation when I was twelve, so gym was always a breeze for me. Miss Johnson never paid much attention to me. But she was nice. Ben didn’t like her much, he didn’t change until he was in eighth grade. Was terrible at sports and the like beforehand.” Alex laughed. <br />
<br />
“You’re kidding? Athletic Ben Twist was all thumbs?” Nate scoffed.<br />
<br />
“I swear on my great grandparents’ grave, he couldn’t even net a free throw. Hard as he might try, Ben played lots of sports and sucked at all of them.” <br />
<br />
“I can’t wait to see him tomorrow. He’s always teasing me about my inability to throw a spiral.” Nate snickered. <br />
<br />
“Enough of that. I want some attention.” Alex said. <br />
<br />
“No offense, but I’m just not in the mood. Maybe it’s my nerves, all I can think about is dinner.” Nate sighed. He’d spent most of the day wondering about Kat Johnson. What was her story, why had she set her sights on his mom, what was her plan going forward knowing that his mom was pregnant with his father’s last child? So many questions floated around his head….<br />
<br />
“I think you just need to relax stud. What I do know about Kat Johnson is that she’s a well respected member of the town, and hasn’t done anything to give you reason to worry about how she’ll treat your mom.” Alex said. <br />
<br />
“Alright, if you say so. But if she turns out to be some sort of horrible, bloodsucking demon from the underworld who wants to drag my mom’s and little sister’s souls into the deepest pits in Hell you’re gonna get it.”<br />
<br />
“What is it exactly?” <br />
<br />
“Wouldn’t you like to know.”</p>
