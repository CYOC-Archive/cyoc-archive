<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Realizing that if he wanted to go home, staying in his room probably wouldn’t do him any good, Matt began looking through the piles of dirty clothes on the floor for anything that was remotely clean. As he did, he couldn’t help but feel the weight of the solid rod that was sticking out of his crotch. He tried pawing it down, but just touching it sent him into such a state of arousal that he involuntarily growled loudly as his eyes rolled back from the pleasure of the first touch. He then tried to ignore it, but felt his dick rub against his upper stomach and pecs, causing more fits of arousal and even leaving precum on his upper stomach and pecs as he knelt down to examine the clothes.<br />
Most of the clothes were, as expected, either very sexualized or just didn’t actually cover much. Most of the jockstraps, posing shorts, and even the loincloth he found (which was crotchless, allowing his dick to swing free below) were either cumsoaked or sweatsoaked, and more frequently soaked with both cum and sweat. Sticking halfway out of one of his drawers he found a bright red speedo that didn’t seem to have the musky smell the rest of his clothes did and put them on. He looked in the mirror afterwards and could see his raging boner still outlined by the speedo, and the waistline of the speedo was even straining to cover the base of his meat stick. Figured that was the best he could do, to cover that, he then found a clean tight black  spandex tank top that he then struggled to put on. Looking at himself in the mirror, he found that the shirt was cut in a way to expose the sideboob of his pecs, and clung so tightly to his body that you could see his abs even with the hair between his stomach and the shirt. <br />
Matt made his way out of his bedroom and into the living room/kitchen area of the apartment he shared with his roommate Luke. Luke was normally a short, skinny, and socially awkward guy. He wore thick horn-rimmed glasses and typically kept to himself unless Matt would go talk to him. He was also straight, like Matt, who had tried to take him out to bars to get him experience with the ladies, only for Luke to bail early out of anxiety.<br />
The Luke sitting on their couch was not that Luke.<br />
Matt still recognized him as Luke, but whatever was going on seemed to affect him most of all. The man sitting on the couch looked like a god in human form, with perfectly sculpted abs and pec muscles that were so large Matt almost thought they were too big for a bra. Spread across his chest was a tattoo of an eagle, with each pec being covered by a wing, but the main body of the bird being almost completely hidden by his pecs pushing against one another. His arms were equally massive, his upper arms almost bigger than his head and thick veins pulsing down them. One of his hands was caressing his pecs while the other laid across the back of the couch. His massive tree trunks he could call his legs were spread wide. revealing a half-hard foot long dick and balls the size of grapefruits. His body was mostly hairless, exceptions being his armpits and treasure trail leading to a pubis forest. His face was squarer as well, and bore a goatee as well as several piercings along his eyebrows and ears. He still had his glasses, though they looked much more ironic on the larger, much more masculine figure.<br />
Luke turned his head toward Matt as he gawked at his roommate. “Morning bro.” He said in a voice much more confident than Matt was expecting. Luke must have seen Matt’s confusion as he then proceeded to ask: “You okay man? I didn’t hear you jerk off this morning.”<br />
“Jerk off?” Matt responded.<br />
“Yeah bro, you gotta do something to calm the beast, am I right?” Luke chuckled and stroked his own cock once, almost like he was demonstrating for Matt. “D’you need a hole today, hand ain’t doin’ it?”<br />
“Hole?” Matt asked, still confused at what Luke was suggesting. He could feel precum dripping from his hard-on into his speedo from just looking at Luke.<br />
Luke laughed again and stood up, showing his height over Matt. “Yeah bro, you need my ass? I mean I kinda owe ya, I’ve had to use yours a lot lately.” Luke reached around and smacked Matt’s ass, and Matt moaned in response. <br />
Matt’s head was fogging up as his felt himself get hornier and hornier. He knew he wasn’t gay but all he cared about in that moment was that a hole was being offered to him, and he couldn’t refuse. Matt pulled the waistband around his cock, exposing it as he forcibly turned Luke around and pushed his upper body down to lay on their kitchen table, and Luke happily did so as he used an arm to brace himself against the table. Matt quickly located the hole between Luke’s massive cheeks and without hesitation forced his way in. It was not as tight as he was expecting it to be, probably loosened by similar methods. It was also deeper than he expected, being able to push all the way in until his balls began slapping Luke’s asscheeks with every thrust, a sound you would have heard if both Luke and Matt were not moaning and howling at full volume. As he thrusted, Matt found his hands migrating around Luke’s body, feeling up his tightly muscles back and wrapping around to his chiseled abs. He didn’t know why, but the thought of fucking such a godly body turned him on even more.<br />
As Matt thrusted his cock into him, Luke’s had gone rock hard as well. He had begun to use his free hand to stroke his fully erect 14-inch member. The feeling of Matt’s hands exploring his muscles made him feel even more aroused. At one point one of Matt’s hands had grabbed a handful of Luke’s enormously juicy pecs, which sent waves of transcendent pleasure through his entire body. Matt roared at the top of his lungs, never feeling such amazing arousal before as he came into Luke’s ass. Feeling this, Luke finally managed to cum himself, creating a large puddle of seed underneath him. Both men breathed heavily as their cocks began to soften and the arousal faded. As it did, Matt had begun to realize what position he was in and quickly pulled his cock out of Luke’s dripping ass and covered it back up in the speedo, now a better fit around his 8” soft monster. “I, uh… I’m sorry…” Matt uttered, ashamed.<br />
Luke stood and turned to look at Matt. “What are you sorry for? You needed a hole, bro, s’all good.” Luke placed his hand on Matt’s shoulder as he walked back over to the couch, still with Matt’s seed dripping from his ass.<br />
“Well I mean… I’m swear I’m not gay.”<br />
Luke looked confused. “You’re not what?”<br />
“Gay? You know, like how we’re both supposed to be straight?”<br />
Luke looked even more confused. “I mean your dick is curved to the left, bro, it’s not straight. But uh… what does ‘gay’ mean?”</p>
