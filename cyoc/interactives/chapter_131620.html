<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Huck Jenkins left, Samantha Twist went back to the kitchen to check on the dinner she was preparing.<br />
Cooking wasn&#39;t her best talent, although everything she did make was edible.<br />
But she wanted everything tonight to be special, which was why she was working hard on making all of Frances&#39; favorites.<br />
She had already contacted their son Ben after school and made arrangements for him to spend the evening with his girlfriend Kenya Adaeze.<br />
<i>After all the emotional stress we&#39;ve been through, Frances and I need a night alone. I definitely want to show my wife how much I love her, and maybe talk about our future too.</i><br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Eric Anderson sat in his room, alone.<br />
The idea was to do his homework, but while the books were open on his desk, the pages remained unread.<br />
<i>There is no way I could lose Julie&#39;s love,</i> he told himself, while staring at his hand again.<br />
Longing for the were-mermaid he had fallen in love with and was destined to marry, Eric had resumed his Stage 1 form, looking at the webbing between his fingers.<br />
<i>Even if he is a fellow were-mer, there&#39;s no way Julie could be interested in Arthur Curtis,</i> he thought to reassure himself.<br />
<i>Besides, it isn&#39;t that I ain&#39;t desirable. After all, that Spencer Lawson came on to me.* Not that I&#39;d ever cheat on Julie. Which proves Julie isn&#39;t interested in Arthur. After all, we were both virgins before she ushered me into were society.**</i><br />
A smile crossed Eric&#39;s face as he grabbed pen and paper. He had every intention of starting his homework at that point, but then another stray thought crossed his mind.<br />
<i>Yet Julie and I have both been practically insatiable when it comes to sex since then. That&#39;s just two weres in love doing what comes naturally, right?</i> he asked himself. <i>After all, Julie and I are destined to be together, and I would <b>never</b> cheat on her. Besides, Spencer came on to me, which is something no woman has ever done before.</i><br />
<i>Except Julie...</i><br />
<i>But mom&#39;s living proof that you can love someone and still have sex with others. After all, she and dad are married and love each other <b>very</b> much. Yet mom&#39;s a bi-werecat who&#39;ll sleep with other women whenever she gets the chance.</i><br />
Then, thinking he should start his homework, Eric looked down at his paper.<br />
On it he had doodled...<br />
A (+?) J + E (+?) S<br />
<i>What is it with women? Let alone were females?</i><br />
Frustrated with both himself and the situation, Eric ripped the page to shreds and then crumbled the pieces together before angrily tossing them into his waste basket.<br />
<i>I need some aspirin,</i> Eric told himself, leaving his room and his homework behind, but not his confusion.<br />
<br />
AT THAT MOMENT, the &quot;S&quot; in Eric&#39;s doodled equation had more feral thoughts on her mind.<br />
&quot;YES!&quot; she growled to herself, feeling the orgasm overtake her body as she continued to plunge the dildo in and out of her hungry cunt. Made especially for a were-female&#39;s needs with its extra length and thickness, her mother didn&#39;t know that her only daughter had secreted the pseudo penis out of her belongings. Maggie Lawson had just assumed that her &quot;favorite&quot;, next to her husband&#39;s lupine woman pleaser, had just unfortunately gotten lost in their recent move back to Moon Lake.<br />
Spencer Lawson laid nude but furry in the privacy of her own bedroom. Although her parents were not home, she still had the door closed just in case.<br />
The only child of Evan and Maggie Lawson***, Spencer was a hybrid combination of her sire the werewolf and her mother, a werecat-panthress mix.<br />
Her coarse black fur bristled as she continued to pleasure herself. The tips of her full and hard breasts pointed toward the ceiling of her bedroom as the plastic substitute for what she really wanted continued to plunge in and out of her body.<br />
Being a mixed species, she didn&#39;t quite look like any one were, but an unique combination of the three, with slightly smaller ears and a tail that wasn&#39;t as thick as a werewolf&#39;s, but each had more fur than any feline&#39;s, along with a muzzle that was somewhat larger than a cat&#39;s with more teeth than a feline, but less than a werewolf&#39;s.<br />
Despite looking like any other lupine&#39;s, Spencer&#39;s claws enabled her to climb trees, but right now the only thing she wanted her hands to do was give her another orgasm; as one paw continued to drive the dildo into her while the other started rubbing her clit.<br />
<i>Oh yes Eric! Come on you horny were-mer! Fuck me!</i> were Spencer&#39;s erotic thoughts, even as her body started to shudder in sexual pleasure once more.<br />
<br />
ELSEWHERE...<br />
Karen Yuletide came back into her empty dorm room after her shower, only wearing a bathrobe, flip-flops, and a towel around her hair.<br />
Her roommate, the now married Jenny Jenkins, was still out and about somewhere.<br />
<i>Probably with her new husband Harry,</i> thought Karen.<br />
She set her shampoo and soap containers on her dresser, then opened her closet door to pick out what she wanted to wear for her dinner date with her fiance Peter Talbot tonight.<br />
Thinking about the handsome werelion made her heart beat faster as a smile crossed her face.<br />
Selecting a nice but fashionable one piece dress, Karen was about to get dressed when she stopped and caught her image in the mirror attached to the inner door of her closet.<br />
She opened the robe and stared at her nude body.<br />
Her pert breasts with their hard nipples. Her shoulder length blonde hair and the slight bush just above the entrance to her most private sexual area, which proved that she was a NATURAL blonde.<br />
Karen&#39;s mind drifted to thoughts of what she would look like once Peter ushered her into were society this coming weekend as his werelioness.<br />
From what she saw of other were-lionesses in Moon Lake, despite the fact that both were and natural lions had long manes, she would not lose her hair when furry. It just wouldn&#39;t grow any longer than what she already had, since lionesses were maneless.<br />
She let the robe drop to her feet and turned this way and that, picturing herself furry with a long tail, bigger breasts like just about every woman in Moon Lake who was a were...<br />
Karen stared at herself in the mirror and let out a low but happy growl, imagining herself with green eyes and a lion&#39;s muzzle.<br />
She felt a shudder course throughout her body at the thought of not only becoming a werelioness, but PETER&#39;S werelioness!<br />
<i>Did I just have an orgasm?</i> she wondered, reaching between her legs and feeling the moisture gather between them.<br />
Purring in contentment, Karen dried herself off and started getting dressed for her date.<br />
