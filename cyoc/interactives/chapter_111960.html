<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stan estimated his mom to be at about 6&#39;2 using some mental math. The growing had stopped for now; he had remembered reading something on the packaging about a break in between growth spurts. He looked at his mom. He didn&#39;t know what to do, whether to call a doctor or poison control or anything. He couldn&#39;t believe his mom was taller than him now. Ever since 2 years ago, he was at least a good<br />
inch taller than her. Now, at least when she woke up, she would be a good few FEET taller than him, unless he found a way to stop the <br />
drug or whatever it is, from changing his mom. While thinking about this, his mom slowly rolled over in the bed, the covers rolling with her, so that she was right side down in the bed, with her on top of the covers. Stan looked up. He could see the strained shirt and pants at their <br />
breaking points, struggling to contain his mom&#39;s new mass. He walked over to the other side of the bed to get a good look at his mom, to <br />
determine if she needed medical assistance. He looked at his mother&#39;s face, which seemed to look different than normal. Not sick-like or<br />
anything like that, but maybe.....younger? No, he said to himself, the packet only affected size, not age. But taking a second look at his mom&#39;s<br />
face, he was compelled to find out more about this...this drug. Stan went to his room and went to his laptop and searched up Gx size drug.<br />
Only 5 results popped up and he clicked on the first one. He scanned the document for anything useful and stopped about halfway <br />
through at this line: Drug 7-24 has proven to meet expectations in regards to size of female volunteers. However, under consumption with<br />
water, distilled or non-distilled, it has been linked to the following effects: More growth spurts (about 4), development of new appendages, age regression, and memory loss. Unfortunately, an antidote has not yet been found, but it is being worked on currently.<br />
<br />
Stan stared at the screen. No antidote...more effects. He couldn&#39;t believe it. It had to be some kind of a dream, no, nightmare. He knew that<br />
since coffee uses hot water, she might be subject to the new effects. He heard a loud moan from his mom. He hurried in and found his mom waking up.<br />
<br />
His mom, now awake, sat up in her bed to awaken with Stan scanning her over. She felt funny, as if every limb in her body had just <br />
had that &quot;pins and needles&quot; feeling. &quot;Hey Stan&quot;, she said, why am I in bed? Stan remembered that one of the effects was memory loss. &quot;You ...um...you just had a little stomachache, go back to sleep, he said. Okay, but make sure to wake me up when I need to...AUGH!!! Stan&#39;s mom yelled out in pain. Stan determined that this had to be either another growth spurts or one of the possible side effects. Stan watched his mom collapse on her bed and begin to sweat profusely. Stan watched in horror as his mom began to convulse on the bed. Stan watched as his mom entered her 3rd growth spurt, which he determined was the case. He watched his mom sprawled out on the bed begin to grow, her legs lengthening to a huge degree. He watched as her torso expanded, lengthened, and grew to an astounding size. He even noticed , involuntarily, her bust increase by a whole cup size. Her head grew and inflated so that it matched her new humongous torso. Her hands were the biggest change as her hands grew bigger and bigger and her fingers longer and longer. God, her hands could wrap around my lower leg, Stan thought. His mom&#39;s feet also grew another 2 sizes, which put her feet at a size 14. Stan knew from the Guiness Book of World Records that the biggest feet on a woman are a size 14. That is a little over an entire foot in length, Stan thought. Holy crap. The rest of the changes weren&#39;t that much in comparison to the previous ones, and in about 2 minutes, Stan&#39;s mom stopped growing. <br />
<br />
Stan&#39;s jaw dropped at the size of his mom now. Doing the math, he estimated her size to be 6&#39;8, while just a half hour ago, she was a mere 5&#39;2. Her clothes had not yet ripped yet, but he could see they were almost like a morphsuit on her. Well, at least it&#39;s over, Stan said. In an ironic twist, his mom started sweating again. Did the next growth spurt come that quickly? Stan said. Stan looked and scanned over his mother to try and find any changes in height or body proportion of his mom, but he didn&#39;t see any. Oh, no, he thought. This must be one of the side effects. But which one? He knew it couldn&#39;t be another growth spurt and memory loss doesn&#39;t cause sweating, so it must be either development of new appendages or age regression. Stan was nervous. Both seemed bad and there was no way could stop either of them. He looked at his mother and is heart leapt up in his chest. Her face had started to change. Instead of a 35 year old mother with premature wrinkles, he saw a 30 year old woman with a smooth face and no gray hairs. In fact, she reminded him of someone he knew, but he couldn&#39;t remember the name or face. His mom started getting younger again before his eyes. She hit 29, and her breasts, again involuntary noticement by Stan, perked up a bit, partly because his mom had started getting the signs of old age early. He saw the slightly bulging veins on her hands disappear and sink into her skin. His mom then started to approach 28. Her face cleared up some more and she slimmed up a bit overall. Suddenly, the regressing stopped. Even though his mom regressed in age, she still retained her height and stature. <br />
<br />
Stan&#39;s mom opened her eyes. She woke up to a young boy, whom she did not know, staring at her intently. She was a little creeped out by this. Uh, why are you staring at me? Stan apologized. Sorry, he said. I was just trying to help you get better from some sort of a stomachache, which apparently was the excuse now. Stan&#39;s mom replied, Well you don&#39;t need to stare at me in order for me to get better do you? Stan said no. Good, then I will be taking a nap WITHOUT you, thank you very much. Now go away, she said. Stan left the room and the sound of his mom snoring soon followed. Stan was a very distraught by the fact that his mom didn&#39;t remember him anymore. After his died abandoned him and his mom and left the country, his mom was the only guardian he had. Now she didn&#39;t remember him. In fact, she was more of a big sister than a mom now, being only 14 years older than Stan. Stan started to walk to the couch to watch some TV when he heard his mom moaning in the other room. He ran in to find...</p>
