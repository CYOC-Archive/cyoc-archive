<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Still gathering her wits, Jen started getting dressed and in spite of all that had transpired, asked Aubrey for a ride to school, as she had long since missed the bus.  Getting dressed even was difficult.  She kept checking her mirror for body hair, lifting her arms and inspecting her naval.  Of course there was nothing left of the fetish her sister had donned on her, but it was still so very fresh in her mind.  She could still almost feel Aubrey&#39;s breasts pressed into her E-cup sized melons.  Smell her perfume, and feel her tongue licking her armpits.<br />
<br />
Was that really Aubrey&#39;s fetish?  No wonder she couldn&#39;t keep a girlfriend.  Aubrey had dated guys early on in her high school career, but once she hit her senior year it was all girls, all the time.  Only they never stuck around.  It was now obvious why.  Jen almost felt sorry for her, and in a deep pocket of her mind, slightly satisfied she was able to give her sister something she&#39;s always desired.<br />
<br />
She shook the thoughts from her brain and finished getting dressed.<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath, she went into school and hoped somehow that the curse would not still be in effect.  Everyone was in class already so the halls were empty.  Everyone except the gym teacher, who was grabbing a drink of water at the moment.  Jen never really like gym class, all the boys were perverts.  But mostly, it was because they were perverts for the gym teacher.  Miss Fonda. Elaine, or Laney, Fonda.  And she was trans to boot.  Everyone knew it, she didn&#39;t try to keep it a secret, and didn&#39;t even try to tuck either.  She wore gym shorts, short up to her butt, a white polo shirt, and almost knee length socks, and she spotted Jen the moment she had finished at the water fountain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well well, miss Smith, wandering the halls again, and without a pass?&quot;  Miss Fonda said stepping in front of Jen.<br />
<br />
The same feeling Jen had felt earlier took hold as something seemed off, a chill arcing through her body.  Immediately she could feel pressure in her chest, but not like before.  Her nipples were on fire!  She looked down at her chest to see both her nipples pressing tightly against her shirt, far more than a simple chill could create.<br />
<br />
&quot;My my,&quot; Miss Fonda said biting her lower lip, &quot;Someone forget to wear a bra today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No Miss Fonda, I...  I am wearing one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that so.&quot;  Even as she spoke, Jen&#39;s nipples protruded further out on her chest.  &quot;Come on Miss Smith, lets get you out of the hallway.&quot;<br />
<br />
Miss Fonda grabbed Jen by the hand and took her down the hall, and around near the auditorium.  Jen knew where she was going.  There was an old storage room where no one was supposed to go, but everyone did.  Empty, quiet, secluded, and full of discarded office chairs, sofas, and props and costumes that hadn&#39;t seen use in years.  A single recessed light from the ceiling lit up the room.  A burnt orange carpet covered the floor, which helped to keep sound from escaping as well.<br />
<br />
She shoved Jen back onto one of the love seats and straddled her, dry humping her pelvis and then slowly reached under Jen&#39;s shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s something going on under here isn&#39;t there, Jennifer Smith?&quot;  Jen just sat in disbelief again, as her mind clouded over to what was happening.<br />
<br />
Miss Fonda was not an ugly woman by any standards.  Strawberry blonde, dyed likely, usually held back in a ponytail but was now falling freely.  A perfect tan, perfect makeup with wings on her eyes that tapered to an infinite point.  And large delicious CDLs.  Jen had no clue Miss Fonda was even into women, but those lips she was sure had sucked quite the number of cocks.  Then, her shirt just came off.<br />
<br />
The sensitivity in her nipples was extreme, and now she knew why.  Both of her nipples had transformed into thick veiny cocks!  And worse, they looked like they belonged there, aside from the whole anatomy thing.  Jen could see the transformation continuing, as the veins slowly filled up her tits, pressing out from the skin in thick tracks all around her, they even ran up her chest a little and up her neck.<br />
<br />
The look in Miss Fonda&#39;s eyes however, was of pure animal lust.  She pulled her cock free and started stroking it, and without even asking, dove onto the left nipple-dick, sucking it deep and using her other hand to kneed the other breast and cock.  Jen was in almost euphoric bliss.  Miss Fonda&#39;s tongue and lips were heavenly, sliding up and down her new penises so expertly, that every time she came down she shuddered.  Up and down on her breasts and cocks, over and over &#39;til what thoughts she had left was filled with only pleasure.<br />
<br />
And yet, Jen&#39;s transformation did not seem to end there.  As the transformation traveled up her neck, she felt a numbness in her face.  Jen couldn&#39;t even process what might be happening to her, but Miss Fonda seen it immediately.  Continuing to deep throat her new cocks, she fully removed her gym shorts and panties.  And then she stopped.  Jen looked up in a daze, confused and lustful at the cock Miss Fonda was now stroking in front of her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Open wide girly-girl,&quot; she said, &quot;but you don&#39;t have much choice do you then?&quot;  And in her penis went, down into Jen&#39;s pussy mouth.<br />
<br />
Pussy mouth??  If the pleasure she had felt up to this point was incredible, this was absolutely mind blowing.  Her mouth had transformed completely into a vagina, vertical slit with labia and clitoris.  And now she was taking the gym teacher&#39;s cock inside of it.  The worst (or best?) part of it all was that she could still taste it.  The sweaty musky shaft tasted salty and smelled... wonderful!  Jen was giving into this, just as she had before, and began pumping her head faster and faster up the length of Laney&#39;s cock.  She just couldn&#39;t help herself.  Laney even helped, one hand pushing Jen&#39;s face into her crotch, the other fondling her own fake tits, squeezing the nipples as if she dreamt of having her own pair of cocks on her chest.<br />
<br />
Jen too kept up the momentum, with both hands jerking her tits off in tandem with the motion of the cock in her face.  It felt amazing.  And the only thing that could have made it any better is if she had a cock in her lower pussy as well, but this was still so overwhelming that it didn&#39;t matter.  Jen could feel the thick veins begin to cover her entire body.  Her legs now looked like they could sprout a penis at any time.  Her arms too.  And just when she felt she couldn&#39;t take any more, Laney Fonda tensed up, her cock tightening and slightly extending as a burst of cum shot out from her shaft and down Jen&#39;s &quot;throat&quot;.  There was no gag reflex, no urge to reject what was happening.  At the same time her own nipples erupted, spraying semen onto Miss Fonda&#39;s legs, as she was yet still straddling her face.<br />
<br />
Time seemed to stand still, but when it resumed, Laney pulled herself free from Jennifer&#39;s face, and slumped down squeezing into the space beside her.  Her cock fell limp, and the last remnants of cum leaked onto her leg next to the cum already left there by Jen&#39;s tits.  Jen too began to recede back into her former self.  The cocks regaining their soft pink nipple shape, and her face forming back into a proper mouth.  They were both still mostly naked, but at least one of them no longer looked like a... well, a perverted person&#39;s impossible fetish.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me, Miss Smith,&quot; Laney said between breaths, &quot;Have you heard of the town&#39;s curse?&quot;</p>
