<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">First Kyle gestured to Aaron.  &quot;Aaron come here,&quot; he commanded.  <br />
<br />
Arron walked over to Kyle and Kyle turned away from the crowd, remarkably bashful because of the crowd.  <br />
<br />
Kyle reached in his pants, unzipping his fly and pulled out his modest erection. He didn&#39;t let Aaron grasp it yet.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Aaron, I want you to give me a ten inch cock with balls to match and I want you to restore my foreskin.  If you do anything else -- and I mean anything else at all-- I will make you regret it every day of your life.&quot; Kyle looked in Aaron&#39;s eyes and made sure the message hit home.  He wasn&#39;t playing around and Aaron knew it.  <br />
<br />
With a quick nod of agreement Aaron grasped Kyle&#39;s member and made the changes to the scrawny teen.  Kyle quickly fished his enhanced junk back into his pants without bragging or showing it off and dismissed Aaron back to his seat.  <br />
<br />
Kyle searched the crowd for the last person to be changed and his eyes fell upon Clark Chambers, the school mascot.  Clark was the East Hampton Warhorse. Kyle called him forward.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Clark, it&#39;s time for the mascot!&quot; He said once more gesturing at the entire crowd that had been changed.  <br />
<br />
Clark came forward not daring to show any resistance.  He hadn&#39;t been one of the cool guys at school.  He hadn&#39;t even really wanted to be the Mascot.  His dad had suggested he tried out in order to possibly get a scholarship once he graduated.  That had all changed when he had shown up to tonight&#39;s party.  <br />
<br />
Clark came forward, his mascot uniform already having been changed in Kyle&#39;s earlier edits to the school&#39;s reality.  He remembered the former horse uniform and the way he had practiced with the girls on the cheerleading squad but he also remembered that the cheerleading squad was all male as was reflected in the kilt that had been added to his costume.  He knew that there was no way out of these changes.  He had seen an entire room full of young men submit to the deranged desires of Kyle Perkins.  He knew there was no hope.  So he can walked forward calmly to the front, horse head in hand. <br />
<br />
Kyle looked him up and down and said, &quot;Last but not least! Welcome Clark! Everybody give him a round of applause.&quot;<br />
<br />
Those who were fucking or sucking or being fucked or sucked all paused and began an uproarious cheer.  Those few who had been sent back to their seats did the same.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Now Clark, I&#39;ve always thought that a mascot didn&#39;t remove their head while in costume.  Go ahead and put it back on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clark did as he was told. Lifting the smelly and cartoonish horse head back on top of his shoulders. Kyle nodded approvingly.  <br />
<br />
Then he said, &quot;You must really like being a mascot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clark realized that he did enjoy showing off for the crowd.  It wasn&#39;t just a past time or a way to a quick scholarship.  He wanted to be a mascot.  He enjoyed being a mascot.  It was a good time.  <br />
<br />
Kyle said, &quot;You never take your costume off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now, Clark began to panic he reached up to pull the head he has just placed on his head off and realized he couldn&#39;t.  He couldn&#39;t remember ever taking the costume off once he has put it on.   He had lived in the thing.  And of course, the costume itself smelled like he had lived in it for two years.  He tried to move his arms to the zippers he knew existed but he just couldn&#39;t do it.  It wasn&#39;t possible and in fact, he didn&#39;t really want to take it off.  <br />
<br />
Clark began to make muffled struggling noises under his costume but Kyle spoke up, &quot;Mascots never speak while in costume.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clark&#39;s muffled protests vanished.  He was in the suit.   He was the mascot.  He didn&#39;t speak while in the costume and he never took the costume off.  Without any internal debate, Clark shut the fuck up.  <br />
<br />
Kyle looked pleased with his silence.  He looked the struggling mascot up and down and said, &quot;The cheerleaders wear kilts but why don&#39;t you take that thing off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clark silently unfastened his kilt displaying more of the red fur of his warhorse costume.  <br />
<br />
Kyle looked at it disapprovingly. &quot;We&#39;re an all boys school with a warhorse for a mascot not a gelding. Our school has  a costume with the proper male anatomy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Instantly, the costume changed.  No longer was it merely an anthropomorphic horse costume with the hint of maleness. On the broad padded chest two nipples sprouted. The ass of the costume became more defined with definite ass cheeks and the hint of a fabric equine asshole, and the crotch of the horse costume became complete with an equine cock and balls. <br />
<br />
Clark reached forward to grasp the pendulous fabric that had been added to his costume.  The bright red fur morphing to bright pink in the appropriate places, the nipples, cockhead, and asshole.  <br />
<br />
Clark knew that these changed were obscene and ridiculous but he had been wearing the costume for almost two years so he didn&#39;t do much to protest.  <br />
<br />
Kyle looked over the new mascot, the massive lard of the equine cock that had been masterfully stitched to the final product and he sighed. The. He said, &quot;For a school as great as ours, it doesn&#39;t make sense that we have a mere image of an anthropomorphic horse as our mascot. Instead, our mascot is a real anthro horse.<br />
<br />
Instantly, Clark felt his body change as the costume he had been trapped in came to life.  It wasn&#39;t something he wore all the time.  It was who he was.  His horse nostrils flared and he let out a loud whinny as he felt blood pumping into what had moments ago been a cloth facsimile of a dick.  He got hard.  Really hard as his hand tightened around a now leaking and aroused cock.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Woah boy,&quot; Kyle said.  &quot;We can&#39;t have a horny horseman getting his rocks off all the time.  I guess that&#39;s why the cheerleaders keep your cock caged.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clark went from stroking his cock to pawing at the metal chastity cage keeping him from getting hard.  He pawed his left foot on the ground in a very horselike manner. His nostrils flaring and taking note of the smell of spunk in the room.  He turned his head to Kyle, the source of his denied pleasure and took two steps toward him. <br />
<br />
Kyle was quicker in his feet and commanded, &quot;Stand still!&quot;<br />
<br />
Clark stopped his motion in mid stride.  Kyle walked around him surveying his work.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You know, I don&#39;t know if a horse is as fitting for a school as unique as ours.  We&#39;ve turned out Olympic swimmers, great guys like Ben, amazing people like Demarcus.  <br />
<br />
This elicited a moan from Demarcus as he looked over at the horse, his second pair of arms still trying to motivate a flaccid Chad into performing again.  <br />
<br />
Kyle eyed his last creation but continued.  &quot;I think we need a mascot that is unique as our school. Instead of a warhorse, change into a unicorn.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clark watched as his fur changed from bright red to pure white.  A rainbow colored horn sprouted from his forehead.  His nipples and asshole gained an iridescent sheen and he assumed his cock did too inside the confines of the chastity device.  <br />
<br />
Kyle said, &quot;Wow. That&#39;s more like it.  Horny the Unicorn. The mascot of East Hampton.  No wonder the cheerleaders spend so much time during the week teasing you and keeping you aroused.&quot;<br />
<br />
Horny, formerly Clark, thought back to all the times the cheerleaders teased him, eating him out in the locker room, playing with his nipples, a couple of times they had held him down and let Jimmy, the head cheerleader fuck himself on his horn.  <br />
<br />
Kyle kept it up.  &quot;The magical part of your change is that every pep rally, you turn at least one guy in the school into something completely perverted, &quot; he said, &quot;When you do, they let you out of your cage for the weekend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Horny remembered using the powers do his magical horn to change many of the guys in the school into freaks.  Last week, he had turned Dr. Stevens , the assistant principal  and head of ROTC into a barely legal twink with a fetish for black cock. The week before, he had given a sophomore two heads and two dicks.  His work of making the school sexier and sluttier made his part of pep rallies a main attraction. And he has been rewarded for his work by Jimmy removing his lock and letting him jerk off to the cheerleading routine.  <br />
<br />
Horne&#39;s new reality and his status  as a permanent and transformative element of the school established itself  in his mind.   It was his duty.  It was his job.  It was his life to show off his moves, to make a member of his school into a freak, and to get his rocks off when possible.  <br />
<br />
Kyle finished by saying, &quot;When you&#39;re not getting turned on by the cheerleaders or getting your rocks off after a hard week&#39;s work, your spending your time in the school locker rooms cleaning up spunk and slutting it about for guys who want to ride a take a unicorn for a ride.&quot;<br />
<br />
Horny&#39;s mind filled with endless years of serving the school, changing its young men, and waiting diligently for the rare chance to fuck.   <br />
<br />
Kyle looked over the newly minted mascot and was very pleased with himself.  This would lead to an amazing rest of the school year.  He clapped his hands and called Benson who had been wandering  wandering around the room looking for cum to lap up and told him, &quot;Show Horny why you&#39;re one of the best pets in the house.&quot;<br />
<br />
Horny the unicorn&#39;s knees buckled and sent him to the ground on all fours as Benson&#39;s large tongue licked up and down his crack grazing the massive horsey hole in his rump. Benson spared no time in mounting the felled animal and begin fucking him doggy style on the cold floor.   <br />
<br />
The others in the house took this as a cue to begin plowing in earnest with Ben entering Blake and Mr. Smith calling over Joey to suck him off.  The rest of the group began fucking in earnest except for Cain and his brothers who<br />
Had never stopped.   The party devolved into an orgy with people fucking and being fucked all throughout the living room.  <br />
<br />
Kyle retreated to the room in the house that was his own.  He was still bashful and wanted to jerk his new cock to the video images he had broadcast in there. Quickly, he came and fell asleep, blissfully aware that this was the party to end all parties.  The next morning was a school day with all that entailed and Kyle was looking forward to seeing what his new school had in store for him.</p>
