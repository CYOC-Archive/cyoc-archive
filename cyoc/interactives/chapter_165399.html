<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ella and Cindy dressed quickly and went downstairs. Their parents had arrived with some pizzas, which they ate until they were completely satisfied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me, how was your first day at the new school?&quot; Ella&#39;s father, Paul, asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I am also curious, I hope you have made new friends.&quot; said her mother, Lilian<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t say we&#39;ve already become friends, but I met someone interesting.&quot; Ella said<br />
<br />
&quot;Great. I hope you will become great friends.&quot; Lilian said. After that she got up and started to clear the table.<br />
<br />
Ella decided that she was going to transform her mother first, so she also started to pick things up from the table and went to the kitchen with her mother. They decided that Ella would take out the trash and Lilian would wash the dishes, which Ella did and when she returned to the kitchen, she took advantage of her mother&#39;s distraction.<br />
<br />
Unlike the brother Cindy was, Ella respected her parents, so she programmed so that people would know that her had changed, but that no one would find it strange, and then shot.<br />
<br />
Shortly after being hit, Lilian stopped what she was doing and took her hand to her belly just below her breasts, where she felt a movement and found a second pair of breasts growing there, the new breasts grew until they were 2 cup sizes bigger than the original ones, which also grew to be the same size as the new ones. Soon after, her right shoulder lengthened and opened up and opened for a second head that she grew, followed by a new pair of arms that grew just below the ones she already had. Then her legs split to form a new pair of legs just behind, the split started at the feet and as it went up, it was tearing her pants that could not support the extra legs. When the division of the legs reached her quad, her body began to stretch until her butt stopped two feet behind her, leaving her vagina between her front legs. The transformation was completed when a ponytail grew over her ass and a stick and balls grew between her rear legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, is it just me or are you different?&quot; Ella asked, pretending she didn&#39;t know what had happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just went through a transformation.&quot; said Lilian&#39;s left head &quot;It is nothing to worry about.&quot; said Lilian&#39;s right head, treating her transformation as if it were something common.<br />
<br />
After she finally finished washing the dishes, Lilian tried to turn around to get out of the kitchen, but lost her balance and almost fell, being held in time by Ella.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay mom? Didn&#39;t you get hurt?&quot; Ella asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine, I just tripped over my dick.&quot; said Lilian&#39;s left head &quot;I just haven&#39;t gotten used to this body yet.&quot; said Lilian&#39;s right head<br />
<br />
Ella looked closely at what she had become her mother and saw that she would need to learn to walk better now that she had four legs, not to mention her dick which, even though it grew between her hind legs, was in full erection with its 3 feet long it passed between the legs in front of it. Her new balls were also large, as each of her testicles was the size of a coconut.<br />
<br />
Ella helped her humantaur mother go to the living room, while she was learning to walk with her new body on the way.<br />
<br />
Arriving in the living room, they found Paul and Cindy watching TV. Upon seeing them, Paul said &quot;Is it my impression or have you changed a little dear?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was just a small transformation, nothing that is important.&quot; said Lilian&#39;s left head &quot;I&#39;ll just need new clothes, the old ones won&#39;t fit this body.&quot; said Lilian&#39;s right head, and she showed the nakedness of her bottom and the blouse with holes in the sides, where her new pair of arms passed.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is the least, but I must admit that you were so much more beautiful that way.&quot; Paul said<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, that&#39;s why I love you.&quot; Lilian said with her two heads at the same time and they exchanged a passionate triple kiss. All while precum started dripping from her cock&#39;s tip, which was between Paul&#39;s legs.<br />
<br />
Ella took advantage that no one was paying attention to her and took the transformation gun and shot her father, allowing his transformation to be noticed as well.<br />
<br />
Paul&#39;s transformation was similar to Brad&#39;s, as he became a very beautiful woman with big breasts, F-cup by the choice of Ella. But the most extreme change can not be seen because of his collar, that until he realizes and try to move away from Lilian to see his own transformation.<br />
<br />
As Paul took a step back without warning Lilian continued to hold his camel with her four hands, it made her pull his head, completely separating it from the body.<br />
<br />
With that the last part of the transformation became revealed. Lilian looked in awe at the husband&#39;s female head in her hands, which had a cock at least 11 inches long just below where his/her neck should have been. In addition, Paul still had control of her body, which now had a vagina between her shoulders, even though it was separated from her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Apparently you are not the only one to transform today.&quot; Paul said<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh dear Paul, I can&#39;t take it anymore. My dick has been hard since he grew up and I am very tempted to use it.&quot; Lilian&#39;s left head said &quot;We can go to our room and you can teach me how to use a cock, in exchange I teach you how to use your new vaginas.&quot; said Lilian&#39;s right head<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, but now I&#39;m technically a woman too, you better call me Paula from now on.&quot; Paul said<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever you want.&quot; both Lilian&#39;s heads said at the same time.<br />
<br />
Ella had a hard time just watching this scene with her parents, so she said &quot;Dad, mom, wait a minute. I&#39;m also very excited ...&quot; she made a gesture that makes it clear that she had a hard-on &quot;... so we could do everything as a family right here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her parents thought for a while before answering, but when they saw that Cindy was already transforming into her werewolf form they accepted her invitation.<br />
<br />
Everyone then took off their clothes right there, especially Lilian, who only had what was left of her blouse and Paula&#39;s headless body undressing, making it clear to everyone that she was 100% feminine.<br />
<br />
Then, the family orgy started with Lilian sticking Paula&#39;s dick-neck in her pussy between her front legs, followed by Paula&#39;s body bending down and pushing the pussy between her shoulders against her wife&#39;s cock, making her enter it. Then Cindy chased her mom and started fucking her asshole.<br />
<br />
Ella was the last one to join because, undecided if she was going to fuck the ass or pussy between her father&#39;s legs, she used the transformation gun on herself to grow a second dick and thus fuck both at once.<br />
<br />
Lilian was already on the edge, and being inexperienced in the area, she soon had her first male orgasm. Ella could feel her mother&#39;s hot cum coming, since Paula&#39;s two pussies were connected to her womb, and she also came. Shortly after, it was Paula&#39;s turn to come, making Cindy the last to fill her mother&#39;s ass with cum.<br />
<br />
After that, Ella felt tired. A lot had happened in a single day and she thought it best to go to sleep.</p>
