<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Okay you’ve had your fun, and I guess so have I... so make me straight again!” Pleaded Dave.<br />
<br />
“Okay dad, be straight again,” said Aaron, whose cock was still inside Dave’s ass.<br />
<br />
The look on his dad’s face was now priceless. He was disgusted by his son’s dick being in his ass, but still experiencing aftershocks of intense anal orgasm. On top of that, he couldn’t force his son out of him because of the other commands. Aaron slowly took his penis out of Dave, while relishing the man’s strange expression.<br />
<br />
“Okay dad, you’re straight again. Now I want you to go to the local gay bar and offer every man there to blow a load up your dad-pussy. Don’t come back until you’ve taken at least five different men’s loads,” Aaron commanded.<br />
<br />
“Can’t you at least make me gay for these men so that I can enjoy what I have to do next?” Asked Dave.<br />
<br />
“Where would the fun be in that? Don’t forget to take your cell and answer when I facetime you, no matter what or who you’re doing,” said Aaron.<br />
<br />
Aron took a nap for about an hour while his dad was off prepositioning gay men for anal at the club. When he awoke, he facetimed his dad.<br />
<br />
“What— is— it— son—? I’m kinda— in the mi— ddle of something here,” said Dave, who was getting his daddy cheeks clapped hard.<br />
<br />
“Oh no dad, I was hoping I’d catch you in the middle of something! Show me who’s fucking you, all I can see if your beet red face,” said Aaron.<br />
<br />
Dave complied and faced the camera to the man who was topping him. The man was young, in his twenties, black, and built like an athlete. Aaron could tell that he was enjoying his dad’s man-pussy, but that he was a little confused by Dave’s disinterest. Aaron wanted his dad fucked while being straight for the kinky aspect, but now he wanted to help the younger man out.<br />
<br />
“Dad, be gay now. Be attracted to me like you were before, but also other men, like the one you’re lucky enough to have inside you. And now change the camera angle to yourself,” commanded Aaron.<br />
<br />
His dad complied and as soon as the angle was on himself again, there was a complete change of expression on his face. His little penis also started to get hard, and he began to moan for the man who was balls deep in him.<br />
<br />
Aaron began to jerk off, watching the facetime with his dad as if it were gay porn. It was better than gay porn, this had his actual dad in it. As Dave reached climax with the young man inside him, so did Aaron while jerking off. Aaron commanded Dave come home. <br />
<br />
“Hey dad, hope you got a few loads into that sexy ass,” said Aaron to his dad who’d just walked in.<br />
<br />
“Surprisingly that was the fifth and final when you told me to go home. Although the four before him weren’t very enjoyable aside from the prostate stimulation...” said Dave.<br />
<br />
“Oh, about that, be straight again like you were originally. Now, swap bodies with me,” said Aaron. With impossible requests enabled, Aaron was instantly in his dad’s beefy body.<br />
<br />
“What did you do to me?? That’s my body!” Said Dave from Aaron’s body.<br />
<br />
Aaron massaged his new sore bubble butt. His hands explored his new manly chest and his intimate areas.<br />
<br />
“Stop touching me like that right now young man!” Commanded Dave. Only his commands didn’t hold any weight without the chronivac backing them up.<br />
<br />
Aaron continued his exploration of his dad’s body, taking his pants and underwear down, he then squatted. His dad-ass was faced towards its former owner, and started leaking out five loads of strangers cum.<br />
<br />
“I’m Dave, I take so many men’s loads it’s hard to keep track!” Said Aaron, slapping his ass and taunting his father. Dave’s new face was redder than hell. <br />
<br />
“When I find out how you did all of this, you are in so much trouble young man,” said Dave with an empty threat.<br />
<br />
“For now, let me fuck my ex-ass,” said Aaron.<br />
<br />
Dave was forced to comply and the two went up to the bedroom together. Dave got on his back naked on the bed. His now younger legs went up into the air and he mentally prepared himself for what was next. He was mounted, by his own former body and its five inch cock. The stimulation of Being penetrated made Dave’s new dick hard, despite him being straight again. Aaron pumped him, and invaded his mouth with his new tongue at his leisure.<br />
<br />
When Aaron was close to cumming in his former ass, he commanded his dad switch bodies with him again. Suddenly, Aaron felt his dad’s thick cock in his hole.<br />
<br />
“Okay, now nut in me and don’t exit just yet,” said Aaron, furiously jerking his dick trying to catch up.<br />
<br />
Dave was mortified. First he was penetrated by his own body, and now he was being forced to cum in his son while he was straight. The humiliation made his cock pulse harder, Dave couldn’t control himself as he came in his son’s ass. Aaron’s legs began to buckle and he came himself as well when he saw his dad orgasming inside him.</p>
