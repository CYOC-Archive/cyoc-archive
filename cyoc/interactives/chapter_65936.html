<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Henry liked his name. He only allowed his closest friends to call him Hank.  If anyone else called him Hank, he got upset. He required people to <br />
call him Henry.<br />
<br />
His best friend, Eugene hated his name. He only allowed his closest friends to call him Eugene. If anyone else called him Eugene, he got upset. <br />
He required people to call him Jimmy.<br />
<br />
One day, Jimmy brought an ad he found in the paper. &quot;Look, I may have found a way for us to earn money.&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry said, &quot;By getting a job?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jimmy said, &quot;Well, jobs are scarce right now and neither you or I are qualified for more than the worst jobs anyway. But I found a legitimate job <br />
ad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry said, &quot;Not some goofy scheme like a kissing booth, is it? So what's wrong with this job?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jimmy said, &quot;Well, it does have some risk.&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry said, &quot;I knew it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jimmy said, &quot;But they pay hazard pay. It's a legitimate job.&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry said, &quot;What is it, being a guinea pig for a science experiment?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jimmy was silent.<br />
<br />
Henry said, &quot;It is, isn't it. You want us to sign up to get pumped full of strange drugs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jimmy said, &quot;No, just let me read the ad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry said, &quot;Read it already.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jimmy read, &quot;Wanted: people who want to experience life in the military but who either do not want to be soldiers or don't meet military <br />
standards. Ideal opportunity for weekend warriors. The United States Army will be holding war games in order to experiment with new tactics <br />
and has contracted with TF Industries who wishes to invite civilians to participate to simulate real scenarios involving civilians. Applicants must <br />
be in decent physical health and will be required to live on the military base under similar rules of conduct as if they were soldiers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry said, &quot;Not bad. This is probably the least lame idea you've come up with. But I want to run this by a few people before I agree.&quot;<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
A week later, Jimmy and Henry were on their way to the military base. Along the way, they made friends with a few of the other civilian <br />
volunteers and learned a little more about the job.<br />
<br />
Colonel Stapp announced, &quot;Welcome cadets. Although not officially military we will address you as cadets and you will go through a modified <br />
basic training. We don't have time to give you a full basic training and you won't need it anyway but we will expect you to be able to handle a <br />
gun and perform some espionage and sabotage. We didn't tell you the whole truth before. We are taking you to a secret military base and <br />
essentially we will train you into a guerrilla force for our soldiers to practice on. We will also equip you with guns and equipment so that you <br />
can take soldiers prisoner or mock-kill them. Remember these are war games and we don't want anyone to be hurt but we expect you to play <br />
unfair. We expect you to use any devious and creative methods you can come up with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Colonel Stapp continued, &quot;The real reason for the secrecy is that we have had contact with aliens, so all you conspiracy theorists were right. But <br />
our contact is limited. It takes them light years to travel so they only visit about once a decade. They did leave some technology behind that we <br />
have been studying including some good old ray guns. We are going to equip you with some of this alien technology. You'll have more alien <br />
technology than the trained soldiers as we want to train them in how to deal with a civilian militia trained in guerrilla tactics and using alien <br />
technology. We certainly don't want to make it too easy for our soldiers, do we.&quot;<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The group arrived at camp and after a few days of settling in and learning about the base, they were introduced to the alien technology.<br />
<br />
Colonel Stapp said, &quot;Each ray gun is preset to cause a particular transformation. It is possible to reset a ray gun but we recommend that you <br />
don't attempt any resets. If you mess with the settings, you might accidentally cause serious injury, even death. But there are over a thousand <br />
of these ray guns for you to choose from so you shouldn't need to reset any of them. If the one you have isn't the one you want, simply look <br />
through the supplies till you find the one you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
As the first official day of the war games approached, a guy by the name of Chris Stone quickly showed leadership potential and was promoted <br />
to Sergeant. During our first strategy session, it was just us civilians. We were promised that no military personnel would spy on us so that the <br />
military would not have an unfair advantage.<br />
<br />
Sergeant Stone said, &quot;They want us to be devious and creative. Well I think we should use a few of the ray guns on ourselves. They'll be <br />
expecting humans to come after them but they won't be expecting birds and squirrels.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bill, who was an unofficial second in command said, &quot;We can't all be transformed. The majority of us need to stay human so we can safeguard <br />
our weapons and capture prisoners.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sergeant Stone said, &quot;Agreed, but I'd like to ask for volunteers who'd be willing to be zapped by an alien ray gun. In particular, I was looking at <br />
two ray guns and would like two volunteers, one who wants to be a bird and one who wants to be a squirrel. We'll zap you immediately and <br />
send you on a spying mission before these war games even begin officially. Find out as much as you can and report back to us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Two men named Bob and Sean volunteered. Bob went first and when the ray gun hit him, he seemed to collapse in on himself and his clothes <br />
crumpled into a wad on the floor. They quickly undid the mess and Bob chirped, &quot;What are you trying to do, strangle me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sergeant Stone said, &quot;Well we learned two things about these ray guns. First, they don't affect clothes. They only transform the person. Second, <br />
as I expected from reading about these weapons, those transformed retain their human minds and can speak.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bob's voice did not sound human. He sounded like a bird chirping and singing but his speech could be understood. He could easily imitate a <br />
bird and still communicate with us. Then Bob found a worm and pulled it out of the ground before eating it.<br />
<br />
Bob complained, &quot;Did I just eat a worm? I thought my human mind was supposed to be normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sergeant Stone said, &quot;It is but you also have the thoughts of a bird now so you can imitate a bird more easily.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bob said, &quot;Well as long as I'm a bird. . .&quot;<br />
<br />
Sergeant Stone said, &quot;You should have studied these weapons better. You'll have bird thoughts for the rest of your life, even after you return to <br />
being human. You can train yourself to control your thoughts so you don't start acting like a bird in the middle of the subway but you will <br />
always know how birds think.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Bob came to terms with his new mind, it was Sean's turn. Sean said, &quot;I didn't expect when I signed up for this that I would be learning how to <br />
think like a squirrel but why not. It'll be an adventure. Mind if I undress first so I don't wind up smothered in my clothes?&quot;<br />
<br />
When the naked Sean was zapped, he quickly became a brown fur-ball. The first thing everyone noticed was his new giant tail. Sean flicked it <br />
back and forth and hugged it a few times than in his new squirrel like voice, he chattered, &quot;My tail is as big as me. I can't believe I'm so small. I <br />
can't wait to climb a tree and jump from branch to branch.&quot;<br />
<br />
So Bob the bird and Sean the squirrel were sent off together. The group began breaking up into smaller units. Some units stayed with Sergeant <br />
Chris to be transformed for various missions. Henry and Jimmy followed Bill as he began handing out ray guns and other equipment. There <br />
were enough TF rays that several of them received two.<br />
<br />
Henry asked, &quot;So what did you get?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jimmy said, &quot;I got two shrink rays. The presets say that this one will reduce a person's size by 92 percent in one shot. This other shrink ray only <br />
reduces by one percent per shot so I'd have to hit a person several times before there'd be any noticeable effect. How useful would that be?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hank suggested, &quot;Perhaps we could use it to shrink ourselves so we can crawl into tight places but still be large enough to capture prisoners.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jimmy said, &quot;That might work. So what did you get?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hank said, &quot;I got a flattening ray. The preset says that the flattened person will be flexible like cloth and can be folded and put in my backpack. <br />
My other ray says it's a rubberizing ray. I don't understand what it does except that it says who ever is hit with this ray can be squashed or <br />
reshaped like clay but will reform after an hour. I wonder if I flatten someone and then rubberize them, will they reform flattened or does the <br />
rubberizing ray cancel out the effects of the other rays.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jimmy said, &quot;Let's ask.&quot;<br />
<br />
They asked and Bill announced to everyone, &quot;We do not know for sure whether these rays can be used in combinations or not. That's part of the <br />
experiment. Colonel Stapp said that he believed the rays could be used in combinations. He said that some rays had been used successfully in <br />
combinations but he also said that further testing is required. So does anyone want to be a guinea pig and experience life as a shrunken, <br />
flattened, and rubberized chicken?&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone laughed and no one volunteered.</p>
