<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer shrugged it off and took an article of clothing off the rack and into the changing room, trying not to look too hard at the mouth full of gleaming sharp white teeth for it was Cliff&#39;s favorite animal of them all. a cheetah as this was well made, with soft fabric for it almost felt like velour that what really caught her eyes otherwise was how realistic it was. Come to think of it, some cat were always a reliably sexy option for a costume party as They were such beautiful and clever creatures after all that Cliff should enjoy himself seeing her like this that Jennifer had one day daydreamed about being his cheetah. however, that was when she was a little girl as she&#39;ll be able to fulfill her own childhood dreams, along with Cliff&#39;s!<br />
<br />
just then, Jennifer heard Laika just outside of the the door while accidentally letting the suit out for a little bit of show. “you ok in there?... oh, a cheetah, eh? we don&#39;t normally get people out into one of those around here.” Laika said with a slight chuckle, giving Jennifer a firm pat on the upper door.<br />
<br />
“well, this will surly get Chad’s attention. wouldn&#39;t you agree?” Laika said, now annoying you as Jennifer started to change into the costume by stripping off her clothing first that this also included her bra and panties.<br />
<br />
&quot;well it should. this is one of Cliff&#39;s favorite animals. and also, It’s Cliff…” she said, curating his name out to Laika.<br />
<br />
“Oh! right, sorry about that…” Laika said as she turned away, drumming her claw-like nails onto the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;is there something that you need?&quot; Jennifer ask. wanting to know as to why she was bugging her at this point now.<br />
<br />
“oh, right! you left in there without a pair of clothes for your costume. Have you thought about what you’re going to wear with it?” she said, just as Jennifer was about to ask her to stop.<br />
<br />
“well, actually, I dunno…” Jennifer said, casting aside a glance at what the rows of exotic and colorful costumes. So much was there as there were frills, capes, and even some latex garments. however, it was a bold choice for Jennifer for she had come to rest on the idea on sticking with just the cheetah costume, for now that is.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was just planing to just wear this, for now at least.&quot; Jennifer said as she told her upon her answer, wanting Laika to leave her alone. that way, she can get dressed in the costume that she chosen to wear.<br />
<br />
“very well then. it&#39;s an excellent choice, but it&#39;s yours to make.” Laika said as Her voice snapped Jennifer out of the daydream in which she was having, with the costume on that is for Jennifer was also surprised to see herself smiling when she checked the clock on her smart phone from her pants. it said that Thirty minutes had already passed as there was still no sign of Cliff, Josh, not even Mai.<br />
<br />
“Would you like to try on something else later? If you’re waiting on someone, that’ll pass the time. plus, it’ll be fun.” said Laika as she was flashing Jennifer a toothy smile from the other end of the door, a fanged toothy smile.<br />
<br />
with Jennifer already deciding on trying on her choice of costume then to wait for her friends, as she could continue on shopping some more later that she didn&#39;t want to go home just yet. “Yeah, that’ll do. tell you what, i&#39;ll even ask yeah if I want to try on some different outfits later. is that ok with you?” said Jennifer as Laika simply nodded and left Jennifer along in the changing rooms for they were nothing fancy, just a row of stalls set into a side-hallway.<br />
<br />
Jennifer locked the door behind her while in The changing room, yet the old sliding latch was making just enough noise to be annoying. She took the costume out and unfolded it. She turned it around as she was admiring the spotted black material. Jennifer&#39;s heart rate spiked - there was something about it as she couldn’t put it into words. <br />
<br />
She pulled it over towards her head while taking in a lungful smell of the fabric that It smelt a bit like sweaty gym shirts, but not as strong though. She put it down around her neck for it was firm, but flexible. Jennifer was Curiously wondering why though as there was a small slot in the fabric on the back side, to where the base of the spine would be on the person wearing it that she shortly found out the tail was separated from the suit.<br />
<br />
Jennifer’s hand reached the odd slot in the back of the suit for an idea came to her as she took the rope like cheetah tail and strapped it trough the hole, taking care of the opening while making sure that it line up perfectly with the costume. it was like the most natural thing for it was somehow designed for someone with a tail, which it was meant for it. yet while she was doing this that She was worried for it was going to be too tight, but she somehow knew it was going to fit perfectly snug on her. She finished putting it through, adjusting this so it looked nice and straight as She turned and looked back over at the mirror with the costume just hanging on her shoulders.<br />
<br />
It was a nice touch that they made it actually look like a real life anthro cheetah as it was with female features, instead of just a plane old boron costume of someone being inside a cheetah person. Jennifer smiled as she layed it out and started to slide her feet down one leg into the footpaws, followed by the other leg of the costume for She then tugged the suit of the cheetah up to her waist. before she did anything as she remembered about the tail is when Jennifer shortly fastened a strap around herself, so that it wouldn&#39;t fall out later for she soon after continued on of suiting up.<br />
<br />
while Jennifer slid her arms of the cheetah suit through the sleeves and over her own real arms is when she noticed that the sculpted boob cups in the costume&#39;s chest were much to big on her, but this didn&#39;t matter to her for She could always stuff it with something like Kleenexes as it had the costumer actually sculpted nipples onto the suits boob socks. wait a minute... what? A quick glance downward told Jessica that the suit&#39;s crotch was actually just as anatomically correct with some fetish idea towards the breasts. Whoever designed his thing was obviously having a very dirty mind of thought while making this suit as she soon after was zipping up the back of the furry costume.<br />
<br />
Next, Jennifer pulled on the clawed like gloves over her hands as They fit her perfectly. aside from the overlarge C cup boob socks that the entire costume was as perfectly snug to fit for it almost seemed to hug Jennifer&#39;s body, like it was second skin In fact. the Funny thing is though, Jennifer swore she didn&#39;t remember the costume fitting her this snugly before to when she first zipped it up. She decided to just shrug it off for she was just imagining things as she decided to continue on.<br />
<br />
Finally, it was time as Jennifer slowly donned on the cheetah head that it only made sense for A cheetah girl needed her head piece on. however, it was built very differently than most costume masks that were out there for the jaw chin sleeve strap as it went down under her own. this was connected to the cheetah&#39;s jaw as it was meant to help open up the mouth to the mask more easily that The feeling was unusual while slowly slipping on the mask over her own head. shortly after a couple of adjustments that it  felt just fine, almost natural as her hair was quickly doing more than enough to be tucked down under the artifice while hiding to what&#39;s left of her.<br />
<br />
With the ensemble complete as she was Now fully suited, Jessica admired herself in the mirror of her reflection on the wall. Jennifer turned in place and checked herself out as She indeed look like a very cute cheetah girl that The fit was surprising nice while she admired herself. Damn, she was better than cute for she looked hot! It looked and felt like it had been tailor-made just for her that the way it fit so perfectly well brought out her curves for It even looked slimming, which was very welcome to her.<br />
<br />
There was no way Cliff wasn&#39;t going to give up on having the night of his life the second he saw her looking like this.<br />
<br />
if there were Any doubts that was in her mind were soon gone as Jessica turned around and shook her ass, making the costume&#39;s ropy tail sway that she even grabbed it and swing it around a couple of times. She soon after stood up straighter and gave her reflection an approving finale look down. Jennifer ran one hand up and down the suit as It felt so warm on her, Like it was second skin…<br />
<br />
Suddenly...</p>
