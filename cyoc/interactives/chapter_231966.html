<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">*Around the time Ben and Lucy were in the middle of their rut.*<br />
<br />
Lighting thought on his former mistress’s words about all needing someone to love. The centaur stallion did sigh as his lie about having a mate to deputy Jackson was made in a moment of pique. The Halfling suggesting he was a mare at one time made him see red. The part of being gelded was true; sensing that Epona restored his ability to sire offspring, Lighting took a short trot over to where April was lying unconscious. Lightning noticed that she was being comforted by her former mistress Jenny. Seeing the Halfling cry made him concerned if something happened, but lightning sensed they were tears of joy from Jenny.<br />
<br />
“My gentle mare,” Jenny letting the new Centaur’s head rest on her lap. Jenny placed her blouse on April’s new human torso; covering the new mound of sensitive flesh from the prying eyes of immature boys. This left Jenny only wearing a blue cotton bra on her chest and the riding pants and boots below.<br />
“You are your own being now April,” Jenny running her hands down April’s new blonde hair; “you’ll make a stallion worthy of calling you mate.”<br />
<br />
“Ahem,” Lightning coughing as he watched Jenny comfort the centaur mare softly breathing.<br />
“Oh, Lightning,” Jenny looking surprised before she managed to compose herself; “can you stand in such away so no one watch?”<br />
“Watch what,” Lightning arching an eye as Jenny removes April’s head from her lap.<br />
“As I get April modestly attired,” Jenny motioning to the blouse lying loosely over April.<br />
“Oh,” Lightning shaking his head as he motions for Jenny to move back; “let me.”<br />
<br />
Lightning crouching lightly slaps Aprils face trying to wake her up.<br />
“Come on April wake up,” Lighting getting some reaction.<br />
“Oh, you’re a handsome looking stallion,” April opening her new green eyes; her voice sounding sweet; “were you looking for my mistress?”<br />
“Actually I was looking for you,” Lightning kneeling to stare at the sitting centaur mare; “It was if Epona pulled me to you.”<br />
“Alright you Pashtun looking hunk,” Jenny shaking her head; “let me help April put on the blouse, then you can serenade sweet nothings in her ear.” Jenny helping to guide April in putting on the garment; giving her a chance to get use to using arms for the first time. She helps button up the garments, putting the hard plastic disc thought the loop sewn on the other side of the shirt. Jenny pauses as April shivers as the silk garment brushes over her new pert and sensitive nipples and ample breasts.<br />
“You’ll get use to that,” Jenny smiling at a confused looking April; “and you’ll learn to like being touched there.”<br />
“Thank you my mistress,” April still flexing her new fingers and arms; “but what of you?”<br />
“I’ll make do with my bra,” Jenny standing up; “and don’t call me mistress any more. Just Jenny, okay?”<br />
“Will herd sister work as well,” April standing up on her hooves; once a horse, she was already used to walking on all fours. Finding the new muscles for her human torso interesting, yet a bit stiff and sore.”<br />
“If the way things are going, it will be” Jenny seeing it’s just her and Zoey as the remaining humans of the equestrian team. With them was the last remaining horses also apart of their team; Chris’s stallion Sandy and Zoey’s steed Pegasus to bond with. Jenny turned her head towards the group of stations the were hovering around Sarah and Jessica. ‘Vying for mates,’ Jenny muses; ‘even a few at chatting up the Deputy. I guess becoming a mare is starting to sink in,’ Jenny thinks before April derails her train of thought.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry,” April mustering a weak smile; “it hurts at first but the pain goes away quickly.”<br />
“Let’s take a walk if you up for it,” Lightning offering a hand to April; his smile obviously displaying his intention; Jenny just shakes her head in bemusement and walks off to were Zoey is. <br />
<br />
“Looks like its just us,” Zoey lighting up what looks like to be her last cigarette; She takes a long pull and exhaling slowly before offering a puff to Jenny. “I’m going to miss smoking more than anything else,” Zoey watching the children run about as they wait for the next spectacle.<br />
“Oh what the hell,” Jenny accepting the drag and taking a pull; handing the cigarette back to Zoey as she goes into a coughing fit; “that shit is horrid.”<br />
“Its an acquired taste,” Zoey taking another drag; “like that bottle of Absinthe you managed to smuggle over the Canadian border last year.”<br />
“I didn’t see you complaining,” Jenny taking another puff of the cigarette; “you spent half the night in the dorms thinking you were a green fairy.”<br />
“We almost got busted by the R.A,” Zoey laughing; “no alcohol allowed in the dorms.”<br />
<br />
The two ladies chuckle as they take a few last puffs from the cigarette before Zoey snuffs it out. “I’ve already gave Pegasus a heads up as to my grouchiness as I go through nicotine withdrawl over the next couple of days.”<br />
“So you already staked him as your mate,” Jenny looking at the paint horse more vibrant then the centaur Fred became. “I guess that leaves me with Sandy.”<br />
“Well there is Lighting,” Zoey crumpling the empty cigarette pack and tossing away; “why not talk to him.”<br />
“He already made a move on April,” Jenny sighing loudly; “she just woke up after her change.”<br />
“That was like ten minutes ago,” Zoey perking up; “it took Amanda an hour yesterday for her to wake up after becoming a centaur.”<br />
“I think the more Centaurs there are,” Jenny flicking off her riding boots and ripping off her socks; “the faster the changes take and the less painful they become.”<br />
<br />
“This is true,” a male voice speaking; causing the two girls to turn around. They calm down as the Clydesdale centaur with a crooked smile approaches along with his mate June; a former quarter horse now centaur like him. <br />
“Chris asked me and June to help assist you two for when you change,” Marcus smiling politely.  June approached and offered Jenny a simple tunic. “I found it in our bungalow, I figured April could have used it but I saw you gave her your shirt.”<br />
“Thank you,” Jenny accepting the tunic; wondering if it was made of cotton or hemp, Jenny put it on and noticed how it swallow her frame completely.<br />
“I guess the previous wearer was a massive centaur,” June looking sheepish.<br />
“Looks like it would fit you just fine,” Zoey commenting at June; “you are well built up top after all.”<br />
“And so will you,” June smiling in thanks; “are Sandy and Pegasus nearby?” <br />
<br />
“We are here,” a horse answering as they approach from the side of the barn. “Mistress have you finished poisoning your lungs?”<br />
“Oh Pegasuss,” Zoey blanching in embarrassment; “no need to announce to the world that I smoke. Plus you know I only do that when feeling stressed. And an impending transformation,” Zoey starting to feel a panic attack forming; “regardless as to how calm everyone is, makes this is dam stressful! Does some one have a cigarette on them?”<br />
<br />
“Why did you remove your boots,” Marcus&#39;s comments directed to Jenny as he watches Zoey stomping off to see if any remaining adults have a cigarette or two; “are you sensing you change next?”<br />
“I figured that clothing might cause some of the pain I am to expect with changing,” Jenny debating to remove her pants as well as panties. Trying to determine if the large tunic will provide adequate concealment of her genitals. “I was going to remove my pants next when you showed up.”<br />
“I remember my pants breaking apart when I changed,” Marcus nodding; “they felt very constrictive before the burst and I felt some relief as my rear flanks formed. The tunic should help conceal you if you want to strip some more.”<br />
<br />
“Dam it,” Zoey coming back to where Pegasus and Sandy are; “even that deputy Epona is pissed at doesn’t have any cigarettes.”<br />
“Probably for the best,” June approaching to offer Zoey a hug; “its okay to be afraid, just know that we are here to help you.”<br />
“Tell me,” Zoey accepting June’s embrace; feeling Pegasus approaching behind and giving her a gentle nuzzle on her now equine like ears as he too senses Zoey fear. “Does mating make all the worry, all the stress and uncertainty go away?”<br />
“It will make you feel complete,” June answering; “you will feel at peace with yourself and your new life.”<br />
“as for worry, stress and uncertainty,” Marcus chiming in; helping Jenny as she decides to go with being naked from the waist down as she waits for her transformation. “That is part and parcel with life,” Marcus gently folding the pants, taking care to hid the panties as he places the garments off to the side.<br />
“On earth we would be stressing over grades, worried if our student aid stipends will cover our expenses for the month. Uncertain if we get cut from the team,” Marcus adding; “here those exist but are more simpler.”<br />
“Like what,” Zoey not letting June let her go as she feels comforted by the near crushing hug from the centaur mare.<br />
“Well right now,” Marcus looking out to the nearby fields over run with weeds; despite it being dark out, his vision was much more improved allowing him to see in low light or near pitch black darkness. “Our biggest worry is having enough food and supplies prepared for the winter months, whenever they may come. Our concern is getting the fields ready to plant some crops. And the uncertainty is if we have enough time to grow and harvest them.”<br />
<br />
“Well when you put it that way,” Jenny placing a hand on Marcus’s flank; “Epona should get it over with and change us so we can start sowing crops and eventually siring foals.”<br />
June loosened her embrace from Zoey as the woman has finally calmed down. Giving the woman and friendly nod, she helps Zoey place her shoes and socks next to Jenny’s as she too removes her pants and undergarments. Unlike Jenny, Zoey was unconcerned if the children running about got a view of her changing privates and stood with her legs slightly spread, showing off her shaved pubic mound and exposed entrance.<br />
“Goddess Epona,” Zoey speaking up to the sky; “if you can hear me, please turn me into a member of this Haras. I am ready to begin my new life as a centaur mare and as a mate for Pegasus.”</p>
