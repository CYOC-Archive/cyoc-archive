<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen&#39;s eyes readjust as she feels... wrong. Her head feels too heavy, and she tries to move, to get up, but her body won&#39;t respond as she expects. She tries to sit up, but she falls over. Her face is wet and warm. She opens her eyes, and she&#39;s not looking at her bedroom floor anymore. Instead, she&#39;s looking up at a furry belly. Panic sets in. This isn&#39;t her body!<br />
<br />
Jennifer&#39;s panic grew as she tried to comprehend the new reality she had been thrust into. She felt around her new body and realized that her hands, or rather her new hooves, were attached to the muscular stallion&#39;s legs. With a tremble, she tried to stand, her human body weight unbalancing her at first. But as she found her footing, she managed to get up, her human head bobbing at the end of the stallion&#39;s powerful body.<br />
<br />
Her thoughts racing, she bolted towards the pond she had seen in the field. She needed to look at herself, to understand what had happened. As she reached the water&#39;s edge, she saw the reflection of the creature she had become. There was no head between her shoulders, instead, she saw her head was the tip of her cock. Her stallion&#39;s cock was the size of her old body and it was still rock hard, bobbing and pulsing with every beat of her new heart. She let out a scream, but instead of the horror-filled cry she had intended, a jet of cum shot out of her mouth and landed with a splat in the water. The sound was like that of a horse&#39;s whinny but filled with a human&#39;s despair.<br />
<br />
The feeling of summing through her mouth felt so wrong, but she couldn&#39;t stop the flow of sticky white fluid. It was like her body was no longer her own. Tears streamed down her human face as she tried to make sense of the grotesque reflection staring back at her. She didn&#39;t know how long she stood there, crying and retching cum into the water, but eventually, she had to accept her fate. She had to get home.<br />
<br />
Jennifer&#39;s mind reeled with confusion and fear as she made her way home. Her thoughts were interrupted by an overwhelming need to relieve herself, a sensation that was entirely new and unpleasant. The stallion&#39;s body she had merged with had its instincts, and she was powerless to resist. With a sense of horror, she felt her human mouth stretch and contract as the urine gushed out. It was a strange, alien feeling, one she never thought she would have to experience. The taste was bitter and overpowering, making her want to gag, but she had no control over her new orifice. She couldn&#39;t believe that her mind was now connected to this creature&#39;s bodily functions.<br />
<br />
As she approached her neighborhood, she began to feel a strange sense of pride, or what she assumed was pride, swelling within her. It was a primal, almost animalistic feeling that didn&#39;t quite match her human emotions. The stallion&#39;s body had been created for a purpose, and she had just performed one of its most basic functions. It was a twisted, unsettling victory, but it was something she had managed to do despite the bizarre circumstances. She was still Jen, but she was also something else now.<br />
<br />
The stallion&#39;s instincts grew stronger as she approached her house. She felt a deep yearning, a need to claim a territory, to show dominance. Her heart raced with excitement and fear as she approached her driveway. What would her family think? Would they even recognize her? Would they be terrified or would they accept this monstrosity as their daughter?<br />
<br />
Her new body was telling her to mark her territory, to spray her scent, and let all other male stallions know that she was not to be trifled with. Her mind, however, was still human, and the thought of doing such a thing was repulsive. Yet, she found herself lifting her tail, her human head acting as the tip of the stallion&#39;s cock, and releasing a stream of urine against the mailbox. It was an alien sensation, a mix of disgust and power. The scent of the urine filled her nostrils, a potent mix of her human fear and the stallion&#39;s assertion of ownership.<br />
<br />
Jennifer&#39;s thoughts were interrupted by the sound of the garage door opening. She recognized her mother&#39;s car, the engine purring as it pulled into the driveway. Panic set in again as she tried to decide what to do. Her mother had always been a stickler for manners, and she didn&#39;t think peeing in the front yard was going to go over well. But before she could decide, her mother stepped out of the car, took one look at her, and called out, &quot;Good morning, Jake! You&#39;re up early today!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer&#39;s mind raced. Jake? Why is she calling me Jake? And why does she look so... unbothered by this? The woman bent down to look Jen in the eyes under the stallion&#39;s belly. She was dressed in a business suit, her hair perfectly styled, not a single strand out of place. She was smiling, her eyes filled with a warmth that didn&#39;t match the horror Jen felt.<br />
<br />
&quot;M-Mom?&quot; Jen tried to speak, her voice a mix of a horse&#39;s whinny and a human&#39;s cry. But instead of the words she intended, another jet of cum spurted from her mouth, landing on the pavement with a wet sound. Her mother&#39;s smile never faltered, reaching out to pet the stallion&#39;s flank.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, now, Jake,&quot; she said, using an eerily calm tone. &quot;Let&#39;s get you inside and cleaned up. You can&#39;t go to school looking like that!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen&#39;s mind was reeling. How could her mother be okay with this? How could she call her &#39;Jake&#39; like it was nothing? But the stallion part of her, the alien, cock-headed creature she had become, felt something else. It was a strange mix of fear and... hunger. It wanted to be touched, to be stroked, to be used. It was a need that was overwhelming, a need that she had never felt before. She could feel her stallion&#39;s body&#39;s instincts taking over, pushing her to do things she never would have considered.<br />
<br />
Her mother walked around to the stallion&#39;s side and began to rub her neck, just below where Jen&#39;s human head was now situated at the tip of the stallion&#39;s erect member. &quot;You&#39;re such a good boy, Jake,&quot; she cooed. &quot;You&#39;ve always been my little boy, haven&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen&#39;s mind reeled. Her mother&#39;s touch, combined with the alien urges from her new body, was making it increasingly difficult to think straight. She felt her human consciousness slipping away, being replaced by the primitive instincts of a stallion. She wanted to scream, to beg her mother to make it stop, but all that came out was a series of whinnies and grunts.<br />
<br />
Her mother&#39;s gentle strokes grew more insistent, and Jen could feel the stallion&#39;s body responding. She was horrified to find herself becoming aroused, her cock swelling and throbbing in response. She tried to fight the sensation, but it was like trying to hold back a tide. She was Jake now, and Jake had needs.<br />
<br />
His balls tightened and his shaft grew even thicker as he felt his mother&#39;s hand move down to his cock, her human hand gripping his new stallion flesh. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; Jen&#39;s mind screamed, but all that came out was a soft, needy whinny. &quot;you&#39;re pent up, aren&#39;t you, Jake?&quot; Her mother said. He felt his shaft fill with his testicles seed, the pressure was intense.<br />
<br />
He opened his mouth to protest but instead, a thick rope of cum shot out, spattering against the pavement. After calming down, Jack felt himself calm down his human-sized horse cock retreating into his sheath until his head was the only thing that stuck out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy,&quot; she said, her voice filled with the same love and affection she had always had for her daughter. &quot;Come on, let&#39;s get you inside and cleaned up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake&#39;s human head hung low in defeat as his mother led him into the house, his new stallion body following obediently. The house looked the same, but everything felt foreign and wrong. His room was still his, filled with the same posters and knick-knacks, but the bed was too small for his new frame. His clothes were scattered on the floor, remnants of the life he once knew. His mother didn&#39;t bat an eye, simply moving aside a chair and telling him to lay down while she fetched a towel to clean him up.<br />
<br />
As she left the room, Jake felt a deep sense of confusion and loss. He was no longer the popular cheerleader; he was now a creature that no one would dare to challenge. His thoughts raced as he tried to understand what this curse meant for him. Would he be stuck like this forever? Could he ever be human again? And why was his mother so accepting?<br />
<br />
Her mother returned with a damp towel and began to wipe away the residue of his earlier... indiscretion. The soft cloth felt strange against his sensitive human skin, surrounded by the rough fur of his new form. As she worked, she talked to him as if he was still her little boy, asking about his plans for the day. Jen felt a twinge of anger at the casual way she treated his transformation. It was as if she had always known he was a stallion with a human head.<br />
<br />
The TV in the living room was blaring, and his mother called out over her shoulder, &quot;You&#39;d better get ready for school, Jake. You don&#39;t want to be late.<br />
<br />
Jake? School? He had forgotten about his human life, his school, and his friends. But the mention brought it all rushing back to him. He had to go to school. As a stallion.<br />
<br />
With a sigh that sounded more like a horse&#39;s snort, Jake allowed his mother to finish cleaning him up. He looked around the room, his eyes landing on his book bag. How was he supposed to carry that? He tried to pick it up with his teeth, but his new body was too unwieldy. With a grumble, he slung it over his neck.<br />
<br />
Walking through the house was an ordeal. Every step sent waves of sensation up his shaft, and he had to be careful not to bump into anything with his human face. The feeling of his body moving, the way his muscles rippled under his fur, was strange and fascinating. He felt powerful, yet incredibly vulnerable.<br />
<br />
As he made his way to the front door, his mother called out, &quot;Remember Jake, if you need anything, just whiny. I&#39;ll know what you mean.&quot; She petted him one last time before he stepped outside. The other kids on the block stared as he passed by, but no one said anything. It was like they had always seen him this way. The thought made him shiver, but he had to keep moving.<br />
<br />
Jake&#39;s first challenge was navigating the sidewalk. His stallion body was strong, but his human mind had no experience walking on four legs. He stumbled a few times before finding a rhythm. His head bobbed at the end of his erect penis, giving him a surprisingly wide range of vision. But every time he grew aroused, it was like his mind was swimming in a sea of lust. It was difficult to focus on anything but the throbbing need between his legs.<br />
<br />
At school, the reactions were mixed. Some kids stared in shock, while others treated him like it was just another Tuesday. His old friends from the cheerleading squad waved, not even batting an eye. He was still their friend, their leader. But he was also a walking, talking, human-faced stallion. The whispers followed him through the halls, and his heart raced with each step. He was the center of attention, but not in the way he had ever wanted.<br />
<br />
In class, sitting was a challenge. The human chair was too small for his equine frame, and the desks were too low. He had to fold his legs awkwardly under the desk, his cock sticking out and bobbing slightly with each movement. The sight of his classmates&#39; legs and the scent of the female students in the heat was overwhelming. His stallion instincts were in overdrive, urging him to mount, to claim what was his. Yet, he remained focused, trying to ignore the distractions.<br />
<br />
But the moment the bell rang for lunch, all hell broke loose. His body was now fully erect, his cock sticking straight out, nearly poking the girl in front of him. He felt the warmth of his seed rising, the need to release it. The cafeteria was a minefield of pheromones and temptations. Girls giggled and pointed, some even blushed at the sight of him. The guys looked at him with envy, some with lust in their eyes, others with fear.<br />
<br />
The smell of the food was intoxicating, but not for the reasons anyone else felt. His stallion instincts were telling him to claim his territory, to spray his scent. He tried to fight it, but his human mind was no match for the primal urges. He felt his cock swell further, the pressure building until it was unbearable. He stumbled through the lunch line, his cum shot spurting out uncontrollably, splattering against the floor and the legs of the students in front of him.<br />
<br />
The cafeteria staff, used to the occasional food fight, didn&#39;t even flinch. They just mopped it up and kept serving. The other students, too, acted as if nothing had happened. They stepped over the puddle, some even smiling at him. It was like they had always known him as Jake, the human-headed stallion. His mind was a whirlwind of emotions, his thoughts jumbled with the stallion&#39;s needs and his human fears.<br />
<br />
The rest of the day was a blur. He stumbled through his classes, his mind a haze of lust and confusion. Every time he tried to focus on his schoolwork, his cock would swell and demand attention. The teachers, the same ones who had scolded him countless times before, now spoke to him in soothing tones, patting his flank and offering gentle praise. It was as if his transformation had made him untouchable, a creature to be handled with care.<br />
<br />
After school, the challenge of the locker room was next. His stallion body was used to the openness of a stable, not the cramped metal boxes that held his human clothes. He fumbled with his lock, his cock bobbing with every failed attempt. When he finally opened it, the sight of his clothes brought a fresh wave of despair. How was he supposed to fit into them? The very idea was absurd.<br />
<br />
At cheerleading practice, his new body caused quite a stir. The sight of his human head bobbing at the end of his massive cock was surreal, yet no one questioned it. They accepted him as their captain, Jake.<br />
<br />
As the practice began, he found it increasingly difficult to focus. Every time a cheerleader bent over or stretched, his cock grew longer, pushing the boundaries of his body. He could feel his human mind slipping away, replaced by the urge to breed, to claim his harem. The other girls were oblivious to his struggle, their eyes drawn to the power and virility that his new form exuded. They giggled and whispered as they practiced their routines, their eyes lingering on his impressive length.<br />
<br />
Then, Kyle Perkins, the freshman who had dared him, strolled into the gym. He looked at Jen with a smirk, knowing full well the power he held over her. He whispered something to one of the other girls, who then strutted over to Jake and began to stroke his neck, her hand trailing down to his cock. His body responded immediately, his shaft swelling and pushing out even further. The sensation was too much, and he couldn&#39;t hold back the inevitable. He erupted in a fountain of cum, the force of it spraying the nearby cheerleaders.<br />
<br />
The girls squealed and giggled, wiping themselves off. To them, it was just part of Jake&#39;s charm, the quirky thing their captain did when he got excited. But for Jen, it was a stark reminder of the curse that bound her. Despite her humiliation, she felt a strange thrill at being the center of attention. The stallion inside her reveled in the power, the control it had over the others.<br />
<br />
The rest of the practice was a blur of lust and embarrassment. The cheerleaders continued to flirt with him, touching him in ways that made him even harder. He could feel his human mind fighting to regain control, but the stallion&#39;s instincts were too strong. He was their leader, and they were his to command. When it was time to leave, Kyle approached him with a sly smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;s it going, Jake?&quot; he asked, his voice dripping with malice. &quot;Still enjoying the perks of your new form?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake couldn&#39;t answer, his mind a swirl of human thoughts and stallion urges. He could feel his cock swelling again, the heat building in his balls. He tried to ignore Kyle, to focus on the task at hand, but the scent of the girls and their eager smiles were too much.<br />
<br />
Kyle noticed his struggle and chuckled, his voice a high-pitched giggle. &quot;Looks like someone&#39;s enjoying their new assets,&quot; he said, his eyes gleaming with mischief. &quot;But I guess that&#39;s what you get for being a dick to the wrong freshman, huh?&quot; He leaned in closer, his breath hot in Jen&#39;s ear. &quot;You can&#39;t even speak. What a fitting punishment for the town&#39;s biggest bitch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen felt a surge of anger, and with it, a strange clarity. Her mind was still her own, trapped in this freakish body. With a grunt and a twitch of his hips, she managed to force out the words, &quot;Transform or Dare?&quot; The challenge hung in the air like a dare itself, a challenge to the very fabric of reality that Kyle had woven around her.<br />
<br />
Kyle&#39;s eyes went wide with fear as he realized the weight of his own words. He had never expected Jen to be able to speak, let alone issue the curse back at him. He stumbled backward, his voice cracking as he said, &quot;T-transform.&quot; The word was barely a whisper, but the power of the curse didn&#39;t care about volume. It had heard.</p>
