<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate Anderson finished having supper with Alex Ramsey and his parents. While nervous about the event in general, and even more so after the &quot;first impression&quot; he made with Mister Ramsey downstairs in their basement, Nate found himself agreeing with Alex that his parents were &quot;cool&quot;. Who had the cooler parents was debatable, but it wasn&#39;t a question he would ever raise.<br />
&quot;And if it&#39;s okay with you, my folks have invited Alex over for dinner tomorrow night,&quot; said Nate, as they were having ice cream for dessert.<br />
&quot;Fine with me,&quot; said Peyton Ramsey, while looking at his wife.<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; agreed Shelly Ramsey, while turning to look at her son. &quot;So Alex, have you two set a date yet?&quot;<br />
&quot;A date? For what?&quot; asked Alex cautiously. It was way too soon for anyone to be considering china patterns and gift registries yet.<br />
&quot;To go on your actual first date, silly,&quot; replied his mother. &quot;You two just met Saturday night and this is only Monday night, so unless there&#39;s something you know that we don&#39;t...&quot; she said, letting her voice trail off as she stared at her son.<br />
&quot;Not that I&#39;m complaining about the time we have had, but I would like to start experiencing some normal social outings,&quot; replied Nate. &quot;It&#39;s been a pretty world-wind weekend as it is with becoming a werewolf, falling in love with you, and fighting off a rogue were-vixen,&quot; he added, while staring at his boyfriend.<br />
&quot;Okay. I get the message,&quot; said Alex, knowing it was better to quit while he was behind. &quot;How about Wednesday night?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll tell you boys what. Make it Friday night, and I&#39;ll loan Alex the family car with a full tank of gas,&quot; offered his father. &quot;But you two have to be back here in time for breakfast Saturday morning.&quot;<br />
<i>BREAKFAST?</i> thought Alex. <i>But that was—</i> and then Alex smiled at the realization of what his father was <i>truly</i> offering him: a full night alone with Nate!<br />
&quot;We accept!&quot; Alex said quickly. &quot;But if you will excuse us, I still have to walk Nate home and come back so we both have time to finish our homework before bed. I don&#39;t know what else Nate may have, but we have science together and you know how Mister Johnson is.&quot;<br />
&quot;He&#39;s still teaching?&quot; asked Peyton. &quot;Your mother and I both had him when we were in high school, and he looked like he should have retired then.&quot;<br />
&quot;Johnson is a were-mule dear, remember?&quot; asked Shelly. &quot;Probably just as stubborn now as he was then, but don&#39;t either of you boys ever repeat that!&quot; she warned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where do you live?&quot; asked Peyton, as the boys got up from the table.<br />
&quot;Walking wise, on the other side of the hill behind your house,&quot; replied Nate.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s closer than I thought,&quot; commented Mrs. Ramsey.<br />
&quot;Okay Alex. You be a gentleman and see your date home, but don&#39;t forget to be back here by curfew since it&#39;s a school night,&quot; Mr. Ramsey reminded him.<br />
Alex took a quick look at the kitchen clock and saw it was only a little after eight. With his curfew being ten...<br />
&quot;Come on Nate, let&#39;s get going,&quot; said Alex, as he anxiously grabbed his boyfriend&#39;s hand and started to escort him out the back door.<br />
&quot;Nice to have met you Mister and Mrs. Ramsey,&quot; said Nate.<br />
&quot;Peyton and Shelly,&quot; Mrs. Ramsey reminded him. &quot;And I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be seeing a lot more of you Nate. Bye for now.&quot;<br />
As the back door closed behind the departing boys, Shelly turned to her husband and asked, &quot;Remember when we first met and fell in love?&quot;<br />
&quot;I sure do,&quot; he replied, taking her hand in his. &quot;And it&#39;s nice that Alex finally has someone in his life. Now then, on to other things. I was thinking that the sooner we get this kitchen cleaned up for the night, the sooner we can go to our room and...&quot; with that, Peyton let his voice trail off as he leered at his wife.<br />
Shelly smiled and let out a small howl of encouragement as she stood and started clearing the table.<br />
<br />
As they crossed the Ramsey property line into the open stretch of forest between the two subdivisions, Nate started to ask what was going on when Alex explained everything to him. Nate smiled at the implications of now and Friday night, then stopped to kiss Alex as they reached the top of the hill that marked the halfway point between their houses.<br />
&quot;I get so horny around you, there are times when I can barely control it,&quot; admitted Nate, as he pulled his lover&#39;s shirt off and started running his hands across Alex&#39;s hairy chest.<br />
&quot;Probably your increased werewolf libido, coupled with how long you went without between Minnesota and your induction ceremony,&quot; commented Alex, as he rendered Nate topless too. Being a recently created werewolf, Nate didn&#39;t have much chest hair, but Alex still found the patch enjoyable as he started caressing it.<br />
&quot;Well, I definitely intend to make up for lost time, but I do have one request,&quot; said Nate, even as he started unbuckling Alex&#39;s pants.<br />
&quot;Name it stud,&quot; replied his boyfriend, as Alex reached down to cup Nate&#39;s growing cock.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve experienced plenty as the wolf, and thrill at your furry touch, but at least once, please take me as I am right now,&quot; he requested, as Nate kicked off his shoes and dropped his pants.<br />
Completely undressed, the two teenagers laid naked in the grass, and began orally making love to each other&#39;s penis in their regular human forms. Alex soon felt his boyfriend was close, but needed a little push as he stuck a finger up Nate&#39;s ass hole. Nate shuddered and came in Alex&#39;s mouth, even as he stuck a finger up his lover&#39;s ass to return the favor.<br />
<br />
Finished, for the moment, Alex and Nate embraced again, kissing and tasting each other. Then Nate asked Alex to get on all fours. &quot;I want to repeat that experiment we conducted earlier, but this time you hold the wolf in as long as possible before we orgasm together.&quot;<br />
&quot;Certainly, stud,&quot; agreed Alex, as he felt the head of Nate&#39;s cock penetrate him.<br />
Alex&#39;s human fingers dug into the soft earth even as Nate started picking up the pace, need as much as passion driving him onward.<br />
Alex wanted to howl and release the wolf within, even as he felt Nate&#39;s cock growing larger. <i>He&#39;s already changing!</i> realized Alex, as he felt Nate&#39;s furry pelt start to rub against his bare butt cheeks.<br />
&quot;Soon!&quot; Nate growled, even as his face finished transforming and his enlarged red rocket drove even deeper into his boyfriend.<br />
&quot;YES!&quot; Alex howled, unable to hold back the wolf any longer. Dark fur started spreading across his whole body as he moved his hips in time with Nate, encouraging him to go faster and deeper with every thrust.<br />
Soon, two werewolves in love howled their mutual passions for all to hear as they experienced orgasmic bliss together.<br />
<br />
Spent, they laid in the grass together and embraced each other, gently kissing and licking each other&#39;s muzzles.<br />
Although neither meant to, they dozed off together in each other&#39;s furry arms, which is how Ben Twist found them as he approached the hollow tree to collect his backpack on his way home for the night.<br />
&quot;You two look happy,&quot; said Ben, staring down at his friends, his voice waking them up from the light sleep they were in.<br />
&quot;We are,&quot; replied Nate, as he nuzzled his lover&#39;s furry neck. &quot;What time is it?&quot;<br />
&quot;About 9:30,&quot; answered Ben, after checking the cellphone around his neck. &quot;I&#39;ll see you guys in school tomorrow. Night,&quot; he said, before resuming the walk to his house.<br />
&quot;Guess we better call it a night,&quot; Nate said reluctantly, as he changed back to his human form and started looking for his clothes.<br />
&quot;Guess we should,&quot; agreed Alex, giving Nate&#39;s wet penis a couple of quick licks to clean it before he resumed his human shape.<br />
&quot;Say, do you smell something?&quot; asked Nate, while putting his pants back on.<br />
&quot;You mean besides the smell of hot werewolf sex?&quot; inquired Alex. &quot;Yeah. Ben was with...&quot; then gave the air another sniff before saying, &quot;a were-panthress tonight.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s interesting. I didn&#39;t know there were any in the area,&quot; replied Nate, while pulling his shirt back on.<br />
&quot;There ain&#39;t. At least none in the high school,&quot; commented Alex, as he stood, topless once more, next to his boyfriend.<br />
&quot;Then I guess Ben had as good a time tonight as we did,&quot; said Nate. &quot;I&#39;ll see you in school tomorrow handsome,&quot; before he kissed Alex on the lips.<br />
&quot;Handsome?&quot; asked Alex, after they finished kissing.<br />
&quot;Well, you keep calling me stud, and you are handsome,&quot; explained Nate.<br />
&quot;Appreciate that,&quot; said Alex, before embracing Nate and kissing him again.<br />
Then Alex took a step back from Nate and said, &quot;I think I better get home before I accidentally start something we don&#39;t have time to finish,&quot; while looking down at the growing bulge in Nate&#39;s pants. &quot;Night stud.&quot;<br />
&quot;Night handsome,&quot; said Nate, as they reluctantly parted company.</p>
