<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Professor Nova had been following Polly on Animalia Ambassadoria for quite a while. She found Polly&#39;s scientific inquiry and journalism admirable. Nova hoped that she might become a scientist after she finished her education. In fact, Nova was often asking Marcy questions about Polly and her family. Nova had always considered herself a loner, her reputation for &#39;crackpot&#39; theories making it easy for her to avoid people. But she was surprised when she realized how social she was becoming. Which made sense if the aliens who created or at least influenced the creation of the Animalian virus wanted Animalians to form a strong community. It may be the reason why criminals are easier to reform after becoming Animalians. Though that theory could only be tested if a serious criminal was converted, and considering the tenuous position Animalia was in under the current presidency, it wasn&#39;t likely to happen any time soon.<br />
<br />
Nova was also finding herself reach besides learning more about Marcy&#39;s family. Her trip to Ao Guang had been mostly to investigate the Spirit Grove. There had to be a scientific explanation about why electronic devices ceased to function once within the bamboo grove. Said explanation was obviously aliens, at least obvious to Nova. However, since her equipment couldn&#39;t work in the grove, there was little tangible proof she could find. Still, she was determined to investigate what she could and ended up finding more than she expected.<br />
<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Bereft of her electronic equipment, Nova had to rely on something more archaic to investigate. Writing in a notebook felt so old-fashioned, but at least spies wouldn&#39;t be able to read her handwriting. &quot;Without my equipment, I can only rely upon what my eyes can tell me. I suppose I could have taken soil and water sample, but I haven&#39;t done old-school chemistry since, well, high school,&quot; said Nova as she wrote, &quot;However, I can observe that there is a strange feeling of restfulness and peace here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Obviously. The spirits would want this to be a place of calmness.&quot; Nova looked up to see a cobra Animalian slither into the clearing. Offhandedly, she look like she could be a goth, the way she was dressed all in black, the piercings in her hood, the black makeup on her face. Though she also had a certain broadness to her shoulders that made Nova suspect she might be a hermaphrodite.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh please, do you think these woods are haunted?&quot; asked Nova in disbelief.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you mean the spirits of the dead, no,&quot; said the cobra, &quot;Someone would have had to die here first and there&#39;s no proof anyone lived on this island before it was settled. I&#39;ve done the research.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you actually research?&quot; asked Nova dryly, &quot;I thought you mystics made it up as you go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;First off, I&#39;m a spiritualist, not a mystic,&quot; said the cobra, &quot;Second, I was referring to spirits of nature.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh please. Fairies of the forest?&quot; asked Nova derisively.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy,&quot; said the cobra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shakespeare&#39;s Hamlet. At least you&#39;ve read something meaningful,&quot; said Nova.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what&#39;s your theory about what&#39;s going on here?&quot; asked the cobra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alien activity,&quot; said Nova.<br />
<br />
&quot;And do you have any proof of that?&quot; asked the cobra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...no,&quot; said Nova.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I don&#39;t have real proof of spirits here. But I should think this would be a place that spirits would go to if there were any,&quot; said the cobra.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is...tranquil. Though there&#39;s probably an alien ship buried here somewhere,&quot; said Nova.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope you&#39;re not thinking of digging up this forest to find it,&quot; said the cobra.<br />
<br />
&quot;With only a shovel? Hardly. Not worth my time. And this is place is too nice to demolish,&quot; said Nova.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just glad the inn they built here isn&#39;t so obstructive,&quot; said the cobra, &quot;I&#39;m Xinxing by the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Professor Nova,&quot; said Nova, &quot;Would you care to continue this conversation in private?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s very private here,&quot; said Xinxing, gesturing around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but I can only stay away from electronics for so long,&quot; said Nova.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know what you mean,&quot; said Xinxing, &quot;This forest is peaceful, but there&#39;s not much to do here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can think of a few things to do,&quot; said Nova.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
As it turned out, Nova was correct about Xinxing being a hermaphrodite. And shi was also feeling the same itch that Nova was feeling. Nova hadn&#39;t had a lot of time to deal with her enhanced Animalian libido asides from the occasional self-administration. But as long as she was on Ao Guang, she might as well have one fling.<br />
<br />
Xinxing had hir tail wrapped around Nova&#39;s legs as shi thrust inside of her. Nova wasn&#39;t fully sure if she was into women before, but there was something hypnotic about the way Xinxing&#39;s breasts bounced. It might be the piercings in hir nipples. Her own breasts were getting their own attention. Xinxing was rather gifted with her mouth. Having a cobra&#39;s fangs so close to a sensitive body part would normally make one pretty nervous, but Xinxing was licking Nova&#39;s nipple with experienced skill. Nova had a feeling Xinxing was close by the frequency of hir thrusting and the pulsing of hir hemipenises. Anyways, Nova was reaching the pinnacle of her own pleasure. She clenched her vagina, which soon pushed Xinxing over the edge. Fortunately, shi had condoms designed for serpents.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how was that, little mongoose?&quot; asked Xinxing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;d be more comfortable if I weren&#39;t so restricted,&quot; said Nova.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just be glad I&#39;m not a constrictor,&quot; said Xinxing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am curious about whether you were a man or a woman before converting,&quot; said Nova.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, let&#39;s that&#39;s for me to know and you to figure out,&quot; said Xinxing.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want to spend more time together?&quot; asked Nova.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, since neither of us are likely to find anything about the grove and we&#39;re on a tropical island, why not have some fun?&quot; asked Xinxing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you implying I don&#39;t know how to have fun?&quot; asked Nova.<br />
<br />
&quot;You seem like the type to stay cooped up in a lab all day working out theories about aliens,&quot; said Xinxing.<br />
<br />
Nova was a bit surprised to feel a little color in her cheeks, though thankfully her fur hid that. &quot;Well, I suppose a little rest and relaxation would be good for my mental stress,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, so let&#39;s go enjoy some of the sights, take some pictures,&quot; said Xinxing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, before that...&quot; Nova managed to shimmy her way out of Xinxing&#39;s coils before going to her bed stand. She picked up her phone and started the camera on it. &quot;How about we go again?&quot; asked Nova.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? You want a sex tape of us?&quot; asked Xinxing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Call it a souvenir,&quot; said Nova, &quot;But this time, I&#39;m on top.&quot;</p>
