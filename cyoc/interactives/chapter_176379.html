<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You know, even though Terry and Gabe use to be some of the most muscular guys at the high school, it was amazing to Danny just how bad their lifting form was. To be fair, this gym had more equipment than a high school gym, and they did at least have the basics down. Still, Danny had to wonder if their former arrogance made them ignore the coach&#39;s advice or not do any research and just rely on their natural strength to get by.<br />
<br />
Ironically though, the fact that they had such bad form was quite useful to Danny. While trying to fix their lifting form, he told them to use lighter weights. This helped to hide the fact that their bodies were slowly weakening from them. It also led to some interesting situations. For example, what happened while he was teaching Gabe how to properly use the Lat pulldown machine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, Gabe, put your arms like this and make sure the bar goes all the way down to your chest. You really feel it in your back now?&quot; Danny instructed as he got close to Gabe to fix his form. He had put a hand on Gabe&#39;s back to help correct his technique.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I can really...uh, y-yeah, I can really f-feel it.&quot; Heh, Gabe had started stammering and turning red as soon as he realized how close Danny had gotten to him. <br />
<br />
It looks like the sexuality changes were right on track, Danny thought. He thought that was especially true that to be the case when he was teaching the two how to do squats correctly. Even though he couldn&#39;t see what they were doing while they were behind him, he knew that both of them were staring at his glutes. It wasn&#39;t the first time someone at this gym started at him while doing squats, after all. Heh.<br />
<br />
Oh, but it wasn&#39;t just the Asian Adonis that the two were becoming attracted to. During a water break, Gabe had started to voice these thoughts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude! All the guys at this gym are so ripped. That blond guy over there&#39;s arms are so huge, and the pecs on that guy are just, wow. Even the older guys are ripped.&quot; Gabe told Danny. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I choose this gym, not only because of the location but because it had great equipment. I think I&#39;ve gotten pretty ripped here too.&quot; The Asian Adonis had flexed his meaty arm after saying that, causing Gabe to blush as he nodded in agreement. It was funny that the changes seem to be making Gabe shyer while not reducing his libido at all.<br />
<br />
Terry, in contrast, was staying his bold self. He was actually chatting up a guy during the break. It was one of the regulars that Danny had seen around the gym before. He didn&#39;t want to intrude, but he could guess at what was being said. It seems like he was commenting on the regular&#39;s workout gear and flirting by asking for something like workout tips. Oh? Now the regular was flexing for him, and Terry was feeling him up. Oh my, Terry.<br />
<br />
Once Terry finished talking to the regular, Danny walked up to him and asked, &quot;You seem to be getting pretty with that guy. Did you get his number or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Oh, uh, but just so we can work out together sometime.&quot;  Terry responded. Danny smirked at this. Sure, it&#39;s just working out together, Terry, sure.<br />
<br />
In the end, while Danny couldn&#39;t work out as hard as he wanted to, since he had to correct the two&#39;s forms, Danny could say he enjoyed this session. It was a shame that the tips that he gave to them were ultimately going to be pointless as they&#39;ll be twinks soon enough.<br />
<br />
...Although it wasn&#39;t all fun. This was the first time Danny had been to this gym since all this started, and working out with others here reminded him of his former best friend, Jackson. They used to work out at this gym together, pushed each other to the limits. He had a lot of good times with him here. <br />
<br />
Of course, thinking of his ex-best friend was also resurfacing memories of his ex-girlfriend. How they first met, how his father teased them about getting married. God, he hasn&#39;t even told his family they broke up yet.<br />
<br />
Danny was feeling a bit depressed for a moment, but then quickly shook it off. He didn&#39;t need them anymore. What he need were friends that didn&#39;t break his trust and respected him. Sure there was a hole where those two had been, but that hole will mend when better people come into his life. Like maybe he can have his brother be his workout partner in the future. He&#39;ll have to teach him how to lift though and flex because Jin&#39;s poses were kinda bad.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it was time for the three of them to hit the shower.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------<br />
<br />
As Danny was trying to shower off, he started to hear giggling and moaning. He was sure that those voices belong to Terry and Gabe. It sounded like they were messing around, but he wasn&#39;t sure if they were doing it alone, together, or with another gym-goer.<br />
<br />
Sounds like they were having fun... oh. Danny had looked down to see that his junk was standing at full mast. Why did these transformations turn him on so much? <br />
<br />
He needed to take care of this now, but as he tried imagining hot chicks to jack off too, all of them happen to have Sasha&#39;s face. No! He needs to get her out of his head. But still being able to hear the moans and giggles Terry and Gabe were making, all he could imagine those two on their knees giving Danny the blow job of his life.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmh,&quot; Danny moaned. To his surprise, imagining this scene made him jack off quicker and quicker until...<br />
<br />
&quot;Ack!&quot; Danny yelped as the hot water suddenly turned fridged. Crap! He forgot that if you don&#39;t set it correctly, the showers will turn off the hot water automatically after a certain period. Oh, and he was so close too... Oh well.<br />
<br />
After the shock of the cold water wore off, Danny was able to fully process what he just imagined. At this point, he decided to pretend that didn&#39;t happen or at the very least blame the break-up for making him desperate. Though he probably can&#39;t ignore these new feelings that have been building up for too long.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------<br />
<br />
After the shower incident, Danny said his goodbyes to the two and left, imagining the further changes that would happen at school tom- Oh wait! Today was Friday, there wasn&#39;t going to be school tomorrow. How did he forget that? Danny guessed that he had been so excited about revenge and transformations, the weekend just slipped his mind.<br />
<br />
Well, this was a problem. Danny was going to miss two whole days of Gabe and Terry&#39;s transformation. So, that means they would be on day 4 or 5 of their transformation the next time Danny will see them. What was he going to do? He could try figuring out what they were going to do for the weekend, but at that point, he would be stalking them.<br />
<br />
Although, maybe it was also time to take a break from the observation? His father did say that he should stop caring about what other people thought of him and take some time for himself. Sure the situation was different now, but maybe he should take a break from the jocks and drama and spend some time for himself. He could catch up on homework, spend some time with the family, and just relax for a bit. Sure, he&#39;ll miss some of Gabe and Terry&#39;s transformation, but that just means witnessing a bigger transformation on Monday.<br />
<br />
At the same time, he was still so interested in observing Gabe and Terry&#39;s changes. Maybe it wouldn&#39;t be so weird to just happen to run into one or both of them over the weekend. <br />
<br />
Ah, decisions, decisions.</p>
