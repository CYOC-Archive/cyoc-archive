<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ken smiles to himself as he admires his new body in the wall-mirror, “we look so amazing,” he says, “we look so majestic, like a true ruler, all we need now is just a queen, what do you say Jeff?”<br />
<br />
Jeff of course is unable to say a word, but he couldn’t even if he could, the teen is just stunned and shocked at what has happened to him, staring at what has become of his body, of himself, now nothing more than just a part of his former friend’s body.<br />
<br />
“I knew you’d agree,” Ken says, smiling, then a sudden knock on the door draws Ken’s attention to it, “yes? Come in,” he says.<br />
<br />
The door opens and two boys enter a 12-year-old who looks just like Jeff: black hair, brown eyes and an athletic figure. The other boy who looks to be 11 or 10 has short blond hair, blue eyes and an athletic figure.<br />
<br />
Both boys blush and look nervously at Ken as they enter, “hey… Ken,” the boy with black hair says, “ha-have you seen Jeff? We wanted to ask if he’d like to join us in doing some parkour”.<br />
<br />
Ken gives the boys a smile, “well, hello Kyle and… Will, I believe,” he asks, turning to the blond boy, who nods.<br />
<br />
Kyle, who is the brother of Jeff, looks at Ken, “have you seen Jeff,” he repeats his question.<br />
<br />
Ken looks at Kyle, “sorry, Kyle,” he says, “I haven’t seen him since he and I played one of his new games. Knowing him he decided to head to his girlfriend’s place without telling anyone”.<br />
<br />
Kyle rolls his eyes, “that is so typical of him,” he groans.<br />
<br />
“KYLE! WILL! GET OUT,” Jeff shouts in his mind.<br />
<br />
Ken continues to smiles, “say you two,” he says, “why are you looking so shy and nervous?”<br />
<br />
The two boys look at each other, then turn back to Ken, “because… because you are always naked,” Kyle says, Will just nods.<br />
<br />
Ken chuckles, “well, we dragontaurs, we don’t wear clothes,” he says.<br />
<br />
“We know,” Kyle says, “it… it’s still weird”.<br />
<br />
Ken smiles, “maybe it would feel less weird if you two were naked too,” he says.<br />
<br />
The two boys blush harder and look at each other, “DON’T LISTEN TO HIM,” Jeff mentally screams, “GET OUT WHILE YOU STILL CAN!”<br />
<br />
Ken, sensing that the boys seem to consider it, smiles, “what’s the big deal,” he asks, “we are all boys here, there is nothing to be ashamed of”.<br />
<br />
Unaware to the boys, Ken has already got them under his power, “he… he’s got a good point,” Kyle says.<br />
<br />
“I… I agree,” Will says.<br />
<br />
Both boys turn to Ken and slowly begin to strip, removing their shirts before kneeling down to take their shoes of, then straightening and open their pants, pulling them down along with their boxer briefs.<br />
<br />
“WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU GUYS DOING,” Jeff yells mentally, of course no one hears him, “GET OUT NOW!”<br />
<br />
Soon both boys are naked, blushing hard, “well, doesn’t that feel so much better, boys,” Ken asks, smiling as he admires the boys athletic figures.<br />
<br />
“A-actually,” the boys say, “yeah… yeah it does”.<br />
<br />
Ken smiles, “I must say,” he says, “you two have amazing bodies”.<br />
<br />
Kyle and Will smile a little, looking proud, “all thanks to our parkour,” Kyle says.<br />
<br />
Ken nods, “I can see all that running, climbing and jumping surely pays off”.<br />
<br />
Both boys smile and nod, “yep, it’s a great workout,” they say.<br />
<br />
Ken smiles, “however, you’d look so much better if you were joined together,” he says.<br />
<br />
The boys tilt their heads, “what do you mean, Ken,” they ask.<br />
<br />
“How closer are you two,” Ken asks in return.<br />
<br />
Both boys look confused at each other, “I’d say… we are pretty close, right Will?”<br />
<br />
Will nods, “yea”.<br />
<br />
“That’s good,” Ken says, “but… wouldn’t you want to be closer?”<br />
<br />
“Of course,” the two boys say.<br />
<br />
Ken smiles, “well, I can help you become… inseparable,” he says.<br />
<br />
“How,” the boys ask.<br />
<br />
Ken smiles wider, “I can show you,” he says, “that is if you want me to”.<br />
<br />
The boys look at each other, then back at Ken and smile, “please show us!”<br />
<br />
“NO, KEN DON’T YOU FUCKING DARE,” Jeff mentally screams.<br />
<br />
“Well, first, Will, you have to get down on your hands,” Ken says.<br />
<br />
“That… that’s weird,” Will says, “but if that helps us to become closer… what the hell,” and he lowers himself onto his hands.<br />
<br />
“Now what,” Kyle asks, “how is this gonna help us get closer to each other?”<br />
<br />
“Stand in front of Will, Kyle,” Ken instructs, “then lift your right foot and step gently on Will’s hand. Once the sole of your foot makes contact with Will’s hand, your foot and his hand will merge together, once that’s done you repeat it with your left foot and Will’s left hand”.<br />
<br />
Kyle and Will look at each other, “will it… hurt,” they ask.<br />
<br />
Ken smiles, “no, it will feel good for both of you, I promise”.<br />
<br />
“Alright,” Kyle says before turning his back to Will and gently steps onto Will’s hand.<br />
<br />
When Kyle’s foot makes contact with Will’s hand both boys feel a warmth spread through their limbs, their eyes widen as they watch Kyle’s foot seem to melt around Will’s hand, “w-whoa,” both say.<br />
<br />
“This… this feels weird,” Kyle says.<br />
<br />
“Y-yeah… but… kinda good,” Will says.<br />
<br />
Ken smiles, “see? Told you so,” he says, “now, Kyle, repeat the same with your left foot”.<br />
<br />
Kyle nods and soon Will’s hands are both connected to Kyle’s feet, “now what,” Will asks, looking up at Ken.<br />
<br />
Ken smiles, “now, Will, your arms will become the same length as your legs,” he says, “then your body will stretch a little, while that happens, your arms will merge with Kyle’s legs and your shoulders will merge with Kyle’s hips and finally your neck will merge with Kyle’s butt”.<br />
<br />
“KEN! YOU MOTHERFUCKING CRAZY SICK ASSHOLE,” Jeff mentally shouts as he watches his brother and Will merge just like he had with Ken, but instead of suffering, the kids seem to be enjoying it, both of them moaning softly, their cocks hardening.<br />
<br />
“So, how are you two feeling,” Ken asks once the second part of the merge is over.<br />
<br />
“A little weird,” Will says, “I mean, I can’t move at all and feeling Kyle’s balls on my head is… well a little icky… but other than that… I at least feel fine. What about you Kyle?”<br />
<br />
“I feel amazing, Will! I can feel your body as if it were mine” Kyle says smiling, then giggles, “and you look silly between my legs”.<br />
<br />
Ken smiles, “shall we continue?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” the boys say.<br />
<br />
“What would you boys think if you’d look like me,” Ken asks.<br />
<br />
Both boys eyes widen, “that would be awesome,” both say at once.<br />
<br />
Ken smiles, wagging his tail, while Jeff continues to scream non-stop as he can only watch hopelessly as Ken manipulates and alters his brother and friend. The dragontaur looks at the two boys, “I think orange scales with black stripes as main scales and white scales for the underside of your lower body would look great”.<br />
<br />
“Like a tiger,” the boys ask.<br />
<br />
Ken nods and smiles, “yup, what do you think?”<br />
<br />
The boys beam, “we love the idea,” they say.<br />
<br />
Ken nods, smiling wide, “then so be it,” he says, “while your scales replace your skin, a long thick and prehensile tail will grow from your back, your lower body’s crotch, hips and butt will merge with it, and two wings, big enough to carry your body will grow from your lower body’s shoulders”.<br />
<br />
The boys moan in pleasure as the changes sweep over them, and in a matter of minutes a second and much younger dragontaur is standing in Jeff’s room.<br />
<br />
Ken smiles, “already looking so good,” he says, circling the boys before stopping in front of them and lowering himself to Will’s level, leaning in to whisper into the boy’s ear, “Will, when I stand straight, you will lick my frontal slit”. The dragontaur straightens up and grins when he feels Will’s tongue lick his slit, Jeff’s mouth, “Kyle… god… so good,” he moans, “you… you have no use for your… grrr… cocks anymore. Your lower body’s cock… mmmnnn… grrr… will become a virgin female dragon’s pussy. Your chest will… grrr… grow into… two amazing C32 breasts, and… W-Will’s head will… grrr… become your… frontal pussy”. When Ken feels his cock, Jeff’s tongue slide out his slit and into Will’s mouth, the dragontaur begins to thrust as Will’s head and face shrink and melt to Kyle’s crotch, soon Will is gone and Ken is thrusting in and out of a pussy.<br />
<br />
Kyle moans in pleasure as he… SHE… feels the changes wash over her, “K-Ken… oh… god… so… so good,” she moans, her voice becoming softer, more like a girl’s as two C32 tits grow from her chest.<br />
<br />
Ken smirks, “you will forget all about Will,” he says, “as will everyone else, Will never existed for neither of you. You have always… been… grrr… a female… dragontaur… MY female… your name… is Kelly… everyone who knows you… will remember you as MY female and not as Kyle Davis!”<br />
<br />
“I… I’m Kelly… your female,” Kyle… Kelly moans, wrapping her arms around Ken as he fucks his newly created female, grinning happily to himself.</p>
