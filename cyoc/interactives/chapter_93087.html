<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Game Master doesn&#39;t seem inclined to take pity on you, and you really need this job.  While it was going to be a pain to hide, at least your transformation wasn&#39;t as bad as Traci&#39;s or Gina&#39;s.  You just have to make sure no one finds out for a week, and then you&#39;ll be back to normal.  <br />
<br />
You walk out of the Game Master&#39;s store self-consciously, painfully aware of the fur rubbing against your inner thighs and the uncomfortable breeze under your skirt.  You immediately head for the nearest clothing store, and though rather embarrassed, purchase a pack of boxers.  You then make your way to the mall bathroom, and safely hidden in a stall, you take out a pair of boxers and put it on, covering your still trembling tail in the process.  It&#39;s not perfect, but at least you don&#39;t feel so naked, and as long as you&#39;re feeling this nervous, it&#39;s unlikely your tail will uncurl and show itself.<br />
<br />
For the first time, you&#39;re grateful that the bus home is rather crowded, as you are not sure how to sit without squashing your tail.  Instead, you stand, and somehow make it home.  As you enter the front door, you spot your mother hurrying towards you.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Good, you made it,&quot; she smiles tiredly.  &quot;Dinner&#39;s in the oven, make sure Bryan gets to bed on time.  Love you!&quot;  She hurriedly pulls on her work shoes and grabs her bag and keys, nearly sprinting out to the car.  She&#39;s always worked nights, but since your father passed away from a heart attack a few years ago, she&#39;s somehow managed to balance that and taking care of you and your little brother, as well as all the housework.  You try to help where you can, but you get the feeling your mom feels gulity about you having to help, and wants you to be able to have a normal school life.  You figure the next best way to make things easier for her is to study hard, get into a great college on a full scholarship, and ease the financial load.  Having a little money coming in from a part-time job couldn&#39;t hurt either, and since you told your mom it was for the sake of your resume - without giving her any details about the actual job -  she didn&#39;t object.  You <i> definitely </i> cannot let her know what your new job is really like, or that you had suddenly sprouted a tail, since you don&#39;t want her to worry.<br />
<br />
Your little brother Bryan is lounging on the couch reading, since all you can get on TV is the local broadcast channels, which have no programs for kids in the evenings.  While the two of you sometimes play games on the computer, it is so old that it is barely limping along, so you can&#39;t install anything new, and you barely have any data on your internet plan.  You hope that your new job will at least get you enough money to get a new computer, for Bryan&#39;s sake if for nothing else, since he was now ten and would really start needing a decent computer for schoolwork.  You toss your bag over by the stairs and walk into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, Bryan, let&#39;s eat,&quot; you order.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Mom always says you should change before dinner,&quot; Bryan nagged, trotting in. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fine, we should eat while it&#39;s still warm, and I want to have a shower afterwards anyway,&quot;  you retort.  Although you can&#39;t quite sit properly, you manage to make it through dinner.  You grab your stuff and head upstairs, tossing it in your room and going into the bathroom, locking the door.  Finally stripping down and letting your tail out, you feel an amazing sense of release.  Your new muscles are neary cramped from having kept your tail scrunched up in your boxers, and at the sudden freedom, your tail begins to wag slightly.  You sigh in resignation.  While using the toilet with a tail presents its own challenges, you manage to finish your business and step inside the shower.  Having fur to take care of is a new experience, but you use a tiny bit of shampoo on your tail, and it seems to do no harm.  Hwoever, drying off your tail makes it poof a bit, and you decide that tomorrow you have to make a quick visit to a pet store to buy a fur brush, no matter how odd it may feel.  You thread your tail down one leg of your pajama pants as you get dressed and finally exit the bathroom.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m done, Bryan, go get ready for bed!&quot; you call down the stairs, then head for your room.  Closing the door, you ready your clothes and school supplies for tomorrow, trying to figure out how to hide your tail in a way that allows you to sit comfortably.  While the long uniform skirt may keep your tail hidden, if it happened to move, it could draw some very unwanted attention.  You put out a new pair of boxers, figuring you&#39;ll just have to make sure the tail stays tucked between your legs like today.  You realize you haven&#39;t really had a chance to examine your new appendage today, as you&#39;ve been busy either trying to hide it or trying to take care of it.  You drop your pajama pants a slight bit in the back, just enough for your tail to uncurl itself over the edge.  Trying to figure out how to control it, you slowly wag it side to side, then lift it at various angles.  You concentrating so hard, you don&#39;t hear the doorknob turn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey sis, I&#39;m done getting ready for bed, can we read together a bit...&quot;  Bryan&#39;s voice trailed off as his eyes grew rounder, and you both freeze in surprise.  Before you have time to react, he continues, &quot;Whoaaaaa!  Is that for real???&quot; which brings you to your senses.  Grabbing Bryan by the arm, you drag him in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, you cannot tell ANYONE about this, do you under stand me?&quot;  you demand solemnly.  However, your words are lost on Bryan, who is eyeing your swishing tail in childish wonder.  <br />
<br />
&quot;....can I touch it?&quot;  he asks, oblivious to your worries.  Finally, you sigh, and sit down on your bed, your tail curled around to the side.  You pat the bed, and Bryan sits next to you, then reaches out and touches the tail gently.  It feels rather ticklish, and your tail twitches at the sensation.  Inadvertently, Bryan giggles, and pets the tail more confidently.  While this oddly feels more pleasurable than you would like to admit, you&#39;re still concerned that Bryan will keep this to himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, Bryan,&quot;  you start off.  &quot;You know I got an after-school job, today, right?&quot;  Bryan nods, still watching only the tail.  &quot;It&#39;s for that crazy wizard that has a store in the mall, and this is something he did to me.  It&#39;ll wear off in a while, but you can&#39;t let anyone find out, especially mom, okay?  It&#39;ll be our little secret.&quot;  At the mention of the magician, Bryan looked up, eyes shining.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want a tail too!&quot;  he demanded.  <br />
<br />
&quot;No way,&quot;  you respond immediately.  &quot;You don&#39;t know how much trouble this is.  You can&#39;t let anyone know about it, or else there will be trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Awwwww!&quot;  he whined.  &quot;That&#39;s not fair, I want to have a tail!&quot;  While he was usually mature for his age, Bryan could sometimes get bratty like this, and it reminded you just how young he still was.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Tell anyone about this, and I&#39;ll have the magician change you into a girl,&quot;  you threatened emptily, using the best ultimatum you could think of against a young boy who still had simplistic notions about gender.  Bryan&#39;s eyebrows furrowed, and you felt a bit bad.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I can&#39;t let you have a tail, and you can&#39;t tell mom, because she&#39;d make me quit.  If anyone else found out about this, we&#39;d never hear the end of it.  But I&#39;ll tell you what, as long as you keep this a secret, if I manage to learn how to do some magic, you&#39;ll be the first person I show.&quot;   Bryan&#39;s eyes lightened a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Promise?&quot;  he asked reluctantly,<br />
<br />
You nod seriously, and you notice that Bryan is trying to conceal a smile.  Relieved that you have won him over, you flip your tail slightly so it brushes across his face, causing Bryan to laugh at the ticklish sensation in spite of himself.  You really do love the little guy, and you trust him to keep the secret.  Ruffling his hair gently, you vow to get through this week and this job.   You read together for a while, although Bryan is more interested in your tail than the book.  When he finally falls asleep, you carry him to his own bed and tuck him in, and at last go over your schoolwork for tomorrow.<br />
<br />
In the morning, your mom is home in time to make breakfast for the two of you, and she and Bryan leave for school.  You eat and get ready, but you are suddenly extremely nervous at the thought of going to school.  Wavering, you finally decide to...</p>
