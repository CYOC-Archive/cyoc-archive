<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marcey comes back after a while all dressed in a lab coat and black slacks. By now Max has finished shaving my hoofs to the proper contours and with a halter fitted to my Donkey head I'm standing there ready to venture out into the world, a &quot;Donkey!&quot;<br />
<br />
Walking out the room and down a long hall people stop and stare. Some seem pleased for me and show a thumbs up sign. Yet a few grumbled about walking a filthy animal in the buildings hallway. I remain delighted in the sensual feelings I'm enjoying.<br />
<br />
One might think this to me a terrible thing this transformation business, but right now I think it's the best! <br />
<br />
Marcey talks to me was we get closer to the glass doors in the end of the hallway. She tould me how I was to have my own stall in the barn and kept for a time in a private corral. These two things were precautions to older animals possibly trying to fight for territorial rites, or just for fun. I gave a simple nod as to agree and thank her for the consideration.<br />
<br />
Out the glass doors we walked and then down a garden path till my nostrils picked up the rich scents of animals and my stable. Braying cries, whinnies, lowing cows and bleating goats all mixed into a din of noise.<br />
<br />
We stopped at the stable-barn door as Marcey walked inside to get the manager. A dark shaded man came out and talked harshly to Marcey. Then looking at me he said something I at that time did not understand.<br />
<br />
Shortly after the man placed hobbles on my hind feet, looped a rope through the eyelit of my halter and then another rope interlaced over my back, forelegs, and neck, I was feeling rather stuck.<br />
<br />
He pulled up a stool and took a firm hold of my upper lip. I oggled him wondering if he was going to check my teeth? Wrong, he took an electric needle and began to tatto a number into the turned up lip.<br />
<br />
Screams of Donkey fear mixed with obvious discomfort as this process continued for some time. At last done he removed the ropes and pulled me down the stable isle to a stall, mine though it had been used for some time by another Donkey.<br />
<br />
I stood in the stall my rope leed tied to a steel ring embedded into the wood wall. Well, he's not too nice but I was still looking forward to coming times with pretty Marcey and as Max said being at stud!<br />
<br />
later in the afternoon came a bucket of water and a large plastic bowl of some ground up grain mush mixed with maybe olive oil. I grooped up the food with lips still untrained in the delicate ways of a Donkey. Oh but to tell the other thing too, I almost drowned in the water bucket as try after silly try got my nostrils in the water as well as my big lips. <br />
<br />
As evening came other animals, horses, donkeys, and a few neat looking ponies were placed in stalls just like mine.<br />
<br />
The barn manager came down the isle checking a clipboard hung by each stall. No doubt they kept good records on who, and or what each animal got in the way of food and water.<br />
<br />
I stood looking around my first night as an animal and donkey. I was so thrilled feeling the new sensed feelings that time passed quickly till all the lights save two went out.<br />
<br />
Even after lights out as many others laid down to sleep I stayed up and kept watch, looking and listening to this wonderous place.<br />
<br />
The banging of a wooden spoon on the bottom of a steel dishpan woke me and I'm sure the others. A morning round of the mush and water came and was soon gulped down my new donkey me! As each one of us finished our lot for food a handler came and took them away.<br />
<br />
Marcey came inside the barn and took hold my rein or rope and led me out the barn into a warm Summer's sun. A corral about 50 x 50 was my home during the daylight hours. Another corral with Jenny Donkeys was to my sirect right. While to my left was another Jack Donkey like myself.<br />
<br />
Marcey stood up on a upside downed bucket and announced me as being a new donkey wishing all there to guide and help me adjust. I thought it odd at the time how the other donkey's seemed to pay her little mind and would wander about as if totally disinterested.<br />
<br />
Marcey showed my a water trough and my lessons began how to drink without trying to drown. I appreciated her so very much as she told me how to act and made me walk while swinging my tail. You might think these to me somewhat instinctive, and they are but not while the human pattern of thoughts prevail.<br />
<br />
It was after a short lunch break when Marcey sat down on her propstand bucket and began to explain a lot that the front office did not tell or alert me to about being a donkey.<br />
<br />
First and formost I had signed a five year contract! Five years, thats 20 seasons, or 60 months, or 1826 days till the base contract expired. She informed me that when the contract did expire I'd maybe be contacted for to reapply and continue on another five more years. She warned me against it as I listened.<br />
<br />
The more Marcey talked the sicker my stomach began to feel. Five years, the first thought of it wasn't all that terrible. Yet thinking of it as 60 months seemed a lot longer, but to be then asked when my guard was down to reapply for yet another five more years I did then wonder how much of what was me, would then be left?<br />
<br />
Marcey explained that as a donkey part of my normal schedule of events was a time of rut. A time when the females came into heat and males, like myself go plum crazy with desire for sex. She said too that I would find being a Jack donkey somewhat a bore. I was told of being kept away from people, children, and other donkeys as I like the other Jack remained horny most of the time. If we got together we'd fight, kick, and want to mate till out of shear boredom we might take to mounting and jack fucking each the other, the sound of this didn't go well with me.<br />
<br />
I had plans of being around people, showing off my big cock and luring in silly women to toy, play, or sensualize with it. I had plans of being an animal and grousing out people with pooping in the street, peeing any ole' time, or letting a donkey fart spread in the breeze.<br />
<br />
It seemed to me that being a Jack Donkey was going to be dull, except for those few weeks during rut.</p>
