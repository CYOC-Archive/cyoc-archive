<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer jumped out of bed as soon as she woke up, it felt like Christmas morning as the excitement made her run up to her mirror, before the feeling disappeared with a screeching halt. She was still a raccoon. What was more telling was she had certainly gained a few pounds as well, focused around her breast and ass. &quot;I&#39;m seventeen again...&quot; Jennifer muttered in amazement, it had been such a long time since she reached her original age she almost forgot what she looked like. Well roughly what she looked like, she wasn&#39;t this short before or as petite. A few seconds past as Jennifer snapped her paw. &quot;Oh and the fur!&quot; Jennifer&#39;s face drew concern, everyday she was forgetting what it was like before all this.<br />
<br />
Jennifer went for her clothes, thankfully that didn&#39;t change again from yesterday, Jennifer decided on a skirt and tee. As Jennifer pulled down the shirt she noticed it stopped right at her waist. &quot;I guess I like to show my midriff.&quot; The skirt was also pretty short, and without any panties any vigorous action would probably flash everyone. Normally she would never entertain the idea but maybe today she was feeling flirty she convinced herself. <br />
<br />
Grabbing her bag she made her way downstairs. Her mother following the trend as the clothes around her became increasingly minimalistic, herself in a simple floral dress. Jennifer ate a quick breakfast before heading out to the bus again. As Jennifer picked out her seat she quickly noticed things were starting to happen, about a quarter of the bus was getting frisky. The couple from before now locked in a french kiss, others following suit. Jennifer herself growing aroused at the scene, she could feel the yearn but was able to suppress it still. The bus had certainly had it&#39;s few but it matched nothing like the school, around every corner and nook there was a couple now locked into public displays of affection. Nothing obscene or overtly lewd, thankfully no one was brazen to have sex on the school grounds, atleast where Jennifer could see. It was only Wednesday, she still had two more days, but this certainly was a wake up call, tomorrow half or more the school would be like this, and what would happen Friday? Jennifer shuddered at the thought, but her mind did wander nonetheless. <br />
<br />
Jennifer&#39;s first class quickly became awkward as she quickly noticed two things. One, students were still making out during class, and two, she now shared classes with Kyle as a senior. Jennifer picked the seat next to him. Kyle turning to say &quot;Well obviously that didn&#39;t work, you tried everything right?&quot; Jennifer looked back at Kyle. &quot;Yea I tried everything, but it didn&#39;t feel the same.&quot; Jennifer watched as Kyle&#39;s eyes struggled to maintaine contact as his eyes wandered down, staring at her body. &quot;Yea I think it might be something with the original book, I need to find it by tomorrow.&quot; Jennifer said hesitantly. Kyle looked like his mind was running a mile a minute, as if he was mere seconds away from leaping on top of her and rigorously having his way-. Jennifer stopped her train of thought as she noticed she too was going through the same ordeal. The effect was so potent as it came so natural, as if you were the one coming up with the idea rather it being forced upon you. The two nervously turned back to the class, embarrassed by the scene. The dance continued through the class, the teacher not even paying attention to the other students who were not paying attention.<br />
<br />
As the bell rang Jennifer walked out the door before suddenly being pushed from the side into the small nook of lockers. Now that they were the same age Kyle&#39;s shortness of being a rabbit was apparent. Jennifer must have only been just shy of five foot, but Kyle was nearly a foot shorter. His eyes burned as he stared at her. Jennifer was paralyzed as Kyle stood up on his toes to reach up to kiss her. The feeling made Jennifer melt as her stunned mind quickly melted as she kissed the rabbit back. Muzzle to muzzle the two made out as the burning sensation grew. Jennifer slid down the wall as her legs opened wide. As Kyle saw the scene before him, Jennifer&#39;s disheveled shirt revealing a furred breast and the lip of her skirt just hiding everything below he grabbed his head as he groaned. &quot;No no no!&quot; Kyle staggered backwards. &quot;I gotta control this.&quot; Jennifer snapped out of her daze as her tongue rolled back into her mouth as she embarrassedly covered herself back up. &quot;What...what happened?&quot; Jennifer said worriedly, her mind was a fog.<br />
<br />
Kyle grabbed his bag from the floor. &quot;Why we need to stop this, I don&#39;t know what will happen even tomorrow if this is what it&#39;s like. We can&#39;t end up like this.&quot; Kyle pulled back his ears as he exhaled deeply. &quot;I can&#39;t stay here, I don&#39;t know what to do.&quot; He muttered as he walked off. <br />
<br />
Jennifer took a second before standing up and straighting herself up. Despite the feeling being so strong it disappeared as fast as it came, while it never left, Jennifer didn&#39;t feel the same way for the rest of the day. <br />
<br />
As the day progressed more and more students were acting the same, the small gradual shift from a quarter to half of the students just as Jennifer had predicted. By the time she left school nearly a third of the bus was now partnered up.<br />
<br />
As she entered the house she called out to her mom. But no reply. Jennifer walked over to the counter, a small note spelled out in nice handwriting. &quot;Dinner in fridge.&quot; Jennifer turned around and opened the fridge door. &quot;Guess she&#39;s out tonight.&quot; The food was cold serve but still tasted great, her mom always the stalwart chef. As the night began to creep on, Jennifer&#39;s mind was again scored by lust. She spent the rest of the night freely exploring her body, each rub of her fur sent tingles down her spine. Jennifer pushed the mission of the sketchbook back in her mind as she tried to address the growing fire in her groin. She thought of the scene earlier that day, she wished she would have grabbed him herself. Why did she let him get away? A small sliver of her mind knew the answer but all she could focus on was the passion behind it. Dazed and basking in the afterglow of her selfcare she slowly fell asleep.</p>
