<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam decided to make herself the envy of every man and woman. Since she had never been sexy she decided to make up for what she had missed.all through high school and college she had never dated anyone. In fact her first boyfriend was the one she had now. Dave, Dave was a slob, she only stayed with him because she knew he had a gun upstairs and was scared he might shoot her if she left. Dave and Sam actually made quite the couple in the looks department, he was also short and round. But he was also bald and had no respect for his own personal hygiene. This was shown best by him only wearing wife beaters and cargo pants. Sam didn&#39;t want to date this man any longer and decided to change her appearance to do it.<br />
<br />
She started by making herself thin and toned, she also removed all the hair from her legs and arms. This only happened on the screen but would apply to her when she hit APPLY. With her lack of curves and boyish face she looked like a ten year old boy, on the monitor. So she decided to give herself some curves. She made her breasts huge on her frame at an H cup and gave herself an ass to match by giving herself wide hips and a cushiony butt. She made her legs long and shapely and gave herself a perfect thigh gap. All that was left to do at this point was her face as it didn&#39;t suit her new body at all. She removed all blemishes and moles from her skin, made her lips plump and her eyes large. She then changed her hair from a short brown, to a thick brown that cascaded down to her shoulder blades in curly waves. Everything was in order so she hit APPLY.<br />
<br />
The changes took a while so she looked in the mirror as her new body stretched the limits of her fabric pyjamas and her face changed to become sexier. When they were finished Sam had a terrible wedgie from her panties and  her back hurt as her new breasts had no support. She didn&#39;t have anything to wear to show off her new body. She could have changed her clothes easily but decided to go shopping instead.<br />
<br />
She changed into a baggy t-shirt and a pair of sweatpants and drove to the mall. She went to the underwear store first and splurged, she bought loads of lace bras and panties of all sorts, some nylons, a few sports bras and even a corset to keep up her new figure. She put on a pair of the panties, a red and black lace bra and the corset just so she felt better with her body. She was only showing her face though so she decided to buy new clothes. She went to a specialist store and bought loads of low cut dresses, sweaters, shirts and t-shirts. She then bought loads of jeans, leggings, skirts and shorts to show off her legs and butt. Having finished with clothes she went into a shoe store and bought her first ever pair of heels, they were black with five inch heels to make her taller, when she was wearing them she was actually 6&#39;0&quot; making her taller than most men.<br />
<br />
<br />
After all that shopping she was tired and hungry, she took all of the things she had bought to her car, and then went into the food court. She bought a salad and began eating she started noticing all the stares she was getting from both men and women. She enjoyed it, she had never been desired before. This continued until one man came up to her and asked for her number. She gave it to him and asked if he wanted to meet her tonight. He gave her his address and then Sam had her evening planned.<br />
<br />
She went home and decided to get changed for her date. She would have put make up on but didn&#39;t need to as her face was perfect without. She took a shower however and cleaned herself. She changed into a black dress, a pair of nylons and her heels. She was wearing a push up bra to really make her breasts look big and a lace G-string. She didn&#39;t wear her corset however as she thought she had worn it enough for one day.<br />
<br />
She got in her car, a shiny BMW now because she had changed it, and drove to the address the guy had given her. She arrived at an apartment building and went to the apartment the guy had written on the address, 6B.<br />
<br />
She knocked on the door. A minute later it was answered by her date, John. He looked a lot different from earlier, more honest. Earlier he had been wearing a tracksuit and a pair<br />
 of sneakers but now he was wearing a pair of black jeans and a button down shirt with a skinny tie. Formal, but not too formal. He let her into his apartment, it was a small place but cosy, Sam liked it. He had made them dinner, or tried was a better way of putting it, it wasn&#39;t bad but Sam could tell he was an inexperienced cook. They talked about themselves and got to know each other. He was actually quite the gentleman about everything but made the odd joke and entertained her. It was fun but that was all it needed to be. It had gotten late in the evening and Sam was about to go, when he offered her some more wine. She had already drunk quite a bit during the night but decided to accept his offer.<br />
<br />
Bad idea, they drank so much they weren&#39;t aware of what they were doing and twenty minutes later she was in John&#39;s bed. <br />
<br />
When she woke up she had a killer hangover. She looked down, she was naked as was he. She could tell what had happened, she had enjoyed it though and left him a kiss on the cheek before she left.<br />
<br />
<br />
They continued dating for the next six months, Sam had bought moved into his apartment so she didn&#39;t have to live with Dave, she had just left In the night with all of her stuff. Which she really should have done years ago. Over the six months though Sam had changed john quite alot by...</p>
