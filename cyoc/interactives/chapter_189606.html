<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luna thought for a moment as the two of you sat down on the floor and underneath the blanket that Kellie ad Roxie laid over you before they went to bed. You looked to her with some interest, as it was something that might be expected, as your dad had gotten you summer work over the time you&#39;d been in high school. A lot of it was either mowing lawns delivering the paper. Some times it was serving lunch at one of the town&#39;s two fast food restaurants, and it did earn some spending money, though a lot of times you didn&#39;t end up having much time to spend it. But it also kept you out of trouble and your evenings were often still free to hang out with Luna during the summer.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are some other things to think over right now,&quot; Luna eventually said to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what?&quot; you looked back to her, &quot;I mean... it&#39;d be something to do for the summer. And a part of me feels like I need to be responsible... for... you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna ran a hand along your cheek and then turned your head so that two of you could share a good morning kiss. As you were released from it, you also noticed the smile on her face. You couldn&#39;t help but smile back.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know... and I love you for that,&quot; Luna smiled, &quot;but there are other things to consider. For one thing... I&#39;ve matured into my more mature form as a MILF-wolf, even in human form right now. And by being with me... you became a MILF-wolf.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... and I know that no one can bar us from working just because we&#39;re MILF-wolves,&quot; you commented, &quot;and a lot of this right now would just be something for the summer. We wouldn&#39;t be going out for our careers until after college.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, some can,&quot; Luna commented, &quot;remember that MILF-wolves, regardless of being in their human or wolven form are constantly lactating... a result of the fact that mom was pregnant with me when she got bitten... and that our milk is one of the ways that people become MILF-wolves. Most restaurants and food processing centers have been ruled to have the right not to hire MILF-wolves for risk of accidentally turning someone... or being vulnerable to a case of getting even with someone that may have wronged you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I&#39;d never do that,&quot; you protested, and Luna took your hands in hers.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you wouldn&#39;t, sweetie,&quot; Luna said to you, &quot;but it is one of the things that&#39;s been there with regard to MILF-wolves and the risk of even an accident is real.&quot;<br />
<br />
You slowly nodded and accepted what Luna told you. In part it didn&#39;t sound fair, but you were smart enough to know that it made sense. You&#39;d seen the reports on how the MILF-wolf condition spread over the years, and at times even discussed it with Luna in the past, though she remained distant and vague at the time. And while werewolves had earned full civil rights throughout much of the world, that didn&#39;t change the potential fears people had. That meant that there would be concerns about things that could problems and that this would be especially true for MILF-wolves.<br />
<br />
&quot;There will also be some things to consider with regard to the type of job to look for,&quot; Luna commented, &quot;for some jobs might have you in shifts that go into the evening... and on nights of the full moon, that could be difficult. My mom gets the nights and days around the full moon off, but that&#39;s been more by a special arrangement with her schedule and often means longer hours on the other days of the week to make up for the three days she isn&#39;t in. Others may not allow for that... and there you may run into issues with the fact that for three nights a month you will turn into your MILF-wolf form...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which means I wouldn&#39;t be able to get into some of those jobs that could have an afternoon to evening shift until either I&#39;ve gotten more control over the will related triggers to the transformation,&quot; you surmised, &quot;or they would be fine with a naked MILF-wolf doing the work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some actually might...&quot; Luna managed a weak chuckle, &quot;but they&#39;d also be ones that you&#39;d want to settle into long term... and from my mom has commented on when someone&#39;s given those career offers to werewolves or MILF-wolves... the job is somewhat seedy. They want guards and bouncers to essentially be a threat to attackers... or they&#39;re looking into those that have stylized fetishes...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; you managed, &quot;I wasn&#39;t looking at working as a stripper over the summer. That would be weird and probably wouldn&#39;t let me get anything published.&quot;<br />
<br />
That had more to some of your personal career choices in what you&#39;d wanted to do. You&#39;d loved the various fantasy and sci-fi genres, largely because they&#39;d always have some element of &quot;advanced science&quot; or magic that could then allow for transformations and things like that, and you knew that a fair number of popular novels had played to those sorts of things, not always transformation, but many of the themes that related to combating dark wizards and so on. That sort of interest had actually made literature one of your best classes in high school, along with creative writing. Your dad had often commented that if you&#39;d focused yourself in your other classes, you might have gotten grades good enough to qualify for more than the local community college. But you figured that a lot of that wouldn&#39;t be too hard to wrestle with, as one of your favorite writers, I.D. Whine, supposedly didn&#39;t even go to college.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still wanting to be an author?&quot; Luna asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;For the main post college career, yeah,&quot; you nodded, &quot;but this is to be more summer and temporary... but because people will often be looking for people of &quot;good standing,&quot; I wouldn&#39;t want a summer job that would involve me showing myself to them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me to...&quot; Luna smiled, &quot;though, I&#39;d also have additional limitations.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Additional...&quot; you said, worry creeping into your voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;My pregnancy, Nicki,&quot; Luna said to you with a smile, &quot;for right now in May it&#39;ll be no problem... but by the end of the summer in August or September, I&#39;ll be starting to show. And any summer job that would have me doing a lot of heavy lifting would be unwise. Even if being a MILF-wolf grants me greater strength and greater durability than what one would expect... it&#39;d still be unwise to end up in any position where I&#39;m doing a lot of heavy lifting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d be a lot to think over,&quot; you said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And would relate on what you want to work on for the summer,&quot; Luna answered, &quot;it would be a bad idea to look into these things today...  so that we can get the applications out after the full moon with some knowledge of it. And then there is the question on what you&#39;d want to work on for the summer. We wouldn&#39;t want pull each other from anything we want to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... what had you thought about doing for the summer?&quot; you asked.</p>
