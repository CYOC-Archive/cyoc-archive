<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cole had been a bodyguard for years now, and had a strict &#39;no-caring&#39; policy about his various employers&#39; eccentricities. They could like to dance naked on the beach or juggle with cats or eat on the ground, Cole, as a bodyguard, did not care and did not intervene in anything except the protection of his client. <br />
<br />
It was still a little bit shocking to learn that his most recent employer had decided to transform himself into his own penis and then force that change upon Nico. For a second, he&#39;d almost been worried when the sickly young man had refused and tried to leave, but of course, he could not escape anywhere. Against someone else, Cole&#39;s duty would have been to interfere, probably by putting himself between those two and take the dicking ray with his own body. <br />
<br />
But Gerald was his boss, and who was Cole to stop him from trying new ways to cure his son&#39;s illness? <br />
<br />
Still, once the change was complete, Cole figured it was his turn to react and he carefully pulled Nico&#39;s clothing away. He eventually found Nico lying down inside his boxers. For all that Nico had grown up sick, he also had grown up in a major way in his pants. A fat nine inch cock was lying, flopped against the buckle of his belt, his hairy balls loose and relaxed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Allow me,&quot; the other man in the room said, holding out his hand. <br />
<br />
Cole regarded the quiet man with suspicion, but could not refuse. His boss had clearly instructed him to turn Nico into a penis. He had to assume this Hugo person was authorized to check up on Nico&#39;s new body. Thus, he deposited Nico in Hugo&#39;s palm, glancing at Gerald still on the desk.<br />
<br />
The middle-aged cock seemed extremely satisfied, if the bubbling pre was any indication. Cole could not say he understood the appeal, but it was not his place to judge. He only had to protect his clients. On a strictly professional level, this probably made it a hell lot easier. Now, they made much smaller target, they could not wander away from him on their own, they were also a lot harder to recognize. He doubted anyone had files on the Tanner penises. Faces, yes, but their equipments? Okay, maybe some stalkers did. <br />
<br />
Hmmm, perhaps he should suggest this dicking technology to a few of his fellow bodyguard friends. They might want to try it as a protection detail.<br />
<br />
He was cut from his train of thoughts when Nico&#39;s voice shouted in excitement: &quot;I&#39;m not sick! This is amazing! I feel so strong and healthy! God, I want to go outside and run a marathon! I could! Fuck, I never did, but I know I would be able to!&quot; <br />
<br />
Cock-Gerald chuckled, and wasn&#39;t that a strange sight in itself? &quot;Forgetting something already, son?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nico deflated, shrinking barely half a inch. (A shower, then.) &quot;Oh, right. Can I move like this?&quot; There was a few seconds of silence as the cock in Hugo&#39;s hand twitched. &quot;Oh. Damn. I can get a little harder, but that&#39;s mostly it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, son, I&#39;ve already planned for this.&quot; The dick on the desk jolted, his head aimed straight at Cole. &quot;Cole, to ensure you may continue your duties twenty-four-seven, I order you to replace your old penis with Nico.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole frowned. &quot;How?&quot;<br />
<br />
That Hugo character held out Nico around Cole&#39;s crotch. &quot;Simple. If we press this dicked human against your own penis, it will take its place.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole noted the use of a &#39;it&#39; to designate Nico, but kept quiet as he unzipped his pants and accepted his new task. Weirdest job ever, but it paid well. <br />
<br />
                                                                                                                             ***<br />
The trip back home was filled with new assessments and thoughts of how to best do his job from this point on. Nico had more than a few suggestions, the most being utterly useless. However, he could at least concede the easiest demand. Once they had arrived home, Cole did a thorough sweep of their surroundings and locked every door, pulled the curtains over every window, then kicked off his pants. <br />
<br />
For the remainder of the day, Cole let Nico hang freely between his legs, having simply moved his holster around his tight instead. To give Nico a good view of the television, he lounged on the couch, like he were a teenager with no posture. Or a slut begging for someone to sit on his hips. Not that he thought about that last one much. He simply let Nico watch whatever he wanted as he tried to follow his duty to watch over his cock... client. Cock-client. All in all, the day could have given Nico hope for his new existence. <br />
<br />
The next morning, however, Cole realized he had been too taken in by Nico&#39;s enthusiasm. <br />
<br />
What had he been thinking, exposing his charge to the world like that? With absolutely no protection? It was a failure to do that and a big one. He had to make it right.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! What are you doing, Cole?&quot; Nico jolted, protesting at the sight of the pair of pants. <br />
<br />
&quot;As a bodyguard, I cannot simply walk around without pants. It would immediately alert your enemies that something particular is going on. For your own protection, it has to look like everything is normal and you&#39;re just my dick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously, Cole?&quot; Nico protested, jolting up and down angrily. &quot;What am I going to do all day?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is not my problem, Nico. I&#39;m only here to protect you,&quot; Cole grunted as he pushed his hard cock into his pants. Predictably, the tent it showed would have made anyone salivate, but Cole remained stoic. What did it matter if his new dickhead rubbed against those thick pants? He... he was a man of great self-control.<br />
<br />
Cole completed his outfit and walked down the stairs into the kitchen where he cooked himself a quick meal, ignoring the muffled protests from inside his pants. He was slightly softer after a cup of coffee and a few toasts, stretching and double-checking the strap of his holster. Following that, he started his round, acting exactly as he did on a regular day. If someone watched the house, they would not have noticed a difference. <br />
<br />
However, this did not quell the whining. Throughout the day, Cole&#39;s new cock kept complaining that he was too hot and stuffy inside those pants. That it was too dark and he couldn&#39;t see anything. Cole quietly rolled his eyes. That had been the point. If someone could see through his clothing, they might notice the somewhat animate penis between his legs. Now, he could pretend to be a ventriloquist, but not if the enemy&#39;s realized that voice and movements went together. <br />
<br />
All that really proved was that Nico had been spoiled as a young man. Cole, at his age, had long practiced the art of surveilling an area and protecting it stoicly, without moving. At the very least, Nico seemed to realize that his constant pleading would not receive a positive response and slowed considerably by sunset. <br />
<br />
By then, he was hanging limply between Cole&#39;s legs, mumbling angrily, but no longer demanding loudly for everything and anything under the sun. Finally. Cole was glad the lesson had been learned after this much time. Still, now he was only looking forward to taking a good shower and going to bed. He *had* been sweating rather heavily in the middle of the afternoon. <br />
<br />
With careful movements, Cole stripped himself bare, starting with his shirt, flexing his abs and pecs. Still in top shape. He could easily take down a man a head taller with little difficulty. He had done it before. Then came the time to strip out of his pants, and the hit of cold air on his penis jolted Nico back to life. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you finally letting me breath?&quot; he started, throbbing hard. &quot;I was bored out of my mind!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Poor thing,&quot; Cole deadpanned as he stepped over the edges of the bath and started his shower. The hot water felt so good on his skin that he took a second, eyes close, to let it drip down his skin, off his arms, and the tip of his dick. Heat pumped through his groin as Nico stiffened, and Cole scowled before taking a bar of soap. He began with his abs, then his arms and legs, dreading what would inevitably come next. <br />
<br />
He, however, could not delay. Personal hygiene was important. So, with his right hand, he grabbed his shaft and with the left, he rubbed the soap over it. &quot;Aw yeah, rub me, Cole!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That is completely inappropriate, Nico. I am technically on your payroll and cannot mix business with pleasure. Not to mention, I am easily twice your age.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole gritted his teeth when his new dick stiffened and twitched desperately against his hands. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, Cole! I&#39;m losing my mind here. There&#39;s nothing wrong with rubbing one out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I do this, will you shut up afterward?&quot;<br />
<br />
He nearly whined at the spike of pleasure that went through him when Nico rubbed himself against his palm. &quot;Yes! Yes, anything, Cole! Please, just make me cum!&quot;<br />
<br />
Unable to admit his arousal, Cole grabbed his fat dick with both hands and started pumping roughly. He went at it with no warning, tenderness, consideration. He welcomed the little pangs of pain as they turned into electrical shocks of pleasure throughout, as Nico&#39;s voice went from demanding to whining, to choked up. <br />
<br />
Cole rolled his head back as he laughed and rumbled &quot;Finally getting your little whoremouth shut, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
And yet, despite the anger and shame, he came so hard he splattered over the wall on the other side of the shower. <br />
<br />
                                                                                                                             ***<br />
The second day, Cole said nothing to Nico, and ignored his every word until someone rang the door. Cole immediately muted Nico entirely and kept a hand over his gun. The delivery guy at the door gulped at the sight of such a muscled man, clearly a dangerous guy, and armed to boot. &quot;Sign here,&quot; he said. <br />
<br />
Cole scratched the tablet with the pen, uncaring, and took the package without a word. <br />
<br />
With purpose, he walked back to the kitchen table and flipped a knife to unwrap his order. Although it would have been more logical not to, he raised Nico&#39;s volume to just above a whisper. Some part of him wanted to hear his bratty charge&#39;s reaction. <br />
<br />
&quot;... What&#39;s that?&quot; Nico asked, apprehensive. <br />
<br />
The shiny black shell dangled in Cole&#39;s grasp, hanging from the leather straps and the silver nails. <br />
<br />
&quot;As your bodyguard, it is my duty to ensure your safety,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;ve realized that if you are my dick, then you are far too vulnerable. Even a cup isn&#39;t good enough.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a joke, right?&quot; Cole&#39;s penis asked. <br />
<br />
To answer that, Cole decided to take off his pants and start fiddling with the straps. It had been made fairly large to accomodate Nico&#39;s size. He had no trouble guiding his dick inside the hard, reinforced shell and close the mechanism. The immediate reaction was a spike of heat through his groin, throbbing with panic. <br />
<br />
Gentle, Cole shushed him and tickled the underside of his balls, before clamping that shell too. &quot;This specialized cock cage is bulletproof and only I own the key to its mechanism. Inside, you will be one hundred percent safe. Don&#39;t worry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cole, please! I&#39;ll be quiet! Promise! Don&#39;t just lock me in here! I-&quot; <br />
<br />
Whatever else he wanted to say, Cole wouldn&#39;t hear. He had muted him again. Time to pull up his pants. There, now, no one might guess that a twenty years old young man was being hidden for his own protection. <br />
<br />
&quot;To convince your enemies that you are just my dick, Nico, you need to be silent. Only seen if I step into the shower or take a piss. That&#39;s it. You don&#39;t need to do anything else, Nico. I&#39;ll take care of everything else. Just hang in your cage, be a penis. Nothing else.&quot;</p>
