<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Officer Elizabeth Tanner sat bored in her squad car, radar gun pointed down the empty suburb street. There was almost never any traffic here but ever since one of the chief's friends wife complained about speeders near her children someone had to draw the short straw and take a shift out here from time to time. This turn was hers. The sun beat down on the hood of her car like an anvil, sending shimmering waves of heat up into the blue sky. <br />
<br />
&quot;Officer! Come quick!&quot; A boys voice came through her open window, startling her. &quot;I just heard some girl screaming for help from a house around the corner!&quot; Liz did not waste time asking questions, she had almost been praying for a distraction like this one. Elizabeth followed the boy around the corner at a run. When they reached the large house she saw nothing out of place, heard no screaming. She hesitated for the first time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure you heard a girl screaming?&quot; She asked the boy, a little suspicious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes officer, she was screaming for help, you have to help. I don't know why she is quiet now but it can't be good.&quot; The idea that there could be someone who needed her and was now even unable to yell for help sent Liz back into action. She walked quickly to the door and slammed her fist into it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Police, open then door!&quot; She yelled. There was no response. <br />
 <br />
***<br />
<br />
Jen sat up from her bed with her heart pounding in her throat. She had just been woken up by someone hitting her door with what sounded like a brick and yelling something about the police. She got up slowly and headed for the stairs. She wouldn't let anyone in but she had to make sure something wasn't really wrong. She was worried about the curse but not so worried as to be murdered in her bed.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
After nearly two minutes of pounding Liz decided she needed to take this to the next step. She had to help if there was someone who needed her.. if there wasn't then she would just have to deal with the consequences. She knew there was no way she could break in the door, she would have to break a window to get in... unless. She bent and lifted the faded green mat and found a key. She grinned and pushed the cool metal into the lock. When she opened the door she saw a girl on the stairs, eyes wide with shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Noo!&quot; The girl yelled and threw herself back up the stairs. Liz followed at a run, up the stairs and into a room in the hall at the top. The girl was at the far wall trying to pull open a window.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whats going on? Stop!&quot; Liz found herself yelling. The girl did stop, turning. Her skin was pale and flushed with sweat. Liz began to suspect drugs... she was wrong.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Jen could feel her body start to react the second the young brunette cop stepped into the room. She already wanted to rip off that cop uniform and see what was underneath, even before she had changed at all. She fell to her knees as the first wave of heat hit her. The cop was suddenly there picking her up and laying her on the bed. The tag on her breast pocket said Officer Tanner. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am going to call in an ambulance. Try not to move.&quot; The officer said calmly and starting to back off. Deep down Jen wanted her to leave, to get out of the house as fast as possible and never come back. But her new feelings were already taking over. She twisted a fist around the collar of the uniform and held as tight as she could.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Wait. Don't leave me.&quot; Her back spasmed and she arched her back. Jen felt something between her legs start to bulge and grow. The officer stared at Jen unbelieving. The two donkey ears that sprouted from her head next caught her even more off guard. She couldn't move, only watch in horror as Jen changed. Her face did not change much only hear teeth grew larger and stuck out of her mouth and her eyes turned a deep brown. A light gray fur began to spread across her skin, her finger nails growing hard and black but leaving her with all fingers intact. Her feet were another matter. They rounded and shrank in on themselves becoming hard thick hooves. She felt a tail spurt from above her ass. Her muscles broadened and grew all over her body. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hee haw!&quot; Jen had tried to moan and was shocked at the sounds she made. Finally her massive cock ripped through her pants, erect and dark. Coarse hair sprouted from her crotch. She slipped her pants of then, releasing the pressure on her two massive leathery balls. Beneath her balls she could still feel her pussy, wet and wanting. Kyle had not lied, she had kept her woman parts. Her eyes fell on the stunned cop then and she felt her body react. She reached out and grabbed the unresisting woman by the arms and tossed her on the bed. With her new strength Jen tore away the belt with the gun and then the womans pants.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
When the creature tore her pants off leaving Liz in only her white cotton pants she suddenly came back to herself. &quot;No! Stop!&quot; She shouted at the donkey thing, trying to wriggle free. The huge cock that swayed before her seemed to somewhat hypnotize her though and she found her eyes following it closely. When her panties where pulled down she struggled some more, to no avail. The thing entered her and she screamed at the shock and horror at first but soon in an unwilling and just as shocking pleasure. She had never been filled this much. Sex had never really been something she had enjoyed but now, in a circumstance she had never in her worst nightmares found her self she found it pleasurable to the point of screaming. She felt herself let go then, pushing her crotch against the massive cock, her breasts swaying under her cop uniform. <br />
<br />
She orgasmed and the donkey girl kept going. Liz didn't want it to stop. She unbuttoned her shirt and thrust it open. The girl on top of her undid the front clasp of her sports bra. The girls warm tongue on her nipples sent thrills down her spine. She orgasmed again right before the beast came herself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh muuuy gawwwwd. Haaaaw  Hee Haaaaw!&quot; The girl cried, filling Liz with warm cum. The hot liquid tingled inside her and started to spread. She felt her own changes starting to take place. Her breasts expanded, growing huge and round. She saw her own nipples extend into large teats. She sat up, sending her new breasts bouncing. She stared as her feet took on the same change as had happened to the girl, hooves ripping threw her black boots. She could not seem to bring her horror to the top of her mind, only a sick kind of fascination. Her pussy throbbed, wet and glistening it started to change. It grew and then changed in color and texture. It grew rougher, leathery and dark. Her hair grew coarse and black around it. Fur started to spread from her groin to cover her body. <br />
<br />
She felt her teeth begin to jut from her mouth but felt no other changes to her face. The ears were last on Officer Liz, springing from under her officer's cap. She expect the cock next but none grew, she was a little relieved but a little disappointed as well. She got over it quickly however, seeing the girl kneeling above her, donkey cock hard once again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry this happened, I didn't have a choice.&quot; The girl said. &quot;I'm Jen by the way.&quot; She seamed to be able to control her voice much easier when not in the clutches of her passion. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck me Jen.&quot; Officer Tanner said simply, need in her eyes and hands pinching her long teats. &quot;And call me Liz.&quot;  Jen smiled and did as she was asked, thrusting her cock deep inside Liz's donkey pussy, much deeper than she had before. &quot;I waaunt your caaawwwwk!&quot; Liz burst out. &quot;Heeee haaaw!&quot; And Jen gave it to her.</p>
