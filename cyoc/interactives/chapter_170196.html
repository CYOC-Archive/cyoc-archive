<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The pair spent the next several hours stuck together. Kat had already read through 3 of her Mom&#39;s magicial theory books in hooes of finding a sure fire solution, but to no avail. It wasn&#39;t that there was no solution, but any she found were either at the cost of some exorbitant amount of hard to aquire resources, outside her skill level, could possibly fail making it worse/permanent, or in one case were very boring and monotonous. In that case, she would need to apply the exact opposite spell in reverse order, essentially undoing everything she did one at a time, but with the exact opposite effect. That was the tricky part though, because sometimes there wasn&#39;t a clear,  black and white opposite.<br />
<br />
To be honest though, she felt she could do it. It was by far the easiest option too. However, she had grown extremely attached to the mount version of Dani. Spending the day together had let them work out a lot of their issues they have had. Well, to a general extent since Dani was still stuck acting like a bimbo or would stop paying attention mid sentence because her huge, unmilked tits had rubbed her cock in just the right way. Dani had stopped complaining about her new form almost immediately, quickly adapting to it. <br />
<br />
Because she had to keep her legs close together so her balls would keep in place, her hips and ass had developed a sway which looked incredibly sexy. This was only amplified by Kat insisting she put on high heels. But Dani vehemently refused, saying thungs like they wouldn&#39;t be cute on her, or it would make noise which would annoy Kat, or how if she wore heels, then her feet wouldn&#39;t be able to pick anything up. Kat wasn&#39;t buying it though. She knew Dani really wanted to wear some. The moment she mentioned wearing heels, Dani&#39;s pussy clamped down on her cock, something Kat had learned only happened whenever she got very excited, fucked, or extremely happy. Her refusal was just her defending her last sliver of male-ness that she still had. <br />
<br />
Not wishing to argue, Kat simply used some magic and reshaped all 4 of Dani&#39;s feet into the shape of 6&quot; stiletto pumps. However she was quickly grossed out by their fleshy color and single large toe nail, so she used her magic to put the toe nail on the underside of the foot, and formed another one on each of her now long, narrow heel bones. Doing this was also because, now with the bottoms of her feet being harder, every step now made an audible clicking noise, just like normal high heels would. Kat also darkened Dani&#39;s skin pigment from the bottoms of her feet up to just a few inches above her knees to being practically pitch black, mimicking the look of wearing skin tight, thigh high boots.<br />
<br />
That was several hours ago. Dani was now humming happily as she stood in Kat&#39;s room. Her head was under Kat&#39;s desk as she was acting as her desk chair for the moment. She kept putting one of her heels up to her face to get another look, becomming giddy each time she reconfirmed that her legs were no more than a sexy pair of black thigh high boots with 6&quot; stilleto pumps instead of feet. Dani&#39;s mind slowly had been degrading into the bimbo she looked and talked like, and had accelerated as the day went on. <br />
<br />
As she slowly lost her male self, she gained more and more feminine skills, such as having perfect balance on her feet, or the ability to finely control every nook and cranny of her pussy. The ladder was especially enjoyable to both sisters, as Dani&#39;s ability meant Kat&#39;s cock never could get flacid, for even just a second, ever again. Dani wouldn&#39;t allow for it. Getting endlessly fucked was one of the few good parts of her transformation, which she greatly enjoyed. <br />
<br />
Dani&#39;s lips were now almost fully reshaped into a perfect circle. Her upper and lower lips have completely merged together into a single lip ring. The tightest she could make the opening was about the size of a dime and completely closing it was now out of the question. This was the prelude to her teeth slowly disolving, leaving now just a hollow, moist tube with a tongue for her mouth. Her new mouth was only good for one specific thing, sucking cocks. If she opened her hole wide enough to fit the balls in, her cheeks were even capable of massaging the balls. Kat had stuck a dildo onto the wall underneath her desk before she began her research, and Dani has yet to spit it back out, contently going into her third straight hour of orally pleasuring the dildo. She figured that if Kat needed to move, she would leave it alone, but she was going to make it cum eventually. Her binbo mind slowly making her IQ drop lower and lower had allowed her to forget she was sucking a rubber toy, not a real cock. But she was having fun, so she didn&#39;t mind the extra effort. Little did she know that Kat was no longer planning on returning her back to Dan, but neither would she mind anymore, as she by now has all but forgotten about him. As far as she can remember, which she already knew was limited, Dan must have been some guy she blew once.</p>
