<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After the two of them, ahem, took care of their pressing issues apart from each other, Allison and Dylan had spoken a bit more about the people changing so far, and then went their separate ways - Dylan returning home, Allison going to bed and thinking about Kendall and, more to the point, what almost happened with Dylan. She never knew she would react so strongly to him. But that next morning would prove to be a momentous one as she saw what looked like a red haired young athlete heading to school with her. She wondered if he might be some relative of Lisa&#39;s, only to get the shock of her life when he approached and seemed to be familiar with her.<br />
<br />
It was a quick explanation later that Allison was left gawking at what had become of her old best friend. She had not even realized that the wish was capable of that. Let alone that Lisa seemed so...calm and assured about her new gender. Not that it was particularly difficult. Male Lisa was hot. And he seemed to be eager to show that off.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;re...not in the least bothered by this?&quot; Allison asked, more than a little worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s not like I can really DO anything about it. I had my freak out when I woke up and suddenly dick.&quot; Lewis answered, shrugging his shoulders, &quot;...So uh. What do you think of the new me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you&#39;re...honestly, you&#39;re kind of hot.&quot; Allison responded, and Lewis responded by beaming and subtly flexing. &quot;So you&#39;re...not about to forget anything or---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Allison. I&#39;m gonna be looking into this myself today. So no need to raise any fuss.&quot; Lewis stated, looking around, &quot;I&#39;ll see you second period. I know you really want to see more of this.&quot; Lewis smirked and flexed his bicep, &quot;But I have to get to my classes. You good to have lunch today with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah, just...wow.&quot; Allison watched Lis---Lewis walk off. He seemed more confident than ever now that he was a man. Allison watched him swagger past some young women in her class, and then coyly responded to them cooing over him. He seemed to really be settling into the role of an attractive young man. And, though he flattered them with a flex and a flirtatious smile, it seemed that Lisa wasn&#39;t especially interested.<br />
<br />
Could sexuality be a component? It merited further research.<br />
<br />
Then Allison saw what had become of Kendall on her way into class. She knew when she saw him she should be more distressed, react more strongly, and she was honestly of a mind to react in such a way. She was going to try and pull Kendall away, talk with him maybe after class during the time between classes, and see if she couldn&#39;t get him to talk about this. But he was also a total hunk now. He barely looked nerdy at all, his powerfully built, bodybuilder-like body stuffed into an overall and tank top aesthetic that had no right being as hot as it was. She was divided between her mental response - and her innate biological response, which amounted to looking forward to third period today.<br />
<br />
&quot;K-Kendall? Is...is that really you?&quot; She asked as she approached him. Almost afraid it&#39;d turn out to be some new cleaning staff or something. The most ripped cleaning staff ever, admittedly. But she could still recognize a few telltale hints of who this was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah it&#39;s me. Admittedly, I&#39;m kind of feeling...odd this morning. Forgot my backpack and stuff, so I may need to borrow something.&quot; He cupped his chin and looked her over. Divided as he was now between feeling it was oddly inappropriate, and feeling his own response to her welling up. &quot;There is definitely something happening, but check these out! You liked me strong yesterday, but I feel even stronger today!&quot;<br />
<br />
He flexed his arms, and Allison immediately started feeling them up, then and there. Kendall was astonishingly buff. Allison had never really done anything with someone this enormous. &quot;So...are we...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Kendall said after an odd brief moment of hesitation, &quot;I may look older, but we&#39;re still a thing as far as I know. Third period should be fun. I feel pretty experienced now. So you have that to look forward to.&quot; As Kendall started in toward the class, he grinned and took a seat next to Allison&#39;s seat. He could tell that the boys - like Wes, Ross and Bryan - were staring. He found himself considering himself a man as opposed to a boy, even as he sat next to his girlfriend. Yeah, let em stare. See how ripped a man is.<br />
<br />
Before long, Alex Clark entered his class, carrying a large book bag with him with greater ease and dexterity than usual. He looked like he was deliberately trying not to react to things he saw. But when he saw the older looking Kendall, the plainly not teenage looking man sitting right across from Allison, Alex almost blanched. He was trying - trying his hardest - not to react to the things he saw that morning. Suarez had been bemoaning it seemed he was the only one not suddenly on a really great fitness program, even as it seemed like he was more tight and toned in the midsection than he&#39;d ever been before.<br />
<br />
Ellis Dalton, usually a thin and unattractive somewhat older man, now looked stronger, handsome, and his gray hair was slightly darker and more well styled. Two of the front desk secretaries were even chatting with him like he was some dreamboat while on the way to their jobs. The same Ellis Dalton that barely interacted with the rest of the staff - was now grinning, flexing, and enjoying some female attention.<br />
<br />
And now Alex saw his class and could not believe his eyes. Kendall definitely looked older - almost to the point he looked like he didn&#39;t belong. No, beyond that point. When he and Allison flirted a bit as they shared a book - seemed Ken forgot his - it seemed there was a slight bit of hesitation from Kendall before going in and smooching Allison passionately.<br />
<br />
There were some definite changes in the rest of the class. One of the jocks named Tom was definitely looking older, much like Kendall, though it seemed he was proceeding further than he was. Tom&#39;s hairline looked impacted a bit, retreating slightly, though his muscles were thicker and larger than usual, though not exactly in a toned way. He did look happy with it though. Alex decided even so he would need to talk with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, class. Let&#39;s get to work on history.&quot; Alex started, sitting down at his desk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looking hot today, Mr. Clark!&quot;<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t know who or where that shout out came from, but Alex shook his head. Best deal with that now before it got too out of control. &quot;Now,&quot; Alex shook his head, &quot;I know you guys and gals like to give me compliments, but we really do have to start class. And that&#39;s hardly appropriate.&quot; As Alex got together some papers for the projector, he got up and started over toward it. His back was tighter in his shirts than usual, which he usually enjoyed - but today he heard some young woman shout over the throng as he started getting the projector running;<br />
<br />
&quot;DILF!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Flattering, young lady, but again. Inappropriate. I&#39;m not some online model for you to gawk at. I&#39;m your teacher...&quot; He did admit being recognized for being attractive was...kind of hot in and of itself? Chad did say he had a very nice body for a 60 year old man, but in line with what he saw, Alex doubted he was exactly 60 physically any more. He looked at his dress shirt, open a few buttons lower than usual, and thought about buttoning it back up. Maybe...maybe that&#39;d help.<br />
<br />
But the shirt hardly fit well enough to do that. He&#39;d need some new shirts.<br />
<br />
Were they not taking him as seriously as usual? Alex looked around the room as he got the projector working. &quot;Alright, today we&#39;ll be learning about the causes and effects leading up to the first World War. Particularly the---&quot; He trailed off briefly, registering the look of appreciation Ross and Bryan were giving him, the way it seemed Allison was half concerned half checking him out, and the way so many of the men in here had these interesting little changes that seemed to make it difficult for Alex to concentrate.<br />
<br />
&quot;The rise of...of alliances and their effect on the global trade and political situation.&quot; He breathed and found himself wondering. Kendall looked like he wasn&#39;t eager to go right ahead into the fray of the questions today. &quot;I&#39;ll hand out some...some worksheets, and once you&#39;re finished, put them up on my desk.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex started handing out the worksheets, trying not to get distracted by the way the students - and the technically-students - looked. He stood for a half a minute longer in front of Kendall&#39;s desk than he knew he should have, and Kendall could tell that this was happening. The young (?) man looked at Alex and tilted his head, &quot;Is...everything alright, professor?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Kendall, everything&#39;s fine. Everything&#39;s...good.&quot; Alex&#39;s biceps were not fitting into his shirt all that well, which he hoped was not a harbinger of further changes. Fuck, he hoped Mason wasn&#39;t changing even more.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, sir, you look different.&quot; Kendall whispered, &quot;I can&#39;t be the only one noticing this shit. How about we talk after class?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex could...control himself by then. He wasn&#39;t about to make any moves on Allison&#39;s boyfriend, even as changed as he was, Alex was by far more principled than that even with the transformation underway. He could however appreciate just how aesthetically muscled Kendall was now, and the way his rough and somewhat country-like attire compared and contrasted with his smooth, built physique. &quot;Yeah, that...may be wise.&quot; He handed Kendall the worksheet and kept walking.<br />
<br />
Allison turned to look at Kendall, and asked, &quot;What was that about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Teach wants to talk to me about all this stuff going on. I figure he might know some stuff.&quot; Kendall shrugged.<br />
<br />
Allison by now was noticing that Kendall&#39;s voice and speaking habits were...different. He was not quite as acutely intelligent as usual, and while he was still observant, it was in a different sense. His manner was different too. She still looked forward to an encounter with him, but wondered how Kendall might carry himself sexually, especially with her. He seemed to behave kind of like an older man now. Allison stated, &quot;I&#39;ll...stay then after class too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The more the better.&quot; Kendall responded, &quot;Let&#39;s focus on the work. Speaking of, can you help me with this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison sighed and figured the changes would be hitting his mind. In retrospect all that went on before was probably leading up to this. Those weird mental moments he had. But she wasn&#39;t going to abandon Kendall or talk down to him over this. Besides, it wasn&#39;t really his fault. &quot;Alright, let&#39;s see...&quot;</p>
