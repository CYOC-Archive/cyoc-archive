<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Not long after your panic attack, and getting yourself cleaned up, you hear the doorbell ring. Shit shit shit.. Now isn&#39;t the time, you think! Waddling over to door, while wearing one of your curtains ( it&#39;s the only thing able to cover your body now.. ) you look through the peep hole, it&#39;s your boyfriend! He&#39;s a handsome, superficial business man & you know there&#39;s no damn way in hell he&#39;ll accept this even if he does love you. Though you longed to see him, you decide to ignore the ringing & wait it out pretending you&#39;re not home! You try adjusting your weight and shifting your wait to your other leg, as you were becoming tired resulting you to fall backwards, &quot;dammit, that hurt!!&quot; you moan, but then covering your mouth you realize how suspicious that sounded.<br />
Your boyfriend shouts out, &quot;Who&#39;s in there? Where is Emily?&quot;<br />
Knowing you can&#39;t fool him with your changed voice, you reply &quot;Emily is out, she&#39;ll be back in a uhh.. week! Just text her!&quot;<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t let you rob her, I&#39;m going to kick your ass!&quot; He shouted, opening the door with his spare key. Opening the door, you look up at him horrified, a half naked blob sitting on the floor. While he thinks you look.. familiar, he wastes no time pulling out his phone, after he&#39;s stepped inside & closes the door. &quot;You must be some pervert, I&#39;m calling the cops you pig!&quot;<br />
<br />
With a rush of adrenaline, you haul yourself up and throw yourself on top of him. No way he is he calling the cops on you for people to see what you are now!! &quot;Seth give me the phone!!!!!&quot; He cripples under your weight, dropping the phone unable to even yell as he&#39;s being smothered by your huge belly. You use your newfound strength to push him down, and sit your ass on his face while you snatch his phone, you&#39;re actually kind of proud of how you handled it! Becoming slick with your sweat, he&#39;s trying to swat at you from underneath, and you accidentally release a sequence of monster farts, the last one feeling kind of wet. You apologize, promising to get up once you destroy his phone. Then, you&#39;ll deal with this mess! Now that he&#39;s finally quiet, you decide to tell him the truth. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t tell you right away but.. It&#39;s me, Emily. I bought a potion as a joke from that witchy store, and it permanently made me into this...&quot; You go on to explain that you&#39;re a man now, and you have a hard time even controlling your bowels. You start crying when you feel him start to do what feels like, pushing you off? Another rumbling in your gut and you release more farts into his face, deciding he&#39;s had enough you try to get off but it&#39;s so hard! All the while he seems to be pushing you higher and higher, he always was a muscley one you thought... With another gassy explosion, you finally lift yourself off and see that he&#39;s become.. obese!<br />
<br />
Heaving himself up, he yells &quot;You just ASSAULTED ME and tried to kill me!&quot; he begins to accuse you, until he looks down at his body. His still growing body.. You begin to tear up, &quot;I&#39;m sorry Seth it&#39;s all my fault!&#39; <br />
&quot;What is happening to m-- BUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRPPPPPP&quot; Covering his mouth with two chubby hands, he&#39;s in utter shock. Suddenly... You have a selfish thought. Maybe you can keep him like this forever... Who knows how permanent this is? &quot;Wait.. there&#39;s an antidote but you have to trust me and take it! There&#39;s no guarantee but you have to try!&quot; He agrees, tugging at his tshirt that was now riding up his ridiculously large belly, moobs spilling out with large areolas, jiggling with every deep breath.  When you return with the potion, you mix mostly weight gain with a bit of the slobby one to ensure it becoming permanent, you see his changes have stopped. He was pinching at his big fatty lovehandles, another ~135+ pounds heavier he looked defeated. &quot;No time to explain, drink here!&quot; You pour a hefty amount down his throat, and pat his head. &quot;If you&#39;re lucky, it&#39;ll reverse. If not, you could uhm.. Gain more wait&quot; you say quickly, waiting for the results, just like you planned he started to become larger! <br />
<br />
He was standing when it started again, his stomach started to sag over his cock which was beginning to grow, what started as 4 inches had grown into a 9inch cock! Lifting up his belly to check on his dick, a pair of hairy lips were growing as well. He was becoming a... Hermaphrodite. His crotch tingled,  He felt his ass expand more, slowly tearing the fabric of his shorts. His shirt finally burst, and he felt another chin flop onto his belly. Ripping a huge fart, his stomach sagged further still under his arms, his doughy hands losing all definition & making his knuckles near invisible! His massive moobs sag heavily on either side, his stomach resting on something new? His crotch felt like it was growing, doing his best to hold up his belly to look he watched in horror as he grew a jiggly new fupa, almost looking like a second belly. His sausage like arms sagged back in defeat, as his body continuing to inflate to a monstrous 750lbs. Despite being huge, he was completely molbile! He was now sitting, thinking it was almost over when.. A warm log squishes into the back of his butt. And another, and another! They spread across his back and he no longer has the will to move horrified he realizes he didn&#39;t even know he had to go. He had become completely bowel incontinent...</p>
