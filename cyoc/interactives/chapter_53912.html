<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty decided that in order to really get revenge on Dustin for all the torment that he received for 4 years, he needed to do something big to him. After coming up with an idea that he thought was brilliant, Ty wished that it was time for both Dustin and himself to go to bed.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Dustin had a strange dream. He felt like he was becoming much less mature than Ty. He had no control, and was forced to submit to his fate. He woke up in a daze. Everything seemed fuzzy. He stood up, stumbling around. Everything seemed so tall, it must have been a dream. He walked past a mirror on the wall that was close to the ground. Looking back at Dustin was a 3 feet tall toddler. &quot;What?&quot;, thought Dustin. &quot;Why am I a baby?&quot; This must just be a dream, he figured. He would have to deal with it until it ended. He walked into the living room, where he saw his parents, Mark and June, 13 years younger. &quot;Hi, Dustin! Oh, you're so cute!&quot; June picked him up and sat him on her lap. Dustin had no idea what to do. He subconsciously began sucking his thumb. <br />
<br />
The phone rang and Mark answered. &quot;Hello? Yes. Alright, if it's important, then we'll be there.&quot; He hung up. &quot;Who was that, honey?&quot; &quot;It was Dr. Howard. He says that the results of the chromosomal studies that were done on Dustin when he was a kid are finally done. He says that he wanted to talk to us in person, and he wanted to give Dustin an extra check-up. Dustin stared at Mark. Chromosomal? What did that mean again? Nothing seemed to make sense in his mind. He began to feel drowsy, and fell asleep on June's lap.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Dustin woke up after what seemed like a short nap. He was still a toddler, and, like when he fell asleep, he was sitting on June's lap. Looking around, he noticed that he was in the waiting room of a doctor's office. &quot;This must be that doctor I was supposed to go to,&quot; thought Dustin. &quot;Man, this dream keeps going...&quot; What was happening that he was having such a long, drawn-out dream? Was the dream reaching into his memories, showing him things that happened to him when he was very young? But he didn't remember anything about a chromosomal something...<br />
<br />
When it was time, June took Dustin into the doctor's exam room with Mark. A man wearing a white coat stood there waiting. &quot;Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Patterson. And I see you've brought Dustin. Very good.&quot; In the next few minutes, the doctor began examining Dustin with a stethoscope and checking everything. &quot;Okay, it's time that I get to the data. As you might remember, when June was pregnant with Dustin, we noticed a strange abnormality with Dustin's chromosomes. His karyotype, the diagram of chromosomes, showed that his Y chromosome was misshapen. It was a strange find, but it seemed to have two small points on it, where it could continue growing and adding DNA. After 3 years of research, we determined that it would eventually stop when the Y chromosome became an X chromosome.&quot; Mark and June looked confused, and Dustin could barely understand any of the words the doctor was saying.<br />
<br />
&quot;What I'm trying to say is that Dustin, after several years, will be completely female.&quot; June gasped. &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;I'm as surprised as you are, June. This is a very rare case that I have not seen before. Dustin is male now. In several years, possibly when he begins entering school, he will take on the appearance of a girl. As he develops, his sex organs will shrink, and eventually sink into his body, forming female ones.&quot; &quot;Oh god!&quot;, cried June. The doctor kept speaking. &quot;By the time he's around 13, he will be just the same as a normal teenage girl.&quot; &quot;Doctor, is there anything we can do? Why is this happening?&quot;, asked Mark. &quot;No, I can't see anything solving this problem. Again, Dustin's case is a very rare one. The chromosome is causing female growth hormones to be released instead of male ones. There's no way modern science can fix this.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What can we do?&quot; The doctor thought for a moment. &quot;Well, you should probably begin raising Dustin as a girl. Treat him as a girl, get him new clothes, possibly even change his name. Then, when Dustin is old enough to understand, you can explain his situation to him. Although, then, he might be a girl. This is a life-changing adjustment, Mrs. Sanderson, but it's best that we do this now, before he ends up starting elementary school. I know that school kids like to make fun of boys who like to do girl things. However, by the time he starts kindergarten, he will look like a girl. No one will notice the difference.&quot; &quot;Alright, doctor.&quot;, said Mark. &quot;We'll try to adjust to this.&quot;<br />
<br />
June picked Dustin up and carried him out of the doctor's room. &quot;Oh, Mark, what can we do?&quot; &quot;Honey, we just need to do as he said and raise him as a girl. It won't be that hard. You always said you wanted a daughter, anyway.&quot; Dustin, listening to all of this, was stunned. He was going to become a girl? This was a dream, no doubt about it. These weren't his memories... Unless, it was real. &quot;Wait... It has to be that bastard, Ty!&quot;, thought Dustin. &quot;He made me look like a 13 year old! He must have done this to me!&quot; He felt like crying, but his infant emotions did not understand what he was going through. He only felt like taking a nap. He fell asleep in the car, hoping to wake up from this strange nightmare.</p>
