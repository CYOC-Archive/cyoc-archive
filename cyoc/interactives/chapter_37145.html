<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenny felt her stomach tingle as she was frozen to the spot. She wanted to go over to Kyle <br />
and beat the crap out of him but couldn't move, not willingly anyway, as she soon <br />
discovered as she felt her arms move on their own and begin to undress her. Her top came <br />
off first, followed by her skirt. Socks and shoes were removed in seconds and were quickly <br />
followed by her bra and panties, all the while, Jenny tried in vain to struggle, unaware that <br />
all her hair other than that on her head had vanished without a trace.<br />
<br />
Standing naked in front of all her friends (and Kyle), Jenny found herself climbing onto the <br />
bench where a space was cleared and a large board was placed ready for her to be placed <br />
on. As she was settled down she went down onto her knees and spread her legs while her <br />
back arched back thrusting out her breasts while her arms were placed behind her to hold <br />
her balance. Humiliated at her forced exposure and exhibition, Jenny was forced to watch <br />
as her skin took on a pale yellow hue and a spongy texture. Her flesh became the same <br />
sponge as her bones shrank and became almost liquid. Suddenly she was unable to breath <br />
as her lungs and other organs vanished, as did her now useless tongue. Her mouth was <br />
dry until it became coated in a thick red 'slime' but Jenny couldn't taste what it was any <br />
more. Her long blonde hair became like long, soft strands of some sort of sugary mixture <br />
as Jenny felt something run down her face from her scalp. The unknown flow covered her <br />
face completely but didn't obscure her vision, mouth or nose in any way, and began to <br />
spread down her shoulders and arms, coating them in a thick, sweet layer of pale icing. It <br />
covered her breasts and dripped slowly down to her legs, but Jenny didn't notice that latter <br />
part, she was more concerned about what she could feel happening to her nipples and clit. <br />
They stood up and grew becoming larger and firmer before changing into something <br />
entirely different. Before long, Jenny had two strawberries standing prominent on her firm, <br />
pale mounds and a lush red glazed cherry nestled in her un-iced and red-filled slit.<br />
<br />
In horror, Jenny worked out what she was and identified what each part of her had <br />
become. Her flesh and blood was now nothing more than soft sponge cake while her <br />
bones had thinned and become a vein of delicious berry jam that ran throughout her body <br />
and presumably was what coated the inside of her empty mouth and naked pussy. Her <br />
skin had become sweet icing, as had her hair while her erogenous fruit lay exposed for all <br />
to see. The board she had been posed on was now obviously a tray to support her <br />
immobile, edible form and she soon discovered that the only part of her she could move <br />
was her head, which was placed so she had a full view of her icing covered torso, and even <br />
that was limited to her facial expression and small twitches to her neck.<br />
<br />
Jenny had always loved cake, ever since she was a little girl. However, in order to keep her <br />
figure so she could stay on the team she really had to watch what she ate, and cake was <br />
one of the things that had to go. Now, however she had all the cake she could ever want, <br />
and was the only person who couldn't eat it.<br />
<br />
Having mostly ignored her transformation, her friends turned to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah,&quot; said one, another cheerleader named Jess, &quot;You're done, that was good timing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes&quot; said another, a popular and attractive boy named Sam, &quot;We just finished our main <br />
lunch, now we get to try our new desert.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hang on&quot; said a second girl, who's name was Beth, &quot;I think we should give the first bite to <br />
the one who gave us her.&quot; She turned to the bench next to them, &quot;Ok, Kyle. Take your <br />
piece, just this once you can be seen with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle got up and walked over. Jenny could see the smugness in his face as he approached <br />
but he quickly changed it to surprise, &quot;Oh there's no need.&quot; said said, &quot;I'm just happy that I <br />
could help. But if you insist,&quot; he looked down at Jenny, who looked back in terror, &quot;I till <br />
take just one, small piece.&quot; He reached down and touched the cherry between Jenny's legs. <br />
&quot;This will do me fine, I'll leave you with the honors of talking the first slice.&quot;<br />
<br />
As he slowly plucked the fruit, Jenny tried to escape with everything she had but was held <br />
fast. If anything, the cherry was more sensitive to her original clit. When it was finally <br />
taken, Jenny silently screamed in pleasure, but with no breath to use, it was limited to the <br />
look on her face. However, it was not over yet. Kyle popped the fruit into his mouth, and <br />
Jenny could still feel everything as he worked it over with his tongue and finally swallowed <br />
it. Jenny's arousal was intense, but no matter what, no satisfaction of orgasm would come <br />
even as a bead of jam dribbled out of her crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I like you so much better like this&quot; said Jess, &quot;I just can't wait to taste you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks to Kyle here,&quot; said Sam, &quot;You're now the sweetest girl in school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the best part is,&quot; said Beth, &quot;you're not at all fattening!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who wants the first slice?&quot; asked Sam, pulling out a knife, which made Jenny pale, even in <br />
the wake of her pleasurable torment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot; squealed Beth, &quot;Me! Me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Beth took the knife and made a cut to Jenny's right knee. Surprisingly enough, it was not <br />
painful, it just felt odd and when it was eaten she felt like her knee was being tickled <br />
relentlessly, forcing her to uselessly struggle. By the time the others had all taken slices, <br />
about a quarter of her right leg was gone while all Jenny could feel from it was a slowly <br />
fading tickle that she could not hope to stop.</p>
