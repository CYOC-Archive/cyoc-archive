<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>1 gold = 1 days feed (poor)<br/>
10 silvers = 1 gold<br/>
10 coppers = 1 silver</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gorim pulled out a glass vial filled with a dark green liquid.<br />
<br />
&quot;This here is a Potion of Orcish Strength&quot; Gorim claimed &quot;It&#39;ll make ye strong as an orc and able to take on any hooligans who would come to rough ye up!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow!&quot; exclaimed Danor, before dishearteningly noting &quot;Those are really expensive aren&#39;t they? I can&#39;t afford that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Unfortunately true,&quot; Gorim said solemnly before perking up &quot;But I think a clever fellow such as yerself is going to make it big given the chance, hows about we strike a deal, I&#39;ll sell this to ye for fifty gold pieces now, and after ye make yer fortune in Goldwick, when I return this way or should ye ever come by Stonehill ye&#39;ll pay me back the full price plus a little extra, no more than a thousand gold pieces!&quot;<br />
<br />
It sounded like a great deal but Danor hesitated &quot;Even fifty gold is a lot for me right now...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A well educated man like yerself will have plenty of prospects in Goldwick,&quot; Gorim assured him &quot;ye&#39;ll make the money back in no time, but ye can&#39;t afford to be stint on your safety.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But how will I know the potion will work...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would never sell faulty wares to a customer!&quot; Gorim defended, seemingly shocked at the very idea &quot;But if ye insist ye can drink it first and pay after witnessing it&#39;s effects&quot;<br />
<br />
Gorim picked up two rocks off the ground and handed them to Danor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now throw the lighter one as far as you can, once you drink the potion ye&#39;ll easily throw the second farther. Not by much mind, ye don&#39;t look like ye&#39;ve eaten a hearty meal in days and the potion takes a while to take effect. Once ye get a proper feed in the effects will really begin to take place. But it&#39;ll prove to ye the potion works. Deal?&quot;<br />
<br />
Danor contemplated for a minute, he couldn&#39;t really see a downside and agreed. His pudgy arms hurled the rock, and they watched it bounce and roll to a stop several yards away.<br />
<br />
&quot;A good toss lad, but lets see how ye do with the potion.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danor popped open the vial and swigged it down, coughing and spluttering. It tasted like mud and sweat, but he began feeling the effects immediately. He felt his muscles tighten ever so slightly and already the rock felt lighter in his arm. Once he recovered from the taste of the potion, he sent the rock sailing through the air, landing a good two feet farther than the first.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent throw lad!&quot; Gorim praised &quot;Come weeks end, ye&#39;ll be strong enough to take on any brute what tries to give ye a hard time, or I&#39;ll shave m&#39;beard and eat it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Gorim,&quot; gushed Danor as he reached for his pouch to bring out fifty gold pieces &quot;I really hope I can repay you for your generosity!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I respect an honest man such as yourself!&quot; Gorim grinned as he took the gold handed to him &quot;And I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll come by a steady income soon enough!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I should hope so!&quot; Danor chirped &quot;But we best continue moving or we&#39;ll not make it to the city before night fall&quot;<br />
<br />
Gorim jumped and looked at the sky.<br />
<br />
&quot;My stones yer right,&quot; Gorim concurred as he climbed back onto his cart, &quot;It seems the passin&#39; of time has slipped me by what with such pleasant company,  sorry to be leavin&#39; ye but I&#39;ll have to ride ahead. I&#39;ve an appointment in the city to keep&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s quite understandable&quot; Danor accepted. &quot;Thank you again for your kindness good sir!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d offer you a ride but me old ass is weary&quot; Gorim chucked nodding to his donkey &quot;But I trust your new found strength will keep you well on your path. Farewell!&quot;<br />
<br />
Gorim waved back as his donkey trotted ahead. Danor continued at a steady pace, but found his previously weary and sore legs were full of renewed vigor.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t long before he started to come across the farmland that encircled the city. There were various people working the lands, though mostly humans there were a few dwarfs crafting materials, halflings tending to livestock and orcs performing manual labor. After a few minutes Danor heard a loud bellowing from one of the fields.<br />
<br />
&quot;How many times do I have to beat it into you Gorg?&quot; yelled an old farmer, smacking a large orc across the head with a shovel &quot;Take the hay from the north field to the south! Not the other way around numb skull!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oww&quot; moaned Gorg &quot;Sorry boss&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Get this all cleared up&quot; ordered the farmer &quot;Or there&#39;ll be no ale for you tonight&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Noooooo&quot; Gorg wailed as he started shoveling hay back into a cart &quot;Gorg want ale&quot;<br />
<br />
Danor chuckled but continued walking. Several fields down he heard a loud rhythmic thudding sound coming from ahead. He gradually began to approach another orc, this one chopping wood. Danor watched him as he approached, and when he was within speaking distance the orc eyed him back with a glare.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep lookin&#39; at Hurk if you lookin&#39; for beatin&#39;&quot; The orc growled as he thumped his wood ax against his thick calloused palm.<br />
<br />
Danor squeaked, averted his gaze and hurried past. Though he might be stronger than ever before, he wasn&#39;t about to start getting into fights for no reason.<br />
<br />
When the angry woodcutter was far behind him Danor breathed deeply and continued on his way. As the sky began to glow orange the city gate came in sight. He breathed a sigh of relief at the prospect of getting away from all these strange folk, when suddenly what he thought to be a pile of rags on the side of the road jumped up to reveal another filthy orc.<br />
<br />
&quot;Spare coin?&quot; He begged with his hands cupped<br />
<br />
&quot;uhh s-sorry I can&#39;t&quot; Danor stuttered before hastily gathering speed, but the beggar was not dissuaded<br />
<br />
&quot;Fat man in nice clothes must haff much gold!&quot; the orc declared running ahead of him and turning around &quot;Berg suck rich man cock for silffer piece!&quot;<br />
<br />
Berg as he called himself, grinned baring his tusks. His smile was absolutely filthy and he was missing several teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no thanks! I&#39;m not interested&quot; stammered Danor, baffled at what to do, he looked down quickening to a light jog.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh rich man like receiffing  then!&quot; Berg declared not yet discouraged he sprinted ahead yet again and lifted his dirty loin cloth to reveal a thick dark green 7 inch penis hanging between his legs. <br />
<br />
The size of the orc&#39;s penis coming into Danor&#39;s view and actually did surprise him to a halt.<br />
<br />
&quot;buh-wha-I-&quot; flubbed Danor<br />
<br />
&quot;Berg giff rich man bouncy ride for shiny coin!&quot; He confidently declared as he waggled his obscene member back and forth. It was covered in grime and there were flies buzzing around it undeterred by the swishing movement.<br />
<br />
A shout came out from behind Berg and Danor tore his eyes away from the veiny appendage and past the dirty orc to see an armored man striding towards them<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-oh, guard coming, rich man come back for Berg penis later yes!&quot; Berg smiled and ran off, his cock still exposed and bouncing up and down as he dove into the bushes by the side of the road and vanished.<br />
<br />
The burly human guard caught up to Danor. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you all right&quot; He asked &quot;We&#39;ve had problem with that one before, harassing travelers and what not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, thank you for coming along&quot; Danor said &quot;I was in quite some trouble with that beast&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Dimwitted, degenerate, delinquents the lot of them if you ask me.&quot; The guard opined &quot;Come along I&#39;ll walk you the rest of the way to the gate&quot;<br />
<br />
Danor nodded in agreement. He had not met many orcs in Ashbrook but the ones he had were all some combination of stupid, violent or foul and it seemed the orcs in Goldwick were no different.<br />
<br />
They reached the gate without incident.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a moment&quot; halted the guard &quot;There&#39;s a gold piece entry tax before I can let you in&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh&quot; sighed Danor, rummaging through his pouch again and producing some coins &quot;Here you go, and a little silver for helping me back there&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to Goldwick.&quot; The guard declared quickly pocketing the money, before he leaned in and whispered &quot;There aren&#39;t as many green-hides in the city but you best keep an eye out, they&#39;re still lurking around causing trouble. The Blue Fiddle is where you&#39;ll be wanting to stay for peace of mind, if you can afford it&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you very much&quot; said Danor as he entered the town. Right from the gate several inns were clearly visible. He decided until the potion took full effect it was probably best to steer clear of the seedier establishments and headed to The Blue Fiddle on the guards recommendation, clearly the cleanest and cheeriest looking one.</p>
