<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With Trevor&#39;s final words the ooze seemed to smile and began to dissipate within his own skin. At first it felt as if he was being wrapped within a cold cocoon and eventually the sensation faded away and so did the ooze. Trevor stood for a moment in silence, wondering if he had just made up the experience in his mind. With his first he suddenly felt a twinge of energy flow through him, the symbiote had fully set itself in place and began the glorious transformation process right in the echoing chambers of the locker room. A perfect place to birth a new and studly man of athletic status.<br />
     Within moment his shoes began to feel tight as every heartbeat extended his shoe size by one and thickening his toes as well. With a gasp of energy and a giggle from the symbiote, Trevor was astonished to see his shoes tear to shreds as two size 15 manly feet were revealed. Trevor was filled with happiness as he wiggled his larger toes, nails manicuring themselves to be clean. The boy knew that these large feet are what will be needed to hold up a much bigger body than his current one. Without notice, his thin legs began to quake with what felt like adrenaline. His view slowly began to change as he realized he was finally becoming taller as he had always wanted to be. He could hear the cracking of his hips and leg bones restructuring themselves with no pain to become so much stronger than before. The toning of muscle quickly began to follow from his calves, they bulged as if he had been training them his whole life. Vascular veins began to spread on his legs to feed the growing muscles. Within a few breaths, Trevor was looking down at his skintight shorts knowing what was to come next. Tree trunk thighs tore themselves through, revealing platforms of leg muscle that flex with every movement. Quickly following in, Trevor felt why the shift of his hips had occurred. Slowly his thin ass began to balloon with muscle, he couldn&#39;t help but squat to test out his new lower form which only quickened the grow. He peeked behind him to see two globes of delicious man muscle and before he could explore, his crotch began to tighten and Trevor through his head back in pleasure. <br />
     He had already brought up his usual boner, but this pleasure was going to forever change what he was used to. He looked down in awe again to witness his bulge expand and thicken with ease in a few seconds followed by the two satisfying drops of two alpha male balls filling themselves with new hormones meant for a powerful body. He wanted to release and begin playful exploration immediately but as he went to reach for his new member, the symbiote stopped his hands and begin the process up the upper body. It was time to craft a form of statuesque beauty to inhabit. <br />
     Trevor arched his back as it began to inch upwards slowly to create more room for masculinity to pave its way in. &quot;Extend&quot; the symbiote says. With two sudden pops, his shoulders extended outward and began to fill with rounded muscle, this allowed for the layers in his back begin to dance along themselves as he began to take up even more space just by standing tall with his strong posture. A quake in his stomach revealed his Adonis belt carving itself in, followed by even more cum gutters dicing them into his flexing core until a solid 8 pack had stacked upon itself. Every breath they flexed and with the latter breath, a pec burst with meat forward surprising Trevor. The other slowly followed and they began to bounce as if they were their own beings for a moment. Nipples began growing more sensitive and with a deep rush of testosterone, Trevor and the symbiote both moaned. The room filled with manly bass as his Adams apple grew forward to forever leave behind his boyish voice. Now just his speech could make any person swoon. <br />
      With the urge to flex his expanding arms, Trevor did so and with every pump of fresh blood being put through his bigger body, the peaks increased, and the triceps followed only to be complimented by his now cut shoulder and muscular pits that begin producing an intoxicating jockish aroma. With a leak of pre-cum from his giant rod, hair began to slightly grow around his big body to accentuate his new manliness even more. Hair dusted itself with expertise along his thick thighs, among his bouncing beautiful chest and now his jaw with a sudden itch. He reached up and was astonished at his new jockish hands shaping themselves and expanding the palms for maximum groping potential, this distracted him from the sudden clench in his jaw squaring out and his nose shaping itself into perfection. Cheek bones raising themselves and hair gaining volume, he was prettier than even Gods have dreamt about. <br />
<br />
The symbiote and Trevor began trembling with laughter and power, the combination felt fantastic for both of them. &quot;Now it is sealed!&quot; they both exclaim and with that, their new large manhood lurched from its lemon sized balls and erupted forward countless strands of alpha seed. For what felt like minutes, Trevor came and orgasmed in maximum manly pleasure. Flexing and sweating as he did, cum piling itself across his big muscles and furry body. He fell to his strong knees and leaned forward, his bubble ass bouncing as he did. He smiled and within his mind heard the voice of his new pal &quot;Let&#39;s continue.&quot; And so, his cock filled with energy again and his hand immediately knew what to do. The two would fill this world with their new and perfect seed to those they find worthy or in need of a little masculinities. <br />
<br />
With a couple of thoughts, Trevor could hear the countless souls out in the world who crave to become the men they want to be or to pleasure. The two now had real purpose.</p>
