<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John looked over and saw David being cornered by Scott again. He knew the two seniors weren&#39;t friends. Scott liked to pick on the smaller guy and make him feel weak. John had tried stepping in a few times but David refused to take his help. Without him standing up to Scott the bullying wouldn&#39;t stop. His mind turned back to the chronivac. He instantly started typing.<br />
<br />
&#39;Each time Scott picks on David, David gains 10% more weight and a half of inch in height. Scott doesn&#39;t notice that David is growing.&#39; John figured an inch would be a little too much. The 5&#39;6&quot; guy didn&#39;t need to grow that much. And besides he needed to have some muscles attached to his bones. He could already see it start working as Scott shoved David further into the gym. John leaned back watching the 100 pound guy gain an extra 10 pounds. He watches as the thin arms gained a slight definition to them. Nothing too huge but still a noticeable difference. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going. I&#39;m going,&quot; David whined. Scott had pushed him again. He stood an inch taller now and at 121 pounds. The medium sized gym shirt looked like it fit on his scrawny frame. &quot;I don&#39;t get why you have to do this to me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cause you&#39;re a pussy,&quot; Scott mocked. He was still standing a few inches taller than David. His six foot frame and natural athletic frame made it easy for him to put on muscle. However, David had gained another 12 pounds putting his weight up to 133. John instantly realized the problem. He was gaining weight too quickly. He&#39;d be far too heavy for how tall he was going to be. &quot;If you weren&#39;t such a bitch I&#39;d probably pick on someone else,&quot; Scott mocked.<br />
<br />
John watched as David grew to 5&#39;8&quot;. He was still a good four inches shorter than Scott so he barely came up to his nose. But there was a difference in his posture. He was standing straighter. The 146 pound guy didn&#39;t look like he was going to take it as easily. John still needed to fix his mistake. Instantly typing, &#39;David is 5&#39;9&quot; and gains an inch each time Scott picks on him.&#39; He was glad he gave the guy an extra inch. Because as he hit the period, Scott must have done something. Because now David was almost eye level with him. His 160 pound frame actually looked like it could be in a fight. He obviously still didn&#39;t want one but didn&#39;t look like he was as easy to push around.<br />
<br />
&quot;You think you could?&quot; David asked. There was something menacing about the way he said it.<br />
<br />
Scott didn&#39;t like that. &quot;What was that bitch?&quot; 5&#39;11, 176 pounds. He pushed him asserting his dominance. 6&#39;, 193 pounds. David was staring him right in the eye unflinching. His shirt straining against his grown size. It rode up past his belly button showing off his clear cut abs. The sleeves had rolled around his shoulders and fit neatly into his armpit while his chest pushed the fabric to the limit. Meanwhile his shorts had rose far above his knees and his shoes looked painfully tight. David didn&#39;t seem to mind. <br />
<br />
&quot;You think you could?&quot; David repeated. He moved closer to Scott.<br />
<br />
The bully was obviously seeing red. He wasn&#39;t going to let some short 100 pound twerp boss him around. He still hadn&#39;t noticed that David was bigger than he was. &quot;Really bitch?&quot; 6&#39;1&quot; 212 pounds. He tried to shove David again but his body didn&#39;t move. 6&#39;2&quot; 233 pounds. David&#39;s shirt had already started ripping before the shove but after it shot clean off. Whatever could have hung on tore to shreds. Toes pushed their way out of the fronts of his sneakers while they looked like they were about to be crushed on the sides as well. He stepped forward and grabbed Scott&#39;s forearm and squeezed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. I think so,&quot; David said confidently. His bodybuilder sized hands easier gripped the other man&#39;s wrists. Scott struggled as he tried to free himself. He couldn&#39;t budge. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck. You little fucking cocksucker,&quot; Scott yelled. 6&#39;3&quot; 256 pounds. The thin waist puffed out into a firm belly. Every part of his body started to grow larger and fuller. The large round arms were well past 20 inches round. Scott shoved at him again. 6&#39;4&quot; 281 pounds. His stomach grew a little even rounder with the rest of his body. The clear cut six pack abs were covered with just a tad of belly fat.<br />
<br />
David was absolutely massive. Scott barely came up to his chin. His large shirtless body could terrify anyone. Someone much bigger than Scott might be able to take him down. The over hundred pound difference made it nearly impossible for someone like him to cause any damage to him. But John remembered that Scott still thought he was the same 5&#39;6&quot; 100 pound wimp.<br />
<br />
&#39;Scott can see just how big David is.&#39; John typed quickly hoping it would be before he added another 30 pounds to David&#39;s hulking body. Scott blinked a few times realizing what was going on. &#39;Was I really about to fight David?!&#39; his eyes went wide seeing the giants hand easy wrap around his forearm. He backed up slightly realizing his mistake. David let go of him. &quot;Whatever man. Didn&#39;t think you&#39;d be such a little cock sucker,&quot; Scott said. <br />
<br />
David&#39;s body started growing again. His massive arms grew even bigger while his feet were easily twice the size they&#39;d been when they started. &quot;6&#39;5&quot; 309 pounds...&quot; John muttered. He had to put a stop to this. Scott was obviously too stupid to back off. &#39;David doesn&#39;t grow from Scott&#39;s insults any more.&#39; However that didn&#39;t feel like it was enough. &#39;Scott gives 5 inches to David.&#39; Instantly Scott&#39;s head tilted back more. David was pushing 6&#39;10&quot; and his broad shoulders and hulking body would intimidate even the strongest most arrogant guy. Now the over foot difference would have to scare off the other guy.</p>
