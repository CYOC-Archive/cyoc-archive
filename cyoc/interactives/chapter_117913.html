<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Harold Jenkins led his fiance Virginia McCoy through the back of his house and out the rear door.<br />
Now standing on his back porch, Harold couldn&#39;t wait to take the lady in his arms and start kissing her.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t understand this. Mind you, I&#39;m not complaining about it, but I just don&#39;t understand it,&quot; he said.<br />
&quot;What darling?&quot; wondered Virginia between kisses.<br />
&quot;Since you accepted my marriage proposal, I feel as giddy as a school kid on Christmas morning, looking at a tree surrounded by presents.&quot;<br />
&quot;Trust me honey, you&#39;re no kid,&quot; replied Virginia, reaching down to feel the growing bulge in his pants, &quot;but I know what you mean. It&#39;s like a great weight has been lifted off of both of us since the police cleared me on possibly violating Statute 1A charges.*&quot;<br />
&quot;You know what I want to do now?&quot; asked Harold.<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
&quot;Three guesses, and the first two don&#39;t count,&quot; he kidded her, as Harold began hastily undressing Virginia.<br />
The two adults tore at each others&#39; clothing until they were both nude, their wardrobe discarded and ignored where it laid on the back porch. But soon the act of pawing and caressing each other took on a literal meaning as the engaged couple rapidly assumed their respective fursonas.<br />
Soon a weretigress was kissing the top of her mate&#39;s head as the weretiger was playing lovingly with her breasts.<br />
&quot;Harold.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes my love?&quot;<br />
&quot;Follow me, please,&quot; requested Virginia, taking him by a paw and leading Harold out into the open backyard of his property.<br />
Letting go, Virginia gave him a quick kiss on the tip of his nose before turning around. Swaying her hips and swishing her tail seductively, the weretigress took a couple of steps forward before getting down onto the ground in a crouching position.<br />
Then she raised her tail straight up as she repositioned her rear before saying, &quot;Claim your mate darling! Let all the world know that we&#39;re together, now and forever!&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes ma&#39;am!&quot; said Harold happily, eager to get into position to fuck his fiance <i>doggie</i> style from behind.<br />
Virginia moaned in pure pleasure as she felt Harold&#39;s barbed penis penetrate her depths.<br />
Harold moved his paws so that one was teasing the throbbing clit above her now very filled pussy while the other was doing its best to caress her breasts.<br />
Soon a rhythm was established between the two adults, who started roaring in pleasure upon the arrival of each orgasm either given or experienced.<br />
The only change in the happy couple was that the weretiger roars were now being issued practically in unison as they continued to share in their orgasmic bliss together.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
It had taken a while for Alice Decrux to reposition her car across the other side of her neighborhood without being spotted by any police. Having not talked to her lawyer since this morning, Alice wasn&#39;t sure what was going on with the potential case against her, let alone with where things stood with her endangering Virginia McCoy&#39;s freedom by making sure it was the weretigress who had &quot;accidentally&quot; scratched Harold Jenkins instead of herself.<br />
Sure, the were-raccoon wanted to claim the normal for herself, let alone give birth to his offspring in hopes of continuing her long term scheme to collect child support from another unsuspecting man, but for some unknown reason(s), things were NOT going according to plan this time.<br />
Now with the car secured on the opposite side of the area, Alice had carefully worked her way through the backwoods in an attempt to get as close to the rear of the Jenkins and McCoy houses as she could in order to spy on both parties and try to figure out what might be going on, when her were senses picked up a scent she was quite familiar with.<br />
Two weres having hot and heavy, no holds barred sex.<br />
Having always been a bit of a voyeur, Alice carefully drew closer, wondering who might be engaged in her favorite past time.<br />
Having seen her fursona before, Alice recognized the weretigress as she drew near, but it still took her a moment before it finally dawned on her who the weretiger was.<br />
Then, as if she needed any further confirmation, Alice could hear Virginia shout, &quot;Oh Harold! Keep it up my wonderful fiance! I&#39;m...&quot;<br />
And then both weretigers roared in mutual pleasure once more.<br />
<i>Fiance! NO!</i> Alice wanted to shout!<br />
Realizing that the battle for Harold Jenkins was lost and all she had left now was a strong desire for revenge, Alice Decrux turned and fled the scene before either somebody picked up her scent or saw her crying.<br />
<br />
INSIDE THE JENKINS HOUSEHOLD...<br />
After her father led his new fiance by the hand toward the kitchen and the backdoor of their house, Melissa Jenkins turned to face her boyfriend.<br />
&quot;That was a surprise,&quot; she said.<br />
&quot;Are you unhappy that your dad&#39;s now engaged? Or unhappy that he&#39;s engaged to our history teacher?&quot; wondered Trevor Tyson. He himself was a werebull, but was taking his time getting to know Melissa better, because if he did wind up being the one to induct her into were society, it would also be her first sexual experience.<br />
&quot;Neither. It&#39;s just the timing,&quot; replied Melissa. &quot;Dad&#39;s been a weretiger for what? About two days now? Granted, he mourned my mother for over 4 years, and will be the first to admit that despite the suddenness of finding out weres exist, was starting to develop feelings for Miss McCoy. But while I&#39;m happy that dad&#39;s found love, let alone that he&#39;s finally getting on with his life, it&#39;s just the rapid pace of it all.&quot;<br />
&quot;I understand,&quot; said Trevor. &quot;Many weres, and even some normals, think Moon Lake is magical. At least in the sense that we have a very special town.&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s definitely one of a kind,&quot; agreed Melissa.<br />
The two teenagers continued to talk for a bit about nothing of any major consequence, until they started to hear the joyous roaring coming from the backyard.<br />
&quot;Maybe I should say goodbye and leave for the night,&quot; suggested Trevor.<br />
Even a normal knew what Harold Jenkins and Virginia McCoy were doing in the backyard right now, because he could see his girlfriend start to blush.<br />
&quot;Trevor, I...&quot; began Melissa.<br />
