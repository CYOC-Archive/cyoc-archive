<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It normally didn&#39;t take too long to get to the store from Shane&#39;s appartment. Maybe a 10 minute walk at best since she lived right down the road. However it now felt like ages for Ryan, whose every step sent his breasts bouncing all over, constantly throwing off his center of balance and causing him to stumble here and there whenever they did an awkward bounce. Of course, the many looks from the crowd didn&#39;t help either. He now knew that every single one of them saw him as a gorgeous woman. <br />
<br />
This alone had made him somehow even more self conscious about the fact that his own view didn&#39;t match theirs. He didn&#39;t know if he looked goofy or nornal, or how his boobs acted. Did the female him wear a bra, or not? How is her makeup? Is her hair a mess after stumblingso many times? Even better, why does he even care so much about these things? Luckily Shane was right next to him to calm his worries.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, just go slow ok. There is no need to run, and whike I know you have a bra on, it literally is like 75% for show only, so if you jump like that, of course your boobs are going to still move around.&quot; Shane somewhat had understood your situation after explaining it to her. Of course she didn&#39;t fully believe such a thing was possible, but just incase, she was open to helping you out reguardless. So whenever she felt you lacked some kind of basic understanding about something, she would give you some advice.<br />
<br />
You both enter into the store and head directly towards the counter where the same girl from before is still working at. She sees you and grins &quot;Welcome, could I help you ladies with something? Oh, if I may ask, how do you like your new boots that you got?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Um, well I do love them, but that isn&#39;t exactly why I returned. I actually have a few questions&quot; replied Ryan. The girl nodded eagerly &quot;certanly Miss, I would be happy to help you if I can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright. Then to start off, those shoes I gave you earlier, I mistakenly handed you the wrong pair. Would I be able to get them back?&quot; Asked Ryan.<br />
<br />
The girl&#39;s face went from happy to a neutral expression. &quot;I am sorry, but our store policy prevents me from undoing any transactions, even if done so in error. As of the moment you handed them over, they had already stopped being your shoes. Additionally, they are no longer in the store at this time, as we have already sent out today&#39;s shipment, which included the pair you handed me, back to our manufacturer to be referbished. However, it looks like you have really taken to your new pair, and should soon become a perfect fit for eachother&quot; the girl said optimistically. <br />
<br />
Well, so much for getting your old shoes back. However she just presented you a good transition into your next concern. &quot;If they are already gone, then that is how it is. Now, about what you just said. What did you mean by become a perfect fit for eachother exactly?&quot;<br />
<br />
A look of surprise washed over the girl&#39;s face. &quot;Could it be that you are still unaware Miss? This isn&#39;t a normal shoe store. We take great pride in our footware, so much so that each piece is flawless and carried a uniqueness unlike any other. That also means that every pair is a one of a kind too. Now, when you normally buy footware, most people will pick and choose until they find one they like that fits. But here, since the footware is already perfect, it is the person that must be adjusted to fit. The process is harmless as in there is no additional pain whatsoever, and we guarantee that the fit will become perfect too, reguardless of what the feet look like, or who they belong to.&quot; <br />
<br />
Both Ryan and Shane were dumbfounded at the girls explination. &quot;Wait, so you really were not kidding then Ryan?!&quot; Shane cried out, pointing at Ryan. The clerk was the one to respond though. &quot;It can be hard to believe sonetimes, especially when a person undergoes such drastic alterations like she did, and if I am correct, still will continue to do so for a bit more. Please, tell me Miss. Ryan, how far along are you, or at least could you describe it to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan explained his situation to the clerk. After hearing his tale, she nodded again and answered him back. &quot;Right, so I would guess you are only just about 25, maybe 30%, of the way through your &quot;re-fitting&quot; as we call it. And while going from a man to a woman is extremely uncommon, it isn&#39;t impossible, and does happen from time to time. However this is the first time I believe that it has happened by accident, with some fault on both sides to boot&quot;she joked. &quot;But do not worry, even if the &quot;re-fitting&quot; is permanent, your new boots are actually one of, if not the best pair of footware we have ever made. So, while you may now be stuck as a woman, at least your natural beauty will be unrivaled, and if I am remembering it right, I believe there is a minor amount of included magical abilities too, mostly focused around appearance alterations though, since they are our specialty after all. However there are also a few secret functions which we normally are not suppose to disclose, but given your circumstances, I think letting you in on one of them will be the least we can do as an apology for the mishap. So, as for one of the secret functions, as long as you remain in direct contact with your target, you can change their appearance too. And it will never revert even if you stop touching them, so long as you finish all of their alterations before you let go. And you can always undo it at any point, even without directly touching them. Otherwise, if you break contact before they finish the changes, anything you did to them will just fade back to normal after just a few seconds.&quot; Informed the clerk as she waved her hands in a &quot;mysterious way&quot; in an attempt to look more magical and mystifying and set the mood. But, it didn&#39;t work how she likely imagined it would and she ended up looking like an idiot. <br />
<br />
&quot;Anyways&quot; the girl said rather nonchalantly even though she just a second ago looked fairly foolish, &quot;in order to use the ability simply touch the target and imagine the alteration you have in mind being applied to them. Quicker isn&#39;t always better as what really matters most is having a good mental image of the desired effect. The magic can fill in mlst if the blanks, but it needs a solid core concept to work from.undoing it is way easier. Just say &#39;undo (target&#39;s name)&#39; and either snap your finger or clap once. Understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan didn&#39;t even know what to say to answer that. He had so many new questions that he just didn&#39;t know where to start. After not hearing him answer for a while though as he was still busy aranging his thoughts, the girl just continued on. &quot;Oh, and you can set who realizes the differences you make at any time too. Lastly, we are not responsible for anything that happens when you alter other people. That is entirely on you. In addition, we can not reclaim the boots either, as they are already a part of your body now, and we don&#39;t deal with severed legs here unfortunately hehe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, um... Thanks for the information, I guess? But is there really no way to return me back to normal?&quot; Ryan asked desperately. <br />
<br />
Sympathizing with his plight, the clerk thought hard to see if she could come up with any ideas on the spot. After a few seconds she managed to put together a rough fix. &quot;I mean, it isnt perfect, but you could always just alter your own appearance, back into your old self. However it would still be a man in a pair of woman&#39;s boots if you did that since the boots can&#39;t be change if you are in a human form. That said, I am afraid that this is as close to a solution that I can give you at the moment. If I think of some orher way, I will be sure to let you know though. I truly wish I could be of more help to you than this.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ryan shook his head. &quot;No this is great as it is. I didn&#39;t even come in here expecting this much, let alone an actual rough solution. So I really appreciate it.&quot; After leaving his contact info, Ryan and Shane turned and left the store. Shane was tempted to find her own perfect pair, but after thinking about it, she didn&#39;t want to risk becoming someone completely different as she liked her current life enough as it currently is. After leaving, Shane suggested they finally have their now late lunch date together while observing how the remaining 70% of Ryan&#39;s change progresses. Both of them were actually mildly curious as to what his final for would be.</p>
