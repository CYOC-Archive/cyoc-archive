<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It felt like an eternity of silence as they say in downtown city traffic, the events of the day hanging over them like a heavy fog, Mantis&#39;s eyes glued to the road ahead, her grip on the wheel tight, Antonio couldn&#39;t think of anything to do or say, what do you say to someone who looses everything in one quick swoop?, what can he say?<br />
&quot;So.....where are we going?&quot; He asked, holding the Cybernetic girl tight in his arms as they slowly drove through the city, the bright neon lights and holographic projections shining vibrantly against her pale outer shell.<br />
Mantis let out a sigh, resting her head against the headrest of her seat<br />
&quot;Were gonna go to a friend of mine, their crew owe me some favours, we can crash there for a while&quot; she said, her voice dead and flat, Antonio nodded and continued to look out his window as the city passed by.<br />
<br />
Eventually Mantis pulled off Infront of a large apartment building, a large yellow neon sign stretching up the side of the building illuminating the shadows that the taller buildings cast, looking closely he noticed it depicted a tiger clawing it&#39;s way up the building like a feline version of king kong.<br />
&quot;Hey pretty boy, you coming or you frozen solid over there?&quot; Mantis called, Antonio quickly jogging over to join her by the front entrance to the building, clutching the girl tight in his arms, stopping as he came face to face with an enormous man, bald, Paul skin with a red cybernetic jaw and neck, the engraving of a tiger head over his Addams apple, standing around 9ft tall and built for bulk and strength, massive in size and intimidating presence, he wore a clean uniform black tuxedo, black overcoat and collar button shirt underneath, smart black trousers and shining leather shoes, gold caps on both, standing Infront of the door with his hands folded behind his back, his expression unreadable under a pair of dark sunglasses.<br />
&quot;Ummmm, maybe you do the talking on this one, il hold the kid&quot; Antonio chuckled nervously, backing up behind Mantis who rolled her eyes<br />
<br />
&quot;My fucking hero&quot; she sighed, shaking her head before nodding towards the door<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon tough guy&quot;<br />
<br />
The door guard held out a hand to Mantis as she attempted to walk inside<br />
&quot;Sorry mam, only officiall club members or personal business with the boss only&quot; he said, his voice low and gritty, Mantis raised an eyebrow and placed her hand on her hip<br />
&quot;Yeah, why do you think I&#39;m here, your boss owes me a few favours and I&#39;m here to collect, check the name Mantis if you have to&quot; she said in annoyed toan, the guard looking dead ahead for a moment before stepping to the side, holding the door open for them both<br />
&quot;Right this way mam, the boss is expecting you, floor 30, private booth&quot; he said, Mantis just nodded and walked past, Antonio following close on her heels, watching the massive dude as he seemed to eye the girl with a strange and confused look, before closing the doors behind them.<br />
<br />
Antonio&#39;s head was on a swivel as they walked through the lobby, a large round reception desk in the center of the room with a large marble statue of a tiger at it&#39;s heart, a large ring of dark metal above, connecting to the ceiling, rings stepping higher and higher inside.<br />
Three receptionist sat around the circular table none of them paying Antonio or Mantis any mind, too busy with the crowded lobby,vtyping away on small red laptops, people checking in or checking out the room alive with sounds of conversation.<br />
&quot;Hey, don&#39;t let the glamour and dazzle trip you up&quot; Mantis murmured, grabbing Antonios arm in hers as she led the way to the elevator, solid white doors with Japanese styled line art of two cranes bowing to each other, and a red trim around both panels, matching the dim red and yellow carpeting lining the back wall of the elevators, a solid black marble floor dominating the lobby setting.<br />
<br />
Once inside the elevator Mantis reached across to the control panel, swiping up on the screen until a thirty appeared displayed, pressing on their selected floor the doors slid shut and they began their assent.<br />
No sooner than they left the ground floor the girl in Antonios arms sprang to life once more, launching herself out of Antonios grasp with surprising grace, now crouched in the corner of the small box, her hands pressed flat against the walls, Antonio watched as Mantis flexed her Cybernetic arm, her blade springing free from its outer shell, extending and unfolding until it snapped into place along her forearm, her eyes cold and focused as the girl watched her, Antonio looking back and forth between the two of them on a panic before throwing himself in-between them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s all take a breath here ok, it&#39;s been a long day, and I doubt your friends will grant you any favours if you get blood all over their elevator&quot; Antonio said in a panicked rush, trying in any way to bargain with the two bloodthirsty women to hold off on killing eachother, Mantis narrowing her eyes at Antonio for a moment before sighing in defeat, collapsing her blade back into her arm and stepping back into the corner of the elevator with her hands raised to her chest<br />
&quot;Fine, but keep whatever and whoever she is in check, if she fucks this up then we really are completely fucked, because if things don&#39;t go smoothly, then I&#39;m out of ideas&quot; Mantis groaned<br />
&quot;Yeah yeah I got it, I&#39;m make sure she doesn&#39;t flip out&quot; he reassured her, gently taking her hand, squeezing it gently before letting go and crouching down to be eye level with the cybergirl, still pressed tightly against the corner, her breath coming on quick, light, panicked gasps.<br />
Antonio reached a hand out to her, not getting any closer, the girl stared at him with wide eyed confusion before seeming to choppy him, their fingertips touching for a moment before she pulled back to the corner<br />
&quot;Hey, it&#39;s ok, no one&#39;s gonna hurt you here, your safe&quot; he said in a hushed tone, the girl narrowing her eyes slightly before slowly standing up, edging out of her corner before disappearing, reappearing behind Antonio, her arms wrapped around his arm, as she peaked from behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it&#39;s a start&quot; Antonio said with a small chuckle, Mantis couldn&#39;t help but crack a small smile at the small girls behaviour, a warm look slowly filling her eyes, that is until the elevator doors sounded, sliding open into a room filled with purple and pink lighting, fog pooling across the elevator floor as it leaked from the room, the deep base boosted thumps of music reverberating in Antonios chest as he took in the room.<br />
The room was crowded with people all dancing and drinking, in the center of the room was a long curved bar, barstools dotted a long it&#39;s length with drunk and drinking customers dotted a long it, a wall of bottles on the inside, following the curve of the bar, resting above Antonio could see a large oval shaped balcony, metallic railings along one side and a solid wall on the other, three poles seen jutting into the ceiling from its floor.<br />
A bridge lead off from both peaks of the oval, connecting to a balcony that ran all around the room, three or four spiral staircase coming down to the crowded floor, there were seats and booths running allong both sides of the club room, but what really caught Antonio&#39;s attention was the elevated metallic pillars dotted around the open spaces of the club, long poles connected to them, attached to the ceiling, each occupied by women dancing on them, each in a state of undress, following Mantis through the crowd while keeping a tight grip on the cybergirl, Antonio watched as a poldancer hung upside down, using only her thighs to suspend herself on the pole, her large round tits open to the world as she stroked her hands over her naked form, extending her hands above her head before grabbing the pole and flipped through the air, landing on her Cybernetic feet, jutting her ass out to the crowd before straightening back up, wrapping her tits around the pole.<br />
<br />
Antonio instinctively covered the cybergirls eyes as they waded through the club floor, Mantis looking back at Antonio with a wicked grin, leaning into his ear<br />
&quot;Easy there big guy, your drooling all over the place!&quot; she shouted over the music, Antonio checking his mouth before playfully slapping her arm with the back of his hand, she burst into laughter before they made it to the stares.<br />
As they did the ceiling changed, holographic images forming from beams of light, flickering and flashing against the smoke forming into projections of long white curtains of ones and zeros, before shattering and reforming into the siluoete of a naked woman, blowing a kiss to the crowd before disappearing.<br />
<br />
After climbing the busy spiral staircase they finally made it to the main overhanging balcony, the oval,Antonio looked down at the packed club floor before turning his attention to the three private booths before them, each booth a deep red with black leather seating in a cemicircle, all three facing a pole in front, but more specifically Antonio was fixed on the booth that Mantis and himself seemed to be walking towards.<br />
<br />
In the center booth two women were going at it, one laying down on the leather seating and the other laying on top of her, the woman underneath as far as Antonio could see had nothing on around her hips, not even a thong, her cooch and ass open to the world, The woman on top had the naked one locked in a ferocious kiss, legs and arms flailing and deep groans and moans escaping both their lips, the top woman&#39;s hand busy reaching down, her fingers rabidly thrusting in and out between the bottom woman&#39;s legs, the wet dripping slap of every finger thrust getting louder as they got closer until Mantis confidently walked over and tapped them on the shoulders<br />
&quot;Hey Kat, long time no see&quot; she said, watching as the two women got up, the bottom woman hastily grabbing her underwear from the seat and rushing off<br />
&quot;Mantis, you always know how to spoil my fun, no matter what it is&quot; the woman sighed, stretching her arms out accross the back of the booth. <br />
<br />
It was only now that Antonio was able to get a good look at her, Kat&#39;s hair was a strawberry blonde, cut short in a pixie cut, swept longer over one side of her face, with a pair of blue glowing cybernetic eyes, chrome implants under her eyelids, mixed with strips and a mesh of black latex looking material, smooth plump lips and a solid black cybernetic neck, various wiring seen on either side of her neck, neatly encased under a chrome frame, the innards still visible through ventilation gaps in the design, extending down deep into her cleavage.<br />
Her arms and shoulders were completely Cybernetic, Metallic casing and exposed encased wiring and tubing, with multiple sliding mechanics and plates making up her arms, deep red collections of wires uniformed into flat strips extending from her palms up into her elbows, with ventilation slits diagonally cut from her inner wrist to her inner elbow, long slender metallic fingers flexing and tapping against the seat covers.<br />
<br />
She had a narrow waste and large wide hipps, the thigh gap of her hips making her currently covered pussy to be easily visible, only covered by a small set of black latex panties, her plump lips packed tightly into the rubber, she narrowed her eyes at Antonio for a moment before turning her attention back to Mantis.<br />
Mantis chuckled as she casually took a seat<br />
&quot;Well how else am I gonna keep things interesting for you, gotta keep you on your toes bitch&quot; She smirked, Kat smirking back while shaking her head<br />
&quot;Fuck, she was a new girl too, dam, just when it was getting good too, you wound me&quot; Kat said, holding her hands over her heart with a look of shock over her face before bursting into laughter, reaching behind the booth seat and pulling out a bottle of alcohol, popping the seal with her fingertips and taking a strong swig.<br />
<br />
&quot;So my doorman says your here on business, I&#39;m guessing it has something to do with pretty boy over there&quot; she said, nodding over towards Antonio<br />
Mantis sighed, leaning forward in her seat<br />
&quot;Something like that&quot; she murmured, passing on the offer as Kat extended the bottle out to her<br />
&quot;Ok, out with it, you never pass on free drinks&quot; Kat said, a hint of worry in her voice.<br />
Taking a deep breath Mantis looked her friend in the eye<br />
&quot;You know that explosion outside the city, the one that was delivering merchandise for Kovastov?&quot; She started, Kat spitting out her drink with wide eyes, coughing and spluttering as the alcohol burned her throat<br />
&quot;Gagh, holy shit Mantis, that was you?!, what the fuck were you thinking!&quot; Kat&#39;s eyes were wide now, immediately taking another drink, steadying her nerves, but Mantis just let out a sigh<br />
&quot;Hey I&#39;m not that fucking stupid, it......it was Lucy&#39;s idea, brought the whole crew.....now we&#39;re all that&#39;s left&quot; she said in a small defeated tone, Antonio wanted to go over there and help on any way he could, But holding onto the Cybergirl, keeping her from sight at least for now was what was important right now.<br />
&quot;Fucking Lucy, what the fuck was going through your head girl&quot; Kat said, sadness in her eyes as she leaned forward, knocking the bottle between her knees<br />
&quot;But that&#39;s not all....in Kovastov&#39;s truck, we found something, or someone, not really sure&quot; Mantis whispered, looking around to make sure they weren&#39;t being listened in on, Kat looked at her confused before Mantis nodded at Antonio, stepping to the side to reveal the girl behind him, Kat froze, her eyes like a deer in the headlights, her mouth open in shock, her grip on her bottle loosening as it slipped from her grasp, clattering to the ground as it&#39;s contents spilt out onto the floor<br />
&quot;My reaction exactly&quot; Mantis said, patting her friend on the shoulder as she came back from the shock<br />
&quot;You three, back room, now&quot; was all she said before rushing off along the bridge, Antonio and Mantis following close behind, the girl trailing while still grasping Antonio&#39;s arm.</p>
