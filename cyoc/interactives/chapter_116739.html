<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff decided to make him and his father younger until they were both babies. After spending the past ninety minutes watching his dad regress back into a three year old he had become intrigued with becoming younger himself. However rather then be a toddler in training pants Jeff want to take it further and become a baby in diapers again. He had always wonder what it would be like to wear and use them again and figured this was the perfect opportunity to do so.  <br />
<br />
And as for his dad even though he seemed happy enough at his current age Jeff felt he&#39;d like being a baby even more. He&#39;d have no responsibilities whatsoever, heck he wouldn&#39;t even have to wipe his own bottom. Plus he really wanted to see what his father looked like when he was in diapers.<br />
<br />
Looking at the Chronivac he selected his dad&#39;s age and took a little more than a year off his age, making it so he&#39;d become under two years old when the regression finished. Jeff was pretty confident that his father wasn&#39;t potty trained and still in diapers at that point in time. He then selected his own age and changed it to the same and when it asked for &quot;mental change&quot; he clicked no as he wanted to be aware of his time as a baby. It then asked for duration of regression and wanting it to be fast typed in a minute. Jeff also added a minute delay so he&#39;d have enough time to get downstairs before it started. Finally it asked how long the transformation would last and he kept it the same still wanting to spend the week with his dad even though it would now be as babies. It would be the ultimate in father son bonding in his opinion.<br />
<br />
After making sure everything was correct and that reality would change to suit them Jeff clicked on the &quot;execute&quot; button. Wasting no time he quickly rushed back downstairs and re-entered the living room where his father was still sitting on the couch. The toddler was currently watching a little kids show while drinking from his tippi cup and didn&#39;t even notice him enter. Jeff watched as after a minute the regression once again took hold of his dad, the three year old shrinking in height as he become under two. His baby fat became more prominent resulting in pudgy arms and legs. His black hair became shorter but remained a little long. The most obivous of the changes came in his clothes as his blue&#39;s clue t-shirt turned into one sporting cookie monster from sesame street. And his shorts disappeared revealing his training pants puffed up into a pampers disposable diaper. Lastly the tippi cup he was drinking from morphed into a baby bottle which the baby boy happily began to suck on.<br />
<br />
As Jeff was watching this all unfold he was dimly aware of his own regression due to him rapidly losing height. His body quickly shrunk in age and his clothes changed to match every one. However Jeff was paying more attention to the state of his underwear as that was what he wanted to see changed the most. As he reached the single digits he felt his briefs change become more kid friendly and childishly looking. A few seconds later they changed again becoming slightly puffy  turning into training pants. A few more seconds later they puffed up even more becoming a pair of pampers. Looking down at his new padding with a grin Jeff noticed that they had sesame street designs, and looking over at his dad&#39;s revealed he had the same. Also like his father he had a sesame street themed t-shirt except his had big bird on the front.<br />
<br />
Taking a look around the living room Jeff noticed some other changes as there was now a playpen and fully stocked changing table set off to the side of the room. The floor was now covered with scattered baby toys and the staircase was now blocked by a baby gate. Not sure what else to do Jeff decided to hang out with his baby father on the couch and after a few tries managed to climb up. Sitting down next to him Jeff laid back and watched the show as the other continued to drink from his baby bottle. After ten minutes Jeff was beginning to get bored when he heard a piddling sound, like water hitting something. Looking over at his dad he was surprised to see he finished his bottle and was now lying back with his legs spread and showing off his diaper, the front of which had a rapidly growing dark spot. <br />
<br />
Jeff then realized with a start that he was wetting himself! His formerly adult father was actually peeing in his diaper like he had done nothing else his whole life, which thanks to the Chronivac he now believed to be true. To Jeff it was both strange and fascinating to watch.<br />
<br />
His dad continued to pee for a few more seconds before finally stopping, his pampers visibly soaked and sagging. Staring at the soggy diaper Jeff felt overcome with the desire to use his own as well. Focusing on his padding he attempted to go potty in his pants but despite his best effort he couldn&#39;t force himself to go.<br />
<br />
He was just about to stop trying when all of a sudden...</p>
