<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I say we get some payback for what they did to us.” Stated the jaguar woman as she eyed the compartment ahead. Everyone seamed out like a light, judging by the sun it was nearing 5am but everyone in the other compartment had just spend the night before running for their lives and now they believed them to be safe.<br />
“One cut and then they turn.” Stated the wolf man before looking at his wife and three kids, his mate shaking her head. “However, I can’t risk my pack…we need to get off.<br />
“I will not be helpful in there.” Said the hawk man<br />
“Maybe you can.” Countered Lindsay as she pointed to a long line of sample containers and test tubes all packed up. They were labeled by the different animals and there had to be well over a hundred different samples, there where of course multiple samples of the same type but still no one then three of the same. “The paperwork says be careful one drop will transform you. Well that would make it really easy to fly to a nearby town and spread some of that stuff on people rain from above.”<br />
It was hard for this man to grin given he had something a kin to a beak but he did. <br />
“We have a town up a head, care to get off now?” inquired Aaron as the man nodded his head as Barbara loaded one of their backpacks up with samples and handed it to the man. He grabbed multiple bag in his talons and with Constance’s help by owning the door he was out spreading his wings and taking to the air and way ready to spread the infection.<br />
“I better do the same…I will not be useful up there.” Stated the alligator woman “To tight, I am a dozen feet long now.”<br />
“My pack and I will do the same.” Said the female wolf as she took some of the samples along with her husband. “We will head west.”<br />
“I believe there is a couple of nearby lakes all with campgrounds and small cities…I will take them.” Stated the alligator woman as the wolves jumped off, even with the high speed their new naturally harder and tougher skin took the blow with ease and once clear of the train they ran off into the night.<br />
“I’ll wait until you are causing issues up front with my size I it will cause the train to bounce and that will cause people to notice.” Stated Alligator before looking at the Rhino teenager. “Same with you.”<br />
“Very well.” Stated the teenager as he took the one of the bags of samples. <br />
“I can’t risk my daughter, best of luck to you all.” Said Michael as he took another bookbag full of samples to spread and with his daughter in his arms jumped out into the night.<br />
“We will not be much help either.” Said the female kangaroo as she put some samples in her pouch along with her mate and together, they left.<br />
“My mate, father of my clubs is in the next compartment I need to get him.” Stated the bear woman “I am not leaving without him.”<br />
“So how do we want to do this?” inquired the Jaguar women “I say we unleash the animal beasts on them and then we open the doors to the other compartments.”<br />
“Not a bad plan but we need to get her to her mate.” Countered Lindsay “We can’t just unleash the creatures.”<br />
“I say we open the door, you rush to get to her mate.” Said Aaron as he pointed at the bear women before looking at the juargar women. “At the same time, the five of us rush forward. Constance will open the to the next compartment and once in we start showering the people with the samples while we run through down the train until we are done. Jump off and then we all go our separate way as the train turns.”<br />
“We will also unleash the animal ones out the back when you do this.” Stated the Rhino teenager looking at the crates containing the more animal like former humans. <br />
“Lets do this.” said Constance as everyone prepared, they waited until a load bump and then throw open the door to the next compartment. Without missing a beat, the she-bear rushed forward waking everyone up as screams filled the compartment, she ran right to her still human husband who looked horrified to see his wife over him in her new bear form. There was not time to do this the way she wanted so she grabbed him by the face and shoved him face first into her wet bear hood. The liquid began the change almost as once. There was no way to hide a giant 600 pound humanoid bear but that didn’t matter as the lions and the jaguar entered the compartment and began to either splash people with the samples or simple cut them with their claws. <br />
The humans where panicking as they screamed in terror, all of them backing away from the claws even as the liquid landed on skin. That started the changed at once as people started to grow fur, scales, feathers and the like as the virus took hold. Some of the samples had been sexual fluids and as such those souls who did get hit with that started to become intelligent creatures while those who just got hit with blood began to turn into the more animal like nearly mindless creature.<br />
The sounds of screams alerted the next compartment but they where not ready to deal with four lions and a jaguar spraying people with transformation agent, by the time the five of them had reached the 3rd train car the 1st had full transformed and the more animal like creatures where rushing forward toward the sound of humans. Those with intelligence began to either search for loved ones who may or may not have been transformed into the same creature or maybe had been one of the few unturned humans after the cats had passed. They were not lucky anymore. <br />
The made it to the fifth compartment before they ran out of samples, by now almost a quarter of the train was either transformed or being transformed. The sound of the train screeching filled the air as the conductor was alerted to the issue and worse of all for the humans they where passing a refugee center where people who had just escaped the city were being settled. The slowing train made it easier for the humans at the front of the train to get off, but it also made it easier for the infected.<br />
“Lets go my cousins is only an hour or so away.” Said Barbara as the four of them jumped off the train, followed seconds later by the jaguar women. The entire place was chaos as screams filled the air and moments later gunfire as the infected began to spread out over the countryside.<br />
“We did good.” Said Aaron as the five of them reached the wood line to see a bear family now with a papa bear running out the back of the slowing train followed by an alligator woman and a rhino teenager. The rhino charged toward the city infecting everyone he could while the Alligator women headed for a nearby creak. The nearby town was quickly falling and since there was a refugee camp that population of the town had been much larger then normal.<br />
“We sure did.” said the Jaguar as she looked at the four lions. “Mind if I stick with you all for a bit, we are big cats after all and better in numbers, name is Kim.”</p>
