<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While on one side of the forest, Avery was getting his new deer ass filled with load after load of cum and piss, turning the refreshing air of the woods into a thick musk, not more than a few miles away, another teenager was about to discover “The OneWithNatureChallenge” too.<br />
<br />
In the suburbs of the neighbouring town, a red-haired teenager was having a talk with a man in his forties, as a pair of eight-year-old blonde twins were playing tag on the front lawn. The teenager was leaning against the frame of the open front door, offering the man a tired smile, which he returned with a brighter one as he rummaged through his wallet. “Thank you so much for having taken care of them on such short notice, Hilbert.” With those words, the golden-haired man pulled out two twenty-dollar bills, before pausing and instead offering him a fifty-dialler bill instead. “For your extra troubles”, his blue eyes flickered to Hilbert’s left wrist, which was wrapped tightly in white gauze. “I know the boys can be a handful on a good day, son.”<br />
<br />
“They weren’t any trouble at all, Mr Frost. Jim and Tim were well-behaving today.” His answer got a chuckle from the man, who clearly did not believe him. Their parents always acted like they were the worst troublemakers, but he never had any problems with them. Though maybe he was just good with kids. He was the oldest kid in the neighbourhood and had been playing babysitter ever since he was old enough to be considered responsible. It was a nice gig if he was honest, play with the kids a bit and make sure they got their homework done, in return he never had to worry about allowance.<br />
<br />
Taking the money with another smile, Hilbert pocketed it before offering the boys a lazy wave. “Bye guys, see you again soon!” Shouting loud enough to get their attention, he had to hold back a chuckle as only Tim stopped, resulting in Jim running into him and sending them both tumble to the floor. “Bye Hilbert, hope you get better soon!” They called back in their somewhat-creepy twin synchronicity, before they laughed again and jumped to their feet to run again, now seemingly having decided that their father was it now. The man next to him let out a sigh, before putting his wallet away and walking after them. “Goodbye Hilbert.” “Bye Mr Frost.” He watched the widower walk after his kids and only made his way back inside once they had vanished around the corner. Once the door fell shut behind himself, he let out a hiss and rubbed his aching wrist. It had been a soccer incident and the doctor told him to not move it too much. Originally, he just wanted to have a lazy day, but Mr Frost had been called to work and Hilbert just had felt too bad about leaving the boys on their own all morning. Plus, the extra fifty were a nice down payment for his next pair of soccer shoes.<br />
<br />
With a small sigh on his lips, he crossed the hallway until he reached his room’s door. Stepping into his room, he was met with the familiar “stench”, as his mother liked to call it, of his own sweat and musk. Like most teenage boys, Hilbert enjoyed a certain level of messy when it came to his own room, making it the only place he did not allow anyone else inside. His dirty soccer uniform was carelessly dropped near the down to his private bathroom, the usually bright red outfit was caked with mud and stunk of the sweat of their last training session. Next to it stood his full hamper, the last garment on top of the pile being his Pyjama, just freshly discarded this morning after a wet dream caused him to mess up his pants. Carefully stepping over a discarded soccer ball and his dumbbell, Hilbert reached for his nightstand and checked his charging phone. No missed calls and much to his satisfaction, it was fully charged.<br />
<br />
Knowing he had nothing else planned for his day, Hilbert fumbled around with the charger a little, trying to disconnect it with one hand was annoyingly hard. Once it finally came loose, he stuffed his smartphone into his pocket, followed by him putting his AirPods in. Finally, he grabbed a fluffy green towel from the floor. Giving it a sniff and finding the smell not strong enough to require a wash, the teenager threw it over his shoulder and returned to the hallway. Making his way to the kitchen, he looked around for snacks, but all he could find was a plastic container of grapes. Deciding they were better than nothing, the boy entered their backyard.<br />
<br />
The afternoon sun was hot and not a single cloud was in sight, leaving the grass on their property a faded green that would turn into yellow before too long. Neither of his parents really cared for gardening anyway, the large space behind their house was mostly used by him to entertain his babysitting kids or for him to work out. A large wooden fence shielded them from nosy neighbours on two sides and the forest on one side. It was old and, like the rest of the garden, badly maintained, leaving gaps where one could squeeze themselves through and into the wilderness, if one so desired. Alas, he was not hear to think about that though. Instead, he placed the grape container on the small table they had out here, before pulling the plastic garden lounger into the sunlight and covered it with the towel, then let himself sink into it. Putting up his legs and leaning back, he let out a sigh and plopped a grape into his mouth, then plucked his phone from his pocket and connected it to his AirPods.<br />
<br />
Finally, some peace.<br />
<br />
As per usual, he started his search on YouTube, but before too long, he found his way to TikTok. He wasn’t big on social media, but he kept up with it to not feel too old when the kids talked about it. Plus, he had found it to be quite the nice place to get his mind going. Loud dance music filled his ears as he watched some guys follow the latest dance trend, shaking their asses into the camera as if they were bitches in heat. A small moan escapes his lips as his cock throbbed and hardened slightly in his shorts, bulging them outwards more noticeably. Did they not realise how they were looking? Or where they getting off on it maybe? Sadly, the way they positioned their camera made it hard to tell. Not wasting too much time on thinking, he instead went straight to the next video and then another and another.<br />
<br />
Not too long after, he found himself bored of idly fondling his bulge and watching random guys act like sluts. It was fun, but he really did not feel like jerking off at the moment. Surely there had to be something else that is fun on this website?<br />
<br />
Returning to the home screen, Hilbert was about to turn off the app as his eyes spotted a cat video and it brought something that the twins had mentioned earlier back to mind. He did not remember it fully, they liked to ramble quite a bit, but it was something about people doing “naughty” things with animals and film it. What had they said it was called? Something with nature… he quickly typed it in and thankfully autocomplete was on his side today. “OneWithNatureChallenge? Interesting name”, chuckled Hilbert as he played the first one about a girl trying to share a sausage with her dog and ending up kissing it. The shocked look on her face was enough to make him chuckle, especially how she was scrambling to turn off the recording afterwards. This was entertainment he could get behind, even if “naughty” was a bit much, but then again, the boys were eight, probably heard their father call it that.<br />
<br />
As he reached for another grape, his green eyes widened as he noticed something moving at their fence. A small ball of red fluff had squeezed its way through the gap and into their garden, a fox kit. Hilbert held his breath, it was not that unusually for foxes to break into gardens around here, but he had never seen a kit doing it. The little animal was so cute as it sat there, those ears and its bushy tail looked so massive on its tiny frame. It let out a tiny yip, which nearly melted Hilbert’s heart. What finally got the teenager to let out a real “aww” was when the next ball of fur squeezed through the fence, seemingly following the call of the first one. Ball after ball of red, black and white slipped through the fence, before the skulk was complete at seven little kits. He had expected an adult to slip through too, but it appeared like they were alone.<br />
<br />
With bated breath, he raised his phone and snapped a picture, before the kits ran away. The second the picture was taken; the foxes snapped their heads towards him and froze. Instead of running away however, the one that had arrived first let out another yip, then trotted over towards him, followed closely by the others. “It could be cool to have the kids find my video while browsing TikTok”, thought Hilbert to himself as he quickly hit record and aimed his camera at the approaching skulk. As if the foxes had understood what he was doing, the moment they were being filmed, they became more animated. Bouncing and jumping each other cutely, they let out cute yips and other noises. Only the one in the front remained true to its path, but even it seemed to walk with more of a swagger, making its long tail twitch behind it.<br />
<br />
“Hey there”, greeted Hilbert the “leader” as the small kit arrived at his lounger. It greeted him back with another yip, before wriggling with its behind and then jumped up. Landing between the human’s spread legs, the little fox tumbled and came to a stop on its back. Or well… judging by the pouch the fox spotted, it was a he. The human had no idea why his eyes fixated on those tiny fluffy orbs, or why he made sure the camera got a good shot of them, not to mention including his still swollen bulge in the angle. Unperturbed by the attention he was getting, the small fox meanwhile wriggled around on his back, clearly enjoying the softness of the towel. The fact that he was sniffing the human musk coming from it was completely lost on the teenager.<br />
<br />
Something about the tiny and thin kit made a strange feeling of protectiveness blossom up inside Hilbert and before he knew what he was doing, he reached over to the grapes. Propping his phone against it, making sure the camera continued to be on his lounger, he then grabbed a few grapes.<br />
<br />
“Are you hungry, little guy?” He asked in a soft voice, before bringing a grape down to the kit. In two quick bites, it had vanished down the fox’s maw and the kit stretched and rolled over. Now properly sitting down, it looked at his hand with large green eyes and licked his muzzle free of spilled juices. “Someone is eager”, chuckled Hilbert and offered the next one. Eager apparently had been taking it mildly, as soon as the berry had come close to its muzzle, the fox opened it wide and jumped forward.<br />
<br />
Not only did the berry vanish into its maw, but also the tips of Hilbert’s index finger and thumb. With a loud gulp, the fox swallowed the berry whole and thanks to his position, the teenager had a front-row seat on the bulging throat as it travelled downwards. The wet and hot tongue of the fox eagerly licked his fingers clean of anything that resembled grape flavour and no matter how much he tried, he only managed to pry his thumb free. Once only one finger remained in its grasp, the kit went from licking to suckling. The teenager was so distracted by the cute sight and the small sparks of pleasure that ran through him, that he completely missed how his nail turned black and sharpened, as the fox drool sunk into it.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the six other foxes had taken note of their brother’s actions and took position beneath the lounger. Hidden from view by the towel that closed the gaps in the plastic chair, the foxes raised their hind legs, revealing not only fuzzy balls but also hard cocks that pulsed in the air. In near-perfect synchronicity, the foxes began to empty their bladders over the corners of the towel that hung low enough to touch the floor. A harsh acidic smell filled the air, before it turned into a more biting version of Hilbert’s musk, as it got soaked into the sweaty towel.<br />
<br />
The smell bit the human in the nose, resulting in him letting out a cute sneeze that made his nose twitch. Not able to use his good hand, since it was still being cleaned by the kit, he used the sleeve of his other arm, which unknowingly had been in contact with the mix of piss and sweat. Rubbing it over his face, smearing the mixture into his smooth skin, he could not help but sneeze again. This time it shook his body so much that it forced the kit to fall over and let go of his finger. “Sorry, little guy”, he sneezed again and as he brought his good hand up to clean the tears from his face, he found himself frozen in confusion.<br />
<br />
His index finger was swollen and fuzzy. The nail a pitch black and looked like it had never been cut in his life, while on the other side, a strange leathery pad had begun to form. “I must have fallen asleep”, muttered Hilbert to himself, as he took a few breaths to calm himself down. Each deep inhale made the burning smell of piss seem less bad and before to long, dare he say it was pleasant. His nose twitched and turned black, as his face slowly pushed forward, but he was too busy turning his hand around to look at it from every angle. In doing so, he had accidentally let go of the remaining three grapes he had held earlier, causing them to land in his lap.<br />
<br />
Not wasting any time, the fox on the towel went to work. Gobbling up the two grapes that had landed on the left and right of his throbbing bulge, the animal soon fixated on the one that was stuck between the bulge and his waistband at the top. Planting both of his front paws on the thin material, it sank its claws into it and ripped right through, allowing the moist purple briefs that were hiding underneath to see the sunlight. A second time, he placed his paws on the bulge, then pushed himself against it to gain enough height to get the grape. Biting into it, the fox made its juices spill all over the bulge, before swallowing it down and went straight to licking the sweaty material.<br />
<br />
A deep rumbling moan ran through Hilbert and as he opened his mouth to vocalise it, his teeth sharpened and adapted to the short muzzle his face had turned into. Looking down at his crotch, he got bombarded by a storm of thoughts and emotions. The human side of him knew it was wrong, this was a wild animal after all, not to mention he was still filming. That part was telling him to put the fox down, delete the video and take a long shower. However, there was a second voice and it was getting louder and more convincing with each hot and slimy lick of the fox. Why was this wrong? He had done something nice for the fox by letting him into his garden and feeding him. So, of course it was only natural that the fox would do something nice back to him. Just how he was doing something nice for his young friends by going along with this TikTok thing and maybe they would do something nice back too.<br />
<br />
The second voice finally drowned out the first one, as the fox started to thrust against his bulge, before a second later, Hilbert felt something hot and sticky spill against his balls. He was being pissed at! Anger grew in his stomach, before it got quelled by a new thought butting in. No, the fox was marking him as a friend. Warmth filled his stomach as the thought took over his mind. He should do something nice back. Blindly reaching out, he grabbed the entire grapevine this time and pulled it out of the box. Just as he was about to put it down, the kit in his lap dug his teeth and claws into his bulge and ripped through his briefs, his wet cock rose up to its full height and slapped against his stomach. The surge of pleasure made him drop the grapes, making them fall down to his crotch. They landed right on his piss-soaked balls, the formerly smooth and rather small orbs had swollen to the size of ripe peaches at this point, with the red and white fur to match the fruit’s fuzz and so far, they showed little signs of stopping. “Ooops”, he managed to get past his black lips as his ears wandered up his head, before they got stretched into two large and beautiful fox ears, though their fur were moist with his musky sweat. He wasn’t given a chance to pick up the vine however, as the moment the human had finished speaking, the remaining six foxes jumped onto the lounger and covered his form.<br />
<br />
The fox-headed teenager erupted into loud laughter, as the fuzzy shapes ran over his body, tickling him with their large bushy tails. He twitched and moved around in his chair, rubbing himself more and more into his soaked towel, trying fruitlessly to get the foxes off without using his weak hand. Whenever he managed to pluck one away though, it jumped just straight back into the pile. Soon their tails got joined by their tongues, as licking accompanied the tickling. At first it was just on his legs as they shredded through the remains of his shorts, but then they moved up to his chest. Cutting through his shirt, they soon bathed his front in their thick slobber. As he leaned back to catch a breath, one of the foxes found its way to his face and licked him right across his twitching, black nose.<br />
<br />
It was like a spell had been broken and for a moment, Hilbert realised how fucked up and worrisome the situation was. He had to get out of here and find out what was going on! He had to call someone… a doctor or someone like that.<br />
<br />
Pushing himself up with all his might, he managed to threw off the foxes and take a single step, only to slip on the end of his towel and fall forwards. Out of instinct, he caught himself with both hands and let out a loud moan of pain, as his left hand ached. He tried to crawl away, but one commanding yip of their leader later and Hilbert found his arms and legs occupied and held in place by the surprisingly strong foxes. In front of him sat the little leader, having a smug look on his tiny face as he yipped again. Hilbert tried to say something, anything to make them stop, but the moment he opened his muzzle, the small fox in front of him jumped at him. Placing his paws on top of his head and biting a strand of his read hair for hold, the tiny kit thrusted his small cock into his mouth. Out of instinct, Hilbert wrapped his tongue around the small fox, savouring the lingering piss flavour of the slowly growing cock. At the same time, one of the foxes holding him down had left his post.<br />
<br />
Following his nose to the quivering pucker of the human, which was covered only by what little remained of his clothes. Having found his target, the fox licked his muzzle, then pushed on. The half-human-half-fox’s eyes opened wide as he felt the muzzle push first against and then into his ass. Each little hair of fur tickled his insides, as the fox pushed himself inside. He could feel his body stretching to allow the intruder in; it was a mixture of hellish pain and heavenly pleasure. His cock pulsed and throbbed, sending watery globs of human pre raining to the floor, as his meat began to stretch and shift shape. As the tail of the fox vanished into his hole, leaving the small one fully inside of him, Hilbert let out a pained groan, before it turned into a pleased moan as a heavenly acidic taste filled his mouth, seemingly melting the pain away. The small fox inside of him felt like a stone in his stomach, but he could not really focus too much on it, as he already felt the next one push against his hole.<br />
<br />
Number two slipped in with slightly less resistance and ass the hole relaxed behind the fox, a fine coat of black fur had grown around it. It quickly spread outwards to claim his entire ass, once number three left his hole slightly loose. Number four pushed the fur down his thighs and up his back, where a small nub of a tail was painfully pushing its way out of his skin. The fifth one costed Hilbert his legs, instead they were replaced by large fluffy paws, as more nipples formed on his fit stomach. As the sixth and final one pushed into him, Hilbert let out a loud moan and spat out the kit in his maw. He could feel all six of them wriggling around inside of him, before they seemingly melted into his body, filling him up with pure vulpine essence from the inside.<br />
<br />
The young fox landed on the ground, before it was blasted in the face with cum from a fat and throbbing new vulpine cock that the former human called his own. First came a watery load of human sperm, then followed a strange mix of both, before load after load of thick and creamy fox batter covered the kit from head to toe. Each pump of his large cantaloupes pushed more of his humanity out of him and his mind, before all that was left of Hilbert was a stylish mess of fur on his head and the gauze that was wrapped around his front paw. The large fox was about to pass out, his head was a little more than a foggy mess as his new brain was processing and twisting his old thoughts and emotions. Then, he heard the small yip of his companion and he managed to catch himself. Of course, he could not sleep yet, he had to get out of here before the humans came back. Foxes did not have it easy in this area, he was the only one that offered them any protection. Looking down at his messy ward, he picked him up by the scruff of his neck, before making his way over to the fence. Without a look back, he jumped over the fence, his new mission being finding a place to keep the young one save, before looking for other lost kids.<br />

Back in the garden, the limit for video size had been reached and a video was auto-uploaded to TikTok.</p>
