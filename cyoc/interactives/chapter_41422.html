<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">His mom stood at the door and peered in at the sleeping form of what once was her son. Cathy, as she was slowly becoming accustomed to addressing him as, was sleeping heavily in a pair of footed pajamas that where purple, teal and white. Cuddled tightly against him was the plush doll that had at one time been Kat.<br />
<br />
Inside her mind, she could hear her former daughter begging and pleading to be changed back, to be given a second chance, but her mother ignored her. She was waiting for Cathy to finish transforming before she did anything with Kat.<br />
<br />
And so far, Cathy's transformation was turning out to be interesting. She'd come home earlier today, distressed and agitated over something and if it hadn't been for Kat's attempted spell, their mom would have rushed to the upset child and comforted him, who was slowly becoming a her, but the changes clearly weren't stopping there.<br />
<br />
Cathy had left that morning, with white fur for hair and when she had come home, her ears where now on top her head, covered in the same white fur, small and slightly rounded, giving the look that they might have belonged on a mouse.<br />
<br />
Unable to comfort the child, the mom had done nothing and watched as Cathy slowly headed for her room. And then an idea on how to get around Kat's spell and possibly make her new daughter happy. If not that, then to soothe her a bit. And with that thought in mind, she went about her usual routine, all the while she prepared a spell for Cathy.<br />
<br />
At dinner, mom noticed that Cathy had shrunk and was clearly shorter then when she came home, &quot;By at least six inched,&quot; she thought to herself as her husband and &quot;new&quot; daughter dished up for themselves. Clutched tightly was the doll that had once been Kat, who was still begging and pleading to be changed back and that she was really sorry and she wouldn't do it ever again.<br />
<br />
Liking the way that Cathy had taken to the doll, thinking, &quot;Well at least she's happy when she has the plush,&quot; mom also noted that Cathy had taken the clothes off of it and put a different set on.<br />
<br />
It was only later, after helping Cathy with her bath and then tucking her in, that mom had noticed that her daughters left hand had changed and though it still had five fingers and a thumb, it was smaller, more feminine, while her other hand was undergoing the same transformation. Seeing how distressed Cathy was made her want to weep, but instead she kissed her daughter goodnight, made sure she had her doll and then after tucking her in completely, she turned off the lights and slowly exited the room.<br />
<br />
Now, it was about two hours later and she watched Cathy sleep, the moonlight shining across the face of a boy who was deeply troubled by something. Whispering silently, she began to chant out her spell.<br />
<br />
As she did so, she stepped closer and began to sprinkle something across the sleeping form of her childe, hoping that this would help. After a bit, she stopped and looked at Cathy. The troubled look had disappeared and had been replaced by one of contentment. Satisfied that the spell of soothing had worked, her mom quietly stole out of the room, glad that for a moment Kat had shut up, and whispered as she left, &quot;Pleasant dreams, Cathy.&quot;<br />
<br />
On the bed, Cathy slept on, unaware that she was no longer thinking of herself as Dan and no longer troubled by her strange transformation. Her dreams had shifted to something more pleasant and while she dreamed, the transformation continued and between her legs, the male penis and testicles began to shrink. Gently they folded up closer and closer to the her body, until they simply merged with the skin and then disappeared.<br />
<br />
Shortly after that, the second part of this transformation began. Slowly the are area between her legs took on a bright pink look and then suddenly split. The lips majour and minour formed, while a two holes formed, one over the other; the one closest to the front of her body being the urethra and the one closet to the back of her body being her vagina opening. As this happened, a small button like nub appeared in front of the urethra and as her clitoris formed and the clitoris hood formed over it, her ovaries took their normal place and slowly began to grow outward.<br />
<br />
By morning, the transformation between her legs would be finished and she would have have both the interior and exterior parts that made up the female's body between her legs. But for now, Cathy slept on, unaware of it all.</p>
