<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a slow day at the furniture store where Chuck worked. He had done all the things that he was supposed to do for opening to the public with his coworkers. But after a few hours passed since he unlocked the doors, nobody came in. So, with nothing better to do to pass the time, he got on his computer and logged on to his favorite site.<br />
Unnoticed by his poor attempt to see if the coast was clear, someone came up behind him. She stealthily approached him while he plugged in his password and got on to the site proper.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing?” Chuck jumped out of his seat when his coworker snuck up behind him and scared him with the question. He pressed the minimized button on his computer to prevent her from looking at what he was looking at. But he was too slow and was caught in the act.<br />
She reached across and pressed the button again, bringing up the tap that he was looking at. “What is with these ladies? Why are they so muscular and buff?” She looked back at Chuck who was mentally praying to anyone who would listen to spare him of the embarrassment.<br />
<br />
“Chuck. Why are there naked, overly muscular women on your computer?” She asked with a smile as her arms crossed underneath her ample bosom. She knows about Chuck’s taste in women and she decided to rub it in. Chuck stammered out a poor reply, saying that it was for his art class or his “research”. There were other things that he said but she didn&#39;t believe a single word of it.<br />
“Oh come on, Chuck! Stop lying and tell me the truth,” his coworker said, edging him on since there was nothing to do in the store. Chuck sighed, now knowing that there is no god to save his sorry soul, and said, “I was bored and I wanted to see my favorite type of woman.”<br />
<br />
His coworker scrolled down the site, seeing more ladies in various art styles and photo morphs. Big or small, 2D or 3D, all the women had muscles. From the littlest which made her look like she worked out to the biggest which made bodybuilders look tiny in comparison. Chuck’s coworker said nothing while she scrolled, which made Chuck feel even more nervous than before.<br />
After scrolling for a while, she clicked the minimized button and then turned to face the poor man. “Listen, Charles,” she said gently to Chuck with her hand on his shoulder, “I get it. You’re bored and you decided to look at porn to pass the time.” “It’s not porn! It’s-“ “Don’t interrupt me, Chuck! I’m trying to save you.”<br />
<br />
Chuck shut his lips with a complaint still on his tongue. His coworker continues as if the interruption had never happened. <br />
<br />
“So you look up some “research materials” while there are no shoppers in the store. But what if the managers see you with your eyes glued on the screen? Or worse, the regional directors come around without notice for a surprise inspection.” Chuck looked back at the computer, staring longingly at the icon at the bottom of the screen. “And could I just say that I find it a little too hard to believe that a woman like this exists? I mean, it&#39;s not like a woman like that is going to walk through the door and ask for assistance.” That is when a woman like they were talking about came in.<br />
They didn’t see her first. Instead, they heard her heavy footsteps approaching the door. Each step that hits the concrete outside sends a few of the smaller, loose items that they have to fall on the ground. By the time the hulking figure had made it to the door, the two workers could only see a silhouette of what was causing the minor earthquake.<br />
<br />
They could tell that whatever standing behind the door was a woman, albeit a giant one at that. They could see the slight curvature of her bosom and her semi-thin waist that led to her womanly hips. But those features were the only way to tell if she was a woman given the fact that there were a lot more muscles than curves. The figure stood there while a much smaller woman came up and when she did, she opened the door for the muscled goddess.<br />
And to Chuck, it was a goddess that stepped through the doorway. He could tell from the doorway that she stood over 7 feet tall seeing how she had to bend just to get inside. While she wore a simple top and skirt, they were barely holding onto her immense figure. There was not one ounce of fat on her that Chuck could see as she made her way into the store, with the exception of her pec-like breasts and her gluteus maximus. No, she was making her way to the assistance desk, on her way to him!<br />
<br />
As the woman who looked like she had stepped foot out of the site that he was on approached, Chuck could feel his heart beating out of his chest. With her shirt unable to go further down her overtly muscular body, Chuck could see and count the packs that she had. “...6, 8,10,12!” Chuck whispered to himself in awe as his eyes grew wide. He must’ve stared too long at her because a very defined hand that was laced with veins had waved in front of his face. A hand that was bigger than his face.<br />
“Huh, what?” Chuck asked in confusion before he snapped back to being a professional, craning his neck up to see the woman that he was just ogling at. “I’m sorry about that. I don’t normal-normally…,” was all he said before the sentence dried up in his throat when he saw her face for the first time.<br />
<br />
Hidden in the middle of all of her muscles that made up her neck and upper shoulders, was the face that belonged with this body. Unlike the rest of her unbelievable body, her head hadn’t changed much. Sure it was a cute face, but it didn&#39;t fit with her body. Like someone photoshopped a regular girl’s face and placed it on a body that can only be found online. Still, a cute face and a killer body are more than he bargained for.<br />
The woman of his dream deeply giggled at his reaction. “Yes I know, I’m a whole lot of woman. Say, do you have anyone that can help me with-” Was all she said before Chuck raised his hand and announced like he was still in school. “I-I can help you ma’am! I’m Chuck and it is a pleasure to beat- I mean meet you. Say uh, what is your name if you don’t mind me asking?” The goddess among women giggled deeply once more in her bass-like voice. “I don’t mind. It’s Charlotte.”<br />
<br />
Chuck mouthed the word “Charlotte” repeatedly, relishing the way that it may sound to his ears. The woman who came with his patron stepped in front of him and said, “And my name is Nancy. Now, can you help us out?” Chuck snapped out of the trance that he put himself in and said, “Yes. Yes! Of course. What are you looking for so that I can help you find it?”<br />
The ruler of all things buff, Charlotte, raised her muscular arm which is thicker than his whole body, and tried to do the motion of someone trying to rub the back of their head. But due to all the muscle mass between her hand and her head, she looked like she was stretching her arm up.<br />
<br />
“Well, it&#39;s just that I… I mean, I accidentally…,” Charlotte stammered her reasoning but couldn’t form a coherent sentence. Nancy rolled her eyes and said, “We are looking for a bed frame. Something that can support her in the middle of the night.” She leaned closer to Chuck and whispered, “The old one broke under her. Right in the middle of the action too.” She smiled with a wink as she moved away, sending Chuck&#39;s imagination into overdrive.<br />
“W-well, well there are a bunch of options to fuck on- I mean, choose on. But given your substantial size, I would recommend our biggest breasts and ass- I mean, mattress and frame to go with it,” Chuck said with some Freudian slipping in as he led his dream girl and her friend deeper inside the store.<br />
<br />
As Chuck walked ahead of the two ladies, he had to keep his thoughts in check. “I don’t want to scare her off,” he thought as he made his way to the bedroom department of the store. “Maybe if I impress her enough, I might be able to score a date with her. But I have to do it when her little friend isn’t with us, or else she will ruin it somehow.” But before he had thought of the means to get rid of that woman, he had finally made it to what he was leading them to.<br />
“You may have seen some queen-size breasts and king-size breasts- I mean queen-size beds and king-size beds, but I bet that you have never seen an Alaskan king-size bed before. Over 9 feet across both ways so that even you can fuck inside- I mean, fit inside. Go ahead and fuck it- I mean lay on it if you wanted to.”<br />
<br />
After a few more slips sprinkled in his spiel, the idol that had graced his workplace slowly approached the offered bed. Going as slowly as possible in order to avoid breaking another bed, Charlotte managed to lie down on the plastic-covered mattress. She closed her eyes as she settled into the middle of the oversized bed that was made for a small family. Knowing that it would be improper to lie down next to the angel on the store’s bed, Chuck just stood where he was and tried to not get a boner.<br />
The woman who never left his prima donna sides approached him and said, “We’ll take it. Do we pay here or at the front?” The news that his reason for being would be leaving him soon snapped him out of his amusement of watching muscular women. “Oh, uh you can go up to the front and you can-” “I can help you out over here ma’am. And miss, can you get off the mattress please.”<br />
<br />
Just as Chuck was about to get rid of the one obstacle between him and his goal, his coworker from before came up yet again and ruined everything. She not only led the two ladies to the department desk to do the transaction, but she also forced the beauty that is Charlotte to get off the bed. So, not wanting to say goodbye too soon, Chuck approached once again to see if he had a chance.<br />
“... And that is it. You are now the new owner of an Alaskan king bed frame and mattress. Do you need help loading it into your vehicle?” Charlotte, the charmer that she is, shook her head no and said, “No thanks, I got it.” As she made her way back to the bed that she had paid for, the icon of his wildest dreams walked past him and said in passing, “Bye Chuck, and thank you for the bed.”<br />
<br />
Stunned that she had brushed him aside like that, Chuck turned around to say what was on his mind but stopped himself when he saw what happened next. Charlotte grabbed the bed frame that she just bought and raised it effortlessly. Over 800 pounds of both the frame and the mattress and she lifted it up like it was nothing. Chuck begins to realize that he won’t be able to get the girl as she makes her way back outside. Still standing with the winds in his sails gone, the other woman came up to him and said in passing, “Don’t be too hard on yourself. And even if you had a chance, she still would’ve chosen me.” Chuck fainted when he heard what Nancy said, much to the delight between the two women when she also made it outside with her girlfriend.</p>
