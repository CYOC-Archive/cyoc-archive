<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenny&#39;s morning was relatively quiet, though some of the debates over what had happened at the City Council meeting the previous Friday were there and were an issue. Even through her first period class there was some of that going on when she and Harry arrived. A few people looked to her, but she and Harry both managed to stay out of those discussions and Jenny considered herself lucky in that. She really didn&#39;t have any way of knowing how well it would go and didn&#39;t see herself in a position to provide answers there. She could even see a look of frustration on Professor Anderson&#39;s face as he had to stop a few of those debates going on in the background before he could even get his class going for the day. And even through the class, there was something that told Jenny that things weren&#39;t going to be super calm, at least not for awhile.<br />
<br />
After the class ended, Harry and Jenny made their way out and into the hallway. It was at this point where they would have to go to different areas, but they did pause together to give each other a small hug and Harry kissed Jenny&#39;s cheek before walking on together.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re sure you&#39;ll be okay?&quot; Harry asked to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Jenny commented, &quot;I don&#39;t plan on going anywhere or starting any fights... besides my business for the day has more to do with John than anything else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;His nightmares?&quot; Harry asked as a couple students walked by them, though one female glared at both of them as she walked by.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think he had one last night...&quot; Jenny said softly, remembering being woken up two nights before by a scream from the guest room where John and Janice were staying and then hearing Janice comfort John when she and Harry almost collided with Harry&#39;s parents in the hallway, &quot;but the fact that they might come from things my father did...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I remember that was a big part of things as we came up on our wedding,&quot; Harry commented, &quot;you&#39;d seemed to recover from everything that related to Yvette Smith but there were issues with at least your father... if not with both parents.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny nodded as they walked along the sidewalk toward the main Commons Building. For the moment she had an open hour and so did Harry, which had been helpful when she&#39;d still had her sessions with Frances Twist concerning her mental health after having her transformation be incomplete for as long as it was. Right now, it would serve to let them check their mail perhaps get mug of coffee in the cafeteria if they wanted one. There were a few whispers here and there as they walked, but from what Jenny could hear, it was mostly on the reveal.<br />
<br />
&quot;And dad was hard on all of us, not just me,&quot; Jenny spoke, &quot;but... between some things I had while I was getting over being incomplete for as long as I was... and then with some of the other stuff that&#39;s gone on since we got custody for John and Janice... I&#39;m getting the sensation that whatever issues that John might be wrestling with regarding WHO he is would have also left some scars on him. And since Frances helped me... she can help John. And he might honestly need it, at least to gain the confidence in himself that he doesn&#39;t need to worry about dad and that dad isn&#39;t the one who determines who John is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I agree with you there,&quot; Harry answered as they walked into the Commons building, with Harry holding the door open for his bonded mate.<br />
<br />
The two walked in and did a quick walk past the mail boxes that ran along the wall. Jenny found nothing in hers, though that wasn&#39;t too surprising, as most of what she got in the mail was often promotional things from the college, which had largely been limited to things for Halloween. Things for Thanksgiving wouldn&#39;t be too far behind, though none had arrived. As Harry collected his mail, which appeared to have a couple of notes which he stuffed into his own backpack, he then rejoined Jenny and they walked into a small lounge area that was opposite the row of mail boxes. There were a couple of people there, but things were for the most part quiet, and that let Jenny and Harry sit down in a pair of easy chairs in the corner. Jenny collected her cellphone from her backpack and was soon dialing a number as she sat down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Moon Lake Psychotherapy,&quot; came Rudy&#39;s voice at the other end of the line, &quot;how may I handle your call?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um... is Doctor Twist in?&quot; Jenny asked, a bit puzzled as to who she was speaking to. She thought she recognized the voice but she wasn&#39;t sure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doctor Twist is in today, do you have an appointment?&quot; Rudy asked in reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t... but I would want to schedule one for my younger brother, may I talk with Doctor Twist?&quot; Jenny inquired.<br />
<br />
&quot;If it&#39;s scheduling, I handle a lot of that, ma&#39;am,&quot; Rudy answered, &quot;I handle a lot of Doctor Twist&#39;s schedule, though I can&#39;t say who she sees and for what... confidentiality and all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do I need to say for what or why?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That could be part of it,&quot; Rudy answered, &quot;but it wouldn&#39;t be the thing I start with. Can I get your name, Miss?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenny, Jenny Harper-Jenkins,&quot; Jenny answered, &quot;but the appointment would actually be for my younger brother, John. I might come with him as his present legal guardian, but nothing beyond that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenny... Jenny,&quot; Rudy was heard to muse, &quot;You were the one that saw Doctor Twist because of the rogue! How are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m doing well,&quot; Jenny answered, noting the friendly tone that Rudy had, &quot;but I would like to schedule an appointment for my brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... hold on, let me pull up the calendar and see what Doctor Twist has available,&quot; Rudy answered.<br />
<br />
Jenny waited as she heard a few clicks on the keyboard come in over the line. After a moment or two, Rudy spoke up again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, she has an opening tomorrow at 1:30 PM, would that work for you?&quot; Rudy asked.<br />
<br />
Jenny cringed as that would interfere with at least one of her afternoon classes, but she felt she could get out of that class if need be and then schedule any follow on appointments so that either she would be free or Harry&#39;s parents could handle taking John to and from the clinic.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;ll be fine, at least for the first one if need be,&quot; Jenny said softly, and made a mental note to talk with the professor for that Tuesday afternoon class for the next day that she&#39;d miss part of the class for the appointment.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what would be the reasoning for this appointment, Mrs. Jenkins?&quot; Rudy asked, &quot;and this doesn&#39;t need to be in detail. Just something I can give to Doctor Twist.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At least just a check in regarding things that may have happened as a result of the way his father raised him,&quot; Jenny answered, &quot;forced him to repress something or hurt him in some other way. That sort of thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I&#39;ll let Doctor Twist know, thank you for calling and see you tomorrow,&quot; Rudy answered.<br />
<br />
With that the call ended and Jenny looked to Harry with some hope that she&#39;d made the right decision.</p>
