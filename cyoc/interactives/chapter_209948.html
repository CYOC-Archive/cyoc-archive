<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Can we please stop so I can use a restroom?&quot; Leah pleaded from her booster seat in the back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry honey,&quot; Tina replied, &quot;We stayed a little too late, there&#39;s no one around here with an open restroom. You&#39;ll have to hold it until we get home. Or you can just use your pullup if you&#39;re careful. You know it can&#39;t take too much.&quot;<br />
<br />
Leah fidgeted in her seat. She shouldn&#39;t have drunk all that tea. She tried to take her mind off her complaining bladder, but her personal game of I Spy didn&#39;t last very long in the dark. She mentally kicked herself for leaving her phone at home, then started kicking her feet for real. Anything to relieve the pressure. Finally they pulled into the garage at home<br />
<br />
Leah didn&#39;t wait for Tina to help her out. Before the garage door had even begun to close she was out of her seat and jumping down to the concrete floor. She made a mad dash for the bathroom.<br />
<br />
She was going to make it! She was going to make it!<br />
<br />
She stumbled as she turned the corner into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Her bladder released.<br />
<br />
With a sob, Leah felt the inevitable happen. Her pullup filled. There was too much, she&#39;d been holding it too long. Her pullup couldn&#39;t take it any longer. She felt the warmth spread down her legs, staining the denim overalls a dark shade. It filled her shoes. Thankfully she had decided not to wear any of her new ones, they were safe and dry in their boxes in the back of the car. What little was left spread out in a small puddle between her feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leah!&quot; Tina exclaimed, exasperated. &quot;I told you those pullups couldn&#39;t take much. Don&#39;t move, I&#39;ve got to get a couple of things situated then I&#39;ll change you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Leah just stood there, tears beginning to fall down her cheeks. She didn&#39;t mind wetting the pullup. It felt good when she did. The padding expanding and growing warm, pressing up against her while still sagging heavily between her legs. It was a good feeling. But she wanted it on her terms, and she definitely didn&#39;t want it to leak everywhere. What if she had been out in public?<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t have long to suffer. Within minutes Tina was back and helping Leah strip off her sodden clothing. Her socks, shoes, and overalls were soaked, Tina just pulled them off and left them in the puddle. The shirt looked fine at first, but a quick inspection showed that it was a bit damp around the hem where her overalls had kept it close to her waist so it came off as well. Finally Tina tore the sides and removed the heavily soaked padding from between Leah&#39;s thighs and dropped it into a plastic bag for disposal. Leah was left in the middle of the kitchen naked, damp, and shivering.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was planning on just putting you to bed so I could finish unloading the car.&quot; Tina mused. &quot;But I guess that&#39;s not happening any time soon. Let&#39;s get you into the bath. I was going to do this tomorrow but I guess starting it now would be best.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tina led the shivering girl upstairs and into the master bathroom. While Leah had been waiting in the kitchen Tina had started filling it and it was mostly full now. She helped the diminutive girl into the water and proceeded to give her a good scrubbing. Leah was shocked, exhausted, and the water was very warm. She let her stepmother do as she pleased. She didn&#39;t even question it when Tina sat her on the side of the tub for about 15 minutes while she applied some kind of smelly cream to her sparse pubes. After she was thoroughly clean and warm Tina lifted her from the tub and dried her vigorously with a large bath towel before carrying her to her room.<br />
<br />
Leah found herself lying on her bed, wrapped in a towel, while Tina opened two of the boxes from their trip. The first box she opened was one of the ones from the strange store that Tina had entered alone. From it she extracted something flat and white that she unfolded placed next to Leah on the bed. Leah stared at it sleepily. It was a diaper. A thick one. Sized just for her. She looked back at her stepmother who was now opening the other box. This was the one that Marie had given her. Out of it came several articles of clothing which Tina set aside before finding one she apparently liked. This she carried over to the bed and lay it beside the diaper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Tina breathed, &quot;let&#39;s get you ready for bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Leah was too tired to pay much attention, she just let Tina do her thing. Tina started by rubbing some lavender smelling lotion all over Leah. This served to relax Leah even more. Then she expertly taped the diaper on after applying barrier cream. Leah thought the cream felt weird, but her sleep-addled brain dropped the thought before she could pursue it. Finally Leah was sat up and a pink onesie was pulled over her head. While Tina was fastening the snaps Leah looked down and &#39;Mommy&#39;s Girl&#39; written across the front of it. Finished with the snaps, Tina picked Leah up and pulled the covers back before laying her back down and tucking her in.<br />
<br />
Leah lay there, warm and happy. The diaper was so thick that it pushed her legs apart, but Leah didn&#39;t care. She was already falling asleep. She felt something press gently against her lips and opened them to accept a rubber nipple which she dreamily sucked on as Tina quietly left the room, turning the lights off as she went.</p>
