<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Warren scrolled through the list of apps on his smartphone as he waited in the schoolyard for the bus to arrive. He wasn&#39;t so much looking for an app to occupy his time as he was looking for an excuse not to meet anyone&#39;s gaze. <br />
<br />
At eighteen, the lanky youth was already self-conscious enough about his pasty, acne-laden face and skinny frame, but the embarrassment of having to wait for the bus when most of the other kids in his grade drove to and from school was almost too much. It also certainly didn&#39;t help matters that the few other students his age who rode this particular bus either pretended he didn&#39;t exist or actively made him wish he didn&#39;t. The ignorance he could stomach, but the snide glances and belittling remarks genuinely hurt. <br />
<br />
So what if he looked odd, was socially awkward, and one of the smartest kids at school? The latter accolade was one of the few good things Warren had to his name, even if most of the more athletically-inclined students chose to use this as a point of mockery. <br />
<br />
Speaking of which... <br />
<br />
&quot;Whatcha got there, War & Peace?&quot; chuckled a low, confident voice. Warren flinched, but didn&#39;t make eye contact, even as a firm hand swiped away his smart phone. &quot;Playing a dorky game, or looking at all the contacts you don&#39;t have?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Please give it back, Max,&quot; Warren sighed, still not looking up at the star quarterback, who would have seen such as a challenge. <br />
<br />
&quot;And what&#39;s this &#39;New You App?&#39;&quot; Max asked with another wry chuckle. &quot;One of those photo booth things?&quot; <br />
<br />
The bus finally rolled up to the curb and, with a hiss, extended its doors just before Max&#39;s finger pressed down on the app in question. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eh, I&#39;ll look it up at home,&quot; Max laughed, tossing the smart phone back to Warren. &quot;Be careful not to break that phone, War & Peace. I may need to swipe it for real some day.&quot; <br />
<br />
Warren looked up just in time to catch his smart phone, his brow already furrowing as he realized just what Max had been talking about. &#39;New You App?&#39; That didn&#39;t sound like anything Warren had on his phone. However, as he scrolled to the last page, it sure enough beamed brightly on the screen, a yellow square with the initial &#39;NYA&#39; proudly emblazoned across a logo of two arrows circling each other. <br />
<br />
As Warren got onto the bus and promptly sat at the front, as far away from Max and his cronies at the back as possible, he opened the app. It was remarkably bare, simply stating, &quot;Welcome to the New You App! Ever wanted to be someone else? Just hit the button below and you will be! New looks, new personality, new life, new everything! You&#39;ll still remember your old life, but you&#39;ll have memories of your new life as well. The more new lives you try, the more points you will receive. Points allow you to unlock new features in the app. WARNING: There is no reset feature. No matter what, you won&#39;t be visiting your first life, or any old life, if you choose to get a new one.&quot; <br />
<br />
That was... Odd, to say the least. Shrugging, and genuinely wishing he could be someone else right now, anyone else at all, Warren pressed the only option available on the New You App home screen. The instructions, warning, and button were briefly replaced by a loading icon resembling the app&#39;s dual arrow logo spinning around one another before returning to normal. <br />
<br />
In that split instance of loading, though, everything about Warren changed. <br />
<br />
Warren&#39;s pale, pasty flesh smoothed over, acne fading into itself and disappearing entirely beneath a toned, tan complexion. His cheeks softened and rounded out somewhat, his lips plumping and lightening to a bright pink, eyelashes lengthening and thickening. His eyes darkened from an icy blue to a deep emerald, and his wispy brown hair darkened to a dark chestnut. Those same locks thickened and grew out, cascading down his slenderer neck, over his thinning, tightening, and sloping shoulders, and down his shrinking back. <br />
<br />
Warren&#39;s adam&#39;s apple receded as his voice climbed several octaves, ensuring that the next time he spoke it would come out of his fuller lips as a soft contralto. Meanwhile, his traces of body hair receded into more smooth, tan skin on a shrinking frame. Gone were the days of his long, lanky limbs and skinny composure, replaced with a more compact countenance. <br />
<br />
His waist cinched in tightly, pushing excess mass downwards to widen his hips, plump up his buttocks, and fill out his thighs. The slight bulge in Warren&#39;s jeans retreated as his--or rather, her--new sex formed. Her internal organs shifted and rearranged as well. Finally, at least physically, Warren&#39;s pectoral muscles converted to fat and ballooned outwards, expanding until two full, heavy female breasts strained to burst free from her shirt. <br />
<br />
Next, Warren&#39;s clothes took a similar route. A bra appeared to cup her new bosom, securing itself around her back and shoulders. Her undershorts shrunk, tightened, and thinned into a pair of panties. Her dark t-shirt shrank and shifted into a far more feminine pink top even as her jeans rolled up and reformed into a pair of short shorts. <br />
<br />
The world seemed to spin even as Warren&#39;s head did the same, her very mind, memories, and personality changing, when new ones didn&#39;t insert themselves outright. She found herself plucked from the front of the bus and plopped down next to Max. Her feelings of fear and surprise at being so close to her hated bully shifted into a mixture of happiness, comfort, and a not-so-small degree of attraction. Although she didn&#39;t at all forget being Warren the male and being the object of Max&#39;s constant teasing, her new memories told her that in this new life, she was Willow the female, the object of Max&#39;s affection--and his girlfriend. Enjoying the sort of games Max would have called &#39;dorky&#39; also shifted into a love of all things fashion, while her contact list filled up with friends that, in this version of reality, she&#39;d known for years. Even her grades seemed to be different now, as Willow recalled that she was a B student at best, not that she apparently cared all that much. <br />
<br />
Willow&#39;s head reeled, her old life gone but not forgotten, as the New You App finished its work. <br />
<br />
&quot;You okay?&quot; Max asked, alerting Willow to the fact that she was leaning up against him, head on his shoulder, her thick hair an excellent cushion. Where once she would have been repulsed at this idea, she found herself snuggling up closer. <br />
<br />
&quot;I... Don&#39;t know...&quot; Willow admitted. Her new body was certainly happy with this current situation, but her altered and conflicted mind was less certain. &quot;But I suppose I&#39;ll have to find out.&quot; <br />
<br />
Willow exited the New You App. She would explore it more later, but for now, she needed to see what she thought of this new life.</p>
