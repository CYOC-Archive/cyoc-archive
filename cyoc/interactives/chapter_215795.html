<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Wednesday afternoon was busy for Allison. She had adapted back to being a girl again, all the awkwardness she felt that morning was gone. She was glad the alien feeling she felt in her original form was only temporary. <br />
<br />
Now she sat in a classroom that one of her friends had arranged to be the meeting place of a new club. Veronica had taken the initiative to start Changeling Inc. in order to get more people in the school viewing Allison&#39;s show. According to school rules they needed at least three members. Apparently Josie and Rachel had signed up as well.<br />
<br />
The worked for Allison since it gave her a chance to spread the word of her show this Saturday and give her a chance to set up some volunteers. It was inconvenient since she had to wait after school and deal with club activities every Wednesday afternoon, but hopefully would be worth the work.<br />
<br />
Apart of Changeling Inc. was every week they had a theme for the changes. This week theme: couple counseling. Couples were coming with whatever issue they hoped she could solve. The would come in one couple at a time while the others would wait in a line in the hall.<br />
<br />
Kate and Aaron <br />
<br />
Aaron was the guitarist in a band he and his friends at school had started. He wore ripped jeans and a white shirt. Two black dots gave on the chest and black stripes towards the bottom gave it the feel of being a close up with a skull. He  had a black jacket over it and a spiked color that hung loosely around his neck. His jeans were black and ripped.<br />
<br />
His girlfriend Kate was more casual, dressed in a blank t-shirt and jeans often worn in compliance to school dress codes. <br />
<br />
&quot;How can I help you today?&quot; Allison asked.<br />
<br />
Kate smiled. &quot;As you know, I&#39;m bisexual.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... did not know that actually.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I am.&quot; Kate assured her. &quot;Aaron and I have been dating for awhile. He&#39;s great, and I love how things are going between us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel a but coming.&quot; Allison interjected. <br />
<br />
&quot;But...&quot; Kate confirmed. &quot;Its been a bit since I dated a girl and I feel a bit...&quot; Kate&#39;s voice dropped low as if she was embarrassed. &quot;Bored? With boys I mean.&quot; She blushed. &quot;I don&#39;t know, I like variety. I don&#39;t want to break up, but I kind of want a change.&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison looked at Aaron. &quot;How do you feel about this?&quot;<br />
<br />
He shrugged. &quot;Its not like I haven&#39;t looked at porn while dating Kate. As long as we don&#39;t cheat on one another I don&#39;t care if she gets her motor running by watching someone else.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kate jumped in really excited. &quot;But I heard about your &#39;sister&#39; and Rachel and realized I didn&#39;t have to get my &#39;motor&#39;&quot; she said the word with heavy sarcasm, &quot; running anywhere else.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron picked up the conversation here. &quot;Kate wants me to be a girl for a while so she can scratch the itch she gets from that side of her sexuality. I kind of talked to your sister yesterday. Before I even finished asking her opinion she jumped in and said, &#39;do it&#39;. Apparently she highly recommends trying out being a lesbian.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You talk with anyone else about it?&quot; Allison asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Chris thinks a girl guitarist would me good for our band. We are all guys so we are lacking in the eye candy department. He wants to do a trial run. My parents are a bit of hippies and encourage experimentation and freedom of expression.&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison nodded. &quot;Okay, but if I do this, I&#39;d like you to play at my show on Saturday. &quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron sat up quickly. &quot;At a stadium on TV? You bet. Come on, lets do this!&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison smiled at his enthusiasm. &quot;Any requests Kate?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kate spoke with a quiet voice, suddenly shy. &quot;I like girls that are shorter than me, with big boots.<br />
<br />
Aaron was tall and thin at 5&#39;11. Kate was 5&#39;7. Allison brought up his information and created a list of changes. She had a thought and decided to add an extra change.<br />
<br />
Aaron->Erin<br />
Physical appearance: <br />
&#9679;male->female<br />
&#9679;5&#39;11->5&#39;5<br />
&#9679;no breast-> D-cup<br />
Occupation:<br />
&#9679;High-school student/ punk guitarist -> high-school cheerleader/punk guitarist <br />
<br />
Aaron began to shrink. His body reshaping into a feminine form, with ample breasts. Her jeans shrunk into ripped balck denim short-shorts, while black leggings grew from beneath covering her legs. Her loose collar tightened into a choker with spikes. He jacket cut changed to fit her, but actually grew in length beyond the end of her shorts, as if to form some kind of mini-dress. Her black hair grew till in was shoulder length. The color at the top was still black, but the color shifted shades as it went down, gradually turning into a crimson red at the bottom. The shift started about halfway down and appeared as if she had died it that way specifically rather than just letting her hair grown out. Her shirt tightened and changed into the cheerleader crop top that the squad wore. She looked down her new top. &quot;What&#39;s this?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I took the liberty in making ypu a cheerleader.&quot; Allison turned towards Kate. &quot;I hear they are more flexible.&quot; She winked.<br />
<br />
Kate smiled and wrapped her arms around her new girlfriend and gave her a kiss on the lips. &quot;Common babe, let&#39;s get you to practice before you are late.&quot; The two left and sent in the next couple.<br />
<br />
Julia and Thomas<br />
<br />
The couple that came in was a freshman and a senior. &quot;So my mom isn&#39;t quite thrilled with the idea of me dating a senior. She says he is too old for me and that he is about to be in college. But she watches Mornings with Mandy and told me about what you did. She made the comment that if we really want to date, we should ask if you could make Thomas younger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay with this?&quot; Allison asked Thomas.<br />
<br />
He shrugged. &quot;Sure. It&#39;s just a couple of years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I do this, you won&#39;t be graduating this year. You will have to redo all of high-school while your friends go to college.&quot; She warned him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it wasn&#39;t like we were going to the same college, and that just means more time with Julia.&quot; Thomas countered.<br />
<br />
With that Allison quickly typed in her phone.<br />
Thomas<br />
&#9679;18->14<br />
<br />
Thomas shrunk in height as he regressed slightly. While not as drastic as Mandy, there was a noticeable difference in his age. &quot;I made you a bit younger then her this time. Hope that&#39;s fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s great!&quot; Julia cried as she kissed her boyfriend. <br />
<br />
Jen and Charlie<br />
<br />
The sophomores that entered next were vaguely familiar to Allison. The girl was a tall brunette who was equal in height with the boy with dirty blond hair. At least Jen was. She did a lot of sports in the school, but her boyfriend was new to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;So I&#39;m athletic.&quot; Jen began. &quot;I&#39;m basically on every girl sports team we have. The problem is that we don&#39;t have a lot of girl&#39;s team, and boys get better scholarships offers anyways.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I see where this is going.&quot; Allison began. &quot;But we are doing couple counseling.&quot; She gestured towards Charlie. &quot;How does he fit into this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen squirmed awkwardly. &quot;So I think being a guy well help me but Charlie doesn&#39;t want to date a guy.&quot; She seemed exasperated. &quot;He also doesn&#39;t want to be turned gay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So...being a girl is better?&quot; Allison asked.<br />
<br />
Charlie finally spoke up. &quot;I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m okay with that. I just don&#39;t want to break up and that is somehow the compromise we came to.&quot; Charlie seemed annoyed as well.<br />
<br />
Allison thought about this. This one might need actual counseling rather than just a change. &quot;So the compromise would be a double gender bender. Jen gets to go for the boys team, and you get to be his girlfriend.&quot; She took on what she hoped was a therapist tone. &quot;You seemed a bit unhappy about this. Maybe because you feel like you are sacrificing to keep your status quo? How about instead of just turning you into a girl, we tweek things a bit so that you get something new out of it too?&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlie looked confused. &quot;Like what?&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison thought about it. &quot;Well Jen is getting into the boys teams, maybe we could put you on the girl&#39;s? Have you ever thought of cheerleading?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen got excited. &quot;Oh yes! Dating a cheerleader would be great as a guy. We could go to games together and the cheerleaders practice is at the same time as mine usually are so we wouldn&#39;t be missing anymore time together.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlie seemed a bit unsure but relented. &quot;I guess we could give it a try.&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison nodded. &quot;Remember, all changes can be reversed so if either of you are unhappy I cam make alterations or undo everything if necessary.&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison pulled up the options and quickly changed Jen to Ben, and changed the teams she was on in her occupation list, as well as added a few new ones that didn&#39;t have a girl equivalent. <br />
<br />
Charlie became Charlotte, though the chronivac app said her nickname was still Charlie. <br />
<br />
Jen shot up and filled out with rather impressive muscles while Charlie shrank. She was very cute, though he figure was more athletic and not some of the exaggerated features she gave other girls. Her hair brightened and fell in curly locks.<br />
<br />
Ben wore his football jersey over his shirt while Charlie was in her cheerleading uniform. Charlie seemed a little awkward as she left, even though Allison made sure she was a girl all the way through and attracted to boys. Ben seemed more enthusiastic. Allison hoped she wasn&#39;t making a mistake with this one.<br />
<br />
Travis and Monica <br />
<br />
Travis was incredibly popular. Monica on the other end was shy, quite, flat, and largely overlooked. The two of them together were an odd pairing.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Monica tutored me, and we hit it off. But she is self-conscious and doesn&#39;t want to be seen with me. She thinks people will judge her harshly. &quot;<br />
<br />
It was Monica turn to speak. &quot;He also really doesn&#39;t get a lot of my interests. Sci-fi and fantasy aren&#39;t his things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So Monica wants to be hotter, while Travis wants to expand his interests. Right?&quot; They both nodded<br />
<br />
She started with Travis&#39;s mental change. She uped his IQ and gave him a working knowledge of science fiction and fantasy tropes.<br />
<br />
She then turned her attention to Monica. She carefully crafted the girl&#39;s new image before typing it out.<br />
<br />
Monica <br />
Physical:<br />
&#9679;5&#39;4-> 5&#39;9<br />
&#9679;A-cup->C-cup<br />
&#9679;Mousey brown hair-> Chestnut brown glossy hair<br />
&#9679;Pale Complexion-> Clear/healthy tanned complexion <br />
Mental:<br />
&#9679;Confidence level 1-> level 7<br />
<br />
Allison decided not to max out her confidence to avoid creating a narcissist. While Monica&#39;s changes were blatantly obvious as she grew to a height closer to her new boyfriend, Travis was a bit subtler and he shirt became a Lord of the Rings t-shirt. Allison smiled as Monica took advantage of her new confidence to kiss her boyfriend. They left ha d in hand and sent in the last person of the day.<br />
<br />
Orion<br />
<br />
Orion was an odd boy. Firstly, that wasn&#39;t s name you heard often. Secondly he was there alone. Finally, he just sat there awkwardly staring at Allison instead of speaking. <br />
<br />
He was a skinny boy who was probably a year younger than Allison. He had bright red hair and freckles. Allison imagined he was probably bullied. In fact she thought she might have heard rumors about him having some trouble.<br />
<br />
Allison encouraged him to speak again. &quot;Go on Orion. I can&#39;t help if you don&#39;t tell me what&#39;s wrong. Though I&#39;m not sure I can help if the other half of the couple isn&#39;t here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not a part of a couple.&quot; He finally said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why would you come to couple counseling? She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like to he apart of one.&quot; He said before pausing. &quot;With you.&quot; Another pause. &quot;Specifically. &quot;<br />
<br />
Allison was taken aback. While she had been hot on before, she hadn&#39;t been expecting it now. The way he phrased it was also...off putting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;m flattered but wasn&#39;t exactly looking for someone right now.&quot; Ava crawled into her lap and mewed possessively. &quot;Also I&#39;m kind of sort of in a relationship.&quot;<br />
<br />
Orion glanced at the cat. &quot;Technically, Adrian is in a relationship. I was hoping Allison was available.&quot;<br />
<br />
The cat looked up at Allison and cocked its head to the side. Something about her eyes seemed like she was interested in the idea. &quot;What exactly are you expecting a relationship with me to be like?&quot; Allison asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I get to date the prettiest, funniest girl in school. Probably some weird changes here and there.&quot; He held up his hands uo quickly. &quot;I&#39;m fine with that though. I figure I would be spending part time as a girl, or dog or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison did like dogs. &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; She said. &quot;I really don&#39;t know you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We could try to get to know each other first. Maybe hang out some?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm.&quot; Allison thought. &quot;No. I&#39;d be too aware that you were trying to date me.&quot; A thought suddenly hit her. &quot;That is unless, you are okay with me making you not being attracted to me. Just temporary of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So my feelings for you will just go away?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was thinking something a bit more extreme. You said you would be okay with being a girl part time. How about a girl who is attracted to boys? That way we could hang out and get to know each other. After a trial period I can turn ypu back and give you real answer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Orion seemed nervous. &quot;O-okay.&quot; <br />
<br />
He wasn&#39;t finished stuttering out his answer before Allison had finished typing. Orion&#39;s chest filled out and her but expanded. Her hair grew and found itself in a ponytail. Soon Aurora was yet another addition to the cheerleader team, ready for practice which had already started.<br />
<br />
Aurora was a bit bummed that her feelings for Allison had changed. Instead of a warm love, it was more of an awe you feel when you look up to someone. &quot;Come on, we can talk on your way to practice. I need to see your captain anyways.&quot;<br />
<br />
Veronica <br />
<br />
Veronica was leading practice as the captain of the team. Her best friend Allison arrived with another new member. She let her second in command take over as she went to speak with Allison. <br />
<br />
The red headed girl broke off from her conversation and ran over to join practice. &quot;So, how many is that?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
Allison thought about it. &quot;Mandy from the talk show, Erin who will be splitting her time between this and her band, Charlie who is dating our football team&#39;s new receiver, and now Aurora. So that&#39;s four members, all made incredibly talented. They will get you to state this year for sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
Veronica smiled. &quot;Alright. As agreed, my squad is at your disposal for whatever changes you want for you show Saturday. Just make sure they are all back to they way they were before the show for practice Monday.&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison shook her friends hand. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, nothing more than a two day change. Pleasure doing business with you. Now if you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;d like to get a few pictures of the new girls I gave you for my social media.&quot;</p>
