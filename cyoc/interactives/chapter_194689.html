<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The two friends returned to the rest of the team. Even though Cole felt as though everybody could clock his nascent breasts, nobody seemed to pay attention yet and the voleyball session ended as usual. In the changing room, Cole manage to turn his back to his mates again and actually noticed Sam putting himself in the way to discreetly block more of the view somehow, protecting him from being found out. As they left school, they parted ways without much of a word.<br />
<br />
Riding his bike back home felt as uncomfortable as in the morning. His junk chafed in his shorts, and he could feel every pothole in the road putting more strain on his jiggling chest.<br />
<br />
When he came home, Cole found a note from his mom on the kitchen&#39;s table: &quot;Gone with Melissa to the dog rescue, she found pups in the backyard. We may eat out afterwards so help yourself in the fridge.&quot;<br />
<br />
Puppies, uh? Cole found it a bit strange, but he was unaware his sister had been impregnated by anything, let alone that she would lay puppies. Last he knew, Erika was still ingesting her own goo to appear female with Melissa, and anyway it didn&#39;t look like the two had talked since their fallout.<br />
<br />
The memory of being caught with his dick in his sister&#39;s girlfriend came back to his memory, along with confusing feelings. He thought of Erika as a girl, even though the salve had changed her like it had changed him. And she made him feel horny... But Sam also made him feel horny even though he&#39;s a guy! And it had never happened before... Was it the salve that made him lust after anything, or something in the swimming pool changing him when it grew breasts on him? What did it mean, was he himself anymore at this point?<br />
<br />
His phone buzzed and brought him back to the present. It was a text from Sam.<br />
<br />
Sam - <i>&quot;Hey, can I come over to hang out? Wanna talk about these hormones you&#39;re taking&quot;</i><br />
<br />
Cole frowned before typing - <i>&quot;It&#39;s not that, I&#39;m not trans&quot;</i><br />
<br />
Sam - <i>&quot;Whatever, I just need you to show this to me. It&#39;s important.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
Cole sighed. <i>&quot;Alright, hurry up, nobody else is home right now.</i><br />
<br />
About twenty minutes later, Sam knocked on the front door and Cole let him in. They dropped on the living room&#39;s souch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok so what&#39;s the big deal&quot; Cole asked, crossing his arms over his swollen breast.<br />
<br />
Sam took an inspiration before starting: &quot;Look, I don&#39;t want you to get the wrong idea. I&#39;m not some kind of pervert. I don&#39;t want you to think of me like that...&quot;<br />
<br />
He then went on. &quot;I just... I need to tell you something I haven&#39;t told anyone before. It&#39;s not just I like boobs, it&#39;s that I wish my body was more like yours. You need to tell me how you did it! I can&#39;t stop thinking about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole froze for a second, taken by surprise. &quot;Why would you ever want this to happen to you? If anybody knew they would call you a freak!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam looked a little pained but went on: &quot;I don&#39;t see you like that. It&#39;s more, like, often I feel more like a girl than a boy. I&#39;ve tried hiding it and playing it cool with the other guys, but I think my buddies from last year found out something was off and they bullied me out of the group. So I hope it won&#39;t be like that with you, and maybe you can  help me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole&#39;s faked coolness was more and more shaken by the minute. He had never seen his friend open up like that. He was trying to adjust his worldview even though that was a lot to take in at once.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok but... I&#39;m not like you, I don&#39;t especially want to be a girl, and this happened to me by accident. I don&#39;t see you as a freak either but I just want that to be clear. And yeah all I did was take a swim in the pool, and I think there must have been a foreign substance leaked there; then boom, growth spurt. I swear it happened like that and there is nothing more to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
He vaguely remembered Erika had warned him about this, but had forgotten the specifics anyway.<br />
<br />
Sam&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;Do you... do you think I could try going into your swimming pool also?&quot; Cole shrugged in response.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, whatever. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s still working; but don&#39;t ask me to go into the pool as well, I don&#39;t wanna risk it getting worse.<br />
<br />
The two friends went to the backyard and Cole sat at one end of the pool while Sam quickly undressed to get into the water.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t stare!&quot; Sam protested while Cole averted his gaze uncomfortably.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok but hurry up&quot; Cole said in a low voice, I don&#39;t want the neighboors to see us and ask questions.<br />
<br />
Sam immersed himself - Cole was still struggling to see him as &quot;her&quot; for now - in the water, and took a few laps around the pool.<br />
<br />
&quot;How long do I have to stay in before it works?&quot; Sam asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know! Stop asking so many questions, I don&#39;t know more than I told you. Just... stay in there while I get you a towel.&quot; Cole replied before getting up and back into the house.<br />
<br />
His dick was stirring faintly, so taking a break from the sight of his friend was probably for the best. Once he felt he had sufficiently calmed down, he grabbed a towel and brought it back to Sam, who wrapped himself in it as soon as he got out of the pool.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks mate&quot; Sam said with a blush on his cheeks. &quot;My body is kinda tingling, I hope it works...&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole shrugged, not sure how to react, and after Sam had dried himself quickly, the two went to Cole&#39;s room to play some video games like normal, sitting on Cole&#39;s bed.<br />
<br />
After a couple hours cooped up in the same room though, the two &quot;boys&quot; were squirming more and more, as a wave of hormones was hitting both of them again...</p>
