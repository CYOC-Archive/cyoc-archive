<br />
FEBRUARY<br />
<br />
Robbie had hoped that the Great Blizzard of 2022 would inadvertently help rekindle her and Elizabeth&#39;s relationship. <br />
<br />
The idea of them and the kids trapped in the house while endless gales of blinding white snow blew around outside seemed romantic in its own way. Maybe they would cuddle up underneath a snuggy blanket to keep each other warm in front of the fireplace. One thing that Robbie still had trouble adapting to as a New Woman, even after being one for close to six years now, was that female bodies dealt with cold temperatures slightly worse than men did simply due to a lower metabolic rate, but if it meant that they were forced to cuddle, all the better. <br />
<br />
Then, they could discuss their marital problems without any interference from the outside world. They&#39;d eventually kiss and make up, and Robbie would promise to never be unfaithful again. <br />
<br />
And maybe Robbie could prove her worth. She could still shovel the driveway, and chop wood in the backyard! She could still be the provider for everyone, and not, as Elizabeth called her, a &quot;slut for brains&quot;.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, things hadn&#39;t worked out that way. <br />
<br />
Despite the storm, despite their many years of a happy relationship as a heterosexual couple, Elizabeth still wanted a divorce, and she had made her soon to be ex wife pack her things and leave the house at the beginning of the month. <br />
<br />
Robbie had been terrified at first. Where would she live now?<br />
<br />
Thankfully, her coworker and sometimee fuckbuddy Lucretia had allowed Robbie to crash at her apartment until she was back on her feet. <br />
<br />
Not so thankfully, the office didn&#39;t allow relationships among co-workers, so they had to keep things on the down low. <br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
MARCH<br />
<br />
Millie Quesada once again found herself teaching from home, just as she had done two years prior during the beginning of the short lived Covid-19 epidemic. <br />
<br />
The school district had found it unsafe for grade schoolers to be out in such extreme conditions, winter weather which hadn&#39;t been seen in decades, so remote learning was back in session.<br />
<br />
 It was the type of blizzard that hadn&#39;t been seen for most people currently alive. The last big one in town had taken place years before Millie was ever born, and she was no spring chicken despite appearing to be in her mid twenties.  <br />
<br />
Alas, Millie always tried her best to see the positive side of things. Although she loved coming into work everyday and seeing her students in person, she also loved lounging around in yoga pants while drinking hot chocolate sometimes. <br />
<br />
She saw the Great Blizzard as an opportunity to spend more time with her little darling Paloma, who was growing like a weed, and with her wifey Juliana, whom was just as beautiful as the day they had both changed into women. <br />
<br />
And unlike at school, if Millie and Juliana ever wanted a quickie(Or a longie), all she had to do was logout of Zoom and close the laptop screen. <br />
<br />
**<br />
APRIL<br />
<br />
Cat Thorfinsson was bummed out.<br />
<br />
She had been due to start her first job tomorrow, which a lovely woman named Ms. Carter had helped her find, after Cat&#39;s mother Kim gave her now adult daughter the ultimatum of getting a job within a month or being kicked out of the house. <br />
<br />
That was when mother nature had decided to be a bitch today and dump nearly four feet of snow on Cat&#39;s hometown. The door couldn&#39;t even be opened without snow crashing through the front door. <br />
<br />
Cat hated to admit it to herself, but life had been *so* much better since her &quot;Dad Mom&quot; Ophelia/Oliver had mysteriously disappeared. She hated her Dad so much, but she had never able to process how she really felt until just recently. He was just such a prick. <br />
<br />
Nobody else much seemed to mind that Oliver/Ophelia was missing either. The cops hadn&#39;t seemed to search very hard for her when she had first gone missing. The True Crime sleuths online had their theories that black magic may have been involved. Anything was possible in the post Great Change world, but Cat was still mostly a skeptic. <br />
<br />
Still though, whatever happened to her, Ophelia had paid the bills and there was only so much generosity that Hannah&#39;s family could grace Cat and Kim with until Cat began to feel like a lazy sponge. <br />
<br />
It was time for Cat to grow up, but the world kept dumping on her. <br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
MAY<br />
<br />
Kayla had prepared Jo, Martha, and herself three nice bowls was of oatmeal for breakfast. She loved cooking for and taking care of her family.<br />
<br />
Martha found this very amusing. Back when they had first married, which now felt like a thousand years ago, her husband Kyle had been a traditional Italian manly man. He had become more sensitive and kind over the decades as he had aged, and he had lost much of what his father had taught him about women when he discovered that Martha couldn&#39;t be tamed, but a part of Kyle&#39;s machismo had always been present, like when, as a ninety year old man, he had fought off a home invasion.<br />
<br />
Now, in 2022, Kayla was the perfect little homemaker, and she relished her role as mommy to Jo and the sexy, submissive partner to Martha. <br />
<br />
Part of Kyle&#39;s change in perspective had come from The Great Change, which notably had altered the personalities of many New Women(Though not all), but part of it too had been Kayla&#39;s desire for new experiences in life. <br />
<br />
Having a daughter was certainly a new experience, for both of them. Especially one so inquisitive and seemingly wise beyond her years. <br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t matter that Jo wasn&#39;t really their child, she and Kayla had loved her just the same, and had done everything to nurture her. <br />
<br />
The only issue was that, legally, Jo didn&#39;t belong to them. <br />
<br />
Kayla and Martha had managed to slip Jo under the radar for years. The chaos caused by the Great Change had made this easy. <br />
<br />
So easy, that the old turned young couple had thought the government had somehow forgotten about them. <br />
<br />
No such luck. Martha held a letter in her hand from the city saying that Jo Saviano had to attend school starting this fall. <br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
JUNE <br />
<br />
President Rodham had been forced to declare a state of emergency. The blizzard was in its fifth consecutive month with no sign of slowing down.<br />
<br />
The public was panicking. Thousands had died since January from the unrelenting cold, especially the poor, whom especially in the western states had been blindsided by the mysterious winter. <br />
<br />
Farmers and businesswomen were apoplectic with worry. <br />
<br />
The only people who were smiling, seemingly, were people who sold winter gear and ski resorts, the latter of which was reporting record business. <br />
<br />
Savannah Tullio, who was quickly rising to be the most powerful woman in Occ-Ops in a way that her colleagues found scary, was dispatched to find the engimatic Sorceresses Supreme. <br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
NOW<br />
<br />
&quot;Home sweet home, babe&quot; Aziza said as she and Kylie were back in their comfortable dwelling once more. A magical green fire burned in the fireplace. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, Ty had dumped the three humbled sorceresses in the middle of Times Square in New York City instead of sending them straight home, which meant that the shaken Aziza had nearly screwed up the spell to send her and Kylie back to Arabia. <br />
<br />
Savannah meanwhile, had portaled back to Russia to see Katerina.<br />
<br />
Aziza held the de-cursed snowglobe, <br />
now just Kylie&#39;s kitchy Christmas present, in her hand, wracking her brain for clues. What type of person was strong enough to make a curse like that?<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Kylie Perkins was depressed as she wondered if she was really the evil and depraved person that Savannah said that she was.</p>

She couldn&#39;t be, could she?</h3>
