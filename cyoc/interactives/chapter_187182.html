<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tou soon saw the attendant, now looking mutch worse than how you had left her, she was completely naked, her body almost covered in bruises and cuts along her arms, her eyes were red from crying and her once neatly tied back blond hair now hung wildly over her head, you then looked up to see who was drawing her, he looked to be some type of security guard, he wore a black denim trench coat and a black mask that covered his entire face, the only fusible part being his eyes that stared coldly out of the masks eye holes, in one hand he held Alice the attendants arm, gripping it so tight that her skin was beginning to turn red as she struggled to escape and in the other he pulled along some tipe of metal table on wheels, with some type of glass barrel shaped dome on top.<br />
<br />
Once again Alice as you now knew her began to plead with her capturer &quot;please Henry, just let me go and il disappear, you&#39;ll never see me again you-&quot; Alice was soon cut off as the guard seemed to have enough of her pleads for mercy and flung her over the fence, sending Alice crying and tumbling to the grass, every animal in the enclosure including yourself could only watch in horror as to what was happening, then the guard who you now knew was Henry opened the gate and walked in, carefully pulling the metal table in behind him before shutting the gate, you then got a good look at the table, it had a lower shelf with two large liquid containers on it, and you shuddered in fear as you read the written on their sides. <br />
<br />
Alice began drawing herself along the grass, now desperately trying to get away, but then the guard was on her like a hound, suddenly standing over the top of her as he wrapped one hand under her chin and raised her head towards the sky, then with the other he pulled a long black peace of leather from his pocket and proceeded to collar the attendant, he then let go and walked back over to the table as Alice desperately tried to remove the collar, but you were confused when she suddenly whent limp, her body suddenly making a star shape as she jerked her head around, clearly the only body part she currently had controll of, then everyone became dead silent as the guard opened the glass container atop the table and suddenly all that could be herd was the high pitched wail of a newborn baby.<br />
<br />
The guard then turned around, now holding a baby in each arm, you knew what was about to happen, and you guessed that Alice did too as Henry set the babies down infront of Alice&#39;s legs before he let out a sigh &quot;look Alice, I don&#39;t want to do this any more than you want me to do this, so make this easy for both of us ok&quot; said the guard as he took a familiar looking syringe from his pocket and inserted it into the attendants thigh, your ears flattened and your fur stood up as you remembered what that syringe could do as you glanced at your swolen belly, before gazing around at the gorillas and chimps, all having forms simular to your own, your focus was shifted however as Alice let out a loud groan, and you were stunned by what you saw.<br />
<br />
Henry had picked up one of the young children, the tiny human then began wriggling and fussing in his arms, clearly not happy to be outside with no bodily coverings or protection, but the babies whimpers were soon cut off as he then proceeded to gently force the child into Alice&#39;s folds, her Pussy&#39;s lips parting with ease around the child&#39;s head, Alice let out a loud moan, lifting her head to see the bulge of the babies head entering between her hips, her eyes began to water as she must have known that she would be punished by suffering a simular fate to your own, you watched on in horrified fascination as the baby could be seen traveling deeper and deeper into the attendant, her groans of pain and pleasure could be herd from every corner of the enclosure, but her womb must not have been as flexible as your own, being as you could clearly see almost every detail of the babies body beneath her skin, watching as the baby turned its head around and began pushing out with its hands, trying to understand where it was, you watched Alice&#39;s face with every one of the child&#39;s movements, her face would scrunch up in discomfort before once again settling into a look of bliss, almost exactly as you had been when your foals were forced into you.<br />
<br />
As time draged on a few of the chimps began to move away from the scene infront of them as Alice let out another moan as the second baby began its way into her waiting womb, even some if the gorillas had moved away, for they had needs and had to care for their unborn broods as you looked around, seeing some primates cupping water in their hands to either wash their fur or bring to their lips to drink, while others took fruits and other food items from a basket that hung in a tree and took their food away to sit and eat, but you and your gorilla aquantence stayed close by as you watched the one responsible for your current form writhe in pleasure and discomfort, until finally the guard let go of the second baby, only its legs sticking out of Alice&#39;s sopping wet pussy, then suddenly it was like Alice once again had controll over her body as she cried out, her hands clutching over her belly as the babies moved under her skin, nudging and pressing out against her hands.<br />
<br />
Not long after that the guard played now two empty canisters back under the table and began wheeling it out of the enclosure, you then raised your head from grazing to see Alice groan as she heaved her new form into a sitting position, her most obvious change was her belly, bot entirely round, with faint outlines if the babies within still visible, but nowhere near as visible as before, her breasts had considerably grown in size, heavily resting atop her belly as she placed one of her hands atop her new assets wincing as her hands brushed over her bruised body, it was then that your mind was made up, as the guard silently closed the gate you....</p>
