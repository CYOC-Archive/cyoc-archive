<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the group of friends now talked of Mika&#39;s new powers and what they would mean in the future, they failed to notice two women and elderly man approaching. Lisa was grateful to have gotten a hold of Gregor so quickly. Gregor was notoriously difficult to contact so she was astounded how quickly he arrived at the shop. Lisa cautiously wondered if he had been expecting this but quickly dismissed this idea. After all the issues with out of control magical items maybe Gregor was just being cautious. The fact he had brought Kei with him told Lisa enough that he thought this to be serious.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s them,&quot; Lisa stated pointing at the four 20 something women and old man. &quot;I recognize that girl Katie. I&#39;m guessing the others are friends of hers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think the others possess any magical items,&quot; Kei asked. &quot;Before we take action we should be aware of the capabilities of our enemies. From what Gregor told me you believe this is an item of incredible power.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t quite know,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;I&#39;m assuming they do but what kind of magic is anyone&#39;s guess. And trust me if you had felt the power radiating of that girl Katie you would know she has some incredible magic. What do you think Gregor?&quot;<br />
<br />
The old man surveyed the small group in front of him. Gregor could quite easily detect magic emanating from three of the four women. Two were in possession of magical items while the third appeared to be a novice magical user. What interested him the most was the old man smiling broadly at the four women. The power he possessed rivaled his own magic, perhaps even surpassing him. As he looked more closely at the old man he smiled as the realization of who he was dawned on him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gregor what do you think,&quot; Kei asked. Gregor tuned to her and smiled. &quot;I think now would be an apt time for us to introduce ourselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gregor are you sure,&quot; Lisa asked, trying to hide the apprehension in her voice. &quot;That girl Katie may not take too kindly to seeing us. I barely avoided being reduced to infancy last time I saw her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have nothing to fear,&quot; he said. &quot;In fact I&#39;m quite sure that with the proper introduction things will turn out quite nicely.&quot; With that Gregor quickly began to make his way towards the group with Kei and Lisa in hot pursuit.<br />
<br />
Katie, Mika and Mary Elise were now happily talking with one another discussing the insanity that had occurred over the previous couple of days. Sofia too was joining the conversation asking numerous questions about everything that left the girls bewildered. They had never met someone quite as energetic as Sofia before her energy and sunny nature were both infectious and overwhelming. Katie was now beginning to relax, until she noticed Lisa approaching.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, she gasped. &quot;It can&#39;t be.&quot; Puzzled, Mika, Mary Elsie and Sofia turned and looked. &quot;What is what&#39;s wrong,&quot; they asked in unison. Fear was consuming Katie as she shook with with fear. &quot;It&#39;s Lisa, from the shop.&quot; She whispered. The others slowly turned to see Lisa approaching with an elderly man and another woman. Mika and Mary Elise reflexively stood in front of Katie. Sofia on the other hand began marching straight toward them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! You! Lisa!&quot; Sofia yelled. &quot;Now you just hold on one minute right there young lady. You got some nerve scaring that poor girl half to death. I don&#39;t know exactly what happened in that shop but poor Katie here has been terrified ever since she met you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa paused and cocked her head. She didn&#39;t know who this was but was taken aback by her forwardness. &quot;I&#39;m sorry you are?&quot; She questioned. &quot;My name ain&#39;t that important right now,&quot; Sofia energetically bellowed. &quot;All I know is you scared that girl half to death, did something to her ring and your frightening her now. Further more who tries to sneak up on someone, you know when I was your age. Well what I mean was, when I was your age the first time, a young lady showed proper courtesy and respect. You don&#39;t go sneaking around trying to steal other people&#39;s stuff. Kids today.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa&#39;s jaw dropped as the energetic young woman continued to berate her. Lisa could tell by her language she had probably regressed in age. However she was in utter shock at the woman&#39;s lack of fear and bold nature. Sofia now stood nose to nose with Lisa as she continued yelling at her trying to defend Katie. Lisa herself wasn&#39;t sure if she wanted to punch this woman or apologize for causing so much trouble. Much to her relief and dismay it was Kei that made the first move. A swift movement on Kei&#39;s part created distance between Lisa and Sofia knocking the energetic woman backwards on to her rear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ow,&quot; Sofia moaned as she stood up. &quot;You know you don&#39;t have to be so rough. I&#39;m just trying to explain how rude your friend was being. I guess I should of included you in that conversation. Who blindsides an old woman like that. Well not really that old any more to be honest but still.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kei was about to say something when an odd chill ran through her body. Looking down she stared in horror at her legs. Her legs were immobile, rooted to the ground. Worse they seemed to be freezing in place. Kei noticed the color of her pants fading away as they turned to stone. The warrior woman&#39;s voice froze in her throat. The lower portion of her body was now solid granite.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that will be quite enough of that,&quot; Merlin said sternly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed,&quot; Gregor said whimsically. &quot;Tell me Merlin, how have you been my old friend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gregor is that you?&quot; Merlin gaped. &quot;You old coot how are you I haven&#39;t seen you in ages.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Neither have i my old friend,&quot; Gregor said with a smile. &quot;We all thought you were dead buried but I had my suspicions. I should have know that the man that taught me everything I know wouldn&#39;t let a little thing like mortality get in his way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What can I say,&quot; Merlin said with a smile. &quot;I was growing tired of the mundane approach of the council. Always so cautious in the way they handle magic. Shame really, magic is something to be shared and cherished not hidden away only for those they deem worthy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I couldn&#39;t agree more,&quot; Gregor added. &quot;Still  you seem to have had some problems today with a couple of your protégés today.&quot; Merlin toward to Katie and her friends who had looks of fear and confusion on their faces. &quot;Perhaps,&quot; he said stoically. &quot;However today was the first time I was able to properly meet them so I believe the problem is being handled.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gregor nodded and smiled. &quot;Let me summize multi dimensional travel.&quot; Merlin laughed and smiled. &quot;Guilty,&quot; he shrugged. The two wizards now laughed softly bewildering the others. &quot;I can assure you my old friend I will be making an effort to assist Katie, her friends, and my new apprentice in their magical journey.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well my friend you have never let me down so I will trust your word,&quot; Gregor said. &quot;As far as your protégés are concerned I do hope we get another chance to make a first impression some day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do as well,&quot; Merlin said. &quot;For now I should probably take them back to my shop.&quot; Gregor nodded and turned. &quot;I believe that would be for the best. Just one thing though, do you think you could help poor Kei out. She may have a bit of a temper but she is one of the good ones.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Merlin said and with a thought Kei&#39;s lower body once more became flesh. &quot;I hope we can all meet under better circumstances one day for now take care.&quot;<br />
<br />
Merlin, Katie and her friends entered the car and drove off without a word as Gregor smiled. Kei and Lisa stood dumbfounded staring at Gregor. Gregor just smiled, it had been far too long since he had seen his mentor and friend.</p>
