<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Mmph. I really don&#39;t know why you thought I&#39;d be into <i>this</i>...&quot; Danielle pretended to pout. &quot;But... I am...&quot; <i>Turned on.</i> &quot;...Curious.&quot; She put her other hand on the genie&#39;s. &quot;Could we... look around? Not as... &#39;ghosts&#39; though. I&#39;d like... to see what it&#39;s like as a... beastwoman.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sex pet a little too much for you?&quot; The genie laughed. &quot;Ah well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; Danielle pulled back, mortified and a little angry. &quot;Did you bring me here for that specific reason!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really, though I was -- curious, about how you&#39;d react.&quot; She shrugged. &quot;Mostly this was just the closest dimension with cultural femsub and polyamory. So, any preferences on species?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh...&quot; Danielle shook off her upset with the genie and looked out at the street. From the buff human-owning wolf to a ctue jackal couple to a trio of vixens laughing together and wagging their tails. &quot;Something... canine? Maybe foxy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gotcha.&quot; The genie snapped her fingers, and a wave of warmth swept over Danielle, bringing with it fur and additional adjustments to her posture. While her height didn&#39;t change, her legs and torso changed to accommodate her paws in a digitigrade stance.<br />
<br />
Her blouse, skirt and bra merged into a latex suit, simple red with gold contour lines, leaving only her fingers, paws and head bare. Her panties extruded through a hole at her crotch, forming into a thin plastic mold over her mound that also merged with her suit. Beneath the suit, Danielle knew instinctively that her fur was off-white on her front, a pale beige on her back and flanks, shading to white on her hands and paws.<br />
<br />
Claws and pads developed on her hands to match her feet; a sharp little muzzle pushed out, fusing her nose with her jaws. Her ears migrated to the top of her head, becoming fluffy, pointed, and rather large. Her hair grew a little longer, taking on more brown, while her irises turned amber and her pupils became tapered. Finally another hole opened in the back of the bodysuit, allowing a long, foxy brush to slip out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bleh.&quot; Danielle let her tongue loll out, feeling the extra length and flexibility, the sharpness of her new teeth against it. <i>So strange.</i> Pulling it back in, she was about to ask the genie what she&#39;d become, when she noticed the genie also changing.<br />
<br />
Her harem garb was flowing together into a black bodysuit, adorned with gold and silver lines, and thin half-cups of plastic around her lower breasts, while a heart-shaped keyhole showed off the dark grey fur of her cleavage. She was now several inches taller -- almost towering over Danielle now -- her digitigrade feet sheathed in rubber boots. Her head was a black wolf&#39;s muzzle, her lustrous hair now falling all the way to her tail. Her eyes were a bright, pale gold.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wooow.&quot; Danielle drank in the curvy, statuesque predator. Her hesitation over admiring the furry form was gone, maybe because she was one herself now? Either way, she found herself exclaiming &quot;You&#39;re beautiful!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks. You&#39;re a cutie yourself.&quot; The genie grinned nad patted Danielle&#39;s head.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-Hey!&quot; Danielle giggled as she fended off the gesture. For a moment she was distracted from how horny she felt by a swell of wonder at being so short, together with her own furry transformation. It was strange -- she really had not expected to enjoy her own wish so much, especially outside of sex. But there was something... <i>right</i> about being so short, as if it had always been meant for her, together with her busty bust and thick hips.<br />
<br />
The feel of latex against her fur -- that was a bit more exotic, but amazing. She could definitely get used to it. Her ears twitched to an expanded range of sounds; her tail swayed to keep her balanced. Despite her small frame, there was a sense of power in her digitigrade pose, in the knowledge that -- though they might be small and cute relative to the genie&#39;s -- she did have fangs and claws of her own.<br />
<br />
&quot;What am I, exactly?&quot; she asked, looking at the pads at the tips of her fingers.<br />
<br />
&quot;A kit fox. Native to the American southwest -- on Earth -- and similar to the fennec, but with bigger tails and smaller ears relative to their body. Also bigger over-all, not that that matters here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; Mentioning her tail, Danielle looked over her shoulder at the long, fluffy, black-tipped appendage, and gave it an experimental wag. The genie laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;One thing about these suits... this should open up.&quot; The genie leaned forward, and pushed a pair of discreet buttons on the sides of Danielle&#39;s crotch piece. The plastic mold loosened and popped off, leaving the vixen&#39;s labia exposed. &quot;Still wet, I see.&quot; Danielle blushed at the teasing observation. &quot;It&#39;s designed for easy access to the bathroom... but mostly for sex.<br />
<br />
&quot;As a matter of fact, these suits were made to show off the female form and give males &#39;easy access&#39;... but then they were adopted by submissive males as well. And now in some places -- like Talastae -- they&#39;ve just become part of general fashion.&quot;<br />
<br />
The wolf-genie pressed the thin mold back into place, a slight hiss of air escaping as it sealed snugly to Danielle folds, making the kit fox moan softly at the intimate touch. Then the wolfess straightened back up, giving the flustered vixen an encouraging smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready to go? Don&#39;t forget that.&quot; She pointed to the lamp, sitting atop a suitcase. &quot;The rest of our stuff we can leave here, phantasmal, but I can&#39;t go more than a few yards from that thing and can&#39;t move it myself. Here...&quot;<br />
<br />
She conjured a large handbag, and gave it to Danielle. The vixen picked up the lamp, and was struck by how much this object had changed her life. For a moment she had doubts -- here she was, a woman, a furry, on an alien world in a different dimension.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is something wrong, mistress?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So much has changed... so quickly...&quot;<br />
<br />
The genie put a hand on her shoulder. &quot;You still have that third wish. Say the word and you&#39;ll be back to being Damon in your old apartment. Just don&#39;t lose that lamp -- if it falls into someone else&#39;s hands, I&#39;ll be their slave, not yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danielle looked up. &quot;Slave?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yeah. What else would you call it? C&#39;mon. You can worry about me later -- let&#39;s go explore the city.&quot;<br />
<br />
The genie took her hand again, and gently led Dnaielle out of the alley into the street.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, one last thing,&quot; whispered the genie. She squeezed the vixen&#39;s hand, and Danielle felt a moment of dizziness. When her head cleared, she realised many of the lights were actually signs, which she could now read.<br />
<br />
&quot;Some basic knowledge of the world. Now let&#39;s go!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tbey seemed to be in a commercial district, the glowing signs proclaiming different shops, restaurants, clubs and -- to Danielle&#39;s abashment -- a brothel.<br />
<br />
&quot;It should be obvious,&quot; the genie pointed out, chuckling at Danielle&#39;s expression, &quot;but most nations on Arle don&#39;t have a problem with sex. Brothels are just another place of entertainment. And you&#39;d be surprised, even with polyamory, how much business they get.&quot;<br />
<br />
They walked out from the tall buildings into a lush park. It was huge to Danielle, with numerous trees and even a small lake separating them from the distant city lights on the other side. The glare faded as they entered the shade of the alien trees, Danielle&#39;s eyes adjusting smoothly to the darkness.<br />
<br />
Coming towards them, she saw -- and heard -- a coyote girl talking animatedly to a human girl, who was carrying an electric lantern in one hand and her leash in the other. It made Danielle realise that she had barely noticed the lack of light here. As they approached each other, the human was the first to notice Danielle and the transformed genie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mistress,&quot; the human said, indicating them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot; The coyote started, then smiled as the two passed. &quot;Good evening.&quot; Then the coyote and her pet went back to talking as they walked on towards the sidewalk surrounding the park. Danielle looked after them, bemused. Like all the other humans she&#39;d seen, the girl was naked; and as she walked away Danielle noticed she had a pair of tattoos on her left buttcheek -- a fancy &#39;R&#39;* surmounted by a crown, and a cute outline of a heart underneath it.<br />
<br />
(*&quot;R&quot; as in the Talastian equivalent.)<br />
<br />
&quot;Slave,&quot; she muttered to herself, remembering what the genie had said. &quot;They seemed so... natural.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what did you expect? Like I said, humans are kept for companionship. Their rights are curtailed, but that doesn&#39;t prevent friendships from developing. Humans have their own &#39;pet communities&#39; on the Virtua -- this world&#39;s internet -- and plenty of masters entrust day to day affairs to them. In Talastae, as in most countries of the Old World, humans can even own personal property. Take it from me -- it&#39;s a much nicer form of slavery than many you can find on Earth, even in your day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm.&quot; Danielle didn&#39;t know what to make of that, but wasn&#39;t interested in discussing Earth right now. &quot;What were those marks on her butt?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Those indicate her owner. A couple places still brand their humans, but civilised nations consider that cruel and use tattoos instead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh.&quot; Danielle shivered. &quot;That <i>is</i> cruel.&quot; The genie petted her soothingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Branding is a dying memory, from when the beastfolk first turned the tables on their human masters. There&#39;s been a lot of progress since then. Most humans are happy -- proud even -- to bear their master&#39;s mark. Nowadays it&#39;s seen as belonging to a loving home.&quot;<br />
<br />
She paused, then explained, &quot;The &#39;R&#39; stands for Regal&#39;s, a major pet chain, where the girl was bred, raised and trained. The heart is the coyote&#39;s own personal mark. Which reminds me, we need to set you up with one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not going to get any humans as pets!&quot; protested Danielle.<br />
<br />
&quot;You might change your mind,&quot; teased the genie. &quot;But they&#39;re for more than that. They&#39;re a legal identifier, like your signature.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like a personal seal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, exactly.&quot;<br />
<br />
They walked on. Coming to the lake, they followed a path beside it. Danielle was surprised to see people out boating, or trotting along the paths around them. Her sensitive ears also caught quite a few low moans and amorous growls coming from the shadier parts of the park.<br />
<br />
&quot;This place is busy for it being so late,&quot; she murmured. The sounds of love-making brought back her own arousal, forgotten for a moment in the strangeness of the new world.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cats and canids tend to be nocturnal, mistress. So it&#39;s not &#39;late&#39; for our biological clocks. Also, smells like someone is getting excited again. Don&#39;t look now, but temptation is headed our way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danielle turned her head from the wolfess, to feel a stab of fear and excitement: two male foxes were jogging along the lakeside path towards them. One, a tall, somewhat broad guy with the typical white, auburn and black markings of a red fox, wore only tight black leather pants and codpiece, letting the dim light play across his sculpted chest and abs.<br />
<br />
The other was shorter, probably only 5&#39;6&quot;, with a fennec&#39;s short muzzle, large ears and black-tipped tail. He was wearing a sleek brown latex suit, cut away to show the cream fur over his sixpack; but he exuded as much confidence and power as his taller friend. His codpiece was also fairly elaborate, black and gold with white lightning bolts excised into the glossy plastic surface.<br />
<br />
&quot;Evening ladies,&quot; the taller fox greeted as they drew near. &quot;Haven&#39;t seen you here before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re pretty stacked, short stuff,&quot; the fennec observed. &quot;Want to find a bench somewhere and have some fun?&quot;<br />
<br />
Danielle stared, speechless and blushing hard enough it could be seen through her fur. The genie laughed, pulling her close in a protective half-hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, dude, slow down! Yeah; we&#39;re on vacation from Clarette, and my friend here isn&#39;t used to how things are in Talastae yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww. Shy huh? I think that&#39;s cute.&quot; The fennec leaned down towards the shorter vixen, eyes bright and nose quivering as he drank in Danielle&#39;s aroused scent.<br />
<br />
Her stomach fluttered and she lowered her eyes and ears. <i>Oh Hell... I can feel it...</i> As embarrassed as she was, she already felt a strong desire to submit herself to the forward fennec. And she knew that he knew! He knew how powerless she was, or would be without her friend -- er, the genie -- to look after her. That just made her even hornier. Feeling weak, she leaned into the wolfess.<br />
<br />
The red fox smacked his friend lightly on the shoulder. &quot;Down, boy,&quot; he laughed. &quot;Please forgive him, miss, he means well. Here in Talastae sex is pretty casual. To be honest, I wouldn&#39;t mind showing you the ropes myself, if you don&#39;t already have a man -- you look beautiful and smell better. But no pressure. My name&#39;s Mikhael, by the way; this is Polyander.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just Ander to my friends.&quot; The fennec winked. &quot;And playmates.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lizelle,&quot; said the genie. &quot;And my &#39;shy&#39; friend here is Danielle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;P-Pleased to meet you.... boys,&quot; Danielle managed, looking up through her lashes. <i>Oh my God, this is great!</i> The way she felt as the lustful males eyed her! Helpless, exposed, desired...! <i>This is just what I wanted... BETTER than what I wanted!</i> She shifted in delightful discomfort, the sealed waterproof suit forcing her fluids to soak up her belly and down her leg fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;The pleasure is ours,&quot; responded Mikhael, his tail wagging. &quot;Your names are as beautiful as you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Flatterer,&quot; teased the genie.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s a red,&quot; needled the fennec with good humour. &quot;Flattery is their native tongue.&quot; Mikhael laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;True enough. So, are you part of a household, or free?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Free,&quot; answered the genie. &quot;But we aren&#39;t looking for sex at the moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure?&quot; asked Ander. &quot;Little Danielle certainly seems in the mood.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mikhael smacked him again, and Ander shoved him back with a chuckle. &quot;What? You&#39;ve got a nose too!&quot; The genie added her own snicker, but Danielle heard her voice in her mind.<br />
<br />
<i>-What do you think? Wanna give in to those urges and let randy Andy have his way with you? They&#39;re good todds -- you&#39;ve got nothing to fear from a little fun. You might even like being part of their harem. Or should I send them on their way? I&#39;m hungry -- for food -- myself, but you&#39;re the boss. For now, you cute little sub.-</i><br />
<br />
Danielle huddled into the genie and clasped her hands behind her, anxious lest she start fondling herself. Her nipples were painfully erect, completely visible through the tight latex. &quot;Um...&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>Gosh...</i> Her body wanted it so bad, but Danielle wasn&#39;t sure -- she hadn&#39;t even made up her mind she wanted to stay in this world! And it was all happening so fast...! Besides it was... kind of hot to try to resist her slutty urges... To hold out as long as possible before surrendering to the needy vixen she had become.<br />
<br />
&quot;The big city&#39;s definitely got her excited,&quot; the genie temporised as Danielle debated with herself. &quot;But she is still a virgin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Mikhael raised an eyebrow. &quot;Clarette must be more, mm, old-fashioned than I thought.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; The fennec tilted his head, his tone becoming a bit more gentle. &quot;Sorry cutie, I figured someone with your looks would have lots of experience by now. But I&#39;d be honoured to be your first -- promise I&#39;ll go easy.&quot;</p>
<hr/><h3>
How does Danielle respond to her desires?</h3>
