<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The very pregnant goddess storms over to the pile of sweaty bodies accumulated in the back of the room. One by one she picks up and tosses away each of the girls peeled onto the body of her target, the Dead Man, James. Finally, she grabs the demigod by the collar of his shirt as he tries to compose some argument to save his ass from certain destruction. But the ex-nerd just stumbles over his words as she drags him across the floor. Emily picks him up with one arm and drops him onto Mr. Reynold&#39;s desk.<br />
<br />
She towers over him, and glares directly into his soul. &quot;Explain yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;E-E-Emily. Look I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn&#39;t mean to what? Have sex with me? Am I not attractive to you?&quot; She leans over, massive breasts inches away from his face. Ty can tell from his seat that whatever she&#39;s giving off must be terrifying but equally alluring. &quot;No you&#39;re beautiful. The most beautiful girl. Woman! The most beautiful woman I have ever seen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what didn&#39;t you mean to do James? Speak up!&quot; She slams her fist on the desk, leaving a dent on the metal with a crack of thunder. &quot;Look, we were both really horny that night at band camp.&quot; Theory confirmed. &quot;You were there and you looked amazing in the firelight. And I did come prepared. How was I supposed to know the condom would break?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn&#39;t matter if the condom broke, James. You could&#39;ve at least called me to know if I was okay. Or actually asked me out. You were supposed to be smart.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am smart but I was scared. Especially after we got back to school and there were...rumors of your condition. And then I saw you and you were starting to show. I was already a loser, but I had dreams and goals. Being a dad in high school would&#39;ve ruined that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well did you think about me at all? I&#39;m the one that has to have this baby. Sorry, big shot, babies!&quot; James&#39;s mouth drops to the floor at that revelation. &quot;I&#39;m the one who was getting teased and stared when I walked these halls. I had no one and you were worrying about your little scholarships and inventions.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily looks over at the girls still sore from their romp with the accused. &quot;And the second you got some attention, you went straight for almost every girl in this room except for me, the mother of your children. You were supposed to be different James!&quot; Emily starts to tear up in her rage. &quot;But you know what? No more fooling around. You are mine!&quot; And she kisses the smaller giant hard pressing him back down onto the desk. Ty can tell her wild energy is spreading across the room but before anyone can &#39;get down to business&#39; she yells back at the class. &quot;No! Just watch!&quot; Looks like her rage overpowers her hormones because all the other students try to do is crawl back into their seats and try to redress themselves.<br />
<br />
She goes back to kissing James and after a bit he can&#39;t resist and starts to get into it too. Emily keeps trying to lay him back on the desk but her massive belly is making it awkward. With a low growl, Hercules takes over and flips his woman over so he has her against the desk. He uses his super strength to lift her up in his arms and place her gently on top. James leaps up on top as well, crouches down on top of her legs and unbuckles his jeans, letting his manhood flop out and drip over her toes. With each drop that touches her skin, Hera trembles with thirst. He reaches for the hem of her toga and starts to slide it up her body, letting his hands linger over her shapely legs. It&#39;s obvious what&#39;s about to happen but the class can&#39;t look away, for they have been commanded to by a goddess. As for Ty, well he&#39;s just kind of sick.<br />
<br />
Hercules finally gets the toga over to her hips and tosses it over her belly so he can see it in its full glory for the first time. &quot;So I did this to you? Your going to have my baby... babies? And there they are?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course&quot; says Emily, her face soft with no traces of the maelstrom from earlier. &quot;You were my first.&quot; James places a trail of hot kisses along her ginormous belly. &quot;And second, and third, and fourth...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah it was a fun few weeks. But remember, there is no coming back. We are together, now and forever.&quot; James places his hands on her 4-foot wide hips to get ready. &quot;And if I refuse?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I snap your head off your shoulders with my knees.&quot; James checks his landing strip on final time and lines himself up with her. &quot;Like you could touch your knees.&quot; And then he plunges deep within her in one loud slam.  Emily can&#39;t move much on her back but her cries can probably be heard all over the school. With every thrust the desk squeaks and shakes until it finally gives under weight if the two and breaks. But it doesn&#39;t slow down Hercules. He keeps going faster and faster until he could swear his lady&#39;s eyes were glowing pure white. And they were. Hera&#39;s magic is starting to work.<br />
<br />
Slowly and unbeknownst to the lovers, their bodies begin to float off the worn desk. From outside the classroom window, the clouds begin to darken. As they both get closer and closer to climax, a white glow starts envelope the pair. The clouds outside become dark gray amd wind and rain start to come down heavily onto the school. And then suddenly James bellows &quot;AAH-AHH-AAAAAAAGH!&quot; and a bolt of lightening crashes through the window and strikes the floating couple, enveloping them in bright white light. Thunder can be heard off in the distance.<br />
<br />
The storm dissapates as the light lowers back onto the table. The glow fades away and the couple reappears cuddling on the desk. Ty is the only one to get up and approach the couple. Emily is still as big and beautiful as before but James has drastically changed. He has grown larger than now, about half a foot taller, and has grown substantially more muscular. He also has on a toga, dark gray, but it only has one strap, revealing his massive chest muscles. His face is more or less the same, with only changes being piercing blue eyes and a light beard growing on his face. What gives away the reason for his change is the small tendrils of lightning coursing over body. James is no longer Hercules: he is Zeus, God of Thunder and King of the Gods. Ty thinks to himself, &quot;Whoa. I guess since Hera can only have one mate, whoever it is must be Zeus.&quot;<br />
<br />
Quickly before the Royal Couple does anything else, Ty makes himself completely immune to all the powers of the Gods.</p>
