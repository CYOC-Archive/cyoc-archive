“Hello boys,” William said when Nate and Eric walk back through the threshold. <br />
<br />
“Hey Dad, what are you doing home? No afternoon classes?” Nate asked, tossing his backpack onto the couch. Eric nods to his father once, and then heads upstairs, presumably to his room.<br />
<br />
“They’re still doing some construction, and classes got moved around. Unfortunately I don’t have a classroom for the afternoon, so I rescheduled class for tonight. And until then, I figured I might as well go home and relax.” William explained. <br />
<br />
“Was the damage really that bad?” Nate asked. Back when the Andersons first moved to Moon Lake, there was a bit of a fight between two students. The fight escalated as more people got involved, and in the end resulted in several broken walls, and more than a few arrests. The reason behind the feud was still a bit fuzzy, but the general consensus was that the two hot-headed male werebears got into it over something trivial. <br />
<br />
“As the Dean put it, the only thing more dangerous than a grizzly bear, is an angry werebear. Because, unlike animals, weres known exactly what they’re doing.” Williams said. <br />
<br />
“Unless they’ve just been made weres.” Nate adds. His father nods, remembering the insane amounts of lust and heat he felt after his first change. It was like someone set every nerve on fire, but not a painful fire. More like an aching fire, that needed to be put out with sex. Since then the fire had died down, though it was easy for it to return. <br />
<br />
“Have much homework? Anything I can help with?” William asked. <br />
<br />
“Not sure how good you are at solving functions and quadratic equations, but I think I’ll be okay with the rest. Mostly just worksheets, and I have to read a few more chapters of Beowulf.” Nate said. And that was one book he was sad to learn wasn’t actually about a wolf. Eric chewed him out the night he came home and commented on how he thought the book was about some European werewolf. <br />
<br />
“Sorry, that’s not my field.” William chuckled. Though both he and Martha were registered teachers, their combined knowledge of mathematics began and ended with 2+2=4. Which is why he taught English, not Calculus. And Martha taught third grade, where the only math you needed was addition, subtraction, and some multiplication and division. <br />
<br />
“What time will Mom be home?” Nate asked.<br />
<br />
“I’m not sure, she’s got a meeting after school. Why do you ask?”<br />
<br />
“Um, there’s something I want to ask you two.” Nate said, shifting nervously. He’d spent the car ride home deciding what would be the best way to ask his parents if he could spend a weekend with a complete stranger (at least to them). Nate was sure his parents would want to meet his “friend with benefits”, and they had every right to. <br />
<br />
“Really? In regards to what exactly?” William asked. He had a feeling it had to do with Nate’s night excursions. Again, he wasn’t upset at his son for not telling him and Martha, but seeing as this had been going on for at least a week it would be nice if Nate told them who this girl was. <br />
<br />
“Uh, Friday night.” <br />
<br />
“We’re having dinner with the Twists and the new neighbors.”<br />
<br />
“Ya, I mean afterwards.” Nate said, not looking up from the floor. He felt an uncomfortable heat rise to his cheeks, and his father’s eyes examining him. <br />
<br />
“I’m going to blow this,” he thought. <br />
<br />
“Alright, we’ll talk more about this when your mother comes home.” William said. Nate felt a weight leave his chest, and he quickly excused himself. As soon as he was in his bedroom, he breathed a sigh of relief. <br />
<br />
On the opposite side of the hall, Eric was lying in bed exchanging texts with Julie. She’s already started planning their next date, and grilling (no pun intended) Eric about what kinds of things he can cook. <br />
<br />
THE ONLY THNG I’M GOOD @ IS PASTA <br />
<br />
Eric wrote, and Julie replied even quicker.<br />
<br />
THAT WRKS 4 ME. U SHOULD COME OVR & TEACH ME<br />
<br />
Being himself, Eric didn’t quite understand why Julie asked him to teach her how to make pasta. Every teenagers has made Ramen at least once in their life. That’s essentially the same thing as linguine. Boil water, dump the pasta in it, but instead of adding a flavor packet, you add tomato sauce. <br />
<br />
SURE. WHEN? Eric asked, deciding not to think too much of the request. Julie’s response was sent the second he finished typing and hit send.  <br />
<br />
HOW BOUT FRIDAY? OR WILL U & UR MOM B BUSY?<br />
<br />
NO, BUT FAMILY IS HVING DINNER W/ TWISTS & NEW NEIGHBORS. <br />
<br />
Julie stared at her phone after reading that last bit. New neighbors? Did he mean Spencer and her family? <br />
<br />
Julie scolded herself for getting upset about that and told Eric that he’d have to make it up to her over the weekend. It was a little pushy, but Eric needed some pushing once in a while. Her mom had dropped her off at home and then went shopping. That left Julie free to run upstairs and take care of some of her pent up desire. It wasn’t anything like the real thing, but it was enough to keep her from doing anything stupid with Eric. <br />
<br />
She doubted that he knew she wasn’t a virgin. Julie had that “innocent, girl-next-door” look to her. She knew Eric was a virgin. He’d never been kissed before he started dating Julie, there was no way he would have had sex by now. <br />
<br />
Eric didn’t reply after Julie responded with her little teasing message. He didn’t think he needed to. What he did need to do was think. Julie was clearly in this for the long run. Which put a lot of pressure on him to make a decision, or a commitment. <br />
<br />
“We’re fourteen for crying out loud. Who the hell settles down when they’re fourteen?” he whispers to himself.</p>
