<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ian remembered the two guys kissing, he had passed them as he was changing and didn’t get a good look at one but he definitely recognized the other:  John, or Jane as the students often called him.  Just the thought of him made Ian cringe.  God made men and woman equal but separate and distinct and like most of his insolent kind John went out of his way to deny his manhood.  He wore his black and blue dyed hair down to his shoulders, frequently applied black nail polish and eye shadow and wore skinny jeans and scene shirts.  Before he came to their school, things were fine, but he forced the school into accepting his life choices and when that was no longer enough he started spreading his ways.  Other students started ‘coming out’ and dating, with John at the center of things, always bending over for a new guy.  Ian shook his head, this was his chance to fix things.<br />
Ian left through the nearest door and wasn’t surprised to find himself back in school, the day still not over.  He leaned calmly against the wall and waited for the bell outside the band room.  John was a sophomore he remembered in the school bad, what he played he didn’t remember but it wouldn’t matter anyway.  The bell sounded and sure enough, after everyone else had filed out John danced out, carrying his case.  He was decked out in his usual, supporting Escape the Fate of all things today.  Too bad he wouldn’t be escaping his fate today.  <br />
“Hey John, you wanna uh hang out for a bit before the next class?” Ian asked, trying hard to mask his disgust as John’s eyes lit up.  <br />
“Oh dear that sounds like fun Ian, lead the way!”  Ian inwardly sighed, he had just seen this guy kissing someone a few hours ago and now he was hitting on him full steam ahead.  Casual, abominable pleasure must be all that matters to him, what of true relationships?  One step at a time he reminded himself, keep it calm.  <br />
Ian led him to an ‘empty’ classroom and opened the door, smiling and ushering John it before following and closing the door.  A soft click as the door locked and the lights came on.  John found himself confused, surrounded by all of Ian’s new friends.  He turned around and was shocked to see Ian transforming.  Were they had once been the same height Ian was quickly gaining inches on him, his body developing and his clothes growing and changing to match, sandals covering his large feet and a beard growing over his face as his hair went blond and the change finished.  John was paralyzed by what he just witnessed, it would’ve been hot if he wasn’t so frightened.  The new man before him reached out a hand and touched his chest sending a painful shock through his body, making everything burn.  <br />
Soft tendrils of white flame consumed him.  The fire coursed through his body and mind.  His clothes were consumed in the blaze, reduced to nothingness in a flash of light.  The same light seared away the nail polish and eye liner and returned his hair to a plain brown as the color dripped out and evaporated.  As the flames licked his limbs he felt them extending out, pulled and stretched.    His arms were dragged out in front of him as if he was holding hands with someone who was yanking on his arms.  They unraveled into long thin, almost line like appendages.  The same happened to his legs, a feeling of flying as he elevated to an even six foot, his entire body lanky now.   <br />
His fingers bent, twitched and throbbed, moving on their own.  As they warped the skin, formerly almost feminine it was so soft and unused became rough, calloused.   His pretty little hands became almost to large for his body, brutish and tough,  The fingers weren’t just long but meaty and thick, the manly hands were covered in calluses and the knuckles bulged out, hair covered the back of his hand.  They were hideous hands to John’s mind.  Hair spewed out from the follicles over his arm, disgustingly manly hair, a dark brown, covering every available inch as the ghostly skin grew darker and muscles bulged out underneath.  His arms became thick, gorilla arms, ripped and cut.  <br />
Brown hairs also swirled across his formerly smooth pecs, circling his enlarged nipples as his chest pushed out, his upper body becoming exceptionally muscular compared to the rest of him.  His stomach was toned and flat but he lacked abs.  In his mind he knew that was because his upper body was all that mattered.  A hyper masculine personality overriding his own, telling him lifting weights was the way to go.  He tried to hold on to his sensitivity, his love for the male body but it was all being washed away in the flames.  He wanted a real relationship, later of course, with a proper woman that God would gift to him and he would raise a family with.  Going from guy to guy getting his brains fucked out was not proper.  A growing part of him was ashamed at how he used to behave and welcomed this chance to turn things around and redeem himself for even in punishment there is mercy.  The change spread downward though, sprinkling his legs with hair while causing them to grow a little thicker, but not nearly as ripped as his arms.  His feet pushed out, longer, wider and manlier like the rest of him.<br />
As John felt himself fading away completely his face changed, becoming square, masculine and jockish like the rest of his body.  His eyes a cool blue and his nose somewhat large.  His ears shrinking and getting closer to the sides of his head and his precious hair retreating back into his skull leaving just barely an inch.  His neck was less apparent but his Adams apple was quite large and jutted out, his voice down several octaves.<br />
Meanwhile John still struggled in his head, he liked sports, no, he liked scene music, fashion, design… and sports.  Football, weight lifting, he was remembering now.  Yes, he had always loved football and he was thrilled when Tim made the NFL, he was a true hero and inspiration to him.  Not an idol of course, that was sacrilege but Tim was a true inspiration on how he could pour his love for God into everything he did. <br />
To finish the change a tight white muscle shirt appeared on him along with more appropriate jeans.  Some large nikes appeared on his feet and a cross necklace like Ian’s appeared as his case changed.  John was now an 18 year old, Christian jock and bass player for Understanding the Infinite.  His new white and grey 4 string bass appeared in his hands and he started playing, a complete natural, nodding his head and swinging to the sweet grooves God was great enough to let him play now in His name.  He smiled at Ian and the others thanking him for freeing him.</p>
