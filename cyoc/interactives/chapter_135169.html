<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kellie sat back as the girls talked with Mary Elise and Karen. Thankfully the girls were making progress. While any hope of the girls being like sisters seemed a remote possibility they at least had come to an agreement to bury the hatchet and work together. <br />
<br />
“So I guess this is about as good as it going to get,” Karen sighed. “We look out for each other and won’t use the rings on one another.”<br />
<br />
“Sounds fair,” Claudia said. “Although Mary...I would like for us to get together again sometime soon. We...we were really good friends for years. After all this maybe....maybe we could start slow and see where things go.”<br />
<br />
“I’d like that,” Mary smirked. As the girls nodded in agreement Mary Elise now began scanning the room. “Hey where are Lisa and Kumiko?”<br />
<br />
The others now started scanning the room as well, surprised that the two rebellious teens were no where to be found. Mary Elise frowned as she turned to Kellie. “You know if this is going to work everyone needs to be on board,” she frowned. “If you know where they are you need to tell us.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know where they are,” Kellie pleaded. “I’m just as surprised as you. Maybe the other Katie knows.” Kellie now began scanning the room for her daughter, surprised that she too was missing. “Now where did she go?”<br />
<br />
Before any of them could answer they saw Alt Katie open the back door with Lisa and Kumiko in tow. “Sorry,” she smiled. “I kind of needed these two for something important.” The others gave Lisa and Kumiko a curious look as they entered the house. Mary Elise frowned as the two girls slowly approached.<br />
<br />
“Mary listen,” Lisa said solemnly. “I....I know we’ve never really gotten along. I’m....I’m a bit of a hothead, I get that but...but I want things to work out between all of us.” Mary Elise gave the two a critical look, surprised at the humble expressions on their faces. “What are you two up too,” she grumbled.<br />
<br />
“Nothing,” Kumiko said quietly. “We...we had an opportunity to see....what things would be like if we were all friends. It’s a good thing, it’s...it’s something I never knew I wanted but...it’s something that I want to work towards.” <br />
<br />
Mary Elise snorted as she looked at the two. Lisa and Kumiko had always been the two biggest thorns in her side. The girls were popular, pretty and always happy..a total opposite of herself. She had hated the girls for so long she didn’t know how to talk with either one of them. The idea that these two wanted to change seemed totally foreign to her. Shaking her head she glared at the two teens. “I don’t believe you,” she spat. “Your up to something I just know it.”<br />
<br />
“Their not,”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise paused as she heard the voice, looking past her two rivals she could see two adults staring back at her. “Who are you too?”<br />
<br />
Lisa turned, smiling at her adult self. “Those two are us,” she smiled. “They kind of had a heart to heart with us. Made us realize that all this fighting we’ve been doing for years is just pointless. It’s time for us to grow up.”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise snorted as she looked at the two adults. “Yeah right,” she grumbled. “It’s just another trick. That other version of Katie just brought in a couple of adults to make you think it was your future selves. Their actors or something.”<br />
<br />
Adult Lisa and Kumiko turned, chuckling softly to one another before turning to Mary Elise. “We had a feeling you would probably think that,” Lisa laughed. “Our Mary is probably the smartest girl we’ve ever known. She probably would think the same thing.”<br />
<br />
“That’s why we need your Katie’s help,” Kumiko stated. Katie stepped in between her sister and Kumiko as she looked at the two adults. “What do you need me to do,” she asked.<br />
<br />
Adult Lisa and Kumiko sighed as they looked down at the Ring of Age.”Well,” Lisa said. “We kind of need you to make us 16 like your sister and Kumi. If Mary Elise sees that..well...we really are just another version of them maybe she’ll believe these two are willing to change.”<br />
<br />
Katie gaped at the two adults before looking down at her ring. “Are you sure about this,” she asked. “No,” Kumiko groaned. “But we hope it might help. Just...just make sure you change our clothes with us...and change us back before we leave. I don’t think either of our husbands would be thrilled to have underage wives.”<br />
<br />
Katie nodded as she now wished adult Lisa and Kumiko to become physically 16 years old. Lisa and Kumiko felt the familiar chill envelope their bodies as they began the decent back to 16.<br />
<br />
Mary Elise watched in awe as the two adults began to grow younger before her eyes. She had yet to see Katie’s ring in action, having only heard stories. As she watched she could see the two adults faces become fresher and more youthful. As they reentered their 20s she could see that the slight weight the two had put on began to vanish from their bodies leaving the two 25 year olds with firm bodies possessing luscious, adult curves. As they crept into their early 20s Mary Elise could see their faces become even more youthful an innocent. The college coeds smiled as their skin glowed with energy while their curves began to diminish.<br />
<br />
Exiting their 20s and becoming teens once more Mary Elise could see Lisa and Kumikos curves diminish even more. Soon two girls slightly older than herself stood before her. Gone were the middle age adults instead replaced by teens with lean bodies and smaller, perkier breasts. As the two adults crept backwards to 16 Mary Elise watched as the two adults shrank slightly while their breasts became smaller. When the two adults finally completed their regression Mary Elise was astonished. The two adults were now the mirror image of the Lisa and Kumiko she knew.<br />
<br />
Adult Lisa and Kumiko glanced into a nearby mirror examining their teenage appearance. “So Mary,” Lisa stated. “As you can see we ARE just other versions of the Lisa and Kumi you know.” Mary Elise, Lisa and Kumiko gawked at the two grown down doppelgängers before them. <br />
<br />
“So...So it is true then,” Mary Elise whispered as she looked at her two rivals. “They are just grown u versions of you.” Teen Lisa and Kumiko nodded as they faced their rival. “Yeah they are,” Kumiko said. “They showed us what we have to look forward to if we can only get along. So what do you say Mary, want to talk and Smith things out?”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise stared dumbfounded as Lisa and Kumiko extended their hands in a token of peace. Still slightly unsure of what to make of it she shook her head before sighing. “What the hell,” she sighed, taking their hands. “I guess it never hurts to talk.”</p>
