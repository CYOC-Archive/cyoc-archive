<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Allen and Ty were walking through the school hallway after the final bell had rung, carrying their backpacks over their shoulders while they were talking about the upcoming weekend.<br />
<br />
“So, what are your plans for the weekend, dude?” Ty asked Allen, the captain of the swim team who had slowly become one of Ty’s best friends in school.<br />
<br />
“Well, my uncle manages the Golden Plate Gym down the street from your house. They have a Body Building competition there, and I’m supposed to be there and to usher the public in the room. They’ll have a stage and a catwalk, where the muscle guys are supposed to show off their guns! It’ll be fun!” Allen responded cheerfully.<br />
<br />
“At the gym? Oh my goodness, Peter is going to have fun when you’re there! Sounds like he’ll be growing muscle all weekend! Heheheh…” Ty chuckled, as he tried to imagine what Peter would go through when Allen would be at the gym.<br />
<br />
“I actually wanted to go camping tonight… What’s Peter doing this weekend?” Allen wondered.<br />
<br />
“He’ll be doing whatever you want him to do, Allen! You got total control over his life, you know! You decide!” Ty replied in a matter-of-fact tone of voice. “Why don’t you take him with you? I mean, you can change him into anything and you can make him do whatever you want to… Besides, it’s good for Peter to get away from the computer and out of the house for a change!”<br />
<br />
“Awesome idea, Ty! I’ll do it!” Allen chuckled. <br />
<br />
“How about I meet you at the gym tomorrow?” Ty asked him. Allen just winked back and gave thumbs-up signal.<br />
<br />
Both boys then said goodbye as they parted ways while they walked home. Allen only lived two blocks away from Peter and Ty, so it was a short walk home.<br />
<br />
Allen went home and emptied the books out of his backpack. He then grabbed some clothes to wear that night, and stuffed them into his empty bag. He saw the tent and his blanket, but realized that the tent was just too much to carry. “I don’t need the tent,” he thought to himself, “I got Peter and Peter can be anything I want!”<br />
<br />
When he was all packed and ready to go, he grabbed his bike out of the garage and he placed the backpack over his shoulder. Before he started to pedal away, he closed his eyes and concentrated on Peter.<br />
<br />
Peter was in his bedroom doing homework when he suddenly heard Allen’s voice ring through his ears.<br />
<br />
“Peter? What are you doing? Homework on Friday afternoon? No way!” Allen said. Peter glanced back at his homework, not realizing that Allen could see and hear everything that he could see and hear.<br />
<br />
“History? No, no, no, Peter… You can study for that on Sunday night! I’ll help you with that; so don’t worry!” Allen continued. “Forget the homework, I want you to go camping with me, and then we’ll go to the gym tomorrow! Sounds cool?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I guess…” Peter replied, feeling kind of funny that he was talking to himself.<br />
<br />
“Here, let me take over. I’m going to make you run to my house. Then we’ll go camping. So just hang tight, I’m taking over your body!” Allen said next.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Peter gasped as he lost control over his arms and legs. He got up, ran down the stairs, and dashed out the door. He stopped by the mailbox for a moment, while Allen was getting a drink from his water bottle. Peter stood there, waiting for Allen’s commands, when he suddenly jumped up and bounced on the balls of his toes twice, before jogging to Allen’s house. An invisible force took over his legs and his arms, and he ran as fast as he could.<br />
<br />
“Where… am… I… going?” he said, as he continued to run, not knowing where his body was taking him.<br />
<br />
“Peter, I’ll take care of you, so don’t worry. I live two blocks away from you! You’ve never been to my house before, so no sweat. I’m waiting outside, sitting on my bike! Turn right over here, Peter!” Allen instructed.<br />
<br />
Peter immediately made a right turn into another side street where he saw Allen waiting patiently on his bike. When Peter got close enough to him, he began to slow down, until he came to a complete stop just next to Allen. Allen allowed Peter to catch his breath, before moving on.<br />
<br />
“Where are we going?” Peter asked Allen, as soon as he caught his breath.<br />
<br />
“Let’s go to a park, just four blocks away. It’s kind of cold out now... Hmm… You need something against the cold and you need to be able to run faster than that, Peter! How about this: I want you to change into a Siberian husky!” Allen commanded.<br />
<br />
Peter suddenly started to grow a thick coat of black and white fur all over! His ears shifted to pointy ears on top of his head, while his mouth began to stretch out like a muzzle. His nose shifted to the end of the muzzle, as thick hair spread all over his body. Within moments, Peter was now shrinking while a long, furry tail began to form on the end of his spine. His clothes disappeared, as his fingers and toes turned into paws. Suddenly, Peter was on all fours, he was now a Siberian husky with black and white colored coating of hair all over him.<br />
<br />
“Arf Arf!” Peter barked, as he looked up at Allen, who was still sitting on the bike while he was enjoying Peter’s transformation.<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah, I had better give you the ability to talk, huh?” he said.<br />
<br />
“Thanks dude… I was about to howl at you! Hehe…” Peter replied, in the form of a dog.<br />
<br />
“Come on, boy! Let’s go to Piedmont Park, which is just down the road! Let’s go!” Allen ordered, as he began to peddle, with the husky following behind him.<br />
<br />
Allen peddled to the park while Peter ran after him. Luckily it was a Friday afternoon, and it was right before rush hour, so there was no traffic.<br />
<br />
When Allen got to the park, he quickly grabbed a large blanket out of the bag, which he spread out over the grass. Peter just sat on his back legs, standing on his front paws. <br />
<br />
“That was a fun little run eh, boy?” Allen said, while stroking the husky’s fur.<br />
<br />
“Yeah!” Peter replied, through his dog muzzle.<br />
<br />
“Well I got your clothes right here, Peter!” Allen said, as he grabbed the clothes out of a plastic bag. “I want you to change back to a human being again!”<br />
<br />
The husky began to rapidly lose his fur, as human skin started to form. Then the legs and torso began to grow, forcing the figure to stand on only his legs. As he grew taller, he began to resemble a human more and more, as finally Peter was back as a sixteen year-old teenager, standing 6 foot 3 inches tall. Allen immediately wished for Peter to have his clothes on, so he would not stand naked in the cold, dark grassy field in the middle of the park.<br />
<br />
“Welcome back, champ!” Allen chucked, as he grabbed a pan and two cans of soup out of his bag.<br />
<br />
“I haven’t been a dog in a long time…” Peter chuckled, as he sat down next to Allen on the edge of the blanket. Allen just poured the cans out in the large pan, and he then held it in front of Peter.<br />
<br />
“Alright, mighty Wizard, I want you to heat up my soup using your heat vision!” Allen whispered. Immediately two beams of read light came from Peter’s eyes, striking the soup in the pan and heating it up instantly! After a few seconds, Peter stopped using his heat vision when he noticed that the soup was boiling. “This is vegetable soup! You want some?”<br />
<br />
Allen then looked through his bag.<br />
<br />
“Rats, I forgot to bring spoons and bowls!” he mumbled out loud.<br />
<br />
“Hey I see some branches lying on the grass over there! I’ll take care of it!” Peter replied, while pointing at a pile of fallen tree branches which were just a few yards away.<br />
<br />
Peter extended his right arm, just as the branches started to levitate in the air, floating right into his hand. Then Peter set them down before him and concentrated. The pieces of wood changed shape, where two small branches turned into wooden spoons and the longer ones became round and deep until the formed the shape of two wooden bowls.<br />
<br />
“Wow! That’s amazing! Golly, Peter! You’re more powerful than I thought!” Allen gasped, as he watched the transformation occur on the grass before him.<br />
<br />
Allen then extended his arms and placed them on Peter’s shoulders. <br />
<br />
“Dude, from now on, whenever I’m going anywhere, I want you with me! Goodness, that is so awesome, to know a guy like you who can do anything! You’re practically omnipotent!” Allen exclaimed, while Peter just grinned back.<br />
<br />
Allen and Peter then sat on the blanket with their legs crossed before them, as they both sipped their hot soup. It was delicious, and it was just the right temperature, not too hot or too cold.<br />
<br />
“Peter, you got to tell me how you got your powers, dude. Didn’t you freak out when you first noticed you had this incredible gift?” Allen wondered, while Peter was still having some soup.<br />
<br />
“I didn’t freak out, but my parents and my older sister for sure did! Here I was, the little brat in the house, and I was performing these magic tricks. Oh, it was loads of fun!” the Wizard replied. “When I first became psychic, I would levitate my cup or my fork or spoon while we had dinner at the table one night, just like magic…”<br />
<br />
Peter told Allen the story about how he got his powers (you will hear the story as well, in the near future!) and they often stopped to chuckle or laugh about the funny events which took place when Peter first became a Wizard, when suddenly they noticed someone walking towards them, shining a bright light from a powerful flashlight in their faces.<br />
<br />
“Excuse me, gentlemen, but the park is closed after sundown! You must leave immediately!” the mysterious figure said.<br />
<br />
When Allen and Peter looked up, they noticed that it was a park ranger, dressed in his uniform, slacks and boots. He was armed and he was pointing the flashlight right at Allen’s face.<br />
<br />
“What’s the matter, Officer?” Allen asked out loud.<br />
<br />
“I smell something here. Have you been heating up some food?” the ranger asked him in a stern tone of voice.<br />
<br />
“Yes, well we heated up some soup, sir!”<br />
<br />
“Don’t you know that you can get a citation for lighting fires in the park? You’re not allowed to use fire to heat up food while you are on park grounds. I will have to give you a citation for $50 for violating that rule!” the ranger shouted, as he grabbed a booklet out of his back pocket.<br />
<br />
“We DIDN’T LIGHT ANY FIRES!” Allen shouted back at him.<br />
<br />
“How did you heat up your soup? With a microwave? There is no electricity out here, young man, so I will need to fine you for park endangerment which constitutes a fifty dollar fine, payable at the City Hall’s division of Parks and Recreation!” the ranger responded, while writing up the citation on his notepad.<br />
<br />
“My partner here used his heat vision to heat up the soup! He’s a Wizard! Honest, we’re telling the truth! We did NOT light any fires in the park!” Allen began to plead with the officer, as he tore off the sheet of paper and handed it to him.<br />
<br />
“You got ten minutes to pay that if not I’ll have to kick you out of the park!”<br />
<br />
“WHAT!?” Allen shouted out of pure shock. He then looked down at Peter, who was still sitting on the blanket, with a wide grin on his face.<br />
<br />
“Peter… Don’t just sit there… DO SOMETHING!” Allen shouted at him in frustration.<br />
<br />
Peter slowly got up and stood on his feet, towering over Allen by just a few inches. He just grinned as he continued to stare at the ranger, who was about to turn around and walk away. <br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, Allen. Watch this…” he chuckled.<br />
<br />
The tall, 6’6” park ranger was suddenly frozen in his tracks. He could no longer move, as he slowly started to shrink! His clothes began to fit very loose, as his legs, arms and torso began to regress. His mustache began to fade, as well as all the hair on his arms, chest and legs. As he began to shrink down, his long, ironed slacks began to wrinkle, as well as the neatly pressed buttoned shirt of his uniform. His sleeves were too long, as his arms began to shrink as well. Within moments, the park ranger, who could have been about forty years old, now looked like a teenager. As the shrinking continued, his slacks began to pile up, and his shirt was hanging too far down. First his underwear came down, and then the slacks fell of his reduced waist. His buttoned shirt was now much too big on him, as the ranger now appeared to be only six years old.<br />
<br />
“What’s happening? Oh my gosh… I’m SHRINKING!” he shouted, as he just couldn’t understand what Peter was doing to him.<br />
<br />
Peter and Allen just stood there and giggled, as the ranger continued to regress. Within moments, his face became all round as baby fat began to form on the short arms, legs and round face of the little baby boy.<br />
<br />
“No! This can’t be! I’m turning into a… WWWHHHAAAAA!!!! WWWHHHAAAAA!!!” the baby began to brawl, as it was trapped in a pile of clothes, which were now much too big for him. Peter then walked over to the little baby, which just sat there, on the grass. He gently unbuttoned the giant shirt, and he lifted the baby up, away from the pile of clothes. The baby was completely naked, so he wished for it to have a diaper on, and immediately the diaper formed around the little boy’s waist. For a moment the baby stopped crying, when it realized that it was being held up in the air by the tall, 6 foot 3 inch teenager, who now appeared to tower over him.<br />
<br />
“Hey, little baby ranger, how are you?” Peter said teasingly, holding the baby by the armpits. “When I grow you back, you will forget about the citation and you will forget you ever saw us, okay?”<br />
<br />
“Ranger Richard! Ranger Richard! Are you here?” a voice said off in the distance.<br />
<br />
“I guess they’re looking for you, Ranger Richard!” Peter grinned back at the helpless little baby who he was holding up in his hands.<br />
<br />
“Peter! Another ranger is looking for him! Grow him back!” Allen shouted back at Peter in panic.<br />
<br />
“Alright, alright… He’s already growing back, with his diaper on!” Peter chuckled, as he gently set the baby back down on the grass. When the little baby tilted his head up to look at the tall teenager, he almost began to cry again, but he held it in when he realized that he started to grow.<br />
<br />
The small baby began to age, as his arms, legs and torso started to grow once again. Within moments, the baby was able to stand up, and it got up on its feet. But the baby continued to grow, and it now resembled a little boy of about 5 years old. The boy was still wearing the diaper, because Peter wished for it to become stretchy, so that the poor ranger would not be caught in the park walking around in the nude. As the boy continued to age, he grew taller and slightly more muscular, when finally hair started to sprout on his chest, his legs and his arms. When he was a teen, he rushed through his growth spurt for the second time, shooting up to about 6 foot in height. Then his mustache started to grow back, and the hair on his arms and legs grew thicker as well. The young man now aged through the teens and passed twenty, then thirty, until it finally reached the age it had just moments before. <br />
<br />
Just at that moment another ranger came towards them, shining the flashlight in their faces.<br />
<br />
“Good Lord! Ranger Richard, is that you?” the other park ranger asked. He was astonished to find his 40 year-old ranger, standing in the park while wearing only his diaper!<br />
<br />
“It’s me, Sir… I don’t know what happened…” the poor ranger stuttered.<br />
<br />
“Where is your uniform, Richard? What is the meaning of this?” the ranger asked sternly.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know Sir! I have no idea what happened to me…”<br />
<br />
“Are those your clothes on the grass over there? Go ahead and grab them and meet me at my office, IMMEDIATELY!” the ranger shouted in a very angry tone of voice. Ranger Richard then grabbed his clothes and walked away. Allen and Peter just chuckled, as they just saved them selves from having to pay a fifty dollar fine for something they didn’t do.<br />
<br />
“God, Peter… That was AWESOME! You’re amazing!” Allen shouted, as the two boys gave each other high-fives in the air. “I wasn’t about to pay fifty dollars; NO WAY!”<br />
<br />
The two teens just gathered around and told stories about their magical experiences until early morning, when Allen finally wanted to get some sleep. When Allen was about to lie down, he told Peter that he wanted Peter to change into a thick, warm sleeping bag. In an instant, Peter became flat as a sheet and then stretched out to about 8 feet long and 4 feet wide. He then filled up on the inside with foam and liner, making him a perfect sleeping bag! Allen just took his shoes off and crawled inside of Peter, allowing Peter to keep him warm. Peter’s eyes, nose and mouth were on the top side of the sleeping bag, so he could still talk to Allen.<br />
<br />
“Are you nice and warm now?” Peter asked his partner, who had just placed his head on the pillow.<br />
<br />
“Peter, you make for the best sleeping bag I’ve ever had. Now I know for sure I’m going to take you with me, next time I go camping!” Allen said, with a chuckle.<br />
<br />
The two dozed off and slept through the night, with Peter being Allen’s sleeping bag. <br />
<br />
As soon as the sun was up, Allen was already awake. He crawled out of his sleeping bag, and he started to pack his things.<br />
<br />
“Wake up, you sleepyhead… Or should I say, you sleeping bag!” Allen shouted, as he noticed that Peter’s eyes were still closed. “I want you to change back to your human form again!”<br />
<br />
Immediately the sleeping bag began to flatten again, this time it was shrinking until it was just over six feet long and about two feet wide. Then the sleeping bag began to inflate, while the cover changed from cloth to human skin. Slowly but surely, Peter’s arms, legs and torso began to form out of the cloth; and the head began to form on top. Within moments, the sleeping bag was transformed into Peter!<br />
<br />
Peter was only wearing his shorts, while he stepped into his sandals.<br />
<br />
“No, no, Peter, you’re not going to the gym like this!” Allen said, while shaking his head.<br />
<br />
“Huh?”<br />
<br />
“Come on, Hercules, we’re going to my uncle’s gym! And I believe you got the first place prize in the bag! But you need to start bulking up now, and continue to grow in size and muscle, until we get there! You’ll stop growing when I tell you to stop!” Allen chuckled, as he got on his bike. “The gym is right down the street! How about we go for a jog?”<br />
<br />
Peter’s sandals immediately changed to running shoes, as Peter began to feel his body expand. His legs were bigger and thicker already, and so were his pectorals. His abdominal muscles were popping out of his torso, while his calves were bursting out of his legs. Within moments his chest had grown 30 inches wider, as he slowly began to transform into a bodybuilder.<br />
<br />
Then Allen started to peddle, with the muscular Peter jogging right behind him. And the two were just moments away from claiming their prize at the body building contest which took place at the gym that morning. <br />
<br />
Allen had a blast, for he knew that he would always take Peter camping with him. And Peter had fun, because he got to use his powers to help Allen, while Allen used his powers to help Peter as well.</p>
