<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The rest of the day was a little rough for Jen. It wasn't that her lessons and classwork were too hard; she was an intelligent enough girl that if she applied herself, she could do well in school. It wasn't so much that her classmates teased her about what had happened the day before with Kyle, either. A few of them made comments, but most of them avoided the topic, since his death was so fresh in their minds. In fact, they seemed much more bothered by the fact she wasn't openly crying about the loss of her one-time lover. What was so hard for her was not trying to seduce more people and bring them over to her side. Ever since that night with Ms. Davidson, she'd seen beauty in virtually everyone she looked at. Quite literaly, she was becoming the embodiment of lust.<br />
<br />
              She was eagerly awaiting cheerleading practice after school. She knew Cindy was expecting to become the squad leader. Jen had seen the delight on her face when she'd been caught the day before. Cindy had also been one of the few to actually mutter &quot;slut&quot; at Jen when they'd passed by each other in the hallway after second period. She and Cindy had hated each other for years, mostly due to cheerleading. Cindy was undeniably beautiful, with an exotic look and long red hair. Jen, however had more natural athletic ablility, and was more charismatic, which led to her getting the head cheerleader nod instead of Cindy. <br />
<br />
              It was this situation that was causing Jen to struggle internally. Much of her burned with a desire for revenge, and now she could do it. She could easily kill Cindy this afternoon, after cheerleading practice, and have a willing accomplice in Miss Jorgenson. By the same token, Cindy was gorgeous, and would be an undeniable asset to her army. Not to mention, given her new sexual openness, part of Jen was craving an encounter or two with Cindy.<br />
<br />
             The bell rang, signaling the end of sixth period. Her classes were over, and now it was time for practice. Jen made her way down to the girls' lockerroom, a smile on her face. She still wasn't sure what she was going to do, but Jen's body still burned and tingled in anticipation. One way or the other, the beast was going to be let out to play.<br />
<br />
              The five other girls were there already, changing into their practice gear. All of them looked uncomfortable as Jen walked in, except for Cindy, who had a smirk on her face. For a brief moment, Jen thought of simply burying her fingers inside herself and going berserk, simply to give in to the bloodlust.<br />
<br />
               Then, Miss Jorgenson came into the lockerroom. Jen noted that she didn't make a sound. In fact, none of the girls besides herself had even noticed her arrival. Jen then realized that the only reason she'd even noticed was due to the unholy bond they shared. They exchanged a smile, and Jen noticed that Miss Jorgenson's eyes were eagerly focused on Cindy's fragile and nubile form. Jen's eyes followed her gaze, appreciating Cindy's body on a new level.<br />
<br />
               Jen, now dressed, walked up to her. &quot;You like what you see?&quot; she whispered. Not really paying attention, Miss Jorgenson nodded, still focused on Cindy, who had bent over as she put on her shorts. Jen noticed that Miss Jorgenson's hand had begun to drift down to her crotch. &quot;NO!&quot; Jen hissed. &quot;Not right now. Get her into your office after practice, once the other girls have left.&quot; Miss Jorgenson nodded, smiling at Jen. Jen wondered if everyone she made would lose their souls as well, or if they were redeemable, unlike her. Then she found that she really didn't care. Their welfare was really of little consequence to her, let alone their afterlife.<br />
<br />
               As the girls finished dressing, they headed out onto the field for stretching and cheer practice. Practice went smoothly, though it ran a bit long, as Miss Jorgenson had given them some new routines to work on. Everyone but Jen was surprised, and a little bit confused, as these newer routines were blatantly sexual in nature, featuring the girls commonly crawling on all fours and grinding each other. They were also rather bothered by Miss Jorgenson's sudden approach to &quot;hands-on&quot; coaching, as she was almost eager to show any of them how she wanted the moves done, usually choosing Cindy as her partner.<br />
<br />
              One by one, the girls showered and dressed to go home. As Cindy grabbed her bag to leave, Miss Jorgenson stopped her. &quot;Cindy, I want to see you and Jennifer in my office, now,&quot; she told them, putting on a facade of seriousness.<br />
<br />
               Cindy smiled at Jen, mocking her. In an overly happy tone, Cindy told Jen, &quot;I think we both know what this is about.&quot;<br />
<br />
                &quot;I doubt you do, Cindy, I doubt you do,&quot; replied Jen, visibly unsettling her. Cindy shrugged, heading for the office. Jen waited for her to get out of sight, then rolled her panties off, now going to the office. She still wasn't sure what the end result would be, but either way, she knew she would have some fun.</p>
