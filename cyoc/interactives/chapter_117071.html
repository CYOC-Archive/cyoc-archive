<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The final bell of class rang simultaneously as Jennifer rung her own bell for the umpteenth time today. She couldn&#39;t wait to leave school and see her boyfriend Daryl. She was so sexually frustrated it took all her will not to throw herself at the nearest doorknob and fuck it until the feeling stopped.<br />
<br />
As she made it to Daryl&#39;s car, she could tell he was already inside waiting for her. The door popped open and she jumped in. They exchanged greetings and kisses as Daryl started leaving the parking lot. Jennifer strapped her seatbelt firmly between her double D&#39;s as they made it to the road. They struck up their usual post-classes conversation, &quot;So and so was so fat today!&quot; &quot;You should&#39;ve seen how the teacher acted when Jeff threw a ball of paper at the back of his head!&quot; among other things. As they got closer to Daryl&#39;s house, Jennifer turned the topic gradually to more and more spicier ones. Jennifer almost gave Daryl road head there and then, but a gasp and the realization of what she had been doing quickly killed that idea.<br />
<br />
As they pulled into his driveway, she could tell that nobody was home. Daryl was an only child and his parents would be at work for another several hours, not to mention the traffic between. Daryl could tell too, as Jennifer suddenly felt herself swept off her feet, looking Daryl in the face, &quot;All aboard the train to pound town!&quot; usually she would have been upset at such a lame lead-in, but her right hand was thoroughly making sure that she was--in fact--&quot;aboard the train to pound town.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daryl unlocked the door and hauled her upstairs, her hands continuing to work their job the entire way. But she wasn&#39;t cumming, nor would she until Daryl poked her with his magic stick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man! I practically gotta scrape these off! You&#39;re really ready today aren&#39;t you?&quot; Daryl remarked as he peeled off her infamously ruined panties and she moaned her agreement. With little hesitation, he began what was usually one of her favorite sexual activities; cunnilingus. They had been together long enough that he knew all the right buttons to press. It just served to rile her up further, with more fluids gushing out with each stroke of his tongue. He began to work his way up her naked body, peeling off her shirt with an ease that she and Sarah hadn&#39;t had earlier. Her breasts jiggling idly for a moment after being freed.<br />
<br />
Then he began to suckle on her nipples, and again the hot sensation centered on her ample breasts. She couldn&#39;t control herself when she moaned, &quot;My nipples are...cumming!&quot; as her nipples did just that. Milk spurted into Daryl&#39;s mouth, which he drank up eagerly. Jennifer&#39;s eyes rolled back into her head in pleasure. Her cunt shot fluids across the room.<br />
<br />
Jennifer woke up a few moments later to Darla&#39;s warm embrace. They always had earthshattering sex that left Jennifer out of it for a few moments. And from the sound of it, they weren&#39;t finished, &quot;Hey hun, you&#39;re finally awake! You know what time it is right?&quot; Jennifer&#39;s mind raced as she shook her head, &quot;Time for our favorite friend. Lemme go get him from the closet, ok?&quot; Jennifer watched as Darla strode over to her closet, her E-cup breasts and ample ass gyrating as she made her way into the room of clothes.<br />
<br />
Even though Jennifer and Darla had been together for a while, Jennifer still couldn&#39;t quite understand how Darla could stand dressing in as exposed a way as she did regularly. It was almost like a man picked her outfits from a Playboy magazine. &quot;Slutty&quot; was a conservative way to describe it, as Darla herself would point out. Thongs, skinny jeans and tops that practically showed her nipples were just regular items in her repertoire.<br />
<br />
Darla returned, gripping a pink cylinder that was almost too big for her to grip her hand around. Upon closer inspection, Jennifer realized that it was not only rounded on both ends, but ribbed as well. Then the identity of the object clicked for Jennifer. It was a 2-person dildo.<br />
<br />
Darla licked the tip and then inserted that end into her snatch, and Jennifer could tell that she was a little more than just aroused by that act alone. Darla&#39;s hand was roughly massaging her own right breast, as Jennifer&#39;s was petting her own left nipple. Without much ado, Darla angled the end of the dildo toward Jennifer, and Jennifer inserted it into herself. Suddenly, the empty and frustrated feeling she felt all day evaporated with each of Darla&#39;s thrusts. Before long, Jennifer had started rocking her hips in time to Darla&#39;s thrusts. their breasts swinging to the rhythm. Jennifer felt a familiar build up of pleasure behind her pussy, as did Darla as they both simultaneously removed the toy and came on each-other, their hot fluids combining with their glistening sweat.<br />
<br />
To avoid more mess than they knew they&#39;d make, they decided to move their lovemaking to the shower.</p>
