<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Angie was lying in her bed, naked, with Katie next to her, basking in the afterglow of the best orgasms she’d ever had. Male orgasms felt like nothing compared to these.<br />
<br />
Katie was sleeping, snuggling up against Angie’s huge breasts. Angie was shockingly relaxed. Ever since she came, memories of this new reality had started popping up in her head, but they didn’t bother her surprisingly enough. The more she thought about it, the more she realized she’d like to stay like this.<br />
<br />
For example, she now knew that she’d loved Katie in secret for the past two years. And, somehow, Katie had fallen in love her just the same. When Angie was Tim, she’d been a loser - and she’d definitely never fallen in love, let alone have it reciprocated. <br />
<br />
She looked down at herself. This body of hers was hotter than all the porn stars she’d ever seen before, and while she felt true love for the woman lying next to her, she couldn’t deny that she was just as hot.<br />
<br />
She realized she now had time to look around. The sheets she and Katie under were pure satin.<br />
<br />
She looked around the room. It was feminine, but more notably, it was larger. She knew now that she had a full walk in closet and her own full bathroom. It was a huge upgrade from the glorified closet of a bedroom she’d had before.<br />
<br />
The thing is, she hadn’t done that. She’d wanted a bigger room, but she hadn’t programmed it. <br />
<br />
Katie rolled over; Angie felt her eyes drawn to Katie’s huge ass and licked her lips. She couldn’t believe it, but her libido was much higher as a woman than it had been as a man. The thing she noticed the most, though, is that Katie didn’t have a tramp stamp.<br />
<br />
Angie was surprised, but not upset. She figured the machine had made some more changes that she didn’t know about. She had made Katie and Tiff bi. She wondered if she was bi, too. She knew she liked women at the very least.<br />
<br />
She tried to picture a man. Big, strong, muscley... she felt her arousal completely stop. She looked back at Katie. She was horny again.<br />
<br />
“Huh.” She said. She knew she was a lesbian now.<br />
<br />
“Mmmm.” Katie moaned happily. <br />
<br />
“Hey, baby. Have a nice nap?” Angie said with a smile.<br />
<br />
“Only the best, babe. Your tits make a great pillow. How long was I out for?” Katie said back.<br />
<br />
“Only about 20 minutes. I didn’t wanna wake you.” Angie said back.<br />
<br />
Katie sat up and stretched. Angie practically drooled over Katie’s huge tits.<br />
<br />
“Mmm. Thanks babe. I didn’t wanna wake up because I was scared this would be a dream.” Katie said before kissing Angie’s lips.<br />
<br />
Katie pulled back before stretching again and getting up.<br />
<br />
“You mind if I shower?” She said, nervously. “Sorry... I just, um, I’m all sweaty and I smell a little.” <br />
<br />
“Well, I think you smell great, babe.” Angie said, making Katie blush.<br />
<br />
“R-really? I mean... I think I should still shower, but... that makes me happier than you know.” Katie said.<br />
<br />
Angie noticed that all the confidence that Katie had been showing all day had disappeared. Angie couldn’t help but find Katie even cuter now.<br />
<br />
“Oh... what if your mom comes home?” Katie asked.<br />
<br />
Angie panicked for a second before immediately calming down. A new memory appeared in her head.<br />
<br />
“Katie... you know my mom’s a porn star. I don’t think she cares.” Angie said. That’s right, her mom was the most famous lesbian porn star in the world. That’s why they had so much money.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, but are you sure? My mom’s a slut, but she’d still freak out if we fucked at my house, especially since we’re not really a thing.” Katie said, a hint of sadness in her voice.<br />
<br />
“We’re not?” Angie said, hugging her from behind and kissing her neck.<br />
<br />
“I’d really, really, realllllyyy like to be a thing... but if you don’t want to...” Angie said, suddenly stopping.<br />
<br />
“No! That’s not what I meant! I want to be your girlfriend!” Katie said, immediately defensive. She spun around and looked at Angie, who was smirking.<br />
<br />
“Gotcha. We’re totally a ‘thing.’” Angie said with a smile.<br />
<br />
“Angie! That wasn’t nice. You know I love you.” Katie said.<br />
<br />
“Well, it wasn’t nice that you thought I was just some hookup. Now we’re even.” Angie said.<br />
<br />
Katie hugged Angie. “Now we’re even.” She said.<br />
<br />
“Why don’t we shower together? It’ll save time and I smell pretty bad too.” Angie said.<br />
<br />
Katie’s face lit up.<br />
<br />
“I’d love to!” She said, loudly. “I mean... are you sure that’s okay?” She said, more quietly.<br />
<br />
“Of course. Let’s go. We’re already naked anyway!” Angie said.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Angie and Katie had spent the last half hour in Katie’s huge shower, lathering each other up, but didn’t get too sexual. The two had a long conversation about each other and Tiff. Though they were a little worried about their group dynamic, they knew Tiff would still be friends with them. Katie and Angie both agreed they’d have a threesome with each other and Tiff if the situation arose. They also both agreed that she was hot, but “not as hot as you are,” each referring to the other.<br />
<br />
All the while, Angie realized she didn’t want to change. She was happy. Her mom was happy. Katie was happy. Tiff was happy.<br />
<br />
Angie realized, as she was drying Kate’s hair, that she’d have had nothing if that machine hadn’t made her into this beautiful porn star looking woman. She had friends now. She had a lover. As far as she could tell, she had no enemies. Sure, everyone was a lot sluttier, but she was no prude. The fact that her mom had adopted her made feel a lot less guilty about finding her hot, too. On top of that, she didn’t have to do her makeup, she always had nice sexy clothes to wear, she had the most beautiful girlfriend in the world...<br />
<br />
“Hey, Angie.” Katie said.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, babe?” Angie asked.<br />
<br />
“Can I borrow some clothes? I hate to ask, but I know we’re the same size, but my clothes are all sweaty, and my panties are soaking wet... and that’s technically your fault...” she said, whispering the last sentence.<br />
<br />
“Of course, Katie.” Angie said with a smile.<br />
<br />
Angie decided she’d stay in this world after all.</p>
