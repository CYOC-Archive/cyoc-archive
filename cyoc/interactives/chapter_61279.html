<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>"...I... I'm not sure. None of these monsters sound interesting to me... enough to spend any money on them." Kris said as he kicked his feet 
around a little bit, not sure of himself at the moment.</br>
<br>The Scottish man noticed Kris's body language and ginned toothily. "Oh laddie, ya have much ta learn about monsters. Tha werewolf is tha 
strongest an' most powerful creature in all o' mythologae! All otha monsters fear tha werewolf lad."</br>
<br>"Oh... why is that? Why are they the most powerful of all mythological creatures? I have never looked up anything on them, let alone any 
other mythologic creature." Kris said, curious to know what the Scottish man knew about mythology.</br>
<br>"Well, there is one thing that is obvious about tha werewolf. It is a hybrid o' our species an' tha wolf. It has both tha' strength, cunning, 
speed, sex drive and senses o' tha wolf an' tha attributes o' humans. Our intellect, reason and logic enhance the creature even furtha'. All o'tha 
creatures out there stay clear from tha werewolf, accordin' ta mae mum, who told ma all about Scottish lore and legend."</br>
<br>"Sounds pretty cool. So... what else can you tell me about them?" Kris said, sounding a bit eager to learn.</br>
<br>"Aye laddie, there be one more thing I can tell ya about em. They don't really exist... unless ya be believin ma mum's fairy-tales." He 
finished with a rye smile.</br>
<br>"Ok... well I think you sold me on the whole werewolf thing! Do you have any more costumes?" Kris asked, really wanting to be a werewolf 
for the Halloween costume party.</br>
<br>"Ach, no! Unfortunatalay, I sold me las' costume some time ago before yoo walked in." He said, watching Kris's response.</br>
<br>"Damn all the luck! Everywhere I go, the costumes are all gone! Ugh... well thanks anyway Mr.! You really had me sold on the whole 
werewolf thing too!" Kris said solemnly as he started heading toward the door.</br>
<br>Knowing that he had a keeper, the burly Scottish man called out, not wanting to miss this opportunity. "Aye... laddie! Hold on thar a 
second! Are yoo serious about wantin' to be a werewolf for yoor costoom partae?"</br>
<br>Kris stopped, turned and nodded his head. "Yeah, I really would and I'd be willing to pay a bit extra if there was a way it could be 
arranged."</br>
<br>The burly Scottish man smiled toothily as he lifted the removable portion of the counter and walked toward him. As he did, Kris could see 
that the guy also had very powerful looking thighs and calves since he was wearing jean shorts. They were covered in a decent coating of dark 
brown leg hair. As he walked by Kris, the Scottish man placed his massive hand on top of Kris's head and ruffled up his hair. He walked through 
the store, locked the front door while turning the sign from <em>open</em> to <em>closed</em>. As he got back within range of Kris, he 
spoke again. "Yoo can come in tha' back with mae. I have a surprise for yoo, which I only give ta certain customers, which I am sure yoo are 
going ta like. Oh, by tha' wae, tha name's Shawn McCullen."</br>
<br>Kris smiled as he followed the man, unsure of what he was going to be gifted, but didn't want to look a gift horse in the mouth and offend 
Shawn. Kris wanted a special costume and it seemed that he was going to get exactly that. "The name's Kris..." he said so Shawn would know 
the name of the person he is giving his special gift to.</br>
<br>"It's nice ta meet yoo Kris! I am glad I could inspire a young lad like yoorself into likin' tha' same creature as I doo." Shawn said as he 
walked past the counter and into the back room as Kris followed closely behind.</br>
<br>As they walked into the back room, Shawn walked into a darkened room and waited for Kris to enter. Once they were both inside, Shawn 
closed and locked the door behind them and turned on the light. Inside the lit room, Kris saw all sorts of oddities filling the old wooden 
bookshelves. The walls were painted a very dark navy blue, with the ceiling painted the same color. As Kris paid attention to the ceiling, he 
noticed that a mural was painted on it, depicting a starry night sky and a full moon in the center. Hanging from the center was a glass bowled 
light, which was the only light for the rather large fourteen by fourteen foot room, with the ceiling being about just as high. As he watched 
Shawn ruffle through some of the oddest looking items, Kris's eyes locked onto a strange, yet very ornate, looking box. With Shawn being ever 
so perceptive, he noticed this and chuckled.</br>
<br>"Ah, ye saw mae little surprise fer yoo. Inside this box be the contents of some very potent magic. Magic that will make yoo a werewolf!" 
Shawn said with a grin on his face from ear to ear.</br>
<br>"You have got to be kidding! There is magic in the box that is going to make me a werewolf?" Kris said sarcastically in complete disbelief, 
then continued. "There is no such thing as magic!"</br>
<br>"Oh... but there be magic lad, just yoo Americans have lost yoor way. Magic exists all around us ya know... ya jus' havta know where ta 
look. If ya think I be lyin' ta ye, yoo can leave an' never find out oer ya can stay an' see that I be tellin no lies!" Shawn said, his back turned to 
Kris, smiling with a now fang filled smile, knowing that his plan was working just how he had hoped. Soon he would have another werewolf, 
like himself, and be able to move on with his plans.</br>
<br>"I guess there is no harm in seeing the truth for myself. If there is magic that will make me a werewolf for the party, then I'll be indebted 
to you since that would mean that I would win best costume and most realistic costume at the party!" Kris said, feeling very excited.</br>
<br>"Aye lad, then I know yoo will be a very happy customar indeed!" Shawn said with excitement, ensuring to regain control of his form,  
shortening his fangs to appear as normal to Kris as he had when Kris first laid eyes on the man.</br>
<br>Shawn stood before Kris, each looking straight to the other and Shawn held out the box.</br>
<br>"Now fer this ta work fer yoo, ya havta take this box willingly an' oer yoor own volition." Shawn said somewhat plainly.</br>
<br>"Um... ok. So how does this work?" Kris asked very curiously, while being slightly confused.</br>
<br>"Well... I can't exactaly answer that one fer yoo. I don't really know ta be completaly honest Kris. This be tha first time I have evar given 
this gift ta." Shawn explained, being truthful. Up until now, he had never found anyone who he thought was deserving of what Shawn was really 
doing with Kris.</br>
<br>"Wow! You mean it?! I am the first!" Kris said with utter jubilation.</br>
<br>Shawn just nodded, happy that the box was now in this boy's hands. Although, he wasn't going to be a boy much longer. Kris being 
excited, 
he placed the box on the palm of his left hand while he undid the clasp with his right and opened the top. The interior of the box was lined 
with a 
very shiny, velvety fabric that was as elegant inside the box as it was ornate outside. In the portion where the contents were held, there was 
the 
same shiny, velvety fabric, but a soft pillow of sorts insured that the contents weren't going to be going anywhere. The actual contents was a 
vial 
with a thick, dark purple looking fluid with a cork stopper plunged into the end to keep the contents inside the vial. As Kris looked at it, it 
seemed to have a slight glow to it. Kris thought it was the lighting of the room and the interior of the box that made it look as though it was 
glowing. Taking the vial out, Kris looked it over, then looked at Shawn.</br>
<br>"So.... what? Do I drink this, is it a topical lotion or what?" Kris asked confused, still looking at the vial.</br>
<br>Shawn knew exactly what it was, since he made it himself many years ago, but he had to play dumb until it was safe not to. "I'm not sure, 
why don' ya pop tha cork an' find out?" Shawn said plainly.</br>
<br>Knowing that Shawn was not privy to the knowledge of everything that was in the store, Kris shrugged his shoulders. Kris put the box in 
an open spot on the nearby shelf carefully, then grasped the vial in one hand and the head of the cork in another, then pulled just enough to 
get the cork out. Curious to see if there was a smell to it, Kris brought the vial near his nose and took in a whiff. To Kris, there was no smell or 
scent at all, but to Shawn... his nose twitched a bit. He knew there was a smell... it was the smell of the essence of everything that made up a 
werewolf to begin with. Blood, sweat, fur and especially semen, were all the most potent fluids in there and very little else was added to keep 
the potion as potent as possible. When Shawn made it, he was not going to risk it not working on his human subject.</br>
<br>"I think it tis a potion lad. If ya drink it now, yoo canna test it ta see if I were tellin yoo no lies earliar!" Shawn said with vigor, knowing 
that he was moments away from having his first of many joining his ilk.</br>
<br>"So... I am guessing that you have more of this stuff around here somewhere so I am not wasting my only shot? I mean... I am not so sure 
about turning into a werewolf since I just wanted a costume earlier, but if this really does what you say it does... I might have to buy more of 
these potions off of you!" Kris said, mostly excited but somewhat apprehensive. Although the scent that Kris could not smell at the moment 
was already changing him, taking his human inhibitions away slightly so that he would be more willing to try things. Thinking now was better 
than later and wanting to see if Shawn had been lying to him, Kris put the vial up to his lips, paused for a second and swallowed the entire 
contents like a shot of liquor. Being the typical party aged college student, taking shots was part of Kris's normal day-to-day life, and this one 
was easier than anything he ever took like that. With the liquid down the hatch, Kris licked his lips to get all of the contents so he didn't miss 
anything and noticing that it had a unusually pleasant taste to it.</br>
<br>"Well... that wasn't so bad." Kris stated as he placed the cork back into the now empty vial and handed it back to Shawn to dispose of 
since 
he didn't see a place for trash anywhere in the room.</br>
<br>"Lad... ya took that like a champ! Well done... how ar ye feelin'?" Shawn asked, hoping the potion would not take too long to start Kris's 
initial transformations.</br>
<br>"I feel fine... although, come to think of it... my head is feelin a little bit funny." Kris said as he wobbled slightly, feeling as if he was a little 
drunk.</br>
<br>As Shawn put the box back where he got it, he could not help but to smile, his fangs showing slightly. He thought to himself <em>Good, 
tha' potion worked as I hoped. Now... after his initial transformations, phase too of mae plan can begin. It's going ta be good bein' tha 
alpha!</em></br></p>
