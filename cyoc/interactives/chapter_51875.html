<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">April calmed down enough to start talking. &quot;Well from what I've been able to find out is that we first transform somewhere between out sixteenth and nineteenth birthdays,&quot; she said. &quot;From then on we have to transform once a day. Going too long without transforming and we transform unwillingly. As I came to find out having sex with a mermaid will turn you into one. I can only guess that if we had sex with a guy that he'd transform into a merman. It's the orgasm that triggers the first transformation.&quot; She closed her eyes and shuddered in pleasure. It was a moment before she continued. &quot;As Lisa said sexual energy juices up the transformation. Your breasts tend to go up one cup size. However I've heard that there are some where there breasts grow two, three, four, and even five cup sizes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There are other mermaids?&quot; Kendra asked looking shocked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; April said rolling her eyes. &quot;We're not the only ones. There are whole mercities underwater.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How come they haven't been discovered?&quot; Kendra asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh their hidden mostly,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;The ones that are out in the open are usually in deep water where humans can't go. And there's a special camouflage that is used in instances where a human would see the cities.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd like to see some of them,&quot; Kendra said wondering what they would look like.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll get the chance,&quot; Lisa said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now moving on,&quot; April said clearing her throat trying to be serious. Unfortunately it didn't work and all three of them burst out laughing. After the fit subsided April said, &quot;The only way to be a mermaid besides being transformed into one,&quot; she gave Lisa a significant look who blushed, &quot;is to be born one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; Kendra said. &quot;My parents aren't merpeople and I haven't had sex with a mermaid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your parents are merpeople,&quot; April said. &quot;At least one of them is anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I've seen them in the water,&quot; Kendra said. &quot;They never transformed. How could they be merpeople if they don't transform in the water?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; April said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;You see when a merperson turns twenty they stop aging. This usually isn't a problem and most merpeople will usually lock their forms and live in the water full time. However sometimes those that have been on land wish to return and sometimes a merperson will spy a human they want to be with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you saying that if we orgasm we can change back?&quot; April asked. &quot;Why didn't you tell me?&quot; She sounded hurt and Kendra couldn't blame her.<br />
<br />
Lisa hung her head and said, &quot;The ritual to change is very dangerous. It could kill the merperson. And that's just the ritual. Gathering the ingredients for it is even more dangerous. So few merpeople actually make the change and survive. Besides you do that you just about give up ever transforming again.&quot; Looking at April she asked, &quot;Would you really give up your tail?&quot;<br />
<br />
April sighed and said, &quot;I guess not. I've grown quite accustomed to it. I think I would go crazy if it was taken from me just as I would go crazy if my legs were taken from me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Same with me,&quot; Kendra said shuddering. She liked her tail and legs. She didn't think she could give up either one of them and stay sane.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though there are those that do just that,&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why haven't my parents told me though?&quot; Kendra wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;They probably don't know that you've transformed yet,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;Most parents won't tell their children until they come to them since it's unlikely the children will believe their merpeople. Also it is possible for a merperson and a human to have a human offspring. In that case there's never a need to tell them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess that makes sense,&quot; Kendra said looking at her tail and wondering what her life would be like if she was born human. A question popped into her head that she just had to ask. &quot;Lisa, your room is painted the same pink as your tail and your whole house has a nautical theme. My room is painted the same purple as my tail and I have mermaid stuff in it. It's been that way since I was a little girl. Why is that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well when a merperson is born they have their tail,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;If they're born to a merperson that became human their tail will transform into legs soon after birth. Your tail color is the same throughout your life. So your parents saw you were a mermaid and painted your room to match your tail.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Kendra said nodding. &quot;Well at least I know I can tell them now.&quot; Looking at Lisa and blushing she asked, &quot;Are both your parents sirens?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only my mom,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;Even though she gave up being a mermaid she still draws the men to her though not as much as she once did. According to her anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kendra nodded then remembering something from mythology class said, &quot;Lisa, a siren's power affects the opposite sex. How come your's affects the same sex?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know that's a good question,&quot; April said. &quot;I've always assumed it was because she was a lesbian. And now I have to wonder why she's a lesbian. Not that I'm complaining of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kendra and April burst into laughter but Lisa only looked down. When they saw the look on her face they stopped laughing. After a few moments Lisa said, &quot;What I'm going to tell you only my parents know. I would appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone as this isn't commonly known.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; Kendra asked her curiosity peaked.<br />
<br />
&quot;How long have we known each other April?&quot; Lisa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We've known each other for ten years,&quot; April said. &quot;What does that have to do with anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My parents were a prince and princess,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;They were afraid that my life would be in danger so they decided to hide me. So after my birth forty-six years ago they performed a little known variation of the humanizing ritual. The variation would allow me to live as a human for a number of years before becoming a merperson again. Well it worked... mostly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean mostly?&quot; Kendra asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it did what it was suppose to do,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;Ten years ago it reversed while I was soaking in the bathtub after a hard day at work. I was suppose to regress until I was twenty again so I could claim my inheritance but I didn't stop regressing until I was eight. That wasn't the only thing that went wrong though. For some reason it also changed my sex. I went from being a man to being a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you poor thing,&quot; April said. &quot;That had to be tough on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;It still is a bit. Even though I have the birthmark to prove I am the heir to the throne I may not be able to get it since my sex is different now. Also my parents gave up their claim when Katina found out the ritual had gone amiss. They did that so they could raise me themselves this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I've been friends with a prince turned princess all this time,&quot; April said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty much,&quot; Lisa said then they all cracked up.<br />
<br />
After a few moments during which they calmed down Kendra asked, &quot;So what was your name before?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was Rick,&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you like your life now?&quot; Kendra asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;It's fun being a mermaid.&quot; To emphasize this she did a back flip splashing Kendra and April.<br />
<br />
&quot;I meant with you being a girl instead of a boy,&quot; Kendra said once Lisa came back up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've grown use to it,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;It's different having breasts and a pussy but it's nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that's good,&quot; Kendra said. Suddenly remembering something Kendra asked, &quot;How can you be on the swim team without transforming?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa and April looked at each other and April said, &quot;Lisa knows of a potion that will keep the transformation from happening for twenty-four hours. When we have to swim we take it in the morning. Though you have to be careful with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Kendra asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you use it too many days in a row your body will rebel and you'll be stuck with your tail for a whole day,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;So it's best to take it only when you need to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Kendra said. &quot;You know I was looking forward to a nice swim once I got here so I'm going to swim. Just don't start kissing me again. I don't think I'd be able to stop myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh don't worry,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;I can control myself a whole lot better when I'm swimming. I find it so calming and peaceful. That’s why I haven’t gotten out.”<br />
<br />
“A swim sounds great,” April said moving closer to the water. “My skin’s a little dry.”<br />
<br />
As Kendra slid into the pool she noticed that there wasn’t the feel of chlorine in the pool. “What do you use to sanitize the pool?” she asked.<br />
<br />
“Oh we have an ultraviolet sanitizer and a few filters,” Lisa said smiling. “You know I have an idea. Why don’t you two spend the night? Since it’s Friday I can take you to see one of the mercities tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
That did sound interesting but would Kendra’s parents let her?</p>
