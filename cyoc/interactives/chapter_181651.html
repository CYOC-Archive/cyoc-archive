<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Come on Candice, give Sam back her pouch. She may not look like it, but she is very on edge right now. Those two have almost a physical restriction as to how far apart and how long they can be seperated. Well, I do too with Jen, but not quite as bad as they have it.&quot; Requested Rachel. <br />
<br />
Candice sighed disapointingly, but still complied with her request and got out of Chiffon&#39;s pussy pouch. The moment she did, Sam couldn&#39;t stand it anymore and slipped right into it, her very tense expression, softening immediately as she did so. When Candice got out, unlike Sam, she didn&#39;t have that physical and mental need to return to the pouch. She felt perfectly fine. &quot;Huh, I don&#39;t feel you anymore Chiffon. And I don&#39;t have that feeling like I want to stay inside your pouch anymore either.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Perhapse it is only effective while you are inside it, for anyone who isn&#39;t the designated official rider?&quot; Suggested Sam. &quot;Hey, let her try riding on you this time Jen, see if the same thing happens.&quot; <br />
<br />
Rachel slid off of Jen and landed on her cock heeled feet, something Candice just now noticed as well. &quot;Damn, those are some kinky ass shoes, Rachel.&quot; She said squatting down to get a closer look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, they are just my feet, so you know, I&#39;m not actually wearing any shoes at the moment&quot; admitted Rachel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait! Are you serious? Your feet are just, what, natural platform shoes with a dick shaped heel?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, that is exactly what they are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, did you like, get surgery or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, this is a mutation that happens to all female rider&#39;s feet. You seen what Sam&#39;s look like right? She underwent the same thing, just mutated differently.&quot; Explained Rachel while she helped Candice up onto Jen&#39;s ass. She wrapped her arms around Jen&#39;s waist and did the same with her legs too after being advised to do so by Rachel. <br />
<br />
Once she was all set and secured, Jen took off and did a few laps around the house. She had to go about half speed though, as Candice was struggling to keep her grip and the bouncing was throwing her off like a bull. However, she also linked senses with Jen after a few seconds into the first lap. When she gave Jen back to Rachel, She also noted that she didn&#39;t feel the need to ride either of them again, unlike how both Rachel and Sam did. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder what this means? Maybe anyone can link up to us, but only our riders actually need to do so?&quot; Wondered Chiffon. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can see it being possible. Or maybe since Candice is Jen&#39;s family, or at least is very familiar with the rest of us already, she can do it too&quot; suggested Rachel. She also wondered if maybe Leonard would have any ideas too. <br />
<br />
&quot;Anyways, thanks for letting me try it out, but I think I am good for now. Jen is too hard to ride, and Chiffon leaves me and my clothes all wet and slimy. So I am going to go take a shower now. See yah.&quot; Said Candice who quickly left towards the bathroom. <br />
<br />
&quot;Say, what was it you were talking about earlier, something about a harem?&quot; Asked Samantha towards Rachel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I have heard of a single bouncerbutt living with a few people who she considers to be her riders. However I don&#39;t know how accurate that really is, or if that is just some celebrity trying to start something.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well I do not recognize my little sister as my rider, that much is for certain. She felt nothing like you, Rachel. It was like... umm...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like when you have to buy off brand food. Sure it may look and taste similarly, but it just isnt the same as the real deal.&quot; Finished Chiffon, who was also feeling the exact same way about Candice. It wasn&#39;t that she disliked her or anything. But she just, wasn&#39;t Samantha. Everything just felt off about the whole thing. She still felt good, but it was just not as good, and at some points it also agitated her, knowing she wasn&#39;t with her rider. She was feeling a dull version of the same stressed out feeling that Samantha was experiencing. So Candice did lessen its impact, but couldn&#39;t prevent it entirely. <br />
<br />
&quot;So where does that leave us then?&quot; Asked Jen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, how about she can ride along if she wants, but only as a passenger. As in she will ride on top of Chiffon&#39;s ass. Or if she is on you Jen, she could sit either in front of or behind Rachel.&quot; Suggested Samantha. The girls went to Jen and Rachel&#39;s room to hang out again, and to take care of something urgent, that Rachel was just reminded of.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what did you need to discuss with us in private about?&quot; Asks Chiffon curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;This&quot; says Rachel as she slides off of Jen and right onto the floor. With her legs spread apart wide, she begins pushing. Slowly but surely, a full sized watermelon begins pushing it&#39;s way out of the girl&#39;s pussy. &quot;Oh shit! Now that you mention it, I should be practically stuffed as well.&quot; Said Samantha who also got out of Chiffon and down into a similar position, only Jen was there with a bowl ready for her. <br />
<br />
Unlike normal childbirth, which is described as one of the most painful processes a woman can experience, this was the total opposite. Rachel was loudly moaning due to pleasure, not pain. Samantha was much quieter, but still was enjoying the feeling of the several tens of grapes popping out if her one by one. It was kind if like she was laying a bunch of tiny eggs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck this is so hot.&quot; Commented Jen whose eyes were glued to Rachel&#39;s greatly stretched pussy lips. Meanwhile Chiffon was leaning her torso straight downwards and eating each and every new grape that popped out of Samantha with just her mouth, as her hands were kept folded behind her back for some reason. She essentially was just lapping at Samantha&#39;s pussy with her tongue until another grape popped out and into her mouth. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit, Transform or Dare, mmmmm!  Chiffon.&quot; Rachel said while still moaning from her partially completed melon birthing. Chiffon either didn&#39;t hear, or didn&#39;t care, because she completely ignored Rachel and just kept pleasuring Samantha&#39;s pussy in the hope that she will push out more delicious grapes for her to eat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok then, for the transformation, hhhmmmmhhh! Your tongue will grow out to be a foot longer, and can even change it&#39;s thickness and moistness at your will. It will still be able to fit comfortably inside your mouth without impeding your ability to speak and breath either. For your dare, you will eat most meals out of a food trough, just like all bouncerbutts do, which means that you will not be using your hands either. Eating like this way is fine, but any normal meal will be fed to you in a trough when possible, because that is what is considered to be normal by society, except for the 4 of us, who will still know otherwise.&quot; <br />
<br />
Chiffon&#39;s tongue suddenly penetrated Samantha&#39;s pussy by a full foot, lodging its tip well within her grape vine lined womb. This startled both girls, and in her fright, Chiffon yanked her tongue back out, which made samantha cum, which spewed cum coated grapes out of her pussy rapidly. &quot;Woah... what the hell?&quot; Spoke the confused Chiffon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, so you really didn&#39;t hear me I guess.&quot; Said Rachel, who then reexplained her curse. &quot;I love the idea of eating out of a trough! It is like I am really becoming closer to being Samantha&#39;s horse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The way you worded it makes Jen and all the other bouncerbutts feed like this too right?&quot; Checked samantha.<br />
<br />
&quot;It hopefully should. But I guess we will have to check to be sure at dinner tonight. Speaking of which, we got a nice fresh watermelon now to eat also&quot; Rachel says holding up her brand new melon baby. A green, leafy vine was still connecting her womb to the melon too. &quot;Hey, wanna see something cool?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure&quot; said Samantha, while both Jen and Chiffon also turned to see. Rachel set down the melon and after a second, the vine began retracing back into her pussy, pulling the melon with it. The girls watched as Rachel more or less unbirth the melon, only to then rebirth it again. She repeated this process a few times, as it felt just so incredibly good to do it. Rachel unbirthed it one last time, and kept it inside her, returning her pregnant looking belly as she climbed onto Jen&#39;s booty. &quot;Do you two want to have dinner with us? Or are you going to head home for the night?&quot; Offered Jen.</p>
