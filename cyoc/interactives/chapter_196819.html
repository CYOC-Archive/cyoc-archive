<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mikes initial reaction was relief when that he was human once more. The novelty of being Sara&#39;s panties had worn off pretty quickly once the sex had finished. He had found himself in the dark. Despite what Sara had thought he had not understood a word of what she had said during his transformation. He had heard sounds but that was all they were. The hours since had felt like years. Under Sara&#39;s dress he was in total darkness and had experienced sensual deprivation.<br />
<br />
His reaction changed to shock when he observed although human once more, he was naked, had breasts and was in a strange room. His hands felt his crotch and from the absence Mike guessed that he needed to start thinking of himself as a woman.<br />
<br />
Mike located a bathroom and eager to see her reflection hurried to that room. There she confirmed that she had a copy of Sara&#39;s body. The younger sexy Sara who had recently surprised him. <br />
<br />
She tried out her vocal chords &quot;What the hell happened?&quot; it was Sara&#39;s sweet voice that came from her throat.<br />
<br />
She tried to remember the last few minutes. She remembered Sara taking him off then been doused in water. That had been a bit of a shock. Then he had been squeezed and hung to dry. That had been somewhat of a relief after being in the dark for what seemed like forever. Then not long after Sara had returned and taken him to this room. He recalled the medallion approaching him, then suddenly he was a she and Sara had gone. Mike tried to figure out what had happened and where the hell was she?<br />
<br />
Mike returned to the other room. She certainly wasn&#39;t at home. She saw a &#39;Information for Guests&#39; handbook on a coffee table and opened it. If this was correct she was in a resort in Hawaii. How could that be? How long had he been Sara&#39;s panties for? Where were the kids? And what had happened to Sara?<br />
<br />
She couldn&#39;t remain naked. There were suitcases on the floor and underwear all over the bed. Mike recognised some of &#39;his&#39; own undies and underwear that would belong to the kids. There was also a pile of pink satin panties,  just lying on the bed in a tangle. Identical to the panties that Mike had recently been. She picked them up and realised they were quite damp. That told her something. Sara had been washing her panties, she had not been dreaming that. Here was the evidence. But why did Sara leave her panties in a tangled pile on the bed? Especially when they were wet? Very strange indeed. More strange was they seemed to be also entangled with Patty&#39;s magic medallion.<br />
<br />
Mike had to do something about her nakedness. She picked up her own &#39;Mike&#39; undies and forced them over her now wide hips. They were not a very good fit but better than being naked. She then looked in the suitcases on the floor. One was full of Sara&#39;s clothes it looked like she had packed enough for at least a week. She recognised the teddy Sara had surprised him with along with lot&#39;s of other lingerie and a collection of Sara&#39;s best dresses. The other suitcase just contained one set of day clothes and one set of pyjamas for each other member of the family. A dress and a nightgown belonging to each of the girls. Some small shorts and a t-shirt that must belong to Brad and a larger polo shirt and shorts that must belong to Andrew as well as a set of pyjamas for each of the boys. Thankfully she located some board shorts and a shirt of her own as well as her own shorty pyjamas. Mike was puzzled why Sara had packed just one set of clothes for everyone else but a weeks worth of her own clothes.<br />
<br />
Even though she was in Sara&#39;s body she didn&#39;t want to wear Sara&#39;s clothes.  She gladly pulled her own board shorts up then put on the polo shirt. They did not fit her very well. The shorts were tight on her hips but too loose around her waist and the shirt was massive on her. It felt like a dress.<br />
<br />
Now dressed Mike decided it was time to explore her surroundings. Where had Sara got to?<br />
<br />
Mike opened the curtains and confirmed she was not at home. The brochure was right. The curtains opened to patio from which Mike had views to the ocean. The lush foliage confirmed that Mike was indeed in Hawaii. Mike walked out to the patio and admired the view. How did she get here? She figured those relentless hours of sitting in the dark must have been Sara sitting in a plane. One mystery solved.<br />
<br />
But what had happened to Sara? She was here in this room and touched the medallion to himself when he had still been a pair of her panties. Now she was &#39;Sara&#39; and Sara was gone and the medallion was entangled in the pile of damp panties. Could it be that he had literally down a body swap with Sara? Was she a now a pair of pink panties? It sort of made sense. He could remember her picking him up and then picking up the medallion then..... Then he was Sara and Sara was gone. But where were the clothes Sara had been wearing? She could remember the Sara who had washed her had been wearing a green and black dress. Where was that dress?<br />
<br />
Mike knew enough about the medallion to know he was safe for 12 hours between changes. He untangled the medallion from the panties. There were 4 pairs of panties. All identical. Mike guessed one of these might be the real Sara. He took them to the patio where he had seen a clothes rack and pegged them out to dry. In twelve hours he would try the medallion to each of them and see if he could retrieve Sara to her human form. In the meantime she was stuck as Sara for at least 12 hours.</p>
