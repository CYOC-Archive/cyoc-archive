<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once the glow faded out, I was finally able to see what had appeared in the middle of the circle. There, in a sitting position, was a little boy. I could estimate the little boy was around 8 years old or something of the sort. However, his skin was a dark tan, it had white short messy hair and a couple of little stumps at each side of his head.<br />
<br />
The little guy was cute and everything, but where was my giant? Where was my massive stud ready to fuck me and take my virginity away? I was a little bit disappointed actually but, I didn’t have much time to linger on the thought as I suddenly heard a very loud and strong stomp. One after the other I heard it and I knew.<br />
<br />
“Fuck, they’re home!”<br />
<br />
I said to myself in surprise as I thought of something to do with the kid.<br />
<br />
“Hunter! Where are you!?”<br />
<br />
The staircase sounded like it was about to be destroyed as my dad raised his voice. The second I knew he was coming for me, I threw a blanket on top of the kid who just kept staring me wide eyed and told him to stay there. The second I did this, my dad opened the door that was supposed to be locked. I don’t think he actually meant to break it, he just used his normal strength and just opened it right through. I couldn’t see his face, as he was way taller than the door frame. He just kept the door open and snapped his fingers to me. That was the signal for me to leave my room and come see him.<br />
<br />
I knew my dad wasn’t angry. He has never been angry at me for real, but he has a very dominant and forceful way of being strict. He just stood there, waiting for me to leave my room and come see him. I couldn’t see his face from where I was, as he was just too tall. But I did see his big thick chest, heaving up and down probably from the exercise he just had with the boys. I gulped but I couldn’t let him see the boy nor the mess I had made in the room. The floor was full of salt and the closet door was still broken. Quickly, I left the place and closed the door behind me.<br />
<br />
My dad was looking at me with a frown. He approached to me as I backed away until I hit the door and couldn’t do so anymore. He got closer and closer until his big large cock and balls were resting in between my face and my shoulders. The smell was so powerful and I just wanted to rub my face against his crotch, but I couldn’t as my eyes tried to stare at him. I was barely able to do it as his big pecs got in the way. I would have been on the floor by now were it not for my dad’s cock pushing me strong enough to keep me in place.<br />
<br />
“You didn’t finish your chores, boy”<br />
<br />
He said with a stern look and his big hairy hands on his hips. I really had no choice of even moving as his thick thighs kept my shoulders locked and I couldn’t even see anything but him. My big daddy.<br />
<br />
“I-I-I’m so sorry daddy, I wasn’t feeling well. I took a nap and I guess I must have overslept.”<br />
<br />
This was the very first time in my life I had ever lied to my dad. It felt bad and so wrong, but I couldn’t tell him my secret yet. I needed to find a way to make him the strongest man on the planet and when I did, I would tell him the truth. Since I was never known for lying, his face softened but his body kept the same pressure.  He readjusted his package so my nose could literally sniff and go through the whole silhouette of his cock.<br />
<br />
“Aw, my baby. ¿Are you okay? Sorry for raising my voice, want a hug?”<br />
<br />
He asked as his hand pushed me further into his crotch.<br />
<br />
“are you okay now? Do you have a fever or something?<br />
<br />
“No daddy, I’m fine, really”<br />
<br />
I replied as I tried to give him a hug back. My hands looking for his big glutes but, of course, I couldn’t even reach half-way through.<br />
<br />
“That’s great. Then you go ahead and finish the rest of your chores, okay little bud? <br />
<br />
“Yes daddy, right away”<br />
<br />
He smiled and backed away just one step. I was about to go downstairs to get his dirty clothes when he stopped me again with his big hand.<br />
<br />
“Hey, give me a kiss”<br />
<br />
I blushed a little bit and approached his cock. I knew he was staring me in between his heaving hairy pecs. I gulped and kissed the base of his cock. The only thing separating my lips from his actual flesh was the pair of flimsy short shorts he was wearing.<br />
<br />
“There we go. I love you little guy, now go finish up. Then you can play, understand?”<br />
<br />
“Yes daddy, I love you too”<br />
<br />
My dad didn’t like to get on his knees, crouch, duck, or anything of that sort. So he just avoided it as much as possible. That meant that whatever interaction I had with him was always eye level with his cock. Sometimes I just wish he was a few inches taller so I could kiss the tip of his cock. Most of the time that was wishful thinking, but with my new powers, I knew it would happen one of these days. I just had to keep leveling and, hopefully, exploring that dungeon. <br />
<br />
Quickly, I went downstairs hoping the boy in my bedroom would stay there and not make any noise. I couldn’t tell my dad I would do things later, he’s not the kind of man you say that kind of thing. He has a tendency to get what he wants. <br />
<br />
As I went downstairs, I saw my little brother playing ball in the yard. It was a pretty small place, but I knew my dad had punished him for making mistakes and now had to keep practicing. I went to the basement door again and, as expected, the screen showed itself again. This time, however, I said no and I was able to see my basement like nothing had ever happened.<br />
<br />
Down below, I found my big brother Adam. Unlike most of the time, he was alone now and was grunting heavily as he lifted 150 pounds of heavy mass. He was shirtless and sweat was running down his hairy torso. He apparently had finished a set, as he started to rest on the seat of the bench.<br />
<br />
“Hey little guy, I heard dad yell at you. You okay?”<br />
<br />
“Hi Adam. Yeah I’m okay. Dad got you on lifting duty?”<br />
<br />
“Hah, yeah, gotta get this guns bigger, wanna feel?”<br />
<br />
I gulped again at his question and unciously approached to him. Despite he was sitting down, he had to get closer and lower his arm a bit as he flexed so I could touch him.<br />
<br />
“Go on, take a feel”<br />
<br />
I slowly approached my hand and caressed my big brother’s massive bicep. It was so fucking hard. Harder than granite itself. And the smell coming out from his hairy armpit made me week on the knees again. Gosh, I wanted him to lift me up and fuck me with big cock every day.<br />
<br />
“Pretty big eh? Close to 19 inches already”<br />
<br />
“Wow it’s so big and hard. Ahm… Adam?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah?”<br />
<br />
“Do you like to be that big?”<br />
<br />
My bro smiled at the question.<br />
<br />
“No little guy, I don’t like it at all”<br />
<br />
He said as he got his wide back rest on the long extended bench again.<br />
<br />
“I wanna be way bigger. I’m taller than dad, but not stronger. I just wanna be big all over.”<br />
<br />
I couldn’t really see his face, but by the twitch of his big cock I knew he was happy with just the thought of it. He continued with his workout as I picked my dad’s morning sweaty clothes. We added a big shower here were the big men could shower without hindrance, so when my dad ends his morning training, he just gets naked and leaves his sweaty clothes here for me to pick up later. As I collected every item from the floor I suddenly felt as a heavy object fell on top of me to the point that it almost knocked me down.<br />
<br />
“wow, you okay bud? I need you to wash my shirt too”<br />
<br />
The tank top was dripping in sweat and it was so big it felt like a blanket. I could literally use this to cover myself at night.<br />
<br />
“I-I got it!”<br />
<br />
I yelled from under everything. The truth was that I was already hiding a boner while barely holding the heavy clothes. The masculine smell was so strong I was about to cum right there and there, but I couldn’t as I had a bigger concern.<br />
<br />
The second I was finished with laundry and the machine was running, I went upstairs as fast as I could, which wasn’t much considering that the steps were pretty far high. Then, I opened the door slightly and I saw the bulge under the covers. It was still there and it seemed… frozen. Was it dead? I closed the door with the lock but realized it was completely broken and torn off. My dad just broke it like it was paper. That meant I just had to be very quiet. My dad didn’t like to have people over without his permission, the only exception being Adam’s girlfriend who usually came by 3 to 4 times a week. She needed a day to rest her pussy after Adam plowed her of course. <br />
<br />
“Uhm, Hello?”<br />
<br />
The figure below the blanket twitched, but didn’t say anything and didn’t move further either. I slowly started to uncover it until I saw him again. It was a pretty young boy with very cute features. His red eyes were staring right at me and he had a… smile?<br />
<br />
“Master!”<br />
<br />
He squeaked as he got up. He was literally as tall as me but with way more boyish features of course.<br />
<br />
“Shh, lower your voice…”<br />
<br />
“Master…”<br />
<br />
He did lower his voice, but as I kept trying to talk to him, he didn’t reply anything else besides the word “master”. He was wearing a pair of black pants that got tighter as they went down, stopping at his shins. He had long nails too, though they were more like claws and he seemed pretty confident and happy while in my presence. I tried to teach him a word or two, like my name, but there was no point it seemed. I did notice, however, that he did do the things I ordered him to do. I couldn’t ask him to jump and flip in the air, some things seemed too complicated and he got lost when I gave him too many orders in a row, but stuff like talk, sit, stand up, jump, etc. seemed to work just find. It was a very strange thing. I was so absorbed in my experiment with the boy that I forgot to use my most useful skill for this kind of situation.<br />
<br />
||No name – Baby Ezerant level 1. This race is known for being a mixture of races and having huge adaptability skills. These creatures reach adulthood by an average of level 20||<br />
<br />
Welp, that answered many questions. It wasn’t just a kid, it was a baby. The good news was that it could grow pretty fast it seemed. I mean, considering the fact that I was already level 5, I was expecting the boy could communicate by the time it reached that level. He needed a name though. Considering that the name of his race was Ezerant, I couldn’t come up with something more creating than Ezel.<br />
<br />
“Your name is Ezel from now on.”<br />
<br />
He nodded as he sat on the bed, looking at the room. I wasn’t really sure what to do now besides saving him some dinner so he could eat some. Did he need to eat? I started playing with the system until I was lucky enough to find a screen referring to my bonded familiar.<br />
<br />
|| Familiar: Ezel<br />
Race: Ezerant<br />
Age: 36 minutes.<br />
Class: Commoner – 1<br />
HP: 60/60<br />
MP: 60/60<br />
STR: 10<br />
DEX: 10<br />
INT: 10<br />
CHA: 10<br />
Skills: Shapeshift lvl 1<br />
<br />
Wtf his stats were sky high for a level 1 midget. I couldn’t help but look him in awe and then back to the screen. The skill, however, was surprising. I mean, it made sense considering Identify said they have huge adaptability skills, but it still caught my curiosity. I asked him if he could change into a human and there was no case, however, once I asked him if he could turn to look like master, his little horns went back inside. His eyes got a silvery color and his claws turned into normal nails. Skin tone and hair color stayed the same though.<br />
<br />
That was a nice start and couldn’t help but praise him. Afterwards, it was dinner time and so I left him in my room until I came back with some food for him. He was just as little as me, so it made sense he eat as much. Luckily, since I was so short, I barely used a quarter of my bed so he had plenty of space to curl into. It was kind of strange having someone else in your bed, but he was my familiar so it made sense to me at least. What else was I supposed to do? I ordered him to sleep and so he cuddled on the other side of the bed. I, on the other hand, was a little bit excited about making him reach adulthood and, hopefully, get more scrolls from that dungeon downstairs.</p>
