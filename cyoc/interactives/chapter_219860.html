<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tyler raised an eyebrow as his hands slid up to his charges&#39; tiny crotches and they squirmed under his touch. Even covered he could feel their tiny stiffies. He knew kids could masturbate and even cum at any age, he was younger than them his first time, but it wasn&#39;t supposed to be as intense as a grownup. These little guys were rock-hard from one touch! He sure wasn&#39;t complaining, though...<br />
<br />
&quot;You guys have done this before, haven&#39;t you?&quot; he smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no!&quot; David stammered. As mad as he was at Nate he didn&#39;t want this kid thinking his son was a pedophile! Not that he&#39;d mind, apparently... Matt wasn&#39;t in a position to judge; his hastily-donned undies had slipped down a bit, and while Captain America shirt was covering his little weewee, it was thinner than briefs and the fabric rubbed so wonderfully against his hairless marbles. He&#39;d have to shave them when he got big again, he dimly thought, this felt so good!<br />
<br />
&quot;Suuuuuuure. I&#39;ve done this plenty of times, kiddo. I can tell who knows what&#39;s coming,&quot; he punctuated the last word, &quot;and who doesn&#39;t. And you know exaaaactly how good this is going to feel,&quot; stretching out the a with a long, slow stroke to his cocklet. David whimpered. He&#39;d been aching for release since he got transformed and that was more than half an hour ago. He needed this!<br />
<br />
&quot;But lying&#39;s wrong, you know. And since you need time to think about what you&#39;ve done, you&#39;ll just have to wait while I give Mattie here a treat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Davie&#39;s mouth hung open. Part of him couldn&#39;t believe he&#39;d been reduced to begging from his own son&#39;s pedo boyfriend, but it seemed so small compared to the little boy who had his favorite toy taken away! &quot;NO!&quot; He stomped his foot so hard it hurt, like he was even younger than he&#39;d become, but he didn&#39;t care. &quot;I want good weewee feelings NOW!&quot; But the giant teen ignored him as he went to work on little Mattie. <br />
<br />
Mattie felt a huge hand lift his shirt and expose his itty-bitty nail, saw those gorgeous hazel eyes drink it in. He should&#39;ve been humiliated (what he thought was two inches was more like an inch and a half) but when Tyler put the shirt back on, stuck his hand under and pinched, he was in heaven. An amateur would have taken the shirt off, but Tyler knew how the fabric would caress his miniscule head, his dry balls, even his baby-smooth litle hole, and he was right. <br />
<br />
And above all, Tyler&#39;s thumb and forefinger felt so consumingly good he couldn&#39;t even hear little Davie&#39;s whines and yells as he tugged his own weewee, rubbed his hairless sack (more like a pouch now), bucked into his tiny hand and its stubby little fingers (he, unlike Tyler, needed the whole thing to wrap around his boyhood). He was so horny he should have gotten release in less than a minute, if he was still a man he would&#39;ve been drenching the floor with the clear stuff, but it just wasn&#39;t working! He wanted the big boy tinglies! Mattie was just a little kid, he was 6, almost big enough for first grade! He could go down the slide without getting scared. He knew he was a lot older than that, but he was running on pure instinct now, pure tickly feelings, up and down his wiener, round and round his marbles. <br />
<br />
He liked the slide. The hard plastic made his butt feel really good. It was old and sticky in places, and sometimes he held himself in place with both his kids size 12 feet (he&#39;d been adult size 12 an hour ago but that wasn&#39;t on his mind right now) and wiggle a bit. It was a different tingle than he was giving himself now and it gave him an idea...<br />
<br />
Mattie was in heaven. Tyler had stopped teasing him and gone full-in on pleasing him, and waves of ecstasy as good as any orgasm he&#39;d known as a man were crashing down on him. His shirt was long since off, and one hand was enough to stimulate all his private parts and he was petting him with the other, brushing his nipples, squeezing his little bum, patting his head telling him he was a good boy. Even if he hadn&#39;t, the cool air on his nakie body sent tickly pricks of pleasure all over.<br />
<br />
He loved being nakie. It made him feel so free. He remembered once in kindergarten he got nakie at recess, took off his training pants and his cartoon t-shirt and his little velcro shoes and ran around and the wind made his weewee get hard for some reason and they caught him and mommy spanked but it was worth it cause it felt so good only now it felt even better cuz tyler was touchin his weewee and makin him feel the extra good feelins and wait why was he bendin down he was still touchin which was really really great but now he was puttin his mouf on it n givin it a kiss--<br />
<br />
Boom. Fireworks exploded across his mind as dopamine and the bestest tinglies ever flooded all three and a half feet of his little boy body. He vaguely registered he was kicking his tiny bare feet, thumping his smooth, chubby arms on his son&#39;s bed, grabbing the covers so tight they would&#39;ve ripped if he had half his man strength. He heard a little boy squeal and scream his lungs out. He couldn&#39;t think, he couldn&#39;t do anything, he was nothing but pleasure and his peepee for what felt like forever and ever and ever until finally, it started to fade, replaced by the purest afterglow. He would never be stressed again. It was impossible. He would never walk again, how could he have the energy? He had to stay in this spot and bask in these feelings forever. His eyes rolled back in his head, he had some idea he was drooling as he slumped against the bed. Best of all, Tyler didn&#39;t put his clothes back on. His floppy weewee could hang out as long as it wanted. He could feel the breeze from the vent against every part of his free little nakie body. Life was good.<br />
<br />
Tyler looked up from the adorable sight and burst out laughing. Little Davie, still in his Spider-Man t-shirt, was scooting his naked butt on the hardwood, crying, trying desperately to stimulate his teeny prostate. He hadn&#39;t touched his stiffy in minutes but it hadn&#39;t softened, still straight as a rail. He was sniffling how &quot;it&#39;s not fair, it&#39;s not fair!&quot; as he grinded as hard as his kindergartner arms would let him. And oh, he had the saddest little look on his face when he heard Tyler laugh! Tyler almost thought he was gonna cry... then he did, bawling his eyes out, some of the tears getting on his dinky and almost looking like the pre he was seven years too young to make.<br />
<br />
Tyler smiled. He knew just what to do.<br />
<br />
Davie watched in fascination as the big strong man (that was how high schoolers looked to him now) opened the drawer by Nate&#39;s bed and grabbed a bottle of baby oil. He lubed up his index finger with it and Davie&#39;s little butt ignited as he realized what might be about to happen. &quot;Pwease!&quot; he shouted. He noticed the lisp but couldn&#39;t care anymore. Tyler picked his tiny body up so easily, lifted him on the bed with his brother (they were brothers, right?) grabbed his ankles with one hand and lifted to expose his tiny hole, tickling his little kid feet with the other and making him giggle and wiggle around. It seemed like hours as he moved his finger closer and closer to it, Davie squirming in anticipation, wiggling his butt in the air to get even the slightest bit of extra pleasure to tide him over... then it happened.<br />
<br />
Electric jolts ran through his body with every stroke. He squealed at least as loud as Mattie had after waiting so long, but it all felt worth it. This was so much better than the slide or the springy things you could ride at the playground or his booster seat in the car or anything. He came so, so fast, just a little boy who couldn&#39;t wait for it. He was melting, his whole body disappearing in a haze of pleasure. Tyler was making faces at him, telling him how cute he was, but he couldn&#39;t see, he couldn&#39;t process anything but the amazingness all over. Just like Mattie, after an eternity it was done, and just like Mattie the glow was immeasurable. When this started all he wanted was to be big again. Now he would stay like this forever if it meant feeling this way.<br />
<br />
Tyler looked at his two adorable little glow-drunk cherubs, inspecting his handiwork. He really loved kids, not just sexually. They deserved to feel good and he made it happen. The only problem was his underwear was soaked through and he hadn&#39;t gotten off yet! But the kids were definitely spent. The most spent he&#39;d ever seen. Or imagined. What would he do?</p>
