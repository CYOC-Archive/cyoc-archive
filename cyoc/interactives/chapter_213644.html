<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andy smiled. He had no intention of leaving the girls permanently changed, unless any asked him to remain dogs. He doubted they would, but you never know. However, he always loved when the magician ended a trick without reverting his assistant. As a child, he had assumed that whoever was changed would have to live like that. There was something he found exciting about that, even if the change being permanent was only another illusion for the show.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, some of you may have remembered there was a previously canceled fashion show that the fashion majors were supposed to put on.&quot; This was in fact the show that was canceled for Andy&#39;s. There was a bit of a problem for them since they were supposed to be graded on that. An unintended ripple effect from changing reality. <br />
<br />
In an attempt to fix this, Andy had decided to incorporate it in his show. &quot;Well, while I give the cheer squad some treats and belly rubs for being good girls, and of course prep the next trick, the students will do an abbreviated version of the show. So, get your cameras out and enjoy the stylish portion of the show.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that Andy stepped off stage while the fashion students used it as a runway to show off their designs. Backstage he saw Jenny twirling one of the strands of her hair she had dyed pink. &quot;Changing 12 people at once is a lot of typing boss.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is why we built the box instead of just putting them in one. It also adds to the build up and showmanship along with making the audience feel like we are showing there are no tricks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny smiled and reached over to pet one of the dogs that were lounging around her. &quot;Because the real trick was never on stage.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy smiled. &quot;Exactly. Rule one of magic. Keep the audience looking where you want them to. The more they think they know, the less they actually see.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy turned to see Natalie getting out the next prop. She was bent over the edge of a large trunk.  While Andy had previously accepted he was an old man and never looked at Natalie sexually, returning to youth made it hard not to appreciate the shapely derriere displayed in what amounted to little more than a thong on the back of the leotard she wore.<br />
<br />
She suddenly stood up holding an aerosol can. Turning around, Andy regained control and pretended no to have been ogling her. &quot;Thank you Natalie. Which one is going to be apart of the show?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kristin. The red head at the end of the show. She&#39;s a friend, always interested in magic. She sort of wanted to be a second assistant but you couldn&#39;t afford it and she never wanted to know how the tricks were done.&quot; Natalie leaned in to whisper to Andy so Jenny couldn&#39;t hear. &quot;She also told me a bit too much about her interests while drinking. She is actually sort of into shaming a bit so the script is fine. She&#39;ll object but not more then is necessary for the show and won&#39;t stop you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy barely registered what she was saying, feeling her breasts rubber against his arm in the flimsy outfit. Natalie stepped back. &quot;Right. Does she know she&#39;s in the show.&quot;<br />
<br />
Natalie smiled. &quot;Nope. She likes surprises, and like you, audience members who who aren&#39;t in on it being apart of the trick.&quot; They peaked and saw that the fashion show was almost over. &quot;Looks like we are back on in a minute.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the audience watched a man in a suit exit stage left, a gorgeous red head entered stage right. She wore a blue evening dress, that had a slit cut up the side to show off some leg. The dress clung tight to her chest, which was not as large as Natalie but still nice to look at. The dress had no straps and seemed to stay on her by clinging to her twin peaks.<br />
<br />
She did a few poses and then headed to exit stage left. Before she could leave the stage, Natalie entered from that direction, hooked her arms in hers and spun Kristen around. <br />
<br />
Andy soon entered and handed Kristen a microphone, while he spoke through the mike on his collar. &quot;Please wait a minute, before we end the fashion show I&#39;d like to ask a few questions.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kristen took the mike uncertainly. &quot;Okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;First of all, where do the fashion students find such beautiful models?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...we are the fashion students.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really.&quot; Andy turned to the audience. &quot;Beauty and talent. Keep an eye on her boys.&quot; Turning back to Kristen he began speaking again. &quot;Do you have to do your own hair or does someone in the cosmetologist department help you for the show?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We actually have to do it ourselves. It&#39;s actually a lot of hard work to get your hair right.&quot; She ran a hand through her wavy locks.<br />
<br />
Andy nodded knowingly. &quot;Then one nap and you would have to do it all again. Even if you used hair spray to help keep it in place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I did.&quot; She confirmed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t it be nice if we had spray that allowed you to never have to use hair spray again?&quot; Andy asked.<br />
<br />
Kristen seemed to be catching on that she was apart of thebnext trick. &quot;That would be amazing!&quot; She said, with a cheesy level of enthusiasm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, tone it down, we aren&#39;t on an infomercial here.&quot; The crowd gave a short laugh. Andy held up the aerosol can Natalie had given him. Natalie had vacated the stage for the moment. &quot;Would you like to try it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kristen nodded. &quot;Sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Turn around for a moment please.&quot; Kristin turned and Andy sprayed her hair. There was no noticeable difference. After the spray, Andy put a hand on her shoulder and encouraged her to turn towards the audience. &quot;As you can see, her hair is in place, staying still, and she doesn&#39;t have to worry about sleeping or physical activity ruining it. In case she needs to do either she just needs to-&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy grabbed the top of her hair and quickly pulled it off as if it was a wig, leaving Kristin&#39;s head completely bald. Kristin grabbed her shiny cueballed head and gave a shriek of surprise. The audience laughed as Kristen&#39;s face turn red.<br />
<br />
This was Andy&#39;s idea but he was unsure seeing her reaction if this was too mean. Natalie assured him Kristen would be fine with this sort of thing, so he continued the show.<br />
<br />
&quot;A quick spray immortalizes your hair into a wig.&quot; Natalie returned with a mannequin head. He handed the wig off to her as she arranged it on the faceless mannequin. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now, whenever you need to, just put your hair aside as so and you can do what ever hair ruining activity without having to fix it again later. How are you doing Kristen? &quot;<br />
<br />
Her hands now covered her face as she gave several squicks as a reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, good. Now you need to be careful spraying because this has a peculiar effect on skin.&quot; He turned towards Kristin again. &quot;Do you mind in demonstrating for us? You can have your wig back afterwards.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean my hair?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...not anymore. But it&#39;s a nice wig.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kristin glanced at Natalie and the back to Andy. She nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;At a girl. Now uncover that pretty face. One hand on your hip.&quot; She obeyed. &quot;Now hold the mike like you are about to sing into it.&quot;<br />
<br />
She did as she was instructed. &quot;Okay! Here we go! Nobody take your eyes off of Kristen because something weird is about to happen! Don&#39;t blink, especially you Kristin, it will ruin the effect.&quot;<br />
<br />
He began spraying her all over. Her skin hardened and took a slight shine to it as she was converted to plastic. After her transformation into a mannequin, Andy slid the mike out its hand and tapped it on the head.<br />
<br />
The mike broadcasted the echoe of the hollow thump. Natalie came from behind and placed the wig once again upon its head.<br />
<br />
Andy turned towards the audience. &quot;Obviously we can&#39;t sell this on the open market until this side effect is solved, and some people may want the process reversed. However, you have to admit that now she is even more qualified to display that stunning dress. What do you say folks?&quot;<br />
<br />
The crowd cheered and Natalie wrapped her arm around its waste and carried it off. The mannequin remain stiff and still as it was cattied away. With Kristen&#39;s part finished, it was time for the next trick.</p>
