<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You can see that it is an anthro raccoon costume. However, it's nothing like those goofy, cartoonish costumes you see convention-goers <br />
wearing on the news. It looks like a real raccoon was skinned and stretched to human proportions. It's kind of creepy, but at the same <br />
time pretty cool as you imagine how good it will look when worn. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; you state your amazement to Paul. &quot;Where did you find such a life-like costume?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, I made it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?! Did you skin a real raccoon?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not personally; my uncle's a taxidermist. I made the suit out of real fur. The only thing that isn't original is the head, obviously. I had to <br />
make a helmet and attach the hair in the pattern to get it to look real. What do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is disturbingly awesome.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don't worry, the inside's lined with cotton, like a t-shirt. Other than the raccoon hair, it's just like any other costume. Want to try it <br />
on?&quot; he asks. <br />
<br />
&quot;Me? Don't you want to wear it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think I didn't try this on the second it was finished? I wanted you to see how cool it was!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We've been friends since kindergarten. Even after it got out that I was into Furries, you didn't make fun of me like the others. I know <br />
you distanced yourself from me so they wouldn't call you weird too, but I think you'd actually be interested in this stuff too if you'd give it <br />
a try. What do you say?&quot;<br />
<br />
You feel guilty about abandoning him to the cruel humiliation he had suffered for his passion. He'd spent so much effort just to get you <br />
to be his friend again. You couldn't refuse. When you accept, he hands you half of the costume. <br />
<br />
&quot;I made it separate pieces like a shirt and pants so you wouldn't have a big ugly zipper down your back. Put the shirt on first, then the <br />
pants will hide the break.&quot;<br />
<br />
You follow Paul's instructions and put the top on. You slide your arms in until your hands fill the paws. Once it's on, he hands you the <br />
head. It feels tight like a football helmet as you squeeze in. A mouthpiece makes the jaw move along with your own and binocular-like <br />
devices allow you to see through the costume's glass eyes. You are amazed at the intricate and technical design that went into this <br />
costume. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ready to put on the bottom?&quot; Paul says from behind you. You respond that you are. &quot;Okay, you'll have to take your pants and <br />
underwear off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Why?&quot; You didn't exactly want to get naked in front of another guy. <br />
<br />
&quot;If you leave them on, the bottom will look too bulky compared to the top. You want it to look as real as possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
You don't like it, but you see the reasoning. You take off your pants and under wear and tell Paul to hurry up and help you into the <br />
bottom. But Paul doesn't answer. Instead, you turn around to see Paul wearing the bottom which you now see has a hole cut in it for his <br />
penis to stick out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ew! Dude! What are you doing? That's disgusting!&quot;<br />
<br />
He doesn't say anything, but lunges towards you and grabs onto your waist. Before you can say anything, you are suddenly dragged <br />
into a world of confusion and chaos. The helmet melds into your skull and you see out of the mask instead of through the binoculars. <br />
Your jaw connects to the costume and you feel sharp teeth burst forth from your new bone. Your body attaches to the skin of the suit <br />
and the padded paws become your hands while claws grow from their tips. Down below, you feel Paul's body and yours smash together <br />
until your waist and his are connected and you are one body covered in fur.<br />
<br />
You are dropped to the ground in exhaustion from your change. You can barely move, but your mind is awash with new feelings and <br />
thoughts. You can sense another presence: Paul. His mind has merged with yours. You now have all of the thoughts and memories of <br />
your friend. You are in too much shock to notice that his consciousness is forcing you up on your feet and over to the mirror. <br />
<br />
You see yourself now, a full-blown anthro raccoon standing in Paul's room. You are naked, from a certain point of view, since you can <br />
see Paul's cock hanging from your crotch. It is now protruding from a fur-covered foreskin with a rather large pair of testicles in a furry <br />
sack beneath it. You can feel Paul ordering you to stroke yourself, and you must obey. It's your body and your mind, but he is in control. <br />
<br />
You jack off to the sight of your new body. You could still make out your muscular form beneath the fur. Paul had been an avid runner, <br />
so his legs matched your torso perfectly. He was very well-endowed as well at ten inches erect, but you were pretty sure the orange-<br />
sized testicles were altered. You hadn't been gay before, but Paul's essence was filling your mind so much with lust and ecstasy that <br />
you probably would've fucked a rock right then. <br />
<br />
You knew what this meant. That Paul had become obsessive over you, had become gay for you, had found some way to merge the two <br />
of you into one anthro 'coon so that he could share his dream body with you. It was creepy beyond belief, but you were forced to think <br />
of nothing else but how much you (Paul) wanted your own body. <br />
<br />
He forced you to lay on the bed and bend over. As a much more flexible raccoon, your mouth easily reached and covered your own <br />
cock and proceeded to give yourself a blow job. It was almost like you had done this before, but it definitely wasn't your skill being <br />
utilized. Your rough 'coon tongue felt both slightly painful and extremely pleasurable as it stroked your length. You finally came in your <br />
own mouth and suckled it down like nectar.<br />
<br />
You lay in the glow of your ecstasy and wondered what Paul had in mind next.</p>
