<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Here it is, first period: Comp Sci.&quot; Dan pushed into the building and walked down the hall. Posters of big, overly-muscled powerlifters with tiny <br />
glasses adorned the walls. Nerds of this reality...<br />
<br />
As he walked into his classroom, he could see that none of the other boys there were particularly huge... at least in comparison to the rest of <br />
the campus. If Dan had seen a class like this before the Chronovac, he would've thought he'd accidentally interrupted a meeting of Olympic <br />
powerlifters. Many of them wore glasses and had unkempt hair and beards, not as suave as some of the cooler students. They were chatting <br />
amongst themselves about the latest fansubbed episodes of anime or if the other had played this awesome new dating sim... They were nerds <br />
all right. But massive, studly ones with cocks that would dwarf Dan's own.<br />
<br />
Dan was happy to see he was taller than a couple of students, though seeing one stand revealed a huge package snaking down his leg, the <br />
head peaking out the bottom of his cargo shorts. &quot;Average&quot; in this world. <br />
<br />
Dan leaned against the wall, setting down his backpack, &quot;E-excuse me...?&quot; Dan gasped, turning and looking up to a hulking redhead. Several <br />
feet taller than Marcus and Patrick, and much thicker (if that was even possible). His pecs obscured his vision, so he hadn't seen Dan yet... <br />
<br />
&quot;S-Sorry, big guy!&quot; He quickly waddled to the opposite side of the class. Dan didn't need any more boyfriends today! He was floored that men <br />
could become even bigger than the redheaded twins he already had under his sway, though. He had made it so that it would be possible... but <br />
seeing it was a whole other story. The shy redhead readied his materials for class at his desk, having to take some effort to look over his pecs <br />
and gut to see what he was doing. The boy's sheer size probably helped keep him from falling in love at first sight. Class was getting ready to <br />
start, however, as the professor waddled through the door...<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to CS5A,&quot; Silver Grey hair, salt and pepper beard, perfect blue eyes locked onto Dan, &quot;I'm Professor Pascal,&quot; he set his briefcase <br />
effortlessly at the front desk. His tailored suit hugged every bulging, muscled part of his body. &quot;We'll cover the essentials of programming <br />
topics so you will be better equipped to pick your next CS class--&quot; the professor continued, smoothly turning on his projector. The man <br />
exuded effortless sophistication that only came with age. Dan caught himself sighing as Pascal's arm flexed inside the tweed jacket, his thick <br />
round bicep shaped like a basketball.<br />
<br />
Dan's heart beat faster as his cock erected itself in his shorts, causing a bigger bulge up in front. He groaned softly as he petted his genital <br />
mound through his shorts. There was an aura of sophistication and power around Professor Pascal that was different than that of other men <br />
he'd met in this new world so far. It didn't hurt that Pascal was ruggedly handsome and looked strong enough to bench press a bus, either. Dan <br />
wanted to be noticed by the teacher, to have him as attracted to Dan as Dan felt to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;...unless you're of Celtic Decent, relief-room breaks should be kept to a minimum.&quot; The professor paused, removing a bag of tea from a mug <br />
on his desk before drinking the steaming liquid, &quot;I'm privileged to have such a small first period class.&quot; In one motion, Pascal set his tea down <br />
and talked as he approached Dan, just tall enough that his massive package could rest on Dan's desk. &quot;Any questions?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan's arm shot up. He didn't have a question ready as he did so, he just wanted to get noticed by this attractive older man! As Pascal nodded at <br />
him, Dan realized he would actually have to ask something to justify his actions. &quot;Um, Professor Pascal, I was wondering if you could introduce <br />
yourself a bit more to the class... so we know who you are and stuff,&quot; he stammered, making up something on the spot. And he did want to <br />
know more about the man that was making him very hard in his shorts... the man whose package looked like a freakin' Thanksgiving turkey <br />
resting on his desk. Dan watched the clothed package stir and the outline of a thick head--bigger than his fist--move and grow. <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; he smiled down at Dan with a wink, &quot;You can see me after class for off-subject topics.&quot; He strode away from Dan's desk to answer <br />
another question, coming from a leather-vested cub with dark, swarthy features and a broad nose...Pacific Island perhaps?<br />
<br />
Dan tried to pay attention during the class and take notes. It was hard to do so when something else was so hard as well, clouding his thoughts <br />
to an extent. He had to remind himself to stop admiring the way that Pascal's pecs would shift under his dress shirt and tie, or how he could <br />
see dark fur curling out from under his cuffs or how the bulge protruding dangerously in his slacks seemed to steadily get bigger as the class <br />
went on. The redhead in the classroom actually had to get up and go to the relief room over a dozen times during the class. Poor kid, Dan <br />
thought to himself. So horny that it was hard to learn in school...<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry about him,&quot; Dan turned around to a sun-burnt bear sitting behind him, &quot;Chad takes most classes online. Ironic that he has to <br />
come in for CompSci...poor guy needs someone to claim him and put him out of his romantic misery.&quot; Chad waddled back in, barely clad in <br />
some striped compression shorts and a shirt that rode up over his pecs. The class got quite as students started focused on their <br />
computers...the perfect opportunity for Dan to try the phone version of his Chronovac app...he built it over the weekend when Patrick and <br />
Marcus were moving into his dorm room. He liked looking at Professor Pascal... but he knew he was a greedy son of a bitch and couldn't resist <br />
making the older man even BIGGER. He loaded up the man's profile in the app and stifled the urge to wolf whistle at the stats he saw next to <br />
the lifelike model on his screen. What to alter first...</p>
