<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Oliver felt sore the next morning, as if he just didn’t sleep very well. The nerves in his back pinched quite a bit as he arose, he groaned mildly in pain as he shifted to his feet. He immediately felt at his crotch without thinking, assuming that he may have wet himself in his sleep, though he was as dry as could be, though he did have some mild morning wood. After he checked himself, his eyes shifted to the ring on his nightstand, which he picked up and examined closely.<br />
<br />
“Hmmm… sh… should I?” He said to himself aloud, the urge to be Olivia again was strong, but he wanted to explore it a bit deeper. As he walked to his closet, he suddenly realized he was missing his wallet. “Shit… I left it at the store… with my keys! Damn it!” Oliver growled at himself as he got dressed. As he buttoned his pants, his eyes drifted to his diaper, even to the point of picking it up again. “… not yet. I don’t want to have to go through all that again.” He put the diaper down, put on some shoes and started to make his way back to the store.<br />
<br />
“Can I help you, sir?” Said the store worker as Oliver stepped through the front door, a tinge of embarrassment in his chest. “Yeah, I, uh, I accidentally left my wallet, keys, and my phone here yesterday. I was hoping to possibly get those back.”<br />
<br />
“Sure, let me take you to the lost and found!” The employee said, as she turned towards the back of the store. Oliver instinctually grabbed her hand as he met her pace, causing her to completely stop in her tracks. “Excuse me! I’m so sorry! I, I spent all day with my niece yesterday and the day before and, and and, and I’ve gotten into the force of habit of doing that, I guess…” Oliver shouted and stammered, his face as red as can be. “I… you’re good, man. Just, please follow me and respect my boundaries?”<br />
<br />
Oliver followed along, lowering his gaze from the employee as the two walked to the back of the store. The woman went into the back and came back with a large box. “Here it is. If you need help with anything else, feel free to ask anyone with a badge.” The woman smiled as she walked back into the backgrounds.<br />
<br />
Oliver immediately saw his things sitting at the top of the box, much to his relief. As he pulled everything out, just beneath his clothes he saw a teething ring, one barely used sitting atop all of the other missing items. He stared at it for a long while. He looked both ways as he sneakily stole the small rubber ring.<br />
<br />
He sighed as he placed the box next to the door of the background and started to look around the store again. He decided this time he’d buy the things he wanted to change into, take them home and then change himself.<br />
<br />
He felt himself gravitate towards the baby section, looking at the onesies and the diapers. It really helped that they all had the ages they were intended for written on them, so it was easy to tell what he was getting into, but he wasn’t sure how far down he wanted to go. After some time, he realized he wanted to go down as far as he could, so he grabbed some for a newborn to 3 months old, specifically for a girl. He also grabbed a pink onesie and a great deal of baby supplies.<br />
<br />
As he checked out, the rush of excitement filled him again, he was very curious how it would go. He didn’t have a lot of control the day before as a toddler, so being a full on baby would probably be quite a bit more challenging in terms of adjustment, but the idea of the change, and more over the freedom from his day to day life, were all the more interesting.<br />
<br />
As he walked out of the store, he saw that one lady he’d accidentally grabbed the hand of, and she’d seen him too, she quickly averted her gaze to him as he was about to wave goodbye. He decided his embarrassment was enough for the day.<br />
<br />
As he got home, he saw Kimberly at his door, she looked like she’d been waiting for a response from him. “Hey Kimberly!” Oliver said, smiling brightly as the girl turned to him. “Olivi-er, Oliver! You’re.. all grown up!” She’d said, sighing a bit of relief. “I was coming by to see if you needed any more help, but it looks like you’re back to yourself!” She said as she leaned against the wall, though she then shifted her focus to his bag. “You… Oliver, you’re doing it again?”<br />
<br />
“Actually, I’m going even younger this time.” Oliver said as he pulled out the onesie, Kimberly’s eyes sparkled a bit as she realized what he was saying. “Oliver!” Kimberly excitement was infectious, she was extremely curious how he’d turn out. “I’m glad you’re here by the way, I was hoping to hire you this time for some actual baby sitting, if you have time I mean.” Oliver said as he opened the door to his apartment.<br />
<br />
“Of course! I’d be more than fine taking care of you as a baby!” Kimberly was seconds from jumping up and down, the possibility of magic on display definitely excited her.<br />
<br />
“Great! I’d ask that it only be for the day, I’m mostly just curious about stuff like if I’m gonna mentally be effected, if I will be able to walk, stuff like that.” Oliver stepped into his apartment and gestured for Kimberly to step inside.<br />
<br />
“Understandable! I’d be fine with helping you out, though I have some conditions.” Kimberly said.<br />
<br />
“Okay, shoot!”<br />
<br />
<br />
“For starters, I get to take you around town as a baby.” Kimberly smiled as Oliver shrugged. “That’s fine, I’d say.”<br />
<br />
“Second, I get to use the ring.” Kimberly watched as Oliver shrugged again. “Honestly, I’m gonna be a little baby, I’d rather you hold onto it until you change me back anyway, I don’t wanna eat it.”<br />
<br />
“Third, I want to basically be your mom for the day.” Kimberly watched the timid smile shift to a rather surprised look on Oliver’s face. “W-why?”<br />
<br />
“Well, for starters: you’re gonna be so young that formula’s not gonna be the best idea, so I want you to be feed right. Also, I wanna try being a bit older. I’m just curious, is all.” Oliver looked at the ring for a moment, sighed, and shrugged again. “Fine, but I’m not gonna buy you the bra or the clothes that will make you older. I wanna be a baby pretty much right now.”<br />
<br />
“Alright, the we have a deal.” Kimberly stuck her hand out for a shake which Oliver reciprocated. “Well, I’m gonna go ahead and change.”<br />
<br />
“Can I watch?” Kimberly asked.<br />
<br />
“Kimberly, I’m gonna have to get naked for that to work. Are you sure you want to see t hat?”<br />
<br />
“I mean, I saw you naked A LOT yesterday, little Missy. This time I wanna see you shrink in real time!” She said, to which Oliver nodded.<br />
<br />
“Okay, I’ll get on that then.” <br />
<br />
Oliver closed the blinds to his apartment and began to strip, he felt a little uncomfortable being naked in front of Kimberly, which didn’t help when he pulled out a diaper that barely covered his crotch and came nowhere close to being actually wearable. “Okay, here I go. Be ready to finish dressing me!” Oliver slipped on the ring and closed his eyes.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Is… are you changing?” Kimberly asked, watching the grown man sit mostly naked on a tiny diaper.<br />
<br />
“It… takes a little while… hold on…” he said as he lifted the diaper up a bit too look at his crotch. It took a bit for him to notice, but he was shrinking, mostly in size.<br />
<br />
Kimberly watched in awe as she finally registered that Oliver’s form was racing towards his teens as he very briefly developed breasts that seemed to shrink almost as fast as they appeared. His penis and testicles had shriveled up quite extremely quickly and were replaced with a smooth slit as he quickly raced into adolescence. “Woah, you’re a girl!”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, and I’m only gonna get youngew!” Olivia shouted as she started kicking her feet up and down, the diaper beneath steadily reaching an appropriate match to her age. She was now as small as she was the day before and growing even smaller. After a moment, she lost the ability to sit upright and feel backwards, giggling a bit as she found it hard to speak. “Owbabapfffh” she tried to speak but all that really came out were baby sounds and spit.<br />
<br />
Kimberly knelt down to Olivia, now possibly a month or 2 years old, and smiled. “You turned out great Ollie! Do you understand me?”<br />
<br />
Olivia looked at Kimberly, it took her a second to fully process what she’d said, but she could understand a bit, so she nodded and tried to say something, though nothing legible came out. Kimberly then put the diaper on Olivia and held her up, admiring her now pretend daughter, making sure to take the little ring off her finger.<br />
<br />
“You’re such a cutie, Ollie! Thank you for the opportunity!”<br />
<br />
Kimberly smiled as she bounced the little baby on her hip. Olivia’s tummy gurgled quite a bit, so much so that Kimberly felt it. “You’re either hungry or you’ve gotta poop. Which one is it?”<br />
<br />
Olivia stared blankly for a moment before making a strange face and then smiling again. “Poop it is!”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Olivia get herself drifting a bit away from consciousness as her little body seemed to be going on autopilot. She could barely tell she shit herself, she could barely tell she was a little hungry too. She felt a great deal of emotions as… the big lady held her close. She felt warm, cold, safe, unsure, tried, full of energy and gassy. She wasn’t sure how to feel yet she felt it all at once. She didn’t like it.<br />
<br />
“It’s okay, baby…” Kimberly shushed the tiny Olivia as she cried as loud as she could. Kimberly took little Olivia to the bathroom to change her.</p>
