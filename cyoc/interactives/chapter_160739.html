<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;God! You&#39;re so annoying!&quot; 18 year old Janet Simmons yelled out as she huffed into her room. &quot;Hey! Wait! I&#39;m trying to explain!&quot; Her boyfriend Gregory Johnson, likewise 18, followed behind her. &quot;And I&#39;m sick of hearing your fucking excuses!&quot; &quot;I&#39;m telling you, it wasn&#39;t like that at all!&quot; The two of them had been dating for two years now and were just a couple of weeks away from starting college. Janet was the stereotypical perfect woman. She was as skinny as could be, but wasn&#39;t at all meat and bones. Her C-cup breasts perfectly complemented her figure. Gregory was the exact opposite. He was a muscle god with eight pack abs. His dick seven inches flaccid and balls the size of tennis balls were visible through his sweats. &quot;Oh fuck off!&quot; Janet didn&#39;t want to hear it. She had once again seen Gregory getting close to another woman. Gregory could understand where she was coming from. After all, several guys had also made a pass on her, but he had faith she wouldn&#39;t dump him, as long as he didn&#39;t do anything stupid of course. &quot;You really don&#39;t get it do you? If only you could be me for even one day, you&#39;d see its not what you think at all!&quot; &quot;Oh I&#39;d bet!&quot; Janet said sarcastically back.<br />
<br />
Then, Greg&#39;s phone vibrated with a text message. &quot;What is it now?&quot; he said as he sat on the bed and took out his phone. &quot;What the heck?&quot; &quot;What is it?&quot; Janet asked. &quot;If you want to make your wishes come true, then try our very own Wish Granting App?&quot; &quot;What the fuck? Are you trying to change the subject or something?&quot; &quot;I&#39;m serious! Look!&quot; Greg turned the phone in Janet&#39;s direction. She saw those very words on the screen. &quot;Must be spam mail. No way a phone grants wishes!&quot; &quot;Probably... but it doesn&#39;t hurt to try it out.&quot; &quot;Come on Greg. Seriously?! What would you even wish for anyway?!&quot; &quot;Well I want you to see what my life is like. So I might as well do just that.&quot; &quot;Sigh...Greg.&quot; &quot;What? Scared of getting dick?&quot; &quot;Psst! Like hell I am! Fine... If you want to play this silly game, be my guess!&quot; &quot;Good! Then I wish my girlfriend Janet Simmons could see life as her boyfriend Gregory Johnson... and send!&quot; A timer appeared, counting down from ten seconds. &quot;And now to have my own twin brother.&quot; &quot;Yeah, yeah...&quot; &quot;And five... three... one and zero!&quot; The two waited a few seconds, but nothing happened. <br />
<br />
&quot;See! I told you it was just spam. Now delete it before it infects your phone or something.&quot; &quot;Sigh... Whatever. Not like it would have worked out any... Ah!&quot; But before he could do that the screen flashed with a brilliant light causing him to drop the phone onto the carpet below. &quot;What was that about?&quot; he asked out loud. &quot;I... I don&#39;t... Ah!&quot; &quot;Ah!&quot; Just then, the two held their throats. They felt a slight burning sensation and the feeling of something rising up. &quot;Ah... Blegh!&quot; They dry heaved once as a ball of light exited their mouths and into the phone. &quot;What the fuck?!&quot; Janet said dumbfounded. Greg and Janet watched as the two balls came out of the phone again. Their mouths opened up against their will as they went back inside their bodies. &quot;That was weird...&quot; was all Greg could say. &quot;You got that right. What was that all abo...Ah!&quot; Just then, Janet felt her legs give way as she fell to the ground on all fours. &quot;Janet?!&quot; Greg went to get up, but he found himself unable to move. &quot;Greg?! Ah... Hngh!&quot; As Janet tried to regain control, she felt her entire body heat up. What little musculature she had was pulsing out, veins visible all over her body. &quot;Janet! Ugh!&quot; Meanwhile, Greg felt the opposite, like his body was threatening to collapse on itself. His dick stood up at full attention, the tip slightly visible from his boxers. &quot;Hngh... Hngh!&quot; Janet tried to speak, but could only let out small grunts. And that&#39;s when the changes began.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hnnng! Mmmmffff!&quot; Janet continued to grunt as her feet slid on the floor. Her body continued to pulse with muscle. In her pain, she could feel her feet growing. They shredded her flimsy socks. Her toenails lost their red polish as hairs grew in the tips of her skin. Her hands also grew. She could feel the strength in them increase. &quot;Hngh... Hngh!&quot; Tears formed in her eyes as she felt her body shake in pain. She could feel her clothes hug her body even tighter then it was already. Several ripping noise were heard as tears appeared in her clothing. Her skinny body exploded with muscle then and there, ripping the rest of her clothing clear off. &quot;Hngh! Hmph!&quot; Janet shook, knocking off her bra clasps. Her loose breasts jiggled in the open air as they sunk back into her body. Her stomach roared as eight packs of solid rock abs formed. Her arms and legs were growing hair as an alarming rate in contrast to her head hair which was receding back into her body. Her face was losing its sharpness as it rounded out. Small hairs were forming on her upper lips and chin as an Adam&#39;s apple jutted out from her neck. &quot;Hnngh! Hnghh!&quot; As she continued to grunt, her voice got deeper and deeper into one she recognized quite well. &quot;Hnghh!&quot; As she continued to feel like everything was pushing out, her panties gave out with snap. &quot;Holy shit!&quot; Greg watched below as two ball shaped object fell out of his girlfriends vagina. A thick mushroom shaped head was coming out as well, coated by her vaginal fluids. It continued to push out taking with it as long, thick rod of skin. Hair jutted out from the balls as Janet&#39;s new dick rode erect. &quot;Hngh! Hnghhh!&quot; Janet&#39;s body shook as she lost control of her bowels. She pushed out shit from her ass, while her erect dick pissed all over her chest. &quot;Hhhnnngggghhh!&quot; Janet cried as she soiled herself. As she finished up, &quot;Hngh! Hngh!&quot; Janet shook again as she ejaculated, soiling her self some more. &quot;Jesus Christ!&quot; was all Greg could say. He was angry with Janet, but even he wouldn&#39;t want this to happen to her. &quot;Hngh! Ugh! Greg!&quot; Finally Janet could let out more then a grunt as she violently spasmed and fell into her own piss and cum.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god!&quot; Greg had watched his girlfriend turn into the split image of him. &quot;I&#39;m... I&#39;m going to turn into Janet now, aren&#39;t I?!&quot; Greg thought as he struggled to move. He kicked his legs, flicking of his socks which were too loose for his shrinking feet. The small amount of hair on it was gone as a red polish appeared on his toes. He could feel his strength draining as his clothes felt loose on his body. His muscles, which were his pride and joy were sinking back into his body. &quot;Ooooh! Ahhhh!&quot; He let out small whimpers as he felt his body continued to collapse. His sweats slid down his body with his boxers not far behind. His shirt which was hanging off his body covered his dick, the erect tip sticking the shirt outwards. He struggled to keep himself upright as his arm muscles dissipated. He looked down in the open hole of his shirt as his eight pack abs sunk back into his body. His dick shook up and down. &quot;Shit! Ah!&quot; Before he could try and stop it, his body jumped up and fell butt first into the floor and he ejaculated himself. His shirt became soaked with the cum as the remains drizzled his body. His nipples perked up and out as breasts formed. The leftover cum slid off. &quot;Agh! God Dammit! Ah!&quot; Greg cursed, but what came out was a woman&#39;s voice, one he knew very well. He felt his neck, but there was no Adam&#39;s Apple anymore. The small stubble of his disappeared as well as his short hair jutted out from his scalp. As the rest of his body finished his girly transformation, his dick became flaccid and shrunk down past seven inches. &quot;No! Oh god! No!&quot; Greg pleaded to no one in particular, as his balls shriveled up and into his pelvis. &quot;Ah! Ah!&quot; Greg felt them sink back in one at a time and form his new ovaries. Nothing but the head of his cock was visible outside his body as that too sucked back in, forming a new hole in his butt. &quot;Ah...Ahhhh!&quot; Greg let out one more yelp as his transformation became complete. <br />
<br />
Janet started to regain control of her body again. &quot;Ugh... Ohhhhh...&quot; She tried to get up. Her body was a mess with cum and piss. &quot;Oh god, I can&#39;t believe I pissed and shit myself!&quot; She got back up to her knees. &quot;Um... Hey there...&quot; Janet looked up to the female voice that called out to her. In front of her was a woman she knew well. A huge T-shirt that was stained wet hung off the person&#39;s body. &quot;Greg!&quot; the woman finally said. Janet looked dumbfounded for a few seconds as she looked down. Her breasts were gone, but what remained underneath that was some snake like thing sticking out of her vagina. She went to touch it and it grew a bit in response. She was a man now. She looked back at the person across from her... &quot;AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!&quot; And screamed.</p>
