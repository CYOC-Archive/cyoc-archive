<br />
A few minutes ago...<br />
<br />
...............................<br />
<br />
Jamal was leaving the boy&#39;s locker room in his gym clothes when he approached Ms. Hamsurly. <br />
<br />
She noticed him coming. &quot;What&#39;s wrong Jamal? You&#39;re not usually tardy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamal couldn’t help but feel a little self-conscience. &quot;I um... got held up at lunch. I helped clean up a mess I made. Sorry for being late. Mr. Hamsuily said he won&#39;t mark me tardy if I do a favor for you.&quot; Jamal informed.<br />
<br />
Ms. Hamsurily nodded in acceptance. &quot;That sounds like my twin brother. He&#39;s the one with the attendance sheet anyways, so I&#39;ll roll with it. As for your favor... I&#39;ll let you know if I think of something. For now, join with rest of the boys for the tail end of the warm up stretches. I&#39;ll start today&#39;s activity once I grab some dodgeballs from the storage room in the men&#39;s locker room.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamal turn to join the rest of the boys when a thought occurred to him.<br />
<br />
Jamal turned around. &quot;Um.. Coach?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ms. Hamsurily was just walking to the boy&#39;s locker room when she turned to face Jamal. &quot;Yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamal was a little unsure about this. &quot;Um... Can I help you bring out the dodge balls? I have something I want to ask you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ms. Hamsurily smiled warmly. &quot;Sure kid. But don&#39;t think you&#39;re getting out of that favor. This doesn&#39;t count.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamal nodded to that. &quot;I won&#39;t&quot;.<br />
<br />
And so, the two began walking to the boy&#39;s locker room.<br />
<br />
Jamal was silent at first, but Ms. Hamsurily broke him out of his stupor. &quot;So... What did you want to talk about? Is this about why you were late?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamal shook his head. &quot;No. I actually wanted to ask you a question. Um... If you suddenly had the freedom to do things you didn’t think possible, that could potentially harm both yourself and others... would you do it?”<br />
<br />
“Sounds to me that you’re talking about smoking.” Ms. Hamsuily said without looking back.<br />
<br />
“WHAT?! No-no-nooooo! That’s not what I was talking about at all!!!” Jamal stuttered in surprise.<br />
<br />
“Good. But just in case, if you don’t care what happens to your body, then at least care about what the smoke is doing to the people around you. You might not be the first person to die.” Ms. Hamsuirly suggested briskly as she opened the door the the boy’s locker room.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Ermm...” It may be directed towards cigarettes, but Jamal found himself agreeing to her advice.<br />
<br />
“That’s not what I’m talking about.” Jamal continued. “Let me rephase myself. What if you suddenly found yourself having the choice to do whatever you want?”<br />
<br />
Ms. Hamsurily looked at Jamal weirdly as she opened the boys locker room storage room door. “You okay in the head there? You just described the real world to the T. Just wait until you get into college. Once you graduate high school’s liner school system, you’ll suddenly find yourself THROWN into the wolf’s den of responsibility and possibility. Being free to do whatever you want can be scary and overwhelming at first.”<br />
<br />
As she said that, she grabs the cart full of dodgeballs and started wheeling it out the storage room. Jamal held the door open for her. <br />
<br />
“Thank you.”<br />
<br />
“No problem.” Jamal responded absent mindedly. His mind was far from dodgeballs right now.<br />
<br />
“But what if you make a mistake and there is no turning back?!” Jamal intensely exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Ms. Hamsurily shook her head and chuckled. “Kid... That’s just life. Life is not a game. You can’t just use checkpoints and save files to redo after death. And you gotta realize that’s not a bad thing.” Jamal held the boy’s locker room door open as Ms. Hamsurily moved the dodgeball cart through. “You can’t see the future. You’re bound to make mistakes. That’s just how life is. What matters is that you learn from those mistakes. You’d be surprised how many adults out there don’t do that and chooses to ignore their mistakes. We call those people “immature”.”<br />
<br />
Ms. Hamsurily stopped her rant as she enters the gym. The boys were just finishing their self warmups when the coach made a swift kick to the cart, knocking it to its side and scattering all the dodgeballs. <br />
<br />
“DODGEBALL DAY!!!” She shouted at the top of her lungs.<br />
<br />
The boys knew the drill. They scattered to grab the dodgeballs rolling on the ground and proceeded to form their own teams.<br />
<br />
She then turned back to Jamal. “Life is like a video game without retries. You’re bound to make mistakes. But instead of dying and retrying, you just keep on going beyond the bad ending. That’s what it means to be imperfect. If you don’t slip up 24\7, you ain’t human.”<br />
<br />
Jamal’s mouth was agape in awe. “...Thanks Coach!”<br />
<br />
Ms. Humsurily patted the growing teenager on the back. “Thanks’ for holding the doors for me kid! Though that’s not enough to count. You still owe me and my brother for keeping your record straight just this once. I trust that you will learn from you mistake and give today twice your effort to make up for your 10 minutes of missing participation points?” She winks.<br />
<br />
Jamal nodded enthusiastically.<br />
<br />
The coach pushes Jamal into the crowd. “Then get out there and hustle!”<br />
<br />
Jamal runs into the crowd of boys as they form their teams without looking back!<br />
<br />
<br />
..................<br />
<br />
Present time<br />
<br />
..................<br />
<br />
Jamal closed the door behind him as he stepped into the storage room in the Girl&#39;s locker room. Gen was blushing very vibrantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I&#39;m sorry! I know I shouldn&#39;t be abusing these powers. I just a wanted to...&quot; Gen&#39;s excuse broke. &quot;Alright! I admit! It felt good fusing to things! I was just going to experiment for a few minutes before going back to class!&quot; Gen admitted guiltily. She refused to look Jamal in the eyes during her confession.<br />
<br />
Jamal waved his hands in a disarming manner. &quot;It&#39;s okay! I understand. I&#39;m a little curious about the fusion powers too! And to be honest... I don&#39;t think you should be ashamed by those powers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gan finally looked Jamal in the eyes with a surprised expression on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh...&quot; She muttered dumbly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What I mean is... these powers have too much potential to leave unexplored. And that&#39;s not a bad thing! Listen. I&#39;ve been thinking about this for awhile, and I think these powers are too dangerous to leave unchecked. First, we need to learn everything we can about these powers and how they work. And once we figure out how to control them, we must figure out what to do with them. “Great powers equal great responsibility”, right? While I don&#39;t think we can be completely responsible with our powers, I think all we can do for now is to learn from and past and future mistakes we might make from these powers. That means we gotta experiment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gan blinked in surprise. &quot;But what if we get stuck or get in an irreversible situation?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we help each other out. We are bound to make mistakes with how unpredictable our powers are. So let’s bail each other out and learn from our mess-ups.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gen took a moment to process what he said. &quot;I have your memories, remember? How can I trust you to be responsible with your powers when you already messed with those other people?&quot; She gave him an accusing look.<br />
<br />
Jamal waved his hands in defeat. &quot;I admit. I got carried away and made some mistakes. But don&#39;t you remember me changing back Ms. Bookai? I&#39;m trying to learn from my mistakes. And what about you? Should you really be experimenting with your powers during class? We have...&quot; Jamal quickly glance at the clock in the locker room. &quot;...Forty minutes left in class. Tell you what. Why don&#39;t we experiment with our powers when we get home, and we can use our phones if we need help?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gen looked flustered and beet red as she pulled out a pair of volley balls she placed in her butt cheeks just before Jamal appeared. &quot;Okay...&quot; She replied sheepishly. She doesn&#39;t really have the energy to say more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. I&#39;ll talk with you later then.&quot; Jamal turned to leaved. &quot;Oh, before I forget, the girls class just finished their warm-ups out in the field and just came back in the gym to play dodgeball with the boys class.&quot; He then left the storage room to sneak out of the girls locker room.<br />
<br />
Gen was left there standing there awestruck. When did Jamal suddenly wanted to be responsible? But he&#39;s right. She should better take out these volley balls and return to class before she loses participation points. Mr. Hamsurily may be nice, but she doubt that he&#39;s that lenient. <br />
<br />
But first, she quickly put the four volley balls she had back into her breasts and butt cheeks.<br />
<br />
&quot;SCHWOOP!&quot;<br />
<br />
She took her time as she felt out her volley ball breasts and butt cheeks one more time before taking them out.<br />
<br />
She just like how firm, textured and big they are! They don&#39;t even sag!<br />
<br />
After a few seconds of doing this, she finally took them out.<br />
<br />
&quot;SCHWOOP!&quot;<br />
<br />
She&#39;ll have another chance to do that again. Now to go to class before she starts loosing point!<br />
<br />
She hastily put on her gym clothes as she went to exit the girl&#39;s locker room...<br />
<br />

The 1&#39;s note to Twendos: I&#39;m back! Sorry for taking so long. I was struggling to figure out how to continue the story. Thank you for taking turns with me for this story! It really makes me feel better knowing that there is someone out there helping me figure out what to do next! I&#39;ll try to to help continue your story as much as I&#39;m able. This story has too much potential to be forgotten! I look forward to working with you in the future!</p>
