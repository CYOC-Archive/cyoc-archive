<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff heard the front door open and close, followed by a ping from the Chronivac on the computer. Jeff looked at the computer and saw that a new profile had appeared as a potential subject, his older brother Nick, who was just newly turned 18 and a senior in High School. Nick was a gamer who rushed home everyday to play with friends both local and from across the globe. Mom and Dad had when he&#39;d started High School imposed restrictions--asking him to at least go to the gym to keep from being a couch potato--which Nick obiliged so he could keep gaming. And oddly enough he&#39;d taken to the gym and made a gym friend there who also a bit of a gamer like him named Ethan and the two were inseperable ever since. Now at 18 both were rather jacked gamers who planned on going to just community college. Both had made Middle School and early High School hell for Jeff--as Ethan suggested pranks to Nick. Nick hadn&#39;t been one to play that many pranks before, but with Ethan whispering in his ear, he seemed to be making up for lost time, especially when it came to targeting Jeff. His first week of High School he&#39;d ended up humiliated and locked inside of a locker. He had thought of going to the Principal about the issue, but then remembered every film, tv show, and story about bullies said that only made things worse until you stood up to them. And so he had, pranking both Nick and Ethan&#39;s lockers to explode with glitter bombs that covered each in the stuff when opened. They were scrubbing out glitter for weeks later. That seemed to have tampered down Nick&#39;s eagerness to go along with Ethan about playing pranks against Jeff, but oddly Ethan had stared at Jeff throughout the aftermath of the glitter explosion in a manner Jeff hadn&#39;t ever seen anyone stare.<br />
<br />
Any more the two were rarely home as Nick and Ethan more often hung out at Ethan&#39;s home to play video games, or were working after school at the local Computer Repair store in town. When Nick had been younger, and before Ethan had come along into the picture, the two brothers had been closer. Jeff wondered what Nick and Ethan would be like if the roles were reversed, and Nick were the little brother to Jeff being the older brother. He&#39;d still let Nick keep Ethan as a friend, but they could be the younger ones for once.<br />
<br />
Why not find out?<br />

<br />
Whoa... Ethan was closeted about his bisexuality. Curious, Jeff clicked on the submenu beneath it. <br />
<br />
Orientation: Bisexual, but in denial of same-sex attraction<br />
-in denial of attraction to Jones brothers, despite wet dreams<br />
-tendency to lash out towards persons with strong attraction towards in an effort to be noticed by them<br />
<br />
Fuck. Did that mean? That all that time Ethan was egging Nick to prank Jeff and Ethan participated that was Ethan&#39;s messed up way of dealing with his attraction to both of them?<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s messed up... and sounds like Ethan needs more time to figure himself out. A lot more time. Maybe if he had a few more years to figure things out for himself he wouldn&#39;t be such a prick,&quot; mumbled Jeff as he lowered Ethan&#39;s age drastically, sending him from High school to much younger--maybe he just needed to start over from scratch all together as he passed Middle School ages and re-entered Ethan&#39;s model into Elementary School.<br />
<br />
Whatever was causing Ethan to be in denial of himself was likely some cause of issues at home--so maybe making him young enough to change his home life would be the ticket--thing is that would also mean making Nick young enough to match him--but Jeff didn&#39;t think about that right now. And suddenly when Ethan&#39;s 3D model went from four to three years old, a pop-up appeared before Jeff&#39;s face: Original Parents too old to have conceived subject. Re-calibrate reality and relationships to better fit targeted age? Yes or No. Curious as to what would happen, Jeff pressed Yes, and suddenly Jeff saw Ethan&#39;s stats change from what they had been at age 4 to age 3 in a noticeable manner. Apparently Ethan had been the &quot;oops baby&quot; of much older parents and as such he had a much older adult sister whom he now was the three year old son of instead of the annoying much younger kid brother of. He also now had different hair and eye colors, but otherwise his 3D model appeared mostly the same.<br />
<br />
Curious as to what these changes would mean, Jeff quickly switched back over to Nick&#39;s profile and de-aged his brother to match Ethan&#39;s new age. The pop-up that had appeared for Ethan, did not show up for Nick--meaning that Nick and Jeff&#39;s parents wouldn&#39;t have been too old to have had Nick a little more than three years ago. It also meant that there&#39;d be a 13 year age gap between Jeff and Nick.<br />

Jeff hit enter and decided he wanted to watch this transformation as much as possible. And so Jeff got up from the computer as the timer that appeared and began to count down toward zero. Jeff knocked on Nick&#39;s door before being told he could enter. Jeff entered his brother&#39;s room to find both Ethan and Nick lounging as they played a game together. Nick on his bed, while Ethan occupied the bean bag chair. Nick himself still looked like the big brother Jeff knew, though dressed in stocking feet, gym shorts, and a cotton t-shirt. Ethan was dressed similarly, though his shirt was long sleeved. Jeff noticed that Ethan kept stealing glances at him, which was causing Ethan to mess up slightly in the game.<br />
<br />
Fuck, the game was right.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s up Jeffy?&quot; asked Nick continued to smash buttons causing gunshots to sound off on the screen. It might have been Jeff&#39;s imagination, but Nick looked a little thinner, less built out, and more lanky, and his face looked slightly rounder to Jeff&#39;s observations. His thoughts were confirmed when Jeff the socks which seemed to have slipped and loosened a bit as Nick&#39;s feet had shrunk a bit shrunk to keep pace with Nick&#39;s transformations. If Jeff had to guess, Nick looked closer in age to himself, than the two year older brother at the moment. Ethan&#39;s transformation was a bit different, as his light brown hair had begun to grow a darker shade as it shifted from light brown to black, and his hazel eyes grew lighter until turning gray--not to mention his face seemed slightly different than it was before. Not completely unrecognizable, but a noticeable shift in the shape of his nose and chin from what they had been previously was occurring. At the same time, Ethan seemed to grow, becoming taller and skinnier as his frame stretched out before joining Nick in shrinking a bit. It appeared that changing Ethan&#39;s parentage would have bigger effects down the road later, as gym shorts changed to jeans, and the t-shirt acquired a local band&#39;s name on it. Ethan paused his game and shifted on the bean bag chair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jeff, you can sit next to me and show Nick what&#39;s what,&quot; said Ethan rather eagerly and curious as to the shift, Jeff took a quick look over at Nick who seemed non-plussed by the offer, before taking Ethan up on the invitation. Jeff noticed that Ethan seemed far more relaxed around Jeff, than he had a few moments ago as he handed over the game controller and Jeff unpaused the game to catch up with his brother. In fact Jeff noticed how Ethan leaned into him, even resting his head on Jeff&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;You smell good, better than Nick does,&quot; said Ethan in a manner trying to sound teasing, but which caused Jeff to pause.<br />
<br />
&quot;I heard that,&quot; grumbled Nick from up on the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;He hates when I compare you two, but honestly what else are you supposed to do with twins?&quot; asked Ethan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right...&quot; said Jeff, simultaneously weirded out and comfortable with the compliment. Well, changing his parents did in fact make Ethan far more comfortable and confident with himself--far more comfortable than Jeff was. If context clues were to be taken, it seemed Ethan thought Jeff and he were dating while he remained friends with Nick.<br />
<br />
A resting head on top of his shoulder soon turned to a head resting against the side of his shoulder as Nick and Jeff continued to play video games, though Nick&#39;s skill level in the game seemed to be slipping a little as though his hand-eye coordination was beginning to deteriorate. When Jeff looked up at his brother, Nick definitely couldn&#39;t be mistaken for his twin brother anymore as he looked far more the skinny High School freshman who had first met Ethan all those years ago. Meanwhile Ethan seemed to have undergone a vast shrinking spurt as he could now no longer rest his head on top of Jeff&#39;s shoulder as easily and instead leaned against the side of it, like a tired out buddy might. He looked a year or so younger than a freshman in high school, but something told Jeff that Ethan was now a late bloomer instead of just being &quot;average&quot; for his age anymore. Gone was any sign of conscious attraction as well, as it seemed Ethan merely just wanted to be near Jeff an nothing else as his local band t-shirt shifted once again to be a shirt advertising the video game that Nick and Jeff were playing.<br />
<br />
The next few minutes passed uneventfully as Nick and Jeff continued to play the game until suddenly the game shifted from a first-person shooter game to that of a Pokemon battle game that Jeff and Ethan were watching Nick eagerly play. Jeff looked up to see any sign of puberty having long since left his once older brother a cute little prepubescent boy, still dressed in gym shorts and a t-shirt and socks, but all shrunk to age appropriate sizes. Jeff now noticed that Ethan was dozing off, which was the reason why the younger boy was leaning against Jeff as the two sat in the beanbag chair together. His t-shirt now had the legendary Pokemon of this game on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Better hurry up to show us that trick you wanted to show off, Nick. Ethan&#39;s falling asleep,&quot; mentioned Jeff, like the babysitter he was becoming.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I&#39;m not...&quot; grumbled the obviously groggy Ethan, who moved and rubbed his eyes as if in protest of his grogginess.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m almost there, just gotta move these rocks to access the secret area,&quot; said Nick as his character&#39;s Pokemon appeared out of the ball and graphically rolled the large boulders blocking a hidden mountain path out of the way. My how far had this game series had come since Jeff was little. Jeff watched as Nick raced the character up the hidden mountain path in the game, battling trainers, at first taking them on easily with a well-practiced and balanced team, but with each battle, both the practice and balance of his Pokemon team growing less mature until finally Nick lost a battle and the screen went dark before vanishing entirely, causing Jeff to startle at the sudden disappearance of the flat screen from the room. But then Jeff took a really long-hard good look at the room that surrounded him and noticed it looked less like a prepubescent boy&#39;s room and far closer to a very young little boy&#39;s room that seemed to be transitioning out of a toddler&#39;s room. A quick glance to Nick, who now was sitting next to Jeff and Ethan on the beanbag chair, showed a little boy no longer in stocking feet, but barefoot, with gym shorts and a t-shirt decorated with characters from Bluey on them that barely hid his quickly reappearing baby fat on his six-year old body. And little boys didn&#39;t have expensive things like flat screen TVs and game consoles in their rooms. Gone was any sign of a game controller as both controllers had turned into a tablet that Jeff now had a firm hold of, and both Ethan and Nick leaned in close to watch as Jeff played a stupid little mobile game. Ethan himself was a little taller and skinnier than Nick, but still as much a cute little six year old boy eagerly reaching out to try and play on the tablet as much as Nick was. His clothes had likewise shrunk with him, and his t-shirt also bespoke of his newfound interest for Bluey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down boys, you&#39;ll each get a turn once I finish showing you how to play,&quot; said Jeff as he moved the screen a bit forward and out of their reach, while still being playable and visible to them. With a show of childish defiance, both Nick and Ethan harrumphed and settled in on either side of Jeff so he could continue with the tutorial.<br />
<br />
When Jeff found himself more interested in playing the game than in explaining it, he took note that the room had settled into looking like a toddler&#39;s room, with a bed with bed rails that the beanbag chair was next to. Both Nick and Ethan were tiny chubby three year olds, tuckered out and napping on either side of Jeff--dressed in clothes that now bespoke an interest in Daniel Tiger&#39;s Neighborhood. Nick was suckling on a pacifier still while Ethan sucked his thumb. Their clothes had likewise transformed into far more appropriate wear for toddlers. their underwear thickening up to training underwear that was barely containable beneath Nick&#39;s shorts and poked out the top of Ethan&#39;s little jeans. Nick seemed to grab Jeff&#39;s shirt like he would a blankie, his little fist a tiny but strong gripper, while Ethan gently snoozed away snuggled next to Jeff.</p>
