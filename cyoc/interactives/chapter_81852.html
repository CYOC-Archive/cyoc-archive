<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Okay,&quot; I said to my frozen mother. &quot;If you won't take my word for it. I guess I'll just have to demonstrate what I can do.&quot;<br />
<br />
But, how? I had to do something that would both prove that I had magic powers and stop her from calling the cops on me. If only I could stop her from reaching the phone...<br />
<br />
I smiled. &quot;I've got it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish you would unfreeze.&quot;<br />
<br />
She started walking again as if nothing had happened. Quickly I added loudly enough for her to hear, &quot;And, I wish that you would shrink to one tenth your normal height.&quot;<br />
<br />
The look she gave me then over her shoulder was priceless. It was a nice mix of disbelief and amusement. She must have through I was a real nut job. But, the look lasted only long enough for her to trip over her own shoe and start disappearing into her own clothes. When she hit the floor, her sneakers came flying off along with her socks. Her feet had already vanished up the legs of her jeans. Her hands now only just reached the sleeves of her T-shirt when she braced herself against the floor. A second later her head disappeared into her shirt along with the rest of her body, and then all that was left of her was a small struggling lump under her empty shirt in the middle of a pile of her clothes. The whole change had only taken a few seconds.<br />
<br />
I could hear mouse squeaks coming from the lump. They sounded angry. It was kind of funny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oops,&quot; I said. &quot;I didn't mean to make you naked. I've got to remember to change the clothes the next time I transform someone.&quot;<br />
<br />
I approached her and noticed the squeaking quieted down as the sound of my heavy footsteps on the floor grew louder and closer to her. I stopped and stood over her shirt and said, &quot;Well, come on out now.&quot;<br />
<br />
The lump did not move.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think hiding in there is going to help you any.&quot;<br />
<br />
Still, no movement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; I said as I crouched down to pick up the shirt. &quot;We'll do this the hard way.&quot; I lifted up her shirt with one hand, feeling the weight of her body hang down below as if she were at the bottom of a bag. There was a sound like a tiny whimper as I stood up and held the shirt up before my eyes. I looked in through the neck hole to see a doll-sized, naked woman sitting in there, desperately clutching the strap of a comparatively giant bra. I chuckled and tipped the shirt so that she would slide out the neck hole. She screamed as she dropped out ass first toward the floor. I had my hand under her to catch her, but she still clung to her old bra for dear life. Only part of the bra slid out of her shirt, leaving her handing from it with both hands like a mountain climber, her little feet dangling what must have felt like 50 feet above the ground from her perspective. I stifled a giggle and held up my waiting hand to catch her once her grip wore out. Half a minute later her fingers slipped and she dropped into my hand, squealing all the way.<br />
<br />
I caught her gently, marveling at just how heavy she still felt. She lay on my hand motionless and gazed up at me in horror. I dropped her shirt and smiled down at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Believe me now?&quot; I asked. &quot;Or, do you need another demonstration?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Put me down!&quot; she squealed defiantly in a chipmunk voice. &quot;NOW!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmph, fine,&quot; I said and set her gently on the carpet by her clothes. &quot;But, just where do you imagine you will go now?&quot;<br />
<br />
She started running down the hall to her bedroom as fast as she could. I calmly strolled along behind her to keep an eye on her. She reached her bedroom door and made a beeline for the phone next to her bed. Of course, it was hopelessly out of reach above her on the end table, but it was an old phone with a spiral cord, which hung down to the floor. I have to say, I was a bit proud of her determination when she started climbing the phone cord. I just sat down on the bed and watched as she resolutely climbed up to the phone. When she was standing next to the phone, she took a minute to pant and find her breath after the grueling run and climb. The phone appeared to be about the size of a minivan to her scale, but she seemed undaunted by that. She grabbed the handset with both hands and pushed up with all of her strength to lift it from the cradle. She barely got it to shift a quarter of an inch, before she let out a squeak and dropped it, falling to her naked ass. The handset probably weighed at least twice what she did, so it was a futile but valiant effort.<br />
<br />
&quot;You done now?&quot; I asked as she lay back on the table on her back.<br />
<br />
She turned her head to face me. &quot;Who are you?&quot; she squealed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I keep telling you, I'm your son, Joe.&quot;<br />
<br />
She furrowed her brows. &quot;If you're Joe, then why the hell do you look like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
I felt my cheeks flush. &quot;Well,&quot; I said. &quot;I kinda made a wish to be more attractive, but then this happened to me. I thought I'd just get a bit more muscular and handsome.&quot;<br />
<br />
She sighed. (Imagine a mouse sighing. It was cute.) &quot;Yeah,&quot; she said. &quot;I can believe that you're my son. That sounds like the kind of boneheaded thing he would do. Like, for example, shrinking his own mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; I said. &quot;You were going to call the cops on me. I had to do something to stop you.&quot;<br />
<br />
She shook her head and smiled slightly. &quot;Fine,&quot; she said and then stood up. &quot;Well, what do we do now?&quot;</p>
