<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Smith family has been cursed with a bad karma. First, the misfit mom has left her awesome husband and wonderful sons to follow her young lover who is a professional footballer. Then they’ve all contracted the shrinking virus.  They all got sick around the same time, plus or less a few weeks of intervals.<br />
<br />
It began with the younger boy, 10 years old named Axel who loved to long-board skate, swim and play soccer. His dad kept it secret to avoid he may be sold.<br />
<br />
Then it was Connor, 12 years old. When Axel shrunk, he was the one who watch over him the most.<br />
<br />
After that, it was the dad, Evan, 38 years old. He was very scared for all his boys but one of them was still normal size. It was Owen, 15 years old, so he took care of the house. Although, he liked to hold his dad and his bros in his fist to play with them a little.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, Owen shrunk too a few days later. <br />
<br />
Dad, Evan, 38 years old, muscled/low body fat, 12 inches tall<br />
The eldest son,  Owen, 15 years old, athletic, 11-1/2 inches tall<br />
Middle son, Connor, 12, sort of bookworm, 10 inches tall<br />
His youngest son,  Axel 10 years old. 8-1/2 inches tall<br />
<br />
Evan has no choice, but he knew somebody at the shrunken men&#39;s administration bureau. He made arrangements for all to be together when offered for being bought as all the family.  Anyway, it was not very long after he contacted the man that a special unit came to their place to make them step inside a special transporting box. As they had not much clothed at their size they used some pieces of fabric to make some kind of loin cloth to cover their genitals.<br />
<br />
For a while, they have been located in a transit area which was basically a glass-made showcase stocked beside others. There was not much privacy there, besides a tiny bathroom. They slept, eat, and seat in the same limited space. They saw other shrunken guys being taken, some were happy, others much less.<br />
<br />
Finally, after a week of awaiting, somebody came to see them more closely. He was a tall and sleek man, kind of athletic who was wearing very tight trousers showing a huge bulge. Very short blond hair, blue eyes, not bad looking at all. Oh, and he seems to have huge hands, and long fingers though. He was not alone, two boys were with him. One of them didn’t look older than 9 years old, the other one was more like 11-12 years old. They were also blond with blue eyes. Not sure but they could maybe be Europeans.<br />
<br />
The person in charge there told the man they have to purchase them all as a family but to ease the transaction, a free dollhouse would come with them. The first one the man wanted to examine was Axel 10 years old. He gently picked him up which gave a horrifying view to his dad. He saw him holding his little boy in his left hand and his tiny loincloth removed by the man’s thumb and index fingertip. The boy cries a little, but his dad told him to remain calm even though the man was probing his tiny penis, playing with it until it gets hard.  Evan knew they were nothing but pets and toys since they shrunk, so there was nothing he could do about it. The giant’s older son grabbed Owen, but he has not stripped him naked, he just kissed his tiny head.<br />
<br />
Finally, the giant man told all of them to get naked. They were kind of fascinated by the giant’s impressive bulge, so they all got erections. That made the giant dad and his sons smiled so they has all been bought.<br />
<br />
The transportation to the buyer&#39;s place was not very long. At the destination, the shrunken Smith family has been allowed to settle in a tiny house, well a dollhouse actually. It was on only one level of tiny construction with 4 bedrooms, a tiny kitchen, a living room, and a bathroom. The A shape roof has hinges to open on both sides actually. The furniture was quite basic with a table, chairs, sofa, couch, beds, toilets, and shower. <br />
<br />
The dad tried to explain to his sons that they have to comply with whatever the giants would want from them. While he was talking, one side of the roof has been open. From above, they saw the 9 years old giant boy entering his hand to then closing his fingers around the tiny dad,  Evan.<br />
<br />
(Evan) Oh OK, well see you later kids, Dad is wanted by one of the giants.<br />
<br />
The boys were a bit scared, but they know they are more resistant and strong that they appear. Still, a young kid just picked up their dad. But they had not much to do but wait.<br />
<br />
The giant kid talked to Evan. “Hello I am Tyler, I’m 9 years old, not a baby anymore, I want to play with you.<br />
<br />
(Evan) Well, Hello Tyler, nice to meet you. What kind of game do you want to play with me?<br />
<br />
(Tyler) I want to give you a medical examination.<br />
<br />
(Evan) It’s fine with me.<br />
<br />
The boy made the tiny dad lie on his back, so he put his big finger on the tiny wrist to feel his pulse. He then sticks his huge ear on the man’s chest to listen to his tiny heart. <br />
<br />
(Evan) Are everything fine some far, Doctor, [he says with a smile]<br />
<br />
The boy giggles and nods. He then begins to osculate him, feeling his bones and muscles. After that, the giant kid seems to be more curious about Evan’s body.<br />
<br />
(Tyler) You have more hairs on your body than my dad have, why is that? <br />
<br />
(Evan), well first it’s in my genes to have body hair, plus I never shave it. Some like me are very hairy but they shave it. Is your dad shave his body hair or does he shave it?<br />
<br />
While the boy caresses the hairy tiny man he replies: “My dad is naturally smooth I think but touching you is like touching a pet, I love it.<br />
<br />
Evan smiles at the nice giant boy who caresses him from head to foot. At each lap, the giant boy’s palms also rub the tiny man’s genitals though. The poor tiny man has an erection but the giant boy does not pay attention to it. After a while, he brings back the tiny dad and put him back in the tiny house with his sons.<br />
<br />
The boys cannot ignore the view of their dad’s bulge. The eldest, Owen says: Well dad, looks like it was not too bad for you out there, right? [he winks]<br />
<br />
Half an hour later, the roof opens again. Looking up they saw the 11-12 years old boy. Later they found out he is 12. His name is Grant and he looks very serious, like somebody who has not decided yet what he wants to do or what to choose. Finally, he picks up Owen, 15 years old, and Connor, 12 years. They are a little afraid, but they wave down at their dad and younger bro as they are taken away.<br />
<br />
(Grant) Okay toys, let’s be blunt, we’ve bought you, you are ours and you have to cope with anything we have in mind for you.<br />
<br />
Owen, for some reason, feels very aroused by that giant who is the same age as his bother Connor.<br />
<br />
(Owen) Oh yeah, we are your toys, sir!<br />
<br />
Grant did not expect that response, but he feels like the master of the universe because of that reply.  As he is seated he quickly pulls out his erect penis, grabs Owen, and put his right in front of it. He then grabs the 12 years old Connor in his left hand to then play with his erected tiny dick with his right hand’s fingertip. <br />
<br />
(Grant) Now, you near my dick, pleasure me as I pleasure your young bro. <br />
<br />
Owen literally rides the giant boy’s dick and fucks it, he enjoys doing it.  Connor, in the meanwhile, feels many pleasure pulses, he even think he may pee. But nope, he he about to have a dry cum. Owen is so excited, he finally ejaculate few seconds before Grant does.<br />
<br />
(Grant) It was fun, good job guys!<br />
<br />
So he carry them back to the tiny house. Owen smells like sperm so he need to shower.<br />
<br />
About 4-5 minutes later, the roof opens again, and that time the giant dad is looking down.  He does not see the one he wanted. So he closed that roof panel and open the other one. He wanted Axel, the 10-year-old one. He was in his room for a nap, so he was asleep. That giant dad, which name has been known to be Julian, loves to see that young boy sleeping out of his sheets, legs spread. He has so perfectly defined little muscles. Nice thighs, abs, tiny pecs, etc. His loin cloth barely hid his genitals one of his testicles have popped out. <br />
<br />
Very gently,  Julian slides his fingers under the tiny sleeping boy. Strangely, that does not wake him, maybe he was very tired. He lifts him and carries him to his bedroom. Inside, he lies the tiny kid on one of his pillows to then lay beside him on his side. He then uses one of his fingertip and thumb to remove the loin cloth. Playing with the tiny penis, the giant enjoys seeing it becoming harder. Slowly the boy awakes with a smile, then he realizes the giant man is playing with his pee pee. But he remembers what his dad told him about doing anything their owner wants them to do. The huge man then lays on his back and the boy see he only wears his underwear. He has been put on the huge abs, so the boy is exploring the giant’s body to end up right over the bulge. He lays on that manhood, and the giant rubs the tiny boy against it. <br />
<br />
A little while after their sensual games, the dad caries the tiny young boy to their living room and cal his sons. <br />
<br />
(Julian) Now boys this is the cutest of all, you have to be very careful with him as he is more fragile that his brother and his dad. Now I want you all to play with his tiny dick.<br />
<br />
One by one, the giant boys played very gently with the young genitals. The kids moaned and had a dry cum. <br />
<br />
(What next?)</p>
