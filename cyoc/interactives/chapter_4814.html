<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">No longer able to take in the fact that this woman before you is turning into an Irish Setter, you freak out and decide to quickly leave this place. You got to expose this place for what it really is. You got to tell someone and so you quickly turn away from the woman in front of you and open the door. You hear her shouting at you about something as you quickly slip out of the room and close the door behind you. But you are too nervous, too scared for your own safety and your own humanity to pay attention to it.<br />
Back in the main room of the building, you try to act calm and collected as you look around the room. But you find it hard to act calm and collected at the sight of all these dogs in room. You can’t help but wonder just how many of these dogs were really born as dogs and how many of them were like that woman in the room you just left. How many of these dogs used to be human beings like yourself before they had their humanity stripped from them by these so-called zoo employees?  How many people went missing after they came here? Yes you must tell someone about this place before someone else goes literally to the dogs. Still trying to act calm and collected you begin to quickly walk to the exit to this place, ignoring the dogs who are showing a playful interest to be with you. Ignoring them for what they could have been, you try to keep a casual eye for any of the zoo employees who might be here. <br />
Closer and closer you make your way to the exit. Your heart is pounding and you are trying to stay one step in front of the confusion and terror that you are still feeling towards this place. Your mind doesn’t know what to believe anymore. You reach the exit and are about to open the door when suddenly you feel a hand on your shoulder. <br />
<br />
&quot;Did you see anything interesting in that room you just left, sir?&quot; Says a female voice full of kindness and mirth.<br />
<br />
You want to ignore the female zoo employee who is standing behind you. You just want to open the door and get away from this place. But instead of opening the door and leaving, you find yourself turning around to meet her eyes, her deep green eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, of course not.&quot; You try to tell her with your best face. <br />
<br />
She smiles an impish smile and gives you a look that says she knows you saw something in that room. <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course you saw something in that room back there. But let me ask you this, do you really believe that anyone is going to believe your story about this place? A place where men and women are turned literally into dogs?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her question hits home and gets you really thinking for the next few seconds. She is right. Who would believe you about this place? Would your friends believe you? Would your family believe you? Would the police believe you? And deep down inside you, you realize that they wouldn’t. Without any shred of proof , any person you did tell would think you deserve a nice stay in a padded cell. You look back at the zoo employee and see that she already knows the answer to the question she gave you. <br />
<br />
&quot;They wouldn’t believe you one bit unless they saw what you saw for themselves.&quot; She tells you as she smiles a pleasant smile, which oddly enough makes you feel a lot more comfortable than before. &quot;Now how about I make you forget everything you saw here and give you a life worth living.&quot;<br />
<br />
Without thinking about the implications of what she is saying to you, you nod your head mechanically and allow her to lead you back into the main room of this place. She walks you up to a door that you didn’t initially see when you first came here. She opens up the door and ushers you inside. You briefly take note that the room looks like a grooming salon for the dogs back in the main room as she pulls you into the middle of the room. There you just stand like a zombie and watch her as she goes back to the door and locks it. She then comes back to you with another pleasant smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hope you are going to enjoy this next experience, my friend.&quot; She says to you teasingly.<br />
<br />
Your eyes then widen as she begins to undress you without a single protest from you. You find yourself sighing with pleasure as she undresses you a piece at a time. The fear and horror from your encounter with that woman in the other room and from the truth about this place begins to fade away. Fading away to be replaced with an odd sense of contentment. When she has stripped you from all of your clothes, she walks over to a nearby counter and looks at some bottles. She finds one and smiles to herself while holding it. <br />
The zoo employee then comes back to you with the bottle. And you can see that it contains something milky-looking. She briefly puts it into her pant’s pocket and pulls out two rubber gloves. She pulls the bottle out again after putting the gloves on. She then pours the white stuff onto her hands. It looks more like cream than a liquid as she walks up to you and begins to massage it onto your chest. A burst of pleasurable warmth fills you as she works it into you. You sigh with pleasure and the last of the horror you were feeling dissipates from you. And leaves you wondering if the truth about this place is really that bad. As she continues to massage your chest, you mumble an apology to the zoo employee. She smiles again.<br />
<br />
&quot;That’s okay, a lot of people like you who come here for our ‘special’ treatment don’t really understand the good we do. But they certainly do learn the goodness we do once they have been treated and trained for their new existence as someone’s best friend.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That’s nice.&quot; You tell her dreamily as the massage continues.<br />
The initial burst of warm energy that you felt when she first touched you with that cream shrinks down to little pulses of electricity every time she rubs her hands up and down your chest. It doesn’t feel like anything you have ever felt before. It feels better than sex. In fact it almost feels transcendent to you. <br />
You are enjoying the feel of her touching you that you barely register the docked tail that has sprouted from a lump just above your hips. Nor do you fully register, the small patches of dark gray and white fur that have started to grow on your back, legs, arms and face. You begin to have some trouble standing up on two feet as your arms and legs begin to change position a bit and as the long bones of your feet begin to lengthen. By this point in time, you begin to feel uncomfortable just standing on your two feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come rest your hands on my shoulders and lean into me. I’ll keep you up.&quot; She tells you while moving her hands down to your groin and resuming her little massage. Your pleasure increases as she teases your privates and plays with your family jewels. You practically pant with contentment at her touch. <br />
You happily obey her order and lean up against her. She smiles at you again and gives your private a quick tease that practically quickens your panting. You are only minimally aware now that your legs are becoming stocky, muscular and bear-like. You can feel your chest stretching and forcing you to lean into her more. She stops massaging you with both of her hands and holds on to you with one hand. The touch of her feels good that your awareness narrows down to only her and her alone. You no longer pay any attention to the fact that your lower body is transforming at a faster rate than your upper body. You now have a docked tail. Your feet are a pair of strong paws and your lower body is covered in a shaggy layer of dark gray fur. Your lower body has changed fully into the lower body of an Old English Sheepdog. But that fact doesn’t reach your sense of awareness, you are too busy just enjoying the pleasure of being fondled by your female friend. <br />
You begin to have difficulties thinking straight. And you are having trouble separating your thoughts from these newfound sensations in your mind. Sensations that you have never experienced before in your entire life and yet feel like they have been with you forever. You look at your friend and see that she is continuing to smile at you. Her smile makes you happy because you know that is she allaying your fears and helping you to understand the goodness that the people here are doing for those fortunate few who come here. You are vaguely aware that she is pleased by the progress of your transformation into a large, shaggy dog. And she also knows that you have begun to help her along with the transformation into a sheepdog. <br />
Your friend stops massaging you and begins to gently lower you to the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just want to let you know that you are going to make a fine Old English Sheepdog. You are going to make someone very happy as a pet.&quot;<br />
You know how to act to such a compliment from a friendly person. You give her a toothy smile and pant amicably. You don’t bother trying to say something to her because words from you can no longer express your feelings. The transformation has reached your neck. You now have the body, legs, neck and stumpy tail of an Old English Sheepdog, but your arms and head are still mostly human. But you can feel that they won’t stay that way for long. You start to feel your arms repositioning themselves into a new pair of legs. But the feeling doesn’t scare you one bit as you look back at your body and see its’ shagginess. You pant happily and let off your first woof as a dog. <br />
And with that first woof from your throat, you find yourself beginning to enjoy the sensations you are feeling. You can feel the itching and pulling sensation in your face as a dog’s muzzle appears into view. The sight and sensation lasts a minute before the white fur on your muzzled face grows so thick to hamper your ability to see. But that isn’t a problem for you, now that you can smell and hear better than before. You feel the fingers on your hands becoming stubbier with the exception of your thumb, which you feel less and less of. You feel so great that you really find yourself eager to be someone’s pet sheepdog. <br />
<br />
With one final burst of warm energy, your mind is transformed. It is no longer the mind of a human. It is now the mind of an intelligent and obedient dog. You are now a large, friendly Old English Sheepdog, a very content and happy Old English Sheepdog. You sit back down on your shaggy haunches and gaze up through a shaggy veil at your friend. You pant to catch your breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good Boy! Didn’t I tell you that I would help make you forget that nasty sight in that other room. And didn’t I tell you that I would make your whole life better?&quot; Your mistress tells you as she leans down to give your shaggy head a playful rub.<br />
<br />
You pant happily at her touch and know by touch and scent that your friend is quite pleased with you. <br />
After she finishes giving you a pleasant rub on your head as a reward, she crouches down in front of you and takes hold of your shaggy head with both of her hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to say that you’re one of the nicest dogs I’ve transformed without much fuss in my time here.&quot;<br />
<br />
You just pant happily as she then reaches down to kiss you on the head. As a response you reach up and give her a wet kiss on her chin with your tongue. She smiles again and then starts to gather up your old clothes. She lets you smell them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that you won’t be needing these anymore, I’ll donate them to some needy homeless person. How’s that for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
You let out a happy woof even though you no longer have an idea what she just said to you. But whatever she said made her happy and seeing her happy makes you happy in return. You sniff your old clothes again and recognize your own scent mix in with the scent of a nervous male human. Your friend then stands up and walks away with the clothes. She unlocks the door and then looks at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready to get started with your new life at &quot;Kennel for a Day, Shaggy?&quot;<br />
<br />
You bark at the sound of your name. Your name’s Shaggy now and your friend wants you to come over to her. You get up off of your shaggy bear-like haunches and shuffle your shaggy bulk on over to her. You look up at her as she looks down at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are going to make a fine pet for somebody once I have put you through some training, Shaggy. I think we are going to have an excellent time together.&quot;<br />
<br />
You woof again in agreement toward whatever she just said. You don’t understand the sounds she made, but you do understand the scents of contentment and happiness that she is giving off. And it is those scents that tell you how well you have behaved. You just know that you are going to a very happy Old English Sheepdog during your stay here.</p>
