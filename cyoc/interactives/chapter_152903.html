<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A 14 year old boy named Mike finds a really cool looking medallion on the side of the road. Mike is slightly taller than the average 14 year old boy at 5&#39;8 inches. He has very dark, almost black curly hair, and chocolate-brown eyes. His nose is a bit on the broad side, and his teeth are perfectly straight and white. He has a bit of a baby face, with no hair growing in yet.<br />
<br />
Mike&#39;s body is very slightly on the thick side, weighing in at 155 pounds. Though he is very slightly on the heavy side, he still looks good. He doesn&#39;t look particularly chubby. Just. A bit thick. <br />
<br />
He isn&#39;t the coolest-looking or best-looking teenage boy in the world. But he is FAR from ugly. In fact, he is kinda cute, in a &quot;good boy&quot; kinda way. <br />
<br />
So Mike happens to pick up the medallion of Zulo, not knowing what it was. He hops back on his bike, and pedals towards the mall.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
My name is Tara. Tara Reed. I&quot;m a young, drop-dead gorgeous woman. I&#39;m 29 years old, and my 30th birthday is coming up. I&#39;m still quite young, and very much in shape. I&#39;m a corporate executive with a houseboat, and a couple million in the bank. I&#39;m a highly observant woman, which has served me very well in my professional career. <br />
<br />
I have long, luscious blond hair, and sharp blue eyes. I&#39;m tall, at 6&#39;0 even. 6&#39;1, when wearing my 1 inch heels. I have bad eyesight, but I wear expensive contacts that greatly improved my.visiom, but doesn&#39;t give me 20-20 vision. They do keep my eyes moist. Not the cheap kinds that&#39;ll dry out and irritate your eyes. <br />
<br />
I have a fiancee, a cute Italian man who keeps his head shaved. He has a round head, dark eyes, and his shaved hair on top, when it begins growing back in just before shaving it off again, it a dark brown. He&#39;s a really cute man, with a kind of a baby face. He has an identical twin brother, and they&#39;re both hilarious, smart, and hard-working. They are both shorter than me, at 5&#39;10. They are in excellent shape, having been body-builders in their 20s. Which they failed at, mostly due to them being naturally small with high metabolisms. They are still thick, as they both still work out, but they have since grown smaller after giving up their dream. They still have the same build as Vin Diesel, just a bit leaner. In fact, they both look a little like Vin Diesel in their facial appearances. <br />
<br />
So anyway, I&#39;m at the mall shopping for a new wardrobe for the fall and coming winter months. I noticed a young teenage boy with slightly messy dark curly hair, blue jeans, a plain white T-shirt, and a pair of those black-and-white Converse shoes that young boys like him tend to wear. He is kind of a cute kid. I&#39;d love to have a son and a daughter some day, and he looks a little like my fiancee. Just much scrawnier. Except he isn&#39;t &quot;skinny.&quot; Kinda thick-set.<br />
<br />
I noticed him, because he was trying to catch glimpses at me while awkwardly trying to hide it. I roll my eyes as I walk towards him thinking &quot;boys will be boys&quot;. <br />
<br />
I&#39;m heading toward&#39;s Macy&#39;s, and he&#39;s walking towards me. I see he&#39;s carrying something in his hand, but I don&#39;t know what. I don&#39;t really care. He looks up at me with a sheepish grin, then quickly looks away. Then suddenly, he stumbles directly in front of me! He doesn&#39;t fall to the ground, but does bump into me. <br />
<br />
As soon as he bumped into me, everything quickly went black for a millisecond, then I was able to see clearly again. I&#39;m falling to the ground, getting ready for the impact. I see a tall woman in front of me, falling backwards, wearing the same outfit I was wearing. <br />
<br />
We both land really hard. I landed directly on top of her, expecting that young boy to also fall on top of me. But no such thing happens. I quickly pop back up to apologise to the woman I landed on. As I hop back up onto my feet, I quickly notice everything seemed....wrong!<br />
<br />
For one, I&#39;m no longer wearing heels. Instead, I have black and white Converse shoes on my feet. I&#39;m wearing blue jeans, and a plain white T-shirt. Looking down, my chest has shrunk, and my arms, hands, and fingers appear on the thicker side. My finger nails looked....strange. And the fingertips shaped differently. <br />
<br />
Heart pounding, I grab my chest. Or at least, I try to. I can only pat the flat chest I now have. I then quickly run up and down my body, looking at completely different clothes from the ones I was wearing just a moment ago! The woman I fell on top of completely forgotten for the time-being. <br />
<br />
The clothes covering my body is something that a....teenaged boy would be wearing.....the clothes that that kinda cute young dark curly-haired teenaged boy that stumbled into me was wearing.<br />
<br />
I then noticed how sharp my eyesight was. I was able to see much clearer than I ever was before! Then I felt.....wierd. I felt wierd....down there! I stop feeling myself and patting my body, and let my arms drop to my sides, palms out, and bit away from this foreign body i now apparently occupy. I stand there, arms at my sides, arms out, palms out, and look directly down at myself. I see the clothes that boy was wearing, but most of all, I see a big bulge in front and a strange, foreign feeling coming from there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God&quot; I half whisper in shock and disbelief. I slowly look over at the woman I ran into and fell on top of. Wearing my clothes. Long, blond luscious hair. Ample chest. My 1 inch heels. With my heart pounding in my chest, I can only stand there, mouth open, staring. <br />
<br />
Her eyes are closed, and I notice some blood coming out of her cute, petite little nose. MY nose, as a matter of fact! It appears that &quot;she&quot; has been knocked unconscious! <br />
<br />
Finally, i was snapped out of my reverie and noticed a crowd had formed around us. I saw someone come over to....whoever was occupying my body, and attending to it! Her eyes slowly fluttered open, and &quot;she&quot; began to sit up. The man that was attending to &quot;her,&quot; was asking if she was alright.<br />
<br />
Then I heard her say:<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. I&#39;m fine. That little brat over there knocked me over and I hit my head!&quot; she said, pointing directly at me. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I saw what happened,&quot; said someone.  &quot;He stumbled into her, and knocked her over.&quot; Also pointing in my direction.<br />
<br />
&quot;He!?&quot; Thought I.....<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we need to call for paramedics to make sure this young lady is fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
She tries to stand, but the man tells her to just sit still, as she hit her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine, I&#39;m fine!&quot; she says, insisting on standing up. She stands up onto her....my....heels, and walks towards me with all the natural grace and beauty I apparently once had. She stands a good half a head over me! My head coming up to her nose.<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to watch where you&#39;re going next time, kid!&quot; she berated me!<br />
<br />
&quot;Kid? Kid!?&quot; I think.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, sorry,&quot; I mumble, like a stupid awkward teenage boy would do after knocking over a drop-dead gorgeous corporate executive with millions to spend.<br />
<br />
Still standing there in a stupor, I can only stare at her chest. She begins to walk away, pulling my cellphone out of my bag! And still, I stand there, staring after her. Mouth agape. Looking at her amazing tight ass! <br />
<br />
Most of the crowd of people disperses, while the man walks with her to make sure she was ok.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine. But I have to call my fiancee now,&quot; she says as she continues walking away. High heels clicking on the smooth tiled mall floor. <br />
<br />
Ignoring her, I look down at my own body. A body I&#39;m now stuck with. I can only stand there, in muted shock, looking over my thicker-looking arms, hands, and fingers. Looking down at my jean-clad shorter legs. At the disgusting black and white Converse boy&#39;s shoes covering my feet. <br />
<br />
With heart pounding and dread in my stomach, I go to find a bathroom. Thinking to myself that this isn&#39;t real. Struggling to remain calm and act normal. <br />
<br />
Walking i...different. I find myself with a different gait. I don&#39;t swing my hips back and forth, especially when not wearing any heels. <br />
<br />
I find the bathrooms. Luckily, this mall now has unisex bathrooms. Otherwise, I would have automatically entered the woman&#39;s room.<br />
<br />
I take a peek inside. &quot;Good. No-one in here,&quot; I sigh with relief. <br />
<br />
Walking over to the mirrors, my heart racing even more, I turn the corner. I see the mirrors to the side. I ever so slowly approach them. Not wanting to look into them, terrified at what I might find. <br />
<br />
But I gotta do it. I step in front of the mirror, and turn to face it. There, in absolute shock, I&#39;m mortified to see that strange young boy&#39;s face, with his messy curly brown hair, brown eyes, with a broadly-shaped nose, and an adams apple sticking out of his neck. <br />
<br />
I slowly approach the mirror. My new sharp eyesight taking it all in. I slowly raise my new boyish right hand to touch my boyish new face. The image in the mirror did the same. I then touched my hair, and the boy in the mirror did the same. <br />
<br />
With tears beginning to leak out of my now-chocolately brown eyes, I look down at myself again. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a boy?&quot; I whisper. &quot;Oh my God, I&#39;ve been turned into a boy! I switched bodies with a random boy!&quot; <br />
<br />
Looking back at the mirror in denial, I see that boy&#39;s face yet again. That plain white T-shirt he was wearing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m....a....boy....&quot; I look back down again. Repeating the phrase:<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a boy. OMG. I have the body of a.....&quot;then I swallow really hard....&quot;A BOY!&quot;<br />
<br />
I reach down, fully aware of what that means. Sure enough, I felt a lump behind the zipper of the jeans I&#39;m currently wearing. And that lump...that.....THING!....came alive!</p>
