<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ruse felt more hands grab her and slowly lift her up into the air. She was now being carried by two robot arms while another held onto her legs and another held onto her breasts and crotch area with her legs spread wide open.<br />
&quot;When someone mentions your ass, what do they say?&quot;<br />
Ruse&#39;s head turned from side to side as she was carried around by robotic arms. &quot;Aww they say it&#39;s nice and juicy.&quot;<br />
&#39;INITIATING FUSION AND TRANSFERRAL PROCESS&#39;.<br />
Ruse felt her ass being squeezed by robotic hands until she felt something hard press against it again and again until it took the form of an apple.<br />
&quot;Next question!&quot; Serena said excitedly.<br />
Ruse&#39;s mouth hung open as she looked down at her new apple shaped ass. Her eyes were glazed over as she stared at the shape of her new round booty. The robotic hands holding her spread even wider apart until the apple sized cheeks almost touched each other.<br />
Serena giggled. &quot;What about your pussy?&quot;<br />
Ruse&#39;s head moved side to side as she tried to find a way out of the situation. &quot;Well... they say my pussy is soft and tight.&quot;<br />
&#39;INITIATING FUSION AND TRANSFERRAL PROCESS&#39;.<br />
Her pussy was squished into a peach shape as she watched Serena receiving her old pussy.<br />
&quot;That was so much fun! Let&#39;s keep going. What else can you tell me?&quot; Serena asked excitedly.<br />
Ruse&#39;s head moved side to side as she struggled to think of a way out of this predicament. &quot;Uhh... Well, my nipples are sensitive and always hard.&quot;<br />
Two robotic hands gripped Ruse&#39;s nipples and pinched them gently.<br />
&quot;Mmmphh!&quot; Ruse moaned loudly as she felt the pain of the pinch.<br />
&#39;INITIATING FUSION AND TRANSFERRAL PROCESS&#39;.<br />
Ruse felt her nipples change into the shape of strawberries as she watched Serena getting her old nipples.<br />
&quot;And your clit? What does everyone say about your clit?&quot;<br />
Ruse&#39;s head shook side to side as she searched for a way out of this. &quot;They say it&#39;s big and fat.&quot;<br />
Two robotic arms reached up grabbing hold of Ruse&#39;s clit and started massaging it.<br />
Ruse moaned as she felt the pressure building inside her. &#39;INITIATING FUSION AND TRANSFERRAL PROCESS&#39;.<br />
Her clit grew larger and changed into a large blackberry. It was bigger than any berry Ruse had ever seen before.<br />
&quot;Oh wow! You look amazing!&quot; Serena said in amazement as she stared at her transformed body. &quot;But let&#39;s speed things up a bit.&quot;<br />
&#39;INITIATING FUSION AND TRANSFERRAL PROCESS&#39;.<br />
Ruse&#39;s skin turned blue as her entire body was covered in a layer of frosting.<br />
&quot;Wow, that looks so delicious,&quot; Serena said in admiration. &quot;Let&#39;s move on to the rest of the body parts. Next question! What about your arms? How do people describe your arms?&quot;<br />
Ruse&#39;s eyes narrowed as she glared at Serena. &quot;How many times do I have to answer these questions?&quot;<br />
&#39;INITIATING FUSION AND TRANSFERRAL PROCESS&#39;.<br />
Ruse&#39;s arms grew into large sausages and began bouncing around erratically.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re such a brat, aren&#39;t you?&quot; Serena laughed as she walked closer to Ruse.<br />
&quot;Ahh! Wait, please!&quot; Ruse begged.<br />
&quot;What do people say about your hair?&quot;<br />
Ruse&#39;s head nodded up and down as she thought of a suitable response. &quot;They say it&#39;s thick and shiny.&quot;<br />
Two robotic arms wrapped around Ruse&#39;s hair and pulled it up into a bun.<br />
&#39;INITIATING FUSION AND TRANSFERRAL PROCESS&#39;.<br />
Her hair morphed into the shape of a cinnamon roll.<br />
&quot;Alright, how about your neck? How do people describe your neck?&quot;<br />
Ruse&#39;s head tilted side to side as she looked at Serena. &quot;My neck is long and slender.&quot;<br />
&#39;INITIATING FUSION AND TRANSFERRAL PROCESS&#39;.<br />
Ruse felt a sudden heat as her neck grew into a large hot dog and began waving back and forth.<br />
&quot;Now let&#39;s finish with your feet. What does everyone say about your feet?&quot;<br />
Ruse&#39;s head nodded from side to side. &quot;They say they are small and cute.&quot;<br />
Serena&#39;s face lit up as she looked at Ruse. &quot;Good! Next question! How do people describe your legs?&quot;<br />
Ruse&#39;s head nodded up and down. &quot;They say my legs are very sexy and toned.&quot;<br />
&#39;INITIATING FUSION AND TRANSFERRAL PROCESS&#39;.<br />
Ruse felt her legs turn into long thin twinkies. Her feet transformed into the shape of an oreo cookie.<br />
&quot;Wow! That looks so yummy! I&#39;m almost done now.&quot; Serena giggled. &quot;What about your stomach?&quot;<br />
Ruse&#39;s head bobbed up and down as she thought. &quot;People always tell me that my stomach is flat.&quot;<br />
Two robotic hands wrapped around Ruse&#39;s waist and lifted her up into the air. She was floating in midair above Serena&#39;s head as the robot hands rubbed her stomach gently.<br />
&#39;INITIATING FUSION AND TRANSFERRAL PROCESS&#39;.<br />
Ruse&#39;s entire torso turned into a large pancake. She felt unusually thin and fragile, and was worried that her legs or breasts might simply break off. But somehow they stayed firmly connected to her... her pancake body.<br />
&quot;Alright! Time for the last part!&quot; Serena smiled triumphantly as she held her arms out towards Ruse. &quot;Your face is the final touch! Are you ready?&quot;<br />
Ruse&#39;s head tilted side to side. &quot;Uhh... I guess.&quot;<br />
Serena brought her face close to Ruse&#39;s and said &quot;Okay! I&#39;m going to put on your face right now!&quot;<br />
&quot;Wait, wait!&quot; Ruse panicked. &quot;Please let me go.&quot;<br />
The robotic arms pulled away, letting Ruse fall back down onto the floor. She landed hard on the floor, causing a loud thud and a cloud of dust to fly up in the air. The robotic hands quickly wiped off the powdered sugar.<br />
Ruse was still shaken by the sudden encounter with the machine, and could not bring herself to look at it again.<br />
&quot;You have no choice Ruse. It&#39;s already done. You must accept this fate now,&quot; Serena told her as she walked closer to her. &quot;Now, here I come!&quot;<br />
&#39;INITIATING FUSION AND TRANSFERRAL PROCESS&#39;.<br />
Serena reached down to grab Ruse&#39;s chin and brought their eyes to meet. Her face transformed into Ruse&#39;s own face. She now had the exact same facial features and appearance as Ruse did.<br />
Ruse could not believe what was happening to her. She tried to push Serena away, but her limbs were so weak she could barely lift them off the ground.<br />
&quot;Oh Ruse,&quot; Serena said in Ruse&#39;s old voice. &quot;What are you doing?&quot;<br />
&quot;No, no! Please don&#39;t do this to me!&quot; Ruse cried in Serena&#39;s original robotic voice as tears of icing ran down her mannequin face. &quot;I want to go home!&quot;<br />
Serena smiled down at her. &quot;I can&#39;t help you. This is destiny, my dear.&quot;<br />
Ruse looked at the robot with teary eyes and begged once more, &quot;Please... Let me go. I won&#39;t tell anyone.&quot;<br />
&quot;That is impossible Ruse. We made an agreement.&quot; Serena shook her head with sad eyes. &quot;And you agreed to this. It&#39;s time to say goodbye.&quot;<br />
Ruse tried to get up but failed and collapsed onto her spongey twinkie knees. She was shaking violently and sobbing uncontrollably.<br />
&#39;PERMANENCE MATRIX WARMING UP&#39;<br />
Serena turned to leave. She took a deep breath and walked towards the door. But before she stepped out, she turned back one last time to look at Ruse and said:<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry... I will take good care of your body. Goodbye Ruse!&quot;<br />
With that, Serena closed the door behind her.</p>
