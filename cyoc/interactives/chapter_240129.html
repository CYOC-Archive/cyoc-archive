<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The labtop&#39;s LED lights continued to whirl and click after JuDeeDee left the desk; the program&#39;s work was now nearly complete. Mike and Judy Mitchell, their two sons, their younger daughter, and a pair of friends of both the younger younger son and daughter had all been transformed into clowns. Only to, well, victims remained: the older daughter Kara and her boyfriend Greg Allston....<br />
<br />
___________________________________________<br />
<br />
Said couple was in Greg&#39;s van, parked in the Mitchell family&#39;s driveway. Inside said van, a queen sized mattress was laid down. Curtains were pulled behind the tinted windows and windshield, making it completely dark inside. And underneath the blankets on the mattress, Kara and Grreg were basking in the pot-induced aftermath of love making.<br />
&quot;That was-awsome,&quot; Greg breathed oout; his voice was so low neither he nor Kara noticed how creaky it sounded.<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; answered Kara, likewise not noticing her voice was nowsomewhat lower, and a bit squeaky. <br />
 Greg stood up , then clapped his hands. The lights in the van came on, and now Kara and Greg looked at each other, their eyes opened wide with shock as they loo. It was all they could do not to scream.<br />
For starters, both of them were now, well, fat. Kara&#39;s formerlly shapley. voluptious body had to have gained nearly a hundred pounds; her already ample breasts were now at least a size triple D, swollen with fat, and resting on a noticable beer gut. Her arms and legs were thick with fat as well, and she had a double chin. If anything, Greg was even fatter. <br />
And that was the least of their changes.<br />
Kara&#39;s ivory complexion was now a dull, slightly ruddy pink, and she had white around the hollows of her eyes and mouth. Her lips inside her white muzzle were now a dull grey-blue, and turned down in a slight frown. Her eyebrows were now arched grey lines high on her forehead that added to the shocked look on Kara&#39;s face, lines almost like wrinkles showed on her face and her blonde hair was now matted with black tips and streaks of grey. Kara&#39;s feet were also nearly three times as long, and at the very center of her face, her nose was now swollen and bulbous, and red as if she&#39;d been drinking.<br />
Greg&#39;s changes were even drastic. His skin was how a dull orange, with even more exaggerated patches of white around his eyes and a white muzzle around his mouth, which was also turned down in a mournful expression. Black had appeared over his chin and cheeks like a very dark stubble, and his nose was big and round as a tennis ball, and black as coal. Greg&#39;s feet were big and almost as wide as swimming flippers; he&#39;d have a rather awkward time walking in them with his new girth.<br />
And on his head, Greg&#39;s hair was a thick, curly fringe surrounding a pate as smooth and bald as an egg.<br />
They felt their own and each other&#39;s faces, looked in the mirror, and Kara rubbed her boyfriend&#39;s bald spot. They both squeezed their bulbous nosews; Kara&#39;s didn&#39;t do anything but Greg&#39;s gave out a loud WHOO-WHOO! like a foghorn.<br />
&quot;Are we-are we still high?&quot; Kara asked, suddenly now aware of the change to her voice as well as her body. And what was it with this strange depression they both felt; sex and weed usually made them both giddy not down.<br />
POOF! Suddenly Kellbelle, that fairy who sometimes appeared to Kara whenever she was stoned appeared. Only now Greg saw her too. And Kellebelle now was dressed like a clown.<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; the fairy replied,  her voice souned higher and squeakier than usual. The squeezed her own bulbous red nose. Honk! &quot;Yes, you too are both high. But unlike me, you two potheads turning into clowns aint  hallucinataions!&quot; She giggled and honked her nose again. <br />
&quot;How did this happen?&quot; Greg said in his comiccaly creaky voice.<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t tell you that, baldy,&quot; Kellebelle chortled. &quot;All I can say is that it&#39;s not just you. Kara&#39;s entire family has turned into clowns-different kinds of clowns than you. So did two frinds of your youngest brother Pete-only now he&#39;s a happy hobo who goes by PeeWee-and of your little sister.<br />
&quot;But now I gotta tell you, you two are a sad hobo and sad bag lady clowns-the very lowest of the low. You Kara, now act as the family maid having to keep the house clean and all the house chores. And you Greg, in exchange for Kara&#39;s family allowing you to live in you van on their driveway, have to mow the grass, clean the gutters, rake the leaves and all the other dirty and lowly jobs. Both of you will now always smell of moldy weed no matter how much you shower, and you have the metabolisms of pigs. You can&#39;t go below your current weight and if you eat anything besides beans and cabbage you&#39;ll gain even more weight and have to pracically starve yourself to lose it. And you both will be the butt of whatever antics and jokes Kara&#39;s family and other clowns pull on you! And both of you will always feel somewhat depressed from now on, not even getting stoned will lift you out. If anything, pot will only make you both more depressed.&quot;<br />
Kellebelle honked her nose again, and with another POOF! she vanished in a cloud of pink smoke.<br />
Now Kara and Greg looked to where they had tossed their clothes. Kara&#39;s bra and panties were now plain and black; instead of her crop top and shorts a faded grey dress and ragged beige shawl lay rumpled on the floor. Greg&#39;s clothes were changed too, a dull red and white striped turtleneck with black vest and paints lay under a tiny bolwer hat with a red band. Next to the clothing pile were two pairs of Doc Martins perfecttly sized to fit Kara And Greg&#39;s new clown feet.<br />
As much as they would have like to, Kara and Greg knew they couldn&#39;t stay inside the van forever. They got dressed, and stepped outside the van....</p>
