<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;This is so fucking weird, but I need the extra credit.  So here I am alone in my bedroom with the infamous <br />
&quot;Human Jockstrap.&quot;  No, I don't believe the story that it used to be a guy.  I'm not sure what to think. The <br />
general opinion is that the guy when he was human died, and somehow his soul became trapped in this jockstrap. <br />
Someone may have done it to him.  No body was found, so that suggests foul play.  There's another theory.  He <br />
was a shared compression short.  Guys don't like sharing jockstraps, but a jockstrap that's a compression <br />
short is somehow different.  One theory is that he was worn by so many guys that he somehow became embedded <br />
with bits of them.  This second theory is supported by the fact that he seems to be unconscious except when <br />
being worn.  So A the jockstrap is possessed with a human spirit, or B it's some sort of poltergeist animated <br />
by the angst of teenage jocks.  Either way it's an interesting subject for my Paranormal Studies class, and I <br />
need to raise my GPA with the extra credit so I can stay on the team,&quot; the 20 year old football player said <br />
into his iPhone which was in record mode. He cleared his throat, &quot;Now to put him on and begin the interview.&quot;<br />
<br />
You have already read a portion of the interview so far in the previous chapter.  It continues below:<br />
<br />
Q.  So were you gay or straight before you became a jockstrap?<br />
<br />
A.  Why do you ask?<br />
<br />
Q.  Hey, did I hit a nerve?<br />
<br />
A.  Some of the guys in the past said that I became a jockstrap because I secretly wanted to wrap myself <br />
around real men's junk. But I remember girls, lots of 'em.<br />
<br />
Q.  Yeah, I bet. Um, you've been worn by a lot of guys, what's the longest one guy wore you.  I, mean, you <br />
said you never have to be taken off and washed, so was it a week or month or year or more?<br />
<br />
A.  I'm not good at telling time now, but I remember Jerry Calliastro. He was superstitious, and wouldn't take <br />
me off all season. I really liked that. I guess 3-6 months.  <br />
<br />
Q.  Calliastro?  He disappeared almost right after he took you off.<br />
<br />
A.  He did?  How? Why?  What happened?<br />
<br />
Q.  Just disappeared.  Several college jocks that wore you have gone missing, and there are new jockstraps <br />
claiming to be humans. Not all are compression shorts.  Do you think you're contagious?<br />
<br />
A.  No, I can't be. I'm just a compression short with a built in athletic supporter.  If you thought I was <br />
contagious, why are you wearing me?<br />
<br />
Q.  Uh, well. Um, man, I can't think I'm so horny. I need to take a break.<br />
<br />
Hey, I know this recording sounds like I'm talking to myself, but the compression short speaks through my <br />
mind, so to transcribe it I have to sort of let it possess me to use my voice to repeat its thoughts. It's a <br />
really weird feeling. Oh, and don't worry, I took the shorts off and put them in Rubbermade box.  I'm sweating <br />
like a pig too.  Don't know if that's a side-effect of wearing those things, or of being horny.  Maybe the <br />
hornyness is the side effect.  Maybe all the guys who wore it, jacked off in it. Calliastro almost certainly <br />
did, if he wore it 3 months straight.  People sort of took the jockstrap for granted until there started being <br />
more of them, and the jocks who had worn it started disappearing. Were they really becoming jockstraps?  I <br />
don't think so, but maybe their souls were transmigrating into jockstraps after they committed suicide.  I, <br />
mean, another voice inside you, sort of controlling you, I could see a guy becoming suicidal after wearing <br />
that thing for a while. Or maybe they're comatose somewhere and animating the other jockstraps like <br />
poltergeists or maybe their so called disappearances are totally unrelated to the new jockstraps.  Maybe guys <br />
who wore this one are somehow sharing it with other jockstraps that they've worn since then.  Oh, damn, I've <br />
been sitting on the toilet this whole time jacking off, and I still cannot cum.  Well, at least it's soft now. <br />
A little precum leaking, I wonder how he'll react if I don't wipe it off.<br />
<br />
The sound of air rushing into a tupperware container.  Time to resume the interview.<br />
<br />
Q.  Hey, I'm back.  Miss me?  What was it like without me inside you?<br />
<br />
The interviewer watches the wet spot expand over the fabric of his crotch, and quickly vanish.<br />
<br />
A.  Well, I guess you'd say it was like going to sleep, and waking up for breakfast.<br />
<br />
Q.  Whoa!  Did you just shrink?<br />
<br />
A.  That's ridiculous, you know you grew.  You're getting hard. It's okay, every guy who wears me does.  It's <br />
okay if you want to blow your load inside me.  Guys call it christening me.  Let me help.<br />
<br />
Q.  Hey, that's my hand you're moving.  That's not possible.  I must be moving it. you're just a jockstrap.<br />
<br />
A.  Right, I'm just a jockstrap, and you and I are moving it together.  That's why guys like to wear me, and <br />
why coaches want guys to wear me. I improve their game.  I was quite a jock when I was human. I remember being <br />
MVP, and winning trophies for different sports. Now that I'm a jockstrap, I support other guys in being the <br />
best they can be.<br />
<br />
Q.  You were the best jock you could be?  And now you're the best jock-strap? Heh, heh. Oh, I uh, oh....<br />
<br />
Lots of moans, groans and cries of ecstasy for several minutes.<br />
<br />
I cannot believe I let that thing take control of me. Best sex I ever had - alone I mean. I blew three loads <br />
into that Spandex and cotton thing before I peeled him - it off.  Just got back from the shower.  I really <br />
should have turned the recorder off sooner. Now I've got a lot of editing to do.  <br />
<br />
The towel wrapped jock picks up the jockstrap, and examines it.  <br />
<br />
Completely clean and dry. Amazing!<br />
<br />
Maybe if I put him on this time and head down for a workout, scratch that. People will think I'm a weird guy <br />
talking to myself.  I know.<br />
<br />
He goes to his closet and pulls out a pull up bar for the door, a pilates mat, and some hand weights. I'll do <br />
a workout here.  Well back to the interview and the extra credit.<br />
<br />
The detective looked up from the computer and rubbed his eyes. He looked at his partner across the desk, and <br />
said, &quot;This missing jock is a total loon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but you've heard the rumors about the haunted jockstrap before.  And his teacher did give him <br />
permission to &quot;interview it.&quot;  And he is missing, and so is his iPhone.  Lucky for us, he had his webcam <br />
recording everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lucky?  I just had to watch this horny kid jack off while talking to himself.  Forty Five minutes worth at <br />
least.  And how many more hours of recordings?  30, 50, 400?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well, you get back to watching and let me know,&quot; said the man across the desk as he got up and headed <br />
to the break room for coffee.  He murmured to himself, &quot;It's good to be the senior partner.&quot;</p>
