<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I chose door 4, after looking at each room and noticing that room 4’s lights were on, and the drapes on the windows were open. I figured that meant that whoever was in the room might be accepting to a visitor.<br />
<br />
As I got even closer to the door, I could see through the window and saw Leah, wearing a large t-shirt but no visible pants. <br />
<br />
Damn, she was hot. I think she knew it, too, but it seemed to me that any personality flaws would have to be tolerated. I could tell from watching her at dinner that she had curves in all the right places and lips that begged to be kissed.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, our eyes met. Crap, she caught me staring. Again. But then she smiled, as if she was enjoying the attention she was receiving. And why not? We were out in the middle of nowhere, where she was the only female, and only one guy seemed to be giving her any attention.<br />
<br />
Leah opened the door. Sure enough, the t-shirt she was wearing stopped just below her panty line, and her smooth, shapely legs were exposed. A little muscle was nice, and you could tell she must have played sports in school, or at least she was a runner. Her hair was pulled back in a ponytail, and, though she must have removed her makeup while getting ready for bed, her face still had a healthy glow to it.<br />
<br />
“Kevin, right?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah… I’m Kevin.” Ok, stupid, what was it you were going to ask? “Can I come in?”<br />
<br />
“Sure, Kevin. Sorry I’m kind of under-dressed.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I don’t mind.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, I’m sure… so where are you from?”<br />
<br />
“Well, I am in school in San Francisco, but I’m going home for the weekend in Portland.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, cool, so you had to stop off here for the night?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I guess this was my only option.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, but I’ve stayed here lots of times, and it looks sketchy at first, but then you find out that it’s a… magical place…”<br />
<br />
Magical? People say that, but there’s really no such thing as magic. Right? By now we were both sitting on the edge of the bed, and I was enjoying this opportunity to know Leah better. So I continued our conversation.<br />
<br />
“I can tell. That dinner was amazing.”<br />
<br />
“And it’s like that every time. I’ve never had a bad meal here.”<br />
<br />
“That’s awesome. The only problem is that they gave me a key to room 6, and I can’t find it…”<br />
<br />
Leah smiled at me. “Yeah, they gave me room 6 the first time I was here. I never did find it.”<br />
<br />
“So… you can’t really help me, I guess.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I can help you. Not with the room, but with… other things…”<br />
<br />
Leah leaned in and started to kiss me. It had been a while since I had made out with someone. I had a girlfriend in high school, but had not connected with anyone in my first year of college. But it did not take long to remember how <br />
to do it, especially since I was locking lips with such a sexy woman.<br />
<br />
“Oh, Kevin, you’re gonna be perfect…”<br />
<br />
“What do you mean?”<br />
<br />
“I mean, we’re gonna have some fun… you’ll be a new man before you know it.”<br />
<br />
I felt like Leah was speaking in riddles, but her erotic nature was too much for me to overcome and think rationally.<br />
<br />
Leah put her hands on my crotch, and she was able to rub the outline of my hard dick. She looked into my eyes and smiled.<br />
<br />
“Not bad for starters. Definitely something we can work with.”<br />
<br />
Her words still sounded strange to me, but every time, just as I started thinking about what she could mean, she would draw my attention back to our lewd actions.<br />
<br />
She began to pull her t-shirt over her head. I followed suit, and she explored my chest with her hands as I reached behind her and unhooked her bra. I pulled her bra off, revealing two firm, bouncy breasts that were about as big as her compact frame could handle. I knelt down and began to lick each of her dark, pert nipples.<br />
<br />
“Oh, Kevin, that’s hot. Don’t go falling in love with these, though.”<br />
<br />
“Mmm… why not?”<br />
<br />
“Well… you’ll find out soon. Now let me see your beautiful body.”<br />
<br />
Leah began to rub her hand up and down my stomach, as if it were a washboard. I didn’t have washboard abs, in fact, I barely had any muscle there at all.<br />
<br />
“Mmm… you’d look great with a six-pack.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, that takes a lot of work though.”<br />
<br />
“I used to think that, too… but some guys just get... lucky.” She moved her hands up to my flat chest and placed each hand over my nipples. “I think you’d like having some bigger pecs… not like man-boobs, but, you know, slabs… of muscle…” Leah’s eyes rolled back as she moaned softly and imagined a more muscled me.<br />
<br />
Leah had succeeded, not only in slightly confusing me, but also in arousing me. I had to get out of my pants and I had to do something with my cock.<br />
<br />
As I quickly fumbled with the buttons and zippers on my pants, Leah leapt up from the bed and went to the window. She looked out intently and then literally jumped for joy as she turned back around and looked at me.<br />
<br />
“The moon is coming out! It’s time!”<br />
<br />
Leah stepped out of her panties and grabbed my hard dick. She was in full control of the situation, and, for now, I was ok with that.</p>
