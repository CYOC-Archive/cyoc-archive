<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aaron sprung back to consciousness and found himself listening to Wyatt&#39;s admission of his perversion again.  Just as Wyatt said, &quot;I want to have fun. I want to make my own choices. I want to be able to like who I like even if that&#39;s you Aaron.&quot;<br />
<br />
He felt his own voice, say in a similar impassioned tone, &quot;I the same thing as you. I want to be able to love who I want, and who I want is you, Wyatt.  Haven&#39;t you noticed how I&#39;ve looked at you? Haven&#39;t you noticed how my eyes lingered too long, how I always seemed so quiet around you? It&#39;s because I was trying to hide my feelings.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron felt the words come out of his mouth but he hadn&#39;t willed them.  He hadn&#39;t said them or intended them. He had meant to tell both of these creeps where and how they could fuck off to but the words had come unbidden.  Aaron caught the glint in Chuck&#39;s eyes and knew that the man was manipulating all of this. He continued, &quot;My problem was that I was always embarrassed about my body.&quot; He said, the words coming from his mouth like a radio playing through his jaw, his glances and expressions operating like a puppet&#39;s, &quot;Now, I just hope that Chuck would find it in his heart to change me in ways that you would like and not make me someone or something that you would despise.&quot;<br />
<br />
Arron wanted to barf, to scream, to tell both Elder Wyatt and Chuck where they could go, and what they could do.  <br />
<br />
&quot;The truth is, I&#39;ve always been a bottom, meaning, I&#39;ve always wanted other men to, you know, use me.&quot; Aaron felt himself say the words and now, he knew un his heart the depths of Chuck&#39;s evil.  He was going to use Wyatt, to turn him into a freak.  <br />
<br />
Wyatt looked in the mirror again at Chuck&#39;s thick cock and said, &quot;If that&#39;s what you want, it&#39;s fine with me, I just want to be with you no matter what.&quot;<br />
<br />
If it hadn&#39;t been so sickening, Aaron would have felt bad for the other Elder.  He believed this to be true.  Wyatt thought Aaron was  confessing not only his desire for him but his true feelings, his &quot;kinks&quot; as some of the non-LDS kids had described it.  <br />
<br />
Both boys looked expectantly at Chuck, both their eyes filled with hope, only one of them believing it.   <br />
<br />
Chuck for his part was a great actor.  He said, &quot;Well boys, that&#39;s not the deal I struck with you but I&#39;m sure we can come up with something that would work.  Wyatt, since Aaron&#39;s so accepting of this process, why don&#39;t you tell me what you&#39;d like.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chuck had said the words to Wyatt but he hadn&#39;t moved his eyes to look away from Aaron. Behind his accommodating demeanor was a gaze of steel.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;ve always liked tall dark manly men. Oh, Aaron, do you remember Elder Stevens, he was so tall and broad, and so strict.  He kept clean shaven but he always seemed to have a bit of stubble.&quot; Wyatt said, his mind racing.  <br />
<br />
Aaron was stunned.  He hadn&#39;t expected this kind of degeneracy.  This level of indecency.  Moments ago, both of them were standing there at the mercy of a relative stranger and now Wyatt was announcing how one of the men from the church had turned him on.   It&#39;s like the young man had no shame. It made him sick.   &quot;Oh yeah, I remember him.&quot; Aaron said with a lusty smile.  <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what I thought of when I saw that thick pelt of hair and that big cock of yours.&quot; Wyatt said, smiling broadly.  <br />
<br />
Aaron wanted to blush but instead he said, &quot;I bet you want me to give you a couple of talks like he did.&quot; That was gross.  Elder Stevens had always focused on topics of morality.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I love you the way you are, but if you looked more like him, it would really be a turn on for me.&quot; Wyatt said hopefully.  <br />
<br />
Wyatt gasped as the hair that had covered Aaron&#39;s torso had dispersed itself across his body.  <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s awesome! Wyatt said, &quot;Also, if you could look a bit more rugged.&quot;<br />
<br />
These changes were a bit more subtle. Arron&#39;s farmer&#39;s tan deepened into a full body glow, his face lost some of its boyish appearance and his jaw became more chiseled. His hands became calloused and his body seemed to expand under the weight of some muscle.  He grew a bit taller so now he stood about six or seven inches taller than Wyatt was.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Want me to take back some of that cock since he said he was such a bottom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,  even if he doesn&#39;t want to use it, I like to look at it.&quot; Wyatt said, licking his lips again.  <br />
<br />
Chuck smiled.  This boy and he had a lot in common. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, let me finish up a few more changes,&quot; Chuck said, &quot;You might be good at what you think looks good but I can offer a broader perspective.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wyatt didn&#39;t say anything.  He was too busy looking at Aaron with excitement.  His cock, once flaccid with fear, now full on boned looking at his former friend and coworker&#39;s transformation.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Aaron gasped as he felt his weight shift.   His body automatically compensating for an increased weight on his ass, he couldn&#39;t see it, but he felt the two meaty globes pushing out from his waist, turning into a massive bubble.  Even worse, was the cold air that seemed to come from no where as his ass reshaped itself, his hole now gaping.  <br />
<br />
Chuck knew Aaron couldn&#39;t see what was going on but he would realize it soon enough.  His ass was a monstrous set of two bowling balls and his asshole could now only be described as a dripping man cunt.  <br />
<br />
Chuck clicked a few more tabs and clothes appeared on Aaron.  A pair of daisy duke like denim shorts appeared on him, to small to be buttoned at the waist.  A pair of thick suspenders appeared on them, doing their best to fight against gravity and hold the shorts up.  <br />
<br />
Without any underwear, one of Aaron&#39;s hairy balls was hanging out of the shorts. The other and his cock, nestled tightly in place for now.  A pair of timberland boots and long socks appeared on Aaron&#39;s feet.  A flannel shirt with its sleeves removed draped over Aaron&#39;s shoulders, unbuttoned so his now fuzzy but well defined torso could be on display, the shirt actually held open by Aaron&#39;s pointer than appropriate nipples.  <br />
<br />
Aaron fought back a scream.  He looked like a damn homo version of the brawny man.   <br />
<br />
But instead of screaming, he said to Wyatt, &quot;Damn I look good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chuck motioned to Aaron, anything you&#39;d like to see changed about Wyatt?&quot;<br />
<br />
Once again, Aaron spoke without willing it. &quot;Wyatt is perfect as he is, &quot;he smiled sweetly, &quot;but, maybe give him a dick that can really give this ass what it needs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron wanted to die as he said it but Wyatt just grinned, feeling his cock expand out from his torso, growing to a few inches longer than even Aaron&#39;s enhanced pole.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Boys, I&#39;m glad this could be a happy ending.&quot; Chuck said, still smiling broadly.  <br />
<br />
Aaron and Wyatt both grinned.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t you two go upstairs and do some exploring in the guest room.  I&#39;m sure you each have a lot to learn about the other.&quot;</p>
