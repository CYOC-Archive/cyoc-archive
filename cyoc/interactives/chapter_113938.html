<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For the first time since he was a Spetnaz, Chelnik was afraid; shocked at how fast the werewolf he was fighting was moving as she lunged at him. Using every ounce of strength within him, Chelnik was able to redirect her attack away from him; yet having to physically push her away almost sapped his strength. All it did was have agent Reed growl as she grabs Chelnik’s arm, twisting it as she runs past. Unable to strike her with his knife as the hand he held it was being wrenched by the white furred werewolf; forcing him to drop it as he gasps in pain.<br />
<br />
Re-positioning herself; agent Reed lunges at Chelnik again, this time knocking him down onto the ground. Taking care not to strike him with her claws; agent Reed knew that a single scratch would bestow upon the man she is fighting the same lycanthropic gifts her boyfriend joyfully gave her several months ago. Yet she knew she was clearly stronger and faster than the man, so used that to her advantage. Watching Chelnik scrambling to get back up; grabbing the ballistic knife he dropped earlier; agent reed sees the scar on the man&#39;s right eye. Smiling as she knew he was blind in that eye, the milky white orb looking lifeless; she shifts herself to keep to his blind side.<br />
<br />
Chelnik swore; his dark sunglasses now broken, noticing agent Reed moving to his right. She saw his bad eye; a gift from some shrapnel he received that forced him out of the Russian Special Forces, causing him to ply his trade as a mercenary and then as a hitman for a mobster. Having to turn his head slightly so as to keep agent Reed in view; Chelnik knew he needed to end the fight soon or it would be his last. Deciding to go on the offensive, he changes up the way he is holding onto his knife and lunges towards the werewolf.<br />
<br />
Agent Reed seeing the man’s desperation, she deftly dodges Chelnik’s attack. Making sure to remain on his blindside, she uses the opportunity to strike the man with a vicious punch to his kidneys. Hearing the impact her fist made, she knew bones were cracked and that Chelnik had to have felt that. Seeing him spin around wildly, flailing his knife towards her direction; agent Reed knew he was panicking.<br />
“You have no hope against a were Chelnik;” agent Reed growling; “accept it.”<br />
“I will not roll over and die for any one,” Chelnik gasping for air; the punch he received doing more damage to him than either realized. “Least of all to a bitch like you,” Chelnik uttering in his native Ukranian; spying the gun he was force to drop earlier, he dives towards it.<br />
<br />
Agent Reed seeing what Chelnik is aiming for lunges and lands on top of the man. Knowing he could kill her with the gun; she snarls as she savagely throws caution to the wind and sinks her claws into the man’s flesh. Driving deep furrows of crimson red, Agent Reed knew she had to end it fast before he started to experience his first shift. Quickly wrapping her arms around the man’s neck as she pins him down; watching as his fingers reach for the Glock but are unable to grasp it. Using her lupine strength she crushes Chelnik’s windpipe as she chokes him.<br />
<br />
Feeling him flail and struggle underneath him, she catches wind of his scent beginning to change. The scratches she gave him moments ago beginning to change the man; with his heart beating furiously, the were-virus coursing through his veins is rapidly starting to change him. Agent Reed growled as she bore down on the man’s neck and wrenched it in such a way that cause the spinal cord to separate from the brain stem. Hearing the bones snap and feeling Chelnik finally goes still; his heart stopping its beating.<br />
<br />
Getting up and rolling the man over; agent Reed makes sure Chelnik is truly dead by checking his pulse. Looking at the man’s eye’s and seeing them lifeless; Agent Reed was stunned to see Chelnik’s right eye which was clearly dead and useless, look like his left; pristine and damage free. Closing both with her paw, agent Reed leaves the now dead Spetsnaz to go check on Deputy Carter.<br />
<br />
While the fight only lasted a few moments, for the FBI agent it felt like hours. Worried that he might have succumbed to blood loss from his bullet wound; agent Reed is relieved to see him sitting up and placing an improvised bandage to his shoulder.<br />
“Is he dead,” Samson wincing; looking at the female werewolf before him.<br />
“I snapped his neck,” agent Reed helping Samson Carter up; “I doubt even a were can survive having their neck snapped.”<br />
“We can’t,” Samson wincing; “but don’t tell me…”<br />
“I saw him lunging for the gun he had earlier,” Brooke Reed helping the deputy back to his cruiser; unconcerned that they were now out of the woods and she was still in her fursona in the middle of the day while under a were alert. “I lunged at him without thinking and dug into him to keep him from grabbing his weapon. The rest happed so fast.”<br />
“He started to change just as you killed him,” Samson answering; “it doesn’t matter anyway. Shooting a cop tends to lower your life expectancy. If he managed to best you,” Samson reaching for his police cruiser and grabbing his radio to report in; “the guy would have been hunted down by every deputy in town.”<br />
“You wouldn’t happen to have a spare robe in the trunk for me,” Agent reed looking at the wounded officer; “my clothes didn’t survive my shifting and I’m probably breaking every were-law just by being in my fursona while outside in the day.”<br />
“Sorry,” Samson smiling; “I don’t. But I wouldn’t worry about being in any violation of any were-law. You were justified in what you did.”<br />
<br />
Agent Reed observes as deputy Carter radioing in his status and requesting immediate medical attention. Walking to the gas station and entering the establishment to see the clerk looking at her with a non to amused look on him; agent Reed could smell the man was a werewolf like her, just not in his fursona like she was.<br />
“I’m an FBI agent and I need your first aid kit,” She barks at the man; “we have a wounded police officer outside and a dead hitman in the woods. And give me a large bottle of water while you are at it.”</p>
