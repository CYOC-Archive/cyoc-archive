<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Taylor was quite possibly the smartest student at the university. Having a double major in biomedical engineering and political science should&#39;ve been impossible for most individuals, but Taylor handled them with ease and even had time for a social life. He was by far one of the most intelligent minds in his generation, with a trained body to boot. Having been trained in mixed martial arts from childhood, the brown haired man was well muscled and had a nice pelt of body hair to complement it. He always been proud of how, if it wasn&#39;t his rugged good looks and knowledge that attracted the ladies, then it was his massive muscles that got them going. He was the total package: smart, handsome and charming. Being an RA was a piece of cake for him. The girls in his dorm always wanted to please him and the guys all wanted to be his friend. It was the perfect leadership role for him. He had big plans for after college. He wanted to experience all that life had to offer, so he was going to use his engineering degree to make a company that would revolutionize the world and use his poly sci degree to lead that world. He had his life planned out and if anybody could accomplish his goals, it was him.<br />
<br />
Taylor only had one fault in his entire persona. He was a raging homophobe. Learning MMA taught him discipline but being raised in a conservative town made him believe that gay people simply lacked that discipline. He especially thought this whenever he saw those swishy, effeminate types; they needed to be taught a lesson. He knew, given the direction the country was headed, that he couldn&#39;t speak out against them openly right now, but once his political dreams came to fruition, he&#39;d make sure that the &quot;gay phenomena&quot; would end as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
It was for this reason that hearing the gay guy who lived in his dorm fraternize with his boyfriend got him so riled up. Lucas had no respect for Taylor&#39;s authority given how he never wore anything except a condom and walked around like he owned the place. Taylor had tried calling the police multiple times as he knew this was a crime but for some reason Lucas would never get punished. That didn&#39;t mean Taylor would allow this, however, as he got to the copulating boys&#39; door and banged on it repeatedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;RA open up!&quot; Taylor stated, trying to keep himself calm. He was an RA, so he had to be respectful, despite his beliefs.<br />
<br />
Lucas, who was too absorbed in fucking the brains out of his twinky boyfriend (not that there was much left to fuck out), didn&#39;t even register the knocking as he mercilessly pounded the twink&#39;s boypussy. It was only after both boys had cum that he&#39;d noticed the incessant new type of pounding that appeared. Recognizing his RA&#39;s voice and Lucas&#39; new power, a plan formed in the manipulative boy&#39;s mind. He slipped out of his boyfriend and opened his door, cum still dripping off his cock.<br />
<br />
Taylor, seeing the sight, wanted to wretch, but kept his composure as he spoke. &quot;Lucas, you know that even if this is your dorm, you can&#39;t be making that much noise and you certainly can&#39;t be opening your door naked,&quot; he explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure?&quot; Lucas asked, a smirk growing on his face as he began to exercise his power. &quot;Because usually you like hearing our moans. That&#39;s why you had me record our 5 hour fuck session so you could listen to it on loop when we aren&#39;t around.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taylor didn&#39;t know why he liked hearing the sound track so much. There was just something so relaxing about hearing it. He constantly kept it playing in his ears. In fact, it had taken him a while to realize that the moaning he was hearing was coming from outside his earbuds he was wearing while working out in his room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, that&#39;s fair, but while I enjoy hearing it, not everyone else does, so you have to respect that. Not to mention, that doesn&#39;t excuse your nudity,&quot; Taylor responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you love seeing me naked Taylor. You said you always wanted to know when I had a fresh dose of cum so you could get a helping of your favorite liquid. Not to mention, you know the dorm doesn&#39;t care. This is a prominently gay male dorm, and you specifically stated that sexual encounters were allowed anywhere in the building as long as all participants were male and the sex was completely gay,&quot; Lucas stated.<br />
<br />
Of course, Taylor knew that. It was his job as an RA to know the rules of his building. He hated the fact that he was assigned the mostly fag dorm, but he had to uphold the policies and the rules he swore to uphold.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you&#39;re right, sorry about that. Speaking of which, mind if I get a taste?&quot; Taylor asked as he knelt to lick up Lucas&#39; cum. He knew he was straight, but he loved the taste of cum. Ever since he&#39;d had a curious taste when cleaning up the communal lounge one time, he couldn&#39;t get enough. He&#39;d often enter a room from which he heard moaning just to get another dose and masturbated a lot more to get more. As he started cleaning off Lucas&#39; dick, the tongue studded man thought up more devious ways to change up his RA.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, you really love licking a cock. Try sucking it, you&#39;ll probably love it even more,&quot; Lucas suggested. Taylor didn&#39;t like the idea, but given how good licking Lucas&#39; cock was, it was worth a shot. The moment he tried it, he knew he wasn&#39;t going back. Having the taste of the man&#39;s cock and his cum envelope his mouth had to be one of the best feelings in the world. Taylor was straight and hated all things gay, but this was just too good.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at you, you&#39;re a natural pro at this!&quot; Lucas observed as Taylor&#39;s technique markedly improved. &quot;It&#39;s a good thing you don&#39;t know that every suck and lick of a cock makes you look more and more twinky. It&#39;s even better that you don&#39;t know that even touching cum makes you think more like a twink.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taylor simply kept bobbing his head unaware of this new truth. The combined effect of sucking Lucas&#39; cock and tasting the man&#39;s cum was starting to change the once promising RA. As his body hair evaporated from his body, his intelligence began to diminish. His double major was a struggle if he was being honest. It was difficult to keep his life balanced. He couldn&#39;t really go to the gym anymore, meaning that most of his muscle never developed on his body. Gone were his political aspirations as he dropped his poly sci major and all hair beneath his head disappeared. It took too much time and he was much too submissive to lead, he believed. Even his one major was starting to become difficult. He had planned on being a biomedical engineer but communications was the only thing he could actually pass courses in. It was sad for him, but there wasn&#39;t much he could do; it wasn&#39;t like he was smart enough for any more than that now.<br />
<br />
Derek, watching the progression of Taylor to twinkhood, got absurdly horny at the scene. He&#39;d wanted to bang the thinning RA for a while now and this was a dream come true. He quickly got up and strutted over to his boyfriend and their new partner and straddled Lucas while making out with him, leaving his bubble butt spread right on top of Taylor.<br />
<br />
As a result of this, Taylor pulled away in disgust. Who was this fag to shove his ass in my face, Taylor thought as he looked up the boypussy in front of him. Suddenly, however, he noticed the cum that Lucas had left on his boyfriend&#39;s hole. Unconsciously licking his lips, he hesitated from doing such a thing. That was totally gay, Taylor believed. There was no way he do it, no matter how much he wanted cum, right?<br />
<br />
Lucas, noticing the pause in his blowjob, looked at the RA. Seeing the situation, he cleared things up. &quot;That&#39;s gotta look enticing, right Taylor?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The cum is, but I don&#39;t want to lick the fag&#39;s ass. That&#39;s, like, very gay,&quot; Taylor explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, you&#39;ve been sucking my dick for the past 5 minutes,&quot; Lucas countered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but, like, that doesn&#39;t make me gay. I just totally love the taste of cock and cum,&quot; Taylor reasoned as he neatly adjusted his spiky faux hawk back into place. Lucas chuckled at the mental gymnastics Taylor just performed. Lucas loved it.<br />
<br />
&quot;But Taylor, rimming is such a turn on for you. When you rim a twink&#39;s boypussy, you feel so happy and horny. Not to mention, even though you don&#39;t know it, the longer you rim a guy, the more gay and slutty you get,&quot; Lucas explained, shoving his dick in Derek&#39;s hole just to entice the RA further, much to Derek&#39;s pleasure.<br />
<br />
The change in Taylor was amazing. Nervousness gone, a look of lust dawned on his face as he licked everything he could. Gone was all his hate towards effeminate guys. After all, he was one himself. Now he only had enough muscle left to work his pole at his stripping job. With his intelligence gone, he had to find some way to support himself through college and stripping definitely paid the bills. Once the guys saw his creamy bubble butt and twinky body, they went wild. It did help that his good looks went from rugged to cute as his blue highlights perfectly complemented his blue eyes. Plus, he loved his job; it was the perfect way for to get paid to be slutty and have people watch (and occasionally join in). The homophobic, straight, rugged and tough Taylor disappeared as the new, slutty, gay and twinky Taylor emerged, voraciously licking everywhere he could in the couple&#39;s fuck session. He couldn&#39;t get enough of everything gay, he thought. It was much to the dismay of his parents, originally proud of their intelligent, conservative son, now disgusted by their dumb twink of an offspring. The only discipline he received now was when he asked people from his dorm to spank him for being such a naughty slut. He got off on humiliation, and loved it. He was the perfect, gay bottom package now.<br />
<br />
As Lucas smiled into his boyfriend&#39;s kiss, knowing Taylor was now an amazing twink, he heard another voice meant to disrupt their fun.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fucking hell?&quot; It screamed.</p>
