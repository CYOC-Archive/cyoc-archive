<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Karen woke up soon after dawn.  She sat up from her bed, and the sound of rain and rolling thunder indicated that a storm rolled in while she slept.  The first thing she felt, though, is a pounding headache.  She also felt like she had a fever, but this fever seemed to be throughout her body, and not just her head.  She groaned as every muscle ached in protest with every movement.  She sat in her bed, still a bit groggy from last night as she rubbed her eyes.  She did an examination of her body to look for any signs of change.  There was no fur on her body, and he fingernails and toenails were still normal.  She did a quick check of her ears, and they were where they were supposed to be.  She breathed a sigh of relief as maybe last night&#39;s dream was just a dream.  She managed to get off her bed and lumbered her way to the bathroom for a shower.<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
Nichole and Moe woke up in each other&#39;s arms, still nude from their activities.  They looked at each other and gave each other a simple kiss.  Before things could progress further, Moe moved away from his wife and said, &quot;We need to get up, honey.  As much as I&#39;d like a repeat, there are things we need to get done, such as talking to our daughter about our choice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nichole sighed as she too rolled off and said, &quot;I suppose you&#39;re right.&quot;  She paused as she thought for a moment, &quot;I know we still have that Mandatory Were law, but do we have enough time to choose which one we want to be?  I mean, we were given a week, but that was almost a week ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that depends on Karen.  I mean, if she&#39;s our family were, then we&#39;ll have plenty of time to decide.  And besides, I&#39;m sure the city will give us an extension given the circumstances.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Speaking of Karen,&quot; Nichole paused as she put on some clothing, &quot;Do you think we should let her go join a were society.  I mean...&quot; she paused again as she gathered her thoughts.  &quot;Weres do have lots of sex.  I was hoping that she&#39;d wait till she was in college or even when she was married but...&quot;<br />
<br />
Moe put a comforting hand on his wife, &quot;Yeah, I know.  But Karen worked hard for this and so far, she&#39;s talked to people.  If she really wants this, I say let her have it.&quot;  Nichole gave him a disapproving look, but Moe continued.  &quot;Part of a parent is letting your kids go and let them make their own decisions.  This is a big decision, but so far, Karen&#39;s been handling it responsibly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Nichole admitted, &quot;I just wish our little girl was still our little girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kids grow up,&quot; Moe replied as he continued to dress, &quot;I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll be fine, and she&#39;s a smart girl.&quot;<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
Karen went into the bathroom and undressed herself.  She turned on the cold water and stepped into the shower.  Normally, she&#39;d prefer a warm shower, but given how hot her body was feeling, the cold water was just the thing she needed.  She stood in the shower as the cold water fell onto her body and cooled her body down.  As she did so, the fever and muscle aches seemed to melt away and she felt better.  <br />
<br />
She reached for the soap, but as she did so, she noticed her fingernails were sharpened to nails.  She gasped and blinked her eyes, and when she reopened her eyes, the fingernails were their normal self.  She breathed a sigh of relief as she picked up the soap and started to scrub herself.  As she washing her chest, her hand felt something like fur.  She opened her eyes and looked down where her hand was.  She moved her hand and found nothing but bare skin.  She shook her head and continued to wash and then rinse herself off.  <br />
<br />
She stepped out of the shower and headed towards the bathroom sink.  She pulled out her toothbrush and toothpaste and opened her mouth.  At this point, she noticed her canines were much longer and sharper.  Her eyes widened and she quickly closed her mouth.  She felt her teeth using her tongue.  Feeling nothing unusual, she opened her mouth again to find that her teeth were back to their flat selves.  She shook her head one more time and then proceeded to brush her teeth and other usual bathroom routines.<br />
<br />
When she stepped out into the hall, she could hear her mom and dad in the kitchen.  She could hear sizzling coming from the kitchen, and her mouthed started to water when she smelt the bacon and ham.<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
Moe was in the kitchen cooking a hearty breakfast of eggs, ham, and bacon while Nichole was at the table.  She was looking through the pages of the Moon Lake Were guide, and looking through the various weres and their features.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not going to jump me now, are you?&quot; Moe asked from the kitchen as he worked with the food.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll try to contain myself,&quot; Nichole said with a playful smirk and a wink.  She then called down where the bedrooms were, &quot;Karen, honey, we&#39;re going to have some breakfast.  Want to join us?&quot;<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be right down,&quot; Karen called back as she started to dress herself in her bedroom.  She pulled the clothes that she was going to wear for the day on the bed.  She noticed the shirt that she was wearing last night and remembered her activities with Rich.  She picked up the used shirt and took a deep whiff of where Rich&#39;s semen had hit her.  She could still smell his scent, and she felt turned on a little.  Part of her wondered what would have happened had Rich not pushed her off.  The other part of her wondered if she&#39;d see Rich again that night.<br />
<br />
She put the shirt back down and continued to dress herself.  She managed to get her panties on, but her bra seemed to be a bit tight, almost like her bra was a little too small.  &quot;Time to go shopping again?&quot; she mused to herself.  She looked at herself, and her breasts did seem to be a bit bigger.  She put on a t-shirt and pants, and they seemed to be a bit snug.  Yet, it didn&#39;t look like she was getting fatter.  If anything, it looked like she spent a little time at the gym.  But Karen shrugged as she finished getting ready for the day.<br />
<br />
Unseen by Karen, though, a small tuft of black fur had grown on her lower back that had appeared after she came back from her shower.  It was quickly covered by her shirt.  That wasn&#39;t her imagination that time.<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
The smell of bacon, eggs, and ham enticed her to go to the kitchen, where her mom and dad were sitting at the kitchen.  Karen served herself a large portion of the breakfast.  When she sat down at the kitchen table, Nichole and Moe were waiting for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Karen, honey,&quot; Nichole started, &quot;we have something we want to share with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-oh,&quot; Karen said as she ate her breakfast.<br />
<br />
Moe looked at Nichole and continued, &quot;Well, um, we looked things over and we discussed it last night.&quot;  Karen looked at her parents as she figured their discussion was a little more than moans and groans.  &quot;We&#39;re willing to be the weres for this family,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Hey eyebrows lit up as she stopped mid-bite.  &quot;What brought this on?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;ll admit being a bit apprehensive about this town and its...unique...population,&quot; Nichole explained  But, the more I learned about this place and the people who live here, the more that I...we...wanted what they had.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can understand that,&quot; Karen said as she continued eating.  Unlike Nichole, Karen didn&#39;t have as many apprehensions with were society.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, we&#39;ve decided to take the plunge and join were society,&quot; Moe said.  &quot;We&#39;re not sure which group to join yet but it does mean that you don&#39;t have to join if you don&#39;t want to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But...what if I do?&quot; Karen asked.<br />
<br />
Moe and Nichole looked at each other and then Moe continued, &quot;We&#39;re fine with that, as long as you stick with your plan.  Learning about weregroups.  Getting the birth control pills.  That sort of thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen breathed a sigh of relief and then said, &quot;Well, I&#39;m happy for you guys.  I mean, talking with all the weres that I&#39;ve meet, I&#39;ve yet to see one who regretted their decision.&quot;  It was at that point that Karen noticed her empty plate.  &quot;Wow, I guess I was hungrier than I thought.&quot;  She picked up her plate and went to the kitchen to put it in the sink.  &quot;Oh,&quot; she said as she turned around to face her parents, &quot;there&#39;s a were-lion person coming later this afternoon.  You can talk with her about being a werelion.  And also, I&#39;ll let you know what my decision is after she leaves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Moe and Nichole both looked at each other, and then Moe shrugged.</p>
