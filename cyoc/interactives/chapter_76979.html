<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Now you always expect everyone to be different when they come back to their 20 year reunion but that was an <br />
eye opening experience for Todd. He had made so many changes to the classmates. Some were quite evil and some <br />
were beneficial. But the changes he made to Walt and Mr. Branson were not exactly what he had expected. <br />
<br />
Somehow he knew that as soon as marriage was legal between two men Walt and Mr. Branson would become wed but <br />
the changes were not what he had expected. Todd knew that Mr. Branson would remain fat his whole life. That <br />
was part of his change. What little muscle tone he had had sagged even more than after his changes. Yes he had <br />
gained weight and his tits had sagged lower as did his abdomen. He had lost all the hair on top of his head <br />
and the little on the sides he kept shaved. He had become well versed in the fat man waddle and as he walked <br />
he threw his shoulders back and strutted into the room.<br />
<br />
The big change was in Walt. Now Todd hadn't made any change to Walt. He really had no hostility toward him but <br />
he had made the gesture toward him making it seemed as though he had made a change to him. When Todd saw Walt <br />
walk through the doors on the arm of Mr. Branson his jaw dropped so low it looked like a cartoon character. <br />
There striding through the door was Walt but not Walt. He was in a very beautiful blue dress. He had always <br />
been hefty but the years had added quite a bit of weight to his chest and it looked as though there was no <br />
padding in his bra. Having been a football player his shoulders were wide and out of proportion for a woman <br />
but it looked quite good in the choice of dress. He would have towered over Mr. Branson normally but the 6 <br />
inch stilettos made that even taller. When they danced Mr. Branson only reached to Walt's crotch. The dress <br />
was longer than a baby doll but it did cinch itself right under his chest but above his stomach and the weight <br />
that had accumulated at his belly made the dress look like he was pregnant which would have been far from the <br />
truth. You see Mr. Branson had long since given up the duties of a man and was now only able to take Walt's <br />
rather large cock in his ass. Mr. Branson's cock having always been quite small could no longer escape the <br />
mass of fat and his ass was quite wide open needing a plug to keep it from dripping. Todd had made the one <br />
change to Walt and that was that his dick would continue to enlarge length and width even as he got rounder <br />
and it was now able to become the size of a 2 litre bottle that easily fit up Mr. Branson's back end and while <br />
not in use it became easily strapped between his legs.<br />
<br />
Now Tood, not being interested in Walt in any way, had to ask him for a dance. And as they danced they talked. <br />
Todd was not short but he looked up at Walt and Walt thanked him for changing him into this person gesturing <br />
to his body.<br />
<br />
But I didn't do any of this. This is all you.<br />
<br />
No! No! I was never like this. I knew I liked men but this is not what I was.<br />
<br />
Todd the only thing I changed for you was this. He grabbed his crotch. I figured you would need some excess <br />
here when I saw how you were looking at Mr. Branson but the rest is you. I think that the wave of my wand just <br />
gave you the freedom to be who you are and I am glad you have become what you most desire. It was quite a <br />
shock to see you this way. If I had done this I wouldn't have been so shocked. But I am happy with this.<br />
<br />
Walt pulled Todd close to him and squeezed his ass and gave him a big kiss on the lips. With tongue. You need <br />
to come see my show Sunday.<br />
<br />
I would love to. Somehow Todd knew that Mr. Branson was going to get some sweet loving tonight.</p>
