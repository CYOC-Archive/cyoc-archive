<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;This can&#39;t be happening to me. I must be dreaming!&quot;<br />
<br />
This was the first thought that came to Julia when she realized she had caught the virus. She had read on the news that it mostly affected the males of the human species, but female cases were almost unheard of. Therefore she had believed she could not be affected. Looking at herself in the mirror today though, there were no doubts anymore.<br />
<br />
Up until a couple days ago, Julia was a petite brunette in her mid-twenties with olive skin and hazel eyes. She worked from home in freelance as a web designer and integrator. She was a real introvert and, though pretty, didn&#39;t come out often and had no friends; she had recently moved into this city. She would rather spend time on her personal projects or work, so her life had been pretty lonely, but she would hit up a social chat every now and then strike a conversation with interesting strangers.<br />
<br />
Nothing that would expose her to the virus though... Was it the pizza delivery guy, then? He sure looked fidgety when she handed him the change for her order. Still, she was clueless...<br />
<br />
First it was her clothes. She had always been rather short and skinny, with small breasts and very few curves, when all of the sudden she started feeling like her pants were too tight around her waist and buttocks, and her shoulders and chest were becoming broader. Much broader, in fact. She noticed her body was becoming more muscular out of nowhere. Even her breasts had gained a cup in size.<br />
<br />
But the strange changes didn&#39;t stop there. Next, she noticed her body hair, which she had recently waxed, growing back at an alarming rate as well as much thicker and darker. It was not only the legs but her arms as well. She thought it was some kind of hormonal imbalance, because on that day she had also felt unusually horny. She forgot about her sex drive the following day though when she realized in horror the body hair was spreading to the rest of her body.<br />
<br />
Not only the hair on her legs and arms was progressively turning into a thick black pelt, but black hair was also creeping up her belly from her groin, and a new patch was now growing in the middle of her chest. Additionally, a distinct dark fuzz had appeared on her jawline and cheeks. That&#39;s when she realized something in her eyes had changed... Gone was the hazel look staring back at her, as her eyes were now some shade of rusty red and more ape-like than human. Inspecting her mouth, she saw her canine teeth had grown a tad longer. That&#39;s when she began thinking about the virus.<br />
<br />
When she woke up the next morning, Julia felt constricted in her nightdress. She sat up in her bed and heard the sound of seams tearing as her muscular torso burst out of her nightgown. She looked down in disbelief. Her skin had turned several shades darker. Her body looked wrongly shaped. Her legs were too short, her arms too long and muscular, with large shoulders. Her belly was protuding outward, following the lines of a barrel chest upon which two large breasts were hanging and heaving along her breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s happening!&quot; she screamed and shocked herself with how much lower her voice sounded. She immediately got up and waddled to the bathroom while getting rid of the remnants of her nightdress. She was not prepared for the sight in the mirror. She looked like a strange caveman - or cavewoman, rather. Her face still had distinctive human features, through her skull was more ape-like than the day before. Her nose was flatter but her mouth wasn&#39;t projecting fully forward yet. Her canine teeth were impressive.<br />
<br />
The rest of her body was... awkward-looking. Although her legs were slighty shorter and she could only walk bending her knees, she seemed a couple inches taller. She was covered in dark fur, save for her face, breasts, nether regions, hands and feet. The curve of her back was more pronounced, which accentuated her round belly and large torso. Her eyes studied her breasts attentively again; perhaps because she had been wearing bras her whole life, unlike an ape would, they did not hang very low and were still in pretty good shape. In fact she had never had breasts as large as these before, since they had grown in size along with the rest of her mutated body.<br />
<br />
Julia raised a simian hand up to her right breast and gave a small squeeze. They were soft and firm at the same time, still strangely human on a more bestial frame now, almost out of place. She brought her other hand  to her left breast and cupped them both, looking at herself in the mirror as she made them roll slightly. Her nipples looked very long, alien. The skin was extremely dark. She brushed them with an elongated finger and they became erect, poking further out.</p>
<hr/><h3>
She stopped her exploration abruptly. What was she doing?</h3>
