<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">{{To &quot;William Anderson&quot;: Loved <i>Legacy of a Renewed Union</i>. I hope you contribute more episodes and have no problem with the basic concept of Martha carrying the last child William sired.  Personally, I&#39;m just not sure twin natural hybrids are the right call, because I always thought the Andersons next child would eventually be the daughter Martha always wanted. Therefore, since he started this alternate time line thread, I&#39;ve turned back the clock a bit and we&#39;ll see what &quot;Blackjack88&quot; has to say on the subject.—tmw.}}<br />
<br />
TUESDAY MORNING IN MOON LAKE...<br />
Martha Anderson awoke with a start as the six am alarm rang.<br />
The dream of her late husband William being with her, even if it was for the last time, and letting her know his regrets and thoughts on the future seemed so <i><b>real...</i></b><br />
And then that whole sequence with Frances...<br />
Trying to clear her head, Martha started to rise for the day, but the room started spinning!<br />
Not sure what was going on, Martha managed to get out of bed, and barely managed to get to the master bathroom in time before she seriously barfed into the toilet!<br />
When she was done and cleaned up, Martha took a good long look at herself in the mirror.<br />
<i>Could it be true?</i> she wondered. <i>Am I REALLY pregnant? Let alone with natural hybrid twins?</i><br />
Not knowing what else to do, Martha managed to get back to the bedroom and called her best friends.<br />
<br />
Doctor Frances Twist was kind of surprised to hear the telephone ring that early in the morning. She had barely gotten a couple of hours of sleep after driving back from Seattle after making sure Julie Stovall was going to be okay post surgery.<br />
Groggily seeing who the Caller ID said it was, she answered the phone since her wife Samantha was in the shower.<br />
At first, Frances reassured Martha it was just a dream. Missing William even after all this time was a natural feeling, considering how strong their love had regrown after both of them had become weres. And the part about even William said it was time for Martha to move on and be happy was a positive sign.<br />
But when Martha told her friend the rest of what happened...<br />
&quot;It could just be a coincidence. You could of been emotionally worked up over the dream or even just on the verge of fighting a stomach bug, but you better get examined to be sure. If you&#39;d like me to go with you...&quot; said Frances.<br />
It would take some rearranging on Frances&#39; part, especially since technically she should be back in Seattle sometime today to check on Julie&#39;s progress, but Doctor Twist agreed to accompany Martha to her after school doctor&#39;s appointment and Martha would call her back as soon as she had a time.<br />
<br />
Later that morning, Martha got confirmation of an afternoon appointment, and was finishing up her call with Frances to inform her when  it would be as Coach Katherine &quot;Kat&quot; Johnson walked into the office of the Girl&#39;s Physical Education Department of Moon Lake Junior High School.<br />
&quot;Is everything all right Martha? You&#39;ve been a bit out of it so far today,&quot; said Kat. <i>Do I turn you on as much as you arouse me?</i><br />
As a lesbian, the weretigress was interested in Martha for more than just friendship. But despite the fact Martha was bi, Kat knew she would have to tread carefully considering how Martha lost her husband.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure. There&#39;s a chance I might be carrying William&#39;s last child or children,&quot; admitted Martha, before telling her new friend and potential future lover everything.<br />
Kat sat and listened carefully to everything, worried about Martha. But inside, she wasn&#39;t happy. <i>DAMN! I sure can pick them!</i> she silently complained to herself. <i>Here I am thinking I may have finally found Miss Right, and not only is she a widow with 2 boys, there now might be at least 1 more on the way! I was seriously thinking of giving up my apartment and moving in with Martha if things progressed that far and she&#39;d let me. Despite Eric and Nate&#39;s ages, I was starting to get used to the idea of maybe eventually becoming a stepmom. I&#39;m still interested in and want Martha. Guess I&#39;ll just have to take this one day at a time.</i><br />
&quot;If you need anything...&quot; said Kat, putting a reassuring arm around Martha.<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; replied Martha. &quot;I have a doctor&#39;s appointment this afternoon after school. I&#39;ll just have to wait till the test results come back and take it from there,&quot; she said, before kissing Kat briefly on the cheek.<br />
Both the bi-woman and the bi-werecat that comprised Martha Anderson were interested in Kat. Martha had originally planned to finish this week as a substitute teacher under Coach Johnson before considering a potential relationship with her, but now...<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
&quot;Grandmother. There has been a development that you need to be aware of,&quot; announced Daisuke Tachibana as he approached the leader of the Skulk.<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; asked Akane no Tachibana.<br />
&quot;Tora called from the hospital. Martha Anderson has made an appointment with him for later this afternoon. She thinks there is a possibility she might be pregnant with her late husband&#39;s last child and seeks confirmation of the truth,&quot; said Daisuke.<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; replied Akane, setting her work down on her desk to stare at her grandson. &quot;With Martha Anderson, we are in a truly gray area here. The actions of the rogue werevixen Yvette Smith brought shame and dishonor upon the entire Skulk clan, demanding we must do whatever we can to make amends, despite the fact our best actions will never bring back the dead. Although we had yet to hold a formal induction ceremony for him, Martha Anderson at best would have just been an honorary member as William&#39;s wife, so honor and actual liability are two different concepts in this case.&quot;<br />
&quot;So what do we do?&quot; inquired Daisuke.<br />
&quot;We have already been secretly helping the Moon Lake School District secure funding to keep Martha Anderson on as a full time substitute teacher until she acquires her recertification this Spring and becomes a full time regular teacher this fall. For now, we will have to wait until after Tora informs us of the test results. Then I will decide the appropriate course of action from there.&quot;<br />
<br />
LATER...<br />
Doctor Frances Twist called Doctor Mera Curry at the Seattle Hospital earlier that morning and informed her that something had come up in Moon Lake that required her presence. Unless there was an emergency in the Julie Stovall case, she would be there Wednesday morning to examine the patient for herself and determine the best course of treatment.<br />
For now, all she could do was sit in the waiting area of Moon Lake General Hospital until either Martha or Doctor Tora Tachibana came out to tell her what the test results were on her friend.<br />
<br />
INSIDE...<br />
Doctor Tora Tachibana didn&#39;t maintain a regular office like some doctors. Instead, he preferred to work out of the hospital to be closer to those who needed him.<br />
After having a fellow Skulk member drive him home and getting a good night&#39;s sleep in his own bed while Doctor Curry stayed in Seattle with Julie Stovall, Tora was making morning rounds to check up on things in Moon Lake when he got the call from Martha Anderson.<br />
It had only been a couple of months since the untimely and dishonorable death of William Anderson, so even if Martha was pregnant, she could not be more than towards the end of her first trimester at most.<br />
After notifying Daisuke, because their grandmother wanted to be kept abreast of any developments concerning the victims of Yvette Smith, Tora found it difficult to keep his mind on his schedule before Mrs. Anderson arrived for her appointment.<br />
Now he went over the test results one more time before entering the examination room.<br />
Martha Anderson was still sitting on the edge of the examining table where he left her, partially clothed and anxious to hear the results.<br />
Wasting no time after entering the room, Doctor Tachibana looked at his patient and said, &quot;Mrs. Anderson—&quot;<br />
