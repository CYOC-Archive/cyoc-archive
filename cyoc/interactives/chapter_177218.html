<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam woke the next morning with two cases of morning wood. He had slept with Joe tucked inside his boxers, and the big cock had snuggled up against Sam’s own during the night. Now, Sam’s cock and Joe the cock lay at full mast between his legs; Sam moaned as caught the last dregs of his sleep, squeezing Joe’s heavy, loose balls between his legs. He heard the dicked man moan below the sheets, and Sam pulled back his covers and extracted Joseph, placing the fat schlong on his belly and propping himself up against the pillows.<br />
<br />
“Good morning,” said Joe through is cockslit in a sleepy voice. He felt the instinct to yawn and stretch, but his cock-body could only respond by pulling his big balls up close and stretching his long shaft, flaring his head. <br />
<br />
Sam giggled and said, “Good morning,” in return, leaving one hand on Joe’s shaft and giving him some long, appreciative strokes. <br />
<br />
“You know,” Joe purred after minute, “I really love morning blowjobs,” he suggested, a bit of pre oozing from his mouth.<br />
<br />
“Really?” replied Sam with mock surprise. He picked joe up and slid his head into his mouth, licking and caressing his throbbing head while with his other hand he began to stroke his own large cock. It felt good to Sam, especially with Joe’s thick shaft sliding deeper into his throat, but something in him missed the feeling of being stroked and rubbed all over his body. He actually missed hanging between Nick’s warm hairy legs, too. But he was also delighted and turned on by the fact that Nick was now stuck in the same situation Sam had almost found himself stuck in for a full year! His cock throbbed and he grinned around Joe’s prodigious girth as he shoved the big cock further down his throat until his balls rested against Sam’s chin. He continued to suck Joe while stroking himself for another ten minutes before finally, the man and the cock came over the edge.<br />
<br />
He felt Joe groan in his mouth and his balls tense in his hands as the dicked man came, his orgasm forcing several loads of hot cum straight down Sam’s throat. Sam continued rapidly stroking his own cock until he came soon after, blowing his load all over his chest and sheets. Eager to finally breath, Sam extracted Joe’s long, softening length from his throat and laid the big dick to rest next to his own. Sam noticed that his cock and Joseph were about the same length, but he found it hot that Joseph was girthier than him.<br />
<br />
“God, its so intense cumming as just a cock!” joe exclaimed, trying to wriggle his body so that he was snuggled against Sam’s cock.<br />
<br />
“I know, right?” Sam breathed. “Wait till you feel what its like to be between someone’s legs!” he said, grabbing his shirt to wipe the cum from his chest. <br />
<br />
“Well, I’m stuck like this for the next seven weeks. Is there a way that I can be your cock?” Joe asked, still leaking a bit of cum.<br />
<br />
Sam thought about it. He did have to work; he didn’t want to leave the cock lying around the house alone all day, cold and bored. And Joe wasn’t that much different from his own cock. <br />
<br />
“It could work,” he agreed.<br />
<br />
“Oh, dude! Then I could still sell weed!” the cock exclaimed, hardening in excitement. <br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
“Think about it! You can camp at my place; my clients come over, we sell the dope, and I’ll give you say, 30%?” Joe said hopefully. <br />
<br />
Sam snorted. “Nice try, George Jung. You’re in no position to bargain.” He said, squeezing Joe’s balls. “I’ll do it, for fifty.”<br />
<br />
“Fifty? Come on man, I gotta make a…” but his voice trailed off as Sam continued squeezing and massaging Joe’s big balls. <br />
<br />
“Fifty, buddy. C’mon, its two months.”<br />
<br />
Joe moaned and acquiesced. “Fine, deal. Get that tech support guy on the phone.”<br />
<br />
Sam sat up and reached for the phone, giggling when Joe slipped of his body and onto the sheets. He pulled up the app and tapped ‘tech-support’, and his phone quickly called the number.<br />
<br />
“You again, Sam 8”x5”. How may I help you this time?” the man said with a tone of amused exasperation <br />
<br />
“Hi, sorry. Last time, I swear. So, here’s my thing,” and he explained the arrangement that he and Joe had in mind.<br />
<br />
“Hmm, I like that idea. On one condition: make sure to share the dicking app with your male customers. Our beta test is running smoothly but we’d like to build a bigger user base.” Hugo said.<br />
<br />
“Sounds like a deal to me. So, how do we do this?” Sam asked.<br />
<br />
“I have you and your friend’s profiles up right now. As an admin, I can toggle the settings such that Joseph can be attached to your crotch.” He said in a matter-of-fact tone. <br />
<br />
“What happens to my old cock?” asked Sam hesitantly. <br />
<br />
“It will be absorbed by Joe 8”x8”. Nice girth, by the way,” he raised his voice so that Joe could hear.<br />
<br />
“Thanks buddy!” Joe swelled with pride.<br />
<br />
“When your friend’s time expires, your old cock should grow back within a few hours of him detaching from you. If that will be all, then I wish you good day, and remember, tell your friends! Happy dicking!” and the man hung up on them.<br />
<br />
“So, you just put me by your cock and I’ll…attach?” Joe asked.<br />
<br />
“I guess so,” Sam put his phone down on the table. “Let’s try it out. I need a shower.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, me too,” Joe agreed as Sam took hold of his shaft and brought him to his crotch. He lined up Joe so that the base of his shaft stood just behind his own, Joe’s balls resting on Sam’s hardening cock. He pressed joe against his hairy mons pubis and waited, both of them throbbing with anticipation. Sam shuddered as the contact between his cock and Joe became almost overwhelmingly pleasurable. He felt like a pair of strong hands had seized both cocks in a vice-like grip, stroking and squeezing the two together as they blended into one. When the sensation left him, Sam looked down and saw only one cock between his legs, firmly attached to his groin. It was visibly different from his own, the thickness, obviously, but also the skin tone was lighter, his balls heavier. Sam was shocked to see that his pubic hair had changed color as well, dark black like Joe instead of his usually brown. Joe moaned and stretched, and Sam watched in glee as his own cock lengthened and hardened its way up his stomach. <br />
<br />
“Damn, I can feel your heartbeat through my body,” moaned Joe. Sam took Joe’s shaft in both hands and began to slowly stroke him up and down, both men moaning at their shared pleasure. Joe was enjoying the way his balls rested between Sam’s hairy thighs, of how he was experiencing the exquisite pleasure of Sam’s big hands gliding over his body but also Sam’s own experience of jerking and squeezing his new, sentient cock. Sam continued to tease and stroke his new cock Joe well into the late morning, bring them both to several orgasms. Sam lay in the bed, naked, with joe resting semi-hard and happy on Sam’s warm stomach, both idly thinking of people to hit up and share this dicking app with.</p>
