<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Arriving at Brittany&#39;s house, you and Brittany could see that the front door was wide open.  Mutant and untransformed neighbors were ferrying things out of the house and onto its porch, where others, including and eight-armed, eight-breasted, purple-haired mutant/transformee, helped to pack them into boxes, bags, and crates.  The supply crates were then brought down to the lawn, where they were taken to the fortified house.  <br />
<br />
A sweaty, shirtless, headless and neckless body of a slightly chubby man with a woman&#39;s mouth pasted to its stomach and a woman&#39;s leg replacing each of its arms as it was walking (stumbling) on all fours was being piggy-backed by a bizarre mutant, in an odd way.   A mouthless and petite woman was clinging onto the man&#39;s body with her arms, aided by a pair of more masculine, hairy, and a tad bit flabby, arms attached to where her legs should be, and a hairy tail that snaked out of the rear of her pants and coiled itself around the man&#39;s torso&#39;s stomach.  On the woman&#39;s body, three breasts were present, all in one horizontal row.  On the right and left breasts sat an eye each, and on the center sat a masculine mouth.  Despite the stressful circumstances, the man and the woman were having a great time trying to navigate with their new bodies that they seemed to share control over - they were shaking in laughter with every stumble and slip-up they made as they picked up some supply bags and rode their &quot;steed&quot; back to the fortified house.<br />
<br />
Boxes labeled &quot;food&quot;, &quot;water,&quot; &quot;clothing,&quot; &quot;tools,&quot; and etc. were being picked up by other neighbors heading to and from the fortified house.  A golf cart pulled up, and out stepped the muscle-swapped woman and man, who loaded the golf cart with supplies.  You noted that the man didn&#39;t go lift many heavy things anymore like he tried to do at the fortified house.  Brittany&#39;s dick-naga neighbor also slithered past the parked jeep, quickly picking up 3 boxes with her four arms before heading right back to the fortified house, whizzing by three other mutants you and Brittany hadn&#39;t seen yet.<br />
<br />
The first was a slime boy, likely a tween, colored a light shade of blue.  Sliding on a skateboard he had created out of himself, he pop-shoved into the air before reabsorbing the skateboard and colliding with the ground, collapsing into a pile of blue goop.  Quickly reforming itself, the boy first mimicked the shape of a buff man, then a smoking-hot, curvy woman, before an untransformed woman, likely his mother, yelled at him to stop messing around and to help.  Sighing, the boy replaced his bimbo-proportioned body below his feminine head with a muscular male body, and grew several tentacles with hands on them which he used to grab objects and wrap around boxes, cases, crates, etc.  With the weight of the supplies pressing his legs into shapeless mush, the boy grew six full-on wheels and hurriedly &quot;drove&quot; over to the fortified house, dropping off enough supplies before he was literally flattened.  You and Brittany could hear his mom yelling at him to change his face and head back to normal.<br />
<br />
The second mutant couldn&#39;t help much, thanks to their body.  A fusion between two women, two tired looking heads had taken the place of the arms of their body, while atop their headless neck sat two clearly aroused penises, one on top of the other, which both flopped around as they walked.  One head, that of a young black woman, was attached to the right arm&#39;s wrist, and the other head, that of a little older Latino woman, was attached to the left arm&#39;s wrist.  The torso and upper body was that of the black woman, while the lower body was that of the Latino woman, and it was there that things got strange.  Attached to the body&#39;s hips were two abnormally long arms (one on each side, corresponding with the head) that reached all the way down to the body&#39;s feet.  In their groin area, sat an additional, almost featureless head that looked like somewhat like a fusion between the two womens&#39; heads.  Peeking out from between the womens&#39; jeans&#39; zippers, the only thing present on it was a huge pair of luscious, red lips.  It breathed in and out before it yawned, revealing a long, pink tongue coiled up inside.  It made sense that the two heads wouldn&#39;t be able to breathe or eat if they were mounted on the arms of the body, so a replacement mouth had to be used instead.  They sat down to rest, talking to each other about something, laying their heads/arms on their shared lap to relax their arms.<br />
You and Brittany felt bad for them - the two womens&#39; wrists and arms must hurt if they had to hold up their heads with them all of the time.<br />
<br />
At the sight of the next mutant, Brittany hurriedly opened the door to her Jeep and got out, running to her and dragging you along with her.  Though taken aback and initially cautiously backing away, after you hurriedly explained the situation and said what Brittany was mentally screaming at you to say, the transformed girl, a friend of Brittany&#39;s named Gina, gasped and awkwardly hugged you and Brittany, rubbing her on the back, saying that it was okay, before saying that it was nice to meet you.  You barely managed to stutter a &quot;you too,&quot; thanks to not just the awkward situation but because of Brittany&#39;s mental crying, and Gina&#39;s insane body.<br />
The girl was supposed to be supposed to be, according to Brittany short - barely 5 feet tall.  However, she now towered over you and your &quot;bodymate&quot; by about two feet.  Her torso and head proportions still stayed the same - short, around 2-3 feet tall as Brittany was familiar with, but her THREE legs were extremely long, at least 4 feet long.  These were shaved, soft and supple, connected to the rest of Gina&#39;s body by three beautiful buttocks.  You could clearly see the outlines of the mounds under the long towel she tied around her waist - it made sense, nothing Gina had probably fit her legs.  Brittany sternly told you to take your eyes off of her friend&#39;s ass(es), but you had a hunch that she was also, secretly, telling her own mind as well.  Looking up, you saw, again, the reason why it felt so odd to hug Gina, wrapped in another large towel her normal arms were sticking out from under.  <br />
In the middle of her now massive cleavage (they had to be HH-cups) that looked incredibly out of place on her small upper frame, was a short, flaccid, stubby penis, uncircumcised, that was incredibly girthy - without a doubt, just as wide as a large Planters&#39; peanuts can.  Dangling in between her perky breasts, its head&#39;s outline was faintly seen on the towel, but most of its length and base peeked over the towel.<br />
<br />
Noticing your face and your attention, Gina giggled nervously, fixing her green cap and glasses, before crossing her right leg around her middle one.  As there were no shoes for a third foot, you and Brittany could see that it ended in an evenly divided, 5-toed foot with a big toe at its center.<br />
Gina was hard in no time, the penis now about 2 feet long, and obscuring her vision.  Gina politely excused herself and ran, with all three legs, to her own house, slamming the door behind her.<br />
<br />
And then Brittany heard her mom&#39;s voice coming from within her house.</p>
