<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Spinning the wheel without making it easier to spin via magic was surprisingly refreshing. Sure she had Tyler and Lilly (Tylly... hehe...) spin the wheel from the other side just in case her body gives out and to show face in front of the crowd, but it still felt like she was putting in &quot;Effort&quot;. In fact, she hasn&#39;t been having so much fun in transforming someone since Lilly first appeared. Ironically, the woman is once again giving her more excitement then she had the many years before Lilly came. Maybe more so then the &quot;Whale&quot; incident. Personally, she has nothing against Lilly per say. She&#39;s a very energetic girl with a great personality, who is not afraid of transformation. She&#39;s a very friendly young woman who just graduated high school and left her family to make a living on her own. It&#39;s a complete coincidence, that Lilly just happens to find Madame Illustria&#39;s tent. Madame remember&#39;s fondly when Lilly eagerly volunteered and walked up the stage without being called up, after watching the last victim get transformed and sent out to defend for herself. Lilly was smiling through the whole time of her first transformation and she was eagerly experimenting with her animal parts. She was even making suggestions. Usually, when Illustria transforms a deserving victim, she transforms them only partially because A) they are on the verge of losing their sanity and no sanity equals no suffering, B) No lesson can be learned without any humanity, C) Illustria simply lost the motivation to fully transform someone anymore; it&#39;s boring. That is, untill Lilly came along, she requested certain transformations, endured whatever Illustria put her through, and happily walked out the tent with a fully transformed chimera body and humanity fully intact. Illustria was inpressed, so she and Stephan came up to Lilly later that day while she was trying to open a potato bag with octopus tentacles. She offered Lilly to be Illustria&#39;s assistant to test out more transformations and she happily accepted. Lilly was like the lively, energetic  daughter Illustria never had. Heck, Lilly was perfectly willing to test out different genitals with other WoC victims. Lilly was also a great help testing out changes Illustria haven&#39;t tried yet. To be honest, Illustria doesn&#39;t really mind Lilly being Stefen&#39;s girlfriend and eventual granddaughter in law. Illustria fondly remembers the time Lilly asked Madame about her name. Believe it or not, Madame Illustria is her first and last name. That&#39;s why she doesn&#39;t mind being called either. It&#39;s a long story. The only reason Illustria used her magic to seal away Lilly&#39;s mind was because of Lilly&#39;s last testing session. Illustria has just finished fully transforming Lilly, when she suddenly became human again. Lilly assumed Illustria simply turned her back to human, but in fact Lilly unconcisouly turned herself back. Lilly doesn&#39;t realize this, but it turns out she has more magical power then Stephen and Illustria combined. What worries Illusia is that Lilly defiantly have ambition. Illusia admit that she is a very cowardly person to have full control of her show, but nether-less, it&#39;s safe to just prevent lilly from being too powerful on the off chance she turns on Illustria. <br />
<br />
Speaking of Lilly, What about the man she&#39;s fused too. Tyler hasn&#39;t been resisting at all for awhile. If this keeps up, his new testicles will burst before the show is over... Oh yeah! Illustria forgot she has been controlling them the whole time they been merged to keep them standing for the show. Hehe, even a experienced old lady forgets she&#39;s doing something... again. Oh well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Tyler. Stop.&quot; Tyler was about to turn the wheel with his trunk when he stopped.  &quot;You need to release steam, right?&quot; Illusion said. &#39;That&#39;s right bitch&#39; Tyler thought strainfully. &quot;Alright, you are free to Release.&quot; Madame waved didmissily. &#39;THANK gooooooodneeessss.&#39; Tyler thought thankfully. <br />
<br />
As soon as Illustria released her magic, Tyler and Lilly imedily fell backward on their slick crocodile head feet and painfully on the back of his head. That also painfully hit their inverted knees. But Tyler didn&#39;t care. He imedily tried to grab his dick with his raccoon arm but then he released they were to short. He then tried to grab it with his trunk but then realized he couldn&#39;t grab it behind Lilly. Even if Lilly was self aware, She couldn&#39;t reach her dick with her raccoon arms either. Maybe if she use her trunk, she MIGHT be able to grab it but her mind is long gone by now. With this realization, Tyler began to cry in humidly. He&#39;s going to be a freak for the rest of his life, he can&#39;t keep balanced with his crocodile-head feet AND he can&#39;t grab his dick and release his cum. Even his crocodile heads open and close their jaws in distress. He may have control over his body now but so what. If he can&#39;t stand on his own two feet, then he is as good an farm animal now. All those football scholarships he worked so hard for are now useless. That dahm PE teacher of a father would be laughing at him when he gets home. If he recognizes Tyler that is. He&#39;ll probably call the zoo if he sees him now. Heck, he will probably go straight  to some government lab to be tested on. All this because he wouldn&#39;t close his fuckn&#39; mouth about magic. What&#39;s the point of muscle if you can&#39;t use it? What&#39;s the point. &#39;Come on you bitch, what do you want from me? I believe in magic now.. I beleive in magic.. in the blink of a eye I lost my whole life to a stupid mistake. if only i had another chance to make it right. Please! I BELEIVVVVVEEEE!!!!!!&#39;<br />
<br />
As Madame Illustria was pondering what to do with Tyler, a spark went off in Lilly&#39;s head. &quot;I believe in magic..&quot;  Somewhere in Lilly&#39;s head, In a small part of Madame&#39;s tent that Lilly calls her home, she suddenly herd a voice. &quot;What was that?&quot; Lilly said out loud. She was in middle of writing in her transformation journal when she suddenly heard a man&#39;s voice Lilly didn&#39;t recognize, somewhere in the tent. &quot;Looks like another customer is lost in Madame&#39;s tent. And I was having so much fun with this transformation drawing too.&quot; Ever since Lilly was a kid, she been drawing different mismatched combinations of chimera creatures. This habit eventually made Lilly wonder what would it be like to have different animal parts. Ever since then, she had this crazy fantasy to have the power to shape shift without strings attached. This fantasy wasn&#39;t a big deal throughout her school life (except for for those TF sites..) But when she happen upon Madame Illustria&#39;s tent, she knew this is probably her only chance to transform, to control different animal parts. Transformed forever or not, she&#39;s glad Madame let her pick the body parts she will be stuck with for life. So when Madame asked her to be her assistant, she jumped at the chance to experiment with more body parts and see how they work compared to human body parts. Come to think of it, she hasn&#39;t seen Madame or Stephan for awhile. She was busy drawing these cool transformations that she completely forgot about them. This is odd, because Madame and Stephan has been been her best friends for the last two years. Especially Stephan. . . Come to think of it, Lilly hasn&#39;t seen Madame since her last Testing Session. Odd. Oh well. Either way, she should probably help that lost customer before he finds something he will regret. It&#39;s a shame she couldn&#39;t finish her latest transformation sketch before she goes. It&#39;s her most creative TF idea yet, with chicken-horse legs, male and female torsos, four instead of two testicles, and so much more. She better ask Madame if she could test out this transformation later. Once Lilly left her room she too, became lost. The tent just seems to be bigger then before. Which is odd saying the tent can turn into a horse-drawn origami carriage and work as both as a festival tent and a solo tent. &quot;I BELEIVVVVVEEEE!!!!!!&quot; Lilly followed the sound of the lost customer&#39;s voice until she ran through a passageway filled with blinding light.<br />
<br />
When Lilly opened her eyes again, she was in the middle of the show stage. She can tell by the sound of restless men&#39;s voices. Did Illusia bring in the gay audience again? What she finds odd is that she seems to be lying on top of someone. When she tried to sit up she found she can only go up so far. . . and that she now has raccoon arms. She can tell by how short they are. She craned her neck a bit to look around until she saw Madame standing next to the wheel of change, a big mirror on wheels next to that, and Stephan standing in the the shadows. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; She tried to ask , but her tongue doesn&#39;t seem to be working. The response she got seems to be from the lost costumer. &#39;Who-who are yooouuuu?&#39; Somehow she knew it was from the person below her. &quot; I&#39;m Lilly Perkins! How are you?&quot; She tried to say but all that came out where gruteral sounds. However, Mr. Customer seems to hear her. &#39;What! your that bitch who&#39;s merged with me? FUCK YOU!!!!!!!&#39; Mr. Costumer screamed. &#39;Wha&#39; was Lilly&#39;s only response. That is until she got a closer look of what was on that mirror. Lilly was a little shocked at first, but slowly everything made sense. She must be helping this customer with a transformation and Madame somehow went overboard. What bothers Lilly is that her current body looks exactly like her unfinished transformation sketch. Living with Madame were weird before, but this bites the cake. It looks like she is the lean female torsal and Mr. Customer is the muscular male tarsal. She got to hand it to Madame, these Crocodile-Head feet are really cool! It&#39;s going to take awhile to get used to controlling these feet but. . . Wait a minute, how is she talking to Mr. Customer? And who is he? Maybe sharing the same body gave them a telepathic connection. Well, telepathic communication will make things convenient. So she tried again. &#39;What&#39;s your name? I can&#39;t keep calling you Mr. Customer if I&#39;m going to be part of you, I should at least know your name.&#39; Lilly asked. &#39;I&#39;m Tyler Hain, you sluuutttt. . .&#39; It sounds like he needs to cum. &#39;Alright were&#39;s your cock?&#39; &#39;You mean our dickginaaa. . . Jerk it off with your trunk NOWWWWWW!!!!!!!&#39;  Trunk? Oh yeah! Lilly did as she was told, gabbing her dick (clit?) with her elephant trunk. For some reason, Lilly is not feeling any sexual urges from her dick/clit. Nether the less, Tyler shot out chunks of bull cum out imedily. . . All over the Wheel of change. . . Oh dear.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Madame Illusia and Stephan Illusia were both thinking rapidly. As soon as Lilly tried to speak, they both imedily knew Lilly somehow fully recovered from her TF addiction. Stephan began plotting on how he was going to help Lilly after the show. Too many eye witnesses now. Illusia has a similar mind set. She doesn&#39;t know what to think of this. Did Lilly&#39;s mind became unsealed because of her latent magical power, Tyler&#39;s bodily connection to Lilly or both? Either way, she can&#39;t do anything about it until after the show. Speaking of the show, the Wheel of change seems to be glowing after Tyler cummed on it. hmmmm.. . come to think of it, Illusia may have used her. . . juice to complete her magical connection to the wheel of change when she made it. Ohhh those younger days, when she was a slave girl. . . *sign* Wait, does this mean Tyler and Lilly has a connection to the wheel too? This is bad. Madame won&#39;t be able to change them back to human with that bond to the wheel. That would mean the wheel would be endlessly changing Lilly and Tyler and no one can stop it. Not even Madame herself can stop it. Not even destroying it would do the job. Ugh. The only way to solve the problem is to create a new wheel and sacrifice it to break the bond between the old wheel and Tyler and Lilly. But it took years to travel around the world and collect the necessary materials for the wheel the first time. Those same materials doesn&#39;t exist in the world anymore. She have to hunt for substitutes. What a pain! It was bad that she no longer have control over the wheel any more, but now she have to take a journey around the world after the show just to make another Wheel of Change. First, she have to go to the town of Glendale (home of Lilly&#39;s cousin, Kyle Perkins) to get a sample of the transform or dare curse. Second, she have to get help from Jesse and Andy &quot;The dick size swappers&quot;, her former volunteers. Then she have to pay a visit to her irritating daughter, who founded a academy who dedicate themselves to kidnapping young men, wiping their memory, and using SCIENCE and brain washing to turn them into pretty little girls. Illusia has a problem with that. A) magic is SO much easier, B) what&#39;s the point of &quot;Treating&quot; someone&#39;s mind? That&#39;s that same thing as erasing someone&#39;s mind and replacing it with someone else&#39;s. And of course, Illusia also have to pay a visit to here great grandmother, a perverted witch who lived in the Mid-evil ages who gets off transforming princes. And that&#39;s only the beginning of her to-do list. The real question is when she does make a new wheel of change, will she use it to help Tyler and Lilly  only to make a THIRD wheel after words OR just continue her show with the second wheel.<br />
<br />
Well she&#39;ll just have to worry about that later, the show must go on. hmm. The wheel is glowing and Tyler and Lilly&#39;s feet are twitching. Just in case, Illusia took control of Tyler and Lilly&#39;s body again and stood them up. And just in time too.<br />
<br />
Just like when &quot;Tilly&#39;s&quot; horse feet became chicken-horse feet, &quot;Tilly&#39;s&quot; crocodile head-feet began to split up into four toes, positioned like chicken feet. three crocodile heads facing forward and one facing back on each foot. Tyler and Lilly were severely disorientated with eight pairs of crocodile eyes but as soon as they closed all sixteen of them, they were okay. The constant smell was just something they have to deal with.But the transformation wasn&#39;t done. At the base of the legs, in between the heads, a horse hoove grows in the middle, lifting the crocodile head toes slightly. To make the heads more comfortable, chicken talons grow on the chins of the crocodile-head-toes. Once the transformation was done, Madame Illusia released her magical hold on &quot;Tylly&quot;. It was uncomfortable to stand on their crocodile throats at first, but least they can stand with four crocodile head toes instead of one. The inverted and bendable chicken knees helps too. When Tyler and Lilly tried walking,They started bobbing back and forward like a chicken. With the exception of the missing tail, they now have completely transformed legs.<br />
<br />
Lilly was having a lot of fun, while the now clear headed Tyler was disgusted by his new legs. &#39;How can I live like this?&#39; Tyler thought.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the broken wheel of change began spinning on it&#39;s own. it stopped, showed it&#39;s words for a few seconds, then started spinning again. Illusia managed to catch the the words and said it out load, almost to her self. <br />
<br />
&quot;Donkey cock head-face&quot;.<br />
<br />
Tyler screamed in outrage as the changes began. First, Tyler&#39;s and Lilly&#39;s faces started to wrinkle more then any old person in the tent. Then their faces started to round out into a mushroom shape. Then their mouths rotated into vertical slits, their hyena tongs still sticking out, slobbering with saliva. Within moments, their faces became the heads of donkey cocks. Their faces now have black splotches like a real Donkey cock. The only thing still on their faces is their human eyes, elephant trunks, and the hyena tungs. Besides from the elephant trumpets, the best Tyler can do is to create these weird guttural sounds with his new mouth.  Granted, Tyler and Lilly still have their human heads and necks, but it now looks like they have a fleshy bowl/mushroom head over their faces.  Tyler practically cried again. His peers always called him a ass and a dick. Now he literally is. Lilly on the other hand, is licking her face with her dog tong and testing out her sideways mouth with fascination in her eyes.<br />
<br />
But there was no time for rest, for the broken wheel stopped, Illusia reads it, then it started spinning on it&#39;s own again.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Book-mouth?&quot; Madame Illusia said out load. Illusia digresses, the wheel CAN do inanimate objects.<br />
<br />
<br />
From the audiences perspective, the duo trumpeted in confusion at what Illusia said. Suddenly, their flat hyena toughs became even wider and MUCH more flatter. Their mouths became wider as a result, giving them a sideways frog/fish mouth appearance. But that didn&#39;t last very long as their lips started to give off a thick leathery texture. Then very slowly and painfully, their hard, dry lips started stretching over their now paper like pink tongues. When their lips stopped stretching, it looked like a rectangular pink duck&#39;s bill. However, as soon as that&#39;s done, Tyler and Lilly&#39;s tongs started splitting up in to multiple page-like tongues filling up their rectangular, book cover like beaks. By the end of it, it looked like a flesh colored book for a mouth. the real difference is that the page tongues are as long as hyena tongs, saliva soaking and dripping from them like a mop. Another noticeable thing is that the book-mouth-beak is vertically sideways like the donkey dick hole.The funny thing is that the words &quot;Cook Book&quot; can be seen on the cover of the Lilly&#39;s beak and Tyler&#39;s beak has &quot;Sex Toy&quot;, a hentai magazine name printed on his.<br />
<br />
Before the wheel stopped again, Madame decided to take control of the show again. &quot;Alright audience, your last suggestion was very creative. So any other suggestions?&quot;<br />
&quot;crocodile cock tongues!&quot; &quot;Dick Neck!&quot; &quot;Cock udders!&quot; &quot;Dick Nipples!&quot; &quot;Giraffe neck&quot; &quot;All bodily fluids as cum!!!&quot; Madame caught that last suggestion. &quot;I Like that last one!  Here is some bunny ears for your trouble!&quot; Illusia snapped her fingers and the man in the audience who said &quot;All bodily fluids is cum!!!&quot; suddenly grew rabbit ears. &quot;Wha-what!&quot; the man in the stands stammered. After that was done, Illusia snapped her fingers again. In the blink of a eye, the Saliva dripping from Tyler and Lilly&#39;s hard book cover-beaks suddenly became yellow and chunky bull cum. Tyler was nauseated by the fact he will be tasting disgusting bull cum for the rest of his life. Lilly thought the bull cum plus the air ruffling her pages were a little too much, but if she have to get used to them, then she would have to get used to it. <br />
<br />
Madame walked up to the duo&#39;s leaking dickgina and udders. To test out a theory, she gave the udders a hard tug. They imedily squirted out thick bull cum. In fact, that started lactating cum. Tyler was moaning in pleasure. Madame looked at Tyler&#39;s eyes and saw them tearing up yellow cum. In fact, both Tyler&#39;s and Lilly&#39;s eyes were now a pure cloudy yellow because of the cum. Tyler and Lilly can still see, but now every thing to them is in a cloudy, yellow color. All they can see is dark and light yellow objects. Another thing Madame notice that their body (especially the bull testicles) was now secreting thick bull cum instead of sweat. Maybe their brain chemistry is different because of the bull cum too? And what about their blood? In fact all their bare skin that is still showing is now in a yellow-greenish tint. Because of all the cum, Tyler and Lilly&#39;s entire bodies started to smell like bull cum.<br />
<br />
Before Madame Illusia could look over Tyler and Lilly&#39;s body any more, the Broken cum covered Wheel of Change suddenly stopped. As Madam reads the change, Lilly was cautiously optimistic while Tyler was terrified for his very being. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright gentlemen, the next change is...&quot;</p>
