<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before Tad and his mother moved to town on Wednesday morning, in what would surprise many as a return to Moon Lake of a were-family that at some point for some reason left Moon Lake, Moon Lake&#39;s newest vixen, Jenny Harper, did not have a great night. Her night started well as she drifted off to sleep in Harry&#39;s arms and her dreams did initially start well with her and Harry being together, but as time went on the fears in the back of her mind and some of the mental scars from her forced transformation and the lengthy period of her transformation being incomplete lead things becoming darker. In fact it became a real nightmare.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Jenny walked quietly up the aisle in Moon Lake&#39;s Baptist Church with many people present and watching. She looked out to see that Harry was waiting for her at the end of the aisle and was standing next to the minister. Seeing Harry made her smile. She approached and stood before him. She reached for Harry&#39;s hands and took them in her own. They stood together and looked to the minister. He gave a brief smile to both of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dearly beloved we are gathered here today to join Jennifer Harper and her chosen mate...&quot; the minister began and looked to Jenny and gave an odd smile to her, &quot;Dieter Wilhelm...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; Jenny gasped and jumped back, &quot;No! My chosen... my BONDED mate is Harry!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I bought him out, dear,&quot; came a voice Jenny recognized and cringed at. It was rather high pitched for a man&#39;s voice and sounded like he was talking through his nose. It made her turn to see Dieter Wilhelm looking at her. He was dressed in the uniform that his father&#39;s power company technicians wore with a small gold lightning bolt above his chest pocket. &quot;Poor people like him are all alike. You give them fifty bucks and promise a thousand and you have them for life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny backed away and shook her hands, as if trying to get something off of them. She didn&#39;t notice but everyone else in the church seemed to have vanished without a trace. Dieter simply advanced on her as she backed away. A confident smile on his face. He backed her against the wall of the empty church.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, my dear,&quot; Dieter said to her with a smile that Jenny found creepy, &quot;You know you love me. We&#39;ve been everywhere together. You&#39;ve always wanted me... but wanted to wait to appease your folks. I can understand that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dieter leaned against the wall so that he blocked Jenny off from the exit to the church. Jenny couldn&#39;t back away any further and she couldn&#39;t get to the door without going through him. Dieter only ogled her like she was to be stared at lustfully. It creeped her out, but for the moment she couldn&#39;t really do too much about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you certainly did a lot to be good for me,&quot;  Dieter gave a lewd smile, &quot;you were lovely before and now you went out and got nice big breasts... just for me...&quot;<br />
<br />
He then reached forward and ran one finger along the curve of her bosom where it was covered by her dress. He just smiled at her and then brought up his other hand to cup her other breast. The smile never left his face, but at his point Jenny could take no more. She brought her arms out and pushed Dieter away from her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t love you!&quot; Jenny snarled, &quot;I NEVER loved you, you lewd drunken bastard!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; Dieter charged at her, now looking a bit angry.<br />
<br />
Jenny caught him before he could do anything and even her dress, she brought knee up and caught Dieter in the groin as hard as she could. He gave a week groan as Jenny&#39;s knee to the groin was strong enough to throw him away from her and he stumbled backward into the wooden front divider in front of the church pews. He lay there for a few moments gripping at his damaged equipment while Jenny towered over him. At that moment, the dream felt kinda good, but it wasn&#39;t the result she wanted. Jenny might not like Dieter Wilhelm personally, but beating him up was NEVER on her agenda. Her agenda was to be with Harry and love him and feel his love for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t love you and never did,&quot; Jenny said firmly, &quot;I love Harry and only him... for as long as I live.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, she rushed out of the church to begin looking for her dog-fox. She had to find Harry. She ran out of the church and thought it was rather bright as there seemed to be a lot of light outside the church door. She ran straight through the doorway, though the light was so bright that when she went through the doorway, she had to close her eyes for a moment. It took a few moments for Jenny to regain her senses after going out of the church. However, when she opened her eyes, what she thought had been the case when she had been in the church. It was rather dark out and Jenny was actually outside Moon Lake&#39;s local strip club, which wasn&#39;t too far from the movie theater that Karen and Peter went to (though Jenny didn&#39;t know that). The change in locale puzzled Jenny heavily as she looked around, wondering how she could have got there. However, her issues with the locale couldn&#39;t be fully answered as a male voice made her turn forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jennifer Harper,&quot; came her father&#39;s voice, gruff and worn, but also firm and harsh, &quot;your mother and I are VERY disappointed in you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny turned to look forward and saw her father and mother standing in front of her. Her father had a deep frown and her mother looked down toward her father&#39;s feet. It was like she couldn&#39;t look at her daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad...&quot; Jenny said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are very disappointed in you,&quot; her father spoke, &quot;you worked hard to get into college. Got good grades and got a full scholarship at Moon Lake based on your grades.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And...&quot; Jenny began.<br />
<br />
&quot;We expected you to continue to come here to work hard,&quot; her father said firmly with his mouth straight and his eyes narrowed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have!&quot; Jenny stated, &quot;I...&quot;<br />
<br />
Her father then cut her off, not letting her continue.<br />
<br />
&quot;We did not let you come here so you could work in a whorehouse!&quot; her father growled angrily as he looked to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I&#39;m not a whore! I&#39;m not a prostitute!&quot; Jenny argued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good girls don&#39;t have hips and chests like that!&quot; her mother said softly but harshly. Her eyes looked to Jenny for a moment but soon looked away toward her father&#39;s feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;And only a whore would dress so provocatively,&quot; her father snarled.<br />
<br />
&quot;But...&quot; Jenny began to argue as she backed up slightly and then looked down.<br />
<br />
Instead of the wedding dress she&#39;d been wearing earlier in the dream. She was now wearing a dark colored tube top that squeezed her bosom tightly and only a thin cream colored bra was seen outside of the tube top. The top only came down a few inches below her breasts and no further. On her hips was a pair of short shorts that were made out of a black shiny material. They clung to her hips and butt tightly but didn&#39;t necessarily cover everything. Blue strings from a pair of thong panties hung higher up her hips. The parts of her shorts that came down her legs barely covered her legs and they seemed to bunch a bit on the inside of her legs and didn&#39;t fully cover the bottom of her butt. There was a small bit of skin between the shorts and a pair of high healed boots that rose up her legs and up her thighs. The boots did enough to let Jenny bend and move in them, but was also of a shiny material and caught by some of the light coming from street lamps.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe you would behave so lewdly!&quot; her growled angrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;But...&quot; Jenny began.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here you are, I&#39;ve been looking all over for you,&quot; came a new voice from behind Jenny. This voice was feminine and also familiar to Jenny.<br />
<br />
&quot;You...&quot; Jenny gasped as she turned to face the rogue werevixen, Yvette Smith and her eyes widened as she turned.<br />
<br />
Standing on Yvette&#39;s arm was Harry in a pair of black slacks and a man&#39;s white tank-top.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will address me as MISTRESS,&quot; Yvette answered, &quot;Now I&#39;ve been looking all over for you. One of your clients is waiting for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Client?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Funny,&quot; Yvette answered, &quot;You&#39;re one of my best whores and this client is high paying. And remember that your pay is determined by the number of orgasms the client has. If you DON&#39;T please him... you get nothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not a whore!&quot; Jenny cried out and backed away.<br />
<br />
However, her backing away only took her into her father who pushed her from behind. She stumbled into Yvette&#39;s arms because of the boots she was wearing. The rogue werefox caught her and stood Jenny up next to her. Jenny only looked back to her father. He only looked back to her with some degree of anger on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;My daughter is not a whore,&quot; her father snarled, &quot;I don&#39;t know what happened to her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny watched as he and her mother turned and began to walk away. Jenny reached for them, but they only kept walking away. Yvette, meanwhile, grabbed Jenny by her other arm and began to drag her into the strip club. With this, Jenny turned to Harry, who she hoped would protect her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Harry...&quot; Jenny said weakly.<br />
<br />
But Harry seemed to be gone again. Like he had never been there before.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure who this Harry is,&quot; Yvette growled to her, &quot;but you have work to do, whore.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Jenny screamed.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;NNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!&quot; Jenny screamed loudly as she shook herself awake in Harry&#39;s arms.<br />
<br />
Her scream jolted Harry awake and also awakened Karen on her bed on the other side of the dorm room.</p>
