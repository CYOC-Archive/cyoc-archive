<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lisa was glad to have seen Ty, if even briefly. She wanted to see him again. After she bid her parents good night, and went to her room, she looked at the closed portal door that led to Ty&#39;s bedroom. It would be so easy to knock on that door. Or just open it. She had already, when her parents had first grounded them, tried to convince Ty that he didn&#39;t have to go along with it. Now she was ashamed at having done that. She knew he wanted it too, but it was selfish of her to ask him to break his agreement with her parents. But if she opened the door, and went into Ty&#39;s room, well, that wouldn&#39;t be his fault, would it? And as long as her parents, and Ty&#39;s parents, never found out...<br />
<br />
But no, she realized. As much as she wanted to see Ty, she didn&#39;t actually want to disobey her parents. The one week of grounding seemed like forever to her, but she realized it was actually a rather minimal punishment, for Ty having broken the cardinal  rule about never harming her. And if she violated the agreed upon punishment, or made Ty do so, her parents might forbid them EVER from seeing each other again.<br />
<br />
Of course, her parents had no way to enforce that, and they knew it. But if Lisa or Ty just ignored her parents rules, which Lisa had to admit, were not unreasonable, it would absolutely and permanently ruin both her and Ty&#39;s relationship with her parents. Even though Lisa was somewhat angry with Diego and Maria right now (and she realized her anger was unreasonable), she loved her parents, and never wanted to hurt them, or damage her relationship with them.<br />
<br />
But it still seemed unfair. If Ty did something bad to her, and then undid it again, making her good as new, had he really harmed her? And if the thing that had turned out to be bad, was her own request? Maybe she&#39;d been harmed, briefly, but Ty had set it right, so did it really break the rule? Lisa thought there should be an exception for that. For when the harm was accidental, and had been repaired. Maybe she should talk to her parents about it. She wasn&#39;t sure that she could convince them, but it wouldn&#39;t hurt to try.<br />
<br />
She was glad that Ty was being honorable, and sticking to his word, even though she thought he was probably just as unhappy as she was. That he was toughing it out was setting a good example for her. If he could somehow make it through the week without her, she could make it through the week without him. It just seemed so hard!<br />
<br />
She&#39;d felt a bit jealous today upon learning of Ty transforming his mother, June, into app form. Lisa had never asked him not to transform others, but the transformations they&#39;d done together had somehow seemed... personal, special, and she didn&#39;t like the idea of sharing them. She remembered hearing June comment about wanting to try app form, after she had helped Ty resolve the consent problem with Lisa being in app form. At the time, she hadn&#39;t given that a lot of thought, though she was now a bit surprised that June had decided to follow through.<br />
<br />
Well, Lisa thought, I don&#39;t _own_ the transformations. If anyone does, it&#39;s Ty. So if June wanted to be an app, it was nice that Ty let her do that. Lisa told herself that, anyhow, but she didn&#39;t really convince herself. She still felt jealous, even knowing that it was unreasonable. But June _had_ been the one who solved that consent problem, Lisa thought. She deserves to get to use app form if she wants it. That realization made her feel better about sharing it with June. Her jealousy went away. Maybe it was actually a special bond between them now. Lisa really liked June, and certainly never wanted anything to come between them, like petty jealousy.<br />
<br />
But for now, Lisa needed to somehow take her mind off Ty. Last night she had been at least partially successful at that by making several copies of herself, and using several transformations. Would that work again tonight?<br />
<br />
She transformed herself into mattress topper and pillows form, which always felt nice. Especially nice with Ty, but she tried not to think about that. She made a human copy of herself, lying atop her, and the feeling of that weight upon her immediately made her feel even better. &quot;Let human me decide what else to do, if anything,&quot; she thought. Somehat uncharitably.<br />
<br />
She felt her human body grab one of her breast pillows, and toss and turn a bit before settling down. A little later she felt a kitten jump onto her, and lie on her other pillow.<br />
<br />
The three of her went to sleep.</p>
