<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex breathed in deeply. He was standing there in only his boxer brief, as his clothes were in the hamper, and made another of his magical declarations.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ben and I are senior students at the local High school. I’m the quarterback in the school’s football varsity team.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex hold onto the sink as he lost a few inches. He was probably still among the taller boys in his class, but he was not his former 6’1 anymore. Maybe just a notch under 6 feet. The short beard Alex had proudly sported a minute ago had faded into an unassuming stubble of a reddish-blond colour, while his curly hair was grown longer and definitely in a younger fashion. His face as a whole looked overall way younger, and the freckles on his face were more prominent. He turned his head right and left, noticing his mustache, sideburns and beard did not connect yet. In awe, he quickly looked at his body, still hairy, with a patch between his pecs, and a line leading to his groin, which was closer, but still a bit denser than how lightly hairy Ben would be at 29. His musculature and shape seemed to have shifted a bit too. The shoulders were definitely narrower. Alex was about to grab the waistband of his boxers to take a look there when the door opened behind him. Damned habit of not locking the door when he was alone in the apartment with his fiancé. <br />
<br />
As his eyes shot up on the mirror to see who was sneaking on him, he took a mental note to investigate his marital status. To his relief, Alex saw a boy his age behind him. Still wearing a tank top and boxer shorts, it was pretty obvious the glass-wearing Asian was Ben. He was slimmer, and quite smaller than Alex, to his surprise. Perhaps Ben had a later growth spurt. Alex still thought he was very handsome, with his nerdy look. Adult Ben didn’t strike him as nerdy, though. It probably had to do with the silhouette. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you not coming to bed, Alex? Mom will get upset if she hears a sound after ten. Ugh. You know how she gets.&quot; He stopped there for a second, analyzing Alex. &quot;What are you doing? Checking yourself out?&quot;<br />
&quot;That’s my job!&quot; he added after he took two quick steps to whisper to Alex’s hear. Alex made a rather stupid-sounding, and he followed Ben to his room, his clothes in his hand – rather than the hamper, he noticed, which was logical as he didn’t live at Ben’s – and the other in his line of sight, still ringed to his surprise. Alex noticed the apartment hadn’t changed much in the layout, but the decoration and furniture were definitely different than the one the young gay couple had this afternoon. For one thing, Ben’s office was now his rather small bedroom. Ben had just closed the door behind him when he almost literally jumped to Alex, kissing him as is he hadn’t seen him in ages. Alex kissed back and broke the kiss, laughing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything’s alright, Sweety?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes… I’ve just spent the whole day refraining from kissing you and touching you. You can’t blame me for being impatient.&quot; It seemed like there was not only the guy that was impatient, as he pressed a little closer in, his chub against Alex’s thigh. The jock squinted for a second, realizing they had to hide themselves. Where Ben’s parents really oblivious to their relationship, thinking Alex was just a friend having frequent sleepovers? In a rather small bed, he mentally added as he glanced at the bed. This was an easy fix.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, your parents know we’re together, and they are totally chill with this. You remember how I accidentally let out that our first date was a date? Plus, we’re engaged...&quot;Alex just remembered the rings on their fingers.<br />
&quot;Yes, I know. I hadn’t told you I was anxious of their reaction. I don’t hold it to you, you know... It was my omission, and it turned out okay.&quot;<br />
&quot;Of course, I know. But don’t worry, Ben. They don’t mind me sleeping over. That’s all I wanted to say.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know that. I’m just shy : I don’t like PDA in front of my family. It feels… odd.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex could not know if it had always been Ben’s concern, or if it shifted to accommodate his new changes to reality. At least, he was sure that his in-laws would not give them any kind of trouble. Searching in his newest memories, Alex figured he never saw Ben’s parent display any sort of affection. Maybe their flame was spent, or they were just reserved people.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe you were telling me this…&quot; Alex resumed their kissing, his hands slipping under Ben’s underwear. Ben did not resist and they were soon laying together in bed, hugging and exploring each other. Both were soon sporting full-mast erections, and Alex hushed to his boyfriend’s ear :<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want to have sex?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben didn’t answer, and contended himself into staring at the wall across the room. On the other side of it was the bathroom, and on the other side of the bathroom was the master bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;The building soundproofed all the walls using the best technologies&quot;, Alex fake-protested. Sure enough, that seemed to reason Ben and calm him down a bit. <br />
&quot;I know, Alex. That’s why we moved here : I can practice my music without bothering any neighbour.&quot;<br />
&quot;Tell me honestly what you think about this, Ben. If you’re not, it’s alright.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben seemed mesmerized as he seemed to think of the answer. <br />
<br />
&quot;I’m fine, Alex. I love you. I want us to make love to each other. Tonight is as good a time as another for our first time. I…&quot;<br />
Alex was a bit astonished. He didn’t think the direct order would work like that, or that he was so vague that he would get all of the thoughts on the matter. Alex blushed at the next sentence. He was the one who was lucky to be with Ben.<br />
&quot;I can’t believe I’m about to sleep with a hot jock. I’m worried we won’t know who’s on top or not. I bought lube and condoms online, a while ago. It’s in a box in my closet. I used my…&quot;<br />
&quot;You can stop talking if you want. I understand you’re nervous, Sweetie. It’s normal ; I would be lying if I’d tell you I wasn’t stressed at all. Everything will be alright.&quot;<br />
<br />
That, Alex knows. Alex experienced it this very morning. Furthermore, whether he realized it or not, Alex also told Ben he was good at this, when they were in the shower. The odds that this was a lie are basically non-existent. Plus, saying it right now just sealed the deal. He could be growing fond of this newfound power<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Baby, you’re right&quot;, replied Ben with a newfound confidence. &quot;I guess we should first take care of this, then&quot;, he added while his hand grabbed Alex’s now deflated member, and leaned in for a new kiss. It wasn’t long before the meat sticks in his hand and between his legs grew back. It was a bit awkward, from the moment they took out the condoms and the lube, but it was still about to be quite the fun ride.</p>
