<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was  brief pause before the door opened a crack and Jen saw Betty&#39;s eye peering through. Then the door was opened wider to reveal Betty&#39;s smiling face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was wondering when you would be brought to me.&quot; She said happily. &quot;Come on in. Me and Opal are just getting the last of the new students ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Alice said apologetically, &quot;We were discussing arrangements with Jen&#39;s mother, and then Jen and I had a bit of girl-talk in the hall as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Further conversation was interrupted by the crackle of a radio.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alice, You&#39;re needed down in the kennel. One of the girls somehow managed to lock herself in her cage and is trying to get her pads off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice let out a heavy sigh and pulled the radio from her belt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you actually need me, or are you just trying to avoid doing work?&quot; Alice said into the small black device.<br />
<br />
&quot;We actually need you. She managed to nab Monica&#39;s keys and you&#39;re the only one aside from Amelia and Betty that currently have copies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, I&#39;m on my way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice sighed again and clipped the radio to her belt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Betty, but I&#39;m going to have to leave Jen with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s quite all right.&quot; Betty said cheerily. &quot;I&#39;ll take charge of her from here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice nodded at Jen and Betty, then sprinted off towards the kennels. The two of them watched her until she rounded the corner, then Betty detached the leash from Jen&#39;s collar and held the door open for her.<br />
<br />
The room was just as Jen remembered it. Though there were now boxes stacked up against the wall next to the door. They all had the school&#39;s logo printed on them along with labels showing simplified images of their contents. Jen recognized the collar and pads depicted. Looking at the boxes she guessed that they had enough supplies to accommodate half the students at her high school if they wanted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello again, Jen.&quot; Nurse Opal said brightly. &quot;Give me a minute to finish up with this one here and we&#39;ll get you examined and officially checked in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen looked up at the girl sitting on the exam table. She was blonde almost to the point of white and heavyset. Not fat, though she had some slight jelly rolls, but muscular. Jen estimated that she would be a few inches over six feet when standing upright. She was naked, and had both arms across her chest in an effort to hide her perky c-cups while her thighs were clamped tightly together to hide everything else. Her face was bright red and she tried desperately to not look at Jen. She looked very familiar.<br />
<br />
Nurse Opal lightly smacked the girl on the thigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, now. Open up!&quot; She chided. &quot;We need to finish your exam so we can get you groomed.&quot;<br />
<br />
The blonde girl glanced quickly down at Jen before going back to staring fixedly ahead.<br />
<br />
Opal looked down at Jen as well. Then she sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen is a dog, just like you will be for the next month at minimum. Your shyness was cute at first, but now we need to get serious. No one is going to care that you are naked. No one will be making any comments, trainers or students, or they will be punished. Now, are you going to cooperate, or does Betty have to demonstrate the new shock collar?&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl&#39;s eyes darted towards Betty, then back forward again. Jen glanced at Betty as well. The Physicians Assistant was sitting at her desk and casually twirling a thick black leather collar on the end of one of her fingers. She looked back at the blonde girl to see her rapidly shaking her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you are going to cooperate?&quot; Opal asked pointedly.<br />
<br />
The blonde hesitantly let her arms drop slowly to her sides and the muscles in her thighs relaxed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot; Opal said. &quot;Now, lie back.&quot;<br />
<br />
The nurse firmly pushed the blonde teen&#39;s shoulders until she was laying lengthwise on the table. As she resumed her examination, Jen turned and made her way over to Betty, who reached out and scratched her head lovingly. Jen looked at the collar, which Betty had placed in her lap, and saw the name Missie carved into the metal tag dangling from it.<br />
<br />
&quot;You like it?&quot; Betty asked, holding it up again. &quot;It&#39;s the latest model. Thinner, lighter, and I added more contact points so they can&#39;t just hold it away from their skin to escape punishment. Not that I need to worry about any of that with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Her name&#39;s Missie?&quot; Jen asked, turning to look back at the girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Melissa, actually.&quot; Betty replied. &quot;But we&#39;re encouraging the use of nicknames and pet names when their parents sign them up. It will help them to separate their human self from their dog self while they&#39;re here with us. Missie is actually here voluntarily&quot;<br />
<br />
The name Melissa floated around in Jen&#39;s head for a moment. She watched as Opal helped the muscular blonde onto all fours. Missie&#39;s blue eyes met Jen&#39;s for a moment, and it finally clicked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Melissa Bankman.&quot; Jen said, a little too loudly.<br />
<br />
Missie&#39;s eyes closed and the blush, which had faded a bit, came back full force.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, do you two know each other?&quot; Nurse Opal asked casually.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really,&quot; Jen said, &quot;We&#39;ve only seen each other once or twice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Memory came flooding back of the track meet earlier that year. The cheerleaders hadn&#39;t been a part of it, but their outdoor practice space was next to the field and they had stopped to watch during their breaks. Melissa was from a rival school and had been competing in the shot put and hammer throw, almost breaking a state record in the latter. Jen remembered how her and the other cheerleaders had made snide comments about how the blonde athlete&#39;s muscles made her look like a man and wondered how she hid a penis in her tight track shorts. Like many things in her recently former life, Jen now regretted that.<br />
<br />
&quot;She goes to a nearby school.&quot; Jen said, opting to omit more than a few things. &quot;I saw her hammer throw. She&#39;s really good at it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Missie&#39;s blush deepened a bit, but a smile tweaked the corners of her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright.&quot; Nurse Opal said. &quot;You&#39;re all clear. Climb down and come over here so we can give you a grooming before we fit you for your pads.&quot;<br />
<br />
Missie climbed awkwardly down from the table and followed the nurse to the steel tub. This allowed Jen to get a good look at her. She really was tall, and her height made her large muscles look more lean rather than bulky. Her shoulders were a little on the broad side, but her hips were wide enough to counter that. Though her legs were cleanly shaven, or perhaps just so blonde and fine it didn&#39;t matter, she had a thick blonde thatch of pubes that concealed her slit. Opal helped her into the tub and began scrubbing her down.<br />
<br />
While Opal dealt with Missie&#39;s grooming, Betty wiped down the steel top of the exam table and gestured for Jen to climb up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s take care of your exam while the table is unoccupied.&quot; Betty said. &quot;Once we&#39;re done I can give you a quick grooming while Nurse Opal gets Missie fitted.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen climbed up onto the table and the physician&#39;s assistant helped her remove her own pads and collar before beginning her exam. Betty worked quickly and thoroughly, though Jen couldn&#39;t help but notice how the woman&#39;s hands almost never seemed to leave her skin. She massaged and caressed her way up and down Jen&#39;s body, lingering over the girl&#39;s most sensitive areas. When it came time to check her temperature Betty didn&#39;t pull out the thin thermometer she had used last time, or the slightly larger but still reasonable one Opal had just used on Missie, but a much larger one with a thick, tapered bulb on the end. Jen eyed it warily.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Betty asked with obvious feigned innocence, then looked dramatically at the thermometer in her hands. &quot;Oh! Don&#39;t worry about this. The other thermometer was a veterinary one and wasn&#39;t ideal for using on humans. This one was specially made and is more accurate than even the best digital thermometers on the market.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen gave that obvious lie the most sarcastically flat expression she could muster.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t give me that look. You&#39;ll enjoy this. Trust me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen rolled her eyes, but allowed Betty to insert the thermometer. It was a tight fit, but Betty worked it in slowly and carefully while Jen whined and tried to relax. When the bulb finally passed her sphincter, Jen let out an involuntary gasp, but managed to hold back the moan. Barely. Betty seemed to notice anyway. She leaned in towards Jen&#39;s ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enjoying yourself?&quot; She murmured, giving the thermometer a quick tweak.<br />
<br />
This time Jen couldn&#39;t hold the moan in, but she quickly turned it into a rather pitiful whimper. Betty continued to play with the invading instrument. She gave it several quick twists and small tugs, each one causing Jen to whimper again and again. Then she suddenly stopped. Jen looked carefully over her shoulder to see Betty squinting at the thermometer and writing on her clipboard. She caught Jen looking, and winked at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Temperature&#39;s a little bit high.&quot; Betty said cheekily. &quot;But I guess we can write that off as outside interference.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen started to growl, but Betty gave the thermometer a sharp tug and turned it into the most animalistic moan she had ever uttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahem.&quot;<br />
<br />
Startled, Jen looked up to see that Opal had finished with Missie&#39;s grooming and was waiting patiently. Missie was standing meekly next to her, trying her best to look small. Even with standing next to the imposing nurse, this wasn&#39;t an easy feat. Jen stared at the other girl. Her long blonde hair, which she had kept in a perpetually tangled ponytail, had been cut boyishly short like Jen&#39;s. The look suited her. Jen&#39;s gaze traveled down to Missie&#39;s crotch. The thick and unruly patch of white-blonde pubes had been tamed by the clippers and Jen could now see that the other girl had a rather sizable clit. It stuck out rather prominently without all the hair hiding it. Jen realized she was staring and tore her eyes away and up to Missie&#39;s face. She was staring fixedly at Jen. Their eyes met, and Missie&#39;s face went red again.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you are done with Jen&#39;s exam.&quot; Opal said. &quot;The bath is open and I would like to use the table to fit Missie&#39;s pads.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course!&quot; Betty said brightly.<br />
<br />
Before Jen could brace herself, Betty tugged the thermometer a bit more firmly and it popped free. Jen made another animal moan as it did so and her arms finally gave out. She lay on the polished steel with her ass in the air, panting, as Betty cleaned off the oversize instrument and tucked it into a drawer. When she had caught her breath, Betty helped her down to the floor and lead her to the bath.<br />
<br />
Jen was now seriously turned on. As she crawled towards the steel tub she could feel her juices running down her inner thighs. Betty noticed her discomfort, but if Jen wanted sympathy she would have to look elsewhere. After the teen had clambered into the bath, Betty deliberately ran her fingers up the girl&#39;s leg and held them up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, well, well.&quot; the older woman teased quietly. &quot;It looks like you&#39;re dirtier than I thought. I&#39;ll have to make sure to get you extra clean.&quot;<br />
<br />
The bath was pure torture for Jen, but mercifully quick. Betty seemed to focus most of her attention on her breasts and slit, but never enough for Jen to cum. By the time Betty pulled out the clippers to trim up her hair, Jen was a quivering, whimpering mess. Betty had to give her a quick slap on the rump to stop her from trying to grind her hips against the buzzing shears.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll get hurt if you keep doing that.&quot; Betty admonished. &quot;Try and have a little self control, would you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen growled weakly, and got another slap on the rear for her trouble. Once she was clean, Betty toweled her down. She had to make several passes on her thighs, since Jen was still dripping. The Betty helped her put her kneepads, gloves, and collar back on before leading her back over to where Opal and Missie were waiting.<br />
<br />
&quot;There you are, Missie.&quot; Betty said, ruffling Missie&#39;s newly cropped hair. &quot;Cute as a button.&quot;<br />
<br />
Missie blushed again. The compliment seemed to please her. She smiled shyly up at Betty from her new position on the floor.<br />
<br />
Opal, meanwhile, took one look at Jen, then raised an eyebrow at Betty who winked conspiratorially. Both girls missed this. Jen because she was lost in a sexual haze, and Missie because she was too busy staring at Jen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright!&quot; Betty said brightly, clipping Jen&#39;s leash to her collar. &quot;Let&#39;s get a move on!&quot;</p>
