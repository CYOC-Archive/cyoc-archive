<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a calm quiet day, and Zack was sitting at home, working out in his personal home gym. Now by the looks of it, anyone would think this guy had it all. He was good looking, and very muscular. Only 25, had his own house, and always had the newest and best of everything. He had three cars, and his house was two stories with 3 bedrooms, and a basement. He had to have room if he wanted to start a family sometime. There was only one problem. He was in debt. And not like one credit card with an outstanding balance. He had three credit cards, as well as two car loans on the go, and his house to pay for. To top it all off, he had just lost his job since he had trouble getting to work on time.<br />
<br />
Zack was 6'5&quot; tall, and weighed about 250 lbs of muscle. He was blue eyed with blond, stick-straight hair. His shoe size was about a 15. Finally, he had a huge package to go with it all, about 12 inches. He dressed well, in brand name clothing. He liked keeping his hair about a short-medium length. He was quite a hairy individual as well, and kept a goatee on his face. His face was rugged and angular, and when he smiled he had quite the dimples on him.<br />
<br />
His house included two and a half bathrooms, a pool in the backyard, spacious kitchen and living room. The three bedrooms were quite large also, and he of course had a garage to house the two cars he wasn't driving at the moment.<br />
<br />
His debt had gotten so far that he had called a company that helps people get rid of their debt in hopes that they could help him. He asked all the questions he could on the phone, and they wanted to meet him, so here he was, working out, while he waited for them to show up. Finally, there was a knock at the door. He went to his door and opened it still in his workout clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi there Zack!&quot; a scrawny little man with glasses said as he opened the door. &quot;You called about wanting us to help you with your debt?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Zack replied. &quot;Come on in, sorry, I was just finishing a workout when you knocked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh that's no trouble at all,&quot; the scrawny man smiled. &quot;I'm Dave, and I'll be helping you pick the plan that's best for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Awesome,&quot; Zack said as Dave stepped in his house.<br />
<br />
They went to sit down in his living room. This man was really short compared to Zack. He was about 5'5&quot;, and looked to be about 100 lbs, if that. He was quite a bit older than Zack, looking to be about 35 years old. He had this nerdy appeal to him, and seemed a little effeminate.<br />
<br />
Dave went over the plans with him. They included:<br />
&quot;The Credit Card Package- Just for people with high credit card debts.&quot;<br />
&quot;Bank Loan Package- For people owing high amounts to their bank.&quot;<br />
&quot;Mortgage Package- Having trouble making your mortgage payments on time?&quot;<br />
&quot;Car Package- Make the payments of your car or cars fast!&quot;<br />
&quot;All Inclusive Package- Combines all these packages for one low price!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which one do you think would be best for you?&quot; Dave asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm thinking I'm going to need the All Inclusive Package!&quot; Zack answered.<br />
<br />
Dave explained that package in more detail. Zack wasn't really listening as he didn't really care about the terms and conditions. He just wanted to continue living this lifestyle, but cheaper. He only cared about the price of the package.<br />
<br />
&quot;...this package is about $30 a month, with the information you have given us,&quot; Dave continued on.<br />
<br />
Zack waited until Dave was finished speaking, and told him he would like to go with that package. He couldn't go wrong right? Dave handed him a terms and conditions contract. It had all the things Dave told him on it, but he never bothered to read contracts. Dave gave him his copy after he signed, and they were finished. Dave then went on his way. He would go out looking for work tomorrow with that stress taken off him. He took the contract and set it on his desk with all his other papers, and went back to his workout. He slept easier that night knowing his debt problem was over; or so he thought.<br />
<br />
When he failed to pay attention to Dave go over the contract, he missed some vital information. &quot;This package will take care of all your debt for you for the price discussed. If you fail to make one payment; just one, there will be consequences. We will take one of your attributes from you as that payment. If you fail to make a second payment in a row, we will take two more attributes from you as the penalty, and etc. We may also take attributes with your payment if we feel that it is not a big enough payment. You can not quit our service until you have paid us for one full year, after that you are free to quit, with the payment of your best attribute of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack slept the night away, happy that he could continue his lifestyle. He awoke in the morning, ready to take on his job search!<br />
