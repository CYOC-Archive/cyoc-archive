<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Troy was staring at the white stripes running down her tail when she felt the weight in her pelvis grow more intense.  The baby was growing inside of her and she could feel every last ounce that was added pressing down into her cervix.  But despite the increase in weight, the hand that she had pressed against her belly button told her that her stomach wasn’t getting any bigger.  Instead, the baby was growing by absorbing the amniotic fluid in her womb, removing the cushion that had previously kept most of its body suspended inside of her.<br />
<br />
As the baby shifted down, no longer supported by any liquid, Troy felt something hard and coarse press into her uterine walls.  As the baby began squirming, its new, rough hide began to grate against Troy’s insides like sandpaper.<br />
<br />
Troy let out a painful yelp, “the baby had felt so soft before, why is it so hard now?  Is it covered in… scales?” she thought to herself.<br />
<br />
Troy didn’t have time to go any further with that thought before a series of pinching sensations began to run down her chest while invisible hands pulled 4 new nipples out through her fur with mammary tissue rapidly swelling up behind them.<br />
<br />
Her new breasts grew until they were the same size as her old ones.  The growth paused ever so briefly before the returning and all 6 breasts began rapidly swelling up.  At first gravity pulled the lower pair down, causing them to rest atop her bloated stomach, but soon they had grown to the point that there was just no more room.  As her breasts continued to swell, her lower breasts began pushing up on her middle breasts, which themselves were forced upwards to her mid chest.  Her middle breasts then forced her upper breasts towards her neck.  They kept swelling and swelling and swelling until she felt her chin being pressed up – her two upper breasts pressing into it like giants, milk filled pillows.<br />
<br />
Despite all the new weight that had been added to her body, her legs hadn’t grown any new muscle mass to compensate, and Troy soon felt them begin to wobble as they struggled to support her new additions.  It only took a few more seconds before her legs completely gave out, causing Troy to crash down unceremoniously on her ass while the Book of Beasts fell out from under her arm and bounced onto the grass next to her.  <br />
<br />
She tried to stand up but found herself unable to do so.  It wasn’t that her body couldn’t adopt a standing posture – nothing about her skeletal structure had changed – her legs just weren’t strong enough to support her weight anymore.<br />
<br />
As she sat on her ass, Troy felt two more pinching sensations come from the space between her pussy and stomach.  Soon, two new breasts began growing out of her crotch, pressing painfully into her thighs as they did so.  Troy was forced to spread her legs as wide as she could and, while that allowed her crotch breasts to slip down in between them, there still wasn’t enough room.  <br />
<br />
At first they pushed up on her belly, pressing her tender insides even harder against her baby’s new scales, causing them to cut slightly deeper into her than they already were.  But soon there was just no more room for her crotch breasts to press upwards as they continued to inflate, so they began pressing painfully into the ground.  As they continued to grow, Troy felt herself being pushed slightly off the ground, her crotch breasts now serving as unpleasant cushions that she was forced to sit on.<br />
<br />
Next, milk production in her breasts went into overdrive.  As with her scent glands, there was an initial feeling of intense internal pressure on the back of her nipples and skin.  And while it didn’t relieve any of the pressure, Troy felt a slight pinch inside of each nipple, followed by dampness as her breasts could no longer contain the amount of milk they were producing and began leaking out the excess.<br />
<br />
An overwhelming sensation of needing to be milked filled Troy’s mind – a sensation that she tried to relieve as she brought her hands to the nipples on her middle breasts in a vain attempt to milk herself.  <br />
<br />
Unfortunately for Troy, she felt her hands growing broader while thick, leathery pads took shape on her palms and the bottoms of her fingers.  While her hands maintained an overall human shape, the joints on her fingers disappeared, leaving her with fat, stubby digits that had a very limited range of motion at the knuckle – the best she could do was slightly wiggle her new chubby fingers, rendering her hands little more than useless, ornamental paws.<br />
<br />
As her body was rapidly turning itself into a stinky, filthy, milky prison, Troy’s mouth began to fill with saliva.  She tried swallowing it, but no matter how much she swallowed more took its place.  Eventually, she realized the futility of what she was doing and let her mouth hang slightly ajar.<br />
<br />
With drool running down her chin and dripping onto her breasts, Troy began to realize the desperateness of her situation.  She was turning into some kind of skunk monster!  Was this the Book of Body?  The body parts seemed right but not the species change.  Book of Transmutation?  God, she hoped not – she hadn’t been turned into a sex doll yet but that didn’t mean she wasn’t about to.  That latter thought impressed just how little time she had.  She had to do something to stop this.  She had to do something to stop RK.  She had to do something NOW.<br />
<br />
The Book of Beast!  She could see it sitting on grass next to the walkway, just a few feet away from her!  But how to get to it?  She couldn’t stand or walk… so she did the best thing she could do and let her body roll forward onto her breasts and belly.  The weight of her body squished her already overfilled breasts against the ground, causing them to feel like they were going to burst, but Troy didn’t have a choice – she had to touch the book before it was too late!<br />
<br />
Troy watched as a fat, filthy, useless paw slowly stretched towards the book.  As she reached out, she felt the teeth in her mouth begin to recede into her gums.  At the same time, her gums broadened and extended themselves, forming two soft plates of flesh in place of her old teeth.  <br />
<br />
Her paw got closer, and closer, and closer.  She was still animate.  She still had time.  The muddy black fur from her middle finger brushed up against thick cardstock.  Just a little more!  With one last stretch Troy felt her paw pad press down into the book’s hard cover.  She made it!<br />
<br />
Troy realized she only had time for a single spell so she had to make this count.  There was only one spell that would both disable RK and fix her – Mass Transform.  The first animal that came to her mind was the one that most embodied her current predicament, a skunk.  That was fine, skunks were small and mostly helpless, which was all she needed right now.  She pictured her entire neighborhood – she had to go for overkill to ensure she got RK, whatever damage that caused she could fix later.  With that, her preparations were complete and she began to mouth the words:<br />
<br />
“Raaaas ransfomasson” <br />
<br />
Troy looked down at the Book of Beasts.  It was covered in drool that had sprayed out of her mouth when she had attempted to cast the spell.  But other than soaking the book with her saliva, nothing had happened.</p>
