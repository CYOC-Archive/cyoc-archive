<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">During the night Jeff&#39;s changes continued to slowly progress, the turquoise slowly edging up his torso very slowly as, now without a definite shape to hold him up, his dress half fell flat rather then stay bloated with the addition of his hole.<br />
During the night Jeff decided to stick one of his hands in his hole, watching as he moved his dress half from the inside with his hand as he tapped the top of his body cavity to pinpoint where it currently was, only about a millimeter from the bottom of his lungs. A brief moment of thought had him wonder if he could touch his lungs before they dissapeared, and he resolved to try and do so during the night as the turquoise progressed and he became more fabricy, his body cavity slowly moving towards his lungs.<br />
About halfway through the night Jeff stuck his hands back into his hole and felt around the top of his body cavity, only to gasp as he felt two bumps near the top of his cavity that his brain identified as his lungs. Slowly but surely his body cavity expanded, exposing the bottom of his lungs as Jeff touched them, only to feel the bottoms of his lungs start to shrink as they sunk slowly back into his fabric form. &#39;At least my lungs are going to take a while to go completely, I guess I won&#39;t be alive once they are gone.&#39; Jeff thought as he sighed and waited, keeping his hands in his body cavity for some strange comfort.<br />
By the time the sun peeked back into the closet Jeff got a good look at how far his changes had progressed again, by now he was a dress about halfway down his torso, with nearly a third of his lungs miss gone for good as the closet door opened and Alice looked in.<br />
&quot;What are you doing on the floor dress? Where is your hanger?&quot; Alice wondered aloud as she rummaged through the clothes in her closet. &quot;Great, now I need to by you a new hanger.&quot; Alice complained as she picked up Jeff with ease before setting him on the bed. &quot;You stay there, when I come back from school I&#39;ll get a hanger for you.&quot; Alice said as she started to get dressed.<br />
&#39;By the time you get back from school I probobly won&#39;t have lungs,&#39; Jeff complained in his head as the turquoise slowly etched it&#39;s way up his chest, at this rate he was going to be a full dress by tomorrow night.<br />
And then it hit him, he had set the transformation to take a week, but that didn&#39;t account for weekends, meaning he was changing into a dress in five days rather then seven. Sighing he wished he had had more time to change, but it had been rather enjoyable to experience the change as well.<br />
When Alice left she didn&#39;t even say goodbye to him, showing that she was starting to regard him as less and less sentient as Jeff lay on the bed, his dres half laying on the bed flat as his remain torso contiued to gain a tulle fabric turquoise color.<br />
A few minutes after Alice left Jeff started to feel a tingle in his hands, blinking Jeff held them up to his face as he noticed what as starting to happen to them. His fingers were starting to distort and he was starting to lose the feeling in his arms. Deciding to enjoy his hands while he hand them he shoved them into his body cavity as went for the top of it, trying to find the lumps that were is transforming lungs.<br />
It didn&#39;t take long to find them as Jeff started to tickle them, shivering in pleasure at he didn&#39;t something no one else had done before, fondle their own lungs. And as he was doing so the blue contiuned to sprees up his body as he became more and more dress.<br />
Hours passed and his arms contiuned to shrink, he had settled with placing his hands and his chest to watch them change as the turquoise slowly kept removing bits of his lungs. At some point during the ordeal he suddenly stopped breathing Jeff quickly moving his shrunken and distorted hands through his hole to try and feel his body cavity. As soon as he touched the top he realized what had happened, more then half his lungs had been taken, and the rest had gone with them, leaving him unable to breath as Jeff pulled his hands out of his body and put them back on his chest, which was turquoise and turning to fabric just about two inches from his nipples.<br />
It was official, he no longer counted as a sentient being, now he was just a piece of clothing on it&#39;s way to being a finished product. And yet Jeff anticipated it. He wanted to be worn, to be on Alice&#39;s body as her dress. While only part of his dress body was adjusted to her body shape, Jeff knew that would change after she put him on when he was completely a dress.<br />
More time passed as Jeff watched his hands, which were little more then nubs by now as a small hole had opened him at the second joint of his fingers, the feeling in them completely lost as they turned slowly to white, the turquoise just a mere millimeter away from Jeff&#39;s nipples.<br />
It was then that Alice returned, carrying a clothes hanger as she opened her closet before picking up Jeff and trying to snap his still human shoulders onto the hanger clip. It took some effort on her part but she succeded, Jeff now hanging by his shoulders on a hanger as she put him in the closest, his body waving in the air beneath him as Jeff contiuned to change. By the time Alice went to bed his nipples had been taken over by the fabric entirely, and his arms were nearly changed, a pair of holes in his arms soon to be the gloves for his dress body as his nipples dissapered entirely, leaving Jeff just a few final changes that would occur tomorrow. He would be a complete dress by the afternoon.</p>
