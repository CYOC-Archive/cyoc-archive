<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amber rummaged in a cabinet for a moment, then headed for the door, beckoning for the other two to follow. She lead them down the hall and around the corner before opening another door and leading them inside. This room was somewhat small and furnished with comfortable couches and chairs. A long table stood to one side and one wall was nothing but tall cabinets.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is the kitchen staff break room.&quot; Amber said, tossing the item she had brought from the kitchen onto a sofa. &quot;We should have some privacy here for a while, but just in case.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amber pulled some paper, markers, and tape from a cabinet and made a &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign which she hung on the door before locking it.<br />
<br />
&quot;There. That should keep everyone out until we&#39;re done.&quot;<br />
<br />
The young chef kicked off her shoes and tossed her hat onto the table. Her dirty-blonde hair was tied up in a tight bun. She untied her apron and threw it next to the hat. Then she undid her coat and hung it on a peg next to the door. Under it she wore a simple white tank-top. It was somewhat sweat-soaked and revealed that she wore no bra. She laced her fingers and stretched her arms high above her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh!&quot; She sighed. &quot;That&#39;s better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what&#39;s this treat you have in mind?&quot; Betty asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing too complex,&quot; Amber replied, &quot;Just thi-&quot;<br />
<br />
They were interrupted by a loud, urgent knocking at the door. Amber scowled at the noise.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; she half snarled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um... Is Ms. Betty in there?&quot; came a timid voice from the other side. &quot;Nurse Opal needs her help. The first group of the new students have arrived and she says it will take more than one person to process them all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No rest for the wicked.&quot; Betty sighed. &quot;Can I leave Jen with you Amber? When you&#39;re done here just take her out to the side yard and play fetch with her for a bit. If I&#39;m not done by dinner time then you can take her back to her kennel and leave her with either Alice or whoever is assigned to night duty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean I get a break from the kitchen for a change? I&#39;ll be glad to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Betty smiled, then patted Jen on the head and left the room. Amber locked the door behind her and turned back to Jen with a grin on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;That makes things a bit easier.&quot; She said. &quot;I didn&#39;t really want an audience for this and was trying to figure out how to get rid of her. Hooray for happy coincidence.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, she reached down and undid the her belt and let her slacks fall to her ankles. She stepped out of them and walked over to Jen in just her underwear. Jen stared at her panties. They were simple briefs made of thick white cotton. Jen had expected her to be wearing a thong or something with lace. Amber saw her staring and looked down.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; she asked. &quot;You got a problem? I cant stand the feel of silk and lace. I find these to be functional and comfortable, and that&#39;s all that matters.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amber grabbed the thing she had brought from the kitchen off the table and sat down on a sofa. She pulled her panties off, tossed them to the side, and spread her legs. Jen could see from the small tuft of hair that had been left unshaven above her slit that Amber was a natural blonde.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y&#39;know Jen, I&#39;ve always wanted to try something like this, but doing it with an actual dog just seemed so repulsive.&quot;<br />
<br />
She held up what she had brought with her. It was a small jar of peanut butter. Jen looked at it with confusion for a brief moment. Then it dawned on her. She had heard of this. Some people would put peanut butter on their bits so that the dog would lick it off and pleasure them in the process. She shuddered at the thought, agreeing with Amber that it was disgusting. But Amber did make an excellent point. Jen wasn&#39;t really a dog, even if she was now able to pretend to be one whenever she wanted. She was still human. That made this okay.<br />
<br />
Amber unscrewed the lid of the jar and scooped out a generous dollop of peanut butter with her fingers. She reached down and smeared it all over her crotch, working it between her lips and up around her clit. For a moment Jen thought that Amber might have forgotten about her as her fingers worked their way around and her breathing became noticeably heavier. She began to worry that Amber may have forgotten about her. Without thinking, she let out a short bark. Amber jumped and looked around guiltily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, sorry.&quot; she said quickly. &quot;Got a little too carried away there.&quot;<br />
<br />
She slid to the edge of her seat and spread her legs a bit wider. With a grin, she beckoned Jen forward with a finger still smeared with peanut butter and her own juices.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen, come!&quot;<br />
<br />
If you had asked Jen two months ago, before Kyle and the curse, if she was into girls, she would have said no. She would have probably been insulted that you would even ask. The curse, her time at Chesterton, Mina and Betty, and now Amber. All of this had caused her to completely rethink her entire view on life. She had gone from the uptight and slightly repressed head cheerleader to a naked dog-girl willing to eat out an attractive woman. And she had to admit that she felt better than she ever had in her entire life.<br />
<br />
She trotted forward and began cleaning the peanut butter of of Amber with enthusiasm. She employed every trick that Betty had taught her earlier and was rewarded with loud moans from the blonde girl. She dug her tongue in deep to get more of Amber&#39;s salty juices that paired well with the sweet peanut flavor. Amber&#39;s moans became somewhat muffled. Jen glanced upwards to see Amber sucking her fingers, cleaning off the peanut butter and juices that coated them. Jen switched tactics and began attacking the woman&#39;s clit causing her to squeal in orgasm.<br />
<br />
It took nearly half an hour for Jen to lick off all of the thick spread. During this Amber came twice more. She was slumped on the sofa, sweat making her tank-top semi-transparent. She looked dreamily down and Jen and let out a tired little laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your tongue&#39;s hanging out.&quot; she giggled. &quot;Makes you look even more like a dog.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen&#39;s mouth had been overworked. She couldn&#39;t close it even if she wanted to. Her tongue just hung limply over her lower lip and she could feel a line of drool crawling down her chin. She panted just like a dog. She couldn&#39;t help it.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re really cute, you know that?&quot; Amber sighed. I don&#39;t think Betty will be coming back any time soon, judging from the the size of the dinner order we received this morning for our new students. Give me a minute to catch my breath and we&#39;ll go play in the yard for a while before dinner.&quot;</p>
