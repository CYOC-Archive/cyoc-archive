<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once Debbi got home, she realized that she should probably check to see if the website could work on her personal computer and not just on her work computer. Accessing the site through her email, it looked like everything should work. However, Debbi decided to do a test change just to make sure. At first, she was planning to do a minor change to herself, but then she recalled Sean, the new security guard. <br />
<br />
Sean was one the men Debbi and Gina considered changing using the website but ended up decided against it. It was probably because both of them thought of him as a kid, which was ironic considering she changed Brian and herself to become 18-years-old. Although once, she pulled his profile up, she found out he was actually 24-years-old.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow! I am not good with guessing ages,&quot; she remarked, considering she also got Brian&#39;s age wrong. She thought Sean was the age she was now. With his baby face and thin, reedy body, Sean certainly looked younger than his actual age. That was something Debbi thought should change.<br />
<br />
Quickly, the young woman typed up all the changes she wanted to make to the security guard. While she didn&#39;t want to necessarily make him older, she did want to make him look more mature, more macho, more his actual age. For added fun, Debbi decided to make him aware of the changes considering this was just a test and not making him anyone&#39;s boyfriend, like last time.<br />
<br />
Once she was satisfied with the changes she inputted, she hit the execute button, egger to see the changes first-hand tomorrow. However, Debbi didn&#39;t realize that she accidentally sent a link to the website to Sean because she activated awareness and didn&#39;t check a certain box.<br />
<br />
----------------------------<br />
<br />
Back in the office, Sean was sitting in the security office, board out of his mind watching the security cameras.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, nothing ever happens here,&quot; Sean complained. This wasn&#39;t the job he wanted in life. It was just a temp job to pay the bills until he gets a better-paying one, so what was he expecting when he took this job?<br />
<br />
&quot;What I&#39;d give to have something interesting to happen,&quot; as Sean wished that he suddenly felt a dizzy spell hit him. Thinking that this had happened because staring at the monitors too long, Sean got up to take a break. That was when he noticed that all his clothes disappeared.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-What! What the fuck is going onnnnnnn-ugh,&quot; Sean moaned and threw his head back as he felt the pleasurable part of transformation hit him. Muscles all over him started to explode with size and strength. Shoulders broaden to make room for muscular traps, that led to an ever-widening neck. Arms growing biceps and triceps that made Sean look like he lived at the gym.<br />
<br />
The panicking man tried to look down at his body to see the changes happening, only to be blocked by the massive pecs he now possed. He then groaned as abs were chiseling themselves out of his formerly flat stomach, and almost fell over when his leg became pillars of strength, stretching him to a very tall 6&#39;4.<br />
<br />
That was it for the physique changes, but Sean still had some changes that Debbi made go though before this ordeal was complete. The bones in his face were the first to change as they began restructuring to make Sean have less of a babyface and more of a movie star face.  The security guard clutched at his nose, almost like he was just punched in the face, as it changed to perfect his more mature face structure.<br />
<br />
Next, hairs began to spring up onto his chin and slowly grew denser until it had become a blonde goatee. A sprinkling of blond hairs also began to cover his chest and forearms, giving him a macho look that he lacked before.<br />
<br />
Finally, his average sized dick started to grow and lengthen until it was 8 inches soft and a thick as an energy drink can. Now no one would mistake him for a kid anymore! And as quickly as it started, the changes ended with a new security uniform clothing him as nothing had happened. The uniform may have been larger than the last one, but it still did little to hide the changes that had occurred.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha? What the fuck happened to me!&quot; The new larger man screamed in a deeper voice. People didn&#39;t just randomly transform like this... did they? While still in denial, Sean approached the mirror and unbuttoned his uniform, hoping that he just imagined all of that out of boredom.  However, seeing his new buffed out torso put a stop to that idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;This can&#39;t be real! This has to be an illusion or something.&quot; Sean touched his barreled chest, expecting his hand to phase through it, but instead felt hard muscle and the brisling of his new chest hair. That hand traveled south, feeling the ridges of abs he only dreamt of having before. He was slowly starting to accept this change, but not before getting interrupted by someone coming into the security room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, have you seen- Oh! I&#39;m so sorry!&quot; It was Richard, one of the few men that worked in the building and another victim of Debra&#39;s changes. Embarrassed over walking in on what looked like a handsome man changing clothes, Richard looked away. Although he also took some peaks when he thought the security guard wasn&#39;t looking.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, it&#39;s my fault. I should have closed the door.&quot; Sean was quickly trying to button up his shirt. He was trying desperately not to look stupid in front of Richard, not realizing he was eye candy to the other man. &quot;S-so, what did you need again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, right. I seem to have misplaced my car keys. It wouldn&#39;t happen to be in lost and found?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Keys? Oh yeah, I think there are some here.&quot; The security guard went to the lost-and-found-box and showed the keys to Richard. &quot;This yours?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it is, thank you so much.&quot; Richard took the keys and then gave Sean a look that screamed, I want you. &quot;Say, as a reward for helping me. Why don&#39;t I take you out for dinner this weekend? Sounds fun to you?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Was Richard really asking him out, Sean thought. While he didn&#39;t work here for long, Richard was the person that always caught his eye, even with all the girls working here. In fact, his newcomer status made him unaware that Richard was gay at all. At least that was the case after Debbra changed reality. It was then Sean figured that it was no time to be shy, but to be seductive, which was rather easy since he was feeling damn sexy now. &quot;Sounds lovely, although it would be a shame if it was only a one-time thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, it would, wouldn&#39;t it? But let&#39;s not be too hasty now. Good things come to those who wait after all.&quot; Richard and Sean then exchanged numbers to plan out the details later. &quot;Well, thank you once again. I&#39;ll be seeing you this weekend.&quot; And with one last wink, Richard left the security office.<br />
<br />
The security guard was now happy beyond words. Not only did he get a buffed-up, macho bod, he also managed to score a date with one of the hottest guys he laid eyes on. Part of him still thought that he was dreaming, but if this was a dream, then he didn&#39;t want to wake up.<br />
<br />
It was then when Sean noticed a strange notification that had popped up on his phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Transformationet?&quot;</p>
