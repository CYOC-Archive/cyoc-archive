<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Minor violence</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The man who was armed screamed and cursed when he was informed that he and his party were stuck in this new world. He still refused to believe that the centaurs before him were once human and horse respectively. To calm the group down, Lightning suggested to take the children and give them a tour of the village. While the four adult scout masters initially balked at the ideal; seeing the kids who were at first scared then now showing curiosity at the half human creatures walking around with the lower half of a horse. They soon followed a few of the taurs leaving the four adults to talk with both Amanda and Chris.<br />
<br />
The man with the pistol was a sheriff’s deputy. His companion was a paramedic and they both volunteered as scout masters. They were with a larger group the other day, exploring the trails dotting around the Grand Canyon. This was a planned trip that was nearly cancelled due to budget reasons. They and the six boys under their charge were all from Vermont and this was their first excursion since the pandemic. The two den mothers for the group of girl scouts were from Oregon. They were camping up east of Mount Hood in the Badger Creek wilderness area. Both groups of adults after having their typical panic attack at being whisked to a new world, both described a portrait of a centaur set against the setting sun in their camp sites in what passed for a dining hall in their respective camp sites. What both agree on was that one moment they were eating breakfast and then a sudden whirlwind sound enveloped them and the found themselves being sucked into the painting and soon found themselves here.<br />
<br />
“Meanwhile,” the man who had medical training speaking up; “an Amber alert is being issued for the location of six missing boys along with two scout masters around the Grand Canyon. I imagine the same is taking place in Oregon for the Girl Scouts.”<br />
“Once you fully change,” Amanda placing a comforting hand on the man’s thigh as he shook his head; “people on earth will forget about you.”<br />
“Epona’s magic will see to that,” Chris nodding.<br />
<br />
“This is bullshit,” the lawman swearing as he stands up; “you will return us home now!”<br />
“It doesn’t work that way,” Aiko approaching the group. She was still human but had a noticeable mane running down her back along her spine. The new hair matching her existing black locks. “We have been here since yesterday and only a few of us still human or horse have yet to change.”<br />
“I thought you joined the others to help with the children,” Chris looking at his former team mate.<br />
“They are all in the church,” Aiko thumbing in the direction of the building; “I think the goddess is speaking to them. I didn&#39;t feel like breaking out in signing hymns or bowing in prayer, so I left.”<br />
“Oh hell no,” the irate lawman running to the building; “we are leaving. NOW!”<br />
<br />
Amanda and Chris sigh as they get up from sitting on their lower bellies and follow the man who was in a half run. It wasn’t difficult for the two as they effortlessly kept up on their four hooves. The other three adults and Aiko followed but were not moving as fast as the centaurs. Reaching the church they see the man already brandishing his weapon; a small snub nose revolver, it was a typical back up piece that most police officers use when off duty. He checks the cylinder to make sure it is loaded before busting into the church. Everyone who was in there, Centaur, and human turned to see him heading towards the altar.<br />
“Boys get your horses, we are leaving;” the man brandishing his weapon. Glaring at everyone and daring him to try and stop him.<br />
No one answered as they stood there unsure of what to do. Chris and Amanda who followed close behind but not silently as their hooves thundered on the ground from their purposeful pursuit. Both grab the man and restrain him before he did something he would regret.<br />
“Let go of me,” the man shouting as he struggled to break free. Chris and Amanda’s grips on him were too strong for him to break free as they also lifted him off the ground; wrenching the gun from his hand.<br />
“Epona brought you here,” Chris looking serious; “if anyone could send you back its her. But your actions right now show you are not in the right frame of mind to ask her. So calm down or we might have to bind you with rope.”<br />
<br />
“Fuck you and the feckless bitch you call a goddess,” the lawman spat. “Let me go or you will live to regret this.”<br />
The entire congregation gasped at the man’s blasphemous language, yet none could see that the stain glass image of Epona behind the altar depicted the goddess with a grim expression and storm cloud brewing behind her.<br />
“I can tolerate some foul language,” an ominous voice booming in the church; “but I will not tolerate being personally insulted. Let alone such language being spoken in front of children! When you all arrived, there was an imbalance in regards to males and females. I was only going to have three of the stallions turn into centaur mares to restore the balance between the genders. But your actions; breaking into a house of worship, with violence on your mind and venom on your lips has forced me to punish you for your transgressions. You will help restore balance by giving up your manhood! You will become a centaur mare deputy Jackson! And you will accept that this is your new life!”<br />
<br />
While Epona spoke, no one noticed the sky outside darkening and flashes of lighting snaked across the sky, followed by claps of thunder. Epona’s ire drowned all that out as everyone stood still to watch the man slowly wither as the goddess&#39;s voice raked across his soul.<br />
“Bind him,” Epona speaking in a more calm voice; “but make him comfortable. His change along with the remainder of your group Chris will happen tonight.”<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
“Will the children be made to swap genders,” one of the den mother’s ask as deputy Jackson is quickly tied up and placed in the barn, where all the horses currently are.<br />
“No,” Lightning answering as he approaches the women and the other adult man; “the goddess won’t do that. Plus they are already in puberty. Having them swap gender would only make them more miserable with their own developing bodies.”<br />
“So who else will swap,” the other den mother asking; “surely not one of us?”<br />
“There are more male horses than female horses,” Lightning answering; “Epona will decide which two will become mares to balance everything out.”<br />
“And the children?” One of the woman speaking as they start filing out of the church. A few riding the centaurs and laughing as they have a good time.<br />
“They will also change,” Lightning answering; “but I think Epona will want us all to adopt them as our own. As way of getting us use to being parents before our mate’s heat cycles begin.<br />
“At least they won’t be orphaned. The name is Sarah,” One of the Den mother’s holding out her hand; still having a hard time taking all this in.<br />
“I am Jessica,” the second speaking as Lightning accepts Sarah’s hand in greeting.<br />
“My name is Steve,” the remaining adult male getting up to follow the children; “I guess I’m going to be busy as a physician now that we are stuck here.&quot;<br />
“Thirty two extra mouths to feed,” Lighting thinking to himself as he follows the group to help get them settled. “This Haras is growing strong.”</p>
