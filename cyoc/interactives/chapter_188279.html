<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Serys stood up and started to make her way down the hill. As she did, she felt energy glide over her. Within seconds, all her wounds had been healed<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell&quot; Serys said out loud.<br />
<br />
Avytir&#39;s sword rose from the ground and moved towards her. Serys reached out and grabbed it. She felt a newfound sense of confidence; she had never been allowed to hold something this powerful before.  Suddenly, a black, swirling mass appeared in front of her. It twisted and formed it&#39;s way into a humanoid figure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Serys. I am Avytir, spirit of Blenshire. You have proven yourself worthy of the sword, and you have proven yourself worthy of being a champion.&quot;<br />
<br />
Serys was confused. &quot;Didn&#39;t I just defeat Avytir?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, what you faced was all of my greed, resentment, vengeance, sadism distilled into one entity. You are speaking to the whole of me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Serys, still extremely resentful. started ranting. &quot;You killed my best friend in front of me...why should I be your champion?&quot;<br />
<br />
Avytir moved closer to her. &quot;You dreamt of being a knight. It means glory, and victory, and conquest, but also, pain, and misery, and learning to accept loss. Vanity and cruelty are no qualities of a knight. I needed to see if you understood that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Walking on the ground next to her, Avytir opened his right hand out to her. &quot;You possess intelligence, mastery with a blade, cunning, and empathy. With the right form, you will become the greatest knight Fesgal has ever seen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean by the right form?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To prepare you for what is to come, you must inhabit a more physical form, one that will allow you to put all of your gifts to use.&quot;<br />
<br />
Serys finally figured it all out. How foolish was she to think that she could be a knight. A female knight, what nonsense! The apparition wanted her natural gifts in a male body. She would have to give up all that she was for this. Still, she was not unwilling. <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Serys said bitterly. &quot;Make me a brute of a man. If I am destined for this, do what you will.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No man has ever or will ever hold this sword.&quot; Avytir said.<br />
<br />
Serys had heard it say that before and was about to interject when it finally dawned on her.<br />
<br />
&quot;A woman...was always meant to hold this sword?&quot; Serys asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, my child.&quot; Avytir responded. &quot;I was a woman. I rose from the peasant class and protected my king with my life. I was as talented a swordsmith as anyone in Fesgal. The king allowed me to serve in his army. I was a hero in the battle of Grelar. Many in his circle did not find this arrangement amusing. One night, I was taken by the men in his circle to these woods, beaten, rocks tied to my ankles and thrown into the river to drown. As my revenge, I cursed this place and enticed vicious men to meet their makers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You...you were the one to send me the message to come here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. I also sent you the apparitions warning you not to come here&quot; Avytir said. &quot;Any smart knight will have doubts. Those that don&#39;t are fools&quot;<br />
<br />
Serys looked at the blade in her hand as Avytir walked over to her. &quot;You believe power and strength will take away from what you are. They will not. Femininity and power, kindness and strength, sexuality and physicality, they are all traits you will embody equally.&quot;<br />
<br />
Growing more confident in herself, Serys agreed to take on this new &quot;form&quot;. She was unsure of what was to come, but that didn&#39;t matter. Her life had a greater purpose and she was ready to fulfill it. Avytir told her she would have to first give up any claims to royalty and any lands or treasures that came with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I, Serys, daughter of Aarvin and Blythe, renounce any and all royal claims in this life&quot;<br />
&quot;Good. Now you must disavow yourself of any familial or personal ties.&quot;<br />
<br />
Serys was about to follow along when she realized she couldn&#39;t. Her father, her mother, her friends, Patwin, all of these people made her who she was.<br />
<br />
&quot;I cannot do that. I am not a sellsword or a mercenary; I fight for the honors and lives of those that I care for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fair enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
Avytir instructed Serys to hold the blade over head. &quot;Repeat these words after me. I am Serys, wielder of Avytir&#39;s sword, champion of Blenshire. I have the mind and heart of a champion, now I lay claim to the body of one. Set me free!&quot;<br />
<br />
With the blade raised, Serys started to recite the chant. &quot;I am Serys...wielder of Avytir&#39;s sword...champion of Blenshire.&quot; Gathering herself, Serys continued. &quot;I have the mind and heart of a champion, now I lay claim to the body of one.&quot; In as loud a voice as she could raise, she screamed &quot;SET ME FREE!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
The blade started to float in the air. Blue runes started to glow on the sword.  Serys reached out and grabbed it. Suddenly, those blue runes appeared on her skin. She dropped the blade.<br />
<br />
Serys had only a moment to look at her skin before a colossal lightning strike her. Her entire body started to glow white. At first, Serys felt incredible pain but it quickly moved to pleasure she had never felt in her entire life. Soft moans poured out of her mouth as she felt herself rising, growing taller and taller. Serys looked at her hands and feet and was amazed as they both doubled in size. Her arms and legs started to lengthen and take on mass, going from soft and slender to thick and muscular. Serys felt her hips jut outward and her ass begin to take on girth, eventually becoming thick but taut. Serys felt herself aroused as she saw her vaginal tissue grow larger and hairier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my goodness,&quot; Serys said in ecstasy as she could hear her formerly girlish voice get deeper and deeper.<br />
<br />
Serys felt her shoulders get broader and her stomach lengthen and widen, as she developed a six pack. Serys felt her breasts start to grow as they went from the B-cup she was familiar with to a heavier DD-cup. Serys face started to mature as all the baby fat disappeared. Her lips became thicker, her jaw and cheekbones became more pronounced, and her nose decreased in size ever so gradually. Her long, blonde hair kept it&#39;s length but straightened. <br />
<br />
In a matter of minutes, it was over. Serys almost stumbled, not used to the new body she was in. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let me see myself.&quot; she asked Avytir, stunned at how deep her new voice was.<br />
<br />
Avytir created a mirror for Serys to look into. What Serys saw stunned her.<br />
<br />
She had entered Blenshire a dainty teenager. She was leaving it a physically imposing woman. Serys looked over her newly musclebound body. She was stunned by how tall she was now. Before she was 5&#39;5; now she was pushing 6&#39;4. Serys had always been shorter than anyone she became acquainted with; that was no longer the case. She flexed her thick biceps. She had always seen the men around her do that, and never realized how confident it must have made them feel. She felt over her taut legs, amazed at how big they were now. Serys picked up her sword, and was amazed at how much easier it was to handle. <br />
<br />
Yet for her love of her powerful body, Serys was happy that she wasn&#39;t super masculine. With her feminine face, large breasts, curvy hips, and thick butt, she would never be mistaken for a girl nor would she be mistaken for a man.<br />
<br />
&quot;How old am I?&quot; Serys asked.<br />
&quot;30. Old enough to begin the rest of your life.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Serys started to walk down the hill, Avytir had one more thing in mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will escort you out of the woods, but perhaps you should have clothing more befitting of your new status.&quot;<br />
<br />
Serys suddenly felt metal cloaking itself around her. In seconds, she was equipped with a black suit of armor that perfectly fit her, including a horned helm to hide her identity. No one would be able to tell who she was while wearing this<br />
<br />
&quot;I dub thee, Serys, the Obsidian Knight.&quot;</p>
