<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan was scrolling through the options, his eyes scanning each and every thing he could change.  He was finding it hard to pick what he wanted to change first.  He was unhappy with so many things when it came to himself.  He was scrawny, only average looking at best, only his intelligence was something he could never think of changing.  So when his eyes fell on the RANDOM button he thought his problem answered.  He could just rely on the roll of the dice to determine what the changes would be.  He did it in role playing games all the time, and he figured it's be good enough for here as well.<br />
<br />
He set the program to revert changes after one hour without further input from the operator, just in case the program made it so he couldn't use it to turn himself back.  He had noticed the age option went all the way down to zero.  He didn't need to be stuck as a baby until he could grow up again.  He also chose the alter reality setting, just in case he did like what happened to him and wanted to keep it around for a while.  With his backup plan in place he took a deep breath and pressed the RANDOM button.  His cursor turned to an hourglass, beginning it relentless tumbling as he turned to look at himself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
He couldn't see any changes yet, the first one had happened so fast, and this one seemed to be taking its time.  Perhaps because more was going to happen.  He shifted uncomfortably in his chair, fingers plucking at his t-shirt that was clinging uncomfortably to his chest.  His eyes shot wide as he looked in the mirror more carefully.  It wasn't sticking, it was stretching.  His torso was expanding, his shoulders and chest pulling the fabric tight across his body.  There was a ragged ripping noise as the seams running up the side of the shirt gave way.  He grabbed the shirt and tugged it over his head, tossing the ruined garment aside.<br />
<br />
He gasped at his own reflection.  His flat chest had swollen with muscle, two firm pectoral muscles were jutting out.  He moved his hands aside, revealing his abs had followed suit, the tightly cobbled muscles shifting slightly under the skin as he moved.  He laughed happily, lifting his arms and flexing his biceps as he watched them swell with new muscle.  Quickly he jumped out of the chair and worked at the fly of his shorts, the waistband already digging painfully into his flesh.  He dropped the shorts just in time for his boxers to rip and give way, the scrap of fabric drifting to the floor.  His legs were becoming just as toned as his arms, corded muscle bunched up under his skin.  He was so giddy from the growth in his muscles he didn't notice his frame stretching out to match.  His body growing taller by inches in a burst until he stood a few inches over six feet.  His muscles continued to swell with power, veins snaking over them when he flexed.  Even his face looked more mature, his jaw squared, his brows heavier.  He no longer looked like a high schooler.  Now he could claim to be in his mid twenties and no one would bat an eye.  He felt a stirring between his legs, his cock which had remained relatively unchanged began to swell, though it wasn't the same swelling that was so familiar to him as a male.  It was growing right before his eyes, twice as thick as it used to be, and half again as long.  Eight inches of flaccid cock rested between his legs, his balls swelling to the size of a pair of golf balls, hanging low behind his shaft.  The skin around his shaft began to shift, creeping down the length of it until it came together at the very tip, his foreskin having grown back into place.<br />
<br />
Dark hair began to push its way out all over his body.  His arms, legs, chest and face.  The center of his chest darkened from the hair, the spread thinly over the rest of his pecs.  His jaw was lined in dark stubble that scratched as he ran his hands against it.  Even the hair on his head seemed to be darkening, turning a pitch black color.  Though instead of lengthening, it began to pull back into his scalp, until a bare stubble covered the top of his head.  His face was still changing as well, he leaned forward to get a closer look, watching as his brows thickened even more, his nose broadening to twice it's previous width.  His lips plumped up, full and thick, making him look permanently ready for kissing.<br />
<br />
He felt a sudden tingling start in his chest, and he reached up to grab the source of he odd feeling, his nipples held between his thick fingers.  They perked up, hard and sensitive as the skin began to darken, moving past brown almost to black.  The same tingling started in his groin, the low hanging sack holding his balls darkened to the same deep shade, the dark pigment moving along his shaft.  The tingling caused it to swell with the more familiar rush of blood, his cock going erect at its full eleven inches, which he wrapped his thick hands around.  He began to pump wildly at his ebon cock.  Spreading out from his cock and nipples his skin continued its slide towards mahogany, not darkening as much as the sensitive skin but still taking on a rich brown hue.  Where his skin darkened, his hair became coarse and curly, a dense bush around his cock and a curly smattering across his chest.  The dark pigment traveled down his arms and legs, over his hands and feet.  His palms and the soles of his feet darkened only slightly, retaining something of their lightness.  The darkening of his skin moved up his neck and over his face, his blue eyes shifting to a deep brown as the last of his pale skin was darkened to rich coffee.<br />
<br />
He let out a deep moan, a baritone rumbling in his chest as his balls pulled up towards his erect shaft.  The stiff rod gave a lurch in his hands and blasted the mirror with a gush of creamy white seed, followed by a second and a third.  Four more splashes of cum splattered against the mirror, leaving a milky mess criss-crossed over his own reflection.  He ran his hands over his new body, watching the twenty something, athletic black man in the mirror mimic his actions.  &quot;Damn I'm hot.&quot;  His voice came out deep and gravelly, a rich baritone.<br />
<br />
He turned to look at his computer.  An open window took up most of the screen, stating 'Time until reversion: 2:58'. He could have some fun with this body, and he was almost curious to see how the world reworked itself...</p>
