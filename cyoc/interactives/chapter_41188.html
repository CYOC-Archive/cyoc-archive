<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Drake made it back to his room at the fraternity he had joined. He shut the door and locked it. He gazed down at the lamp and wondered what he should do next. Numerous possibilities flitted through his mind. From turning his friend Rick into a girl to making Brian an ass. He made up his mind and rubbed the lamp with his shirt. Just as he was rubbing it his roommate Mike took it out of his hands. He hadn't known that he was there so focused on the lamp as he was. Now as the fog came rolling out he cursed himself because Beldazarr would think Mike had cleaned the lamp.<br />
<br />
As Beldazarr appeared Mike said &quot;Aw shit! Not you again!&quot;<br />
<br />
Beldazarr smiled and said &quot;Indeed it is me Mike. Or would you prefer Michelle?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's not my name now&quot; Mike said angrily. &quot;Well as long as I have you I wish that Drake is my girlfriend, has only known himself as a girl, and has no interest in the lamp.&quot; Beldazarr just floated there without saying anything. After a few minutes Mike shouted &quot;I'M YOUR MASTER! YOU HAVE TO GRANT MY WISH!&quot;<br />
<br />
Beldazarr leaned down so his face was right in front of Mike's and said &quot;That is where you are WRONG! You are not the one who cleansed my lamp. For your impertinence you will be punished. Before I punish you though I want to hear what my master summoned me for.&quot; He turned to Drake waiting for his wish.<br />
<br />
Drake didn't understand what was going on but he said &quot;Well I was going to wish that my friend Rick was a girl like he always wanted to be and that I could watch the transformation. Now I don't know what to wish for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will grant the wish you summoned me for&quot; Beldazarr said. &quot;I'll even make this fraternity a co-ed house so you can be together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about me?&quot; Mike asked clearly frightened.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will see&quot; Beldazarr said.<br />
<br />
There was a knock on the door and Rick's voice asked &quot;Drake, may I come in?&quot;<br />
<br />
Drake unlocked the door and Rick walked in. He stopped up short however and looked at Beldazarr with fascination in his eyes. Drake closed and locked the door again then asked &quot;What's up Rick?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just had this feeling that I needed to come here all of a sudden&quot; Rick said still staring at Beldazarr. &quot;Is that because of this genie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The correct term is djinn&quot; Beldazarr said. &quot;I am the one that put that desire in your mind. Your friend had summoned me so you could become a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Rick asked. He then turned to Drake and threw his arms around him in a big hug. &quot;Oh thank you Drake&quot; he said his voice sounding like he was about to cry. &quot;You have no idea what this means to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... you're welcome&quot; Drake said stunned by Rick's behavior.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you would please step back so your transformation can begin&quot; Beldazarr said. &quot;My master wants to watch you transform.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick broke the hug and looked into Drake's eyes with his tear filled ones. &quot;You must really like me&quot; he said smiling. It was as if Rick was in love with Drake. He stepped back and said &quot;I'm ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
Beldazarr clapped his hands and Rick's clothes disappeared. Drake watched as Rick's body and pubic hair receded into his body. This was followed by his hair growing until it was to his mid back. His face became more oval in shape and his lips became a little fuller. His nose shrunk and became a cute button nose. His neck thinned as his Adam's Apple disappeared. His shoulders narrowed and his arms slimmed as well as his hands. His chest narrowed and the aureole around his nipples enlarged. A pair of C cup breasts pushed themselves out of his chest. The transformation continued down to his waist which narrowed just a bit while his hips widened giving him a slight hourglass shape.<br />
<br />
As Drake watched he realized that he was getting hard watching his friend transform into a girl. The next part of Rick's transformation made him rock hard as his cock and balls shrank and pulled into his body. His ball sack also shrank and skin on either side started to fold over forming the outer lips of Rick's new pussy with his ball sack forming the inner lips. His new pussy crept down to between his legs taking it's proper place. The transformation continued down his legs slimming them and his feet. The final part of the transformation was Rick lost a little height going from five foot eight to five foot five.<br />
<br />
Drake could hardly believe that this naked girl was his friend Rick. She didn't remain naked for long however as clothes began to appear on her body. A pair of red silk lace panties and matching bra appeared. A red satin dress was the next to appear along with a pair of red sandals on her feet. Red nail polish appeared on her toenails and fingernails. He hadn't noticed before but her fingernails had grown a bit longer. Red lipstick appeared on her lips and pink eyeshadow appeared on her eyes. A little blush appeared on her cheeks and dangling heart-shaped ruby earrings appeared in her ears.<br />
<br />
Drake watched as the room subtly changed. It now showed signs of a girl living in it as well as a guy. Mike looked around and asked &quot;Where did my stuff go?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You won't be needing them&quot; Beldazarr said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-why is that?&quot; Mike asked clearly afraid of the answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;As your punishment you will become a djinn yourself&quot; Beldazarr said with a grin. &quot;You will be a djinn of mind and body the same as I am. There are a couple of differences though. The first is that you'll live in a ring which I will give to Rick. The second is that you will be a female djinn and your name will be Munya. Take care of the ring Rick.&quot; Beldazarr laughed and disappeared back into his lamp.<br />
<br />
Once he was gone Drake and Rick looked at Mike who wasn't Mike anymore. He was now a female djinn floating in fog connected to a ring on Rick's finger. Rick smiled and in his new feminine voice said &quot;Well I guess since you're still here I get three wishes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll only grant one wish for each cleansing of the ring&quot; Munya said with a look of self-loathing on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then I wish for unlimited wishes&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That I can not grant&quot; Munya said a bit snippy. &quot;The only wishes I can grant are those that change a person or persons' body or mind in the past, present, or future. Only they and you will know about the change whatever it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will Drake know about them?&quot; Rick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only if you wish it&quot; Munya said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I wish that Drake is aware of any changes I make wishing&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Granted mistress&quot; Munya said. &quot;I really hate being a girl again and one that's a slave too.&quot; With that she and her cloak disappeared into the ring.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well what shall we call you now Rick?&quot; Drake asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know&quot; Rick said. &quot;Perhaps I'll call myself Rikki. It's close to my male nickname.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that's a great idea&quot; Drake said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, what are we going to do about your little problem?&quot; Rikki asked coming close to Drake and kissing him.<br />
<br />
Drake was surprised at first but was soon returning the kiss. He didn't know why he had wanted to see her transform but he was glad he did. He realized that he could possibly love her and he was single at the moment. She seemed to love him and he knew she hadn't been seeing anyone.<br />
<br />
They broke apart and Rikki again asked &quot;What are we going to do about your little problem?&quot; She was smiling and her arms were around his neck. It was a good question.</p>
