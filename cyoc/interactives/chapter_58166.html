<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rick looked out the hotel window and sighed. The yacht just barely had enough fuel <br />
left for them to reach port. The captain took a big gamble leaving the traffic lanes since <br />
they could have been stranded at sea. That wasn't what was bothering him though. It <br />
wasn't even the fact that he wanted to be a little girl with his whole being. What was <br />
bothering him was a sense that something wasn't right. He couldn't figure out what it <br />
was which made it difficult for him to go to sleep.<br />
<br />
Sighing again Rick turned from the window and looked at the sleeping forms of <br />
Maylene and Dennis. After Kurse had been defeated he had wanted to marry Maylene <br />
but now that desire was growing smaller and smaller. He wanted her to be happy and <br />
didn't want to hurt her but he was beginning to believe that their marriage wouldn't be <br />
a happy one. His desire to be a little girl would make him unhappy and perhaps <br />
suicidal. He couldn't put Maylene or Dennis through that so it would be best to call off <br />
the wedding now. Maylene would be hurt but she wouldn't go through the worry she <br />
was sure to go through if she were to marry him. He had made up his mind to tell her <br />
in the morning before they left to go back home to the United States. It was likely that <br />
she wouldn't want to speak to him ever again especially after sharing a bed tonight <br />
but he had to do it. Shaking his head he climbed into the bed and eventually fell <br />
asleep.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Rick found himself walking in a dark forest following some fireflies a kid again. Not only <br />
was he a kid again but he now had long hair and was wearing a simple dress. <br />
Pressing his hand against his crotch he was pleasantly surprised to not find a dick. He <br />
didn't know how it happened and didn't really care. He was just happy that he was a <br />
little girl now and giggled as he followed the fireflies.<br />
<br />
Rick came upon a clearing and stopped short seeing three women in it. One of the <br />
women had only one eye and half her face was deformed. He knew these were the <br />
witches that had started the curse which eventually gained sentience and became <br />
known as Kurse. The one with the missing eye saw him and smiled. The other two <br />
noticed the first smiling and looking saw why she was smiling and smiled themselves. <br />
&quot;Joella,&quot; all three of them said at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh my name's not Joella,&quot; Rick said shaking his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;We know,&quot; the one with the missing eye said sighing. &quot;But you look so much like our <br />
Joella right now so I hope that you won't mind us calling you that. It's a better name for <br />
a girl anyway. You know who we are?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I do,&quot; Rick said nodding. &quot;You're the witches that cast the curse on Glendale. <br />
You're Gommorah, Golgatha, and Gaal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We prefer Grisele, Goldwyn, and Gita now,&quot; Goldwyn said smiling. &quot;Those were our <br />
names when we were little girls like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can I be talking to you when you're dead?&quot; Rick asked cocking his head to the <br />
side. &quot;The wolf pack killed you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What they killed was the madness that took us and was separated from us when we <br />
died,&quot; Gita said looking sad.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are dead and our punishment is to remain here never to see our loved ones until <br />
Glendale forgives us,&quot; Goldwyn said looking down.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not dead though Joella,&quot; Grisele said with a smile. &quot;You're here because we <br />
need your help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My help?&quot; Rick asked looking shocked and surprised. What could they need his help <br />
for? Were they going to try to use him to come back to life?<br />
<br />
&quot;Come here and we'll tell you why we need your help,&quot; Goldwyn said looking up with a <br />
smile. Rick shrugged and went over to her. She wrapped her arms around him as he <br />
sat in her lap and she continued, &quot;There's a major problem growing which could be <br />
worse than Kurse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Worse than Kurse,&quot; Rick said shocked. &quot;How could that be possible?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't know what will happen if things continue on as they are,&quot; Gita said sighing. <br />
&quot;A turn of the curse created the leomans and their true love powers. They included the <br />
true love power so they could bring their families into the pride but unfortunately the <br />
curse didn't stick to their intent. Instead it's spread to friends and their friends and their <br />
friends. Those that know that it's happening are calling it the leoman cascade.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If this cascade is allowed to continue then there won't be many humans left,&quot; Grisele <br />
said shaking her head. &quot;There's where the problem arises. Reality has to rewrite <br />
history to account for the leoman and with each new leoman the more history is <br />
rewritten. Eventually it will spread far enough that it will affect our families. When that <br />
happens we'll become leomans in the past and that will create a paradox.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because doing what you did would be uncivilized,&quot; Rick said nodding.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see you know at least one leoman,&quot; Gita said smiling. &quot;I don't think we have to tell <br />
you what could happen with a paradox.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Reality just may give up and wipe us all out of existence,&quot; Rick said shuddering. &quot;So <br />
what do we do to prevent that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You must go to Glendale before the curse is destroyed,&quot; Goldwyn said. &quot;Find a <br />
woman called Madam Serenity and a female leoman named Gillie. You'll also need to <br />
find someone with a turn. Once you have found them you need to find where the <br />
center of our rune is. This is the place where the curse is at it's strongest where the <br />
magic is most concentrated. You need to stand in the center of the rune and the three <br />
others around you. Make sure the one who has the turn will transform you how you <br />
want them to and have them transform you while you're standing at the center of our <br />
rune. It will be best if you become female since a female can hold more magic easier <br />
than a male can. Once you transform you should be flooded with magic which will <br />
ingrain itself into you. After that you will need to cast the spell to strip the leomans of <br />
their true love powers and stop the leoman cascade.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's the spell?&quot; Rick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll come up with it,&quot; Grisele said putting a hand on Rick's shoulder. &quot;You'll have to <br />
hurry once you're back in your body though. Once the curse is destroyed it will <br />
become much harder to stop the leoman cascade.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You also need to be standing in the exact center of our rune for this to work,&quot; Gita <br />
said placing a hand on Rick's other shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please do everything you can to succeed Joella,&quot; Goldwyn said giving Rick a little <br />
squeeze. &quot;We don't regret what we did trying to make the world a better place but we <br />
don't want to see it wiped out of existence. Good luck and come back to see us.&quot;<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Rick woke up to sunshine streaming through the window. Looking at the clock he was <br />
relieved to see that it was still early and they had plenty of time before their flight. He <br />
was disappointed that he was a man again and would have normally chalked up his <br />
experience with the witches as a dream. However with what had happened to them on <br />
the island he wasn't going to just write it off as a dream. If there was a leoman <br />
cascade then there was the possibility of a paradox looming on the horizon. He would <br />
need to go to Glendale and see if Madame Serenity and Gillie existed. If they did then <br />
that would mean he wasn't dreaming and the threat of a paradox was real. He looked <br />
at Maylene and decided not to tell her he thought it was best to call off the marriage. If <br />
things panned out reality would fix itself so that there was no talk of them getting <br />
married. They would both be happy and have no memory him as he was now.</p>
