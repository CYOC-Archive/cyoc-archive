Clarification.  Time moved differently in every plane.  One month in the current plane is one year in the home plane, where Kelper is located.  Essentially, one year in Kelper is one month in NYC.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">September 27th, 2017<br />
<br />
Kevin Hill was once a normal teenager, living in suburban Alpine, New Jersey, right outside of New York City.  He had many friends in the area, including in NYC.  He was a high school senior at Tenafly High School, and was hoping to get accepted into American University, as he wanted to be a law student.  Then, everything changed one night.  On the night of December 15th, 2016, while studying for a math test, he was transported to a land that he&#39;d never thought existed.  One where magic, dragons, demons, and angels existed.  For nine years he lived here as a familiar to Rowan Tyrell.  Now, he, or should I say you, have returned home.  The sight of the NYC skyscrapers you once marveled at made you instantly remember everything about your previous life.  Your friends, your family, your pets, your home, everything.  It was all too much at once, at least it would be for a normal person.  But, you are much more than a normal person.  You&#39;ve transcended mortality and the bonds of the human race.  If Rowan wasn&#39;t standing right next to you, you would be the most powerful being in the world.  Second isn&#39;t too shabby though...  <br />
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
&quot;Rowan?&quot;  You asked your Master, who was standing at the sidewalk gawking at the majesty of the Empire State Building.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Kevin?&quot;  Rowan responded, still transfixed on the monolithic skyscraper.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it would be wise to set up a base of operations.&quot;  You suggested.  &quot;It would be nice to have a place to call home around here, wouldn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be Kevin.&quot;  Rowan smiled, taking his violet eyes off of the office building.  &quot;Where would you want it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know the perfect place.&quot;  You smiled.  &quot;I used to live around here.  It&#39;s nothing like our castle at home, but my old home is a nice, cozy place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s go there.&quot;  Rowan said, patting you on the back.  &quot;What are we waiting for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I do want to do a couple of things before we leave the City.&quot;  You grinned, looking at the Bank of America close by.  &quot;We have all of that cash from the incident in Connecticut, might as well keep it safe.&quot;  You walked towards the Bank of America, holding a bag Rowan magically created to hold the cash.  When you entered the building, you noticed the line for the tellers was quite full.  &quot;Well, it&#39;s not like we&#39;re on a tight schedule.&quot;  You smiled, getting on the line.<br />
<br />
Eventually, you made it to the end of the line.  &quot;Can I help who&#39;s next?&quot;  The teller asked.  You walked up with Rowan and the bag.  &quot;Hello and welcome to Bank of America.  How can I help you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We would like to open up a checking account.&quot;  You said.  This was the first non-hostile interaction you had with a mortal in this plane since Maine, and that wasn&#39;t much of a conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have any money to transfer into it from a different account?&quot;  The teller asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.  I just have a bag full of cash.&quot;  You laughed.  &quot;When our parents died, they left us everything, but in cash.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry to hear that.  Can I have your name, identification, and Social Security Number?&quot;  The teller asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit!&quot;  You thought.  &quot;I forgot about that stuff!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the issue?&quot;  Rowan asked you telepathically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Identification.&quot;  You responded.  &quot;We don&#39;t exist in this plane, so we are certainly not in the system.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That seems like an issue.&quot;  Rowan smiled.  &quot;Let&#39;s fix that.&quot;  Rowan put his hand in his pocket and started to use some manipulation magic.  While nobody could see it, you could feel a magical presence emanating from his pocket.  &quot;What number do you want for this Social Security Number thing?&quot;  You rattled off your old SSN, and Rowan magically put it in the system, along with all of the information you&#39;d need to be a citizen of America.  Address, date of birth, everything.  You gave the information, Rowan put it in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir!&quot;  You heard out of nowhere.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, what?&quot;  You asked, realizing that you were ignoring the teller for a long time.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need your identification and other information.&quot;  She demanded.  &quot;You spaced out for a long time!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about that.  I always forget my Social.&quot;  You gave her all of the information Rowan fed into the system, and even gave her a driver&#39;s license that you magically created for yourself.  After everything, you had a checking account with $45,000 in it, and a debit card in your name.  Before you left, you tested out your full manipulation magic prowess and tried to manipulate how much money was in your account.  When you went to the ATM to take out some money, you found that the final balance was $84,588,200.  Not bad.<br />
<br />
By the time you left NYC that night, you had 5 bank accounts between you and Rowan, giving the two of you a net worth of 157 billion dollars, enough designer clothing and accessories to open your own store on 5th avenue, brand new Galaxy s8&#39;s, and all of the documentation you need in life.  It was as if the two of you were always billionaires who lived in the area, rather than extraplanar Gods among men who have been in this plane for less than 48 hours.  When you made it to the house in Alpine, you noticed that your parents were home.  You remember that your existence in this plane was erased when Rowan brought you to Kelper.  You started tearing up, knowing that you were about to level the whole neighborhood to create a mansion that was to be your and Rowan&#39;s home.  &quot;Kevin, are you okay?&quot;  Rowan asked, noticing your crying.<br />
<br />
&quot;My parents are in there, and they have no idea that they have a son.&quot;  You forced through the tears.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not entirely sure about that.&quot;  Rowan stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;  You asked, trying to wipe the tears away.  &quot;The Archdemon said that when you transported me to Kelper, all existence of Kevin Hill was erased.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It might not have been.&quot;  Rowan stated.  &quot;When I was putting in our information, it was much easier to put yours in than mine.  I think your returning here might have brought you back to existence.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s find out.&quot;  You said, wiping the last tear away.  You walked up to the large suburban home and rang the doorbell.  After a minute, someone came to the door.  It was your mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kevin?  Is that you?&quot;  She asked, recognizing you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes mom!  It&#39;s been so long!&quot;  You cried.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to tell the authorities that you&#39;ve been found!  We&#39;ve been looking for you ever since you disappeared!&quot;  She continued.  &quot;Frank!  Kevin&#39;s returned!!&quot;  She shouted into the house.  &quot;You need to tell us everything that happened!  We were worried sick!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I come in first?&quot;  You asked, motioning Rowan to approach.  &quot;Also, this is the guy who found me.  His name is Rowan Tyrell.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Hill.&quot;  He smiled, holding out an outstretched hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for returning our boy to us!&quot;  Mrs. Hill cried.  &quot;I&#39;m Ashley Hill.&quot;  She was barely able to complete the handshake through the emotions.  &quot;Wait.  Rowan Tyrell.  Aren&#39;t you a multi-billionaire?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;  Rowan answered quizzically.  &quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did our son end up with you?&quot;  Ashley asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a long story.&quot;  You smiled.  &quot;A lot has happened in the past few months.&quot;  (You saw that only 9 month had passed when you saw the date on a newspaper).<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed.&quot;  Rowan smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s just go in and talk at the table.&quot;  Ashley suggested, trying to end the tears of joy streaming out of her eyes.<br />
<br />
Ten minutes later<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you like anything to drink Mr. Tyrell?&quot;  Frank asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No thank you.&quot;  Rowan smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about you Kevin?&quot;  Frank asked, turning to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just some water.&quot;  You responded, looking around your house.<br />
<br />
&quot;We kept your room exactly as it was the night you disappeared.&quot;  Ashley said, tears still streaming down her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened that night Kev?&quot;  Frank asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, while I was studying, I fell asleep at my desk.  The next thing I knew, I was in the hospital.  Apparently I got amnesia from a bad fall while sleepwalking.  Rowan found me and took care of me until I regained my memories.  That&#39;s the long and short of it.&quot;  You smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you wait so long to return him?  Did nobody see the missing person notices?  How did nobody notice this?&quot;  Ashley started yelling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please mom!&quot;  You yelled, trying to calm her down.  &quot;He was taking care of me until I got better.  I didn&#39;t realize until today that Rowan wasn&#39;t my dad!  He&#39;s six years older than me!  If he brought me back, I would have thought you guys were complete strangers!&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Why didn&#39;t you call to tell us he was all right?&quot;  Frank interjected.  &quot;You could have at least done that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I never saw the missing person notices.&quot;  Rowan stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;HOW!&quot;  Ashley yelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;MOM!  CALM DOWN!&quot;  You yelled.  &quot;Everything is okay now, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right.&quot;  Ashley panted, trying to calm herself down.  &quot;This could have all gone much better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it could have gone much worse, right?&quot;  Rowan added, trying to defuse the situation.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess.&quot;  Frank stated.  &quot;I&#39;m just glad you&#39;re okay.&quot;  Frank and Ashley both came in to hug you.  Immediately, you started crying again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry Mom and Dad.  I have to do this.&quot;  You thought to yourself as you left the hug.  With a blue flash, Ashley and Frank Hill forgot that they had a son, and the whole world thought that you and Rowan were brothers.  With another flash, Ashley and Frank Hill started their life in rural Maine, and all of their stuff went along with them.  With a third and final flash, the whole world thought this was normal.  &quot;I finally found my parents, only to force them out of my life forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, when you&#39;re in the system as Kevin Tyrell, brother of Rowan Tyrell, it&#39;s hard to have a completely different life.&quot;  Rowan smiled.  &quot;They might be your parents, but ever since your transformation into my familiar, your family became me and only me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know Master.&quot;  You said, sitting on the now empty floor.  &quot;This was just very bittersweet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know Gannoth.&quot;  Rowan smiled, sitting on the floor with you.  &quot;They could not know about your new life.  Your life as the second most powerful sorcerer ever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know!  I just wish there was a better way.&quot;  You yelled, crying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gannoth.  I know it&#39;s tough.&quot;  Rowan said to you, trying to ease the situation.  &quot;Anyway, there&#39;s something I want to tell you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it Master?&quot;  You asked Rowan, starting to lose the tears.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve lived for 62 years now.  Out of those, the past nine with you were the best.  Better than before I knew magic existed.  Better than when my powers first awakened.  Better than anything.  You&#39;ve been an invaluable familiar to me.  More than you understand.&quot;  Rowan started.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are you going with this Master?&quot;  You asked, confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;When you almost died, the Archdemon said something I&#39;ll never forget.  &#39;He changed you&#39;.  You changed me Gannoth.  Before I summoned you, I was the cold, ruthless, pure evil sorcerer I was when you first met me.  The one that destroyed Firenze and Kitria because I felt like it.  You made me into a better person.  A better me.  And, I can&#39;t thank you enough.  It is said that when the master of a familiar dies, one of two things happen.  They live forever in a state of limbo, or they die.  Either way, the bonds and servitude of being a familiar are broken.  However, there are other ways to break the chain.  Sometimes, the master of a familiar might break the chain on their own out of respect or gratitude towards the familiar.&quot;  Rowan explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Master...&quot;  You started.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gannoth.  From this day forward, you are no longer my familiar.&quot;  Rowan interrupted.  &quot;From this day forward, you are truly my younger brother.&quot;  Rowan shot a beam of white light at you, and you immediately felt your already monumental power grow exponentially.  &quot;It is said that a familiar is only 10% as strong as their master.  Gannoth, your power is currently growing to what it should be.  You will still be weaker than me, but by an amount so insignificant that it doesn&#39;t really matter.  Also, Gannoth is a familiar name.  You need a new name.&quot;  You couldn&#39;t speak, as you felt pure power coursing through your veins.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mas... er, Brother?  Is this how you feel all the time?&quot;  You asked, shocked at the feeling of power.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like your made of pure power?&quot;  Rowan asked.  &quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This feels incredible!&quot;  You stated, sensing your new strength.  &quot;I feel unstoppable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You already were.&quot;  Rowan smiled.  &quot;Anyway, did you hear me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.  What did you say?&quot;  You asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;In essence, you&#39;re about ten times stronger now as you are not bound to me as a familiar anymore, and you can choose a new name for yourself, as Gannoth was your familiar name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve always like the name Adrian...&quot;  You started.  &quot;From now on, my name is Adrian Tyrell, King of the Dragons and brother of Rowan Tyrell, King of the Kingdom of Kelper.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, my brother Adrian.&quot;  Rowan smiled, hugging you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rowan?&quot;  You started.  &quot;Does this mean our souls are no longer connected?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.  We still are connected.&quot;  Rowan smiled.  &quot;We are not brothers by blood, but brothers by soul.  As you grow in power, so do I.  As I grow in power, so do you.  As you feel pain, I feel pain.  As I feel pain, you feel pain.  You are no longer bound to me.  You are no longer subservient to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is going to be a lot to get used to.&quot;  You stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we have a lot of time, and a plane to conquer.&quot;  Rowan smiled, snapping his finger.  Immediately, the large suburban family home became a mansion worthy of the billionaire Tyrell brothers, complete with full furnishing and opulence.<br />
