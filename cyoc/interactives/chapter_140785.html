<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;If I may ask... if the official &quot;interview&quot; that will go together with episode you want to do with Thanksgiving... why are all of us here?&quot; Lara Walkerson wondered as Animalia Ambassadoria made their way through Horizon&#39;s hallways, with one of the secretaries leading them along. &quot;None of us know Russian.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d wonder on how the interview would go,&quot; Courtney Hedge commented, &quot;From what those guys in Animalia&#39;s media department told us... I can see some of the idea behind why her conversion was allowed and all... but if we don&#39;t know Russian and her English is limited... how would that work?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d think she&#39;d have an actual translator that&#39;s come with her,&quot; Abby commented, &quot;but most of the interview isn&#39;t going to be too much. We don&#39;t want this to be political, as her reason for converting wasn&#39;t political in nature and more that she was seeking medical care.&quot;<br />
<br />
There were a few nods. They&#39;d been called meet at Animalia&#39;s Great Hall to discuss with the media department regarding Elly&#39;s conversion. They&#39;d been told the reasons that had been given to Horizon for why she wanted to convert and some of the legal loopholes that Horizon had pulled even allow her entry into the US. In some ways Elly&#39;s story was sympathetic and if her conversion helped provide possible clues as to what the full cause of Regressive Hypersexuality Disorder, and thus find eventually find a way to prevent the condition from occurring in future conversions, there was some reason to understand the reasoning. However, because Elly only had a limited knowledge of English and was said to be fairly shy, it had been felt that before Animalia Ambassadoria conducted any formal interview, they would at least meet her face to face, so that way they would all get to meet her. It was planned to be something of a means to help Elly get used to things before anything more formal happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;It may still be good to ask if she ultimately wishes to move to the US, and go through all the immigration process or if she wishes to return to Russia after she&#39;s acclimated to being an Animalian, of if she will stay longer... but only with regard to Horizon&#39;s present research into countering Regressive Hypersexuality Disorder,&quot; Simon commented slowly, &quot;but that would be something to wait on asking until the formal interview... as it probably WILL be an issue. Particularly with all the stuff that&#39;s gone on regarding Russia.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That really depends on which side of the aisle you&#39;re on,&quot; Sophie gave a sigh, &quot;the President and his supporters are all in favor of appeasing Russia&#39;s government at every turn... and while the recent elections flipped the House, the Senate remains under Republican control.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not to mention that the new Congress wont&#39; take office till January,&quot; Courtney shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember... THAT is to be kept out of this,&quot; Abby insisted, &quot;from what were told she can be a bit shy. Pummeling her with &quot;are you a Russian spy&quot; questions is not going to help matters.&quot;<br />
<br />
The others nodded and they followed along the route that lead to the transformation rooms that Horizon had. It was a familiar route for some of them. Sophie and Roland both remembered following the route when they came with their parents for their conversion at the start of the previous summer. For the new members of Animalia Ambassadoria it was a first, as Horizon wasn&#39;t a site for major field trips, as the genetic sciences that was the main part of the company&#39;s work was a bit more complex than what the average school would teach. However, the secretary had let them as part of the overall plan, which related to the fact that Horizon and Animalia had cooperated so closely since Animalia&#39;s founding.<br />
<br />
They eventually came around a corner to find Judy standing in the hallway with a man in a dark suit with a flag pin on his lapel. Standing across from the man was a large female White Rhinoceros Animalian. This had to be Elly, and Samson figured that she actually stood slightly taller than the male White Rhinoceros Animalians that were part of the Rhino Guard. Elly was dressed in a pair of jeans with bare feet and a large padded jacket that was zipped up, though still failed to hide her rather impressive chest. Jen and Marjorie had the largest breasts among all Animalia at present, and while Elly was smaller than the two Sauropod Dinotopians, both in overall weight and proportionate size to her body as a whole, she was still impressive in size. They could only watch as Judy&#39;s ears turned at their approach, while Elly noticed the size of the group and took one shy step back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Judy,&quot; Jessica came forward figuring that her smaller size when compared to Abby and Samson, would trigger fewer instincts of irritation that could trigger a charge, &quot;this is Elly?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, this is Elly, and this is Mr. Julius Striker from the US State Department,&quot; Judy then gestured to the man in the suit, &quot;He&#39;s been assigned to help Elly with any and all situations where she may have trouble with English.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But the people at the people running Animalia&#39;s media said she knows English,&quot; Ronald Wilson commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;She knows some English,&quot; Judy answered, &quot;but he&#39;ll be there to help her should there be anything she doesn&#39;t understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Schools include some English,&quot; Elly managed slowly and shyly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... it&#39;ll be okay, Elly,&quot; Jessica spoke, &quot;Welcome to Animalia and I hope you&#39;ll enjoy your time here. Everyone here in Lyre and Animalia will be quite friendly... and I&#39;m sure there will be plenty you&#39;ll like. Thanksgiving isn&#39;t too far away. You&#39;ll like it... I hope.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; Elly said, sounding a bit puzzled, but she did take the young white furred Rabbit Animalian&#39;s paw and they shook hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Jessica, and this is my bond-mate Roger,&quot; Jessica introduced herself and then gestured to Roger, who gave a small wave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like the cartoon?&quot; Elly wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I&#39;ve liked the cartoon,&quot; Jessica admitted, &quot;but my family&#39;s name is Mariana, and Roger&#39;s is Lightfoot... after the family that owned him before he was uplifted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You vere… uplifted?&quot; Elly managed slowly, after Striker explained the uplifting concept for mundane animals that became Animalians.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Roger nodded, &quot;I still live with the Lightfoot&#39;s... as they feel like family, even though they&#39;re human. And a fair number of Animalians are like me... mundane animals that were uplifted. Some other friends of ours here, Mary Alice Wesley, Travis, JC, Pauline, and Samson Brown were all uplifted too.&quot;<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t mention any surname for JC or Pauline. He didn&#39;t know for sure if either Microraptor Dinotopian had ever taken one and didn&#39;t know about JC&#39;s regarding Sophie as his mother. As such Roger stayed quiet on that and let those he&#39;d introduced wave to Elly so seemed to look a bit more comfortable, though her blue eyes did dart to the others. She recognized that four were Dinotopians of some kind, though two looked to have feathers like birds, largely gray but with red tails, and the other two had long beaks with a crest on the upper par of their beaks. The two with beaks had their heads tilted down, which Elly privately wondered meant that their crest interfered with their vision, sort of like her horns did for her. But there were also a fair number of humans with them as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Abby Brown, Samson&#39;s bond-mate,&quot; Abby said as she came forward, &quot;and you needn&#39;t worry about any of us. You are safe here in Animalia and you won&#39;t be threatened or treated poorly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Da,&quot; Elly nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;And these are my closest friends... you&#39;ve already met Jessica and Roger,&quot; Abby began to introduce the others. Each stepped forward and gave a wave as their name was given, &quot;This is Sarah Wesley, Mary Alice&#39;s sister and Travis&#39;s bond-mate. Simon Truman, Mary Alice&#39;s bond-mate... though don&#39;t get to startled if she prefers Malice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Malice?&quot; Elly asked after a translation.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s shorter,&quot; Malice gave a shrug, &quot;less wordy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But she&#39;s not mean,&quot; Sarah placed an arm around her sister, &quot;She&#39;s the best sister I could ask for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Belle?&quot; Malice teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s our best baby sister,&quot; Sarah smiled back.<br />
<br />
Abby meanwhile continued with the introductions and moved on to Sophie, &quot;This is Sophie Albers and her bond-mate Roland Luwrie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Little dinosaurs...&quot; Elly commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pterosaurs, actually,&quot; Sophie corrected, &quot;not Dinosaurs... but they did live at the same time. Mine and Roland&#39;s specific species is Pterodactyl... Pterodactylus Antiquus in its scientific name... and they were small in size... comparable to modern hawks/falcons today. JC and Pauline are both Microraptors, which are dinosaurs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With feathers,&quot; Elly noted, gaining a little confidence, as everyone seemed to be friendly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d be surprised on what scientists have learned about prehistoric life in recent years,&quot; JC commented with a  small smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;And the rest are some of our newest members of Animalia Ambassadoria,&quot; Abby continued and then motioned to the rest that were there, &quot;Lara Walkerson, Courtney Hedge,Katherine Keuchel, Fred Stairs, Johan Eecks, Jenny Jenkins, Julie Jenkins, Rebecca Longshot, Ryan Patricks,  Penelope Tellz, Athena Shepard, and Ronald Wilson.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re all scheduled to help you out as needed,&quot; Julie spoke up slowly and help you get used to Lyre and Animalia as much as we can... though tours and that sort of thing will have to go around our school schedule.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You all go to school together?!&quot; Elly gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, WSA,&quot; Abby nodded, &quot;and after some difficulties that related to infrastructure issues and... other things... Animalia&#39;s school district and the Lyre School District were integrated for this school year. It&#39;s been fun and we all get along together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds nice,&quot; Elly said slowly, remembering her own issues with bullies who couldn&#39;t handle her condition well and bullied her for it.<br />
<br />
&quot;There will also be a scheduled interview with a pair of our team, here,&quot; Abby added, &quot;for the Animalia Ambassadoria show... but we won&#39;t do that until you&#39;re better adjusted. Until then... we&#39;re here to help you as much as we can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Elly answered after a translation was given to her by Striker.</p>
