<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Melissa went down to the lab, she saw a group of young men swaggering on their way out - all looking about eighteen. One especially muscular one stopped right by her and flexed his quads then and there. She giggled despite herself and how vain and showy that was, but she recognized the almost Roman-esque curls and intriguing dark eyes of the young man. She recalled seeing an old picture shown off by--- &quot;Nolan...!?&quot; She almost could not believe it. This was Nolan? The old man? His picture had shown him to be a total beefcake when he was younger, but seeing it on paper and seeing it in real life was something else.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wanna feel these quads a bit more?&quot; He grinned and slapped one of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...have my own business to take care of down here, maybe later, big guy.&quot; Nolan turned and left with the others, still looking almost foolishly excited. His testosterone had definitely been rekindled and resupplied, because Melissa could definitely see a proud tent in his new clothes - just flirting with her that much had induced such a state.<br />
<br />
As she entered she was once again left looking just as well at how impressive Ethan was.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d removed his doctorial labcoat, and thus stood there in a half unbuttoned dress shirt. For all that he was in his mid-forties, even older than her, he was easily in absolutely incredible shape. Damn she wished she could touch those pectorals. Meatier than Carl&#39;s, even! &quot;Hello, Melissa, I&#39;m guessing you had your date with Carl - and now you&#39;re down here for one specific reason.&quot;<br />
<br />
She licked her lips, &quot;Are you a mindreader too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope, I can just guess you want to be more able to keep up with Carl&#39;s new speed,&quot; Ethan commented, a hand drifting to his hip. He smirked, and she swooned. Noting as she did there was an injector full of the Chronos serum on the table. What she did not see was Ethan carrying one in his hand behind his back. He was very strongly tempted at this rate. Seeing how Nolan had regressed into...all that...left Ethan feeling like he needed this, even though he didn&#39;t really.<br />
<br />
He was in the best shape out of any scientist here. So why was he so tempted to return to that age...?<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d...be right,&quot; She started, &quot;I&#39;m 33. I won&#39;t be able to keep up with Carl&#39;s needs and wants very long. And I need this gravy train to be on full speed for a while. I&#39;m...sorry if that sounds selfish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We all have our wants and needs,&quot; Ethan responded. &quot;Go ahead. It&#39;s all yours. I prepared a few more doses.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Ethan.&quot; And with that Melissa stepped forward and applied the injector to her arm. Almost immediately she felt a hot flash that made her take a step back, moaning under her breath - a heavy, hot moan. And she gasped, feeling her skin tightening, growing smoother again, cellulite and small wrinkles fading. Her breasts---ohh! She gripped them in her hands, feeling them become perkier, tighter, larger!<br />
<br />
Ethan, watching this, bit his lip and reminded himself of his own injector. Ohh, it was so tempting watching Melissa, already beautiful and vivacious, returning to her youth. He wanted to just inject himself and regress right alongside her. Muscles flexed, and Ethan was aware of his cock growing harder...<br />
<br />
And she could not help herself but move to grip her pussy not long after. It was an astonishing feeling, this regression. Her body becoming fitter, more athletic and trim! She watched her dress strain under the growth of her breasts, saw her hands return to their more youthful, smooth state. She gasped as she found her core tightening, growing fit and defined. She was becoming a properly hard bodied woman as she regressed. Her touch on her pussy right there through her tight dress and now drenched underwear increased in intensity. She was aroused beyond measure by how this was feeling. She needed Carl - Ethan - Nolan - someone!<br />
<br />
Observing this, Ethan if anything grew even harder. He was sweating, of course he was, staining his shirt a bit and making it seem even tighter on his body. His nipples pressing against his shirt, his abs visible through it, the 45 year old scientist gulped and thought about how satisfying it would be to regress. He&#39;d probably feel just as good if not more good than Melissa was right now. A fantasy played out in his head of him injecting and then fucking her as he regressed. <br />
<br />
His cock leaked into his pants, and Ethan moaned.<br />
<br />
She looked like someone who did cheer squad athletics by the time she returned to eighteen. A trim and vibrant appearance, her hair voluminous and her features beautiful. She quivered as she grasped the side of the table, feeling like she was on the edge of orgasm from the sensation alone. And then she remembered Ethan.<br />
<br />
Ethan stood there, holding the injector up, thinking about his past, his future, and what happened with Carl. Of how he wanted so very much to enjoy his life the way these two probably would be. Despite identifying as straight, a perverse image popped into his head of him joining in a sexual session with Melissa and Carl as his eighteen year old self...and then fucking them both. Ethan looked at Melissa, and then looked at the injector, resting in his hand, all the fluid inside ready to go.<br />
<br />
He could have that, he knew.<br />
<br />
The serum could return him to his blissful state as the well muscled eighteen year old football prodigy AND retain all his scientific know-how and expertise. What could he do with another lifetime&#39;s worth of experience? What else could he achieve if he grew up again with all this that he did...?<br />
<br />
&quot;Well?&quot; Melissa asked mischievously, &quot;If you use it, maybe we can have some fun~&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan looked at her and down at the injector again, his brow heavy with sweat, a smile tugging at his face. He was oh so very tempted, despite knowing as a scientist that using his own material on himself was an amateur&#39;s mistake. He---He needed to retain a level head. To be the man in the room. Even though he wanted oh so badly to join Nolan, David, Gus, Carl and now Melissa in their revelry that was sure to come...</p>
