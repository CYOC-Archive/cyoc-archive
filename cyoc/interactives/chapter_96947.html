<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Martha sat quietly and nervously as she watched both Samantha and Frances approach. Both of them were transformed but were wearing lose fitting dresses that Martha guessed didn&#39;t irritate their fur. Her irritation with William&#39;s sudden actions kept her from thinking on how strangely beautiful the two werecats were in their own way. The patted Nate&#39;s shoulders and then rubbed their sides against him and giving an audible purr before letting him go to watch television. Frances then looked over to her mate and moved to approach Martha. Samantha gave a nod to the unsaid comment from her mate and prepared to head out.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not staying?&quot; Martha found herself asking, &quot;I... I don&#39;t want to be alone...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You won&#39;t be,&quot; Frances came and sat beside Martha and hugged her, again purring, &quot;I&#39;ll be with you to be your bodyguard. Samantha will be going to track down your husband.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He... he cheated on me...&quot; Martha said weakly, &quot;AGAIN.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances glanced over to Samantha who frowned and then left. Frances only sighed as she knew that she had her work cut out for her. Their tea party had been pleasant, and she and Samantha wanted Martha to become a werecat if she were to become a were, but unlike Yvette, the two of them were more willing to go through official channels and they wouldn&#39;t do anything that would make Martha unfaithful to William and bring their loyalty to each other into question. However, the werefox&#39;s actions had been more than enough to cause additional trouble and now both Frances and Samantha would have to give Martha comfort and recover William. Samantha had checked her cellphone messages on the way over and found the update from the college dean. The weretiger had apparently caught a werefox trying to rape William and intervened. Apparently, though, the weretiger hadn&#39;t been able to prevent William getting infected.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s probably not his fault,&quot; Frances said weakly, taking Martha&#39;s hands in her own.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?!&quot; Martha roared to life, making Frances lower her ears and cringe.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not saying you were wrong about him running off with a were,&quot; Frances explained, &quot;I&#39;m saying he might not have been in his right mind when he did so.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha blinked and looked over to the werecat. Her hair was presently pulled back into a ponytail and let her medium length fur frame her head and face. Her green eyes, even with their slit pupils, had a look of nervous sympathy about them. This only raised curiosity on Martha&#39;s part and she rubbed Frances&#39;s hands back, actually enjoying the feel of Frances&#39; soft fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;What... what happened?&quot; Martha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;From what we know... apparently one of your husband&#39;s students, a female werefox tried to rape him in the college parking lot,&quot; Frances said slowly, making Martha&#39;s eyes widen in shock, &quot;at the time the college dean managed to stop her before she could do the deed...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But why would he run off with her?&quot; Martha asked, &quot;If this werefox tried to rape him... even with everything... I&#39;d understand...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s still a man,&quot; Frances said with a chuckle, &quot;men don&#39;t like to not feel in control. More then likely he felt weak and didn&#39;t want reveal that to you...&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances patted Martha&#39;s hands with a friendly and understanding smile on her muzzle, though it lasted only briefly as the next part of her explanation wouldn&#39;t be something that Martha would want to hear.<br />
<br />
&quot;As for why he ran off with this werefox when she came here... more than likely the dean couldn&#39;t prevent the werefox from scratching him, which was likely part of her attempt to rap him,&quot; Frances said slowly, &quot;and one can become a were just being scratched by one. So, the werefox infected him with that scratch and he began to slowly change... and his mind was overwhelmed...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean...&quot; Martha asked fearfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;William isn&#39;t human anymore,&quot; Frances said weakly, &quot;and once he gets his mind back he&#39;ll probably be the man you know and love... it&#39;s just that right now his mind is trying to adapt to a lot of new instincts and sensations that he can&#39;t control. It&#39;s why we prefer things to be done through a ceremony... like what your son will go through. We can control the conversion and make sure no one goes out of control, which is what is going on with your husband. He&#39;s turning into a werefox and isn&#39;t able to control himself yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha gave a nervous gulp. Frances only held Martha&#39;s hands firmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;But once he completes his transformation... he will be in control of himself and he will recognize that the werefox he&#39;s with is not who he truly wants,&quot; Frances spoke, &quot;and he&#39;ll become extremely sexy... for a man... if you still want him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha blinked at how that finished. Strangely she felt a bit relieved that &quot;her&quot; William would be returned to her, but she also picked up something from the way Frances had spoken. It almost sounded as if the werecat wanted her to become a werecat as well, which puzzled her a little bit, as she thought that Frances was pretty much married to Samantha.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Samantha meanwhile made her way into Anderson family&#39;s backyard and looked around. For the moment, things looked quiet with a soft breeze blowing through the trees in the yard as well as the neighboring yards and forest around it. She sniffed at a spot in the grass and soon grimaced and felt air and scent rush into her Jacobson&#39;s organ. She caught the definite scent of a female werefox and William&#39;s scent, which was in slow transition to the scent of a male werefox. She slowly began to follow it, privately wishing that she had brought her own son a long as a werewolf could track the werefox&#39;s scent a lot easier than she could. But, she knew she would track down the werefox and William and confirm what she and Frances suspected after hearing the message from the college&#39;s dean.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Yvette, meanwhile, lead William deeper into the woods. Getting caught by the weretiger dean hadn&#39;t been part of her plan, but to her great personal pleasure, she had apparently managed to claw William and the professor was slowly changing. She could smell the fox in him growing stronger and she relished the pleasure she would feel with him, though she also knew she didn&#39;t have too much time. Once William&#39;s transformation completed and he was in his fox form, the present state he was in would vanish and he&#39;d regain control over himself, which would mean that he would reject her advances again and as a male werefox, she wouldn&#39;t have the strength advantage anymore.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a little further darling,&quot; Yvette said to him, &quot;Just a little further and we&#39;ll see just how good we are...&quot;</p>
