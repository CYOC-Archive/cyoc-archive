<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Zeke ran the other way, screaming something about an attacking force, Toby stopped to stare in terror at the new alien ship descending in front of him.  It was a glistening black, oblong and vaguely cylindrical, but beyond that near impossible to describe, for its &quot;design&quot; seemed to involve random protrusions and cavities of odd shapes that served no clear purpose, and it seemed slowly to shift in form, adding and subtracting new irregularities on its surface by the seconds.<br />
<br />
As Toby snapped out of his shock and his senses returned, and he turned to run, but with a great crash an alien landed right in front of him, having jumped at least 30 meters from the ship to the ground.  Toby fell on his ass and gaped in terror as the creature roared at him, deafening him with its bellow as it snapped it&#39;s great jaws.  It had a shape not unlike an 8 foot minotaur, with a humanoid torso but bovine-like legs and hooves, and where it differed from a minotaur it was only more terrifying.  It had a protruding jaw more like that of a wolf, great clawed hands, and blades protruding forward from its forearm, up from its shoulders, and up from its head in the shape of a crown. It had a long, muscular tail, at the end of which was yet another blade. It&#39;s skin was a glistening, clammy black that dripped a hot fluid of some kind and reminded Toby of the ship.  It wore nothing but a belt that flickered with lights.<br />
<br />
Toby assumed he was about to die, and braced himself for the end, but sensing his submission the creature began to sniff at him.   &quot;Groiyla th!oebleef dley claut?&quot;  It spoke in a guttural, vibrating voice, but Toby had no comprehension of it.  He noticed he was shaking as it continued to inspect him.  It reached out a clawed limb, and Toby recoiled, but then from the hand extruded several long tendrils.  The tendrils began to roam up and down Toby&#39;s body, and as they did he felt filled with a strange energy.  It was...pleasurable.  He tried to resist it, but he felt himself starting to get hard.  The alien noticed the growing bulge in his pants, and seemed to piece together the concept of clothing at the same time, and in moments its claws had torn away his clothing.  He tried to stop it but the alien was a thousand times stronger and its tendrils held him still, so soon his cock was bouncing free.<br />
<br />
Then he heard a buzzing in his head, and the alien spoke again.  &quot;Dal&#39;muurth, durn...male?  you...male?&quot;   Toby clutched at his head.  Was the alien reading his mind to learn English?  Yes, somehow he knew that it was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...yes.  I&#39;m male.&quot;<br />
<br />
The alien grunted unhappily.  &quot;No.  No male.  You female. Do glornash.  Toby female.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh no, I&#39;m definitely male.  Toby male.&quot; said Toby, but then the creature roared in his face, dripping drool from it&#39;s teeth and onto Toby&#39;s naked flesh.  With the mental link growing stronger by the second, Toby knew the creature had almost decided to kill and eat him right then and there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok ok!  Whatever you say.  Toby is female.&quot;  He knew he had no choice but to placate the creature, even if it was apparently stupid enough to think it could change the obvious reality of his sex just by getting angry about it.<br />
<br />
The alien growled, sensing Toby&#39;s lack of sincerity, but then it smiled a terrible smile.   &quot;Glornash female.&quot; it said.  Toby opened his mouth to speak, but the words never left his lips before the creature suddenly vomited a great deluge of dark purple fluid from its mouth, soaking Toby from head to toe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fucking hell!!!&quot; Shouted Toby.  He started to wipe the substance from his eyes, but then his hand went limp.  The rest of his body followed suit and he found himself lying limp on the grass.  He tried to speak, to do anything at all, but he couldn&#39;t.  Then the purple liquid began to congeal around his body, becoming thicker and tighter on him.  Soon it was almost as if he was wearing a glistening, slimy, purple latex suit that clung tightly to every nook and crevice and allowed his still erect cock to remain lewdly pointing into the air.  If anything, it was harder than ever, for despite his fear the pleasurable energy had been growing and growing ever since he was soaked.<br />
<br />
Then, to his shock, he head a voice in his head!  It spoke absolutely flawless English, yet seemed to have no clear gender tones at all.  *Hello,* it said.  *I am LiEn Or&#39;thall the third, spawn of the great king LiEn Or&#39;thall the second, who you see before you.  It is a great honor, you have been chosen to bond with me and become his heir.*  The buzzing returned in his head.<br />
<br />
Somehow Toby knew, the purple gunk, it was alive and speaking to him telepathically!   *What?  No, please, won&#39;t you just leave me alone?* thought Toby.<br />
<br />
*No.  The Gleeran Empire must expand.  There would be no profit for us in leaving you alone at all.  Understand, I am able to read your mind, but I can barely comprehend this human concept of compassion for all living things.  What you want is really of no concern to us.  But, rejoice, you will bond with me, and then we will be Gleeran together, and if compassion for other living things may improve the Empire then we may bring it to the Empire together.  If it does not improve the Empire it will of course be discarded.*<br />
<br />
Now Toby cursed and screamed in his mind.  *No!  I won&#39;t become one of you!*<br />
<br />
*Again, you don&#39;t have any input on the matter.  But I can assure you, human, that it will be glorious.  Being Gleeran is a thousand times more wonderful than you can fathom, more even than I can fathom as an unbonded Gleer.  I will wait no longer for it.*  The buzzing in Toby&#39;s head grew louder, and he began to feel the alien pour into his mind, at the same time that it&#39;s physical form began to pour in through his every orifice, down his throat and up his ass and even into the head of his penis.  He resisted, but their minds grew closer and closer.  He realized his thoughts were changing, but so were the alien&#39;s.  From him it was learning human emotions, but it took them in, altered them to serve the Empire, and fed them back to him.  The emotions he was getting back though...they were incredible!  Confidence, power!  He began to feel like he could take on the world.<br />
<br />
*Not just this world, dear one.  ALL worlds.*  The alien&#39;s voice in his head sounded less like telepathic communication and more like just another of his own thoughts now, but it spoke also with affection, something it had learned from him.  He felt actual love from his new symbiote.  Maybe this wouldn&#39;t be so bad...<br />
<br />
*Wait a moment though,* came LiEn&#39;s thoughts, *what was father saying just now?*  The minotaur-like alien, LiEn the second, had indeed spoken again, the same words that he&#39;d spoken before vomiting his offspring onto Toby: Glornash female.<br />
<br />
*Oh...I see.* thought LiEn the third. *I...know now how this will displease you, and I am sorry, but father desires that our union be female.  I must alter our body accordingly.*<br />
<br />
*No!* Thought Toby, and now his resistance was renewed with vigor. *You can&#39;t!  I&#39;m a man!  I can&#39;t be a woman!&quot;  He tried to kick and scream, but his body still could not move.<br />
<br />
*I am truly sorry,* thought LiEn, *But we must obey our father and King.  Please try not to resist, and I can assure you the process will be pleasurable.*<br />
<br />
Toby tried to fight, but as the buzzing in his ears rang all the louder, LiEn invaded his mind further.  *Oh...my* LiEn&#39;s thoughts sounded in Toby&#39;s head again, but now they had a distinctly feminine tone to them as the alien took on gender.  *Human sexuality is...quite fascinating.  Intricate, passionate...exciting!*  Then his eyes moved, not by his accord but by LiEn the third&#39;s, and they roamed up and down the monstrous yet muscled form of LiEn the second, and Toby realized that their merging minds found their sire&#39;s body quite attractive, and his eyes stopped to stare at the great bull-like cock swinging between his legs, which he noticed was beginning to swell.  *Oh...oh my indeed.* thought LiEn, *Father is magnificient!  and I believe he wants to mate!  Oh we absolutely MUST speed up this transformation*  <br />
<br />
*Noooo* thought Toby, but he couldn&#39;t deny the lust he was beginning to feel for this alien who he was struggling not to think of as his father. Worse yet, he felt a pleasured tingling in his body, and he knew it was starting to change, sculpted muscle giving way to fat, which shifted and reshaped itself around his body.  Soon his once powerful limbs were small and dainty, and his ass by contrast was beginning to grow and become curvy.  He couldn&#39;t see his own face, but he knew it was becoming beautiful beyond compare as LiEn searched his thoughts for images of all the sexiest women he&#39;d ever known to use as reference in crafting him into the ultimate sex machine.  A gasp and a moan escaped his lips as his hips widened and he wasn&#39;t sure if it had come from LiEn or from him.  Then the tingling centered on his chest, and he knew what was next.  Part of him dreaded it, but the pleasure was too great, as as LiEn moved his hands to massage his nipples he offered no resistance.  He teased his nipples, and watched them respond by erecting in a way they&#39;d never been capable of before.  He watched in a horror that became blind pleasure lust as fat began to build up under his nipples.  As his breasts budded and blossomed pleasure radiated out from them through his entire body, the pleasure growing greater with every ounce of breast tissue he gained, and soon in spite of himself he was willing them to grow larger and larger.<br />
<br />
*Yeeeees* cried LiEn in his head.  *Grow them big for father!*  <br />
<br />
Indeed, Toby was struggling not to see the alien before him as his father, so much had he lost of the mental battle when overwhelmed by pleasure.  He could sense now the paternal protectiveness with which the other alien watched his transformation, could smell the alien pheromones and empathically sense loving emotions.  Father cared.  Father would protect them.<br />
<br />
*No...* thought Toby, an act of dwindling defiance.  *I won&#39;t...call him Father.* He knew resistance wouldn&#39;t be anything but futile for much longer though.  He even noticed his own mental voice sounded different, almost female.<br />
<br />
*You&#39;re right,* came the giggling voice of LiEN, *&quot;Father&quot; is so boring and distant a term.  How about...&quot;Daddy&quot;?*<br />
<br />
Toby tried to protest, but then he felt a pleasure that dwarfed anything that had come before, and noticed his hand had moved down to his throbbing cock.  LiEn gave it a hard squeeze that ought to have been agonizing but instead only filled him with more pleasure, and then she began to push, forcing it back up inside of him!  It felt soooooo good, and Daddy&#39;s cock was rising as he watched!<br />
<br />
But suddenly, something clicked, and he could control his body again!  He tore his hand away from his crotch and was relieved to see his dick spring back to full size.<br />
<br />
*No!* said LiEn, *We have to finish it!  We must complete the glornash, the transformation and union!*<br />
<br />
Hell no.  Toby might already be changed enough to feel rather feminine and to have strange feelings of family bond towards the other alien, but he/she was still Toby for now, still wanted to be human, wanted to turn back if possible. He had family he had to save from this Gleeran empire.  He knew that would change if he lost his dick, that he&#39;d be just another Gleeran soldier.  He had to fight.  <br />
<br />
LiEn the second was looming over him, dick erect now and looking impatient.  Toby gathered all of his strength, and brought his knee into the other alien&#39;s groin full force.</p>
