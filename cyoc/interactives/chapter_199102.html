<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You look to the age gauge on the screen and wondered what age he could be to take a picture.  But then the thought came to mind going all the way back sixteen years, giving that you are fifteen, the thought of going back before you were born interests you.  After all, this is just a photo booth and it wouldn’t really regress you all the way back to the womb.  So with interest, you quickly hit the number ’16’ just to see what this photo booth can do.  As you clicked on enter, four more options appeared, all four had the strangest questions.  They include ‘Clothes Change’, ‘Mental Change’, ‘Awareness’, and ‘Alter Reality’.  You look at them and were curious what they meant.  But of course, you need to continue, as you need to see what the age option of the photo booth can do.  You selected yes for Clothes Change, yes for Mental Change, no for Awareness, and yes for Alter Reality.  You have no clue what they all meant, but it would still be fun to see yourself younger.  Once you clicked okay, a message appeared on the screen that says,<br />
<br />
‘Please sit perfectly still and only keep your eyes on the screen.  It will begin momentarily.’<br />
<br />
Hearing this, you sit tight and looked right at the screen.  The message soon disappeared and you see your entire body on the screen.  You were wearing a light gray T-Shirt with a skateboard design with blue jeans that are ripped at the knees and sneakers and your hair was gelled up with spikes at the tips.  You pretty much like to be a bad boy and you have started to work out with young teen like muscles on your arms.  Still, it would be funny how he would look like when past sixteen years of age.  Just then, a number counter appearing on the right with the number ‘16’ on it and the title ‘pictures’ below it.  You looked at it and wondered what it was.  But then there was a countdown of 3 and a message in the middle that says, ‘Smile!’.  Quickly, you smiled as the timer countdown to one.<br />
<br />
*Flash*<br />
<br />
The light blinded you for a moment and you couldn’t see much.  When the light faded and you rubbed the dots all over your eyes, you looked at the screen and something was different.  Your clothes seem to have changed as you have a black shirt with a skull and cross bones design to it, cargo shorts that expose your lower legs, and Nike shoes.  Your arms looked thin, as the muscles seem to dwindle a bit.  Your face was a bit puffy on the cheeks, as his smile had braces on them.  And his hair was short and a tad shaggy.  In fact, you almost looked like you are now fourteen years old.  But you are fourteen, right?  What you didn’t know is that the flash caused your body and mind to regress by a year as the counter was down to 15.  Almost immediately, the countdown appeared and the message to smile.  Without a second though, you smiled and the timer went down to zero.<br />
<br />
*Flash*<br />
<br />
You got blinded by the light again and waited until the spots disappeared.  Looking at the screen, you are now thirteen and starting puberty as the counter was down to fourteen.  Your clothes now consist of a black shirt with an Autobot insignia, regular blue jeans, and a pair of custom sneakers with the same Autobot logos.  You had very little muscle definition on you, as your arms were thin as twigs.  Your cheeks now were that of a chipmunk and your eyes was looking bigger and innocent like.  Even your hair was extremely shaggy and you neglect going to the hair salon at this age.  You stare at the screen and wondered what you were doing; giving that another year of memories was wiped from your mind.  But suddenly, the message appeared again and the countdown restarted.  You smiled as the booth took the third picture.<br />
<br />
*Flash*<br />
<br />
You got blinded the third time and was rubbing spots from your eyes, when you looked back and you went down one more year, making you twelve.  This time, you were wearing a red Power Rangers T with jaded jeans and custom designed Power Ranger sneakers.  Apparently, you were going through yearly phases of properties you grew up with.  But this time, you were going backwards in properties as well as your body.  You have no more muscles left on your body and you were extremely skinny.  In fact, underneath your shirt, you would’ve had ribs sticking out of your chest.  You face had some serious dimples as the cheeks make you look like that of a chipmunk and your eyes were bigger then before.  You shaggy hair soon shrank back and was now a buzz cut, so much so, that Power Rangers carp appeared on your head and covered it up.  You were starting to have some trouble figuring out what is happening or how you wound up in this strange photo booth.  But as soon as you were thinking about that, the message appeared to tell you to smile and the countdown came up to 3 with only thirteen photos left.  Instinctively, you smiled as your teeth were getting crooked underneath the braces.<br />
<br />
*Flash*<br />
<br />
Once the fourth flash happened, you rub the brightness of your eyes and looked yourself on the screen.  Already, you are eleven and were at the start of your preteen phase.  This time wearing your Marvel shirt with all the marvel heroes on it, another pair of shorts, and Iron Man sneakers, your body remained the same, but you experiences what would appear to be growth spurt in reverse as you descended three to four inches.  With your face and eyes the same, you could feel the braces disappearing in your mouth, leaving behind a lot of crooked teeth in your mouth.  Plus, your cap disappeared and your hair was a normal short cut that’s designed into a parting pattern.  Looking on, you keep getting more confused as each flash went on.  But again, you see the smile and countdown and immediately did what the booth did.<br />
<br />
*Flash*<br />
<br />
When you were temporarily blinded, you have now re-entered ten years of age with eleven pictures left.  You soon got into another shrunk spurt as you went down another three inches, getting closer to your four-foot range.  You now have on a Looney Tunes shirt with Bugs on one end and Daffy on the other, smaller kid jeans, and a pair of Loony Tunes logo sneakers on your smaller feet.  Your face soon started to look more kiddish with puffy cheeks and bigger eyes.  But you soon notice and smudge of freckles popping up on the bridge of your small and stout nose.  Plus your hair rearranged in a bob cut and covered up his head nicely.  You start to feel more discomfort in your mouth as this time, your wisdom teeth appeared at the ends of your gums.  It was obvious that you had them removed when you were eleven.  But you’re not eleven, are you.  You were ten, at the cusp of being a teenager.  How can you be eleven if you still have your wisdom teeth?  The continuous regression of your body and mind is making things foggy for you.  Before you can even think something wasn’t right, the smile message and countdown appeared yet again and you went back to making a happy face to the screen.<br />
<br />
*Flash*<br />
<br />
When the flash is over with, you left the double digits of your life and entered the single digits, making you nine.  Rubbing the spots with your elbows, you looked to see yourself as nine-years-old and have now hit below four feet.  Sporting a Tom & Jerry shirt with the iconic logo, kid blue jeans, and normal Nikes, you started to gain little fat on your arms and legs with a small belly popping out at the bottom hem of your shirt.  It was obvious that you were a stout kid before loosing it all when you were ten, but that was impossible since you were nine.  You face has more freckles coming up your forehead and it sprinkles on top.  Your hair started to have a Justin Bieber look with a cowlick covering your eye.  Brushing the hair away from your face, your confusion started to turn into fear and you have no idea what’s really going on.  But that didn’t matter as the countdown and message appeared again and you smile, hoping that it would be over.<br />
<br />
*Flash*<br />
<br />
With the flash gone, you have now entered eight with only nine pictures left.  With your body shrinking mid three feet, your perception changed as the screen was lowered in your view.  You could see that you have a bit more fat on your arms and legs as you tummy petrud outwards, leaving your Dragon Ball Z shirt sticking out at the bottom hem and tightening your childish cargo shorts.  Your legs retracted upwards off the floor and out of childish instinct, kicked your legs left and right with your sketcher sneakers fitting snug on you.  Your face was still that of a kid as the freckles continued to spread across your forehead.  Your hair was ruffled around and has another type of bob cut with the ends around your neck.  You look around and were getting scared.  You don’t know where your mom and dad were and don’t know how you got into this strange booth.  Of course, the booth regresses you continuously as the smile and countdown appeared once again.  Seeing that message, you tried to get a good angle as you lift yourself up with your arms and smiled with your crooked teeth.<br />
<br />
*Flash*<br />
<br />
You turned into a seven year old with eight pictures left in the booth.  You could see that you are having trouble adjusting to the flash and you don’t know when this will end.  With your sight back to normal, you looked at the screen was could see you were around three feet and was a bit more fat on your arms and legs.  Your stomach was sticking out more with the bottom of your blue DC comic shirt riding upwards and your smaller pants on the verge of popping.  Your legs got shorter with you kicking the backs of your Batman sneakers to the seat.  Your face gained more freckles as they were going around your eyes.  And your hair was starting to gain a bit of curls, an awkward time during your childhood.  You soon felt something off in your mouth and opened your lips up to see what it is.  Turns out, you have two of your adult teeth removed from your mouth.  As soon as you opened your mouth, the message to smile and the countdown appeared and you force your smile since you opened your mouth.<br />
<br />
*Flash*<br />
<br />
The light is making your eyes very sensitive and you have to rub them with both hands.  Getting you sight back, you see that you went down to six with only seven pictures left in the booth.  Below three feet, you were having a hard time seeing yourself.  Bolting up, you see that you were leaving toddler hood at that age, but was still a kid.  You could feel yourself getting weaker as your arms and legs were shorter and you hands and feet were getting littler.  You could feel them getting fatter and making your strength limited.  Your clothes now consist of a red Bob the Builder with Bob himself in the fronts, a pair of shorts, and Bob the Builder custom shoes.  Your face was getting more childish and with his cheeks puffy and freckles going down your cheeks and your eyes getting too big to make you innocent.  Even the hair was messy with a few curly strands sticking out.  The younger you get, the harder it was for you to remember how you got in the booth.  But it didn’t matter, as the smile message appeared, counting down to three once more.  You showed a childish smile, as there was more adult teeth missing, making it look like a crossword puzzle.<br />
<br />
*Flash*<br />
<br />
With the flash gone and spots in your eyes, you have entered back to five years of age and was slowly descending down toddler hood.  You were two and a half feet tall with your arms and legs looking short and stubby.  But not only are you gaining normal fat, but baby fat started to appear on your body.  Even your stomach was bloated with both pieces of fat and was started to show underneath your Blue’s Clue shirt and childish jeans.  Your sneakers were immediately replaced with child like sandals as your smaller feet were exposed.  Your face was starting enter the threshold of toddler hood with your face rounding and riddled with baby fat and freckles.  His sight was completely covered by a mop of curly hair, making it impossible to see.  However, he could see the screen showing the smile message smiled brightly, which now has a mixture of adult and baby teeth with two fronts missing.<br />
<br />
*Flash*<br />
<br />
With five more pictures left, you have now entered four years of your life.  You are smaller and fatter making it impossible to see the screen at your height.  Wearing your Care Bears T, Toddler shorts, and tiny ankle socks, your shorter legs went past the edge and you were sitting with your legs drawing in.  With puffy cheeks, a face filled with freckles, shorter and stout nose, and shorter curly hair, your childish behavior kicked in and you waved your arms and kicked your legs, completely filled with energy.  You couldn’t see the screen’s message and countdown, but you were smiling with your mouth completely filled with baby teeth.<br />
<br />
*Flash*<br />
<br />
You have now become a three-year-old toddler and is much shorter then before, impossible to see the screen.  But it didn’t matter now as you were flailing around, observing the world around you.  You’re body was pudgy and riddled with baby fat with his stomach round along with your face.  You were wearing a yellow Sesame Street shirt and toddler pants with the anklet socks still the same.  But you can feel a crinkling underneath your pants as you moved around in your sitting stance.  It is obvious that you were wearing training pants as it was around the time you had bathroom trouble.  Your face was looking more and more babyish as your face was completely round and was riddled with baby fat and freckles.  Your hair was extremely curly as it shrunk up your skull and nestled around your head.  You observed the world around you as you were engaged by the screen that was lit up in front of you.  Even if the message tells you to smile and countdown commences, you still smile as some of your baby teeth shrink up your gums, leaving you with another crossword puzzle.<br />
<br />
*Flash*<br />
<br />
Once the flashing was over, you became a two-year-old toddler without a care in the world.  Wearing only a baby T and training pants, you kicked your bare feet around on the seat and reached your pudgy baby arms at it.  The rest of your body was nothing by baby fat as the lean teenage physic was no more.  Your face was filled with puffy cheeks, freckles, and innocent huge eyes with your hair was short thin curls adorning your head.  Your mind was nearly blank, as you have no clue where you are, how you got there, and what happened to your mom and dad.  But it didn’t matter as you were starring at the screen when it told you to smile and counting down.  Even if you can’t understand, you just laugh a baby laugh showing only your front baby teeth.<br />
<br />
*Flash*<br />
<br />
Two more pictures left, as you are nothing more then a one-year-old infant.  Your body short and fat as you wore just a diaper.  Your face, pudgy and cute with freckles, huge eyes, and shorter curly hair.  You were having a hard time sitting up, as your ability to walk and talk was miniscule.  You soon were laughing a baby laugh as you have all of your baby teeth gone and have nothing but bare guns.  You got so energetic; you barely notice the message and countdown on the screen.<br />
<br />
*Flash*<br />
<br />
Now, on the seat, you have become nothing more then a newborn wearing nothing more but a blue blanket and a blue cap over your head.  Even if you didn’t show it, you were extremely pudgy and red and your hair was just wisps of curly hair.  The one thing that was covered is that fact that your belly button was sore as something wormed out of it and has a clip that appeared.  Turns out, it was a recently cut umbilical cord as if you were just born.  And you were indeed just born, as you appear to be a few days old and started on your path to life.  However, you were just sleeping peacefully as your eyes were closed.  Turns out, your sight cannot get use to the sensitive light in the outside world.  You were resting peacefully, but you didn’t know what would happen next.  Since you set the pictures to sixteen and you were fifteen years old, there is one more picture left to take.  And that’s very concerning.  You have no idea what will happen after the last picture is taken, let alone if you survive it.  All you need to is wait until it’s over and only time will tell what will become of you.  The message to smile appeared and the countdown initiated.  The fate of your life lies in the photo booth’s hands.<br />
