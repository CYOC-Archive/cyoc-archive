<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andrew decided to listen to Tide and made his way to Tide’s bedroom, the dragon kid giving him directions to the room. The house wasn’t big, more of a moderate size, but Andrew still didn’t know his way around, the multiple rooms and hallways confusing him. <br />
<br />
As Andrew arrived at Tide’s bedroom he entered to see there wasn’t much, only a place to sleep and a few belonging on a small table in the corner of the room. Andrew walked over to the bed and realized how different it looked from his own, the bed base made of stone, an animal-skin mattress full of something resembling cotton and foliage lying on top. No pillows or blankets to be found on its surface.<br />
<br />
“This is my bed?!”<br />
<br />
“This is OUR bed,” Tide corrected. “Try to refer to my belongings with possessive adjectives, alright? Besides, what’s wrong with it?”<br />
<br />
“I dunno. It just looks kinda…” Andrew tried to find the most polite word to describe it. “Old.” <br />
<br />
Regardless of what he said, Andrew still laid on the bed (making sure to tuck his wings in as he fell on to his back), finding it surprisingly comfortable. “So are we just gonna wait here til your dad comes home? Because that sounds extremely dull.”<br />
<br />
“Trust me, it is.” Tide admitted. “But I don’t want to make Dad angrier than he already is. So for now, can you just wait?”<br />
<br />
“Fine.”<br />
<br />
Andrew placed his arms under his head, creating a makeshift pillow, as he waited impatiently. After a nap and plenty of daydreaming, Andrew was still bored, growing more restless as each second passed.<br />
<br />
Andrew eventually sat up, believing he’s laid long enough, and scans the room to look for something interesting. As expected, nothing intriguing could be spotted. “Figures. I use a portal to end up in a world of anthro dragons and I can’t even explore it,” Andrew complained, his tail beginning to whip the base of the bed as he became angry.<br />
<br />
“Oh, right! I have a tail now!” Andrew took notice of the blue appendage and grabbed it in his claws, surprised at its durability and weight, before he realized something. “Wait a second… I’m a dragon!”<br />
<br />
Perhaps there was something Andrew could explore after all.<br />
<br />
Andrew laid back on the bed and rubbed his claws over his body, feeling the texture of the scales on his new body. They felt hard and sturdy, a proper protection for his new self. As Andrew continued to caress his new body, he found it interesting to explore himself, observing all the differences his dragon form had from his human one. There were no nipples on his chest nor a belly button on his thin stomach, clear indicators that he was no longer human. However, Andrew took the greatest interest in a difference further below.<br />
<br />
Andrew viewed his sheath, noting it was the greatest contrast from his old body, and hesitantly brought his claws closer to it. Slowly but steadily he inserted a finger into his slit, feeling the warm and wet enclosure pulling him in. What followed could only be described as a fingering of some sort as Andrew messed around with his new body part, inserting more fingers into his slit and feeling the new pleasurable sensations it brought him.<br />
<br />
“Wh-what are you doing?” Tide asked him, obviously too young to know what Andrew was doing.<br />
<br />
“Just having some fun,” Andrew replied cheekily as he shoved his fingers further into his slit and pulled out his two cocks. They were a shade of dark blue that matched his new body and were incredibly small. But from Andrew’s perspective they looked average. He made sure to slowly wrap a claw around each one, preparing himself for the fun he was about to have.<br />
<br />
“Why are you taking them out? We don’t have to use the bathroom.”<br />
<br />
Andrew just stayed silent, becoming more horny as he realized that Tide had no concept of what he was about to do. Instantly, Andrew began to thrust his waist forward, stroking both his cocks simultaneously as he started to rapidly masturbating. His dicks were too young to properly produce pre but they still reacted, stiffening as he quickly jerked off.<br />
<br />
By now Tide didn’t ask any more questions, overwhelmed with the same pleasure Andrew felt as he masturbated, bringing them closer to edging. Eventually Andrew lets go, his dicks shaking as they produced a dry orgasm. Usually, one would be disappointed to find they were no longer able to properly cum. However, to Andrew it felt even better than his usual release, both cocks creating a greater sense of gratification as they multiplied the effect of the orgasm’s pleasure. Even greater when Andrew realized it was his body’s first masturbation, his inexperienced body adding to the stimulation.<br />
<br />
Andrew stretched his body and panted, feeling satisfied beyond relief as his cocks finished orgasming. He had finally found a way to entertain himself. Yawning, Andrew began to grow tired, his young body tuckered out from his actions. Within seconds, Andrew drifted off to sleep, his dicks falling back into his sheath as he began snoring.</p>
