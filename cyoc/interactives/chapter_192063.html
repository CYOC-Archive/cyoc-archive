<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>changing the spectate to being the main character and what he thinks and feels,</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You looked at the mirror and could not believe it, there was a boy there, where you should be, he looked to be about 9 or he could be younger or older, he had long thick hair going down just hitting his back, an cute face with perfect skin, and a button nose, bigger than normal lips but not to big mostly perfect for his now small face, you then look at the boy&#39;s body seeing a humongous shirt hanging on the boy&#39;s body knowing that it is your body right now feeling it, you then realize your new young body does not have any trousers, underwear and shoes on feeling a breeze on your legs blowing up to your new crotch what was the last thing i wanted to think about, looking back you see the clothes what have falling off and you must of not realized being in shock being turned in to a boy. <br />
<br />
Looking back at the mirror not being able to look away from the very cute boy you have become, he looked like a perfect boy, perfect skin, perfect face and body and perfect hair, you where an tween heart throb, and said “che cazzo” (what the fuck in Italian) <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Ted spoke up at last and said “what the fuck indeed Damien” to you, and he charred on speaking in Italian now “it seems like you have gotten Luca’s muscle memory with his body, not being able to speak English very Easly and having to think about it” Damien looked up at him and said “Luca?” he just looked down at you and  laughed to himself and said “yes It probably would of been easier to of told you who you are and why before I transformed you, well you are right now Loca Russo, Hebrew Russo’s son and well Hebrew is very paranoid man and very good at finding people who should not be there, he doesn&#39;t trust anyone Damien, the only people who he trust’s is people who he loves and for what we can find out he only loves his family, and well that is where this comes in(pointed at you) you are now Loca, Hebrews son, well his twin kind off, your job it to become close to him and get in to his secure lab what is somewhere on his grounds where he lives with his family and retrieve a sample of a virus he is making”. <br />
<br />
I looked back at the mirror seeing the overly cut boy looking back at me with his skinny week looking body and orange tanned skin, and thought sour I&#39;m cute and young now, but I don’t want this I was a 45 year old guy 5 minuets ago what could kill a guy in 50 different ways, but looking at this kid and feeling how week he is I probably couldn&#39;t shoot a gun now, and looked at Ted feeling anger coming over me and shouted “I DID NOT WANT THIS TURN ME BACK NOW BEFORE I DO SOMTHING YOU WILL REGRET, I AM THE BEST AGENT IN MI5 AND YOU JUST TURND ME IN TO THISWEAK LOOKING KID!!!” Ted just looked down at me, making me feel how week I feel now and weak I actually I am now feeling that I could not EVEN lift my own body weight and he was now twice as high as me now. <br />
<br />
Ted just sighed at me and started to say “ok Smith, first of all you agreed to this mission back in the briefing room, so you are stuck as you are now, anyway it will take a day or two to get you DNA ready to turn you back, but maybe telling you about your new body might help you,  <br />
<br />
well you are now Luca Russo 9 and a half years old, born in 2013 on April the 2ed, your dad is now Hebrew Russo’s CEO of Russo’s chemicals and your mom is Sofia Russo, you are going to the boarding school St. Stephens School in Rome, and are doing very well there, you do get into trouble getting into fights every week but your dad pays lats of money into the school so it could just be that what keeps you there, we know that you are a mommy&#39;s boy always being seen with her out and about even an ex-house maid said the you are uncomfortably close to her cuddling up to her every night, secondly we are going to swap you out when the real Luca is on his way back home in his limo, we have played the driver off to stop at a Pacific spot and we will swap you then, that will be in a month time when summer break starts, thirdly and finally you are going to spend the next month learning to be Luca, the muscle memory of Luca’s body will take care of hobbies and make your personality more like his, as well as dislikes and likes like what games he likes and food, stuff like that, what you need to learn is who are your friends now and how you met them  and Luca’s past and his ambitions for the future,  <br />
<br />
and I am sorry Damien, but order are order and I can’t turn you back without them, and I have been ordered to give you these clothes (Ted pulls a set of boys clothes from a draw nearby) and once you are dressed this security guard will lead you to your new place of operations what will be a place where you will learn everything you need to know and in a months&#39; time you will be ready to go and replace the real Luca”  <br />
<br />
and he stopped talking, well this is ball I guess I have no choice in the matter but this fucking suck, I hate this idea, I hate this body even more, I feel so lite and week and helpless, but I decided to just say “fine, I guess I have no chose any way, gezz” and I realized two things, one I just had all of this conversation in Italian without even realizing, and how much I sound like a child now. <br />
<br />
I grabbed the clothes from Ted and put them on the chair what I was nearby, and looked in the mirror again and sighed seeing the new me, and I started to un button my shirt what was way to big for me now, the t-shirt fell to the ground I stood there naked looking at my now small body from my nipples what was now smaller and a much darker colour and my now small dick what was so much smaller, than what I was use to, but it was not terrible for such a small body, I knew there was no point in giving a shit, and I didn&#39;t want to get it excited knowing this body it&#39;s just about to or already started puberty being 9 years old, and knowing that I am stuck with it and looked at the small muscles I have now, there are not even 10% of what I had in my old body, shore they were showable but so tight and small I could see I still have apps and a 6 pack, but they were more for being a runner than a fighter with them staying small and light, I looked at my ass seeing in the mirror that it stuck out a bit not knowing if it was big of is it because I was now very fin. <br />
<br />
I then suddenly realized I have been exploring my new body for 5 minuets and doing it naked, luckily it seems like Ted went back to doing what he was doing before this, and nobody else was looking at me, I started to feel self-conscience straight away realise this, and cover my now small dick and balls with one hand finding some boxer briefs on top of the pile with the other, and got them on fast, then I found some shorts what I pulled on quickly what turned out to be quite tight and not very long with them only going half way to my knee, but where surprisingly comfy and where white, then the last of the two things was a tank-top what was light red what I slid on easily what was a bit baggy what felt silky and smooth against my skin, and finely some expensive looking sandals what I stepped in to and did up. <br />
<br />
I looked back up seeing this kids I guess my body now looking very good, for a kid, with these shorts being short and tight showing of healthy smooth leges and the tank-top what was perfectly baggy and what showed how skinny and again healthy he/i am now, I looked up at my face and seeing a smiling boy, not even realizing that I felt some excitement seeing my new body in such nice and expensive looking clothes what went very well with this body, but then I remembered that I am now stuck in this body for the next month and who knows how long, and felt the anger and annoyance come back in to my now small stomach, and felt a hand grab mine and it was the guard saying “time to go Luca” pulling me outside and into the back a car.</p>
