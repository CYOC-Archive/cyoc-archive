<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Patrick, Marcus, Angus,” Dan commanded his pups to attention.  “I’m going to finish shopping here, please wait for me at home, understood?”<br />
<br />
Dan’s pups shared a pained whimper, not wanting to leave their Master’s side even for a moment...but, begrudgingly, they nodded together, <br />
kissed Dan’s feet goodbye, and waddled off to the parking lot.<br />
<br />
Dan wanted to explore this world a bit more...but he needed a break after that intense session in the tattoo parlor.  “Geeze...”  He gawked, <br />
taking in the expansive mall.  Droves of hulking muscle daddies, groups of powerlifters, packs of offseason bodybuilders waddling from store <br />
to store.  It was breathtaking.  Dan kept catching guys gawking and checking him out...reminding him that he had made himself irresistible to <br />
the men of this world.<br />
<br />
“Victor’s Secret?”  Dan chuckled, stopping before what was Victoria’s Secret in the old world.  Posters of handsome, massively muscled <br />
powerlifters wearing jockstraps that could barely contain their massive endowments hung from the ceiling.  <br />
<br />
A thickly muscled redhead squeezed out of the entrance from Victor’s Secret.  Dan’s heart stopped...he was stunningly handsome.  All his <br />
features exaggerated and hyper masculine.  A thick brow, stunning blue eyes, a broad masculine nose...his burly face eclipsed by a massive <br />
bull neck.<br />
<br />
Shirtless, dan guessed this redheaded beast was at least 10-feet tall, and just as wide.  He was wearing a jockstrap to match the window <br />
display, and his name tag, attached to his nipple piercing.  <br />
<br />
“Jack,” Dan read the name aloud, admiring this beast.  Jack turned suddenly, tucking his cellphone back into his jockstrap.  He was so <br />
handsome, so massive, and...so hung.  Dan had to have him.<br />
<br />
“Down here, Jack.”  Dan commanded.  Jack’s natural submissive nature suddenly taking over.<br />
<br />
“I’m on my break, S-sir...but how can I--” Jack trailed off as he made eye contact with Dan, falling to his knees suddenly.  “--How can I help <br />
you, Sir?”  Jack whimpered, looking down suddenly.  Dan grinned, watching his effect take hold of this massive bull.  Suddenly at eye-level, Dan <br />
stepped closer...suddenly realizing Jack was already wearing a chain and lock, previously obscured by his massive pecs.<br />
<br />
“I...um...” Dan grumbled, “N-nevermind” suddenly turning away, frustrated, and stormed off to the bathrooms across the hall.  Dan could fix <br />
this.  Dan *would* fix this.  Jack needed to be part of his entourage of massive redheaded bulls...and with the Chronovac, that would be so <br />
easy.<br />
<br />
Safely inside a locked stall, Dan whipped out his portable Chronovac app, trying to pull up Jack’s profile...but to no success.  He couldn’t scan <br />
for targets this far away...  “But, what if...”  Dan pulled up his own profile, tapping into his settings.  When he first changed the world, he made <br />
himself irresistibly attractive to everyone, the longer someone lingered near Dan, the harder they fell for him.  And with unchained redheads, <br />
that meant they fell in love at just the sight of him.<br />
<br />
“Unchained...” Dan rubbed his hardon as he typed a new set of conditions.  He made himself even more attractive, more handsome, and in the <br />
comments section made himself so irresistible, that his effect would overcome even a chained redheads’ loyalty.<br />
<br />
Dan paused as an incredible idea hit him.<br />
<br />
Furiously typing into the Chronovac, Dan gave himself a special ability: his cum would make anyone who drank it grow.  Muscles, gut, balls, <br />
cock, sex drive, fur, height...and it would make them completely submissive to Dan.  The world rippled as Dan hit “Save,” he whipped out his <br />
throbbing cock and jerked it off quickly, moaning as he blasted his load against the stall door.  <br />
<br />
He had to test this new ability...carefully taking a drop from the tip of his cock, Dan licked his finger clean.  “Man, I taste so go--” he <br />
shuddered, his body flexing suddenly as his muscles pumped slightly larger, his gut inched out, “gooood...”  He groaned, feeling his cock swell <br />
slightly larger, his balls pushing bigger with an erotic pain.  Panting, he stood, realizing he was at least an inch taller.  His clothes, already <br />
super tight, rode even higher than before.<br />
<br />
Had he overdone it?  Just a drop made him grow so much...<br />
<br />
“Only one way to find out,” Dan grinned, buckling his cargo shorts as he strode back to confront Jack.<br />
<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
Dan strutted from the bathroom, stopping men in their tracks.  His effect was so much stronger now...he scanned the hall, dozens of massive <br />
powerlifters gawking, a couple on their knees.  He would have to turn this effect down later...this was ridiculous!  <br />
<br />
Pushing past a towering, blond bodybuilder, Dan caught Jack standing out front of the store.  He was passing out flyers for a sale, his <br />
prodigious package and hulking muscles doing all the selling for him.<br />
<br />
“Jack.”  Dan commanded, stepping before the redheaded bull.  A small crowd had gathered behind Dan, watching with intense interest, some <br />
people taking camera phone shots discretely.<br />
<br />
“S-Sir?  We’re holding a sale--” Jack trailed off as he looked down to Dan over his thick pecs.  Jack gulped.  His heart was gripped, his stomach <br />
in knots...his subspace was triggered.  But...only his Master could bring him there?  Jack realized he was on his knees before Dan, whimpering, <br />
eyes welling up with tears...why was this happening?<br />
<br />
“Jack.  Who do you belong to?”  Dan asked, tugging Jack’s carefully trimmed red beard to make strong eye contact.<br />
<br />
“I-I belong...”  Jack stammered, searching his mind for his Master.  But it was as if that information was being blocked.  “I-belong...”. He knew <br />
he had a Master, he had pledged his loyalty to his Master, but somehow he couldn’t remember his face, or what he looked like at all. He had his <br />
collar, surely he belonged to someone.  But the longer he looked into this man’s eyes...the harder it was to remember these details.  He didn’t <br />
even care to remember them, so entranced by this handsome cub.<br />
<br />
He was descending deeper and deeper into his subspace, all he could focus on was the man standing before him. He had such an intoxicating <br />
quality to him. Jack was completely transfixed, never before had he encountered someone that caused this feeling inside of him. The man <br />
before him was the embodiment of physical perfection and the representaion of all of his hopes and dreams. He was completely powerless to <br />
magnetism of the man standing before him.His loyalties to his former Master was being over-written, being replaced with new loyalties. He had <br />
to belong to this man, he had to spend his entire life with him, to serve him. But he didn’t know anything about his Man... how could be be so <br />
transfixed upon this stranger?<br />
<br />
Dan cleared his throat, “My name is Dan, and you belong to me now, pup.” Jack’s eyes went wide, it was so obvious...of course Dan was his <br />
Master.  His face went flush with relief, and he fell deeper, kissing at Dan’s feet, whimpering moans of “Thank you, Master...Thank you.”<br />
<br />
“But, pup,” Dan stopped Jack, tugging on the chain around his neck.  “Where did you get this?  It’s not my chain.”  Jack gulped, perspiring with <br />
building anxiety...what had happened?  Was he a stray?  The foreign chain around his neck felt like it was choking him, it didn’t belong around <br />
his neck.  With a struggle, Jack pushed his massive arms up and winced while he tugged the chain...once, twice...snap!  Small metal chunks <br />
falling to the ground.<br />
<br />
“S-Sorry, Master!”  Jack pleaded, sobbing at Dan’s feet...how had this happened?  He wasn’t worthy of his Master’s affection, love, his chain.  <br />
The crowd had grown, watching this massive beast cower before Dan, murmurs about how they had never seen a redhead relinquish their chain <br />
before.  It was unheard of.<br />
<br />
It was then Jack got a sudden sense of just how naked he was. He knew in his heart that he didn’t deserve the collar, but he knew that the he <br />
must do what he can to demonstrate his worthiness before his new Master. He would never feel truly worthy, but that would make his Master’s <br />
love truly a gift. He was shivering, he needed his Master, every second that he was without his new Master’s collar he felt desperately alone. He <br />
felt stray.<br />
<br />
The massive bull pup knelt down at his new Master’s feet, kissing them repeatedly, whimping, moaning, sobbing. As he tasted Dan’s ankles <br />
Jack was further hit with the addictive hypnotic properties Dan had given himself with the chronovac. “I need you Master. Please Master, <br />
please”. Jack intensified his efforts, he knew that he had to give his new Master everything he had, everything he was... if his new Master didn’t <br />
take him, collar him and rule over him... he would be forever heartbroken, forever searching the world for his Master.<br />
<br />
Jack’s whimpering grew increasingly pained and urgent. Dan himself could feel the vibration of the sound reverberating in the air. A puddle of <br />
tears was pooling at where Jack grovelled.  Someone in the crowd shouted out to Dan that he should “collar the beast, don’t put it through <br />
this.”<br />
<br />
Dan looked upon the ginger bull who was grovelling before him, in Jack’s grovelled position he saw the brand of another Master above his <br />
rump. He watched with curiosity as the ink faded, the skin cells regenerating rapidly. All the marks of his previous ownership, both physical <br />
and mental were disappearing. Within minutes, the brand had completely faded. He was now a blank canvas, ready to be printed upon again.<br />
<br />
Jack started breathing harder, his chest rising up and down. He was panicking, he started to perspire and sweat, the odour heavy and <br />
overpowering to all who watched this spectacle. <br />
<br />
“Pup.”  Dan’s shorts dropped to the ground, Jack’s whimpering hushed momentarily, “Prove yourself, pup.”  With Jack’s head up, Dan’s <br />
throbbing package loomed before his face, a growing, dark spot of pre outlining the head of his thick cock.<br />
<br />
Without hesitation, Jack tugged Dan’s jockstrap down with his teeth, freeing the modest 13” cock.  The crowd gasped, camera phones <br />
recording the spectacle...was this a marketing stunt for Victor’s Secret?  They were so subversive...<br />
<br />
Jack tenderly tasted at his Master’s penis.  Taking a few licks along the shaft, breathing in Dan’s heady musk.  Jack shuddered, his cock hard, <br />
freeing itself...he could feel pre gushing over his leg and pooling at his knees.  Without further hesitation, Jack took Dan’s cock hungrily.  <br />
Moaning as he went down to the base, letting himself gag for a moment.  This was absolute bliss for him.<br />
<br />
He felt the shaft fill him completely, snaking its way down his thick bull neck. This was the cock that he had been born to serve, born to <br />
worship. Jack looked up at his Master looking down upon him, his Master seemed impressed.<br />
<br />
He loved every inch of it, taking in it’s curves, feeling every vain and more and more blood filled it, making it more rigid.<br />
<br />
Everyone who was present watching this display had was leaking precum, many of them with their cocks popping out of their pants, shorts and <br />
jockstraps, rising high up onto their chests, precum leaking all over their torsos. A few were even outright masturbating.  They tweaked their <br />
nipples and rubbed their hands all over themselves. The atmosphere that had grown around them was of pure unadulterated sexuality, Dan’s <br />
hypersexualised magnetism, coupled with Jack’s musk mixed together with one of the most powerful displays of loyalty and submission they <br />
had ever seen.<br />
<br />
Jack’s own cock rose higher and higher as he took his new Master’s cock with more intensity, letting his Master pound his face sending it <br />
deeper and deeper down his throat. Jack’s own cock had come to full attention wedging itself between the valley of his pecs, the precum <br />
sticking the red hair of his skin to his chest.<br />
<br />
As the scene continued, Jack became increasingly less observant of the scene that was growing around him, of the people streaming the event <br />
onto the internet - probably to be picked up by the evening news. <br />
<br />
All he wanted was to get his Master’s cock deeper inside him. He was was struggling to breath but he kept on persevering. Every buck from his <br />
Master was its own reward, every moan that he elicited was a validation of his own being. In this moment, he lived to suck his Master’s cock.<br />
<br />
Dan threw his head back, moaning, “C-close, pup...don’t stop.”  He held tight to Jack’s head, feeling his new, larger balls clench tight.  Dan <br />
grimaced, tensing his body as he felt the orgasm build inside him.  With one more buck of his hips, Dan roared out, cumming hard into Jack’s <br />
waiting maw.  Shot after shot of his seed filled Jack, who hungirly gulped it down, the warmth of his Master’s seed filling his stomach.  Dan <br />
staggered back, his cock bobbing free of Jack’s mouth, a stupid grin on the pup’s face.<br />
<br />
“Good job, pup...and now for your reward.”  Dan smiled, pulling up his jockstrap and cargo shorts.  Jack had returned to his standing at <br />
attention, his massive redhead cock throbbing against his muscle gut, small for his size, Dan guessed it was three-feet long.  But it would be <br />
much bigger in a moment.<br />
<br />
“I don’t deserve anything, M-master,” Jack stammered...his neck felt naked...and his stomach felt warm.  Warmer?  Hot...something was not <br />
right.  He began to sweat as the warmth filled his body, his heart racing,  “M-master?”  Jack shuddered, his body flexing slightly...then pushing <br />
out a few inches.<br />
<br />
“Is he...growing?”  Murmurs of hushed surprise came from the audience as everyone stopped to watch Jack.  Another shudder, he swelled <br />
larger, thicker, his arms getting bigger by the second.  Already a huge 32-inches around, they inched larger with the rest of his body, pushing <br />
his arms out as the muscles swelled and fought for room.  Jack moaned, caught in another spasm...it seemed as though his growth was <br />
accelerating.  His stance widened, feet pushing further apart as his thighs swelled larger.  And between them, his balls churned, dropping a few <br />
inches, then growing outwards, and bigger each second. The jockstrap he was previously wearing snapped, catapulting its way into the face of <br />
one of one of the onlookers His cock had gone soft...but hadn’t shrunk, it fell, flaccid, three feet from his crotch, thickening to 12-inches <br />
across.  And it continued to grow, the thick head squished against the floor as it reeled out longer, thicker, larger.<br />
<br />
All the while, Jack was growing taller.  He had trouble getting into the store at 12-feet tall, but there’s no way he’d fit in now...nearly 16-feet <br />
tall and growing proportionately bigger with each second.  Jack struggled to see his Master, his pecs pushed out so far from his body that all <br />
he could see was his red-fur covered muscles.  “M-Master!”  Jack called out, pained whimpers shaking the walls.<br />
<br />
His transformation was immensely sensual as he felt himself stretch, grow and inflate. A part of him that told him that he should feel scared, <br />
but this seemed to be clouded out by a feeling inside of him  that told him to submit himself to the transformation, this was his future, this <br />
was his destiny. It was what he wanted deep down and what would make his Master proud. <br />
<br />
“Down here, pup.”  Dan said calmly, stepping back in anticipation of Jack falling to his hands and knees...the glass windows shuddering and <br />
cracking behind him with the force of his grown body coming down. He had to have been over 1300lbs of pure heft.<br />
<br />
The crowd standing around them had mixed feelings, they were paralyzed with fear from what was going on before them, but they couldn't <br />
look away. They had never seen anything like this before and probably would never see anything like it.<br />
<br />
Jack’s submissive side was growing with the rest of him, he felt himself sinking deeper and deeper. Not only had the memories of his former <br />
Master been completely erased, but many of his other memories were also becoming inaccessible to him, becoming clouded before <br />
disappearing completely. New pathways were being forged, his new life has his Master’s sub became clearer in his mind, he needed it. Without <br />
his Master’s validation, Jack would simply shrivel up and eventually cease to be entirely.<br />
<br />
Jack tried to kneel down before his Master as deep as he could as he was on his hands and knees he was still at least five feet tall. It was then <br />
that Jack noticed a small drop of cum before his Master. It had obviously dropped out when Master had stuffed his cock back into his jockstrap. <br />
Jack dived upon the small drop, feeling intensely and painfully hungry, he felt like he was starving. Bringing his face down to the tile he licked <br />
the tile with ferocity, he lapped it up making sure that he didn’t miss a single molecule of his Master’s precious seed. He kept on licking until <br />
the tile was polished completely clean and all he could taste was the saltiness of his tears which were falling upon the ground.<br />
<br />
As drop of cum made its way down his throat, it modified his jaw, allowing him to suck upon any cock which was presented in front of him, <br />
elongating his tongue, increasing it’s flexibility. Jack;s hunger only grew more urgent, it stomach grumbled as it grew before him - a perfect <br />
sphere lightly covered with furred with a ginger and blonde hair. Jack found that he he had to to modify his stance in order to accommodate it <br />
as inflated, It itself downwards pushed downwards into the floor, pushing his spine upwards. Jack whimpered loudly as as his belly pushed his <br />
arms to full extension, pulling his hips wide. <br />
<br />
Jack suddenly got a sense of how cold the room was, was there a breeze coming through. He realised that that it’s wasn’t his hold body was <br />
cold, it was just his nipples. They enlarged and elongated in his cannon-ball chest, becoming inhumanly sensitive. He became increasingly <br />
conscious of the feel of the metal rings that were piecing them, which had also grown along with him.  The light touch of a gentle breeze was <br />
enough to keep him stimulated, the a gentle caress could almost bring him to orgasm, a squeeze would be enough to drive him into <br />
submission and beg for mercy.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, he became conscious of something else cold that was bringing shivers down his spine. His balls had grown so massive and heavy <br />
that they now rested upon the cool tiles of the floor, and splayed out between his thighs, lightly moistened by his own sweat and from the <br />
precum that had pooled underneath Jack the entire time. Each ball was three or four feet across in a thick, fleshy sac covered with red fur.  <br />
They inched larger by the second, churning heavily between Jack’s legs.<br />
<br />
“T-Thank you, Master.”  Jack whimpered as his growth started to slow.  He was nearly 25-feet tall now, and insanely built.  Shoulder-to-<br />
shoulder, he was about 18-feet across, and just as thick.  His ball gut stood out from his body a perfect sphere, eclipsing his torso by a foot...it <br />
was so big, you could see his gut from behind.<br />
<br />
“Pup, stand, I have to see you.”  Dan commanded, adjusting his hardon.  Jack struggled to stand, but with some effort and careful maneuvering <br />
he held himself up.  The mall was (thankfully) two stories, with an open hall between floors.  At his full height, pup’s head and shoulders rose <br />
into the second floor, the crowd above him gawking at his incredible size.  Jack whimpered, feeling cool air sweep over his bare neck and <br />
rump...he was unmarked, unchained.  Tears ran down his face...he needed to be claimed by his Master!  It was so unbarably painful...pup’s <br />
pained whimpering rumbled through the mall.<br />
<br />
Dan ran up the escalator to the second floor admiring his new pup.  Still heartbreakingly handsome, only super sized.  His balls rested on the <br />
floor, churning, growing with sexual need, while his cock was so big it rested on his shoulder, a foot past his head.  Pre pouring freely like a <br />
hose that was left on.<br />
<br />
“Pup!  Behind you!”  Dan called out from the second floor, his pup suddenly turning, splashing the audience with copious amounts of pre, he <br />
gripped the handrail smiling bashfully.  <br />
<br />
“Master, I missed you,” Jack tried to say, but only whimpers came out.<br />
<br />
On his way up the escalator, Dan had used the chronovac to create a special, super heavy chain and padlock for his new pup...it was coded to <br />
grow along with Jack, in case he continued to grow once it was locked around his neck.<br />
<br />
“Pup, come closer,” Dan struggled to lift the chain up.  Each stainless steel link was 10-inches wide.  It was a beastly chain fit for his beastly <br />
pup.  With a bit of effort, Dan got it around his pup’s bull neck...the chronovac said it was 70-inches around, nearly as big around as Dan was <br />
tall.  The padlock was easier, but still had the weight and heft of a 100-pound kettlebell.  <br />
<br />
Jack was whimpering tears of joy, mouthing “Thank you, Master” over and over again.  A loud ker-chunk rang through the hall as the padlock <br />
secured the chain around Jack’s neck.  The crowd cheered, obviously moved by Dan’s love for his pup.</p>
