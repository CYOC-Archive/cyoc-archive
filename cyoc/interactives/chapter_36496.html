<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the woman grasped Dru's little hand she remembered the fine print on the card. Only one wish per customer. The second part gave her some hope. Her wish was unsatisfactory and she could file a complaint. The only problem was that she didn't know who to file the complaint with. Even if she found out she would spend three years as a little girl. Of course there has to be some statute of limitation on when you can file a complaint. If she didn't find out with whom<br />
to file the complaint she was sure she would be stuck as a girl.<br />
<br />
The other thing that went through her mind was why the woman had called her her little vixen pup. She clearly hadn't changed species, just her age and gender. In the end she decided that it was an inside joke. In this life she probably likes foxes and plays at being one. Yeah, that had to be it. There was no other explanation she could see. She would find out soon enough what other explanation that there was for the woman calling her her little vixen pup.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Dru, stop dawdling&quot; the woman said. &quot;We need to find your father before we can get lunch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sowwy&quot; Dru said in a lisp. She didn't mean to say it like that but she couldn't help it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just pay attention and hurry up&quot; the woman said.<br />
<br />
Dru didn't understand why this woman was her mother in this life. Why wasn't her mother from her male life her mother now? She was still young enough to have children after all. It was strange that she wasn't part of the same family anymore. She suddenly realized that she didn't know her new last name.<br />
<br />
Suddenly another woman came up and said &quot;Stacy Fox, I haven't seen you since you had your daughter. How are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm fine Jan&quot; Dru's mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And this must be Dru&quot; Jan said. &quot;How are you doing sweetie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Otay&quot; Dru said. At least she now knew her last name and why her mother had called her her little vixen pup. Or so she thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen Jan, I hate to brush you off like this but we need to find Jeremy&quot; Dru's mother said. &quot;We don't have much time for lunch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I understand&quot; Jan said. &quot;Perhaps we can get together tonight. You're still living in that house in the country aren't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes we are&quot; Dru's mother answered. &quot;But I'm afraid that we already have plans for tonight. How about Saturday night?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That will be fine&quot; Jan said. &quot;I hope you have fun with your plans tonight.&quot; She said this last with a little wink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh we will&quot; Dru's mother said. &quot;We'll see you Saturday night then.&quot;<br />
<br />
They took their leave of Jan and continued looking for Dru's father. They finally found him in a sports store looking at a stuffed fox.<br />
<br />
Dru's mother got a sad look on her face as she also looked at the stuffed fox. &quot;That's simply barbaric&quot; she said with contempt in her voice.<br />
<br />
Dru wondered why they looked so sad but then figured that they were animal rights activists.<br />
<br />
&quot;Such a waste&quot; Dru's father said. &quot;It would be different if people hunted them for food. I can't stand what people call sport.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down hun&quot; Dru's mother said. &quot;We don't need to make a scene.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps we should make a scene&quot; Dru's father said. &quot;Maybe that will wake people up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know we can't make a scene&quot; Dru's mother said. &quot;Think about Dru. We can't leave her to the world as young as she is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dru's father breathed a heavy sigh as he looked at Dru. &quot;I know&quot; he said. &quot;This just makes me so mad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know it does hun&quot; Dru's mother said. &quot;Let's go get some lunch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright&quot; Dru's father said as he turned away. &quot;Let's get some lunch.&quot;<br />
<br />
They ate lunch in the food court at Taco Johns. This confused Dru as she believed her parents were animal rights activists. Surely as such they wouldn't eat meat would they? Maybe they weren't that radical though they were upset over the stuffed fox. Perhaps it was like her father said, it would be different if it was for food.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is my little vixen pup staring off into space again?&quot; Dru's mother asked.<br />
<br />
This startled Dru and she said the first thing that came to her mind &quot;Uh huh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What were you thinking about?&quot; Dru's father asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nufing&quot; Dru said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You must have been thinking of something&quot; Dru's mother said. &quot;Is it about tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Na huh&quot; Dru said. She hadn't been thinking about tonight though now she would be.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well what were you thinking then?&quot; Dru's mother asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why you eat meat?&quot; Dru asked. She didn't mean to say it but it just came out.<br />
<br />
Dru's mother and father looked at each other. Finally her mother said &quot;Dru, you know why we eat meat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No I don't&quot; Dru said. &quot;You were upset ober da fox.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We were upset because that fox was hunted and killed for nothing more than someone's enjoyment&quot; Dru's father said. &quot;It's a senseless thing to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Den why you eat meat?&quot; Dru asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because it's different&quot; Dru's mother said. &quot;The cow that died for<br />
this meat provides us with nutrition. It wasn't hunted down just for<br />
sport and to be stuffed. You know this already.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dru didn't think it was wise to continue and so said &quot;I fowgot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's alright&quot; Dru's father said. &quot;You're still young and you will forget some things. Now finish your meal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dru sat and finished eating what her mother and father had ordered her. She still didn't quite understand how they could be so upset over how one animal died and not how another one died. Did it really make that much of a difference that one died to provide food and one died just because someone could kill it? It seemed that it did make that much of a difference, at least where her parents were concerned.<br />
<br />
After lunch Dru's father returned to work and her mother and her went home. Dru's new home was out of the city limits by a few miles and there wasn't anybody else around. It was set back in some woods at the end of a long drive. Nobody would know the house was there from the main road. As they were driving down the drive Dru noticed that it was disappearing behind them. It was completely impossible for it to do that yet it was also completely impossible that Dru had<br />
been transformed into a three year old girl. The house itself was a reasonable size for a family of three. It had two stories to it and Dru suspected that there was also a basement. There was also a two car garage attached to the house. Dru could see a fairly good sized yard with swings, a sandbox, a good sized in ground pool, and a spa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does my little vixen pup want to go swimming?&quot; Dru's mother asked after she had parked the car in the garage.<br />
<br />
Dru thought about this. The day had quickly grown quite warm rapidly, even for a summer day. A nice cool swim would feel so good. Finally she said &quot;Uh huh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then my little vixen pup&quot; Dru's mother said. &quot;Let's go inside and change you into your swimsuit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dru had a moment of panic when her mother had said &quot;change you into your swimsuit&quot;. She at first thought that she was actually going to be changed into a swimsuit. She quickly realized that she was being silly and that all her mother meant was that she was going to put on her swimsuit.<br />
<br />
Dru and her mother spent the rest of the day until six in the pool. Dru had almost forgotten how fun swimming could be. It was even more fun in this pool. The shallow end went from three feet deep to four foot deep. Then there was the five foot to seven foot part of the pool. After that it dropped off sharply into twelve feet of water. At the deep end was a diving board and a wave generator. Dru really had a blast riding the waves that were generated in her inflatable swim ring. The best part was hitting the trough between the waves where she'd splash a bit of water up when she hit it.<br />
<br />
At six they got out of the pool and changed. Just as the had gotten changed Dru's father came home and they sat down to a dinner of pizza. After dinner Dru's father said &quot;Well it's about time. We should prepare.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're right dear&quot; Dru's mother said. &quot;I really enjoy the times that we can do this with Dru. I just hope that she'll learn how to control it without the full moon soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be good but remember, she's just three&quot; Dru's father said. &quot;Most don't learn to control it until they're five at least. Some even take as long as eighteen to control it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know&quot; Dru's mother said. &quot;It's just that Dru learned how to go potty earlier than people thought she would. Earlier than many other kids.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know that that's no indication of when she'll learn control&quot; Dru's father said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know&quot; Dru's mother said. &quot;Well we need to get undressed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dru didn't understand this as her parents started to take their clothes off. Finally when they were naked they looked at Dru and her mother asked &quot;Why haven't you taken your clothes off yet young lady?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do I need to?&quot; Dru asked back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because if you don't the transformation will ruin them&quot; Dru's mother said. &quot;It's getting late. I better help you get out of your clothes before the moon rises.&quot; With that her mother started to take off Dru's clothes.<br />
<br />
Dru fought at first but her mother was bigger and stronger and was finally able to get her clothes off. Just as her mother had taken off her panties she felt a tingling spread through out her body.<br />
<br />
&quot;The moon has risen&quot; Dru's father said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can feel it you know&quot; Dru's mother said.<br />
<br />
For Dru's part she couldn't understand how they could tell that the moon had risen. Though she was distracted from that by the tingling growing more intense.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dru sweetie&quot; Dru's mother said. &quot;Pay attention to how you feel now. It will be important for you to feel it when you want to change without the full moon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's wong wif me?&quot; Dru asked in a panic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothings wrong with you sweetie&quot; Dru's mother said. &quot;You've been through this before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What am I?&quot; Dru shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know why you shouted that&quot; Dru's mother said. &quot;You know that we're were-foxes.&quot;<br />
<br />
As soon as Dru's mother said this red fur started to grow out of her arms. She felt the hair on her head recede into her scalp leaving her bald. She was able to look into a mirror and she saw her ears slide up the sides of her head and become pointy like a foxes ears. Her face pushed out into a short muzzle and her eyes moved slightly to the sides though still looking forward. The tips of her fingers changed too. Skin grew over her fingernails while those same fingernails became claws and her toes went through the same change. She felt a tail grow out of her spine and her feet lengthen. She soon<br />
found it more comfortable to stand on her toes. Her fur continued to grow throughout the transformation and now that it was done Dru knew that she was a Red Fox. She had red fur except for her lower muzzle,<br />
chest, belly, and the tip of her tail. She looked at her parents and saw that they had also changed. Her mother still had her breasts though they were covered in fur and she couldn't see her fathers penis at all. She remembered that the male of most species had a protective sheath that the penis stayed in unless sexually excited.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you feel sweetie?&quot; Dru's mother asked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel good&quot; Dru said. Indeed she did feel good. In fact she felt better than she thought she would. Her eyesight was a bit diminished but her hearing and her sense of smell was much stronger. She also<br />
felt a bit stronger and nimble. She felt so good that she didn't know if she wanted to correct her wish. And now she knew why her parents were so sad about the stuffed fox and with a jolt she realized that it was a vixen kit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Should we go for a run?&quot; Dru's father asked.</p>
