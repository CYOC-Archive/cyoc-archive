<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The faculty locker room was, in Noah&#39;s opinion, an oversized room. There were even more lockers than male teachers at the school, so as one can imagine, it was never crowded. At this particular time of day, there was no one inside. <br />
<br />
Three rows of locker shelves were poised against the walls with several benches arranged at the central space. The shower stalls were on the other side of the room, just in front of the benches, with a large mirror covering the remaining free wall. <br />
<br />
- Best thing of hitting the courts at noon is hot water assured - Said Scott as he placed his bag on the floor and started undressing<br />
<br />
Noah took his time pretending to look for his clothes on his own bag, yet through the wall mirror he watched his hunky friend in full display. <br />
<br />
Scott removed his spandex shirt and used it to wipe the remaining sweat from his torso, before throwing it on the floor. Noah couldn&#39;t stop staring. Scott&#39;s wide chest was covered in a trimmed layer of hair, that went down over his belly and fused with a bright coper treasure trail, disappearing at the beginning of his shorts. Scott took manscaping seriously, and it only made him look better. <br />
The faint definition of a 4 pack could be seen, shimmering from the sweat. Scott&#39;s shoulders were rounder and fuller than Noah remembered, giving him a bigger look and a slightly wider back than it has been just this morning. He innocently scratched his right pec and Noah saw how Scott started cupping it with his hand. Noah had a mental flash of what it would be like to suck on those big round nipples of his. <br />
<br />
In order to avoid showing his now growing erection, Noah went straight to a stall and ran the water. It wasn&#39;t long before he heard Scott lock the stall next to his and started showering. Noah finished as quick as possible and went dressing. He was all done but his shoes when Scott finally turned the water off. Noah sited in one of the benches and started lacing his oxfords, strategically positioning himself between Scott&#39;s stall and his locker, which he left open. <br />
<br />
- Someone&#39;s on a hurry - Said Scott as he exited the stall, his towel tucked around his waist, some drops of water still dangling on his manly chest hair. <br />
<br />
- I thought you said you were starving - said Noah, finishing his right shoe. <br />
<br />
Scott approached his Locker and removed his towel. Disappointment ran through Noah&#39;s mind as he saw that underneath, his friend was already wearing some gray boxer trunks. He expected Scott to be fully naked and the idea of catching a glimpse of his junk as he dressed had him excited. This was obviously not going to happen. Yet the feeling quickly vanished, as the towering hunk on underwear was still a sight to see. <br />
<br />
This was the first time that Noah saw his friend in just his underwear. He struggled pretending to look busy with his other shoe, as he catched glances of Scott&#39;s lower body. His legs were big and firm, being topped by a nice round ass. Through his day-to-day pants Scott showed already some nice assets, yet up close Noah was amazed by the perky round butt-cheeks hiding through the grey fabric. On the front side, Noah could notice a decent bulge. Scott was definitely packing, but it was hard to say how much.<br />
<br />
- You can bet I am - replied Scott as he turned around to face his locker - I could easily eat your plate and mine today, I swear I ... I ... <br />
<br />
*THUD* sounded the lockers shelf when Scott lost his balance and placed both his forearms on it, preventing his face to slam against the surface.<br />
<br />
The sudden noise startled Noah, who looked up immediately and saw Scott leaning against the shelf.<br />
<br />
- Ooohh ... - Moaned Scott Softly as a shiver ran through his whole body.<br />
<br />
- Scott ?? - Said Noah, who stood up in a second and came by his side. Yet he received no answer. <br />
<br />
As Noah approached, he noticed how Scott ass was trembling. Both his butt-cheeks ever so slightly vibrating. Noah watches curiously, noticing how Scott had his eyes closed and his big hands tightly clenched into fists. <br />
<br />
And it happened. In the span of 2-3 seconds, Scott&#39;s ass grew in front of Noah&#39;s eyes. As if someone pumped a gush of air into them, each cheek just ballooned out and what was already a nice rear, now became a perfect porn-star muscle butt. Each cheek way bigger than Noah&#39;s hands. The scene was insanely hot, and Noah’s dick became fully erect in his pants. <br />
<br />
Seconds later, Scott opened his eyes, finally getting out of his trance. <br />
<br />
-Wow - He said, with his usual playful demeanor - Talk about dizzy spells.<br />
<br />
Scott regained his stance and he continued to go through his stuff, as if nothing just happened. <br />
<br />
-Man - Stammered Noah - Are you OK ? - He asked, as his eyes went back and forth from Scott&#39;s face and his new bubble-butt.<br />
<br />
- Yeah, I just felt light-headed for a second. I must be low on sugar - Replied Scott, who took his pants and started to put them on.<br />
<br />
Noah watched as Scott turned around, facing him again. With the new size of his butt straining the rear of his trunks, Scott&#39;s package was now on full display. Noah could perfectly see the outline of his dick showing through the fabric. Noah had never seen a soft dick as thick as Scott&#39;s. It wasn&#39;t that long, yet it must have been 5.5 inches in girth, soft. Was he already packing that much?  or did the growth spurt hit his dick too?<br />
<br />
- So ... should we go to the cafeteria ... Or have some pizza instead? - Scott&#39;s phrase was interrupted every time he struggled with his pants to get them to come up. He finally succeeded to button them up. The now one-size-too-small pants hugged his legs and ass well. His bulge showing bigger than this morning.<br />
<br />
Scott stared at Noah waiting for an answer.<br />
<br />
-Hmmm ... Hello ? - He called, as he sat down on the bench just in front of Noah&#39;s, and started buttoning up his shirt. <br />
<br />
Noah was speechless yet his mind was racing. Not only had he watched his friend grow in front of him in the sexiest way, but the latter seemed completely oblivious to the change. That was not normal.<br />
<br />
- Pizza ... pizza is fine - Answered Noah as he was processing the events. <br />
<br />
- Very well - Said Scott, who was struggling to close the second-to-last button of his shirt, his pecs pushing both sides apart. He eventually succeeded, yet it was easy to see the shirt straining on his chest, a slight opening forming between that button and the one below, allowing to see a bit of his hairy torso. <br />
<br />
- Sorry for keeping you waiting buddy - Apologized Scott, as he locked eyes on Noah - Now let&#39;s get going, we can take my car, It&#39;ll be ... Ohh ...<br />
<br />
Scott interrupted his phrase again to let out a soft moan, closing his eyes and tilting his head back. It was happening again.<br />
<br />
Noah saw a shiver ran through Scott&#39;s buddy once again, before noticing this time his pecs were trembling. Both mounds of muscle flexed, and as they relaxed, they grew bigger. <br />
<br />
-Oh … oh yeaaah - Moaned Scott softly as his chest puffed rounder and wider. Once ... twice ...and three times. The last one being too much for the already strained button, which popped and flew, almost hitting Noah in the face. A wet spot started forming on Scott&#39;s bulge, showing through his pants. He was clearly enjoying the growth trance.<br />
<br />
Noah gasped as the top of Scott&#39;s shirt opened overflowing with his new hairy pecs. Noah thought he could cream his pants just from the sight of sheer pleasure he saw on Scott’s face, and the wet spot on his package, where it sure was resting the head of his thick-as-a-can cock.<br />
<br />
Seconds passed, and as Scott&#39;s breathing came back to normal,he opened his eyes. Blinking several times.<br />
<br />
- Whoops, I must have dozed off again - He said, once again, completely oblivious of what just happened. Smiling to a shocked Noah. Nevertheless, that did not face him<br />
<br />
- So, shall we ... ? - Said Scott before standing up and casually heading to the door.</p>
