<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(There is nothing wrong with inorganic TF). <br />
<br />
Ashlee as she ate lunch with Danielle heard an annoying nose that wouldn&#39;t go away. It took her a minute to realize it was her own heart beat. The sound her breath was a constant distraction as well. She looked at her scale, they had a nice shine to them, but they were uneven, rough almost, it felt wrong. <br />
<br />
Her clothes itched, they chaffed and she felt constrained in them. <br />
<br />
Ashlee realized she felt heavy, weighted down, her body having folds and cracks that felt &#39;unnatural.&#39; <br />
<br />
She thought of her skeleton holding in shape likes he was a tent. She looked at the food in front of her, she thought of putting it in her mouth, grinding it up, swallowing, where it would dissolve in her stomach, and the left over would be squeezed out from her bum, and felt complete disgusted by it. Love and passion were so much more pure and filling-ugh. <br />
<br />
Was this what the pen meant by changes being &quot;covered up&quot; if they were overwritten? The feeling of being something wrong eve if your mind screamed that it was right?<br />
<br />
Ashlee realized tis meant her object lesson with Danielle was now much more, if she was made male or human, she&#39;d be completely miserable. At least she wasn&#39;t bringing it up for the moment. <br />
<br />
She politely took the pen from Danielle and a posted note and went straight to the lady&#39;s bathroom. <br />
<br />
Nikki! Was she suffering the same way?! Ashlee was filled with remorse, she had wanted to undo a wrong and had only done an even worse one!<br />
<br />
She wrote down, &#39;Does undoing reversals carry the same risk as reversals themselves?&#39; <br />
<br />
&#39;No. More often than not they can even repair the majority of the damage caused by the reversal.&#39; <br />
<br />
She wrote down, <br />
<br />
&#39;Nikki is her proper age as a child before the reversal, where she should with her best friend at the office, and suffers no ill effect from the temporarily reversal. Danielle will notice this change, but won&#39;t dwell on it, calmly accept it, and move on.&#39; <br />
<br />
At the same time, little Nikki woke up from her bad dream of having spent the night in jail, and now was her normal happy self. <br />
<br />
The infuriating noise of Ashlee&#39;s blasted heart pounded in Ashlee&#39;s ear holes at what Ashlee wrote down next.<br />
<br />
&#39;I am a good living love doll for my Danielle, I&#39;ll love and support her through anything, no matter what.<br />
<br />
&#39;I won&#39;t be accidentally blown away by a strong breeze, punctured, pulled under by an automatic stairs, or other things that would make my form horribly doom me (this last part allies to anyone else made into a being similar to me). <br />
<br />
&#39;Danielle will be aware I&#39;ve change, but she&#39;ll calmly accept it, not dwell on it, poke too deeply about it, she&#39;ll understand this is what I&#39;m meant to be, what I want to be.&#39; <br />
<br />
Ashlee couldn&#39;t have felt more libterated as her clothes dissolved off her and the noise of her heart, bones, lungs, nostrils, tongue, were replaced with the sweet sound her latex body. <br />
<br />
Ashlee felt the lightness but sturdiness of her body return, her skin, herself, now smooth and shinny like it was supposed to be. <br />
<br />
When a barcode appeared on her butt, she laughed, she&#39;d never seen it as demeaning but a badge of honor, a sense of belonging and wholeness.<br />
<br />
After a few moment the change done and Ashlee was herself again. <br />
<br />
She flushed the notes down the toilet. <br />
<br />
Washing herself up, the loving doll returned to her spot next o Danielle, thery&#39;re wasn&#39;t any meat for Ashlee now, Danielle&#39;s love and passion was her sustenance. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m back master,&quot; she said in a teasting and ironic tone.<br />
<br />
Danielle looked at her, took in the gorgose piece of living latex in front of her for several seconds, then calmly went back to her steak. <br />
<br />
&quot;Decided o give it another go? Well if it floats your boat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OH it does master, it does,&quot; Ashlee said playfully putting the pen and pad back in Danielle&#39;s purse.<br />
<br />
&quot;You could have asked me to change you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes master, but I wanted it to worded my way, and how I wanted, and I didn&#39;t want people looking over my shoulder.&quot; She semi-lied.<br />
<br />
If her Danielle becoming male again would make her as unhappy as Ashlee becoming, blech, flesh and blood had, then she&#39;d be a good doll and ensure happiness for her owner/wife/partner. It had been Ashlee&#39;s idea to teach her a lesson, maybe this was her penance too, well, she would be a good doll for her.<br />
<br />
Ashlee drank deeply from Danielle&#39;s love and passion. She supposed she had been lucky to include that sub-clause of Danielle being bi herself in what she originally wrote in Dave&#39;s lesson. <br />
<br />
After Danielle finished eating and paying the bill, Ashlee clamped Dnaielle&#39;s claw with her two rubber ones. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Master! Let&#39;s go to the park right now! I have lots of ideas on how to use the pen for us!&quot; <br />
<br />
Not waiting for an answer, Ashlee pulled her &#39;owner&#39; along. <br />
<br />
Danielle had the odd feeling the two of them had switched roles, and now Ashlee was the one wanting to be liberal with the pen and Danielle the conservative. <br />
<br />
Danielle had to admit, it was a beautiful day at the park. And with no chance of rain or heavy fog, she actually felt rather overdressed next to her naked wife. <br />
<br />
The two reptiles walked by a ice cream shack where the girl behind the counter gave a short girl with no manners a triple decker cone, and didn&#39;t get so much as a thank you but held the grin on her face until the child was gone. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I were a robot.&quot; The ice cream girl grumbled once her customers were out of ear shot. <br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me for a minute master, I&#39;d like to get you some ice cream.&quot; Said Ashlee filching the pen and pad from Daniella before approaching the girl. <br />
<br />
<br />
&#39;This person will not be able to lie to me for this conversation and will feel compelled to answer all my questions.&#39; Ashlee wrote down. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you mean that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mean what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That you&#39;d be happier being a robot at this job?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; . . . yes I do. When I got this job, it sounds crazy but I loved it. I liked just watching the people go by, I didn&#39;t care what the pay was, but then it got boring, it got a headache keeping that happy attitude up. Yes, I WOULD be happy if I was a freakin&#39; robot doing this job, not able to get bored and able to stay happy no matter my hours or how boring things got.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you really really-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I said yes. What are you? A surveyor?&quot;<br />
<br />
That she was a naked rubber lizard woman meant nothing to the girl behind the ice cream stand. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sort of.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashlee wrote down. &#39;She&#39;ll become the robot she want to be, and reality will adjust accordingly. She&#39;s also hacker proof.&#39;  <br />
<br />
The ice cream girl stiffed, and her skin became shinny, and her ears became a pair of walk-man like transceivers with LSD displays and antenna, and her eyes took on the reflectiveness of a dolls, her hair became bright blue and grew down to the small of her back, her eyes became anime style and bright yellow, her chest actually got smaller, not larger, and her figure became more petite. <br />
<br />
&quot;Can you repeat your answer please?&quot; Ashlee asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;No Madam, I wouldn&#39;t really care to be human. I am happy the way I am. Are there any other questions I can answer for your survey?&quot; The robot girl asked without missing a beat. <br />
<br />
Ashlee proceeded to ask her her favorite color (purple), favorite movie (Dawn of the Dead), her name, (Blasting Processor-8900 but everyone called her Sunny Jones). And said it was nice talking to another synthetic.</p>
