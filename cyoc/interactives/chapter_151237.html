<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenkins shrugged, &quot;Yea, the Jeep must have been stolen. It was a very nice looking Jeep.&quot;<br />
<br />
The officer of the watch, whose name was Bailey said, &quot;Just leave the keys in evidence.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenkins lied, &quot;I already did.&quot; He raced home in his old Ford Fiesta. Although it was a nice car, it wasn&#39;t as nice as a brand new, souped up, shiny silver jeep. With the garage door still closed, he admired his new Jeep for a few minutes before pushing the fob.<br />
<br />
Jeff stood there naked wondering what Jenkins was up to. Jenkins immediately began playing with Jeff&#39;s shifter. Jenkins asked, &quot;You like being a Jeep, don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff nervously said, &quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenkins asked, &quot;And you like being owned, don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff asked, &quot;Yes, but are you a good owner?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenkins laughed, &quot;Compared to your brother, absolutely. I&#39;ve never owned a Jeep before but I&#39;ll take good care of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff asked, &quot;You&#39;re not going to try and fuck me are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenkins said, &quot;No, I want to make love to you. May I kiss you?<br />
<br />
Jeff and Jenkins started making out very tenderly. Jeff began to undress Jenkins but Jenkins stopped him.<br />
<br />
Jenkins said, &quot;We need to deal with your brother first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;Yea, I&#39;m glad he had to reattach my shifter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenkins gave Jeff&#39;s shifter a playful tug before pressing the fob turning Jeff into a Jeep again. Then Jenkins grabbed some sweat clothes before heading out.<br />
<br />
Jenkins loved driving Jeff knowing that his new Jeep loved him. Jenkins kept caressing the shifter even when he didn&#39;t need to. Every time Jenkins pushed the button to change gears, the radio moaned, &quot;Oh yea,&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenkins stopped for fuel on the way. Jeff felt the nozzle plunge inside his hole. Jeff cried, &quot;You&#39;re giving me the good stuff. Premium grade.&quot; Neither of them knew it but the octane was like viagra to Jeff. It made him run hotter. It caused him to be always turned on.<br />
<br />
When they got to Jeff&#39;s house, Jenkins changed Jeff into a human and gave him the sweat clothes. Jeff helped Jenkins sneak in and steal the Chronivac. Then they raced home to make some changes.<br />
<br />
Jeff didn&#39;t want to mess with his family too much, especially since Jeff&#39;s dad seemed to love Jeff more as a Jeep than he did as a son. So instead of erasing their memories of Jeff, he changed it so that Bill would want to sell Jeff to Jenkins. He also made some other changes to make the evidence of theft disappear and to deal with Greg. Finally, he typed into the Chronivac that when it made these changes, it should transport itself back to Jeff&#39;s house. Before pressing enter, Jeff kissed Jenkins and said, &quot;See you soon.&quot; When he pressed enter, he disappeared.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
It was an experience getting towed. Jeff kept his radio off as they loaded him onto the tow truck and tied him down. The night air was chilly but he was a Jeep. He could handle the cold. At the impound yard, he soon fell asleep.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
The next morning, Bill was worried when both his sons were missing. He called the police and soon found both of them and brought them home. He was so furious with Greg that he grounded Greg &quot;until I say otherwise.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bill didn&#39;t know where the idea came from but it seemed very fitting to turn Greg into a Jeep for the entire time of his grounding. Whenever Greg wasn&#39;t in school, doing homework, or some other approved of activity, Greg would be a Jeep.<br />
<br />
Then, again not knowing where the idea came from, Bill got the idea to sell Jeff. He started typing up an advertisement and put it on the internet. He immediately got a call from a police officer named Jenkins who was interested.<br />
<br />
It was a Saturday so Jeff stayed in his room waiting for the plan. Bill knocked an said, &quot;Um, Jeff, um, there&#39;s someone here to see you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff asked, &quot;Who is here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bill stammered, &quot;Um, I know I should have asked you first but, uh, there&#39;s someone here who wants to buy you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff rushed out and gave his dad a hug. &quot;Thank you Dad. Thank you for selling me.&quot;<br />
<br />
After the excitement faded, Bill said, &quot;Alright, Mr. Jenkins. This is the Jeep I&#39;m selling.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenkins said, &quot;If it&#39;s all the same to you, I&#39;d like to look the Jeep over before I buy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bill said, &quot;Certainly, let&#39;s head out to the garage.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenkins said, &quot;We can start right here. A Jeep doesn&#39;t have to wear clothes does he?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff was shocked. He hadn&#39;t expected this exposure in front of his dad. He wondered how his dad would respond.<br />
<br />
But Bill already knew Jeff&#39;s secrets from having read his Chronivac profile. I had been a surprise weeks ago but it helped that the Chronivac also revealed that Jeff wasn&#39;t just a gay son. In fact, Bill had read that Jeff wasn&#39;t as much into gay sex as he was into being a man&#39;s Jeep. Bill said, &quot;That&#39;s alright with me. If you find anything wrong or not to your liking, I am a master auto mechanic and I&#39;ll make the repairs free labor. Bring him by regularly for maintenance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff just stood there in total shock.<br />
<br />
Bill said, &quot;Well you heard him. Jeeps don&#39;t need clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff only wore sweat clothes anyway so it was easy to strip. Jenkins said, &quot;I saw him last night in the impound yard. That&#39;s when I knew I had to have him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bill asked, &quot;You don&#39;t seem surprised at all that my son is a Jeep.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenkins said, &quot;We talked all about it last night.&quot; Jenkins grabbed Jeff&#39;s shifter that had just come into view. &quot;We got to know each other well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bill said, &quot;Um, okay, I&#39;m still not used to that idea, but hey, what do you think of his shifter? It&#39;s not the original he was born with. It&#39;s been upgraded.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenkins laughed.<br />
<br />
Bill said, &quot;I&#39;m glad my wife and daughter went out for the day. They&#39;d never understand. May I feel his shifter?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff protested, &quot;DAD?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bill said, &quot;Hush up. You&#39;re a Jeep and I just want to examine the new shifter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenkins stepped aside but said, &quot;That is one thing I might want to change. His shifter is so small that it&#39;s really just a button above a vagina. I&#39;d like something I can grab and hold.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bill said, &quot;Alright, his brother has a nice shifter. I hope you&#39;re not a size queen. It&#39;s average.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff continued to blush even after he finally became a Jeep in the garage.  His color didn&#39;t change but he felt like he was blushing intensely. His dad was planning on giving him his brother&#39;s shifter and Greg would be left with a pussy for a while. It was so fitting.<br />
<br />
Jeff thought about Greg&#39;s shifter and was pleased. Greg was a little bit more than average but more importantly, Greg didn&#39;t seem to ever shrink. Jenkins would always have a handful of shifter to play with even when he wasn&#39;t driving.</p>
