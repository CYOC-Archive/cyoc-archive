AN: Another Micro post. Hope you guys don't mind. <br />

<br />
&quot;My son...&quot; Gillian II Daleson said, &quot;I just can't believe he's dead and I'm still here... fathers <br />
shouldn't outlive their sons.&quot; That was an absolute truth no on was about tell the copper <br />
leoman different. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry Gillian-San.&quot; Amy said.<br />
<br />
Gillian looked at the little dirty white wolf who had taken him from his box in the attic. &quot;.... <br />
I forgive you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy's normal stalwart demeanor was disrupted by that answer, she didn't know how to <br />
respond. <br />
<br />
&quot;I forgive the Big Bad Pack... I was always aware except when my mind was dreaming... I <br />
remember the black and gold wolf apologizing for what that bastard did... and.. I've had a <br />
lot of time to think about it and... considering how long forever is... it feels pointless... I <br />
just can believe that bastard got away scout free...&quot;<br />
<br />
Penny said, &quot;Trust me, I'm sure he got what was coming to him after the end like everyone <br />
else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gold and black wolf? You mean Blackie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Patrick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There was a young wolf by that name, or did he just look young? He fought during the <br />
War To End All Wars, didn't he?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy and Penny looked at each other, they had another Leoman to bring up to speed on <br />
history. <br />
<br />
&quot;He's not Alpha but he's still the Pack's Elder... that's him over there with the cubs and <br />
pups...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... incredible, he's larger than I remember...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's had time to grow.&quot; Mother Glen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;My granddaughter... Gillie... what is she like? Is she married?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To her work.&quot; Penny said. &quot;She's police chief.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm proud.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
A leoman with a dark brown mane and tawny gold fur walked to the house of Glendale's <br />
police chief without fear or hesitation. After all, they were all one pride. Jacob walked <br />
through the evening, his fur giving him the protection he needed, the night actually rather <br />
a blessing with the sun now not bearing down on the fur coat he couldn't take off. <br />
<br />
Of course the house was to a Leoman's scale, which meant the carpenters got a larger <br />
penny out of building it as always. Jacob knocked on the door, &quot;Gillie? Are you home? That <br />
was you right? Are you okay?&quot; He didn't get any response that was coherent. &quot;Do I need to <br />
call a doctor? Should I get Dr. Beta-Julie?&quot; <br />
<br />
Again, the noises weren't anything that sounded like language. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I'm coming in.&quot; Jacob wasn't worried about a burglar, who'd be insane enough to <br />
rob the house of the chief of police? <br />
<br />
Jacob opened the door and found the spartan house, the only real decorations being new <br />
paper clippings, mostly tabloids, of reports about the curse over the decades that weren't <br />
covered up by the tourist trade. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dammitdammitfuckfuckfuckhowcouldthistherewasnoturnthisisimpossible!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gillie? You smell aggravated...&quot; Jacob followed the noise of the rantings to the bedroom, <br />
and finally the bathroom, where he found his pride mate snarling, cursing and crying at the <br />
sight of herself. <br />
<br />
&quot;GIllie! You look awful!&quot; <br />
<br />
Glowing green eyes in the dark room glared back at him, &quot;WHO THE HELL ARE YOU? WHAT <br />
ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOME!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob took several steps back, Gillie looked ready to kill. He laid his tail low and decreased <br />
his stature and did his best to appear submissive, &quot;Gillie... you're not well... it's me... <br />
Jacob... we're part of the same Pride.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gillie growled, &quot;So, that's it eh? SCREW IT! Get out!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No way! You look awful! You sound awful! And you're barely making sense!&quot;<br />
<br />
Gillie held her hands to her head, &quot;STUPID CURSE! Why couldn't I end up a happy little <br />
brainwashed zombie like all the rest!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gillie! What are you talking about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It doesn't  matter one damn because you'd think I was crazy! And I'm gonna end up in a <br />
mental ward until the doctors convince me I'm crazy and tell me what to think! It's all over <br />
again! It's all over again!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gillie CALM DOWN!&quot; Jacob took hold her shoulders, the copper lioness snarled in the <br />
darkness and her claws came out and cut at his sides. <br />
<br />
Jacob took several steps back, he didn't strike her back, that wasn't what was the civilized <br />
thing to do. &quot;GILLIE WAKE UP!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's the rest of the world that can never ever wake up!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob then instead of trying to grapple her like was logical, he hugged her, he managed to <br />
block her trying to knee him in the sheath, &quot;Gillie, it's okay, I don't know what's wrong, but <br />
I'm here for you. So is Marie. So is Sarbina. So is Trevor. So is Mother Glen!&quot; He stroked her <br />
down her back. <br />
<br />
Gillie shivered over his strokes of her fur and down her tail, she shivered again, after about <br />
a minute she finally stopped struggling, and began to cry, &quot;Guess it doesn't matter now... <br />
stupid game, stupid game, stupid witches, stupid curse... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gillie? Is this about the game? What happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... fuck it... it doesn't matter.. not anymore... I thought I'd never have to through this <br />
again.. I was an idiot... doesn't matter anymore... screw it...&quot; <br />
<br />
Gillie leaned into him. <br />
<br />

<br />
1675, the woods outside the praying town that would merge into Glendale. Griselle who <br />
would become Gomorrah was alone in the forest, enjoying her alone time as she always <br />
did.  She and her sisters had become famous for their generosity in the praying town by <br />
now. And has a reputation in Glendale for being 'a little strange' but nothing that would <br />
draw negative attention to them, they were careful to avoid that. They needed the children <br />
of Glendale to trust them after all. <br />
<br />
Sadly they were still struggling to find a perfect way of avoiding adulthood. Their parents <br />
and both grandparents had never thought to teach their girls a thing about alchemy, and <br />
thus none of the girls had a clue that alchemists for centuries had been trying to perfect <br />
precisely what the girls were trying to do, nearly all met with failure, most of the rest met <br />
with death, the precious one maybe two though out all of human history that did <br />
succeed... they wisely kept to themselves. <br />
<br />
 Gita was now taking classes for Confirmation with Goldwyn close behind.  She wandered <br />
without giving it one thought today, she had her power, she had nothing to fear from some <br />
predator or scared prey (the little girl not giving a thought that most predators as a rule <br />
weren't noticed by their prey until the moment their fangs were in their meal's neck). <br />
<br />
Griselle then saw it, a sharp shooter alone, testing out a new gun of his... she saw him fire <br />
at a crow. She felt it, FELT IT get hit! She knew it was just an animal. She knew it had <br />
nothing to do with her. But that crow... she knew it, SHE KNEW IT! <br />
<br />
Griselle tapped into her magic, via the infinite chaos... the sharp shooters gun fell to the <br />
ground, not going off since it only had one shot in it. His clothes fell into themselves. What <br />
emerged from his tent of clothes a second later was a close proximity to a fairy-tales <br />
looking fairy. Naked, with a pair of bright purple, impossible butterfly wings, looking to be <br />
the age of a toddler, the size of a doll, and now female, and hair that was bright pink and <br />
a pair of antenna from her forehead. The newly created fairy looked around with solid gold <br />
eyes with no white or centers, feeling very confused. <br />
<br />
Feeling VERY DIZZY Grissle wandered over to where the crow was, bleeding. The world <br />
turned twins and out of focus as Grissle's sudden and reckless use of magic left her nearly <br />
drunk as a side effect. <br />
<br />
She fell to her knees next to the baby crow, looking like it had been abandoned by it's <br />
family. (Or, more likely if Grissle had known nature as well as her father Running-Bear, <br />
tossed out of it's nest by it's own nest mates with their mother watching on to see which <br />
one was more worth her time to raise).  Grissle figured the crow's other family had been <br />
killed by hunters like the fairy had been a second ago. <br />
<br />
She touched the crow, and saw it was still breathing, and bleeding. His breath was shallow. <br />
It looked at her with eyes that knew. <br />
<br />
&quot;I... I know you... you are... you are... G... you're the one I was waiting for...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You're the crow I saw! I know you are! From my dream! So .. so long ago.. BUT I <br />
REMEMBER! It is you!&quot; Grissle took the crow and brought it to her chest. And once again <br />
tapped in the infinite chaos, healing him, a task she hadn't used all that often, usually just <br />
turning people into creatures, animals, or objects rather than repairing their broken <br />
bodies. But she forced the infinite chaos through her, and into the crow. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're lucky... yes, Lucky Crow, that is what I'll call you.&quot; None of the girls had figured out <br />
their special friends real names yet. But as the chaos flowed through her and into the bird... <br />
it hit her, like a blow to the head it hit her... As the crow tittered on life, and she touched it <br />
on that edge of the cliff between life and death. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're name... your name.... it is Solome!&quot; <br />
<br />
And it was like fate itself was tied them together with a string at the hearts. And both felt <br />
everything the other felt, and could feel everything the other could feel. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... my mistress... it is Solome...&quot; The male crow said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But.. you're a boy...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes mistress.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't know girl witches could have boy familiars.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is no rule against it my master...&quot; Said Lucky/Solome as he tested his repaired <br />
muscles in his master's hands. <br />
 <br />
Meanwhile, the fairy that had been the hunter that had shoot Lucky flew next to the girl, <br />
&quot;Er, excuse me, I don't mean to interrupt a witch and their familiar but... I think I was in <br />
the middle of testing something someone I really love gave me as a gift.. but I can't <br />
remember what it is now... I can't seem to remember my name either... and... I think this <br />
place is called Glendale, or the place near it is... but I can't seem to remember if I live here <br />
or not... can you help me?&quot;</p>
