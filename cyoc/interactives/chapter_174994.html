<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you and Vicky headed away from the farmyard and over to a large field on the edge of the property, a distant bellow from behind you told you that Bertha was probably about to have her changes cemented for good. However, you soon had much bigger concerns when you saw who was in the nearby field. It was unmistakably your sister and parents who all sat tied up just like your friends!<br />
<br />
You whinnied and reared-up when you saw your family sitting struggling in front of you. Losing all of your closest friends had been horrific enough; you couldn’t let the same happen to your loved ones.<br />
<br />
However, Vicky didn’t seem phased by your reaction as she maintained her usual look of evil anticipation. “Come on Princess, must we really go through this again? If you want your friends and family to stay safe and healthy I suggest you behave yourself. After all, it would be unfortunate if we had to send dear Jasmine or precious Olivia off to some breeding farm. Those two cuties wouldn’t have a chance to breath, what with all the sex that they would be having.” Vicky then paused as you still snorted and tugged at your lead rope in anger. “And what about poor Bertha and Keira? I’d hate to see them wind up on the menu at the local fast food joint, but if that’s what you want then I will respect your decision.”<br />
<br />
You felt sick upon hearing all of this. For a brief second you wondered if it might be more merciful to let Keira and Bertha go out while they still remembered being Kenny and Brad. Ultimately though, you simply lacked the stomach to do it. You didn’t want anyone to suffer more than they had to.<br />
<br />
With this in mind you gave a resigned whinny of acceptance as you allowed yourself to be led into the field. Once inside, you turned to look at your terrified family members. Your mum Anna and sister Alice were both struggling desperately as they sobbed and cried for help. As for your father Aaron, he was slightly more composed, though he was clearly just as scared as the others as he spat curses at Vicky through the gag in his mouth.<br />
<br />
“Why so glum you lot?” Vicky asked your family as she pulled you over to them. “I would have thought you would be excited to have this family reunion.” The vile woman then reached up to stroke your neck possessively before she continued: “I know that poor, darling Princess here has missed you all very much. Now she is very keen for you to join us here at my family’s farm, aren’t you girl?”<br />
<br />
You started to whinny and stomp your hooves in protest until Vicky shot you a piercing glare. This threatening look stunned you into silence as you realised that she was starting to run out of patience with you. At any moment she could just arbitrarily decide that you, your friends and your family deserved an even worse fate than what was already lined up for them.<br />
<br />
With you reluctantly deciding to bite your tongue, Vicky continued to explain what was going to happen to your family. “Now then, I can clearly see that you are a close-knit family, which is why I will let the three of you live together during your stay with us. And don’t worry about not seeing Princess, I’ll make sure she comes to visit you frequently.” You snorted under your breath but otherwise decided to keep your composure.<br />
<br />
“Now then,” Vicky said as she approached your father, “I think we’ll begin with you.” Aaron continued to struggle as Vicky moved next to him and started to feel his arms and shoulders. “Mmmm yes,” she said, “you’ll make a wonderful addition to our flock of sheep...”<br />
<br />
Aaron had no time to really process this before Vicky let out a loud whistle that echoed around the large field.<br />
<br />
You were confused by this at first until you saw a large group of sheep starting to approach. You guessed that there were perhaps 30 or more of them as they converged on Vicky from all corners of the field.<br />
<br />
Whilst this was going on, Vicky cut Aaron free from the fence and dragged him a short way towards the centre of the field. You watched in morbid fascination as the sheep started to form a ring around Vicky as they seemed to wait for her next instruction. Judging by the obedience and awareness of these animals, you guessed that all of them had once been human as well.<br />
<br />
With the sheep assembled, Vicky addressed them as if it was some sort of political rally. “Allright girls, it’s time to welcome Aaron here into your flock. I trust you can show him that his new life will be quite an enjoyable one. Now get to it, you all know what to do…”<br />
<br />
With that the crowd of sheep suddenly surged towards Aaron as Vicky waded back out through the mass of woolly bodies.Your sister and mother both cried out in dismay as Aaron’s yells of shock made it sound like he was being trampled to death. <br />
<br />
However, as your father became engulfed by the mass of ovine bodies, you soon got the sense that he had a different fate in store for him. Every now and then a scrap of clothing or a strand of rope would fly into the air as the frantic sheep continued to crowd around your father. You tried to see exactly what was going on but it was impossible through the woolly cloud that surrounded him.<br />
<br />
After maybe five minutes of this confusion, Vicky suddenly called out to them from nearby. “Alright girls, let’s get him ready for action.” The sheep seemed to understand as a wave of bleats started to echo out from amongst the crowd.<br />
<br />
However, you still weren’t able to see anything until Vicky commanded the sheep to disperse. When you realised what had happened you whinnied out in horror. Now, standing roughly where your father had been lying, was a large, horned ram!<br />
<br />
You continued to stare at the animal, although you were a bit distracted by what was happening around him. The male sheep currently had three females surrounding him, two of whom were reaching under him and licking at his cock, while the third stood behind him sucking greedily on his hefty testicles.<br />
<br />
“Bravo!” was all Vicky said as she walked over to the excited ram. She then chuckled as she removed a scrap of leather jacket from the ram’s wooly back and added it to the other scraps that littered the floor. Now you couldn’t deny what had happened; your father Aaron was now a horny ram for Vicky’s flock!<br />
<br />
You continued to stare at your father getting his dick and balls massaged until Vicky shooed the excited ewes away. “That’s enough you lot, you’ll get to play with your new ram later if you keep doing as I say.” The three sheep appeared to be visibly sad as they obediently stepped away and went to join the rest of their flock.<br />
<br />
“Now then Aaron,” Vicky said as she crouched down to stroke the tip of your father’s fully-erect cock, “why don’t we let you have some fun with your family…”<br />
<br />
With that Vicky herded Aaron over to your sister Alice. Then you couldn’t hold back a shrill whinny of despair when you saw his broad tongue flicking out over your sister’s bare arm. Having seen the process so many times now, you already knew what fate awaited your sister, and probably your mother as well…</p>
