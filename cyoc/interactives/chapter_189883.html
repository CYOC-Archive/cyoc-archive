<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The alien approaches you.<br />
&quot;The reason you&#39;ve been brought here is highly confidential, but we&#39;ll provide further details later on. For now, send the abductee to the chambers&quot;.<br />
<br />
As the alien finishes to say this, you see strange floating orbs approach you, and they grab you by your arms and legs with some kind of traction beam.<br />
You see halls and alleys pass by before you&#39;re left in a huge, empty round chamber in the deepest stretches of the ship.<br />
Hearing the aliens communicate to each other through many speakers located high up, all around the room, you can&#39;t help but fear the thought of something lurking in the apparently endless, dark space you&#39;re in.<br />
<br />
The aliens, however, have other plans, and they soon activate some small fans beneath you, deep under the metal grid you&#39;re standing on. You&#39;re mildly startled by this, but realize it&#39;s no harm at all.<br />
Or so you thought...<br />
<br />
Unknowingly to you, the fans are actually sending thousands of genetically modified, highly infectious spores towards you, and you&#39;re breathing in an obscene amount of them.<br />
The fans stop, and you expect something else to happen, but all you feel is sudden tiredness.<br />
<br />
This is explained by the microscopic changes within your body. Your cells and tissue are being restructured in the atomic level. Your carbon atoms are turning into silicon, and your smallest components are changing drastically, cells becoming highly reactive, and undoubtedly alien.<br />
<br />
You suddenly fall to the ground, sitting down as you feel strange sensations. Your legs then suddenly begin to expand and bloat, you&#39;re too dizzy to notice any of the changes, but your thighs are thickening massively, and your calves are expanding outwards into dense, bulging spheres.<br />
Your bones crunch as your legs adopt a digitigrade figure, and your toenails crack and separate as they grow wider, each one becoming thicker than one of your hands as huge, vicious claws take the place of your toenails.<br />
You scratch your new claws against the alien metal, leaving marks and lighting up sparks.<br />
Your whole body seems to expand as tubes and valves grow all over you, giving you some kind of biomechanical appearance as your whole body scales up and becomes insanely huge.<br />
<br />
Your skin starts to darken and gain a chitinous texture, just as you begin to develop some kind of insectoid exoskeleton, just as your chest barrels and expands outwards into a strong, bulky shape, although keeping a distinct sleekness, fading softly into a small, thin waist.<br />
Your arms follow as your shoulders pop outwards. Your arms receive tubes, spikes, sinew and tendons, before being covered by your new exoskeleton. They lengthen until they gain a slender, lanky appearance, although keeping a ridiculous amount of strength.<br />
Your hands soon expand outwards, your fingers lengthening and becoming leathery and ridged, with huge razor claws extending outwards, with a rather metallic appearance.<br />
<br />
The rest of your body gains more details. Spikes, ridges, and armor giving you the appearance of a rather gross insect, something akin to a cockroach with the coloring of a beetle.<br />
You feel your spine lengthening as you gain a bony, ridged tail the same length as you, and you sway it from side to side unconsciously.<br />
You grunt as you feel something move out of your legs, and soon, another pair of thick, muscular legs burst out of your own. They make their way out of your exoskeleton, and lengthen your torso backwards, your old legs gripping the ground dozens of feet behind your new legs. You got a new, long horizontal torso right where your original torso is.<br />
Your feet continue your transformation as you feel even more toes make their way out. You soon have nine digits grouped in three groups of three toes each, each one slick, bony and ridgy.<br />
<br />
Even in your daze, you groan at another unpleasant sensation beneath your arms, as a second pair of arms burst out of your carapace; the scene mimicking the gross image of a spider changing it&#39;s skin. The new pair is exactly the same as your original set of arms although slightly smaller and not as muscly.<br />
<br />
You groan in discomfort as a strange new change happens, you feel your chest pushing outwards with a heavy sensation. Sticking your chest outwards, you feel a massive pair of orbs make their way out of your skin, ending up in two massive sacks of flesh and strange alien fluids. These features also develop meaty, grotesque pitch black nipples, with ridges and veins throbbing within.<br />
<br />
Your tiny human head is now completely out of place on top of the huge, grotesque alien body beneath your neck.<br />
This soon changes as you close your eyes, splitting into many more as they gain a bright green coloration and an eerie light emits out of them.<br />
Your mouth and nose fuse together, expanding outwards into a grotesque, long maw, with engorged purple gums and barely visible lips. Your tongue lengthens considerably, and is able to stretch all the way down to your torso, becoming a gross, log slimey organ, with spikes poking out of its sides. Extremely dangerous, but harmless to you. With it, you feel how now you have hundreds of huge, dinosaur-like fangs protruding out of your mouth, and you drool acidic contents nonstop.<br />
Your respiratory system becomes vestigial, a nose unneeded as you don&#39;t even require to breathe to survive. You&#39;ve been engineered to survive the worst scenarios possible.<br />
Your eyes also fade into your increasingly mutating skull, becoming mere holes to your sides, covered in chitinous armor plates, you can now hear things that weren&#39;t possible before, and feel even the slightest change of vibrations in the air.<br />
Right at the end of your snout, you feel a massive horn expand its way out, giving you an even fiercer appearance.<br />
<br />
Your skull expands backwards, and upwards. Your head becomes akin to that of an ant queen, with what appears to be a crown sitting right where your face ends, expanding several feet to the opposite direction of your maw.<br />
Your back grows several spikes extending outwards to match the length of this new crown.<br />
<br />
You slowly regain consciousness, and notice how you&#39;re facing a strange glass pane at eye level. You assume this is where the aliens were hiding all this time, but how did you reach up here?<br />
<br />
You slowly look downwards, and let out a massive screeching roar in horror.<br />
All you see is a huge, monstrous, insect and reptile-like body, you see the gross ridges and tubes, the dangerous spikes, a massive bony tail, another set of arms, ending in lots of digits ending in powerful claw, a pair of second legs right behind your first set, with a huge, plump shiny ass, and what calls your attention the most; gross looking, leaking huge tits extending out of your chest.<br />
<br />
You snarl at the aliens knowing they did this to you, but a mysterious, shiny light appears in front of you, and you hear the alien speak to you through some kind of device.<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve brought you here to turn you into the ultimate living being, a weapon able to bring mass extinction to a whole planet. You&#39;ll regress back into your most basal instincts, and let them take control for you. You&#39;re going to be nothing else but a beast and an animal, only driven by the desire of eating, spreading your species, and eliminating every organism you encounter&quot;.<br />
<br />
You snarl as you feel your mind become foggier. You still have the control, you know deep down you&#39;re still you, but all of that doesn&#39;t matter with your new purpose. You have the need to eat and nest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Earth is a beautiful planet, full of bountiful resources, and to get access to it, we need to exterminate the dominant race first. This will be your mission. Just do what you&#39;re built to do, weapon&quot;.<br />
<br />
You roar back before you feel the ground beneath you open, and before you realize, you&#39;re now floating in the vast void of space. You&#39;ve been thrown of the ship! But it doesn&#39;t matter, you&#39;re soon picked by Earth&#39;s orbit, and you enter it&#39;s atmosphere.<br />
You&#39;re able to survive the void of space and the heat of entering Earth&#39;s atmosphere, this is nothing compared to the things you&#39;re built to face.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes, you fall somewhere in the Arctic circle like a meteorite. You crash into a frozen sea, but you&#39;re able to easily swim upwards and make your way out. You soon find yourself galloping through a frozen wasteland, moving towards a massive mountain range not far away.<br />
You don&#39;t realize how much you start to grow. Without the confines of the ship, you expand and expand further, becoming one third the size of the mountains now in front of you.<br />
<br />
With your massive pairs of hands and claws, and with the help of your frontal legs, you dig your way into the side of a mountain. The dense rock and granite being tossed aside like dirt and mud by your otherworldly strength, and you end up digging a massive cave by yourself.<br />
<br />
Once you&#39;re comfortable within the huge city sized hole you just created, you feel a strange sensation right behind your back legs, under your tail.<br />
You feel a gaping sensation, and you soon feel something gross, fat and slimey expand outwards at an alarming rate.<br />
<br />
While your new organ expands, your body secretes a strange liquid that coats the wall of the caves, and make a fleshy texture grow over them. Your cave has now been terraformed to suit your needs, and you sit down in a special made throne that just emerged from the ground. <br />
Once you&#39;re comfortable, you let your frontal legs rest as you spread your back legs. Right beneath it, sliding it&#39;s way several hundred feet in front of your body, a massive, acidic eggsack finishes forming, veiny and throbbing. It&#39;s tip gapes open, a fleshy hole that secretes an unknown, highly mutagenic liquid.<br />
<br />
You roar in delight as you start pushing something out of it, and a fleshy mass of hundreds of eggs make their way out. You can&#39;t help but grab your breasts with your smaller set of arms, the whole process feeling extremely pleasurable to your new body. You repeat the process several times, moving your eggsack like an actual limb around, leaving over a million eggs surrounding you.<br />
<br />
You pant in relief as you see your new hive. A giant cave the size of one of the biggest metropolis in the world, with fleshy growths mimicking the walls, tunnels and sections of an ant hive, and in the center of it, your throne room. You groan and screech, expressing the closest thing to happiness your monstrous being can feel.<br />
Once you arrived, you claimed this planet as your own, and it&#39;s time to make yourself known as the true Queen of the Earth.</p>
