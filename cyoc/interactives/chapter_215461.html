<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In a hushed voice, Jen began her curse. &quot;I dare you to come back in here, strip down naked, and press your pussy up against my mouth. You will want to do this and will even beg me to let you do it before hand too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then for your transformation, your body will become made of the same flexible porcelain as mine, save for the inside of your pussy, the inside of your mouth, your lips, and your tongue. Your labia and my lips will then blend together, turning the inside of mouth, and my tongue, back to normal, as it now is technically part of your pussy too. My tongue will then be made to change into a shape and size that is ideal for pleasuring us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your body from the waist up will become turned around 180 degrees, with your upper half facing away from the wall behind me. Your legs will lower behind my back, and become a comfortable backrest for me, with your perfect ass becoming a soft and comfortable neck rest for our seated users.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When someone flushes us, you will cum into my mouth, which will then cause me to also cum and squirt, clearing out my pussy bowl with a watered down mix of both of our pussy juices. Your voice will become a mix of ours, sounding like we are both speaking at the same time. And when either of us wants to speak, we will use your mouth to do so.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are able to move your upper body freely, and can even bend it down pretty low too. Low enough to give some guy a blow job, which will be one of your main functions. Your other main purpose being your double F-cups becoming my, our water reservoir for flushing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You will also continue to use me as your toilet too by the way, just not whenever someone else is using us. Wouldn&#39;t want you dropping a load on someone else&#39;s head while they themselves are trying to drop one into me.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We also will share all of our senses. Because of this, your pussy will take on different flavors depending on what you consumed the day before, with your default taste being some completely random flavor, but always great tasting. Oh, and you will gladly offer your tongue and mouth for cleaning services to any of our users too. In fact, in order to pee into us, they must let you clean them as a trade off! But they can still be allowed to choose to clean themselves if they use us for other things.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now that Jen was finished, Elizabeth barged into her stall and tore her clothes off. &quot;Please let me become part of you Jen!&quot; She started desperately begging. Jen smirked and allowed it. <br />
<br />
Elizabeth happily climbed onto of Jen, standing on the sides of her pussy bowl as she pressed her spread pussy against Jen&#39;s face, sealing her pussy lips and Jen&#39;s oral lips together. Jen felt her tongue lengthen, then split at the tip so that she could reach every nook and cranny.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth then detached her upper torso and rotated it around, before reattached it. Looking down, she now fully understood just how amazing looking of an ass she really had. She knew it was nice, but not to this extent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, so this is what you and your classmates were talking about this entire time. Like holy fuck, when did I get this perfect of an ass? Has it always been like this?&quot; Asked Elizabeth as Jen&#39;s voice began speaking in sync with it.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth then felt her mouth begin to move, and speak without he control. &quot;Its been like that ever since you started working here. Why else do you think people would spank and pinch it so often?&quot; Answered Jen. <br />
<br />
Elizabeth thought about how for weeks now, she was subjected to having her ass touched by just about everyone, be it student or staff, at their whim. And how she was oddly perfectly fine with it too. &quot;Hey, now that I think about it, it&#39;s kind of weird right? How people just touch my ass without even asking for permission?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, it is kinda unusual, but I can&#39;t say that it isn&#39;t pretty much part of the norm by now. Your ass has always been as much public property as we are currently. At least, from what I can remember. But it&#39;s a little interesting as to why is it only your ass that this applies to? What about my ass? It&#39;s almost as good, and yet no one touches it unless I allow them to. So why is yours literally up for grabs? I honestly never even thought about it until now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth regained control over her mouth and continued with their conversation. &quot;Yeah, it&#39;s kinda weird, but also just what is normal around here too. Like I don&#39;t want people to stop doing it, as it doesn&#39;t bother me, and I like the compliments. But it&#39;s just... strange is all. It just logically doesn&#39;t make sense, kind of like there&#39;s a piece missing from the puzzle. Anyways, it&#39;s kinda weird having you speak with my mouth, but in like, a really good linda way? If that makes sense?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I agree, It feels so nice to speak with your mouth.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey... can I try something real quick?&quot; Asked Elizabeth. Jen had a feeling of what it was, and agreed right away. Elizabeth blushed heavily as she bent down and poked both of Jen&#39;s button nipples simultaneously. She then let out a loud, long, gasping moan as she and Jen were flushed. And to their surprise, they both observed through Elizabeth&#39;s eyes how her tits rapidly shrank until she was perfectly flat-chested. <br />
<br />
&quot;Holy fuck, what happened to my tits?&quot; Asked Elizabeth once her insanely pleasurable, 10 seconds long, contolinuous orgasm finally concluded. They then felt something kick on inside of Elizabeth as water began filling her tits back out until they were once again at their proud size of double F-cups. <br />
<br />
Jen began cleaning their connected pussy mouth once the torrent of water and Elizabeth&#39;s cum subsided, making sure she cleaned out every last lingering drop from every fold. This in tern filled up her pussy bowl a little bit, so that there was now a bit of liquid in the bottom.<br />
<br />
As the porcelain spread further up, now turning Jen almost completely white, save for her head, and starting with Elizabeth&#39;s flattened feet, blending them into Jen&#39;s porcelain back, the two ladies finally felt truely connected as one single unit. <br />
<br />
Something in their connected body then changed without them noticing, and they began speaking more naturally in the plural tense about themselves, using we instead of I, us instead me, and our instead of my. And using singular tense words for when they spoke about themselves as a single entity.<br />
<br />
 They also came up with a new name when referring to themselves together as a single individual, and not their individual halves, Elen, or Elizabeth and Jen combined and shortened greatly. It was easier for them both to consider themselves as being one in this situation too.<br />
<br />
So while Elen waited for their next user, they went back to their previous discussions about weird happenings without any significant cause or reason behind them. It was Elizabeth who brought themselves into the debate. &quot;So, are we another unexplained happening? I mean, I know there is a whole ordeal about people becoming public facilities, but I can&#39;t think of anyone else, nor can I recall this ever being a discussion either. But I also know that this is just how things have always been, for some reason. So we are also weird, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm now that you mention it, we are now just a toilet after all. We even function like one too. And yet we are still human, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know? Are we human? We are slowly turning into flexible, hollow porcelain shells. We may look human in shape, but we are not even close when it comes to our physical make up. It&#39;s hard to say.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elen thought for a while longer about this, before she spoke up. &quot;We feel human at least, so let&#39;s just say we are a porcelain human who is also a toilet for the time being?&quot;<br />
<br />
There was no reply as it wasn&#39;t needed. Elen knew what they believed and had already agreed with themselves. Content with her decision, Elen began playing with herself, flushing several times, as she waited for her next user to come into her stall.</p>
