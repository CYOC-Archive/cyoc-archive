<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was some days later that I was called and asked to come to the main office of Sunrise Retirement Village. Ushered in quickly I was led to the downstairs basement level where I'd never been before. There I was offered a seat in a room with a large projection televison placed at one end of the room. Other than one row of six chairs it was me, the television and that was it in the room.<br />
<br />
Seated there the lights slowly dimmed and the television began to play a video. <br />
<br />
In some lousey black and white it was a security camera shot of my son Richard coming up on the front porch of the retirement village office.<br />
<br />
It panned after him jumping from one camera to the next as he stood at the front reception desk, then walking to an office.<br />
<br />
As Richard sat inside an office the camera only showed him and not the other person who was with him. Although the video was poor the audio portion was excellent.<br />
<br />
Richard was talking with Frank, the general manager. I watched and listened as he voiced his soft hearted concern over my, my mental state! He told Frank of what I had mentioned to him of the lottery investigater and what Sid had reported to have happened making a man into a bull. His recounting of my story and the concerns I had for Mary and my safety went out his mouth in perfect succession.<br />
<br />
I listened in horror as my son made the suggestion his father was having signs of dementia. <br />
<br />
As Richard talked on there came a knock to the door and rushing in were two of Frank's special goon squad guards. They pounced on Richard cuffing him in seconds and then taking him away. The camera scene shifted to inside what I expected to be barn seven.<br />
<br />
My finger nails dug into the leather chair's armrest as I saw the scene unfold before me. Richard, my son was stripped naked and strapped to a stainless steel exam table like those I saw once at a mortuary. Those tables layed a person flat out but this one stood Richard up and made him face the camera.<br />
<br />
Awake but unable to speak or move I saw the terror and fear in the eyes of my only son. The arms and hands of a man came into view as injections were poked into Richard's neck, while some were placed into the chest muscles. <br />
<br />
it was a voice of some man I'd never heard before explain to Richard of plans to make my son into something his father would be very proud to be around. He recanted Richard's story that he told of what I told and had heard from Sid. He laughed as he worked and told the story till as Richard passed out and his head fell limp, the man said, &quot;Soon my young man your father will be carring for you as he did once! although, to care for you now will be quite different, take him away!&quot; <br />
<br />
The next scene was of Richard spralled out on some cot in a dim lit cell. As I watched my son awoke and moved very slowly to a sitting position on the cot. He held his hands to his face and head as if having some pains. I sat there on the edge of my seat watching as Richard looked up at the camera.<br />
<br />
Falling back into my chair I was horrified to see the face of my son to be distorted horribly. His nostrils were flared wide and his face and cheeks seemed broader. He had two bumps of fair size jutting out from the temples of his head, as he continued to rub them with his hands.<br />
<br />
It was as he turned his head I saw a neck which looked heavy of muscle and massive compared to the neck of a grown man. I groaned my fears seeing the ears of my son having become pointed and sprouting sideways outward from his head in some wierd growth.<br />
<br />
The video now flicked from scene to scene as the beginning changes enveloped my son. His head was the first to change becoming larger and squared of form like the head of a male bovine. The bumps grew ou as horns from his temples, while the ears became totally bovine in form and movements.<br />
<br />
Richard's face as was his head all bovine and this made him eat and drink like the animal. <br />
<br />
I saw scenes of his back and shoulders conforming to bovine shape as his pink skin sprouted red and white hairs of a Hereford bull. The hair seemed to offer him some odd satisfaction as his stiffening hands often petted himself and made my son moo in delight.<br />
<br />
Richard in one scene was rubbing his hairy rump agains the back wall of his cell. He was bent over forward as his arms had by this scene become full formed forelegs and cloven hoove of a Hereford breed of bull.<br />
<br />
It was as I suspected he was feeling the growth out of his bovine tailbone and as the camera angles changed the view was of a boney appendage covered in red hair.<br />
<br />
My son was because of me telling him of what I suspected to be true now finding out it was not my dementia, but truth of what I spoke. Little comfort was this to me as I sat there for the better part of two hours watching my only son change into a Hereford bull.<br />
<br />
The video stopped for a second leaving me in the total blackness of that room. Then it flickered and came on showing what I expected to be Richard being led from his cell to a stall in some barn. Once in his cell he was questioned by that man who's voice I did not ever hear before.<br />
<br />
It was as if the man wanted Richard to remain alert to human speaking even if the ability to speek was not his anymore. Pawing one foreleg my son answered the questions offered with yes and no movements.<br />
<br />
Then as if a time of reward he was ushered out of the barn to a corral pen holding not less than a dozen cows. Ordered by the man to Richard that he begin to learn his duties in life and make pregnant these tweleve cows, Richard bellowed his obvious disgust.<br />
<br />
Left then to be as he was the camera watched and so had to myself while the scents and inbred instincts of bovine life slowly took hold on my son's will and mind.<br />
<br />
Mounting and humping the cows the bull stood his ground and by the time the tenth one had been mated Richard bellowed his bovine delights. I watched in absolute terror as my only son was changed and then mentally degraded into some lowly state. His manner in which he mounted the first cow's rump showing his own worry over doing what was being urged upon him by hios bodily drives. His easy entry into the cow with a long narrow prick of a penis, and then as her vaginal muscles grabbed him I saw his demeanor change.<br />
<br />
Little by little Richard with each mounting of another cow was slowly but actually accepting his sexual pleasure forgetting his human morals and life. as he went to the eleventh cow I watched as he sniffed her wrinkled cunt, then reaching his head forward that thick pink tongue licked away her vagina juices.<br />
<br />
A bellowing sound of delight and triumph roared out of his mouth. Then he bounced on to her back and wiggled his massive self forward. The security camera at this point was adjusted by the guard watching and telafocused in on Richard's bovine cockhead as it spread the cow's cunt lips and entered her damed body.<br />
<br />
Thrusting up close I had a ringside seat at the mating of bull and cow. I'd seen in done from a far distance but this had me captivated from some deep seeded desire as a male of our species.<br />
<br />
The video stopped and the lights in the room came on brightly as Frank walked in and stood before the screen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well how did you like our little flick? Interesting seeing one of your own children pay the price for knowing too much about my money making scheme! Sid and you will be watched and if any further problems arise I'm sure we can find a more worthy place for you to help make this farm business more profitable, now go home and consider what you have done!&quot; said Frank to me as I sat there in tears.</p>
