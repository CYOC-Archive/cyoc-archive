<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Twenty minutes later, Oscar was whimpering and milling around the yard in circles, shivering with his tail between his legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe it, I just fucked a dog!&quot; he thought, drooping his ears low and looking back at the greyhound who was probably now carrying his puppies. She looked rather contented, but seemed a little confused that her mate was so distraught.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did they do this to me?&quot; he thought, looking over his greyhound body yet again. He could smell his own doggy scent ... hardly different from Starlight&#39;s, except that he was male. His ears perked up when he heard the back door open.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on in boy,&quot; called Kat from inside. He tucked his long tail even more tightly underneath himself in distress. He was terrified to go back in with her, but he was also terrified to disobey her. Head bowed and ears flat, he cautiously paced his way back into the house.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great job, stud!&quot; Kat mocked and patted her fresh victim on the back. The skinny dog jumped. He cautiously made his way back into the living room.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Dan had been trying unsuccessfully to quiet down his urges. He had been trying anything to distract himself. He even found himself deliberately sniffing around the floor and furniture like the dog he didn&#39;t want to admit he now was, just so he would have something else to think about. It didn&#39;t help at all. Everywhere he sniffed, was the smell of sex. His canine nose and body just weren&#39;t going to let him rest until he fulfilled his primal drives.<br />
<br />
So when Oscar came sulking in from his girlfriend&#39;s kitchen, he walked right into Dan&#39;s line of sight. They locked eyes, and Dan had exactly one thing on his mind. Oscar broke eye contact and looked to the side in shame; he thought this other dog was now judging him. &quot;Even dogs know what I did,&quot; he thought, mentally weeping. Dan couldn&#39;t have cared less about Oscar&#39;s little escapades in the backyard except that the animal in front of him looked so submissive and still smelled so damn inviting. He made a bee-line for the dog&#39;s crotch and sucked in the odors still hanging on around the triangular gray sheath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck it!&quot; thought Dan. &quot;I&#39;m a dog, he&#39;s a dog, he came here for sex anyway, I&#39;m going for it!&quot; And with that he jumped up with his front paws on Oscar&#39;s back. Oscar yelped and looked back and tried to get away, but Dan growled and brought his weight down even more forcefully onto the pitiful-looking greyhound. Oscar was too humiliated by everything else already to even bother trying to resist this new embarrassment, and Dan in his new form actually looked pretty intimidating. So the dog who had been a ravenous ladies&#39; man not even an hour earlier found himself on the underside of an uncontrollably horny rottweiler.<br />
<br />
Kat and Selena, hearing the commotion, came back in and saw what was going on. As far as they were concerned, it could not have been more perfect. &quot;What&#39;s the matter Oscar? Didn&#39;t get enough back there? Had to try it from the other side?&quot; Kat mocked. Selena just laughed hysterically.<br />
<br />
Oscar just stood there motionless as Dan thrust himself right into his ass. Only Dan and Kat knew that Dan had been human, and that he had secretly been slightly bisexual. Of course, Dan and Oscar were both so new to being sexually mature dogs with a snout for pheromones that this was all pretty much inevitable.<br />
<br />
Dan&#39;s dog body finally received its orgasm and his insanity started to die down. He found he was still a little bit stuck but he remembered Oscar&#39;s erection and figured out what was up. &quot;So that&#39;s what that swollen part was for,&quot; he thought.<br />
<br />
Oscar whimpered a little bit, trying to process all that happened. He was used to manipulating women, now these two women and this dog seemingly had more power over him than he had over his numerous booty calls combined. He could not yet even comprehend being brought down this state, but the sensations from his body were forcing him to accept the reality of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Disgusting, I&#39;m filled up with dog cum,&quot; he thought to himself, and then thought back to his experience with Starlight. &quot;Eww, I actually MADE dog cum,&quot; he reminded himself.<br />
<br />
Oscar whimpered and tried to pull away. Dan growled again. They were going to have to wait.<br />
<br />
Kat was thrilled to see Dan following his instincts like an actual dog. Selena was thrilled to see Oscar be powerless over a sexual situation for once. She looked at his wiry greyhound form and mocked him some more. &quot;Poor Oscar,&quot; she said. &quot;Couldn&#39;t find anyone thinner than you to score with this time, I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
At last, the once-human canines separated. Oscar went over and whined like a wimp. Kat snapped her fingers and he fell into a deep sleep. Dan just followed his instincts a little ways further and licked his own crotch, mentally filing away the smell of Oscar and his own seed. Kat patted Selena on the back and thought about how to use her powers next.</p>
