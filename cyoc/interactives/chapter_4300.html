<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Now the english like their dragons and one particular workshop had <br />
<br />
just sculpted 2956 dragon figurines of a product line called the <br />
<br />
Dragon Clan of Brimstone Mountain.There were males,females,eggs,<br />
<br />
hatchlings,juveniles,warriors,artists,craftsmen ,wizards,criminals<br />
<br />
and everything in between.It was an entire community done up as <br />
<br />
dragon figurines.<br />
<br />
And all these 2956 figurines needed a particular shade of pigment <br />
<br />
whic that ballpoint pen matched perfectly in order to do the scales<br />
<br />
the slitted pupil of the eyes,the black sharp talons ,the spiky row <br />
<br />
of venomous spines on the backbone and other finishing touches.Judy <br />
<br />
felt herself bleeding to death as the artists took her apart and<br />
<br />
mixed her ink into the paint pots and applied her essense onto 2956<br />
<br />
figurines.She lost conciousness and died three days before she was <br />
<br />
supposed to return to human form.Her last death though was to<br />
<br />
curse Carrie ,<br />
<br />
The Dracyn staff loaded the production run into boxes and the <br />
<br />
boxes were loaded into a railcar,along with a shipment going<br />
<br />
to a hardware store.The car was added to the back of  a train and<br />
<br />
steamed out of  Seacarts.Now world events were slowly <br />
<br />
conspiring to bring Judy's rebirth a very good thing.It<br />
<br />
just so happens that the train had to pass through a desolate <br />
<br />
deep valley over the river Skye,and at the front of the train were <br />
<br />
10 passenger cars carrying the 8:00 commuter passengers<br />
<br />
out of  Glasgow.There had been rumours of a renewed<br />
<br />
Al Quaida offensive for months,and what no one knew <br />
<br />
was that the bridge over the riveer was rigged with explosive<br />
<br />
set to go off at midnight.Judy had ceased being human at 1:00 am <br />
<br />
two weeks previous.It was a dark and stormy night and lightening<br />
<br />
was starting to build up.At midnight the bridge and tracks blew<br />
<br />
and the train went off the tracks.Some cars plunged into the<br />
<br />
river hundreds of feet below,some dangled from the edge of <br />
<br />
the bridge,swaying and dangling by their couplings.Others lay on <br />
<br />
their sides in the waterfilled ditch,whilst the last car in the train <br />
<br />
sat unscathed on the tracks.All around were the screams of injured and<br />
<br />
dying humans,and the smell of burnt flesh,blood and diesel was everywhere.<br />
<br />
<br />
At one oclock,the world went haywire.off in another part of the world a bracelet<br />
<br />
glowed red as it brought Judy back to life.But there were 2956 Judy's now,and<br />
<br />
they had porcelain scales,horns and teeth.In boxes of that last railcar 2956<br />
<br />
pairs of lungs began to breath from forming lungs,2956 hearts began to beat.<br />
<br />
2956 tiny bodies rippled with scale,flesh bone and muscle.2956 throats coughed up <br />
<br />
spatters of flame as hot as a pootery kiln.2956 pairs of paws flexed talons as sharp<br />
<br />
as slivers of glass,2956 bodies clinked as thick armoured plates over their<br />
<br />
stomachs were as strong as roofing tile.As the boxes around them turned into a blazing <br />
<br />
inferno the simple minds of 2956 dragon warriors,mages,infants,eggs,mages,mothers,<br />
<br />
daughters,fathers,sons,artists,craftsmen stirred into life.Judy went from nothingness to<br />
<br />
blackness a nd then on a heart throbbing Saturn V booster ride as her conciousness<br />
<br />
multiplied 2956 times.And split into 2956 fragments.<br />
<br />
Their eyes opened and they squawked and hissed and bellowed and roared as<br />
<br />
they becamee sentient and aware of the PURPOSE.<br />
<br />
They had bled to death.A hairless scaleless mammal had killed them.The warriors<br />
<br />
remembered the war.The clan remembered the war.2956 dragons got to work.They<br />
<br />
had to kill the mammals.Their first thoughts were directed by Judys<br />
<br />
last dying thoughts.Even though the railcar was blazing hot,they ignored it.They had <br />
<br />
been fired in pottery kilns and were not normal flesh and blood.Scales of stone,<br />
<br />
talons of glass and wings strengthened with fibers like a mesh in concrete.<br />
<br />
While the warriors chanted,they broke out the weapons,carving knives<br />
<br />
files,nails and other items from the hardware store shipment.<br />
<br />
Eveyone wanted to kill the humans right away,but the generals <br />
<br />
said the clan had to get the pregnant mothers,eggs and newborns<br />
<br />
to a safe place first.And they needed more supplies and a retreat.So the <br />
<br />
craftsmen and mages forced an opening through to the outside while <br />
<br />
admiring  british rail technology.The dragons cleared out surrounding <br />
<br />
compartments of ammunition and other goods which delighted the <br />
<br />
warriors and craftsmen.They also found promotional material on<br />
<br />
the Dragon Clan of Brimstone  Mountain,which pleased the High Priests<br />
<br />
greatly,as they were already thinking there had to be a higher purpose to life<br />
<br />
then killing two legged mammals.But they found themselves unable to<br />
<br />
express these thoughts,so strong  a hold on their mind was the will of the Goddess Judy<br />
<br />
who they could not see but sensed within them.<br />
<br />
An hour after their birth 3000 pairs of reptillian eyes gazed down on the <br />
<br />
screaming humans from a nearby rocky crag.The railcar was now a empty <br />
<br />
burnt out shell and 44 mothers had already laid new eggs.Things were<br />
<br />
settling down and Judy slowly became aware that she was pumping his seed <br />
<br />
into a receptive female as he roared and flapped his wings and twitched<br />
<br />
his tail.He was puzzling over why he was worth  $350 at Kmart <br />
<br />
and 150 pounds at McTavishs.She was nipping her male self as the warriors <br />
<br />
did a hissing chanting war dance around a flickering juice box and it lay<br />
<br />
curled,blissfully unaware of the world while it formed in its egg.<br />
<br />
Then she felt an intense pain as mother 45 pushed her egg out<br />
<br />
of her birth canal and a good chunk of Judys fragmented mind came back together <br />
<br />
in that new mother.As she did so the PURPOSE slammed into her mind and <br />
<br />
out of about  1000 others.Dragon generals,warriors,mages and priests stumbled in mid thought <br />
<br />
as their Goddess left them.They all stared at the young mother and waited<br />
<br />
for her will.<br />
<br />
Judy slowly came back to her senses and realized there was a warm sticky<br />
<br />
egg bumping into her wiggling tail.As she realized she had been about to send<br />
<br />
an army of  dragon munchkin killers out into the world,Carrie really didn't<br />
<br />
seem so important anymore as what she had just gained.<br />
<br />
2900 pairs of slitted eyes bliked as the group thought formed on the<br />
<br />
aethernet they all shared.A steak knife to the eyes,a primed shotgun<br />
<br />
shell in the mouth,a plague of locusts,&lt;MY EGG WILL BE PLEASED<br />
<br />
TO SERVE THE WILL OF THE GODDESS JUDY&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;STOP THAT&gt;<br />
<br />
Judy thought and was kind of annoyed as various parts of  herself were <br />
<br />
listening in.Oh well,there has to be a price for being a super being,a deity.<br />
<br />
Down below the humans still wailed,and frankly it looked like hell down there.<br />
<br />
So she gave herself a  new purpose and sent out one additional thought<br />
<br />
&lt;Make the so and so's pay for our services.<br />
<br />
Afterwards humans told of how little dragons flew in with twine and cloth and <br />
<br />
safety pins,and how some would apply leaves and oils while others <br />
<br />
applied tourniques,put stones under metal to steady wreckage and <br />
<br />
doused flames with bucket brigades which flew in styrofoam cups of water <br />
<br />
from the river below.This went all night and soon some of the human <br />
<br />
survivors were able to help themselves.<br />
<br />
There were also tales of tiny dragons pulling out wallets from trapped victims they'd <br />
<br />
just saved and pulling out and flying away with 100 pound notes,money orders<br />
<br />
and jewellry.<br />
<br />
Finally it all came down to that run of cars near the edge of the<br />
<br />
bridge that were ready to plunge into the river below.Humans were too weak or incapable of <br />
<br />
rescuing anybody from those cars.The bridge was starting to groan and sway <br />
<br />
and Judy knew that soon that bridge would collapse,She decided to put her<br />
<br />
new powers to the test.She sent out a new purpose over the aethernet.<br />
<br />
We've got to save the mammals in those cars.How?<br />
<br />
2956  minds thought over the problem.It was the high Priests <br />
<br />
who came up with the solution.We once were like clay.Clay can be pressed together<br />
<br />
and reformed and remolded to make something bigger.Perhaps the mages<br />
<br />
know a merging spell.Soon all the dragons flew back to the retreat.<br />
<br />
500 of the sons and daughters,as well as the increasing supply of eggs<br />
<br />
were left as a reserve to protect the clan should  something go wrong.<br />
<br />
All the rest advanced towards Judy,whose mind sat in that of the new mother.<br />
<br />
Then they pushed in together and Judy bellowed in pain as she felt her kidneys pull out <br />
<br />
of her body and merge with the kidney of her neighbour,That kidney then absorbed<br />
<br />
another kidney and so on and so on.Kidney sought kidney.Heart sought heart.<br />
<br />
Brain sought brain and vertebrae sought vertebrae.There was a cracking<br />
<br />
crunching squishing spelching sound as Judys new body slowly rose over <br />
<br />
the squirming wriggling mass of  merging munchkins.Then it was done.<br />
<br />
The Goddess Judy towered over her 500 remaining  supplicants 30 feet<br />
<br />
at her shoulders and 150 feet from the tip of her tail to the  end<br />
<br />
of her toothy snout.They and her were kind of surprised,there was<br />
<br />
a lot more mass here then could have been supplied<br />
<br />
by about seven tons on munchkins,but what is the purpose of a Goddess but to<br />
<br />
supply her followers with miracles.<br />
<br />
She felt very dragonic and reared up on her hind legs,spread her wings wide and<br />
<br />
roared as she spat a flame as hot as that of a pottery kiln into the air,<br />
<br />
Then she got ready to save the world.Visions of the awe and fear she<br />
<br />
would inspire from the mammals made her grunt and gloat and drip big <br />
<br />
steaming globs of saliva onto the ground.<br />
<br />
However,the miracle was not to be.Just as she leapt into the air<br />
<br />
and circled the bridge,the tortured coupling  screeched and broke <br />
<br />
and the cars with screaming humans plunged,as if in slow motion,into the river<br />
<br />
far below.One second there was screaming,the next dead silence.<br />
<br />
The shock went through the giant dragoness like a thunderbolt <br />
<br />
and Judys body and mind fragmented .<br />
<br />
Soon there were about 2456 munchkins winging about in confusion and slowly<br />
<br />
drifting away.<br />
<br />
The next morning saw Judy back in her mother dragon body,the shock having worn off,<br />
<br />
Strays were still winging in,and she was a bit disconcerted to find she now had <br />
<br />
3200 dragon munchkins to tend to.She was breeding like a rabbit,and at this <br />
<br />
rate she'd have to give serious consideration to world conquest.</p>
