<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen panicked, she didn&#39;t word the curse right, and now her mother was missing. She realized what she had done, but as she was panicking she was called by her mother, she heard her mother&#39;s voice, but something was different, she was... nicer? Jen&#39;s mind shifted, the reality of her situation changed, and she forgot that she had cursed Kyle at all. The curse was not made for killing, and it had a role to fulfill, so it gave Kyle what Jen described, but it adjusted the original versions of the targets so they were less problematic, and adjusted reality so that they never were a problem. But for Kyle, the changes to his reality were drastic, and overwhelming.<br />
<br />
Kyle stood mouth agape as he stared at the new bodies in his room, the curse had gone wrong, horribly wrong. He saw not one, but three new bodies in his room, and only one of them was female, Kyle felt the new bodies as if he always owned them, and started to explore, against his conscious will, they automatically started to move. Kyle couldn&#39;t help himself as he looked at the name badges on his new bodies.<br />
<br />
The men were named Randal and Kevin Hodges, knowledge of who they were hit him, twins, age 25, how were known to be sex pests at the bank, having made unwanted advances to several women, including the woman&#39;s body he now possessed. Jessica Smith, age 40, Kyle shivered at the name, this was Jen&#39;s mom, and now he controlled her. He looked back at himself, and tried to say something through her voice, but wasn&#39;t able to, maybe he could later, but not right now, they were his new bodies after all. <br />
<br />
The Hodges brothers were of similar builds, both lean, fit, fashion model style, they were both a foot taller than Kyle. They were both dressed in a white button down shirt, with red tie, black slacks and dress shoes. Their faces were handsome, square jawed, blue eyes, their hair worn in a side part fade, the only thing that didn&#39;t match was their hair color, one dark brown, the other died black.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Smith was fit as well, but showed signs of her motherhood and age, having a hourglass figure, and a bit of flab, she was by all definitions a milf, with a generous F cup bust. She was dressed in a blazer, dark maroon, a white undershirt, and a knee length matching skirt, with a matching pair of four inch heels, and flesh tone pantyhose. Her face was beautiful, like a runway model, with piercing green eyes, and shoulder length wavy blonde hair. Kyle felt awkward about her, he&#39;d never touched a woman before, and now he was feeling her body as it was his own.<br />
<br />
He hesitated for a minute, trying to wrap his head around the new feelings but the bodies started to strip, not propelled by the curse but by his own whims, Kyle reluctantly followed suit, feeling himself get horny at the thought of what he needed to to. He walked over to the bed and lay on it, already rock hard he waited as Jessica&#39;s body walked over and unceremoniously mounted him, laying on top of him and smothering his face with her breasts. He thought this was good but he then saw and felt his two other bodies move into position, one grabbed her hips and pushed is ample cock into her ass, and the other got on the bed and moved into position, aiming his cock right at Jessica&#39;s mouth. <br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t you dare.” Were the first words that Kyle uttered out of her mouth as the cock was shoved into it. She began sucking, involuntarily as Kyle found himself moving them under his will and began fucking himself through them. He screamed, not in fear but ecstasy, muffled by her breasts, he found himself in the middle of his own personal gang bang. He felt her body heating up and a moan escaped the mouths of the two brothers as they thrust into each other under Kyle&#39;s command. He couldn&#39;t help himself, he knew these weren&#39;t his bodies, but they were, and he needed this. In the heat of the moment he felt her climax, the three male bodies moaned together, as Jessica swallowed the cum, it&#39;s salty taste hitting them but he couldn&#39;t help but continue, their combined sex drives pushing him to continue. <br />
<br />
After two more orgasms they all finally collapsed, panting and moaning. Out of all four mouths came the same sentence.<br />
<br />
“Oh god.... what am I going to do?” They lay there on top of each other and panting, after a while he finally got his bodies to move again, he started examining all of them, taking stock of his new anatomies, he caressed Jessica&#39;s breasts and even touched and groped the men&#39;s cocks. <br />
<br />
“Like what you see?” One of them asked. <br />
<br />
“Of course I do, it&#39;s mine after all.” Kyle smiled. <br />
<br />
“We need a shower.” Kyle said through the other. <br />
<br />
Kyle got up and started down the hall, but found his other bodies following him closely. He turned around, “We do this one at a time.” Kyle said to them, but no response, Kyle continued down the hall, a little faster as the bodies kept pace and he tried to close the door behind him but Jessica pushed the door against him, and made her way in. “Look, I need some privacy.” He tried to reason with them, the bodies looked back at him blankly as he saw a view of his panicked self through their eyes. He turned and made his way into the shower, and found that they followed him, piling in to the shower, which was larger than before, against his wishes and started the shower for him. <br />
<br />
Kyle freaked out, trying to stop them, but he found himself groped and scrubbed by the three of them, following his normal routine in the shower and found himself moving to clean them too. He couldn&#39;t stop himself, even if he wanted to, they were like body parts, they would go where he would go. When it came time to clean Jessica, he felt all six of his male hands all over her, and it turned him on again, this time he was caught between her and one of his male unable or unwilling to resist he found himself in Smith&#39;s pussy again, but one of the brothers had mounted him in the ass, pinned between the two and with the other mounting from behind he shouted at his bodies. “Stop! We already did this!” But he couldn&#39;t stop himself or his other selves, his perverted tendencies were translated into them, and he found himself fucking with all of his bodies again. Awkwardly grinding his own ass with one of his new cocks, kissing his neck and sucking on one of her tits, feeling the other man kissing her on the neck as well he cam again, the bodies shivered with excitement. <br />
<br />
Kyle panted through all four of them, slightly disturbed by his inability to control himself, he finished washing her and cleaning her pussy, getting a slight buzz from the touch. Kyle, slightly disturbed by his inability do control himself, got out of the shower along with his three other selves, and dried all of them off. Combing each bodies hair and finding his bodies playfully touching him and each other, messages and kisses on the neck, as they got done. Kyle walked out to the living room, his mom would be at work until five, and the four bodies followed, he sat they sat down automatically as he went to the kitchen and got food for all four bodies. <br />
<br />
Something strange was happening here, and he was getting creeped out to say the least. He handed the plates to each one, and they said thank you to him, he froze. Was he talking to himself or....<br />
<br />
“Oh, we&#39;re you honey.” Said his female self.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, we&#39;re just part of your brain, what you think you&#39;d actually have full control over all of out movements.” The dark haired male said.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, no one can do that, but we are kinda under your command.” The black haired male said. Kyle sat down, dazed and worried.<br />
<br />
“Oh don&#39;t be scared honey.” Said his female self. “We&#39;re going to enjoy being together... a lot.” She cooed. Kyle shivered, what was he going to do?<br />
<br />
“But... I need to have some privacy.” Kyle stammered.<br />
<br />
“But we are you.” The black haired male said.<br />
<br />
“No you&#39;re not!” Kyle yelled at him.<br />
<br />
“Well we are now, you&#39;re just going to have to live with it.” Said the other male. Kyle stared at him, horrified with the revelation that he&#39;d never be completely alone again. “Hey, don&#39;t go so dark, you&#39;ve got you&#39;re own little gang bang here. And no one can ever experience this kind of pleasure.” <br />
<br />
“But what about …&#39;<br />
<br />
“Sleeping? We sleep together, a nice big cuddle pile. We&#39;ll even keep you at the center.” Jessica said. Kyle whimpered. “For now, we stick with you. We&#39;re not ready to multi task like you&#39;re thinking yet.” <br />
<br />
“Yeah, imagine having four different points of view doing four different things, we&#39;re not ready for that yet.” The black haired male said. <br />
<br />
“Can I at least complete a sentence please?” Kyle sighed.<br />
<br />
“Yeah.” The three of them said.<br />
<br />
“What are we called? We can&#39;t all just be Kyle.” He asked.<br />
<br />
“Kyle R” Randal&#39;s body said proudly.<br />
<br />
“Kyle K” Kevin&#39;s body said.<br />
<br />
“Kayla.” Jessica&#39;s body said.<br />
<br />
“Can we at least not fuck so much?” Kyle whimpered.<br />
<br />
“No.” The three of them said. <br />
<br />
“And at this point we&#39;re pretty much just masturbating, we know ourselves, this is hot.” Kyle R said. Kyle whimpered, the three of them got up having finished their food and took his plate from his hands. “Hey don&#39;t!&#39; Kyle shouted, he was picked up by the men, then sat on Kayla&#39;s lap, wrapped in a hug and the men gave him the remote, and started feeding him.<br />
<br />
“You are the king here. The main Kyle, the man! And we will treat you like a king, and please your every desire.” They said in chorus, Kayla reached down and caressed his cock making it hard. “We are here for your pleasure.” Kyle shivered as Kayla whispered in his ear. “Don&#39;t worry honey, we&#39;ll keep you satisfied, no more need for lonely Saturday nights, no more need for hentai, or a date with a tissue box, just us from now on, now relax, and let us take care of us.”<br />
<br />
Kyle reluctantly gave in, worried about how his future would be, he sat there, watching tv with all four of his eyes the bodies occasionally stroking off. Kyle accepted his fate as the center of this four way, but still wanted to do more with it than fuck himself. After a few weeks....</p>
