<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gathering the Michelle and Michael proved easier than Marvin had thought. The two energetic seven year olds happily jumped into their SUV as Deanna jumped behind the wheel. As Marvin pulled out of his driveway he instructed Deanna to follow him closely and to keep the speed limit, at her current age no one would believe her license.<br />
<br />
“So Amanda,” he asked. “I’m guessing you have an idea.”<br />
<br />
Amanda nodded as she examined the iPad Michelle and Mikey had. Thankfully computers were second nature to her at this point, with a couple of quick inputs into the system she was able to create a dummy profile that would clear Marvin and Deanna. “Okay,” she said. “Basically what I’ve done is falsify their report. Right now it looks like they interviewed you about what you may have seen when you left last night. The report will say you saw nothing. Since the video feed from the parking garage will only show your car leaving you should be in the clear.”<br />
<br />
“Well,” Marvin said thoughtfully. “That takes care of the report but what about those two?”<br />
<br />
Amanda looked back to where Deanna was driving as she thought about Michelle and Michael. “I say we turn them into infants and leave them at a hospital,” she said flatly. “After that we ditch the car in a commuter lot and make it look abandoned.”<br />
<br />
Marvin frowned as he listened, robbing someone of their lives didn’t sit well with him. As he turned onto the main road he noticed several restaurants, an idea slowly forming. “I have an idea,” he said. “But first, can the chronovac blank someone’s mind, like give them amnesia or something.”<br />
<br />
“Shouldn’t be too difficult,” Amanda shrugged. <br />
<br />
“Perfect,” Marvin smiled. “Now follow my lead.” <br />
<br />
Amanda watched quietly as Marvin pulled the car into a McDonalds, as he glanced towards the back of the parking lot he could see the faintest image of two excited seven year olds cheering wildly at the thought of McDonalds. “Amanda listen,” he said. “I want you to use the Chronovac to knock those two out and then return them to their original age. While their sleeping blank their minds of the last hour or so. When they wake up they’ll think they simply fell asleep after getting lunch. If they look at the report, they’ll think they already interviewed us.”<br />
<br />
“Smart,” Amanda stated. “But I need to know, why make them adults again?”<br />
<br />
“I’m not about to take away someone’s life Amanda,” he said sadly. “That should always be a last resort. We don’t know these people and if we can assure our safety than we should let them go on their way.”<br />
<br />
Amanda opened her mouth to respond but quickly closed it. While she ay not agree with amarvins plan she respected it. If the situation was reversed she would most likely end the threat and eliminate the two agents permanently. Marvin though seemed like a kind hearted man, as long as his family was safe he would cause no harm to anyone. <br />
<br />
“Hey you two,” Deanna exclaimed. “These two are waaay to excited right now. I was going to grab them some Happy Meals to shut them up, just keep an eye on them okay?” Marvin and Deanna nodded as they exited the car and approached the SUV.<br />
<br />
Michelle and Michael were talking happily as they now sat buckled in the backseat. Still only dressed in their shirts Marvin watched as they happily drummed their bare feet against the backseats. “Deanna is getting us Happy Meals,” Michelle squealed. <br />
<br />
“Oh that’s fantastic,” Marvin smiled. “But before you two eat, you should probably get dressed.” The two Sven year olds groaned before complying with Marvin’s order. In only moments Marvin and Amanda beheld two seven year olds dressed in overly large suits. As they finished dressing Deanna arrived with the Happy Meals, which the two took, thanking Marvin and Deanna before hungrily feeding their faces.<br />
<br />
“Amanda as soon as their finished I want you to put them to sleep Okay,” he said. Amanda nodded in response as she anxiously awaited the two to finish. As the two now finished their meals Amanda activated the chronovac, watching as Michelle and Michael fell quickly to sleep. “Okay Amanda,” Marvin said. “Now just erase their memories and then age them back,”<br />
<br />
Amanda nodded as she scanned through the chronovac. Finding what she was looking for Amanda erased the two agents memories before typing in the commands to return them to their proper ages. <br />
<br />
7...8...9..<br />
<br />
Marvin smiled as he watched the two children begin to increase in size. Michelle and Michael were slowly but surely swelling towards adult hood once more. 10...11...12.. Marvin could see the two beginning to relive puberty now. Michael seemed to reliving several growth spurts as his height increased while Michelle was once more becoming a woman, slowly they could see the girls breasts beginning to form under her bluouse pushing the fabric out once more. As they watched for another few moments, they could see the two agents race through high school and enter college once more, the two agents were now back to their original size once more, their bodies and faces becoming more adult with each passing moment.<br />
<br />
“Let’s head home,” Marvin said quietly. “We don’t want to be around when these two wake up.” Deanna and Amanda nodded as they took one last look at the two agents before departing. Amanda could see that they appeared to have almost returned to their original ages as the car pulled out of the parking lot.<br />
<br />
Michelle woke with a start as she now curiously looked around the parking lot. Looking towards her partner she could see Michael was asleep. “Wha,” she grumbled rubbing her eyes. “Did we fall asleep?”<br />
<br />
Michelle now tried to rack her brain as she tried to remember what had happened. Michelle and Michael had been sent out to investigate employees from last night, after leaving the office though things became fuzzy. As she picked up her iPad she could see that they had already visited several employees, in each case their stories had checked out. “Geez must of been more tired than I thought,” she groaned. “Maybe when this is done I’ll put in for some vacation time.”<br />
<br />
As Michelle went to turn on the car she paused, situated in her lap she noticed a girls Happy Meal toy. Rubbing her head she had the faintest glimpse of a memory. A memory of a nice old man, a teenage girl, and a young kid who bought her a Happy Meal out of the kindness of their heart. The memory was fleeting though and as quickly as it came it vanished, leaving the agent with a warm feeling. Smiling Michelle now grasped the toy tightly as she pulled out of the parking lot.</p>
