<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was because of their two-year anniversary of being together that Keith gifted his girlfriend a holiday to the Atlantic beaches of France. He&#39;d managed to find a great hotel in Bordeaux, so he didn&#39;t hesitate for a single moment after having seen the incredibly low price. The hotel they were in was very luxurious for its price, and the couple stayed in this cozy place, with a single king size bed, a spacious bathroom, with both bath and shower, and even a kitchen they wouldn&#39;t use during the whole two-weeks long vacation.<br />
<br />
It was after having gone for a small morning walk, that Keith found Myra under the covers of their bed, with a laptop on her lap, which she brought with her. Keith approached and kissed her. &quot;Morning love.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning darl,&quot; he got as a reply. &quot;Keith, are you interested in horseback riding along the coastline? They&#39;re offering it .&quot; She probably read that from her laptop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it guided?&quot; Keith asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It depends.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith was taking off his shoes, but looked up on what it depended. He got his answer fairly quickly, as Myra continued her answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;It depends on if you&#39;ve had previous experience of horseback riding in the past 6 months, or if you&#39;ve completed a course that got you a license.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, then we&#39;re lucky,&quot; Keith replied, remembering his first few rides only a few months ago, after his girlfriend, kept insisting. Besides, she had a license herself, so she was good to go. &quot;When do you want to go Myra?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, today&#39;s a good day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll get ready, how long will it take to ride there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s 10 bucks for every hour.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I meant by car silly,&quot; Keith grinned at her blunt reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh sorry,&quot; Myra followed, &quot;It&#39;ll take a little longer than an hour to get there. We can hire the horses until at most 6 in the evening.<br />
<br />
&quot;Understood, then let&#39;s go.&quot;<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
That afternoon the two were on riding horses, in the purest natural landscapes there were. The paths they were riding didn&#39;t pass too many of the main roads that were nearby. It was pretty much all forest, with sometimes a small plain meadow they&#39;d walk through. It was about five o&#39;clock when the two decided to go along the actual coast, on the beach.<br />
<br />
Although it had been a bright, warm, sunny day that day, most beach-goers had already left, as in early spring it would still get dark pretty soon. As they arrived on the beach, they saw the sun stand just above the horizon, ready to set. The once so bright would soon start to dusk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keith,&quot; Myra started, &quot;isn&#39;t this amazing to look at?&quot; She pointed towards the multitude of colours caused by the setting sun. Keith saw it too, as he was riding right beside her. He found himself with an idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Myra, let&#39;s race with the horses. We&#39;re having the perfect circumstances, with the sky, the slight breeze, the water of the sea, you name it!&quot;<br />
<br />
His girlfriend, although barely seeing his boyfriend as the sky was getting darker, yet starrier, saw the excitement surge in his body. She felt like it too, let&#39;s hope the horses did as well.<br />
<br />
A light tap with her heel on its side brought Myra&#39;s horse into a calm trot. Reith did just the same, and eventually was trotting alongside her.<br />
<br />
With another small kick, Myra&#39;s horse picked up the pace, and Reith reacted accordingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Reith, I&#39;m going to count to three.&quot; Reith held the reins a little tighter, the horse felt his companion&#39;s attitude change, and started a slow gallop.<br />
<br />
&quot;One...&quot; Myra, shifted her weight on the horse, and altered her position.<br />
<br />
&quot;Two...&quot; Keith realized he was still sitting incorrectly, and recovered.<br />
<br />
&quot;GO!&quot; Myra immediately paced away, leaving Keith flabbergasted, but he too made his horse accelerate.<br />
<br />
&quot;You cheater!&quot; Keith laughed, reacting to how Myra counted, it was the oldest trick in the book, and yet he fell for it. <br />
<br />
Myra looked behind her in glee. What speeds these fascinating animals could reach! She was sent flying! Her boyfriend was enjoying it as well. He was amazed. But also he was catching up.<br />
<br />
Time seemed to stop, it was as if the couple were the only two humans on Earth, enjoying their time together for as long as it could last. Keith was now racing beside her. He short sleeved shirt was fluttering in the wind. Keith looked at his lovely girlfriend, her hair waving behind her.<br />
<br />
__________<br />
<br />
That moment, the shockwaves passed through the Earth.<br />
<br />
__________<br />
<br />
Keith looked back at Myra as he surpassed her, but was caught off-guard by a bright flash in his view. His senses recovered quickly, and he saw moments after how his girlfriend seemed to fall forward off her horse. He turned again only to see how his horse went wild, as it was bucking heavily in its panic. In the process, his horse kicked its front legs into the sky. A sharp pain and cracking feeling in his back made Keith lose his on the reins, and he fell landing painfully on his back.<br />
<br />
Keith expected the impact of his horse falling with him to follow, but it didn&#39;t happen. His field of vision became hazy, and he slipped into unconsciousness.</p>
