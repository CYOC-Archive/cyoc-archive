<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I woke up the next morning but didn’t feel quite ready to get out of bed.  I felt groggy and disoriented.  I <br />
opened my eyes and tried to focus on my surroundings.  For a moment I thought I was in my own room.  The haze <br />
faded away and I recognized that I was still in Karyn’s room.  Just to make sure that I had not been stuck in <br />
a dream, I put my hands on my chest and was relieved when I found I still had my breasts.<br />
<br />
“Yes, they’re still there,” I heard Karyn say.  I sat up in the bed and saw that she was already awake and <br />
appeared to be looking through her own closet.  “I did the same thing with my cock,” she said.<br />
<br />
“What time is it?” I groaned as I rubbed my eyes.<br />
<br />
“About 8,” she answered.  “We’ve got lots to do, so you’d better get yourself up and going.”<br />
<br />
“What are you doing?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Checking,” she said.  “Curious to see if the clothes I still have are the same as before.”<br />
<br />
“Are they?” I asked.<br />
<br />
She closed the closet and said, “They appear to be.”  She frowned a little.  “I’ve gotta say I like going <br />
naked.  Wearing clothes won’t be much fun.”<br />
<br />
“We’ll have to see what it’s like,” I said.  “Maybe people only wear them outdoors in the winter.”<br />
<br />
“What, like they take them off once they’re inside and it’s warm?” she asked.<br />
<br />
“Maybe,” I said.  “We’ll find out then.”<br />
<br />
I got out of bed and we went about the business of getting ready to go to school.  We went downstairs but saw <br />
no sign of Karyn’s sisters.  “Still asleep,” she said.  “That’s nothing new.”  <br />
<br />
She left a quick note for Cady on the counter.  It read, “Remember:  Be Yourself!!”  We left the house quietly <br />
and headed back for my house.  It was slightly chilly for a summer morning, since it was still so early.  This <br />
had the effect of making our nipples hard.  Fortunately it had the same effect on anyone else we saw outside, <br />
so nobody would pay any mind to it.<br />
<br />
We reached my house at about 8:45.  “Uh oh,” I said as we walked to the front door.<br />
<br />
“What’s wrong?” Karyn asked.<br />
<br />
“I don’t have pockets,” I said.  “So I don’t have any keys.”<br />
<br />
“Huh,” said Karyn.  I was about to ring the doorbell but Karyn stopped me.  “Bet you don’t need ‘em,” she <br />
said.  With that she turned the doorknob and it opened.  She flashed a triumphant smile at me and said, “Told <br />
ya.”<br />
<br />
We walked into the house and could hear sounds of activity in the kitchen.  When we entered the kitchen we saw <br />
my sister waiting patiently at the table and my mother preparing some food.  “They’re here!” Leah said.  She <br />
ran over to us and gave both of us a hug, then quickly returned to her seat.<br />
<br />
“Oh, good,” said my mother.  “How are you girls?”  I took a quick glance at her cock and saw that it was at <br />
the size from immediately after the change.  It seemed that theory might be true.<br />
<br />
“Great!” Karyn replied eagerly.  <br />
<br />
A bit surprised by her enthusiasm I said, “Yea, definitely great.”<br />
<br />
“Come on and sit down, have something to eat,” said my mother.  We obliged and had a quick breakfast of eggs <br />
and toast.  After we finished my mother asked, “Are you going to demonstrate your project today?”<br />
<br />
“Um…I don’t know,” I said.  “Maybe.”<br />
<br />
“Remember, don’t be afraid to volunteer,” my mother said.  “Most teachers like that and it could help your <br />
grade.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks for the advice,” Karyn said.  “Joey, you better go get our project before we forget.”<br />
<br />
I ran upstairs to my room and looked for our project.  I found a vial with some kind of liquid in it sitting <br />
on my desk.  It appeared unremarkable.  It was pale blue in color but otherwise looked sterile and harmless.  <br />
To be on the safe side I looked around the rest of my room but found nothing else that could possibly be what <br />
I needed, so I returned downstairs with the vial.<br />
<br />
“Got it,” I said to Karyn.  I saw that it was now about 9:15.  “We’d better get going.”<br />
<br />
“Where are your books?” asked Leah.<br />
<br />
Whoops, I thought.  I knew something was missing.  For the sake of time I made a quick wish to know where they <br />
were.  I acquired the knowledge that they were in my car, which was parked in front of the house.  “In the <br />
car,” I answered.  “Gotta run!” I said before precocious little Leah could ask any more questions.<br />
<br />
Karyn and I left the house and walked to my car.  “That’s great,” she said.  “Where are my books?  And your <br />
car keys?”<br />
<br />
I looked into the car and saw two backpacks in the back seat.  I also spotted what appeared to be a small <br />
purse on the passenger seat.  I looked at the ignition and, sure enough, the keys were inserted into it.  “See <br />
for yourself,” I said.  I walked over to the driver’s door and found it unlocked.  “Wow,” I said.  “How likely <br />
was this in the old world?”<br />
<br />
“Not at all,” said Karyn as she opened the passenger door.  Once we were in the car and buckled in, Karyn <br />
said, “Give me that vial.”  I handed it to her and she put it into the purse.  I looked at her with a raised <br />
eyebrow.  “Look,” she said as she displayed the purse to me.  “There’s nothing else in it except some cash and <br />
cards.  It won’t get hurt.”<br />
<br />
I smiled and said, “Even if it did we could always wish it back.”  I started the car and was about to pull out <br />
on the road.  But then it occurred to me that I had no idea where our school was located.  So that I didn’t <br />
give Karyn an unexpected jolt I said aloud, “I wish that Karyn and I would know the location of and how to get <br />
to Cleopatra University.”<br />
<br />
After we received our knowledge jolt Karyn looked at me and laughed.  “So Centre Hills University is now <br />
Cleopatra University,” she said.  “That’s just funny.”  Centre Hills University was the college we’d attended <br />
for the last several years.<br />
<br />
“Well at least we know how to get there,” I said.<br />
<br />
“Then get going!” she said.</p>
