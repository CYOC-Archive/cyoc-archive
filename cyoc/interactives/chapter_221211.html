<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam stepped up to the trailer that was serving as Zeke&#39;s office, dressed in a pair of work pants and a new tank top that he found in his bedroom. Another gift from Gio. He didn&#39;t know how the wolf got him supplies or when, but it was another thing he owed him. He tried not to think too hard on the wolf, that was dangerous territory before a meeting with his new boss. Even if that boss had caught them in bed together this morning. He was trying not to think about that either.<br />
<br />
A hi-vis vest came flying at him through the air, and he caught it, catching sight of the skunk who tossed it waiting outside Zeke&#39;s office. &quot;Morning. Boss wants a word before we get started.&quot; Though the way Hank was positioned, he was obviously listening to something going on inside the trailer.<br />
<br />
As Sam stepped up he could hear Zeke&#39;s gruff voice almost shouting, and the trailer wasn&#39;t exactly designed to be sound proof. &quot;You&#39;re lucky it&#39;s only a week! I could have your ass out of here for what you did yesterday!&quot; He couldn&#39;t make out the response from whoever was getting yelled at, but something told him it was Gio. The voice ratcheted up another tick in volume. &quot;Hank! Sam! Get your tails in here!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam almost jumped as he hears his name and looked over to Hank curiously. The skunk seemed to understand and tapped his nose. &quot;You&#39;ll get used to it.&quot; Curiously, Sam took a sniff and his brain slowly picked out a few threads that tickled the back of his mind. One he knew instantly was Gio, two more he took a bit more to pin down as Hank and Zeke, and finally one he didn&#39;t recognize with a musky scent. That all mixed with asphalt, morning coffee, his own soap, and numerous other city smells that almost made him sneeze. He got a quick slap on the back from Hank. &quot;Like I said, you&#39;ll get used to it. Quicker if you hadn&#39;t broken the dampener, but now you get to learn stuff the hard way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gee, lucky me.&quot; Sam said as sarcastically as he could manage as he followed Hank inside the trailer, trying not to get bopped in the face by fluffy skunk tail. Gio was inside, looking thoroughly chastised along with a thirty something otter with a stocky dad-bod that didn&#39;t quite seem to fit the sleek swimmer aesthetic Sam would have assumed with otters. As Sam entered Gio looked at him and brightened, almost looking like he hadn&#39;t just been ripped a new one by the boss. Oddly, Sam felt himself grinning as well. A snort from Zeke pulled their attention off each other.<br />
<br />
Zeke crossed his arms on his desk and looked over the four. &quot;Gio, you&#39;re with Tanner for now. Maybe between the two of you one can keep it in their pants long enough to get some actual work done.&quot; The otter, who up till then had looked bored winced.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Fitch?&quot; The otter managed to ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s got a new trainee. I think he&#39;ll do good there. Hank, you&#39;ve also got a new trainee, though I assume I don&#39;t need to introduce you.&quot; Sam shook his head, seeing Hank do the same. &quot;You two get to work, I need to talk to these two.&quot; The dismissal obviously for Gio and Tanner.<br />
<br />
Though as the wolf passed by Sam he paused and whispered. &quot;Meet you at your place during the lunch break?&quot; He didn&#39;t wait for an answer, maybe Sam&#39;s surprised look was enough. That wolf was going to run him ragged, and he kind of liked the idea, he could feel his ears practically quivering atop his head at the idea, and something else stirring as well. He watched Gio until the door closed behind the two. He looked over to his new boss, expecting disapproval, but instead saw a smile from the boar.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, boss. That was.. This morning...&quot; Sam started, thinking of the boar bursting in on him and Gio and literally pulling the wolf off of his cock.<br />
<br />
Instead it was Hank who spoke up, clapping Sam on the shoulder. &quot;It happens. Like I said you&#39;re learning the hard way, and we&#39;re not as prudish as humans. Besides, if you actually manage to tame that wolf? It&#39;s worth it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zeke snorted a short laugh. &quot;I&#39;m mad you&#39;re late. But you went through a lot yesterday, so we&#39;ll just pretend it didn&#39;t happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, boss.&quot; Sam said as he relaxed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I called your old boss. He&#39;s upset to lose you but had nothing but good things to say, so I know you&#39;ll be a good fit in my crew. I&#39;m pairing you up with Hank here, he&#39;ll train you. And keep it tucked away around Gio when on the clock. I don&#39;t care what you boys do in your free time, but not when I&#39;m paying you.&quot; Zeke seemed to take Sam&#39;s eager nodding as agreement to do just that. &quot;If anything, I&#39;m glad you might settle that wolf down a bit. If that monster between your legs doesn&#39;t satisfy him, nothing will.&quot; That made Sam glance away embarrassed as the memory of that morning returned, to a sharp laugh from Zeke which was joined in by Hank, even Sam found himself grinning after a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sam, I look after my boys, and more we gotta look after each other. You&#39;re one of us now, just remember that. Now, get to work you two.&quot; It was simple wording but Sam could read the subtext. He wasn&#39;t human anymore and he better remember it. But hislittle shopping trip yesterday showed him that better than Zeke&#39;s words could. A quick plucking at his vest from Hank had him following the skunk.<br />
<br />
&quot;He likes you.&quot; Hank said once the door was closed. &quot;Well, not likes you likes you, but likes you. He&#39;s usually a little more warry of those who were human before, but you he likes.&quot; Hank babbled a bit as they walked towards where the trucks were parked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not..&quot; Sam started then looked over at Hank. &quot;I&#39;m not really that big, am I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean overall or in the dick department?&quot; Hank said, obviously teasing his new partner. &quot;Yes you are. To both. Even for a horse you&#39;re big, and I&#39;m not even going to pretend to know how Gio fit your monster in him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, just Zeke and Gio..&quot; Sam started but Hank cut him off with a laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are both big guys. Sure, we tend to follow our species a bit, but they&#39;re the biggest guys I know, and you are bigger than both of them. Though not much in Zeke&#39;s case.&quot; Hank snorted. &quot;Not going to say you&#39;re the biggest ever, but I doubt you&#39;ll ever really be looking up at anyone. Maybe a giraffe, but they cheat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So glad my boss and coworkers know what my dick looks like.&quot; Sam muttered, trying not to wilt from embarrassment, which only seemed to amuse Hank more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, you got a lot to learn about being one of us. I&#39;ve seen most of the crew naked, and not just the ones that like guys. We&#39;re an open bunch, usually.&quot; Hank stepped up on to the back of one of the trucks and walked deeper in, to a wall that was covered in electronic equipment, and what looked like the biggest toolbox Sam had ever seen, though each of the drawers had the name of an animal on it. He pulled a tablet off the wall and began to skim through it.<br />
<br />
&quot;How many guys on the crew are gay?&quot; Sam asked, just realizing that he had already met at least a couple. On his old crew there was only him that he knew of, and he kept it quiet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh right, you humans are weird about that.&quot; Hank looked up and grimaced. &quot;Sorry, you&#39;re not.. I didn&#39;t mean..&quot; He sighed. &quot;It&#39;s a lot more common among us, and no one really cares who you pick as your mate. We don&#39;t really label it like that. If you like someone, you like them. If you have a type, well, that&#39;s cool too.&quot; Hank tapped the screen. &quot;While I look for our assignment, why don&#39;t you pick the vial. More common species are towards the bottom, rarer up top. Try to stick mostly to the common ones. We have more of those.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess that makes sense.&quot; Sam murmured as he began to browse the drawers. &quot;Aren&#39;t these all a little generic?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How so?&quot; Sam asked, still scanning the tablet.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, like this one just says dog, no breeds. And horse.&quot; Sam tapped the drawer that his own vial must have come from. &quot;There&#39;s different types.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hank laughed. &quot;I told you, I&#39;m not the science guy. But why I get it, is the capsule does it&#39;s thing, the specifics depend on the DNA you already got in you. So I guess you could have ended up any type of horse, but something in you made..&quot; And Hank just kind of waved at Sam&#39;s body in general. Sam shook his head, not really getting it but went back to browsing the drawers. &quot;Here we go. Apartment 204.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;204? Of fucking course.&quot; Sam muttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Know them?&quot; Hank said, lowering the tablet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Him. Lawrence. Most of the people in this building are blue collar, he&#39;s got some office job at a law firm, thinks it makes him Mr. Special. Pretty much the definition of an ass.&quot; Sam was already narrowing in on a drawer, sliding it open. &quot;That makes the pick easy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s a lawyer?&quot; Hank asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, just some office drone, but he acts like he might as well be. We, well, may have also dated for a hot minute, it didn&#39;t work out.&quot; Sam plucked a capsule out of the drawer and held it out to Hank, who took it and laughed after a glance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me guess, because he&#39;s an ass? You sure?&quot; He asked, wiggling the capsule in his fingers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I&#39;m sure, but, is he going to recognize me?&quot; Sam crossed his arms over his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;ll recognize you, even his memories will be right. No, I don&#39;t know how.&quot; Hank said as he scanned the capsule under the tablet&#39;s camera to log it to this job and then replaced the tablet.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I know, you&#39;re not the science guy.&quot; Sam said, making Hank smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, let&#39;s go grab a crate.&quot;<br />
<br />
-------------------<br />
<br />
Hank knocked on the door as Sam leaned on the crate, trying to not look too excited or too bored. Finally the door swung open and Lawrence stood there dressed as if he were going to work, though he had a headset on, down around his neck. He was average height, and slim, with neatly coiffed blond hair. He was handsome, even Sam had to admit that, even if he did look like he had been eating lemons for breakfast.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning!&quot; Hank said, brightly chipper. &quot;I&#39;m Hank, this is Sam. We&#39;re from Anthro Renovations, Inc., here to do the upgrades on your unit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sam?&quot; Lawrence said, fixing Sam with a look. &quot;You look.. well.&quot; Oh yes, he sounded wonderfully sour. &quot;Come on in, and try to keep it down. My boss is already furious I have to work from home today, I don&#39;t need you making a racket while I&#39;m in a meeting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll be as quite as mice.&quot; Hank said with a smile. &quot;Though we will need you to move at some point when we get to the floor treatments, but we&#39;ll try to put that off as long as we can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever, just get this done.&quot; As Lawrence turned to walk away, Hank stepped into the apartment, followed by Sam pushing the crate. He barely caught Hank pulling the capsule out of his pocket and snapping it behind Lawrence&#39;s back. Lawrence didn&#39;t notice at all, just putting his headset back on and taking a seat at his desk once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who pissed in his cereal?&quot; Hank muttered with a look to Sam, motioning that they might as well start in the bathroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably did it himself.&quot; Sam replied, knowing he sounded exasperated. Lawrence always seemed to have a chip on his shoulder, even while they were dating. &quot;That mouth of his is only good for complaining.&quot; He glanced towards Lawrence, wondering if the capsule was taking effect yet, was he scratching his chest because it itched or because it was changing?<br />
<br />
Hank snorted at Sam&#39;s joke. &quot;C&#39;mon, let&#39;s get to work. Don&#39;t forget, we&#39;re also here to keep an eye on him as he changes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure we want him?&quot; Sam muttered as he opened the crate, already starting to dig things out. He had been paying enough attention yesterday to already have some of it figured out.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. But it&#39;s not our call. Maybe your pick will mellow him out a little.&quot; Hank said, stepping into the still slightly damp shower to get to work.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or he&#39;ll just be a bigger ass.&quot; Sam handed over the drain trap, with a flourish.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile in the living room, Lawrence muttered about his dry cleaner using something on his shirt that was making him itch. The dampeners around the building and in the crate keeping him from noticing the bristly hairs sprouting across his chest.</p>
