<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff... well its mark but he now thinks he is jeff and is the only jeff now. <br />
So Jeff woke up the next morning with a strange sense of unease. The house was eerily quiet. He lay in bed for a moment, staring at the ceiling, trying to shake the nagging feeling that something was wrong.<br />
<br />
“Dad?” he called out, his voice breaking the stillness. No answer, thinking it was odd Dad was gone yesterday, and well he was thinking he must be back now.<br />
<br />
He got up and checked the usual spots—his dad’s bedroom, the kitchen, the living room. Each room was empty. The car was still in the driveway, but his dad’s phone was nowhere to be found. Jeff frowned. His dad hadn’t been home since yesterday morning, and now it was starting to feel serious.<br />
<br />
Jeff sat at the kitchen table, staring at his own phone. He thought about calling the cops again, but the memory of yesterday’s chaos held him back. First, there was the naked intruder incident, followed by the random kid he made by that naked man then fake jeff who ever he really was, but right now Jeff new he is a cute kid somewhere, with him calling the cops about him as well and them taking him away. Jeff didn’t want them to think he was some kind of troublemaker or a person who brings trubal to him self.<br />
<br />
But... what if something really bad had happened to his dad?<br />
<br />
He hesitated for a long moment before deciding. “Okay, I’ll call,” he muttered to himself. “It’s the right thing to do.”<br />
<br />
He picked up his phone and dialed.<br />
<br />
The dispatcher was polite but dismissive. “If your father’s been gone less than 48 hours and he’s an adult, well 16, it’s not considered an emergency, with Mark is a 40 plus man, and jeff is 16 who is old enough to look after him self for a couple of days. and said to Call back tomorrow morning if he still hasn’t returned.”<br />
<br />
Jeff hung up, frustrated. Waiting another day wasn’t an option. He had to do something. His mind wandered back to the Chronivac sitting in his room.<br />
<br />
Jeff stared at the glowing interface of the Chronivac, an idea forming. He knew it was risky—yesterday’s chaos had taught him that much—but he couldn’t help himself. If the cops wouldn’t take him seriously as a teenager, maybe they’d listen or help to someone younger and who is not old enough  to be home alone for days.<br />
<br />
“What’s the worst that could happen?” he muttered as he entered his new parameters: age, 12 years old. He hesitated for a moment before tweaking his appearance further. He remembered being a chubby, awkward kid at that age, and he wasn’t about to go back to that.<br />
<br />
“Let’s see... lean, athletic, longer hair,” he said,(always wonted long hair back then so why not) adjusting the sliders. He also made sure to check the box for &quot;Reality Alteration&quot; to ensure that the world would see him as if he had always been this way. Satisfied, he hit “Apply.”<br />
<br />
The transformation was immediate. Jeff felt his body shrinking, his limbs slimming, and the faint traces of stubble on his face disappearing. His skin smoothed, becoming soft and clear. His hair grew longer, brushing his shoulders, and he noticed his frame now looked lithe and wiry rather than the pudgy figure he remembered from his real childhood.<br />
<br />
Jeff ran to the mirror, staring at the reflection of a boy he barely recognized. “Whoa...” he said, his voice high and light. He touched his face, his chest, his arms, marveling at how different it felt to be so young again, and small from his feet and hands and well his dick and balls as well, and he could also now see all his ribs throw the skin on his chest it was odd with it feeling kind of nice and good.<br />
<br />
For the next hour, Jeff explored his new body, reveling in the strange sensation of being small and carefree. He stretched, jumped, and ran around the house, grinning as he felt his soft, youthful energy. Finally, he snapped back to his plan.<br />
<br />
“Right,” he said to himself. “Time to call the cops.”<br />
<br />
Jeff dialed again, putting on his best impression of a scared, vulnerable kid.<br />
<br />
“Hi... um, I think my dad’s missing,” he said, his voice trembling. “He wasn’t home all day yesterday, and he’s still not back. I’m really scared. I don’t know what to do.”<br />
<br />
The dispatcher’s tone changed immediately. “Okay, sweetheart, just stay calm. We’re sending someone over right now to help you, okay? Stay where you are.”<br />
<br />
Jeff hung up and smiled to himself. “That did it.”<br />
<br />
Within minutes, a police car pulled up outside. Two officers stepped out and knocked on the door. Jeff opened it, giving them his most innocent, wide-eyed expression.<br />
<br />
“Hi,” he said, his voice small and nervous. “Thanks for coming.”<br />
<br />
The officers knelt to his level, their demeanor gentle. “You’re Jeff Hodges, right? Can you tell us what’s going on?”<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded, playing his part perfectly. “My dad didn’t come home yesterday. I thought maybe he went to work or something, but he hasn’t called, and he always calls. I’m scared something happened to him.”<br />
<br />
The officers exchanged a look, clearly taking the situation more seriously now. “Don’t worry, Jeff,” one of them said. “We’re going to help you.”<br />
<br />
As they began asking questions and taking notes, Jeff smiled inwardly. Everything was going exactly as planned.</p>
