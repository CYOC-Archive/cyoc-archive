<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The first person to stir awake on this day, one of the most important days of their lives, was Michael. He had gotten a restful nights sleep, having gone to bed early. He noticed that Chris was holding him tightly around his chest. His grasp was firm, but also so comforting. He also noticed that Chris had, once again, morning wood poking at his butt. Michael ignored this, as he leaned over to check the time on his communication device. <br />
<br />
“It’s only 6” Michael thought to himself, as he settled back into Chris’ grasp.<br />
<br />
Michael had a naughty thought in that moment, as he could hear Chris quietly snore into his ear. He was feeling unusually horny this morning and was eager for his hole to be filled. He knew it was wrong. He knew he shouldn’t allow his logic to get clouded by his horniness. He knew it would cause problems in his marriage to Freddy. However, Michael was angry at his husband for insisting upon leaving the house yesterday and then getting taken by Tom. He was mad that Freddy put himself at risk of being taken from him forever, if they couldn’t get him back and Tom moved him out of town. He was mad at his husband, which clouded his judgement with a range of emotions.<br />
<br />
Not wanting to wake Chris from his slumber, Michael had an idea. He gently held onto Chris’ hairy arm with one hand, as he reached over for a bottle of lube on the nightstand next to him with the other. Michael slowly shimmed his pajama bottoms down, leaning his now naked butt into Chris’ raging hardon. The thing that Michael was craving in that moment was only covered by his bed partner’s own pajama bottoms. This was something that Michael was going to change. <br />
<br />
Gently, Michael could feel Chris’ hot breath on his neck, as he carefully reached behind to grab at Chris’ waist. He carefully tugged at the sides of Chris’ looser fitting bottoms and began to slide them down his waist. Slowly, but surely, Michael managed to get them past his balls and rested them just below Chris’ ass. Settling back into the bed, Michael could feel Chris’ morning wood rubbing up against his butt cheeks. Their bodies were once again touching in the most intimate way possible.<br />
<br />
Chris let out a quiet moan in his sleep, which startled Michael for a moment. After Chris continued snoring, Michael decided to prompt this action further. Pouring some lube onto his hand, Michael lathered his asshole and rested it against Chris’ hard dick. Michael wiggled his ass, forcing Chris’ dick to touch the puckered lips of his hole. Michael longed to have Chris’ meat inside of him again. It took a minute of effort to get it back inside, but after Michael reached over and lined Chris’ dick into position, he could feel it slide inside of him.<br />
<br />
“Oh man” Michael hissed quietly, as Chris’ dick sunk into his asshole. <br />
<br />
Chris loudly moaned in his sleep, as his dick reached in as far as it could. When he was in as far as he could possibly go, his balls rested gently against Michael’s own pair of testicles. Chris&#39; big bush scratched at Michael&#39;s smooth butt cheeks. After Michael had a minute to adjust to the feeling of Chris in his hole, breathing sharply as he did so, Michael decided to spur this on even further. He began to slowly rock himself back and forth. Feeling Chris’ dick go in and out made Michael quietly moan in pleasure. He was lost in the sensations of lust, before he noticed Chris’ arms leave his chest and make their way to his waist.<br />
<br />
Michael became startled, as Chris began to buck himself into him. In short, jagged thrusts, his bed partner began to work himself on his asshole.<br />
<br />
“Oh man” Chris moaned in his sleep. “That feels so good.”<br />
<br />
Michael turned around, startled and wondering if Chris had woken up. He found that Chris still had his eyes closed and seemed to be lost in a sex dream.<br />
<br />
“He must not be aware that he’s doing this” Michael thought to himself, as he felt his body shiver in pleasure over Chris pounding his hole. <br />
<br />
“Mary” Chris moaned to himself. <br />
<br />
“Oh god, that confirms it. He must not realize that he’s fucking me after all. He must be having some sort of sex dream right now.”<br />
<br />
Michael turned and looked at his dick popping up and standing to attention. <br />
<br />
“No matter. I can still get myself off from this.”<br />
<br />
Michael put more lube on his hand to rub his dick sensually. <br />
<br />
“Mary” Chris mumbled in his sleep. “Your ass feel so tight. Almost as good as your pussy.”<br />
<br />
“Not helping” Michael thought to himself, as he began to worry about losing his own erection. <br />
<br />
Soon enough, Chris’ bucking into Michael began to get faster and faster. <br />
<br />
“Mary” Chris moaned. “I’m getting close, baby. I’m going to cum in your ass.”<br />
<br />
“Give it to me” Michael whispered to Chris. “Breed my ass again.”<br />
<br />
Chris continued to pound into Michael’s asshole in his sleep. Before he reached the point of no return, however, his eyes shot wide open and he saw what was going on.<br />
<br />
“Oh shit!” Chris exclaimed, as he pushed himself off of Michael and laid himself on the bed on his back.<br />
<br />
“Chris?” Michael whined, as he rolled himself over to face him. “Why did you stop?”<br />
<br />
“Michael, what was going on just then? Why are our pants down? Why was I fucking you just now?”<br />
<br />
“You did one of your night humps again and I decided to just let you do it with our clothes off.”<br />
<br />
“You really shouldn’t have done that. This is a very bad idea and—“<br />
<br />
Michael ignored him and immediately went to put his mouth on Chris’ pulsing erection.<br />
<br />
“No Michael” Chris weakly protested. “No, oh….”<br />
<br />
Chris moaned loudly, as Michael plopped his head all the way down on his dick.<br />
<br />
“Oh fuck” Chris moaned, as he ignored his professional duties and put his hand on Michael’s head. “I’m so close. Just a few more pumps and you’re going to get a sticky breakfast this morning.”<br />
<br />
Chris put his other hand on Michael&#39;s head and began to jab into him aggressively. Michael began to gag, as tears fell from his eyes. <br />
<br />
“Here it comes!” Chris moaned loudly. “You asked for it!”<br />
<br />
Michael let out another loud gag, as Chris cried out in pleasure. He was filling Michael up with his ample seed. He shot his cum all the way into the back of Michael’s throat. Michael had trouble swallowing it all, so much of it leaked out of his mouth and onto Chris’ dick. Trying to slurp some of it up, Michael swallowed as much as he could, before he moved his head off of Chris’ dick.<br />
<br />
“Man” Chris said, as he panted. “That was amazing.”<br />
<br />
Michael settled onto his side of the bed and wiped the tears and cum off of his face. He settled down and began to pump his meat. Unlike last time, Michael was ready to pleasure himself. <br />
<br />
“Need some help with that?” Chris asked. <br />
<br />
“What did you have in mind?” Michael replied, as he continued to stroke his dick. <br />
<br />
Chris grabbed the bottle of lube and squirted it onto his hand. He moved Michael’s hand away and began to pump it rapidly.<br />
<br />
“Oh my god” Michael moaned, as he squirmed on the bed. “I’m going to cum. Keep doing that.”<br />
<br />
Chris kept pumping Michael’s dick, as he looked into his bed partner’s eyes. <br />
<br />
“Ah! I’m gonna cum! Ah! Fuck!”<br />
<br />
Michael shot a big load onto his face and his shirt, before he shot onto Chris’ hand below him. Panting as he shivered, Michael dribbled out the remainder of his seed onto his pubic area. When he was done, he panted and sought to catch his breath. Chris rubbed Michael’s cum on his pubes, before he shucked off his bottoms and threw his shirt onto the bedroom floor. Sighing, he settled back into the bed. <br />
<br />
“I don’t think that was such a good idea, Michael” Chris said nervously. “I mean, I had a lot of fun just now, but you really shouldn’t have done that. You really shouldn’t have insisted on me cuddling you last night, either.”<br />
<br />
Michael took off his seed stained shirt and bottoms and threw them onto the floor. <br />
<br />
“I mean” he replied “I guess you kind of have a point. I guess I was just mad at Freddy for putting us in this situation and felt a little horny this morning. Maybe I shouldn’t have done this.”<br />
<br />
Chris leaned over and kissed Michael on the cheek. Michael squirmed as he did so.<br />
<br />
“Chris” Michael said, as he looked at him with a neutral expression his face. <br />
<br />
Chris stared at Michael with longing in his eyes. He knew it was wrong to have feelings for his boss’ husband, but he couldn’t help it. He knew Michael was in need of companionship in that moment. With Freddy out of the picture, at least for the time being, Chris felt it was ok to fill in for his friend; even if it wouldn’t last. <br />
<br />
“That kiss” Michael continued. “It reminded me of—“<br />
<br />
“Your dad?” Chris asked.<br />
<br />
Michael nodded, as Chris gave him another kiss on the cheek.<br />
<br />
“Well” he continued. “I’m not your dad. I’m—“<br />
<br />
Chris paused for a moment, unsure of what to say. Michael looked at him with a curious expression on his face.<br />
<br />
“I’m not sure what I am, to be honest with you. I’m not sure what we are, either. You’re—“<br />
<br />
“Michael” he replied. “You can call me Michael.”<br />
<br />
Chris smiled, as he planted another kiss on Michael’s cheek.<br />
<br />
“Finally” he replied with a chuckle. <br />
<br />
“My dad used to kiss me on the cheek. When he wanted to show me he loved me, he would do that. For the longest time, I also used to squirm because it made me uncomfortable.”<br />
<br />
“Was it because of his beard? Like mine?”<br />
<br />
“No. I guess it was partially because I was a teenager and getting affection from your parents was kind of uncool.”<br />
<br />
“I used to get razzed about it when my dad would kiss me, but I honestly didn’t care. I love my dad and his kissing me was a way of him showing he loved me. I’m sure it was the same for your dad, too.”<br />
<br />
Chris gave Michael another kiss on the cheek.<br />
<br />
“Kind of in the way I love you.”<br />
<br />
“But that’s the thing, Chris.”<br />
<br />
Chris eyed Michael nervously. Michael sighed, before he continued. <br />
<br />
“I don’t actually love you. This was better than yesterday, sure, but it’s really just been a mutual masturbation session. We get off on each other, but we don’t really love each other.”<br />
<br />
“Well…”<br />
<br />
Chris paused for a moment, before he went on with his thoughts. <br />
<br />
“Maybe we don’t love each other right now. Maybe we are just doing this because we’re stressed about what we’re dealing with today and needed some release. However, if it came to it, I think I would be able to grow to love you beyond just in a brotherly sense.<br />
<br />
“I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. You’re a great guy, Michael. You’re a loving husband to Freddy, a fantastic father to Evan and a great cook. You’re smart, caring and have the tightest little ass I’ve ever had the privilege to fuck.”<br />
<br />
Chris lightly smacked Michael’s ass from underneath him. This caused Michael to giggle, as he lifted himself up off the bed, before settling back down. <br />
<br />
“Your ass is amazing. Freddy is so lucky to get to fuck this. I’m privileged to be the only other person that’s ever done so. I mean, am I the only other person?”<br />
<br />
Michael nodded his head. <br />
<br />
“Freddy was my first and my only, until you came along.”<br />
<br />
“So I consider myself lucky to be in such an exclusive club. Your hole is VIP and I got to enter the party.”<br />
<br />
Chris kissed Michael on the cheek. <br />
<br />
“But I also know my place. I know that, if we get Freddy back to normal and he wins the mayoral race, then I have to keep our relationship professional from now on. I don’t want to insult you by saying I don’t think I’m going to have too much difficulty.”<br />
<br />
“I’m not offended. My big worry today was this was going to cause a rift with Freddy and that it’d be hard for us to keep things professional between us. It’s good to know we’ll transition back smoothly.”<br />
<br />
“I just hope that I can keep calling you Michael, like we did as kids. I’ve penetrated you twice now, giving my seed in both your ass and mouth. Only Freddy has ever done that before. I think it’s time to drop the title.”<br />
<br />
Michael sighed, before he nodded in agreement.<br />
<br />
“Fine, Chris. I’m ok with that.”<br />
<br />
Chris draped his arm over Michael’s shoulder and pulled him into his chest. <br />
<br />
“My dad used to do this too” Michael commented, as he put a hand on Chris’ hairy chest. <br />
<br />
“Shirtless?” Chris asked, as he felt Michael rub his chest hair. <br />
<br />
“No. He wore a shirt, usually. When I was younger, he would hold me shirtless, but after I turned nine or ten, that all stopped, for the most part.”<br />
<br />
“For the most part?”<br />
<br />
Michael nodded his head. <br />
<br />
“For the most part. There were a few more times over the years where he would still do it shirtless. Those were some of the deepest bonds we ever shared.”<br />
<br />
Michael let out a tear, as Chris played with his hair. <br />
<br />
“I don’t want to come across as rude, but it’s getting kind of late, Michael. We should be getting ready for the shoot today.”<br />
<br />
“Chris?”<br />
<br />
Chris nodded his head. <br />
<br />
“Chris, would you fuck me again? One last time?”<br />
<br />
At Tom’s house, Buddy got up at a relatively early hour of the morning. He couldn’t tell what time it was, seeing as there was no clock in the basement. However, the sun was only just rising outside. Freddy figured it was probably early. Sleeping on the cold floor wasn’t a great way to get a good night’s sleep, but having the blanket underneath him, and his sleeping partner in Lady, helped. <br />
<br />
“Better than last night” Freddy thought to himself, as Buddy yawned and stretched “but I’m still looking forward to sleeping in my own bed again with Michael. I just hope he was ok and that Chris gave him the protection and support he needed.”<br />
<br />
Buddy stood up and took in his surroundings. Since there were no windows, he couldn’t make out more than he did last night. Still, the poop on the floor seemed to be removed. <br />
<br />
“Tom must have cleaned it last night” Freddy thought to himself. “It doesn’t smell as bad in here, either.”<br />
<br />
At that moment, Lady began to yawn and stretch. Buddy looked down at her and she looked up at him. She got up and licked his face. Buddy squirmed for a moment, before he let her continue licking him. Though the scent of her heat waned in the night time, it came back with a vengeance that morning. Buddy took a whiff of her and felt his loins acting up again.<br />
<br />
“Oh god” Freddy thought to himself, as Buddy felt his penis emerge from its furry sheath. <br />
<br />
Lady continued to lick Buddy’s face, egging him on to fuck her again. She felt he had already impregnated her, but she wanted to have a little more fun. Buddy wasn’t certain that this was a good idea. <br />
<br />
“I don’t think it’s a good idea” Chris said to Michael, as he looked at his bed partner’s pleading eyes. “We really should be getting ready to go. I think we’ve had more than enough fun for one day.”<br />
<br />
“But Chris” Michael replied, as he gently placed his hand on his bed partner’s dick “this might be the last time I ever get to feel this thing inside of me.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t think Freddy is going to want to find out that we had sex again while he was away.”<br />
<br />
“I’m sure he’ll understand. Besides, if you let him fuck you, then all the tensions go away.”<br />
<br />
“I’m not sure I’m ready for that or even comfortable doing it with him.”<br />
<br />
“Come on, Chris.”<br />
<br />
Michael did something he never thought he’d do. He leaned into Chris’ face and gave him a kiss on the lips. Chris froze, unsure of what to do. He thought to push him away, but he didn’t do that. Michael continued to kiss, as Chris looked at him nervously. Michael tenderly felt Chris&#39;s beard, which made his dick rise. Chris felt all warm inside from being turned on in that moment. Finally, letting his dick control his brain, Chris kissed him back with equal passion. <br />
<br />
Buddy continued to resist Lady’s advances, but she was becoming persistent. She reached down and began to lick at his exposed red dick. Buddy began to whimper, as he felt his doggy body shudder in delight. His erection ached and he wanted to take care of it. He knew that orgasms wouldn’t change him back. He knew he wouldn’t become his human self again, as long as the ring’s inscription wasn’t read aloud. Sighing, he let Lady get him ready for another fuck.<br />
<br />
Chris’s erection stood to attention, as he made his way on top of Michael. Buddy sniffed at Lady&#39;s vagina, giving it a few gentle licks. Chris placed Michael’s legs on his beefy shoulders, as he smacked his hard dick at his bed partner’s hole. Buddy kept his nose under Lady, as he licked at her enlarged vulva with a greater intensity. Chris, after lubing himself up, aimed his dick into Michael’s hole and plunged into harshly. Buddy stood back, before he leaped onto Lady and stuck his throbbing penis into her waiting vagina. At the same time, in two different houses, the couples made love to each other.<br />
<br />
Chris fucked Michael, while Buddy fucked Lady. Unlike their previous dalliances, this time they felt a connection with each other. In the backs of both Freddy and Michael’s minds, they still longed to be in each other’s arms again. However, as they each felt their orgasms take over, they felt a scary sense of acceptance of what would happen if they were permanently split apart from each other. Michael would come to love Chris as his boyfriend, just as Buddy would come to love Lady as his partner. It wasn’t their preference, but in the heat of passion, they each opened themselves to the possibility of being able to live without the other in their arms. <br />
<br />
All four of them reached orgasm around the exact same time. Chris seeded into Michael, who came on his face and chest. Buddy’s knot tied into Lady, letting out another batch of puppy juice, while Lady shuddered from her own orgasm. When they were spent, they all panted heavily. Chris and Michael chose to remain tied, while Buddy and Lady were forced to. When they were all done, the tops pulled out, as the bottoms cleaned themselves off. <br />
<br />
As this was going on, the mayor resigned himself to starting the day. He got about two hours of sleep that night, as he tossed and turned in his bed. Accepting his lack of shut eye, he got up, got showered, dressed in a spiffy suit and was ready to go by the time his driver was waiting for him outside. After he locked up and left his house, the mayor entered the car. On the drive over to his office, the mayor decided to test if the amnesia spell had worn off.<br />
<br />
“Freddy Benson” the mayor said nonchalantly. <br />
<br />
“What about him, sir?” the driver replied. <br />
<br />
“Remember him?”<br />
<br />
“Of course, I do. He’s running against you on election day, which is a little more than a week from now.”<br />
<br />
“Just thought I’d ask.”<br />
<br />
The mayor settled into enjoying the ride to his office, as he looked at the ring on his finger. <br />
<br />
“I knew it” he thought to himself. “I knew that something must have caused an amnesia on everyone in this town. There was no way that everyone just forgot about my commie rival without some sort of magic being involved. I just hope I’m not getting in over my head with this ring in my possession.”<br />
<br />
As Michael showered to get ready to pick up his son Evan from his mother’s house, Chris went downstairs to make breakfast. He was sticky, covered in cum and sweaty, but he wanted to make sure Michael ate first before he left. He would join them at the set later, as his job was to be stakeout for the mayor and to quickly usher Freddy away if he changed back on set. Walking into the kitchen with his pajamas back on, Chris saw Sofya drinking coffee and looking at her communication device. <br />
<br />
“Morning Sofya” Chris said happily, as he made his way to the cabinet. “I’m going to make some breakfast for Michael. Would you like some?”<br />
<br />
“Sure” Sofya replied, not looking up from her device. <br />
<br />
“Great. I’m making pancakes. Is that alright with you?”<br />
<br />
“Yup. That’s fine.”<br />
<br />
Chris nodded, as he began preparing breakfast. Sofya continued to look at her device, not acknowledging Chris’ attempts at making eye contact with her. Finally, as Chris poured some batter into a pan, he spoke up.<br />
<br />
“You’re awfully quiet this morning.”<br />
<br />
Sofya ignored his comment. <br />
<br />
“Is something wrong?”<br />
<br />
Sofya looked up from her device with a scowl on her face. <br />
<br />
“Couldn’t keep your dick in your pants?” Sofya asked curtly.<br />
<br />
“Uh…How did you know about that?”<br />
<br />
Sofya pointed to her head and let out a groan. <br />
<br />
“I can read your thoughts” she replied. “I can tell what you’re thinking.”<br />
<br />
“Jesus, Sofya. A little privacy would be nice.”<br />
<br />
“Chris, you shouldn’t have done that. If Freddy finds out about this—“<br />
<br />
“Freddy doesn’t have to know.”<br />
<br />
“Chris, you really can’t—“<br />
<br />
“Sofya, please. Just don’t say anything to Freddy.”<br />
<br />
“I won’t have to, though. Michael is going to confess it to him.”<br />
<br />
“What? How? Why?”<br />
<br />
“For me to know and you to find out.”<br />
<br />
“If you read my mind, then you had to remember the time we fucked.”<br />
<br />
Sofya spat out her coffee and looked up at him angrily.<br />
<br />
“I didn’t want to mention it” she said “considering it was a time in my life I regret and wanted to forget. But yes, I did actually remember you and those other boys filling my body up with your cum.”<br />
<br />
“It was kinda hot, actually. You know, even though you’ve grown up and what not, you’re still one of the sexiest women I have ever met.”<br />
<br />
“I’m married, Chris.”<br />
<br />
“I’m not.”<br />
<br />
“That’s nice for you, but I take my vows to my husband seriously. Just because Freddy and Michael don’t with each other, doesn’t mean that I’m going to join the unfaithfulness parade.”<br />
<br />
“Well, if you were single, you know we’d be hooking up.”<br />
<br />
Chris flipped the pancakes over as he spoke. <br />
<br />
“Maybe” Sofya replied “but who knows.”<br />
<br />
“We’ve done it before. I’d do it again. Besides, despite my little thing with Michael, I’m still straight.”<br />
<br />
“You were never fully straight.”<br />
<br />
Chris stared at Sofya with a confused expression on his face. <br />
<br />
“Huh?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“You were never straight.”<br />
<br />
“How do you know this, exactly?”<br />
<br />
“I have the ability to get men to find me attractive, but only if they have the biological inclination to be attracted to women. That’s why I could never get Michael to fall for me, not that I’d want to. Ick, imagine.”<br />
<br />
“Hey! He’s a nice guy and quite good looking, if you ask me.”<br />
<br />
“Good for you, but regardless, he’s fully gay and as a result, my lust spells would never work on him. I can’t make him straight. No one can. Such a thing doesn’t exist.”<br />
<br />
“So you can turn people into animals or get them to do all sorts of other things against their will, but you can’t make a gay guy straight?”<br />
<br />
“No. You can get them to fuck you, but it would technically be rape. They wouldn’t actually want to and they’d resist. It’s not like with you and Michael.”<br />
<br />
“Huh?”<br />
<br />
“Chris, you’re not straight. You’re more bicurious than you allow yourself to admit.”<br />
<br />
“How do you know this?” he asked, as he took the pancakes off the pan and placed them onto a plate. <br />
<br />
“Because all of the guys who fucked me at my house that time were not fully straight. Maybe they considered themselves as such, but any man who was comfortable with the idea of fucking a woman in front of all those other dudes is not totally straight.”<br />
<br />
“Maybe they just wanted to get off with you and didn’t care that other guys were around and watching.”<br />
<br />
Chris poured another batch of pancake batter into the pan.<br />
<br />
“Did you ever think of that?” he asked her.<br />
<br />
“Do you remember that kid Daniel and his friend Duane?” Sofya asked.<br />
<br />
“Of course I do. They were some of my best buds growing up.”<br />
<br />
“Well, if you remember, they left during the orgy, because—“<br />
<br />
“They didn’t want to fuck you in front of a bunch of other dudes.”<br />
<br />
“Right. That’s the point. Anyone who is totally straight would not want to fuck me with other dudes around. The willingness to be so exposed, in a room full of other dudes like that, indicates some subconscious level of bisexuality that those boys wouldn’t want to admit to.”<br />
<br />
“So if I went back to Lenny and Harry and Conrad and asked if they kind of liked dudes, they’d say yes?”<br />
<br />
“Not necessarily. They may not tell you what they were feeling outright, but if you dug into their subconscious, you’d find some repressed attraction to men.”<br />
<br />
“To me?”<br />
<br />
“Not necessarily. Guys have their types. You may not be their type, but some other kid you were going to school with might be.”<br />
<br />
Chris shrugged his shoulders, as Michael walked into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“Morning Sofya” Michael mumbled quietly.<br />
<br />
“Morning” Sofya replied. “How come you never told Chris that Daniel is Evan’s dad?”<br />
<br />
Michael let out a gasp, as Chris turned to look at him with a confused expression on his face. <br />
<br />
“What?” Chris asked. “Michael, is that true?”<br />
<br />
“Oh look” Sofya commented with a giggle. “No more ‘Mr. Scavolini.’” <br />
<br />
Michael growled at her, before he turned his attention to Chris. <br />
<br />
“I just didn’t think to mention it” he replied. <br />
<br />
“How come?” Chris asked.<br />
<br />
“It just didn’t come across my mind at the time. Look, Chris, can we talk about this later? We need to get ready for our mission.”<br />
<br />
“Ah, he’s right” Sofya replied, as she used her magic to calm Chris down. “I shouldn’t have gotten you riled up right before an important mission like this. You two can discuss your keeping secrets from each other later.”<br />
<br />
Chris calmed down, as he looked at Michael, before turning the pancakes over on the pan.<br />
<br />
“I’m not mad at you, man” Chris said, as he walked over to hug Michael. <br />
<br />
“Is this the magic talking?” Michael asked, as he patted Chris on his big, beefy shoulders. <br />
<br />
“No. It’s me. I’m not mad. I’m just—“<br />
<br />
Chris looked at Michael with a sad expression on his face. <br />
<br />
“I’m just sad, that’s all” he confessed. “Sad that you didn’t think you could trust me enough to tell me something like this.”<br />
<br />
“I was going to, Chris” Michael replied defensively. “I’ve just had a lot of other stuff on my mind.”<br />
<br />
“Maybe you can fill him in on the details along with Evan later” Sofya replied. <br />
<br />
“What?” Chris asked. “You haven’t even told your son this yet?”<br />
<br />
“He never asked about it” Michael replied “and I didn’t want to bring it up unless I had to. It’s a sore subject matter and I didn’t want to upset him more than he already is.”<br />
<br />
“Well maybe that might be the source of his anxiety. Did you ever think of that?”<br />
<br />
Chris smelt the pancakes burning, so he interrupted his thoughts to get them off onto the plate. <br />
<br />
“Sorry about that” he apologized. <br />
<br />
Chris got some plates from the cabinet and placed them on the table. He brought over the pancakes and served them out to Michael and Sofya.<br />
<br />
“Thanks Chris” she replied “but where’s the syrup?”<br />
<br />
“Oh” Chris replied, as he slapped his forehead. “Of course.”<br />
<br />
“I’ll get it” Michael volunteered, as he stood up and pulled it from the fridge. <br />
<br />
“Thanks.”<br />
<br />
Michael handed it to Sofya, who slathered it over her pancakes. <br />
<br />
“You should have the talk with him at some point about this, Michael” Chris said, as he began to eat. “It’s better that you tell him, then to leave him in the dark.”<br />
<br />
“When this is all over” Michael replied “I intend to.”<br />
<br />
“He has a point, actually” Sofya said to Chris. “It’s best not to stress Evan out right now. We need calm heads if we’re going to save Freddy.”<br />
<br />
“I just hope you remember to do this” Chris replied to Michael. “If you don’t, then I’m going to ride your ass about it until you do.”<br />
<br />
Michael let out a little giggle. <br />
<br />
“I’m serious” Chris stressed. <br />
<br />
Michael looked at Chris nervously. Sensing the tension, Chris lightened his mood and rubbed Michael’s hair.<br />
<br />
“You shouldn’t be doing that” Sofya commented. “Freddy is not going to be happy about this.”<br />
<br />
“He owes me” Michael replied.<br />
<br />
“For the time I blew him as a dog?”<br />
<br />
&quot;Ew&quot; Chris said. &quot;You seriously did that?&quot;<br />
<br />
“No&quot; Michael said, ignoring Chris&#39; comment &quot;for the times he fucked other dogs as a dog. I’ve been faithful the entire time we’ve been together. It’s about time I get to have some fun at his expense. For all we know, Tom has him doing the same thing with some other dog he has in his house.”<br />
<br />
“How would you figure that?” Chris asked. “Tom has no money, so how would he be able to afford another dog? And wouldn’t we have seen this supposed dog, if such a dog actually existed?”<br />
<br />
Sofya had a bad feeling hit her in that moment. Michael noticed the worrisome expression on her face and commented on it.<br />
<br />
“Something wrong?” he asked. <br />
<br />
“Nothing’s wrong” she lied. <br />
<br />
Michael shrugged his shoulders, as they finished their pancake breakfast. At Tom’s house, Buddy began to paw at the basement door. He wanted to be let out to do his business. He needed to pee after fucking Lady for the third time in 24 hours. He was also hungry, as was she. Finally, after barking and pawing at the door, Tom opened it.<br />
<br />
“Quit your yapping, Buddy!” Tom scolded. <br />
<br />
Buddy ignored him, as he trotted into the kitchen. <br />
<br />
“You too, Lady. I don’t have time to be feeding you and letting you do your business in shifts.”<br />
<br />
Lady trotted up the stairs and made her way to the kitchen. When she arrived, Lady joined Buddy at their respective dog bowls. <br />
<br />
“Dog food for breakfast” Tom said, as he poured out the remainder of the container into their dog bowls. “I didn’t have time to buy you anything else. Once I get paid today, I will run over to the store and make you guys up a proper feast for dinner tonight.”<br />
<br />
Lady eagerly ate the dog food from the bowl, as Buddy stared at it reluctantly. Giving in to his hunger, he slowly ate it up, as Lady devoured her meal. She licked her face, as she waited for her partner to finish. Finally, Buddy cleaned the bowl with his tongue and wiped the dog food remnants off of his face. <br />
<br />
“I’ll never get used to the taste of that” Freddy thought to himself. “Blech.”<br />
<br />
“Come on, guys” Tom said, as he opened the backyard door. “Out you get.”<br />
<br />
Buddy and Lady trotted outside, as they took in the fresh air. Lady’s heat began to emit off into the distance. She would soon attract the attention of other nearby dogs. Doing their business, Buddy and Lady briefly played with each other, before Tom whistled for them to come back inside. Once they were in the kitchen, Tom bent down to look at them.<br />
<br />
“The van is going to be here any minute to pick us up” he said. “I don’t think they’ll let me take the both of you to set, but I can try. Let’s wait outside until they get here.”<br />
<br />
Tom briefly left them to go get their leashes. Buddy had the urge to leave, but Lady kept him by her side. When Tom came back, he attached their leashes to their collars and brought them to the front door to go wait outside for the van.<br />
<br />
When Michael was finished with his meal, he got himself ready to go. <br />
<br />
“Sofya” he called to her. “You’re ready?”<br />
<br />
“I haven’t showered yet” she replied “and I look like a mess.”<br />
<br />
“You can shower when you get back. I just need your help getting my mother on the set. After that, you can come back here and shower before returning.”<br />
<br />
“Fine. Whatever.”<br />
<br />
Michael finished getting ready and made his way out the door to his car with Sofya. At Tom’s house, the black production van came by. A production assistant got out of the car to greet them.<br />
<br />
“You must be Tom” the PA said, as he went to shake Tom’s hand. “We’re looking forward to working with you today. This is going to be fun.”<br />
<br />
“I’m sure it will be” Tom replied, as he shook the PA’s hand. <br />
<br />
“And this dog must be Buddy.”<br />
<br />
The PA scratched Buddy behind the ears, who let out a happy pant. <br />
<br />
“Then who is this other dog?”<br />
<br />
“Oh. That’s my other dog, Lady. She’s in heat, but seems to have calmed down. I was hoping to bring her to set.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know if that’s such a good idea. I’d have to call my boss to see if he’ll give me the ok on that. I mean, it’d be good to have a backup dog in case something goes wrong, but I’d need to get the approval first. Leave her here, while we go to set.”<br />
<br />
“I can’t do that! She can’t be left alone by herself!”<br />
<br />
“Well, Tom, we need to get to set now to check you in. It’s only a few minutes away, so if I can get approval, we can come right back to get her.”<br />
<br />
“I can’t do that!”<br />
<br />
The PA groaned, as he talked to the van driver. When he was done, he went up to Tom.<br />
<br />
“Tell you what” he said. “Let me take your dog Buddy to set so he’s there and then I’ll talk to my boss. If he gives the ok to bring the other dog to set, then we’ll come back to get her with you. We really just need Buddy right now. We don’t need you right away.”<br />
<br />
“Ok” Tom replied reluctantly. “Just make sure nobody steals my dog.”<br />
<br />
“Of course! He’s the big star of our commercial today!”<br />
<br />
The PA patted Buddy, before he took him by the leash and into the van. <br />
<br />
“He’s a valuable commodity now” the PA continued. “We don’t want to lose him. We’re keeping a close eye on him.”<br />
<br />
“Valuable commodity” Tom murmured to himself. “That’s the best news I’ve heard in years.”<br />
<br />
“Oh great” Freddy thought to himself, as he hopped up into the van. “Getting away from Tom is going to become that much tougher now.”<br />
<br />
The PA closed the van door, as he called out to Tom.<br />
<br />
“Stay out here with your other dog and keep your communication device on. We’ll call you with a decision one way or the other.”<br />
<br />
“Ok” Tom mumbled in reply, as the van drove to the set of the commercial. <br />
<br />
The drive to his mother’s house was quiet for Michael. Sofya didn’t talk to him, as she spent the entire time on her communication device. When they got to the house, Michael got out of the car. <br />
<br />
“Are you coming?” Michael asked Sofya.<br />
<br />
“Of course not” she hissed in reply. “I look like a mess.”<br />
<br />
“People are going to see you on the set. What’s the big deal?”<br />
<br />
“A minimum number of people will see me like this. Only enough so that I can get your mother in without issue. After that, I’m going back to the house to go shower and freshen up.”<br />
<br />
Michael shrugged his shoulders, as he walked up the porch to knock on the front door. <br />
<br />
“We’re ready dad!” Evan could be heard yelling from the other side of the door.<br />
<br />
Evan opened the door, with his grandmother by his side. <br />
<br />
“This is wonderful” Michael’s mother said, as she stepped out of the house with Evan. “My grandson is going to star in a commercial. This is so exciting. I can’t wait to be on the set. I’m sure Freddy is thrilled for him as well.”<br />
<br />
“She remembers him now” Michael thought to himself, as his mother locked up the front door of her house. “That means the amnesia spell Sofya cast has worn off.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, about that” Evan said. “I was trying to get grandma to remember Freddy last night and she kept forgetting who he was. It was so weird. It&#39;s almost like she has Alzheimers or something.”<br />
<br />
“I honestly don’t remember doing that” she replied, as they walked to Michael’s car. <br />
<br />
“You did, mom” Michael replied, as he let them in the back of his car. <br />
<br />
“If you say so” she replied. <br />
<br />
When she got in the car, Michael’s mother noticed Sofya sitting in the passenger seat, looking at her communication device.<br />
<br />
“Oh, who are you?”<br />
<br />
Sofya turned to look at Michael’s mother and Evan settling into the back seat. <br />
<br />
“Sofya” she replied coldly. “I’m a friend of Freddy’s.”<br />
<br />
“Oh ok” Michael’s mother replied. <br />
<br />
“You seem kind of mean” Evan commented, as Michael got into the car. <br />
<br />
“Well” Sofya replied “you’re father isn’t—“<br />
<br />
“Enough!” Michael snapped, as he got in the car and started it.<br />
<br />
Michael pulled the vehicle into reverse and then drove them onto the street. <br />
<br />
“Where is Freddy today?” Michael’s mother asked, as her son began driving to set. “The news this morning reported that he just went missing.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know” Michael replied nervously. “I’m sure he’ll show up soon.”<br />
<br />
At the mayor’s office, the advisors sat around waiting for their boss to show up. They couldn’t remember anything that happened the day before. It was as if they all had a collective amnesia about it. They briefly discussed it amongst each other, before the mayor bolted into the room.<br />
<br />
“There you collective gaggle of brain dead morons are!!!!!” the mayor yelled, as he plopped himself in his desk chair. “We have work to do today!!!!!!”<br />
<br />
“Sir” an advisor replied “we were going over some tax documents. When did we give approval for a commercial shoot to film in the dog park today?”<br />
<br />
“Yesterday! When you idiots seemed to be suffering an acute case of amnesia! You wanted to remove me from my job for insanity, but meanwhile, you’re the ones who are in need of institutionalizing!!!!!!”<br />
<br />
“Sir.”<br />
<br />
“None of you idiots remembered that Freddy Benson was my political rival yesterday!!!!! You thought I was crazy to even suggest that I had a rival!!!!!!”<br />
<br />
“I don’t remember us doing that, sir” Marley replied. <br />
<br />
“Sure you did!!!! Watch this!!!!!!!”<br />
<br />
The mayor projected a video onto the dented wall from his communication device. It played him confronting Marley yesterday about Freddy Benson.<br />
<br />
“Freddy Benson!” the mayor scowled in the clip.<br />
<br />
“Who is that, sir?” Marley asked in the clip.<br />
<br />
Marley felt himself blush, as he watched the clip projecting onto the wall.<br />
<br />
“My political rival! The one I’ve been running against for the past nine months!”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know what you’re talking about, sir. You have no political rival.”<br />
<br />
“I’m warning you, Marley! I’m recording this for posterity, in case you decide to snap out of whatever amnesia you and the other boneheaded advisors of mine are in today! You’re going to look awfully stupid when I play this back to you!”<br />
<br />
The advisors nervously giggled, as Marley felt humiliated in that moment. <br />
<br />
“I think you might be sleep deprived, sir. Perhaps you might want to get some rest.”<br />
<br />
“I think we’ve seen enough!” the mayor snapped, as he shut off the clip. <br />
<br />
Giving a mischievous look to his advisors, he let out a chuckle. <br />
<br />
“This is your last chance to redeem yourselves, gentleman. If you don’t assist me in widening the gap between myself and Freddy Benson on election day, then you are all fired. I’m cleaning house and starting fresh with a new staff.”<br />
<br />
The advisors gulped nervously. <br />
<br />
“I have a plan for dealing with that commie pinko that’s sure to destroy him. That’s why I approved that dog food commercial yesterday, when none of you could remember anything.”<br />
<br />
“What’s the plan, sir?” his advisor Dennis asked. <br />
<br />
“We’re going to be taking a little field trip today to the set. I’d like to make my presence known to the production crew, whose jobs I made possible. I also want to see the big star, Buddy the dog. Or should I say, Freddy Benson playing the role of Buddy the dog.”<br />
<br />
The advisors quietly stared at the mayor, thinking he had lost his mind. The mayor played with the ring that glowed on his finger. <br />
<br />
“While we’re there” the mayor continued “I’m going to read the inscription on the back of this ring. As it successfully changed Freddy into a dog, I have a feeling it will also change him back into a human at its utterance. If Freddy changes back on the set, then everyone will see him as naked as the day he was born.<br />
<br />
“He&#39;ll be in his birthday suit in public. Pictures will be taken, for sure. He’ll be permanently humiliated when they come out. His campaign will self destruct. He can no longer deny the authenticity of the photos from April and he’ll be finished forever. He’ll never be able to show his sorry face in this town ever again.”<br />
<br />
The mayor let out a loud and mischievous laugh, as his advisors swallowed nervously. They worried for their boss’ sanity, but little did they know, his sanity was clearer than theirs at that very moment. <br />
<br />
On the set of the commercial…..</p>
