<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Game End?” Harry said, shocked,<br />
“Like the game is over?” Milo asked,<br />
“I-I think so…” Isabella replied.<br />
Everyone sat in silence, unsure of what to say in response. All that… over in just a moment.<br />
“I guess congratulations, Izzy,” Judy said awkwardly,<br />
“Oh right yeah!” Milo jumped in, “congrats,”<br />
“Of course baby,” Harry, “if anyone should win it should be you,”<br />
“Especially having to be a blueberry for two whole rounds,” Judy added,<br />
“It wasn’t all bad,” Isabella chuckled, “pretty comfortable actually,” she chuckled.<br />
<br />
“So you won,” Milo started, “what did you win? Is there some kind of prize?”<br />
“Do we go back to normal?” Judy asked,<br />
“Good question babe,” Milo said to Judy,<br />
“I’ll see,” Isabella said. She looked back at her card and read it out, <br />
“Your Game is Over, has it been Fun? <br />
Fun times were Shared, but now it is Done. <br />
Returned to Normal, before it begun.<br />
But for you, the winner. a wish is Won.”<br />
“S-so you get a wish?” Harry asked,<br />
“I think so,” Isabella stated, “the winner gets a wish, but we all return to normal…”<br />
“Only once you’ve made the wish,” Judy clarified,<br />
“Right…” Isabella said, “so what do I wish for?”<br />
“You can wish for anything,” Milo said, “go crazy,” he suggested, smirking,<br />
“What do you mean?” Isabella asked,<br />
“I mean you have a literal wish. You can wish for anything. We’re probably gonna play again, right?” He asked,<br />
“I mean…” Harry started, looking into his best friends eyes, then back at Isabella, “I would…”<br />
“I think I would as well…” Judy said, “I didn’t enjoy the losing control part… but it wasn’t the worst. Plus the breast implants are pretty great,” she said, grabbing at them,<br />
“I second that,” Milo said, giggling with his girlfriend.<br />
<br />
“So once I make my wish, all our changes go away…” she said, “but if we’re playing again, then why don’t we just use the wish for something fun,”<br />
“Are we playing again tonight?” Milo asked, “because I had… other plans,”<br />
“I don’t know about tonight,” Harry said, “but what about next week?” He suggested,<br />
“Next week sounds good,” Judy replied,<br />
“I think next week is pretty good,” Isabella said, “so whatever I wish has to last us until next week? Any ideas?” Isabella asked,<br />
“I’ve already got one,” Milo said,<br />
“I think I know what I want…” Judy said, “but it’s not for me,” she clarified,<br />
“Oh,” Milo replied with his eyebrow up,<br />
“Me too, actually,” Harry said,<br />
“So what about we all… write on some paper how we want our partner to change, and then we fix ourselves next week with whoever gets the wish?”<br />
“Perfect,” Judy said,<br />
“You sure about this baby?” Harry asked,<br />
“Absolutely,” she replied, “I don’t care what or how you change me. I want you to get the most out of this wish, so you can enjoy whatever your heart… or dick wants,” she giggles, “just don’t make me a blueberry for a week please,” she added, leaning over and kissing him.<br />
“I’ll get some paper!” Milo said excitedly, jumping up to get some paper from another room. He disappears behind the wall,<br />
“I’ll go with him, we’ll discuss it in the other room,” Judy says, getting up slower and leaving.<br />
<br />
“You sure you want to do this?”<br />
“Completely baby,” Isabella replied,<br />
“Because I’m gonna change you—”<br />
“Really baby,” Isabella assured him, “you can change me as much as you want. Give me big boobs, give me four eyes, give me absolutely anything you want. I’m not going to take any offense, my body is yours until next week…” she finished. She looked him longingly in the eyes, “and don’t think I’m not changing anything about you,” she giggled,<br />
“Oh is that so…” Harry replied, “well maybe I’ll have to go a little further than I expected to,”<br />
“Just as long as I can walk,” she said. The two smiled at each other, they really were perfect for one another, and they loved it.<br />
<br />
“Alright, we’re both done,” Judy said, walking back out, “here’s a pen, give us a shout when you’re both ready and we’ll be right out,”<br />
“Thanks,” Isabella said, taking the pieces of paper and pens, handing one of each to Harry. Judy walked back behind the wall,<br />
“Make sure to be descriptive, I’m not gonna read these beforehand,” she clarified,<br />
“Of course!” Harry said, chuckling.<br />
<br />
The two went to opposite sides of the room. Surprisingly, Isabella was writing for longer than Harry, and it was a very obvious fact that Isabella writes faster than him.<br />
“Ready!” Isabella yelled, turning her paper over and placing it in the bowl she’d found on the side.<br />
Judy and Milo walked back into the room, both looking a little hot and bothered. Harry and Isabella immediately knew what had happened in their time apart, but they didn’t judge.<br />
They each placed their papers in the bowl, turning them upside down,<br />
“Are we all sure we’re happy with what we wrote,” Isabella asked,<br />
“Very sure,” Milo said,<br />
“Same for me,” Judy replied,<br />
“Yeah, I’m pretty sure,”<br />
“So am I…”<br />
“Wow,” Judy said to herself, “one whole week changed…”<br />
“It’s gonna be a little crazy, especially since I don’t know what I’m gonna look like,” Harry said in a joking way, but he was clearly pretty nervous.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
“Ready!” Isabella said to herself, she took a deep breath, “For my Final Wish, I wish that each note written by each player applies to their partner, lasting until we next play this game… and that we can play this game next week… and that each of these changes happen in order,” she finished.<br />
<br />
The group looked at each other as they each began to feel their changes disappear,<br />
“Oh right,” Judy said, feeling her implants slowly deflate beneath her skin,<br />
“And my dick…” Milo said,<br />
“Same here…” Harry added. Judy was returned completely to normal, her regular clothes returning as well. Isabella’s pudgy face reduced back to normal, making her back to how she was. Milo was back to normal. And as Harry’s abs faded back into his body, he was back to normal. The group looked around at the faces they were used to,<br />
“Back to normal,” Milo said,<br />
“Kinda nice…” Harry added, the two chuckled, aware of what was about to take place.<br />
<br />
Milo was the first to start changing. The group was all standing up, so they watched as suddenly Milo’s arms began to bulge. His veins getting slightly thicker as his biceps started to grow much thicker. His shirt started to tear by how quickly his arms were growing. His chest started expanding and his shoulders broadened to huge levels. His shirt practically burst open, revealing his glistening (and shaven) torso. The group watched as his muscles continued to grow, his abs becoming rock solid but so smooth. His legs thickening… but something else happening to them as well,<br />
“W-wha…” he let out as he felt himself reducing in height, “babe was this on purpose,”<br />
“I never said it because you were taller, but I really like when guys are shorter than me,” Judy explained. His shrinking stopped at the height of her chest, just a foot or so.<br />
Finally, with his clothes looking a lot looser, he felt something else changing, particularly in his underwear. The group watched as his manhood began to shift and grow, getting longer and longer, heavier and heavier before actually breaking through his underwear. It fell down, dangling completely flaccid between his legs. Even flaccid, his veins looked to be throbbing,<br />
“I probably should’ve wished our clothes grew with us,” Isabella chuckled,<br />
“It’s more fun this way,” Judy said, “watch this!” She said, getting everyones attention. She snapped her finger. Almost immediately Milo’s cock began to harden. In just a few moments he went from flaccid to completely hard, everyone was speechless. His cock had to be at least a foot in length,<br />
“B-babe…” Milo said,<br />
“Don’t worry about it, I got it covered,” she said, breathing heavily as she felt something inside her changing, “I-I said if you didn’t change it, I can… accommodate that thing…” she said. She bit her lip, her hand twitching towards her crotch. But she held back. She let out a sigh, “sorry,” she chuckled,<br />
“Feel free girl,” Isabella said, “you wanna have fun, do it!” The two smiled at each other. They didn’t know each other too well before the night had begun, but they really connected after this game.<br />
Judy snapped her fingers again, Milo’s cock started to slowly soften. Much slower than when it became erect.<br />
<br />
“Oh now it’s actually me!” Judy said, feeling something changing,<br />
“I hope you like what I chose,” Milo said, smirking.<br />
Judy first noticed her nipples suddenly becoming hard, a little harder than was used to. In fact, they were a lot harder than she was used to. Even behind her bra they were poking right through her top,<br />
“Wow… kinda pinchy,” she commented. Then followed was from a little below. Not so much her pussy but her asshole gained a new level of sensitivity. Nothing too crazy, but much more than she was used to, “whoooah…” she said awkwardly.<br />
Following this, she started to feel a new sensitivity on her lips as they started to get thicker. They grew more and more, growing beyond normal looking to injections. They looked like small pillows on her mouth, and like Isabella before, they naturally formed an O shape, yet stayed closed due to their size.<br />
Next, her hips grew wider, her ass started growing fatter, and her thighs grew thicker, and her natural thigh gap remained. By the time her change was over, her butt stuck out like a shelf. She placed her hands on it, feeling it’s increased sensitivity as well as it seemed like it wasn’t just fat…<br />
“Are these…”<br />
“Implants,” Milo winked.<br />
Suddenly her waist shrank inwards unnaturally, looking incredibly sexy to Milo but a little odd to everyone else. Luckily her body didn’t feel uncomfortable, in fact it felt a little stronger. She gained a fair amount of muscle mass, not too obviously, but clearly enough to support her new assets. But beyond this change, she noticed an increase in his upper muscle strength, almost in preparation for…<br />
Her chest started growing, tearing his bra straight open, her top tearing down the middle as well. Everyone watched as her growing breasts grew from D’s to E’s and beyond, finishing at just slightly smaller than the size of her head. They were larger than before. She placed her hands gently on them, assuming they’d have increased sensitivity. They were once again implants,<br />
“You like the implants then, huh?” She flirted with Milo,<br />
“They definitely grew on me,” Milo chuckled,<br />
“Nice…” Judy joked. She stepped towards Milo, leaning down to him, “well I love them… maybe once this whole thing is over I get some real ones?”<br />
“Sounds perfect to me babe,” Milo said back, he stepped on his tip-toes and started kissing her on the lips. She moaned as she kissed him back. The two made out for a few moments before Milo remembered what room he was in and that his best friend was there. He stepped back quickly and apologised.<br />
<br />
“No problem man,” Harry said, “I think mine is beginning now!”<br />
“Keep in mind baby,” Isabella started, “you know I quite like the idea of experimenting, and I know this’ll turn me on,”<br />
“Should I be nervous?” He asked,<br />
“Not unless you don’t like it, then I’ll make sure to fix it,”<br />
“Whatever it is baby, I’ll love it,” he said.<br />
He stepped back and felt as his body changed. Like before, his muscles started to grow. Not so much like Milo’s, more well-built than body-builder levels of muscles, but still good. Once that was over, he felt a change on his face. He couldn’t see himself, so he faced Milo,<br />
“Oh my god dude,” Milo said, eyes wide, “you look like… like…”<br />
“A girl…” Judy said,<br />
“W-what!?” Harry said, quickly rushing to the nearest mirror, “oh wow… I look like my cousin a little,”<br />
“That wasn’t on purpose, I swear,” she said. He felt his butt starting to grow, his hips widened just a little. His legs also added a little extra padding. He walked back to the table, feeling it odd with his new body shape. In just a few moments he started to grow two breasts. They weren’t huge by any means, something around a C cup, but enough to poke through his shirt. Without thinking he lifted it up to see his breasts. He cupped them, feeling them in his hands as suddenly his nipples hardened and expanded.<br />
For his final change, he felt something below his cock. It was an odd feeling, something unfamiliar… his balls disappeared as a pussy started to form,<br />
“Holy shit!” He yelled out, rushing hand down, feeling it as it formed. The sensitivity was so odd and different, he didn’t know what to think. When it was finished, he looked pulled his pants and underwear down, “baby, I can’t pretend this isn’t super weird,”<br />
“I know you probably hate it!” She said, “b-but there was another change I made just to make up for it if you really—”<br />
“Baby!” He said, grabbing her by her arms, “I don’t hate it! It’s cool… it’s sexy. It’s totally weird but I get it!”<br />
“R-really?” She replied,<br />
“Absolutely, it’s kinda hot having tits… and I’m interested in what it’s like having a vagina,”<br />
“W-well then…”<br />
“What was the other change?”<br />
“I just thought that if you hated this, you’d be able to change your dick however you liked it,”<br />
“REALLY!?” He replied, shocked but amazed. He looked down and willed his cock to grow longer, and it did! It started getting harder just from how turned on he was, but then he turned his head to look at Milo’s.<br />
“Don’t even think about being bigger than I am,” Milo said,<br />
“Judy?” Harry asked. Without even asking, she snapped her fingers. Milo’s cock became hard once again, pointing straight out.<br />
Harry willed his own cock to be hard, and began extending it longer than Milo’s,<br />
“Asshole,” Milo said, unable to hide his smirk,<br />
“You’ll just never beat me,” Harry said. He willed his cock shorter, keeping it longer than usual but not too much. He was totally nude at this point, just like everyone but Isabella.<br />
<br />
“Guess it’s me now…” Isabella said, feeling that same feeling everyone felt. Harry was about to say something, but she looked at him and nodded, “its alright, whatever you did,”<br />
She looked down, feeling something about her changing. She tried to figure out if it was her belly, her legs, her breasts, her butt, her arms… anything. But she couldn’t figure it out.<br />
Instead, she was right. It was all of those. She noticed as her belly started pushing against the fabric of her top. Her thighs started pushing against her leggings and her butt doing the same. Even her arms started started pressing against the fabric of her top.<br />
Her body continued to grow, and as it did, her clothes started to tear. First it was her pants, tearing at the calves, then at the thighs, then right down the crack of her butt. Her underwear inevitably tore right off, however she wasn’t exposed as her belly had grown so large it now stuck out in front of her pussy, blocking it completely. Her arms were like water-balloons, and face was already twice as large. Her whole body had grown more than double it’s size. Her breasts had grown, not in cup size but just in fat. Then it stopped.<br />
Her final change came and it was her breasts starting to grow. From small sacks of flabby fat to bigger and bigger, rounder and rounder tits that sat perfectly on her belly. They were the size of watermelons, but compared to the size of the rest of her, it didn’t look so dramatic.<br />
“Holy shit,” Judy said before anyone else could even muster a thought,<br />
“I knew you’d do this,” Isabella said,<br />
“You did?” Harry replied,<br />
“Yeah,” she said, <br />
“So did I, actually,” Milo commented,<br />
“Seriously…” Harry said, feeling embarrassed,<br />
“Baby,” Isabella said, “don’t feel awkward, I gave you a vagina,” she giggled.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
“Well I guess that’s the end of the game,” Milo said,<br />
“That felt so quick…” Harry said,<br />
“No it did not,” both Isabella and Judy said at the time time, they both chuckled at each other as they did.<br />
Milo took the cards and made his way to his room, “gonna put this in the safe,”<br />
“Good idea,” Judy said, still giggling,<br />
“Make sure to check on it at least once a day,” Harry called out as Milo disappeared behind the wall again,<br />
“I will,” Milo said. Judy looked at Harry,<br />
“He won’t… I’ll make sure to check,” she said.<br />
“Most annoying part is the clothes…” Isabella said, wobbling over to the couch and sitting herself down with a thud, “oops… I don’t know how I’m gonna get back up,” she giggled,<br />
“Milo’s now a pretty strong hunky guy, he’ll help you up,”<br />
They all laughed. <br />
<br />
Milo returned and they sat and chatted for a few hours. About the game, about life, about how it was going to be over the next week. How was it going to impact their lives,<br />
“I’m definitely gonna need a week off work, you think?” Isabella said,<br />
“No question. I don’t think I can go into work like this,”<br />
“I could probably go in,” Judy said, “tell them I had a little work done,” she flicked her hair dramatically. Everyone laughed,<br />
“I’m not sure if they’ll take well to me either,” Milo said, “guy comes in jacked out of his mind, shorter and with a foot long dick… probably not gonna like that,” he said, everyone chuckled.<br />
“So a week off for everyone. Sounds pretty great to me,” Harry said,<br />
“Anyone want anymore drinks?” Judy asked,<br />
“No actually…” Isabella started, “I think we should probably go,”<br />
“Yeah, sadly she’s right,” Harry said, “did you text Betty?”<br />
“No texted John, like you asked?”<br />
“Oh right, sorry,” Harry said,<br />
“Betty and John?” Milo asked, “what about?”<br />
“Taking us home. We live on the other side of town, and we can’t exactly take the bus like this,” Harry joked,<br />
“Plus I’m pretty naked,” Isabella added, “so even if we hid it, we’d still be pretty much breaking a law,”<br />
“Good point actually,” Judy said, standing up, “no offense to your… size,” she started, “but we have a table-cloth that should work if you wanna just drape that over yourself,”<br />
“That would probably be the best idea,” Isabella chuckled, “Milo, could you please help me up,” she asked, reaching arms out,<br />
“Of course,” he said. He stepped back, grabbing her arms and pulling as hard as he could. To his surprise, it was pretty easy. She was still very heavy, but these arms made so much easier!<br />
She waddled over to Isabella, who was on her knees looking for a tablecloth from in a small closet in their hallway.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
“What a weird night,” Milo said, sitting back,<br />
“Man, don’t even get me started!” Harry said, “I mean look at me, I’ve got tits!” He said, pointing at them,<br />
“And a pussy, don’t forget,” Milo said, looking down, “I mean I should find you hot, but I don’t really…”<br />
“Is it the dick?”<br />
“I think it’s the dick,” Milo agreed. The two chuckled,<br />
“I don’t think we’ve had just a moment to relax like this in ages. You and me. Ever since college… it’s us and whoever we’re dating,”<br />
“Dude, I totally get that,” Milo said, “but you know what, this is different,” he said, sitting up, “because I don’t think I’ve really felt so confortable with a girlfriend like Judy,”<br />
“Me neither!” Harry said, also sitting up, “it’s like… she’s totally supportive of me, even though I’m a fucking weirdo,”<br />
“Which is true,” Milo teased, “but seriously, it’s the exact same here. Judy’s smart, I’m pretty dumb! But we just fit together perfectly,”<br />
“Exactly the same for me,” Harry said.<br />
The two sat in silence, enjoying the comfort. The sound of their girlfriends talking behind them being a perfect sound. No arguing like times before, no shouting nor screaming. Just a peaceful, bliss of comfort in a space.<br />
<br />
“I miss hanging out with you, man,” Harry said,<br />
“You too, dude,” Milo said, “and I mean that,”<br />
“Me too,” they looked in each others eyes. A love. A respect. A comfort between one-another. They were the best of friends; nothing more, nothing less.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
“Baby?” Isabella called from behind,<br />
“Yeah baby?” Harry replied,<br />
“What do you think of my dress?” She asked. Harry leaned around and looked at her. The tablecloth reaching just below her knees, being held together by about four clothes-pins. It showed off pretty much every curve of her massive body. It wasn’t the body of his girlfriend, and he was happy about that. It was a body he lusted for, but didn’t love. And he enjoyed the fact that she was happy to live with it for the next week. Just for him!<br />
“Looks great,” Harry replied, smirking. He turned to Milo, “it was good seeing you man, catch you next weekend,” he smiled,<br />
“Of course, dude,” Milo replied, “see you then.” The two fist-bumped as Harry stood up and approached Isabella and Judy. He was now dressed again, his shirt not hiding much of his breasts but enough to not be too noticeable.<br />
“I think John and Betty are outside,” Isabella said,<br />
“Okay, we’ll go down in a moment,” Harry said. He turned to Judy, “really good to see you again… and no offense to you, the implants would suit you,” he smiled. Judy smirked, she pulled his head down to whisper in his ear,<br />
“Did Milo ask you to say that?”<br />
“Yep,” he whispered back. The two giggled. Harry gave Judy a big hug, trying his best to avoid her expanded body,<br />
“Oh get over it!” She said, knowing what he was trying to do. She pulled him in tighter and gave him a real bear hug, “you’re half a girl now!” She joked,<br />
“Only until…” he paused, looked at her with a smirk on his face, “yeah… I’m half a girl now,” he admitted.<br />
<br />
Everyone waved at Isabella and Harry made their way down the stairs and to the front of the apartment building.<br />
“That was a shockingly great night,” Judy said, “and I hated half of it,” she laughed,<br />
“Me too. I’m so glad you and Isabella are friends,” Milo said, closing the door behind him,<br />
“Me too…” Judy said. She looked him in the eyes. She sighed, “I know you can’t think of anything else, because I can’t think of anything else,” she stated, “get in that bedroom you big hunky boy!” She said, slapping his ass. His eyes went wide,<br />
“Yes sir!” He shouted, saluting before running to the bedroom. His massive swinging cock between his legs. Judy chuckled,<br />
“Stop!” She yelled. He stopped where he stood, “turn around,” she commanded. He turned, facing her with a big grin on his face. She looked him dead in the eyes, hesitating for effect before snapping her fingers. His cock suddenly became erect, as hard as could be, “Now in that bedroom!” She commanded. He ran off into the bedroom.<br />
<br />
She smiled. Even if he was too cool for her, he was totally a loser inside.<br />
She locked the front door and made her way into the bedroom…<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
“Hey,” Harry started, looking at John in the drivers seat. He was on his own, which was odd. He’d usually go everywhere with Betty, “where’s Betty?”<br />
“Oh… she dumped me like a month ago,” he said very melodramatically,<br />
“Oh shit, really?” Harry replied, shocked, “what happened?” He asked, then remembered he had a much more important task, “actually, tell me a little later,”<br />
“Uhm… okay,” John said, clearly ready to just say everything,<br />
“I need you to keep pretty quiet about this,” Harry started, “I’m bringing Izzy with me,”<br />
“You two are still together?” John asked,<br />
“Y-yeah… why would we not be?” He asked, puzzled, “STOP! NO! Sorry…” he blurted out, “I need you to just not freak out when Izzy comes,”<br />
“Why?” He asked,<br />
“Sh-she’s…” he was starting to wonder why he asked John, besides his fairly large car. He forgot that John is a total asshole, it was Betty who was the nice one, “it’s some hereditary thing. Causes… extreme weight gain at a certain age. She won’t wanna talk about it at all, so just… don’t ask,”<br />
“Weight gain?” He asked, “that’s pretty gross,” John said. Harry had to turn away to roll his eyes,<br />
“Just don’t say anything, okay?” He said. He stepped away quickly to avoid talking to John any longer.<br />
<br />
“Baby,” Harry started, “I totally forgot how much of an asshole John is,”<br />
“I told you this last time,” Isabella said, “I think Betty’s really great, but the weird comments from John made me really uncomfortable. At least Betty’s there to tell him to shut up,” she said, “…right?”<br />
“Uhm… they broke up apparently,”<br />
“You’re kidding me,”<br />
“Nope,” Harry said, “so just do me a favour. I said you’re going through some kind of hereditary weight gain thing, you don’t wanna talk about. Just don’t mention it,”<br />
“Alright,” Isabella said, “but I’m still pretty annoyed it’s just John,”<br />
“We will endure. We will survive,” Harry said, making Isabella smirk.<br />
<br />
Isabella entered the car, squeezing herself inside. John’s eyes were glued to her. He must’ve thought his windows were glazed because she could see his stare right up until she got inside.<br />
The two spoke as little as they could to John, but of course he had to comment on Isabella’s breasts, saying they look wonderful… his version of a compliment it would seem. The two just ignored it until they got home.<br />
<br />
“Thanks again, John,” Harry said,<br />
“Yep, thanks,” Isabella said,<br />
“No problem. And hope you look a lot better next time I see you,” John called as he drove off.<br />
The two looked at each other and sighed,<br />
“I was ready for sex when we left,”<br />
“I literally never want to have sex again,” Isabella added,<br />
“You wanna just go to bed,”<br />
“Totally,”<br />
<br />
The two made their way into the apartment. Isabella stumbled through each room before landing at the bedroom. Harry walked past her and jumped straight onto the bed.<br />
Isabella, as much as she wanted to sleep, had a much better idea. She found her laptop, sat herself on the couch, and figured out how to use it with her much larger body and fingers. She ordered clothes. Lots of clothes, all for her and Harry to try on. She also ordered a couple extra items… just for fun. She selected premium delivery and placed her order. She closed the laptop, waddled her way over to the bed and laid herself down next to Harry.<br />
<br />
The two laid in silence for a few minutes before Harry perked up,<br />
“You wanna do it?”<br />
“I think I do…” Isabella said, looking at Harry, “oh yeah, I really wanna do it…”<br />
<br />

The card-box sat in the safe above Milo and Judy’s closet. It urged to be played. It’s only purpose was to be played, but not being played made it angry. But given it’s power was embedded within the players, it was at least getting some kind of satisfaction from it. But it still yearned.<br />
The game made a decision, now that it had become some-what attached to it’s hosts, that over the next week, it would pull a few cards of it’s own. To change the participants. To force them to come back. To never become too comfortable with their bodies.<br />
It wanted to be played soon.<br />
It was going to be played…<br />
<br />
Soon.</p>
