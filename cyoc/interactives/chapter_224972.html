<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After another quick session of the Hartpaws and Soulfangs  engaging in a furious sixty-nine session with each other, Edward the anthro fox furry and his wife Julia the anthro cougar furry, left the Soulfang residence to head home. They soon pass by the house in which they notice a man transform into and antro bear furry and a woman changing into a bald eagle furry. The couple smile as they hop the fence to see the couple making out in the back yard. They gave the two a moment to finish their passionate kiss before Edward made a polite cough.<br />
<br />
“Hello,” Edward approaching the anthro bear as he gets up; “my wife and I couldn’t help but notice you transforming as we passed by earlier and wanted to check up on you.”<br />
“Did you give us this gift,” the man staring at the fox anthro questionly.<br />
“No,” Edward answering; he quickly explains that they were following her daughter and cleaning up her mess when the spot the couple transforming from coming in contact with her sexual fluids.<br />
“We already admonished her for not being careful,” Julia speaking up; “but the desire to spread this wonderful gift to others can not be denied.”<br />
“I’m not complaining,” the anthro bear examining his now buff albeit hirsute physique. Approaching the couple he extends his hand paw to the anthro fox; “name is Bob Clawfoot. This is my wife Atoli,” Bob gesturing to the anthro bald eagle.<br />
<br />
Before Atoli can extend her taloned hand, a baby monitor chimes in and the sound of a crying newborn could be heard.<br />
“She probably needs her diaper changed,” Atoli heading inside.<br />
“She could also be hungry my dear,” Bob nodding; “if you need to nurse her, please bring her out here. I would like to watch her change.”<br />
“I’ll be a few minutes,” Atoli nodding as she walks inside; her taloned feet clicking on the concrete before she enters through the sliding glass door.<br />
“We are new parents,” Bob beaming; “our daughter is only three months old.”<br />
“You clearly look happy at being a father,” Edward smiling through his vulpine muzzle; recalling the memory of holding onto his daughter as she was born twenty years ago. While the memory was when he was human, it was still a moment he treasured and looking at his wife; is eager to repeat.<br />
<br />
“Happy but stressed,” Bob sighing as he offer the fox and cougar furry a seat on the patio and began to tell a sad tale. He explains how he came from a restrictive fundamentalist religious sect in the middle of nowhere in Montana and how his family was the type of people to stay away from.<br />
“My parents were the definition of conspiracy theorists,” Bob growling; “flatearthers, anti-vaxxers, creationists you name it, they are it. They are so conservative, they make the current Republican party look like fire brand liberals,” Bob Clawfoot sighing; “plus they are xenophobic racists. They do not approve of my wife because she is of Asian descent.”<br />
<br />
Before Julia or Edward could speak, Atoli returns to the patio with a fussy girl wear a fresh diaper.<br />
“She needed a change,” Aloti sitting down and offering a breast to hungry infant. The child eagerly latched onto the breast and started suckling. Atoli breathed a sigh of contentment while Bob gently stoked his daughters head. All watched as the three month old child began to rapidly develop a thick coat of black fur. Her feet quickly morphed into bear paws while her hands shortly followed suit. Her face pushed out into and ursine muzzle with tiny round ears at the top of her head. She continued to suckle as Atoli got her cub to switch breasts just as tiny runes appeared in the baby’s arms and legs.<br />
<br />
“She takes after her father,” Julia purring as she looks at the tiny anthro black bear cub furry; “what is her name?”<br />
“Her name is Sora Clawfoot,” Atoli answering; “we named her after my late mother.”<br />
“I’m sure is smiling in spirit,” Edward nodding; “do your crazy parents know of their grand-daughter?”<br />
“Unfortunately yes,” Bob growling; the low rumble caused Sora to start crying, fortunately, Atoli was able to quickly calm her down with a soft lullaby in Japanese as the baby continued to suckle.<br />
<br />
Bob continues to explain that his parents were less than thrilled that he met his wife while attending college. Even less thrilled that he and Atoli eloped and had a simple ceremony done at the court house.<br />
“They found out four months ago that I was going to be a father and wanted to have a relationship with their grandchild,” Bob seeing his daughter has finished feeding and takes the now sleeping infant off of his wife’s talons. “The fact that I reminded them that their grand-daughter is half Japanese and I am still married to my wife was a sore festering wound that was just waiting to flare up.”<br />
“I take it,” Edward’s vulpine ears going flat as an instinctual reaction to sadness; “that your ultra conservative parents were not thrilled at those revelations.”<br />
“It went as well as trying to convince them that vaccines do not contain RFID tags meant to track and keep the population docile,” Bob snorting. Pausing to give his daughter a light kiss with his muzzle before handing the infant back to Atoli.<br />
“I apologize,” Bob sighing as Atoli takes the now settled cub back inside; “We only just met and I’m already unloading on you. The fact is, we only just moved to town to escape my family’s toxic drama. It has been stressful, what with my new job at the local pharmacy and Atoli still on maternity leave from her tech support job.”<br />
“It’s alright,” Edward nodding in understanding; “we all get those days were we are pulled in too many directions. The first thing is to take care of what is important to you.”<br />
“Right now,” Bob getting up; “that is making sure my wife and daughter are safe. That won’t happen until my parents are out of my life permanently.”<br />
“I’m not the one to advocate violence,” Edward not liking where this is going; “please don’t do anything rash that will expose us before we are the dominate sapient species on this planet.”<br />
“I won’t lie,” Bob looking thoughtful; “the thought of mauling and clawing them to death after becoming a furry did cross my mind. But I have a more delightfully idea in mind for revenge,” Bob grinning as he picks up his smart phone and types out a simple text message before sending it.<br />
“The advantages of escaping a fundamentalist sect being investigated by more federal agencies than you can count,” Bob nodding at the reply on his phone; “you know where the skeletons are hiding. The secrets that can bring down a cult and its leaders,” Bob eliciting a menacing toothy grin; “let’s see mom and dad weasel their way out of this mess.”<br />
“Mess,” Julia looking worried but also curious as to what Mr. Clawfoot is referencing.<br />
“Child trafficking, abuse and exploitation,” Bob answering flatly; “my sister and brother are still trapped under mom and dad’s abusive rule. They already promised my twelve year sister to a forty year old pastor who was expelled from the Mormon Church. And they treat my fourteen year old brother as their personal butler.&quot;<br />
“Oh, that is not right,” Edward looking shocked; “how can we help?”<br />
“Thank you,” Bob smiling; “but I got this.”</p>
