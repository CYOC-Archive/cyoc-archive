<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;See not so bad is it?&quot; Asks Sam smiling<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no&quot; you reply feeling giddy &quot;I thought it be pretty bad but...it isn't!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right then!&quot; says Sam as she take her hand off your shoulder and heads to the exit &quot;Want a tour of the place?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A tour?&quot; you ask looking away from your reflection<br />
<br />
&quot;Well yeah&quot; she replies putting a hand on her hip &quot;If your going to be staying here you might as well meet everyone&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Staying?&quot; you say slightly puzzled &quot;What do you mean stay here? Can't I go home?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam's face darkens a bit as she replies &quot;The island and port have been locked down. No one can get in and no one can get out. Sorry but you are stuck here for quite a while yet&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How long is a while?&quot; you ask flustered, you tail flicking to show it<br />
<br />
&quot;At least.....a month&quot; She replies pushing her glasses up &quot;At the least&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A MONTH?!&quot; you shout angrily &quot;I have to stay here for a month?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Afraid so&quot; Sam replies crossing her arms &quot;They have a complete lockdown everytime a....subject escapes. And they do not stop until they have been caught or...&quot;<br />
<br />
You don't even need to here the rest as you cut in &quot;Killed...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam looks and you apologetically and sighs saying &quot;Yea...killed&quot;<br />
<br />
You sit down to absorb it in. You're speechless. 'Complete lockdown until caught....or killed...me...killed&quot; You mind races with the seriousness of the situation, thinking of all the ways in that you could get caught, or killed, of how little time you might have left. You don't want to die. Not yet you still haven't done everything that you have ever wanted to do. Being an astronaut, eating an exotic dish, going to foreign countries, having sexual relations with another person (same sex or opposite) any and all these things that you may or may not have thought of could never happen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry though&quot; Sam announces &quot;We won't let that happen!&quot;<br />
<br />
You look up from your seating position at her and ask &quot;We?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Sam replies smiling putting her hands on her hips again &quot;Everyone here is committed to stopping the Pleasure Island from becoming too powerful from changing reluctant people into animals. We kinda just call ourselves the Island liberation front, or ILF&quot;<br />
<br />
You look at her with.....bemusement &quot;ILF?&quot;<br />
<br />
She scratches the side of her face as she replies &quot;...uh..yeah I know the name sucks but everyone thought it would best fit our cause. We could all come up with names, I put forward the name Destroyers of the Island, it got 5 votes. You should have heard some of the others though like Animal Justice squad, Sexual Efficient Xenophobes and The thundercats. They where all pretty bad to say the least&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yours wasn't any better&quot; You mumble to yourself<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway since you will be staying here it is best to meet the others so you don't get...spooked by some of them&quot; Sam continues regaining her composure<br />
<br />
&quot;Spooked?&quot; you ask getting up from you seat &quot;Are there spider ones ore something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no no we haven't got any spiders here, thank god&quot; She replies mumbling the last bit under her breath &quot;But some of the people here are a bit.....sexual&quot;<br />
<br />
You blush slightly as you remember the couple in room 12, your tail flicking to show it.<br />
<br />
&quot;So&quot; Sam says opening the door &quot;Wanna tour?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure&quot; you reply exiting the showers<br />
<br />
Sam smiles at you as you exit the room and then BAM! You get knocked on your arse as someone runs into you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ow!&quot; you shout as you land hard, just missing landing on your tail<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh sorry lady!&quot; Says a young male voice &quot;Here let me help you up&quot;<br />
<br />
You take the paw in front of you...'Wait paw?&quot; you think. You look up and see a fox...well you first think it is a fox in front of you, a big fox walking upright, but on closer inspection you see that it does have human characteristics. Such as brown hair, hands and fingers (although padded and with claws instead of nails, which is why you thought it was a paw) and while the face was like that of a fox it was not 100% fox, more like 50% fox 50% human. It was pointed slightly with light dabs of orange, black and white fur over his face, his nose still kinda resembled a human one but was more like a snout as it was black and slightly moist. He seemed to be covered in the same colour fur all over him and he had Fox ears on top of his head, and a tail swishing behind him. He seems to be 14-15 years old.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kit!&quot; Shouts Sam angrily &quot;Watch where you are going next time! You could have seriously hurt her!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Sam!&quot; He replies hanging his head &quot;I was chasing after my Sister&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sune?&quot; She replies tilting her head &quot;What'd she do this time?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She...uh&quot; He fidgets as he answers &quot;She stole my underwear&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh not again!&quot; Sam says huffing &quot;Sune! Sune where are you?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm right here!&quot; Replies a girl around the corner behind you &quot;What do you want?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Turning around you see another fox, albeit female this time 'Definitely female&quot; you think as all she is wearing is a tank top and black nickers. She has the same colouration as Kit only she has red hair and seems to have two tails instead of one and looks to be further along her transformation than Kit. She looks 18 years old.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what I want! Give Kit his underwear back!&quot; Sam tells Sune Authoritatively <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh that&quot; She replies scratching her red hair &quot;I already put them back as soon as I saw, well smelt, you nearby&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah learning your lesson now are we?&quot; Sam asks with a wicked grin &quot;You know what happens when you cause trouble. Don't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yes ma'am&quot; She replies seeming to shrink in-front of Sam.<br />
<br />
&quot;:sigh: Honestly you're the eldest sibling you should know better!&quot; Sam says sighing letting her coldness seep away &quot;You know how much trouble you can cause, directly or indirectly&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I know&quot; Sune replies her shoulders sagging slightly &quot;It just got boring&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly she notices you and her eyes seem to light up &quot;Who's this?&quot; she asks pointing her thumb at you &quot;She the new girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes&quot; Sam replies, who seemed to have forgotten you &quot;This is luna, she is a wolf hybrid&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hybrid eh?&quot; Sune says looking you up and down &quot;I'm Sune. I'm a beastman. And this is my little brother Kit also a beastman but not as far along as me&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Beastman?&quot; You ask wiping your Jeans<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh right forgot to tell you the types&quot; Sam says smacking her forehead<br />
<br />
&quot;Still forgetful as always?&quot; Sune asks laughing slightly &quot;You never change&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam takes out a sort of leaflet out from her back pocket and gives it to you. On the front is a the words &quot;The stages and types of transformee's&quot; in bold letters with a picture of a man on the front wearing a lab coat. Flicking through it Sam explains each page that has a type on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right now Luna there are three types of transformees&quot; Sam Starts to say knowledgeably, pushing her glasses up &quot;Each type of animal has different characteristics and can be distinguished by several ways. The first-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She doesn't need to hear how to distinguish them Sam!&quot; Sune says, cutting Sam off &quot;Just tell her the different types. It's pretty easy to tell by looking anyway&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam looks like she had her wind taken away from her but obliges &quot;Fine&quot; She says disgruntled<br />
<br />
Turning a page you reach a picture of the same man from the front only this time he is sporting a tail and ears or a rat.<br />
<br />
&quot;The first is a hybrid stage&quot; Sam explains as you turned the page &quot;These are the earliest forms a transformee takes at the first stages of transformation. Being the first stage they are the least altered by substance A-105 and only experience the first pangs of change. Transformation can vary from person to person but one of the most common routes it takes is the change to the ears, senses, smells and the addition of a tail, if the species they are transforming into has one. There are two types of Hybrids. Type 1 is very early on and they only develop the senses and gain slight changes to their ears. Type 2's, this is where you are Luna, are further along the progression line and have developed their senses to their fullest and have grown a tail and their ears change, they also come with the improved arousal, as you...know&quot;<br />
<br />
You blush slightly and nod. Looking to your right you see that Sune is also blushing, although it is kinda hard to tell because of the fur, but she is also smiling. You turn the page and see the same scientist again only this time he is covered in fur and his hands have become claws and his shoes have been ripped open by his new feet (paws?), the man looks quite bewildered.<br />
<br />
&quot;The second stage...&quot; Sam continues as you turned the page &quot;Is the beastman stage. This is where the Substance takes full effect and starts to turn the transformee fully into the animal. The transformee grows fur akin to the animal they are transforming into, their hands and feet become paws or claws and their faces start to form muzzles or beaks.In stage 2 there are 4 types; type 1's are very close to hybrid type 2's except that they have very slight tufts of fur growing and they have sharper features. Type 2's are further along the change and have grown more fur and have taken on more features of their animal, such as developing a slight muzzle and fingernails becoming claw like and padded, Kit is a Type 2.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep!&quot; Says Kit hopping on his toes as he is mentioned<br />
<br />
&quot;Quiet down pip-squeak&quot; Sune tells him darting a quick look of annoyance at him<br />
<br />
&quot;Bleugh!&quot; He sticks his out at her but she ignores him.<br />
<br />
&quot;:Ahem; Type 3's...&quot; Sam continues clearing her throat &quot;Are changed even more and have grown their full coat of fur, or feathers, have fully padded hands and feet with claws for nails (although not retractable), their face have formed a near complete muzzle or beak and their behaviour starts to mimic that of the animal they are transforming to&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm one of those&quot; Sune tells you half-heartedly &quot;If you didn't already guess that&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They also...&quot; Sam cuts in at the end of Sune's sentence &quot;Have an even more increased sexual drive than the previous types, which have all stayed at the level of a Hybrid type 2 to this point, also their sexual organs begin to become like their animal. Another point is that they also start to find clothing restricting and find it hard to wear bulky clothes, or wearing too much&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah&quot; Sune agrees leaning against a wall &quot;The heightened Sexual arousal can be a pain sometimes, and the reluctance to wear clothes. I basically had to force myself to wear just this&quot;<br />
<br />
She points at her tank top and nickers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway...&quot;Sam says clearing her throat again &quot;That brings us to type 4's, this is where the transformees is entering the last stage of their transformation and must take the cure quickly or turn into an animal completely. Their feet become more paw like and grow and stretch to become more like the animal they are turning into, their hands might also change but it varies from person to person. The sexual organs are now completely transformed to that of the animal they are becoming, this also sends the sexually arousal into a hightened state..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mean overdrive&quot; Sune chides in but with a serious expression<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes...overdrive&quot; Sam continues pushing her glasses back up again &quot;When this happens the transformee can completely submit and become the Animal almost instantaneously, or resist and be able to fight off the final stage but that depends solely of the person's willpower&quot;<br />
<br />
Silence permeates the hallway as she finished her sentence. 'Complete submission or last act of defiance...' Feeling sad for those who had reached this stage you turn the page again but already dreading the last stage. The last page has a picture of scraps and pieces of clothing spread everywhere and a single lone rat amidst them.<br />
<br />
&quot;The final stage...&quot; Sam begins after gaining at least some of her composure back &quot;Animal stage. As you can guess the transformee becomes the animal they where turning into. There are 2 types of these; the 1st type is complete transformation of the body and the mind; no memory of who they once were, who their family is and past experiences.A complete animal mind and the type 2's....the type 2's are probably worse off. They have completely become animals but have not done so in mind. They remember who they once where but they are at the complete mercy at their animal instincts and cannot resist them, they can even become influenced by their instincts and believe they are in a better existence now...they are not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-Why not?&quot; You ask reluctantly closing the leaflet &quot;Surely it is better to remember who they were than not to?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You see...&quot; Sam begins looking sad &quot;Knowing who you once were comes with a price. As they know they were once human their mind rejects what has happened to their body and starts to go into shutdown, they only usually live for a year...or worse they start to revert and die instantly midway...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Becky...&quot;you think aloud<br />
<br />
'What a terrible way to live...either you live your life as an animal...or die as a human' you think clenching your fists 'That is just not...right'<br />
<br />
&quot;Becky?&quot; Asks Sam sorrowfully &quot;Was that the other girl with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod as you feel yourself crying, it is odd you feel sad but you also don't feel like it is you crying, you feel like this isn't supposed to be real, like this shouldn't be happening to you. It just can't be, yesterday you where talking to Becky of the fun you would be having at Pleasure Island, going on the rides meeting a cute guy that one of you might fall in love with and &quot;Get it on&quot; with as Becky used to call it, pigging out on cheap theme park food and not eating a thing the next day to compensate. You want to go home, you want to see your family again, you want to have a normal life again....but you know that life will never be normal again now.<br />
<br />
Sam embraces you softly as you feel yourself crying, you know that crying won't help but you can't seem to stop it. It just keeps coming and seems to last for hours, although only minutes pass by.<br />
<br />
&quot;Better?&quot; Asks Sam leaning away from you to look at your face.<br />
<br />
You nod as you wipe away the last of your tears, you do feel better.<br />
<br />
&quot;See? Much better to let it out&quot; Sune replies as she appears next to you, putting a hand on you shoulder assuredly &quot;Believe me it is not good to keep it bottled up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally calm Sam lets go of you and takes the leaflet and put it back in her pocket. Kit looks up at you and smiles &quot;I'm glad you feel better now!&quot; He says with a childish grin. '14yrs old and still child-like' you think smiling at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;So...&quot; she says &quot;Ready to Start the tour?&quot;</p>
