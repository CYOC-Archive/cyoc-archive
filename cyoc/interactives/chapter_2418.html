<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt walked back to his bedroom.Brian Desoto could sort out his own problems.Matt was tired,he wanted 
<br />

<br />
to sleep.He put on his blue pajamas,then pulled down his pants so he could admire his new dick.
<br />

<br />
He didn't notice that the wand was sparking and casting off a blue light.There was a sputtering and 
<br />

<br />
crackling in the air,as if some wires had crossed and were short circuiting.On his night stand rested the 
<br />

<br />
latest novel Matt had been reading 20000 Leagues Under The Sea by Jules Verne.Matt yawned and 
<br />

<br />
placed the wand on top of the book.Suddenly there was a loud crackling noise and a blue glow surrounded
<br />

<br />
the room.When the light died away,Matt the wand ,the book and the nightstand had vanished.
<br />

<br />

<br />
1867
<br />

<br />
    The Nautilus was a submarine filled with women.It had all begun after Captain Nemo and his crew 
<br />

<br />
had managed to escape from the whirlpool.They had limped back to the mediterranean ,to friendlier and 
<br />

<br />
warmer waters.The sub's electropiles were depleted,and they would need new supplies of  coal,sulphuric acid 
<br />

<br />
and lead to replenish them before they could resume their war against war.To purchase supplies they would 
<br />

<br />
need gold and they headed straight to the lost city of Atlantis,where they knew treasures were stacked in 
<br />

<br />
abundance.Whilst walking on the sea bottom they came upon a ruined temple and entered it.Unknownst to
<br />

<br />
them it was dedicated to the Mother Goddess Mithras,and they desecrated it by removing a medallion they
<br />

<br />
found hanging around the statues neck.Captain Nemo had barely exited the temple and was heading  back to 
<br />

<br />
his sub when the itching and tingling sensations began.But when your a 1000 feet down,you attrbute it to the 
<br />

<br />
bends.He got aboard the sub and first noticed that the hand helping him aboard had taken on a feminine 
<br />

<br />
appearance.It was when he pulled off the hard hat and luxerious tresses of golden black hair fell down to
<br />

<br />
his waist that he really got worried.When he had trouble pulling off the diving suit over the two soft 
<br />

<br />
mounds on his chest and felt a tightness from his diving pants caused by his expanding belly and  hips 
<br />

<br />
he uttered a involuntary feminine shriek.Within the hour everybody aboard the sub had been transformed into a 
<br />

<br />
pregnant mother to be.When Mithra put her mind to it,she was thorough.
<br />

<br />
This  had given everybody something else to do than make war,and over the next six months the Nautilus
<br />

<br />
had served as a underwater maternity ward.When someone dug up an old yankee newspaper with a story
<br />

<br />
which claimed Jefferson Davies had been caught wearing petticoats,the Lost Cause got a more sympathetic
<br />

<br />
hearing from Captain Nemo and her crew.They had raised the Confederate flag from the periscope and 
<br />

<br />
played Dixie over the ships vocal apparatus system.They painted the sub in confederate grey and were still
<br />

<br />
debating whether to start sinking yankee warships or find some more motherly way of promoting the 
<br />

<br />
Confederacy.Perhaps a underwater kingdom.They certainly had the means and the will.
<br />

<br />
Captain Nemo was relaxing.She had undone the snaps on her corset and her daughter was hungrily 
<br />

<br />
feeding on one of her mothers nipples.The older women were playing bridge in the lounge deep within and
<br />

<br />
others strolled the decks with their parasols.The cabin girls had put on their swimming trunks and were
<br />

<br />
splashing and swimming in the calm waters to the port side of the Nautilus.The lookouts had reported
<br />

<br />
no sightings of any whaleboats or any other sign of trouble.Captain Nemo prepared to walk down the
<br />

<br />
hatchway and back to her cabin.She needed more room to store her dressed and toiletries,and though she'd 
<br />

<br />
put it off for a year,she'd decided to throw away her old mens clothing.They'd had to retailor the diving
<br />

<br />
suits to fit their new feminine forms,but her old uniform and pants weren't worth the bother.It was cheaper
<br />

<br />
to just visit an old shipwreck and salvage another chest of gold.
<br />

<br />
Captain Nemo was halfway into the hatch when the area was lit up by a flash of bright bluish light.She was
<br />

<br />
momentarily blinded,but when she recovered her first action was to refasten her corset and head back onto
<br />

<br />
the deck,with a hungry crying Julie in tow.The cabin girls were screaming and paddling frantically in the 
<br />

<br />
water,trying to hide their modesty from the stranger.He stood there,a large cannonball sized sac between 
<br />

<br />
his legs and a long two foot shaft p5roudly erect.He was dressed in a weird blue outfit she could not place
<br />

<br />
and his pants were down.Captain Nemo thought to herself&quot;it's a damn yankee spy,and a queer one at that&quot;
<br />

<br />
One of the crew rushed up to the intruder and pulled a derringer from out of her cleavage.
<br />

<br />
            Matt looked up from his dick and into the business end of a small pistol.He could feel the 
<br />

<br />
throbbing of the iron deck beneath his socked feet and could feel  his shaft begin to throb in rhythm
<br />

<br />
with the submarines engines.He could feel another one coming on.His horny thoughts were interupted
<br />

<br />
by the pistol wielders next words said in a decidedly southern drawl&quot;spread down on the deck you 
<br />

<br />
damn yankee,before i put a ball in your brains&quot;
<br />

<br />
All the ladies were marching up to their sister.One of them pointed out to the want,book and  nightstand 
<br />

<br />
floating in the water right beside the deck.Magazines were starting to float out of the partially submerged
<br />

<br />
piece of furniture and the cabin girls splashed  about retrieving the stuff.
<br />

<br />
         Slowly Matt tried to rest down flat on the deck,but as his sac contacted the deck he could feel that 
<br />

<br />
throbbing again.God,this felt good!</p>
