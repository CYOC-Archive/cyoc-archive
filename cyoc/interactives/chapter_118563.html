<br />
&quot;There. I&#39;m all unpacked,&quot; announced Tom Herald, showing off his now empty suitcase.<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; announced his fiance, Alice Stevens, as she walked over to hug him. &quot;We can move the rest of your things from that apartment to <i>our</i> house tomorrow,&quot; she said, before kissing him.<br />
Tom liked the sound of the word OUR, but loved the tender kiss the lady in his arms gave him more.<br />
&quot;There&#39;s... something I want to share with you,&quot; said Tom, looking deeply in her eyes.<br />
&quot;Oh? Now what could that be?&quot; she wondered, as one hand slowly reached down to the object of pleasure between Tom&#39;s legs.<br />
While the happy couple were both in their normal forms at the moment, they knew it wouldn&#39;t be long before clothes were discarded in favor of two amorous werefoxes taking their love to a more physical level that night as part of the mutual bliss shared because of the life/soul mate bond between them.<br />
&quot;Actually, it&#39;s this,&quot; said Tom, breaking away from the lady to reach underneath a pillow of the king sized bed they now shared for the object he hid there earlier.<br />
<br />
Alice looked at the flat, rectangular shaped object as Tom brought it up into full view. &quot;A DVD movie?&quot;<br />
&quot;Not just any movie,&quot; began Tom, showing her the box. &quot;The one that started it all for me, the Walt Disney Studios&#39; version of <i>Robin Hood</i>. The one that depicted Robin and Marion as anthropomorphic foxes. The first time I ever saw it was as a little kid when my mom got me the DVD as a birthday present,&quot; said Tom, looking down at the cover with a drawing of the cast on it. &quot;To this day, I have no idea what it was that first attracted me to the vulpine version of the lady, but this vixen was definitely my first crush,&quot; he added, before looking back up at Alice.<br />
&quot;I know every line of dialog, every word of every song by heart. Over the years, there were times when I found myself checking out other... furry material, but unless it involved a werevixen, I just wasn&#39;t interested because nothing and no one could ever compare to <i>my</i> Maid Marion... until I met you,&quot; confessed Tom, before kissing Alice again.<br />
&quot;Oh Tom...&quot; moaned Alice, as his lips left hers to start nuzzling her neck. &quot;Maybe it was the first stirrings of your inner were. Who knows. But you&#39;re here now, with me, and that&#39;s all that matters. We can watch it whenever and as often as you like, together. But not tonight,&quot; she added, gently taking the DVD box from his hands to lay it respectfully on the nightstand behind him.<br />
Then she turned her attention back to him and resumed the romantic kissing, even as Alice started unbuttoning her fiance&#39;s shirt.<br />
Tom smiled as he reached behind her, one hand slowly pulling down the zipper in the back of her dress as the other lovingly caressed the exposed skin.<br />
As a were, Alice never saw the need to wear a bra despite her bountiful bosom.<br />
In moments like this, she was seriously glad for that decision as Tom&#39;s hands moved forward, pulling the top of her dress away from her body even as they continued to kiss.<br />
<br />
Alice started running her hands up and down Tom&#39;s now bare chest. They would break apart soon enough to completely undress and assume their fursonas, but not at this exact moment as he pulled her closer, the tips of Alice&#39;s hard nipples pressing against his flesh.<br />
&quot;Do you know how much I love you Alice Stevens?&quot; he asked, finally tearing himself away long enough to talk.<br />
&quot;At least as much as I love you Tom Herald,&quot; she replied, backing away from him just long enough to kick off her shoes and finish taking off her dress.<br />
Then, just standing before him in her underwear, Alice reached out to unfasten Tom&#39;s belt buckle.<br />
Tom issued a yip of pleasure as he tossed his shirt aside, then reached out to touch and feel every inch of his lover&#39;s body he could.<br />
As his hands reached her shapely bottom and began to remove her panties, Tom felt the fur begin to grow as the start of what would become her tail formed within his grasp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...&quot; Alice moaned, for no one had ever thought to hold her in that way as she released her inner vixen.<br />
Then, with his pants down around her fiance&#39;s ankles, vulpine paws pulled down her mate&#39;s boxers as she drank in his heady, manly scent through the sensitive nose of her now completed muzzle.<br />
Kicking off his shoes and shoving his pants out of the way with one leg was all Tom needed to do before assuming his vulpine form.<br />
He could hear Alice express her delight as what was an ordinary human penis within her mouth grew larger until it became her mate&#39;s proud vulpine foxhood.<br />
With a demur look in her eyes, Alice raised her head to stare at him, still lovingly licking the tip of his red rocket as her paws caressed Tom&#39;s inner thighs.<br />
He simply smiled at her as he reached out to help her up.<br />
There would be plenty of time for what she was doing at the moment, but right now he wanted a more complete union.<br />
<br />
While it was a human male and female that started this chain of events, it was a loving werefox and his vixen that would consummate the affair.<br />
Alice laid across their bed with her legs wide open, a smile on her muzzle as her tail started twitching to show her pleasure and expectation at what was about to happen.<br />
Tom smiled back at his mate before bowing his head just long enough to inhale the enticing aroma coming from where he would soon be, then teased Alice with a tantalizing lick of her now very moist labia lips before mounting her.<br />
Man and woman wrapped their arms around each other as best they could as Alice locked Tom into place with her legs, not that he was planning to go anywhere other than deeper into her chalice with his hard werefoxhood.<br />
Soon the happy were couple in love were yipping in mutual pleasure as a fantastic orgasm raced through their bodies, the first of many they would have that night and in the years to come.<br />
No pun intended.<br />

{{At this point folks, I honestly don&#39;t remember what the specific options were for this thread. Hopefully<br />
 the next contributor can carry on from here, but don&#39;t worry, the <i>Moon Lake, Andersons</i> thread<br />
 is on &quot;Friday night&quot; now, with the confrontation and aftermath of the Jennifer Harper/Harold Jenkins wedding &quot;Saturday morning&quot;.—tmw.}}</p>
