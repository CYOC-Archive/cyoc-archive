<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Having fun with this dread scene.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The realization that he could move while being surrounded by so many folks slowly encroached into Mannick&#39;s helmeted head, along with the gradual memories coming in. <br />
<br />
In his reverie while looking at his reflection in the silver tray, he could notice the shine on his reflection turn silvery-blue-ish. While the chainmail on his neck shifts aside as Manny&#39;s muscular form grew to also change him, he had a thought.<br />
<br />
<i> I&#39;m not frozen... that means I&#39;m no longer bound by Merlin&#39;s costume design and becoming a proper golem knight of the frat-</i><br />
<br />
He shuddered as his gauntlets held the silver tray, staring as his red glow marking his two eyes change into a deep, purple color. The satyrs around him were boisterously admiring him as they frolicked around and sexually engaged. Their act fueling the magic flowing into Mannick&#39;s golem body underneath his armor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, it&#39;s Lord Mithral, he&#39;s so big.&quot; One satyr moaned as he was hugged from behind by another. <br />
<br />
Mannick had the mind to look at the satyr that had called his name-<br />
<br />
&quot;L-Lord Mithral?&quot; Mannick had the mind to question that, confusion as he rebuked. &quot;My name&#39;s Lord Mith-&quot;<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t remember what his moniker was. What was his name that Merlin bestowed this armor with? <br />
<br />
It was Lord Mithral right?<br />
<br />
&quot;Manny, please, snap out of it.&quot; Mannick pleaded to the reflection in the silver tray, hoping that somehow Manny would break free from the mind shift before they truly became one. &quot;I can&#39;t do this alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we&#39;re one and the same.&quot; Mannick found himself replying back to his own pleading. Shaking his head, he knew that maybe he could break the fusion by taking his helmet off. The mannequin servant he took the tray from was still standing loyally at his side awaiting further orders, the returning of the silver tray to its hands completed as it walked away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, prepare to come apart and be separate Manny.&quot; Mannick moved to place his thick gauntlets to his helm, trepidation filling his non-existent heart as he exhaled a dark fog. He pushed up.<br />
<br />
Again. He knew that his material being mithral would have weighed half as much as similar items forged from steel, affording him a heavy and thick build. But even he knew his helmet shouldn&#39;t be this hard to remove!<br />
<br />
His arms consisting of his pauldrons, rerebrace, couter, vambrace and gauntlets refused to move further up. Or rather, his helmet was stuck onto his neck, or his body was preventing him from taking off his own head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, the protection runes to prevent me from falling apart outside the repair shop would stop me.&quot; Mannick found himself rebutting his actions with a nonchalant tone. He balked at the realization that he couldn&#39;t take any of his parts off if he&#39;s not in the space of repair for the armor and golems.<br />
<br />
With how important he is now, being a protector and collector of magic for the Smith-Enchanter Zach, reality was updating completely to make him a figure of authority. His thick form was increasingly becoming more heavily armored and bulky over the thinner, weaker armor knights.<br />
<br />
Being a golem knight was a privilege, his mind helpfully supplied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lord Mithral,&quot; He froze as his name was called from behind, not because he was being observed but mostly from surprise from the voice at the back and inside his head. &quot;Are you alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mannick turned with the heavy grace that his body now naturally worked with, his sight seeing no one until he looked down and saw Sir Gold looking up at him. &quot;Yes...&quot; <br />
<br />
Mannick lied, or told the truth. One part of him was panicking, but a stronger, calmer part was like ice cold water over his entire buzzing mind. The folks partying around him was still infusing magic into him as they fucked and danced. Lust was heavy in the air as was the thrumming of the ley lines underneath his sabatons.<br />
<br />
The marble floor was cold as he regarded his underling. His voice was cold, monotone as he asked. &quot;Why do you... ask?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The interloper Merlin has not been found,&quot; Sir Gold, an armor knight that was just the same as every other armor knight except for its special magical matrix inside them. &quot;However, another has been found.&quot;<br />
<br />
A mental image was shared with him, the hive-mind link he had ignored to focus on his own mind forced upon him as he gawked at the connection. He was aware of everything as the armor knights reported directly to his mind. <br />
<br />
He could definitely use this to find Merlin, but for some reason the armor knights stationed everywhere in the frat could not see the wizard... <br />
<br />
Mannick had the slightest idea that Merlin was obfuscating himself with his own magic.<br />
<br />
The image he was shared with however showed a pledge, someone who wasn&#39;t yet part of the frat and would have to go through initiation. Something inside Mannick activated as he saw the uninitiated human walk around with drunken stupor.<br />
<br />
Without another word, Lord Mithral walked.<br />
<br />
Mannick&#39;s mind was silent. He couldn&#39;t think as security mode activated in his mind. He had a purpose and he will finish it. <br />
<br />
As he walked, the satyrs gave him a wide berth as the hallways were passed by the large and imposing metal golem. His sword was unsheathed from his scabbard as it was now gleaming with the very metal he was now, the bastard sword swaying as he walked with resolute programming.<br />
<br />
The lighting of the frat made the red and purples of the carpeting and curtains pop with lust and passion igniting colors. The glass windows a solid wall to the outside world that was unchanging yet as the magic he was collecting continued to build up in anticipation. The white walls of the hallways were adorned with moving figures embedded into the walls performing explicitly sexual acts.<br />
<br />
Public display of porn in the walls inciting more sex.<br />
<br />
Soon enough he found the pledge, the programming to initiate blazing in his mind. Despite his heavy thuds and armor clanking, he managed to reach the man and plunge his bastard sword into his back. The lanky man with black hair, the only physical descriptors Lord Mithral could see from the back, as he froze as the blade sunk to the hilt into his back.<br />
<br />
Lord Mithral could feel the wetness of the man&#39;s rear entrance around his ramrod dildo, his sword penetrating deeply into the man.<br />
<br />
The man moaned as Lord Mithral brought him closer, skewered. As he did, he could see there was no sword poking out from the front of the pledge. It was as if his bastard blade disappeared inside the pledge.<br />
<br />
His magic began to flow into the man, rewriting the very physical and mentality of the person as more of the essence of the human was pushed down, the glow from his head rapidly sinking to the man&#39;s cock. <br />
<br />
Muscles began to bulge on the man as he took on fur, his hair joining the fur in blackness. Claws sprouted from the moaning man, viciously sharp as he transformed on his blade. A thick bushy tail popped out from the man, just as his legs finished transforming into digitigrade stance.<br />
<br />
The man&#39;s head began to widen, as if becoming a block before his ears migrated to the top of his head, swam around in his headfur and split into six, before the very head shifted into a canine configuration and split into three with a howl.<br />
<br />
That announced his own as he came, his dildo within his codpiece spurting magic that didn&#39;t soil his armor. No, it immediately flowed into his sword as it flooded the now anthropomorphic cerberus, the glow shooting out of the beast&#39;s knotted cock. <br />
<br />
The essence of humanity in the man flowed back and splattered onto his codpiece, sinking in and entering his dildo piece and becoming stored in his golem core.<br />
<br />
He withdrew his sword, and Mannick stood in stunned stupor of what he had just done.<br />
<br />
The beast grabbed at his own cock and began walking off to join the satyrs. His bulging muscular body controlled by three heads. Mannick could recall the changes he forced onto the pledge, each head containing a quarter of the intelligence and personality traits of the man who he had been.<br />
<br />
Mannick had just transformed someone out of duty.<br />
<br />
He needed to find Merlin and quick. Before he lost Merlin&#39;s touch and could never find the wizard.</p>
