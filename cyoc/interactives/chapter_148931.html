<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chad heard Tyler call Bruno over.  Sure Bruno never changed out of his Speedo, but he was a dedicated swimmer.  He swam six to eight hours a day.  Chad recalled Coach Sinclair complaining about the number of towels Bruno went through a few years ago, but - wait.  Bruno used a fresh towel all week, now.  So that&#39;s why Tyler was calling Bruno over.<br />
<br />
He heard the exchange between Bruno and Ty about having a brand new towel to use all month.  Chad mentally rolled his eyes.  He knew Bruno was gay, but he and Bruno were buds.  Now Bruno was burying his face inside Chad the towel, and inhaling deeply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Smells like Chad?&quot; Tyler replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Prolly they use the same fabric softener scent as Chad&#39;s mom uses,&quot; said Bruno inhaling again.<br />
<br />
&quot;My mom only uses unscented - oh, damn, you recognize my body odor? Bruno, it&#39;s me, it&#39;s Chad!&quot; screamed Chad mentally. Bruno wandered off with his face half buried in Chad sniffing him.  Chad hadn&#39;t realized how seriously Bruno had been interested in him.  He could hear Tyler laughing faintly in the distance.<br />
<br />
There was a blast of heat.  Oh, good, the sauna, or is that bad? Chad wasn&#39;t sure.   Bruno spread Chad out on the bench, peeled off his wet suit, which he spread on the rail next to the heater to dry, and lay face down - and boner down - on his towel.<br />
<br />
Bruno remarked, &quot;Having a towel that smells like Chad is cool, but I prefer making my towel smell like me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then he began humping the towel on the bench.  Chad got scrunched up around Bruno&#39;s pounding cock.  It was weird, Chad was a towel, so it was just a wank off session, but the way Bruno did it, it felt like sex.  Chad usually enjoyed sex, but then he was usually on the giving end.  After Bruno exploded into the rich terry cloth towel, Bruno straightened it out, and lay back down.  He was still hard and leaking, and maybe there was a chance Tyler or a coach would look in the sauna. No students probably for at least another half hour.   Chad was confused the sweating, the throbbing, the scent of sex were all pretty moving.  But he was a towel and Bruno didn&#39;t know that he really was Chad, did he? He wasn&#39;t sure to be grateful for the tension relief, he was a lot less on edge than he had been, or to be angry at Bruno for raping him.  Was this what Ty had planned?  Why?  He had never - well, he knew Ty had done a lot of stuff for the team, but that was his job.  Chad shouldn&#39;t thank him for doing his job.  He never did anything extra for Chad that Chad knew of?  Maybe he was turning the entire team into towels.  Now that was a scary thought, how could Chad warn his teammates.<br />
<br />
BING.  BING. BING!<br />
<br />
Bruno got up, reset his alarm, toweled off his sweaty coated body, headed to the showers, hung Chad on a hook, and showered for a few minutes.  He pulled Chad off the hook, and thoroughly dried off using Chad.  He whipped Chadtowel between his legs, grabbed the other end, and started pulling Chad back and forth  across his cock and balls and up his butt crack.  Chad thought he&#39;d do this one or two times, then he realized Bruno was hard again, and he was using this method to jack off.  Chad wanted to sob.  He felt so used.<br />
 <br />
Then through the shower room doorway, Chad could see the towel cage with Ty sitting there and watching the show that Bruno was putting on.  Splooge. Mop, mop.  Tossed over Bruno&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
Bruno strutted naked over to Ty,  and said, &quot;Thanks for the towel, Ty.  It&#39;s the best towel, I ever had.  I didn&#39;t know a towel could be this fluffy, soft, and absorbent and smell so good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty laughed, &quot;I&#39;m glad I found someone who would appreciate it.&quot;<br />
<br />
BING. BING. - Bruno silenced his alarm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Time for more heat in the sauna.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have fun, Bruno.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I will.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh, no, thought Chad.   His fears were justified.  <br />
<br />
Bruno had found a new challenge to drown out Chad&#39;s scent with his own.  Before his study hour ended, Chad absorbed four of Bruno&#39;s loads.  Tired after the exertion, Bruno showered once, toweled off, pulled on his Speedo, and hung Chadtowel in his locker for most of the day. Then he was taken out when Bruno went for his afternoon/evening swim practice.  And after practice more jerking off in the sauna, but this time with other guys.  And then left in the locker overnight.  <br />
<br />
The next morning Bruno must&#39;ve arrived at 5 am.  Chad heard him talking with the janitor, who said he should wait until the coaches come into use the pool, but sure he could use the therapy pool and sauna. It seemed pretty intense.  Sauna, jerk off, shower, sauna, jerk off, sauna.  SNIFF.  SNIFF. SNIFF.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, it still smells like Chad!&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad knew he was in trouble.  Bruno was one of those people who would assault a challenge with all their might.  Years ago, he had been challenged to swim 100 laps in a row.  He nearly drowned, but he did it.  Bruno wasn&#39;t going to stop until Chad was like Bruno&#39;s other towels and smelled like him.  At lunch hour, Bruno collected his towel from his locker, and wore it out to the picnic area across his shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;New look for you, Bruno, I&#39;ve never seen you with a towel at lunch,&quot; snickered Rick wondering if Bruno planned to jack off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha, I&#39;m just going to work on my tan,&quot; explained Bruno spreading Chad out on the grass, and lying down.<br />
<br />
I had felt weirdly normal to Chad for a few minutes.  There was Rick , Rod, Bruno and Mark and Mike, and Cindy, and Meghan and it was lunch time.  What he would give for a burrito.  Oh, right, he was on strict sausage liquid diet now.  <br />
<br />
A muddy tennis shoe stomped on the corner of Chadtowel.  Bruno looked up at Ty.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re standing on my towel.  The towel I use to wipe my body, Ty,&quot; Bruno said pointedly.<br />
<br />
Ty removed his foot, but said, &quot;You know you&#39;ve laid your towel where Coach Sinclair walks his dog, don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bruno shrugged, stretched out and continued to work on his tan.<br />
<br />
Chad was pretty sure the message was meant for Chad and not Bruno.<br />
<br />
This was typical of each day for the rest of the week.  As Bruno packed it in, actually pulling on street clothes over his Speedo after practice, Coach Sanchez reminded him,  &quot;Pool&#39;s closed this weekend for acid wash.  You&#39;ll have to practice at the Y, Bruno.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, coach.  I&#39;ll need this then,&quot; Bruno said opening his locker and grabbing Chadtowel,  he explained as he shoved the towel into his swim bag, &quot;Y doesn&#39;t provide towels.  You have to bring them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad didn&#39;t know it then, but he would never spend a night in the locker  again.  Bruno would always take his towel home with him.</p>
