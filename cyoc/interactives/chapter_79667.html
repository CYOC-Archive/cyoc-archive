<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cameron, barefoot, walked into the almost empty weight room.  The only other person was Jake, a bodybuilder jock.  With his shirt off, Jake was at the bench press knocking out his last set.  Just as he finished Cameron walked up, already getting a hard on.  He didn't know Jake very well since he was a grade above him, but Cameron knew he wasn't gay.  Not knowing what to say to a hot, straight guy, Cameron spouted, &quot;Damn, you're sweaty.&quot;  He wanted to say damn you're hot.<br />
<br />
Jake, out of breath, looked at Cameron with surprise, &quot;Yeah I just beat my max,&quot; Jake grabbed a towel, wiping the sweat from his face, then asked, &quot;You're Cameron, right? I never see you in the gym.  When did you bulk up?&quot;  Cameron looked at his arms and legs which had become significanty muscular.  He flexed.  He seemed to have gained about 10 lbs, making him even hornier.  Smiling, Cameron remarked, &quot;Oh, it seems I could fit in my clothes just yesterday.  Even my shoes have been tight.&quot;  Jake looked at Cameron's bare feet, &quot;I can see that.  Well, I'm about to shower for class.&quot;<br />
<br />
Still in mythology class, Ty visualized the scene.  He knew Cameron would make his move on Jake in the shower room, and Ty would make sure it was successful.  To Ty, Jake was an arrogant, jock who hated everyone except his own kind.  He was always struggling to pass, and made others (sometimes Ty) do his schoolwork.  Ty decided Jake's fate would be similar to Cameron's except worse- he would go all the way to bull - permanently.  Ty made his wish and watched.<br />
<br />
Cameron followed Jake into the shower.  Removing his shirt to also take a shower, Cameron further noticed how muscular he was, now with a well-defined six pack.  Also his skin had grown a very light and fine layer of brown fur, making him appear more tan.  He was too horny to question this, however.  Suddenly, Jake turned to Cameron eying his now muscular ass, &quot;Damn, you're sexy Cameron.  This might be crazy, but I want your asshole.&quot;  Cameron turned around smiled, &quot;I want your cock in my asshole!&quot;<br />
<br />
Cameron got on his knees.  Jake sat back on the bench.  Jakes dick was now stretching the waistband of his shorts.  With a little tug, it popped out all seven inches to see.  Pulling down Jakes shorts revealed his swelling balls.  Cameron's now slightly broader nose, took in Jakes scent.  He ran his tongue along the length Jake's penis, smiled, and looked up at, Jake.  Jake nearly cummed right there and said, &quot;Wow, Cameron you have the sexiest long, tongue.&quot;  Cameron laughed, &quot;Then this ought to be really sexy.&quot;  With that Cameron put Jake's dick in his mouth, and began to blow it.  It wasn't long before he was deep throating the whole thing.  Cameron then realized how long his tongue really was.  With Jakes dick in the back of his throat, Cameron stretched his thick tongue over Jakes growing balls, then past them, then into Jakes asshole.  Cameron probed a good inch tasting Jakes sweaty ass.  This had Jake writhing in pleasure, as Cameron wriggled his tongue inside his man pussy.<br />
<br />
Not wanting Jake to finish, Cameron pulled off the now well lubricated cock.  Then Cameron noticed, Jakes dick was now 12 inches, much thicker, and dark brown.  His penis had attatched to his belly and grown a sheath, while his balls were dark leathery and the size of oranges.  Both were surprised, but neither seemed to care at the moment.  &quot;I want that cock in me,&quot; Cameron turned his large, toned ass toward Jake and pulled down his very stretched shorts.  &quot;Dude, you have a fucking tail!&quot;  Above Cameron's now black asshole swished a brown bull's tail, at the end a black tassle.  Jake paused, realizing for a second the absurdity of this situation.  &quot;Stuff that cock in my asshole, dammit!&quot;  With that Jake immediately pushed himself against Cameron.  His dick in Cameron's crack, Cameron arched his ass, rubbing his hungry hole against it.  Jake carefully pushed his dick against Cameron's tight virgin asshole.  Cameron sighed as his ass stretched the dick inside, but he pushed back wanting all of that bull cock in him.  The coarse hairs at the base of Cameron's bull tail rubbed against Jakes bull cock, stimulating him further.  Jake began to thrust, not realizing he had also grown a bull tail and was changing further.<br />
<br />
Both had gained considerable mass, but Jake had gained much more.  He looked like a heavyweight bodybuilder with a bull tail.  He threw this mass into his thrusting harder.  &quot; *ahh!* Pound my *ahh!* fuckhole *ahh*,&quot; Cameron panted.  &quot;I'll fuck the shit out of yoo-oooooooou!&quot; Jake mooed, as his face began to push out.  Jake snorted as his nose widened, and became black.  His ears stretched becoming cow ears, and horns grew from his head   Cameron barely responded, &quot;Feels *Ah!* so *Ah!* Goo-ooooooooood!&quot; Cameron mooed.  Cameron could feel Jake getting much heavier on his back, as his asshole was being abused.  Jake's legs began to change, with his much longer feet ending in hooves.  &quot;Oh my Go-oooooooo-od!&quot; Jake mooed as he ejaculated.  Cameron could feel his asshole fill with Jakes bull cum.  Cameron then ejaculated out of his now bull like dick, all over the floor.  Jake's dick pumped cum until it gushed out of Cameron's asshole, all over his groin and Cameron's bull tail.  Then Jake fell over on his side, and Cameron realized how much weight had been on his back.<br />
<br />
Ty saw all this and laughed.  Mythology had become even more interesting.</p>
