<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Getting back to his pc, Blake smile and started typing away.  He became so focused, he forgot his door was open and didn&#39;t notice Neal poking his head in the door.  &quot;Hey Blake,&quot; Neal said with a smile.  Blake almost jumped in surprise but turned his head and replied,&quot;Wassup Neal?&quot;  Neal walked into the room a little and stated, &quot;Was hoping you were hungry, I finished with my &#39;friend&#39; about 20 minutes ago and I&#39;m starving.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Blake just stared at him with a pointed look and sighed.  Neal knew his roommate was getting any action lately and when he asked Blake told him that every guy he asked had already been with him.  Neal felt bad about the situation, he even invited his roomie to join in when he found a guy who was up for a threesome, but he knew that wasn&#39;t something Blake really liked.  So he tried spending time with him and treating him out to hopefully patch things up with his long time friend.  &quot;Sure Neal, gimme a few minutes to get dressed and we can grab something.  Anyplace you want,&quot; Blake finally asked?  Neal smiled as he thought his friend wasn&#39;t too upset.  <br />
<br />
After a moment Neal agreed to Wendy&#39;s and went back into his room.  Blake for a few moments began to feel bad as he looked at the changes he had made to Neal&#39;s profile.  He decided to not put the changes into effect, and hang out with his roommate.  Grabbing a pair of jeans and shirt, Blake dressed quickly and made his way to his car.  He called out for Neal to hurry up and got a I&#39;m coming as a reply.  He laughed as he got to car and waited for another 5 minutes.  Blake groaned heading back into the apartment.  One thing about Blake was that he hated to wait if someone said they were coming.  As he turned his head into Neal&#39;s room he saw his roommate on his bed jacking off with his Iphone pointing towards his dick.  Neal had his eyes closed and let out a moan.  Blake watched for a moment then heard a voice saying, “Damn daddy when I can I have that in me?”  Neal still had his eyes closed and replied, “Shit as soon as I get something to eat.  You can come over and we can head to your place.”  <br />
<br />
Blake&#39;s left eye twitched at the sight and decided to put the Chronivac through its paces.  With a few more changes, he hits the accept changes button and has the Chronivac make so the changes happen or the next hour.   <br />
<br />
Returning to his car his calls his roommate and Neal responds with &quot;I had to drop a load.&quot;  In less than two minutes Neal was in the car and Blake was heading to get Wendy&#39;s.  Blake drove silently and let Neal hook up his Iphone so they could listen to their favorite Podcast.  It wasn&#39;t much longer before Blake started to notice the changes he set into the Chronivac.  Neal wouldn&#39;t notice but Blake could see Neal&#39;s  frame seem to stretch slowly but surely.  Once they got their food, they headed back to their apartment and that was when Blake could see the changes finally take over.  <br />
<br />
As he got out of the car, the first change was made to Neal&#39;s height.  With Neal already being taller than him, Blake decided to add some more.  From his original 5&#39;11, Neal shot up to 6&#39;4.  Blake had a thing for tall, thick guys with a big butt, and Neal soon developed those treats.  Blake watched with a grin as Neal&#39;s basket ball shorts began to seem too short for his new long legs.  Though what got Blake really going was the trimming of Neal&#39;s waist and the expanding of this backside.   Neal new ass stretched the 36W basketball shorts with his whooping 44W backside.  Not only that but new muscles began to inflate all over Neal&#39;s form.  The changes where making Blake horny, but he held back until he could see the final product.   <br />
<br />
Neal never noticed any of the changes, even the growth of his nipples or how he became thick bodybuilder type.  The last thing to change and he&#39;d never notice was the mental change in him.  <br />
<br />
Blake went into his room horny as ever but to match Neal&#39;s body he decided to make a few new changes to himself.  Quickly typing away Blake set the changes to complete in the next half hour.  He quickly went into the bathroom to watch his transformation, and no sooner had he gotten into the room, he felt the buzzing and warming sensation wrack his body.  <br />
<br />
One thing Blake noticed was that his transformation was almost to the point it hurt him.  Though thinking about he could understand why.  There was a lot to change and in the short amount of time he&#39;d asked for he figured a little pain maybe there.  His body began to lengthen and muscle bulged.  He no longer a man of short stature, but not overly tall like Blake.  His dream height had been achieved at 5&#39;9.5, but along with his new height he changed his slight overweight body to that of a muscular chub.  While his new weight was mostly muscle, a nice layer of fat coated him making him soft to the touch.<br />
<br />
Blake also gave his and Neal&#39;s sex drive a boost. Though one thing he did do was make it so he knew how to please a guy the same way Neal did.  The last change though was something he knew he&#39;d enjoy the most.  When Neal had sex with someone, the person would bend to Neal&#39;s will without question.  They&#39;d do whatever he asked and wouldn&#39;t complain.  However for Neal though, he wanted nothing more than to top someone as his daddy top him.</p>
