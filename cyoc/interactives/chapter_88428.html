<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Damn it&quot; Jay stood there in front of the mirror cursing. Of all the skills he learned recently he still couldn&#39;t tie a bow tie. He glanced at the clock, he still had plenty of time. With a sigh he looked over at the Tuxedo pants and coat laying over the chair, he would be much happier just to clown around at the wedding but Shannon wanted a &#39;normal&#39; wedding. He couldn&#39;t deny her anything he loved her to much so he got back to work trying to master the bow tie.<br />
&quot;Need help brother?&quot; Jay turned in delight to find Jennifer walking into the room.<br />
&quot;Jen&quot; He swept her up in to a tight hug. They turned their heads meeting in a deep kiss before opening their mouths for a tongue wrestle. They both moaned in delight as they pushed their bodies together and Jennifer slipped her hands down to cup Jay&#39;s tight brief clad buttocks. Jay had been upset when Shannon had informed him of his sister’s conversion but it had done wonders for her. She was now fun loving, doing better at work, popular outside work and dating multiple guys and girls. After a minute they broke the kiss and Jennifer reached up and tied a perfect bow tie for Jay.<br />
&quot;There you go, can&#39;t have you looking sloppy at your wedding.&quot; She paused and looked at him in the eyes seriously. <br />
&quot;I am very happy for you for finding Shannon and bring her into our lives. She has brought more happiness into it than I could have every thought possible.&quot; She kissed him again, her body pressed against his she felt his growing erection.<br />
“Looks like you need some more help.”  She kneeled down in front of him, her skin turning white and nose popping out to a red ball. She pulled down his white briefs and wrapping her lilac lips around his dick and sucking it in. Jango moaned as Jenny ran her tongue over the head as it expanded to a neon green ball the white racing down his dick expanding to his entire body. Jango had to grab the dresser to steady himself. He could tell why she had so many men and women gracing her bed, she had a very talented tongue. She began to go up and down on it increasing her speed slowly, still rubbing her tongue of the underside of his dick and sucking hard on it. He looked down past his green nose to the top of his sister pink hair and marveled again at her skill, he felt himself tensing up and knew he was close. He began to pant, gulping for air as if it was being sucked out of him. His legs began to shake, Jenny sensing his approaching orgasm sped up. Jango gripped the edge of the dresser harder as white spots began to appear before his eyes, his whole body tensed and he felt his orgasm build in his balls before it exploded out to the rest of his body. Groaning he began to shoot his seed into his sisters willing mouth. Jenny felt his dick start to pulse and back off till just the head was in her mouth and felt the warm sweet and salty cum start to shoot on to her tongue. She rolled it around her mouth before swallowing it trying to keep up with the flow. Sucking the last drop out of his dick she felt his knees give way and he collapsed kneeling in front of her. He leaned in and kissed her, his tongue exploring her mouth for any leftover cum, enjoying the taste. <br />
He broke the kiss and stroked her hair. &quot;Thanks, sis. I am happy that you are part of our family.&quot; Jango and Jenny got up off the floor and reverted back to Jay and Jennifer and she helped him finish getting dressed.<br />
&quot;Do you think we are going to have FUN at the wedding?&quot; He looked at her as they got into the car to drive to the church.<br />
&quot;NO. Shannon made it clear to her family after our parents, no more &#39;FUN&#39;.&quot; Jennifer arranged her lips into a cute pout.<br />
&quot;Maybe just a little.&quot;<br />
&quot;NO. You have enough people willing to climb into your bed, you don&#39;t need to have FUN at our wedding too.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ok, for you two. But don&#39;t forget to include me on the honeymoon; I think I have some skills to teach Shannon.&quot; Jay had to agree at that point, still thinking of the great blowjob she gave him. They arrived at the church and Joe, Jay&#39;s best friend since college and now his best man met them at the door.<br />
&quot;You have the rings?&quot; Jay asked<br />
&quot;Yes, yes. Relax man and enjoy the day.&quot; Joe patted him on the back and walked him in the church. Jennifer got out of the car and started to look Joe up and down but stopped with a stern look from Jay. They met up with Bella, Shannon&#39;s maid of honor.<br />
&quot;Shannon all ready, any problems?&quot;<br />
&quot;Relax, we are not clowning around here. HA, ha&quot; Jay rolled his eyes at that lame joke. &quot;Joe meet Bella&quot; Jay said as he introduced the two.<br />
&quot;As beautiful as I imagined.&quot; Joe flattered as he took her hand and kissed it. Bella looked at him like she was ready to throw him down right there and fuck his brains out.<br />
&quot;Behave kids; the best man and the maid of honor don&#39;t have to have sex.&quot; Stated Jay seriously looking to Bella.<br />
&quot;But then what is the advantage of being best man and maid of honor?&quot; Joe complained<br />
Jay met with his parents who were looking more energetic and happy since the parent’s dinner, they both gave him a big kiss and fortunately Joe was still ogling Bella and didn&#39;t notice. Shannon&#39;s parents walked up and greeted him looking more awkward trying to be subdued and &#39;normal&#39;. Finally everyone was seated and line up by the alter, Jay stood up there with Shannon&#39;s brothers and Joe fidgeting, not in nervousness but boredom wishing for a more FUN wedding. From the looks of Shannon&#39;s brother and her bridesmaids they felt the same way as they stare lustfully at each other across the aisle. The music started and Otto started to walk Shannon down the aisle, she looked stunningly beautiful. Again Jay realized how much he loved her and would do anything for her even suffer through this wedding. She arrived at the altar and Otto struggled to give her the appropriately boring father daughter kiss and handed her of to Jay. Jay stood there just looking at her as the rest of the world fell away, the priest droned on about something rather unimportant. Shannon squeezed his hand and he realized that the priest had asked him something and he guessed what it was and said &#39;I do&#39;.<br />
&quot;Shannon do you take Jay to be your husband, to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do us part?&quot;<br />
&quot;I do&quot;<br />
Jay turned to Joe for the rings to which he made a show of searching for them like he lost them. Jay rolled his eyes as laughter echoed in the church. Joe finally came up with them and they exchanged rings.<br />
&quot;I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride.&quot;<br />
Jay quickly embraced Shannon and leaned for a long kiss thankful for his sister’s earlier service so he didn&#39;t pop a boner there. She hugged him tightly and kissed him back before breaking the kiss and looking at him with unfettered lust. Jay got the idea and as quickly as he could walked her down the aisle past the rice and well-wishers and into the limo that would take them to the reception.<br />
&quot;Driver, take the long way please.&quot; Shannon requested as she slid up the privacy divider. The driver smiled knowingly and slowly pulled out. Skeeter quickly stripped off her panties and helped Jango pull down his pants, practically ripping them off. His white dick sprang to attention as she rubbed the neon green head. She straddle him, lining herself up before sinking down on his dick feeling the relief with the pleasure it caused her.<br />
&quot;Thank you, Husband.&quot;<br />
&quot;You’re welcome, Wife.&quot; Their round noses rubbed as they kissed and the limo started to rock.<br />
<br />
Bella slipped into the ladies room and grabbed a stall at the end. She hiked up her ugly bridesmaid dress, wishing more to just take it off and flush it into the toilet. Lowering her pink and yellow stripped panties her had slid down her chalk white thigh to find the pink ball that was her clit and start to massage it. Moaning, she welcomed the much need relief. Skeeter is so weird wanting a normal wedding but she was her best friend and she was willing to do it. Bella dipped a finger into her pussy. She had promised to behave herself at the wedding and reception, even with a bunch of willing people so close by. She moaned louder as she speed up her finger and she heard the door open and she froze. Looking out through the crack in the door past her pink glittering nose she saw Stacey one of the other bridesmaids lean forward exposing her massive cleavage to the mirror and start to freshen up her red lips. Bella&#39;s pussy started to drip as she stared at those lips. Maybe just a little FUN won&#39;t hurt....</p>
