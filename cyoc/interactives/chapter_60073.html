<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>"Uh, Emil...Ms. Plunkett," Kat asked,
"why are you here? Um, if you don't mind
my asking."</p>
<p>Emily tried rather unsuccessfully to
hide a smirk. "I work here because,
as the head of the Midwest United States
chapter of the Order of Hunters, I'm the
most conveniently located to keep an eye
on the field around this town and make
sure it's in good repair, and also because
I like this part of the country." She eyed
Kat closely, and the rabbit-girl squirmed.
"Any convenience in keeping an eye on
certain potentially troublesome young
witches-to-be is merely a happy
coincidence. Does that answer your
question?"</p>
<p>Cringing, Kat nodded. "Good," Emily
said. "Now, your orientation will be in
classroom 108 down towards the far end of
the main hall. Mr. McCann should be there
within fifteen minutes if I can scare him
away from his work, or an hour if I can't.
He'll explain everything you need to know
as students here and show you to your
homerooms. Go on, now!"</p>
<p>The five new students made their way
out of the office, heading warily down the
torch-lit hall to room 108. The hall was
empty; presumably the regular students had
already gone to class. They reached the
room and went in, but there was nobody
inside, so they sat down towards the front
and chatted while they waited for Mr.
McCann.</p>
<p>"So, Colin," Kat said, "how did you
<i>accidentally</i> transform someone?
Didn't your parents teach you about your
magic?"</p>
<p>Danielle scowled; that didn't seem like
a very nice thing to ask, and judging by
the way Colin hung his head, he still felt
pretty awful about it. She wanted to scold
Kat, but she doubted her formerly-older
sister would listen.</p>
<p>"Uh, no," Colin replied. "I, uh...our
mom was an orphan, so she never got taught
about it, and the magic only passes to the
males in our family, so this was the first
we found out about it. We were just
rough-housing and I accidentally unleashed
some magic on Brian..." He trailed
off.</p>
<p>Brianna patted him on the back, trying
to encourage him. "Emily found us because
was still connected through to our old
town for something, and she was able to
tell about which family we belonged to and
that this was permanent. She told our mom
and dad about it and got us moved here."
She looked at Danielle, who found it
comforting that the mouse-girl shared the
same diminished size as her and Kat. "So,"
she said, "what's it like being a girl?
I've been wondering ever since this
happened."</p>
<p>Danielle didn't quite grasp the
question for a moment, then gaped. "I,
uh...um, well...I don't know." She
swallowed nervously. "Uh, see, I wasn't a
girl until just a couple days ago,
either."</p>
<p>She looked anxiously at Colin, but he
looked more confused and surprised than
put off or grossed out. For some reason,
she found this very relieving. Brianna
smiled, incredulous. "Really?" She
smirked, staring pointedly at Kat. "So
<i>that</i> was why Emily was in the
neighborhood."</p>
<p>Now it was Kat's turn to look
uncomfortable, and Danielle found herself
feeling a little defensive of her sister.
"It wasn't all Kat's fault," she said.
"There were some things that complicated
it that I still don't get. I got turned
into this and Kat became my twin sister,
and then Tanya had her own separate
change. And Emily and my mom said there's
some complicated thing that means we might
be stuck like this for years..." She
sighed.</p>
<p>Brianna's expression changed to
sympathy, and she put a hand on Danielle's
shoulder. "Aww, don't worry," she said.
"We can help each other figure this out,
okay? If we're stuck as girls, at least we
don't have to face it alone."</p>
<p>Danielle didn't really think she
<i>wanted</i> help in getting used to
being a girl, but she was touched by the
gesture, at least. "Thanks," she
smiled.</p>
<p>Just then the door burst open, and a
rather rather disheveled-looking man ran
in. He looked to be in his early 50s, and
as far as Danielle could tell, he was an
ordinary human. "Sorry, sorry," he said.
"I get so wrapped up in my work sometimes,
and I just lose track of time. I just wish
there were a better wake-up call than Ms.
Plunkett's threats; they can be so
harrowing...um. Anyway. Welcome to Pine
Lake School, we're very glad to have you
here. I'm Mr. McCann, and I'm here to tell
you about how we do things around
here."</p>
<p>He took his place behind the desk,
straightening out his shirt, and looked
them over. "Quite a crew we have here," he
said. "Okay. First things first: we take
attendance pretty seriously around here. I
notice we have a carnivore in our group,
so I'll just say that you're allowed to go
out hunting during lunch, but you must
remain on school grounds at all other
times unless you have written permission
or are accompanied by a teacher. Oh, and,
uh, please make sure that you're cleaned
up before you go back to class; we don't
want the other teachers to assume you've
burst an artery or something."</p>
<p>Tanya nodded, and he smiled. "Okay,
second: please respect the dress code.
It's okay to add a personal touch or two
to your uniform, but some of the teachers
don't take well to students trying to test
the limits. Third: please exercise
self-control. We don't think non-human
students should repress their instincts,
but remember that your classmates are
trying to study, and it's not polite to
provide unnecessary distractions."</p>
<p>Danielle frowned. Non-human instincts?
Was that another thing she was going to
have to deal with? She hoped not. What
would they even be, anyway?</p>
<p>Mr. McCann continued the orientation
for some time, and even though he seemed
just un-serious to make it not boring, the
new students found themselves wondering
when they'd get to whatever was
next...</p></p>
