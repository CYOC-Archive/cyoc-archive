<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Now remember, girls.” The headmistress was saying, standing in front of a group of what appeared to be teenage girls, “You must always be elegant and composed. Your job is not only to look good, but to behave in a manner that brings credit upon you, your family, and this institution.” She continued to stride back and forth across the front of the classroom, occasionally gesturing at an image on the large television screen in the front of the room. <br />
<br />
Kevin paid careful attention. All the guys did. They remembered what the punishments were for not doing so…..<br />
<br />
Five Months Earlier<br />
<br />
Kevin sprawled back lazily in the chair, legs spread as wide as he could in the tight skirt they were making him wear. He couldn’t believe this place. Okay, yeah, they’d made him look like a girl—he still wasn’t quite sure how. One second he’d been sitting there, glaring at the headmistress across a table in the interview room, and next thing he knew he was waking up in a nightgown. Looking down and suddenly seeing he had a large pair of boobs was one hell of a shock. At least they were fake; he didn’t think this place could do anything as major as giving him actual tits, but he wasn’t going to risk it.<br />
<br />
Still though, if they thought they could turn him into a polite, well behaved girly girl, they had another thing coming. He’d terrorized the neighborhood with his friends back home. Their pranks were the stuff of legend. So what if one of them had ended in just a bit of an explosion? Nobody had gotten hurt, and besides, it was their own fault for leaving something that volatile out where anyone could mess with it. <br />
<br />
That had been the last straw for his parents though. They’d sent him here. A place most people just seemed to refer to as “The School.” Apparently it had a reputation for turning even the most reckless boy’s life around. Kevin had protested vigorously, but his parents had put their feet down. He was going, period. <br />
<br />
“Katherine?” <br />
<br />
Kevin gave a start as he realized the instructor had been calling the girl’s name they given him for a while now. She was looking rather annoyed. “Can you answer the question?” Kevin had no idea what the question was, and frankly he didn’t much care. “No idea, could care less.” He sneered. He was already here, forced to pretend to be a girl—what more could they do to him? The small group of guys around him(not that they looked anything like guys) broke out in laughter. If Kevin had been paying attention he would, however, noticed the way the “girls” who’d been there longer paled….or the way the instructor got a devious look in her eyes.<br />
<br />
That night Kevin was getting ready for bed. “Dude, you sure showed her.” His roommate Ian laughed. Ian, going as “Ivy”, had been the first other “student”  Kevin had met here and they’d quickly found they had plenty of the same interests—though they had to be quiet about it. Talking about sports that wasn’t just commenting on how good looking the players were, or vapid questions on rules they already knew, got punished. <br />
<br />
Kevin was about to reply, but suddenly found himself feelingly tired. Very, very tired. He opened his mouth to reply…..and passed out with a thud. <br />
<br />
When he came to he realized he was in an entirely different room….and dressed VERY differently. Instead of wearing the nightgown he had to wear to bed, he was wearing a wedding dress! Kevin couldn’t believe his eyes. He had to admit….he looked beautiful. Was that really him? He had to get out of this—<br />
<br />
As he started to try and figure out how to take off the dress, the door to the room he was in opened, and there stood the instructor he had talked back to. “Why, don’t you look pretty, Katherine. The very picture of a blushing bride on her wedding day.” She said with a smirk. Two of the orderlies who worked at the school entered the room, and the instructor said “please take Katherine here to the Chapel. Her husband to be is waiting.”<br />
<br />
HUSBAND? <br />
<br />
Kevin tried to struggle, but quickly found the dress pretty much made that useless. The orderlies picked him up and marched him out of the room, down a series of hallways, and finally into a room which had been made up to look like a wedding chapel. Ian and the two other guys around him who’d been laughing earlier were standing there, dressed in light pink bridesmaid gowns. They looked as stunned as he did. <br />
<br />
What Kevin was really paying attention to, though, was the group of teenage boys standing there. One of them—a stocky Asian boy—was clearly supposed to be the “groom”. He wondered whether they knew what was actually happening. Even for this crazy place, this was nuts! <br />
<br />
The “ceremony” went by in a haze for Kevin. His mind just couldn’t comprehend what was happening. “—-and you may kiss the bride.” The instructor said suddenly, and Kevin was jolted back to reality. The other guy’s arms were around him, and they were kissing, and— <br />
<br />
“How does it feel to be a married woman, Katherine?” The instructor asked after the guys had—thank god, Kevin thought—trooped back off to wherever they had come from. Kevin and his “bridesmaids” still stood in the chapel room, listening to the instructor lecture them. “Next time you refuse to pay attention in class—worse, when you disrespect an instructor— you and your little group of friends—Ivy, Molly, Gabriela—“ she nodded to each of the “bridesmaids” in turn— get to play out another scenario like this. Learn your lessons, on the other hand, and soon you’ll be back to whoever you used to be before you walked in our doors. Is that understood?” She said. <br />
<br />
The “boys” nodded.  What else could they do?<br />
<br />
Back To Present<br />
<br />
Even now, all those months later, Katherine still got chills thinking about it. But now it was the big formal dance, the chance to prove she’d learned her lessons well and could move into the final phase before she got out of here. She couldn’t wait.</p>
