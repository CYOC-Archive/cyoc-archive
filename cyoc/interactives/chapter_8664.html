<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty’s Power – Two Times Ty – by scriptboy<br />
<br />
Ty ran down the stairs into the kitchen, walking right by Dustin, who was in the recliner, watching TV. Then Ty grabbed the garbage bag, which was filled up, and went to take it out through the back door.<br />
<br />
Moments later, Ty came down the stairs again, but he went out through the front door. He was doing his chores, and Dustin glanced out the window and noticed that Ty was turning on the sprinkler so he could water the front lawn.<br />
<br />
Barely a minute had gone by, and Ty walked back through the kitchen door and ran up the stairs to the room. Suddenly it dawned on him, that Ty was watering the front lawn, so how could he be upstairs in his room? He then figured he must have missed Ty coming back in through the front door.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the front door opened, and Ty walked in, wiping his wet feet on the mat by the entrance. He closed the door and ran up the stairs. But Dustin got confused, and began to get the feeling that something wasn’t right. He got up and he quietly walked up the stairs.<br />
<br />
Ty stood in his room, when another Ty walked in. “Did you see the look on his face?” Both Ty’s chuckled, as they managed to confuse their foster brother. “Wow, this is great! It’s like looking in the mirror!” one of them said. “Yeah, Dustin thinks I’m you!” the other Ty responded. Then they both laughed together, with the same voice and the same laugh!<br />
<br />
Then the bedroom door swung open, and Dustin jumped in the room, shouting “AHHAH!” out loud! Both Ty’s were shocked, as they looked at him. “AAAARGGH!!!” Dustin shouted, when he realized he was seeing double!! <br />
<br />
“Oh no… Ty… There are TWO of you?” Dustin said, as he began to turn pale as a ghost!<br />
<br />
“Wait a minute!” he then shouted, “One of you is Peter!”<br />
<br />
Both Ty’s looked at each other, and then pointed their finger at the other Ty. “That’s Peter!” they both said, and then they pointed at themselves, saying “I am Ty!”<br />
<br />
Dustin stood in front of both Ty’s and concentrated. He still had Peter’s powers, and he was able to sense who Peter was, and who the real Ty was. “You’re Peter!” he said, pointing at the Ty on the right, “And you’re the real Ty!” he said, while pointing to the one on the left. The real Ty looked up and rolled his eyes, “I knew it! You shouldn’t have given him your powers! He’ll use your own powers to figure out who you really are!”<br />
<br />
“Well, I’ll have my powers back by this time tomorrow, so don’t worry, okay?” Peter said, while still looking like Ty. “Let me change Peter back, because I’m getting really confused here, and ONE Ty in this house is enough!” Dustin said, as he concentrated.<br />
<br />
Ty started to grow a little taller, he became more muscular, and the blond hair began to turn light brown. The green eyes turned blue, as the short, curly hair became flat and spiked in the front. In just a few moments, the copy of Ty turned back into Cousin Peter!<br />
<br />
Peter turned towards Ty. “Hey, that was fun! We need to do that again some time, okay?” he said. Ty just nodded, as he could tell that Dustin did not want them to do that at all!<br />
<br />
Dustin walked back down the stairs, as Peter and Ty went into their own rooms to do their homework.<br />
<br />
The following morning Ty and Peter got up early to go to school. Peter tried his hardest to act as normal as possible, since he did not have his powers. But he had already gotten a reputation at the school since he handled a couple of bullies on his first day, and nobody bothered with him ever since.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, Dustin was home, studying for a class for the new job he was trying to get. He used his powers to get books, and to hold them open. He made himself stretchy so he could make coffee while he was in the living room, and he used his powers to make lunch. He decided not to get too used to having them, since he would lose them that night anyway!<br />
<br />
When Peter and Ty came home from school, Dustin called Peter and willed him to come to him while he was in his recliner. When Peter stood in front of him, he figured he’d have some fun one more time, before the powers were gone.<br />
<br />
“I need you to get all the branches and leaves off of our roof!” he said to Peter. Peter didn’t mind it, since he lived there for free. So he got the old wooden ladder out of the shed, and climbed on the roof. He was rather scared; the ladder was very old and unstable! While he slowly climbed up the ladder, holding a broom in his right hand, he felt the ladder move every time he stepped up one step higher. <br />
<br />
When he got on the sixth step, wood cracked, the step broke, the ladder broke in two, and Peter tumbled down, landing on his back in the grass of the front lawn. He couldn’t fix it himself, so he walked back in the house.<br />
<br />
“Hey Dustin, the ladder broke!” he said, as Dustin was reading the paper. Then Dustin looked up and smiled at Peter. “How tall was the ladder?” he asked Peter. “It was about ten feet tall!” Peter replied. “Well then,” Dustin said, “You won’t need the ladder!”<br />
<br />
Peter felt another jolt through his body, like he had a mild electrical shock. Then he realized that his legs were growing and becoming longer, as his torso began to rise further and further away from the ground. “I’d better go outside!” he said, as he barely made it out the door. Suddenly he realized that he had grown about ten feet tall, and was now able to reach the roof without the ladder! He grabbed the broom and swept all the branches and leaves off the roof, just as Dustin had asked him.<br />
<br />
When he was done, he put the broom back and walked up to the front door of the house, where he noted one problem: He was too tall to walk through the door! So he opened the door and stuck his head through the opening. “Hey Dustin, could you help me out? Shrink me back to normal so I can get back in!”<br />
<br />
Dustin nodded and he began to grow shorter and shorter, until he was back to being about six feet tall again. Peter walked in the house and ran up the stairs. He looked at the clock and realized that it was almost time for him to get his transformation powers back! He couldn’t wait, although he felt happy that he was able to share them with Dustin. It seemed that Dustin trusted him more, and their friendship had grown as the seventy-two hours were almost up. <br />
<br />
Peter looked through his class notes and verified that he had nothing left to do for school, as he went through his backpack and organized his papers and his books for the following school day. Then he ran back down the stairs, where Ty and Dustin were watching TV. <br />
<br />
As soon as Peter came down, he thought he heard voices. “I’m nervous about my exam” he heard Dustin say. Then he heard Ty say “I want to go to bed soon.” Suddenly it dawned on him that they had not said anything at all!<br />
<br />
“Did you guys say anything?” Peter wondered out loud. Both Ty and Dustin said no. “But Dustin, you said you were nervous about the exam!” Peter asked him. “Well, I didn’t SAY that…” Then it dawned on Peter that he had his powers back! “They’re back! I hear your thoughts! I got my powers back!” Peter shouted excitedly!<br />
<br />
Dustin wanted to get some coffee, but he realized that his powers were gone! “Well, I guess things are back to normal!” he said, as Ty breathed a sigh of relief! “Thank goodness Peter has his powers again!”<br />
<br />
“And NOW… It’s MY TURN to have some FUN!” Peter shouted, as he stood up in front of Ty and Dustin. Peter made a fist with his right hand and slammed it into the palm of his left hand. Suddenly, lightning struck, followed by thunder! It became dark everywhere, and there was a violent wind. The lights in the housed flashed on and off, as Peter drew all his power from within him. <br />
<br />
“Why couldn’t I do that when I had his power?” Dustin asked Ty. “You could, but you just didn’t know HOW! Peter has more experience than we do!” Ty whispered.<br />
<br />
“Alright, Dustin, are you ready?” Peter said out loud, suddenly showing an evil grin on his face.<br />
<br />
Dustin turned pale! He knew how he used Peter’s own powers on Peter during the passed three days. “Peter, please don’t do anything! I never meant to hurt you! Honest! Don’t be mad at me! Please!!” Dustin began to plead, as Peter unleashed his great power and a violent wind hit the house!<br />
<br />
The chandelier rocked, the walls shook, the ground moved and the windows rattled. Flashes of lightning struck around the house, as the mighty teenager felt his power reaching back to his full potential inside of him. Then Peter walked closer to Dustin, who began to tremble with fear.<br />
<br />
“Come on Peter! I didn’t do anything! Please! I’m sorry!!” he shouted, as he got up and walked back, he was scared to death of Peter now!<br />
<br />
“And now, Dustin, the moment we have been waiting for!” Peter shouted, as he raised his arms up in the air. <br />
<br />
“All I can say now is… HAPPY BIRTHDAY DUSTIN!!!!” Peter shouted, as the sky erupted in fireworks, visible through the big glass window behind him!<br />
<br />
Dustin and Ty were relieved, as Peter had a big smile on his face! Dustin was in awe of the incredible display of fireworks, as Ty gave Peter the thumbs up signal, for pulling off the greatest birthday surprise ever!<br />
<br />
As fireworks were exploding outside, the doorbell rang, and all the neighbors came over for the party. A disc jockey came and set up the stereo, and everyone brought drinks and snacks. All their friends from school showed up, as they all celebrated Dustin’s seventeenth birthday!</p>
