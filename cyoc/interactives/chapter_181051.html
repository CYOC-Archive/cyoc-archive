<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cain stepped out of the bathroom to see his friends gathered around Nick. &quot;See that&#39;s what I ordered. Okay? I had no idea he was going to get smelly gym clothes.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And you just ordered it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-huh,&quot; Nick answered. &quot;They screwed up my order last time, but at least that one didn&#39;t really matter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trent smacked him in the back of the head. &quot;And you thought it&#39;d be alright to order from them again?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Why not?!&quot; Nick tried to defend himself. &quot;That package came in less than 30 minutes. Who has better service than that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You could have--&quot; Trent stopped himself as he sniffed the air. His nose twisted for a second and eyes squinted. He turned around to see Cain standing there. &quot;Hey there birthday boy! Nick here was just apologizing for the mess he made. Cause damn. I think it&#39;s starting to stink up your whole place.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Really? I don&#39;t really smell it anymore,&quot; Cain lied.<br />
<br />
&quot;See?&quot; Nick chimed in. <br />
<br />
Trent threw him a nasty glare, but tried to save face. &quot;So what does the birthday boy want to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I saw Nick brought in some Rum. How about some shots?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;S-shots?!&quot; Trent was surprised. Cain wasn&#39;t one to really drink alcohol, let alone offer to have it. &quot;S-sure,&quot; he answered.<br />
<br />
Nick hit Trent in the chest with the back of his hand. &quot;See?&quot; his grin was so smug, Trent wanted to punch it off his face. Nick poured three shots. &quot;Cheers,&quot; he held it up and the three guys toasted to the night. <br />
<br />
Cain downed it. It burned a bit. He shook his head. &quot;Another.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Another?!&quot; the two said in unison. But Nick was quick with a refill. His competitive nature was driving him to give Cain the better birthday party. <br />
<br />
&quot;Woah,&quot; Cain said. His head shook as he felt the alcohol go into his system. It was some strong stuff. &quot;Damn that&#39;s good.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-huh,&quot; Nick poured another shot into each of their glasses. <br />
<br />
Cain downed it again. &quot;H-hey,&quot; Trent said. But the shot was already gone and back on the table. &quot;Don&#39;t you think you should pace yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon! It&#39;s a party!&quot; Nick filled the shot again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. A party,&quot; Cain chimed in. He looked down at the full shot again. &quot;You&#39;re not going to let me outpace you are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OOOOOOO!&quot; Nick cheered. <br />
<br />
Trent felt his blood boil. He wasn&#39;t sure if it was just his competitive nature, or if it was because he was being called out by someone like Cain. But he quickly downed his second. &quot;Don&#39;t plan to.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;There you go big guy!&quot; Cain smiled. There was almost a cockiness to it. His usually passive demeanor usually made him hide his smile a bit, but this one was full out in the open. But then there was the nickname too. Trent was the tallest out of the three. At 6&#39; he stood a couple of inches taller than Nick but nearly a head taller than Cain. However, right now, it felt like that height difference was a little less. What was even weirder was watching Cain pull at his shirt around his neck. He normally wore something that was a bit too big on him, yet right now it looked uncomfortable on him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Another,&quot; Trent tilted his head. Nick quickly filled it for him, and he just as quickly took it. <br />
<br />
Cain cheered. His fists clenched in excitement and his biceps flexed. They strained against the sleeves of his shirt. The normally completely undefined biceps were now rounded out with a divot separating them from his triceps. &quot;Same,&quot; Cain said. Confidence seemed to flow through him. He was speaking with a bit more authority now. And he showed it off by downing the shot without a second thought. It wasn&#39;t even burning like it had been before. Instead, he let out a long satisfied, &quot;Ahhh...&quot;<br />
<br />
Trent took another shot. He was still one behind, but he was wondering if Cain or Nick were actually counting. &quot;Getting nervous?&quot; he taunted back. A bead of sweat ran down the side of Cain&#39;s cheek. No one seemed to notice that his face was becoming more masculine. The round boyish looks he&#39;d always been cursed with were stiffing into strong cut angles. His eyes narrowed into a piercing stare. While his lips pulled tightly together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely not,&quot; Cain smirked. &quot;Just really hot in here.&quot; He pulled at his shirt again. This time hearing a loud rip. Each time he moved, the rip continued down his back. The other guys paused for a second. &quot;Sorry, let me just take this off.&quot; Cain gripped the shirt he was wearing and tore it completely off of him. His massive hands easily gripped the fabric and tore it apart.<br />
<br />
He leaned forward on the counter. His massive muscular butt pointed out behind him causing another rip. The other guys laughed. &quot;Dude. What the fuck? Can&#39;t wear clothes your own size?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When Nick goes and steals &#39;em, no,&quot; Cain laughed. His big pecs bounced behind his XL sleeveless shirt. He went and flexed his legs. The jeans didn&#39;t stand a chance against his massive quads. They were already bound so tightly, that the fabric looked painted on. But with that firm flex, it was enough to tear the seams apart. Cain undid the button of his jeans and what remained of them fell around his feet. He hadn&#39;t even noticed that his toes were currently free. At some point his feet had started out growing his shoes. The tight confines couldn&#39;t hold the size any more and they had freed themselves by completely tearing apart his shoes. <br />
<br />
Cain walked around to the other side of the counter and laid his muscular arm over Nick&#39;s shoulder. &quot;If I&#39;d known you were going to take my dirty gym sweats I wouldn&#39;t have gotten them so dirty.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trent stared as he watched his friend. Something about him seemed so different but he couldn&#39;t quite place it. At 6&#39;4&quot; and 240 pounds, he was built like a brick house. His near 20 inch arms were his pride and joy and those thick quads and perfect calves only completed the picture. Yet something seemed off. Trent blamed it on the alcohol.  &quot;Another?&quot; he pushed his shot forward.<br />
<br />
Nick turned to the bottle. &quot;Empty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Cain said. &quot;What about that website you were talking about? How about we order something from them?&quot;</p>
