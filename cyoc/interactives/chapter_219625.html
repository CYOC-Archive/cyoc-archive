<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Nah, I think I&#39;ll stay home. I don’t feel well.” At this point he just wanted to leave before things got any weirder. &quot;Okay then. If you need anything, you know who to call. Mom said if you wanna stay home you have to get someone to bring you the homework, though. I know it’s weird, like so much has changed but I’m sure they’ll understand, I mean everyone’s been asking about you, especially your teammates.” She winked. &quot;Well, thanks Lisa. See you later,&quot; he muttered, closing the door. He never felt so ashamed of himself. How did everyone know about his sex organs, according to his sister, it’s apparently all anyone can talk about. ‘Bother’ didn’t even begin to describe it. And worse, they seemed to be glad about it! At first he thought maybe some kind of rumor had gotten out, but no. No, it seems like everyone knew, including his parents and little sister. Damn, he had no idea things would get this bad. How am I supposed to handle this? And why the hell did she make it sound like all the boys seem to like it? This whole thing is fucking crazy! And why the hell are his teammates talking about it? Couldn’t they just keep it in their pants?! As he sat down on his bed, Jeff noticed the tingles coming from his clit again. Of course! Just because he’d lost the ability to get an erection didn’t mean his body was just going to stop responding. He closed his eyes, breathing deeply as he began to stroke himself. He ran his fingers over his sensitive spot, pressing down gently while lightly exploring his new cavity with a finger.<br />
<br />
Just as his mind was wandering back to the sexy trans man Drew, his phone buzzed on his nightstand. His first instinct was to ignore it, and perhaps save it until after he finished masturbating. He glanced over to see a missed call and text from his mom. Shit. He rolled his eyes and reluctantly picked up the phone. “Sweetie we all are supportive of your choices, and it’s important that you heal, but you can’t fall behind at school. Text Lucas and ask him to bring you the homework, his mom told me he’s been missing you at practice.” After a few seconds of staring at the phone, feeling guilty for ignoring her call, Jeff answered with a simple “okay mom.” <br />
<br />
Lucas was a good looking guy. He may have actually been the reason Jeff questioned his straight-ness. Big, at least 200 lbs of muscle, fast and easy; probably the reasons he was so popular. His blonde hair and golden tan certainly didn’t make him any uglier. But he wasn’t the smartest either. At a party a couple months ago piss drunk Lucas had asked Jeff if he could kiss him, since he figured kissing girls wasn&#39;t really all that different from guys kissing each other. It didn’t turn into anything more than a one time thing, but it definitely left a lasting impression. The moment Jeff laid eyes on Lucas he’d wanted nothing more than to grab his shoulders, pull him close and passionately kiss him. Not that he ever acted on those thoughts, Lucas was the only man he ever thought of like that, but thinking about him doing such a thing brought pleasure to Jeff’s already engorged parts. The memory of Lucas playing football during their senior year, in just his tight fitting jersey,  made Jeff drool slightly. To add insult to injury, there was no denying that Lucas was packing some serious dick under that baggy uniform. Jeff was sure it must be twice the size his own, well back when he had his own. What a sick and twisted way to have a crush, huh?<br />
<br />
Jeff opened Lucas messages and asked him to come over to his house as soon as possible. As much as he hated to do it, Jeff knew his mom was right, and it wouldn’t hurt to clear the air and find out what the world knew about his situation. <br />
<br />
Despite his discomfort with the idea of seeing Lucas again, he couldn’t deny the relief he felt when he heard the doorbell ring ten minutes later. “You’re here early? What about class?” Jeff tried not to show his nervousness, but it was pretty obvious. Still, he tried to act cool, though he couldn’t help staring at the massive bulge that threatened to burst out of Lucas’ sweatpants. He cleared his throat nervously before addressing Lucas, who gave him a friendly smile and waved his hand in dismissal.<br />
<br />
“I called my mom and she said she’d let me skip today if I came over and helped out my friend,” Lucas shrugged casually. As Jeff stood in front of the massive hunk of flesh wrapped around in tight spandex, the words came spilling out of his mouth without conscious thought. “Uh…can I give you a hand with something?” Lucas smiled even wider and stepped closer. As he stood within arm’s reach, Jeff was suddenly aware of how sweaty he was. What the fuck? Had he just come onto this guy or something? The sheer thought of it sent shivers down Jeff’s spine. As Lucas’ face drew closer, Jeff gulped and wondered if he should just stand up and leave. <br />
<br />
“Errrr…. Can I come in?” Without waiting for an answer, Lucas brushed past him and went upstairs towards Jeff’s room. “You comin?” Shit. It occurred to Jeff that none of his post-op stuff was cleaned up. Dilators still on his bed next to the manual on post sexual reassignment surgery aftercare, and Lucas was about to walk right in to see it all. <br />
<br />
“Umm….” Jeff started and looked around desperately for some way to hide the equipment. Before he could even think of anything to say, he heard Lucas’ soft chuckle from inside his room. “Hey dude, don’t worry. Been keeping up with your dilation?” Jeff was stunned. “I know how much you talked about this I mean if anyone’s committed, it’s you.” Jeff gulped and nodded, too embarrassed to speak. Lucas went on, “Come on man, we both got shit to do, no need to make it awkward. Just come in and get this done.” Jeff turned towards his closet, which had been recently reorganized, and grabbed a pair of shorts and a shirt. “Okay dude. Be right back.” He changed out of his pajamas. The pair of shorts he chose were tighter than he remembered, he was definitely gonna show through. Lucas did already know about the sex change though so what was really the worst that could happen.<br />
<br />
Lucas laughed softly as Jeff approached the bedroom. Despite his appearance Lucas didn’t look any older than his 19 years. If anything he looked younger. He smiled and asked, “What are you wearing?” Jeff blushed and stammered for a minute before mumbling “Shorts.” There was no use hiding it now, his lips were almost bursting out of the fabric. He ran his hands down his legs, attempting to squeeze them together. Lucas laughed louder.<br />
<br />
“Yeah dude, that’s not going to work. Maybe we can pick something else to wear later?” As he spoke he stepped closer and ran his hands along Jeff’s hips and waist. Jeff jumped but didn’t pull away. “You know I really didn’t understand at first why any guy would do this to themselves. But now, I gotta admit it makes sense. You feel fucking great.” Jeff was almost frozen by Lucas’ unexpected compliments, and that combined with his desire made his heart race.<br />
<br />
It was all too much for Jeff, he didn’t even really understand what was going on and didn’t know what to think about his involuntary reassignment. “…what homework do we have?” Lucas smirked knowingly. He was already pushing things too far. And this wasn’t supposed to be about school. But there was no reason not to indulge himself. He reached behind Jeff and slipped one finger under the elastic of his shorts. “Homework is cool. Or we can start on some other stuff. Or we can just take our time and get comfortable. I kinda wanna play,” he whispered into Jeff’s ear.<br />
<br />
Jeff was flustered and barely managed to stutter, “Okay, um…I guess we can do whatever. Whatever feels good.” Lucas ran his hands along Jeff’s ass cheeks and leaned forward. His lips pressed against the edge of Jeff’s ear, causing him to jump again. Lucas moaned slightly, rubbing his erection against Jeff’s hip. “Dude, hey, it’s still practically an open wound. You gotta take this slow.” With that said Lucas slowly backed off. They sat there in silence for a moment before Lucas spoke again. “Sorry, man. This really isn’t what I meant to do. I just want to make sure you feel okay. Like you can trust me. God, remember they day before you had the operation? At practice that night? When I told you about…how you should go through with it?” Jeff paused for a second and shook his head. He tried to bring back those memories but couldn’t. Lucas continued, “I mean I was so caught off guard when you asked me… well… I had a good night.” He smirked. “Kinda sad the little guy’s gone now, but…” he let his sentence trail off. Then he leaned forward and gave Jeff a peck on the cheek. “So how does today feel different?” Jeff couldn’t answer. What was he supposed to say? That he liked the feeling of being enveloped by Lucas’ presence? That his body felt completely different after getting the procedure done? Lucas cocked his head, confused. He leaned over and kissed Jeff on the mouth. Jeff froze. This was different. It was so unexpected, and Jeff didn’t even know what he was doing. But then again, maybe he was just excited. Lucas pulled back and grinned. “You okay, bro?” He sounded concerned. “Um, yeah, yeah, fine. Just…kinda shocked, that’s all.” Jeff wasn’t ready to get into the real reasons. It had all changed so fast. “I’m not… gay, Lucas.” He blurted out, surprising both himself and Lucas. He took a deep breath and forced a smile. “I mean…that’s not who I am. Not really. It’s just…new, I guess. When you kissed me back at that party, I swore you were straight, and I really thought I was too. Now everything’s changed. And this too?” Jeff gestured at his groin “How am I supposed to know if I’m…” His voice trailed off as he searched for words.<br />
<br />
Lucas leaned in and wrapped his arms around Jeff, hugging him tightly. “That’s just…complicated. No one knows where their feelings come from. If anything happens between us it’ll just be because we both want it to happen.” He paused for a moment, stroking Jeff’s hair gently. “The team misses you. We’ve been killing it without you. Even though my number one concern was always you. I don’t know how you did it. I mean we all took it weird when you told us you didn’t want your dick. I guess it just takes time to realize that you don’t need to understand to be okay with something. Or someone.” The two fell silent, thinking about what had happened. Jeff turned his head towards Lucas, his eyes begging him to continue. Jeff may not have wanted this but Lucas sure made him feel better. “Look,” Jeff finally broke the quiet. “Can I just show you?” he looked up at Lucas with pleading eyes. “I’d really like that.” Lucas responded immediately. “Sure. Sure you can.”<br />
<br />
Jeff stood up and quickly slid off his shorts. Lucas was speechless. He was more masculine than ever before, and yet at the same time somehow softer. Seeing Jeff standing there totally naked had him taken aback. His wide muscles, dusted with short blonde hair seemed somehow bigger next to his new vagina. Speaking of, his 6 inch hairy dick was gone, there was no denying it. The outline through his shorts Lucas had seen earlier was now fully revealed. “I wish you could see yourself, dude. I swear, you’re perfect.” Jeff’s stitches we’re dissolving by now, but his pussy was still definitely swollen, it would take a few weeks for that to go down, Jeff had read.  Lucas leaned forward and ran his fingers along the swollen labia. “It feels nice. Do you mind if I touch it?” With the way his hormones were acting right now, Jeff seemed almost an entirely different person. It felt strange to be attracted to another guy in such a passionate way.  As Lucas held the clit in his hand, Jeff groaned softly. “Does it hurt?” Jeff smiled, resting his arms on Lucas’ shoulders. “No. But it does feel weird to stand here in front of you and not feel ashamed or embarrassed.” Lucas rested his hands on top of Jeff’s hips and looked him in the eye. “You shouldn’t be ashamed or embarrassed, Bro. You’re gorgeous, and the only thing you’re missing is confidence. You are more beautiful than any woman I’ve ever met. Trust me, and look at yourself. You’re fucking sexy. I bet if anyone else saw you like this they wouldn’t be able to keep their eyes off you.” Jeff was so aroused at this point that he couldn’t help but let out a soft moan. “Do you think they’d wanna touch me?” Lucas smiled seductively and gave a gentle tug on Jeff’s hips. “Yeah, probably. You’re a big boy now, remember? There’s nothing you can’t do, except….do you want to do something with me, Bro?” Jeff blushed and dropped his gaze. For a second he wasn’t sure what Lucas meant, then it clicked. Jeff raised his face and stared deeply into Lucas’ eyes. “Of course I do!” “Okay. Then why don’t we find somewhere more comfortable.”<br />
<br />
Without hesitation Lucas walked over and grabbed Jeff’s hand, walking him towards the shower. Luckily no one was home. They washed each other’s backs under the spray of water, trying to keep their distance as much as possible. The moment seemed surreal. It felt like any other day that Lucas would just walk up behind Jeff and touch him somewhere on his back or shoulder. Only today it was happening under new circumstances. And Jeff  could feel Lucas’ heartbeat thumping against his chest as they stood there washing each other. Finally Lucas reached over and  gently rubbed the head of his cock against Jeff’s leg. “Love me softly, Lucas?” Jeff asked timidly. Lucas bent down and was now face to face with his teammates pussy. His cum and pussylips smelled musky, very similar to penis but much stronger. “Your pussy is amazing.” He licked his lips as he breathed in Jeff’s scent. Jeff sighed softly and moved closer, the tip Lucas’ nose now touching Jeff’s entrance. Lucas kissed him softly on the lips. “Open up for me, buddy.” Slowly Jeff parted his legs. Lucas stroked himself gently between them. “Oh my god, Lucas. You taste amazing. Your pussy smells incredible.” He closed his eyes and took deep breaths. “Mmmmmm.” Lucas was almost jealous of Jeff in that moment. The scent of a guy made his blood boil in a way it never had with a girl. To know that Jeff was getting off to him in such a powerful way was beyond exciting. Lucas leaned down and pushed his tongue into his teammate. He winced slightly, but Jeff was loving every second of it. He moaned loudly as Lucas began tonguing his hole, bringing his head back and forth. It felt incredible, even better than he imagined. “Lucas, please!” He bit his lip hard, trying to stifle his moans. This was too good to last. “Tell me what you need, bro.” With a loud grunt, Lucas pushed his whole tongue inside Jeff. He started moving it back and forth slowly, thrusting it deeper with every stroke. The smell of his own arousal was overwhelming. He slid his finger underneath Jeff and rubbed around his ass. He pumped harder, faster and deeper into his teammate, moaning louder. Jeff began breathing heavily, matching Lucas stroke for stroke. After a few minutes Jeff was shaking with pleasure. The sensations running through his body were unlike anything he’d ever experienced before. Jeff blew his massive load right out of his new urethra onto Lucas’ face.  At first Lucas didn’t realize what had happened, until the warmth hit his lips. He swallowed it all, savoring the sweet taste of another man’s cum on his tongue. “That probably had the very last sperm you’ll ever make in it”  Lucas laughed, jacking his cock and smiling.<br />
<br />
The shower stopped. The two got out and dried each other off. Maybe the magic stone did him a favor after all.</p>
