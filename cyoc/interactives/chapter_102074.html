<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tim wide receiver on the football team, the leader of singling out people was hit the hardest of all just as Ryan had intended. Tim stood up feeling something was amiss as his posture changed and he stood up. It proved a mistake as his now shortening leg proved an impediment indeed as he lost balance. Failing to regain his footing he fell sticking out his hands to break his fall. He was startled as he saw what they had become but it was too late to reconsider his actions as his small hands collided with the soil beneath him. A stinging pain travelled up his arm and rung in back he winced. On the ground he rolled around holding his sprained thumbs and scratched fingers having trouble to keep his tears in. Cindy looked down on the scene at first she was troubled. &quot;Are you okay?&quot; She said at a tone as air-headed sounding as she was.  Then she saw his hands. &quot;What the? What&#39;s wrong with your hands?&quot; she blurted out barely illegibly from behind the hands she had put on her mouth.  Ben walked up and leaned past Cindy but not before taking a good eye in of her body up close. &quot;Tim, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; Tim tried to keep his hands from sight he groaned while doing his arms and hands still stinging a lot and his fingers were swelling up already. &quot;Nothing, leave me alone... okay?&quot; Tim grunted low on breath.  <br />
<br />
Cindy as bubbly as ever blurted out absent-mindedly  &quot;but your hands looked really small, you sure nothing is wrong?&quot; Tim turned around growling  with open mouth as though he was a wild animal contemplating his prey. &quot;You... &quot; Cindy  stumbled back. &quot;Eh, I think I need to run, bye...&quot; she stuttered.  Ben scratched his head. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; He suddenly pulled back his hand which felt surprisingly hairy. He almost jumped. &quot;What the fuck?&quot; In his hand clump of hair, his hair. &quot;My hair, shit... &quot; Ben ran of towards the nearest mirror to check the damage. Mitch however was already on the way to the bathroom. His crotch felt weird very weird. as he got to the toilet he lowered his pants and glanced as his dick. 5 inches soft seemed normal for him, he was sort of proud of it to some extent but then he noted his balls looked weird. He grabbed them and almost lost his footing colliding with the stall door. &quot;What the... this ain&#39;t right, how?&quot; He was quite concerned but then decided it wasn&#39;t worth getting upset over right away. What he didn&#39;t know that he had another surprise waiting in the evening. <br />
<br />
Ben stood before the mirror and sighed in relief. Though he had pulled out quite a bit of hair he hadn&#39;t gotten an obvious bald spot from it just yet. He was standing in front of a full body mirror and glanced at himself. Still good looking or at least so he believed. He noticed his shirt bulging a little around the waist and looked around he then lifted his skirt and grabbed his stomach. To his displeasure he noted a bulging love-handles were he never had them before. &quot;Fuck, I need to watch my snacking, shit.&quot; He uttered to himself and quickly lowered his shirt. Ben muttered reassurances to himself as he walked off back to Tim, Ben wouldn&#39;t admit it but his newly gained concerns had been a hit to his pride as small as they were he was now frigthened of getting fat and bald. <br />
<br />
Tim in the meanwhile was pulling himself up and staggered forward. &quot;What the fuck is wrong with my left leg?&quot; He kept cursing as he hobbled forward on his uneven legs. By the time he reached the schools entrance portal his left knee hurt from the awkward motion and his right hip was burning as well. Ben came up to Tim. &quot;Dude, what the fuck.&quot; Tim threw an angry but desperate look at him. &quot;Help me.&quot; He grumbled. Ben reached for his hand and then was startled once more. &quot;What is going on with your fucking hands?&quot; Tim looked ready to punch him. &quot;Hell, if I know!&quot;  The two of them reached the nurses office. The nurses there couldn&#39;t explain Tim&#39;s changes either of course. In a desperate act they called Tim&#39;s parents. Tim was eventually taken home by his very surprised parent&#39;s while in shambles. Mitch however would only discover his true curse that evening...</p>
