<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So let's go find the manufacturer,&quot; Danielle said.<br />
<br />
Her mother sighed and said, &quot;It won't be easy. You see since reality has changed it <br />
means Kat never bought this stone and so couldn't have the name of the shop written <br />
down. I'm surprised this stone is still here as it should have went somewhere else the <br />
moment Kat dropped it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean...&quot; Danielle began with a look of horror on her face.<br />
<br />
Her mother nodded and said, &quot;We shouldn't even have the opportunity to track the <br />
manufacturer down.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't see what the big deal is,&quot; Kat said shrugging her shoulders. &quot;I can find the shop <br />
again. I know what it looks like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh really,&quot; her mother said with a scowl, &quot;then perhaps you can describe it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Kat said smiling. &quot;It's... err... I know that it has a... err... It's on... err... Oh <br />
why can't I remember now?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you never went to that shop Kat,&quot; her mother practically spit. &quot;I told you that <br />
you needed to go slow and learn the basics first. But noooo you had to try some <br />
advanced magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you can locate the manufacturer by scrying for them,&quot; Kat said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn't pay much attention to how the stone is made did you Kat?&quot; her mother said <br />
sighing angrily. When Kat shook her head she continued, &quot;Enchanter's reserves always <br />
have an anti-scrying jinx and anti-focusing jinx on them to prevent someone from using <br />
the stone to find them by scrying or using the stone as a focusing object to cast spells <br />
on them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can still find them though can't you?&quot; Danielle asked scared that she would <br />
remain this way for the rest of her life.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't,&quot; her mother said shaking her head. &quot;Even if it wasn't so low on energy I would <br />
have to go around looking for the right magical signature which could take years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Years?&quot; Kat and Danielle asked together. &quot;I can't wait that long to get my magic <br />
back,&quot; Kat continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;And why is that?&quot; her mother asked in a dangerous tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well because I'm supposed to have it,&quot; Kat said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's all you care about?!&quot; her mother exploded her face turning red. &quot;You don't even <br />
care about your once brother now sister and that she may be stuck like this! You don't <br />
deserve to have magic! After this is fixed I'll be transforming you into a boy so you'll <br />
never be a witch again!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I didn't mean for all this to happen,&quot; Kat said starting to cry. Her mother made a <br />
small gesture while Kat continued, &quot;Dan and I never got along. I thought that if I <br />
transformed him into Danielle that we would get along better. I only made her a bunny <br />
girl as a little prank. I meant to change her back into a human but then she had to <br />
tattle and you wouldn't give me the chance to explain. I was so mad that I was thirteen <br />
again and didn't have my magic. I blamed Danielle for it and wanted to punish her for <br />
tattling. I never meant for things to go this far.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Kat,&quot; her mother said softly and kneeling down hugged her. &quot;Why didn't you tell <br />
me this before? We could have worked it out before this even started. And I'm sorry <br />
that I didn't give you the chance to explain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom?&quot; Danielle asked confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;She's telling the truth,&quot; her mother said. &quot;I cast a truth detection spell when she <br />
started crying. It wouldn't prevent her from lying but I would know if she was.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So that's how you knew we were lying when we did before,&quot; Danielle said looking <br />
down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes and now that you know that I will be able to tell if you're lying I expect you to tell <br />
me the truth,&quot; her mother said. &quot;Now we need to find the manufacturer and see if <br />
they're skilled enough to undo this. Fortunately I know someone who may be able to <br />
help.&quot; She took out a wand and muttered something. A wisp of blue smoke came out <br />
of the tip and quickly dissipated.<br />
<br />
After a few moments a door appeared and opened revealing an eighteen year old girl. <br />
The girl smiled and walked into the room letting the door fade away. &quot;Nice to see you <br />
again Jill but your message sounded urgent,&quot; the girl said as she hugged Jill.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Rick,&quot; Jill began but then stopped. Sighing she asked, &quot;What name are you going <br />
by now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I chose Emily this time,&quot; the girl said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Emily Kat used an enchanter's stone to try and change Danielle after she had <br />
already changed her,&quot; Jill said sighing.<br />
<br />
Emily shook her head and said, &quot;Mixing magics like that. I would almost say she was <br />
your niece instead of your daughter if I didn't know better. I guess you need me to try <br />
and find the manufacturer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jill nodded but before she or Emily could say anything else Danielle asked, &quot;Mom, who <br />
is this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I should introduce you since you were only a baby the last time she stopped by,&quot; <br />
Jill said. &quot;Emily these are my daughters Kat and Danielle. Girls this is Emily. She's a <br />
hunter and one of the oldest witches alive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's a hunter?&quot; Danielle asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;How old are you?&quot; Kat asked nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Danielle I'm a witch hunter,&quot; Emily said smiling. &quot;I hunt down witches who have <br />
abused their powers and either imprison them or kill them if I'm forced too. Fortunately <br />
I haven't had to kill a witch in three hundred years. As to your question Kat I knew <br />
Circe before she started turning men into pigs.&quot; She must have seen the fearful look <br />
on Kat's face because she said, &quot;Yes Kat I'm too old for a novice witch to change my <br />
memories. I know Danielle was born Daniel and so will the council if I decide to tell <br />
them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-y-you won't tell th-th-them w-w-will you?&quot; Kat asked shaking in fright.<br />
<br />
&quot;That depends on what I find out here and what happens,&quot; Emily said frowning at Kat. <br />
She turned to Jill and said, &quot;I'll need the enchanter's reserve.&quot; She held out her left <br />
hand and Jill placed the stone in it. After looking at it for a few seconds her eyes went <br />
wide. She closed her hand around it and waved her other hand making a door appear <br />
again. &quot;Come with me quickly,&quot; she said as she opened the door and stepped through.<br />
<br />
Kat and Danielle looked at each other with confused looks but their mother said, <br />
&quot;Come along girls. I don't know what's going on but Emily's waiting for us.&quot; Indeed <br />
Emily was waiting just on the other side of the door looking impatient and probably <br />
getting angry. Danielle decided she didn't want Emily mad at her and followed her <br />
mother through the door. Kat must have been thinking the same thing because she <br />
was right behind Danielle.<br />
<br />
They were in some sort of weird dungeon or something like that. There walls were <br />
stone and torches were set at regular intervals along them though these torches didn't <br />
give off any smoke even though they were lit. There were cells along the walls and part <br />
of a silver circle engraved with mysterious symbols in front of them. One cell had what <br />
looked like a dome of pink light over it though the pink light could barely be seen. <br />
Emily walked over to a block of stone against one wall that had several silver circles <br />
with those symbols engraved into them on it. Some of these circles had that same <br />
barely seen pink light dome over them and objects in them. There were a couple dolls, <br />
a small wooden horse, a small jade elephant, and a fairy statue. Emily placed the <br />
stone in one of the empty circles and then touched the circle. When she did the barely <br />
visible pink light rose from the circle and formed a dome over it in the blink of an eye. <br />
&quot;Well she won't die now and I can finally tell the council I found her,&quot; she said sighing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you say that stone was a she?&quot; Danielle asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because this isn't an enchanter's reserve,&quot; Emily said gesturing to the stone. &quot;It's <br />
actually a witch I've been hunting since you were born. Her name is Tanya <br />
Moonstone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean she has been that stone for sixteen years?&quot; Jill asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Possibly,&quot; Emily said with a smile. &quot;Though I suspect it's been less than that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you say that she wouldn't die now?&quot; Kat asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because if you're transformed into an inanimate object your life force will eventually <br />
start to fade if not in a circle,&quot; Emily said. &quot;If you're a witch who's been transformed <br />
into an inanimate object and someone taps into your magic then the process speeds <br />
up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How close is she?&quot; Jill asked worry in her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if I remove her from the circle it's likely that she'll die in minutes,&quot; Emily said. <br />
&quot;The good news is that it seems she transformed herself so I should be able to <br />
transform her back. I just need to construct the proper circle in which to do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about my daughters?&quot; Jill asked putting a hand on their shoulders. &quot;Do you <br />
think you can change them back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll need to know the exact spells used and then I'd need to study them for a bit,&quot; <br />
Emily said rubbing her chin and looking at Kat and Danielle. &quot;You know how delicate it <br />
can be to undo another's spells.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Jill said looking sad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that you Julian?&quot; a woman asked from the occupied cell. &quot;Why haven't you brought <br />
your children to see their Aunt Mary before now little brother?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that our aunt?&quot; Danielle asked looking at the woman in the cell. She did look like <br />
her mother except older. &quot;And why did she call you little brother?&quot;</p>
