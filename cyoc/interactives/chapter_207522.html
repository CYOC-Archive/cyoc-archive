<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Laura sighed, all four of her hands were full trying to contain the copious amounts of sexual fluids leaking from her body. At home it was easy to let loose, and let her exposed breasts drip and spray milk while her dick drooled precum all over her floors. But in class she was at least expected to have some small semblance of self control over her outrageous body.<br />
<br />
It was torture to be lectured on the fall of the roman empire while being taught by someone that was more breast than body. No matter which way Ms. Mounds was facing, you’d always be seeing tit. <br />
<br />
Her history teacher was a daily fantasy of hers, always fantasizing about plowing her gargantuan breasts and painting every inch of her bust in Laura’s hot thick cum. Laura groaned internally, her four hands working overtime to hold back her obvious arousal. It wasn’t fair, Laura’s tits always blew up with milk the more aroused she got. She often wondered what Ms. Mounds would look like if she had the same problem.<br />
<br />
“It would be great if her tits filled up with milk like mine” She sighed dreamily, the upper pair of Laura&#39;s hands now completely drenched from the deluge of fresh breast milk pouring from her large nipples. Uselessly trying to hold back a flow of milk that naturally leaked like broken faucets even when she wasn’t aroused. She was glad that the floors in all her classes were fitted with flood drains, especially since attending Ms.Mounds class would be flooded to knee height before the second half of the lecture was over.<br />
<br />
Laura used her lower arms to keep her dick under control, staring at her history teacher.<br />
<br />
She was now completely immobile, as she always was for the most part during class. The rest of her lecture was now done on a powerpoint, using a laptop perched in between her cleavage. Of course the obvious reason for this being the giant pumps attached to her nipples as she was milked aggressively and vigorously during class. Ms. Mounds needed to be perpetually drained if she was to even have a chance at fitting through doorways, and hallways. The school had been permitted to have industrial sized milking machines installed in her classroom, as well as commission a portable one on a dolly and cart system that could be set up to get her from place to place. <br />
<br />
Of course this didn’t help Laura, and her lactation fetish. She was a fantasy made flesh, Ms. Mounds breasts took up the entire front of the class. You had to literally squeeze past them to even get to your seat. Even with the heavy machines constantly pumping milk from her truck sized tits, there was still too much that would spill out from occasion from the glass suction tubes attached to her torpedo sized nipples. Laura imagined the taste of her person sized areola was divine. <br />
<br />
Regardless of her disability, Ms. Mounds droned onwards about facts of the Roman Empire, and its fall from grace. How could Laura be expected to learn in this environment, when you got the queen of tits sitting in front of you. <br />
<br />
The entire class was already ankle deep in Ms. Mounds milk, and Laura herself grew harder at the prospect of her own miniscule flow of breast milk mingling with her. <br />
<br />
Thankfully, she was able to hide her arousal. At least from her teacher, as it was impossible for her to see past her own cleavage. She used a camera to keep an eye on her class, connected to her laptop. But it was situated above the desks, letting Laura’s lower arms continue and caress her aching and throbbing erection. <br />
<br />
She grew frustrated at the state of her pants, soggy and ruined thanks to her dick spewing precum in copious amounts. <br />
<br />
“Ugh, I wish I didn&#39;t even have to wear pants” She mumbled under her breath. Not hearing the beeping of her remote going off. <br />
<br />
Laura panted slightly, tugging at her open and free cock wantonly. She at least had the privacy of the desk to keep her decent, as her constant and permanent erection and the sensitivity of her cock had legally been declared a disability. Allowing her to go bottomless in public without any recourse. Walking down the street or through the halls with her dripping always erect cock, a foot out in front of her was a normal occurrence, just like Ms. Mounds boulder sized, waterfall leaking breasts. <br />
<br />
“Goddamit Laura, again?!” The girl in front of her yelled, not noticing that some of her pre-cum had coated the backside of the girls skirt. “Cant you fucking control that fucking thing?” She yelled, standing up and interrupting the class. Ms.Mounds stopped her lecture, trying futilely to see over the swell of her own breasts.<br />
<br />
“What&#39;s going on over there?” She called. Having to switch to her classroom webcam to get a better look. <br />
<br />
Laura blushed heavily, she knew she was caught. But it was hard to keep all of her hands to herself especially when you got a hardon 24/7. <br />
<br />
“Ugh, it’s all over my ass” The girl complained. Her comment making Laura zero in on her ass, she was average to her tastes. But ever since Laura had gotten a taste of Ms. Mounds colossal tits, everything else was ruined for her. She wanted bigger, and better for everyone. Even if it was all just fantasy. Laura stumbled to try and save herself from further embarrassment.<br />
<br />
“Hey, uhh…I mean, I couldn&#39;t help it Sharon. You have such a nice ass” The remote beeped.<br />
<br />
“I mean, yeah. I fucking know I do, I dont need your dick telling me how great my ass is” The afformentioned Sharon replied. Not even paying attention to the subtle swell and enhanced curvature of her newer, lager and much “nicer” ass. And thanks to her statement, Laura really couldn&#39;t help it. Sharon had a great ass, but it was such a shame it was so small…</p>
