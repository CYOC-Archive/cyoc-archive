<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I did it! I didn&#39;t think it would happen so soon, but I did it! The Wish Granting App is mine!&quot; Gage shouted as he pumped his fist in the air. &quot;Ga... Gage... Let&#39;s be reasonable here...&quot; &quot;Oh, what&#39;s this?! Is the great &#39;Gage Matthews&#39; pleading with the nerd &#39;Connor Watkins?&#39; Is this actually what&#39;s happening?!&quot; &quot;Listen... Gage... I&#39;m... I&#39;m sorry. I let this whole thing get to my head... I&#39;ll let you get your body back, so... let&#39;s put this whole little ordeal behind us okay?&quot; Connor was clearly distressed as he pleaded with Gage to calm down. &quot;Oh you don&#39;t get to fucking call the shots here now. You made me suffer like you&#39;d never believe! No way in hell am I letting you get away with this!&quot; &quot;Gage... Gage please!&quot; Connor begged with tears in his eyes. &quot;Oh god. I have so many things planned for you. I can&#39;t wait to try them out right here and now!&quot; &quot;Sniff... Sniff... No...&quot; Connor gently wept, but Gage couldn&#39;t care less. &quot;But first things first... All right, Wish Granting App! I wish... Gage Matthews had Connor Watkins body and Connor Watkins had Gage Matthews body in return... of course!&quot; <br />
<br />
Several seconds passed, but nothing was happening. &quot;Huh? What&#39;s wrong? I wish... Me and Gage Matthews could switch bodies!&quot; Nothing happened. &quot;Um... I wish all the changes you made were no more!&quot; Again, nothing happened. &quot;What... What&#39;s going on?&quot; &quot;Sniff... Sniff... Heh... Heh,ha.. Ah,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha! Oh my god!&quot; Connor had been crying, but suddenly he burst into laughter. He walked about the Gage and grabbed him by the balls. &quot;Agh!&quot; Gage lost control of the phone, but Connor grabbed it before it hit the floor. &quot;Damn, you really are fucking stupid! Did you think I would let you take the phone from me so easily?! Oh you must have been raised by monkeys! I wish Connor Waktins would piss himself!&quot; And just like that Gage started to pee onto the floor. &quot;What... What&#39;s going on here?!&quot; &quot;Well you see... The App only reacts to the voice of the one who owns it.&quot; &quot;W... What?!&quot; &quot;And as you can see, the app is on the phone of Gage Matthews now. Not Connor Watkins. So that means... Heh,ha! You can&#39;t do jack shit!&quot; &quot;Ah... Ah...&quot; With that, Gage realized he had made a huge mistake. &quot;AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!&quot; He ran. He didn&#39;t care he was naked, Gage Matthews ran for his life. As he ran through the halls, no one seemed to notice him, but he didn&#39;t seem to realize. He got to the roof. &quot;Pant... Pant... I... I can&#39;t! I can&#39;t let this continue!&quot; He moved towards the end of the roof... &quot;You hear me Connor! I won&#39;t let you ruin me any further!&quot; And with those words, Gage jumped. He closed his eyes and prepared for the impact... But his feet just laid gently on the floor... of the roof. &quot;Huh?! What?!&quot; Gage was confused, but he jumped again; this time with eyes opened. What he saw, was the floor of the roof, his feet planted on the ground. &quot;Huh?! What?!&quot; Gage just stood there dumbfounded. He laid down... and then smashed his head to the pavement. But it simply bounced of his head. &quot;No... No way...&quot; &quot;So you finally realized did ya?&quot; <br />
<br />
Gage turned his head towards the voice and there stood Connor with a smile on his face. He was fully clothed again as he walked towards Gage. &quot;You see... I knew you&#39;d try this when you learned the truth of the app, so last night I wished... that Connor Watkins could kill himself.&quot; No...&quot; &quot;Yes! Oh, and also I just wished people couldn&#39;t see you running naked. You&#39;re welcome!&quot; &quot;Connor... Please...&quot; &quot;Now what are we going to do about this act of insubordination?!&quot; The bell rang singling the start of the school day. &quot;And now we&#39;re late. Oh, we have to do something about this. I wish only Gage Matthews and Connor Watkins can be on the roof now!&quot; Naturally nothing happened. &quot;And next, let&#39;s see... I wish... hmm... well let&#39;s start with this... I wish I had complete control over Connor Watkins body!&quot; Gage could feel his body become lighter as it levitated above the air. Connor moved his fingers and Gage straitened up in the air, his arms and legs flapping around. &quot;No. No. No. No. No. No. No. NO! Please don&#39;t! Connor!&quot; Connor flicked his wrist and Gage flipped upside down. His face positioned itself in front of Connor&#39;s. He grabbed Gage by the nose, wriggled him around and slapped him. &quot;Now, now. Turn that frown upside down.&quot; Connor took his hands and moved Gage&#39;s face into a smile. &quot;Mgh! Mmf!&quot; &quot;That&#39;s better!&quot; Connor flicked his wrist to the side and Gage lay face up in the air. Connor moved his finger up and down and Gage&#39;s dick went erect and flaccid in kind. &quot;Ah... ah... ah!&quot; &quot;Now cum!&quot; Gage&#39;s dick went erect again and immediately ejaculated, the wayward cum splashed all over his body. &quot;Now converge into his mouth!&quot; &quot;Ah! No! Blegh!&quot; Gage couldn&#39;t resist as he swallowed his cum. It tasted incredibly salty. <br />
<br />
&quot;Connor, please! No more!&quot; &quot;What? That was just a test. The real fun begins now.&quot; &quot;Ah... Ah...&quot; Connor moved his fingers and did the nose pull and slap again. &quot;Hey! Hey Gage! Stay with me! Now I want you to tell me the truth. What were you going to do to me if the app actually worked for you?&quot; &quot;No... No... Anything but that!&quot; &quot;Oh, it must have been bad. You can resist if you want, but I have ways of making you talk. Oh, Wish Granting App! I wish Connor Watkins could only tell me the truth! Now Gage, I&#39;ll ask again. What were you going to do with me?&quot; &quot;Ah... Noth... Notblegh.... I.... I wanted... no.... I wanted you to.... Connor... shit yourself.... please... and... and... eat....it....&quot; &quot;Ah-hah! Ah,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha! Holy crap! That&#39;s messed up! Gage Matthews! You have one sick mind....! I like it!&quot; &quot;Connor...&quot; Gage knew he could stop him, but he continued to plead anyway. &quot;Let&#39;s get this party started! I wish Connor Watkins would shit himself. Gage lost control of his bowels again and shat into the air. Connor controlled it in the air and smashed it into a paste with his hand movements. &quot;Connor...&quot; &quot;Jeez, is that all you can say! You need to regain that shitty mouth of yours!&quot; Connor motioned his fingers to open Gage&#39;s mouth. &quot;Ahh... Ahh...&quot; Tears fell down Gage&#39;s face as he prepared himself for what was to come. &quot;And in... it... goes!&quot; Connor made another motion and the shit paste flew into Gage&#39;s mouth. &quot;Mm...Mm... Mm...&quot; Naturally, it tasted awful. After a few seconds, all the poop was gone. &quot;Blegh!&quot; Immediately Gage threw up. &quot;Blegh... gagh!&quot; &quot;Well that&#39;s only natural. I wish Connor Watkins body was unaffected by his shit eating.&quot; The unpleasant feeling was gone just as fast as it came. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now Gage! What else did you want to do with me?&quot; &quot;Please... kill me...&quot; &quot;Come on. Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re done already? Or what? Was that all you wanted to do?&quot; &quot;I... yes...&quot; &quot;Really?! Wow! Not only are you stupid! You&#39;re unimaginative too!&quot; &quot;No more... Please...&quot; &quot;Now no need to rush. We still have the rest of the school day.&quot; Gage&#39;s heart sank as he heard that. &quot;No more... Please...&quot; All he could do was repeat those words. &quot;Now let us continue. For now you can dance for me monkey boy!&quot; Connor waved both his hands like a concert maestro as Gage&#39;s body made various sloppy movements. They could hardly be called a dance. Occasionally, his body would flip all over the place and vomit all over the floor. Of course Connor added periodic instant shit, piss and cum for Gage to eject out from his body, though nothing every went back inside his mouth again. This went on for the rest of the day. Like he wished, no one came up to the roof to help him. Connor left to get some lunch at one point, leaving Gage tied to a flag post naked. Luckily no one could see him, though he dared not pee or poop into the floor below. Even, when Connor came back, he didn&#39;t provide Gage with food. Eventually the final bell rang, singling the end of the school day. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, is the school day over already?! And I was just starting to have fun too!&quot; &quot;Hah... Hah-hah! Hah-hah!&quot; Gage did nothing but laugh intermittently. &quot;Wow! You broke down completely! You shame the marines... or some shit! Well no matter... I wish Connor Watkins was sane again!&quot; &quot;Ah.... hahhh..... AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!&quot; Suddenly Gage let out a beastly scream as what had happened just came back to his sane mind. &quot;Jesus Christ...! Clearly that was a bad idea! I wish Connor Watkins was sane and would stay sane for the rest of his life!&quot; Gage stopped his yelling and simply panted heavily. He still remembered what had happened, but he could no longer retreat into insanity. &quot;There! All better!&quot; Connor clapped his hands and Gage stood back up on the concrete floor. &quot;I wish Connor Watkins could control his own body again!&quot; And just like that Gage could move by himself again. He fell to his knees immediately. &quot;Here&#39;s your clothes! Put them on and I&#39;ll see you tomorrow, okay?&quot; &quot;...Yes sir...&quot; Gage nodded slightly and Connor left the roof.<br />
<br />
Gage knelled there for several minutes. &quot;This must be Hell...&quot; And with that he put on his clothes and walked home. He got home and opened the door. &quot;Oh you&#39;re back bro... Hey... You okay?&quot; Gage stared at his body. Evidentially, he didn&#39;t look so hot. &quot;I&#39;m fine...&quot; was all he said as he went upstairs. &quot;Even his little brother&#39;s body is mocking me.&quot; Gage thought as he went into his room. He lay done on the bed and cried. Several minutes later, he had calmed himself down. &quot;So this is my life now... God... What did I do to deserve this? I never was this bad right? Was I? No, I wasn&#39;t. No... Maybe I was...Did I go too far? Did someone want to kill himself because of me? No... Did someone KILL themselves because of me? I don&#39;t know... I don&#39;t know... anything... I deserve this then... Yep! I deserve this! I can&#39;t die, can&#39;t run away... Can&#39;t even lock my mind away. So... I better make the best out of this...&quot; Gage whipped out his dick and thought about chicks as he jerked himself off of his own free will. &quot;Guess I&#39;ll play video game after this!&quot;</p>
