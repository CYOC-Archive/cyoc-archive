<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"> Dionysus sighed; the newly arrived demon, one of the four from Lamashtu’s harem was busy giving him oral satisfaction. Her ministrations to his capraesque shaft was divine; it was clear to him that Lamashtu either trained this one well, or she learned quickly how to put someone on the cusp of orgasm and keep them there.<br />
The angelic satyr with rams horn and a halo was surprised when an impressive sight sauntered into his court. He couldn’t help but grin as Nocticula arrived.  The inky black skinned demoness with four silvery white wings and long silvery white hair was a sight to behold. Sashaying forward as he grunted; Dionysus kept the demon latched onto his rod as she gagged upon his release.<br />
“The stars align tonight,” Dionysus clapping his hands; summoning aides to offer wine and refreshments to his latest guest.<br />
“Thank you my child,” Dionysus nodding to the demon that just finished getting him off; “but I believe I will not be bedding you tonight.”<br />
<br />
Nocticula smirked as the female demon pouted; obvisously she was promised a night of passion and her arrival just kyboshed such carnal delights.<br />
“Dionysus,” Nocticula bowing; the tiny dots of lights on her body twinkling with every movement; “it has been too long.”<br />
“Not long enough,” Dionysus smiling; his erection clearly not abating, despite his blow job. “To what do I owe this delightful pleasure?”<br />
“I was going to ask if you knew what was going on in hell,” Nocticula sighing; “but your front entrance acting as a refugee camp, explains things.”<br />
“I maybe a sex addict,” the angelic satyr responding as he accepts the honeyed wine from a servant; “but I’m not a cruel demon. Despite Kusheil’s continued accusations. I still have my halo and I never sided with your father’s revolt. And I could never turn down those in need. My court has always been neutral ground.” Dionysus down his wine in one gulp; “I take it your visit here is business related?”<br />
“I didn’t come here for a dalliance,” Nocticula smiling; “but I won’t deny that the night is young, and I have longed for you.”<br />
“The night truly is young,” Dionysus grin getting wider; “and I to have longed for you.”<br />
<br />
********************************************************<br />
<br />
In a modestly sized chamber within Dionysus&#39;s traveling palace sat Loki; using his mate Svadilfari, a demon centaur as a pillow as he too was lounging on a bed of pillows. Both Loki’s sister Jahi and her husband Ahriman, a male demon with the head of a snake and the lower body of a scorpion were present. Both he a Svadilfari took up a fair chunk of floor space, their respective spouses didn’t mind; both Loki and Jahi felt safe with their partners&#39; loving embrace.<br />
“I’m sorry Jahi,” Loki being the first to break the silence; “I couldn’t stop them.”<br />
“Don’t beat yourself up,” Ahriman hugging his wife as she sighed; the blanket the she was offered was a small comfort but it was more than enough for the moment.<br />
“You don’t understand,” Loki shuddering; “I saw things in that cave. Terrible things;” like Jahi, Loki’s memories were still fuzzy. He saw everything that the chaos entity that possessed him; but it at times felt like a living nightmare.<br />
“By the darkness,” Loki crying; “I saw them mutilate you Jahi. I saw them rip your child from your womb,” Loki blubbering; “you were going to have a son. He looked like Ahriman,” Loki unable to stop tearing up; despite Svadilfari’s comforting embraces. “I saw him take its first breath before Qesem butchered him over that awful alter,” Loki looking at his sister; “he was a taur like your husband.”<br />
“That would explain why the doctor thought you were having twins,” Ahriman choking up; even he was having a hard time dealing with this bit of tragedy; “all those kicks were from one baby.”<br />
<br />
“And our child,” Svadilfri dreading what Loki had to go through; “was it a boy or a…”<br />
“Girl,” Loki blubbering; “Hel and Fenrir would have had a baby sister to protect.”<br />
“Brother,” Jahi offering a comforting hand; “let’s not dwell on what happened. Enoch’s miracle gave us a second chance; I for one am not going to squander it.” Jahi looking at her husband, “when this is civil war is done Ahriman; you and I are going to try again.”<br />
“No rush Jahi,” Ahriman nodding; “there is no rush.”<br />
<br />
“Svadilfri,” Loki still in tears; but slightly calmer after getting all that sadness out of his system. “Will you be the barer and let me be the sire? I can’t bear to carry another child right now.”<br />
“I enjoyed it when Hel and Fenrir grew in me,” Svadilfri smiling; “so if you want to take a break I’ll be more than happy to make our family bigger.&quot;<br />
“Thank you my love,” Loki smiling for the first time since he was free from enslavement.<br />
<br />
****************************************<br />
<br />
The passion was intense and fierce. Nocticula knew she was being lead to Dionysus’s bed chamber as they talked; she knew this was a risk, but she didn’t care. A part of her always found the rutting angel attractive; despite the incident that took place involving Enoch.<br />
‘For the children,’ she thought.<br />
When she was led to the sunken bed and was made to lie down, all she could think; ‘it’s for the children.’<br />
When Dionysus climbed on top and gently parted her legs; exposing the black hole that was her feminine entrance, she whispered “for the children.”<br />
<br />
“It’s more than just that,” Dionysus grinned; “this is for all the times you played hard to get.”<br />
“Then get it over with you randy beast,” Nocticula drunk on Dionysus’s heady wine and musk; “claim me.”<br />
“I already have,” he whispers seductively; “my starry night love, I already have.”<br />
<br />
Nocticula gasped as she felt her folds parted by the capraesque penis invading her. Murmuring as Dionysus pulled out, only to thrust back in. Pushing deeper as he took his time; savoring each spasm her body gave off as he paused to place a gentle kiss on her slightly pouting lips. Nocticula whimpers as Dionysus begins to pick up speed; pushing deeper in her, determined to fully explore her entrance. She was lost in a haze of bliss as every thrust gave her a mini orgasm; building up to the inevitable crescendo.<br />
<br />
She could feel it coming; instinctively wrapping her legs around his skinny frame; Nocticula wanted to make sure Dionysus wasn’t going to pull out. Not that he was planning to begin with; he came to far and wasn’t planning to turn back. His thrusts getting faster and more forceful; it was soon apparent the he was purposely holding back, a skill he perfected over the centuries to make the rut last as long as possible.<br />
<br />
“Marry me Nocticula,” Dionysus uttering with each trust he made; “become. my. wife.”<br />
“Oooooooooooooooooooh,” Nocticula gasping as she could feel the dam begging to burst; “but our agreement. The children’s safety.”<br />
“I. could. never. say. no. to. you,” Dionysus still thrusting in her slick tunnel; “I. always. loved. you. from the moment. I. laid. eyes. on you.”<br />
“But I’m. an Archduchess,” Nocticula squirming; panting as she was yearning for release.<br />
“Titles. mean. nothing. to me,” Dionysus speaking between each thrust. Twitching as he was about to burst; “only love. does! Marry me!”<br />
“Oh yes,” Nocticula screaming; “YES. YES! YES I’ll. marry you!”<br />
“Oh happy joy,” Dionysus shouting as he came. His load blowing through and filling up Nocticula as she screamed; her body shuddering, the lights on her skin sparkling brightly as she felt the mother of all orgasms rail her senseless.<br />
<br />
It was a few minutes later that the two eventually came down from their respective orgasms. Despite Dionysus’s rough way, there was always gentleness to his touch. Even as he tried to disentangle himself from the demon below him, he took care not to pull out. Using an acrobatic move that would take a lifetime to achieve; Dionysus managed to spoon Nocticula all the while he was still pumping his seed in her. Placing his hands on her belly as she still rode her afterglow; he placed tender kisses on her neck and shoulders.<br />
“We should have done this centuries ago my starry love,” Dionysus breaking the silence; “why did it take a civil war for you to come to me?”<br />
“I don’t know,” Nocticula sighing; “I don’t know. But it was well worth the wait,” Nocticula placing her hands above Dionysus. “So will you help look after the children?”<br />
“Of course,” Dionysus kissing Nocticula again; “I never could say no to you; your my starry night.”</p>
