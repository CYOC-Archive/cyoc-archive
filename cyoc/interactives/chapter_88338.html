<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hunter stood there quietly, his eyes looking down his muzzle and up to his Aunt. He was genuinely concerned about the prospect of his girlfriend finding out about what he was. Now, on some level, to gain the enhanced musculature that he had gained was cool, but at the same time he knew that not everyone would just see it that way. Most movies didn&#39;t depict werewolves as anything other than monstrous beasts with little to no intelligence. The only time when they didn&#39;t, they were used more as a joke. As he had looked at himself and his brother, his parents, his aunt and uncle, and his grandparents, none of them fit into the later category and they really didn&#39;t fit into the former category either. They were all completely covered in fur, like if an artist had combined what a wolf and a human would look like if mixed together. They were all packed with a great deal of extra muscle, even his grandma and grandpa, and as his mouth opened and closed, he could hear his changed teeth click as they hit each other. And what teeth they were... Hunter knew that all of them had the teeth to crush the bones of even cattle, and their claws looked like the perfect weapons as well.  However, perfect weapons didn&#39;t mean not scary. <br />
<br />
The was an obviously sexual element to it too. Given what Nate had said about how he bit Jeanie, the fact that outside of their fur no one was wearing any clothing at the moment. There was the fact that he became aroused as his own transformation neared its end, and he found that he could smell that May had grown aroused when the end of her transformation approached. They weren&#39;t lost to it, obviously, but still, Hunter got the sense something in the &quot;curse&quot; made it somewhat sexual as well as powerful. And despite what most people thought about teenage boys, that part was actually the part that gave Hunter the most concern.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s where you will need to do your best to make sure she doesn&#39;t find out about what you are,&quot; Jeanie spoke, &quot;and you don&#39;t necessarily have to lie to do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re sure?&quot; Hunter asked nervously.<br />
<br />
His aunt nodded and then patted his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, you don&#39;t necessarily need to lie... though you will need to be careful,&quot; Jeanie told him, her voice being soft and reassuring.<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if she finds out?&quot; Hunter asked, &quot;No matter what I do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you show her that you are still you,&quot; Jeanie gave a soft sigh, &quot;show her that your appearance in your wolf form won&#39;t change who you are on the inside. And if she truly loves you, she&#39;ll realize that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Though you&#39;ll still want to be careful, grandson,&quot; Margaret told him, &quot;You don&#39;t want to know what your father went through with some of the adventures he had with regard to dating before he met your mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hunter and Mikey both turned to their grandmother, to watch their mother lower one ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;And just what adventures were these?&quot; May wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Girlfriends he had before he met you,&quot; Margaret answered with a shrug, &quot;he got his hopes up that they would be like you and they let him down... and it did cause trouble sometimes...&quot;<br />
<br />
Hunter was just as confused as his mother was with the answer, but supposed that there was a lesson to be learned in there to be careful. And he privately decided he&#39;d do his best to be careful. Alice Harrison was a nice girl, and they got along well, but given that they were both Sophomores in High School and had only been dating for a couple of weeks, it was doubtful that he could be certain that she wouldn&#39;t run away in terror of him now. Shoot, he remembered being terrified as he watched his own claws grow out from his fingertips, and if the transformation hadn&#39;t hurt as much as it did, he might have run off, afraid he&#39;d hurt someone or someone might hurt him. It was only after he&#39;d fully transformed that he realized that the wolf that he was wasn&#39;t mindless. But being intelligent didn&#39;t mean not scary.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t we just show everyone that we&#39;re good?&quot; Mikey asked after a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not everyone would believe us, dear, and among those that do, not all of them would be supportive&quot; Margaret said softly, &quot;revealing what we are... that is best done on an individual basis and with one you are certain can be trusted... and that takes time. Nate and I had been dating for almost a year before he felt it was safe to reveal to me that he was a werewolf... and he had many of the same fears you have now, Hunter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And Alice has seemed like a nice girl,&quot; May commented, feeling her own anxieties about being a werewolf superseded by maternal instinct, &quot;be careful but always be yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if something happens?&quot; Hunter asked her, &quot;the change... it... felt rather good toward the end... what if it drives me to... to do something to make THAT last longer...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As in are you going to turn into some perverted furry rapist, the way the Big Bad Wolf in Little Red Riding Hood has been depicted?&quot; Jeanie told him, &quot;No that won&#39;t happen. James and May have raised you too well for that to happen. Some instincts may be knew to you Hunter... and you as well, May... but they will never control you. Your mind isn&#39;t lost to anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re sure?&quot; Hunter asked nervously.<br />
<br />
Again Jeanie nodded and then rubbed his head with one paw, &quot;and if you want, your Uncle and I can help you with regard to any self-control issues you think you might have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your father and I will try to help in any way we can too,&quot; May told him as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;As will your grandfather and I,&quot; Margaret finished.<br />
<br />
Hunter felt relieved to hear that.</p>
