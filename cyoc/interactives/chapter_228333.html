<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“But I don’t want to be somebody else-“, Jake protested.<br />
<br />
“We’re running out of time. And I don’t like this any more than you do, but Joe needs us,” Wayne said with a resigned tone. “And that’s the last complex though I’m going to have for the rest of the day,” he popped his pill into his mouth and swallowed. He looked straight at Jake, “If you don’t take yours, well, Cubbie will be here any minute, and he’s gonna have one thing on that simple mind of his... Ahhh!” Wayne doubled over like Joe had.<br />
<br />
Jake looked at the pill in his hand, the unassuming line drawing of a teddy bear head on it, then back over at Wayne as he began a smilier transformation to Joe’s.  Where Joe had been wearing clothes, Wayne wasn’t. Jake had a front row seat to exactly what the Ursapills could do as he saw the muscles on Wayne’s back writhe and pulse as the growth took hold.  Blond hair erupted from what seemed like every pore on his body as his muscles swelled and he crossed the threshold into teen bodybuilder status.  Wayne stood up, still panting, still pulsing, still groaning, almost moaning, facing away from Jake.  Jake could see a bushy blond beard sprout up around the sides of the widening head.<br />
<br />
“Shit, man, I forgot how big he is,” Wayne said, standing up in front of Jake, his hands flat against his temples, shaking his head, as if he were trying to clear cobwebs. His muscles were still expanding, though not as fast as at first.   Jake could swear his voice sounded different. Wayne turned around and locked eyes with Jake. With a sultry stare he lowered his now massive right hand and cupped the large, near empty pouch of the posing strap. Never breaking eye contact, he winked at Jake with a smirk and added a much deeper sounding “…..everywhere…”<br />
<br />
Jake’s gaze wandered down to the behemoth’s right hand as he saw the pouch inflating, not with air, but with flesh. Wayne let out a low moan as his python grew, the overload of sensations as a foreskin regrew over his ballooning organ sent him over the edge. “Oh fuuuuuuck. Ungh!” Wayne’s expression was that of ecstasy as his balls churned away, growing as they passed the size of jumbo eggs. The bulge outgrew the hand cupping it and continued until it was pulling the fabric thin and taught. The gold fabric was now so thin it left nothing to the imagination as Jake could see a detailed outline and impression of the brute’s barely contained beast and could clearly see the guy wasn’t even chubbed, Wayne’s python was now an uncut hose sitting atop of the biggest balls Jake had ever seen, all clearly visible through the stretched fabric. <br />
<br />
“Holy fuck that’s a RUSH!” Wayne yelled as the growth finished and he stretched, arms reaching over his head, putting his full mass on display. A pro level bodybuilder undeniably, muscle hung off of the former gangly man. He could most likely step on any stage and smoke the competition if it weren’t for his blond hair covering his body. Even with the thick coating of blond man fur, the sheer mass of his muscles ensured that every separation could be seen. In his stretched out posture Jake could see lats hanging off the man’s back, covered in a pelt of blond hair that grew around and encircled his enormous pecs. His pecs, stretched out as they were in his pose, stood clearly off his large torso, nips still pointed down by the sheer amount of muscle he now carried. He finished the stretch, bringing his ham like arms down, the bowling ball biceps brushing  first his juicy round pecs, and then his overdeveloped lats as his arms came to rest slightly out from his sides. He returned to what was now his normal posture as he involuntarily rolled his shoulders and flexed various muscles, feeling the heft of his mass hanging on his frame. Absentmindedly, he rubbed his left hand through his forest of blond chest hair, tweaking one of his nipples as he bounced his massive pecs. Looking back at Jake, “Enjoying the show, Jake, brah?” he winked again and with his free arm gave his beard a quick stroke as he brought his arm up and flexed his bicep, licking it for extra effect, while still pinching his nips. Holding the pose for a second, he gave Jake an intense sultry look, with a wry smirk behind his facial hair. “Hehe, s’okay, I’m just kidding’ ya, I know yer straight.”<br />
<br />
Jake thought his voice sounded…dumber somehow. It was definitely deeper, but there was a lack of intelligence to it as well. <br />
<br />
“W- W- Wayne?” Jake stuttered, not sure what was going to happen with Cubbie, given what had happened with Pops. <br />
<br />
“Who tha fuck is that ‘Wayne’ guy, bro?”, he brought his arms down, relaxing, the sultry expression replaced with something Jake thought was more…vacant. “You know your brother called me that exact same thing the first time he turned into Pops? I mean what the fuck? You both have known me for basically the same amount of time, and I’ve always been Cubbie!”<br />
<br />
“Wait, so you remember Joe and Pops?” Jake didn’t know what he expected, but Cubbie knowing that Joe was Pops surprised him.<br />
<br />
Cubbie gave Jake a quizzical look, something Jake could tell Cubbie did quite often. “Yah, Joe came with me to that Ursa-thing resort. Didn’t know why he wanted to come, ya know bein’ straight an all, but after he turned into to Pops, he came all weekend,” Cubbie smiled at Jake, bordering on a leer. “Hehe.  Cum.  Hehehe.” Cubbie gave a vacuous laugh, entertaining himself with his frat boy humor. “Come to think of it….heh heh….cum!” he dumbly laughed again at his own puerile joke while he continued to involuntarily flex various muscles, “we all fucked. All weekend.  It was awesome, brah!” He grinned vacantly and absent-mindedly began pawing at his massive meat, remembering all the various positions and acts.<br />
<br />
“You don’t remember being…I don’t know…different when you first got there? Or even earlier today?” Jake was searching for something he could use as a  method to get to Joe through Pops.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck you talkin’ about, bro.  Whatcha think would happen if I’d taken one of those pills? I’m a fuckin’ bear wet dream as is,” he grinned dumbly, proudly gesturing to his body. He moved into a front lat spread, showcasing just how big he was. “Could you imagine me pumped up bigger,” he relaxed and started massaging his bulge as it came to life, straining the already very confining pouch to its limits, “…hairer….,” his eyes glazed over as the posing strap gave up, and his dick sprang out of the pouch, balls crashing on his hairy quads as the poser lost the battle, “Fuck, dude! I’m totally bricked up! I gotta fuck.” He looked right at Jake almost begging, “Look, I either gotta fuck or get fucked by someone. Now. And I usually don’t go for twinks,” he looked Jake up and down, “ ‘specially straight ones, but bro, a hole’s a hole.” He stood back, his massive arms crossed over his expansive hairy chest, his gargantuan dick sticking straight out towards Jake. “Yours or mine?”<br />
<br />
“Way- I mean Cubbie! Look I’m not into all that. I just want to help Joe-“, Jake was trying to ignore the naked muscle freak standing in front of him, trying to reconcile that this used to be timid, scrawny, weak Wayne.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, yeah, Joe fucking later. Us fucking now.” Cubbie’s massive cock was bobbing in time with his increasing heartbeat.<br />
<br />
“I’m not gay! And neither are you, at least you used to not be-“ Jake started to panic, having flashbacks of what happened with Pops just after his transformation. Whatever else those pills did, he reasoned they must send the libido into the stratosphere. <br />
<br />
“I kept a couple of those candy things that Joe ate before he turned into Pops. I’m pretty sure that’s what changed him.  I kept a whole bunch of ‘em just in case Joe wanted to play around some more. Pops is so fuckin’ hot and so up for anything…..everything,” he twisted his nipples as a low moan came out of him. “Fuck, brah! Eat one, and let’s fuck, then let’s go have a three way with Pops.” He grabbed one of the Ursapills from his bag.</p>
