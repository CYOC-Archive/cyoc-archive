<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate knew what he really wanted and managed to paw open the fridge door. Somewhere in here were a couple bags of deli meats he picked up at the store a couple days ago. That sounded like it would hit the spot to him. Propping himself up on his hind legs, he was able to pull open the meats drawer with one of his forepaws. He reached in with his mouth and grabbed a package of roast beef in his maw. He proceeded to close the drawer and the fridge. <br />
<br />
He walked into the living room, bag of sliced roast beef still hanging from his mouth as he climbed onto the sofa. He worked the sliding zipper at the top of the bag to the side carefully and then was able to pull out the meat with his mouth. As he was doing this, he pondered how amazing this would be for an unsuspecting person to see a dog performing like this. He found some amusement in this thought as he slowly began to chow down on his delicious meal. The condo was so quiet without any sort of electronics going or anything. He wondered what he would do next, once his meal was finished. <br />
<br />
After his meal, he began walking around the condo, trying to get used to walking on four legs and then as he got comfortable with that, running. He was having fun with it but stopped when he got winded as he laid down panting. It didn&#39;t even dawn on him at first that was what he was doing, but he was. He heard a door close in the hallway outside and some footsteps. Before he even knew what he was doing, he was on his feet and running to his door, barking and pawing at the door. He quickly stopped himself, telling himself it was just one of the neighbors. He realized those primal dog instincts were kicking in. It started to sink in that he didn&#39;t just look like a dog, he was a dog. He promised himself he needed to try harder to hang on to his human intellect. <br />
<br />
For the rest of the day, he walked around the condo, trying to keep himself entertained and enjoy his new body. He didn&#39;t dare go outside lest his neighbors get curious or worse Animal Control gets called on him. That&#39;s the last thing he needed to explain, how a naked human him wound up in a kennel when just hours before he had been a dog. No, best to stay inside and out of sight. Live out his canine hours in secret. <br />
<br />
That night, he laid on top his bed as he thought more about his incredible experience. Tomorrow morning, he would transform back to his old self. He knew he wanted to do this again though and started making a mental list. He would do it right this time and get the real dog experience. He would so to the local pet store and get a food bowl and a water bowl. Get dog food and dog biscuits. He wanted to try it all. And then he&#39;d put on the medallion and transform again. He&#39;d still have another 24 hours as a dog before he had to go back to work. <br />
<br />
The following morning, he woke up still a dog. He jumped off the bed and went to the bathroom, propping himself up against the sink. He pawed one of the faucet handles and lapped up some water from the tap. He tried to remember what time it had been when he activated the amulet yesterday. He knew it was in the morning, but that was it. He was walking back into the living room and was about to jump up on the couch when he began to feel that familiar cramping feeling. It was starting. <br />
<br />
Nate watched as his forepaws slowly shifted back into human hands as his claws receded. He felt his legs start to shift and reform into his previous human proportions. His long, shaggy fur began to recede back into his body as it continued to reform back to human. His canine muzzle slowly receded back into his face as his face slowly shifted back to human. A few short minutes later, he was back to his normal human self, sitting on the carpeted floor. He heard a click and looked down at the medallion. It was back at the 12 o&#39;clock setting it started at. He took off the medallion and set it on the coffee table. He wanted to do it all again. He wanted to transform and go back to being a dog. But he stopped himself, he had to make preparations first. He quickly got dressed, remembering the plans he made the night before. For the second time, he was going to do it right.</p>
