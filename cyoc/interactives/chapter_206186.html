<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen stomped her way through Indiana and Illinois in a day, covering the distance quickly with her lumbering stride.<br />
<br />
She felt the sun rise behind her as she approached St. Louis. Its rays warmed her shoulders long before her legs. She was glad to find that she hadn&#39;t grown at all through Illinois, but approached the Mississippi with caution. As her legs carried her closer and closer, she saw the Arch. She stepped into the Mississippi, feeling its cold water wash over her feet several minutes later. It barely came up to her ankles, and she crossed it in a matter of seconds, now standing almost shoulder-level with the Arch&#39;s observation deck.<br />
<br />
A Park Ranger stood atop it, and yelled out to Jen. <i>I guess this is the next curse bearer,</i> she thought, preparing herself for the changes she was about to undergo. She leaned down to meet the ranger, placing her arms on her knees.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you Jennifer Smith?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes-ooooohh&quot; she said, interrupted by one of her hands reaching up to rub at her crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, but, Transform or Dare?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;DA-OHHHHHH&quot; Jen moaned, her hand now fully inside herself. As her own hand continued to hold her hostage, the minute ticked by. She shuddered, shaking the ground below and causing a mild tsunami on the river.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Jen, since you didn&#39;t answer, you get both. For your transformation, you&#39;ll now gain 25 feet instead of 10, and your proportions will exaggerate even further. Your hips will widen, your legs will grow in both length and width, and your breasts will expand. Your neck will stop growing, and return to be proportional with your head, since you honestly look pretty weird with such a long, thick neck and tiny little head.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen continued to moan, her voice morphing back to her old one as her throat shrunk. She lost a bit of height as her neck became shorter, until she stood only 640 feet tall. However, she could barely see ahead of herself. Looking to each side, her shoulders seemed to go on forever, over 150 feet wide. She tried looking back over her shoulder, but could see even less. The ranger and arch were now blocked entirely by the slope of her chest. She felt her chest heave up and down as her breathing increased, panic setting in. <i>I can&#39;t even see where I&#39;m going anymore!</i> she thought, images of buildings being knocked over and havoc in her wake blowing through her mind like a hurricane.<br />
<br />
The ranger&#39;s voice snapped her back into reality as she laid out Jen&#39;s dare.<br />
<br />
&quot;For your dare, you&#39;ll continue marching to the next curse-bearer. You&#39;ll also randomly begin to slam your body into buildings, natural structures, anything, and you won&#39;t be able to stop moving when you stop walking. That could mean twerking, groping yourself, anything. Good luck Jen, I&#39;m sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen began to cry as her body stepped forward. She could barely stand the predicament she found herself in, 600 feet above the ground and unable to stop herself. Her rampage through St. Louis had only begun.<br />
<br />
Her body instinctively led her around the arch as more of the ranger&#39;s transformation curse took effect. She felt her ass bulk up further behind her, sticking out in a truly gargantuan shelf. Her hips also expanded, pushing her arms out at her sides. She couldn&#39;t see any of it, but she knew they were now wider than her shoulders, and still growing. Her thighs also bulked up to support her new ass, the movement of it all sending her overboard. She felt her breasts pull heavily on her chest as they too expanded. When the warmth in her body stopped, she tried taking herself in. Brief glances in skyscraper glass revealed the magnitude of her changes.<br />
<br />
Her breasts were huge, even for her frame, sagging down to her navel. She lifted them up, marveling at her still-toned stomach underneath. Her hips had also expanded comically large, brushing against the buildings and leaving destruction as she walked. Her puny head looked comical, unable to see where she was walking at all. Her voice, despite all of the air being pushed through her throat by her apartment-sized lungs, was only as loud as it was prior to her change. <i>How am I even going be able to communicate with the next curse bearer?</i> she wondered.<br />
<br />
She carelessly stepped westward, leaving a path not unlike a tornado&#39;s in her wake. She slammed into skyscrapers, feeling her ass quake on impact, threatening to knock some of them down. The glass broke over her hips painlessly. As she trampled through the city, the inevitable horns began to blare. Each horn caused her to jolt upward, and outward. Every four horn-honks made her grow 100 feet taller, the skyscrapers quickly shrinking away from her compromised field of view.  She sobbed as horn after horn blared below her, each one causing her to grow. It seemed to take forever for her to get outside of the city, hundreds of cars honked as she thundered on. She felt them crush underneath her weight, and trees felt like toothpicks.<br />
<br />
She guessed that she must be walking along a highway, because the horns didn&#39;t stop even as the ground below became farmland. Jolt of growth after jolt of growth tormented her for hours.<br />
<br />
As she left town, she towered over 5,000 feet tall, the air noticeably thinner. Her entire body felt alien to her. The nerve signals took ages to go from her brain to her limbs, and it felt like she was just along for the ride in her own body. In some ways, she was, being cursed to walk ever-westward until she reached the final cursebearer. However, even the parts of her she could control felt horrifyingly distant.<br />
<br />
In the distance, a thunderstorm loomed. The horns had stopped, but each thunderclap and lightning strike brought a familiar jolt. &quot;WHY CAN&#39;T I CATCH A BREAK!&quot; she lamented, the storm washing over her. The water pelted her massive body, hail bashing against her painfully but leaving no mark. She grew and grew through the storm, lightning never striking her, until her head poked into the clouds.<br />
<br />
As she walked through the storm, night was falling. The horizon was unbelievably far, and she feared it was only going to get farther. She cried until a small cliff caught her foot. She briefly fell forward, her arms shooting out to her sides faster than she could have imagined, before she fell backwards onto her ass.<br />
<br />
She sobbed as she lay in the cornfield, almost 10,000 feet tall. The new fat in her ass cushioned the fall, but her pelvis still ached. She felt the earth crater around her when she fell, soft, wet soil and a tractor underneath her ass. It was distressing to her, feeling the fall happen several minutes after it had taken place, but she had more pressing issues to deal with.<br />
<br />
Her breasts surged backwards in the wake, and spilled out over her shoulders. She was powerless to stop them as they buried her head. They pressed heavily against her ribs, unbelievably massive. She tried to push them off, but they were too large and heavy. Every time she pushed one up, it would just slide back down as soon as she let go. The only way she was going to be able to see again was if she stood up, but first, she had to masturbate.<br />
<br />
She felt around beside her for anything she could use before slamming her hand into a grain silo. It felt like a toy, but she blindly guided it into her vagina, pumping it back and forth until she came with a torrent of cum. Her hands went again and again, eventually finding other things to masturbate with, like a loaded semi tanker. Its 80,000LB weight felt like nothing, but it did the job she needed. She lay in the field, sweating, until she could compel her legs to move.<br />
<br />
As she got up, her breasts heaved down, and she could breathe again! She sighed in relief until she noticed that familiar jolt again, this time coming from a tornado siren nearby.<br />
<br />
&quot;JUST GIVE ME A BREAK ALREADY!&quot; she sobbed as she got up, her body beginning its long walk westward again, each footfall creating a small earthquake under her weight.</p>
