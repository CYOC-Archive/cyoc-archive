<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Victor was your average sales clerk. Came to work at seven in the morning, worked till four and then went home. Home was a small apartment he shared with his girlfriend Alexis, whom he was planning to propose to one of these days. Alexis was, to Victor, very beautiful. At twenty-five, she stood five foot two, had long red hair that fell midway down her back and soft, pale white skin that glowed in just the right amount of light. At the age of twenty-seven, Victor stood five foot nine, had black hair cut short and finely tan skin, giving him the appearance of being in the military...which he had never done or probably would.<br />
<br />
It was just after work, leaving and wishing his boss a good day, that he spotted the amulet. It was lying on the ground, half covered with leaves and other refuse found in the gutter.<br />
<br />
Living and working on the outskirts of town, Victor looked at the piece of jewelry, thought about leaving it, but instead picked it up and pocketing it, began his walk home to his apartment and Alexis, who sometimes worried that he been hit or been in some kind of accident if he took too long walking home.<br />
<br />
Letting himself into the apartment, he noticed that Alexis wasn't home yet from work, which was odd for her because she usually got home before him. Shrugging, Victor headed for the kitchen and turning on the tap, he began to wash the amulet.<br />
<br />
Afterward, he held it up to the light and watching it sparkle a coppery glint, he tried to make out what someone had carved into one side and what the image was on the other side. His musing was interrupted by Alexis coming home and deciding he would give it to her as a surprise, Victor slipped it around his neck and tucked it inside his shirt...figuring he would give it to her later.<br />
<br />
Kissing Alexis, she told him, &quot;Stopped at the local Good Will store to look for books and I found you something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Interested, he asked what and looked on as she began to search through different bags. After a bit, she pulled out a silk robe, black in colour with white trim on the cuffs and the edges. Taking it, he thanked her as she kissed him and then told him, &quot;You always said you needed a new robe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thanking her again, he kissed her again, took the robe to their shared bedroom and laid it on the bed.<br />
<br />
Several hours later, Alexis squatted on the bed, wearing nothing but a skimpy red and black nighty. Telling Victor in a playful tone, &quot;Take me now,&quot; she rocked gently back, exposing that she was wearing no underwear.<br />
<br />
Turned on, Victor began to undo his clothes. Nude, he crawled onto the bed, but stopped when his hand touched the robe. Growling seductively, he shifted and stood back up and pulling on the robe, he began to move toward the bed once again, the sight of his wife posing pulling him on.<br />
<br />
As he reached the bed, the robe touched the medallion he still wore and immediately he received an static electric shock. Yelping, he slapped at his chest and instead hit the piece of jewelry.<br />
<br />
He was just about to take it off, when suddenly the room began to spin. Sitting down on the bed, he heard Alexis ask, &quot;Honey, what's wrong,&quot; concern creeping into her voice as a strange tingling sensation swept across his chest, abdomen and groin.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Victor doubled over as a flash of cramps swept through his body. He would have remained like that except for the fact that without warning his stomach began to bulge outward.<br />
<br />
Moreover, it wasn't just his stomach. As a silent scream escaped Alexis’s lips, Victor's chest began to pushed outward. As the nipples, areola and the breast became more pronounced, Victor's pubic hair on his body, arms, legs and crotch slowly retreated into his body. Another flash of cramps and Victor placed a hand, one that was shrinking and getting smaller by the second, to his belly.<br />
<br />
As he could feel something moving inside of him, a burning sensation rippled through his body, intensifying when it reached his tailbone, genitals, feet and ears.<br />
<br />
Trying to stand, Victor flopped back, just as Alexis asked, &quot;Victor? Honey? What is happening to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Pain like nothing he had ever felt before as his penis and testicles violently shrunk and then pressed into his body and a bright pink gash formed between his legs. Standing again, nearly falling back, Victor gained his balance and stumbled toward the closet, where he knew that Alexis kept a mirror hanging on the wall.<br />
<br />
Opening the closet partway, Victor paused as a sense of vertigo washed over him and somehow, he knew the transformation was over. Hesitantly he peered into the mirror and took in what he saw.<br />
<br />
What he saw was something that was neither human nor animal. Blinking back at Victor, he saw a female, about age between nineteen and twenty, standing about five foot one. Her breasts are somewhere around a B to a C cup. Her hair is white with black stripes and the same pattern can be seen across he belly, bare groin and upper legs. The feet end in a set of hooves and a white tail with black stripes twitches back and forth. Ears, with the same black and white pattern, stick up though her hair. But it's the belly that Victor focuses on.<br />
<br />
Touching it, feeling the life inside, Victor would guess that she is about four to five months along and he is not sure, but he thinks the unborn foal is female.<br />
<br />
Touching the breasts, flicking the nipples, Victor then places a hand between his legs and confirms that he is indeed now a female. Seeing Alexis's pale and scared face reflected in the mirror...noting that tracing halfway down the face is a purple stripe, one on each side, starting just slightly above the eye...he tells Alexis in a scared feminine voice, &quot;I think we need to figure something out. Because if I didn't know any better, I would think that the robe you bought me just turned be into a young pregnant woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alexis nods and then sits down on the bed, unsure of what to say.</p>
