<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>dedicated to a certain somebody -- more to come in this branch :)</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While his brother was spending most of the school day being a big boy, Ethan was at least spared the up-and-down scare of not knowing when a change would happen. The previous day&#39;s random swaps had been hugely exciting, and Ethan&#39;s shrinking during sex with Haylee had been incredible! Still, reverting back to just the junior edition for the best part of the day was as scary as always, and for Ethan it felt like returning to an old friend. The shameful emotions were all still there, but now paired with a private love for his little dick.<br />
<br />
So, at the afternoon swim practice, Ethan was in a good mood. Riding high from the nervewracking day as a tiny-cock &#39;stud&#39;, he had just scored another great time in the pool, beating out Greg&#39;s best attempt. With them being the last two of the team to get to change, they basically had the room to themselves. Satisfied it was safe, Ethan began to pull the fabric stuffing out of his speedo, not worried about Greg&#39;s presence since he was in on the secret.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still got your bro&#39;s stuff, huh? It&#39;s been a while.&quot; Greg commented as he watched Ethan extract the padding. &quot;Say, I&#39;ve got an idea. Why don&#39;t we do a friendly comparison, see how we stack up now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, I dunno.&quot; Ethan frowned. The suggestion sounded a bit silly to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just some locker room jokes. Only us here.&quot; Greg nudged his leg. &quot;Come on dude, we know how big you really are. What&#39;s wrong with a bit of harmless fun?&quot;<br />
<br />
The first thought through Ethan&#39;s mind was that this WAS his real size, but the shared ownership was a deeper secret for the brothers alone. <br />
<br />
&quot;Harmless fun.&quot; Ethan considered it and then nodded, agreeing. Slipping off their speedos, the two proceeded across to the showers, with Ethan noticing Greg&#39;s initial glance at his junk, and then smirk. Unfazed, he started the water and Greg came in very close, right inside his personal space so they were almost touching.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brothers and sisters lending stuff to each other is pretty common, but trading dicks?&quot; Greg chuckled lightly. &quot;You must REALLY love your brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan gazed down at the little thing at his groin, and shrugged. &quot;Actually, I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I heard that the foreskin makes it more sensitive,&quot; Greg went on, and he switched to a joking tone. &quot;Just wearing a speedo must be enough to get you going!&quot; He laughed.<br />
<br />
Joining in, Ethan laughed too, but uneasily. He wasn&#39;t about to mention that his little cock DID get hard from almost anything, nor that he loved how it felt. Thankfully Greg kept going with his analysing, fully into the comparison and being the &#39;bigger&#39; man.<br />
<br />
&quot;No pubes either. You&#39;ve really nailed the &#39;kiddy&#39; look.&quot; Greg brushed his own. He had a modest amount of body hair, and he didn&#39;t shave. &quot;I&#39;d probably be quicker if I was that streamlined too, but, y&#39;know,&quot; he grinned, &quot;the chicks love a guy with hair on his ... chest.&quot;<br />
<br />
Opening his mouth to reply to the implied meaning, Ethan was interrupted by the other boy gently touching his dick. The pair made eye contact, Greg&#39;s expression asking forgiveness, and skipping the consent phase entirely. Ethan shivered at the touch, biting his lip, and he nodded slowly in acceptance. He had agreed to do this, and a comparison invited touch by necessity.<br />
<br />
Moving in yet closer so they were properly front to front, their legs just about touching, Greg pressed their dicks together, sandwiching them in a vertical grip in one hand. They could see both in clear contrast. Greg&#39;s decidedly average junk was like a skyscraper, and part of Ethan just wanted to stare at the size difference -- around half the length, and FAR thinner -- and memorise how much smaller he was.<br />
<br />
&quot;We got a winner.&quot; Greg joked, the disparity very obvious. His eyes swept over their packages, seeming to greatly enjoy the situational opportunity of what he was doing. &quot;Even your balls are, like, miniscule. Have they dropped yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Ethan could even begin to formulate a response, he felt the fingers of Greg&#39;s other hand brush the bottom of his sac, and the pleasant shock of the touch stunned him into a temporary silence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah. You&#39;re not through puberty. Still baby soft and tight.&quot; Feeling them for a moment, Ethan&#39;s embarrassment running hot, Greg withdrew his second hand, and then quickly groped his own pair. &quot;Not like mine. These are some nuts!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was actually true, with Greg&#39;s testicles making his mediocre cock seem less middling with their more generous volume. Addled, Ethan was finding it hard to think straight and not be drawn into Greg&#39;s power trip. Trying to keep it together, he focused on scouring his memory to recall if Eric was carrying more than his team mate. The image of his little brother&#39;s large fat balls definitely outweighed Greg&#39;s set by a decent amount, but Ethan&#39;s relief through distraction was shortlived, because Greg&#39;s voice brought him crashing back to reality.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, can&#39;t just compare soft. The true measurement is the boner.&quot; He moved back a bit, so there was space. &quot;Let&#39;s get hard.&quot;<br />
<br />
Beginning to stroke, Greg&#39;s gaze stayed on Ethan, and he knew the attention was deliberate. The cocky smirk said it all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something wrong?&quot; The question was veiled mockery about why Ethan wasn&#39;t touching himself, with the answer already known.<br />
<br />
&quot;I- ... um,&quot; he stammered, trying not to let his voice break, &quot;I- ... already am.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, my bad.&quot; The feigned sympathy and soft amused snort along with it was stinging, but after stroking himself a few times, Greg moved in again.<br />
<br />
Hard, the difference was even greater. Less than half the size, Ethan couldn&#39;t keep his eyes off the two cocks pressed together, how his was even more childlike and made Greg&#39;s seem like it was huge. Not only that, but the feeling of another hot stiff length touching his was weirdly exciting. He hadn&#39;t considered an attraction to a team mate, or any boy before, really -- and Greg definitely WASN&#39;T his type -- but the idea of cock was never more appealing. It was mortifying, but Ethan wanted to rub against it, feel his little marbles and short rigid shaft with its super sensitive head slide against a much larger, more masculine penis. He was SO small, and seeing himself dwarfed made him wish he could nuzzle his dick in closer, kissing the superior crotch and praising its size.<br />
<br />
Why did the thought interest him THAT much?<br />
<br />
Greg, on the other hand, was in another zone.<br />
<br />
Having his dick tower over that of the swim team&#39;s star, infamous for having the largest on campus?<br />
<br />
He felt pretty damn good about that.<br />
<br />
Letting go, Greg turned to the side and began to wash himself, the pep in his voice and attitude all too clear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that WAS fun.&quot; He laughed, and added on a jest. &quot;You should stay swapped, I&#39;m kind of a fan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, &#39;fun&#39;.&quot; Ethan&#39;s muttered answer was as sour as he could make it, trying to convey an air of bored annoyance at Greg&#39;s shenanigans. &quot;Don&#39;t hold your breath.&quot;<br />
<br />
Still, as he turned away to rinse himself too, his tiny juvenile cock at full extension, Ethan secretly wanted to jerk off, and revel in the humiliation of being reduced to a fraction of average -- and all in the presence of another boy.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t much later in the day when something very unexpected happened. After dodging the weirdness of Greg&#39;s power trip in the showers and keeping his emotions hidden, Ethan recovered and he and his frenemy dressed, parting ways like normal to go to class. His final period was a study one, but right when it began and he was free, he got a txt message on his phone.<br />
<br />
It was from Haylee and it said: &quot;hey, u know jared montgomery from the team?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan did know him. Jared was one of the other top-ranked swimmers, and if he had been better, Ethan would have considered him a rival like Greg, but he wasn&#39;t as good. Regardless, Jared had a high opinion of himself, and had a very self-important personality. He hated anybody above him on the rankings, though he seemed to have a special jealousy of Ethan in particular. The stud reputation Ethan had also seemed to anger Jared, who (with passable but not amazing looks) overestimated his pull as a babe-magnet. His behaviour was usually passive-aggressive undermining of those upstaging him, and being a rich kid too made his one-sided vendetta against Ethan even more exaggerated.<br />
<br />
&quot;ya, what about him?&quot; Ethan txt back.<br />
<br />
&quot;well um right now hes down next to D block quad sharing this pic with gabby and her posse nd tryin to get them to spread it round&quot; came her next txt.<br />
<br />
&quot;just thought i&#39;d give u heads up, big guy. ur cooler than him and i know its not true &lt;3&quot; came another.<br />
<br />
Next was an image. Ethan opened it.<br />
<br />
It was from the showers, not too many minutes earlier. Where Greg would have been, stroking himself to erection, was a cubicle door, but the rest of the image? It was just Ethan, with a lost-puppy expression, water running over his toned swimmer&#39;s physique. The angle of the shot was particularly good to accentuate his lower body, and down below, his little youthful stiffy was unmistakable, the infantile balls drawn up close even with the shower&#39;s warmth.<br />
<br />
It felt like the bottom had dropped out of his stomach as he gazed at it.<br />
<br />
Jared was sharing this nude image of him!<br />
<br />
Trying desperately not to freak out, Ethan slid his phone into his pocket, his hands shaking. His mind raced as he tried to think what he could do. If he didn&#39;t act fast and counter this, EVERYONE would know.<br />
<br />
That picture would spread like crazy, and his reputation would be ruined with it.<br />
<br />
Setting off towards D block, he racked his brains as he walked quickly. How could he deal with this? Even if he confronted Jared, it wasn&#39;t like he could prove anything, and definitely not when it WAS his real cock. How could he cancel out photographic evidence? The picture&#39;s quality was good enough that nobody would dismiss it as being too blurry or otherwise visually questionable.<br />
<br />
All he could do was try to bluff his way through.<br />
<br />
He spotted the group in a secluded area outside next to the garden; Gabriella, a popular cheerleader, with her squad of attractive friends Mindy, Jessica, and Amy. Haylee was also with them, because she often hung with Mindy, though she wasn&#39;t that close to the others. Lastly was Jared himself.<br />
<br />
Marching up to them, the discussion died away as he arrived, and though he was terrified, he faked his confidence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Montgomery,&quot; Ethan growled, his bag slung over his back and fists clenched, trying to project a false image of bravado, &quot;what fucking lies are you trying to spread?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno, Ethan.&quot; Gabriella answered, and she stared at him like the nexus of school gossip that she was. &quot;Looks real to me. A bombshell like this will travel like wildfire.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; chimed in Jessica. &quot;I mean, the camera doesn&#39;t lie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See? All true.&quot; Jared&#39;s smug expression was laced with a healthy dose of fuck-you aimed squarely at Ethan, and a shit-eating grin. &quot;Just wanted to tell these ladies that Mr Stud isn&#39;t actually all that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re full of shit. That pic is a fake!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jared laughed, and both Jessica and Amy stifled giggles of their own, but Haylee shot him a wink and spoke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, I&#39;m not convinced. Like, the lighting is a bit off and that deep fake shit is so good these days.&quot; She gave a pointed look to Jared. &quot;Besides, isn&#39;t Ethan like, constantly outperforming you in the pool? You&#39;ve sure got a good motive to talk shit about him. Plus ... I&#39;ve seen him in a speedo enough to know this can&#39;t be real.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think I edited it THAT quickly and THAT perfectly?!&quot; He dismissed her accusation. &quot;Hell no. This guy&#39;s just been really good at hiding the fact that he&#39;s hung like a midget.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It IS a fake!&quot; Ethan insisted, somehow managing to keep his nerve and not turn into a whimpering mess. &quot;You doctored it! Don&#39;t you think people would KNOW by now if this was actually true?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or you could be really good at keeping secrets?&quot; Mindy spoke up, but she seemed neutral, probably because of Haylee&#39;s influence. &quot;If it&#39;s true, just be straight up about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, embrace yourself.&quot; Jared mocked. &quot;Become the baby boy you were born to be!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to get rid of it! Right now! Or-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or what?&quot; He sneered, interrupting. &quot;What are you gonna do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Without even thinking, Ethan dropped his bag, his hands going instinctively to his belt. Committed to the bluff, his heart was pounding, but he paused, his fingers on his belt buckle. How far could he take this? Was it even going to work?<br />
<br />
Could he pull this off?<br />
<br />
Immediately Jared began to laugh, with all the girls but Haylee joining in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, are you gonna give me another pic?&quot; He was still laughing as he spoke, unable to keep it out of the words. &quot;Go on, pull them down. Prove me right. Show everyone!&quot;<br />
<br />
Frozen, he couldn&#39;t move his hands, and the laughter began to intensify.<br />
<br />
&quot;I knew it!&quot; Triumphant, Jared turned to Gabriella, scoffing. &quot;Little dick Ethan is a total fraud! Cringe is off the charts!&quot;<br />
<br />
The world felt like it was closing in on Ethan, the humiliation of his inescapable conundrum making him want to shrink into the ground, but at that moment ...<br />
<br />
... across town, Eric&#39;s soccer competition was over, and just as the younger brother finished changing, he dug around for the well-concealed prize in his school bag, and ...<br />
<br />
... Ethan&#39;s crotch grew warm.<br />
<br />
Without hesitating, he undid the belt and dropped his pants, underwear and all.<br />
<br />
A hush fell over the group, Ethan standing in front of them with his cock swaying gently, the thick flaccid length jutting out proudly over his plump dangling balls. Jessica and Amy were staring in a mixture of shock and awe, while Mindy was taking her own covert snapshot, her interest undisguised, and Haylee was simply admiring the goods with a satisfied &#39;yeah, I&#39;ve had that cock&#39; look on her face.<br />
<br />
Gabriella, on the other hand, was pissed.<br />
<br />
She gazed at Ethan&#39;s big-boy for only two seconds before she turned to Jared. &quot;You asshole! You DID photoshop it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What- .. no! I- ... he&#39;s- ... he&#39;s- ... it&#39;s not really-&quot; He spluttered, unable to deny what was plain as day.<br />
<br />
&quot;Girls, delete that garbage.&quot; As the others complied and Ethan pulled up his pants, Gabriella snatched Jared&#39;s phone from his hand, and before he could even react, in a couple of rapid button taps, the master copy was gone.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! No- ... fuck! Gabby, don&#39;t!&quot; His protest was too late, and she threw the device back in his lap.<br />
<br />
&quot;To think, I almost considered going out with you.&quot; She fixed him in a withering ice-queen glare. &quot;All this time you were just an insecure douche, jealous of somebody better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck!&quot; Jared swore, and he stood, phone clenched in a fist and stormed off, with no further claims to make.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was messed up,&quot; Mindy commented, but she shrugged. &quot;The view was worth it though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mindy!&quot; Amy admonished, and Ethan blushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Ethan. I never knew he was THAT much of a bitch, and we&#39;re experts on being bitches.&quot; Gabriella sighed, and she stood, the other three in her clique following suit. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, your reputation is intact. I&#39;m not gonna lie for him. We won&#39;t slander you, will we girls?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not a chance!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re too cute!&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabby rolled her eyes at Jessica&#39;s vapid answer, and then waved at Ethan before she flounced past with the other three in tow, Mindy&#39;s look lingering on him before she followed along. Finally Haylee stood up, waiting until the others were beyond earshot before she spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, that was dramatic. Was that your little brother swapping you guys again? His sense of timing is like ... cosmic karma, or something&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Ethan&#39;s pulse was slowing, and his incredible fear was settling down. He couldn&#39;t argue that Eric&#39;s timing had been pitch perfect. &quot;Thanks for having my back. I didn&#39;t really know what to do. I&#39;ve never been so scared in my life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But look how you came out of it!&quot; She shrugged and sidled closer, her interest in him seeming to be a constant. &quot;Four gossipy bitches are gonna talk about how Jared is a lying asshat, and Ethan is a gorgeous sweetheart with a footlong cock that they saw with their own eyes. I&#39;d say that&#39;s winning, so go with it. Also, get your little bro a gift or something, he&#39;s a fucking lifesaver.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ethan laughed, and then sighed, thoughtful. &quot;You&#39;re right. I owe Eric -- a lot.&quot;<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
Though Ethan didn&#39;t let his little brother know what had happened, after picking Eric up from school, he did buy him a bunch of his favourite candies and the latest console game. Eric enthused about how awesome the soccer competition had been, and after they got home, they put on the game and spent a while playing it before Ethan fixed them some dinner.<br />
<br />
A bit later, after the brothers had split to their rooms, Ethan felt the now-familiar sensation of his crotch pulling inward as Eric swapped them again. Chuckling to himself, he guessed that Eric probably wanted to have some evening fun, and Ethan wasn&#39;t about to begrudge that! Reaching for his phone to check the time, when he unlocked it, it was still on the image gallery and he was greeted by the one remaining copy of the shower pic.<br />
<br />
He stared at it. His body looked great, his lean trim swimmer&#39;s build in amazing shape. He was the picture of a young male teenager, except ... the entire focus of the picture was drawn to his crotch.<br />
<br />
His short thin child-dick, with his equally immature undescended testicles, reminiscent of grapes.<br />
<br />
Swallowing, Ethan kept the image on screen, his mouth going dry, and with his other hand, he unfastened his pants and reached in to free it. His tiny erection popped out, stiff as iron, and he couldn&#39;t take his eyes off the picture.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so small,&quot; he whispered to himself, working his foreskin over the responsive head with his fingers. His breathing sped up and his eyes glazed, and Ethan began to fantasise even more. The picture had been spread around, and everybody had seen it. People whispering as he walked past, laughing behind his back. The jokes about maturing, the list of degrading nicknames he was given -- they echoed through his head one by one as he stroked, getting harder and harder.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s who I am. It&#39;s true.&quot; He continued to murmur to himself, grunting softly at the exquisite feel of his sliding fingers, and the burning ridicule of it. &quot;Baby-cock Ethan. It really IS me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah!&quot; He gasped. &quot;So small and everyone knows! I&#39;m Ethan, and- ... nggh! And my cock is- ... hhhnn! Like a- ... ggghkk! ... baby&#39;s cock!&quot;<br />
<br />
With a last groan of disgraced bliss, he came, his little boyish penis convulsing, droplets of watery liquid splattering over his phone as his juvenile sex drive showed its approval.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; he thought, panting to himself, &quot;maybe I shouldn&#39;t delete my own copy just yet.&quot;</p>
