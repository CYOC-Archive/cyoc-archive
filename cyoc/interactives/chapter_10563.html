<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning early you trot off from the glade to again graze those forbidden grasses along the outer fence. So early were you that it was four hours later when John crossed the fenceline and approached your shaggy form.<br />
<br />
&quot;A Good Morning shaggy friend!&quot; John announced himself as you grazed in mindless bliss.<br />
<br />
Wild delight fills your thoughts as glad to see this man who pays so personal attention to a meer goat. You take the lead and together head for a private thicket for hours of play and provoking conversations.<br />
<br />
Today John makes himself very welcome as he makes the ground inside your thicket clean and smooth. Ready so is the place for you to write your answers in the moist sand.<br />
<br />
Hours pass and John is wise in his questions. They are direct and probing in the manner to which he asks for presupposed facts with easy yes or no answers.<br />
<br />
You are having such fun, this long conversation is prying up so many old memories that in a fated try to one question the mouth, lips, and tongue begin to work for patterns of speach once again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maa..ees!&quot; you try to answer a yes to John's question.<br />
<br />
John is delighted to see how our conversation has again stimulated my past human mentality. He smiles as again and again I work my mouth and lips as clearity gathers in the tried words.<br />
<br />
The afternoon of Winter is short and soon the long rays of the bright Sun does not offer much warmth. John you can see has a shiver now and then as our long day out in the weather has taken its toll on his physical self.<br />
<br />
&quot; Your cold, come and snuggle into my wool and get warmed up!&quot; you spoke and John quickly comes near for some comforted feeling.<br />
<br />
Much of what happened to you has been uncovered today by John and his conversation. The best part is that you have relearned how to speak well using the long narrow mouth. Until today your lips were for helping to graze and or nibble satyress' teats in mutual pleasure. Now they have been taught to form words well enough to make an old buck goat talk a respectable amount of English.<br />
<br />
Yet not all of the day was spent in clinical conversation and speach therpy. Many a time the thoughts to questions did spur your male goat reaction to some that deep desires a long red and enhanced cock strain ed out into the Sun.<br />
<br />
John was becoming allured by this sensual display and during the afternoon had actually touched it. Now with his cuddling you maleness rises to the occasion and John fondles the thing willingly.<br />
<br />
&quot; Would you maybe like to come with me to the satyr's glade and talk with Cedius to join me in daily play and delights?&quot; you ask as suddenly John pushes you away.<br />
<br />
&quot;You would wish me to make the same mistake and lose all I have to be as you are now?&quot; asked John rather surprised.<br />
<br />
&quot;We could talk and pleasure together enjoying our friendship!&quot; you beckoned.<br />
<br />
John sits up and looks somewhat disgusted at his friend. You on the other hand stood up on all fours swishing the tail showing eager thoughts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you lost what sense this past two days has brought back the memories and ability to speak as the man you were? It was I as a man that did seek and through dilagent work help make your human thoughts surface! You think for a moment what you've discribed as the way you exsist as this big shaggy goat! The ugly way Cedius and the other Satyr creatures do treat you? The life of being a filthy buck goat and the flies, ticks, and normal associated vermin with infects the wool, skin, and guts. Think, when you saw Sophia and after you began to change were you having happy thoughts then? No, you were fearful of what you'd become and of all that you lost! You consider what our mutual conversation has done to make you what you once was, a rational thinking being!&quot; bade John as he did make you think and remember.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are right my friend, I my life is waste here! Oh but to have sex, sex, sex and continuous sex day in and day out it so becomes just dull! When you crossed the fence I had sensual hopes to enjoy being touched in new and maybe old friendly fashions. I have found from you memories of what I enjoyed as a human and nolonger have at all! I even had some wild and evil hope to use you as a body to replace me and let this fool return if possible to what I was. Oh but even if I returned to the glade with you the Satyress would press me away and twist your thoughts. They as with me would make you feel sensual and then lose both courage and humanity all to once. A slave you'd be as I have become to sensual touch and sexual play till all sense and worthwhile thoughts do fade!&quot; said You to John as tears well up and crying the big buck goat falls to its knees.<br />
<br />
Your eyes peer upward in hopes of seeing John's reaction to this your best passion play yet. His face shows obvious thoughts of compassion and maybe he's weaken enough to actually go to the glade?<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, what do we have here?&quot; says Cedius who has watched you for some time and only now shows his hand. <br />
<br />
John turns and braces for to fight the evil and twisted satyr. You jump to four legged attention and try to act a bit more goaty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy human, I come not alone, you can't run away, or even fight as my herd is here in numbers!&quot; warns Cedius as Skye, Sophia, Minerva, and two yet unknown to you new satyress come and make a circle.<br />
<br />
John turns about looking at the male satyrs the bunch of them poised but having their cocks erect if not for a fight then maybe John's rape. <br />
<br />
&quot;What of you my trusted leader of our nanny herd, I see and do hear you speaking as a man! Yet before me I see the fine big form of a well endowed buck goat. Tell me what was your plan here if any?&quot; asked you Cedius did.<br />
<br />
John looks down at you his face showing a determined look.<br />
<br />
&quot;My Master Cedius, it was my firm desire from the first to bring this convert to you at the glade! I was of hope that you might reconsider my position and term as this male goat for a chance to be again what I was and leave the glade, oh please!&quot; you beg out the wild hope of what John also would have wished for you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting, but what we all just heard moments ago was a weak and silly goat feeling sorry for it's self. So do tell if you can what is your real wish here? Do you want me to make John a buck and send you home as a man? Or pray tell should I send you to market via the Park and make John here a willing replacement as the herd's prime sire? asked Cedius.<br />
<br />
John looked at you and then toward Cedius as Minerva stepped close and started to rub John's crotch.<br />
<br />
A harsh knee up caught Minerva in the jaw sending her sprawling over the ground. &quot;I saw a poor man changed to goat and made a tool of sex for your enjoyments, Cedius! He is now far more learned and can speak due to my help these past two days. Yet I see my trust has been violated in that this goat is been taught to think devious ways. He as so many in my world do play and scheme for one thought only, themselves! You suggested to these lost creatures the betterment of being satyrs and in a constant life of lust and love making. Oh but you world is very transparent, your no better than my world! You Cedius is the high ruler over these lost ones. They do your will and pleasures in foolish blind faith but in the final end they are just stepping stones to your evil plan.&quot; argues John as some of the satyrs begin to look at one another and grumble.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heed him not he is human and does not know the life of being satyrs!&quot; announced a disturbed and anxious Cedius.<br />
<br />
You suddenly can see Cedius in a different light and back away to stand beside your fast friend, John.<br />
<br />
Sophia falls to her hunches bursting into tears. She cries and blubers about her years there as a sexual satyress and the time wasted in her life. Skye too is showing tears of remorse and Cedius sees his powers  taking flight.<br />
<br />
John turns to look at the satyrs standing around and slowly walks toward the outer circle. One by one of the verile strong male satyrss lets him pass and you begin to follow as well.<br />
<br />
Skye, and Sophia begin to argue with Cedius as other satyrs crowd in to listen and give their opinions. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile John and you have walked some distance from the thicket. He motions to you and together you both run for the forbidden fence.<br />
<br />
A lone satyr yells to announce you escape as Cedius looks up.</p>
