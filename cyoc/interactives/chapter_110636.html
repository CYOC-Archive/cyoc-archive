<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"> It&#39;s 2:52 AM on November 1st. A group of five friends in their twenties walked down the street after the conclusion of Halloween party in a moderately inebriated good mood. They had a lot of fun that night and even though the affairs had come to it&#39;s end the joviality it had engendered endured as they made their way back home. They made a bunch of dumb jokes as they went, but given who they were coming and the general mood they shared they got laughs regardless. Little did they know of the peril that they, and the rest of the world would soon face.<br />
<br />
Among their ranks were Steven, Dan, Larry, Sally and Mei. Steven was a lanky 180 centimeter tall thin fellow with reddish brown hair, a long face, a goatee and a was dressed as pirate. Dan was a 170 cm tall black guy with an average build and short cut hair who wore a Starfleet Uniform. Larry was 160cm tall, robust in build, had comparitively long blonde hair, roundish features, tan and decided to come as a Knight with a plastic shield and battleaxe. Sally was 170 centimeters tall, willowy in figure, had long Brown hair and was dressed as a Redcoat. Mei was about 155 centimeters tall Chinese American with a short bob haircut and a was clad in a suit of Stormtrooper Armor that was her pride and joy. <br />
<br />
As they reached the bus station they noticed something. Namely that there was a woman sitting in the shelter with green hair, but then again Halloween had just passed and they saw a few other costumed people out. More importantly she seemed to be crying as she faced into a shelter with her hands in her face. This struck a cord with Steve.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait guys. I&#39;ll gonna see what&#39;s wrong here.&quot; He said as he jogged ahead. The rest of them let him go ahead. As he got closer more details became clear. She seemed to be wearing something that looked like a low cut suit of samurai armor that was much better made than the typical Halloween costume and something seemed off about her head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey miss,&quot; he said &quot;is everything alright?&quot; As he got close to her. When that happened she&#39;d stopped crying and turned to look at him. Then he noticed what was off with her as he stared into a face he&#39;d seen commonly enough, but in animation. The big doe-y eyes, the small mouth and nose, the painted on eyebrows, all of which stylized to reveal the form of an anime girl done in unmoving plastic. Steve had was a bit freaked out by this, he had seen costumes like this a few times before online but he&#39;d never seen one of them up close. He also noticed that she did not seem to have fingernails.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, um, your costumes pretty...&quot; He said as the masked girl eyed him up silently. Then suddenly she ran out and hugged him making some soft cooing sounds. &quot;...Impressive.&quot; This freaked him out a bit, but it seemed harmless. As this happened his friends gave some lighthearted jeers.<br />
<br />
From Mai there was &quot;Looks like captain Steve&#39;s got a new friend!&quot;<br />
<br />
From Sally there was &quot;Senpai Noticed Me!&quot;<br />
<br />
From Larry there was &quot;Oooh My!&quot;<br />
<br />
 Deciding to simply roll with the punches Steve decided to hug back. It did seem to make her feel better.<br />
<br />
After about five seconds Steven was released and the anime girl began skipping while making faint giggling sounds. In response Steve gave a wave. The he noticed something with his hands. It took a second for it to click but he noticed that they&#39;d lost their finger nails and were becoming more slender and delicate. He soon found that this was happening on both his hands and as he pulled up his sleeve he saw that there was something crawling up his arm, leaving creamy, smooth, flawless and synthetic looking skin as it went. He also noticed that his cheap pirate costume seemed to be shifting as well, becoming in general better made and looking more genuine<br />
<br />
&quot;Waaah?!&quot; He said in confusion and growing horror as he walked back and nearly tripped as he found that his boots had begun growing heels. He also felt pressure on his legs building as his pants began to tighten and his body continued it&#39;s shift. His butt began to swell out as did his hips. His figure also shifted, his shoulders got<br />
<br />
&quot;Steve! What&#39;s going on?&quot; Dan said, having paused.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know!&quot; He yelled in reply as a lock of hair fell down into his field of view. He got his hands to his head and found a thick mass of hair. At the same time he felt in his crotch region an odd sucking sensation as his junk pulled into his body and became a simple pink slit. As this happened Steve turned on the Masked Girl &quot;What have you done to me?&quot; He yelled. In response she grabbed him by the shoulders, showing a level of strength that Steve never expected given her thin frame and pull him up close, accelerating the changes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let go of me you crazy anime bitch!&quot; He yelled in a voice which became more feminine. He then felt the increasing presure on his upper chest as a pair of breasts bulged out of his chest and rubbed against her mounds. She giggled a bit, and then brought her head against his in something which was as close as a kiss as her frozen face could deliver.<br />
<br />
Steve then felt the material overcome his face and everything went black. As that happened he (for want of a better word) heard something in his mind, faintly at first. There were no words, but there were emotions and thoughts. First there was an odd giddy satisfaction that resolved itself to reveal subtext. Among these was accomplishment, sexual attraction and pride in a job well done. Then their was a message, which could be sumerized as such...<br />
<br />
&#39;Don&#39;t fight it, Suki. Its much better to be a Kigurumi than a smelly old human.&#39;<br />
<br />
Oddly enough Steve found that (as part of his mind began to insist on defining Steve as) she could respond. &#39;Who, and what are you?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;m Akari silly pants. I&#39;m your friend and we&#39;re here to make the world a better place by fixing all those poor humans.&#39;<br />
<br />
Part of Steve&#39;s mind rebelled against the notion that she was her friend, but a growing part of it began to see her in a different light: Akari was graceful, kind, loving, friendly and funny. Why would anyone not want to be her friend? &#39;Are you alone?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I was. Last time I checked there were hundreds of us, but we&#39;d spread to cities around the world.&#39; Images of Kigurumis like Akari cities from Tokyo to New York to London to Paris to Moscow to Winnipeg flashed before his eyes. &#39;I was sent here and I haven&#39;t seen any other Kigurumi for a week. It&#39;s been lonely for me, but that&#39;s all done!&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Why?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Because I have you now Suki and we&#39;re gonna make a whole bunch of new Kigurumis together!&#39; As that happened the psuedo kiss was broken and she staggered back. There was still some part of her which resisted the notion but that was soon overwhelmed. Her new large green eyes opened while the rest of her new face resolved.  The entire conversation took about five seconds.<br />
<br />
&#39;Sounds like fun!&#39; Captain Suki replied as she gazed upon her old human friends who stood in shocked horror at her in her new glory. She was still clad in a pirate costume, but one of much better quality which was low cut to show off her cleavage, a miniskirt, a lot more lace and a scabbard that carried a cutlass that could either serve as an actual sword or could induce transformation. Her long blue locks had huge volume. &#39;I know that they&#39;ll love it.&#39; She responded and giggled.<br />
<br />
They then charged with the intent to assimilate. Around the world similar stories unfolded as men and women are turned into plastic faced anime girls.</p>
