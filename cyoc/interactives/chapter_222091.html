<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty and Steph had managed to fool the town guards with their terrible “Please help she is sick” schtick, and were walking around the decent sized settlement looking for someone who might be able to help them.  Luckily, Steph saw a sign that proclaimed “Brisella’s Alchemical Concoctions and Medicines”.  He grabbed Ty by the shoulder, guiding him over to the shop, a little too eagerly for Ty’s care but appreciated nonetheless.  <br />
<br />
Steph haphazardly swung open the door, a bell jingling to alert the owner as the two entered the medicinal and herbal smelling shop.  There was a counter, though unfortunately no one was behind it.  Steph walked up and rang the bell laying on the counter.  There came a commotion from the back of the shop, and a female voice mumbled incoherently.  From behind the counter a door opened and out stepped an Elven woman, tanned skin, bright green eyes, long braided red hair, and a slim body dressed in a smart looking robe.  She wore thick rimmed glasses that subtly enlarged her eyes.  She brushed a stray strand of hair out of her face and took stock of her customers.  There was a heavy silence as she stared at the two, before she huffed and pointed to the right side of the store, to a room labeled “Examination”.  <br />
<br />
“You two, in there now.  I’ve never seen someone so transformed before, even under all those rags.  Disrobe and await my arrival.”<br />
<br />
Steph made to speak but she held up a hand.  “No buts, in there now.”  Steph shrugged and the two friends entered the large examination space.  Inside was a table, several chairs, and a workbench with a multitude of tool, oils, potions and other such things as Ty and Steph could only guess.  From another door the elf entered, now in something more akin to medieval looking surgeon’s outfit.  “The small one, you first.  Undress and on sit on the table.”  Steph stepped in front of her, getting a little angry at their treatment.<br />
<br />
“Now hold on their miss, I appreciate you looking us over, but shouldn’t we at least introduce ourselves?”<br />
<br />
Her brow furrowed and she sighed.  “Fine.  I am Alzamechia, or Alza, apprentice to the great alchemist Brisella.  She is out on very important business at the moment, which makes me the only competent person in this town to perform an examination on you two…”. She eyed the two transformed strangers.  “That… is what you wanted, right?  Help with however you have been transformed?”  She looked up sternly at the orc woman.<br />
<br />
Steph tried to laugh it off, realizing that the woman was just being serious about her job.  “Y-yeah, that’s more or less correct.  I’m Steph, and this here is my buddy Ty.  We got caught by some goblins and were unfortunately transformed quite a bit.  Without getting too into detail, I was hoping you could solve some of my friend’s issues, or at least allow her to talk.”  The elf’s eyebrows raised, her interest rising.  <br />
<br />
“Goblin transformation you say.  Interesting…. Well, let’s take a look miss Ty.”  Ty quickly undressed, embarrassed to be seen like he was by another person, although the medical setting helped put him a little at ease.  The elf’s eyes went wide at the sight of the butt monster before her.  Her cheeks became a flushed as she did a simple once over of Ty’s body.  Not asking for permission, she began to poke, prod and spread the various regions of Ty’s body, ooh-ing and aah-ing as she did so.  “Curious,” she said, “Subject is not breathing, and yet they live.  Potent alchemy like this isn’t cheap, and bizarre for a simple goblin to have.”  She prodded Ty’s facial ass, spreading his asshole apart to get a look it, then prodded his upper pussy before gently inserting a finger into it.  “Extra genitalia are responsive.  Testing response.”  She began to slowly tease and finger the upper cunt, while her spare hand gently rubbed his upper shaft.  As she did so, Steph noticed a rising bulge in the elf woman’s pants, one that only barely contained by her clothing.  After a bit, Ty came, upper pussy clenching weakly as he spilled all over the table.  <br />
<br />
Alza withdrew her hands and spent a moment too long looking at them before going over to a wash basin and rinsing her hands off.  She then returned with a potion bottle.  She poured some onto a rag and rubbed it on Ty’s butt-head.  The clear liquid quickly turned a dark shade of purple.  “As I feared.  I transformation this severe is hard to reverse.  The only thing that could be done would be to affect the sufferer with a transformation as potent as the previous and hope it is more benign than the previous.”<br />
<br />
Steph looked at her quizzically, unsure what to make of it.  “So, does that mean we would have to change her again?  Seems to kind of defeat the point of getting her speaking again.”<br />
<br />
The elf turned on Steph, a wicked grin plastered over her face.  Below, her fat cock twitched excitedly.  “Not at all!  I have-I have a special something I have been wanting to test for a while now.  It might just be the thing to help out your friend there.  You see, the frog/skin condition I can fix easily enough.  Just need to change her base genus with a new overlay, simple really.  The butt of hers, the head that is… well, we’ll have to apply an as strong or stronger potion to the affected area.”  She slinked back into the other doorway, where the sounds of rustling anfd bottles clinking could be heard.  She returned shortly, out of breath and red of face, but still smiling.  She held a potion bottle up to Steph’s face.  It was amber colored, and faintly glowing.  “This!  This is my latest creation, something that will get me recognized at the academy and out of this stuff office!”<br />
<br />
“Well, that’s great!  Let’s do it!”  Steph said enthusiastically.  <br />
<br />
The elf held up a hand to the orc.  “Not so fast.  This is precious material here. Even though I would love to test it out, the ingredients needed to make it were quite expensive.  So, unfortunately, I would need to make sure in case there is an error that I am able to start my research again.  Do you have the ability to pay?”  <br />
<br />
Steph, a little taken aback, pondered for a minute.  He didn’t have any money in this world, but he did have something he thought might interest the alchemist.  He pulled the several goblin made potions from his pack and showed them to Alza.  Her jaw dropped open.<br />
<br />
“Th-those are the same caliber of potion used on your friend, yes?”, she asked hurriedly.  Steph nodded smugly.  She swiped them immediately and stashed them on the table.  “Ok, payment enough.  First, lets fix your friend’s skin condition.”  She produced another potion, this one a shimmering ochre.  She paused for a moment, considering where to give a potion to such a creature, and settled for Ty’s upper anus.  Ty didn’t resist as he felt the potion rapidly take effect.  His webbed hands and feet became normal humanoid hands again, and his skin began to dry out as its coloration became darker.  Shade after shade it fell until it was a pleasing caramel color.  The elf smirked, noting that the potion had been based on her genes and was highly effective, meaning Ty was now, at least genetically, an elf again.<br />
<br />
“Now for the real test,” she said as she poured half the amber potion into another bottle, readying it for insertion into Ty.  The effect was drastic, as it…</p>
