<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With breakfast finished Jenny left to shower and get dressed. Jeff couldn’t help but notice that she went into the master bedroom to do so. Apparently that was where she had slept last night. Jeff did manage to ascertain that the sofa bed was unused, confirming his worst nightmare. He was not naive enough to imagine that his father had shared a bed with the blonde beauty and remained hands off.<br />
<br />
Before Jeff could escape to his room he was once more cornered by his father and instructed to help Irene to clean up the breakfast dishes. Reluctantly he helped his 13 year old mother while his father joined Jenny in the master bedroom. <br />
<br />
Finally with the kitchen cleaned up Jeff returned to his room and booted up his computer. It took him just several minutes to get the Chronivac app going. He bought up the stats pages for the people he could change. Initially he was perplexed. His own stats were there, as were Irene’s but those for Jenny and his father were absent. However a check with the help function made him realise what was wrong. The master bedroom was too far away from his own. The Chronivac had a guaranteed range of only 20 feet. Interesting  when he had changed his Mom and Jenny last night they must have been right at that limit.<br />
<br />
He read his own stats<br />
<br />
Name: Jeffrey Hansen<br />
Age: 16<br />
Gender: Male<br />
Height: 5&#39;10&quot;<br />
Hair Colour/Style: Brown/Short<br />
Eye Colour: Brown<br />
Weight: 176 pounds<br />
Build: Slim<br />
Social Status: Loner<br />
Sexual Preference: Straight<br />
Penis size: 6 inches<br />
Occupation: None<br />
Education: High school student<br />
<br />
The first thing he did was to change his name to Jeff. He didn’t like being called Jeffrey. The other changes he made were to his Social status changing that to &quot;Popular&quot; and changing his penis size to 8 inches. He didn’t notice that his own profile lacked the category “Relationship status”<br />
<br />
Satisfied with those changes he pressed the button to execute. He felt all warm for about 5 seconds, then everything returned to normal. <br />
He was tempted to check out his new gear but decided first to fix his Mom.<br />
<br />
He looked at her stats. As far as he could tell they were as he had left them last night. He did not realise that the Chronivac only exhibited age appropriate data on this main page. Since Jeff had down-graded his mother’s age the categories of &quot;Relationship status&quot; and &quot;Sexual preferences&quot; were missing<br />
<br />
Name: Irene Hansen<br />
Age: 13 <br />
Gender: Female<br />
Hair Colour/style: Brunette shoulder length<br />
Eye Colour: Hazel<br />
Weight: 125 pounds<br />
Height: 5’3<br />
Build: Curvy/Hourglass<br />
Social Status: Popular<br />
Bust size: C-Cup<br />
Occupation: Student<br />
Education: Grade 8<br />
<br />
He set about restoring her profile as well as he could remember, including adding a couple of tweaks he hoped she would appreciate<br />
<br />
Name: Irene Hansen<br />
Age: 40 (instead of her actual 45) <br />
Gender: Female<br />
Hair Colour/style: Brunette shoulder length<br />
Eye Colour: Hazel<br />
Weight: 120 pounds (Thinking she would appreciate losing a little weight)<br />
Build: Hourglass<br />
Social Status: Popular<br />
Bust size: C-Cup<br />
Occupation: Physiotherapist (Even though his Mom hadn’t worked as a physio in years)<br />
Education: University<br />
<br />
Satisfied with those changes Jeff hit the execute button. Then leaving the computer running went about checking whether the changes had come into effect. Starting with his penis size. The response to a little stimulation was very satisfying. He was sure that the soon to be 25 year old Jenny would be pleased with the result. <br />
<br />
He also needed to check that his Mom’s changes had worked and think of a way to drawer Jenny close enough to his own room to get the Chronivac to work on her.<br />
<br />
The first was easy. Whilst he was measuring his erect penis length with a ruler (it was 8 inches!) there was a knock on his door and his Mom’s mature voice asked ‘Jeff, can you lend me a bit of muscle’<br />
<br />
Pleased that she had called him “Jeff” and not “Jeffrey”, Jeff tucked away his manhood and opened his door. Sure enough his mother was restored to adulthood, looking slightly less world weary than she had a day earlier.<br />
<br />
‘Sorry to bother you Jeff, but I need you to help move furniture. There is a lot we need to get done if the party tonight is going to be a success’<br />
<br />
‘Sure. No problem. Any help you need. Lead the way’<br />
<br />
‘Well we need to first clear a space out in the shed, so we can move your father’s office stuff out there. Then I’d appreciate a hand cleaning the house. JJ and Jennifer are going to be busy with other things so until Becky arrives it up to us’<br />
<br />
He was following his Mom to the kitchen door when Jenny came out of his parent’s room. She looked gorgeous in a pale lavender dress that showed off every curve of her body. She was made up perfectly and looked a million dollars, especially with the beautiful smile her face had been wearing all morning.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s Mom spoke what Jeff was thinking ‘Wow Jennifer! You look exquisite! Oh I’m so happy for you and JJ!’ Well maybe Jeff wasn’t thinking the last bit.<br />
<br />
‘Why thanks Irene. I was saving this for Christie’s wedding but occasions can’t get any more special than today. So why not!’<br />
<br />
‘Um Jenny, Can I borrow you for a few minutes? There is something I need to show you in my room’ Jeff needed to entice Jenny within range of the Chronivac<br />
<br />
‘Oh Jeff! Can’t it wait? There is so much I need to do today. But most importantly I need to pick up Becky and tell her the news’ <br />
<br />
‘Yes Jeff. Jenny is out of bounds for today. We have a lot on our plates. We’ll drop Becky back once we’ve told her the news. Then I’m taking Jennifer ring shopping. Don’t count on us being much help with the cleaning up. I’m beginning to wish we had put off the gathering for a few days’ Jeff hadn’t noticed his father had also come out of the room, wearing his best suit.<br />
<br />
‘Oh big brother, of course we’ll get the house looking spotless for you. Between myself, Jeff and Becky everything is under control. I’ve already been in contact with my friend Trish. She is more than willing to do the catering even though it&#39;s only short notice. Evidently she had a cancellation for tonight. I know from experience that she is really good’ Jeff realised that in this reality his Mom and Dad were now brother and sister<br />
<br />
‘Okay. In that case we’ll be off. Ring me if any difficulties arise’ said Jeff’s father, as he jingled his keys.<br />
<br />
Then they were gone. Jeff realised it might be difficult to get Jenny changed by the Chronivac today.</p>
