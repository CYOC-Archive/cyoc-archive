<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There were very few Animalians who regret being converted. Most of them were those who didn&#39;t choose to be changed. But they had come to accept and embrace their new Animalian lives. Even Mary Piper was more comfortable with her life now that she wasn&#39;t a skulking rat creature living in the sewers. Granted, in the unlikely event that Horizon Labs ever discovered a way to make her human again, she&#39;d still take it. But now that her family was more organized and spread out and Jack was a more loving and compassionate husband, she found life as a rat Animalian not as unbearable as it had been before.<br />
<br />
Of course, there were a few Animalians who had converted for a rather silly reason and regretted it afterwards. Case in point was Marvin West and Stuart Thomasson. The two college boys were at UNLV when Tiffany Chappelle and her sister/uplifted pet Princess enrolled. To say they were among the most noticeable freshmen that year would be an understatement. Not only were they humanoid poodles, but they had incredibly sexy bodies as well. There was also a cowgirl and a snake lady, but Marvin and Stuart had their eyes set on the Chappelle sisters.<br />
<br />
Both Marvin and Stuart wanted to court those girls. Though anything serious would require conversion and their masculine pride was too strong to consider becoming French Poodles. Though it took them quite a while to actually get converted themselves as there didn&#39;t seem good enough reason to travel to Lyre for it. The Summer Events seemed like a good occasion and the two frat boys drove over. They had a little bit to drink, mostly to steel their nerves, but at least they weren&#39;t sloshed enough to ask for what they didn&#39;t want. Marvin became a Welsh Corgi because they were intelligent, adorable, and irresistible chick magnets. Stuart became a Great Dane because he was a big fan of Scooby-Doo when he was a kid.<br />
<br />
Imagine their chagrin when they found out that Tiffany already had a boyfriend, a Rottweiler no less. That wasn&#39;t to say that Princess wasn&#39;t beautiful, charming, and sexy herself, but the two guys had been fantasying about Tiffany more often. Princess was still single and there wasn&#39;t much difference between the two other than Princess&#39;s fur was white while Tiffany&#39;s was golden. Even so, the news that one of the babes they had been setting eyes on was already taken was a big blow to Marvin and Stuart&#39;s egos. They probably wouldn&#39;t be trying to pursue Princess until they&#39;ve recovered.<br />
<br />
Trying to get drunk at the Meat Market was probably not the best way to do that, but Marvin and Stuart were committed to trying. Of course, the bigger challenge was that a dog&#39;s tongue was as receptive to alcoholic drinks as a human tongue, but the two were making an effort anyways.<br />
<br />
Eventually, a deep voice said, &quot;Don&#39;t you two think you&#39;re overdoing it a bit?&quot; Marvin and Stuart turned to see a rather large pair of Animalians. They apparently worked here considering they were wearing tight pants but no shirts. One of them was a particularly shaggy wolf while the other was a larger-than-average zebra. The two of them were pretty muscular, even by Animalian standards of their species.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re not into other guys,&quot; said Marvin in a sour tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Neither are we,&quot; said the wolf with the deep voice, &quot;In fact, we&#39;re into the ladies a little too much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good for you, go entertain them,&quot; said Stuart annoyed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Getting drunk isn&#39;t going to help you get that girl&#39;s sister,&quot; said the zebra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who told you?&quot; snapped Stuart.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s been in the grapevine for a while,&quot; said the wolf, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, they haven&#39;t been telling which girl you had been watching before learning she&#39;s taken.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So we&#39;re Animalia&#39;s new laughingstocks, great,&quot; said Marvin dourly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you boys need some perspective on what it&#39;s like to really be a loser,&quot; said the wolf.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;re the expert?&quot; asked Marvin sarcastically.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve had some experience,&quot; said the wolf before extending a hand, &quot;Marvin Landsberg.&quot;<br />
<br />
The zebra extended his hand and said, &quot;Stuart Rhodes.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the two frat dogs shook hands, Stuart T. said, &quot;Wait, aren&#39;t you two the ones who are being treated for... What was it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hypersexuality,&quot; said Stuart R., &quot;Yeah, becoming young Animalians did make us a bit more loose than usual.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The scientists think that part of the reason for that has something to do with extra hormones and testosterone,&quot; said Marvin L., &quot;Personally, I think that since we had rotten lives before, we subconsciously think we&#39;re owed better ones now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They couldn&#39;t have been that bad,&quot; said Marvin W.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kid, you don&#39;t know what it was like to be different back in the 50&#39;s,&quot; said Marvin L.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Marvin and Stuart didn&#39;t know each other before they had come to Lyre to be treated. Though the reasons they came to be treated were clear enough. Marvin&#39;s hypertrichosis gave him a copious amount of body and facial hair, almost to the point of being a pelt. As such, like many people with &#39;werewolf syndrome&#39;, he had spent many years working in a circus sideshow. Of course, there wasn&#39;t much work outside of a circus for him. Many people couldn&#39;t see past his hairy exterior, even if he shaved. Though shaving was only a temporary solution as the hair did grow back and the stubble being in places where it shouldn&#39;t be was hard to ignore. Of course, most of that hair had turned grey now.<br />
<br />
Stuart&#39;s somewhat vacant stare and flat face made him an obvious case of Down syndrome. The fact that he was still alive when he was born in the 1930&#39;s was quite remarkable in and of itself. It was mainly because of how he wasn&#39;t an only child. He had a younger sister who was pretty responsible even at a young age. There had been plenty of kids that made fun of Lavender for having to take care of her big, dumb brother. But Lavender had been a very patient and loving soul and had continued to look after her brother long after their parents couldn&#39;t. If it weren&#39;t for Lavender, Stuart wouldn&#39;t have been able to live to his current age. When Lavender heard about Animalia&#39;s miraculous cure-all, she put together as much money as she could to send Stuart there. She filled out the forms for him since he was not the best at writing. She put down his selected animal as &#39;zebra&#39; since he always liked seeing the zebras at the zoo.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Marvin wanted to be converted in a particular way. Maybe it was because of his yearning for youth or we wanted to prove he was still manly, but he wanted to converted by sex. Though he was far from a virgin. There were quite a few women who found his excess hair exotic and sexy, though he hasn&#39;t received much attention in that regard for several years. And Animalia had plenty of she-wolves to spare. The she-wolf attending to him, a tan-furred buxom beauty named Nadie, wasn&#39;t seeking a mate at the moment was happy to provide Marvin with what he needed to transform.<br />
<br />
&quot;Out of curiosity, why a wolf?&quot; asked Nadie as she was stripping, &quot;You don&#39;t have to go with what everyone calls you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, maybe if I&#39;m a wolf full-time, people will stop thinking of me as a werewolf,&quot; said Marvin before pointing at a scar on his arm, &quot;A creep shot me with a silver slug. It wasn&#39;t serious, but I&#39;m fed up with people thinking I&#39;m a dangerous monster.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As opposed to a handsome, sexy monster?&quot; crooned Nadie as she stepped out of the last of her clothing.<br />
<br />
Marvin grinned and said, &quot;I warn you, I was quite a beast in my day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m counting on it,&quot; said Nadie before French-kissing Marvin, getting plenty of her tongue and saliva in her mouth. She had taken the counter-vaccine so she was quite infectious now.<br />
<br />
The changes took longer to be noticeable with Marvin, considering he was already covered in hair. But the way his fingernails were darkening and sharpening into claws were a good indication of his transformation. His bare feet were growing longer as they reshaped into digitigrade paws. Marvin gave a small growl as he could feel his teeth sharpening, his ears becoming pointed. He now looked more like a wolf-man than he had before.<br />
<br />
Before long, Marvin reached down and grabbed Nadie&#39;s breasts with his larger hands. Nadie gave a squeak before moaning as Marvin latched onto one, getting another dose of the Animalian virus. His transformation seemed to speed up, his shirt and pants, not unlike Talbot&#39;s, were straining under the growing muscles building up. The back of his pants burst as a new tail grew out. The grey in his fur was rejuvenating to a rich brown. Marvin gave a few snarls as his face was pushed out into a wolf&#39;s muzzle. Nadie watched with fascination as the big wolf was tearing out of the smaller man&#39;s clothes. He was incredibly muscular, much more than most people get when they first convert without working to build up their muscles. He was also hairier than the usual wolf, actually having a beard distinguishable by its darker color. He also had a larger patch of thicker, darker fur that covered his chest and went down to his crotch, which was barely being covered by his shredding underpants. Eventually, the elastic snapped and Marvin&#39;s new wolfhood burst out. He was definitely very well-endowed, his red hot poker at least 7 inches long if not 7 1/2.<br />
<br />
Nadie licked her lips and said, &quot;Well, that&#39;s quite a lot of beast.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the beast is hungry,&quot; said Marvin with a deep seductive growl. With little effort, he flipped Nadie over, putting her on the ground on all fours, with her inviting ass pointed towards him. Marvin clutched at his dick and prepared to spear Nadie with it.<br />
<br />
Just then, the door opened and someone said, &quot;Is this where I...oops.&quot; Standing in the door was a male zebra Animalian, though this one looked to be about as big as a farmhorse. He was incredibly buff, his white fur and black stripes helping to highlight the contours of his muscles. He was actually a little taller than Marvin&#39;s new height. And quite noticeably, he had a pretty large pair of testicles that were hanging under a bulging sheathe.<br />
<br />
Marvin gave the zebra an annoyed look and asked, &quot;Stuart, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah,&quot; said Stuart a little embarrassed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn&#39;t anyone tell you to knock before entering?&quot; asked Marvin.<br />
<br />
&quot;The door wasn&#39;t locked,&quot; said Stuart.<br />
<br />
&quot;My bad,&quot; said Nadie, &quot;I guess I forgot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stuart looked down at the sexy naked she-wolf. Unsurprisingly, his cock emerged from his sheath at that. It stretched out to an incredible length, being one foot and three inches long and thick as a soda can. Stuart looked more embarrassed and said, &quot;Sorry, I didn&#39;t meant that. I&#39;ll go now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a moment,&quot; said Nadie, looking with interest at the zebra stallion, &quot;I think there&#39;s room here for one more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously?&quot; growled Marvin, &quot;I&#39;m just about to stick my dick in you and you want the next guy who walks in instead?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have two ends, you know,&quot; said Nadie, &quot;You can stay back there while Stripes can take my mouth.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marvin gave a growl of irritation before saying, &quot;You&#39;re lucky I&#39;m too horny to care right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do you say, stud?&quot; asked Nadie, &quot;Want me to take care of that stiff problem?&quot;<br />
<br />
Stuart&#39;s ears flickered and he snorted, smelling the musk Nadie was giving off. He might have been simple-minded before, but he&#39;d be really stupid to pass this off. &quot;Well, unless there&#39;s a zebra mare around, I need something to help with this,&quot; he said, grasping his cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the spirit,&quot; said Nadie as Stuart walked forward. She grasped his cock and gave it a long lick. Stuart shuddered as she licked his shaft. Then Nadie opened her mouth as wide as she could to take it past her lips. Marvin took that as his cue to put his dick past her other lips. Nadie groaned loudly as the two hunks started pounding at her from either end.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
&quot;That was probably the first sign that we had hypersexuality,&quot; said Stuart R. as he and Marvin finished recounting their threesome with Nadie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but she&#39;s a good fuck though,&quot; said Marvin L.<br />
<br />
The other Marvin and Stuart looked like they wanted to tear their ears off and wash them thoroughly. &quot;You know, you didn&#39;t have to give <i>that</i> much detail,&quot; said Stuart T.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where would the fun in that be?&quot; asked Stuart R.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m doubtful Princess would be willing to have a threesome with us,&quot; said Marvin W.<br />
<br />
&quot;You never know until you ask,&quot; said Marvin L.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what was the point of this story again?&quot; asked Stuart T.<br />
<br />
&quot;That you two had a better start than we did and you shouldn&#39;t think you did something dumb,&quot; said Stuart R., &quot;I really owe Lavender a lot for bringing me here and everything else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is she an Animalian now too?&quot; asked Stuart T.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet,&quot; said Stuart R., &quot;She&#39;s still trying to make up her mind about what she wants to be. I&#39;d like her to be a zebra too, but she&#39;s not sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So only one of you guys might get that poodle. There are still a lot of bitches out there waiting for you. Just enjoy your life,&quot; said Marvin L. before he and Stuart R. walked away.<br />
<br />
There was a long pause after they left before Marvin W. said, &quot;Hey, Stuart?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Marvin?&quot; asked Stuart T.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s never become as crazy as those two,&quot; said Marvin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amen to that,&quot; said Stuart.</p>
