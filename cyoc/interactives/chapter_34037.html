<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marie thinks about what they should do next. A part of her is curious as to what it would feel like if she were to let Sean mount her. If she were to regain her humanity, she wondered if she'd regret not trying such an action out even once.<br />
<br />
Like many girls, Marie had loved horses when she was little. She'd imagined running with them not as her human self but as one of them on one occasion or two. This however was before she'd begun to grow into a young woman and began to grow interested in pleasures only puberty can bring.<br />
<br />
Never did Marie imagine that she'd stand as a donkey headed for a farm after a harrowing escape from life as a slave.<br />
<br />
Having escaped and regained her human senses and wits, Marie was alone with a male that she knew was ready, willing and able.<br />
<br />
Truth be told, Marie was a virgin. She never imagined that she'd have the opportunity to have a donkey taken by a stranger after an island had turned both into donkeys.<br />
<br />
Marie's mother had always told her to seize opportunities when and if they presented themselves. This opportunity however was unlikely what Marie's mother had in mind.<br />
<br />
Sean wasn't giving it the same thought Marie was. He was on top of her before she realized it. H9is weight surprised Marie, as did her ability to carry him.<br />
<br />
Marie bucked, but Sean relented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Goddamn it Sean, what are doing?&quot; Marie cried.<br />
<br />
Sean brayed.<br />
<br />
Marie bucked harder but was finding it difficult to resist. She wanted to know how it would feel to let go. However, her sense of self-preservation kicked in. She'd already lost her humanity with one bad decision. Despite the pleasure Sean offered the both of them, Marie wasn't willing to risk it.<br />
<br />
Going against everything hormones were telling her, Marie bucked Sean as hard as he could. That seemed to bring Sean to his senses as her dismounted.<br />
<br />
Marie turned around to see Sean blinking. She looked between his legs to see Sean's donkey hood still erect and in full view.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you stop me?&quot; Sean asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dammit Sean, I want to let you but we can't risk it,&quot; Marie said.<br />
<br />
Marie's body was saying otherwise. She was fighting to get the words out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you want it,&quot; Sean said. &quot;You say you don't but you're making all the motions that say you do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie stomped the ground. &quot;Of course I want it. Dammit, I never was like this before. I was always shy! Now, it's all I can think about! It's driving me mad. What the hell did these perverted freaks do to us?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean huffed. &quot;I think they want us to give in so we become stupid and are easier to control.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sean, if that's what you want, then when we get to a farm, you can give in with one of the horses there,&quot; Marie said. &quot;I won't blame you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I won't do that!&quot; Sean said. &quot;They didn't used to be human! They're just dumb animals!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we'll be the same thing if we give in!&quot; Marie said.<br />
<br />
Sean nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then let's get help before it's too late,&quot; Sean said. &quot;I'm sorry about what I did.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie nodded. The reality of their situation was begining to sink in. She knew that her will couldn't hold out forever. She didn't want to live out her life as a donkey but knew that if they or someone else couldn't find a cure then she'd have little choice. Never before had Marie felt so vulnerable. At the moment, she was at the mercy of anyone they ran into. If they had no interest in finding a cure, Marie and Sean were screwed. Even if they could still speak, she knew that they'd never be able to go back to their lives in their current forms. While there were worse fates, Marie knew that she'd probably be able to count them on a single hand if her humanity was restored.<br />
<br />
&quot;What if we're stuck this way?&quot; Sean asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want to think about that,&quot; Marie said. &quot;Sean, I -- I can't be a donkey, it's not who I am! I'd rather then die then be stuck like this to or end up becoming a donkey on the inside.&quot;<br />
<br />
Among Marie's biggest fears was becoming a beast or monster and being one for so long or being brainwashed into thinking and acting like one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God, what I have to myself?&quot; Marie cried.<br />
<br />
Marie more then anything wanted this to be a dream that she could wake up from. She felt her control slipping at the thought that she might be trapped this way and soon would only care about sex or would only be interested in standing around all day doing nothing all while being foul smelling and filthy.<br />
<br />
Feeling her legs buckle, Marie lay down and closed her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, don't make me live like that,&quot; Marie said. &quot;Let me die as the who I am. I don't want people to remember me as a donkey or to be one on the inside.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean apporched Marie and lay beside her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't just kill you!&quot; Sean said. &quot;Don't give up! If you give up then you're letting them win!&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie opened her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I -- I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, let's find help,&quot; Sean said. &quot;We *will* find help not just for us but for the others.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie and Sean stood up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess we'd better get going,&quot; Marie said.<br />
<br />
Marie could only hope that she would find help. For now, she opted not to think of the alternative as a way to keep her going.</p>
