<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As breakfast slowly wound down, Jensen again checked around the room. Kaylee was trying to assure Bart and Jenny that it wasn't their fault. The gem twins all looked down, which given Jenny and Bart's guilt for what they had done had to be related to what had happened to Fox and Elise, the mothers of their friends. Amy looked as serene as she always did, while Zelipe looked as innocent as he always did. The teens seemed grateful that they wouldn't have lessons today.<br />
<br />
He also noticed that Gillian's and Mother Glen's plates had been left untouched.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sunny, Luna, before you rejoin the group going to work the day-shift with Fran, why don't you take Gillian and Mother Glen's food to them,&quot; Jensen instructed, &quot;No need for them to miss breakfast.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Alpha,&quot; Sunny and Luna answered with a slight nod, and as the group began to break up, they took the plates and went out the door that Mother Glen and Gillian had earlier taken Gillie through.<br />
<br />
As Jensen then made his way toward the door, he met Penny and Kirk at the door, with Umeko pushing Penny's wheelchair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you have any trouble getting home?&quot; Jensen asked, &quot;I'm sure there are a couple that will be willing to help if you need it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll be fine,&quot; Penny spoke, &quot;I have Kirk and I have my grandma, and Umeko has volunteered to serve Yamato's &quot;penance&quot; until he can move again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Jensen nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would ask if I would be allowed to talk with Gary for a bit,&quot; Penny spoke to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't see a problem with it, but when it comes to medical matters, that is where even I am outranked,&quot; Jensen told Penny.<br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
1682<br />
<br />
&quot;Marie!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Marie! Wait up!&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie finally paused to let the felman female catch up with her. Katherine had come running forward and came up to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've been chasing you over half the Vatican,&quot; Katherine gasped for breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would have thought you would have found something more relaxing then to follow me around,&quot; Marie answered.<br />
<br />
Katherine did her best to hide a frown.<br />
<br />
&quot;I heard about Father Gabriel,&quot; Katherine spoke, &quot;I just wanted to tell you I was sorry... but you've been hard to keep track of.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn't kill him,&quot; Marie answered with a sniffle, &quot;he was just old... and apparently God needed him more then I did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, but I also know you love him like a father,&quot; Katherine answered, &quot;losing some one close is always hard. My mom cried for weeks when her sister died. Losing my Aunt made me sad too, but she was always busy with something so I didn't know her all that much.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie didn't answer right away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, I came to see if you needed any help,&quot; Katherine told her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Marie asked back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because that's what friends do,&quot; Katherine answered, &quot;they're with each other through thick and thin. For richer or poorer, in sickness and in health...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're confusing friendship with marriage vows,&quot; Marie answered, &quot;and we're BOTH female, and even if we weren't... we've both taken vows of chastity to serve the church.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The concept is the same,&quot; Katherine answered, &quot;true friends are always there for one another. No matter what. If you know someone that says they're a friend, but only offers it when it suits them... or never offers to sacrifice their own happiness to help their &quot;friend&quot;, then that person isn't a true friend to begin with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for the advice, but I don't need any help,&quot; Marie answered.<br />
<br />
And with that Marie began walking again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, Marie,&quot; Katherine actually sniffled, &quot;You need a friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is she being so mean?&quot; Cassandra sniffled, &quot;Marie's supposed to be the hero.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Every hero has their flaw,&quot; Marie answered, &quot;and Marie wasn't trying to be mean to anyone. She was actually kinder to Katherine then most others. Marie, however, between losing her god-father and having to hide from most, she honestly feared that if she let too many in, they would be harmed by the life she lead. Marie did manage to avoid being involved in most of the things that history has judged the Catholic church and the Inquisition to be over-zealous on, but taking over where Father Gabriel had &quot;left off&quot; in dealing with assassins, spies, the undead, those who truly had prove to be threats to the church, she feared that Katherine would get hurt if she let the felman in...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what about the witches?&quot; Betty asked, &quot;at the time they're still technically &quot;innocent&quot;, that they haven't turned evil and insane yet, and Marie's made friends with them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember that when they first met as children, and obviously in their dreams, the witches let a pretty big ball drop when they asked if Mutt was Marie's familiar. Marie was able to figure out that they were witches because of that, and since Gabriel had told her that not every witch was bad, Marie had assumed that the &quot;witchlings&quot; were good and that their powers would protect them from the forces of evil that Marie faced.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She still hasn't realized that the witches weren't really offering friendship and were traveling down a very dark path,&quot; Lawrence began with a sigh, &quot;hasn't she?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's still in the future,&quot; Marie nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Katherine and Marie should still be friends,&quot; Lilly and Cassandra said in agreement, although since they weren't like the Betas, picking out what they had said was rather difficult.<br />
<br />
&quot;Friendship isn't the easiest thing to forge,&quot; Marie sighed.<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Jensen found things rather quiet as he made his way into the medical wing. The Glens and the Yorks had left for one of the guest rooms, but Anne, Beatrice, Wanda's brother, Tad, were helping Fran, Joy, and Ingrid with the work of taking care of the wounded Pride and Pack members. He did make sure to note that there was a platter of meat there for those on &quot;medical duty&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;How are things progressing?&quot; Jensen asked as he made his way in.<br />
<br />
His arrival did cause some heads to turn, but he had long been used to that.<br />
<br />
&quot;As fine as can be, Alpha-Jensen,&quot; Fran turned, &quot;We're in no danger of losing anyone, but it will be awhile before any real progress can be visible.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen slowly nodded, &quot;Many of the others will be in as the day progresses and will provide you with any additional hands you may need, even if it's only bringing supplies to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fran slowly nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Also, Gillie is here, and will likely be down sometime to check on the pride members here, though she is at the moment having a bit of a family reunion,&quot; Jensen told her.<br />
<br />
Fran again nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;And in the meantime,&quot; Jensen then stepped aside to let Umeko push Penny's wheelchair in, &quot;Penny wishes to speak with Gary about something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It'll be alright, so long as its quick,&quot; Fran replied.<br />
<br />
Penny's arrival turned even more heads, as if the Pride didn't expect her to be out and about.<br />
<br />
&quot;Penny! What are you doing out?&quot; Bernie asked Umeko pushed her wheelchair down the isle between the medical beds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kirk and I had come with my grandma and parents,&quot; Penny answered, &quot;My mobility may be reduced a bit, but I'm not completely immobile.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe we ought to have races once we're all healthy enough to go,&quot; lioness Megan gave a slight chuckle, &quot;given that it appears we're all going to be in in wheelchairs for awhile.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure Gillie's really gonna like that,&quot; Penny shook her head, &quot;traffic stopped as fourteen leomen roll down Main Street.&quot;<br />
<br />
The beige/brown lioness managed a slight shrug.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll try to visit with everyone, but right now I need to talk with Gary about something,&quot; Penny then spoke quickly as Umeko rolled her wheelchair up to the bed that Gary was on.</p>
