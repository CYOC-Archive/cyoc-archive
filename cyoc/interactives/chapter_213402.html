<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike awoke to the sound of running water.  It seemed like his wife had already entered the shower and was getting ready for work.  Mike hurriedly scanned the room to make sure she was really in there before pulling back his boxers.  He smiled, sure enough, he had really exchanged cock and balls with his own son, Jeff.  The small, hairless appendage was stiff with morning wood.  Part of Mike wanted to rub one out right then and there but looking at the time, he opted to start getting dressed instead.  He recalled how lucky he was last night that his wife wanted to go to sleep early.  Even better that she didn’t wake him up so they could shower together this morning.  She must have been in a rush. <br />
<br />
Mike got dressed and started to get some eggs ready for breakfast.  Despite his steady job as the manager at an insurance agency, he was more of a homebody than his wife who worked as marketing executive.  Mike was able to snag a few work from home opportunities recently, but the days where he was allowed to work remotely had been limited as things opened up again post-pandemic.  Though on his days home, he was content being the one to cook while while his wife brought home the real bacon. <br />
<br />
*Yawn* “Good morning dad.”  Jeff said before pouring himself some juice and taking a seat at the table.  He was already wearing a T-shirt for school but seemed to still be in the same bagging sweatpants he must have slept in the night before.  Mike was a tad disappointed that Jeff didn’t opt for something to show off a bit more.<br />
<br />
“I bet I know why you still seem so tired…” Mike winked.<br />
<br />
Jeff choked on his orange juice. “Was I really THAT loud last night?!”<br />
<br />
“Let’s just say you’re lucky your mother is a heavy sleeper.”  Mike chuckled. <br />
<br />
Jeff just rested his forehead on the table in shame.  “… I couldn’t resist.”<br />
<br />
“Haha don’t be ashamed son.  It’s understandable you’d want to explore.” Mike laughed.<br />
<br />
Jeff tried to shift the subject away from masturbation as he scratched his midsection.  <br />
“Shit dad, I still wasn’t expecting your, uh, hair to crawl up my body like that.  It’s kinda itchy. And looks awkward because I’m still smooth above it.”<br />
<br />
Mike sipped his coffee. “Yeah I really had a jungle down there.  Guess swapping manhoods extended the pubic hair from your groin around so that our new appendages transition better.”<br />
Mike then lifted up his shirt a bit to give his son a look at his baby smooth abdominal region leading up to his burly chest hair.<br />
“Sorry you ended up with a mess of pubes.  Hmm, come to think of it…”<br />
<br />
Jeff sighed and opted to just stop drinking his orange juice altogether.  No way was he in the mood to eat or drink during this conversation.<br />
“What is it dad?”<br />
<br />
“We traded balls too.  Mine were pretty damn hairy as well.  If area above our groins grew some hair to reflect the base of our cocks…”<br />
<br />
“… yeah?” Jeff replied, afraid where this chain of thought was going.<br />
<br />
“If the hair growth extended one way…”<br />
<br />
“…”<br />
<br />
“Son, you might want to check your—”<br />
<br />
Before Mike could finish, the sound of approaching footsteps cut through the air. <br />
<br />
“Look at my two favorite boys, up before me even!”<br />
<br />
The pair anxiously looked at eachother as Mike’s wife, Judy, made her way towards the dinner table.  She was wearing the gray pencil skirt and matching blazer that her husband always boasted she looked great in.  Mike prepared to greet his wife with their routine morning kiss before work but he was surprised to find she walked past him entirely.  <br />
<br />
Jeff didn’t have time to react before being pulled into a passionate kiss with his own mother.  His eyes were bugging out as they both explored the inside of each other’s mouths. <br />
<br />
Mike was surprised as well but his borrowed nether regions were definitely turned on by what he was witnessing.<br />
<br />
Judy pulled away, casually inspecting Jeff’s face.  She then licked her thumb and started scrubbing away at his cheek like she always did. “You really need to clean your face in the morning sweetie!  Now I’ll be gone for a couple days on this work seminar so you two behave.  All the important numbers are on the fridge Mike.  Jeff, make sure your father doesn’t get into too much trouble.  Bye you two!” Judy said closing the front door.<br />
<br />
Jeff was still processing what just happened before turning to his father, “Y-you saw that too right?!  <br />
<br />
“I did.  And it looks like you enjoyed yourself, huh kiddo?”  Mike grinned.<br />
<br />
“Hardly!  It’s like my mouth went into autopilot.”  Jeff said, trying to wipe the residue of his mothers lip balm off of himself.<br />
<br />
Mike chuckled. “Hardly is right. Seems like some part of you didn’t get the memo.”<br />
Mike gestured over to his son’s hard on making itself known through his sweat pants.<br />
<br />
“Dad, maybe this wasn’t the best idea afterall…”<br />
<br />
“Relax Jeff, you heard your mother, she’ll be out of town for a few days on that seminar, work retreat thing.  You shouldn’t have any other close encounters with her for awhile.”<br />
<br />
“But she still called me Jeff and then still called you my father?! She knows I’m her son but we just made out!”<br />
<br />
“Hmm, looks like despite being her son, she’s treating as if you were um… me?”<br />
<br />
“Wait, so how will school work?“<br />
<br />
Mike took a big swig of his coffee and stood up. “You’ll have to tell me all about this afternoon!  I’m heading to the office. After seeing the way our little arrangement impacted your mother, I’m kind of excited to see what my job at the insurance agency will be like.” <br />
<br />
Jeff rolled his eyes.  “Yeah dad, I don’t really think you’ll need worry about someone giving you tongue first thing in the morning.”  Jeff said as he poured himself some water to wash his mouth. <br />
<br />
Mike smirked “So that was some tongue action I saw from you?”  <br />
<br />
“DAD!” Jeff said before spitting the water into the sink <br />
<br />
“Haha just teasing.  You’ll be fine Jeff.  Just keep thinking about our initial talk on curiosity.”<br />
<br />
Jeff gargled more water before responding.  “Yeah that’s true.”  Jeff rubbed his hand across his groin.  “This feels sooo good, but man is it awkward.  I’m not even sure why I said yes to all this dad.” <br />
<br />
Mike knew the mental change of curiosity would keep Jeff from requesting a swap back this soon.  He opted just to let his son’s own horniness keep him on board with the change as well for moment.  But still, Mike wanted to make sure “daddy Jeff” wouldn’t get too big for his britches,<br />
<br />
“Well, we both agreed to this son, and I think you should start being prouder of what you got-“<br />
<br />
And in one swift motion, Mike pantsed his son from behind.<br />
<br />
“-because nothing screams ‘man of the house’ like a big cock and a hairy ass!” Mike laughed.<br />
<br />
Mike’s line of thinking earlier was correct.  The hair from his ass migrated right onto his son’s when they switched genitals.<br />
<br />
“SHIT! DAD!” Jeff said pulling up his pants.<br />
<br />
“Relax Jeff!  It all comes with the territory.  Nothing to be embarrassed about!  Now I’m off to work.  You better finish getting dressed and head out .”  Mike grabbed his keys.<br />
“Enjoy your day at school, ‘Dad’” Mike winked as he closed the front door.</p>
