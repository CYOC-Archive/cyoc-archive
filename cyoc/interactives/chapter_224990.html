<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"> “MORNING, LADS!” Barrie’s characteristically obnoxious voice echoed through the dining room, ushering in the day ahead for the young boys eating their breakfast cereal, a day that Scott determinedly hoped wouldn’t leave him out to dry as had the last. “I HOPE EVERYONE’S NIGHT WAS PERFECTLY COMFY-COZY!”<br />
<br />
…<br />
<br />
Indeed, Scott had woken up so cozily warm, still nestled next to Kai as the sun peeked through the blinds. The older boy had done well to comfort his younger peer, garnering a sizable chunk of trust and goodwill in that singular gesture alone, but Scott awoke with a renewed sense of purpose. His nightmare earlier the previous evening, though rattling, had reminded him of his mission and of a time when he had struck fear into the hearts of many a felon, fugitive, and black marketeer alike. Setting aside his high-ranking status at the agency, Scott had weaved into his physical persona the very essence of intimidation. His strong, creased brow that lorded over his piercing green eyes; his impressively full, kempt, ginger-brown beard; the bulk and muscle he’d acquired to overcome any physical hurdle; the scars that spoke stories of survival and triumph, a testament to his most prized asset: his will. Scott returned to his own bed, slipping under the covers and hoping that Kai would notice his absence, seeing him for how strong and independent he really was.<br />
<br />
He would continue along with Kai’s plan, as it was currently his best shot of acquiring the tech, even if it did mean sharing the spoils with a nefarious, unknown entity, but as soon as he could secure a few more years—hell, maybe even surpass Kai in age—Scott wouldn’t need to rely on the corporate spy any longer, and he could perhaps even quash any schoolboy crush he may or may not have had on the guy. The thought of his “schoolboy crush” carried little Scott back off to a sound slumber, remembering just moments ago how he’d felt so shielded and secure, his smallness safeguarded by the big, confident Kai.<br />
<br />
Scott had later awoken, seeing that Kai had left him alone in the room, which had brightened as the boy caught a bit more shuteye. He removed the covers, peering upon this form that had fallen so far from the daunting man he’d been just the day before. Still in just his Batman briefs, Scott set out to change that; it was, after all, no longer his penalty day, so he could tackle today with the confidence of being fully clothed. Exploring his dresser once again, Scott found two more drawers available to him. Opting for a clean pair of blue briefs with various sports balls, Scott shucked his old undies into a hamper he found next to the dresser. From his exploration, he produced a pair of denim shorts and an orange Transformers tee. He knew it was odd, feeling a restored sense of dignity as he covered himself in the juvenile outfit, but it was these little victories that would help sustain him in the coming days. Besides, it may not be too long before such an outfit seemed downright grown-up to him. Fully dressed, the youngest boy was ready to join the noisy trio downstairs at the breakfast table.<br />
<br />
…<br />
<br />
“It would have been <i>much</i> comfier and cozier if Jackson had decided not to snore last night!” Ernesto reached into the box of Froot Loops, producing a singular piece to set carefully on the table and flick directly at his roommate across from him, punctuating his dissatisfaction.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, bro!” The boy retaliated with a Cheerio of his own. “Must be a holdover from before the kidification. Nothin’ I can do about that.”<br />
<br />
“IN ANY CASE, I HOPE YOU ALL SLEPT WELL BECAUSE YOU’RE GONNA NEED TO USE THOSE WELL-RESTED, LITTLE BRAINS OF YOURS FOR THIS DAY 2 CHALLENGE!”<br />
<br />
All four boys tensed up simultaneously, each understanding, even more than the morning prior, exactly the ramifications of doing well and doing poorly in the challenges. Nevertheless, each maintained a semblance of cool, noshing down on their respective cereal while Barrie brought forth the less-than-stellar news.<br />
<br />
“IT SEEMS YOU BOYS WERE MORE INTERESTED IN IDLE CHITCHAT THAN IN STIMULATING YOUR BRAINS THIS MORNING!”<br />
<br />
That was a fair enough assessment. Scott had entered the dining room, last of all the boys, finding the others engaged in a positively riveting conversation about Ernesto’s experience on some other game show that would <i>surely</i> give him an edge in upcoming challenges.<br />
<br />
“YESTERDAY’S CHALLENGE WAS ALL ABOUT GETTING USED TO YOUR NEW BODIES IN A PHYSICAL SENSE, BUT NOW WE’RE GONNA FOCUS ON THE MENTAL SIDE OF THINGS!”<br />
<br />
As Barrie rambled on, Scott began psyching himself up for the test to come, assuring himself that he was <i>at least</i> smarter than the other pair of roommates.<br />
<br />
“FORTUNATELY, WE’VE ALREADY GOT OUR CHALLENGE RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU ALL! JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE BOXES, BOYS!”<br />
<br />
Each boy grabbed their box of cereal, each a different type, but the same, almost imperceptible little plastic tab reading “Peel Me” had found its way onto the back of each of the four boxes.<br />
<br />
“THAT’S RIGHT, LADS! WE’RE GONNA HAVE A CEREAL BOX BRAIN BATTLE! AT THE BOTTOM OF YOUR BOXES, JUST BENEATH THE BAG, YOU’LL EACH FIND A PEN. WITH THAT PEN, YOU WILL COMPLETE THE PUZZLES ON THE BACK OF YOUR BOX. POINTS WILL BE AWARDED FOR SPEED AND ACCURACY. THE CONTESTANT WITH THE MOST POINTS WILL BE AWARDED WITH AN AGE BOOST, WHILE THE CONTESTANT WITH THE FEWEST POINTS WILL BE SUBJECT TO A MYSTERY PENALTY VOTED ON BY OUR AUDIENCE!”<br />
<br />
The foursome had all retrieved their pens, and each sat ready, bowls pushed aside, eager to peel off the false box backing to reveal the true test underneath. Kai, sitting across from his roommate, shot the smaller boy a determined glance, one that signaled his intent to dominate the competition, while at the same time encouraging his runty roommate to aim for the same. The look breathed new life into Scott’s steely resolve. He knew he could do this! Even Kai seemed to be silently cheering him on! Overconfidence had been a part of his previous downfall, though, and Scott wasn’t eager to make the same mistakes. Kai had warned him to be wary of Jackson and Ernesto, that they were fiercer competitors than either might let on. Scott steadied his breathing, bracing for Barrie’s imminent countdown.<br />
<br />
“GET READY, BOYS! REVEAL YOUR PUZZLES IN 3… 2… 1!”</p>
