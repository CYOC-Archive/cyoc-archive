<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You are lying on your green-scaled draconic back, and Dizzy&#39;s blue form is lying on top of yours, his muzzle close enough to yours to almost touch. You have been lost for a while in those steel-blue eyes, looking into a soul as noble as a soldier in his nation&#39;s service and yet as free as a primordial wind-spirit. You have no idea how long you and he have been lying there like this. You have no idea of whether your erection has gone down or not. It stopped mattering once you got lost inside those gray tidal pools.<br />
<br />
The sun has long since disappeared over the lip of the ravine, and the sky is turning evening blue. He looks up at the darkening sky, and he says, sounding unworried, {{There are things I was supposed to do, really}}.<br />
<br />
You knead his chest with your paws. {{It&#39;s not too late to go do them, is it?}}<br />
<br />
{{I want to stay and spend the night with you}} he says bluntly.<br />
<br />
You and he lie quietly together for a while longer as the stars come out over the ravine, one by one. At some point, he has rolled off of your chest, and he lies sleeping with his head snuggled behind your foreleg. You can&#39;t help but caress his beautiful face, smiling. Moving slowly, you roll him onto his back, and you lie as he was lying on you, with your head up to his chest and staring.<br />
<br />
Soon, as you lie with your position and his reversed, your head drops to the chest of your blue-scaled caregiver, and you fall to sleep more gently than you ever could have fallen to sleep in your mother&#39;s arms.<br />
<br />
You are flying. It doesn&#39;t feel quite right, though. It doesn&#39;t feel like you&#39;re straining or fighting against air-currents. You are just floating effortlessly, not even feeling immersed in water but feeling more like you are wrapped in a fluid, warm gel that supports you and allows you to move through it slowly. Instead of sky, the background is some grayish color, maybe, or perhaps you don&#39;t notice the background or else it has no color at all, being more of an absence of background. You might try to think about the background later, you decide.<br />
<br />
Your rational mind almost starts trying to analyze this scene further to make sense of it, but reason is thrust aside as you take in Dizzy-tail. He&#39;s not looking like either a human or an animal anymore, but this time, he looks more like your own species than either ever could. He looks like a dragon, which you are just realizing now is more &quot;human&quot; to you than a human would be. You have never seen a human, in your memory, with as much sentience, intelligence and life as Dizzy-tail. You have never seen a human that was as alive to you as Dizzy-tail. You have never seen a human you wanted to touch as much as you want to touch Dizzy-tail.<br />
<br />
His body looks so beautiful and elegant as he swims through the air or whatever peculiar medium this is that you are in. He kicks his hind feet in the air and twists his body around like an exotic fish, scales every bit the color of raw kyanite glistening gently and with a peculiar warmth, making your green tourmaline blush greener still. Dizzy&#39;s jaws part and close, and his head turns and rolls back languidly as the gel seems to caress him like a warm tropical rain. <br />
<br />
You realize you are jerking your hips. You feel something hot wrapped around your cock. You realize you are pressed belly to belly with Dizzy, and your hips are thrusting your cock savagely into his hole. As the lucid dream clears away, the reality starts to sink in of what you&#39;ve been doing. You have been fucking Dizzy-tail, you don&#39;t know for how long. You don&#39;t know for sure it&#39;s even possible this could happen in your sleep.<br />
<br />
How? Were you really asleep, or were you partially awake and rationalizing what you were half-aware of doing with the remnants of a dream? Dizzy-tail is purring thunderously, seeming to be somewhere between waking and sleeping like you have apparently been for some time, your bodies fucking on autopilot. Your tails are entwined around each other like snakes, locking your bodies firmly together. {{Amber}} he whispers into your mind.<br />
<br />
Is he giving you a name? You realize you never told him your human name after all these days. You decide that Amber is your name. It&#39;s a nice name. You hope it&#39;s not someone else&#39;s name.<br />
<br />
{{Dizzy}} you whisper back. As you become more fully conscious of what you&#39;re doing and accept that you are not just having a vivid dream (although what a dream!), you slow down gradually, and soon, you come to a stop. {{Dizzy}} you say gently, giving him a slight shake. {{Wake up. We&#39;re...}}<br />
<br />
Fucking.<br />
<br />
{{We&#39;re...}}<br />
<br />
Mating<br />
<br />
{{Is this okay? What we&#39;re...}}<br />
<br />
Doing.<br />
<br />
As he comes slightly more awake, he blushes up at you, and you realize that dragons really do blush. {{It feels so nice}} he says, sounding amazed. {{I can&#39;t believe...it&#39;s so nice...}}<br />
<br />
{{Should I stop?}} you ask. {{I hope you&#39;ll tell me if this isn&#39;t right}} you say.<br />
<br />
{{Don&#39;t}} he pleads.<br />
<br />
You realize you&#39;re breathing heavily. {{So you want it}} you say. No, you don&#39;t know this. You want to know. You want to KNOW. You want to know he&#39;s given himself to you, not have it like this, in just some dream. You want to finish this right. You want him. You want him to give himself. This can&#39;t just pass as a half-remembered dream you and he could pretend to forget, no, no, no, you want HIM. {{Then say &quot;FUCK me, Amber!&quot;}} you command him.<br />
<br />
{{I&#39;m Dizzy. Who...?}}<br />
<br />
{{You called me Amber}} you say with a growl. {{I don&#39;t know if Amber is anybody, but Amber&#39;s me now. Say you want Amber to fuck you, or this stops now}} You can&#39;t believe you&#39;re saying these things.<br />
<br />
His eyes widen. {{That&#39;s what I named you in my dream}} he says softly. {{I only saw the color amber. I saw great fields of amber. I only saw Amber. Amber-fields}} He looks at you intensely. {{And so I name you}} he intones sonorously, {{you be mine, Amber-fields}}. He snarls and pushes his asshole back against your member, which is still planted in him and still just hard enough to stay in him. {{Fuck me, Amber-fields. Fuck me. Fuck me. Fuck me, Amber-fields}}. He just keeps repeating this.<br />
<br />
Goaded by his repeated command, you give a growl as your member comes back to its full hardness, shoving yourself violently into his depths. The same dragon that nursed you like a mother would her hatchling, the same dragon that shared his game with you, the same dragon that saved your life, you drive your dick into his body, giving yourself to him and, at the same time, making him yours.<br />
<br />
As you slide and slap your belly against his, you realize you feel his hard cock throbbing against your belly. You try unsuccessfully to use your belly to rub his cock. You realize your body is sinuous enough to somehow curve around to get your snout around that cock, and you realize how hungry you are for that cock. It&#39;s going to be your cock. You coil yourself around and get it into your muzzle, interrupting your work on his hole but keeping yourself planted firmly inside him. You curl up like a kitten, and the tip of that cock touches against your lips.<br />
<br />
{{What are you doing?}} he asks.<br />
<br />
You snarl dominantly and touch the flesh threateningly with your teeth, kneading at the surrounding area with your paw. As he relaxes, you start using your neck to thrust your throat down over that cock, turning your head from side to side. The fluids leaking from his body taste so good, so very good, so very perfect. You get into a rhythm, falling mindlessly into almost a sort of trance. You can&#39;t believe how hungry you have always been for this, for a dick in your throat so perfectly shaped. Inhumanly perfect, more something made by a god of masculinity just for stroking your throat.<br />
<br />
As you work your mouth over his cock, you realize that, at times, he starts thrusting with his hips. As his hips thrust, it feels like ambrosia on your own cock. This drives you to using your muzzle to goad his body to thrusting his asshole back against your hips, and by the very act of you devouring his cock, he devours yours with his hole. It&#39;s like some madman&#39;s version of the tale of the Ouroboros, with one end eating the other. The very insanity of the vision fills you with bestial lust.<br />
<br />
As you empty your loins into him and his cum splashes down your gullet like liquid fire, a purr rumbles in your chest, and you have no thought of slowing down. Your bodies are young, young enough to keep going and young enough to keep producing seemingly forever.<br />
<br />
As the night wears on, you and he try many other positions. At some point, you are on all-fours as he holds up your tail and thrusts into your depths, and he pulls up on your hips enough that he is lifting your hind-legs clear off the ground, snarling as his strong, powerful, masculine, draconic body floods you with seed.<br />
<br />
Every sense of the ordinary dies inside you forever as two male dragons couple together in carnal eternity, a fulfilled purpose of their own to be written in the stars.</p>
