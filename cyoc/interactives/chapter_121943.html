<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Richie and Becky quickly grew through their tween years. Their clothes had been keeping pace with them, changing in size to match their bodies. But as first Richie then Becky hit 13, their bodies went through a new phase. Richie started growing taller than before, his arms and legs became a lot lankier. Becky was soon entering an awkward phase herself where her limbs seem mismatched against her body. Becky gave a soft whimper as she felt her nipples stand out before they started to push forward. Their increased sensitivity made Becky feel uncomfortable until a training bra appeared under her shirt. Similarly, Richie could feel the front of his pants getting tighter. There wasn&#39;t much he could do about it but hope that Becky didn&#39;t notice.<br />
<br />
But despite their awkward feelings, they didn&#39;t break off their kiss. And their persistence was rewarded. Becky&#39;s small chest was starting to fill out, her nipples rising out on top of cones, her hips started to expand out as her rear became less flat. Richie&#39;s lanky body was gaining more width as his muscles started to grow. His arms tickled as the small hairs on them started growing longer and thicker. Their confidence started to grow as they got a bit more passionate with their kissing.<br />
<br />
As they went through their high school years, their clothes started to change to new ones. Becky&#39;s suspenders vanished as her blue jeans became a lot shorter, showing more of her increasingly curvy legs. The sleeves of her shirt rolled up until they became mere straps at her shoulders. Her neckline dipped down as her new tank top started showing off more of her increasing cleavage. Her socks faded as her loafers became opened-toed pumps, showing off her now-painted nails. Richie&#39;s clothes didn&#39;t change in style much, but they did change in color. The color of his shirt darkened while the insignia on it lightened until he was now wearing a black shirt with a silver Autobot insignia on it. His sneakers became more adult as they grew to fit his growing feet, but there was still an Autobot insignia tampographed on the sides, though not as colorful before, clearly a personal customization. His shorts remained largely unchanged, though an extra set of pockets appeared as they shifted to cargo shorts.<br />
<br />
By this point, both Richie and Becky were well into their final teen years. Their kissing was becoming more passionate as their hands went over each other. Becky moaned a little as she allowed her full breasts to smush against Richie&#39;s broad chest. Richie was no longer embarrassed by the bulge in his shorts. In fact, he moved his pelvis forward so that he ground a bit against Becky. Becky gave a soft squeak before breaking off the kiss. With that, the magic stopped, leaving them at their current ages.<br />
<br />
Rebecka was now a very attractive young woman of 20. Her fiery red hair was now unbound and splayed over her shoulders and upper back. Her freckles had mostly faded, but there were still a few there on her beautiful face. The freckles on Rebecka&#39;s body were a bit more obvious with her tank top exposing quite a bit of skin, especially on the tops of her C-cup breasts which were boldly displayed. Her curvy hips and ass were encased in a tight pair of blue jean shorts, leaving her long luscious legs bare between them and her pumps. Richard was quite handsome himself at 21, his mature face now having a light covering of stubble. His Autobot shirt was a little loose, but it didn&#39;t hide the muscular chest under it. His exposed arms and legs also had muscular detail, as well as noticeable dark hair. And it was pretty obvious that he was sporting a serious erection under his shorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rick, we can&#39;t be doing that in public,&quot; said Rebecka in a more mature voice, &quot;Especially with children nearby.&quot; She indicated the kids on the playground who had not too long ago been her classmates. Though she wouldn&#39;t know them now, her classes now being at the local college.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I just got so horny with you,&quot; said Richard, his voice a lot deeper than it was before they started kissing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I could feel you right against me,&quot; said Rebecka, her eyes going to Richard&#39;s crotch with growing longing.<br />
<br />
Richard lifted an eyebrow and said, &quot;Your nipples are starting to show.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rebecka looked down and quickly covered her chest. She glanced down to make sure. Her nipples were still covered by her bra and top, but it was just possible to see the indentions they made. &quot;I guess I&#39;m hornier than I realized,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about we head back to the apartment and take care of that?&quot; suggested Richard, his memories now telling him that he and Rebecka shared an apartment, most often the bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I really need to take the edge off this,&quot; said Rebecka as she stood up. Soon the college-aged couple were walking back to the apartment building where they lived so they could deal with their heightened libido.<br />
<br />
Katie was finding herself rather aroused by the display. Her sports bra concealed her nipples well, but they were definitely fully erect and rubbing beneath the cloth. Katie could feel a light bit of dampness in her shorts, thought thankfully not enough to be seen. She hadn&#39;t paid much attention to the libido of her adult body before, but now it was awakened and begging for attention. Perhaps she ought to find herself a man to help her take care of that. There were probably plenty of guys in the park who would be happy to help a curvy young woman scratch her itch. And there were plenty of boys who could be aged up to do the job as well.</p>
