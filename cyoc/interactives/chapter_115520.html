<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot; you know what, it&#39;s true I can always transform here at the house, but I&#39;ve always liked the huskies down at the kennel and maybe by using these device I might be able to understand their wild and hyper behavior, plus I just won&#39;t to see to be a husky that sounds awesome!&quot; Brian thought has he grabbed the N.A.D.D suit just in case he decided to try out the shrinking/Growing option and his jeep keys and headed out the front door. His border collie Cooper awoke from his mid afternoon nap and followed Brian to the door. &quot;Hey buddy, I&#39;ll be home soon, I just need to try some things. I promise when we get back will have some fun&quot; Brian playfully told his dog. Cooper jumped on his hind legs leaning his front on Brian&#39;s hip. &quot;Say your a good boy buddy, be good.&quot; And with that he stepped through the door and outside and into the first part of his adventure. <br />
<br />
It was only a few minute drive down his street and across to the connecting gravel road, which led up to the Kennel. Brian had some more time to think over the transformation and how it was going to go down. &quot;Ok, so this is crazy, but I&#39;m actually going to transform myself into a Siberian husky. Oh geez, this is crazy&quot; he was both hyped and nervous. So the effects last 24 hours so I&#39;ll need to plan ahead at the kennel, fortunately I still have my key to the front office and if As long as Mindy isn&#39;t around I should be able to sneak in. But of course that&#39;s the other thing, what about Mindy? I knows she&#39;s bound to discover she&#39;s their&#39;s a extra husky mouth in her kennel. Maybe I should explain to her the N.A.D.D devices or maybe be sneaking and wait until later. Either way once I&#39;m in the office, and I have transformed into the husky I will need a place to go, should I interact with the animals right away or observe first that react? I always got along with the huskies and other dogs when I worked there, but that was when I was human, how would they react to dog me? Oh geez, now I&#39;m getting nervous maybe this wasn&#39;t such a good idea.&quot; Brian was worried, he had always been a highly nervous kid growing up and although he tried to outgrow it, every now and then he would get himself worked up over changes don big plans. &quot;No, no I&#39;m not getting worked up today, I have waited to long for this opportunity, I&#39;m going to be a vet someday and the knowledge and experience I gain from these transformations will only help me in my field. Plus all my friends back at school didn&#39;t think I had it in me to even enter in the lottery, so I here&#39;s to proving them wrong.&quot; Brian thought as he turned the key and opened the office door. The smell of Dog odor and cheap cleaning supplies rushed his noise. A smell he hadn&#39;t smelled in a while, yet he felt a little at home but the odor combination. He flicked on the light switch and entered the room. It was a small work office nothing real fancy. On the left side of the room was the check in desk and small waiting section. A gate and small fence divided the room in half horizontally p, so that way dogs could round lose in the office and not risk escape. Across the fence was a open layout filled with dog beds, toys, and selves and storage bins filled with all kinds of dog related junk. The the right was the entrance to the grooming room which housed your standard grooming table and tub. Next to the groom room was the actually entrance to the kennel, a steel door was installed to keep noise down and attached to the door below was a large breed sized doggy door. Mainly for decoration, the doggy door was rarely opened since the man door was usually never shut. The left of the room behind the desk was another door, but this time this for led outside to s large 100yard sized fence in play area full of toys and play equipment. Here the boarding dogs and huskies could play individual or in a pack and run off some energy. <br />
    Brian made his way through the gate and behind the desk. He stared up a shelf Mindy had of all the awards and pictures of the dogs she breed and showed in dog shows over the years. He walked over to the far wall but the kennel door and looked through a large panoramic window that showed the enter first half of the kennel where the huskies slept. Brian could see some of them still taking in a afternoon nap, others eating on some hours old Kebble. &quot;Yeah I&#39;m ready, hello guys I&#39;m going to be joining you soon, save some Kebble for me.&quot; Brian said aloud as he made his way to the door. First he unlocked the doggy door and blew off the dust on the flap and gave it a test swung. Then he walked over behind the Desk where he had some privacy in the office. I figure just in case things go south and the dogs don&#39;t interact with me well, it&#39;s better to transform in the office then in the back where I can first observe.&quot; With that in mind he activated the watch and after the familiar chime he made his selection.<br />
<br />

<br />
Age- 2 years<br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;Ohhhh ok, I guess it&#39;s show time, goodbye humanity I&#39;ll see yeah in a while, hello Canine&quot; with that Brian selected activate a sudden tightness took over his body, as if something had caused all the blood, all the oxygen in his body to stop moving. Suddenly he became loose again but he felt slightly different. A dull pain began to form in his back. The his legs started to feel a little sore and his knees started to shake. He went to sit down in the rolling chair behind him, but his back soon hitched over in deep pain. &quot;Ahhh God what did I do.&quot; He yelled out ad he fell to his hands and his knees on the ground, soon though the pain started to subside and a slightly numbness took over his body. He was immobilized on the floor but in little pain. He glanced down at his watch and it flashed 37% complete. He then noticed all along his wrist and arm, tiny white hairs beginning to from and grow. At first very thin and scares, but soon they began to thicken up and spread all over his body. As he noticed the hairs start to turn into thick coatings of grey and white fur, he relaxed something black was starting to appear in his line of shight, his nose. He felt a tingle in his face and he noticed his whole mouth and nose begin to stretch out and form a canine muzzle. He ran his tongue along the inside of new mouth to feel the forming canine teeth. Soon though his tongue began to enlarge and he wasn&#39;t able to control it as well and soon was forced to open his mouth to keep from bunching up. He started to laugh on the inside as he relaxed he was now panting. He looked down at his wrist and the watch, his arm and hands now we&#39;re taking shape of a dogs paw and dark black claws began to form in the place of his nails. The watch flashed 64% complete and then a sharp pain spiked him in his lower back and broke him from his euphoric state. A sudden fear set over him. &quot;Oh Great, I just relaxed I forgot or take my clothes off before. His v neck t shirt had already become slightly loser on his new body, but sill covered most of his front. His jeans and underwear were a different story. His jeans had already mostly slipped off, exposing him in his dark blue boxer briefs. The pain in his back persisted until finally with a almost &quot;bong&quot; like sound a fully grown and furry husky tail shot up sending the tight underwear up and off his body. Know only being covered in a t-shirt, Brian soon felt the next part of his transformation and he realized the room around him was getting bigger as he shrunk into the average size of a dog. He also discovered his vision had blurred slightly at a distance and colors became less vivid and more cooler I temperature. He looked down at his watch and surprisingly the strap had adjusted itself to fit perfectly on his new dog leg. The numbers read 88% complete. &quot;I wonder what else can be next&quot; Brian thought as two white and grey tipped ears flopped down from his head. It had nearly been two minutes and he had already become a nearly perfect looking Siberian husky. Maybe a slightly skinnier husky, but still a dog. It then hit him, what he was missing as a rush of smells and odors flooded his noise. Smells of different dogs fur, urine, food and saliva. Peoples perfume, Body spray, B.O. Cleaving supplies, bleach, Ckorax,pine sol. They all rushed his nose all at once, a bit over powering  at first, Brian sneezed and Sneezed repeatedly for a few seconds before getting his barrings. &quot;Oh my god, I can&#39;t believe it I knew dogs had powerful scent glands, but this is incredible! I can smell every thing, every dog, person, even some smell outside I can pick up on. Of course I could do without the smells of urine and feces, but still this is incredible!&quot; Was so excited he glanced down at his leg and watch once more time and saw that it read still 96% complete. &quot; ok now I&#39;m really lost, what&#39;s next I&#39;m a dog now there nothing human about me except my brain, but just like that he felt one final jolt of pain and he realized what the last 4% were all about. He felt below as his man region began to reshuffle and restructure into that if a dog stealth, white fur began to coat around the his crotch area. His Testicles soon dropped into place and grey as grey fur began to cost over them as well. Brian could feel the effects, alter his hormone levels as he began to feel a jolt of energy and a drive to run around and explore surged his mind. He still had control over his human side and had all his human memories, but the dog hormones where definitely present and caused him to have a increased instinct drive. &quot; ok ok focus Brian, remember your Brian the human, but also remover your a Flippen&#39; SIBERIAN HUSKY NOW!!!!!!! THIS IS AWESOME!!!!! He couldn&#39;t help yourself as you took off running circles around the office. He sooner learned fast though running on four legs is different than two and after two steps he crashed muzzle first in the concrete floor. &quot; Note to self, always remember to more than one paw in front of the other, check&quot; after making a few practice steps, he was back to running in circles again. With all this new found energy, Brian could contain himself as he started yepping and barking and soon he let out a trademark husky howl. It wasn&#39;t as deep and powerful as most, but it still made him feel cool. &quot;This is unbelievable I am a husky, hahaha I am a dog&quot; Brian thought to himself as he walked around the office sniffing everything with his new supersonic nose. <br />
<br />
Overwhelmed by the new experience, Brian didn&#39;t notice that Mindy had just entered the office and has the front door clicked shut, Brian jumped up to attention and stared in shock and worry and he stared up to see Mindy now at least twice his size stare back at him. With a kind smile on her middle aged face she took a step a surprised stepped back and then spoke. &quot;Well who do we have here?&quot;</p>
