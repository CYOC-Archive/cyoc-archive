<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Entering the town, the Butlers worked their RV through the streets, finding both a place to shop and a place to park.  As they did this, they passed a number of the town’s inhabitants, sometimes seen by them, sometimes not.  The effect was the same in either case, the sidewalks becoming littered with pieces of clothing that became too small to fit the forms of their former wearers, cars stopping as their drivers were forced to readjust the seats to fit before continuing on.  <br />
<br />
Finding a good spot, they parked up and left, easier for Nathan as he hadn’t been driving so they were able to begin a brisk stroll in short time.  <br />
<br />
“Sho?  Thish place?”  Nathan asked her, as they came alongside a good clothes shop they’d spotted earlier.  <br />
<br />
“To shart with, yesh.”  Suzanne replied, already stooping slightly to get through the door.  <br />
<br />
Due to the time they’d taken from passing the shop, to parking their RV, and then walking back, the one who greeted them had already been affected by another so there was no shock or surprise at the naked equine couple that came in.  Having already picked up the scraps of his former clothes, and replacing it with the largest waistcoat the shop had, ‘David’ being the name on his nametag, even if he couldn‘t quite close it up it served its purpose.  <br />
<br />
“Can I helph you?”  He greeted them, still adapting to speech through his changed form.  <br />
<br />
“Yesh.  We’re needing some new coats, waterproofs, weather gear.”  Nathan answered his question politely.  “Our onsh, are a poor fit.”  He added, looking outside to the sky that darkened with an approaching storm.  <br />
<br />
“I shee.  We have shome over there.”  He pointed to a corner of the shop.  “Take you thime pleashe.”  <br />
<br />
They looked over what was on offer, but kept running into the same problem again and again.  While everything for sale was well suited to any human customer, for those like the Butlers, it was all rather too small for them to get into.  <br />
<br />
“Finally.”  Nathan sighed, when he eventually managed to slip on a light-brown trench coat that could fit him, though still a little tight, he could at least get it fastened around his thick torso.  <br />
<br />
“And jusht in time too.”  Suzanne pointed outside, where the rain was not only falling now, nut with some serious ferocity.  <br />
<br />
“Besht pay for theesh then, and head back.”  Nathan suggested as he took his coat off and accepted Suzanne’s choice, hers being a light-cream colour, that she found easier to fit into being smaller than Nathan.  <br />
<br />
“Are you sure you don’th wanth to shtay here a while?”  David asked, the rainfall intensifying.  <br />
<br />
“I am sure, we already know where we’re going.”  Nathan replied as he paid for the purchase, passing Suzanne’s coat to her as he put the change into his wallet.  “Okay, we ran shtraight to the RV, then we can eat there.”  Nathan explained as his coat was closed around him and they prepared to venture into the wet streets.  <br />
<br />
It certainly was a heavy downpour, and most others had taken shelter in various stores and homes to escape it, so as the Butlers raced through the close-to-empty streets, they sighted a great many Anthro-Horses looking at them with a mixture of concern and a longing to help.  <br />
<br />
Reaching their RV in short time, they stopped by its door as Suzanne fumbled about for the keys, fishing through her handbag before her large hands wrapped around them.  Squeezing themselves inside, Nathan was quick to seal them inside and away from the rain, while their new coats had worked in that they had kept the rain out from where it was hit, it hadn’t stopped a little of it from dripping down their necks and sliding down them like that.  In addition, the effort of their run had worked them into quite a sweat now, as Nathan lay on the RV floor the door and kitchen on either side of his head while Suzanne slid on top of him, resting her head by his neck.  <br />
<br />
“Whew!”  Suzanne gasped out after she got her breath back.  “That wash a rush!”  <br />
<br />
“True.”  Nathan agreed as he wrapped his armed around her, his biceps pressing against his coat sleeves though not enough to threaten its integrity.  “But in this rain, might not be, a good, idea, to drive.”  <br />
<br />
“Then what do we do?”  Suzanne ‘asked’ as she slid one hand down and started to open Nathan’s coat from the bottom.  <br />
<br />
“Sheemsh to me, that you, have an idea in mind.”  Nathan replied as he felt his legs open up to the air, his mottled cock beginning to rise.  <br />
<br />
“I might.”  She teased, rising up just enough to show him that her own coat was partially open too, from the top as she slowly pulled the sides apart further to reveal one large, firm breast, then the other, as they were propped up by the rest of the coat.  <br />
<br />
“Then.”  Nathan began as he open his coat the rest of the way, slowly rising to a sitting position as he gently pulled Suzanne into his chest, his hardened member pressing into her.  “I think we can make shum time for it.”  No other words were needed now, as he played with one of her breasts gently while she began to play with is cock with one hand, the other unbuttoning her coat ever so slowly.  <br />
<br />

<br />
The three looking for them had been at the Gas Station when the rain started.  <br />
<br />
“Which way did they go?”  The youngest asked to no-one in particular.  <br />
<br />
“We may just have to split up and go one way each if we‘re to find them now.”  The other of the younger replied.  <br />
<br />
“Perhaps, but in this rain at least, they may decide to stop, we might have a chance to catch up to them in that case.”  The Elder added.  “But we’ll need another vehicle for that so first, we need to see if we can borrow one.”</p>
