<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eventually the team that was designated decided they would leave bright early, the same time that their guests had left for Paris. Jake had also left for Washington to announce hir official resignation. Shi had called hir wife to meet hir there. But hir journey there and back is another story, now is the time to track down one more person to complete this family. With Mina and Ronnie on standby in preparation for departure. Just then Timothy got up and walked out as they got ready to board. &quot;Issss there room for one more?&quot;<br />
<br />
Midnight looked. &quot;Normally I&#39;d say yes, but, Mistus Chakat, you&#39;d freeze to death.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shi looked down. &quot;Okay. I wasss jussst wanting to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
The dinokat walked up and taped hir on the shoulder. &quot;It&#39;s quite alright. I got the same respon...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm... you know, Mistus Jones, you are very beautiful, you know.&quot; Timothy smiled.<br />
<br />
The door was closing and Timothy caught a line from Midnight, &quot;Have fun you two.&quot; Shi giggled as the plane got ready to take off. Shi thought. &quot;I have an idea. It was a project we worked on in school.&quot;<br />
<br />
Talia looked. &quot;Oh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it was before me and Luna became kats. An idea of turning an island into a ship. Similar to what you had. What if we were to redo that with Atlantis? I mean we can have our own home and it&#39;d be perfect for Snowy and Maurice to work on the serum. We can even rename it to Katlantis.&quot; Shi giggled.<br />
<br />
Talia looked over and smiled. &quot;You know, that&#39;s not a bad idea. But you do know how cold it&#39;ll be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well yeah but we can try.&quot; Shi looked. &quot;Say who is our pilot this time?&quot; Shi walked and stopped. &quot;Chris, what are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I volunteered to fly you&#39;ll to Antarctica. I&#39;ve been there in the water many times and well, to fly there? It&#39;ll be fun.&quot; Shi giggled. &quot;Christina is at home with the shark flu. I guess shi got sick when we swam through that oil spill in the mediteranean.&quot; Shi said.<br />
<br />
Midnight grinned. &quot;Well, then I&#39;m glad you came. Cause we&#39;ll need help fixing up an old civilization.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, no problem.&quot; Shi said.<br />
<br />
Just as they flew right over Cuba a missile just barely missed them and headed strait north. Midnight looked at it. &quot;That missile.... Talia we got work to do.&quot; Shi turned and ran, jumping out the plane to take flight, shi went after the missile but fortunately shi managed to catch up and grab what was in it. Shi smiled as the now harmless missile headed north, shi turned and flew back to the plane. Shi smiled and landed on board.<br />
<br />
Talia giggled. &quot;What were you thinking you psyco?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This.&quot; Shi handed it to Talia who looked and examined it. &quot;Shit, str...&quot;<br />
<br />
Midnight looked, and got up front grabbing the radio. &quot;Coast guard can you hear me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is the U.S. Coast guard. What is your emergency?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is a harmless missile headed north. It had on board the kat virus. I repeat, it had the kat virus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean had?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I flew out and managed to grab what was in it. I couldn&#39;t disarm the bomb but the source came from Havana, Cuba.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cuba?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I said it came from Havana, Cuba, do you copy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We copy. We will contact the Secretary of Defense imediately.&quot;<br />
<br />
Midnight looked. &quot;I sounded like a child.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janace looked. &quot;Well, fortunately I always keep Jake&#39;s number on speed dial.&quot; Shi dialed and called hir right before the conference.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Jake had left precisely the same time as everyone else, hitching a ride with Justin and Francine to Washington. Shi had a big meeting to attend and walked right in. Shi looked at the President as he was ready to stand and give a speech. Just at that precise time hir phone went off. &quot;Hello... Jan. What is it, you sound anxious. A missile, from Havana? Right. I&#39;ll go talk to the Sec Def now.&quot; Jake looked and waved the President over.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it, Jake?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir, I need to talk to George now. We are at Def com 3.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Def Com 3?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Missile from Havana.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright. Go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake took and left heading strait for the Pentagon. Just as shi got their shi could see the missile&#39;s tail in the sky. It kept heading north. &quot;Oh dear god.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake ran in and broke through the glass in the room where they had been tracking the missile. &quot;Where&#39;s it headed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Toronto, Mistus Vice President.&quot; One of the soldiers said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit.&quot; Shi then got on the phone again. &quot;Mr. Prime Minister, I would set Toronto on High Alert, you have a missile imminent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Vice President Cain.&quot;<br />
<br />
What they didn&#39;t know was the missile had two sets of the virus. Jake looked. &quot;Where&#39;s the Secretary of Defense?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He should be in his office. Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re at war.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With who?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cuba.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cuba?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake left them and headed to the Secretary&#39;s office. &quot;Sir. Get the troops ready. I&#39;m calling a team from Janace to accompany some troops to Cuba.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cuba?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That missile came strait from Havana. And you need to get the New York National Guard ready near Niagara Falls and ready to help in Toronto. There&#39;s going to be another outbreak.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would Cuba want to get mixed up in this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who do you think Cuba&#39;s biggest allies are?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;North Korea.&quot; The Secretary got on the phone and ordered troops to stand by as the Vice President walked back to the capital building.<br />
<br />
There he met the President. &quot;Sir, my Resignation is on hold until further notice. I will be staying in Janace however. When these outbreaks are all finished, I will resign.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s my thought to. I have talked with everyone and they agree that you and I stay on even past my full term until this whole outbreak issue is done permanently or those scientists are aprehended. And speaking of which what has happened to the one the young lady cought in New York?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shi is currently being held for trial, for when they all are captured. With fear of them going into hiding again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Smart move. Now let&#39;s get to work. You set a good example on what we should do, and by god, you and I are going back to Janace until we find a perfect solution. After all, I did get a degree in chemistry, so.... I should be of some help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. President, you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What you and your brother, as well as sister in-law did woke me up. We are worried about these outbreaks but are sitting on our asses doing nothing. We are going to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Janace smiled as the aircraft landed right on the Antarctica Peninsula. Janace looked at them and smiled. &quot;Well... here we are.&quot; Shi and everyone else bundled up. Chris did not however and walked out not noticing the cold chill. Shi had discussed with Midnight their plans. Split into two teams. Anubis, Janice, Talis will search for hir sister, Midnight, Sammy and Gloria would search for Atlantis, and Chris would go with Midnight so in case it was under water.<br />
<br />
After they all spit up they began searching for signs of the lost civilization. Midnight had walked along then stopped dead. &quot;Wait, I think I know where it is.&quot; Shi looked up. &quot;Antarctica has one feature that it shouldn&#39;t have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What was it that they said destroyed Atlantis?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A vol.... oh right.&quot; Sammy nodded.  &quot;But why do you say that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mount Erebus. What if Talia was wrong. What if Atlantis is the full continent of Antarctica? Mount Erebus is Subere backwards. The name of the volcano on Atlantis.&quot;<br />
<br />
At that they made their way to Erebus. They looked around and looked into the volcano. And as sure as daylight they saw what could only be remains of a bridge inside the volcano. They smiled and jumped. &quot;We... We found it.&quot; Midnight ran and started to dig in the snow, Using all her paws to dig, only to be joined by the others. Once they got deep enough they found a foundation. They smiled and looked. &quot;We did it.&quot; They said. &quot;Question is, how do we get this ice....&quot;<br />
<br />
Gloria smiled. &quot;You know we are by an active volcano.&quot; Shi smiled and walked over and dropped some ice into it. The magma started to flow up and overflow. Glora smiled and everyone moved. The magma started turning the ice to steam and soon the entire area around Erebus was uncovered, fully. They looked around and smiled. &quot;Now that&#39;s done.&quot;<br />
<br />
Midnight looked. &quot;I guess shi was right.&quot; Shi felt the scene of being buoyant. &quot;Well, now that&#39;s different.&quot; Shi looked over. &quot;Oh dear. We are on an island with a vocano that flo...&quot; Shi smiled. &quot;That&#39;s how it gets around.&quot; Shi pointed. &quot;The volcano.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris dove into the water and went down. shi smiled when shi seen something. &quot;Well, I&#39;ll be.&quot; Shi thought to hirself. Shi swam back up and smiled. &quot;It&#39;s track is the fault lines.&quot;<br />
<br />
They were perplexed then looked at each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Talk about genius.&quot;</p>
