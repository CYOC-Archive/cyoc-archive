<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Maybe you&#39;re going to go out with your mother, but not right now - she carries you to another room and sits down, laying you down on your back next to her on the couch. You can hear her fidgeting around with something on the table next to the couch, then she picks you back up and puts you on her lap supported by a pillow so your head ends up next to her breast. She pulls her top up out of the way and opens the cup of her nursing bra. You&#39;re not sure if you&#39;re actually hungry, but your mouth automatically grabs the nipple and you start to drink her delicious milk with little regular gulps.<br />
<br />
Then your mother starts talking, but she&#39;s not exactly talking to you. &quot;Hey everyone, this won&#39;t be a full vlog, just a quick update as we&#39;re pretty busy today. We did Becky&#39;s very first commercial this morning for Cozybum diapers! She did really great, it all worked out in one take...&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly you remember who your new mother is! This is TeenMomJenny, an internet video star and influencer with millions of followers. She got pregnant at 15 and took part in &quot;OMG, I&#39;m pregnant!&quot; one of those reality TV shows about teen moms, becoming quite popular with the audience. By the time the show ended after the birth of her son Brandon, she&#39;d already started a successful web video and social media presence, earning a living by advertising all kinds of products for babies and new mothers in her videos and posts about her life as a single young mom. As Jeff, a teenage guy two years younger than her, you&#39;d never have watched any of those of course - but for a while you had a kind of crush on Jenny after seeing her in a trailer for the TV show. The breast in your mouth is one you&#39;ve thought about a lot before. You used to do frequent (unsuccessful) web searches for &quot;TeenMomJenny nude&quot; and ended up inspiring your sexual fantasies with videos of other &quot;young milfs&quot; instead, but still watched her videos occasionally. You stopped following her about two years ago as she had started talking about her new boyfriend all the time. It looks like that boyfriend is now your father - you wonder when you&#39;re going to meet him. In a way, you&#39;re now closer to Jenny than he could ever be, sharing that special bond between mom and baby with her. You&#39;re helpless and tiny, but you don&#39;t miss your strength and independence - at least not yet. You can&#39;t wait to find out what this new life will be like, and you wonder if you&#39;ll actually grow up as Becky or turn back at some point - was there a setting for that on the Chronivac? It&#39;s hard to remember. For now, you decide to listen to what Mommy is telling her audience.<br />
<br />
&quot;... and one more thing. I know I&#39;ll get a lot of angry comments trying to shame me for breastfeeding on camera, people being like &#39;You&#39;re showing off your boobs for clicks!&#39;.<br />
First, take a close look. What do you really see except the back of her head? Second, if you think that way, don&#39;t bother commenting, just don&#39;t watch my videos any more. Because there&#39;ll be a lot of breastfeeding in them in the next couple months. Because it&#39;s how my baby eats, and it&#39;s totally natural and no reason to be ashamed. PSA to all the moms out there: Breastfeeding is normal, it&#39;s nothing sexual or indecent or anything, and you can do it anywhere and anytime yout baby needs it.<br />
Becky feeds around 10 to 12 times a day at the moment, and every time it lasts between fifteen and thirty minutes, so I spend a LOT of time breastfeeding. Really a lot. She spends most of the time she&#39;s awake on the boob. Also I never know when she gets hungry. By the way that&#39;s why I&#39;m feeding her right now, we&#39;re going to pick Brandon up from school and I don&#39;t want her to get hungry and fussy along the way. When I was breastfeeding Brandon I was still, like, really careful not to do it on camera, but that was really stressful. Remember all the cuts in the videos? He&#39;d start crying and I&#39;d have to stop filming to feed him and finish later. And the hormones kinda fried my brain, really often I forgot what I was talking about so I had to watch the footage so I could continue. I knew I didn&#39;t want to deal with that again really early in the pregnancy with Becky.<br />
I&#39;m really not sure when I&#39;ll get to edit and upload this, maybe later today, maybe tomorrow. As I said, videos will be irregular until we get used to life with two kids. But I&#39;m pretty sure the birth story video will go up on Saturday - watch it and find out all about how this baby got out of that belly. See you then and have a great day. Bye-bye!&quot;<br />
<br />
You feel her moving her arm as she waves at the camera, then turns it off. &quot;I told them all about how much you eat, hungry hungry Becky!&quot; she coos at you, stroking the soft, fuzzy hair on top of your head lightly with one finger. You&#39;re still suckling and swallowing, not having any idea how much you eat. You&#39;re so tiny there can&#39;t be much space in your stomach, and Mommy&#39;s breasts are rather big, so probably there&#39;s a lot of milk in them, but it still fits inside you somehow. After some more minutes of drinking, you actually feel full and let go of the nipple. Your mother gets up with you on her shoulder, walking around patting your back lightly until you burp, spitting up a tiny bit of milk that runs down your chin and onto her.<br />
<br />
After cleaning your face and her shoulder with a wet wipe, she finally puts you in an infant car seat and fastens the straps. The car seat has a canopy attached, so you can&#39;t see much on your way to the car or inside it, but that&#39;s probably for the best since it seems to be a very hot and sunny summer day and newborns like you should probably be protected from direct sunlight. Inside the car it&#39;s very warm, and soon your onesie is soaked with sweat all over your back even though Mommy has opened all the windows. On the drive you discover the car&#39;s motion is quite calming to you, and you&#39;re almost asleep by the time you get out of the car even though the drive takes less than ten minutes. Mommy takes you with her into the school, and apparently you haven&#39;t been here before. Several kindergarteners ask her if you&#39;re Brandon&#39;s little sister, you hear a lot about how sweet and tiny you are and a few of the kids try to talk to you directly. You feel a little stressed, so you yawn and close your eyes. They all think you&#39;re asleep and it becomes very quiet around you. Then, Mommy puts you down on the floor to hug Brandon, and you open your eyes again to have a look at your big brother. You see a tall and slim blonde boy whose face looks very similar to Mommy&#39;s - by the way, you wonder what your own face looks like. He crouches down in front of your carrier. &quot;Hey Becky!&quot; he greets you and gives you a wet kiss on your forehead. &quot;Can I carry her?&quot; he asks Mommy -  he seems to be taking his big brother role very seriously, carrying you back to the car very carefully. When you&#39;re all in the car and ready to go, he asks Mommy &quot;Are we going right home?&quot;</p>
