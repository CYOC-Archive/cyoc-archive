<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I...see.&quot; James looked down, knowing that he only had a few choices, and not many of them were good ones with his goals in mind. He didn&#39;t exactly have circus employment on his to do list, especially after this. And he couldn&#39;t see himself going all the way. Or staying as this half-dog half-man creature. He panted and huffed before answering, &quot;Alright, turn me back to...mostly human.&quot; James was relieved he could even BE mostly human after his experiences on the way there. He almost thought he was about to lose himself amidst it all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well. I will utilize the spell. Please stand back...this could get rather animate,&quot; Kayla stated in response.<br />
<br />
James wondered what she meant by that as she seemed to raise her hands, and a strange flashing white and black light emitted from them at once. Crackling bolts of green among the lights, a much, much larger show than what she used just to turn him into what he was now. He whimpered as he took in the way the lightshow was developing.<br />
<br />
And then some of the light seemed to arc and collide with his chest, and James was left feeling a hot, burning pain through his body. He snarled and whined as he felt something happening - in his head, in his body, in his arms and legs all at once. Even in his crotch. It was like a series of hot flashes followed by sudden bursts of uncomfortable arousal - like mingling pain and pleasure together until he almost fell over from the sheer intensity.<br />
<br />
James&#39; limbs slowly started to revert, keeping a hairier look all the way and his nails remained somewhat longer and sharper than normal human nails should be. He pawed at his chest and tore off his hoodie as he saw his body growing somewhat bulkier while at the same time retaining the more thin and dynamic body structure and energy levels. James gasped, &quot;It---It&#39;s...oooh...uuuurgh...&quot;<br />
<br />
His face was next, he could tell.<br />
<br />
James&#39; muzzle began painfully retracting, quickly pushing back into his face, his canid eyes returning to a more human-like configuration...but retaining their coloration from when he was a dog-man hybrid like that. He felt his urges and tendencies starting to abate, but not entirely. He still felt a few of the canine-like urges - though much less strongly than he experienced them earlier. As if his head changing back toward human also changed his mind. His head however was not fully back. Even as his ears retracted and pulled back, James felt them and noted his ears were still slightly longer than usual and his hearing finer. His olfactory abilities likewise remained intact even as his nose returned to a human appearance.<br />
<br />
James&#39; tongue returned to a more human length, but his teeth were notably sharper than usual. He panted on reflex before gasping, &quot;Oh...oh, uh...urgh...still a bit more...&quot; His body felt hot, and his hair started to pull back into him, but remained thicker on his chest and shadowing his abdomen. He also noted, going by the hair, it seemed he was staying a blond.<br />
<br />
His tail retracted by and large back up into him, but remained in some tiny fashion, much less uncomfortable in pants and boxer shorts. Suddenly, James felt a spike of erotic sensation and the change oriented itself toward being more pleasurable. He gulped and gasped, roughly pushing on his manhood. &quot;Oh...oh, it feels too good, can&#39;t help myself...sorry, sorry...&quot;<br />
<br />
Even though she was the person who put him in this mess, here he was still apologizing like that.<br />
<br />
James thrust into his hand and bit his lip as he felt one last incredibly intense orgasm that almost knocked him off his feet. He pulled down his pants to check, turning away so Kayla didn&#39;t see it. He looked at a large, half-canine organ that protruded out of a lightly fuzzy sheath. Shaped mostly like a human cock, but redder than most and slightly thicker at the base and...ooh. Much more sensitive at the base. James admitted to himself that the sexual aspect had been...well, intense.<br />
<br />
So some part of him was...grateful(?) for keeping this part.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, this is as far as I can change back.&quot; James stated, looking himself over and pulling his pants back up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Kayla then explained, &quot;You may find that many of your urges have decreased in influence, but with this much remaining, you may find that your nudity and sexuality taboos are...diminished.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad to know. I&#39;ll keep that in mind.&quot; James then started to head out, just glad to leave this little confrontation mostly human. He noted as he carried his hoodie under his arm he was not nearly as shy about his body as usual. He even felt a little surprised when some of the visiting women - and even some of the men - complimented him in distinctly flirty ways. As James started to head back home though, he realized he&#39;d have a lot of cleaning to do.<br />
<br />
He sighed. At least he could do it on two legs!</p>
