<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(Author&#39;s note: There is a point later on in this chapter that many will probably find highly disturbing but it&#39;s to illustrate just how much danger werecreatures are in just by being werecreatures.)<br />
<br />
Andrew looked down and saw a couple of the security guards start to shift into wolves. He silently cursed himself for having been spotted and now having to escape again. It wouldn&#39;t be as easy as it had been last time but he didn&#39;t have much of a choice. Since there were no other trees within his jumping distance he would have to jump to the ground which would mean exposing himself to getting tackled by the wolves. There was no choice however and he thought he could take two of them though if there were more wolves then he would be in trouble. Taking a breath he quickly used his hands and feet, which he could use just like hands, to climb down to the lowest branch and launch himself in the direction of what smelled like two normals. To their credit the normals held their ground and drew their guns but their reaction speed was too slow and he was able to barrel past them without much difficulty. He smiled to himself thinking that he might get away when he felt two bodies hit his back. He had expected this so he rolled with it and in doing so was able to use the wolves own momentum to throw them off of him. That didn&#39;t last long though as the wolves recovered quickly and came back at him. One of the wolves grabbed one arm and the other grabbed the other arm in an attempt to hold him. The thought that they were going to have to get serious if they wanted to detain him crossed his mind as he let out a soft bellow and using his strength brought his arms, along with the wolves holding them, to his front. The two wolves hit each other&#39;s head with an audible crack and they staggered away on unsteady feet.<br />
<br />
Andrew was congratulating himself when he heard someone say, &quot;Now.&quot; Suddenly pain racked his body as electricity flowed through it from about ten different places. He couldn&#39;t do much except fall to the ground and twitch which is what he did. It wasn&#39;t long before the same person said, &quot;Cease,&quot; and the current cut off. Andrew just lay there panting trying to regain his wits from being tased and to try and come up with a way to escape. He heard the voice speak again saying, &quot;We need the super heavy duty restraints out here by Linna&#39;s tree. We caught someone up in it.&quot; Well it was pretty clear to Andrew at this point that he wasn&#39;t going to get away.<br />
<br />
______________<br />
<br />
Rikki looked out the window hearing the shout and then the soft bellow. &quot;What&#39;s going on out there?&quot; she asked mostly to herself and not expecting an answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure it&#39;s nothing for you to be concerned about,&quot; a woman said coming into the room.<br />
<br />
Rikki looked at her taking in her scent which she had no trouble identifying as being that of a skunk. She tilted her head and asked, &quot;Who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman smiled and said, &quot;I&#39;m Dr. Jacqueline Moreau and I&#39;ll be your doctor from now on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Rikki asked a little confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well since Frank and I are adopting you it&#39;s not in the best interest for me to be your doctor,&quot; Kathy said coming. &quot;Besides most of what I do is in the lab though I do see a few patients now and then and I am available for emergencies.&quot; She looked down a bit and said, &quot;I have some work to do but I wanted to stop in to see how you were doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m doing great except for this catheter,&quot; Rikki said shifting slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well according to your chart your vitals were stable all through the night so we can take it out and disconnect you from the monitors,&quot; Dr. Moreau said looking at a clipboard. &quot;There are some brain scans scheduled for later, nothing to worry about though, as well as a few other tests. This morning though you have an appointment with Dr. Twist so she can evaluate your mental state.&quot; She apparently saw something because she added, &quot;And don&#39;t start arguing. You may believe you&#39;re fine and that may be true but you&#39;ve been through something no one else has. It would be irresponsible of us not to have you see Dr. Twist at least once.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Rikki said sounding resigned. She thought there was nothing wrong with her mentally as this was a dream come true for her though she would accept what Dr. Moreau thought was best. &quot;When can I get out of here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like to keep you at least one more night just to be on the safe side,&quot; Dr. Moreau began, &quot;though depending on how the tests turn out you may be free to go this evening.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about clothes,&quot; Kathy said coming over. &quot;Frank and Diane will get you some after Diane gets out of school. Now I have to get to work so do as Dr. Moreau tells you.&quot; With that she gave Rikki a hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will,&quot; Rikki promised hugging Kathy back.<br />
<br />
Kathy broke the hug with a bit of a smile and then left the room. As soon as she was gone Dr. Moreau said, &quot;Alright let&#39;s get that catheter out before Dr. Twist comes in.&quot;<br />
<br />

Somewhere in South Carolina:<br />
<br />
A frightened six year old girl in a nightgown peeks her head out of a hidden room. It has been awhile since she had heard any sounds and she couldn&#39;t bear to stay hidden any longer. She quietly crept through the house until she found two furry bodies laying on the floor. &quot;Mommy? Daddy?&quot; she asked as she approached them. Suddenly she was knocked down from behind and she let out a scared shriek. Her shriek was cut short however as the man from Rikki&#39;s dream yanked the girl&#39;s head back and slid a silver knife across her throat. The girl struggled but the man just kept cutting the girl&#39;s neck until he had decapitated her. He held her head up so she could see her headless body and those of her parents before consciousness fled for the last time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Geez Butch did you have to kill the little girl too?&quot; a young man asked looking pale.<br />
<br />
&quot;This was no little girl,&quot; Butch said throwing the girl&#39;s head down and then spitting on her. &quot;This was a demon just like the two that we had already killed. Remember this Larvae, demons will try and trick you into believing that they are harmless people so they can get close enough to you to devour your flesh and soul. To that end they will appear as children, even babies so you have to be watchful. This one made the mistake of coming out of hiding and calling the other two demons Mommy and Daddy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Butch began to remove the girl&#39;s clothes and Larvae asked, &quot;Is that necessary? You&#39;ve already killed her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Butch got up and got right in Larvae&#39;s face as he said in low tones, &quot;I didn&#39;t kill a girl. I killed a demon, a thing and you best learn the distinction if you want to survive. Now I was going to do the cleansing on that thing&#39;s body myself but now you&#39;ll do it. And if you don&#39;t, well it won&#39;t be good for you. Understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
Larvae gulped and nodded that he understood. He knelt down and finished removing the girl&#39;s nightdress and underwear. &quot;Now remember to wash every bit of exposed skin and every orifice on this thing with the Holy Water,&quot; Butch said handing him a bucket of water. He just nodded and went about washing the demon&#39;s body. He knew that Butch had been hunting demons for most of his life so he knew what he was doing. Now he would have to get over this notion that demons wouldn&#39;t disguise themselves as children. Washing the outside was easy as he just had to pour the Holy Water over it. Getting the orifices was a little trickier. He had to prop the body up so he could pour the Holy Water down the throat and then hold open the sphincter to pour it into it&#39;s ass. He paused a moment when he was opening the vagina. It looked like any other vagina he had seen before except smaller and hairless. It even felt like a vagina should. He shook his head to clear the thoughts creeping into his brain. Butch had said this was a demon and that they would try to trick people. Of course that would include reproducing all of the anatomy. With a little frown on his face he poured Holy Water into the vagina and then proceeded to cleanse the head.<br />
<br />
When they were down cleansing the bodies they brought in some blessed wood and arranged a pyre. The blessed wood would create Holy Flames that would make sure the demons wouldn&#39;t be able to come back to Earth easily. They watched the flames lick hungrily at the bodies for a bit then as the fire started to spread they went out to their truck and loaded it up. &quot;Where are we going now Butch?&quot; Larvae asked as they got in.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve heard that there might be some demons in Iowa so I think we&#39;ll go there next,&quot; Butch said starting the truck. &quot;After that we&#39;ll see were the good Lord takes us.&quot;</p>
