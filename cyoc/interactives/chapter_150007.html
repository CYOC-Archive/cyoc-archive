<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;....I just think it&#39;s not healthy. Outside of school you&#39;ve been keeping to yourself and you don&#39;t go out anymore. I think I know why.  You&#39;ve gotta get over him Jen. He wasn&#39;t good boyfriend material anyway....I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is that breakups happen, but eventually you get through it. There&#39;s other fish in the sea, you can&#39;t let one bad catch stop you from living your life.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was Friday evening in late January. Lin and Jen were sitting in the school gym, the former having a talk with the latter after cheer practice. <i>You have no idea why,</i> Jen thought bitterly. She felt a little guilty, as her friend was only trying to help. But there was a <i>very</i> good reason she hadn&#39;t started to date again in the three or so months since Brad&#39;s sudden disappearance, though she&#39;d already been asked out twice. The first week had been terrible; she could barely pay attention to anything around her as she pretended to be in depression over her boyfriend&#39;s sudden departure, when in reality she was in depression over his theft (and frequent use) of her vagina. The people around her had given her some time to herself, and she had quit cheer, telling her coach that her poor spirits would be a bad influence on the team. The coach had convinced her to leave only temporarily instead, and after a month she had rejoined the team, though no longer the captain. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you&#39;re right....I just need a little more time.&quot; Jen lied. She had no intentions of dating again; her trust still badly shattered (perhaps irreversibly so) by Brad&#39;s betrayal. Not to mention, there was something very important that she no longer had that would inevitably bring up questions in any relationship. She couldn&#39;t imagine giving her heart to another man while her pussy still belonged to Brad, and she shivered at how awful it would feel going on a date or holding hands with a new beau while her douchebag ex simultaneously played with her hole. She knew it would inevitably happen, too, because Brad played with it quite a lot. She remembered the first night after his phone call, pounding her fists and feet into the bed in frustration while Brad defiled her inner sanctum again and again. Totaling eight times before the sun rose, he must have been as excited to have his new toy as Jen was despairing at being it. <br />
<br />
It was still difficult, and even now some part of her still hoped that she&#39;d wake up the next day to find her lost labia safely between her legs again. Instead, she woke up every day to find her love tunnel stretching to accommodate Brad&#39;s morning wood, either filling her or fucking her while she got ready. She often woke up to being soundlessly jackhammered, her hips jumping underneath her covers and pajamas as she gripped her pillow. Sometimes, he wouldn&#39;t finish until she was nearly at school, which necessitated her having to board the school bus and make small talk with her friends while being pounded, came in, and washed. By now she had mostly accepted that the soonest she could hunt down Brad was when she was able to move towns, but she still couldn&#39;t believe how much it sucked that this prick who had left her had free run of her vag for <i>at least</i> the rest of the school year.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about next week? There&#39;s a really good movie coming out that we can go see?&quot; Lin was trying hard to break Jennifer&#39;s reclusiveness.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll think about it Lin, that does sound fun.&quot; Jen sighed and got up. &quot;I&#39;ll see you on Monday. And Lin...thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her friend smiled back. &quot;No problem, I just don&#39;t like seeing you down in the dumps like this. We&#39;re here for you, alright? See you Monday.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen shuffled off the bleachers and headed to the bathroom. She gripped the sink and looked in the mirror as she felt him enter her. Scowling, she thought about how much the curse had derailed her whole life. The worst part was how it forced her to keep it a secret, such that even her closest friends couldn&#39;t support her. Or maybe the worst part was that the daily inconvenience of having to excuse herself whenever Brad decided to have sex with her. Or maybe the worst part was that, without any other way of achieving sexual gratification besides teasing her (thankfully safe) nipples, the only time she came was unwillingly while on the dick of someone she hated. There were a lot of terrible parts to this curse, but that didn&#39;t keep her from getting any less wet as she got speared by Brad&#39;s penis, her body automatically responding to it&#39;s sole source of pleasure, as unwanted as it was consciously for Jen.<br />
<br />
As she squeezed and milked him under her cheerleading outfit to make him finish sooner, she wished there was a way, any way, for her snatch to escape his clutches. <i>Stupid Kyle, if only <b>I</b> had some magic spell I could use...</i>Jen thought, before it struck her. <i>I still have the curse.</i> Jen tried to think of how she could use it to get her vagina back; she couldn&#39;t curse Brad, as he&#39;d blocked any line of communication to him and she didn&#39;t know where he was anymore. But she <i>could</i> curse someone else, maybe dare them to find her lost part assuming the curse worked that way. <i>But what if they pick transform?</i> She felt horrible about it, but she seriously considered using the curse to switch someone else&#39;s pussy with her own as she felt Brad pick up the pace. But who? Maybe Juana, that devout goodie two-shoes with the holier-than-thou attitude, or flat Kelsey, the goth girl who always rubbed Jen the wrong way. But if she asked one of her friends, she&#39;d feel safer if they were the ones dared to find her, not knowing how far someone like Kelsey would go to subvert her dare.<br />
<br />
Through the mental din of her increasing arousal as her hole got stretched out, she weighed her options. It was much better to ask a friend if they listened to her and chose dare, but it was much better to ask someone she didn&#39;t like if they were going to pick transform. She couldn&#39;t bear the thought of having to switch the pussy of Lin or Tyra out with hers as Brad&#39;s personal toy just because they didn&#39;t trust her when she spoke the words to them. She didn&#39;t think she could go through with it...<br />
<br />
She felt Brad slow down, the heat in her nethers smoldering as she realized it was going to be one of those evenings Brad slow-fucked her for hours.<br />
<br />
But I just might, Jen thought, as she slipped out and started walking home.<br />
<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Brad continued to watch the Asian girls make out on his screen as he lazily slipped his dick in and out of the cunt. After a few weeks, Brad had largely stopped thinking about Jen&#39;s attachment to the cunt, simply using it as a tool to jerk off in while watching porn like now. He was reminded whenever he felt it cum though, cruelly enjoying the thought of how embarrassed his ex must get whenever he made her get off. For now, though, he simply enjoyed feeling the cunt&#39;s soft folds wrapped around his cock. He especially enjoyed weekend afternoons when he didn&#39;t have tryouts for some team or another. He&#39;d spent many an afternoon in his apartment, feeling those folds shift around in pleasing ways, translating back in Glendale to Jennifer&#39;s cheerleading routines. He made a game of lasting as long as he could while Jen desperately tried to make him cum in the middle of her practice.<br />
<br />
He started lifting the cunt nearly off of him, and letting gravity settle it back down. <i>I think I like our new status much better than our old one. Strangers...with benefits.</i> He spared a glance down at the cumsleeve and harshly pounded it against his crotch a few times. The cunt tightened in shock and issued an audible queef as it&#39;s clit was mashed against his pubic bone. Brad chuckled in mild amusement before looking once more at the Asian girls.</p>
