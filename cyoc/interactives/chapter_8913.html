<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sitting in the bathroom Sean thought to himself,  &quot;so&quot; he wondered &quot;what should I do?&quot; <br />
<br />
Sean looked at the stats and amused himself with the changes he could make. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Sean?&quot; he heard Dan cry out from the living room. &quot;yeah, I’m in here!&quot; cried Sean's loud voice from the bathroom. &quot;OK!&quot; replied Dan. <br />
<br />
Dan had always been a skinny guy. He was in good shape, and lifted weights now and then, but he wasn’t big. Well, Sean could change that... He had made himself bigger, why not help Dan out there too? <br />
<br />
Dan replaced 163 pounds with 193 and set the countdown time to 30 minutes. 'this way' he thought, 'Dan can gain a pound a minute'. <br />
<br />
Sean flushed the toilet and put the remote in his pocket, washed his hands quickly and walked out, still shirtless, to see Dan, who had just gotten back from dinner with his girlfriend. Sean made note of the time from the hallway clock, which read 6:03<br />
<br />
&quot;stephy is coming over in an hour or so- she said, she had to go help her mom with something&quot; Dan spoke to Sean as he looked for some milk in the fridge. Dan looked up to see Sean, he was shocked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa! dude, you've been working out!&quot; He exclaimed, staring at Sean's large and defined torso.  &quot;how long have you been working out? you look a lot bigger than before! shit, dude!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;oh i don’t know, not very long. Yeah, I’ve gained some weight...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;dude, how could i have not noticed? you got big... ..well, anyway, stephy is coming over in a bit, and I’m not sure what we're gonna do yet. We might go out, or not.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;ok&quot; Sean replied. Dan was still looking at his torso. &quot;how could i not have noticed? well, maybe I should start working out one of these days... I’m sure steph would like that, you know, jeeze, but I bet I couldn’t pack on the pounds that fast! I know I couldn't&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;oh, you'd be surprised&quot; replied Sean, who was rather amused by this whole situation. &quot;its not so hard as you think, not anymore, anyway&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;well, ok, maybe someday we can go to the gym together, you know, that'd be pretty cool.&quot;<br />
&quot;yeah&quot; replied Sean calmly.<br />
<br />
Dan moved to the couch and turned on the television. As he began channel surfing, Sean looked back at that digital clock, which now set the time at 6:06.  Sean then moved to the couch, watching as the channels flipped by. The sky was getting a little darker now, and the sun was going to set pretty soon. Finally Dan stopped at a channel he liked... it was a history channel special about the building of the empire state building. 'figures' Sean thought to himself 'Dan wants to be an architect'. <br />
<br />
They watch television for a few minutes, and when Sean looked at the clock it read 6:14.<br />
<br />
Looking back at Dan he noticed that he had been squirming in his seat a lot, trying to get comfortable. Dan then sat up, and looked around, then stood and walked towards the kitchen. He pat himself on the stomach. &quot;Thats odd, I just ate dinner and I’m hungry.&quot; &quot;hey, did you eat anything Sean? We have still have these left overs from the Thai place&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;naw, but i'll take some of it, i was just thinking I’d go to some fast food place and get a burger, but thats cool too&quot; <br />
&quot;here, some noodles for you&quot;<br />
Dan passed the Styrofoam container towards Sean, who had just sat up. Dan looked a little bigger, his torso seemed just slightly wider as he stood there sifting though the refrigerator. Finally he pulled out the rest of his dinner. Some left over chicken and the rice and beef from that evening. He sat down quickly at the counter and scarfed down his meal. &quot;jeeze Dan, you must of been hungry&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;yeah, i suppose i was... man, i swear, my pants must have shrunk or something, they've gotten too tight on me.&quot; A slight smile crept across Sean’s face as he heard this. Meanwhile Dan started to adjust his pants. After he was finished he decided to sit back down at the television. After going through the channels again and finding nothing on Dan stood up again. By this time Sean had just finished dinner and the clock read 6:20. Sean turned around to look at Dan. He DID look bigger, he was noticeably thicker looking, his stomach was pushing on the fabric of his blue tee shirt, which now looked smaller on him. 'he must weigh, lets see... its now 6:20 about, yeah, 180... jeeze, he looks like it' His belly did protrude now, and his arms, just looking at them from the quick glance he could get, did look thicker. He had gained weight, thats for sure. <br />
<br />
&quot;I, uh, think I’m going to take a shower... a quick shower...&quot; Sean noticed the button to the top of his all-too-snug jeans was undone, and the fly pushed out. They did look awfully small on him. His thighs. Dan walked off stiffly towards the bathroom, finding it difficult in his now undersized jeans. Dan grabbed a pair of pants from his room and walked into the bathroom closing the door. <br />
<br />
Sean chuckled .'wait until he sees himself in the mirror!'.<br />
<br />
a few more minutes past, and Sean heard the shower start up for a bit, and then turn off a little later, and by that time it was 6:33. Dan was still in there, and was also, to Sean's estimation, finished growing. <br />
<br />
The door opened moments later and Dan's voice cried out. <br />
<br />
&quot;hey Sean, come here for a sec&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean was eager to see what Dan now looked like with the added weight, to see how he looked. Sean went to see what Dan wanted...<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, look at me!&quot; the large figure of Dan, standing only in his boxers, cried out &quot;did i look like this when i came home?!?&quot; He looked in a panic. <br />
<br />
Those extra pounds sure did show on him. He had grown a small, but round beer belly which now hung over his boxers, a trail of brown hair growing up it. His face looked a little rounder, and his whole upper body, his chest and arms, had grown thicker, rounder. &quot;uhh, I don’t know...&quot; Replied Sean nervously. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude! look at me! I’ve gained a hell of a lot of weight, I don’t know what’s happening to me! I’m getting huge! I cant fit into any of my pants, my shirts are all small, and even my boxers are too tight. dude, something is happening to me and... and I don’t know what!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;calm down, I’m sure you're fine&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;How much do you think i weigh now?!?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;uh, I don’t know, maybe 190 200 pounds?&quot; Sean replied <br />
<br />
&quot;dude, that damn scale tells me I weight 192, and I don’t know how I could have possibly gained so much fucking weight in just the last hour.... thats impossible!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;dude, calm down, its gonna be ok&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;what about Stephanie?!? what's she gonna think? I've never been able to gain weight in my life, and now suddenly...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;its ok!&quot; Sean exclaimed. &quot;I’ll find you something to wear!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan now looked bigger, he had a bigger body now, and nothing he'd have would fit him at the moment. <br />
<br />
Well, Sean found a pair of his biggest pants, the ones he always had to wear with a large belt. He handed them to Dan, who tried to fit into them. He did fit, but they were snug on him, but no matter what he did, even the largest of Sean's shirts still looked like a medium on him, and still showed clearly his newly expanded frame. <br />
<br />
Sean wondered what to do next, as Dan paced back and forth through the hallway, with a look of intense concern, walking back, everyone once in a while to the scale to see if he had gained any more weight. <br />
Dan liked it a little, though scared of what was happening to him, he enjoyed being bigger, he had wanted to get bigger all his life...<br />
<br />
Sean looked back at the remote, with his new stats of Dan:<br />
<br />
6', 193 lbs., 21. <br />
<br />
&quot;hmm, what next&quot; he mused...</p>
