<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">On yet a THIRD plane of reality, this one with entities equal and opposite to the ones <br />
observing Astara from the pool of blood, were flabbergasted at how this could have <br />
happened. In particular that since the treaty forbid only forcing your own way through to a <br />
mortal reality, not being called via a summons. <br />
<br />
&quot;Simple question. If it was as simple as dropping a summons book in a library for one of <br />
the &quot;666 Princesses&quot; to slip into a mortal world: WHY weren't any of them doing it en mass <br />
or why aren't we seeing it every six days?&quot; Regardless of how many princesses of the <br />
demon realm there currently were from six to seven hundred, they were still called the <br />
666 Princesses. Even when the 65th princess was impaled on an angel's spear at the peak <br />
of the civil right's movement. <br />
<br />
&quot;First, the smart ones know it'll attract way too much attention for those fixated on <br />
keeping the war between good and evil going forever or those who just value mortal life. <br />
Second, I don't think this was her plan. The portal that registered seemed to be present, <br />
but WHICH succumbus it summoned was completely random. No demon would alloy <br />
anyone to benefit from a gate except for themselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So someone, when that book got made, WANTED to summon a random succumbus? <br />
That's insane!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most people who work with creatures born out of selfishness and sadism often are.  <br />
Maybe the kid was the direct descendant of the guy who wrote the book and it was DNA <br />
locked or something similar. And the person who wrote it originally wanted to open an <br />
extra planer zoo...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where is the book now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When it finnish it's job it stopped giving out a signal, seems it only stays active when in <br />
use, thus why no one with a sixth sense noticed it before. Likely still at the school, but the <br />
poor girl was too busy being toyed with the demoness to notice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great. At least the psycho brat can't summon an army herself, she'll have to make it from <br />
scratch in that reality, and first and foremost she'd have to establish herself.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;She seems to know she's a hawk in a hatchery, which is why she's throwing sublimity to <br />
the winds it seems.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't suppose we can count on someone accidently summoning a diva and start building <br />
a counter weight to Astara's?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Since when have we been that lucky?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh right.&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
A short while before, as the school staff Astara counted them off, Astara was surprised at <br />
the number of them, but also honestly please, she could do much fun with these many <br />
humans as even save some for later fun and games, but she did ask her 'bodyguard' who <br />
each one was. The beast grunted out, &quot;Art, Music, Dancing, English, Science, Math, History,  <br />
Drama, Nurse, PE, Janitor, Counselor, Cooking, Secretary.&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked into the open book of the mind of her loyal beast to see what each of those <br />
were. She was again surprised humans taught their young so many subjects, in particular <br />
when they had such short lives to accomplish so little, seems like a waste of their tiny <br />
meaningless lives to her. She was also beginning to get a incline of just how many <br />
students were at this school. Much larger number than she first thought. It was going to <br />
be a little bit more of a challenge to paralyze ALL of them at once than she thought. Still, a <br />
bunch of anger age humans wouldn't be THAT hard to mentally impede the mortal skills <br />
of. <br />
<br />
She looked back at the staff, having gone behind a curtain along with her bodyguard <br />
before they had even begun to shuffle in (sometimes the simple tricks worked best). <br />
&quot;Fourteen? Fourteen? Heh. Much larger than I expected. Still, I guess I'll just save more for <br />
Dara to toy with than I thought.&quot; <br />
<br />
She thought for a second having heard her slave's surface thoughts and ordered, &quot;Slave, <br />
call out to 'Secretary.' To come here. And her only.&quot;<br />
<br />
The beast did so, managing a gruff but fairly good imitation of it's original voice, ordering <br />
his secretary to come but for the others to stay. Many were thinking their principle and <br />
where close to marching over there and demanding he end this stupid game. However his <br />
direct employee agreed and came behind. She only had time to gasp in shock at the <br />
creature before her before Astara came up behind her and paralyzed her. She then got to <br />
work... in no time flat the woman's clothes had dissolved into nothing and she began to <br />
rub her chest and privates falling to her knees, Astara dulling her reason and upping her <br />
hormones. The woman began to change much as the Principle had changed, only her <br />
horns were thicker and more blunt, and she was obviously female, being a slightly less <br />
muscular version of him with a duel pillow like chest, and a ring appeared on her left <br />
nipple and Astara's numerical tattoo on her right side. The female minotauress like beast <br />
bellowed. Causing many of the teachers to wonder what a COW was doing here behind the <br />
curtain. The former principle desired her... and the secretary was more than willing to give <br />
herself over to him. Her mind filling with primal needs and urges, the highest being of <br />
course to serve her.    Astara saw nothing wrong with giving her 'body guard' a harem to <br />
enjoy, and this woman as a good a place to start as any. She knew the former human's <br />
wife might mind, but she wouldn't care for long after she became like him. <br />
<br />
She however realized she was running short on time when the students about to arrive, <br />
she'd deal with the staff in a proper manner soon enough after she had dealt with the <br />
student body and created some new succubus and incubus to keep her company. Flipping <br />
the genders of the student body might be a nice trick to add shock value to their changes <br />
and weaken their mental defenses for her to make them into her kind. She'd just see if she <br />
felt like it. She of course saved Mr. Howard for Dana to transform. <br />
<br />
Finally the students assembled, she's transform the thirteen remaining staff one by one as <br />
a demonstration of her power. The principle clumsily called them in, and she applied what <br />
power she could to paralyze them. <br />
<br />
She waited until they had all gathered, let them mingle a little, then she let her power fly, <br />
leaving the majority of them helpless. She saw Dana of course wasn't effected. <br />
<br />
She created a minor light show with the school equipment and stepped onto stage. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Students of Edward Faust Middle High School! I am Astara! I'm sure I exist in a lot of <br />
your memories, but in fact, that was just a quick smoke screen, I have not been at this <br />
school except today, this morning in fact! I am Astara 564th Princess of the Realm of <br />
Demons. Yes, THOSE demons for those of you wondering, not the universal name for <br />
mythical beings in japanese mythology than you very much. But first and foremost, Dana! <br />
Please come up here now!&quot; <br />
<br />
Dana, reluctantly, did so, walking up to the stage, annoyed that taking care of the door <br />
had done nothing since Astara had now made the students unable to run. Had Astara read <br />
her mind? Or just was taking no chances? Dana knew she'd have to be more careful in the <br />
future. Since Astara didn't give a mental retort to that, Dana figure she couldn't read <br />
Dana's mind ALL the time, good, that was information she could use. Unless Astara <br />
wanted her to think that. At any rate, she'd have to test it to find out later.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Dana here is the first of what's awaiting all of you, well, not EXACTLY what fifty percent of <br />
you is going to get, but will be just a soul jarring, humiliating, and utterly damning! Dana, <br />
show off your true form please, all of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dana sighed, and let her wings, tail and all the rest come through... her clothes burned off <br />
in the process as she did so. Truth be told, she felt utterly and completely liberated, her <br />
body was a thing of beauty wasn't it? Why should SHE feel shame or humiliation at <br />
showing it to the world? They should be thanking her for giving them such a wonderful <br />
view! <br />
<br />
&quot;Good lookin' Dana! I think I'll shed this outfit too!&quot; Astara DIDN'T need to tear off her <br />
'skin' to show off her true form in a single ripping effect.. it was just for show and <br />
additional horror.  The now naked succubus princess cackled.  Naturally many of the <br />
students were now sickened, terrified, aroused, or a combination of all three.  &quot;Now ladies <br />
and gentleman, I give you your former principle!&quot; While she was talkign the floor of the <br />
auditorium/cafeteria began to change into read stone, beginning to match what was <br />
outside already. <br />
<br />
The beast stepped out obediently, the female beast following behind in his shadow. All the <br />
students gasped in horror. Dana just narrowed her eyes taking in the information. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now, we have the thirteen still members of the staff here as well, as paralyzed as you... <br />
now... we're gonna change them into unique or not so unique creatures as well to serve <br />
my cause... don't worry, after we're done here with them, and fixing up the school to be <br />
more presentable, and you've been all indoctrinated into the superior race, you'll be <br />
bringing in your families to live here as well also improved as the dear principle has.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NO you won't you bitch!&quot; Screamed a blond haired girl in a blue dress at the top of her <br />
lungs, breaking Astara's paralyze and making a kamakazi dive at the demon princess. <br />
Astara flicked her wrist, and a spear of flame impale the girl through the heart and out the <br />
other side. She fell foreword, a look of shock on her face, she didn't get up. <br />
<br />
Astara blinked, &quot;An underage HUMAN managed to break my paralyze? Geeze how stupid.&quot; <br />
She waved it off, the other students cowed by the example.  &quot;Now then, back on topic, <br />
we're gonna change the staff, and with each staff member, some of you, now, shall we <br />
change them all at once, or one at a time? Who shall be the first among my thirteen! <br />
Dana... I promised you Mr. Howard, and you have him, transform him into any creature of <br />
evil and chaos you desire...&quot; She gestured at the paralyzed but complete horrified middle <br />
aged man. Dana looked at Mr. Howard cooly and objectively.</p>
