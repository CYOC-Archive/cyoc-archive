<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">-----------------------<br />
Next morning Jeff woke up and the first thing he notices was that the room was smaller. It wasn&#39;t like he was a giant anymore, he was a 8-years old child. Well, his height was about 5 feet tall and his muscles were far from 8-years old, but his mind told him that it was truth. Suddenly, someone was knocking the door.<br />
&quot;Jeffery, you need to get up.&quot; Derek said. &quot;The breakfast is on the table and your dad is leaving in 15 minutes. After that you have to brush the teeth.&quot;<br />
He went downstairs, everything was so big. Unexpectidly big. When he came over the dinner table he saw two muscled giants, his fathers. One, Elias, was about 14 feet 6, with dark blonde hair, while Derek was even bigger. He had black hair everywhere and his beard was thick. They were naked and Jeff was able to see their cocks toching the table under the surface, licking with precum. Jeff himself were lower than the table.<br />
&quot;Good morning, son.&quot; Derek said with his deep voice. &quot;Time for breakfast. Sleep is good for growth, but you need to eat properly&quot; He grinned. <br />
&quot;Good morning, dad. Ehmm... where is my breakfast?&quot; asked Jeff, slowly approaching to the table. <br />
&quot;Come here, little boy.&quot; Elias smiled and took a plate with a pancakes pile from the table and gave it to his husband. &quot;Wait till the souce, honey&quot; he said to Jeff.<br />
Derek put the plate on the floor and started to strocking his cock. &quot;It will be tasty&quot; he said and his cock spurted a thick white liquid on the pancakes. He did it again, and again, until the plate was full of a hot cum.<br />
&quot;Now, you can eat&quot;<br />
&quot;Where should I sit?&quot; Jeff asked<br />
&quot;Small people are eating from the floor&quot; Derek replied rudly.<br />
Jeff sat on the floor and took the first bite. The flavor was indescrible.<br />
&quot;How is it, son? It&#39;s good, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Elias asked.<br />
&quot;Yes, Dad. Thank you, Daddy.&quot; Jeff replied. He didn&#39;t lie. The food was delicious, and Jeff knew exactly what ingredient made it.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be greedy. You can get more when you finish this&quot; Elias said.<br />
Jeff was a little bit embarrased, but he couldn&#39;t stop his hands. He took a pancake from the pile and stuffed his mouth. After a moment the plate was clean and his belly was bulging. He felt like a pig.<br />
&quot;Wow. Good appetite, son.&quot; Alias gave him another pile. &quot;Sorry, but this one made by me...&quot; <br />
Jeff&#39;s belly was rounded, but he still fell hungry. So he took the next pancake and swallowed it. <br />
&quot;...with a lot of love&quot; the huge bodybuilder smiled.<br />
When Jeff finished it he fell sleepy, but his father told him that he needed to scale him. He put his son on his chest and went to the bathroom. He put Jeff on huge platform and grab the notebook from the shelf.<br />
&quot;OK, the number is 170 pounds&quot; said Derek, when he put the pen on the chart.<br />
&quot;Wow, you&#39;re growing fast, son. 5 pounds a day. I&#39;m so proud.&quot; said Elias.<br />
Jeff was sleeping on the platform, dreaming he grow bigger and huger. He woked up to eat his lunch, dinner and late dinner, when Derek was back. His body were utilizing all hormons, nutrients and energy to grow his body. <br />
After six years past.<br />
Jeff opened his eyes. He was 12 feet 4 and his muscles were very defined. He was sitting on a bed, his long, curved cock was laying between his legs, almost 15 inches. His body was hairless. Young and unmature. He went downstairs.<br />
&quot;Good morning, dad&quot; said to Elias, who was making his breakfast.<br />
&quot;Good morning, son.&quot; answered, looking him from back.<br />
Jeff was a huge, 14 years old bodybuilder. He was visiting a &quot;Big Boys&quot; school, created for the gifted guys as he was. His shoulders were wider than his hips, his arms were almost 4 feet long, with huge, veiny biceps. He was the biggest guy in his class, and he was even bigger than mostly everyone in the next year. When he became the huggest teen among his age, Derek allowed him to sit with him and Alias at the table. He was very happy and proud, when his dads were talking with him.<br />
Six plates of pancakes covered with his dads&#39; special sause, two dozens of boiled egg and eight chicken breasts were laid on the table and waiting for him. Yound titan sat at the narrow side and started to eat. He swallowed pancakes in few bites, he was able to take four at the time. Two eggs in his hand and the other in his mouth, then, in the same time he was drinking milk, he took the chicken breast with the other and started to munch it. His dads were talking and joking, but his mouth was always full of food. He was so hungry. When he was finished with the pancakes, he took the bowl and swallowed all of the sauce. When he noticed that his plates were empty, he tried to grab one belongs to Derek. <br />
&quot;Hey! Hands off!&quot; he grunted. Derek hit with hand the Jeff&#39;s palm.<br />
&quot;Sorry, Dad. I&#39;m still hungry.&quot; Jeff&#39;s arm were red.<br />
&quot;I dont care, tiny&quot; Derek replied and grabbed Jeff&#39;s wrist. &quot;You don&#39;t eat from my plate, understood?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sorry, Dad.&quot;<br />
&quot;And you should thank me, because I didn&#39;t break your arm.&quot;<br />
Derek finished his breakfast and squezzed his massive muscled body between the edge of the table and a wall. He dressed up and left to the office. <br />
&quot;If you are hundgry, Jeffrey, I can make you more. What do you want, honey?&quot; Elias asked<br />
&quot;More pancakes. Please. And chicken. And eggs. And anything else.&quot; Jeff answered.<br />
&quot;Of course, baby.&quot; his dad smiled and took his plate.<br />
Jeff was eating the last bite, when Alias told him that bus came. Jeff kissed him and left. <br />
-----<br />
After two years.<br />
Jeff was in the class and was working on his homework. He was so bored, because the teachers were telling him about the things that he already knew. He was 16 feet 2 and he was the biggest kid on the Earth. There were one person bigger than him, but they were adult. He was sitting and his head was on the same level with the blackboard. He was so bored and his cock was throbbing in his jeans.<br />
Suddenly the bell rang and Jeff rushed to the gym. He had his PE with a teacher, who was the smallest person in his class. The only one, who could be able to order him. But not really.<br />
&quot;Good afternoon, Mr. Johnson. I&#39;m ready for the workout.&quot; Jeff said, when he entered the room.<br />
&quot;Hello, Jeffrey.&quot; teacher replied. &quot;We will work today on the benchpress. And if you want to eat your lunch, you need to lift 1 ton.<br />
&quot;Oh, I think I can handle it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really? Let&#39;s see.&quot;<br />
Jeff layed on the bench and put the bar on his chest. He was holding it easily, because his arms were thicker than the steel.<br />
&quot;One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.&quot; he lifted it ten times, without sweating.<br />
&quot;You should put more weight.&quot; Mr. Johnson was a little bit scared.<br />
&quot;You know, I&#39;m a little bit hungry.&quot; Jeff smirked.<br />
&quot;I will give you one piece of pie for each rep, if you manage to lift the whole thing. OK?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sounds fair. What is the pie?<br />
&quot;Your father brought it.&quot;<br />
Jeff&#39;s heart skipped a beat.<br />
&quot;My father? Which one?&quot;<br />
&quot;Elias. Derek sent him to make sure you eat your fill, so don&#39;t gobble it all down too fast, OK, big guy?&quot; the teacher smirked.<br />
&quot;Yes sir.&quot;<br />
When Jeff was at home, Elias was waitning him on the kitchen. &quot;Happy birtday, my dear son!&quot; A huge cake was scraping the ceiling. There were sixteen candles.<br />
&quot;Wow. Is it mine?&quot; asked Jeff.<br />
&quot;Yes. We know that you will love it.&quot; Elias replied. &quot;Make a wish.&quot;<br />
Jeff closed his eyes and wished himself that the cake would be the best dessert that he ever ate. He blew out the candles and the dads started to cut the cake. The huge slices were given to him and Jeff devoured them quickly. When the whole cake was in his belly, Jeff started to feel a little bit thirsty. <br />
&quot;Dad, can you pass me the water, please. I&#39;m thirsty&quot; he said to Alias.<br />
&quot;Heh, boy&quot; said Derek &quot;I know the beverage you&#39;d like to drink&quot;<br />
He was holding his fat cock and smeared a precum on Jeff&#39;s lips. Jeff tried to step back, but Derek was bigger and stronger, so he put a hand on his son&#39;s head and forced him to suck.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong, tiny?&quot; Derek said &quot;Don&#39;t you wanna drink? Your father made the best sauce for you, he has a gift.&quot;<br />
Jeff had no choice, but suck Derek&#39;s cock. But after the first taste of the hot liquid, Jeff started to suck him eagerly, wanting more of that nectar. Derek smiled and forced him to deepthroat his giant rod, holding him by his head. After few minutes of blowjob he cummed hard in Jeff&#39;s belly. Derek closed his eyes in pleasure and moaned. He pushed Jeff&#39;s face hard in his crotch, but Jeff was eager and swallowing his cock in the base. Derek remove his hand from Jeff&#39;s head and leaned. Derek&#39;s huge balls pulsed and released a huge load. And again, and again.<br />
Derek opened his eyes, because he heard a strange scratcy sound. He saw that his son&#39;s back filled the distance between walls, his enormous pecs covered with thick hair were holding Derek&#39;s cock. His cock was longer than his father&#39;s and thicker than his hand. Derek stood up and Jeff also raised. His dad was now somewhere near his niples. Somewhere, because his pillows were so huge, that he was unable to see anything standing too close. <br />
Jeff felt that his body started to ache. His biceps started to expand, his triceps began to pop veins on his arm. His calves grew even thicker and his quadriceps became bigger than before. He moaned loudly when his legs expanded so fast, that his pants broke into pieces, letting his cock and huge balls to stand in freedom. The jeans were cut by a sheer force of growth in few second, exposing his muscled hairy thighs. Jeff&#39;s body started to widen and his t-shirt also couldn&#39;t hold his bulging pecs and massive lats. Jeff&#39;s bodybuilder dad&#39;s body started to look like a small model.<br />
Jeff wasn&#39;t able to move, their kitchen was too small for that. His stomach began to rumble.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m hungry...&quot; he groaned, still holding his father&#39;s cock in his hand. &quot;I&#39;m... hungry... I&#39;m very very hungry&quot;<br />
He looked down at his father, and started to rise him with one hand, keeping holding the cock in another. <br />
&quot;Jeff, son, please, stop&quot; Derek was  frightned.<br />
But Jeff didn&#39;t want listen. His thoughts were about his hunger.<br />
&quot;Tiny people are not allowed to boss me around any more! I&#39;m hungry, you tiny!&quot; he growled. He didn&#39;t noticed that his voice started to change, touching so deep sounds that were almost unhuman. &quot;And now I need to be fed&quot; he grabbed Derek by his huge neck and squeezed his balls to extract more juice from him.<br />
Later, when Derek was much far from what he usually called &#39;exhausted&#39;, Jeff put his father on the floor and left the house trought the wall.</p>
