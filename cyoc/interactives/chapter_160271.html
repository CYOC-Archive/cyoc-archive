<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once the initial high of his orgasmic transformation into a man-bull hybrid began to settle down, John felt a ringing pain in his ears from the sound of nearly a dozen men in front of him all letting out blood-chilling cries, powerful enough to wake the dead. He could remember they were his fellow soldiers, each of them a buddy he’d made and gotten close with over some casual experience or a more serious one. And now, watching them fall into chaos over the same wild change that had overtaken him was upsetting enough to break his heart in two.<br />
<br />
It seemed like hypersensitive hearing was something that came alongside the change, probably with a set of other improvements he couldn’t be too sure of because his vision was still a little blurred and his head was still reeling in the aftermath. He did still have a good sense of who he was, though, and perhaps an even more awakened sense of what he was, judging by the virile energy that coursed strongly through his veins. Everything about him was at the peak of masculinity, from his overgrown inhuman musculature to his almost grotesquely large private and cadets. The feeling of it—just existing right now as something so fierce—a brand new lease on life, and John was sure it was something he would love getting used to.<br />
<br />
“Guys, you gotta help me!” John heard a man beg above the muttering crowd. He still looked mostly human except for the long, black member exposed between his fly.<br />
<br />
“Jesus fuck, Adam!” said White, the squad leader, as he held out his arm to cover a pair of terrified soldiers behind him. “What the hell’s infecting my team?”<br />
<br />
John’s eyes then naturally fell on the more interesting picture of what was happening with Mark doubled over, fatigues half torn, and rapidly gaining size with a rather unique look on his face. It was something like either shock or exhilaration, but most likely a vague blending of each. He winced in agony at the sight of his fingers joining into three thick, unwieldy appendages and at the rich tan-colored fur spreading up his arms.<br />
<br />
“Mmmngh...Ooohh...Mruuu...” He switched between making soft groans and animalistic grunts while rocking his hips, humping the air on his knees. Sometime through it, his uniform gave its last resistance. As boulder-like quads split apart his pant legs and a broadening frame popped off every button on his shirt, revealing deeply fissured pecs and armor-plated abs, his clothing fell in tatters around him. Mark’s altered penis shot out, freed from its confines, and felt the caress of the desert air at noon, warm enough to make his monster balls drop down low and comfy.<br />
<br />
“Oh, God, that’s so wrong!” yelled Tyrone, another uninfected soldier. “Mark, stay with us, man!” He bravely ran up and laid his hands on the soon-to-be minotaur’s shoulders.<br />
<br />
“Idiot! Get away from there.” Sergeant White tried to warn him, but it was already too late.<br />
<br />
Right when he thought his ginormous neck muscles would swallow up his head, Mark’s horns grew to their full menacing length through his skull, and with them his face painfully reshaped into a bull’s snout, grown to proportion. His rutting continued as dark thoughts of all the people he could dominate with his new body took hold of his mind. He let out one terrifying bellow to signal his climax, loosing balance on his knees and falling over backwards in the process. The first spray of cum launched far enough to hit Tyrone square in the jaw, while the rest of it sputtered on the bull-man’s heaving chest and stomach. He was a true beast now, through and through.<br />
<br />
“Someone report this to command immediately!” White ordered, nearing the end of his wits. “We need to work to contain this, or else it’ll—” Suddenly, he felt something splatter against the nape of his neck accompanied by a soft moan from behind.<br />
<br />
Sergeant White spun around on his heels, full of dread, realizing he’d just let his back be turned on something important. Adam was looming behind him, grown to almost double his previous height and width, face half distorted into an approximation of a steer’s with features still recognizable as his. He held his ebony cock in one hand along with an expression of pure relief as White saw the shaft dribbling milky liquid down its side. Afraid he already knew what was there, White reached around himself and felt the wet, sticky cum soaking into his backside.<br />
<br />
“Agh! Oh, God, me too..” He heard one of the soldiers he’d been shielding yell. The young man’s dick had grown to the size of a beer bottle and was fitting to break free of his pants. “Oh, fuuuck, it feels good...Ahh! Annggh! So, so fuckin’ good...” Quickly, the soldier then went to work unbuttoning his uniform and reaching in to fondle himself.<br />
<br />
While all this happened, John had collected enough of his senses to take a second look at what became of him and was now sure it was something to count as a blessing. And looking over at the hulking beasts Mark and Adam became, too, only made him more confident in the decision. They were both so majestically built and perversely sexual, and each was probably strong enough now to take on a whole battalion with just his fists. John had so many questions circling through his mind, about how all this was possible and how far the spread of it would go. He was sure his buddies also had their own. But now wasn’t the time for him to dwell on such things. Now was the time for him to step up as the first to be reborn and help his fellow army men come to understand just how incredible he could make them. With nothing but excitement for the future, John lumbered over to rejoin the group, his cock erecting with the thrill of what he was about to do.</p>
