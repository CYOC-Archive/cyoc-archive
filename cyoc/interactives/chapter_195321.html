<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your eyes went wide as you looked at the reflection, what you saw was a young boy looking around 6 years old. After examining your reflection for a few moments, you were still able to recognize yourself, the face looked somewhat like you remembered, blue eyes, olive skin, and brown hair that looked like it hasn&#39;t been cut in along time. The only big difference was a yellow ring around you pupils and that your penis was a bit bigger than it should be and it now had foreskin that covered your glands making it look almost like a tentacle. <br />
<br />
Confused and a little scared you looked back up at your father hopping that he&#39;ll explain what&#39;s happening. He takes a deep breath before putting down the mirror and saying &quot;wen they finally found you there was barely anything left.&quot; &quot;Amazingly you were sill alive&quot; he continued &quot;your brain and most of your organs were intact.&quot; &quot;But we were fighting a losing battle just to keep you alive&quot; he said &quot;some even suggested that it would be beater to just pull the plug.&quot; <br />
 <br />
&quot;That&#39;s when your father decided it would be a good idea to do something reckless&quot; mom said. Your father shifted uncomfortably before saying &quot;some of my colleagues and I were assigned to a top secret project.&quot; &quot;A new chemical was discovered that possessed incredible regenerative capabilities, we were tasked with studying the long term effects on living beings.&quot; &quot;The hope was that we could use it to revolutionize the medical industry, regenerating lost limbs and in your case restoring your entire body from almost nothing.&quot; he let out a long sigh before continuing &quot;but as your mother pointed out I did something reckless, we weren&#39;t ready to start human trials and some lab animals have exhibited some... unusual mutations from long term exposer.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It was so cool&quot; Kenneth chimed in &quot;you were put inside this big tube with glowing liquid and your body just slowly started growing back.&quot; &quot;You actually looked like a baby for a few days, I took a few pictures if you want see them.&quot; &quot;We could have left you in there a little longer so that you could have been your proper age&quot; dad said &quot;but we decided against it as you were already exhibiting a few mutations.&quot; Your eyes drift down to your cock felling a little embarrassed by the fact that every one can see your naked body. Seeming to sense this mom pulled the sheets back over you before saying &quot;your father almost lost his job when they discovered what he had done.&quot; &quot;Thankfully they decided to allow the procedure not only because you wouldn&#39;t have survived without it&quot; dad said &quot;but it also gave us an opportunity to see how the chemical would effect the human body.&quot; &quot;They did however make it clear that if the procedure failed I would have lost my medical license, needless to say... Max I am so glad that you&#39;re alive.&quot; <br />
<br />
That was the fist time you ever herd your father get choked up, normally he comes off as completely emotionless. You often wondered if he even cared about you or any one for that mater, but now you realize that he wouldn&#39;t have done this if he didn&#39;t. The next few weeks were spent in physical therapy, it was frustrating at first you even broke down a few times scared that you mite not be able move normally again. But over time you began to make progress and soon you were able to run, jump, climb, and lift things without any issues. The Doctors also preformed other experiments taking samples of your blood, skin, hair, and some other fluids. They&#39;ve also been testing your mental abilities making sure that you haven&#39;t experienced any phycological damage. You were relived to find that there were no obvious gaps in your memory and that you didn&#39;t regress to the mind of a 6 year old in fact you were a little smarter than you used to be. <br />
<br />
Eventually you were finally cleared to go home, on the way your mom took some time to explain a few things. Firstly your not famous the government coved up the details of your accident very thoroughly. Secondly not only did the government cover the medical bills they also gave them a replacement car and it was very nice. Your mom also explained that since you passed all of the tests you will not be required to go bake to school but you could if you wanted to. You weren&#39;t sure what you wanted to do and decided to take some time to think about it. For the rest of the way home your 13 year old brother Ken showed you all the photos he had taken. <br />
<br />
You were disturbed by the images showing just how badly mangled you had been, you had lost your entire lower body, the left arm ended at the elbow, the right arm was just gone, you were missing the left eye, and a good potion of your jaw was also gone. You start to feel yourself getting emotional as the reality of what you had been through sank in. You give you brother a hug and decided to apologize for being such a lousy person over the years. The rest the car ride was spent with you cuddling up to Ken as he flipped through the rest of the pictures. Showing your body being lowered into glowing liquid before being reshaped into what looked like baby and finally growing into the 6 year old body you had now. <br />
<br />
When you finally got home you were relived to find that they didn&#39;t give you a smaller bed still having the queen sized bed you had before. There was a stool just incase you had trouble climbing into bed and it looked like the sheets were replaced for new ones. It looked like the hole room had been cleaned, thankfully most of your stuff was still there. What was different was that your old cloths were replaced with new stuff that could fit and interestingly in the corner there was a massive teddy bear holding a sign that said &quot;welcome home Max&quot; next to it were a few toys things you liked wen you were younger. You lay down on the bear as you think to yourself (this might not be so bad).</p>
