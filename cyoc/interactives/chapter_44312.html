<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For Carly, life became a simple but pleasurable routine. Wake up in the morning and fuck Hambone. Some days they went to a new town on his Hog with Carly wrapping her arms around Hambone and pressing her huge big tits against his back. Other days were spent in town. Often when that happened, Hambone had business to conduct. She asked no questions about what he did; for some reason, it was beyond her to ask why. He was a man and did what he did. When business had to be done, Hambone would drop her off with some guy. Hambone would tell her to do what he wanted but he hardly needed to tell her to do so. Carly was happy to do what any available man told her to do.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, she wondered if she was a whore but then she remembered what Hambone said; she was a pair of tits and a cunt. If she got Hambone some money for doing what she did for fun, being a whore for Hambone was the least she could do.<br />
<br />
Most nights were spent in bars. While she often was hanging onto Hambone, she did what she could to show off her tits and ass to everyone else in the bar. She loved it when she was under a table, sucking on Hambone's cock while he was conducting business. She also loved it when she sucked off the other guy. Often, she went with some guy from the bar.<br />
<br />
But no matter how many men used her during the day, she loved Hambone. Hambone always picked her up at the end of the night. They always fucked before falling asleep in their motel room.<br />
<br />
Carly did not concern herself about much, that was Hambone's job. Sometimes fixing a meal. Making sure there was cold beer and smokes. Making sure she was properly make up when she went out. Most of the time, Carly had no idea what town she was in, let alone what state.<br />
<br />
But Carly had fun! She got to fuck, smoke and drink as much as she could take.  Sometimes she wondered why she did not get sick or pregnant. But she was grateful it never happened. Sometimes, she had fleeting memories of being a man and of Marion Carter. But that made her upset so she would go back to doing one of her three favorite things.<br />
<br />
One day, it was different. She recognized that she was back in the city where she used to live, when she was a married man. Despite the vibration of the motorcycle moving the piercings of her clit and tits, she could not dismiss her hazy images of her old life.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know where you are at, bitch?&quot;<br />
<br />
She wants to deny that she does but she cannot lie to her man. Carly looks at the ground and says, &quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hambone smirks. &quot;If you remember where you used to live, you can take a taxi over there to see her.&quot; He drops a wad of money on the table. &quot;I did not think enough of your old self was left to remember.&quot; With that, he walks out the door.<br />
<br />
Carly was dumbfounded. For the first time since she became Hambone's fucktoy, she could do something she wanted to do. Well, she did want to be fucked by every guy that Hambone sent her way but this was different. Her wife's name came back to her, Marion Brown. After an other moment of thought, she could remember her old address. She could even remember what her wife and house looked like. But she could not recall her old name or what she used to look like, let alone what it could be like to be a man.<br />
<br />
Carly had to go back home. She had enough time to get cleaned up before Marion got home, if she remember right. But she had little reason to trust her memory. She could not even remember Marion's cell phone number. Hey, Carley thought, why did I not think of that before?<br />
<br />
Carly put on her best clothes, skin tight jeans and high heeled calf high boots. She wears a tee that says &quot;Save A Virgin. Do Me.&quot; only because it is the only one that covers her belly. It was just as well, her other tees said &quot;I Swallow&quot;, &quot;Look Here&quot; and &quot;Every One Loves A Slutty Girl&quot;. She makes sure her make up is alright and is ready to go.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Marion Brown looks out the peephole. She sees an over made up, over endowed and bleached blond young woman. And that shirt, just tacky. She opens the door a crack. &quot;What do you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Marion! Let me in! I know where your husband is!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know where David is?&quot; This is the first news she has heard of him in three months. She opens the door to let the young slut in.<br />
<br />
The young woman stands for a couple of beats, staring at her, before she comes in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have a seat. Do you want anything to drink?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Beer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marion smiled. Big surprise there, that this woman wants a drink. But need over comes her reluctance. Maybe this slut has creditable information.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Carly is shocked. Marion is real and the house is real. But the name of David means nothing. And she could not imagine living in this house. Thinking even more, yes, Marion is pretty enough. But she seems too uptight. In fact, she is the type of woman that Hambone and his friends show such contempt for. Did she even love Marion?<br />
<br />
Marion comes back and hands her an open bottle. Carly downs half of the beer and belches. Carly sets herself to explain the impossible. &quot;This will be hard to believe but I am your husband. This man raped me and I became...&quot;<br />
<br />
Marion jumps to her feet and screams, &quot;Get out you fucking stupid whore! How fucking dare you play with me like this!&quot;<br />
<br />
Carly finds herself being picked up and pushed to the door by this woman who used to be her wife. She takes a swing at Marion's face and races to the door. She does not need this kind of bullshit. Marion's ducking away from her punch give Carly enough time to run out the door.<br />
<br />
Once out the door, Carly turned to screamed, &quot;No wonder why he left your uptight ass! You have no idea about how to be a woman and treat your man right!&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, she lights up a cigarette and stomps down the street, searching for a taxi. Once in the taxi, she thought about who she now was. While she might have loved that bitch at some point, she did not even want to live that kind of life now. She loved her freedom, being able to drink and smoke when she wanted and being fucking by any willing man. She loved how sexy she was and how most men stared at her. She loved that Hambone  made all of the hard decisions for her, making it easy for her to find some action. She loved that Hambone was a real man and knew how to treat a bitch like her. She loved Hambone because he made her into a slut she loved being. She could not wait to get back to the motel room and reward him.<br />
<br />
When she got back, Hanbome was sitting on the bed. &quot;How did your visit go?&quot;<br />
<br />
I smiled. I pulled off my shirt and slipped off my bra. I jumped on the bed on top of Hambone. I squirmed to his pants, undid his fly and pulled down his jeans. After I pulled down his underwear. I licked his shaft and balls until he became erect. I never been so happy to suck off his full penis.</p>
