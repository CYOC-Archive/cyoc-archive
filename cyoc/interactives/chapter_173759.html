<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">So, Scott took a shower, briefly inspecting his new youthful little nuts and the little nubber between them. The smooth little marbles were pulled up tight. <br />
<br />
&quot;Great,  my balls haven&#39;t even dropped yet,&quot; he sighed. <br />
<br />
He started washing himself,  amazed at how little and smooth each of his body parts were. His feet,  toes,  thighs,  arms,  and even his torso. Everything about him was so....SMALL! Yet,  he was able to move about in ways he hadn&#39;t in decades. He felt....GOOD! Young,  healthy,  and energized. Pergaps too young though. <br />
<br />
In any case,  he had to finish showering. Dried off, and forced himself to wear the clothes of a Catholic school boy. They were baggy. A bit too big. And these were the smallest clothes he could find. But they would do. Just a reminder he was now smaller than Harry, as he was wearing clothes that he had already grown out of. A set of clothes his 12 year old son would never wear again,  and they fit on Scott&#39;s smaller little frame.<br />
<br />
Sighing again,  he went to brush his teeth. His new teeth! One of his adult canines was growing in. But his front teeth were already fully-grown,  brand new adult teeth that hadnt started getting worn down yet. Big and bright, they looked like a couple of chicklet candies stuck in his small mouth. <br />
<br />
&quot;These look ridiculous,&quot; he thought as he rolled his eyes. But he had to push that aside and brush his new teeth that belonged to a 10 year old Harry.<br />
<br />
Finishing up in the bathroom, he ran downstairs where Angela was finished makings bacon and eggs. His lunch was already packed and sitting on the counter in a brown paper bag. Well, at least he didnt have a ridiculous lunch pail. At the age of 12, kids start growing out of that. And he was supposed to be 12 years old to the rest of the world. <br />
<br />
He hurried over and took his seat where Harry sat, rather than his own customary spot at the head of the table. That&#39;s where his mom.....eerrr...Angela....placed his plat of food. <br />
<br />
Scott was hungry, and started digging in.<br />
<br />
Behind the scenes, he didnt know his new mother was worried about him. Scott, as himself, never &quot;came home.&quot; And she had no idea where he was. She tried keept it under the lid in front of who she thought was her boy, so as not to worry him. But he seemed smaller. He looked younger. Maybe he wasn&#39;t eating enough?<br />
<br />
As she thought those rambling thoughts, Scott got halfway through his breakfast, and started feeling full. That fast!? He was full already!? Of course he was. He was now a child, with a child-sized appetite. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m full,&quot; he announced.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you didnt eat all of your eggs,&quot; Angela said worriedly. &quot;I guess he isn&#39;t eating enough,&quot; she thought. &quot;Maybe he&#39;s sick....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you feeling alright honey?&quot; she asked the man-turned-boy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m fine. Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s that you seemed to have lost some weight. And you didn&#39;t finish eating your breakfast.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just not hungry, &quot; Scott said. <br />
<br />
He really was full, and couldn&#39;t eat another bite.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, well, if you feel funny at school, don&#39;t be afraid to go to the nurse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;School. A school nurse,&quot; Scott thought. Just another humiliation of a man stuck as a child. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok,  well, time for you to catch your bus, &quot; said his new mother. Yet another piece of humiliation. He has to ride in a big yellow bus that&#39;s now &quot;his.&quot;<br />
<br />
But he had a duty to fulfill. He got uo from the much larger table, and headed for the front door.<br />
<br />
Clearing her throat, Angel said: &quot;aren&#39;t your forgetting something?&quot; as she held out his lunch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah&quot; he went over to grab it, and headed for the door again.<br />
<br />
&quot;.....and...?&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Stopping in his tracks...<br />
<br />
&quot;....and?&quot; he thought. He wasn&#39;t missing anything else.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your bookbag? And your jacket?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My bookba-&quot; he thought, and stopped.  &quot;Christ! I have a bookbag now! Harry&#39;s! Dammit, this marks me as a kid as much as anything else.&quot;<br />
<br />
He went over to where Harry kept his bookbag. At least it wasn&#39;t a gaudy, childish one. It was black with red trim. It was actually pretty cool looking. It was weird to approach Harry&#39;s bookbag. A tool he carried with him to school everyday. Now it&#39;s his and all the contents in it. He inherited a school bag from a 12 year old boy.... Ugh!<br />
<br />
To make matters worse, it was kind of heavy!<br />
<br />
&quot;And your jacket.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jacket? But it&#39;s warm outside,&quot; he protested in his high-pitched childish voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, uh!&quot; his new mother lectured. &quot;It might rain or get cold later. You&#39;ve already been losing weight lately as it is. I&#39;ll need to make a doctor&#39;s appointment for you later.&quot;<br />
<br />
He knew any further protest would be pointless. Plus, he would miss his...errr....Harry&#39;s....bus. And he knew that would bring on even more pain in the ass grownup lectures. <br />
<br />
&quot;God, being a kid sucks already,&quot; he grumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you say young man?&quot;<br />
<br />
Scott looked over, and up, at Angela. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, nothing&quot; he said as he out the dang thing on. And it, too,  was large and baggy on him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I knew it! You ARE losing weight!&quot; she said at his pathetic little image. &quot;But it&#39;ll have to do for now. It doesn&#39;t look TOO bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sighing, he picked up the heavy bag again.<br />
<br />
&quot;How does Harry do it?&quot; he thought. &quot;This bag is so heav-.....of course!&quot; he stopped himself.&quot; Harry is bigger and stronger than the body I currently occupy.&quot;<br />
<br />
But, he managed to sling the bag over his shoulders, and walked out the door as a Catholic school boy for the very first time.</p>
