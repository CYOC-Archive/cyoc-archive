<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Among the nearly limitless options on this portable chronivac thingy was one labled “neck-down swap”. The thought of having his dad’s body made Aaron want to read more.<br />
<br />
The description was as follows: “Swap targets will obtain all of each other’s body parts save for the head and neck. In cases of large size differences or skin color differences, we recommend use of the ‘head and neck’ augmentation toggle, which makes as minor adjustments as possible to the head and neck in order to make them ‘match’ the new body parts. These adjustments never include changing the age of the neck and head.”<br />
<br />
“A little wordy, but I think it makes sense,” said Aaron aloud.<br />
<br />
Aaron entered himself and his father, Dave, as swap targets and checked the box for head and neck augmentation. He didn’t want his smaller head and neck messing up his experience with his dad’s body. The transformation was set to instantaneously occur five minutes from now.<br />
<br />
Aaron went down in his father’s “den” in the basement. He and his father regularly hung out and watched tv together down there. Aaron loved when his dad would fall asleep and he could stare at his dad’s crotch bulge. He’d never seen his dad naked, but from what he had seen through his sweatpants looked like a very promising package. This was a far cry from Aaron’s little package. Aaron had a two inch penis that got to about four inches hard. Since he was gay, this wouldn’t be a deal breaker for most potential boyfriends, but they would most likely assume that he’s just a bottom, and Aaron had a curiosity for bottoming and topping.<br />
<br />
Aaron sat down next to his dad on the den couch saying, “‘Sup, dad.”<br />
<br />
“Hey son. Watching fast and furious,” responded Dave, scratching his hairy tummy that was partially exposed by his t-shirt’s position.<br />
<br />
“Ugh, not one of these shitty action movies again,” thought Aaron, “Oh well. There’s about to be something far more exciting going on.”<br />
<br />
About four minutes later, Dave and Aaron’s heads stayed almost exactly where they were, but the rest of their bodies were instantly transported and attached to the wrong bodies. <br />
<br />
“I can’t believe it worked! I have to play it safe and pretend I don’t know how this happened though...” thought Aaron.<br />
<br />
“Uhh, son?! What just happened?? Is that my body with your head on it?!” Asked Dave, shocked ass hell.<br />
<br />
“Let’s go to the den bathroom and check out what happened,” said Aaron, innocently.<br />
<br />
The two reached the den bathroom in their unfamiliar bodies and looked into the large full length mirror inside. Aaron was delighted, the package had worked exactly as described. Aaron’s once boyish head was now slightly bigger to match his bulky body. Dave’s head had  become slightly smaller to match his new 5’6” petite body. <br />
<br />
“However this happened, it seems intentional,” said Dave, “I mean, just look at how our heads have been changed to match each other’s bodies.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know dad. Who could do this intentionally?” Aaron bluffed. Dave was stumped. <br />
<br />
All there was left to do was explore their new situation. Aaron began feeling up his new chest. He got a little saucy and turned his dad’s former ass towards the mirror and rubbed it a bit.<br />
<br />
“Hey, what are you doing to my ass? Hands off your body from the neck down until we find a way to reverse this,” demanded Dave.<br />
<br />
“For all we know we’re stuck like this for life, I’m not gonna be afraid of my new body,” said Aaron. He started fondling his new big junk through his dad’s sweatpants. A dream come true!<br />
<br />
“It’s not your ‘new body’, it’s my body, and I’m gonna get it back! And besides, I’m not asking you to be afraid of it, but the way your touching on it is an inappropriate way for a son to touch on his father,” said Dave.<br />
<br />
“Well you’d be excited too if you had a two inch penis your whole life and suddenly had your dad’s horse cock!” Exclaimed Aaron.<br />
<br />
“Don’t talk about my body that way! Wait, did you say you had a two inch penis?” Asked Dave. <br />
<br />
Dave pulled down his son’s gym shorts from his new lower body. He was wearing Calvin Klein white briefs. An underwear choice which he never would have made if he had been the one who to dress this body. Dave only wore boxers, despite his impressive physique. He was afraid of looking too sensual, lest people think he’s gay.<br />
<br />
Taking off his shorts revealed two things:<br />
<br />
1. His son had had some nice legs before the swap. They were skinny, sure, but athletic, and not very hairy at all. Even the hair that did exist was light blond, and overall these legs gave the impression of being young, smooth, and pretty. <br />
<br />
2. His son had also had a very small package in those Calvin Klein’s. His balls were a very usual size, between the volume of a bird egg and a chicken egg, it was smack dab in the middle. This was visible through his briefs bulge, accounting for the layer of cotton, which would also make them look slightly bigger. The penis was still a mystery. There was a small bump above the average balls in this underwear bulge. Dare Dave, take a look?<br />
<br />
At this point, Aaron was watching his dad’s shocked expression at realizing how small his dick must be now. As we watched and was getting off on his dad’s humiliation, Aaron stripped his new body of its clothes. He stood there naked, and for the first time in his life, uncut! He put a finger under the hood of his dad’s former penis, and moved it around, enjoying the stimulation of foreskin nerves.<br />
<br />
Dave decided that Aaron was sort of right. He had to know this body to some extent just in case he ended up in it for life. The thought terrified him, or perhaps in a way, excited him? Either way, it justified him removing his son’s tighty whities from his new nethers.<br />
<br />
Having Aaron’s eyes on him made Dave both nervous and kind of excited to pursue this exploration. Especially with Aaron, rimming his former penis’ foreskin with his former beefy, hairy hand. Aaron’s new body had a forest of black hair. This was the only perceivable un-uniform aspect, post swap. It basically looked like Aaron had two natural hair colors. One, light blonde on his head, and the other, a forest of black body hair over his six foot glory of fat and muscle, weighing in at 250lbs. Dave’s son was a lot of man now, even if he did still have a smooth, 18 year old face on that body.<br />
<br />
Dave’s new body had the same contrast of two natural hair colors, but since Aaron was mostly hairless, this wasn’t nearly as visible as with Aaron’s new body. All that really stood out was that his face was older than his body. Dave had a very handsome face with green eyes, an angular jaw and a permanent five o’clock shadow, so this wasn’t a problem. He also had all of his natural black hair, so he hadn’t balded at all, even before the swap. It would appear to a stranger that he had somehow taken very good care of his body from the neck down and was able to slow the clock. It was a little mysterious looking, but undeniably sexy, especially with the cute little briefs he had on, and of course, his little package in them.</p>
