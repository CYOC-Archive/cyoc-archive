<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Angus' arms were shaking as he counted to him self &quot;148, 149&quot; and tears swelled  in his eyes as he wasn't sure if he could do the last one. He <br />
screamed out much louder than he intended with his last dip and collapsed on the floor. He started crying, he had complete the minimum <br />
requirement but he felt it was abundantly clear that his big brother Patrick wished for him to do more. Angus looked up to Patrick and idolized <br />
him as what his master wanted him to be. As he was crying to him self he could feel patrick come and wrap his arms around him. &quot;Its ok little <br />
bro, you made it, your big bro is very proud of you.&quot; But all Angus could think is how he didnt do more than the minimum. &quot;Come on little bro we <br />
have to keep working, we want the Master to be proud of us&quot; Patrick knew saying this would help clear up Angus' tears, and it did. For Angus <br />
looked up to Patrick, he was his big brother and his Alpha. Angus loved Masters other pups.<br />
<br />
As Angus followed Patrick his world brightened as he noticed something out of the corner of his eye, it was his Master peaking though the <br />
blinds. Angus pretended to not notice and sped up catching up with Patrick. Hopping right under the bench press Angus begged his big brother <br />
to load a lot more weight on. &quot;Are you sure you can handle it little bro?&quot; He asked with a bit of concern. But as Angus persisted that he could do it  <br />
Patrick agreed proud his little bro was stepping up. <br />
<br />
Angus hefted the bar filled with weights in a way that made the other masters viewing jealous that there pups didn't have that kind of strength or <br />
determination. He kept pushing his self, Harder and harder only thinking of making his master. It made precum drip out of his chastity device, <br />
than it happened. He felt his muscle tear and his eyes widened as the bench press bar rocketed towards his chest, hitting his sternum, knocking <br />
the air out of him. For a second he had trouble breathing but his big brother tossed the weight aside like it was nothing knocking over 2 other <br />
redheads present, Powered by adrenaline from seeing his little brother in trouble and worry of failing to protect him under his masters orders. <br />
Patrick takes angus in his arms and holds him close. Angus crying and shaking violently and he sobs to him self about failing Master.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT THE FUCK WERE YOU THINKING!&quot; Dan yelled and he ran over to make sure his pups were going to be ok. &quot;Im so sorry master i just wanted <br />
to impress you i saw you and...&quot; He was cut off by Dan who said a little more calmly &quot;Pup your are my property, once you are healed you will be <br />
punished, and Patrick you were suppose to look after him. Your brother got hurt and you could have prevented it. Your punishment is you are <br />
required to sleep in the dog bed on the floor with him until he is healed, UNDERSTOOD.&quot; Patrick teared up but could only say &quot;Understood <br />
Master&quot;. Dan than told Patrick to carry Angus home so he could go ahead and have Marcus prep to bandage up Angus.<br />
<br />
Being carried home in his brothers arm, the thought of earning his way back into his Masters favor was all that kept him for having a complete <br />
breakdown. Leaning into his big brother, listening to his heartbeat he couldn't stop thinking of how Masters face looked. Thats when he had the <br />
idea of what to make for Master as a surprise.<br />
<br />
Patrick and Angus arrived home and Angus was set down on the couch. Marcus put a sling on his arm. Dan was thinking to him self how glad he <br />
was one of his pups use to be a med student before devoting him self completely to Dan. Dan much calmer now talk to all 3 of his pups now <br />
&quot;Master still loves your but was worried Angus was hurt badly. And your punishments will be dealt with in a fair fashion. However make sure you <br />
are fully healed next week. Master has a surprise for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Angus took his medication and feel asleep with his brothers arms wrapped around him, Next thing he knows it is 2 mornings laster and he wakes <br />
up covered in his brothers cum for the wet dreams about the master. He notices his arm feels completely better, his Master must have been <br />
taking good care of him. Angus asks the master for permission to go out and work on a special project. The master agrees and angus hurries out <br />
and starts working on the surprise for the Master. Before he knew it, it was the day of the surprise the master had talked about, he comes in from <br />
working on the surprise he had been working for the Master, Stopping to wrap it nicely in custom made wrapping paper with the Masters brand <br />
all over it. Angus opens the door and he sees......</p>
