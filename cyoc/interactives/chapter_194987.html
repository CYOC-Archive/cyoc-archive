<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Ya, you are mostly dry and I’m mostly soaked,&quot; Ally yelled as she started to sag. &quot;Ah, don&#39;t worry, you can hold a lot more.&quot; Ms. Williams said. &quot;You better not, and my wetness indicator would say otherwise,&quot; Ally said. Ms. Williams smirked as she patted her crotch. &quot;Ally, you are my diaper for a while longer, and until then, whatever comes out you get, &quot; Hey, I don’t want to be that girl, but I think Nichole pooped me and I feel bloated and it’s soupy in here. I might leak. Can you change me? &quot; Jess asked. &quot;Sure dear,&quot; Ms. Williams said, pushing the stroller to the changing room. They got to the room and Mrs. Williams pulled the now crying Nichole out, &quot;Phew, let’s get that nasty diapee off of you.&quot; &quot;Taking out Jesse&#39;s replacement,&quot; Ms Williams said. Jess threw Jess to the side, tossing wipes in her, rolling her up, and tossing her in the nearly full diaper pail, ripping Jess&#39;s tabs and cleaning Nichole&#39;s butt with the relitively clean front. &quot;Ok, who’s next?&quot; Ms. Williams stated that she was looking into Cassie and Kate.&quot;Well, Kate is wet but can hold more and James is surprisingly clean,&quot; Ms. Williams said. &quot;No, what&#39;s surprising is the two-year old that can keep his diaper clean over you,&quot; Ally laughed. Last time I checked, you needed diapers too. But don’t worry, it means we need some food, &quot;Ms. Williams said, washing up.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Ms. Williams pushed the stroller to the food court for an all-you-can-eat buffet. Put James and Racheal in a highchair as Ms. Williams sat down. The lunch was uneventful, with only a few wettings. Here and there. &quot;Ok, let’s go home,&quot; Ms. Williams said. Walking back to the car, James, the two-year old, stops for a second and lets out a stream of urine into Cassie. &quot;Well, so much for near potty training,&quot; Cassie said as she began to sag, finishing with a couple of farts and a grunt, pushing a load of poop into Cassie’s seat. &quot;Good thing he didn’t poop on me,&quot; Cassie lied. &quot;Good try, Cassie, but I can smell you from here,&quot; Ms. Williams said, picking up James and squeezing the contents of his diaper.Stop squishing the poop in my face. Cassie screamed. That’s what you get for lying. Cassie leaked a little as James was placed down in the back of the car. Ms. Williams pulled off his pants, revealing the used Cassie. Ms. Williams let out a fart into her padding as she started to change. James ripping Casie’s tapes. Cassie&#39;s relatively clean front was used to scrub off the poop from the toddler. &quot;Hey, be gentle,&quot; Cassie said. You and Ally don’t understand what you are. You are diapers, but both of you are now dirty diapers. Why can’t you be more like Nicole’s old diaper or Rachel&#39;s diaper? &quot; Ms. Williams said, groaning, letting out a few more farts. She tossed Cassie aside, depositing some wipes. &quot;You mean Jess, your daughter and Kate?&quot; Cassie said. &quot;Nope, you are just diapers.&quot; Ms. Williams chuckled, balling up Cassie and fastening her replacement on James. Kate could feel her waistband pull back and squeeze her wet padding. You’ve been good, so I’ll give you a choice. You are wet enough that you should be changed, but you can survive about one or two more. Do you want to be changed now or later? &quot; Ms. Williams asked. Well, I should be changed now, but I like being a diaper. I want to continue until my owner does not want me any more. Kate said. Ms. Williams said as she slid Racheal and the others into their car seats, &quot;All right. Now what do I do with you? Well, I know what, but lucky for you, there are no trashcans nearby, so I can leave you here or take you home, but I don’t want you stinking up the car. &quot; Ms. Williams said. &quot;Oh, don’t worry, you beat me to it.&quot; Cassie said. Oh, don’t worry about that. &quot; Ms. Williams patted ally on the back. Ally started to get more nervous when Ms. Williams farted more. &quot;Hnngh,&quot; Ms. Williams grunted as she squatted, still holding on to the poop-filled Cassie. Ms. Williams sighed and let a torrent of urine into her already struggling diaper, gripping her a little tighter and grunting once more before filling Ally with her bowles, after a load of semi-solid waste.Ms. Williams felt her tight pants would squeeze Ally’s contents out. While still in the parking lot, Ms. Williams took off her pants, revealing a heavily sagging ally. Not seeing a trash can, she threw Cassie into a shopping bag and got into the driver&#39;s seat with a squish and a groan from Ally. &quot;Put me out of my misery.&quot; &quot;In time, first I need to find someone to change me. You are too dirty for me to change myself,&quot; Ms. Williams said as she drove off.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The group was almost home when Racheal let out a couple of farts into Kate. &quot;We’ll look like I’ll join you, Cassie,&quot; Kate said a minute later. Racheal leaned forward in her car seat and released her bowels into Kate, finishing her off with another wetting. Kate was about to burst. After a little while, the urine started to get cold, causing Racheal to squirm and whine. &quot;OK, I’ll change you soon,&quot; Ms. Williams said as she parked the car. Racheal was the last to be removed from her car seat by Ms. Williams. Ms. Williams turned Racheal around and sniffed at Kate. &quot;Phew, Kate, you didn&#39;t hold off on that change for too long.&quot; Ms. Williams said. &quot;Hey, why aren&#39;t you wearing pants?&quot; a voice said. A lady walked up the driveway. She had brown hair and looked to be in her late 20s with a heavily pregnant belly. &quot;Hey, Chloe,&quot; Ms. Williams said. &quot;Hey, Sophia,&quot; Chloe laughed.&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Chloe asked. &quot;You are going to change Rachel here,&quot; Sophia said. &quot;Can I join?&quot; Chloe asked. &quot;Sure, can you grab that diaper out of the bag and throw it out?&quot; Sophia said. &quot;Sure,&quot; Chloe said, grabbing Cassie and followed Sophia. The girls walked into the house and up to the nursery. &quot;Want to see something cool?&quot; Sophia said, pulling out the tablet. Sophia hit a button and was linked with the girls. &quot;What?&quot; Chloe asked. Can you turn me back? &quot;Cassie pleaded.&quot;Who said that?&quot; Chloe asked. &quot;The diaper you’re holding.&quot; Cassie said. Chloe screamed, dropping Cassie and running to Sophia. &quot;What is going on?&quot; Chloe panicked. Don’t worry about taking care of these babies; their mother forgot to bring extra diapers. So I stumbled upon my daughter using this machine that can change people into things. She turned Jeff into a goodnite diaper. She was with her friends, and I needed some diapers. So I made a challenge: they pick a baby to be their diaper, and if they make it home, they can change back, if I feel like it. &quot; Sophia explained. &quot;Ok, so where are they all?&quot; Chloe asked. Well, out of the five, two didn’t make it home. They are at the bottom of a diaper pail in the mall. They were worn by newborns. Cassie was next being used by a two-year old, and that was her you were holding. I had to change her in the parking lot where there are no trashcans. Kate, worn by this cutie, is about to join Cassie in the diaper pail. And finally, Ally, my diaper here. &quot; Sophia said, patting Ally. She put Rachel on the changing table. &quot;Ok, this is weird.&quot; Chloe said, picking up Cassie. &quot;What do I do with her?&quot; Chloe asked. She is a dirty diaper. What do you do with them? &quot; Sophia said, unfastening Kate from Racheal. Chloe shrugged and threw Cassie in Cassie screamed until it was cut off by the pail closing. &quot;Phew Kate, Racheal didn’t hold back for you.&quot; Sophia said as she put Kate to the side, putting poop smeared wipes on her. Please let me be a clean diaper once more.I don’t care what size it is. Kate said. &quot;Hmm, I don’t know, you are a nasty diaper. What do you think, Chloe? &quot; There are, she stated.Chloe whispered to Sophia. &quot;OK, I think that’s what we’ll do. But in the meantime.&quot; Sophia tossed Kate into the diaper pail with Cassie. &quot;Now it&#39;s all clean except for one more thing. Your turn, Sophia, &quot;Chloe said as Sophia hopped on the table with a squish from the ally.</p>
