<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aiden laid there in the floor for what felt like a decent amount of time. He tried to tell his body to move something, anything, but he couldn&#39;t move anything. he tried to scream and make the squeaker in his throat squeak but nothing! He was completely motionless and couldn&#39;t do anything! Happyness and a deep sense of satisfaction was all that was flowing through his body. Aiden worried that he wouldn&#39;t be able to do anything if he was deflated and somewhat worried about dying, but he was there and very much still alive, but he was just so helpless now that he was done deflating. If only he could inflate himself, he could try to get away, but this time there was nothing he could do to save himself from living as Geoff&#39;s fun toy... Aiden then worried about what Geoff went off and was doing... How did he make himself such as massive dick? And he was so much stronger and burly... Aiden couldn&#39;t remember Geoff being anything like that... but then it hit him... What if Geoff had a second Chronovac! &quot;Oh No!&quot; Aiden screamed inside his rubbery head. With that he could make a new profile of him and turn him into anything! &quot;No, no no no no no!&quot; Aiden cried silently. &quot;If i just wasn&#39;t deflated I would be running away screaming! Now hes going to turn me into something I don&#39;t want to be... fuck this cant be happening!&quot;<br />
<br />
Aiden&#39;s internal thinking was then suddenly stopped as he felt Geoff pick him up again and lay him flat upside down on the bed. Aiden felt pleasure overtaking him as Geoff straightened out his arms, his legs, even his wings and tail and everything... Then Aiden felt something get inserted inside his valve and heard a hiss starting, within moments his ass was inflating, first his ass, then his thighs and chest, then the life giving air began to flow to everything. Aiden felt a different kind of sensation this time, it was auxillerating! It was like nothing else he had felt this time... It was strength giving but also stuffing, it made his body sing with pleasure as the hissing air flowed into his body but it was a good feeling of pressure from everywhere inside his body. It was extremely filling, Aiden began to moan in pleasure, at first just squeaking and squelching as his vocal cord of a squeaker returned to functioning. Aiden could feel the pressure in his body began to turn into an all around pleasurable tingling as his body was now almost done inflating. Aiden then tried to move his arms and legs, tried to sit up his body, and with a sudden gasp,  popped air hose popped out of his valve and he once again started deflating. &quot;Fuck! No!&quot; he squeakily screamed as he fell over backwards now facing the sealing, his arms flailing trying to reach and grab the air valve in the back of his body. His fingers barely able to nab it but only ended up fondling it and moaning as the air rushed out of his body. Aiden couldn&#39;t focus enough to touch it as it was overwhelming his sensitive plastic organ to let out a constant stream of air from his body. It was like farting, cumming and burping all at the same time as all the pressure sprayed out of his body. Aiden quickly was losing the strength he had in his fingers and hands as he was now flattening. Aiden helplessly looked around to see who it was who was trying to re-inflate his body.  It was Geoff that was standing over him grinning and trying not to laugh at Aiden&#39;s helplessly deflating body. <br />
<br />
&quot;You should try not moving next time you are being inflated Airhead unless you want to stay there and keep on deflating.&quot; &quot;Aiden weakly nodded his head, and tried to say to Geoff &quot;Ok...&quot;, faintly squeaking what left he had of his voice away while he continued to squish and flatten. &quot;I&#39;m gonna wait for you to finish deflating before I shove this back into your body.&quot; Geoff taunted, waving the hose of the compressor back in forth in his hand. Aiden laid there and continued deflating, all the strength in him he desperately craved and need to escape was almost done blowing out of the hole in his body. Aiden was almost completely deflated now and bliss was soon arriving from his happy flattened ending. He could barely move as he got weaker and weaker, it quickly became impossible to move as he finished his deflating. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now, since your done playing and I got your attention, here&#39;s what were going to end up doing. So listen up Squeaky.&quot; Geoff calmly commanded to his shiny rubber toy. &quot;You ARE going to that frat party, and you are getting a hazing. They were expecting a NORMAL male blow up doll at the party but now you kinda fucked that up for me.&quot; Aiden cowered in his mind silently, only gladdened that Geoff couldn&#39;t hear what he was thinking.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was originally going to just throw you into the trash you after I fucked you and sent you off deflated to that party, but since you can&#39;t really clean up after yourself, or move or speak while you lay there helpless on my bed and you were oh so incredibly pleasing to fuck... I&#39;m going to give you a little present before I send you off to that party... And make you a little deal for if you do an even better job while at that party. You still need to be punished for trying to run away and ruin my day so I think you should drop whatever your thinking and listen closely... Toy!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A deal?&quot; Thought Aiden, &quot;What kind of fucked up prank is he going to do to me? I can&#39;t do anything to stop him from destroying me! What on this fucking planet makes him think I want do give him anything?&quot; <br />
<br />
Aiden&#39;s thoughts were interrupted as Geoff continued speaking. &quot;I&#39;m going to plug back in your Chronivac and hook it to mine. that way i can get into the developers settings and see if we can change anything. If we can, Your going to be self cleaning and absorb anything we put into your body because I&#39;m not going to reward you with cleaning out my jizz from for you, It wont matter what we put in you as long as its what we want you to absorb into you, piss, shit, cum, rusty paperclips, a dead cat, anything. If I say eat it, you eat it. If i tell you to inflate yourself with something, you hook it up to your body and if I tell you to shove this up your ass, Its gonna disappear up that tight rubber booty. Anyway I say, is exactly what you do. And I decide you should spit it out, in any way, your gonna obey. Got it Squeaky?&quot;<br />
<br />
Aiden would glare at Geoff and sock him in the face if he had any strength in his hands. Now hes gonna have be eating worms or cleaning disgusting restrooms with his tongue only to be forced to shit or piss or puke it all out on command and he&#39;ll have to live with all that disgusting stuff sealed inside the rubber of his body... &quot;Geoff you are fucking sick you know that!&quot; Aiden silently screamed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Secondly Squeaky, you need to get used to me calling you that, and everybody calling you that, because that&#39;s your new name, your name is now Squeaky, Squeaky the Amazing, Inflatable, Rubber Incubus! Just rolls off the tongue. I&#39;ll be bar coding that onto your body just under your valve and writing it on your other foot so everyone knows your new name.&quot; <br />
<br />
Aiden would give Geoff the worse case of the stink eye if he could move his motionless flattened rubber face. &quot;If I wasn&#39;t so god damn mad at you right now I actually would have liked that name. Fuck you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thirdly, I&#39;m going to program into you that if you ever end up trying to run away, or you ever try to talk smack or try to disobey me, or do anything that insults or upsets me, All I got to do is call your stupid rubber ass and demand you start deflating. It wont matter where you are or what your doing, If I tell you to deflate your gonna reach around with your shiny little rubber claws and pull your own valve open. And you cant grab it for any reason, it will pop itself open, you will start deflating and fold yourself up for me as perfectly and neatly as you can... and if you think you can tape or glue itself closed, I&#39;ll be able GPS track your body anywhere you end up running to using my machine, so I&#39;ll always be able to find you easily. And as an extra special treat, I&#39;m going to make sure you can never prevent yourself from deflating, once you pop that stupid little valve open, you will won&#39;t be able to touch that valve again until your body has been inflated again and sealed by me. All you can do is play with your happy ass, pull up your rubber pants and go grope yourself until you finish deflating. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh now you take away my ability to escape. You know your a fucking piece of shit Geoff, I used to be your fucking friend!!! If you think this will prevent me from ruining your day, you got another thing fucking coming you walking piece of garbage!&quot; Aiden stewed inside his mind, it would seem that Geoff is more of a demon than he is.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lastly, I fucking hate that stupid rubber underwear you fused onto your body and cant change your clothing or color or anything! So I&#39;m gonna change that... From now on, If I command you to change your appearance to anything I like made of latex rubber or that&#39;s inflatable or tell you to change any part of yourself you will absorb that part into your body and you will change yourself to meet my liking... And as an extra punishment since you make yourself permanently unable to be anything but a latex rubber toy, I&#39;m going to change your default shape into your stupid fucking rubber underwear, If you get sleepy, you turn into your rubber undies, If you pass out, you turn into your rubber undies, If it tell you to, you turn into your fucking rubber undies. And if you ejaculate on me again and pop yourself like you did on that fucking bed, you turn, into, fucking, rubber, undies... You got that squeaky! Because I know your deflated rubber ass can hear me. If I want you to be an inflatable rubber dildo at that party you will change in front of everybody and If i want you to turn into a full rubber suit you better be ready because your gonna be worn by me! Oh, and if you think you can run away or disobey me like i said earlier and your not inflatable, you will turn into your stupid rubber panties instead!&quot;<br />
<br />
Aiden was now ready to kill Geoff, &quot;I&#39;m going to murder you in your fucking sleep you miserable fucking piece of god damn shit!!! I&#39;ll kill you and everybody who even so much as touches me at that fucking party!!! I&#39;m immortal bitch, I&#39;ll outlive every single one of you fuckers for doing this to me!!!&quot; Aiden screamed in his head laying there on the bed with his flattened orgasm face and motionless silent body.<br />
<br />
Geoff paused for a while before speaking up again, his displeased scour turning into a malicious grin. Geoff shook his head before speaking again in a seductive but clearly threatening tone. &quot;Because I like what you did with your body, I&#39;m going to leave you the way you are in your &quot;inflatable incubus body&quot; you wanted so much. It shocks me you didn&#39;t turn yourself back into a human, I mean, there&#39;s a fucking option to reset everything. but since your a stupid fucking Airhead Squeaky, you locked down all previous changes so now I can revert anything, not even by fucking with the dev settings. I bet your happy that I can only have one profile tied to your being, otherwise I would do something really humiliating.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aiden was shocked to hear what Geoff was saying... He could have reverted EVERYTHING??? FUCK!!!! To hear it was now his fault for preventing himself from returning to being normal every again was just extra insulting...<br />
<br />
&quot;Now here&#39;s the deal Squeaky... If you accept all these changes, don&#39;t give me any lip or push back, stun everybody at that party with your amazing rubber demon body and you make me look great to everyone at that party for bringing the coolest toy and being the coolest guy, I may let you keep all these powers and use them on your own free time if I decide to give you any, and if you keep being a good little demon boy Squeaky, then I may just let you go free and keep all these amazing rubber powers for your own use and liking. Wouldn&#39;t it be nice just to inflate yourself by just thinking of inflating... Or be able to turn your stupid rubber ass into anything at any time? I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll miss being able to eat food eventually... I know chili dogs used to be your favorite thing... Wouldn&#39;t be just oh so nice if you could eat them as much as you like and never need to stop eating or get hungry?&quot;<br />
<br />
Aiden was so furious with Geoff, but did he just say he could go free? And come to think of it... Even though these &quot;powers&quot; Geoff is giving him are going to only be used to abuse him completely in every single way, if he could control them, that just might change the game. &quot;So... assuming this piece of walking garbage keeps his promise, I can be in control of my own body again and go free...&quot; Aiden pondered for a moment. &quot;I&#39;m immortal but If I don&#39;t just do what he says, what hope do I have actually of being anything other than a toy... If he actually does what he says, I may actually get to be a real demon toy... I mean boy... FUCK!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Squeaky... What do you say? Oh yeah, that&#39;s right, I need to inflate you first for you to say anything... So were going to stick the air pump in your ass now... Don&#39;t move Squeaky...&quot; Geoff taunted Aiden as he grabbed his valve on his back and plugged him into the inflating machine. Aiden did exactly as he said and didn&#39;t move an inch, though near the end of being inflated he struggled not to move from the pleasure of all the pressure inside him stretching his body back to his normal shape and size. Geoff then pulled the hose out and plugged up Squeaky&#39;s valve. Aiden then turned around to face Geoff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Geoff, you probably realize I want to kill you here, and right now... You shrunk me, turned me into a toy, made everyone forget I exist that loved me and I cared about, and fucked me stupid to the point ended up popping me... And now your talking about abusing me at a frat party to be fucked, transformed and made to do god knows what. Why the hell would I ever expect you to keep any kind of deal with me when all you&#39;ve done is abuse me?&quot; Aiden said with his squeaky rubber voice as plainly and calmly as he could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because Squeaky... your my friend, and you wanted this. Why else would you turn yourself into an &quot;Inflatable Rubber Incubus&quot; Geoff said mockingly. You know there&#39;s a security camera right fucking there!&quot; Geoff said pointing to a little white dome with a black screen in the corner of the room just above the door. the little red light still blinking, showing it was a live feed. &quot;I watched you sit there and slowly wiggle your way to the computer. At first I was just highly entertained, until I realized you started typing. I was going to turn you back after the party anyways, I even ran to the store to get everything you would have liked. But then you went and did... This... &quot;He said motioning to Aiden&#39;s horns and wings. &quot;You must be fucking stupid if you think you can run around in society looking like this. So obviously you must have liked it and wanted it. I&#39;m only fulfilling that dream. Your way to much of a pussy to be a fucking demon Squeaky.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aiden spoke up and looked Geoff straight in the eyes. &quot;Well... yeah... I did like the idea, but you made it so I&#39;m stuck permanently as a rubber fuck toy! What else was I going to do. I didn&#39;t know you could reset everything, your the one who locked the program in the fucking first place! Besides you weren&#39;t going to let me go, you said it yourself, Im going to be your little fuck buddy every single god damn night until you fucking die. So again, I ask the question. Why the hell should I think your going to keep your promise!&quot;<br />
<br />
Geoff then sighed before grabbing Aiden by his long rubber hair. &quot;Because if you don&#39;t be a good boy, you&#39;ll never get to live your dream as a cute rubber demon boy and I will personally shove your inflatable happy ass into the oven down stairs. And, when you get to hell, you can tell all of the real demons down there just how much of a Squeaky little bitch you are! Or, you can shut the fuck up about killing me in my sleep or whatever you have going on in your head, admit the fact that you CANT return to normal society because your a LIVING FUCKING POOL TOY and you fucking made yourself look like a FUCKING DEMON of all things! Oh! and lets not ignore the fact that I did change you back to normal, its YOU who couldn&#39;t take a prank!&quot; Geoff then relaxed his hand and sighed again. &quot;Look, I&#39;m sorry, but I really was just fooling around at first but then it got serious... I&#39;ve always had a crush on you and I think what you did is fucking hot... Yeah, I wouldn&#39;t have let you leave... at night anyways... But during the day I would have just let you be whatever it is you were gonna be. We have a fucking machine that can turn us into anything, and you crippled that to make yourself permanently a god damn squeaky toy. So just play along, do a few squeaky things and be a magic rubber toy that can turn into anything I say, blah blah blah, and Ill come back, give you ownership of your abilities and you can just go free.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aiden then let out a squeak of a sigh. &quot;Geoff... why the hell are you so insistant about me going to this fucking party...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because Aiden... the douchebag who&#39;s is hosting this party is the son of the guy who owns Chronivac Company, his dads fucking loaded! Bruce... the god damn piece of shit that he is, has put out a dare. If anyone can show him something he&#39;s never seen, or give him the time of his life for his son&#39;s graduation using the very device that he made. and hes put money down on the line a lot of money...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How much money are we talking? I mean it can&#39;t be more than what like a few gra-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Five. Million. Dollars.&quot; Geoff interrupted. &quot;Five. Fucking. MILLION DOLLARS SQUEAKY!!! FIVEFUCKINGMILLIONDOLLARS! You almost cost me, Five million dollars! Thing is, only people who had a Chronivac can attend, so its going to be a freak show, and the worst part is, its a popularity contest. So you gotta please everybody to win that money.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aiden&#39;s rubber face turned to a frown... &quot;You honestly thought... turning me into a living blow up doll that could barely move would have been enough to convince anyone who has a bloody machine that can literally turn you, or anybody for that matter, into absolutely anything was going to win a popularity contest? Geoff... I can garentee you, that prank you did to me, wouldn&#39;t win... Hell I probably wouldn&#39;t even be the only &quot;Oh look! A person who got turned into a blow up doll! Hurr... so random!&quot; Now where mah monah!&quot;<br />
<br />
Geoff at first wanted to raise his fist and sock Aiden in the face but stopped before backing off with a worried look... &quot;Oh my god... you know... your probably right about that...&quot;<br />
<br />
Aiden then continued. &quot;Fuck I mean I bet over half of the people there are just going to be gender swaps, It seems everyone and their dog dreams of that... You think with your dick first and always have.&quot;<br />
<br />
Geoff went silent for a bit before speaking... &quot;So you&#39;ll still go to the party?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck no! Not unless you allow me to be my own master! You do that fuck it, you can keep the money. Why do I care. I&#39;m just a fucking toy that will never die.&quot; Aiden said sarcastically.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK FINE! You need proof I can keep my fucking promise HERE! Ill make it so your sweat heals your body from all damage too!&quot; Geoff then angrily got up and rammed the power socket of the Chronivac into the wall, it booted right up and before Aiden could get up he plugged his pocket version into his machine. &quot;Wait what! NO!&quot; Aiden said before pausing in mid jump at Geoff. &quot;Sorry but I need you to be still for this... Its patching your file.&quot; Geoff said woefully to Aiden. A green light then appeared over Aiden and scanned his body a few times before disappearing, then Aiden dropped to the floor with a sudden squeak. &quot;Your file&#39;s been patched and your base settings are set to what you are now. As far as this machine is concerned, you&#39;ve always been a living rubber toy. Now, lets get to your upgrades.&quot; Aiden tried to get up and lunged for Geoff&#39;s neck with his plastic claws ready. &quot;YOU FUCKING TOUCH ME ILL DELETE YOUR FILE!!!&quot; Geoff screamed at the top of his lungs. Aiden stopped his charge and went to sit down at the bed with a bit of a squeak filled &quot;Hmph!&quot; &quot;God your more catty than some girls I know.&quot; Geoff commented before entering the changes.<br />
<br />
A few minutes pass as Geoff double checks all the settings.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t know this could do reality altering like that. why not just set it so you automatically win the money when you walk in the front door?&quot; Aiden said peeking over Geoff&#39;s shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I can&#39;t one Chronovac cannot overwrite another ones settings if its active. From the moment the party was even set up as an Idea the rules were set on how this goes: People with a Chronovac are the only ones allowed as attendees, all changes must be made using a Chronivac and before the party starts in order to be eligible to win the prize, only one person may be changed by the attendee given they are not already an attendee unless done to them self to be eligible, if done to a different individual than the attendee they must be present at the party along with the attendee, that&#39;s you stupid.&quot; Geoff said motioning to Aiden. &quot;No cheating, changing the rules or bringing the Chronovac into the party is allowed. Attendees cannot kill, overwrite, replace, edit, or erase or modify anyone who is attending the party prior to arrival, all changes done to attendees while at the party will be remembered by the attendees and reverted at midnight and the winner will be decided. All attendees are allowed one vote. Guests, staff, and non-attendees are not allowed to vote for the winner of the prize money.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh.&quot; Aiden shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t make up the rules. Bruce the shithead who owns the place did. Beyond all this, anything that goes, goes. I was going to submit myself at that party and just leave you at home and split the money to say I&#39;m sorry, But since you made your changes permanent, well I guess I&#39;m stuck with you being my submission at the party.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So now your offering to make me exactly what I always wanted to be as payment and just keep the money?&quot; Asked Aiden.<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly.&quot; Said Geoff, finishing typing up Aiden&#39;s new &quot;abilities&quot; into the machine. &quot;I wrote in that extra regenerative gloss that will heal you completely no matter what damage you take. Now not even chucking you into a volcano will be able to destroy that precious rubber body of yours, but I&#39;m not changing anything about what I told you I was going to change about you from earlier. Even made it so if I win you  gain full control over your powers automatically. All I got to do now is hit enter&quot; Geoff said spinning the chair around to face Aiden, showing him the screen so he could read everything before submitting the changes.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Squeaky, Do we have a deal?&quot; Asked Geoff.<br />
<br />
Aiden looked through everything before catching something near the bottom... &quot;Ack, really? You still own me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t change that, your the one who made that permanent. Even if I set you as your own master, what I say will take presidence over your choices.&quot; Geoff shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh... So whats this part about?&quot; Aiden said pointing to the screen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh that? Well, when your in underwear mode, anyone who wears you can use your powers on themselves. Effectively allowing you to turn them into rubber, make them inflatable, fuse to their body for a certain amount of time, absorb themselves into you, etc... This setting is true anytime your technically wearable and someone crawls inside you.&quot; Geoff explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;But... it also says here if they cum inside me while fused they get absorbed automatically...&quot; Aiden questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but once someone is bound and absorbed only your or I can let them out, but anyone you bind to or absorb at the party will just be unbound at midnight. Otherwise I can&#39;t un-fuse you from somebody if you fuse to their body.&quot; Geoff said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok... I&#39;m done reading everything.&quot; Aiden said after scrolling to the bottom of the page.<br />
<br />
&quot;So do we have a deal Squeaky?&quot; Geoff Asked Smirking.<br />
<br />
&quot;You going to wear me into the party?&quot; Aiden asked smirking back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn straight. You&#39;d look sexy on me.&quot; Geoff replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we have a deal.&quot; Aiden said with a sharp squeak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then push the button Squeaky.&quot; Geoff commanded.<br />

Squeaky leaned up with one of his fingers and pressed SUBMIT on the screen. Almost immediately Squeaky could feel something that felt like a gut gurgle in his butt and groin and around his waist. &quot;It&#39;s starting...&quot; Squeaky said, before climbing up and laying spread eagle on the bed. &quot;Oh!&quot; He squeaked, as his body began to creak and start tingling. &quot;You should get ready too... I can feel myself changing...&quot;</p>
