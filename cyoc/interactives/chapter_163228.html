<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff was practically bouncing up and down. The Chronivac was working, he was actually aging though time! Now that he had graduated from high school, that meant that he was going to college next right? Considering how he was doing in high school; he couldn’t wait to see how cool he would be in college. Unfortunately for Jeff, that wasn&#39;t the case at first. Almost immediately after entering college, Jeff noticed that his once flat stomach was getting a spare tire.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! No!&quot; He cried out in vain as he helplessly watched his once trim body fall victim to the freshman 15. Too many parties, drinking and a cafeteria full of fatty foods really took a toll on Jeff&#39;s body. A-at least he was enjoying himself in college, right?<br />
<br />
After a while freshman year was ended and sophomore year was beginning. Jeff was hoping for something better to happen to him this year, but that just wasn’t the case. Jeff’s room was getting messier by the minute, textbooks and handwritten notes sprawled his desk and floor. He was starting to get a headache thanks to the mental changes that was cramming all the terms and concepts he had to memorize for all his exams and papers. Looking at the mirror again, Jeff could tell that Sophomore year was being rough on him. He looked so disheveled and fatigued with bags under his eyes from many all-nighters, and all this stress was not helping his waistline. Man, he really needed to turn his life around.<br />
<br />
Soon, Jeff was leaving Sophomore year and entering Junior year, and he was bracing himself for any more horrible stuff to happen to him. However, it seems like the Chronivac. The mental changes were telling him that his roommate Keith was studying to be a personal trainer and was using him as a guinea pig of sorts. Thanks to him, Jeff was eating better, exercising regularly, and Keith even gave him a lesson on time management. Jeff was feeling so much better and looking better too! It wasn’t long before the gut he had developed disappeared and he was back to his lean high school body, and then some!<br />
<br />
Senior year had arrived, but Jeff was too preoccupied with his slowly bulking up body. Looks like Keith wasn’t going to stop using Jeff as a guinea pig, not that Jeff wanted to stop either as he found himself remembering loving lifting weights and growing stronger. He was flexing his arm in the mirror watching as the bicep grew bigger and bigger, they were around softball-sized. His shoulders and back were widening giving him a V-shape. He even had abs now, a far cry from a year ago when he was chubby. Jeff looked like a model now, in fact, he remembered that he modeled the school’s merchandise. Speaking of the school, that caused him to remember something else.<br />
<br />
“Valedictorian?” That made Jeff finally look away from his body, and around his dorm room and saw drafts of speeches for the big day. Even with the memories that were flowing into his brain, he had no clue how he gotten picked. Sure, he was a good student, but there were certainly other students that were smarter than him. Maybe they saw something in him that he didn’t.<br />
<br />
Just like high school graduation, college graduation came and went in a blink of an eye, and now Jeff found himself in a modest apartment building, his college diploma proudly hanging on a wall. Speaking of pride, Jeff&#39;s body was growing from model to bodybuilder proportion. Guess future Jeff didn’t want to go back to his flabby self in college after all.<br />
<br />
Jeff cupped his pecs as they expanded into thick slabs of muscle, he flexed his arms as they grew as big as cannonballs, and then he ran his hands over his abs as it strengthened into a thick eight-pack. It was incredible how good he looked and felt. Jeff’s shoulders grew rounder and broader filling in the shirts that flash by nicely, his back grew wider giving him an even more amazing V-shape, his legs growing as thick as tree trunks to support his now-massive body. Jeff blushed a little when he felt that his ass had grown into an impressive bubble butt, one that will certainly turn heads. In fact, he remembered during the company beach party; everyone was surprised by how muscular he was underneath his suit. They were calling him things like “Stud,” “Hunk,” and “Beefcake.” A bit embarrassing, but words that filled his already large chest with pride.<br />
<br />
It was around when Jeff’s surroundings were once again drastically changing, this time from his modest apartment to penthouse apartment! There was some expensive-looking furniture, top of the line futuristic electronics, and even the clothes that he was wearing look fancy. Well, at least from what he could tell with how his clothes kept cycling by as time went by. Yet despite all his new and pricy stuff he now owned, something quite simple in the penthouse caught Jeff’s eye. It was a magazine of Muscle and Fitness with him shirtless posing in on cover! “Hot, young CEO shares his fitness tips.” CEO?! Huh, even with his mental changes, the fact that he was now a CEO didn’t sink in yet. He worked hard, but to get there, but to do it at such a young age.<br />
<br />
As time quickly approached 2030 not many more noticeable changes happened. The biggest change was that Jeff grew a goatee. It made him handsome and fit his CEO image. It wasn’t before long that the flow of time returned to normal and the changes were done, well almost. The mental changes still need time to finish. In the meantime, Jeff was absolutely elated about his future. While he had some turbulence during his early college years, the results were well worth it. He was now a rich, handsome, buff CEO now after all, and he was wondering if it was even worth it going back to his original age.<br />
<br />
Suddenly a ding could be heard coming from the Chronivac indicating that the mental changes were done, and with that finishing, Jeff suddenly remembered something important about his new life.</p>
