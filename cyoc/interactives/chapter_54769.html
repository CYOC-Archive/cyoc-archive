<p>Everyone knew about the town curse.</p>

<p>In some version or another, everyone knew of The Curse.  Whether it be whispered quietly among friends, unsolved mysteries kept in an underground storage room at the local precinct, notes passed between girls at the back of class, graffiti across the condemned buildings on the other side of the tracks, writing on the wall of the bathroom stall at a gas station at the edge of town, mass emails sent out from an unknown sender, or even the "The Curse" tab at the top of the town's website… every local within the region that the city of Glendale resided had heard it in some form or another.  Did it matter?  It didn't seem to.  Even after these centuries of time, most people <i>still</i> thought it was nothing but a strange and often perverted variety of stories.  Every town has its legends, right?</p>

<p>Glendale's legend tended to be a little more unique than others, however.  "Transform or Dare" was a twisted form of the ancient game of Truth or Dare in which the person [or persons] being asked the question would be expected to pick one of the two options and then be magically bound to their choice.  If it were a choice of Dare, that Dare would have have them carry out their task as they were magically bound to do so.  If it was Transform, then the change would strike the person and alter their form or even have the capacity to warp reality around the victim to the point where it could alter everyone else's perceptions.  If they failed to choose?  Well, asker of the question would be able to bestow <i>both</i> facets of The Curse upon the target.</p>

<p>In every generation there came a time in which The Curse would resurface.  Usually it was in just enough time for the previous generation of teenagers&#151;the predominate users of the game&#151;to have all but forgotten the last tales when it would one again rear its evil head.  There are many versions of events that have gone on during the nearly two hundred years that it has been passed on but each story still has <i>some</i> truth to it.  Somewhere within all the deception and altering of history lies the truth of the origin of The Curse and a way to stop it for good.  Will this be that story?  It's too early to tell.</p>

<div style="font: 12pt Arial Black;">August 17, 2010</div>
<p>As our story begins anew, it has been eight years since that faithful Thursday back in January of AD 2002.  Elizabeth Warner, Liz to her friends, sits in Velissa's Diner on the side of town farthest from her old school of East Hampton High.  She hadn't changed much in the time gone by and yet so many people around her had.  Sure, she'd made it through high school and even into Cornell University… met Todd Warner and had a kid… but Liz remained the same ambitious young woman at heart… always ready gain an advantage or make some easy money.</p>

<p>Getting some quick cash is what brought Mrs. Warner to this far side of Glendale, a fair distance from her home in Albany.  She'd been called here by a young man named of Sam Rutherford who claimed to be a journalism student at Glendale Technical College.  What she was able to gather from him over the phone was that he was paying people for information on the town's curse as he did research for a thesis paper he had planned for his senior year.  Why she had been called, she didn't know… she hadn't even learned of The Curse until she was already in college, far away from the town itself.</p>

<p>"And you will forget everything about Transform or Dare… especially the fact that you now possess the curse," were words that Elizabeth had only vaguely recalled in her dreams from time to time.  But wording on The Curse was always important, and just moments prior Liz had transformed her supposed friend Jennifer back to human from some kind of sheep woman.  It was important that only herself, Jennifer, and Kyle Perkins would recall that ever having happened… but when Kyle chose just moments later for her to forget, she did just that.</p>

<p>The trick to forgetting, however, is that it indicates you once knew that which you no longer remember.  Her life had taken a turn for the slums when she got pregnant by way of the tight end on the football team during her senior year of high school.  Her family's religious views wouldn't allow her to abort the child, and she missed starting up college for two whole years because of it.  The stress the kid brought, combined with studies, caused her to attempt suicide.  It was shortly after that event that she began to see a therapist.</p>

<p>This, in turn, brings us full circle… because even though Kyle dared her to forget everything she had known about Transform or Dare… what she had learned of it later in life, combined with her therapy, had allowed her to remember a few details of that event that she had been cursed to forget.  Though she remembered meeting Kyle only that day all those eight years ago, she recalled that she and Jennifer had passed or thought to pass The Curse back and forth between themselves that day.  Liz was also fairly certain that Jennifer had been a sheep-woman, but that really didn't make much sense to her.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was reconsidering her choice to come back to Glendale right about the time a young man came in through the front doors of the diner.  She remembered things that made no sense… conflicting version of reality… a Kyle Perkins using Transform or Dare… but that one looked nothing like the one she had met only that day.  She remembered a anthropomorphic sheep that was he old friend Jennifer Smith, but that couldn't be… that kind of thing could never happen.</p>

<p>The young man approached the table where Mrs. Warner sat and pocketed a photograph he had been holding just a moment earlier.  He looked to be about in his late twenties, black hair, brown eyes… perhaps an Italian.  "Elizabeth Warner?" he asked in a kind voice, a smile creeping into his face.  She nodded to him, and he reached out a hand to her.  Taking it, he shook firmly and nodded in return, "Sam Rutherford.  Glad you could make it," he said.  "It's not often I get to meet someone who may have participated in this town's sordid past," he said with a chuckle, sitting down in the booth seat across the table from her.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure what you mean," Liz said, taking her hand back from him.  "I've never played the game before."</p>

<p>A waitress walked over to the table to get an order of drinks from each of them.  Elizabeth ordered a red wine and the young man ordered a Pepsi.  Looking back to Liz, he pointed out, "It's a curse, not a game," he nodded to her, pulling out his iPhone and flicking the screen to scroll through some of his notes.</p>

<p>"Its only a curse if you use it for bad stuff," Liz said, but then had a feeling of d&#0233;j&#0224; vu… as if she had said something very similar before.  Her head tilted down and she stared at an image of a hamburger intently on her menu as she thought that over.  Frowning, she shook her head and looked back up at Sam.  "I'm sorry… what were you saying?"</p>

<p>"Nothing quite yet," he smiled, finding his place in his notes.  The waitress appeared beside them and placed their drinks on the table.  Liz ordered a hamburger, distracted… Sam ordered turkey and gravy with some cornbread at the side.  "Do you remember a Jennifer Smith or Kyle Perkins?" he asked, taking a sip of his soda.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mrs. Warner had bad feeling about this.  Her therapist would be furious… playing into her curiosity and paranoia by meeting this man and talking about things that couldn't possibly be real.  Curiosity <i>did</i> kill the cat, after all.  "Cat," she said softly to herself, thinking about an image of herself on the football field all those years ago.  Moments went by as she repeated the word to herself.  Sam, for his part, allowed her to do so as he knew others who had trouble remembering answers to questions he had asked.  He let her come around on her own, and eventually she did nod.  "Yes," she said, still nodding, "I remember them.  Jennifer and I use to be friends… Kyle Perkins, though… I only met him once, but I think the two of them started dating."</p>

<p>Kyle sipped his drink again and nodded, flicking through his notes with his other hand.  "They dated for a time while Jennifer was in college, but eventually parted ways.  Good terms, too, from what I could gather.  They're still friends," he said, looking back to Liz.  "Might I ask you, Mrs. Warner, do you remember the day you first met Kyle?  From what I gather from a Claire Rosenberg, Grace Newberry, Hope Faulkner, Isabell Wood, Daisy Tipper, and Zylphia Pajitnov… that was January third, 2002, yes?"</p>

<p>Elizabeth nodded, taking a good swallow of her whine.  Sam had named off all of her old high school friends, shallow as they had been… most of them on the cheerleading squad.  She remembered getting really hot that day… she even quit the squad only to return to it the very next day.  Liz took another sip of wine, and looked into Sam's eyes just as the waitress set their food down and wandered off.  "I remember that day," Liz found herself saying.</p>

<p>"Do you remember what you talked about on the field?  I have it on good authority from a source that wishes not to be named that your conversation had to do with the town curse," he explained, taking a knife and fork to begin cutting his turkey up.  His tone remained kind.  Part of him hoped he wasn't waisting his time while another part of him just wanted not to upset her if he was.</p>

<p>It was at that moment that a teenager who had entered the bar with his friends a little while after Sam walked up to Sam and Liz's table.  Elizabeth noticed him right away, but Sam did not.  It took the young man clearing his throat before Sam turned and looked up at the boy.  "Help you?" Sam asked.</p>

<p>"You owe me money," the young man said to Sam.</p>

<p>"I don't think so," Sam blinked.</p>

<p>"You told that cop outside that I was parked in a handicap," he said, leaning over to look Sam in the eyes.  "My friends and I were just shootin the shit, and you called the man on us."</p>

<p>"The man?" Sam grinned, thinking that was funny.  "Look, kid…"</p>

<p>"I'm not your kid," the young man said.</p>

<p>"Didn't say you were," Sam sighed.  "There just happen to be a cop pulling into the diner and I just happen to notice a woman in a car with a handicap sticker on her car looking for a parking space.  You just <i>happen</i> to be sitting in your convertible talking to your friends in the <i>only</i> handicap space in the parking lot.  It was too big a coincidence to ignore, alright?  I couldn't <i>not</i> tell the cop," Sam shrugged.  

<p>"Transform or Dare!" Elizabeth blurted out in the direction of Sam and the teenager.  She was finally responding to Sam's earlier question of what her, Jennifer, and Kyle had been talking about, but now it seemed really out of place.  "I remember that… I think that we were&#151;"</p>

<p>"Transform," Sam said with a straight face, looking back to her.  He playfully pointed his fork at her, then looked at the kid for a moment.</p>

<p>"Pardon?" she blinked, completely thrown off from what she was about to say.  She'd almost entirely ignored the fact another person had walked up while they were talking.  For his part, the kid looked a little confused about the conversation.</p>

<p>"Sorry, habit," Sam said, honestly, holding up his hands defensively.  "I've been looking into the curse for so long that I'm just use to answering the question wherever I hear it, just in case," he smiled with a shrug.</p>

<p>"But wouldn't you rather have Dare?" she wondered… "And I didn't ask you…" she said, but she knew that she <i>had</i> asked.  She just <i>had</i> to know if it would work, even if it seemed crazy.  "I was just saying the name of the town curse."</p>

<p>Sam nodded and glanced down to his iPhone.  "Well, I picked transform… so please be kind," he grinned at her.  Liz smiled and nodded, taking another sip of her whine.  It was at that moment that the teenaged boy pulled back and slammed his fist into Sam's shoulder.  "Ow!" he said, rubbing his shoulder, looking up at him.  "It's been over a minute, you know," he said to the kid.  "<i>You</i> didn't pick either, so <i>you</i> get both," Sam said and just started to laugh.  This infuriated the kid further, and he looked like he was going to make more out of it just then…</p>

<p>It was about that time that the cop who Sam had met outside got up from his table and walked over to the group, putting a hand on the teen's shoulder.  Slowly, he turned and pulled him away from Sam and Liz, walking him back to the front door and beginning to talk with him.  Sam watched over the back of the booth for a moment before shaking his head and looking back to Liz.  She had finished her wine, and looked a little in shock.</p>

<p>"You handled that really well," she offered.  "I probably would have hit him back," she grinned, a little rosy in the cheeks.  Her head was swaying a bit in place now as it obviously hadn't been the only alcohol she had so far that day.</p>

<p>Sam shrugged, "In high school, I was the nerdy kid outcast type.  I never got in a fight mind you," he said, serious, "but I had some good practice ignoring the wannabe bullies."  He shrugged, "You gunna be nice with your Transform, then?" he wondered.  "You know, mine… probably not his."</p>

<p>Elizabeth patted his hand, "Your transformation can be into the physical form that you see yourself as on the inside, rather than how you appear right now," she grinned at him.  "…And that, um, no one will think its strange.. you turning into it, I mean.  Just in case?  Hopefully that'll be something nice for you," she giggled a little.  "As for the kid, well… hm… well, I guess he probably is using his car as an extension of his… <i>ego</i>," she half-asked, and Sam nodded.  "So lets say he can transform into his dream car… 'cept it can talk like KITT on Knight Rider," she laughed a bit.</p>

<p>"I like that…" Sam grinned, scratching the black hairs slowly beginning to thicken on the back of his right hand.  "Don't get many inanimate transformies who can tell their stories since they loose their mouths," he chuckled.  "And his Dare?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know… I dare him to forget who got him the ticket and…" she waved a hand off to the side, "Give you a ride anywhere you want to go?"  The waitress reappeared to refill their drinks, but informed Elizabeth that refills were not free on wine.  Once Sam said he would cover the meal, Elizabeth nodded to the young woman.  She herself had once had a job like this one when she'd become pregnant.  Sighing, she looked back to Sam.  "Before all that… juvenile nonsense… where were we?"</p>

<p>"Why didn't you pick Dare?" she wondered, noticing that his eyebrows were getting thicker and darker, but not thinking it was all that strange.</p>

<p>"I find Dares are more dangerous.  They allow a person's mind to be altered… their perceptions to be changed to something other than how they perceived the world before," he said, feeling warmer as his hair thickened over his chest and back under his cloths.  "Transformations can mess with your thinking a <i>little</i>… or how people think of you… but they're usually much harder to word to mess with your mind than a Dare is," explained Sam.  "Might just be a personal perspective… I also choose Tails every time a coin is flipped," he shrugged, taking a sip of his Pepsi as he was nearing completion of his meal.</p>

<p>"Well," Liz said, taking up her second glass of wine, "I think that the other thing I remember was not remembering," she said, and Sam looked a little confused.  "You'd asked me about the conversation," she reminded him.  Sam nodded, and picked his iPhone back up to take notes.  "I think Kyle told me… Dared me… to forget everything I knew about Transform or Dare," the words having lost their powers now that she had already passed it on.  "And I did.  I thought I learned about the curse when I got to college, but I remember something about a sheep-woman and a scrawny nerd trying to… take it away from me?" she wondered.</p>

<p>Sam remembered being a scrawny nerd… now he was just below Wii Fit's category for Obese.  Running his left hand down against his belly, he could actually feel as the fat there was slowly turning into muscle… tightening up into something much stronger.  Still, his changing form didn't seem all that strange to him all things considered.  "Well, that might make sense if you think about it," he said.  "A lot of the way these stories end is either by some people standing up and undoing the curse or passing it on to people who can't pass it back."</p>

<p>Elizabeth blinked.  She watched as the color of Sam's eyes shifted from brown to green and filled out a little thicker in color like a wild animal.  His ears slowly became pointed and his canines grew a little longer.  Still, it didn't seem all that strange considering the topic they were on.  "No tag-backs?" she asked, wondering to what Sam was referring to.</p>

<p>"Kind of," he said, finishing his last bit of turkey.  "If a person doesn't choose either, or only chooses Dare, then you could Dare them not to pass it back to you.  You might be able to Dare them not to pass it on at all, actually, but that's not been tested.  Furthermore, if you turn someone into a coat or a," Same searched for something else inanimate, "A napkin holder," he said, sliding the one on the table over… "They may or may not still understand that they were a person… but without the ability to speak, they can't pass on the curse," he explained.</p>

<p>"So, like, just making someone an animal would work?" Mrs. Warner asked.</p>

<p>"From what I have gathered, no.  If, for example, you become a dog… it would be possible to spell out words in sand, or even use the curse on <i>other</i> canines," he explained.  "Girls getting turned into <i>actual</i> bitches is quite a theme through the stories I have gathered.  Some <i>like</i> what they become, some are tricked by a dog and loose the curse to them, and some use words drawn out in the sand or something to have others ask the T or D <i>for</i> them."</p>

<p>"Oh, uh… Transform?" Liz asked.  "You just said&#151;"</p>

<p>"Doesn't work like that," Sam smiled.  "That's why I keep saying 'the curse'.  In order for the curse to go off, you actually have to <i>say</i> the whole phrase out… sometimes not even as a question," he pointed out, taking a sip of his drink.  "Hannibal-Style: 'say it with the respect it deserves'," he grinned.  "It also has to be understood in the medium in which it was created or it doesn't work."</p>

<p>Elizabeth watched as Sam's ears slowly slid upwards onto his head, filling out into the triangles that a dog's ears might have.  His nose turned into a black colored and little straight whiskers pushed out from the sides of it as his face pushed out slowly into a muzzle, covering over in deep black fur.  He canines thickened out in the top and bottom of his mouth and curved over big like those of a sabertooth tiger.  The teeth inside of his muzzle became white and shape and more numerous than the average dog's would be, even going so far as to grow in a much shorter second row of teeth behind the first not unlike a shark.</p>

<p>"I am not sure what you mean," Liz said, watching Sam's face.  It was unfortunate that her asking that no one find his transformation strange happened to include herself.  It just didn't seem that odd that his hair began to fill out in a thick off the back of his head and down his neck not unlike a lion's mane.  It was thick and black and moved as he moved his head, the muscles of his shoulders and arms thickening up as his skin all over started to turn a deep black.</p>

<p>"Let's say someone spoke the question… you would have to hear it," he explained as his legs slowly shifted in place, the muscles there filling out up under his skin.  "If they texted it to you, you would have to read it… or they'd have to hear it on a answering machine, or read it in their e-mail… or feel it in brail if they are blind," he explained as the nails on his fingers and toes started to fill out into thick black claws that bordered on being talons.  "So, if you can't hear someone ask the question, it doesn't work… though if no one else hears it either, then you don't actually pass it on so no loss," he shrugged his wider shoulders.</p>

<p>"But you can ask more than one person at a time… like I apparently just did," she said, motioning to Sam.  There were the sounds of screaming from somewhere outside in the parking lot, but she didn't really bat it an eye… it was a bad side of town, after all.  "How many people can you ask at once?"</p>

<p>"I have heard different numbers for that," Sam said as his lower legs reshaped into something that resembled a cross between human and canine, the muscles within binding themselves up into something stronger and heavier than they had been before.  Slowly he reached down and pulled of his shoes and socks.  Meanwhile, he could feel a tail sliding out his backside and uncomfortably push against the inside of his pants.  Glancing around, he reached down pulled the back of his pants down far enough to let his tail out.  "Personally, I think it can be any number of people so long as they either are actually being asked or <i>think</i> they are being asked."</p>

<p>"So you could make an announcement at a school pep rally and ask Transform or Dare?" Liz wondered.</p>

<p>"Yes," Sam nodded, shifting his lower body as his butt began to fill out rounder and his testicles slowly began to recede into his body with a kind of squishing feeling.  "<i>But</i>," he said, "I don't know about <i>you</i> but I almost never listened to my pep rally… so if someone were to ask the group in general and I'm not paying attention, I'd be immune because it wasn't actually directed <i>at</i> me," he explained.  His penis was slowly softening and shrinking downward to four inches, three inches, two, and then one… pressing flat against his body and slowly forming into two mounds covering in fur.  "But anyone listening who considered the question to be <i>for</i> them would have to deal with the question just as if someone had called out my name specifically."</p>

<p>"Do you realize you're growing breasts?" Elizabeth asked, watching as Sam's chest was beginning to push outwards.  Though his muscles were bound up inside of him, it didn't stop the feminine push of new breasts breaking passed buds and beyond the basic A-Cup as they appeared.  "I mean, I guess it makes a kind of sense what with this whole curse thing going on, but I wasn't expecting you to be a girl."</p>

<p>"That's a personal story and not part of all this exposition," he chuckled.  "Needless to say, I have managed to find someone who actually had the curse to pass on and now I have it.  You've been a great interview Mrs. Warner, and worth every penny," he smiled as he felt his crotch rearranging itself and pulling inwards.  The mounds that had already formed there became the outer lips to his vulva and still it didn't seem strange to him, now a her.  "Here," she said as she pulled out her wallet, "Two hundred dollars, and another one hundred for passing The Curse onto me," she smiled, handing Liz the money.</p>

<p>"You don't know what a load off my chest this is to me," she smiled, taking the money.  "All this time I thought I was going crazy with these half and forth memories.  I've really enjoyed talking with you… can I call you sometime, you know, if I have questions about how The Curse works?" Elizabeth smiled at Sam.</p>

<p>"Load off your chest and a load onto mine," Sam laughed a bit, reaching up and feeling the bounce and softness of his new breasts as they had passed beyond the usual female range of size before they had stopped quite large.  "And, yes, of course.  Why, if I can prove The Curse is real to others in a permanent way… that'll be a great victory for me and Glendale," she said to Liz, shifting as her tail filled out thicker behind her along the inside of the booth.</p>

<p>"What makes it so important to Glendale?" Liz asked, putting the money away and watching as she wasn't sure Sam was done changing or not.</p>

<p>"The Curse is confined here… you can't transfer it to someone outside of town and it also has no effect if you try and use it beyond the limits of our geographic region.  That's why plenty of people see strange things in Glendale and shrug it off… because things are naturally strange here," Sam smiled and shrugged.  "Take me, for example… if I looked like this in Albany, for example, I might end up in the pound… or as some experiment in a government lab," she said.</p>

<p>"I meant for the town, specifically… why would it be important for people here?" Elizabeth repeated, not sure what Sam was going for with all of this.</p>

<p>"People can't ever <i>see</i> The Curse for what it is, so it continues.  No one fights it… and somehow everything always reaches an equilibrium.  Why, I would bet hard money that not one of the part-animal, gender-swapped, shrunken, Big Bad Wolf, or tentacle-monster people in this cursed town are even supposed to be the way they are.  It's all been a warp of reality or some mass delusion, and I intend to figure it out before the town's bicentennial this coming January," Sam smiled to her.  "Whether this be scientific, mystical, or magical, I intent to discover the truth of this curse and track it to its origin, whatever that might be," she explained as the waitress dropped the bill onto the table.</p>

<p>"I don't know if I could help you," Liz said, thinking this would be a great way to get the power of The Curse back for herself, "but I would do what I could to help," she offered.</p>

<p>"I will keep that in mind," Same nodded to her, slowly sliding out of the booth to go up to the cashier and pay for the meal.  She reached out with her now pad-covered palm of a hand to shake Elizabeth's hand.  For all intents and purposes, Sam was the same height and size as before… but she was obviously more ripped and buff within than space.  Her breasts went forward from her chest a good distance, but so did her tail far out behind her.  It was almost like, along with her new digigrade legs, that her tail was helping to balance everything out.  Her fur was the deepest black Liz had ever seen, and her eyes were a lightly glowing green.  "It was nice to meet you, Mrs. Warner," Sam's canine muzzle grinned long into a double-layered toothy smile.</p>

<p>The transformation was not strange… but the final look of Sam and that new smile made Liz a bit uncomfortable.  "You know how to reach me," she nodded to her, shaking her hand and then heading for the front door of the diner.</p>

<hr>
<div style="font: 12pt Arial Black;">Some Time Later…</div>

<p>Sam's transformation wasn't all that strange to her, it was true, but it was just a tiny bit inconvenient.  Since Liz hadn't said anything about everyone always thinking Sam had been that way, no one did.  She got a few strange looks because of it.  The transformation itself?  Not strange.  Being a part animal, part human, part 'I made this up to role-play in chatrooms online' kind of creature?  <i>That</i> is the part that's strange.</p>

<p>Without history rewritten, Sam had to carry her somewhat torn shoes and have her pants down partway over her plump new bottom as her tail had to ride over the top of her waist band… not to mention a woman's figure was not designed to fit either into her jeans or under her shirt which both hugged her body super tight by now.  Also, she was just a tiny bit horny.</p>

<p>"This is what I get for looking into the town curse," she said as she kicked the door shut behind her like she always did when she got home.  Sam had given a cursory look around the parking lot when she had left the diner, but no sign of a talking car anywhere.  She would have to look for that teenager later… if only she had gotten his name.</p>

<p>Making her way through the three bedroom apartment she shared with her gay friend Conner and her other, straight friend John, Sam stepped down the hallway and into her room, closing the door behind her.  She locked it out of habit and went over to her computer to transfer in her notes and make a few additions.  "What a day," she said to herself.  "A <i>real</i> experience with The Curse and I'm so amazingly lucky… I get turned into my online Fursona," Sam grinned to himself, looking downward.  "This is going to suck to explain, but who cares… only me and my friends know what this form is to me… everyone else in town can just stare," she decided as she hit the power button on her iMac and stood up to head for the bathroom.</p>

<p>Biggest breadwinner gets master bedroom, and so it was with Sam.  Finally turning on a light, she realized she had even more excellent night vision than when she was human to have made it all this way in the darkening apartment.  Stepping up to the sink in the bathroom, Sam took in her appearance in the mirror.  "Total freak," she nodded to herself with a sigh as she lifted off her 'Rock, Paper, Scissors; Choose Wisely' black shirt from over her overtly large breasts.</p>

<p>Reaching up, she squished them and kneaded them against her form, taking in the feel of her own fur between her fingers.  Moving the fur away from her nipples, she could see that they were black themselves… and a further inspection of her brand new abs revealed that where her two breasts were human-like up top, she had for nipples across and six nipples down across her different in-human, un-canine looking belly structure.</p>

<p>"Total freak," she repeated to herself, sighing a bit.  As a guy and a furry, he had always been interested in male partners… but never <i>as</i> a male.  <i>Always</i> female… <i>always</i> heterosexual… and <i>always</i> with a desire to be a mother.  He had created his Fursona to be able to go into heat more often than once a year while also planning for her to have huge litters of super-wolves as children.</p>

<p>"Who knew that going into heat during the full moon of every month would backfire on me?" she sighed, then reached up and put a hand to her lips.  "Awe, crap… I still sound like the human me… that's going to be… awkward," she considered, thinking that over.  Since she had always played as this creation in text-based chatrooms, she never once considered what she would sound like… so she still sounded like her male self.</p>

<p>She squeezed her hand into a fist and looked at all her muscles flex.  In the role-play, the character was originally from some other planet with wolf-looking people living there.  Nothing special… kind of like superman, except she got her power from earth's moon light instead of sun.  It was stupid, she knew, but it was just part of the Fursona's history since she'd been playing that way since middle school.  Now all the alien organs inside of her and the strange configuration of extra muscles all seemed to have more weight and reality to them now that they were, in fact, reality.  Part of her could even feel the 'naturally occurring carbon-fiber' that made up her bones like she stole from Avatar recently.</p>

<p>"And now I have to pee," she said to herself, often using silence as a way to think aloud.  Sam pulled up the toilet seat and sat down as she usually did… just this time she now had nothing hanging off the front of her to aim downward.  Her hands were still there anyway, feeling her thick fur-covered lips before she pulled her fingers away and did her best to release her bladder… or what accounted for one in this new body.  Needless to say, having urine pass down instead of forward and out was quite odd and very little would make this whole change sink in more than having the privacy to find out all the new things about a changed body.</p>

<p>Sam wiped herself between her legs with some toilet paper and then washed her hands.  Stepping out of the bathroom on her toes naturally she flicked her tail back and forth to note how it moved with her.  Sitting on the edge of the bed, she moved her legs further apart and looked down at herself.  "Now… for the obligatory first time as a female," she sighed putting a hand down and moving her lips apart with her fingers.  Looking down, she tried to see inside and found that her body could bend all the way forward like any canine's to the point where her muzzle reached her tunnel.  Cautiously, she slowly stuck her tongue out and ran it over her own lips, then slowly inside of herself.  A shutter and then a hesitation… she moved her head back and hands out to the side.  "Maybe later… maybe… that's just a little… I don't know," she sighed.</p>

<p>Checking her calendar on the wall next to her, she saw it would be a full moon in three days.  "Full moon for five days… five days of heat.  If I get pregnant by a dog or wolf the gestation will be twenty days," she made notes to herself, thinking that now she'd get to be a mother for real and often.  "Shortly thereafter, another full moon, and repeat if I want," she thought.  "If I mate with a human, I'll be pregnant for longer and the kid'll look like me or the father, maybe," she thought.  It had always been a part of the concept, but she'd never role-played sex with a human before.</p>

<p>"Hm," she considered, reaching up to her muzzle with her hands.  "I wonder," she said and started to pull left and right on her lower jaw.  Sure enough, it stretched wide not unlike a snake's would, the bones actually in two parts connected my stretching internal connections.  Her neck stretched a lot too, allowing her to be able to make a big gaping opening that thinned her mane as a huge opening was made down into her stomach.</p>

<p>Sam grinned to herself, considering naughty things… "So… vore is still in the picture," she spoke as she held her muzzle two feet wide and then let go to have it go back to normal size.  "Extreme stomach acids and cartoonish contortions should allow me to swallow and consume someone my own size in less than an hour," she wondered, rubbing her chin.  She giggled a bit, "This is so awesome… no one ever gets options like this… oh!  I need to make notes on the conversation," she thought, hurrying over to her computer and moving the mouse away from screen saver.</p>

<p>"Now… let's see.  What have I learned, what do I know… who to I talk to next?" she wondered, rubbing her breasts with her free hand.  "Awesome alien canine wolf body yada yada… greatest thing to happen to me ever, but not the <i>point</i>," she frowned.  "I have to find out more about this curse."</p></p>
