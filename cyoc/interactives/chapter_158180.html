<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam knocked a third time on the door to his roommate&#39;s bedroom, then, hearing no answer, turned the doorknob. Too bad for Nick if he was sleeping, but they had stuff to do today and he didn&#39;t want to wait till tonight. Entering, he sniffed, knowing just what Nick must have been doing. Except... the bed wasn&#39;t made and there was obviously no one lying there. Had Nick left? He could have sworn he hadn&#39;t. <br />
<br />
There, between the covers, he noticed a perky red dickhead oozing pre. <br />
<br />
... How? he thought. Had to be a dildo. Nick obviously wasn&#39;t in bed, the covers proved that. And it was just like him to leave his sex toys in his bed for later. Sighing, Sam leaned over and pulled the toy out, only to startle at the softness of its texture and the heat pulsing under his skin, like a real dick. <br />
<br />
There was something weird going on. Sam examined the dildo closer, realizing the measurements felt familiar. Seven inches long, uncut, curved. And he knew that trim at the base. Bemused, he pumped his hand, watching the balls bounce as he was so used to. <br />
<br />
&quot;Did Nick make a life accurate dildo of himself?&quot; he asked, laughing at how ridiculous the whole sentence was.  <br />
<br />
Feeling a little excited himself, he plopped the toy upside down and pulled back the foreskin completely, letting the pre drip straight down to the floor. His loin immediately heat up at the sight, tingling from arousal. <br />
<br />
However, before he could do much more than that, he heard a beeping noise, and the dildo in his hand twitched. With a weird popping noise, it suddenly expanded and shifted, becoming his one and only roommate. Naked as the day he was born. <br />
<br />
Sam couldn&#39;t believe his eyes. &quot;What the fuck just happened? Did you spike my beer again?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick, in all his naked glory, just jumped back on the bed and turned them over until he was holding his phone. Quickly, he unlocked it and showed him a new screen. &quot;Someone published a weird, fucking awesome exclusive application. I got picked from all the registered database.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;An app?&quot; Sam repeated weakly, not even caring that Nick wasn&#39;t dressing up. They&#39;d experimented anyway. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hell yeah. I&#39;ve tried it three times since last night. It&#39;s like a Russian roulette, except you don&#39;t die, you turn into a penis. Yours, obviously. And you can&#39;t tell how long it&#39;ll last till you do it. Nothing compares to that feeling just before you click, I swear.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And you don&#39;t even *know* what it&#39;ll do before you try?&quot; How could a phone even do all that? He&#39;d be more skeptical if he hadn&#39;t witnessed the reversal process first hand. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nope. Could be anything. I&#39;ve only got like, fifteen minutes, two hours and eight hours so far though. Here, look, you have a list of all the possibilities.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam rolled his eyes, but accepted the phone and started scrolling through the Q&A section of the app. There were a few options, saying they were still in beta testing phazes and needed volunteers to test things out. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not even complete?&quot; Sam said, unimpressed. &quot;What if something goes wrong? Why would you even try that thing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, you do NOT understand just how fucking amazing it feels like to be turned into your own dick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam paused, blushing. Shit. Now he was imagining Nick&#39;s hands rubbing over his body and bringing him to completion again. Fuck. He turned back to the list. It mentioned independant and dependant dicking status, being attached or not to another dude. Things like the ability to talk were options, somehow. Even the duration was randomized. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not even everything, dude.&quot; Nick enthusiastically stole his phone back and clicked back to the main menu. This time though, he clicked on the options and two red squares appeared in the bottom corners. &quot;It recognizes different fingerprints too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... Right. So nobody can tell you turn yourself into a dick in your free time?&quot; Sam drawled, hoping his friend wouldn&#39;t notice the heat flushing to his face. <br />
<br />
Nick chuckled. &quot;Who the hell cares about that? It&#39;s &#39;in&#39; right now anyway. No, the point is that you can have couple options. Or fuckbuddies in our case.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam hit Nick&#39;s shoulder. That dickhead. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, no violence. We didn&#39;t choose a safeword. I kid, I kid. Anyway, it unlocks new options. Like, you can be someone else&#39;s dick so you&#39;re not just laying around there, getting blueballed. Or you&#39;re both dicked at the same time. Or hell, I heard a rumor you can be combined into one massive dick. There&#39;s an achievement for that too. So, please, please, please, can we give it a shot?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam stared incredulously as his friend brought his hands together like he was praying. Was it really that pleasant an experience? &quot;Fine, give me that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam scoffed at the &#39;Terms and Agreement&#39; popup. Had anyone ever read these things? Annoyed, he just flipped through the screens, went to the bottom and pressed his fingerprint again. <br />
<br />
Immediately, the phone&#39;s screen changed into a casino setting, icons changing into others in the blink of an eye. It was impossible to try and figure out the timing, as they did not even seem to follow a set rotation. As randomized as it could be. On one side of the screen was a spot with his fingerprint, and on the other, one for Nick. &quot;Gotta press again. No coercion with that app,&quot; Nick said. <br />
<br />
Sam nodded. Made sense. But now he was truly too curious not to do it. <br />
<br />
Right under Sam&#39;s icon, the roulette stopped on a picture perfect representation of his dick. How the app had gotten that image, he did not know, but... His heartbeat picked up. W-was he going to get dicked on his first try? His pants felt like they&#39;d shrunk from how stiff he was. <br />
<br />
Nick read his expression and let his finger hover above the stop button. &quot;I thought you said this was stupid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just fucking go already!&quot; <br />
<br />
With another laugh, Nick pressed the goddamn stop button and teased Sam as the changing icons stabilized on something. <br />
<br />
The icon with Sam&#39;s penis was linked to the one with Nick&#39;s body by an arrow, a chain surrounding the whole equation <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah! You&#39;re going to be my big fuckstick as your dicking baptism, dude.&quot;<br />
<br />
At the very top of the screen, the timer duration slowed down, stopping on &#39;One&#39; for the number. (Sam ignored the pang of disappointment in his chest. Starting small was for the better. In a way, he&#39;d gotten lucky, probably.)<br />
<br />
And the unit... scrolled past hour... day... <br />
<br />
... week... <br />
<br />
&quot;A year?!&quot; Sam screamed in shock, his blood turning to ice. &quot;What the hell?&quot; He glared at Nick. &quot;What the hell, Nick?!&quot;<br />
<br />
That fucking traitor backed away with one hand in front of him, and the other pulling his phone back protectively. &quot;Whoa, dude, I did not even know that was an option.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, cancel it! I&#39;m not gonna be your cock for -&quot;<br />
<br />
The phone beeped. Then blinded him with a flash. <br />
<br />
Sam blinked, or, it felt as if he did. Slowly, the appartment came back into focus, the last white of the phone&#39;s flash fading. But he quickly noticed what was wrong. He was looking at the room from a sort of bird&#39;s view and Nick&#39;s bed had grown exponentially, looking like a football field more than just a piece of furniture! In sheer reflex, Sam tried to step back, but found his body only twitching. <br />
<br />
With a sort of excited fear, he realized that the large trunks on both sides of him were Nick&#39;s legs. His own were gone. <br />
<br />
He... he really was a dick. It didn&#39;t feel real. He couldn&#39;t move his arms either, didn&#39;t *have* arms anymore. He was only a cock, hanging between his fuckbuddy&#39;s legs. No, that wasn&#39;t right either. He wasn&#39;t just a dick. He was STUCK as a dick for a whole year! What were people going to say? He had responsibilities! A job, studies, friends! He couldn&#39;t even tell talk to explain this. Not... not that he would have dared explain that he voluntarily turned himself into his roomie&#39;s penis. He would have rathered stayed a dick forever than tell others about this. <br />
<br />
The idea alone rendered him dizzy with pleasure, pumping blood throughout his body. He went stiff, standing almost upright over his low hanging balls. His view of the room shifted alongside that, giving him a troubling view of the gigantic body he was attached to, and Nick&#39;s leery grin. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be in such a hurry, dude,&quot; Nick chuckled again, patting Sam&#39;s head and pulling up his foreskin. &quot;I know it feels great. But we&#39;ve got plenty of time to have fun together, don&#39;t we? Though, shit, I might have to find a new roommate. And a new fuckbuddy. Wouldn&#39;t you like that, Sam?&quot;</p>
