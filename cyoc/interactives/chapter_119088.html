<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">when he shouted you to stop as you started to storm off running that in an instant, you froze as you couldn&#39;t move. &quot;I tell you before that you will have no choice, but to follow most of every command you are given. now, as for your next command, I now order you to come back over her.&quot; Dean said as it was that moment that you suddenly rushed over to him as you could not run from him.<br />
<br />
&quot;now then, please listen to what I have to say.&quot; Dean said.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO! YOU LISTEN! I HAD IT WITH YOU THAT I AM NOW SO MAD AT YOU DEAN! FURTHERMORE ...&quot; you yelled like you usually do, but in rage.<br />
<br />
&quot;be quiet and listen to me!&quot; Dean shouted as he interrupted you that you were soon silenced as your mouth clamped shut. unable to open your mouth that it was like glued shut as you started to whimper in fear. you couldn&#39;t build up enough will to leave on your own as it course through your body as your self confidence over the situation dropped.<br />
<br />
&quot;now listen to what I have to say here. as you know that we&#39;re very close friend together, but truth be told, I never told anyone my deepest secret as i&#39;m about to tell you. you see... I had a crush on you for a very long time now, and now your a vixen that obeys orders, it makes me want you even more. what i&#39;m trying to say is... I love you not as my best friend, but as a lover. this may sound strange to you at first, but it&#39;s the true.&quot; Dean said as you suddenly felt embarrassed that it made you blush while freezing up out of shyness.<br />
<br />
surprised about him having a crush on you as a lover that You then looked back at Dean as you saw him with his eyes looking sensitive. he also looked cute to you as you&#39;ve known him ever since you were both little kids. he looked so sweet, so handsome, so strong that you felt submissive in front of him as you had a secret crush on him to, you tried to hide it from him.<br />
<br />
&quot;you... you mean... you had a crush on me? the whole time?&quot; you asked as you were puzzled by this.<br />
<br />
&quot;the whole time.&quot; he said when you soon noticed that you were hugging Dean as he was hugging you gently with one hand on your back while the other cradling your ass cheek. &quot;besides, what&#39;s a beautiful vixen like yourself going to do all alone?&quot; Dean asked sarcastically.<br />
<br />
&quot;hay, it&#39;s ok. I promise that I won&#39;t hurt you as we&#39;re the only two of our kind. please, come with me so I can protect you.&quot; Dean said as you were starting to cry in his arms that your tail dropped back down between your legs.<br />
<br />
subbing in his arms that you didn&#39;t hear him giving you an order. &quot;now then, I want you to only obey me, in case someone gives you an order you don&#39;t want to do from them. I also don&#39;t want you to try and not to leave like that again while being a submissive type of girl who&#39;s sensitive, but sweet.&quot; you nodded as to obey his command that you were getting a hoard of mixed emotions about this situation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good girl, now then, how do feel about staying with me at my home?&quot; Dean asked.<br />
<br />
You paused for a moment before your compulsion forced you to reply. &quot;Honestly, I don&#39;t know about any of this, but I doubt that either of us can fully fit into society like this.&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know how hard this question is for you, so I&#39;ll give you another question that will help. How do you feel in my arms right now?&quot; Dean asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I feel...&quot; one emotion stood out as it was,&quot;safe.&quot; you said as you then looked up at Dean.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now then, let&#39;s go home Jade, so we can decide on what to do from there.&quot; Dean said.<br />
<br />
&quot;J..Jade?&quot; You asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you do need a new name now, don&#39;t ya?&quot; Dean asked sarcastically.<br />
<br />
You felt compelled to obey, so you nodded and you did like. at least Dean didn&#39;t name you anything. offensive. Dean walked over and put his arm over your shoulder as you walked with him. from time to time, Dean would looked over you as he also would look at your breasts that in which made you blush as you try to hid them with your arms, But you didn&#39;t get mad at Dean for it. you found yourself being touched when he took notice of your attractive charms as your your breasts bounced around a bit when you walk, but not too much.<br />
<br />
You eventually arrived at Dean&#39;s home as he walked you inside. feeling tiered, you went over to his couch and went to bed, but you didn&#39;t noticed Dean covering you with a blanket as you were a sleep. the next morning came that the first thing you did was....</p>
