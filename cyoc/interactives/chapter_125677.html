<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Claudia smiled broadly as the group sat down to eat. Throughout the meal the girls talked excitedly about their upcoming plans for the next couple of days. Tonight the group would have a sleepover, watching movies and engageing in the kind of talk only preteen girls could enjoy. Claudia, Tricia and Karen would be joining them for this despite some reservations. Tricia, who was apprehensive about the ring, had suggested that one of them remain an adult. Claudia vehemently opposed this and eventual talked the other two into becoming young for the evening. To ease Tricia’s fears she had even asked Mika to come up with a youth potion. This way they could control how young they became over time.<br />
<br />
Claudia glanced at both Karen and Tricia. The two women appeared to be in their late forties by now. Most of the grey had disappeared from their hair while the wrinkles in their skin had lessened. They both appeared to have at least 3/4 of their drinks left. Glancing down at her own glass she realized she was about half way through with it. A quick glance at her reflection made her realize she was in her late thirties now. Her hair was now completely blond with only a few lines around her eyes. “Hey you two need to pick up the pace,” she said with a laugh. “I don’t want to be the first one to experience childhood again.” Tricia and Karen laughed softly before answering. “Don’t worry Claud,” Tricia said. “We’ll finish up soon as soon as we finish cleaning up.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks again for dinner,” Samantha said as she brought her plate to the sink. “That really hit the spot.” Claudia smiled. “Pleasures all mine Sammy. Why don’t you show Tricia and Karen where their going to be staying tonight.” Samantha groaned. “Ugh fine come On Tricia. Come on Ms. Morgan.” <br />
<br />
“You know we’re not in school Sammy,” Karen frowned. “You can call me Karen.” Samantha spun around placing her hands on her hips befor glowering at Karen. “Well right now you still look like Ms. Morgan to me,” she grumbled. “While your an adult your Ms. Morgan when you get around my age then maybe we can talk.” Karen sighed. “Fine Sammy if that’s what you want.” “It is now follow me and try to keep up.” Sammy spun dramatically and quickly began leading Tricia and Karen to the spare bedroom.<br />
<br />
Claudia smiled. Watching Samantha and Karen interact brought back way too many memories of herself and Mika when they were kids. Like herself and Mika she noticed that Sammy and Karen were also very similar. She hoped that sooner rather than later the two would realize that and stop their petty argueing. As she finished the cleanup she gazed out at the living room. Mary Elise, Mika and Sophia were happily talking and watching t.v. Off to the side she could see Katie gazing out of the window. <br />
<br />
Throughout dinner Claudia noticed that Katie, while smiling, seemed to be down. Her eyes seemed full of sadness as she tried to get through dinner. Now the young girl was withdrawn from her friends, fingering her ring and looking out towards the street. Claudia was concerned now about what wAs on the young girls mind. Grabbing her drink Claudia began to make her way toward Katie.<br />
<br />
“You okay Katie?” She asked. Katie was startled for a moment befor looking at Claudia. “Oh sorry Claudia,” she said. “I was just lost in thought.” Claudia nodded as she sat in a nearby chair. “I noticed,” she said. “You’ve been lost in thought a lot lately. Care to talk about it?”<br />
<br />
Katie sighed as she glanced over at Claudia. “I, i dont know,” she said as she fingered her ring. “Things have been weird lately. Mika being a wizard kind of makes me feel less special. Lately everyone has been having adventures without me, and to be honest I really would rather have it that way.”<br />
<br />
Claudia nodded, trying not to be judge mental. She had noticed Katie wanting to use the Ring of Age less and less over the last two months. While it might be because of Mika’s magic she suspected something else. “I understand Katie,” she said. “It’s hard when something you were special for becomes less special when someone else has it. But I think it might be something else.” Katie glanced over at Claudia with a confused and indignant look. “WhAt do you mean,” she asked. “And how would you know what I am going through.”<br />
<br />
Claudia sighed and smiled. “Remember Katie I’ve already grown up once befor and I remember what it was like to have a rival and a friend. Mika and I always bumped heads as children too.” Katie shook her head. “No I’m not jealous of Mika,” she said quickly. “I’m actually really proud of what she’s done. It’s just, having the intelligence of a grown woman with the experience of a child is very frustrating.”<br />
<br />
Claudia nodded then smiled. “It’s Josh isn’t it,” she said. Katie paused before nodding. “How did you know?” She asked. Claudia smiled. “You forget I’ve already grown up once before. I know what it’s like to have a crush on someone and not be able to be with them.”<br />
<br />
Katie hung her head and sighed. “It’s so hard Claudia. I think about him all the time. I, i want to use the ring to be with him again. It’s silly I know but, but it’s the only thing I want in the world.”<br />
<br />
Claudia placed her hand on the young girls shoulder. “This is the part of growing up no one can prepare you for,” she said kindly. “Unfortunately you can not have everything you want in the world. Sometimes no matter how much you want something you just can’t have at and when it involves your heart it hurts. No amount of magic in the world can make things better.”<br />
<br />
Katie paused and smiled. “Thanks Claudia I appreciate that. I don’t know if it helps much but it was nice to hear.” Katie gave a tight hug to Claudia before tilting her head and smiling. “When did you become so smart?” She giggled.<br />
<br />
“With age comes wisdom,” she laughed. “Which reminds me I need to get rid of some of this age if we’re going to have some fun tonight.” Claudia took a sip of her drink and felt the familiar tingle. Katie watched as Claudia began to grow younger. The lines around her eyes began to disappear as her hair began to brighten. As the tingles subsided Claudia was now a grown woman of 30. Her breasts had become perkier as her curves filled out. Now she found her slacks a little tight around her hips and rear as her muscle returned.<br />
<br />
“Getting their slowly, “ Claudia said with a laugh. “Now why don’t you go and join the others while me, Tricia, and Karen finish up. We’ll be with you all soon.” Katie smiled and gave Claudia a quick hug. “Thank you Claudia,” Katie sighed. “It’s weird I can have talks with you about this kind of stuff.” Claudia blushed as she looked down at Katie. “Well I’m kinda of a friend and grandma all rolled into one. Definitely makes my life more interesting.”<br />
<br />
Katie smiled and ran to join her friends. Claudia watched her go before turning and heading back to the kitchen. Tricia, Karen and Claudia needed to finish cleaning and finish their drinks. After that their would be plenty of time for fun.</p>
