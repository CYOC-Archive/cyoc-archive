<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With your parents basking in the great news, it was now time to inform your girlfriend. Punching her number in your oversized yellow cell, you hear the usual ringing before that familiar voice comes through... <br />
<br />
“Hello?” Honking your nose, you tell her excitedly, “Great news sweetie! I got the job!” She laughs <br />
“Really?! That’s great Buttons! I had a feeling you would nab it! You tell your folks?” <br />
“Yep!” *honk* *honk* “Ya now speaking to a certified circus clown! Why don’t we celebrate with a meal? Just gonna acquaint myself with my new fam and I’ll come pick you up!” She bursts out laughing again. <br />
“On that Unicycle of yours?! Perish the thought! The circus isn’t far from my apartment, I’ll just meetcha there! Sound good?”  <br />
“Sounds like a plan! See you then! Love ya!” You let out three more honks before hanging up, leaving Christine in tears. You loved it when she laughed, a true dynamite gal for sure! Leaving the trailer, you go about introducing yourself to your new associates. Unbeknownst to you however, Mesmero had heard everything... <br />
<br />
Pulling into the parking lot, Christine locked the door and approached the front gate. Though happy, deep down, a part of her was...conflicted. She simply couldn’t deny it anymore... <br />
<br />
She had fallen in love. With you, Buttons the Clown. <br />
<br />
Out of all the men in her life, how is it that a clown managed to steal her heart? And now that you’ve landed your dream job, you’d be on tour all year round...away from her. The thought of being separated from you just simply made her heartache! As she neared the gate, a strange-looking man in suit and cape stood there, almost as if he was waiting for her... <br />
<br />
Bowing to her, he introduced himself: “Mesmero the Magnificent at your service. You are Button’s friend yes?” Christina nodded. “Yep, Christina Smith! I take it you’re also part of the crew here?” He gave off a devilish smile and answered: “Indeed...I was the one who interviewed him actually. He’s quite the talent...” He certainly was Christina thought to herself. How else would he win that Clown of the Year award? Mesmero continued: “Buttons will be with us shortly. In the meantime, would you care for some water?” <br />
“Certainly!” She answered. Revealing his wand, Mesmero playfully bopped her on the nose with it and gestured for her to follow. A big smile had just set on Christina’s face and as they entered one of the circus trailers, she began to feel slightly giddy. Taking a seat, Mesmero offered her a cup and took a seat across from her. <br />
<br />
“This is the trailer Buttons will occupy once we head out. Figured you’d be interested in seeing it...” The revelation caused Christine to a laugh.  <br />
<br />
“Really? It’s pretty big! Bigger than my own apartment actually!” Mesmero just smiled. <br />
“But of course! It’s meant for two. You will be joining him after all, yes?” The answer surprised Christina, who seemed taken by some strange ailment. Trying to contain herself, she answered... <br />
“I...heh...don’t know. I mean... I DID just lose...my job and all BUT...hehehe...I’m not sure I&#39;d be a good fit here...”Christina continued chuckling as she continued. “Honestly, I wish I was a clown. I’d ENJOY making people laugh and smile...plus I’d get to work alongside the man I love...” Though she tried to frown, her face remained affixed in a grin. “Alas, I just don’t have what it takes...”  <br />
<br />
“Are you so sure?” <br />
<br />
By then, all of Christine’s skin had turned chalk white, prompting the young woman to burst into endless giggles. Her teeth straightened and changed from a pale yellow to pearly white, while her lips filled up and converged into a bright red smile. Red eyeshadow took hold while her eyelashes became fuller and a few inches longer. In exchange, the hair on her eyebrows vanished, replaced with thin black lines one would draw with a marker. Her long blonde hair shifted to a more comical bright yellow, curling up ridiculously as it reached her neck and shoulders. Finishing her new face, pink blush appeared roughed over her cheeks while her nose erupted into a bright red orb. Christina caught a quick glimpse of her new self through one of the trailer mirrors but all it did was just intensify her laughter. Her clothes then started to shift and she was now outfitted in a yellow, red, and orange baby doll dress complete with shoulderpoofs, a petticoat, striped leggings, and large yellow clown shoes. Situated on the chest of her outfit was a big red nosed smiley with thick orange lines surrounded it, giving it the appearance of a sun. Curved under it in big red letters was... <br />
<br />
SUNNY SMILES <br />
<br />
That was...her name. <br />
<br />
Outside, her Porsche morphed into a glorified clown car, complete with horns, sirens and other silly commodities. The pictures at her house now displayed her new form whilst the awards and trophies she won as a child appreciated more...sillier merits. Her old letterman jacket now held host to all her clowning accomplishments and a smiling clown now took the place of her old school mascot. Pictures that once showcased you and her now presented Buttons and Sunny and soon enough, all her décor shifted to a merrier theme. Her first-place soccer trophy now showcased a clown with the inscription reading... <br />
<br />
1ST PLACE, FUNNIEST ACT! <br />
SUNNY SMILES <br />
WORLD CLOWN ASSOCIATION <br />
 <br />
New memories began to form inside Christine’s mind. Originally, she was raised by a single mother because her father was a no-good deadbeat who abandoned the two of them when she was six... <br />
<br />
No... that wasn’t right. No, no, her parents were clowns and her daddy died from a trapeze accident. She remembered crying on her bed all night upon hearing the news. It was during his funeral she met you, the son of one of his close friends. The two of you quickly hit it off, especially upon discovering that you were both attending the same school! Clowns have to stick together after all!  <br />
<br />
As Mesmero’s magic neared its completion, Christina’s laughing fit started to let up, and soon enough, a sense of clarity returned. Finishing her cup of water, she looked at Mesmero and asked. <br />
<br />
“So THIS is where Buttons and I are gonna crash from here on out?”  Christina’s voice was now high and cartoonish, though the difference never even registered to her. She always had such a voice... <br />
<br />
Mesmero nodded. “Indeed, is to your liking?” <br />
“YER DARN TOOTIN!!!” She responded excitedly. “Why, It&#39;s the perfect place for a pair like us!” Suddenly her phone pinged and upon looking it, there was a text from you... <br />
 <br />
“Getch yer caboose out her silly! Been waiting 5 mins for golly’s sake!” <br />
<br />
Putting your phone away, you rest yourself next to Sunny’s car, a big smile adoring your whitened face. Not a moment later, you see your beautiful Sunny running across the lot. Leaping into your arms, the two of you embrace, your red noses rubbing against one another as a series of honks ring across the nearly vacant lot. A long kiss is shared before the two of you stare into each other eyes. <br />
<br />
“I can’t believe it...after so long, our lifelong dream&#39;s about to come true...” You tell her as tears of joy begin to swell. Rubbing her nose against yours, Sunny responds with her usual enthusiasm, “I KNOW!! We’re finally a part of a circus!! Can’t wait to tell mum, she’ll be so happy!” You let out a big laugh before giving her another kiss. Getting into the car, the two of you hold one another as you decide how to celebrate...</p>
