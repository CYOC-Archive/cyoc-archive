<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen stepped outside. It was a cool spring morning, the air moist and fresh. She liked to take a walk through her parents&#39; expansive garden on mornings like these, especially on days she expected to be stressful. She&#39;d always felt that it helped ground her, and keep her calm no matter what the day had in store. She wasn&#39;t sure why she decided to walk through it today, since she didn&#39;t have any major finals or cheer practices coming up for at least another week. Maybe it was the stress of college admissions, or that dumb curse Kyle had prank called her about. Whatever reason it may be, she really took her time on her walk this morning, taking in all of the scents, sounds, and beauty of the cultivated floral environment.<br />
<br />
However, her day was about to get a lot more stressful. She&#39;d seen plenty of insects, and heard some birds chirp overhead, and it reassured her that Kyle&#39;s curse wasn&#39;t real. After all, she still had her arms, didn&#39;t she? She stooped down to watch a spider work out its web when some movement in her peripheral vision caught her attention. In the underbrush, a slug slowly pulsed its way towards the stone path.<br />
<br />
Jen was entranced. Even if she wanted to, she couldn&#39;t move. The slug continued towards the path, but once it reached in front of her, it turned. Jen realized with horror what was happening. Try as she might, she couldn&#39;t pull herself away. She cried as the slug crawled up onto her foot, then her leg, its cold, wet residue leaving a trail upwards.<br />
<br />
<i>No... no!! Anything but this!</i> she sobbed internally, still frozen in place. Time seemed to freeze as the snail made its way up. <i>Anything but a damn slug! Damnit, Kyle, why!!</i><br />
<br />
The slug finally made its way up her thigh, and with a sickening push, forced its way under her underwear. She shuddered as it entered her vagina. It felt horrible, cold, and the sudden shudder of pleasure she felt disgusted her. Her disgust was short lived, however, as the curse took effect.<br />
<br />
She collapsed, her arms barely breaking her fall as her legs grew together into one large mass. She cried as it pushed backwards while forcing her torso upwards, gaining an incredible amount of mass. She felt her organs rearrange as it grew in behind her, most of her human ones dissolving away underneath her skin. Replaced by excess adipose, her human torso gained a slight hint of chub, and the slug&#39;s organs took over their functions. The pulsing of her mass was overwhelming. Each growth spurt jolted her with a deep pleasure.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a new tingle demanded her attention. She began to panic as her arms went limp. <i>Why are my arms tingling? Why can&#39;t I move them??</i> she thought as they fell uselessly to her sides. Soon, to her horror, they began to almost deflate as the bones and muscle disappeared. Her fingers pulled in one-by-one, a small jolt of pleasure accompanying each disappearance. She could barely see what was happening through her tears. <i>Becoming half slug was curse enough, but now I&#39;m losing my arms?!</i><br />
<br />
Now her arms were just heavy, useless, featureless appendages, but this soon changed. They began to pull in, their mass being repurposed for her chest. Her breasts expanded slowly as what remained of her arms was sucked into her torso, until they were completely gone. Her chest had more than doubled in size, and almost hung to her slug-half, past her navel. She sobbed as her slug body continued to grow below her, unable to believe what happening to her.<br />
<br />
As the growth slowed, she glanced backwards. Jen gasped as she looked out on her lower half, stretching almost 150 feet behind her. The hump of her banana slug body rose higher than her human torso, blocking her view, but she could feel how far back it stretched. It was bright yellow and speckled with black spots. Her brain struggled to take in that much flesh, but she quickly adjusted. She looked down and gasped, realizing that she &quot;stood&quot; almost 12 feet above the ground.<br />
<br />
Her whole environment had changed around her, becoming more like a warehouse than her parents&#39; garden. Some t shirts were strewn about far below her, and she noticed a few other things she recognized–a wardrobe, her alarm clock--on a platform raised to her torso&#39;s height. She cried, not knowing how she was going to even function being this large. However, another cruel aspect of her new body soon made itself obvious.<br />
<br />
Jen wanted to get over to her wardrobe, about 30 feet away. She started to move towards it, feeling her slug body produce copious mucus underneath her. It was cold and wet and made her shudder with disgust. However, what distressed her even more was how fast she could move. Or rather, how slow.<br />
<br />
Her foot refused to move quickly. Try as she might to run, it seemed her top speed was…. just a paltry single mile per hour. She could only move 1/4th as fast as she used to be able to walk, let alone run! And this was at full exertion! She could feel her foot quickly tire with trying to keep that speed up, her unbelievable mass protesting against her desire for &quot;speed.&quot; She looked back and almost screamed seeing her pneuomostome open wide enough to drive a car into, trying to get the oxygen to her massive body. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a fucking monster,&quot; she sobbed, disgusted by what she had become.</p>
