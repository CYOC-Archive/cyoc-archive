<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After the five days, Steve was sad to see Claire stand up. She was muddy and grassy, so she asked to take a shower and clean up. He let her go get washed whilst he sat on the bed, hanging his head. Those five days went way too fast. Watching this girl behaving like a dog, completely naked, was so hot! They’d been the best five days of his life! Another human being, acting like an inferior animal always got him hard. He liked to imagine that Claire didn’t have a clue what he was doing when he felt her tits, or played with her pussy. As if she’d really had the mind of a dog. But he knew she didn’t. Still, it was hot that she had played the role so well. He had wanking material for years to come!<br />
<br />
He heard the shower being turned on. Claire was washing herself. Seeing her like a normal person again was annoying, he didn’t like it. It kinda took away from the whole fantasy. He knew that even if he could have convinced her to play the role longer, his parents would be home later that day. It was no good. Still…he could tell his mate Frank all about it!<br />
<br />
Frank shared Steve’s fantasy about women behaving like animals. They’d met on the internet and hit it off. Frank was twenty seven and lived on his own in a house a few streets away. He had a big garden, ideal for pets, but actually had none. Frank was the kind of person who would have loved having Claire for the weekend. Maybe she would do it for him too?<br />
<br />
He heard a whisper then and jumped. He looked around, thinking his parents might have come home early. He bolted to the window, but there was no car in the driveway. Hhhmmm, what could it be? Then it appeared to him.<br />
<br />
Claire emerged from the bathroom after an hour, having showered thoroughly and scrubbed at her dirty nails. Finally, she felt a lot more clean. She had gone to the toilet like a normal person and was trying to put the dreadful experience behind her. She walked out of the bathroom naked because she had dried herself inside, and wanted to put on her uniform and leave without delay. Steve was standing with some guy.<br />
<br />
“Wow, Steve! You were right! Look at the rack on that little bitch! She has melons! I’ll take her!”<br />
<br />
“You got it, Frank. As long as I have visiting rights! You know what to do, just as the spirit told us.”<br />
<br />
Claire looked at Steve in disgust. “What the fuck do you think you are doing? I want my hundred and then I am leaving! And you can take this dog collar back. While you’re at it, stop your pervert friend leering at me!” Claire fumed and walked over to get her uniform.<br />
<br />
“Claire, I will give you a pound if you will behave like a dog anytime I tell you to. Agreed?” The strange man smirked.<br />
<br />
“I…i…yes, agreed!” Claire couldn’t believe it as she took the pound out of his big hand. He must be easily over six foot, dwarfing her. She felt extremely intimidated being naked and so much smaller than she was used to. She grabbed for her uniform and then he said something to her. Immediately, she fell on all fours and they started to laugh at her. She panted and wagged her ass again. Nnnnnnnnooooo! She was back behaving as a dog! What was going on!? Try as she might, she simply couldn’t act in any way human.<br />
<br />
“Aaaawww, poor Claire! Stuck as a bitch, are we? Down on all fours? Hahaha! This is classic! You didn’t even get that collar off! The spirit told me all about you! Then I told Frank here. It seems you were a very arrogant bitch before you got turned into a schoolgirl version of yourself! As part of your punishment for being such a greedy cunt, the spirit has altered you in the obvious ways. Plus, you will do anything for money! The extreme of your old self! So when Frank here gave you a pound, you sealed a deal. He can make you behave like a dog whenever and wherever he wants! There is not a thing you can do about it!”<br />
<br />
Claire was horrified…this had gone from bad to worse! First a trampy schoolgirl, now a dog?! Impossible!<br />
<br />
“I know what you are thinking, but there is nothing you can do. All you can accomplish is to behave like a dog.  Frank loves role playing with women! He especially loves getting women to behave like dogs, then he can fuck them up their asses. Sadly, women don’t stay around too long for Frank. They get freaked from feeding his fantasies. But you aren’t going anywhere! You will be his loyal doggy! Man, you are so fucking hot! We both love big tits! You are ideal. I can’t wait to visit you and play with your pussy. I can do pretty much what I like to you and all you’ll do is pant and take it. Now be a good dog, princess! Go home with uncle Frank!”<br />
<br />
Frank grinned. &quot;You can behave like normal now, Claire.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire sprung up and sprinted out the door. She raced down the stairs and swung the front door open. It was pitch black outside and there was nobody around to see her nakedness. She raced along the pavement, heading back towards the leisure centre. If she could just reach it, maybe she could figure out a way to get around this curse.<br />
<br />
She was crossing the park when she felt something tingling. She felt as if she was being chased by something inhuman. She sped up. As she ran down towards the river, she saw something orange by a tree. She stumbled as she looked over.<br />
<br />
Two teenage boys were standing under the tree smoking. They were both about fourteen and still in their uniforms. They whistled at her and stood staring. Just at that moment, whatever was chasing her caught up and pounced. She fell to the ground on all fours in front of the boys. Then she wagged her ass and barked. They looked at each other in shock.</p>
