<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Julie let out a whimper massaged into a warm rumble by her purring. Joy&#39;s acceptance was making it harder for her to resist, too. She was burning with need. But she wanted it on her terms. With her last vestiges of self-control, she pushed the invasive thoughts to the side and clung to this moment. They were on a stage, with their tormentor/liberator. They were still changing...he could still change them. So far it had been good, but what else was coming? How could they stop it from going in a dangerous direction? Or...control the direction?<br />
<br />
Julie&#39;s lips parted in a devilish grin. &quot;If we&#39;re not going to fight it, then let&#39;s take it for ourselves.&quot; Their changes seemed to be coming on easier. Maybe they could play Lupo&#39;s game now. Still embracing her mewling sister, Julie turned her head and cooed &quot;Professor Lupo...?&quot;<br />
<br />
The showman turned, a little surprised, but kept his well-practiced smile intact. Julie felt everyone in the tent focus on her. The rush of attention sent a flare of heat up from her nethers. She forgot she&#39;d become such an exhibitionist. But that was good. Attention was key to this act.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you so much forrr this gift,&quot; she said, pouring as much of her purr into the words as her human tongue could manage. She sounded like she was speaking into a ceiling fan. She hoped it wasn&#39;t too awkward to throw off her performance.<br />
<br />
Lupo was too pleased with himself to care. He took off his hat and bowed dramatically. &quot;You are MOST welcome, ladies. It is my pleasure to share these exotic thrills with you and our wonderful audience.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie continued, lifting her elbow to rub her cheek on it. She wasn&#39;t sure if she was doing that for effect or if she just really wanted her cheek rubbed. &quot;My sister and I have never felt more confident and in control of ourselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
The corners of Lupo&#39;s mouth tipped downward just a bit. &quot;Well, of course! Tigers are notorious for their commanding presence. But, ladies, we mustn&#39;t let such wild beasts roam wherever they please.&quot; His tone started to warble. He suspected what she was doing, and even if he didn&#39;t, he figured it was best to get to this part quickly in any case. &quot;We all know that to introduce tigers in a stage show such as this requires a degree of safety. Control. Have you ever seen a tiger perform on stage without the only person they obey unquestioningly?&quot; He flung his arms wide and then brought his hands into his chest. &quot;Their train--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No one.&quot; Julie said flatly, as loud and firmly as she could. Fuck, he loved to go on and on. She almost missed her cue. Her bored tigress brain was already drifting back to getting bent over a chair by some lucky stud. &quot;No one commands us but us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joy&#39;s arms closed in around Julie a little tighter. Her grinding almost stopped completely.<br />
<br />
Lupo&#39;s bravado evaporated from his face. He scowled fiercely at Julie. &quot;That isn&#39;t true, my tigress, and you know it.&quot; Without his jovial demeanor, his enthusiastic suggestions sounded a lot more like threats.<br />
<br />
Something tugged at Julie&#39;s mind. No, her neck. Her hand probed the bare fur there, almost expecting to find something. Almost WANTING to find something. She felt an urge to step toward Lupo. The way Joy suddenly pressed against her, Julie knew she felt it too. But neither of them moved.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re wild spirits,&quot; Julie declared. &quot;You&#39;ve basically been saying that all along. We&#39;ll never be collared by the likes of you. Isn&#39;t that right, everyone?&quot; She shot a defiant stare into the audience and prayed...believed...this would work. &quot;You&#39;ve seen what we&#39;ve become! What do you think we are? Pets? Or untameable beasts?<br />
<br />
There was an excruciating pause.<br />
<br />
Then the crowd whooped and cheered. The tugging sensation vanished. Julie chuckled out a gasp of relief. Along with the desire to submit to Lupo, the visions of shot glasses and worthy mates drifted away. The fog cleared. She was back in control of her thoughts. There&#39;d be plenty of time for revelry later.<br />
<br />
&quot;Julie, my dear--&quot; Lupo said, coming closer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Careful now...&quot; Julie held up a hand and curled her fingers toward him. &quot;Tigers don&#39;t respond well to threats. Didn&#39;t you say something before about getting clawed at? You don&#39;t want to mess with these sharp nails.&quot;<br />
<br />
The crowd &quot;ooh&quot;ed, more captivated than ever at the unexpected standoff. But Julie knew it wasn&#39;t just that. They all watched as her perfectly manicured fingernails grew out and narrowed into deadly points. Lupo&#39;s face twitched with fury.<br />
<br />
&quot;And fangs,&quot; Joy added. She bared one of her claws, too. Julie smirked as both girls&#39; jaws ached in response to their canines sharpening. The teeth nearly doubled in length.<br />
<br />
&quot;F-folks,&quot; Lupo turned to the audience. &quot;I assure you these ladies are harmless kittens.&quot; The way he put so much weight on the last two words revealed how desperate he was to get them under control. Both sisters glanced at each other with confident, fang-filled smiles. They felt no different this time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Harmless, he says!&quot; Julie shouted, taking back the limelight. &quot;Only a fool would think that. Maybe you&#39;d get a hint of how deadly we are if you heard us &#39;kittens&#39; let out a blood-curdling roar?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lupo took another step forward and stuck his hand inside his coat. Joy leaped in front of Julie, bared her fangs, and blasted a scream directly at him. Julie wanted to slap her hands over her ears at how ear-piercingly high it was. Like a victim in a slasher movie. But as she looked around, she could see everyone else was hearing something much different. Their faces were awash in terror. Even Lupo&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Julie tried to imagine a tiger&#39;s vicious snarl coming from Joy. She convinced herself that the girly screech was just background noise. The real noise she was hearing was a tigress warding off her opponent. She had to believe she heard a tiger.<br />
<br />
And then she did. Joy was roaring like a wild, angry animal. It was chilling. It was beautiful.<br />
<br />
All the blood drained from Lupo&#39;s face. Joy kept going until she spent all the air in her lungs. The room went dead silent. Even the twins&#39; sensitive ears couldn&#39;t hear a single sound in the entire tent. Lupo started to back away ever so slowly and slid his hand from his coat, palm out to show it held nothing. Then, just as slowly, he turned to the crowd.<br />
<br />
Lupo smiled a very tiny smile. &quot;Well, folks...&quot; His hand lifted toward the girls, shaking. &quot;There you have it! Julie and Joy, the Terrifying Tigress Twins!&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a deafening cheer and a heavy rumble as some audience members stamped their feet instead of clapping.<br />
<br />
Julie strode up to her sister and, beaming with pride, put her hand on Joy&#39;s bare shoulder. Joy tousled Julie&#39;s wild hair. The giggle she let out had a lovely feline murr beneath it. They clasped hands, turned, and took a bow.</p>
