<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff grabbed the remaining groceries from his mom&#39;s sedan and slammed the trunk down, still thinking about the Chronivac. It didn&#39;t seem like it had changed his mom at all yet, but from what he&#39;d learned in school evolution did take a long time to take effect, and he didn&#39;t even know how long the Chronivac might take to evolve her- it might take hours or even days for her to evolve thousands of years. Heading back inside, Jeff decided he would check on the Chronivac and make sure he got all the settings right.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where do you want these, Mom?&quot; Jeff asked, walking into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, just on the counter, I need to make dinner with them pretty quick. Thanks, Jeffy!&quot; Irene replied, bent over in the fridge putting the perishable goods away. Jeff did as he was asked and placed the plastic bags on the counter top and was about to head back to his room when his mom stood back up- and when he saw her, he froze.<br />
<br />
In the kitchen, he could see her mother but she looked younger.  Her body firmed up and her breasts were already firm.  Her muscles were fully toned and any fat on her was gone around her stomach and her waste was flat and curvy with her rear bubbly and round.  Her face was radiant with her wrinkles and bags under her eyes disappeared completely.  Her hair was more youthful as it was very shiny and had no gray streaks on her brown streaks.  Looking at her, Jeff could tell that her mother looked more like a 25-year-old young woman graduated from college and less of a 40 something mother of two.<br />
<br />
Jeff was completely surprised to see that the evolution package suddenly made his mother younger.  It doesn’t make much sense for he never used the age package and that would’ve been used to make her younger.  He scratched his head and wondered if there’s a glitch in the system.<br />
<br />
As he was wondering about it, his mother turned to him and her eyes were gleaming with youth.  &quot;Everything okay, Jeff?&quot; She asked, closing the refrigerator door and approaching her.  Jeff was amazed that she walked very sultry with her hips swaying back and forth and her breasts were bouncing a little bit.  She looked really good, even if she was wearing clothes meant for an older woman.  “Jeff, is something wrong?” she kept on asking, &quot;You look like you&#39;ve seen a ghost!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah- n-no, I&#39;m fine! You just, uh, look... really pretty today?&quot; Jeff stuttered, trying to act casual. His mom wasn&#39;t freaking out about her evolution, so maybe she didn&#39;t notice it yet. If that was the case, Jeff didn&#39;t want to change that- who knew how she would react to her new looks?<br />
<br />
“Really?” she said with enthusiasm, “Well I did got this knew cream from the mall the other day.  They said it would make you look years younger.  Guess it actually work.”  Boy how right she was since the evolution package made her that way.  “Why don’t you go to your room and do your school work sweetie.  After a long grueling day at work, I feel like taking a nice relaxing shower.  I’ll cook up some dinner after I’m done freshening up.  Dinner will be ready in about an hour, don’t forget to tell your sister.”  &quot;I will.&quot; Jeff said, gulping, before making a mad dash out of the kitchen doorway.  Irene looked to her son with curiosity and said, “Hmm…  He certainly is in a hurry.  Teenagers…  Oh well…  Better start relaxing before I start cooking.”  To that, she left the kitchen as well and headed up the steps to get her comforting bath.  Back to Jeff, he rushed upstairs to reach his room.  When he did, he closed it and exhaled a deep breath in surprise. His mom had become a totally hot woman in just under two minutes, and for all he knew her changes had only just begun. Still didn’t explain why she was getting younger instead of evolving her.  Maybe her changes so far were just the result of a few hundred years of evolution- who knew how much she might change in 5,000?  The thought terrified Jeff- but also filled him with curiosity.  For some reason, his mother&#39;s changes were fascinating to him.  She had already a young and beautiful woman and he’s pretty sure everybody would think that she’s more of an older sister or cousin then that of a mother.  She may have already changed even more radically in the scant few seconds he had been in his room catching his breath, and he felt the compulsion to watch her change, to watch her evolve further into the next stage of humanity or get younger still, to see what she could become. Looking to his computer, he could see the Chronivac still on and checked to see the progress of the changes,  So far, he could see that the years have been ticking to almost 500 and could tell what happened so far.  The first thought would be to stop the progress and let his mom be the young and energetic single mom that he wanted.  But a part of him said to let it keep going to see where the changes go to next.  It would be interesting to see what the end result of his mother would be like.  Just the mere thought made Jeff feel like a mad scientist.  So thinking it through, he decided to let the changes progress and waited for the process to stop.  Placing his hand on the desk, he watched the screen intently as the number of years counted up to over five hundred.</p>
