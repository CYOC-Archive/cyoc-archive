<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You cross your eyes trying to focus on the tiny creature buzzing inches from the end of your nose. You debate trying to catch it in your cupped hands or just out and out swatting it. Before you can make up your mind it flies straight at the tip of your nose.  You raise your hands, but as it stings your nose you find your body immobilized.  You are frozen in the odd position with your hands half raised and your knees bent to jump.<br />
<br />
&quot;You giant oaf! Eating sprites homes! Have you no manners!&quot; squeaked the high pitch voice, as the buzzing object grew larger the voice became deeper and the words more intelligible.  The creature hovered surveying the damage of the half eaten broken mushroom lying at your feet. <br />
<br />
It turned angrily, you weren't sure if it was male or female. That question seemed to vex you more than your predicament.  Though the creature was growing larger and larger.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're lucky I was already planning to move, or I'd change you into a mushroom, hollow you out and move in,&quot; it said with a glare from its glowing green eyes.<br />
<br />
The creature was slight, but the facial features angular. You decided that it was a masculine looking Tinker Bell - a butch female. She was sort of attractive, and you wondered what she'd be like in the sack.<br />
<br />
The creature raised an eyebrow, and its clawed hand grabbed your crotch. &quot;Is that all you humans think about!&quot; she screeched grabbing your crotch painfully.<br />
<br />
Tears managed to well up in your eyes, even though you couldn't move let alone blink.<br />
<br />
The creature stared long and hard never once relaxing its grip, and then it cracked a smile. The smile made every muscle in your body try to shiver.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, I know your punishment.&quot;<br />
<br />
You suddenly felt weightless.  Your clothing dropped right through you landing in a heap on the ground in front of the fairy ring.  The creature cackled as it turned still gripping your cock and balls, it floated down the path with you in tow like a big balloon.  You felt the wind race passed. Hard as you try, you cannot see any part of yourself now, not even your nose.  It's like you're invisible.<br />
<br />
She flies faster.  You recognize the street.  You hear a bell ring. She's headed to your high school.  School doesn't start for an hour and half, but the jocks are already showing up for practice before school.  You're a senior and have study hall first hour, so you weren't planning to be here for another two and half hours.  The creature flies right through the doors to the 100 building as if they or she were made of air.  As you pass through the door too, you decide that the latter is true.  The doors felt oddly solid as you passed through them.  The hallways are empty, and the classrooms dark. One door it open, and the light is on.  Ms. Johnson is in early reviewing test papers.  Somehow, you doubt you'll be making it to her class today.  The creature still reading your thoughts hovers and turns.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not today, not ever,&quot; it whispers.<br />
<br />
Then it turns and resumes its course.  Through another set of double doors then another.  This time you race through the 200 building. Then out the other doors and across the quadrangle toward the gymnasium. You hear noises.  People are shouting and talking, lockers are slamming, clothing is russling.  You fly through the door marked &quot;Girls Lockerroom.&quot;  You fixed eyes steal glances of girls in various states of undress.<br />
<br />
The creature shoves its face in yours, and tightens its grip. <br />
<br />
&quot;You should be so lucky!&quot; <br />
<br />
It flies straight at the tiled wall with you in tow.  You attempt unsuccessfully to close your eyes as you prepare for a painful thud.  However, like the doors, you pass through them as if you were nothing. They feel solid, then empty and solid again as you pass through. Momentarily you are in darkness, and then the glaring fluorescent light returns.  You recognize you're in the &quot;Boy's Locker Room&quot;.  She flies through the Varsity football team as they change.  It's odd feeling bits of arms and legs pass through you as you are towed around the corner to a vacant row of lockers.  The creature sets you down on your feet on top of the wooden bench running between the lockers. It releases its grip on you, but you remain immobilized.  The creature hovers in front of you gleefully rubbing its hands together.  It laughs wickedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now your punishment will be that you are to become a bound spirit.  I can bind you to anything organic.  I could have instilled you into a frog in the Bio Lab, but as soon as they dissected you, you'd be freed.  Dead, but freed, and that isn't enough punishment for your crime against me,&quot; it said with a toothy grin.  <br />
<br />
It paused as you contemplated a fate worse than death.<br />
<br />
Imagine being immobile, a piece of wood, a plank.  Imagine every hour, naked boys and men would sitting or standing on you.  Muddy shoes, sweaty balls, stinky asses, smelly feet, and all you can do is lay still and take it. Mwahahaha! I'm going to infuse your essence into this bench. Mwhahahahahaha!&quot; It laughed raising its hands gleefully.  <br />
<br />
You feel queasy and rubbery.  You know she's about to bind you into the stiff wooden grain of the bench.  <br />
<br />
Just then loud shouting from the Varsity players on the other side of the locker row distracts the fairy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, give that back!&quot; shouts Joe Mannheim angrily.<br />
<br />
An object flies over the row of lockers. It's coming right for your head. It's small, and white. As the pouch parachutes outward, you realize it was a wadded up jockstrap.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; the creature asks hovering and staring at the lockers and toward the voices, and then following the descent of the object as it hits you in the face. &quot;No!&quot;<br />
<br />
The pouch hits you in the face.  It's not clean, but it's not really stinky either. The warm masculine scent seems to grow stronger, as you find yourself falling with the jockstrap.  It seems to be growing and enveloping your entire body.  You are completely covered by the jockstrap, and are rolled up in its pouch when it lands on the bench.<br />
<br />
The creature laughs, &quot;Serendipitous! What a happy accident!&quot;<br />
<br />
You struggle to your feet pushing out of the jockstrap, sort of.  You blink in the harsh fluorescent light and stare up at the giant fairy creature hovering over you.  Now you think the creature looks more masculine.  You look down at your body.  You are naked, and trasparent. It's like your body is made of glass or acrylic except it moves like normal, no not really normal. You stare your hands vanish into the fabric of the jockstrap.  Your legs similarly merge at your ankes with the mesh material at your feet. You've been fused to the jockstrap. You glare up at the sinister smiling countenance of the fairy, and decide that you were mistaken earlier - it's male.<br />
<br />
Joe races around the corner of the row of lockers, and charges right through the fairy, as if he cannot see it.  His hand closes on his jockstrap.  He seems oblivious to your presence.  You must be invisible to him.  He raises one foot and slips it through the leg hole of his jockstrap.<br />
<br />
You scream, &quot;No, Joe! Don't put the jockstrap on! I'm-&quot;<br />
<br />
You're cut off as in one swift movement his other foot goes through the leg opening, and he pulls the jockstrap all the way up burying you against his manhood.<br />
<br />
The fairy laughs sweetly, &quot;He who laughs last, laughs best. Welcome to the rest of your life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joe walks back toward his locker.  He keeps adjusting his pouch, and pauses before rounding the corner to look inside the pouch at his junk.  It feels different somehow, almost like there's something else in the pouch with his junk, but he can plainly see that nothing of the sort is true.  He groans, he must be coming down with a case of jock itch again. He snaps his strap back in place and proceeds to his locker. He sprays his crotch, his thighs, his jockstrap, and inside the pouch his manhood and you with anti-fungal spray. Then he finishes dressing and runs out to practice. <br />
<br />
The bell is ringing as he runs for the field.<br />
<br />
The coach shouts, &quot;Joe, you're late. After practice, you're running extra laps!&quot;</p>
