<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Tammy sat there on the sink wonder what to do, she felt something shift in herself. &quot;W-what? I&#39;m still changing?&quot; She quickly twisted around, to look at the mirror again, awkwardly flailing her legs and arms in the maneuver, trying not to fall off. Before Tammy even got a good look in the mirror she had an idea of what was happening. Her body was thinning, her small gut receding and tightening as the small bits of flab vanished from her body. <br />
<br />
She could only look on in stunned silence as her appearance changed once again, her noise dwindled as her hair gained a much healthier look going from a stringy greased mess to a much fuller brown with a healthy shine. As her mouth adopted a more human proportion she opened it briefly in curiosity; even her teeth looked better. Instead of jagged yellow points, they had taken on an only slightly pointed appearance when compared to her old teeth; her canines being more pronounced was the biggest difference. Her nose had stopped shrinking at that point, it seemed only slightly larger then normal on her now petite face.<br />
<br />
Her gaze drifted down at the rest of her body, confirming that her excess weight had indeed left her, but she could only sigh in despair; she still had no muscle to speak of. If anything she was probably even weaker then she had just been. Her stomach was flat but was completely devoid of any definition and her arms had a delicate thinness to them as did her legs. And to her continued dismay what remained of her body fat had stayed in all the wrong places; leaving her with moderate curves. She looked like the damsel Roscoe was supposed to save and woo.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?! Why is this happening to me? This isn&#39;t what I wanted at all!&quot; Tammy cried in protest. While it was admittedly an improvement from before it was getting close enough to what she&#39;d wanted in the first place that it turned her despair into frustration. She glared at her new cute body, her prominent, pointed ears framing her pretty face, her noise only just large enough to give the impression of being a goblin as apposed to a green elf or something. Her petite hands gripped the sides of the sink she was sitting in, as her tiny body shook with contained tears.<br />
<br />
She couldn&#39;t look at herself anymore, the constant reminder of what happened eating at her, as she glared at her new breasts and crotch. At her tiny thin arms... her helpless body... That train of thought brought anger to the forefront and she slammed her little fist against the mirror, only to yelp in pain as the mirror refused to give. It was less a mirror and more highly polished metal to keep exactly what she was trying to do from happening, it being a highschool restroom.<br />
<br />
With held back tears filling her face she climbed down from the sink glaring at it wondering if the last change had made her even shorter or not, but still too unfamiliar with her new size to tell such a minor shift if it had.<br />
<br />
Tammy shivered as the adrenaline left her leaving her chilled. She needed to deal with her lack of clothing so she meandered over to her locker. It was awkward opening it as she had to stand on the bench and lean over to the second row to both reach the lock and still see what she was doing but the new goblin girl managed to get it open, and grabbed the only thing that had any real chance of staying on her diminutive body, her red hoodie. <br />
<br />
It was absolutely massive on her, but the narrow neck hole and hood were enough to keep her from just falling through it. She was quickly reminded of her hair and ears by her hoodie, her ears being pushed around buy it giving her goose bumps from the alien feeling and her long hair having to be pulled out to keep her back and neck from itching. Her new &#39;dress&#39; pooled around her feet and she quickly found rolling up her sleeves was just not worth the effort as they quickly started coming back down. Stomping her feet in frustration she quickly grabbed her wallet, phone, and keys, everything else in her locker was worthless to her now, and almost immediately fell on her face as she tried to leave the locker room. Tears filling her eyes again, she shuffled around a bit trying to figure out how to move about like this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I can hold it up or something?&quot; she said to herself as she slipped her wallet, phone, and keys into the front pocket, and proceeded to hike up the bottom of her hoodie like she was doing the worlds most awkward curtsy or something. After some hesitant walking around Tammy finally made her way to the locker room door and, after pushing it with her entire body behind it, went outside and started making her way to the parking lot.<br />
<br />
Tammy quickly found herself missing shoes, as she carefully tiptoed her car. Her feet seemed exceptionally delicate and sensitive causing her to gingerly make her way across the grounds. As her trek slowly continued she soon found her arms getting tired. At this point the goblin was getting fed up with how much her new body sucked and just gritted her teeth and forced herself to continue holding up her heavy, awkward pseudo dress. Eventually, with burning arms and stinging feet, she finally limped to her car and realized yet another problem. There was absolutely now way she could drive anymore.<br />
<br />
This was the last straw. Tammy crumpled to the ground in a ball, and started to wail, tears gushed from her face. She gave no thought to being out in the open, or who may hear and find her. She let it all out.</p>
