<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hello this is Matt. Today I met the Leader of the Ciont'i tribe. It was an old man, sadly dressed the same as <br />
Cobar but with more body paint and a braid of feathers. My father wasn't allowed at this point since he was <br />
neither a tribe member, nor a prospect I suppose. The leader began speaking about the virtues of the Ciont'i, <br />
but it was to long to retell and I have already transcript it for my fathers journal. The point I was getting <br />
at was that the leader finally accepted me to join the tribe, however I would have to take my place as any <br />
other member<br />
<br />
First off Cobar said he told me, my clothes were to bright and constraining and no other member of the tribe <br />
wore them. If I wanted to stay I had to take them off. This made me very self-conscious since although I <br />
believe that I don't have a bad body, I'm a little underdeveloped. However the leader doesn't give a choice <br />
and a pair of native woman, who wore only a loincloth by the way began to strip me down to nothing. I stood <br />
there even more naked that the natives around me. My dirty blond hair and pale milky complexion contrasting <br />
their natural cooper skin made my nudity even more noticeable. <br />
<br />
At least the leader was satisfied, and ordered Cobar to take me where I was going to be staying. Before going <br />
out I asked him if I could have one of those horn-like garments, but my heart sank when Cobar told me that I <br />
couldn't. <br />
<br />
You see I had become a Ciont'i, but that didn't meant I would have any special treatment. Perhaps it would be <br />
best to explain some things about the Ciont'i. First off I have already commented on Cobar and the leader <br />
attires, that's what the Ciont'i regular wear. Then there was the women, that as I have already pointed out go <br />
around topless. This is as my father explained because there are some women called the Chiches that has <br />
breasts the size of watermelons, this is because they breastfed the children of the tribe with them. But there <br />
are some women that had normal boobs(at any point I was seeing to many boobs for my exposed dick to behave), <br />
Cobar explained that the Chiches eat a special fruit that made their tits to enlarge like that. And lastly the <br />
children, who were everyone under the age of 10, simply went about naked, more over children couldn't leave <br />
the village surroundings, since they were deemed to small.<br />
<br />
Cobar explained that, at least for boys, the garment was a symbol of maturity, after the age of 10 or so they <br />
had a ceremony where the leader (who was also a shaman) sent them on a quest, if they succeeded they'll become <br />
men and allowed to wear the garment, but if he failed he had to wait a whole year to take the test again. <br />
Cobar confessed he had to take the test again before pass it, and some even had to retake it four more times. <br />
In fact I saw another boy our age still naked, as me (I'll later learn his name to be Jayal) but evidently <br />
more developed. Although the  most shocking of all he was sucking on the tit of a Chiche woman. <br />
<br />
Cobar explained that the Ciont'i women with small breast were gatherers and brought nuts and fruit for <br />
themselves and the Chiche, while the men hunted. However no one, with the exception of the Chiche women and <br />
the shaman leader were allowed to eat if they didn't brought anything, AND since children couldn't leave they <br />
couldn't eat neither the fruit, or the seeds or the meat brought by the others, that's why the Chiches existed <br />
to provide nourishment for them.<br />
<br />
Before we arrived to were I would be staying, I wanted to pee, Cobar join me by the bushes. And then I notice <br />
something, his garment didn't have any stings holding it in place, but before I wondered how it stayed in <br />
place, Cobar took it off like sheet out of a sword, and join me in the golden stream, yes he had a boner, he <br />
was standing still, worse, he had been erected this whole time! No scratch that every man in this village most <br />
be perennially horny to keep those in place. (And to add to my discomfort, he almost doubled my size).<br />
<br />
He took me to a hut were other 3 naked boys were and a Chiche was watching over them. He told me that this was  <br />
were they kept children, he had to go now since it was getting late and he had to hunt something. Since I <br />
didn't spoke a word of their language he taught me three words, chichi: meant I was hungry/thirsty, tlaco: I <br />
was sleepy, tunka: I had to pee/poo. For anything else just to try nod or shook. He would come later to take <br />
me with my father.</p>
