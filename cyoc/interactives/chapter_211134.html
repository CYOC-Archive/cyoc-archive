<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Cheers.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well, my human friend-- at least for now, I have what is called a Copy Sphere!&quot; The green lizard man held up the blue sphere so they may both observe its uniform, blue and sphere-like nature.<br />
<br />
&quot;It… looks like a rubber ball.&quot; Adam said flatly as Drake continued to pose with it, standing with one claw behind his back like a scientist observing a marvel of creation. Adam could tell he was pretty excited because the tip of his tail kept twitching. That was a considered a lot of movement when it came to lizard-morphs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, but it&#39;s a magic sphere!&quot; Drake announced triumphantly, and began to squeeze the ball. He stopped suddenly, and considered for a moment before looking at Adam. &quot;I am going to transform you now. I won&#39;t say what it is, but I promise you&#39;ll like it. Will you let me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam sighed and stood up from the couch, and began to take off his shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Standing up is a good idea,&quot; Drake said, still in mid-pose, &quot;you should be able to keep your clothes on, besides you&#39;re just wearing a t-shirt and sweats.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, my favorite pair.&quot; Adam said in mock annoyance and let his tee fall back down. He nodded at the poised lizard, who continued squeezing the orb in a way that looked like he was fondling it. &quot;That&#39;s a bit crass--&quot; Adam began, but shut up as a wide fan of lasers shot out from the blue orb and started tracing down Drake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stand still when it gets to you,&quot; Drake said when the lasers passed his head. Adam didn&#39;t really get a chance to respond as the orb&#39;s beams quickly pivoted to him. He stood still like instructed as a full grid projected onto him from the lasers. He was face on to the orb, so it quickly scanned him like it had his lizard roommate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Apparel detected, activating pass through mode. Please do your best to hold still while changes are applied to avoid damaging clothing materials. Your prior body-molding has been physically saved onto this devices hard-drive crystal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam was about to ask what that even meant when he felt the oddest sensation overtake his entire body. It made no sense to him, but it felt like his very atoms were being re-arranged into something else. At the same time, it felt very calming, like whatever was doing it knew how to do this safely. He stood still as this sensation continued, and noticed that his jaw, nose, and mouth were tingling. He let his eyes wander as he watched his lower face push forward into a green snout, tipped with a very petite black horns just at the end of it. It was Drake&#39;s! This was Drake&#39;s snout. Rather, it was his now. Adam considered that as he felt a similar thing happen with his hands. He let curiosity get the better of him as he tapped his fingers together, and got the expected clink of tipped claws tapping each other. All at once, the literal feeling of discombobulation stopped and Adam felt suddenly tired. He let his legs give out and fell back on the couch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not a good idea--&quot; Drake began, finally dropping his pose, but it was too late. Adam yelped as he rolled onto his side on the couch and reached for his tailbone, or rather his tail. &quot;Yeah, you gotta be careful with that,&quot; Drake continued, clicking his serpentine tongue in pity as he watched Adam rub the base of his new lizard tail. <br />
<br />
&quot;Tails suck...&quot; Adam whined, still nursing his rear, &quot;any way Drake, why did you turn my body into a carbon copy of yours? It&#39;s pretty cool how it happened, but I assume I can change back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tails don&#39;t suck-- you can lean way far forward and not fall over, and yes: if you ever somehow grow bored with my amazing visage, just place your palm on this thing and the reverse process will start.&quot; With that, Drake walked over, set the blue orb on the coffee table, and noticeably adjusted his tail before he sat down next to his new clone of a roommate.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Adam said with a click of his new sharp fangs, &quot;again, why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because, my former human,&quot; Drake said with a wide, toothy grin, finally taking his other claw out from behind his back, &quot;I want to bang.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam blinked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Adam said after a moment, narrowing his newly serpentine eyes, &quot;like we&#39;ve discussed before over a bowl, I&#39;m not gay, and even if I was, I&#39;m not into anal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Drake&#39;s grin somehow became even toothier as he shook what he had been hiding behind his back along his other claw at Adam. &quot;Ah, but I have a proposition.&quot; <br />
<br />
Drake handed what he had to Adam, who grabbed it gingerly with his own claws. It was a medicinal vial pull of pink fluid, kind of similar to cough medicine, except the substance actively glowed like it was lava. Adam cocked his head at the other lizard-morph.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a sex changing potion,&quot; Drake cooed, &quot;specifically designed to turn anyone who drinks it female for at least 100 hours per dosage.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to be a girl.&quot; Adam said flatly. Drake hissed in amusement, causing Adam to scrunch his snout in a very human-like gesture.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve already gone through the change I had planned for you, Ad.&quot; Drake said reassuringly to his roommate, &quot;this potion would be for me to take.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam blinked again. Drake huffed and made an internal note how easy it was to tell Adam used to be human-- his mannerisms simply don&#39;t match his new biology.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that changes things for me, I guess.&quot; Adam said simply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, I absolutely knew it would. I bet you want to know why?&quot; Drake said with a continued toothy smile. Adam nodded, his snout bobbing up and down. &quot;Well to put it simply, I want to go fuck myself, literally!&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam laughed out loud at Drake&#39;s admission.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re kidding,&quot; Adam said, &quot;surely there&#39;s something else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh there is,&quot; Drake said as a matter-of-factly, &quot;according to the company I got that bottle from, my body will be biologically compatible, and we&#39;ll be testing that. If I get a clutch going, my body won&#39;t be able to change back until I lay. Then I just need to have another dose and wait another 100 hours for it to wear off and I&#39;ll change back that time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know?&quot; Adam asked dubiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;The rep for it told me.&quot; Drake replied confidently.<br />
<br />
&quot;You believed him?&quot; Adam asked with beginning incredulity, looking at the substance in his grasp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not? I feel like they&#39;d be out of business or in jail otherwise. Besides, I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve realized this yet, but it&#39;s not about me. It&#39;s about you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Drake flicked his eyes at Adam&#39;s blank stare, &quot;Will you breed with me, with the intention of knocking me up? I don&#39;t plan on keeping the eggs to hatch, so don&#39;t expect to pay alimony. Still though, it seems like a dick move to make you a dad without asking first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, oh! Yeah, I understand. Thanks for mentioning it.&quot; Adam said, letting Drake&#39;s request sink in in its entirety. He looked at his roommate, and then at the glowing bottle in his hands, which were really Drake&#39;s.</p>
<hr/><h3>
Should Adam agree to this weird, yet unique offer by Drake?</h3>
