<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Holy fuck, why am I looking at myself looking like you!&quot; Ken blinked. The kid&#39;s image blinked. His arms were stick thin, and he barely looked old enough to be in high school. <br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno...UM...BECAUSE WE SWITCHED BODIES?&quot; <br />
<br />
Tim was standing there, admiring himself in the mirror. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yup yup yup, the damn kid who ruined my life by taking off with my very handsome adult frame made a deal with me. Said if I could get a cute young man about to go to college, he&#39;d be willing to trade with me. He made it real obvious that he wanted a Disney sitcom lookin&#39; motherfucker like you. He wants to be ridiculously handsome. Voila! I can&#39;t wait to get back in my body and be 37. I&#39;m tired of people calling me kiddo all the time! Oh man, I need a cigarette!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t smoke. I mean, you don&#39;t smoke. How old am I? What am I, like...11?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax. You&#39;re 13 years old. You turn 14 in a few months. You&#39;re just about to go through puberty, son! Now, when you start getting hair down there, let me know. Haha. Look, you can move in this kid&#39;s parents or me and my family. You don&#39;t have to worry about going to college, you can just chill and coast through high school again, bud! You&#39;ll clean up!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I just finished high school! I don&#39;t want to go through four more years!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Did you do that well in high school?&quot; Tim said from Ken&#39;s old body. He was handsome, wasn&#39;t he? He never really appreciated his looks much, but he did have a handsome face. Curly ginger hair and a rounded, but strong chin. Highly expressive eyes and mouth. A perfect poster boy. A great face for acting. And now it belonged to this other guy and he was stuck as a kid??<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe this is even happening. Cole! What about Cole?? Is he gonna end up in that old guy&#39;s body? We have to stop them!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not going anywhere, Mister.&quot; There was a woman who popped up from behind Tim, holding a clipboard. She was middle aged, her hair was cut down at the neck with a tiny pink bow in it, and she was wearing a professional pink dress pants and suit, perfect for a schoolteacher.  &quot;I&#39;m Charlene, I&#39;m going to be your agent for the duration of your stay. You have a very hot property right now.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...I swapped bodies and now I&#39;m supposed to go back to high school? Can we get back to that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, someone was supposed to meet you earlier to talk to you and Cole to prepare you when you arrived. Terribly sorry about that. We managed to stop him from getting his swap and we&#39;re talking to him in another room and he&#39;s gonna be there for a little while, so...why don&#39;t you come to my office and I&#39;ll explain the rules.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you give me my body back?&quot; Ken pressed. True, he looked adorable for 14, but he didn&#39;t want to look adorable! <br />
<br />
&quot;Technically, it&#39;s not your body anymore and I know Tim. He is going to raise hell if we make him swap back...he can sue us in the magical courts but that takes time.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, magical court? What?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I&#39;m gonna do just a quick update spell on you. Hold on,&quot; Charlene looked through her notes. She waved her fingers around at you and you suddenly are filled with information. Magic is real. Body swaps are real. It&#39;s all hidden from society and magical people had their own court system. Huh. <br />
<br />
&quot;Great. So I&#39;m screwed? I&#39;m screwed out of my body!&quot; Ken yelled as she opened up her office door and welcomed him inside. They strode past the lobby area and back to a spacious, well decorated room with a 19th century Caribbean feel to it, with antique furniture and stacks of books bordered by large windows overlooking palm-tree filled gardens leading down in terraces down to the seashore below.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. So I am going to level with you,&quot; Charlene told him, taking a seat, and he did as well. He was annoyed that his feet no longer came down to the ground. It angered him and made him feel the reality of his new status all the more. He burned with humiliation. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You really hit the jackpot here. Do you have any idea how many millionaires would kill to be in that body, or swap their partner into that body? The ones that want to use that body are usually going to be coming and going. I could really use it as a loaner. In other words, a body that has to stay here and so, in effect, you could stay at the resort while older men use this body, and you could have theirs. And I would pay you to do this for me. And for keeping magic secret, of course.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So...people don&#39;t know about magical abilities because...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well people are stupid. Can you imagine how many ways they&#39;d misuse magic? We have it under control here, or relatively under control. We always work something out. So look, consider my offer. You have an amazingly hot trade to make and you could take your pick from guests making offers. You have this Asian Joseph Gordon Levitt look to you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, great. So when do I get to be me again?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well...I know that situation well. So the kid that traded up in age really loves being in control of other people. So he&#39;s been allowed to get CEO training from the best...his parents worked out a deal. He&#39;s going to trade back and he&#39;s already agreed to trade back, but he wanted to skip at least to adulthood to avoid going through puberty himself. And he&#39;s rich, so...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Great. Rich kids can do whatever they want now, including just skipping to adulthood?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You got it! So. Your body will have the former kid and we checked your background, Ken. You are a ward of the state, correct?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. That is the only reason I&#39;m considering this.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, you were barely gonna make it in college. With your GPA? You only got in because of your foster care status. They couldn&#39;t pair you and you got aged out, and I&#39;ve read the files, so I know everything about your shitty foster parent situations. So look. You can become whatever hot guys come here. All year round, just trading bodies over and over again.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What about Cole?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s not getting the same offer. He&#39;s too fat.&quot; She shrugged. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So...whattdya say? Become a Misfit Island body trader and enjoy yourself as an older gentleman.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds...like a possibility.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds like you&#39;re gonna get a great big ol&#39; bank account set up...it&#39;ll be in the Cayman Islands. I hate paying taxes.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Who doesn&#39;t?&quot; Ken shrugged. <br />
<br />
Ken was set up with his own pad, a really lovely room. Airy, with large open windows. The breeze cooled him and he stared at the alien image of himself in a nearby mirror. Within the room he found ample clothing for him to wear so long as he needed it, a note told him. He chose a simple white shirt with blue stripes and some blue and white board shorts. God, he looked cute. He smiled. He had actual dimples! <br />
<br />
A knock at the door. A very tall stranger greeted him. The man was muscular, with tanned skin, and stood at 6&#39;2&quot;. He was very imposing, had Italian looks, with slicked black hair and a masculine, round face, with a few days worth of deep graphite colored stubble, and had deep dark eyes that wore an innocent lost look, and MUSCLES jutting out in every direction. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ken? Is that YOU?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeeees? Who the hell are YOU?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s me. It&#39;s Cole! Look at the size of me, man!&quot; Cole stomped into the room, not used to his own weight. He looked like he was a competitive rugby player, and in fact that is exactly who he had swapped bodies with. &quot;Holy shit, dude. They wanted to apologize because there was some kind of mixup. I thought they were making it all up when they offered me this body for just the rest of the trip. Dude, I look fucking STACKED! Everyone is gonna want this fuckin&#39; body! Every fuckin&#39; guy here is gonna want me! Fucking hell!&quot; Cole couldn&#39;t help himself, and he shirked off his chest and stared at it in wonder. His pec muscles were now bigger than Ken&#39;s head! <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God, you have no idea how good this feels...it&#39;s so good....oh YEAH.&quot; Cole felt himself everywhere, almost orgasming over his new frame. &quot;Dude, this is the weirdest but best thing that ever happened to me. This could be you some day. Or not, it&#39;s a...a...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I think the term is loaner body. Yeah, I imagine this guy is really popular. I&#39;m guessing there are a lot of other gay guys doing the same thing. Hey. Are you still gay?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, I&#39;m definitely gay. I wanna fuck every guy in sight. I&#39;m GOING to fuck every guy in sight. Like, no offense, I know you&#39;re like a little boy again and that sucks to be you, but dude, LOOK AT ME!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I am. You look fucking hot.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m gonna find real hot guys and powerfuck them. This body was BORN to fuck! YEAH!&quot; Cole posed in front of the mirror, doing any manner of flexing poses. <br />
<br />
There was another knock at the door. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, you boys getting yourselves all settled in?&quot; The stunningly handsome man with a huge smile walked in. He introduced his name as Kevin, and he wore an orange suit. He said &quot;You can also call me Orange Kevin, because I have 6 identical brothers and we&#39;re all named Kevin.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Why would anyone do that to you?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It was part of a magical deal. As long as we&#39;re all named Kevin, we all get magic powers. We wear different colors. I&#39;m usually in orange or orange patterns. Brown if I really feel like being nondiscreet. And honestly, it&#39;s hard to find orange clothes. Most of my urban work, I have to wear safety vests. Construction gear. It&#39;s so butch, right? But if you see a guy in blue, red, green, gray, black or white, that&#39;s one of my brothers and they pop in here all the time. Oh my God, we just love the transformation business. So. I am your liason officer and both of you are going to have a splendid time here. Cole, we actually discovered, has some magical capabilities so we need to talk about getting him transferred. It&#39;s why he was invited here.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Really? You&#39;re gonna break someone&#39;s copyright.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No we won&#39;t. We&#39;re so lawyered up. Let&#39;s just call it &quot;Super Magic Power University&quot; for now.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t believe this but I just switched bodies with someone, so I believe this.&quot; Ken muttered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, and speaking of which, we have several clients waiting to meet with you. You&#39;re going to be popular, I just know. Meet me in an hour, one floor down in Room 203. We&#39;re bringing your stuff in. The two of you will be rooming together. That&#39;s why there are 2 bedrooms in here, you can decide which is which. And good luck. Cole, we need you to come with us for an orientation in an hour. So both of you relax, help yourself to the minibar, except no alcohol for you in that body,&quot; he pointed at Ken. &quot;Very important. Do not drink or smoke in that body. It&#39;s premium.&quot; <br />
<br />
An hour gave Ken and Cole some time to talk and marvel still over their new situation. Ken actually found himself intrigued over the idea of swapping bodies. A new body every week? There was a part of him that was now completely engrossed by the idea. Imagine it, he thought. Imagine how hot it would be...I could become someone tall, handsome, and get paid to fuck around at a resort all the time? Why the hell not?? <br />
<br />
Inside Room 203, he met with Orange Kevin and there were ten older men all sitting along broad couches, looking at him like he was dinner. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, he is perfect, I&#39;ll put in a bid,&quot; said the fat bald 50 year old grandfather sitting in the middle. He had some heft to him, an ex jock gone to fat in the gut but still muscular elsewhere. <br />
<br />
&quot;I would love to scamper around and be that thin again,&quot; the bear sitting on a chair of his own said on the far right. He was a bearded bearish man with an ample stomach, and he weighed 275 pounds. Ken knew this because Orange Kevin was brandishing index cards with stats written on them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your spending limits, good sirs?&quot; <br />
<br />
Offers of 5K and 7K were produced. Orange Kevin explained that Ken would only get paid 10% of that per week. This place was not going to be short on change anytime soon, Ken thought bitterly. 500 bucks a week was still a lot in exchange for living at a resort for free, he read. That was written on another index card that Orange Kevin handed to him. He didn&#39;t want to be fat, though. Kevin explained that they would wait until every man had a chance to make an offer. <br />
<br />
&quot;How about me, boy? Would you like my body?&quot; The man talking to him was handsome, in his 50s, and just beginning to go gray. His name was Bud. He had a military buzzcut, narrow eyes, and had a little bit of muscle on him. He was 6 feet 2 inches tall and had a short layer of thick beer-colored stubble. He wasn&#39;t fat, but he had a few extra inches on his gut. Definitely a beer drinker and a cigar smoker, according to his file. The prospect of looking like such a Daddy was really inviting to Ken. The man offered 4K for a week, and though it was less than the other offers, Ken accepted, and his cut would be $400. <br />
<br />
The swap room was just two beds sitting opposite each other. They told both the man and the boy to relax. Some people came in chanting magical spells out of big books and the next thing Ken knew, there appeared a giant whirlpool above his head. Wisps of energy-clouds descended and flew around them in circles. He was told to lie back and relax. He stared at the vortex, the storm in the room was upon him and as wisps of cloud sped around him, some rose colored lights swept him out of his body. he spun around the room several times before everything went dark. <br />
<br />
Ken blinked. He rubbed his face. <br />
<br />
He slowly got up. He was now in Bud&#39;s body. He stared at the large mirror in the blank white room he woke up in. The sun was setting outside, so he must have been out for at least four hours. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe it,&quot; he croaked. His voice had never been deep before. He had a squeaky voice before. &quot;Testing. Testing. One two three. Oh my god, I sound like...I&#39;m from Texas. Like I&#39;m a fucking STUD from Texas. Oh yeah! Look at this body!&quot; He made a muscle in the mirror. It wasn&#39;t as big as Cole&#39;s but it was bigger than his old body! He patted his beer gut and licked his lips. He wanted some beer. He had never even had beer in his whole life! <br />
<br />
It was an odd feeling. To crave something he had never had made him curious and excited. <br />
<br />
He rubbed his buzzed head, felt the short mohawk on top of his head. &quot;Hi there. My name is Bud. Glad to meetcha!&quot; He held out his hand, pretending to meet some cute young twink he could fuck. He was swimming in confidence, he realized. He was completely confident and an alpha male now, he somehow knew. Suddenly, there was an index card on the desk, telling him &quot;Yes, you are an alpha daddy now, to be specific. Enjoy your week as Bud Stanley!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Bud Stanley. I&#39;m Bud Stanley and I&#39;d like a beer, please.&quot; He practiced saying. &quot;I&#39;m gonna have a beer!&quot; He started to get dressed in the older man&#39;s clothing which had been left for him. When he arrived to his room, he found new clothing had replaced the little kid clothing from earlier. A note explained that from now on, the kid&#39;s clothes would stay in room 301. He would use this suite when he was an adult, and move between them depending on if his teen body was being occupied. It usually would have appointments filled with no problem, though, the note further explained. Misfit Island was very popular with the magical and rich non magical communities alike.</p>
