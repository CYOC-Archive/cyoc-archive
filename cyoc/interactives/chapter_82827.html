<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Erwin heard a knock on the door, he opened it to see Caleb, one of the biggest jocks on the football <br />
team.  Erwin wondered why he was attending such a cool kid's party; he was supposed to be at home studying his <br />
quantum mechanics test for AP Chemistry the next day.  Caleb was in shock when he saw the nerd, &quot;What the hell <br />
are you doing in my bathroom, you dweeb!  And where is Dave?  You had better find him, the party is going to <br />
start in half an hour!&quot;  <br />
<br />
Erwin, always hating being blamed for things, noticed a brown, argyle, cotton dress shirt in the fanny pack he <br />
had brought with him.  He was always worried he would make some kind of social error, like spilling ketchup on <br />
himself or getting pen on his shirt, and he wanted to make sure he looked presentable.  Before Caleb left, <br />
Erwin asked Caleb to put on the brown shirt, because it will &quot;make you look more presentable to your guests.&quot;  <br />
As he looked, Caleb had a strong eight pack and pecs that could be seen through his skin tight charcoal <br />
colored t-shirt.  He was also wearing black basketball shorts and ankle socks with basketball shoes.  His hair <br />
was short to the extent that it was just short but not too thin.<br />
<br />
Caleb replied, &quot;Okay, as long as you find Dave within the next half hour; I don't have time to look for him.&quot;  <br />
Then he thought, 'as soon as I get away from that geek, I will rip off this shirt and throw it in the <br />
garbage.'  Caleb threw on the shirt, and walked out.  Erwin followed close behind.  After about twenty <br />
minutes, Caleb was getting aggravated, &quot;Erwin, I need you to help me find Dave so that this social event can <br />
be commenced.&quot;  What Caleb didn't know, is that his personality was changing, and history was rewriting itself <br />
so that he never would have actually hosted a party.<br />
<br />
Erwin noticed as Caleb's basketball shorts turned from black to khaki in hue, but were still basketball <br />
shorts.<br />
<br />
Caleb then made the comment, &quot;Oh man, I need my glasses really bad right now.  Where did I put them?  Its a <br />
funny catch 22 because I need my glasses to see, but to see, I need my glasses!&quot;  He proceeded to laugh with a <br />
loud snort in the middle.  A moment ago, Caleb knew nothing about paradoxes or catch 22s, but now knew mostly <br />
everything about them.  Once he did find his large eyeglasses, he put them on and gasped at how his shirt <br />
wasn't tucked into his shorts.  &quot;Oh my goodness, I am so embarrassed!  Please excuse me for a moment.&quot;  Caleb <br />
ran into the bathroom, and tucked in his shirt to his shorts.  In that instant, the athletic material of the <br />
shorts became silk, and contracted so that the hem of the shorts was an inch above the knee.<br />
<br />
He left the bathroom and returned to where he was before, &quot;I'm sorry for inconveniencing you!&quot;  The charcoal <br />
shirt underneath the argyle, brown dress shirt disappeared from existence with a white, thin one replacing it.  <br />
&quot;What should we do, Erwin?&quot;  Caleb had forgotten about how unwelcome he thought the nerd was and now openly <br />
accepted his company; of course, Erwin was the only one who would keep him company other than his parents.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about we study for the quantum mechanic test for AP Chemistry or the Multivariable Calculus test <br />
tomorrow?&quot; Erwin asked as Caleb had risen in intelligence from Algebra 2 to Multivariable Calculus in the <br />
course of a minute.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes!  I am so excited for that test tomorrow!&quot;  Braces appeared on his teeth and it became harder to talk.  <br />
&quot;Tho ath the limit of the integral goeth to thhhhhhhhero...&quot;  Suddenly, Caleb began to lost weight.  He <br />
actually lost all of his muscle mass within a few seconds and his fat within another couple seconds.  He was <br />
as skinny as a stick now, but still extremely tall, 6'6&quot; to be exact.  Unlike Erwin who had lost his weight to <br />
vomit, Caleb's just dissipated into thin air.  It was very awkward looking.  Caleb's clothes were now way too <br />
big on him, but luckily for him, Erwin had an extra shirt and shorts.  &quot;Oh my goodnethhhhh, thank you tho <br />
muchth.  I don't know why the clothethhhhh thuddenly got tho big...&quot;<br />
<br />
Caleb, again, went to the bathroom to change, making sure not for his humongous shorts to fall down.  The new <br />
clothes were too short for Caleb, but the shirt got longer magically to fit his body.  However, the pants did <br />
not lengthen whatsoever.  The short sleeve shirt was a bright yellow with green stripes and was made of <br />
cotton.  The khaki slack shorts went to two inches above his knee.  He looked in the mirror.  &quot;Something seems <br />
off...&quot; he said, and as soon as he said that, his hair lengthened, looked like grease had been poured onto it <br />
and formed a hideous combover that would embarrass any football player.  &quot;I guess I won't figure out what it <br />
is right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Caleb returned for the second time with his new look, Erwin presented him with a clip-on bowtie.  &quot;I think <br />
that a man of your stature should own and wear one of these.&quot;<br />
<br />
Caleb was shocked and elated to see such class in his home.  &quot;Why thank you!  I had forgotten to purchase one <br />
of these at the market recently and I am excited to try it on!&quot;  Caleb took the clip of the red and blue <br />
striped bowtie and placed it on the collar of his shirt.  A pair of suspenders clipped onto his shorts and <br />
pulled themselves of the shoulders of Caleb and a sweater vest came into being on top of them.  Caleb now was <br />
a high class nerd taking the highest level class that his school would offer.  His nose bloated to the size of <br />
a clementine and his ears stretched to be ginormous.  Zits also covered his face and back.<br />
<br />
When Caleb walked to his bedroom to retrieve the chemistry textbook from his night table, he tripped over one <br />
of stairs.  This was due to a change in the material of his shoes from basketball shoes, to a fancy black <br />
dress shoes.  Also his socks whitened and raised to his calves.  In total, Caleb was now a completely <br />
different person than before.  He grabbed his textbook, opened the cover and saw his named printed in black <br />
ink.  &quot;Clarence Prinwell.  I love my name.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Erwin then screamed up the stairs, &quot;CLARENCE.  WHAT IS TAKING YOU SO LONG?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Clarence made his way back downstairs, and sat next to Erwin.  They began to study for the tests the next day.  <br />
<br />
After that, what happened?</p>
