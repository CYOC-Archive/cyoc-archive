<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hey there sweetie, its only gonna hurt a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
-Jab!-<br />
<br />
Aaron was having his shot at the nurse&#39;s office. Being unwell yesterday, he was unable to go for the shot like all of his peers at school. His entire clique, kinda deemed as &quot;the popular group&quot;, had theirs yesterday. <br />
<br />
They would always talk to one another about ANYTHING, be it fashion, science, what&#39;s trending. Which is why the young man obviously joined them when he had the chance.<br />
<br />
They were always pretty flexible and knowledgeable of the world, unlike the &quot;stereotypical&quot; popular gang whom the girls are major bimbos in cheer and the guys are your everyday douchebags hitting on girls. <br />
<br />
Though for Aaron&#39;s case, it was more like the girls always hitting on him cause of the &quot;handsome aura he gives off&quot;. Thankfully his besties are well aware of it and are able to see him past just &quot;a cute guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
They were pretty liberal, though he was the only one that was gay enough for Keith, his best straight friend who totally chilled with him despite his sexuality. They were always so supportive of him, Sam, Jill and Dani always texted and made sure he was okay, and he returned the favour.<br />
<br />
Oddly enough, he never got any of their messages since yesterday....maybe they were just tired and haven&#39;t woken up yet, its 8am after all, classes don&#39;t start till noon in college. Remind him why the school arranged such an early appointment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ughhhh.....!&quot; Aaron groaned internally, &quot;I feel so...groggy!&quot;<br />
<br />
He simply dismissed it due to him sleeping late last night, actually on a daily basis, having insomnia really sucks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nurse, do you have anything that can help you stay awake?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh heavens no! But why Mr Wong?&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron arched his right eyebrow slightly, confusingly wondering briefly why the lady called him &quot;Mr Wong&quot; when his last name was....was...ughhhh<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh....I feel kinda...lightheaded.&quot; Aaron muttered softly, his head groggy as his head swung to the sides, back and forth, as his eyes thinner than the Asian ever had.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well alright dear, just come along with me. I&#39;ll guide you to the bed!&quot; The nurse said, as she helped the tired man up from the chair as she guided him to....<br />
<br />
&quot;Ughhhhhhh.....&quot; <br />
<br />
His vision blurred, eyes drooping and nearly closing. His surroundings became a complete mist, like he couldn&#39;t differentiate anything around him, no physical matter...well except...<br />
<br />
&quot;Nurse....help...&quot; He called out to her, head gently tilting towards the direction of her face, noticing her features amidst the complete misty surroundings, and noticed that she was the only visible thing left.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ughhhhh....&quot; He drooled, felt sensations like never before. After all, he&#39;d never been so captured by a lady....until her, being attracted by his gorgeous blue eyes, her long blonde hair and her sexy smirk that seems to be oozing of deviousness and---<br />
<br />
&quot;Just relax~&quot; She flirted, as his body could barely resist the temptation under the intense effects of the drug. As he let her drag his head with his soft, delicate- manicured hands. Pressing him down below, towards her incredible jugs as he<br />
<br />
JIGGLE!<br />
<br />
As he fell asleep on them for a few hours.<br />
<br />
....<br />
-----YOU ARE STRAIGHT PLAYBOY HETEROSEXUAL BRO CONFIDENT PERSUASIVE CHARMING JUST ANOTHER ONE IN COLLEGE, SO PERFECT SO ATTRACTIVE SO YOU!------<br />
....<br />
&quot;SUP! Dude!&quot;<br />
Aaron internally woke up, head jutting upward as he immediately rubbed his eyes and starred at the wall---of lockers???!!! <br />
<br />
Huh? Wasn&#39;t he in the nurse&#39;s office?<br />
<br />
&quot;MANNNNN! You were totally wasted last night!&quot; An obnoxious bro sounding voice dragged on beside him, turning around as he noticed a figure that was 6ft over.<br />
<br />
The man kept flexing his biceps, a mighty chest exposed as he exalted his big meaty pecs and toned abs under all its glory. Sporting only a pair of XL boxers with his meat straining nicely and attractively.<br />
<br />
Aaron swooned and blushed internally as he gazed up to the alpha male towering over him... Wait...aren&#39;t those blue eyes...wait!<br />
<br />
Wait...Keith?<br />
<br />
&quot;Kenneth!&quot; Aaron called out his best friend--<br />
<br />
...Huh? Who? Wasn&#39;t he...didn&#39;t he have a different name?<br />
<br />
Aaron spaced out after calling the name of the blonde American frat jock in front of him, forgetting any other reality of said jock that&#39;s not him being a muscular dumb extroverted himbo like he is now.<br />
<br />
&quot;THAT&#39;S THE NAME DUDE!&quot; Kenneth laughed out loud, boisterous as he has always been.<br />
<br />
Yet, he must&#39;ve been best buds with a college douchebag like him...which means that&#39;s he&#39;s a playboy too! <br />
<br />
BRUH...THAT TOTALLY MAKES SENSE...<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyways Man...you look totally pansy ass wasted like a FUCKING FAGGOT!&quot; Sounding all brash and homophobic like he didn&#39;t give a shit. &quot;We gotta man you up a notch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kenneth purred as he talked about the millions of girls and the ways he tackled on them, the gestures and manly behaviour. Aaron couldnt help but just nod.<br />
<br />
Absorbing, taking in his former crush&#39;s advice on girls, reciting them in his head as he blushed internally at the new thoughts of the beautiful girls in the school. How he&#39;s man enough to tackle any of them, after being as swole as he is.<br />
<br />
Somehow knowing that, it filled whatever remaining hole that existed in the Asian&#39;s body, letting it burst out full of confidence and pride as the pheromones and tastes of the brotherhood clique resided in their co-leader.<br />
<br />
His chest pressing tightly against that new muscle shirt of his like it was nothing, showing off his incredible pecs, the size of BOWLING BALLS that rivalled the rest of the men in the locker room, ready to tackle on any challenge like he means business.<br />
<br />
He felt them, enjoying the strong filled manly sensation as it fulfilled desires over and over, running through his chiseled abs-feeling the smooth sensation of those powerful cobblestones dominating his torso.<br />
<br />
Narcissism and pride took over, an alpha male mentality like all the other men, being too good for em&#39;, already the best stud in the room and always better, smirking to himself as old desires get filled up with complete self-admiration in looks, obsessed with one self as he continued to FLEX! curling his strong, tanned, and gigantic bicep. POSE! Watching as those veins and muscle pop out at his glutes, and giving a completely lustful smirk and---<br />
<br />
FLEXXXXXXXXXXXXX!<br />
RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNGGG!<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah FUCK! Class...&quot; Aaron rolled his shoulders toughly, enjoying the satisfying cracks as he re -adjusted his neck and gave his bro a tight slap on the BUTT....!<br />
<br />
Oh SHEEEEEEET! He thought, &quot;You&#39;ve REALLY been working out! ...&quot; FUCK! Even more awkward, he felt, his heart feeling anxiety as---Dulllllllllllll<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh.....&quot; He face palmed himself and felt the rougher edges of his skin. Toughened and powerful as he gave a dumb chuckle and rubbed his homeboy on the back.<br />
<br />
More comfortable, more homely, a pair of dudes with similar interests. He wasn&#39;t afraid of the bro, he was one of em.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha! No homo brah!&quot;<br />
<br />
Brothers in arms, he returned the dude the fist bump with the special BUMP! DIS! K-BOOSH! Bro signs they instinctively knew, they invented it after all, being best buds. Saying this as he waved bye to his bro, sucks he didn&#39;t have fitness class in the gym and----!<br />
<br />
&quot;Girls...!&quot; His mind thought, as his body turned to the direction of the chicks right down the hall. Dick rock hard as it pulled him , like a new black hole just opened, an abyss that wants more, something new, something satisfying, something everyday.<br />
<br />
As his bro tried to swagger outward , his own body COMMANDED the attention and barked &quot;They&#39;re mine DUDE!&quot; As his dumb bro gave him a thumbs up and chuckled behind the male locker&#39;s room. Those trio of chicks were his to take.<br />
<br />
Douchebag serum eradicating every last drop of homosexuality within the confused teen, allowing testosterone, hormonal rage sky rocketing straighter than ever, with irresistible pheromones that take will over every chicks&#39; perception of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;And give exxxxxactly what the ladies want.&quot;<br />
<br />
He slung his toned arm and gave it a good flex for the trio of girls to see, as they stared at it, captivated by his presence and unable to move away from where they are standing, except closer and closer.<br />
<br />
The teenage heartthrob didn&#39;t resist like he used to, exulting overwhelming arrogance and cockiness as he slowly reached down to the first girl&#39;s face, tilting it upward gently so he could get a good look at her dumb blonde beauty, and smirked.<br />
<br />
THROB!<br />
<br />
He then proceeded over to the next girl, reaching lower to her waist , violating her sexually as she was frozen. Armoured to the huge hunky presence in front of her, as she too returned the favour by feeling the muscleman&#39;s toned abs.<br />
<br />
Trailing them softly down the growing treasure trail that continued to sprout an appropriate amount of asian fur amidst his six pack, though now seemingly an eight as his belly contracted immensely along with his mind and facial features. <br />
<br />
Completely devoid of fat as they hardened , strong jaw supporting a typical oval head shape as his chest and abs tightened like never could before, filled with Chi and a balance of mind and body. <br />
<br />
As his eyebrows thickened and arched, nose prominent above his sexy smirk and well trimmed goatee and slightly faint moustache below, eyes shrinking smaller and thinner. Gaze being projected more honourably with every knowledge of judo that popped in his head as he remained in a bliss, yet an overwhelming cunning tone can be felt in that Class President.<br />
<br />
He was nearly there, as his hair spiked even nicer with his years of experience. <br />
<br />
SQUISH....<br />
...!<br />
<br />
Aaron&#39;s eyes widened, like he just had a Vietnam flashback. Aside from the fact that he was probably reincarnated from most likely sergeant or higher up in his previous life, the sensation, ....the sensation of the pair...that just...sends this feeling of...of...<br />
<br />
JIGGLE...<br />
<br />
YOU ARE STRAIGHT PLAYBOY HETEROSEXUAL BRO CONFIDENT PERSUASIVE CHARMING JUST ANOTHER ONE IN COLLEGE, SO PERFECT SO ATTRACTIVE SO YOU!<br />
<br />
....AROUSED<br />
<br />
THROB THROB THROB THROB!<br />
PSSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!<br />
<br />
&quot;Damnnnnnnnn!&quot; Adrian smirked, proud of the three ladies he scored earlier during football practice, a bunch of cheerleaders that can satisfy his manly needs anytime.<br />
<br />
Thankfully his bro Kenneth and the other football guys always cover up for him during his conquests at school, that&#39;s what popularity gave ya! fuck awesome bros and fucking chicks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ive got a Ferrari parked at the back.&quot; He gestured with a cocky smirk.<br />
<br />
Adrian Wong smirked as he lead the girls to a private parking spot reserved for the soon-to-be Homecoming king himself, ready to make out and have a blast in his sweet ride.</p>
