<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She stands up, gesturing for you to stand with her, and you gladly obey her.  She grips your shirt and pulls it off of you in a single, vigorous motion.  Laying her hands on your chest, she slowly moves downwards until she eventually reaches your waist and unbuttons your jeans...<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, no, I can't do this...&quot; you protest, backing away as you momentarily come to your senses.  &quot;This is wrong, you aren't even... I mean, I don't even know you.  I can't do this with you right now, I need to get out of here!&quot;<br />
<br />
She stands up, her face having shifted back to that disinterested look she wore before.  &quot;You can't go.  You picked me, and it's been so long since I've had someone...&quot;  She starts looking dejected, and your guilt starts to bite at you.  You aren't sure how, but she knows just as well as you do why you don't want to keep going.  You try to convince yourself that it's because you have to get out of this place, that you want to escape, but you don't see any danger in this room.  Not from her, at least, and somehow you feel that as long as you're alone with her you're safe.  It's not the danger that's making you stop, or your desire to escape.  It's her.  It's the fact that she's not human.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-&quot; you start, but she just turns away.  You feel an incredible amount of pity for her, and without even thinking you blurt out, &quot;I want you to come with me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... uh, I want you to come with me.&quot;  You hate yourself for saying it, but you know it's too late to go back on it now.  You decide the best thing to do is to keep going - you can figure out what to do with her later.  &quot;Now, I mean.  I think we should both take off together.  Come on, why not?  You said you haven't had anyone for a while... well, there are a lot of guys outside of this place, and a few of them might want to get together with someone... might like you, I mean.&quot;  You're stumbling over your own words, finding it hard to talk to her without bringing up the way that she looks.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't seem to understand,&quot; she says with a frown.  &quot;I don't want a lot of guys.  You picked me.  I just want to be with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's still something you can't swallow - having a deer for a girlfriend, it just wouldn't work - but you think you can hear a hint of desperation in her voice.  This might be your ticket out of this place.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, okay, I'm sorry.  I'll tell you what: we can leave this place together, and then you and I can go on from there.&quot;  Her eyes light up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Together?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure.&quot;  She's buying it!<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm... sorry.  I can't.&quot;<br />
<br />
You almost collapse when you hear her say it.  &quot;Why not?  We could just go out there, we could sneak past them and-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you don't understand.  I can't.  None of us can.  Alice won't let us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alice?&quot;<br />
<br />
She looks down like she knows she's telling you something she shouldn't and starts to speak in a hushed tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alice is the one pretending to be a while rabbit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretending?  I don't understand.  You aren't really a deer woman?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am what I look like.  She's not.  She's what made this room, this building, this whole park.  She's what made me.  This place is... I don't know what it is.  It's like it's Alice's mind, it's a part of her somehow.  She doesn't know everything that happens here, that's how I can tell you all this without worrying about it, but if we got caught... I don't know.  I don't think I'm anything more than a thought to her, and if she wanted she could probably just snuff me out.  Even if I made it past her, I don't know if I could even exist outside of this place.&quot;<br />
<br />
The room goes silent for a moment as you both take in the impact of what she's said.  You're the first to speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;You understand that I can't stay here.  I'm... I'm real.  I don't belong in a place like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
She shakes her head.  &quot;This place is as real as you are, as long as she wants it to be.  You still don't understand.  In this place, whatever she wants to be real is real.  You managed to wander in because things from outside of this place can get in, even if most things from inside of this place can't get out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I just can't stay here.  It's too much for me.  You need to understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do.  I know you want to go, and I want to help you.  I'm just worried about what she might do if she catches you.  I've never seen her get angry at someone from outside before, but if she can control you the way she controls this place while you're in here she could do things you couldn't even imagine.  I just don't want to see that happen to you.  If you really want to risk it then I'll help you, I know you can't get out without my help, but I just wish you wouldn't.&quot;<br />
<br />
The whole story she's giving you is hard to swallow, and made only slightly easier to take given that it's coming out of a beautiful latex deer woman.  With what she's telling you it may not even be POSSIBLE to get out, and you could be better off just staying here with her.  But then, how long would you be staying for?  Hours?  Days?  Weeks?  For all you know, Alice may never give you another chance to try if you don't take this one.</p>
