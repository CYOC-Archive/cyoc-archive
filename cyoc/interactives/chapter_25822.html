<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>When Bryan returned, Sara swiveled the chair around and looked at him.</p>

<p>"Remember when we were young, and when nobody was around, we used to play dress up? We had so much fun back then."</p>

<p>"Ummm, yeah," Bryan answered, embarrassment flushing over him. "I do. How could I not?"</p>

<p>"Oh, look, how cute. You're embarrassed." She could feel her own face turning warm. "Heh, I suppose I am too. But I miss it. I remember how much fun it was, first dressing you up in my clothes, in that oversized dress I got from grandma, and then getting myself into your suit. You were a lovely wife." She giggled. "With this program, we can play house for real. Just for a short time, of course. Maybe a week or so. For old times sake. Please?"</p>

<p>"O...okay. But we can't just use your dolls, like we did. Who will be our children?"</p>

<p>"Well, mom and dad, of course. And we'll be better parents then they ever were. Oh, this'll be so much fun."</p>

<p>Later, after dinner, they set their plan into motion. Their father had retreated to his bedroom for his after-dinner nap, as usual, and their mother was downstairs.</p>

<p>"I'm thinking we'll be a young couple. You'll be 24, and I'll be half a year older. Mom and dad will of course be young. I'm thinking dad should be about two years old. And let's make them both girls."</p>

<p>"Sounds allright. Let's do it." Bryan sat down and began changing himself. He added all the knowledge a woman his age would have, of course, as well as an education in psychology. He made sure that only he and Sara would be aware of the change, put in the name Erin Singer, and pressed enter. He then did the same to Sara, giving her an education as a doctor, and the name Jules.</p>

<p>"You know what, I think I'd like to see these changes. Could you please turn our parents into our children, Jules?"</p>

<p>Bryan, soon to be Erin, walked into the bathroom and undressed. He had already changed quite a bit. His breasts were already developing, and as he looked between his legs he wasn't sure he could call himself a he anymore. His brown hair had also changed, taking on a more feminine style, as well as turning a dirty blonde. He looked on in amazement as his penis retracted fully into his body, and a feminine slit developed instead.</p> 

<p>Erin looked at herself. Despite having had children, she was still a sexy woman. Her breasts were quite small and still kept their shape. Letting her hands glide over her body, she smiled. This <i>was</i> going to be fun.</p>

<p>Sara, now pretty much Jules, opened the bathroom door. He grinned when he saw his wife standing there naked. "You look very sexy, Bry..er, Erin."</p>

<p>"You're turning out not half bad yourself, <i>Jules</i>." Erin hadn't realised until now how much smaller she had become. She looked at her now husband as he too stripped down. Hair had started to develop on his chest, and his manhood was starting to grow large. Too large, she realised. It didn't take long for her to understand why, though, as it soon stood on attention, fully erect and seemingly fully operational.</p>

<p>"Mmmm...seems like our transformations are finished," she said, purring and taking a step towards Jules.</p>

<p>"Not quite," he said, grinning. "At least not for you."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" And then she knew. She could feel her belly expanding. "You...made me pregnant?"</p>

<p>"Yes. We never did say anything about how old, ehm, mom should become. I made her about fifteen weeks. Well, a fifteen weeks old fetus, at least."</p>

<p>"No, but we never agreed that you could do something like this to <i>my</i> body either!" Erin replied.</p>

<p>"No, but I remembered that one time when we played you being pregnant, and how you had enjoyed it. I thought it a nice surprise. And I did change you a bit too, so that you'll have an easy pregnancy."</p>

<p>"Well, thank you for that, I suppose. Wait, you didn't do anything more, did you?"</p>

<p>"No, not much. I took a quick peek on your sexual preferences and personality, thinking to make you more submissive. Turns out I didn't need to do that. I did up your horniness a few notches, but that's minor, I suppose. Though as you might know, pregnant women are often quite horny even without that."</p>

<p>"Oh god yes. I've noticed that. I was willing to fool around a bit when you came in here, but now I practically can't wait for you to take me." Erin let Jules step closer, savouring his sweet smell. He kissed her, his arm slipped around her and pulled her close. She could feel his erect member against her engorged tummy. She wanted him here and now.</p>

<p>"Wait," she said. "How's...Emma? That's what you called her, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Relax, she's fine. I made sure that she was when I changed her. She should be sleeping for at least a couple of hours more." He kneaded her asscheek with one hand. "We have plenty of time."</p>

<p>Jules lifted his wife up and carried her to his bedroom.</p>

<p>"I'll give you the best fucking you've ever had."</p></p>
