<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It took a good hour to work our way down the service arriving at long last behind the P.I. Animal Husbandry Lab. I got out as did the driver and we opened the rear door to find Marcia face down on the deck. Helping the driver set Marcia up and then walk her in through the rear doors of that Lab had me wondering how long before I would get caught?<br />
<br />
The driver had her chart signed and I bid her a good day and told her I'd continue along with the condemned. A friendly wave off and I was standing there next to a druged Marcia Caldwell.<br />
<br />
A pair of muscle bound Lab Techs came over to take hold of Marcia and as they saw my badge almost saluted. I told them it was my orders to continue to escort this one through the entire processing and then report back.<br />
<br />
No problem, I followed as they plopped Marcia in a wheelchair and began her tour of the Lab. We arrived to an exam room where the men began to remove Marcia's clothing. As I stood by one of the men handed me a chart and on it was her serial number, and a long listing of qualifications.<br />

<br />
The entire plan of taking someone like Marcia and with Reformation Flux Virus serums a valued animal she would become. I watched as rectal probes were inserted and the first of their serums was begun by a drip bag and interveinus insertion, I had to get her out of there and quick.<br />
<br />
Due to my asserted rank I was left with Marcia as the two big men left to notify the Grade 1 scientist.<br />
<br />
I moved right in and slapped Marcia to a half awake state. Informed her of the situation I needed a little help from her if we were to make a break for the mainland.<br />
<br />
Try and fuss as my ten thumbs could the drip bag and the insertion had to come along. Loaded again into a wheelchair we soon were out back and looking for a vehicle. Looking for one with the keys still inside I found a one ton pickup setting there ready.<br />
<br />
Suddenly bells began to ring and I shoved Marcia in the passenger side of the truck. Then ripping my shirt pocket half off I tossed my hat into the driveway and grabbed some dirt from a flower pot. Smugging my face I was soon greeted by the two big men and three guards.<br />
<br />
&quot;They grabbed a truck and headed down the road into the Park!&quot; I remember yelling. They gave a quick look at me for trying to stop the abduction and jumping into two vehicles they headed back into the Park.<br />
<br />
I jumped into the pickup truck and headed up the service road toward the main gate. A simple flash of my I.D. was enough and a return of their salute. A screech of rubber tires hitting the pavement to US-2 and we were out and running.<br />
<br />
Thinking it best to get as far away as quick as possible I paid no attention to Marcia or that damn drip bag. It was a good two hours later when in a rest stop I looked over to see Marcia's eyes rolled up into her skull as the serum was putting her into some sort of shock.<br />
<br />
Bending over the console I reached for the serum bag to find it all but gone inside her veins. A bit of a fuss and it came out as she moaned laying spread out over the seat naked as a Jaybird.<br />
<br />
I'm not a good judge of beauty in women or horses but Marcia's lender figure and well endowed chest reminded me of younger years long gone. She moaned as the serums was racing about doing whatever their prep serum would do. I looked about the rest area as she need some clothing to be a little less conspicuous.<br />
<br />
Covering her over with the sheet I'd stole from the Lab, I locked her inside the truck cab and headed off for what was available. As luck was running my way there was a slim sized pair of coveralls hanging in the janitor's service locker along with a clean T-shirt and some sandels.<br />
<br />
Wadding the clothes into a bundle I headed back to the truck as Marcia still drugged up well sat there naked and showing it off.<br />
<br />
Jumping in the truck we headed out of the busy parking lot and stood soon along side the highway. Urging her to stay awake I helped the lady dress. Then we took off and getting onto a side road we kept working our way North for five hours more.<br />
<br />
It was very late when I had to stop for gas and to use the facility. I offered Marcia but she was still out in left field somewhere. The tank full again offered another good 400 miles before he'd stop again.<br />
<br />
As the Sun peaked over the horizon I thought to stop at a roadside picnic area and try again to wake Marcia from her slumbering. It was then I took note of what the serum had begun.<br />
 <br />
Like the serum qualification listing noted some of Marcia's complextion was in the mode of change. Her pretty pink skin was now like a very dark summer's tan. Her lips, and the nostrils were very dark and almost black in color. Her ears were a little bit pointed and almost covered in a fuzzy light down of hairs.<br />
<br />
She was really drugged out cold and as she maoned I unloaded her from the truck to lay spread out over a picnic table. Then the erotic thought hit home and seeing what had changed I wondered what other changes had happened were I could not see?<br />
<br />
Looking for anybody around I loosened her bibbs and slid them down to her waist. Like the soft tissue of lips and nose her nipples were now also black as coal. The fuzz was fast sprouting and spreading all over as the color was showing of her hair coat. <br />
<br />
Minutes passed quickly as I wondered what to do with her seeing that you just can't take her to a hospital and drop her off! A slip down of the bibs to hang about her knees gave me a look that I'd not thought she'd offer if awake. He groin was fast changing too. The new black hide and hairs had enclosed her there as if she was born a mare.<br />
<br />
She moaned yet sound asleep she was as I tried my best to redress her before I decided to rape her just for fun. Oh I know it would be wrong to rape a woman in slumber like that but heck she' was on her way to become a pony mare, so why not then?<br />
<br />
Again I loaded this sack of flesh into the truck's cab and we headed back up the highway. It was about fiveish when she began to mutter as the sedation wore off.<br />
<br />
A Motel loomed ahead and I stopped getting us a room for the night. An extra ten spot for the  desk clerk and I had a garage to put the truck out of sight. I know he watched me help and almost carry Marcia into the room but there was no other way!<br />
<br />
Marcia laid spralled out over one double bed as I got cleaned up and thought about some diners.<br />
<br />
A moan then, &quot;What the Hell, Oh My GOD!&quot; she said as in getting up the first thing a woman does is look in a mirror.</p>
