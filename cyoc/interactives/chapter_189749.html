<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You decide to spend the rest of the day with Reyna, now that the two of you are even closer due to the similarity of your circumstances. And after sharing your side of things, she immediately believes you as it is too much of a coincidence for it to be false, and that you have no reason to lie about this. After school, the two of you spend time together on a &quot;date&quot; as you both put it. Mostly this was just a title so Max doesn&#39;t feel left out, but you are happy nonetheless about it. <br />
<br />
Your &quot;date&quot; is just you going over to Reyna&#39;s house as her house was closer and you both could just walk there from school. Plus no one else would be home for the rest of the night as both of her parents worked at the same office and were sent on a buisness trip for the next few days.<br />
<br />
When you first see her home, you are surprised. It is far larger than you were expected it to be. But that is just the start of it. For one, according to Reyna, every commonly used door in the entire place, save for supply closets, has recently been updated to include a doggy door. It never has occurred to you that you may be using one as you had just assumed you would wake up in a forest somewhere. So when Reyna drops down onto all fours and runs down her driveway and through her front door, it takes you a few seconds to mentally accept  what just happened in front of you was real. But when she sticks her head back out and calls you, you come back to the present and follow her lead by crawling through the door on all fours after her.<br />
<br />
You two end up staying on all fours and continue moving throughout her mansion of a home as it is significantly easier to just pass through the doggy doors then to fuss with trying to open every single one of the round door knobs with your paws. And everyone you pass by, be it maids, groundskeeper, or whoever, all seem to either greet you and Reyna with an awkwardamount of respect, or just quietly bow as they stand to the side to let you both pass. When you get to her room, you  lay down on the ground as there are no chairs or even a normal bed to sit on, just a similar dog bed like your room now has, which Reyna has already claimed for herself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, what is with everyone? Are they all normally like this all the time with you?&quot; You ask, no longer able to contain your curiosity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, well I guess so. At least they have been this way ever since I finished turning into my current self about years 2 ago. My grandma is Japanese and while I am not too familiar myself with their folklore or whatever, apparently foxes are a big deal. Something around the lines of they bring about prosperity and good luck, or something. And as I am basically a talking anthropomorphic fox girl, you can guess as to how her side of the family took my existence. Even though they seemed to completely forget about me ever being a normal human, and now just are waiting for me to gain a human form. Its kinda ridiculous when it is you and I who are thinking about it, but I can&#39;t help but think there may be some small semblance of truth to their claims. For example, about a month after I finished turning, my Mother won the lottery and my Dad&#39;s company promoted him to a branch manager, and then, along with his massive pay raise, gifted him 2 of their properties to own for an income bonus.&quot; Explains Reyna. <br />
<br />
If you take into consideration this massive mansion that was just recently built, along with the numerous fox statues you remember seeing lining the hallways, then it is a hard claim to openly refute. But there was a point that you were still hung up on. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well if that is the case then, and it is some kind of Japanese thing, then how am I involved? My family isn&#39;t Japanese in the slightest. Hell, I don&#39;t even thing anyone of us has even left the country for an overseas vacation in at least the last 60 or so years. So why did I turn into an anthropomorphic fox?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is exactly my thought as well. I was mostly sold on the idea until I met you. But maybe some other relationship or forces are in play here that we just don&#39;t know about. Who knows, maybe you became like this just to become my mate?&quot; Says Reyna with a flirty connotation at the end. <br />
<br />
You grin, but then remember something she just said. &quot;Wait hold up a second. Are you telling me you have been a fox for almost 2 years now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mhmm. It will be 2 years next month. Why?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well it just was unexpected to me is all. I literally just started turning into one a few days ago. How have the 2 years been? Was it hard to adjust to things?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was a first, especially the going outside to relieve myself part, and especially when it is wet out. And mud would quickly make my fur a dirty and clumpy mess. Plus, since I have all white fur, it would mean I needed to take a bath and couldn&#39;t just rinse it off. Don&#39;t get me wrong though, I love having my white fur, and I love you having your red fur very much. And after a while, especially when we became both financially stable and financially independent, things got a lot easier for a time. I got use to being like this. When you think about it, it is pretty convenient not having to worry about makeup, picking out outfits, getting dressed in general, waiting in lines to use the bathroom, etc. And moving around on all fours isn&#39;t that bad either since I am faster like that and I can do it when I feel like it, and then stand up like a normal human when I don&#39;t. And sure, I never will be able to drive a car, but now I can just buy a car and then hire a driver to take me anywhere.&quot;<br />
<br />
You are relieved to hear her say that. It means that you will likely also come around to living like this, where you no longer mind it too much. And you definitely won&#39;t be doing it alone, unlike how she had to. &quot;So now that that is out of the way, what do you want to do?&quot;</p>
