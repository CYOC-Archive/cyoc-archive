<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Some time during the you woke with a cramp in your lower abdomen. You tried to ignore it but it only got worse. Eventually giving up on sleeping you tried to quietly exit the bed so as to not disturb Ele and made your way to the toilet. As soon as you stood up the pain got a lot worse. Somehow you got to the toilet and turned the light on.<br />
<br />
What you saw shocked you. The bare area under your penis was swollen and an ugly shade of purple. it felt like your skin was about to burst. Somehow you managed to sit on the toilet and tried to pee. Tried to get whatever this was out of you. You suspected this was the period Ele had warned you about and half expected blood to come out of your penis. But all that came out was urine. If you were bleeding it wasn&#39;t going to come out that way.<br />
<br />
You didn&#39;t know what to do and just sat there. The pain was unbearable. You felt you were about to burst. <br />
<br />
Despite your best attempts you had somehow woken Ele. She pushed the door open and saw you sobbing on the toilet. &#39;What&#39;s happened Jay? What&#39;s wrong?&#39;<br />
<br />
You manged to blurt out &#39;I think I&#39;m bursting. It hurts so much&#39; She helped me get up and immediately saw my swollen groin area. <br />
<br />
&#39;Shit! I&#39;m calling an ambulance. Something looks awfully wrong&#39;  She helped you back to bed first. It felt a bit better once you were lying down but the pain was still the worst you had ever experienced. You were quite grateful when you heard Ele calling an ambulance. You knew this couldn&#39;t be normal<br />
<br />
After what seemed forever Ele said &#39;I can see an ambulance down stairs. They will be here soon. hang on&#39; You vaguely saw her getting dressed. She put on the clothes she had taken off earlier. Fair enough she didn&#39;t want to be naked when the paramedics arrived. <br />
<br />
She went to the door and I heard her directing the paramedics to my room. &#39;It&#39;s my room-mate. She&#39;s in here. She went to the Transfer clinic and came out mutilated, something has gone wrong. She&#39;s in terrible pain&#39; <br />
<br />
You tried to call out &#39;I&#39;m a he&#39; but all that came out was an indecipherable moan.<br />
<br />
Soon there were people crowded around you. You heard someone gasp &#39;It&#39;s some sort of hernia. it looks like she is about to explode.<br />
<br />
&#39;Can you give her something for the pain?&#39; You heard Ele&#39;s voice saying.<br />
 <br />
&#39;Yes. I think we need to knock her out. That looks very serious. Hang on there girl. This will ease the pain&#39;<br />
<br />
Someone else was saying &#39;We won&#39;t get a stretcher down those stairs. You will have to walk her out&#39;<br />
<br />
You felt a needle going into your arm. &#39;Things will get better now&#39; someone said into your ear. That was the last thing you remembered.<br />
<br />
Ele was distressed seeing her newfound friend in such pain. She was glad when the paramedics knocked her out. She wasn&#39;t pleased when they suggested they were going to have to walk her down the stairs. She was naked and the commotion had bought all the neighbours out to see what was going on.<br />
<br />
Thinking she was doing the right thing she retrieved a blue wrap dress from her swag. She had no time to search Jay&#39;s own wardrobe and she knew the dress was easy to put on and take off. She didn&#39;t care about the dress, If Jay&#39;s hernia burst and the dress was ruined it wouldn&#39;t matter. At least she would have preserved Jay&#39;s modesty. She helped put in on Jay as the paramedics stood her up. She followed them as they gently transferred her friend down the stairs then onto a waiting stretcher. <br />
<br />
A paramedic offered Ele a ride to the hospital in the back of the ambulance. She accepted. She wanted to be there when her friend woke up. First though she ran back upstairs and retrieved Jay&#39;s keys and her own handbag before locking the door.<br />
<br />
At the hospital Jay was rushed into emergency. Ele was left to tell a nurse what she knew about the patient. Ele realised she knew very little about her friend. She did say how she had met Jay at the psychologists and knew and that Jay had been eager to get her genitals repaired after she had been deformed by botched transfer. <br />
<br />
She went to a waiting room and .... waited.<br />
<br />
About an hour later a doctor emerged and wanted to speak with her.<br />
<br />
&#39;How is she doctor?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Not good. Can I ask what your relationship with the patient is?&#39;<br />
<br />
After a brief hesitation Ele said &#39;I&#39;m her room-mate&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Can you put us in contact with her family?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Sorry. I don&#39;t know anything about her family. I don&#39;t even know if she has one&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;We need someone to authorise the operation that needs to happen. We need to repair her whole groin area. She was left without an outlet for her uterus. Her menstrual blood built up and she has developed septicemia. Whoever did that to you friend should be jailed. I have already performed an emergency surgery and released the pressure. However long term we will need to create her a new vagina&#39; <br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;m asking you this as we have an opportunity now to do an emergency transfer. A car accident victim who died earlier tonight is an organ donor. Thanks to a community service clause on their licence, The Transfer Clinic must make their technology available for emergencies. I consider this an emergency. It&#39;s actually a much safer and infinitely faster process than the old fashioned method of reconstructive surgery which is our only alternative. Would you be willing to sign the document as the closest to the next of kin we have? We must hurry as the dead girls parts have only a limited life span. Knowing your friend would she be willing to undergo such a transfer?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Yes she would. That&#39;s what she was doing when I met her. She was trying to get a psychologists referral to get her genitals repaired. She was frustrated by the long potential wait&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Well the way things are she won&#39;t have to wait. She will have a pleasant surprise when she wakes. Stay here while I get the wheels of a transfer in motion. A nurse will be here shortly with forms for you to sign. Excuse me now time is critical&#39; The doctor hurried off.<br />
<br />
Ten minutes later a nurse arrived with a stack of forms for Ele to sign. She did so without hesitation.</p>
