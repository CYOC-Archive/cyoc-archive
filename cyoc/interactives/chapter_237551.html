<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Joy hummed a Halloween tune as she bent down to preheat the oven. As she did so, the sound of cloth tearing could be heard. Behind her, a long tail emerged as burnt orange fur grew on it. Thick dark brown fur covered its tip as it swished back and forth. Hearing this noise Joy looked back and gave a mild gasp. She saw her new tail and grabbed it. It felt so soft yet she could feel how flexible it was. &#39;like a monkey&#39; she thought as she went back to making the cookies. She probably would&#39;ve freaked out more if her mind wasn&#39;t being altered in tandem with her physical changes. It wasn&#39;t like she thought she always had a tail, rather it was she didn&#39;t see it as a big deal to suddenly grow it.  <br />
<br />
After preheating the oven Joy got the ingredients and set them on the kitchen island. Hearing more cloth tearing she looked down and saw her thighs grow in height and muscle. Through the tears, she could also see more burnt orange fur covering them. In contrast, her decently large butt shrunk as the fat was replaced by muscle. She let out a moan as her anus rearranged to set right under her tail.  <br />
<br />
As she began pouring the ingredients in she felt her clit pushing out. She gripped the island as the button popped on her ruined pants and the zipper was pushed down. Looking down Joy was a little shocked to see a large barbed cock poking out of her panties. The two-foot cock was already pushing the pink cloth to its limits when her pussy began to droop. The walls sealed and pushed out both leg holes before Joy moaned again. he tried to be quiet as while the walls were somewhat thick in this house they weren&#39;t soundproof. As her ovaries descended they mutated into large testicles the size of a baseball each. Joy felt relief as the ugly garment snapped off his sack while creme fur covered his large balls. A seat then formed around his cock as he cumed. Turns out the squeezing of his testicles made him incredibly horny. This led to his knees and calves changing faster before gaining more burnt orange fur.  <br />
<br />
After he was done his cock retreated. He was thankful that his cock was stuck under the island otherwise the cookies would&#39;ve been too salty. He then got back to the cookies he began mixing the ingredients when another uncomfortable change happened. His feet ballooned out as they merged into a fleshy mass. He leaned on the counter as he pulled one shoe off. His socks were quickly reduced to species as his new paws burst out. His other shoe didn&#39;t last much longer as black claws pierced through before his paws did. Black pads grew on them as he shook the ruined clothing off of him. he carefully pulled his tail out from its hole to let his useless pants fall to the ground.  <br />
<br />
As he molded the dough into balls his torso began to alter. His slight hourglass figure began to shift to a v shape. The fur crept up his abs as he used a spoon to press down on the doughy balls. As he was grabbing some chocolate chips he moaned as his chest felt like it was on fire but in a good way. He dropped the chips as his cock emerged from its sheath. He massaged his dwindling mounds while humping the island. As the fat of his breast melted away his new pecs barreled out. This made the ugly pink shirt he was wearing tear apart and his equally disgusting pink bra snapped off and fell to the floor.  <br />
<br />
Once it was done he cummed once again causing cream fur to run up his front and burnt orange up his sides and back. The added change made it harder for him to stand upright as he picked up some spilled chips. Once the chocolate was in place he carefully put them in the oven. His swelling biceps made it a little difficult but he did it. he then went down to all fours. It wasn&#39;t that he couldn&#39;t stand on two legs but rather it felt better to be like this.  <br />
<br />
With no more distractions at the moment, he was now able to focus on his changes. Each moment that passed he got more handsome. How he lived his life pinning over boys and doing girly things is beyond him. he soon noticed an interesting change in his arms. At the elbows, the fur suddenly stopped. Instead dull yellow scales grew and left a line every couple of inches where it would dip inwards slightly. His forearms didn&#39;t grow as much as his biceps but were larger than before. Once the scales passed his wrist he was somewhat surprised to see his pinkey and thumb shrinking into his body. Once they were gone the other three grew with the center ones being larger than the outer ones. Black talons poked his fingernails off one at a time. Surprisingly there wasn&#39;t any blood.  <br />
<br />
His neck then thickened while thick burnt orange feathers covered it. His ears moved up his head as it began to change. They became large triangles covered in dark brown fur with creme fur inside. he closed his eyes as the fur spread across his face. His creme fur surrounded his lips, it ended at his jawline with a pointed stripe between his eyes. His lips turned yellow as they hardened and pushed out. Jay&#39;s teeth melded into his growing beak as his tongue grew to fit. The beak gained a hook to it as his nostrils settled into it.  <br />
<br />
Opening his now green eyes he saw all his pink dyed hair falling to the ground. He couldn&#39;t fathom why he had ever liked pink. Sure girls seemed to like it and if a girl he dated wore pink he wouldn&#39;t mind but it was not him anymore. With a beep, the oven told him it had finished baking the cookies. With a grunt, he pushed himself back up and grabbed the oven mitts. Jay groaned as his sharp talons pierced the cloth. It was somewhat difficult with talons instead of fingers but he successfully got them out and set them on top.  <br />
<br />
He let out a grunt as he felt pressure on his back. He held back a screech as something grew out of him and hit the cooking utensils on the island. Everything was flung off as his dark brown wings retraced to his sides. He put his talons over his ears as the crash was so loud. Glancing over the island he saw the mixing bowl had shattered. &quot;Man Gwyn just bought that last week,&quot; Jay said. His voice was a strong tenor. He grabbed a broom and dustpan and began sweeping the shattered bowl up. Once that was done he put away what he could and threw the rest in the trash.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Joy?&quot; he heard a voice say. Turning around he found himself at eye level with his dragon roommate. &quot;heh, guess you heard that. Sorry the bowl broke&quot; Jay said. He walked back to the stove and put the cookies on a plate. Once he was done he picked up a cookie then sat down like a dog and took a bite. He somehow knew his digestive juices could handle anything he used to chew. Gwyn just stared at him with utter shock.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; the griffin said. &quot;what do you mean &#39;what&#39;? You&#39;re a Griffin and a guy?&quot; Gwyn spoke. Jay Shrugged threw the rest of the cookie in his mouth &quot;So?&quot;. Gwyn was shocked at his cool demeanor at his roommate&#39;s transformation. &quot;I mean how did this happen?&quot; Gwyn asked. Jay couldn&#39;t understand why he was making a big deal out of this. If anything they could act more like siblings than before. &quot;I don&#39;t know how this happened. I was making cookies when I started to change, no big deal.&quot; he stood on all fours and began picking up his ruined clothes.  <br />
<br />
Gwyn sniffed the air and saw cum sliding down the side of the kitchen island. &quot;did you do this?&quot; Gwyn asked. Jay eye-rolled as he stood on two legs and used a wet cloth to clean the cum off. &quot;hey you of all of us should know how horny myths can get&quot; he said. He then threw the rest of his torn clothing in the trash. &quot;better?&quot; he gestured with a talon. &quot;aren&#39;t you gonna put on something, Bella could be home any minute. The Griffin gave a deep laugh as he passed the dragon anthro. &quot;are you kidding me right now? Clothing is so uncomfortable. Besides none of my clothing would fit me anyway, not that I&#39;d want to wear that trash again&quot; Jay said while walking up the stairs. Gwyn just stood there mouth agape. The Joy he knew loved her outfits. &quot;Joy...&quot; Gwyn saw the Griffin stop in his open doorway. &quot;call me Jay, k?&quot; he then used his back leg to close the door.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Gwyn was really confused. How did his best friend become a male griffin? He pondered it as he sat in the dining room and ate his cookie. Looking at the remaining cookies he saw there was just enough for his other roommates. Shaking his head he picked up the plate. Walking up to the second story he stood in the hall. He knew Bella was out still so that left Alice and Wendy.  <br />
<br />
He decided to knock on Alice&#39;s door. &quot;Alice I need to talk to you.&quot; he didn&#39;t get an answer. Normally Gwyn would leave her alone but he needed to talk to someone about this. &quot;I&#39;m coming in&quot; he opened the door. Gwyn dropped the plate when he saw Alice&#39;s room. Like with Joy clothing was ripped and laying on the ground. The only difference was the open window and the fact Alice was gone. He suddenly remembered the howl he heard. &quot;no.&quot; he whispered as he rushed to the window. He saw indentations in the yard and dirty prints going down the road before fading away. He then had a horrible thought and prayed he was wrong. he ran to Wendy&#39;s door and barged in. To his despair his theory was right.</p>
