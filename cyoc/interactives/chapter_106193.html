<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Martin led Dr. France’s into his home office. He noticed a couple work related e-mails flashing on his computer screen but chose to ignore them for the time being. Sitting down on the sofa he begins; “So where do we start?”<br />
<br />
Dr. Twist takes a chair adjacent to Martin’s desk and sits down. “It was clear that Melissa is upset over your cheating. Other than Alyssa; who else have you not told her? <br />
<br />
Martin grimaces. He knew he was going to have to tell; but he was hoping that it wouldn’t have to be today. Sighing he begins to recounted all the times he has cheated.<br />
“First the women were all weres. I never cheated on Melissa with a normal person.” Martin sighs, “After Alyssa, I made sure not to turn another person regardless if they begged me. And there were a few.”<br />
“Did you get any of these women pregnant?” Frances probes.<br />
“No!” Martin states emphatically; “I made sure all were on there were-birth control pills.” Sounding embarrassed, “Some were rather turned off when I asked, but I told them unless they can prove they won’t get knocked up, I wasn’t going to touch them.”<br />
“Has Melissa ever caught you in the act with these women?” Dr. Twist asks.<br />
“No” Martin answers. Of all the times Melissa caught me; the women were either put off with the above question I told you or assumed that Melissa was going to join in and then stormed out mad.”<br />
“But you have had sex with other women, other than with Alyssa and Melissa;” Frances asks.<br />
“Yes,” Martin lowers his head, clearly ashamed of himself. “I’m not proud of it. But it has happened. At times, late at the office with an intern or sometimes when I am forced to go out of town for official mayoral business.”<br />
<br />
Dr. Twists writes a few notes in her note pad then speaks up. “I want you to write a letter to Melissa.” Dr. Frances Twist continues, “In that letter you need to write down every act of sex you did during your marriage with Melissa that didn’t involve her.”<br />
<br />
Martin blanches at the task, but Frances continues. “You must also ask for her forgiveness. Now this letter doesn’t need to be written write away. But you will need to have it ready by the time we have another group session.” France’s, looks at her watch. “I think we are done for now. Let’s head back to the family room.<br />
As both Frances and Martin returned, Julie sees her father and runs to him. Still in tears, she sobs; “I’m sorry daddy.”<br />
Martin looking at Melissa completely confused. Melissa just smiles while eating her toast.<br />
<br />
Dr. France’s makes a polite cough to get every ones attention. “I think it would be best if I talk to Julie next in private.”<br />
<br />
As Dr. Twist leads Julie into Martin’s office; turned makeshift therapy room. Martin sits down on a stool looking sullen and contrite.<br />
<br />
Melissa looking at him speaks; “Penny for your thoughts?”<br />
Martin looks up, “It was what Frances said to me. Correction, what she wants me to do.”<br />
“And what is that?” Melissa asks.<br />
“I’m to write you a letter.” Martin pauses, “it is supposed to detail every time I cheated on you and to ask for your forgiveness.”<br />
<br />
Melissa just looks at Martin as she finishes her toast. It is clear that this is going to be a difficult hurdle for both to overcome.<br />
<br />
****<br />
<br />
Julie sits on her father&#39;s couch while Frances takes the seat she used earlier when talking to Martin.<br />
“How are you feeling Julie?”<br />
Julie still teary eyed from her talk with her mother doesn’t answer.<br />
“Do you mind telling me what your mother just told you?” Frances asks.<br />
Julie looks up. “She said that dad would choose to save the town over me if it came to maintaining the town’s secret.”<br />
“Well,” France’s answers. “As a city official, your father has to put the safety of the town over his family.” Dr. Trist continues, “It’s the same with the mayors of other towns.”<br />
“But those towns don’t have a were population like ours,” Julie cuts in.<br />
“True,” Frances answers. “But they all have their own special needs. Some like in Nevada have to deal with issues pertaining to water. Will there be enough from Lake Meade. Or will there be a drought.” Towns’ that formed from mining or logging have issues with employment.” Frances pauses; “but that doesn’t mean that they are no different than ours.”<br />
“Yet they won’t execute a citizen for committing a crime,” Julie responds.<br />
“You’re referring to the town’s statue 1A policy,” Frances notes. “True no other town then ours has that directive. But ask me this; when was the last time someone was sentenced to death for that violation?”<br />
“None that I know of,” Julie answers.<br />
“That’s because it’s not something that is discussed freely.” Dr. Twist continues, “But it has happened. Fortunately not during you father’s watch;” Frances continues, “What else did you mother tell you.”<br />
“She told me that she’s pregnant,” Julie answers.<br />
“How do you feel about that?” France asks.<br />
Julie just shrugs her shoulders.<br />
“You don’t care?” Frances asks<br />
“Yes. No. I’m not sure,” Julie answers.<br />
<br />
Frances takes down some notes over what Julie has said so far. “Tell me; how do you feel about your parents attending marriage counseling?”<br />
“This is something that will save their marriage?” Julie asks.<br />
“In time, yes.” Frances answers; “So how do you feel about it?”<br />
“If it will get dad to stop dipping his wick as it were with other floozies; then I’m fine with it,” Julie Answers.<br />
Frances writes down more, slightly arching an eyebrow over Julie’s last statement. “Okay Julie, Frances says. “I have one more thing to ask you.”<br />
“Shoot doctor,” Julie responds.<br />
“I want you to write a letter to both of your parents.” Frances continues, “In it you must describe why you have been so rebellious of late. Also state how sorry you are for the grief that you have put them through with your recent actions. Also state what you would like to see change between them and you.”<br />
“Is that all?” Julie asks.<br />
“Not quite.” Frances continues, “While you will still have to answer for the crime you committed while at school; I also want you to write a letter of apology to Eric Anderson. Both should be completed by the time we continue with the next group session.”<br />
“I have to apologies?” Julie’s answers, disgusted.<br />
“Yes, Frances answers. “While it might not help in regards to when you see a judge, it couldn’t hurt.” Frances continues while getting up. “The letter to your parents will be read to them, while I will deliver your letter of apology to Eric myself.”<br />
<br />
Julie, not liking what she needs to do, decide it couldn’t hurt. As she heads out of her father’s office with Frances behind her; Julie chooses to go up to her room to start her assignment. Both Martin and Melissa see this. As Melissa is about to get up Martin interrupts her.<br />
“Can you talk to Frances here darling? I need to get some office work done.<br />
“I guess,” Melissa answers.<br />
“I’m fine with that as well, “Frances responds.<br />
Martin leaves to his office to catch up on the emails he ignored while Frances finishes her session with Melissa.</p>
