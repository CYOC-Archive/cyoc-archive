<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the game continued I glanced at the women around the table. Women at this point wouldn’t really describe them now as they. All of them had regressed significantly at this point leaving them between 13 and 19. I had noticed though that once the girls reentered their teens they appeared to become slightly shy about their youthen ingredients bodies. All of them now wore T-shirt’s and shorts as they giggled girlishly. I also noticed that the Mrs. part of their names had been abandoned, the girls were now simply going by their first names.<br />
<br />
Mom, or Deanna as she now went by, had gone from 35 to 18 alone with Mrs. Flemington, now Nancy. The two were the oldest of the group still. Neither brunette had shrunk in height but their teenage bodies had returned leaving them with perky near C cup breasts, narrow waists, glowing hair that cascaded to the middle of their backs and innocent faces. Deanna and Nan y both seemed to be quite giddy at their new found youth.<br />
<br />
Next was Mrs. Gabrielli, Mrs Sheridan, and Mrs. Sassoon or Ariana, Tracy, and Amanda. The women were now only 16 with youthful, happy faces and perky B cup breasts. Ariana’s dark locks appeared to have grown out significantly descending nearly to her waist while Tracey and Amanda’s had grown to the middle of their backs. The two blonds now adjusted their loosening t shirts that kept sliding off their waifish frames while admiring their lean and flawless legs.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Priven or Hannah, was now only 15. Hannah’s curly brown locks bounced with renewed life as she giggled and glanced at her cards. Hannah had relived a growth spurt in reverse after losing last round and marveled at the fact she was now two inches shorter than before. The girl had retrieved a tape measure from the kitchen and measured herself before taking a seat. Her voice, which had risen a couple of octaves, only seemed higher as she excitedly talked about her shrinking body. After watching her I realized that Hannah was probably a very energetic girl  when she was 15 the first time. Fortunately or unfortunately, depending how you wanted to look at it, she wasn’t the only one who was reliving a growth spurt in reverse.<br />
<br />
Mrs Vranch And Mrs. Wells, now Karen and Stephanie, were only 14 now and astounded by how skinny and young looking they were. Karen, a honey haired girl and Stephanie, a raven haired girl, now possessed very youthful and innocent faces with waifish figures. Both girls continually glanced down the front of their shirts astounded that their once prominent breasts were now small B cups. Both girls also had shrank in height at least 2 or 3 inches at this point and gazed at the others in wonder, marveling at the fact that even though everyone was now younger, from their youthened perspective, they appeared quite mature.<br />
<br />
Finally their was Mrs. Janson, now Diana. The girl was now only 13, making her not only the youngest but the shortest as well. The woman’s, now girls hair had originally been a dark auburn shade but had lightened as she grew younger. Now Diana’s hair was almost fire red while her once prominent D cup breasts had been reduced to barely B’s. The grumpy looking girl had folded her arms across her smaller chest as she unhappily gazed at the others at the table. While her Look was meant to be intense on her 13 year old face it looked like a girl who had been told no. Diana scrunched up her nose on her freckle covered face as she watched the cards being dealt.<br />
<br />
“Doing okay Diana,” I smirked as I finished dealing the cards. “I’m fine,” she grumbled as she picked up her cards. I smiled and nodded as I picked up my cards. “Good,” I smiled. “Oh and by the way, don’t forget to ante up dear.”<br />
<br />
Diana paused as she watched the others throw their chips into the center of the table, each of them regressing another year. Diana counted her chips, realizing that the ante would cause her to exit her teens, leaving her a child. Taking a deep breath, the girl threw her chip to the center, watching as she shrank another couple of inches while her breasts decreased in size once more. Now she was only a child of 12.<br />
<br />
“Awww isn’t she cute,” Nancy sang, giggling at the young auburn haired girl. “The games not over yet Nancy,” Diana countered. “Let’s see how you feel when you get this young.”<br />
<br />
I smiled as I watched the girls playfully banter with one another. It amazed me how I had gone from the youngest in the room to the oldest in a little less than an hour. Gazing down at my cards I noticed it wasn’t the greatest hand in the world but it was playable. Thankfully the wish I had made kept my chip count from dropping below 20. While I had lost previous hands whenever I reached 20 chips or fewer I would win the hand. Looking my chips over I could see that my chip total was currently quite high. I could afford to bet carelessly but should I? I needed to be careful, chances were that the others may beat me since I was in no danger of dropping below 20 chips. Still, I had come this far and made them this young, why not take it a bit farther. Smiling at the girls I decided to...</p>
