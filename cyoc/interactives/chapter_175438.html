<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A year had passed, and the human race was no more. The rate of spread was too fast for anyone to do anything effective about it and when the government caught wind of the situation they had been infiltrated and infected already. At first look the human race had been divided in several species, but they didn&#39;t see it like that. Despite looking very different, and at first having some people wanting a level of segregation, the discoveries that came over the next few months united all.<br />
The first of those discoveries was that the species all could still mate. Despite some turning into amphibians, birds and reptiles, all newly turned people kept a penis and vagina, no cloaca in sight. Despite some, like equines having larger penis than average, their holes were surprisingly elastic. Besides all species found the others attractive to an extend. Some people preferred mammals, or reptiles but there were no ugly species on their minds.<br />
The second discovery was the fact all species could have offspring with each other. The mechanics were full of rules and exceptions but in general all mammals can have offspring together, it being one of the parents species or the other&#39;s, decided at random. If the female lays eggs, then the offspring is always the mother&#39;s species and vice versa.<br />
Being that the case, all former humans identified first as anthros, not their specific species. Their high libidos cause the world to be a much more peaceful place, as they literally preferred to make love and not war. The world was not perfect, but it was on a better state overall.<br />
The Smith and White families had become very famous for being the first anthros and the one&#39;s responsible for everything in general. Princess in particular was almost considered a hero, as the original strain of the anthros super-virus was found in her body. Speaking of Princess she had given birth to her first foal a few months prior and was now pregnant again. Her mother had fathered the first one, but she was sure Jessica was the father, although the term was not quite right for either as Francine struggled a lot with being a father and ended up just being a second mother, even feeding her offspring on occasion. Jessica seemed to be following the same path. Many she-males struggled to keep both roles in their offspring life, some managed to be both, some became more fatherly and some motherly. Alice had also had her first young one at the same time and their other mother a month later.<br />
On the other side of the street, Lucy and Melody had had their first litter, which came up to six new puppies in total. Lucy&#39;s were Kate&#39;s and Melody&#39;s were her bother&#39;s, but the promised to switch it around for the next time. Kate was on of the she-males that manage to be both motherly and fatherly to her litter, although she was still &quot;mom&quot; to her fist two children, no matter how many times she plowed them both. Yes Alex did take that role some nights, although Kate preferred to be his bitch most times.<br />
Lucy was quite the celebrity for a while. Many people were worried that if all animals turned, food would become too scarce, as all anthros were still omnivores despite their looks. But soon it was found out she was a very unique case. She was infected with the original strain minutes before being exposed to the Anthro strain. The original strain only existed inside Vicky for a while, then only in a very secure lab. Despite being immune to it, the wanted to be careful as this virus was unpredictable. But what about Vicky?<br />
Well, she was still living at Princess&#39;s house. After scientists cured her of the original strain, she became very sick. It was said she would die if not turned into an Anthro. Princess was considering leaving her to her fate, but as much as she hated that woman, she was not as cruel as she was. Francine was left with the task to turn her, which she would prefer to say she didn&#39;t enjoy but this was the last transformation the world would ever see.<br />
Vicky had nearly lost herself in those ten moths as a mare, so she was not much of the same person when she was turned. It wasn&#39;t hard to convince the shadow of the caretaker to become a sort of maid for the family, although they kept a close eye on her. She was very content to serve, a trait she develop by being trained when she was a full mare. The old Vicky would try to come back for a few months, but the new Vicky would always keep her at bay, too afraid to loose everything again. Eventually, there was only the mare-maid of the Smith household left and after a few years of gaining their trust her first offspring by Francine.</p>
