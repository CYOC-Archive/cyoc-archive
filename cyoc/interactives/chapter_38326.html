<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The enemy of my enemy...<br />
<br />
The moon shined down on desert sands now covered with glass sculptures patches of <br />
reflective material, and deadly shards of the stuff that had shattered during he fight.  <br />
Alexandra was on the ground with her head down, surrounded by a circled quick fix <br />
barrier, the runes used was the language of angles.<br />
<br />
'I didn't think I knew how to create a barrier!' Janice thought as they dodged the snake <br />
sword Lucy had conjured out of the said. 'I don't think you did until we did it! I think your <br />
instinctively hardwired that part of your soul to mine that knew how to do it! Just be <br />
careful! That barrier is hardly shatter proof! It's mean to deflect shrapnel not direct attack-<br />
look out!' <br />
<br />
The snake blade twisted in their direction in mid-air even as they dodged it. <br />
<br />
'This is not good. Forgive me for saying this but we can't afford to burn off energy on her! <br />
Call the others! We can't tip our hand just yet! Like you said! They're expecting an army of <br />
djinn now not a small squad of angels! We need to use that to our advantage... here it <br />
comes again!' They twisted in midair, 'It's pointless to keep turning her creations to glass <br />
she just keeps making more, we to have do something a bit more drastic, or she'll just <br />
wear us down and hit us while we're down. Let's do it.' <br />
<br />
They blasted the sand snake sword into a mess of glass that fell downwards to the sandy <br />
ground. Lucy flew backwards and began to conjure a new weapon, Tabra/Janice then did a <br />
gamble and teleported behind her, and grabbed her from behind and began to pour <br />
intense head into her arms. <br />
<br />
Before Lucy's eyes... her hands... and arms... began to turn to glass, moving up from her <br />
wrists to her elbow and beyond that, &quot;King Tamthis!!!&quot; She screamed as the non-glass part <br />
of her exploded into sand and being drive on by a hot wind blew fled and didn't stop <br />
fleeing until it had returned to Karthis City. <br />
<br />
Alexandra slowly peaked out from under her head from when the awful battle had started, <br />
and shook her head at own ineffectiveness, what was she or her master thinking that she <br />
could help him? Then again, there was no one else. <br />
<br />
Janice/Tabra looked at it all, it was all dead glass, nothing more, that included the two <br />
arms in her hands... 'Let me guess, she'll have new ones by the time we see her again? <br />
Yep. Didn't think we'd be that lucky.' Still, just to be on the safe side, Tabra/Janice threw <br />
the glass arms as -far away- as possible, then blasted them to atoms. <br />
<br />
That settled, they floated down and touched the barrier around Alexandra, undoing it. &quot;It's <br />
alright, you're safe now.&quot; Janice and Tabra said.<br />
<br />
Alexandra looked up at them hopefully, &quot;Can you, are you, are you the leader of the djinn <br />
army Janice? Are you, an angel?&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice and Tabra replied, &quot;Yes, I'm an Angel, but I'm not the one leading the dijnn, I'm <br />
really not sure if it's a good idea for you to meet him or not.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I have to, it is the first time my master has -asked- me -personally- to carry out a <br />
command for me, I can't fail him.&quot; <br />
<br />
Janice and Tabra look out the crucifix from their they had created to replace the one they <br />
had given Vicki. It had been a much quicker and simpler task for an experienced <br />
messenger than for the others. Something about the little cross made Alexandra <br />
confused. <br />
<br />
&quot;What... what are you going to do with that? Where have I... where have I see that before? <br />
Janice? Why are you looking at me like that? No, Janice, please keep it away, it scars me...&quot;<br />
<br />
Tabra and Janice looked into Alexandra's eyes. They saw fear. Dread. Anxiety. She was <br />
scared.<br />
<br />
 They looked at her, -really- looked at her. <br />
<br />
'Janice. Yes? You don't know it, but your spirit and that of the others were all made into a <br />
uniform shape and structure when Karther made you his love dolls, you were all exactly <br />
the same on the inside. When I erased the template it caused your spirits all to snap back <br />
into place and realize the truth of things once Karther's blocks were gone keeping you <br />
from making choices he didn't want you to.  What are you saying? Alexandra's spirit it... I <br />
think it's actually grown -past- her template... she's evolved past it. She's integrated it <br />
directly into her own thoughts and actions. Her, this version of her, has become, is <br />
becoming a person. One way to know for sure.'<br />
<br />
&quot;Alexandra, tell me, if Karther asked you to kill him, no, -commanded- you to kill him, <br />
would you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can you even ask me that?! I could never! Would never! And I will never!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And if Karther commanded you to kill us, er, me? Not to defend him against us, or <br />
someone dear to you, but just to kill us, would you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alexandra visibly shook, &quot;I, I don't know, I, I really don't know, I'd beg him to reconsider, <br />
I'd have to know the reason he'd make such a request. No, Master Karther -would- not <br />
make that request!  He just couldn't!&quot; <br />
<br />
'She's not reading from a script.' Tabra thought. 'And she should have answered <br />
automatically yes to both those questions. 'Obey Karther without question' is supposed to <br />
be rule number one.' ' <br />
<br />
Tabra calmly put away the crucifix, 'Tabra? She was born due to mental rape, but erasing <br />
her now to bring back her original would be murder. I want to free her. And I don't think <br />
she's obeying Karther nearly as much because her programming is telling her to. In fact,' <br />
&quot;Alexandra, what is Karther like right now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alexandra hugged herself, &quot;It's awful, he just lays there in the royal bed chamber, always, <br />
rarely moving, always in that female body, he doesn't issue orders anymore, let alone <br />
decide any policies on how the city is run, it's like someone gutted his insides, and I'm sure <br />
Tamthis is the one, after what Master Karther told me. I didn't act before because Tamthis <br />
kept telling me, it was for his own good...I was a fool.&quot; <br />
<br />
'Well? She's on the brink. Less than a heart beat away, her thoughts just don't match up <br />
with what the template Karther gave her...not to mention that she should have handed you <br />
over the guards when you first met her... The way she's talking about Karther-didn't say <br />
she had good taste.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Alexandra, to go to the Angel whose head of the djinn army, that is your choice?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... All right then... now hold still, I promise, I am not going to hurt you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Karther said, Angels are very serious about their promises.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's right.&quot; <br />
<br />
Tabra/Janice looked her over, using their enhanced senses to ferret out any bugs or <br />
tracers that might have been on her or in her or hot wired into her. Finding no such wires, <br />
they did find something rather surprising, 'People like Karther always leave a trace of <br />
themselves behind when they transform someone, it was purged from you and the others <br />
when I freed you but... the traces of Karther that are in her, it's like they're branches of a <br />
tree whose roots have all died... like the source is just... gone... no, I don't think this has <br />
to do with her changes as a person but... something tells me Karther isn't going to be a <br />
bother to anyone ever again. Are you sure? No. It's just a feeling. If we tell Alexandra it'll <br />
kill her. No! I don't mean like a magical automatic booby trap.' <br />
<br />
 &quot;All right then, let's go.&quot; The angel vixen takes hold of Alexandra's hand and teleported <br />
herself and Alexandra away to the new location of the djinn camp. The djinn were not <br />
please to see their arrival since they weren't called here. They are even less pleased to see <br />
Alexandra. &quot;She is emissary and ambassador and you will not touch her!&quot; Janice shouted <br />
right in the djinn's face when they tried to get close her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Take me to the Angel leader of this djinn army, I need to speak with him.&quot; Alexandra said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What OF it?&quot; Says the smaller curt djinn who guided you through the camp before.<br />
<br />
&quot;TAKE ME to the Angel Leader of this djinn army! I need to speak with him! That is all!&quot; <br />
Alexandra said more sternly this time. <br />
<br />
&quot;Take US to the angel leader of this dijinn army!&quot; Janice snapped. &quot;She is emissary and <br />
ambassador and and wishes to speak with Jasim, that is enough!&quot; <br />
<br />
Neither angel nor djinn is going to budge on this, but it doesn't matter as in a moment <br />
Jasim himself appears. &quot;What is this? T! Why do you bring that thing into my camp after <br />
blowing your horn about us doing the same? You hypocritical idiot. Now we need to move <br />
the camp -again-, I'll just undo the enslavement on her and-&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice stepped between Alexandra and Jasim, &quot;You aren't so much as going to -touch- <br />
her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually,&quot; Tabra said, &quot;Janice has been doing the speaking and acting since we got here <br />
I've been along just for the ride.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jasim was flabbergasted. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you the angel leader of this djinn army?&quot; Alexandra asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes he is.&quot; Janice said not sure of Jasim would be willing to answer or not. <br />
<br />
&quot;Master Karther comes to offer you a bargain,&quot; Alexandra said taking a step closer to the <br />
taller angel in her presence, &quot;I offer you a quick, effective, safe, and above all stealthy way <br />
into the heart of Karthis City! It is unknown to any within Karthis City but myself and <br />
Master Karther. All Master Karther asks for in return is that you spare both I, and himself, <br />
and return to him all the power stolen from by Tamthis.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jaism's eyes widened, &quot;NEVER!&quot; He said with the voice of doom, &quot;abu Haj, destroy the <br />
persona placed upon this one by Karther, and she shall give us all information she has and <br />
more willing! Karther is a fool.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I won't let you kill her!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;'She' is not alive! You stupid woman! She is a fake personality created by a perverted <br />
degenerate with too much power and authority in his immature hands!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;She is a sentient being with a heart and mind of her own! She's not just some robot you <br />
can just delete the OS of and put a more friendly one in it's place! And if you want her, <br />
you'll have to go through US first!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I always knew you were an idiot T.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And do you want to go THROUGH this idiot to get at Alexandra? How much do you think <br />
I'll be able to wear you down? I might even be able to send you packing back home if I'm <br />
lucky enough? How many of your djinn will I be able to take down with me? And what <br />
about my 'rogue unit of violations of tradition?' You have no clue which safe house they're <br />
in. And you might have find this hard to believe, but they'll fight on their own anyway, and <br />
likely against you too to avenge Janice... so let me ask you... is it -really- worth it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Silence, dead silence, tension so thick a knife could cut it, finally, Jasim shouted. <br />
<br />
&quot;Be gone!&quot; <br />
<br />
The angel vixen is more than happy to comply, taking Alexandra with her. <br />
<br />
A few minutes later at the safe house, &quot;I've failed... I failed him... he trusted me, and I <br />
failed him.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You haven't failed him yet!&quot; Janice shouted, &quot;Just tell US the information you wanted to <br />
bargain with Jasim and we can fulfill the details of the bargain! We'll...&quot; She hated beyond <br />
words saying this, &quot;We'll save him.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I can't.&quot; Alexandra explained sadly, &quot;I was to bargain for that information with the angel <br />
leader of the djinn only... and only him... Master Karther was very clear on that, he didn't <br />
trust me to give to anyone else on any other condition. I'd be breaking his trust, and his <br />
faith in me if I gave it to you. I won't do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tabra/Janice fall backwards, sitting on the sadly ground, tiredness of the battle finally <br />
sinking in, &quot;You'd make a good angel.&quot; Their body's ears perked, &quot;If you can't tell us about <br />
the sure fire way into the city, then can you tell us everything -else- you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh?&quot; Alexandra asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Tabra/Janice said, &quot;Just what I said, you're bound by your duty not to tell us about <br />
your secret entrance of whatever, but that duty doesn't including not telling us about the -<br />
rest- of the city and those inside right? You were right next to Karther all this time I'll bet, <br />
and thus you were by default almost always next to Tamthis!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes I was.&quot; Alexandra nodded.<br />
<br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jasim.&quot; Said Tabra/Janice teleporting right into the djinn camp, sounding more casual <br />
and more confident than the Muslim had ever heard the Nazarene be, it sickened him. <br />
<br />
&quot;You dare show your face here again Nazarene?&quot; Jasim said darkly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. Because I'm offering you, a chance to get into the inside of Karthis City as part of my <br />
group's mission to end this without a full scale invasion.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;How could you possibly be able to do that! And where did the delusion come from that I'd <br />
ever be along side you in a mission designated as 'yours?' &quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;One.&quot; Tabra/Janice counted off their fingers, &quot;We got a truck load of information out of <br />
Alexandra that your prisoners didn't have since Alexandra is a lot closer to the enemy's <br />
command.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you erased that fake persona yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We asked politely. And two, I, that is Tabra, knows for a fact that there's no way on <br />
Heaven and Earth that you'll pass up a chance to have a front row seat to seeing us -fail-. <br />
And three, I, that is Tabra, won't likely exist anymore once this mission is over and done <br />
with, so this will be your only chance to see it. And four, do you really want to risk that <br />
some of your faithful may be killed in the full scale invasion of Karthis City?&quot; <br />
<br />
That silence again. Finally Jasim said,  &quot;abu Haj, if I do not return from this fool's mission <br />
with these fools, you have my full permission to ERASE that city off the face of the planet. <br />
-Destroy- Karther and his entourage.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;With pleasure O' Jasim!&quot; The mighty genie nodded. <br />
<br />
The two angels teleported away. <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;And the wolfens always patrol in pairs, but a third one always trails behind in case there's <br />
trouble to sound an alarm or provide a surprise attack. The citizens follow the same <br />
pattern each day with little variation. Natalie always stays close to the main palace, she <br />
won't sorte unless she's been told there's a threat. Security is actually tightest along the <br />
other rim of the city, they figure anyone who gets in close enough to Tamthis will learn <br />
why Tamthis is in charge soon enough. Jennifer is -always- with Master Karther, always. <br />
Roberta isn't robotic like Jennifer, she's always been made into a she wolf unlike Jen' <br />
whose still a vixen. She's the second most autonomous. She spends most of her time <br />
between the walls and the main palace. Lucy has no real schedule, she's pure skunk <br />
works, she'll somethings bit on the walls of the outer city making use of her senses, but <br />
not always, she could just as well be in the main palace. If she's hurt she can use sand to <br />
create a new flesh and blood limb. I don't know if that'll work on a beheading or not. She <br />
can animate sand as easily as... as easily as Queen Tammia was before she became <br />
Tamthis. I don't know the limits are on her ability to use the sand as a medium to teleport <br />
her awareness, but her senses don't seem to cover the whole city I think, otherwise she <br />
wouldn't have to move herself along as the day goes by. Tamthis never leaves the palace, <br />
and Karther never leaves the royal chambers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alexandra repeated everything she had told Tabra/Janice to the younger angels. All four of <br />
them listened intently. After all, this was what all their sacrifices had been leading up after <br />
all. Vicki made note of everything she could, while Erica and Lisa pressed for details about <br />
their transmuted siblings and ways they might be disabled via non-leathal force. Luna just <br />
stayed silent, absorbing everything she heard. <br />
<br />
As per Tabra's warnings, and not needing to be told twice, Julio had created and sealed <br />
himself behind a barrier using a combination of Tabra's talents and his own reality hacking <br />
skills. Julio was to leave after a set time, or when Tabra gave him an very very precise 'all's <br />
clear' signal, whichever happened first. Julio had no desire to interact with Jasim, given the <br />
last time they had met Julio had barely escaped with his head. <br />
<br />
As for the kitesune, Akira and Keiko had no desire to hide from the muslim messenger. <br />
And if Jasim was to be part of their plan, then they'd need to interact with him one way or <br />
another. Needless to say the angels were surprised but pleased to see their siblings back <br />
so soon, but the kitesune themselves were casual about it, but underneath just as happy. <br />
<br />
When the two angels teleported in, Jasim didn't even look them in the eyes. He however <br />
did look at Janice/Tabra and say, &quot;Still kitesune?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Foxes, and I didn't chose this form, this is how the angelic essence interacted with their <br />
material forms when it became their souls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what's wrong with having fur and a tail or three?&quot; Asked Akira popping up on Jasim <br />
shoulder who instantly brushed him away hard. Jasim quickly drew his weapons, <br />
&quot;Invasion!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean-HEY! Do I LOOK like a Fennec like kitesune to you?! I'm Japanese!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;There are -other- former victims of Karther Jasim.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Then how did they become-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I gave them the CHOICE to, just as I gave others the choice to just go home! As some DID! <br />
And I hope they never have to hear a word of these events beyond the safety of those they <br />
care about!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I'll have you know I LIKE being this way, and it feels like a 'like' with a lot more <br />
substance than the 'like' when I liked being Karther's blow up doll.&quot; Keiko says. &quot;So you're <br />
Jasim? You look impressive...&quot; Keiko said nothing more on that. <br />
<br />
&quot;Tabra! How do you know those you have... customized to their wishes won't turn on us in <br />
favor of their new kind?!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;HEY!&quot; Akira and Keiko said together.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd never stab my sisters in the back!&quot; Keiko snarled.<br />
<br />
Akira continued, &quot;Yip! And Karther is causing, er, sorry Alexandra, ahem, TAMTHIS, is <br />
causing way too much bad press for kitesune right now! I figured this would help us from <br />
being seen as down right evil if we helped clean up the mess our cousins are causing.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Just save your -games- for after everything is said and done and don't treat this as one of <br />
your games kitesune.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not... my games are a lot more fun than this!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;As are mine!&quot; Keiko stood tall on her four feet spreading her tails out in an almost <br />
patriotic fashion. <br />
<br />
&quot;So do we have everything worked out?&quot; Janice/Tabra asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;You bet!&quot; Aikra yipped. &quot;Don't worry. I know we need a performance right now and not a <br />
game.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keiko barked, &quot;If we're perfectly lucky, we will all be inside Tamthis' throne together by the <br />
time the more screwed in the head foxes realize what's up, if we're all perfectly UN-lucky, <br />
they'll realize what's up by the time they've let it through right past the front gate! Either <br />
way, we'll have a free ticket in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just be careful, Tammie, Tamthis, will have proofed the place against any form of <br />
teleportation except her, his own. Thankfully most of his, her converted aren't powerful <br />
enough magic users or what not to do so. With luck, only Lucy and Tamthis herself himself <br />
should be able to pull them off. Above everything else, whatever happens, until our cover <br />
is blown, DO NOT SPLIT UP! EVER! Separated we're dead meat! We are NOT having a repeat <br />
of what happened when we fled Karther's castle! The minions and grunts shouldn't be able <br />
to transform or posse you now, you're a level of reality above them, and Tamthis himself <br />
can't do simple 'zap and go' on you now.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me, no, excuse you,&quot; Jasim said reminding the angels and kitesune he was there. <br />
&quot;How precisely do you intend to enter Karther's city without setting off every alarm and <br />
guard?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alexandra inched away from Jasim, he was easily the largest Angel in the room. <br />
<br />
&quot;Simple.&quot; Said Akira, &quot;You're all going in through the front door!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't think normal kitesune were -that- mad.&quot; Jasim said simply. <br />
<br />
&quot;We're crazy like foxes what did you expect? Serious! We've got a fool proof method for <br />
getting in!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that is?&quot; Jasim asked drolly. <br />
<br />
&quot;THIS!&quot; A leaf landed on Jasim's head. In a puff of smoke where Jasim had been, there was <br />
another angel vixen in the room. Dressed in a shawl. Jasim stared at himself, herself, in <br />
dead shock.<br />
<br />
Akira didn't notice or pretended not to and walked around him, her. &quot;Since our magic is so <br />
close to the magic Tamthis uses, he'd have to inspect you personally to realize you're not <br />
one of his, even if he tried to sense you through one of his other creations it wouldn't do <br />
the trick to see through this trick! There's even a bogus 'censor reading' as it were if he <br />
tries to sense through you, don't worry, he won't be able to use it to locate you, it's just <br />
there as an emergency delaying tactic if he's tries to sense you through one of his victims, <br />
but seriously, with the war effort going on, and with them on the look out for an army, <br />
they won't be expecting a small group and he's not likely to be 'homing in' on you anyway. <br />
Now Tamthis we're told sent out some of his loyalists to tell some of the surrounding <br />
villages according to Alexandra 'Yo! The original land lord is in control of this region <br />
again. New dress code includes fur and tails.' And a couple have been rushing to into the <br />
city from protection of the dijinn, which to be frank, don't have that good a rep in the <br />
middle east anyway...you SHOULD be able to sneak in as those... and as long as none of <br />
you are carrying lamps, bottles, or large gems that glow like a blood ruby, you should get <br />
in through with minimum inspection and without drawing Tamthis' attention. Again, since <br />
our magics are so alike, we'll be like a white rabbit during a snow storm to him, though <br />
he'll be like a brown rabbit in a snow storm to us, don't ask how that works, it's kitesune <br />
magic, the finer points aren't -suppposed- to make sense.&quot; <br />
<br />
As Akira went on and on and on and on, Jasim finally found his voice, &quot;You.... you made <br />
me into a ... this a..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fox?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A WOMAN!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You've been female before Jasim...&quot; Tabra cooly pointed out. <br />
<br />
&quot;I like to be informed ahed of time and by my own decision!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You agreed to be a part of this, which means we play by our, my, rules.&quot; Janice and Tabra <br />
shook their head. &quot;Yeah, I know, we should. I know, we have until midnight tomorrow to <br />
save them. Alexandra, you know by instinct the current shape of the city and the quickly <br />
way into the palace without being spotted by anyone who'd suspect us, you'll have to <br />
guide us.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Alexandra nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;You trust, her? One of -his- creations?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I trust my friend, to help me save another friend.&quot; Janice breathed in deep. <br />
<br />
&quot;Janice, Tabra...&quot; Vicki asked, &quot;We were told, we know about that 'emergency training' <br />
you're worried about giving us and... we voted, and it's unanimous. We're not scared <br />
anymore, we chose to accept it.&quot;<br />
<br />
'Tabra... you know what we have to do after them... I know Janice... are you scared? Out of <br />
my head, you? Exactly the same, but, you're right, I don't want to see your, -our- sisters <br />
die either. Any of them. You thought of a name? Let her decide that.'</p>
