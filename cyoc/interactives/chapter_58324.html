<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You see, Juliet,&quot; I explained.  &quot;Carrie and I have decided that some <br />
changes need to happen to this sorority, and there are some changes <br />
that we want to make to this sorority.&quot;<br />
<br />
Juliet looked confused.  &quot;You don't live here.  What are you allowed <br />
to do?&quot; she protested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it's a bit of a long story,&quot; I said.  &quot;So to make it quick, <br />
I'll just tell you that I have this ring that grants any wish I <br />
desire.&quot;  I showed the ring to her.  &quot;So far it's done some pretty <br />
incredible things.&quot;<br />
<br />
Juliet looked at Carrie.  &quot;Is he joking?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
Carrie smiled knowingly.  &quot;Not at all,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Suppose I don't believe you two,&quot; she said.  She folded her arms in <br />
front of her while the look on her face became resolute.  I took this <br />
as a challenge.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, then,&quot; I said.  &quot;I wish you hair was blonde.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Instantly her hair lightened and became a perfect blonde.  &quot;Ha, ha, <br />
ha, very funny,&quot; Juliet said, ignorant of the change.  &quot;As if.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carrie laughed.  &quot;Take a look in the mirror,&quot; she said as she pointed <br />
to a full length mirror in the corner of the room.<br />
<br />
Juliet turned and promptly did a double take.  Her eyes went wide as <br />
saucers as she stood up and stumbled over to the mirror.  She ran her <br />
hands through her hair to prove to herself that the hair was still <br />
hers.  &quot;This can't be real,&quot; she said.  &quot;I must be dreaming.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, come now, you know you're not,&quot; I said.  <br />
<br />
She turned around and looked at me again.  &quot;Change it back, then!&quot; she <br />
demanded.  &quot;I like my hair color.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well,&quot; I agreed and obliged her wish.  Her hair color returned <br />
to its normal shade instantly.  <br />
<br />
She sat down on the couch again.  &quot;OK, you can wish for things,&quot; she <br />
conceded.  &quot;What about this sorority are you going to wish for?&quot;<br />
<br />
Carrie took the lead on this question.  &quot;First of all, we're going to <br />
make it so that I am elected head of the house.  I know that will make <br />
you happy.  Beyond that, we're going to turn this sorority into much <br />
more than that,&quot; she said.  This brought a smile to my face as it told <br />
me that she agreed to my idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;What will that be?&quot; Juliet asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it will be easier if I show you,&quot; Carrie said as she untied <br />
the strap on her robe.<br />
<br />
I had to think fast to prevent a possible unwanted outcome.  &quot;But I <br />
wish that you'll remain calm no matter what you see,&quot; I blurted out.<br />
<br />
Carrie looked at me and said, &quot;Yea, good idea.&quot;  Before Juliet could <br />
ask another question, Carrie dropped her robe and stood naked before <br />
her, with her cock proudly dangling between her legs.<br />
<br />
Juliet's eyes were instantly drawn to the unnatural feature of <br />
Carrie's body.  She looked as if she wanted to scream as her mouth <br />
opened wide.  I assumed that my wish prevented that from happening.  <br />
&quot;You're a he?&quot; Juliet asked as loudly as my wish allowed.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, no,&quot; Carrie answered.  &quot;This was the result of a wish that <br />
Joe made.  I've always fantasized about having a penis, so Joe made it <br />
happen.&quot;  Juliet just kept staring at the cock.  &quot;Now that I have my <br />
fantasy, I want to be able to use it.  So Joe and I are going to make <br />
the sorority into a special kind of brothel.  One full of extremely <br />
attractive girls who happen to have penises.&quot;<br />
<br />
Juliet looked even more shocked.  Perhaps it was Carrie's rather <br />
sudden, nonchalant description of my idea, or just the general shock <br />
of the moment, but she remained silent for several moments.  Her eyes <br />
never left Carrie's cock.  I started to think this might have been the <br />
first one she had seen in person.<br />
<br />
Carrie broke the prolonged silence.  &quot;It's something else, isn't it?&quot; <br />
she asked.  &quot;To have this kind of body and to top it off with <br />
something so unique.  To have the best parts of both sexes.  To be <br />
something special.  It's alluring and sexy and dangerous and powerful <br />
all at once.  It's more than I could have ever fantasized,&quot; she <br />
concluded.<br />
<br />
I had to admire her sales job.  I felt that she believed everything <br />
she said, but I also felt she said it more so to get Juliet to believe <br />
this was a good thing.  Her words attempted to convince Juliet that <br />
she should want the same thing.<br />
<br />
Finally Juliet spoke again.  &quot;You're going to make all of us like <br />
that?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Carrie answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;What if we don't want it?  What if someone says 'no?'&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd rather not have it that way,&quot; I replied.  &quot;But, honestly, we're <br />
not going to take 'no' for an answer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean you can control people's thoughts?&quot; Juliet asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; I said.  &quot;I just made it so that you wouldn't scream or <br />
overreact, and I think you were about to do both.  Earlier today I <br />
wished for Carrie to be naked on the street and for no one to take <br />
notice.  Both wishes worked.&quot;<br />
<br />
Juliet picked up on the second part of my statement.  &quot;Is that why you <br />
gave Carrie her 'fantasy?'  You felt guilty about violating her?&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked down at my feet for a moment.  I'm not sure if that was a <br />
reflex or if I did it for effect.  &quot;Yes,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You weren't mad at him?&quot; Juliet asked Carrie.<br />
<br />
Carrie answered, &quot;No.  Without going into another story, I know that <br />
he learned his lesson.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is all fantastic,&quot; Juliet said.  &quot;I feel like I'm in the middle <br />
of...well I don't know what.  It's just so weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you need some time?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
She looked back and forth between me and Carrie's cock.  &quot;You know?  I <br />
want to be more assertive.  You want me to be more assertive.  So I <br />
will.  What I want right now is to touch it,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean my penis?&quot; Carrie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea,&quot; Juliet answered.  &quot;I want to know what the big deal is about <br />
it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carrie smiled and said, &quot;Be my guest.&quot;<br />
<br />
Juliet got off the bed and inched herself in front of Carrie.  She <br />
knelt on the ground in front of Carrie and gingerly placed her hand on <br />
Carrie's cock.  She touched it delicately with her fingers.  After a <br />
few seconds Carrie's cock showed the first signs of arousal.  A quick <br />
smile flashed on Juliet's face, one that showed amusement as opposed <br />
to pleasure.  She now stroked the hardening shaft and marveled at the <br />
sight of the cock growing more erect by the second.  After a few <br />
seconds of stroking the top of the shaft, she wrapped her hand around <br />
it and continued to stroke.  Carrie moaned slightly at this <br />
development.  She looked at me and motioned her eyes to the door.  <br />
<br />
I took this as a positive sign.  I stood up from the chair and walked <br />
to the door.  As I opened it and stepped outside I took a quick look <br />
over my shoulder.  I watched as Juliet's mouth engulfed Carrie's fully <br />
erect cock.  I quickly and quietly closed the door.  There would be no <br />
problems with Juliet, I thought.<br />
<br />
I walked down the hall with the intention of finding another of the <br />
house's occupants.</p>
