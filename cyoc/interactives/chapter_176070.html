<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brandon was getting into the video, watching as the woman on the screen was filled from both ends, though his eyes kept drifting between the two men. The woman was hot, no doubt, and worth jacking off to, but the men were just so much more...<br />
<br />
His phone rang. It was Jannes quickly he picked up then realized the porn video was still playing an no doubt the doctor would be able to hear the moans and groans coming through the line and quickly paused the video. If Jannes did hear anything he was smart enough not to mention it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where have you been?! I&#39;ve been trying to get a hold of you!&quot; Brandon practically shouted. &quot;This serum is doing some wacked out shit.&quot; His voice even sounded a little different to his ears, slightly deeper with a quality he couldn&#39;t quite place.<br />
<br />
&quot;At work. There&#39;s a no cellphone policy because of the work we do. Have you been..&quot;<br />
<br />
Brandon cut off Jannes. &quot;Writing shit down? Mostly. But.. I think your serum is fucked up.&quot; Why was he cussing so much? It was like he couldn&#39;t stop himself. He had trained himself to speak forcefully but without slang and slurs, it was required in the business world, but here he was spouting off cuss words without even thinking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down, I&#39;ll come over. Text me your address and I&#39;ll swing by on my way home.&quot; Jannes hung up but Brandon quickly sent him his address. He didn&#39;t know how long it&#39;d be until the doctor showed up and turned his attention back to the porn video. He hit play and started jacking off again, picking up where he left off with barely any issue.<br />
<br />
And all this time his physical changes had continued, his skin darkening even further. Even jerking off he barely registered that his pubes had gone from their normal looser curls to tighter ones that clung closer to his skin, or that the hair across his chest was following suit. A strange feeling did bring his eyes back down to his cock, where he noticed extra skin rolling up and down his cock as he jacked off, his foreskin had grown back.<br />
<br />
The two guys in the porno started making out with each other as the woman deep throated their cocks at the same time, and Brandon blew his load, adding more cum to the stains that were still on his floor from last night that he had neglected to clean. He was about to grab a towel to wipe up his mess when there was a buzz at his intercom. He walked over and hit the button.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Whyte?&quot; The doorman sounded unsure if he had the right apartment. &quot;There&#39;s a Dr. Jannes here to see you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah, uh, send him up.&quot; Brandon quickly wiped up his mess and went to pull on at least a pair of shorts. He didn&#39;t need Jannes ogling his cock. He stepped out of his bedroom just as there was a knock on the door and Brandon answered it. The doctor looked stunned, Brandon had to grab his shoulder to pull him inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, now tell me what the fuck your serum did!&quot; Brandon went to poor himself some wine, changed his mind and grabbed a beer. He wasn&#39;t even going to offer Jannes one, not until he got some answers anyway.<br />
<br />
&quot;What it was supposed to. Have you looked at yourself lately?&quot; Brandon frowned and headed into the bathroom, Jannes trailing him.<br />
<br />
The moment Brandon looked in the mirror he let out a, &quot;Holy fuck!&quot; Staring back at him was a young black man. When had his skin gotten so dark, and his hair curled so tightly to his head? He was huge and muscular, but was probably only in his twenties if the smooth face and taught skin over his muscles were anything to go by. He reached out and grabbed Jannes&#39; shirt in his fist, dragging him close. &quot;Fix it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jannes put up his hands. &quot;Careful, I&#39;m probably the only one that can.&quot; He sounded nervous, but the threat was clear. You damage me, you&#39;re stuck like this. &quot;The good news is my experiment worked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m younger but I&#39;m also not me!&quot; Brandon shouted at the top of his lungs.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not talking about the youth part, I knew that would work. I&#39;m talking about the other part. I figured out how to control the change to a degree.&quot; Jannes was grinning like a mad man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait. You did this?! On purpose?!&quot; Brandon could feel the urge to pummel the shit out of Jannes rising.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had a theory, I needed to see if it worked. See..&quot; Jannes stepped out of Brandon&#39;s reach. &quot;I couldn&#39;t figure out what was causing the changes, then I noticed there were some.. coincidences. People would get some random traits but often they had some similarity to people around them but not all the time. But it all come to a head when I had to use the serum to cure my husband, he had an organ transplant at some point and after the serum changed him he remarked he looked a lot like the kid he got the organ from. And then it clicked.&quot; Jannes was getting excited. Brandon was getting annoyed. He motioned the doctor to get on with it. Actually, there was something almost adorable about the slender doctor geeking out. If he wasn&#39;t so old..<br />
<br />
&quot;The serum is stupid. It fixes your genetics but it can&#39;t differentiate yours from any other random DNA it might have picked up through contact, or sex, or medical stuff.. even dust is mostly dead human skin cells. Just random bits of DNA floating in the air. The serum fixes it together as best as it can and repairs you to what it has.&quot; Jannes motioned to Brandon. &quot;In your case.. the DNA I added to the serum before giving it to you. I needed to have it be a drastic change to confirm my suspicions. You look a lot like the donor, not completely, but a relative, it mixed some of your own DNA in there but the more youthful DNA was more complete and useful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brandon punched the wall to avoid hitting the doctor. &quot;I didn&#39;t give you permission to experiment on me. Who the fuck did you even use?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jannes shrugged. &quot;Call it payback for high school. And that doesn&#39;t matter.&quot; He looked Brandon up and down with a somewhat lewd grin. &quot;It worked like a charm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you fix me?&quot; Brandon said through gritted teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not all the way. But I can make a serum, give it your old DNA a head of time to let it start acclimating to that, then it should restore most of your old features. Not all, but..&quot; Jannes shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jannes reached over to the bathroom counter and grabbed a hair brush, examining the few hairs tangled in the bristles. &quot;Have you used this since you took the serum?&quot; When Brandon shook his head, Jannes smiled. &quot;It&#39;ll do. It&#39;ll take a while to make up the serum, enjoy being.. you for the time being. I&#39;ll let you know when it&#39;s ready. You&#39;re probably also not done changing, keep recording.&quot; Jannes turned and walked out of the apartment without another word.<br />
<br />
All Brandon could do was fume, and he was feeling horny again. Damn youthful hormones. He needed to distract himself.. now.</p>
