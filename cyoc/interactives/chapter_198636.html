<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark was still holding onto Leira&#39;s straps as they embraced the winds. <br />
<br />
The dragoness seemed to be enjoying herself as her tail whipped around behind them. Her wings were flapping less now as she she was mostly just gliding around. <br />
<br />
Mark had never witnessed her being this happy before her transformation. He patted her on the back, eliciting a sigh of contentment as they flew over the skyline of the city. He saw people all over, some taking pictures as they passed by, others treating it as totally normal. <br />
<br />
Yep, there he was, riding on a dragon. <br />
<br />
It still all felt so surreal, like he could wake up anytime and discover that this had all been a dream. <br />
<br />
But it wasn&#39;t one, somehow! <br />
<br />
They continued gliding till Leira turned her head around. Her hair gracefully flowed with the wind. <br />
<br />
Their eyes made contact and both smiled. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, what do ya wanna do now, Master?&quot;<br />
<br />
He put a hand under his chin, thinking about it. They now had this incredible power and they would certainly use it, but on who? Mark didn&#39;t wanna use it on himself yet as he wasn&#39;t sure what he wanted to be and if it would even work on him. And if it did, how would the whole servitude and loyality stuff manifest on him? <br />
<br />
Would he suddenly start taking care of himself properly or something like that?<br />
<br />
So, another friend it would be.<br />
<br />
While Mark didn&#39;t like the idea of turning his friends into loyal servants he was trying to mentally justify continuing and he hoped that they would not mind. <br />
<br />
&#39;That wasn&#39;t me asking for more mental changes by the way!&#39;, he thought causing the TF-Pad to turn down the mental sliders again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s go meet Michael. He would complain about it forever if he wasn&#39;t among the first to be transformed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michael and Mark were a couple once but that didn&#39;t last that long. They usually didn&#39;t bring it up as they both found it ridiculously embarrassing in retrospect. Lars...Leira liked to tease them about it. <br />
<br />
Leira&#39;s eyes widened. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah! He would be pissed! We would never stop hearing about it! I am immediately heading to his home!&quot;<br />
<br />
If the straps on Leira&#39;s body were not there he would have been catapulted off of her as she took a sharp turn to the right. <br />
<br />
&quot;CHILL, LEIRA. YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE ME PASS OUT.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;SORRY!&quot; <br />
<br />
Leira honed in on Michael&#39;s home, slicing through the air before trying to land. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately she descended too fast, slamming into the sidewalk before the door. <br />
<br />
&quot;HOLY, SHIT. ARE YOU TWO FINE?&quot;, asked a young man who was passing by. <br />
<br />
The dragoness opened her eyes and lifted her head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just a little bruised, thanks for asking.&quot; <br />
<br />
The man rubbed the back of his head uncomfortably,&quot;If you says so...have a nice day I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right back at ya...Master, are you fine back there?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I feel like I just drove against a wall but I think I can go on.&quot; <br />
<br />
They both perked up as they heard the door opening, revealing Michael who looked at them with a mix of amusement and disappointment. <br />
<br />
&quot;You will never learn how to land properly, will you?&quot; <br />
<br />
Leira, immediately got up, flapping her wings to get the dust of. <br />
<br />
Mark disembarked and pulled his helmet off. <br />
<br />
&quot;... I guess she won&#39;t.&quot;, Mark answered, remembering that to Michael she has always been a dragon.<br />
<br />
This got a sigh from Michael. <br />
<br />
&quot; So, not like I dislike having you around, but is there any particular reason you have come here so suddenly? If you had told me in advance I would have made us some snacks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Leira gave him a smile. <br />
<br />
&quot;We just wanted to show you something and couldn&#39;t stop ourselves.&quot;, Leira answered mischievously, causing Michael to stare curiously. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, come in.&quot; <br />
<br />
The group went inside, Leira having to squeeze herself through the doorway. <br />
<br />
Michael gave off a comment about her eating too much and to her surprise he didn&#39;t back down when she gave him her angry dragon glare. <br />
<br />
She was actually impressed. <br />
<br />
They eventually got into his living-/bedroom hybrid where Leira stretched out on the fluffy carpet. <br />
<br />
Mark sat down on the couch, putting his riding helmet onto the table. <br />
<br />
Michael opened a bag of potato chips, putting it down for the group to enjoy. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, what do you have that is so interesting that Leira had to almost break her rips again as to arrive here fast enough?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Michael, remember that time we did a Pen-and-Papet one-shot where your character turned into a moth woman?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh!&quot;, Michael exclaimed,&quot;If you had told me we would be doing that again I would have gotten their spreadsheet from the unholy depths of my cellar.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We are not doing that. Say, would you wanna be your moth lady in real life?&quot;<br />
<br />
Michael froze, a bunch of expressions going across his face, ending in blushing embarrassment. <br />
<br />
&quot;...Maybe? Why? &quot;, Michael said, voice cracking. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure?&quot;, Mark asked. <br />
<br />
Michael nodded, hiding his eyes behind a hand. <br />
<br />
That was enough comfirmation for Mark to get the TF-Pad out of the bag on his back and start writing on it. <br />
<br />
&#39;Transform Michael into his moth woman OC, Michelle. Awareness ON, please.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...So,why did you ask su-!&quot;<br />
<br />
Michael stopped as his hand became segmented and hardened, turning a emerald green. <br />
<br />
He gasped as he looked at it. Shock soon turned into fascination as he saw the chtin spreading to his other hand and moving up his arm. The chitin was soon itself covered by fluffy fur of the same color. <br />
<br />
He stood up, staring in disbelief as Mark and Leira shared a smile. <br />
<br />
His nose and ears disappeared as their functions were replaced by his rapidly growing, emerald antennae. <br />
<br />
&quot;OH, God. They are so sensitive! Is this really happening?&quot;, he exclaimed. <br />
<br />
Mark nodded. <br />
<br />
Soon Michael&#39;s face became softer, rounder as his eyes became a pure black and a certain clump in his throat disappeared, leaving him with a deeper, femenine voice. <br />
<br />
His hair grew down to his shoulder blades, retaining its black color which only increased in its darkness. <br />
<br />
Michael&#39;s shoulders soon lost their broadness as his waist carved in and hips expanded, giving him a rather reasonable hourglass-figure. <br />
<br />
Two additional arms grew out below his main pair, tearing holes in the side of his shirt. <br />
<br />
Michael gasped in HER new feminine voice as her manhood retracted, becoming its female counterpart, testicles moving in deeper and turning into ovaries. <br />
<br />
Her legs became shapelier, longer as her thighs thickened, also being overwhelmed by emerald chitin and fur. <br />
<br />
A large bug abdomen growing in caused the end of her pants as they teared, leaving her nude from the hips down. <br />
<br />
She looked in disbelief at the her new lady parts, having no words. <br />
<br />
Her shirt was also soon ripped apart as she grew beautiful, black, membranous wings with emerald splotches along their lower, outer edge. <br />
<br />
Her toes merged into two claws per foot, tearing through her shoes with unnatural strength, completing Michael&#39;s transformation. <br />
<br />
She just stood there, at a complete loss for words. <br />
<br />
After a while she managed to get out,&quot;Did you do that?&quot; <br />
<br />
Both Mark and Leira nodded. <br />
<br />
Michael, or rather Michelle walked up to both of them and, to their surprise, kissed them both on the cheek before she took hold of Mark with all four of her hands and leaned into him. She embraced him, burying her face in his neck. Was she...crying?<br />
<br />
Leira and Mark shared an alarmed look which somewhat dissipated as, between quite sobs, Michelle said,&quot;Thank you, thank you, thank you...&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark was absolutely speechless, not having expected such a reaction. He put a hand on her back, scratching her on her shoulder blades where Mark knew she liked it back when they were together. It gave him a strange sense of nostalgia with her letting it all out in his arms while he tried to comfort her. Leira didn&#39;t even drop a joke about the two of them, she just looked, wide-eyed and with a bit of...was it envy? <br />
<br />
Michelle soon got off of him, wiping her tears. <br />
<br />
&quot;How.&quot;, she asked, causing the TF-Pad to appear in her vision to her surprise. <br />
<br />
&quot;...With this...It is the TF-Pad. It allows me...to transform people into anything I want. Got it from some sketchy website. It also passively changes reality while doing so.&quot;, Mark answered, still bewildered. <br />
<br />
A bunch of gears appeared to be turning in Michelle&#39;s head before she pointed towards Leira. <br />
<br />
&quot; Was she always a dragon?&quot;, Michelle asked quietly. <br />
<br />
The dragoness shook her head. <br />
<br />
The newly transformed moth woman just nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;... Again, thank you guys. There is nothing I ever wanted more than this.&quot;<br />
<br />
The dragon was also not spared from a tight hug. <br />
<br />
The moth looked around, noticing a picture of the three of them and the only other member of their friend group, a young man with red hair and a well trimmed beard. On it, she was a moth woman, as if she had always been this way. She also noticed her own semi-nudity in the picture, with her privates covered by strategically combed fur. She was surprised that she didn&#39;t feel embarrassed about the thought of going around like this att all. <br />
<br />
&quot;What now?, she asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want to fly along with Leira and me?&quot; <br />
<br />
Michelle almost started crying again, &quot;That&#39;s everything I want.&quot;<br />
<br />
They opened the door and to their surprise they were in...Mark and Leira&#39;s home? <br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;, they said at the same time, exact to the millisecond. <br />
<br />
They looked around. It was their apartment, but it had gotten larger, Michelle&#39;s room and another storage room added onto it. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think your house was merged into ours by the TF-Pad&#39;s reality alteration powers.&quot;, Leira answered. <br />
<br />
Michelle put a hand below her chin. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thats okay, I guess. I would not mind living with the two of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine then, but does that mean this will happen every time we transform somebody?, Mark thought out loud. <br />
<br />
A beep was heard from the pad which displayed a message:<br />
<br />
&quot;Friends of yours will have their houses be added onto yours. <br />
<br />
This action can be extended onto all transformed people if you so desire. <br />
<br />
As that is a minor, active alteration to reality that, while treading the line, is still within legal limits. <br />
<br />
  - Godcorp Department of Costumer Satisfaction&quot;<br />
<br />
Michelle stared at it inquisitively. <br />
<br />
&quot;Does that thing always listen?&quot;, she asked. <br />
<br />
Mark shrugged,&quot;I think so.&quot;<br />
<br />
They walked to the door and as they left the people of the surrounding apartments once again sighed as the dragon walked through the narrow corridors of the now even larger building. <br />
<br />
They soon reached the main entrance, leaving. <br />
<br />
The group got onto a thin strip of grass before the building. <br />
<br />
&quot;What now?&quot;,Michelle asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Flap your wings. Fly.&quot;,Mark answered encouragingly with his thumbs up. Leira also tried to do that but it looked rather funny with her claws and all. <br />
The moth spread her wings, flapping them faster and faster. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wo-ah!&quot;,she stuttered as she slowly lifted of a few centimeters of the ground. She soon got the hang of it as she ascended a few meters in the air, staying perfectly still before slowly flying around with her wings flapping faster than the eye could see. A few, easy maneuvers were flown by here before she landed in front of them again.<br />
<br />
She took both of them in a tight hug, smiling. <br />
<br />
They were really starting to get a bit overwhelmed by her thankfulness.</p>
