<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You have selected &quot;The Jungle&quot; for your first selection.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt wasn't what was about to happen, but the chair retracted into the floor and the projector vanished into <br />
the wall, and the circular room began to emit some strange lights, he lost his balance, as if something was <br />
pushing him, as if the whole room was spinning unto itself. A warm feeling, followed by a tickling sensation <br />
overwhelmed his body. Soon he felt how he started to feel weaker. His hair began to grow until it reached past <br />
his shoulders, by the lights he couldn't tell but his skin was tanning. He didn't notice much of these changes <br />
until while trying to get up he caught a look at his cock. It was slowly regressing to the little nub he used <br />
to have while  his pubes and other body hair fell off him.<br />
<br />
The lights went off. And a door opened leading to the exit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Step into the jungle. The room will begin electric shock routine in about 30 seconds&quot;<br />
<br />
He was still dizzy from the ordeal, and walking like that was something totally new to him. He tried to stand <br />
up but he fell again. Soon the thirty seconds passed an the electric shocks started. They were painful but it <br />
was hard to stand. Each time the shocks worsen getting longer and stronger, in his desperation he crawled of <br />
the room and land on a dirt ground. He looked back just to see the door closing and the room descending into <br />
the ground. <br />
<br />
He crawled a little more into a nearby pond, with a tree next to it. Using the tree as a support he stood and <br />
saw his reflection on the clear waters. He was a boy again, a 7-year-old or maybe younger, it was hard to tell <br />
since he had never let his hair grow that long. He looked around, The place was huge it looked like a forest <br />
rather than a jungle, he wondered if they left him go into the wilderness. He must be.<br />
<br />
&quot;So this is what happened to Jack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As if...&quot; said a voice coming from the bushes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jack was found doing a scandal on Sunday, and they regress him as punishment.&quot; From there a 11-year-old, <br />
bronze tan and athletic built, dark haired boy came out. Wearing only a leaf as his garment. &quot;Man, they really <br />
regress you, I haven't... oh I see you are the new one. Hey, how about you become my bitch?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your name is Matt right? Yes you were all over the news. I'm Tony. So would you become my bitch?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NO! I'm no one bitch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah right.&quot; The tan boy approach young Matt with the intension of tackling him. Matt saw the intention and <br />
tried to run but his legs gave up on him and was tackled by the other boy. Soon both were rolling in the dirt <br />
and fell on the pond.<br />
<br />
Matt passed from angry to scared since he didn't knew how to swim, or even if he knew his legs would must <br />
likely wouldn't work. But fortunately for him the other boy grab him by the arm and help him to shore. Then he <br />
tried to dash off his savior, but again was capture, and this time he grab him in a lock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say that your are going to be my bitch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nough..&quot; he resisted<br />
<br />
&quot;Say that your are going to be my bitch.&quot; grabbing him stronger.<br />
<br />
&quot;ghghg...&quot; he tried his best but...<br />
<br />
&quot;Say that your are going to be my bitch.&quot; grappling him in a even strongly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!!!&quot; cried finally to be released from that pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good&quot; He said as he left him go. Matt was breathing deeply, as he was almost choke.<br />
<br />
&quot;You see is for the best. The Jungle is a dangerous place for a rookie like you. But I won't take your word <br />
for it. I wan't to see if you are bitch material. Kiss my feet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt was prideful, but he knew when he was defeated. He though that in his normal-self he could have easily <br />
defeated him, he wasn't nearly the good wrestler Jack was. But in his diminished self he complied. He knell <br />
over and kiss his toes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, now kiss my dick.&quot; An in one movement he took of his leaf revealing a 3 inch cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;What no!&quot; and he was slapped across the face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah. ah. ah. That's not a good bitch, now lean over and kiss it. And try anything funny.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt did as it was told and nearly barf afterward. He felt disgusted and dirty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that's a good bitch. But, we don't have time to play, we need to get you refuge from the sun. Since this <br />
is your first time they also darkened your skin color to help you but even like that you must be careful. <br />
Follow me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony helped Matt get on his feet. &quot;You would get used to soon. The first times are always the hard ones.&quot; and <br />
help him into the woods.<br />
<br />
<br />
Walking through the forest, Tony instructed Matt to collect food. Matt was told that while in the Jungle the <br />
inmates are to fend for themselves, that includes meals and what-not. Tony actually lead him to a rock <br />
formation that created something like a cave. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is one of the spots that I use while in the Jungle. We can eat here.&quot;<br />
<br />
They sat down eating the berries.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how long have you been here?&quot; asked Matt.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the Jungle or as an inmate? Ten years. You can tell because I'm in my twelve-year-old body. So I'm <br />
actually in my late forties&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I'm little more than a toddler because I'm younger?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are the youngest in all Thornback, which in the Jungle is especially dangerous.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really, why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because of the Lost... shh! come with me, do you know how to climb trees.&quot; Matt nodded. &quot;Good now keep quite&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt followed into a nearby tree up to the up-most branches. And instruct him to keep him concealed but and to <br />
look down. He saw a boy running, or rather fleeing from a bunch of young teens. All of them with bright red <br />
hair down to their shoulders, grayish-brown skins and white markings across their eyes and chests. All were <br />
nude but unlike Matt, Tony or the pursued kid they sported tepid bright-red pubes above their dicks. When they <br />
got to tackle him, they piled over him and tied him with vines. Soon they carry him like hunters that have <br />
caught their prey. <br />
<br />
Matt was perplex by the scene, when he felt a sudden move on the branch, he turned around and saw a very hairy <br />
young man sitted next to him. He was going to yell if not by the quick action of Tony.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep quiet, unless you want to end up like that guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt understood, but felt even more disgusted when the man started to abuse himself right next to him. He saw <br />
rubbing his every-time enlarging member, wishing desperately the savages to leave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now is safe, we can climb down.&quot;<br />
<br />
For Matt it wasn't a second to soon. Now down he wanted to get away from that tree as soon as possible. But <br />
when he returned to the rock-cave, another monkey-man was feasting on the berries they left over.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry they're harmless.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are does? and why would Thornback send us into a cannibals land?&quot; asked Matt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, first we call these guys Man-keys. They're rather harmless and coward, unless you try to take them food <br />
away. I don't recommend that.&quot; said giving a gentle kick to the would-be-beast that finished eating the <br />
berries, scampering away.<br />
<br />
&quot;And those were the Lost Boys. They regress us to about 9-10 years old. They on the other hand are around 13-<br />
14 years old. And always travel in pack. And they won't eat the poor sap they caught, but he will be forced to <br />
satisfy them until his shift here is due.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmp. Being a Lost Boy doesn't sound that bad, what do I need to do to be one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not nearly as fun I can warranty you that. Those two are the fates of the Lifetime inmates in the Jungle <br />
here at Thornback. Both are regressed to a primitive state of mind. But the Man-keys are cowards creature who <br />
are always persecuted by the LB's. And they in turn hunt us because they have a crazed sex drive, that they <br />
are unable to relieve between them or the Man-keys, so they're in an almost perpetual case of blue balls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn... those poor bastards. Wait here in Thornback?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The sky looks pretty real, right? We're in one of the underground Sections. If you walk in a straight line <br />
you'll hit a wall. But those are often guarded by LB's so don't go near them&quot;<br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
The rest of the day he spend escaping from the marauding Lost Boys, until a capsule big enough for one person <br />
emerged from the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your ticket out, mine is still a few hours more. You better take it if you don't want top earn a punishment.&quot; <br />
Almost kicking Matt into the pod, he felt the now familiar sensation of dizziness.<br />
<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
Back in his cell, he noticed that Jack wasn't there yet. Probably for the best since now he was the puny <br />
child, he decided to rest on his litter wondering what his next day would be like in...<br />
<br />
