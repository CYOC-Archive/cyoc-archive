<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Though Luke was not the most athletic type person, he did enjoy playing basketball when he could find a group of boys who’d let him play with them. Having a bit higher regard for his basketball playing abilities than he should have, he had tried out for his school’s boys’ basketball team. His miserable failure to make the team haunted him since most of the boys regularly ridiculed him for his lousy tryout. Of course, they had been mocking him for most of his school life due to him being so smart so this just added insult to injury. The biggest game of the year was on the following friday afternoon and so many people had turned up to watch that the game had been moved to the outdoor court. Before the game started, Luke found exactly what he needed. Making sure no one was watching, he added just enough serum to the large container that held the team’s drink. He hid the serum inside a regular opaque water canteen. Deciding to be fair, if one can call it that, he added the same serum to the opposing team’s drink container. Then, he returned to his seat and waited.<br />
<br />
Both teams took to the field and the game began. Luke watched the boys take liberal amounts of the sport drink as the game progressed on this very warm afternoon. The slight smile on his face slowly increased turning into a huge grin when he noticed the time. Play had stopped for a moment and Luke counted down. The referee signaled to restart play when the audience let out a large gasp. All the boys on Luke’s school’s basketball team were suddenly and inexplicably stark naked. And though the boys sitting on the bench were certainly embarrassed at their present unclothed state, it was nothing compared to the boys out on the field who were unwillingly presenting their bare bodies to everyone. This was even worse for the poor lad holding the ball over his head for the throw-in restart. He unwillingly left nothing to the imagination regarding his anatomy.<br />
<br />
Luke smiled immensely watching his tormentors humiliated out there. The clever lad had modified the serum to actually make the uniforms completly vanish and not to simply turn see-through. These boys were stark naked out here for all to see. The very red-faced boys on the court finally overcame their initial shock at their unwilling free-show and went into action. They bent part way down while quickly covering their private parts in an attempt to protect whatever dignity they may still have. It didn’t help much as they realized they were still providing unobstructed views of their bare butts either to their own parents and supporters or to their opponents’ parents and supporters depending on which way they were facing. The other teams’ players, upon regaining some composure after the original surprise of seeing their opponents’ soccer outfits disappear, roared with laughter. Several were rolling on the ground clutching their sides from the hilarity of the situation. Luke’s grin could hardly expand more, but he managed it. He knew there’d be a delay in the results for the other team, but it wouldn’t be much longer. In fact, looking at the time, it should be just about…now.<br />
<br />
As if on cue, the other team’s boys stopped laughing simultaneously. They had the amazing ability to have their faces suddenly match perfectly the horror on those of the currently naked boys precisely because they, too, were now completly naked. Their hands also quickly moved to try to provide some cover for their exposed parts while reluctantly allowing everyone to still see their bare butts. The audience could only laugh more at all the naked boys. While they had no idea how all these boys’ clothes could be vanishing like this, they couldn’t deny finding humor in the boys’ naked predicament especially watching them scrambled to cover themselves as best as they could. And, of course, the siblings who’d been reluctantly dragged along to watch their brothers play were now thrilled to have come. The boys’ sisters were especially amused at not only seeing their brothers humiliated but they also got to see some very cute athletic boys in just their birthday suits. A mighty cheer rose up from both sides as a crowd of naked, embarrassed, red-faced boys ran for cover, their bare butts providing a lot of amusement. <br />
<br />
Luke almost allowed himself to laugh. The boys would never know who’d perpetrated their embarrassing situation which Luke knew was good as he probably would not survive whatever they would do to him in retaliation. He watched the last bare butt disappear in the distance. He could hear the people still laughing and commenting on what had just happened. Much confusion ensued as officials and others tried to figure out what to do about the game especially since all the players had streaked away. Not concerning himself with the chaos, Luke began to think about other people who had wronged him and what he might do about it. While fellow students at his school certainly took top place as possible victims, a certain group of scientists from the recent symposium had their place on Luke’s mental list of people who may find themselves in very embarrassing situations. Luke took a healthy long swig from his canteen as he walked away with schemes running around in his head while still chuckling about the soccer boys losing their clothes in front of everyone. The day had gotten warmer. And though he was a very intelligent lad, he had let his antagonists’ humiliation, his future plans for the serum, and his thirst prevent him from thinking about what he had just drank. However, part way home his poor choice of thirst-quencher hit home very hard when he saw some kids in a yard pointing at him and laughing. He looked down and gasped. His face turned a very brilliant red and a suddenly very naked Luke ran the rest of the way home.</p>
