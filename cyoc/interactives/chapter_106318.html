<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Horse DNA?!! Can I make horse cum?!!&quot; Marcus thought. Thankfully, he still had human mind. &quot;Are my balls filled with horse cum?! So gross!!&quot;<br />
Marcus made a loud whinny that surprised Jeanie.<br />
&quot;Wow! Are you excited, Marcus?&quot; She said. &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re happy of helping me!&quot; She spanked his ass friendly, but that made Marcus to realize he now has a horse ass. &quot;Ok, I&#39;m ready, boy! Shot!&quot;<br />
Marcus ignored her, he was lost in his thought. A horse, an animal. How is this possible? He don&#39;t want to be a big gross animal, completely unknown to his exposed body and feeling less than a human.<br />
&quot;Did you hear me? Or do you need some help?&quot; Jeanie said.<br />
&quot;Help? The only help I need is to turn back to human!&quot; He thought.<br />
&quot;Uhm... Maybe you need a partner...&quot; Jeanie said. &quot;Someone of your same specie...&quot;<br />
&quot;Will you bring another horse?&quot; Marcus thought, he was mad because she can&#39;t hear him. &quot;Do you want I fuck an animal? Like if I was an... an... animal...&quot; He saw how logic and probable it was.<br />
&quot;But, where can I find another horse?&quot; Jeanie said<br />
She began to look around her. There were a lot of people in the park but her magic had made that nobody noted what she was doing. Her son and his friend were still playing on the sandbox. Some people were walking and another ones were sit on benches. A few were talking but nobody looks to have a few minutes for her. She was getting dissapointed to that when she saw a street dog going to Marcus. Apparently, it wasn&#39;t affected by Jeanie&#39;s magic, but it didn&#39;t care about the horse in the middle of the park. It began to sniff Marcus which made him feel a little bit uncomfortable and he moved his tail trying to move it away.<br />
&quot;Oh, I think you like it!&quot; Jeanie said. &quot;And by your tail&#39;s movement I think you like it too!&quot;<br />
&quot;Eh? What?&quot; Marcus thought. &quot;Oh, no!! No no no no!! I know what you will do!!&quot;<br />
&quot;It can be your partner!&quot; Jeanie said happily. &quot;Are you ready, doggy?!!&quot;<br />
She clapped and in a few second the dog turned into a horse like Marcus. They looked almost the same that no one could think they originally were from too different species.<br />
&quot;Wow! He looks like a normal horse!&quot; Marcus thought. &quot;Oh, well. I think me too...&quot;<br />
&quot;Interesting!&quot; Jeanie said. &quot;You are a male too, doggy!&quot;<br />
As Jeanie was holding the former dog&#39;s balls it get aroused and his sheath revealed its penis.<br />
&quot;You and Marcus are basically the same! I wonder if I need two of you...&quot; She said.<br />
&quot;Then turn me back to a boy!!!&quot; Marcus screamed in his mind.<br />
&quot;Marcus, do what the doggy did and let your penis go out!&quot;<br />
Hearing her talk like that about his privates made him feel embarrased, but then he realized her words had worked. Without his control, his penis had go out from his sheat. Ugh, his sheath... that thought was still too gross to him and the feeling of his longer dick coming out from his body made harder to ignore it. He tried to distract himself by looking at the other horse, but at his first sight he saw the animal&#39;s horse balls and his long pole hanging down its belly. Those balls were big, black and animalish, the penis was long, black and thick. They looked so disgusting, and the idea of having the same set on him made him feel sick.<br />
&quot;Finally!&quot; Jeanie said. &quot;Now, you&#39;ll shot in three...!&quot;<br />
Marcus tried to control his arousal but for some reason he knew he can&#39;t avoid to shot in an instant.<br />
&quot;Two...&quot;<br />
He tried to distract himself again. To think in anything else... his human body... no, he thought on his Hulk form!<br />
&quot;One...&quot;<br />
No, there must be a way to don&#39;t shoooooo.... Too late. A big rush travel through his body, he wasn&#39;t able to control. That feeling that he had discovered a few moments ago when she turned him into a teenager had repeated now, but the feeling was a Little bit different, wilder maybe...<br />
&quot;Oh, no! I shot!&quot; Marcus thought and then he saw a goo on the floor next to him. &quot;That yellowish goo... is that...&quot; He saw at the other horse which looked like it was happier than before. &quot;That was yours... and mine...&quot;<br />
He moved a few steps forward and then he looked behind him. On the floor was another yellowish goo, that&#39;s his. He felt a sudden feeling of disgusting. He was sure that he won&#39;t like to touch something like that in his life, but now he was making it with his horse... balls... Thinking about those thing hanging under him and making new horse cum right now was hard for him.<br />
&quot;Ok, I have what I need!&quot; Jeanie said happily. &quot;Good job, doggy! And good job to you too, Marcus!&quot;<br />
&quot;You talk like that because you&#39;re not the one who turned into a horse and was forced to ejaculate..&quot; He said in his mind.<br />
&quot;Now... I think we&#39;ll continue with our species research...&quot; Jeanie said. &quot;But... What will I do with you, doggy? I saw that Marcus is capable of release the DNA by his own, so I don&#39;t know if I need to keep you...&quot;</p>
