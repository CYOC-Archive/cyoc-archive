<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I came to prrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrovide some help in case Devon pulled something,&quot; David said slowly as he looked to me and then glanced back to Fred, who he had been talking with, &quot;I didn't know, howeverrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr, that he HAD done something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He did that durrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrring the day,&quot; I answered, &quot;Prrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrobably hoping to angerrrrrrrrrrrrrr me into doing something stupid... which I probably did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It all worrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrked out in the end,&quot; Terri said to me and then rubbed one shoulder gently.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fangton is divided between two Packs, and we are frrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrree,&quot; Night added, and licked my other cheek.<br />
<br />
I felt some faint stirrings in my member as I felt their breasts press against my back and the soft touch of Terri's paw-like hand. But they backed away and my member remained in its sheath as I focused toward David. Clearly a male werewolf, and one who had been a werewolf for a while, though maybe not as long as Devon. He was bigger than I was, but not by as big a margin as the size difference between Devon and I was. His fur a dull reddish brown that matched his rather wild hair, though I remembered it being rather wild when we had been in high school. I was sure he looked extremely attractive to any female werewolf that might see him, but if his personality remained the same, he wasn't going to force himself on anybody. I'd remembered him and Nate hitting on girls that were already involved with someone, but they beat a hasty retreat when the irate boyfriend came to confront them.<br />
<br />
That made me feel somewhat confident that he wouldn't take Terri or Night from me, at least not on a permanent basis. But as we stood in front of each other, something about him countered a lot about what I'd already learned from Terri. Terri had told me that lycanthropy had not only raised her libido with regard to male/female sexual interaction but had also attracted her to females as well. When she told me, I had thought that that would also apply to me as well. That I would be attracted to men as well as women. However, David's scent smelled the same to me as Devon's did. It gave my instincts a sense of fear and challenge, like my wolf wanted to fight his.<br />
<br />
&quot;Male werrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrewolves arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrre not bisexual,&quot; David said slowly, apparently picking up on what was making me nervous, &quot;On some level ourrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr instincts arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrre gearrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrred to gatherrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr females to mate with...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Male werrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrewolves instinctively gatherrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr harrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrems?&quot; I gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Prrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrobably some biological urge,&quot; David answered, &quot;Sasha and I have been trying to have pups but have been unsuccessful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sasha?&quot; Tonya asked slowly, &quot;Sasha Weinberrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrg?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; David nodded slowly, &quot;She came to Klawthorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrn with some otherrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr young female, Marrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrry Vee and met Nate and I. Afterrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr a considerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrable amount of alcohol, we learrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrned about theirrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr fearrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr of Devon and why they left Fangton... it also lead to us having sex and being bitten in the thrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrows of passion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They helped you adjust then?&quot; Terri asked.<br />
<br />
Nate nodded, &quot;Which lead to rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrromance and marrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrriage. I'd die forrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr Sasha, which I guess is why you confrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrronted Devon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I couldn't let him get away with what he's done,&quot; I answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... with Fangton divided and you as its de facto Alpha Male...&quot;<br />
<br />
Tonya gave a slight growl, as her &quot;threat&quot; with her father's secret had named Night the Alpha, but David was probably right on a technicality. With a pack of four, a true &quot;Alpha&quot; wasn't necessary.<br />
<br />
&quot;...and frrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrom what yourrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr frrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrriend has told me, you'd best leave Devon to the police,&quot; David answered, &quot;they will get him... and what is common in these cases involving werrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrewolves attacking humans... even if it was done durrrrrrrrrrrrrrring the day and in human forrrrrrrrrrrrrrm... it will end violently forrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr him when they catch him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He prrrrrrrrrrrrrrrobably won't stop messing with you, though,&quot; Tonya warned, &quot;He can't kill you orrrrrrrrrrrrr attack you outrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrright with Fangton divided, but he will cerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrtianly try to prrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrove he is the morrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrre dominant wolf. It's why I stepped in to save you. To attack an elderrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrly woman to punish you and prrrrrrrrrrrrrrove his dominance is too much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And believe,&quot; I said to her, and put one paw on her shoulder, &quot;I thank you forrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr yourrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr help. If you want, we can help you look forrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr yourrrrrrrrrrrrrrr boyfrrrrrrriend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That can wait,&quot; Tonya answered, &quot;He won't arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrive tonight, and all of us will be needing cerrrrrrrrrrrrrrtian things tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a slightly sexual tone to her voice as she finished, which both I and David picked up. Kevin, Fred, and Gabriel picked up on it as well, particularly as Terri and Night nodded in agreement and licked me again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Beforrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrre things get to a point where we'll need to go outside,&quot; David said slowly, &quot;Could you say HOW you divided Fangton? Frrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrom what Sasha has told me, Devon is not one that would accept something that would put his dominance into question.&quot;<br />
<br />
That brought my attention back to Tonya's confronting of her father. While having some members of Devon's pack turning on him to get their own loves back was something I expected, I still expected it to result in a brawl. But there was no fight. Tonya threatened to reveal something and Devon backed down to keep that from coming out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daddy has always been prrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrotective of his image,&quot; Tonya gave a frustrated sigh, &quot;He wants in to the Lycanthrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrropic Council and as such has trrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrried to make it seem like he a werrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrewolf of grrrrrrrrrrrrrrreat staturrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrre and longevity.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But Night told me most werrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrewolves were bitten, not borrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrn,&quot; I commented.<br />
<br />
Tonya nodded, &quot;Yes. A rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrresult of the fact that we arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrre nearrrrrrrrrrrrrly completely sterrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrile.&quot;<br />
<br />
I could swear I heard David give a soft whine at that.<br />
<br />
&quot;But, if a werrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrewolf has been an Alpha and it has been a verrrrrrrrrrrrrrry long time since they werrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrre bitten, they can gain staturrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrre and position,&quot; Tonya continued, &quot;which Daddy wanted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But the Council doesn't hold any RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRREAL powerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr overrrrrrrrrrrrrr individual packs,&quot; Terri commented.<br />
<br />
Again, Tonya nodded, &quot;Trrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrre, but it's morrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrre a question of image and prrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrestige rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrratherrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr than powerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. Afterrrrrrrrrrrrr all, the Queen of England holds little rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreal powerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr, but is greatly rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrespected.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I take it, Devon has not been a werrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrewolf as long as he's porrrrrrrrrrrrrtrrrrrrrrrrrrrayed himself as being...?&quot; David asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Tonya nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know?&quot; I blurted.<br />
<br />
Tonya gave a sigh and glanced to me, Terri, and Night, then to David, and then to the humans in our presence.<br />
<br />
&quot;This must neverrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr leave this rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrroom,&quot; she said, &quot;Prrrrrrrrrrrrrromise?&quot;<br />
<br />
I watched David draw an &quot;X&quot; in the fur on his chest with one claw.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll also keep your... your &quot;condition&quot; secret,&quot; Fred added, &quot;though not that anyone would believe us, anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tonya nodded and then gave her answer, &quot;because I am the one that bit him.&quot;<br />
<br />
If we'd been drinking anything, we would have done a spit-take.<br />
<br />
&quot;It happened when I was verrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrry little,&quot; Tonya answered, &quot;Daddy had taken us camping, and it was the full moon durrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrring that vacation. I met a young boy named Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrian and made frrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrriends. He had a slight rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrebellious strrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreak with his parrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrents and we ended up going off on a hike nearrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr sunset. Howeverrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr, Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrian hadn't eaten enough meat that day he trrrrrrrrrrransforrrrrrrrrrrmed rrrrrrrrrright next to me. I rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrran and made it up a trrrrrrrrrrrrree, but Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrian bit me beforrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrre I could get away. I guess I got just high enough that he couldn't drrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrag me down and eat me... but I was still on my way to becoming a werrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrewolf.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened next?&quot; Kevin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrian went off in searrrrrrrrrrrrrrch of prrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrey he could catch,&quot; Tonya answered, &quot;I don't know what happened with me. I woke up in the hospital and with my vacation cut shorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrt. Daddy cut some strrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrings that allowed me to recooperrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrate at home and then took me home, but with no one to teach me... I was a ticking time bomb... and that night, I went off. I changed, I attacked both of my parrrrrrrrrrrrrants who managed to fight me off beforrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrre I could bite them... but after that it's a blurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr with regarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrd with my firrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrst trrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrransforrrrrrrrrrrmation. I woke up naked in an alley surrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrounded by thrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrree mostly eaten strrrrrrrrrrrrrrray dogs... though I was found by none otherrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr then Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrian and his parrrrrrrrrrrrrrents. They apologized forrrrrrrrrrrrrrr my being bitten and helped me and my parrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrants adapt... and Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrian would stay in the arrrrrrrrrrrrrrea to be with me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Until yourrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr fatherrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr chased him away,&quot; I finished, as I noticed that Tonya's tone when she mentioned to her father as &quot;daddy&quot; was not a particularly happy or entirely respectful one.</p>
