<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Okay girls, now remember Padma and I have to check over all of the candy before you eat any just in case. So you go wash up and get changed for bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie and Padma watched as the group of sleepy six year olds go to take off their costumes and change for bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Padma for helping out tonight.&quot; The two start going through the candy, checking each piece and sorting it. Some they weren&#39;t certain about immediately get tossed.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was a pleasure.&quot; Padma smiled at Kellie for a moment.<br />
<br />
By the time all the girls were finished washing up and changing into pajamas, Kellie and Padma had finished sorting the candy. The six year olds certainly wouldn&#39;t get any that night, but they would have plenty of candy during the weekend.<br />
<br />
Kellie and Padma got the tired group of six year olds into the bedrooms.<br />
<br />
After they all got into the beds and when Padma was about to leave, Tricia quietly said to Padma. &quot;You can stay if you want. Katie got you some pajamas over there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Padma went over and picked up a pair of tiny pajamas. In that instant her pants became loose on her hips and she realized that those pajamas wouldn&#39;t be tiny for much longer.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you - &quot; Padma coughed slightly as her voice cracked. &quot;couldn&#39;t wait, could you?&quot; Her voice rose in pitch and her pants fell off her slender hips. Her tight t-shirt was loose and fell below her hips. She looked down in time to see what remained of her abundant bust disappear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well there goes puberty.&quot; Tricia giggled as Padma entered her single digits of life.<br />
<br />
The t-shirt could be considered a nightshirt now, the Indian girl thought with amusement. The room seemed huge now as Padma looked around.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do you think of being six Padma?&quot; It was funny to Padma how such a girl who looked so tiny was now bigger than her.<br />
<br />
Padma quickly changed into the now fitting pajamas before slipping into the bed with Tricia. &quot;I think we will lots of fun this weekend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tricia had been uncertain about being this young for any amount of time, but she was finding it to be more fun than she expected. &quot;I think so too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Padma stretched as she slowly began to wake up. She hadn&#39;t felt this energized in quite sometime. &quot;I haven&#39;t felt this good in ages,&quot; she thought sleepily.<br />
<br />
Thinking back Padma couldn&#39;t shake the dream she had, it had felt so real. She had met a young girl who had the ability to change her age. Padma and the girl had become close very quickly. This relationship saw Padma gradually grow younger herself, leaving the two a pair of happy 6 year olds. &quot;Such an odd dream,&quot; she mused. As her eyes began to focus she looked over her surroundings and herself, letting out an audible gasp.<br />
<br />
Padma was in a young girls bedroom, toys and dresses strewn about haphazardly. As she looked at her hands she was shocked to see them so small and young.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning,&quot;<br />
<br />
Padma blinked as she glanced over at a young black girl smiling at her. &quot;Tricia,&quot; she said unsteadily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah its me,&quot; Tricia said happily. &quot;How you feeling?&quot;<br />
<br />
Padma threw the blanket off her small body, shocked to see she really was just a child again. As she lept off the bed she gazed around in awe. &quot;I...I&#39;m okay,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Everything is so big though. I...I thought last night was just some crazy dream.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope,&quot; Tricia laughed. &quot;It was real. Your a kid again, a cute kid if I do say so myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Padma felt her cheeks flush as she looked at her slightly taller friend. &quot;Thanks,&quot; she said shyly. Padma now shyly tried to avoid eye contact, as she surveyed the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well was wondering when you were going to get up,&quot; Tricia said. &quot;The others already made their way downstairs for breakfast. I figured though there was something we should do before we join them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I dont think youve seen how you look yet,&quot; Tricia smirked. &quot;Why dont you go check out your reflection in the bathroom mirror.&quot;<br />
<br />
Padma nodded as she followed Tricia out of the bedroom. As they entered the bathroom the young Indian girl could only frown. &quot;The mirrors too high,&quot; she grumbled.<br />
<br />
As Tricia giggled Padma took in her surroundings. While it appeared normal enough the dimensions seemed at a almosy giant scale to the little girl. The si k itself rested about chest high to the girl while the mirrored medicine cabinet was positioned above her head. Even Tricia would not be able to see anything besides the top of her head at the current age.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thought you might say that,&quot; Tricia giggled. &quot;Thats why I got this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Padma watched as Tricia now placed a step stool at the sink. The stool was just large enough for the girl to be able to see her face in the mirror. &quot;So you ready for a surprise,&quot; Tricia asked with a smirk. Padma nodded in determination. Stepping onto the stool the girl looked in mirror and gasped in astonishment.<br />
<br />
It was a face Padma had not seen in decades, but it was undeniably her. The big dark brown eyes, the shoulder length black hair, even the slightly crooked teeth from her childhood had returned. Looking at the reflection Padma could see.that it was her as she looked when she was 6 years old the first time.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is amazing,&quot; she said in wonder as she touched her face. &quot;I&#39;m still shocked that all of this is true.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its alot to take in, &quot; Tricia said stoically. &quot;But it is true all of it.&quot; Padma nodded stepping off the foot stool and once again finding herself too shorr to see her reflection.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do we do now,&quot; Padma asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Tricia mused. &quot;First thing we should do is grab breakfast. After that lets see what the others are thinking. We&#39;ll probably end up a different age so we can do something fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
Padma rubbed her chin before smiling. &quot;Sounds like alot of fun,&quot; she smirked. &quot;Hopefully you and me can have some time to ourselves later on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tricia smiled before taking Padmas hand and rushing for the stairs. Time alone sounded like a great plan indeed.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you are Padma.&quot; Katie smiled from where she was seated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Told you Tricia had a Girlfriend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Mary.&quot; Mary innocently smiled and went back to her sugary breakfast cereal. The rest of the girls greeted Padma from where they were eating cereal or watching cartoons.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what are we doing today?&quot; Tricia asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re not exactly sure yet.&quot; Katie responded. &quot;Kellie said we could decide, or at least tell her our big idea for today.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tricia thought about it for a moment. &quot;What about the amusement park? We could ride all the &#39;kiddie&#39; rides and then ride the height restricted ones with a little help.&quot; Tricia looked at the ring that she had given back to Katie.<br />
<br />
Mary bounced in her seat a bit. &quot;How about lazer tag with a twist?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe an early PG movie that the theater runs for kids, look around the mall, and catch a PG-13 movie later on in the day.&quot; Claudia stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe we can go to the playground later on this morning and then watch a video here later on.&quot; Samantha chimed in.<br />
<br />
&quot;You just want to see Jake again.&quot; Samantha blushed slightly.<br />
<br />
Mika was silent for a moment. &quot;You know, I remember hearing about a special party at the Indoor Water Park tonight. One for those 21 and over. We could always go to the waterpark at this age and then go to the party later on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay girls, what are we going to do today?&quot; Kellie came from the bedroom where she was getting dressed.</p>
