<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Josh swirled around on the barstool and looked at Jesse with lazy eyes, fairly annoyed too by the look of it. <br />
Behind him he saw a woman leaning over the desk with a look of interest, who had obviously been chatting with <br />
him before Jesse interrupted.  <br />
 <br />
&quot;Er... your tail? Remember?&quot; <br />
 <br />
It took a while for this to register, but eventually Josh's eyes widened and his mouth formed an &quot;O&quot;... and he <br />
cautiously reached a hand towards his back. However he was too drunk to find the waistband so he could only <br />
awkwardly fumble. The very idea that Josh had a tail seemed to fuel the growth of the appendage, and it did so <br />
impressively quick. The backside of his pants was tenting out more and more with each passing second and both <br />
Jesse and the woman looked at it with anticipation. Josh was breathing heavily and jolts of pleasure surged <br />
from his back. After only a moment he suddenly stopped and leaned forward to the bar instead. Something made <br />
him clench for dear life and he couldn't really control it. The bulge on his back grew more taut and Josh was <br />
groaning loudly.<br />
<br />
Jesse looked at the pants slowly straining outward, and despite the unrealistic scenario of him growing a <br />
tail, it wasn't really that feasible that anything would simply push through the resilient jeans fabric. Jesse <br />
took one claw and ripped a hole in the jeans. <br />
<br />
Out of the pants a tail almost exploded out, and it grew larger and longer slowly. The woman drew one hand <br />
down his back and toward the stem of the tail, and stroke the soft fur that grew longer under her fingers. <br />
Josh shuddered and was beginning to feel aroused from all this and honestly a bit ill at the same time due to <br />
the copious amount of alcohol he had in his system at the moment, but he managed to hold it back and just <br />
focused on the otherworldly experience of having a tail grow out of his usually ordinary human tailbone. His <br />
whole body bombarbed his head with the new sensation that his whole being was busily being refurbished and <br />
recoded.<br />
 <br />
The three of them stared at Josh's posterior as the furry tail grew out, now draping over the back of the <br />
barstool. It slowly grew to an appropriately sized wolf's tail, now firmly attached to his friend's backside <br />
and looking quite out of place on his otherwise human body. It was a beautiful classic wolf colouration in <br />
mostly brown with plenty of volume, and it slowly began to twitch from side to side once it reached its final <br />
length. Josh was somewhere in a state of not being quite certain whether this was a joyous or horrific moment, <br />
and his tail seemed to reflect this too. But as soon as the tail stopped growing - ending up quite an <br />
impressive sight too -  Josh could feel a tickling from the base of his tail as fur start the slow process of <br />
trickling into place up his lower back and cover his buttocks, and felt a pleasant shiver up his spine that <br />
made him shudder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck, the fur, it's spreading... it's going up my back!&quot; he said with a quavering voice, stiffening his <br />
back into an backward arc as the alien but warm sensation travelled upwards, fruitlessly clawing with his <br />
hands at his back and feeling the guardhairs brush over his his fingers.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Nice! Still feeling like keeping your clothes on?&quot; Jesse said with a contemptuous tone. He could smell <br />
Jesse's perspiration and knew the pace at which his heart must be racing right now. <br />
 <br />
&quot;I know I agreed on this whole thing but not [i]seeing[/i] what's happening is making me crazy!&quot; - hands <br />
rummaging behind his back. His squirming stopped suddenly as he froze. Realization hit him like a brick to the <br />
face as he sobered up in a matter of seconds.<br />
&quot;I'm going to turn out a full fucking werewolf ain't I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seems like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh looked a little bit taken, with vacant wide open eyes starying into nothing. He wasn't exactly as open to <br />
it as Jesse was apparently. <br />
<br />
&quot;Complete with hairy palms and that classy unibrow too I assume.&quot; He added after a while of silence, in hope <br />
of getting him back down on Earth again.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Oh god I hope not.&quot; he said and turned his shaking hands around so he could see. To Jesse's  disappointment, <br />
it seemed like nothing had happened to them.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Not yet at least&quot;, Jesse added with a smile and turned his head to glance at the crowded floor behind them. <br />
&quot;Anyhow, let's go and find us a table. Can't stand the noise with these on&quot;, and gestured towards his half-<br />
moon ears with a clawed finger. Warily stepping down the barstool he brought the three remaining mugs of beer <br />
with him as he waded through the crowd. As he took his first steps he began to feel the effects of the alcohol <br />
as he wobbled comically, nearly knocking a guy on the head with his mugs and bumping into several people with <br />
his unfamiliarly distended belly. Josh could hear him excusing himself repeatedly as he plowed through like a <br />
polite ice-breaker.<br />
<br />
Josh on the other hand was overcome with a curious feeling, a bit perky all of a sudden as the fur now had <br />
reached halfway up his back. He leaned into the woman's ear without really thinking and whispered something <br />
that made her blush, then gently motioned for her to come with him. She smiled nervously, taking notice of the <br />
hand  which she literally could see hair slowly growing on and followed. He knew something new was entering <br />
his mindset and like the alcohol helps a man getting rid of his inhibitions, this new surge eminating from his <br />
tailbone up his spine seemed to get rid of all of his [i]human[/i] inhibitions. It wasn't as much as taking <br />
over him but rather it suggested, and the feelings of uneasiness over the transformation simply left his mind <br />
without any fuss whatsoever. He could feel hair growing in on his chest now, and he grinned.<br />
 <br />
The table Jesse found was a bit more remote so they could talk at a normal level but had to push out the table <br />
to make place for his ample gut. He was occupying nearly the whole length of a bench by himself he noticed, <br />
not particularly disturbed by this fact either. He felt just outright comfortable with his padded and huge <br />
body as it quite fittingly just 'grew on him'. He couldn't wait to meet up with the bartender later tonight to <br />
seal the deal and maintain his werebear condition for good. And right now in his drunken stupor he couldn't <br />
even think of one reason on that being a bad idea. Looking up, he saw Josh's bushy tail wagging wildly behind <br />
him as he held his new date lower and lower along her back as they walked towards him.<br />
 <br />
Jesse saw the signs and showcased a bear's happy smile as they approached. But, a bit worried that he might <br />
not find his brunette and feeling a bit jealous as well, he realised with a sting of clearness in his <br />
intoxicated mind that he need to find her as soon as possible and give her stuff back; or come out looking as <br />
the perpetrator who stole the bag rather than the gentleman who returned it. He didn't like it, since he'd <br />
miss most if not all of Jesse's transformation most likely, but this was something he needed to do. Something <br />
about her just caught him like glue, his mind was looping around and around all the possible scenarios on how <br />
he would introduce himself and what would happen after. What if she was scared of him? What if she would just <br />
laugh and walk away? What would happen if he got luck-<br />
He quickly shrugged it off. He needed to meet her, now. <br />
Best approach anyway, he reasoned. Less time for his head to come up with an excuse not to. Perfectly normal <br />
behaviour while drunk.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Uhm, I have to do something, I'll be back in a short while.&quot; He was quite confident it wouldn't take too <br />
long, considering he could smell her even now. The clear scent that wafted in the air made his body tingle <br />
pleasantly. He shuddered a little as he got a sensory overload from his new nose. &quot;Name's Jesse by the way,&quot; <br />
he said and reached out a paw towards the woman who Josh was clearly imposing on sexually by now as he looked <br />
huskily at the side of her face and his hands out of sight somewhere Jesse couldn't see. He didn't pay much <br />
attention to this little formality, understandably. <br />
 <br />
She looked a bit surprised then smiled warmly, &quot;Dianne.&quot; Her hand only able to shake two of his plump fingers. <br />
&quot;Not the name I had expected for a huge fellow like you though. Or well, at least the [i]new[/i] you.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Jesse laughed nervously and coughed. He kind of agreed.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Well then... I'll be off. &quot; Jesse instinctively licked his broad nose without really thinking about it. <br />
&quot;Catch you later!&quot; He then ambled away into the whirring crowd of people, wet nose held high. <br />
 <br />
&quot;So Dianne...&quot;, Josh gently stroked her hair aside. The moment Jesse left their sight the situation between <br />
them two instantly turned into a coil winded too tight, as Dianne's heartbeat suddenly skyrocketed as it was <br />
clear that Josh's attention was now 100% focused on her. Possibly even more than that, she reflected. His eyes <br />
had a sharp quality to them.<br />
<br />
Jesse's inhibitions was quite liberated due to the alcohol and - he took notice of afterwards - a new primal <br />
urge inside of him that seemed to make it completely natural to avidly smell the neck of a woman he had <br />
previously only spent fifteen minutes with. He shivered with adrenaline as her fragrance seemed so very <br />
intoxicating, like he just wanted to rip her clothing apart right there and then to get underneath to the skin <br />
just so he could taste it. Josh felt a bit like he was driving on automatic as his body simply propelled him <br />
forwards with its undeniable urges at the front towards the inevitable destination; and he wholly embraced it. <br />
Growing slowly beneath his clothes, the itching of spreading fur had covered his buttocks and now grew down <br />
between his thighs and tickling the vicinity of his genitals; the change was imminent as he felt the <br />
anticipation rise. The soon-to-be mane reached his upper back underneath his clothing, starting to spread out <br />
across his shoulderblades and reach for the base of his neck. His tail wagging silently across the bench in <br />
excitement all the while. Sleeves riding up his arm as his body unnoticeably grew more and more imposing with <br />
every passing second.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Hey...&quot; she replied and looked into his eyes. She saw a clear glimpse from his eyes as she felt an uneasiness <br />
run through her like a tremor. She had known what he was becoming, and daresay she was pretty uncertain <br />
whether she should have followed this guy or not. He seemed to be a nice guy; but this was [i]clearly[/i] <br />
tipping the scale. But her urges softened the sharply edged fear as a warm, masculine hand was stroking gently <br />
on her stomach, slowly gracing the bottom of her breasts as her heartbeat raced. She anticipated his next <br />
move, and rightly so as a thumb slowly slid up and played with her hard nipple. She held her breath.<br />
 <br />
&quot;I know this may be very inappropriate for a first date, however...&quot;, he paused only for a moment seemingly <br />
for introspection on the situation, but then came to terms with it as he slid his hand up towards her breast <br />
and cupped it forcibly. Dianne yelped. &quot; ...I wonder if that even matters now?&quot;, Josh said huskily with an <br />
growling undertone beginning deep in his throat and a wicked smile across his face. He felt exhilarated.<br />
<br />
Dianne peered down at his now hairy arm and hand and bit her lip. She was definitively in for a ride. Like on <br />
cue (or as a reward) after the first move on his bitch, Jesse began to feel an itchiness across his face now <br />
as dark whiskers protruded slowly through the skin and endowing his face with a rich, thick stubble that <br />
stretched down his broad throat and trailed further underneath his shirt. His chest prickled as thick hair <br />
quickly covered more and more of his front with a manly rug. His eyebrows grew slightly bushier while the hair <br />
on his head was now pretty much straightened out and had a glossy sheen to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my, seems my inner wolf wants to come out and play.&quot; His voice deep and menacing.<br />
<br />
His beard was dark brown with an incredible thickness and density, growing high up on his cheeks. Taking his <br />
other hand that wasn't groping the woman's breasts with gusto, he took a grip around his throat and rubbed his <br />
face, feeling the growth as it grew from rough stubble to a one inch long, enviably dense beard stretching <br />
down his throat out of sight under his shirt and connecting with his chest hair. It was pleasant he decided. <br />
He had always admired thick, dark beards and now he finally wore one himself. The hairs compliantly rolled <br />
over his fingers as he stroked.<br />
Or well, it would turn into thick werewolf fur soon enough he mused, and chuckled.<br />
<br />
Leaning over Dianne he began to kiss her slender neck, his new beard still growing as he slobbered her <br />
affectionally. She in return took both arms around his neck and giggled as her skin was being erotically <br />
tickled and touched by his long and limber tongue and facial hair. It was simply too good to feel any remorse <br />
she concluded. And hell, she had always been considered an opportunistic person; might as well keep it up.<br />
 <br />
Josh's clothes felt tight and unbearably warm, especially around his chest. His previous feelings of decency <br />
had all but melted away, so he broke out of his kissing and took both of his now outright furry hands with <br />
nails turning into dark and sharp claws, shaking with anticipation as he slowly grasped his shirt up by the <br />
collar and the buttons opened one by one as he was now only clad in a tight t-shirt. His shoulders had hunched <br />
slightly and fur could be seen stretching from the back of his neck reaching out of the collar to entwine with <br />
his wild hair. And judging from the lack of skincontact he felt from his clothing he seemed to have a fairly <br />
substantial pelt over his whole front too.<br />
 <br />
&quot;I just want to know... why it is that you smell so delicious&quot;, he continued and threw the shirt aside. Josh's <br />
shirt had brown chest hair peeking out the collar and from the middle of his chest through the fabric, lifting <br />
it gently. The woman placed a hand there and slowly rubbed it, no denying there was a fine coat just <br />
underneath that layer of textile just waiting to come out. She liked her men hairy so she more intently began <br />
to rub it, and to her surprise she felt it expand under her hand like she had ushered its growth simply by <br />
touch. Josh growled softly and bowed his head down, closing his eyes. He felt pleasure invigorating his body <br />
as the feral essence bubbled up to the surface, making his skin itch and muscles heat up, his chest tingling <br />
pleasantly under her touch as the fur grew thicker. Looking up she saw how his expression shifted uneasily and <br />
sweat beginning to form into a thin reflective film on his bearded face. <br />
 <br />
&quot;Oh god...&quot;, Josh said and breathed jaggedly between his clenched teeth. &quot;Nngh...&quot;. The shirt  was now skin-<br />
tight on his body, constricting his breathing.<br />
<br />
Suddenly his t-shirt began to tear from the neck when it couldn't take the strain any longer, thick brown <br />
chest-fur tufting up instantly as it broke loose. Josh let out a sigh of relief, leaning his head back and <br />
panting. The woman who was taken a bit aback by what just happened, carefully put her hand on the tear and <br />
slowly tore it down as she helped Josh get rid of the shreds. As it ripped she could see the entirety of his <br />
front was now covered in thick luscious fur that didn't really accentuate his muscles but it gave him a nice <br />
fluff across his whole abdomen. A quick glance to the side she could see his forearms growing muscular with <br />
long fur stretching under his elbows. Even his ears was starting to form points. His heavy breathing caught <br />
her again, as his furry chest was bulging out with bulk and his neck was growing vascular underneath the now <br />
promising mane across his throat - formerly beard - and broadening shoulders. The shirt fell off and now she <br />
could see the werewolf-in-the-making in all its furry glory, the hair on his head fully connected to the <br />
bristly mane on his back which was turning wild and shaggy.<br />
 <br />
She leaned back a little and looked at Josh longingly as his body cracked and expanded, his eyes closed in <br />
what she could only read as pleasure. With one hand caressing his furry beard she ushered the growth further <br />
so it became a wild and soft mess with a feeling not unlike burrowing it into a large dog's luxuriantly furry <br />
ruff that now encircled his whole neck which in turn joined his mane around the back. With the other she <br />
rubbed his stomach through the furry bristle and spread fingered her hand slip into his pants, blushing and <br />
not without with a bit of surprise that this apparently was also a part of being a werewolf. Josh growled <br />
amorously at her teasing and really coming out sounding as a wild beast, eyes still closed he took jerked his <br />
head back up, took her body with one arm and jammed it tightly to his. She was now face to face with his <br />
protruding muzzle, her breasts against his exposed chest-fur, tickling her cleavage. His large wolf-sheath now <br />
pushing out the jeans tightly, tears in the seams as fur poked through his tattered pants. One glance downward <br />
confirmed that his legs was now muscled, fully digitigrade wolf-legs with large paws sporting some very <br />
menacing claws. They both breathed heavily like this for a while without doing anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... this evening turned out to be more interesting than I'd thought&quot;, she smiled and put her lips against <br />
his. Josh gladly accepted the tongue-hockey and savoured her taste, then carefully bit her lower lip. He felt <br />
blood seep into his mouth, a surge not unlike the one you get after eating somehing delicious, permeate his <br />
palate and throat. His face slowly stretched out, eyes still closed as he let his thickening tongue savour the <br />
tiny droplet of blood in his mouth. Cock was twitching with excitement as he could feel his body enlargening <br />
in the final stages of his transformation, filling his mouth with sharp fangs. But all of a sudden his now <br />
sensitive nose could smell something alluring, and he opened his blue predatory eyes. In front of him he saw a <br />
brown muzzle - his muzzle - and beyond that a woman who had gleaming eyes and a mischievous look on her face. <br />
Dianne took in the new Josh whose fangs was frighteningly close to her as the majestic and complete head of a <br />
wolf looked down at her. She clambered up his lap, teasing his wolfhood by just barely hovering her ass above <br />
it, hands moving up his pecs and underneath the furry mane encircling his head. Jesse's mind was reeling. His <br />
libido aching.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know...&quot; she strokes his cheek with one finger. &quot;A dependable guy always buys his girl a drink.&quot; <br />
<br />
She leaned in and whispered gently, teasing his ear to twitch with each syllable...<br />
<br />
&quot;You may already know what I have in mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
