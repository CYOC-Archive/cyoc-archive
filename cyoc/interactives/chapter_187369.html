<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Huh, that could be a possibility... but, let me ask you this. Do you even care at this point? Because I for one, am loving every single second of this.&quot; You say matter of factly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha! I don&#39;t know if I should be happy or concerned to hear you say that&quot; laughs your boyfriend. He pets your head and rubs your right ear for a moment, which causes you to shudder. It feels really, really good for you in a more nonsexual way. &quot;Hehe, your girlfriend wants you to pet her more!&quot; You say playfully. He of course obliges.<br />
<br />
He walks you out of the bathroom. While he does this, you swing your left leg up and over his head, using your new flexibility to do so. Now that you are facing him directly, you lean over and wrap your arms around his torso, then smoosh yourself close to him. You are so small that your head doesn&#39;t even clear his shoulders anymore. But that is perfect. You love the size difference between you. Being small and having such a big boyfriend gives you a comfortable sense of security. You feel your ass gently squeeze a bit tighter around his dick as if it too was giving it a hug. <br />
<br />
You must have fallen asleep at some point because you suddenly wake up and are completely covered by something. You are still pressed up against your boyfriend&#39;s chest and there is still nothing between you and his bare skin. You can hear many unfamiliar voices around you too. Finally you notice that not only is he wearing a shirt over you, but you are sharing his underwear and pants too. But it kind of made sense in a way, since you are attached to his dick and all. <br />
<br />
You look up and see his chin through the shirt hole. It seems like he hasn&#39;t realized that you woke up yet. You smile and kiss his chest. He pets your head through the shirt in response. And even though you are completely naked, hidden inside your boyfriend&#39;s clothes while out in public, you feel not shame or worry at all, which you find extremely perplexing. You look down at yourself and while you haven&#39;t gotten any smaller, your dick is gone and not even a pussy is in its place. It is just bare skin. Your breasts are now quite large. Bigger than both of your hands can hold at least. <br />
<br />
Your hair is down and very long now as well, as it falls quite a ways below your ass and is tucked into your boyfriend&#39;s pants along with your legs. It is still white as snow which you don&#39;t entirely mind, even if it is very attention grabbing. It compliments your eyes. <br />
<br />
You wonder where it is you currently are. And also why did he go out like this? It is somewhere with pleanty of people though, and it looks like it is dark outside, so it must be night time. You did have a ton of sex earlier, so you must have been more tired than you had realized. <br />
<br />
But now that you are awake, you decide to entertain yourself a bit. And you do so by teasing your boyfriend of course. You lick his chest. Then his nipple, then you poke him a bit here and there. He jumps and squirms as you mess with him which is quite entertaining for a bit. But then he sits down.<br />
<br />
You were not prepared for him to sit. But the second he did so, his cock slid all the way into the deepest part of your ass and stayed there. You were doing your absolute best to not cry out in pleasure, but it was not an easy battle. You can feel it squirming around inside you and you want nothing more than to start slamming your hips up and down on his dick. However, you can&#39;t. You mustn&#39;t do that in public. Or he will get in trouble or at least very embarrassed. <br />
<br />
The ride is smooth at least, and what you suspect to be the subway comes to a stop. Your boyfriend carries you off of it and out of the station, then walks for several more minutes until he enters a building. After speaking to a few people, he sits down again, but this time pulls his shirt off and puts a loose dress on over top of your head, letting it slide down over you and sit perfectly on top of your breasts. The strapless design presents a glorious display of your cleavage too. The satin pink of the dress stands out quite a bit though. You pull your hair free, seeing how it now is down to his knees, or your mid calves in length. The dress reminds  you more of something like sleepwear than something you wear out in public, but it is very comfortable so you don&#39;t say anything about it. In fact, they only thing you do end up doing is pushing yourself up and kissing him properly on the lips as thanks. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sleep well?&quot; He asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Umhm&quot; you hum as you nod yes. &quot;Why are we here though? Oh wow, is this my voice?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Woah. That is your voice? How can such a small body make such a seductively mature voice? I measured you and you are 4 ft 11 inches tall exactly. And yet you sound like a sexy woman in her late 20s?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, but you sure seem to like it, I can feel your cock twinge with each, and every, word... I... say. Well? Turned on ye-...?&quot;<br />
<br />
He shushed you by putting a finger to my lips. &quot;Stop trying to seduce me in public. People are going to notice. And, I may not be able to stop myself if you keep pressing me further. Your voice is just too dangerous.&quot; <br />
<br />
Only now do you realize that you are inside of a movie theater. &quot;Sorry, I was a bit too excited just then. But thank you for the dress, and the surprise date.&quot; He smiles, then slides you back down further onto her cock by pulling you in closer to him. To anyone else, it appears as if you are just sitting on your tall boyfriend&#39;s lap, so you allow it, but more so because you like how it feels. You and your boyfriend enjoy the movie, even if half way through you began having a very quiet round of sex. You hide back under his shirt right as the movie ends and the lights come on. He takes you home from there.<br />
<br />
Finally, you both are alone again, and you immediately start trying to seduce him again. Since you are on his erect cock, if you push yourself up most of the way, you actually are a few inches taller than his head. Being 2 feet off the ground is just the price for your dominant position of head height. Of course, he denies you this position by grabbing your legs under his arms and pulling you down to just below his height simply so he could just kiss your forehead. <br />
<br />
While you are happy he loves you, you are envious of his height, and kind of frustrated with your lack thereof. He is a full 16&quot; taller than you, which is quite a lot of distance. You also feel that you both may be getting too into this. Over the last few hours, you noticed that you keep having to remind yourself about who you both really are. How he is actually your girlfriend and how you are suppose to be a normal guy, and not some mixture between a horse and a girl. <br />
<br />
It is kind of scary how much this new life seems to change how you both think. But at the same time, you feel that it may not be such a bad thing to just remain like this either. You love your boyfriend just as much if not even more than when he was your girlfriend. You enjoy being your current self, and your ass/pussy is the best thing ever. Not to mention that you&#39;re completely hooked on his cock, literally. Sure public appearances may be seldom at best, but you can do it. <br />
<br />
You shelf this thought though, as right now, there is a boyfriend who&#39;s lips could be a lot wetter, and you are eager to help him out.</p>
