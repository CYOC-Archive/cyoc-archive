<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Thanks again to rawr7 for helping with this chapter! Sorry it took so long to write! I had initially planned for this to be a long chapter, but it got so long that I had no choice to cut it in half.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“There they are!” Mark pointed to the Cerberus-morph and cyclops that were sitting on a bench on the Body floor. The two foxes began to make their way through the crowd to get to them. When Rusty and Rok saw the pair of foxes approaching them, they both stood up. <br />
<br />
“Did you find him?” Rusty asked. Both Todd and Mark shook their heads, making the canine sigh in frustration. <br />
<br />
“No luck on our end either,” Rok said. “We searched the entire floor from top to bottom, and we haven’t seen any sign of him. No sign of Troy either, now that I think about it…” <br />
<br />
“He hasn’t responded to any of our texts for the last hour or so,” Todd commented. “So he’s either ignoring us or something’s happened to him.” <br />
<br />
“I don’t think you ever explained to us why you think Xarxos is so dangerous now,” Rusty said, looking at the orange-furred fox. “So he’s been transformed into an entirely different person; we can just use his spare chips to change him back. What’s got you so worried?” <br />
<br />
“It’s not the fact that he’s been transformed that worries me,” Todd admitted. “It’s <i>how</i> he was transformed that worries me.”<br />
<br />
“Elaborate.” <br />
<br />
“Think about it: every single machine here is rigged in favor of the house. If you lose a game, you become the property of the house. Xarxos bet all three of his chips when he went in to save Mark, and he lost. That means that this new version of Xarxos is working for the Dolans.” <br />
<br />
“Well, that definitely makes this whole situation a lot more concerning.”<br />
<br />
“So he’d more than likely try and steal the books from an unsuspecting Troy. And if this new Xarxos really is working for the Dolans like I think he is…” <br />
<br />
“...Then we’re royally fucked if he gets his hands on those books,” Mark finished. “But I don’t understand how he’s just disappeared on us. Even though my memory’s still a bit hazy, I remember him being a fairly large deer. He shouldn’t be too hard to spot in a crowd.” <br />
<br />
“Maybe we’re going about this all wrong…” Rok spoke up. His eye was closed and one of his hands was on his chin. He was seemingly deep in thought. “If new Xarxos is after the books, then he’d more than likely be trying to find Troy so he can get the books. So if we find Troy…” <br />
<br />
“...We’ll more than likely find Xarxos!” Todd finished. “Rok, you’re a genius!” <br />
<br />
“Naturally,” the cyclops replied with a chuckle. <br />
<br />
“So then, where would Troy be right about now?” Mark asked. <br />
<br />
“We could try tracking his phone,” Todd suggested, pulling his phone out of his pocket. He tapped the screen a few times before a grin appeared on his muzzle. “The last ping from his ePhone says that he’s…upstairs in one of the suites.” <br />
<br />
“Then he’s probably back at our suite,” Rok guessed. “Let’s move!” <br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-==-<br />
<br />
Rok slipped his keycard into the door to their suite. He opened it and quickly ushered the group inside. Once he closed the door, he led the others over to the door that led to Troy and Xarxos’ suite. The cyclops knocked on the door, and the four of them quietly awaited a response. <br />
<br />
“Come in.” A voice thundered.<br />
<br />
Rok opened the door, and all four of them quickly rushed into the room. <br />
<br />
Sitting on the bed was an anthro raccoon. <br />
<br />
He was thickly built, heavy with muscle and fat. He appeared to be in his mid-forties or early fifties, with bits of silver appearing in his gray and brown fur. He was wearing nothing but a pair of white boxers that did nothing to hide his enormous bulge as he lounged back on the bed, smoking a cigar. Upon seeing the group enter, he took the cigar out of his mouth and set it down in an ashtray on the nightstand. <br />
<br />
“Ah, you’ve finally come back,” the raccoon said gruffly. “I’ve been waiting for you lazy good-for-nothin’ grunts to get back here.” <br />
<br />
“Troy?!” Todd asked, his eyes widening upon seeing the large raccoon. “Wh-What the hell happened to you?!” <br />
<br />
“Who the hell are you calling Troy, pipsqueak?” the raccoon asked, glaring at the fox. “Explain to me why I shouldn’t just skin you alive right now and make you into a fur rug!” <br />
<br />
Before Todd could respond, Mark covered his lover’s mouth with his hand. <br />
<br />
“F-Forgive him, Mr. Trevor!” the white-furred fox said quickly. “He just had one too many to drink! He doesn’t know what he’s talking about!” <br />
<br />
Todd, Rok, and Rusty all looked at the other fox, looks of confusion plastered on their face. The raccoon simply huffed before picking his cigar back up and taking another smoke. <br />
<br />
“Fine, I’ll forgive him this time,” Trevor said. “But next time, I won’t be so merciful. I can’t have the other gangsters getting the wrong idea about me.” <br />
<br />
“Gangsters?!” Rok and Rusty shouted in unison. <br />
<br />
Now it was the raccoon’s turn to be confused. <br />
<br />
“Yes, of course, I’m a gangster,” Trevor responded. “Did you two numskulls hit your head or something? You’ve been working for me for years now!” <br />
<br />
“Right…sorry boss…” Rusty said, scratching the back of his middle head. “We just…had a bit much to drink.” <br />
<br />
“Just like your fox friend there,” he said, gesturing to Todd. “Good thing I like you, Rusty. It’d be a shame if I had to put you down.” <br />
<br />
The Cerberus morph looked at both Rok and Todd, shrugging his shoulders. <br />
<br />
“Uh, boss?” Rok asked, playing along. “Would you…excuse us for a second?”<br />
<br />
“Fine, but make it quick,” the raccoon replied. “I have a new task for you clowns.” <br />
<br />
The four of them stepped out of the room and closed the door behind them. <br />
<br />
“Okay, what the hell is going on?!” Todd asked rather loudly, only to be shushed by Mark, Rusty, and Rok. <br />
<br />
“Keep your voice down!” Mark snapped. “He’s in the other room!”<br />
<br />
“I know he’s in the other room, but I want to know who the fuck he is!” Todd hissed.<br />
<br />
“That’s Trevor, the head of the mob family here in Vegas!” Mark replied, staring at Todd in confusion. “How could you not know that?”<br />
<br />
“What the hell are you talking about?!” Tod stamped his foot.<br />
<br />
“Reality has altered, Todd.” Rok said quietly. “I can only assume that Xavier used the book to change Troy. Mark’s been affected since he doesn’t have a book, but it won’t be long until Rusty and I are affected as well.” <br />
<br />
“So that means you two are going to become crooked henchmen to a mobster?!” <br />
<br />
“Not unless we can reverse the changes quickly,” Rusty said. <br />
<br />
“Are you done talking out there?!” Trevor called from the other room. “This job is pretty damn important!” <br />
<br />
“One more second boss!” Rok called back. He then lowered his voice and addressed the group much quieter than before. “Right now, just play along. We’ll think of something on the way. Understood?” <br />
<br />
Rusty, Mark, and Todd all nodded in understanding. <br />
<br />
Rok then opened the door to the bedroom and ushered everyone back inside. Trevor was now sitting up on the bed, still smoking his cigar. <br />
<br />
“Good, you’re back,” he said. “Now, I have a very important job I need you to take care of…” Trevor trailed off when he saw Todd and Mark. “Why are you two still here?” <br />
<br />
“They wish to join the family, boss!” Rusty said quickly. “They could accompany us on this job to prove their loyalty! I-If you’re okay with that, of course!” <br />
<br />
“Is that so?” the raccoon asked, scrutinizing the two foxes. <br />
<br />
The pair of foxes quickly nodded their heads in response. <br />
<br />
Trevor closed his eyes and thought for a moment. <br />
<br />
“Very well. I’ll let you two accompany my most loyal henchmen on this mission, but if you slip up once…” The raccoon grinned evilly. “I’ll turn the twink into a cocksleeve and the twunk into a buttplug, got it?”<br />
<br />
“Y-Yes sir, Mr. Trevor,” Mark stuttered. <br />
<br />
“We understand the consequences,” Todd added, fidgeting slightly. <br />
<br />
“Good,” Trevor said. “Now, about your job. I wish I didn’t have to make you do this, but I’m afraid I was left with no choice. Rusty, Rok, you two know who Xavier is.”<br />
<br />
Before either of them could object, the image of an athletic deer morph with white fur, a small beer belly, and the beginnings of a second chin appeared in their heads. Rusty put his hand on his left head, rubbing it slightly to try and soothe the small headache that it had gotten due to new memories beginning to trickle in.<br />
<br />
“Your lover, boss?” Rok asked. <br />
<br />
“<I>Former</I> lover,” Trevor corrected. “I had intended on having him join the mob, but first, I wanted to test his loyalty.” <br />
<br />
The raccoon held up his right hand, showing off his rings. <br />
<br />
“I made copies of my books and put them on to see if he was only pretending to love me in order to get close to my books. Unfortunately, that was the case. He stole the copies, and he is more than likely going to bring them to one of the Dolans that works for this casino. I want you to find him and take him out. Failure to do so will not be tolerated. Do I make myself clear?” <br />
<br />
“Yes boss,” Rok and Rusty said in unison. <br />
<br />
“But where are the real ones?” Todd asked.<br />
<br />
“Kinda nosy, huh?” The raccoon smirked and grabbed a remote and turned on the TV. He raised the sound as high as it would go and gestured for them to follow him. “Let’s hit the head before we leave.”<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
They piled into the rather spacious (though less so with the two hulking Myths) and well-appointed bathroom. Trevor turned on the shower and then the bathtub. Todd and Mark came in and stood awkwardly in a corner near the towels.<br />
<br />
“Close the door, you!” Trevor ordered Todd.<br />
<br />
Todd nodded and shut the door.<br />
<br />
“Boss, what’s-?” Rusty started to say.<br />
<br />
“Shhh!” Trevor said, and began turning on all the water faucets in the large bathroom and turned on the fan.<br />
<br />
Steam filled the room. Trevor motioned them closer.<br />
<br />
“What’s going on?” Rok asked. <br />
<br />
“We’re being watched. Dolan has listening devices all throughout the hotel. Our room is totally bugged. I placed the ones I found in here near the faucets, so he shouldn’t be able to hear us. The steam should block any cameras.” Trevor said in a loud, hushed tone.<br />
<br />
“Now, I trust all of you enough to tell you this and show you what I’m about to do. Yes, I remember you, Todd. Vaguely. Watch me when I put on the Books.”<br />
<br />
The half-nuki opened a cupboard and brought out a box of tissues and a bracelet. He stuffed the tissue in his nose and clasped the gold bracelet around his wrist. The half-nuki shook, tissue turning red, eyes rolling up into the back of his head.<br />
<br />
Todd smiled and breathed a sigh of relief. Now Trevor would have Troy’s memories. All would be well.<br />
<br />
The half-tanuki punched the mirror, screaming. It shattered,and the raccoon’s fist was bleeding, but the raccoon paid it all no mind. Todd’s heart sank.<br />
<br />
This was bad.<br />
<br />
“Boss?” Rusty growled. “You okay?”<br />
<br />
“God, I can’t believe what a fuckin’ pussy I was!” The raccoon snarled. <br />
<br />
“Sir?” Rok asked, brow furrowed in worry. “Troy?”<br />
<br />
“Stop calling me Troy, gods dammit!” The coon threw the box of tissues at the cyclop’s face.  “He was weak! I ain’t weak!”<br />
<br />
“But you were nice!” Todd protested.<br />
<br />
“Shut the fuck up Todd, literally no one cares!” Trevor snarled. “If it wasn’t for my fucking traitor boyfriend, you’d be a cum-brained satyr! Or worse, tied up by Mark and getting plowed like a little whiny bitch!”<br />
<br />
“That’s worse?” Mark asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes! Christ, have some hobbies beyond bondage-play.”<br />
<br />
“Well so-orry, Troy, I thought your elder abuse saga was over, but I guess not!” Todd snapped back.<br />
<br />
“Elder?” Trevor blinked. “I’m only 102. I’ve got a few more centuries before…you know what, never mind. Go fuck yourself.”<br />
<br />
“Calm down.” Rusty growled.<br />
<br />
Trevor snarled, rounding on him, but took a deep breath. “Fine. I apologize. Now, do you guys wanna stop this deer or what? He needs to be dealt with.”<br />
<br />
“He’s your boyfriend.”<br />
<br />
“A terrible one.” Trevor reached into the cupboard and withdrew a case. He unsnapped it, revealing six guns and rubber bullets. “These are spell guns. Lending out Books or even making copies is risky. Could fall into the wrong hands. These babies are coded to fire only for the proper wielder.”<br />
<br />
Trevor handed them out and walked them through coding the guns to themselves.<br />
<br />
“We don’t have a lot of time. I’m going to get turned back into a pussy in about half an hour. We need to neutralize our target by then.” Trevor popped out a clip of rubber bullets. “These babies have spells imprinted on them. Real nice ones that’ll take your opponents out of the picture. No reality warping, but the subject won’t be in the mind to do anything regardless.”<br />
<br />
“Like what?” Mark asked, admiring his chromed-out gun.<br />
<br />
“Dildos, ferals that turn into statues or some other art object, usually while doing something lewd.” Trevor counted them off on his fingers, “Themed plushies, clothing, little tchotchkes, the basic idea is that they are all small and easily concealable inanimate objects.”<br />
<br />
“But why do you want to take out Xavier if you know you’re going to regret it later?” Todd asked.<br />
<br />
“Because he <I>is</I> a threat, and I need to deal with him eventually.” Trevor shrugged. “I’ve got the balls-no pun intended-to do what has to be done. Any other objections?”<br />
<br />
They were silent.<br />
<br />
“Good,” Trevor said. “He’s more than likely on the Body floor. See to it that the job is done quickly.” <br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
On that note, the group left the room and closed the door behind them. None of them said a word as they left the suite and walked down the hallway to the elevator. Once all four of them were in the elevator, Todd broke the silence. <br />
<br />
“I don’t like that you guys just casually went along with Trevor’s orders to kill Xavier…” the fox said. “You didn’t protest or anything!” <br />
<br />
“Of course, we didn’t protest!” Rusty said, sounding a bit nervous. “You can’t just tell a mob boss no!” <br />
<br />
“But he’s not a mob boss,” Todd countered. “He’s Troy.” <br />
<br />
“He won’t be Troy for a while,” Rok said. “Xarxos…I mean, Xavier…stole the copies of Troy’s books thinking they were the real deal. He then used them to turn Troy into Trevor. That means that while reality has been altered, the changes aren’t permanent. We just need to find Xavier and fix this mess before things get too out of hand.” <br />
<br />
“How long do the changes caused by copy books usually last?” Mark asked. <br />
<br />
“It honestly depends on the spell, but they usually last around an hour or two. Hopefully, it’ll wear off sooner rather than later.” The elevator stopped moving, and the doors opened a second later, revealing the floor of Body. <br />
<br />
“So what’s the plan if we find him?” Rusty asked. “Do we take him back to the boss…I mean, Troy?” <br />
<br />
“No, we take him out on the spot,” Rok replied. The look on his face suddenly shifted to one of confusion. “Shit, the effects are starting to catch up. If we don’t hurry, I or Rusty might end up killing Xavier.” <br />
<br />
“Then we have to act fast!” Mark said. “Do either of you recall what he’s wearing?” <br />
<br />
“If I remember correctly, I think he’s wearing a green Biller Lite t-shirt with a pair of camo shorts,” Rusty spoke up. “I’m…not entirely sure how I knew that…” <br />
<br />
“New memories,” Todd said. “We need to start looking for him, now!” <br />
<br />
The fox quickly ran over to a bench and climbed on top of it, scanning the sea of people. A few passersby gave him weird looks, but he didn’t pay them any mind. He didn’t have the time to. <br />
<br />
“Any sign of him?” Mark asked, climbing onto the bench next to his and scanning the crowd as well. <br />
<br />
“No, not yet…” the orange-furred fox replied. “I see some deer, but none of them are wearing green shirts…wait a sec!” <br />
<br />
The vulpine’s eyes landed on a white stag morph walking past the bar. He was wearing a green shirt that was stretched by his small beer gut and a pair of camo shorts. Jackpot. <br />
<br />
“I see him!” Todd shouted, pointing at the stag. “He’s over there by the bar!” <br />
<br />
“Then let’s move!” Rusty shouted, running off in the direction that Todd pointed. <br />
<br />
Rok followed close behind him, leaving Todd and Mark behind. The white-furred fox hopped off the bench before quickly moving to help his orange counterpart down. <br />
<br />
“They just ran off without us…” Mark said, looking in the direction that the two Myths had gone. <br />
<br />
“Probably because they think they have a job to do,” Todd explained. “C’mon, let’s hurry before the reality shift makes them do anything drastic.” <br />
<br />
The two foxes ran after Rusty and Rok, pushing their way through crowds of anthros. They made their way through the crowd just in time to see Rok and Rusty by the railing, looking down at the ground floor. <br />
<br />
“Where the hell did he go?!” Rusty snarled. “He was literally right here just a second ago!” <br />
<br />
“The boss isn’t gonna be happy if we don’t find him…” Rok growled. “Why the hell did you let him get away?!” <br />
<br />
“<i>I</i> let him get away?” Rusty snapped, his three heads growling at the cyclops. “You were the one who was close enough to grab him!” <br />
<br />
“I could’ve grabbed him if your stupid head didn’t get in the way!” the cyclops replied, shoving Rusty to the side. <br />
<br />
“You’re just blaming me instead of your own lack of depth perception, you one-eyed fuck!” the Cerberus-morph snarled. <br />
<br />
As the two Myths fought, neither of them noticed their clothing changing into suits, complete with red ties. <br />
<br />
Todd noticed, however. <br />
<br />
He quickly ran to the railing and peered over the side. The fox searched the crowd as quickly as he could until his eyes landed on the same deer from before. He started to say something but quickly realized that probably wouldn’t be the best idea. If he said something to Rok and Rusty, they’d just run after Xavier and scare him off again. He had to stop him quickly and quietly without causing too much of a scene. Then, an idea came to mind. <br />
<br />
The fox pointed at Xavier with his left hand before quietly whispering “Alteration.” <br />
<br />
Immediately after, Todd watched as Xavier fell flat on the ground. The stag tried to get back up, only to stop when he realized that his legs were gone. <br />
<br />
“Wh-What the fuck?!” Xavier shouted, getting the attention of everyone around him, including Rok and Rusty. <br />
<br />
“Shit!” Todd muttered and grabbed Mark, “Come on!”<br />
<br />
Before the two Myths could do anything stupid, Todd and Mark rushed down the escalator and stopped in front of the legless deer. <br />
<br />
“Oh…hey Todd…Mark…,” Xavier said upon seeing the foxes. “So, uh, funny story…” <br />
<br />
“Save it,” Todd said. “You’re not running away now.” <br />
<br />
“What the…? You did this to me, didn’t you?!” <br />
<br />
“Yep.” <br />
<br />
Before Xavier could respond, the sound of slow clapping came from behind Todd. <br />
<br />
The fox turned around and saw Trevor approaching him, with Rok and Rusty following close behind. The raccoon was dressed in a black suit with a red tie and a black fedora. He really looked like the stereotypical mobsters that were common back in the 1920s. Behind him were two more creatures, an anthro Stegosaurus and a Kirin. <br />
<br />
“Well, I must say that I’m rather impressed,” the raccoon mobster said. “I didn’t think you had it in you, kid. You’ve more than earned your place in the family. Pick him up, Rusty.” <br />
<br />
“Yes boss,” the canine replied.<br />
<br />
As he walked past Todd and Mark, the two foxes noticed that Rusty seemed a bit bigger…more muscular. He bent down and slung the stag over his shoulder. <br />
<br />
When he turned around, everyone could see that he was now wearing a pair of shades on each head. What scared Todd most was that his heads had changed. His brows were thick and his faces were stuck in permanent scowls, jaws wide, his teeth thrusting up like a bulldog’s.<br />
<br />
“Fuck, this isn’t good…” Todd said under his breath. “Rok, what do we…” <br />
<br />
The fox trailed off when he saw that the same changes had happened to Rok. He was somehow bigger and burlier than he already was, with a specially designed shade for his single eye, brow protruding, jaw heavier, tusks bigger. <br />
<br />
“You say somethin’?” The cyclops asked, his voice now much deeper. <br />
<br />
“N-No…” Todd replied. <br />
<br />
How had Rusty and Rok changed so quickly?! Shouldn’t the books have protected them for a bit longer? <br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, kid.” Rok smirked and flexed an over-sized arm, roided-out muscles popping. “You’re gonna love initiation. Wonder what he’ll change you into…”<br />
<br />
“C-change?” Tod blinked.<br />
<br />
“Take him somewhere private,” Trevor the raccoon pointed to the door of the men’s bathroom not far from where they were currently standing, next to the horse-race VR game. “That bathroom will do.” <br />
<br />
“Yes sir,” Rusty replied. He carried the legless stag to the bathroom, with Trevor, Rok, Todd, and Mark all following close behind. <br />
<br />
“Rok, check the stalls,” the raccoon ordered. “Make sure no one’s in here.” <br />
<br />
The cyclops nodded and went to each stall, kicking the door open and looking inside. “No one’s here boss!” <br />
<br />
“Perfect. Put him down, Rusty.” The canine did as he was told while Trevor locked the bathroom door. He then reached into his coat and pulled out a handgun, pointing it at Xavier. <br />
<br />
The deer’s eyes widened upon seeing the gun. “H-Hey, what are you doing?!” he asked, stuttering slightly. “C-Come Trevor…I’m your husband! Don’t you remember?” <br />
<br />
“What I remember is you being a dirty, thieving rat who tried to steal my books,” Trevor replied. “Those rings you stole were only clones. I wanted to test your loyalty and make sure you wouldn’t stab us in the back, and what did you do?”&#8232;&#8232;“I-I wasn’t trying to backstab you, Trev!” Xavier shouted, his body shaking as the raccoon got closer. “I…I was doing this for your own good! Please, you gotta trust me!” <br />
<br />
“After you completely betrayed my trust?” <br />
<br />
Xavier hung his head.<br />
<br />
“Thought so,” Trevor paced. “There’s a reason I chose this bathroom. No surveillance in here. This is where the Dolans reality shift losers of the horse races. Cameras wouldn’t survive the constant shifts.”<br />
<br />
“Smart, Boss!” Rusty’s heads grinned.<br />
<br />
Trevor cocked his gun and pointed it at Xavier.<br />
<br />
“Wonder what bullet this one is?” The half-nuki smirked.<br />
<br />
Before this could go any further, Todd stepped in front of Xavier, blocking Trevor’s shot. <br />
<br />
“What are you doing, Todd?” the raccoon asked. “Get out of the way so I can shoot this traitorous bastard.” <br />
<br />
“I’m not letting you kill Xarxos,” the fox said firmly. <br />
<br />
Trevor sighed and shook his head. “A pity,” he said. “And here I thought you’d make a great addition to the family.” <br />
<br />
He snapped his fingers, and before Todd could react, Rusty grabbed him and forced him to his knees. <br />
<br />
“Hey! What the fuck Rusty?! What do you think you’re doing?!” <br />
<br />
“Sorry kid,” the Cerberus-morph replied. “Boss&#39;s orders.”&#8232;&#8232;“What are you doing?!” Mark shouted. “Let go of him!” <br />
<br />
The white-furred fox tried to make his way over to Todd, but Rok quickly grabbed him and forced him to his knees as well. <br />
<br />
“Guys, what the hell are you doing?!” Todd shouted. “We’re supposed to be fixing all this!” <br />
<br />
“If your definition of ‘fixing’ means betraying the boss, then I’m out,” Rok growled. <br />
<br />
“We’re loyal henchmen!” Rusty added. “We’d never dream of betraying the boss!” <br />
<br />
“Now to deal with the traitor.” The DILF-y half-nuki had stripped off his pants, unsnapping his suspenders, and tossed his boxers away, revealing his thick cock, huge furry balls, and thick hairy legs. Trevor sauntered over to the buck and pointed his finger. “Inanimate.”<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
“Please, don’t!” Xavier pleaded as his felt himself shiver involuntarily and tasted copper. “I was only trying to support you!”<br />
<br />
“Oh, don’t worry Xavier,” Trevor smirked. “You’ll be a big supporter when I’m done with you.”<br />
<br />
The half-tanuki straddled the buck’s midsection, letting his gut settle on the buck’s face.<br />
<br />
Xavier felt the cold tile floor beneath him and realized he was naked, his clothes somehow disappearing in the space of seconds. For some reason, the raccoon straddling him, musky gunt and thick cock throbbing in front of him and fluffy tail brushing his own cock had him achingly erect. He could feel the tanuki’s big balls pulsing gently on his chest.<br />
<br />
They were so warm, much better than the cold tile floor. Xavier pressed up against the Tanuki’s package.His mouth opened and the half-nuki leaned forward, gripping the back of the buck’s head and gently slid his thick meat into the deer’s mouth.<br />
<br />
Trevor pressed further forward, and Xavier swallowed, mouth feeling dry, as the cock slipped down his throat. The half-nuki’s pressed forward, pulling the buck closer, and Xavier had the oddest sensation of his chest and stomach cupping and flexing around the big half-nuki’s balls.<br />
<br />
Xavier didn’t know it, but his fur was changing into plush white fabric, converting bit by bit. <br />
<br />
He did feel oddly sensitive, a strange pleasure wracking him with each insistent tug. His stitching stretched around the orbs like he was giving his lover a hug. It was so satisfying, each individual fiber rubbing against each other in a tight weave. The buck shivered in delight and airily moaned.<br />
<br />
The half-nuki leaned over his prodigious belly and caught the buck’s blissed-out expression.<br />
<br />
“I see you’re enjoying your new…’supporting’ role, Xavier.” The tanuki chuckled. “You make a fine jockstrap.”<br />
<br />
jock strap?! <br />
<br />
Xavier tried to pull his mind away from the pleasant sensation of becoming an object, though it was hard. He managed an angry glare, though even that was half-hearted.<br />
<br />
“Oh, don’t be like that!” Trevor wagged a thick digit in front of the buck’s flattening nose. “Here, hold up my package for me. You’ll find you have too much on your mind to be angry.”<br />
<br />
The half-nuki shoved Xavier forward, pressing his cock further into the former-buck’s head. The thick cock and hefty testes filled the space where Xavier’s brain had been and the fabric <I> stretched</I>.<br />
<br />
Xavier could feel him behind his eyes, hot and warm and soft, straining his padding. The half-nuki’s thick shaft invaded the transforming buck’s thoughts, pushing out all others with the mental image of the tanuki’s junk stretching his seams so pleasurably.<br />
<br />
Head filled with cock and musk, Xavier could barely focus on the changes.Arms wrapping around his owner-lover’s waist, thinning, becoming elastic. The bucks legs thinned and became straps, pulling up unnaturally to connect with his hands, holding Xavier snug to the nuki’s crotch. He was lightening, losing body mass, tail fluttering and transforming into another strap. It stretched to connect with the band around the nuki’s waist as well, lifting his crotch and throbbing cock up to the tanuki’s glistening tail-hole.<br />
<br />
Xavier felt so taught and stretched out. He held tight to the nuki, making his fur fluff around him. He felt so good, so hard, enjoying the nuki’s balls warmly pulse in him.<br />
<br />
Trevor leaned back, paw gripping-oddly-the back of Trevor&#39;s cock. It hardened even more, stiff and needy, and the raccoon slowly sat back onto the buck’s rubbery cock, moaning as it slid smoothly inside his rectum. The butt-plug locked into place and Xavier tightened and shrunk more.<br />
<br />
Xavier’s mind was a mess, enjoying the squeeze of his lovers hole around his rubber cock and the sag of his balls on his tightening fabric. As the tanuki rocked himself on the floor, sending the plug deeper, his cock twitched, scrambling the former buck’s thoughts.<br />
<br />
Another twitch, and the tanuki’s semi began to grow, erasing the buck’s facial features as the half-nuki’s package stretched him as it hardened. He was so tight around the raccoon’s cock and his fabric was so sensitive! He could feel every ridge and bulge of the cock as if it were his own dick being rubbed.<br />
<br />
The jockstrap squirmed, the movement eliciting an appreciative huff from the husky raccoon above him.<br />
<br />
“Fuck yeah, just like that, babe.” Trevor panted. “I’m gonna fill you up.”<br />
<br />
The jockstrap tried to move some more, enjoying the stretch and the throb and the musk.<br />
<br />
The half-nuki’s tongue lolled out as the jockstrap milked him. His cock rose to full mast.<br />
<br />
Xavier couldn’t move anymore, the back of his head tented by the thick dick. He felt warmth and moistness as Trevor’s cock dribbled pre into his fabric. It soaked in, the sweetness and musk scrambling his thoughts further.<br />
<br />
“Can’t move now, huh?” Trevor’s cock jumped, leaking more liquid warmth into Xavier’s fibers. “I guess this is goodbye, then.”<br />
<br />
Xavier tried to formulate a response, but the wetness was seeping into his thoughts and they all felt so slippery. His wearer reached down and gripped his cock through his fabric with one wide paw. The he started rubbing, and Xavier began to lose his sense of self. It felt like his whole body was being jerked. <br />
<br />
His thoughts were completely jumbled, consumed with the hardness that occupied his mind. It was close, it was going to shoot soon. The jockstrap knew that by the way the balls were tensing. He couldn’t let it do that because then it would lose itself…<br />
<br />
The rubbing was growing intense, smoothing his thoughts away. It knew it had been something before, but why would it want to be anything other than what it was?<br />
<br />
The jockstrap gave one feeble wriggle.<br />
<br />
“Oh...!” Trevor gasped and his cock spewed cum.<br />
<br />
The cock inside his mind tensed rhythmically, cum spraying his insides in great spurts. The jockstrap found his thoughts lost in the rhythm and the warmth as the cum soaked into him, his owner so warm and deliciously musky.<br />
<br />
Tense and flex.<br />
<br />
Tense and flex.<br />
<br />
Tense and flex.<br />
<br />
The white cock holster lost consciousness as its mind filled with spooge.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
Trevor’s hips stopped bucking. Cum oozed through the fabric and dripped onto the puddle of semen on the floor, some of it dribbling down his furry thighs. He slipped the jockstrap off and held it in front of him. <br />
<br />
“Whoops! Sorry about that, Xavier. Guess I made a mess!” The nuki grinned wickedly and wrung the jockstrap out with a lewd squelch, cum sieving through the fabric, taking whatever was left of Xavier’s mind with it. The half-nuki tossed the soggy jock on the floor, where it splatted wetly. “Let him dry out. In a day or two, have him washed for later.” <br />
<br />
“Jockstrap for support!” Rok snorted. “Good one boss!”<br />
<br />
“I’m a poet and I didn’t know it!” Trevor snickered.<br />
<br />
“No, you’re an asshole.” Mark muttered.<br />
<br />
Rok cuffed him on the ear and Mark winced.<br />
<br />
“What’d he say?” Trevor snarled. “Something about me?”<br />
<br />
Rok nodded.<br />
<br />
“Enough talk,” Trevor said calmly. He approached Todd and pressed the handgun up against his forehead. “Any last words before I turn you and your friend into my new rugs?” <br />
<br />
“Yeah, I’ve got some last words,” Todd said. “I hope you realize what you’re doing.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I’m plenty aware of what I’m doing. I’m getting rid of those who’d dare oppose my organization.” <br />
<br />
“No, you’re making it easier for Dolan to win.” <br />
<br />
Trevor’s grip on the gun loosened slightly. “What do you mean?” <br />
<br />
“Well, he told me not to tell anyone, so I don’t think that I-” The fox was cut off by a strong kick to the gut. He doubled over, gasping for air. <br />
<br />
“What the fuck is wrong with you?!” Mark shouted. He struggled against Rok’s grip to try and rush to his boyfriend’s side, but the cyclops’ grip only got tighter. “Asshole!”<br />
<br />
“Asshole?” Trevor grinned and walked over to Mark.<br />
<br />
“Please, no, he-Guh!” Todd tried to protest, but the Cerberus stuck a padded finger into Todd’s hole.<br />
<br />
“Shh, you’ll get yours soon.” Rusty whispered, flexing his finger, making Todd whimper. “You tell him what he wants, and it don’t have to be painful like this. Maybe he’ll turn ya into a Dick Weasel. Boss invented them. Basically a living cocksleeve.”<br />
<br />
Todd could only gasp and squirm as Trevor knelt in front of his boyfriend.<br />
<br />
Trevor pointed at Mark. “Shape. Inanimate.”<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
Mark gasped, feeling the shiver and tell-tale taste of copper in his mouth twice. What was Trevor transforming him into? He got his answer when he felt a pulse strike his whole body.<br />
<br />
He felt a chill run down his body and over his tail as his wonderful fluff receded and his tail shrank, colors dulling into a warm brown. As he reached back to touch it, the tail slid back under his touch, leaving a wriggling nub. <br />
<br />
Another pulse surged through his body, pulling him in all directions. He gasped, his clothes growing tighter around him like they were shrinking. The bathroom was filled with the soft sound of creaking as his clothes began to fray at the seams. <br />
<br />
The pulse came again and he gasped as his whole body grew larger. All the seams on his clothing popped, stitching tearing free. Another surge and his clothes fell to the ground in tatters, his body swelling.<br />
<br />
Mark tried to stop it, but the surge of growth pulsed faster and faster through him. His height grew along with his body, the ceiling quickly rushing towards him. He felt terrified but…oddly pleased. His muscles were growing along with his body. Powerful. That was how he truly felt.<br />
<br />
The changing fox moaned as his neck began to swell and his voice grew deeper, and all that came out was a pleasurable rumble. He shot Todd a look of regret and tried to saw something, but no intelligible words came out. Just a deep growl that echoed in the bathroom. <br />
<br />
A surge of warmth ran through his body. He felt his belly swell, the fur on top shortening and turning brown. The former fox ran his hands over his new gut, feeling it as it continued to grow, warm fat pressing out around his fingers, swelling further and further from his body. As fat filled in the rest of his still-growing form, the rest of the white fluff on his body pulled back and shifted into thicker, shorter brown fur.<br />
<br />
As he felt his steadily fattening form, his hands cramped and twisted, swelling larger and wider. Fur pushed out around his joints and his pads became rougher, well-used. His fingers pulled back, fattening as the claws that tipped them grew long and black. His thumb receded up his wrist and all he had left were huge, useless paws.<br />
<br />
Mark’s body continued to swell with muscle and fat and it began to weigh on him. He grew heavier and heavier until finally, his body shook, back pulling tight, and his lengthening spine popped. The weight of his over-full belly pulled him down to the floor. Mark panicked and held out his paws. They thumped heavily on the ground, the impact sending a shock-wave through his fat form.<br />
<br />
He looked back between his forearms, the shifting fur climbing up along them to meet the fur on his broad, over-muscled shoulders. Behind his heavy, fat laden body, he could see his legs and feet growing thicker, becoming hindlegs and massive rear paws.<br />
<br />
The transformation moved beyond his thick, muscular neck to his head. could feel his face starting to change, swelling and distorting, teeth growing larger in a thicker jaw. Mark crossed his eyes as his dainty fox muzzle stretch and widened into a large muzzle tipped by a large black nose. Without a thought he flicked out his thick tongue and licked the new nose.<br />
<br />
Pressure started to fill his head as his skull started to reshape, growing larger under the thick layer of fat and dark fur. Round ears grew over his head and his eyes grew smaller, fat eyebrows falling into his vision. Thinking was a struggle, his mind feeling cramped, brain shrinking.<br />
<br />
The overfed brown bear let out a grumble, feeling sleepy.<br />
<br />
The air was cool to the overheated and sleepy bear, and he just wanted to lay down and relax. <br />
<br />
So he did, splaying out in an odd fashion, arms and legs askew. <br />
<br />
The bear felt flat. Every muscle in his body was relaxing, tension fading.<br />
<br />
His rear paws gave way first, muscles and bones dissolving gently and painlessly. The bear-who had a name once, but it was too hard to remember it, and did it matter anyways?-paid it no mind. <br />
<br />
His legs quickly followed suit, leaving only furry hide behind. The bear’s groin receded into nothingness, his wide furry rear flattening, fat and muscle fizzling away. Flush with the floor, completely flat, like... <br />
<br />
…Like a rug.<br />
<br />
The bear struggled to pull himself up. His front legs fumbled, but managed to move, but his rear legs were so…relaxed and pleasant, they just didn’t want to respond to his commands. The bear turned his massive muzzle and saw what was happening to him.<br />
<br />
His back half had simply deflated, transformed into a bear skin rug. The change moved further up, past his lovely limp tail, and into his gut. The voluminous thing gurgled and began to deflate, spreading thick, buttery brown fur across the floor. He was so overheated and the floor was so cool.<br />
<br />
The bear dropped its head back down and managed a wheezing grumble as his chest flattened, ribs straining and then dissolving, chest flattening against the floor. His neck felt odd and popped when his shoulders flattened, leaving the bear staring straight ahead, unable to move.<br />
<br />
He could only watch as his arms wriggled, then sank, then suddenly splayed outwards, nothing but thin, furry hide. The claws remained as if to remind the world that a powerful bear was sleeping here.<br />
<br />
The bear’s neck flattened and then it hit his head-<br />
<br />
He began to feel a strange fizzing sensation, strange flashing happening in his head, behind his eyes. His eyeballs hardened and fixed at a distant spot somewhere…his head felt lighter, emptier and emptier, and then the bear’s mind was filled with gentle fizzing and popping and he found himself drifting off to sleep, mouth agape, fizzing and popping and peaceful and relaxed and…<br />
<br />
The bearskin rug lay still on the floor, lifeless.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
“Roll him up and have him shipped to the Cabin.” Trevor ordered.<br />
<br />
Rok dutifully rolled the bearskin rug up and held it under his arm.<br />
<br />
“Y-you’re making a big mistake!” Todd gasped, squirming, cock aching. Rusty hadn’t stopped playing with his ass and the fox was panting.<br />
<br />
Trevor reached over and grabbed Todd’s muzzle, pulling the fox up to look at him. <br />
<br />
“You’re going to tell me what Dolan told you right now, or else I’m going to beat you half to death.” Trevor smiled sinisterly. “And just before you pass out, I’m gonna turn you into a literal punching bag.”<br />
<br />
“Just co-operate, Todd.” Rusty whispered, knuckle bumping Todd’s prostate, making him moan. “And he’ll make you feel real good.“<br />
<br />
“Alright, alright!” Todd wheezed. “Dolan doesn’t want you knowing…what book I have…” <br />
<br />
“But I already know that you have the Book of Body,” the raccoon said. “I watched you use it to get rid of the traitor’s legs.” <br />
<br />
“But are you sure that I <i>only</i> have the Book of Body?” the fox asked, a smug grin appearing on his muzzle. <br />
<br />
Trevor growled and punched Todd’s muzzle, making him wince in pain. A bit of blood began to dribble from his mouth and nose. <br />
<br />
“It’s alright, bud.” Rusty’s finger wriggled in Todd’s ass, striking his sweet spot, and his left head nuzzled the fox’s neck. “Don’t play coy, be respectful.”<br />
<br />
“What else do you have?!” the raccoon snarled, bearing his fangs at the fox. <br />
<br />
They were playing ‘good cop, bad cop’, Todd realized. He wasn’t getting out of here unless he told the complete truth. So he did.<br />
<br />
“The…The same books you have,” Todd said slowly. He really wished that he could clench his jaw right about now. Trevor could really pack a punch. “Those…those are all the books Dolan would need to win. He’d just need…to take out Arcane…” <br />
<br />
“So you’re telling me that you have the books of Beast, Body, Transmutation, Myth, and Divination? I fail to see how that should stop me from killing you.” <br />
<br />
“You can’t use my books, since you already have them. Dolan, however, can.” Todd paused, letting it sink in. “What’s going to stop one of his numerous versions from swooping in and taking my book after you kill me?”<br />
<br />
“Paradox.” Trevor rolled his eyes.<br />
<br />
“My reality is only 0.02% different from yours, so Paradox wouldn’t be an issue. Any one of them could swoop in and take you out in a heartbeat once they get their hands on my book, and your chance at becoming a god would be taken away from you just like that.”<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;“Enough!” Trevor shouted. “I’m not going to listen to your lies any longer!” <br />
<br />
Just then, the sound of someone pounding on the door made Trevor turn to look at it. The half-nuke sighed in annoyance and walked over to the door, pushing it open and sticking his head out. <br />
<br />
“What do you want, idiot?” Trevor snarled, pointing his gun out the door at someone.<br />
<br />
“Uh…the floor is clearing out boss,” a voice said. Probably either the stegosaurus or the Kirin. “It’s kinda weird…”<br />
<br />
Trevor looked around a little, seemingly checking if the creature’s claim was true or not. Todd’s eyes widened as he realized that he was being bought extra time. Whether this was intentional or unintentional, the fox didn’t care. Whoever knocked on the door was his hero.<br />
<br />
“Huh….guess the floor is clear,” Trevor said. “Fine, just keep standing guard! I have a traitor to take care of!”<br />
<br />
The raccoon closed the door behind him and walked back over to the fox kneeling on the ground. He pressed the gun against Todd’s forehead and rested a finger on the trigger. “Say goodbye…” <br />
<br />
Todd closed his eyes, praying to any God who would listen to make his transformation a pleasant one.</p>
