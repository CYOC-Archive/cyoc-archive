<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the night started its journey to dawn, the married couples within the Anderson, Twist, and Stovall households slept in relatively peaceful slumber.<br />
<br />
After a passionate session of romantic lovemaking, Melissa Stovall fell asleep within her husband&#39;s arms. Martin held her close the whole night, knowing that the ten year courtship was the one dark cloud between them in an otherwise beautiful romance.<br />
<i>I love her. I waited for her, and I will still love her well beyond the day my remains are scattered out to the seven seas,</i> he realized, bending his head forward to brush away a lock of his wife&#39;s blonde hair before kissing her forehead when she stirred in the middle of the night. <i>Mers have a couple of hundred years together easy, and we&#39;ll spend every possible moment of that together. Perhaps a weekend getaway for two sometime soon...</i><br />
<br />
After a second heated session of hot, were sex; William and Martha Anderson fell asleep in each other&#39;s paws, the top knot of his hard fox penis buried deep in her werecat vagina. While neither would recall details come the dawn, they both shared contented thoughts of a happy future together.<br />
William would eventually earn tenure at Moon Lake College. Martha would establish herself as a quite capable elementary school teacher, even earning the coveted Teacher of the Year award twice, before having to take a short break to welcome their werecat daughter into the world. Nate would eventually marry Alex, Julie Stovall would one day become Mrs. Eric Anderson...<br />
Life and the future looked very promising for them all.<br />
<br />
Samantha and Frances Twist still slept on the couch together, curled up in each others furry arms. The werecat couple wouldn&#39;t know they actually purred the night away in unison until Ben revealed that fact in the morning.<br />
Samantha dreamed of winning re-election as Town Chancellor next year as part of Mayor Stovall&#39;s team, despite some of the more tenser moments Moon Lake faced of late, and being with her loving wife forever as their adopted son completed high school and went on to college.<br />
Frances had similar dreams of married life, but a few stray thoughts of welcoming a partner into her practice as she took a short maternity break to take care of the Twists&#39; new born werecat daughter entered her subconscious mind as well. But such details as who this other doctor was and how Frances had actually conceived the child remained unknown to her, especially since she kept insisting to her physician, OB/GYN, and anyone else who asked that Samantha <b>WAS</b> the father. Why they didn&#39;t believe her, even when the medical evidence supported her claim, was beyond Frances...<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the children of our main cast were having comforting visions too.<br />
Ben Twist dreamed of Kenya Adaeze. Running through the forest together. Just sitting and talking on &quot;their&quot; log.<br />
His subconscious mind explored the possibilities of the future. Dating, engagement, marriage...<br />
There was something truly unique about Kenya. Just being next to her on the back porch of the Twist home was special. The sparkle of her eyes, even in her human form. The softness of her fur...<br />
He had never met another woman like her before, and that might be the answer. Except for his mothers, some of his teachers, and his pack leader&#39;s wife; every female Ben ever had any prolonged contact with had been around his age.<br />
While those relationships were all right, and the sex great, perhaps something was missing from his life.<br />
Whatever the answer was, Ben wanted to be with Kenya for a mighty long time to come...<br />
<br />
Nate Anderson dreamed of a life with Alex Ramsey beyond high school and college.<br />
He could foresee where there would be times when either one or both of them had trouble with their school work, but never to the point where it would threaten level advancement or graduations.<br />
Nate dreamed of a day when the two of them shared the same dwelling as a married couple, but for some reason was uncertain where that place was; because Nate also saw himself as the mascot of his favorite basketball team. The Minnesota Timberwolves would never know they now had a real (were)wolf for a mascot.<br />
Meanwhile, Alex&#39;s first cookbook: <i>Food Prep and the Single Man</i> had just been released and was doing gang buster sales!<br />
In a couple of years when their respective schedules settled down to whatever passed for &quot;normal&quot; in an adult&#39;s life, maybe they&#39;d even start investigating the possibility of adoption...<br />
<br />
There was no question in Eric Anderson&#39;s mind that he loved Julie Stovall, and that someday he would not only become her were-merman, but that they would get married and live happily ever after.<br />
The problem was tonight, every time he thought about it in his dreams, even though the sequence order of events was still basically the same, the timeline kept changing.<br />
First it was induction into were society at 18, during a very romantic summer night together on the shores of Moon Lake after they graduated high school, followed by their marriage four years later after college graduation.<br />
The next time he knowingly dreamed of her, Julie transformed Eric when they gave their virginity to each other in a very private and romantic ceremony together on the first Valentine&#39;s Day after both of them had turned 16, followed by their parentally blessed wedding during the summer between high school graduation and the start of college.<br />
But now, despite still being sound asleep, Eric tossed and turned in the throes of passion.<br />
They both loved each other so much they couldn&#39;t wait anymore.<br />
A trail of clothes led to the water&#39;s edge, the only indication that Eric was now enjoying life as a were-mer.<br />
Every inch of Julie&#39;s body, whether as a human or in one of her were-mermaid stages, was pure sexual bliss to explore.<br />
Her luscious curves, the pleasures of her bosom and the treasure between her legs, the tastes, the sensations...<br />
Even the feeling of his scaled tail brushing against hers was quite erotic.<br />
As Eric woke up from his erotic dreams to find another sticky white mess between his legs within his pajama bottoms, one stray thought crossed his mind.<br />
<i>November???</i><br />
<br />
Julie Stovall found herself having similar dreams. Thoughts of her boyfriend Eric filled her night, but they were jumbled too, like trying to navigate through a cross-current during a rough storm.<br />
For whatever reason (perhaps because Eric woke up?), her last dream of them was not quite the same.<br />
She saw them express the physical aspects of their love together for the first time.<br />
This was something they both wanted, desired, and could wait no longer to experience.<br />
She had faithfully taken the were-mer birth control pill that day and knew her parents were away...<br />
But when???<br />
<br />
While most of those who did dream had relatively happy thoughts that night, not everyone was so blessed.<br />
At 4:30 that morning, while Eric Anderson was cleaning up his nocturnal mess, Jennifer Harper awoke screaming within her fiance&#39;s furry arms!</p>
