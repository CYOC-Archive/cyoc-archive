<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenny was devastated. She had lost everything, literally. Her life as she knew it was over, she could never see her family and friends again, even her own body was no longer entirely human. All that she had left was her boyfriend, who had done all of this to her on a whim, and her hopes that he would move on from this cruel &quot;game&quot; - and let them use the Chronivac for something more fun and less existentially terrifying. But as soon as he started bringing that hussy Mara into <i>their</i> home - a house she was starting to feel belonged to her, since she had nowhere else to go, but also because she could explore parts of it no one else could reach - that last remaining hope started to break down.<br />
<br />
Jeff spent a lot more time fucking Mara and a lot less time secretly pleasuring Jenny. Ever since the time he pulled himself off of Jenny to find that she&#39;d been smashed flat under his thrusting weight, unable to hold her human shape even when she wanted to, Jeff seemed to lose interest in his captive. He was taking Mara out on expensive dinner dates, while Jenny started missing meals because Jeff would neglect to bring her anything. If it wasn&#39;t for her new abilities that let her hide all curled up inside the kitchen cupboard, snacking on leftovers while Jeff&#39;s family ate in the next room, she might have been left to starve. It was almost like Jeff was on the verge of forgetting about her entirely, just like everybody else on earth already had.<br />
<br />
So why did she find it all so... incredibly... hot?<br />
<br />
Spying on Jeff&#39;s family and his new girlfriend from vantage points they would never have suspected, cramming herself into the inch-wide spaces between inner and outer walls, hiding under the couch and the fridge and the bathroom sink - everywhere she went in the tiny part of the world she was left with, arousal was screaming at her. Most of the time, she resisted the temptation, afraid that it would get her caught one way or another. But she often gave in and started fingering herself, with fingers that effortlessly stretched into the perfect shape for hitting all her most sensitive spots at once.<br />
<br />
She was angry about her situation, that was for sure. And she was frightened to her core when the thought crossed her mind that Jeff might never let her out of this prison that her life had become. But her insatiably horny feelings seemed to override anything else, and that scared her even more. Why was she so into this? She never would have fantasized about these bizarre, impossible things before, and the reality was far worse than the fantasy. What was wrong with her?<br />
<br />
She suspected she knew the answer - Jeff could easily have warped her mind and given her these fetishes with the Chronivac. But she&#39;d been watching him like a hawk this whole time and couldn&#39;t remember seeing him do anything like that. Then again, she understood very little about how the Chronivac worked, having never used it herself. She&#39;d tried crawling up to the computer when he was gone and reversing her situation without his permission, but she couldn&#39;t crack his password no matter how many times she guessed at it. Either way, these strange urges were just as much a part of her now as the monstrously stretchy flesh on her body. She couldn&#39;t pretend, even for a fleeting moment, that there was anything normal about her life anymore.<br />
<br />
It was after one of those furious masturbation sessions that Jenny noticed something was off. At first, she thought she&#39;d just left a snail trail of her discharge that stuck to the wall of the house&#39;s crawlspace. But when she tried to pull away from it, slithering up onto the ceiling of the cramped space, the gooey strand just wouldn&#39;t break - and it was the same color as her skin. She started to panic. Not only was her body struggling to hold its normal shape, but now she couldn&#39;t even remain fully solid. Was she just going to keep dissolving until there was nothing left but a pile of flesh-colored goo that Jeff didn&#39;t feel like mopping up?<br />
<br />
Every heated fingering after that left Jenny wetter and slimier than the last. She was afraid to come out of her hiding place even when Jeff was the only one around, expecting that she would leave a sticky residue whenever she moved - that parts of her would congeal, dry up, and be left behind. So it wasn&#39;t long before she ended up staying put in one place - her favorite spot to watch things from, squeezed between the narrow rafters in the ceiling over Jeff&#39;s bed. A little one-inch-wide hole in the ceiling was all the opening she needed to get a perfect view of what was going on below.<br />
<br />
And Jeff, meanwhile, seemed completely unconcerned that he hadn&#39;t seen Jenny in a few days. He just went on with regularly inviting Mara back to his bed, exactly where Jenny wanted the two of them. That bastard Jeff, who had stolen everything from her and reduced her to this freakish existence. That bitch Mara, who had snuck in and taken her place without questioning it. She repeated those words over and over in her mind as she watched them fucking, masturbating to the sight, and to all the disturbing thoughts that came with it. She could no longer tell where her fingers ended and her vagina began, but as the thick soup of her body churned against itself, the pleasure that it produced was greater than ever before.<br />
<br />
Within a few seconds, she had broken the cardinal rule of their twisted hide-and-seek game: not to make any noise. She knew immediately that the lovers below had heard her muffled, gurgling moans, because Mara sat up and gestured for Jeff to slow down. &quot;Did you hear that?&quot;, Mara said. Jenny grew even more aroused. She had forced someone to notice that she still existed. She pressed her eye, the one part of her body that had held its original shape through all of this, greedily against the hole, not wanting to miss a moment of whatever was about to come next.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about,&quot; Jeff said haltingly as he continued to thrust. Jenny knew that he always had been a terrible liar. She let herself groan a little more, trying to keep the sound just barely on the edge of their hearing for maximum creep factor.<br />
<br />
&quot;There it is again!&quot;, Mara cried out, pointing up at the ceiling and pushing away from Jeff&#39;s motions. &quot;I think you&#39;ve got something living in your walls. You might need to hire an exterminator or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Babe,&quot; Jeff replied, very badly attempting to reassure her for long enough that he could stick it back in her, &quot;I&#39;m not hearing what you&#39;re hearing, but I&#39;m sure it&#39;s nothing. This is an old creaky house, it makes weird sounds all the time. Just ask my folks, they&#39;ve been complaining about it a lot the past couple weeks. Now could you please...&quot; But his soothing words fell short. He watched a look of shock and horror forming on Mara&#39;s face as she stared, her eyes wide, at something right behind him. He thought he knew what to expect when he turned around, but he was not prepared for what he saw. When he did, he suddenly realized he should have listened to the Chronivac&#39;s warnings about &quot;slime-like structures.&quot;<br />
<br />
A thick, peach-colored strand of goopy liquid was slowly dripping down from the ceiling, small wet droplets occasionally running off of it and splashing against the floor. And at the bottom of the strand, which swung down lower and lower until it was dangling right in front of Jeff&#39;s awe-stricken face, was a single human eye. As if to remove any doubt that this monstrous thing was somehow alive, and that it was watching them, the eye fluttered shut and then back open. That was either an involuntary blink or maybe a sultry wink, since there was no other eye to compare it against. The thing in front of them - only Mara was left not knowing what it was - shuddered as it watched the two, and ever louder groaning noises gurgled from the ceiling all the while.<br />
<br />
Mara slapped her hands against her horrified face and shrieked at the top of her lungs. And the sight, the sound, the smell of that girl&#39;s fear sent more ripples of pleasure, literally, through Jenny&#39;s puddle of a body. Now she truly was a monster.</p>
