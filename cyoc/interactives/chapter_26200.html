<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With that Samantha dealt three cards to everyone, and an extra one to herself.  The four cards she drew said; lose three years of your age, look at boobs and feel hungry, you feel the strong need to get pregnant and be a boy all over.<br />
She thought all of these were weird cards, but since she was a girl, she played the “you feel the strong need to get pregnant” card.  Suddenly she felt a tingling in her belly, and crotch.  She felt her mind wandering, and her crotch feeling the first experience of getting ‘wet’ and turned on.  Especially when she looked at her brothers.<br />
Her brothers and sisters didn’t notice any change.  Next up was Jessica.  She drew a card and picked up her other three cards.  She looked at her cards and saw they said; swap, you have a need to eat health because you are nine months pregnant, you find girl’s faces to be very beautiful, and you need pacifiers or else you get cranky.<br />
Being a girl, and seeing nothing could happen, she played the pregnancy card.  All of her body started tingling.<br />
While Michael started to go, since he was born 40 seconds after Ashley, nobody noticed that Jessica was restless from the waste down.  He drew his card, and looked at them.  He had drawn; whole body will become a girl, gain 12 years, an all card, and you feel the need to impregnate a girl.<br />
He was about to play the “Whole body will become a girl” card, figuring everyone else was playing girl cards that maybe he should too.  Then he, and everyone else at the table heard a heavily breathing Jessica scream, “Oh, yes!” and this caused him to drop the card that said, you feel the need to impregnate a girl.<br />
“Are you okay?”  Chris asked, while Michael tried to pick up the dropped card.<br />
“Guys, I can’t pick up the dropped card,” Michael stated.<br />
“Oh my god!  What’s happening to me?”  Jessica asked.  Then her belly started expanding, which caused her to pull her pants and underwear down, which were drenched and getting uncomfortable, as her belly grew outward.  It kept growing until she was nine months pregnant.  Jessica sat there in disbelief then said, “Oh my god!  My card came true.”<br />
“What do you mean?”  Chris asked.<br />
They all read the card, then they all gasped, and both Michael and Samantha said “Oh no!”<br />
“I think I’m going to have to have sex with a girl,” said Michael, as his penis was very hard.<br />
“Great I have to have sex with you,” Samantha said.<br />
“Well it looks like it, you better go,” said Chris, “Who knows what will happen if you don’t.”  With that Samantha, and Michael both stormed off.  “We should finish our turn, then call it good for the night,” he said to Ashley.  “Just make sure not to play any ‘all’ cards till Jessica has her kids.”<br />
“Alright, sounds good,” said Ashley a little worried as she looked at her cards and saw that she had drawn; Training bras are needed, legs like to be shown more, you need to suckle on girls breasts to eat, and lose 8 years off your life.<br />
Being a girl, she had sexy legs, so she decided to play the, like to show off legs more card.  Almost instantly, she felt her legs start to itch and feel uncomfortable.<br />
Chris saw her in her discomfort, and asked, “You okay?”<br />
“Yeah, I’m fine, just go.”<br />
“Guys, I’m going to get some food,” Jessica said, as she got up and headed to the kitchen.<br />
Chris drew his card, and looked at them.  He had; a swap card, another swap card, you like to wear training bras, and an all card.  Chris had no choice, so he played the training bra card.  Then, on his upper body, he felt some cloth material, and it covered his nipples, shoulders, and upper back.<br />
“Well, I guess that’s round one,” he says and Ashley and Chris go their own way.<br />
	Chris went back to his room, and found that Michael was not in there.  Chris was tired so he went to sleep after undressing down to his boxers, and also taking off his new training bra.<br />
	Samantha and Michael went to their parent’s bed since it was the biggest.  They lay next to each other, grossed out at what they had just done but knew that they had to do, and that a child had now been conceived.<br />
	Jessica, pretty much naked, walked to the kitchen, and grabbed some carrots.  She took the carrots back to her room.  In her room, which she used to share with Samantha was now just hers, and there was a boy and a girl bassinet.  She lay down on her bed and on her back, and ate her carrots.<br />
	Ashley headed to her room, which she realized was now being shared with Samantha.  Her legs were really itching when she got back to her room.  She quickly pulled her pants off but realized that her legs didn’t itch anymore once the pants were removed.  When she threw her pants on the floor, she failed to see them disappear.  She was feeling tired so she lay on her bed and went to sleep.<br />
At midnight, they all heard a cry for help from Jessica.  Michael, and Samantha arrived to the scene first, and saw that Jessica’s water had broke.  Next was Ashley, and she came in just wearing a long t-shirt that covered up her crotch.  Christopher was getting held up, because it seemed he couldn’t leave until he put on his training bra.  When they all were there, they helped give birth to Logan, and Erika, which Jessica named.<br />
	Being tired, they all decided to go to bed.  Jessica had to breast feed her new babies first.</p>
