<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kayla and Martha had spent the evening having the best sex they had had in yea...no, decades. Kayla&#39;s new femininity felt oddly good to her. While sex as a man had been great, Kayla enjoyed the feeling of her large breasts and how sensitive they were, how they lactated milk(More on that in a minute), and how the sensual feeling of how they freely swung around.  She also more than enjoyed her young virgin snatch being fingered by Martha. Experiencing her first womanly orgasm was a revelation of ecstasy that Kyle had never known existed. She laid in bed with Martha, looking like she had back in the 1930s, cuddling one another. After just sighing peacefully and enjoying a comfortable silence, Kayla was the first to open her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like to try on one of your dresses&quot; she proclaimed.<br />
<br />
Martha raised her red eyebrows.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my. Are you a transvestite, Mrs. Saviano?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kayla giggled like a school girl. &quot;Not anymore. I want to try on some of your old clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
She got up and started to rummage through Martha&#39;s old things, stuff she hadn&#39;t worn in decades because she had simply grown too old for them. <br />
<br />
&quot;How about this?&quot; asked Kayla, holding a red cocktail dress.<br />
<br />
&quot;I remember wearing that when I graduated from college&quot; yawned Martha. &quot;Go right ahead, Mrs. Saviano&quot; she added.  Kayla grinned.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Elizabeth had put Billie back to bed in her PJ&#39;s after she had woken Liz up and used the toilet, a task that the five year old girl had tons of questions about, which her mother had patiently explained. Elizabeth went back to examine her new form.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...look like a teenager&quot; she said softly to the mirror, stroking her perfect face. <br />
<br />
&quot;If God did this to all women, than he definitely has a type&quot; she added scornfully.<br />
<br />
She was conflicted. Elizabeth was now absolutely stunning. If there had been any men left, the moment the new Elizabeth walked down the street, erections would immediately pop up to herald her arrival. If she tried to pick up Billie from school tomorrow, there would be a chance that Elizabeth would be confused for Billie&#39;s hot older sister. She was Helen of Troy beautiful, and her current body put her old self to shame. But...but there was something really gross and sexist about this too. Elizabeth liked being Elizabeth. She appreciated having a younger body, but it had to be on her own terms. She didn&#39;t want to be this...this supernaturally hot supermodel staring at her in the mirror. She was reminded of the Twilight Zone episode &quot;Number Twelve Looks Just Like You&quot; where the female protagonist is turned against her will into an attractive yet vapid conformist. Bodies came in all shapes and sizes, and Elizabeth felt that everyone having perfect measurements would make life boring.<br />
<br />
Now she knew how Robbie had felt to have her whole life and identity completely stripped from her. Resentment built over whoever had orchestrated these changes.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Thankfully, Allison had discovered Logan bleeding out in the bathroom just in the nick of time. Miraculously, Logan had left the door unlocked, otherwise she surely would have died from the massive cuts to her wrists. She immediately called 911, and they arrived just in the nick of time.<br />
<br />
She rode with Logan to the hospital in an ambulance, the paramedics, all ridiculously hot and busty now as per Greta&#39;s wish, allowing her to ride with the dying new girl as moral support. Allison was frantically shoting sweet nothings to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baby, you&#39;re going to be OK. Allison&#39;s here&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;m here for you. Don&#39;t die, please! I need you! The school, the WORLD needs you! Please don&#39;t die!&quot;<br />
<br />
Logan&#39;s green eyes fluttered a little through her dazed unconsciousness.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Manny Bosman, now Amanda, stared at herself in a black bra and panties in the mirror. She was posing, cocking her hips out, blowing kisses to herself, and waving like she was on the catwalk. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong with me? Why does this feel so good?&quot; thought Amanda. &quot;And why did I like being punished by Kira? I&#39;m really a man...a man...a man.&quot;<br />
<br />
But all Manny/Amanda saw was a sub in the mirror, a little girl with tits the size of watermelons and hair that belonged in a shampoo commercial who wanted to be fucked and dominated by her lover Kira, and anyone else besides. She didn&#39;t need to hear the cheers from the throngs of onlookers watching her do slam dunks anymore. She&#39;d much rather be made to crawl like a dog on her hands and knees and serve her mistress now, her wide and bountiful ass spread into the air for all to see. The former Manny would have expected as much from his former conquests.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Millie and Juliana were kissing now, back in the bathtub while holding hands. It was sweet, blissful, and romantic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please stay the whole night with me&quot; begged Millie, her face inches from Juliana&#39;s. &quot;I...I&#39;m a really good cook, and I have tons of games we can play, and...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shh&quot; whispered Juliana, putting a finger to Millie&#39;s cupid mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got everything I need right here&quot;, now rubbing Millie&#39;s soapy left breast.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
&quot;You like?&quot; asked Kayla, now looking retro adorable in Martha&#39;s dress which had been tailored in the 1940&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;I like...now get back to bed and ravish me some more&quot; teased Martha, posing on the bed, her legs seductively crossed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so happy that you&#39;re young again&quot; beamed Kayla.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, nobody&#39;s happier than me to not have arthritis anymore. Not stop being a silly little girl and...&quot;<br />
<br />
Their doorbell rung three times.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder how that could be?&quot; wondered Kayla. She rode off in Martha&#39;s old fashioned dress and heels, while Martha tagged along quickly, putting on a bathrobe along the way and opened the front door without even opening the curtain first. They lived in the country, and rarely had visitors except for the neighbors down the road.<br />
<br />
Kayla opened the door and found a basket.<br />
<br />
&quot;How quaint&quot; Kayla said, staring at a basket with a baby inside it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously? A baby? This is a bit Old Testament&quot; asked Martha.<br />
<br />
&quot;Martha, maybe a baby is just what we need! We&#39;ve got a fresh start, maybe it&#39;s a sign from God!&quot; squealed Kayla<br />
<br />
Martha wondered out loud, &quot;But can two women properly raise a child without a father?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I guess we&#39;re going to have to wait and see!&quot; said Kayla, stroking her thick hair with her small hand as she examined the baby. <br />
<br />
&quot;I found a note here!&quot; she squealed again<br />
<br />
&quot;Did I ever tell you when I had a lesbian affair with Nancy Wilder?&quot; asked Martha, wondering if her husband turned lesbian wife was even paying attention now. Nancy was very girlish and excitable just as Kayla was behaving right now.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, tell me later. Too bad Nancy&#39;s been dead for thirty years, otherwise we could have a menage a tois. OK, get a load of this, Martha: <br />
<br />
&#39;I was driving on the freeway when the gender wave happened. In the panic, I was driven off the road by somebody in the middle of transformation and was ran into a ditch, where I found this feral child. I  have no idea where she came from, whether she&#39;s actually a born girl or a baby boy which was turned into a girl, but I found a note saying that her name is Jo. I am in no financial condition to care for this child, so I delivered her to a home that looked well off. I don&#39;t know you, but please, take good care of her.&#39;<br />
<br />
The note was signed Anonymous.<br />
<br />
Baby Jo looked up at Kayla and Martha with trepidation in her infant eyes. She knew that she had brought this on herself through her own carelessness with her newfound power. Now here she was, trapped as a baby, and a baby GIRL no less, unable to speak. She HAD to get that ring back from Dr. Von Hauser somehow and undo all this chaos...<br />
<br />

<br />
Aziz drove into town. She had loaded her passed out friends in the Jeep, still not aware of the new order of things. She parked her vehicle at her family home. She wasn&#39;t wearing any head or body coverings, and was nervous as hell as she opened the front door of her parents house, dressed proactively as a Western style slutbomb.</p>
