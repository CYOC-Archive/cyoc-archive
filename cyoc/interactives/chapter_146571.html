<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The lab&#39;s security system indicated that no human had entered at all. The only signs of life were the pulses of the various dicks he was experimenting on. Had that been a trick by the hacker to divert his attention to the wrong place? That was the problem with using a human computer linked to his own homan one. Sometimes, humans got too close to the secret. <br />
<br />
Luckily, he was authorized to use force if a human threatened the secrecy of his status as a homan or the existence of alien technology. Hacking into his superadvanced computer qualified as a threat. This guy wasn&#39;t protected by the parameters of his experiment. <br />
<br />
With just a few clicks on his tablet, Hugo got his supercomputer to trick the hacking into a data antechamber, which would look like the regular computer Danny had been using. As he got the notifications that the hacker had fallen for his tricks, Hugo activated the remodeling measures. His supercomputer could use other electronic devices to activate the special frequencies light and sound that manipulated human forms into that of their dicks. Just like the flash of a camera. Of course, it was more complicated than that, but who cared? That was Mint&#39;s expertise.<br />
<br />
Smirking, Hugo scanned the human. One of his classmates, a guy called George, and one of Danny&#39;s lab partners it seemed. Somewhat plain with a bit of a beer gut, but scanners indicated that he had a thick veiny cock. Seven inches, perfectly decent. Hmm. Without realizing it, Model #1 had done him a nice favor. Hugo could attempt another phase of his experiment, and Donshel wouldn&#39;t be able to protest his initiative at all. <br />
<br />
Hugo pressed the new button on his tablet, and chuckled when all signs of hacking stopped. <br />
<br />
&quot;Something... funny?&quot; Model #7 asked, still lying in a puddle of its own seed. Every few breaths let squirts of white out of its slit. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, nothing much,&quot; he said, closing the tab and turning back to the table. &quot;Something that required my attention. Now, I need to compare your efficiency with that of a previous model.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hugo unlocked Dave from his cock cage, feeling the dick&#39;s silenced screams through the slight trembling of the dick&#39;s shaft. So disobedient and dramatic... Well, Hugo certainly wouldn&#39;t be feeling guilty for this. With expert touch, he got Dave hard and stiff and hooked him onto the pseudo-human toy. For a second, he wondered if he ought to clean the fleshlight, but decided Dave hadn&#39;t behaved well enough to deserve that. Plus, Perry&#39;s efforts shouldn&#39;t go to waste. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s begin,&quot; he said and activated the pseudo-man. <br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
George had pumped his fist in triumph as he finally slipped past the computer&#39;s firewalls and reached the ID he&#39;d gotten from his conversation with dick-Danny. The address popped up, precise, clear, with no doubt as to where it led. He could get there in an hour, get in and out with the dicking camera and Danny, and be on his way to living like a king! <br />
<br />
With a pen in hand, he jotted down the numbers and names on a piece of paper. So excited was he about his success that he didn&#39;t notice his computer screen brightening up until its glare covered his hands. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the?&quot; he muttered, &quot;I didn&#39;t make the luminosity automatic...&quot;<br />
<br />
A flash of light blinded him. <br />
<br />
It was instantaneous. George felt himself fall, and hit the cushion of his chair, and something like a circus tent float down on top of him. Disoriented, he tried to look around, but he see much beyond the filter of black fabric on top of him. Faintly, he could make out the light of his computer monitor, but he couldn&#39;t move, his whole body seemed made out of lead. Had he hit his head? No, no, wait, he was on his chair... All of him? That couldn&#39;t be right. His head was against the cushion, as was his torso and his... balls? <br />
<br />
With a gasp of fear, George tried to wiggle his fingers and toes, only to realize they were gone. He had lost all his limbs. The image of Danny&#39;s own dicked body was too fresh in his mind for him to draw any other conclusion. He had been dicked! <br />
<br />
Heat flooded through his veins, pulsing hard and hot through him. He grew stiff, just enough for his dickhead to poke through the opening between his shirt and boxers. With that, he saw, clearly, the enormous computer tower on his right and the cinema-screen sized computer monitor overhead. Everything was gigantic! Was this how dick-Danny saw the world now? <br />
<br />
No, no, no, he couldn&#39;t be just a cock. He had had plans! He was going to live the life with Danny as his toy! He couldn&#39;t have become a dick himself, he was too smart for that! Help, he had to get help! <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, George hadn&#39;t been chipped and couldn&#39;t talk. He was completely helpless, at the mercy of anyone that found him, if anyone ever did. He was living in the dorms on his own.<br />
<br />
Inside his head, he whimpered and begged for someone to help him. Begged for someone like Danny, someone big and strong and kind that would pick him up, nice and easy, and... and... rub him a bit... before helping him. <br />
<br />
Just, maybe jerk him a bit before changing him back. <br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Reuben pushed the door open, Kyle following him inside the badly-lit dorm room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, George, you and Danny completely missed our study session last night. What gives, man?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle rolled his eyes. &quot;Maybe he finally got Danny to dick him. Shut him up about how much he wants him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Reuben shrugged. &quot;Could be.&quot; He looked around the room, saw the unmade bed and the sleeping computer. &quot;Doesn&#39;t look like he&#39;s there though. Shame, I really could have used their help last night. I swear I&#39;m going to fail that exam if things keeps up the way they&#39;re going.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll be fine.&quot; Kyle patted his shoulder. &quot;You&#39;ve been studying a lot, even decided not to go to Danny&#39;s party to read up on the material. There&#39;s no way you&#39;ll fail.&quot;<br />
<br />
Reuben sighed and got up to the computer, and shook the mouse. The screen immediately lit up with a google map kind of image, with a pin over a location just off campus. &quot;Do you think he left to go there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What else could it be?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno,&quot; Reuben replied, unsure, as he pulled the chair and sat.<br />
<br />
And immediately jumped up with a yelp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Reuben?&quot; Kyle asked.<br />
<br />
Reuben rubbed his ass, eyes wide as he incredulous stared at the pile of clothes. He hadn&#39;t noticed them before. But those were George&#39;s clothe, no doubt. He&#39;d seen him wearing them yesterday morning. He hadn&#39;t seen the life-like dildo poking out of them though. Kyle followed his gaze and understood. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah!&quot; he laughed. &quot;I don&#39;t see why you jumped, Reuben. Don&#39;t you love to take it?&quot; Kyle wiggled his eyebrows, half joking, half seductive.<br />
<br />
Reuben didn&#39;t pay him much mind. Why would George leave a dildo lying around like that? Heck, it wasn&#39;t even propped up properly.  Large dried spots on the shirt made him reconsider. As he got a little closer, he noticed the smell of sex. That definitely wasn&#39;t just a dildo. What the hell?<br />
<br />
Hesitating, Reuben lifted the shirt. The dick inside the boxers was exactly like George&#39;s. Same slight left curve, same veiny underside, same foreskin *just* about to pull back. Fascinated, he rubbed one of the veins, ran along the length and felt the warmth of human skin.<br />
<br />
Reuben startled as thick ropes of cum hit him in the face. <br />
<br />
Kyle burst out laughing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up, dude! It&#39;s not funny.&quot; Reuben grabbed a couple of tissues and a bottle of water to clean himself. &quot;How in the world did a dildo cum like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle, still grinning, opened his mouth, but nothing came out. &quot;Huh. I never heard of that before. Look,&quot; he poked the dick&#39;s shaft, &quot;it&#39;s getting soft too. Like-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like a real dick,&quot; Reuben finished for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t think...&quot; <br />
<br />
Reuben shook the cock a bit. &quot;It feels real. Flops the same way. And that was cum. I still have the aftertaste in my mouth. And no one has seen George since yesterday.&quot;<br />
<br />
They turned to the address on the screen, coincidentally the same as the one written on a piece of paper. <br />
<br />
Kyle frowned. &quot;Let&#39;s go check it out. At the very least, we might find out where George got a dildo like that. I definitely want my own.&quot;<br />
<br />
Reuben nodded absentmindedly. There was no way this was George, right? How would he have been turned into his own penis like that? Been reduced to... Just a dick... That... Fuck, that sounded amazing.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Reuben and Kyle had no way of knowing that George had been edged for more than a day now. Unable to move and satisfy himself but too stiff from adrenaline, from fear and the faint air coming from the whirring fans of his computer. He had been kept hard and awake from the moment he had been dicked. Now, he could barely think of anything except cumming. He&#39;d already forgotten what he had been doing before his hacking attempt, his mind only preoccupied by the image of another cock. A nice, beautiful cock that he&#39;d talked to before on his computer. Danny, his feeble mind remembered. Just the tought of Danny had more pre dribble out of his slit. <br />
<br />
He hoped the two giants brought him to Danny.</p>
