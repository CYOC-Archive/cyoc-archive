<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With a week to go before Christmas both Lisa and Kumiko were holding their companies annual Christmas party. As Ann now pulled into the parking lot, she smiled as she glanced at Stephanie. &quot;So are you excited?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Stephanie exclaimed. &quot;You know I love your sisters work. I am curious though, why me and not Jackie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jackie&#39;s not a big fashion buff,&quot; Ann stated. &quot;She had other plans tonight anyway. Figure this would be a nice gift.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you recommending me for promotion was a nice gift,&quot; Stephanie smirked.<br />
<br />
Ann&#39;s eyes went wide, how did Stephanie find out about that? &quot;I have my sources Ann,&quot; she said. &quot;And I really appreciate it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It made the most sense from a business standpoint,&quot; Ann stated. &quot;Sorry that the board is being difficult about this. Hopefully they come to their senses soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the two now made their way inside, they now talked about their upcoming plans. Ann would be visiting her family as she had done the previous few Christmas. While Stephanie had an open invitation, the young executive was thinking about a quiet vacation in Vermont. The raven haired woman looking to possibly get some skiing in.<br />
<br />
&quot;You really should stay for Christmas Steph,&quot; Ann said. &quot;I hate to see you by yourself. Its a time for family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In case you forgot my family sucked when I was growing up,&quot; Stephanie smirked. &quot;My folks were constantly away on business. Nothing worse than opening Christmas gifts under the watchful eye of your nanny. Since they passed, well, Christmas just feels lonely. &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All the more reason to spend the holidays with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stephanie paused, turning to Ann as she gave her a warm smile. &quot;I appreciate it Ann,&quot; she smiled. &quot;Really I do. These last few Christmas have been the best but, I need some me time. I mean I&#39;m not getting any younger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Usually,&quot; Ann replied impishly.<br />
<br />
&quot;True,&quot; Stephanie laughed. &quot;But seriously I need to start thinking about the future. Settling down, getting married, maybe..maybe even starting a family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I keep seeing your niece and her friends with their kids,&quot; Stephanie chuckled. &quot;And I started thinking. Maybe, I mean I know if I did have a kid I would definitely do things alot differently than what my folks did.&quot; Ann simply nodded, she could relate to some extent. Yes, she had thought about having children of her own (especially after meeting Angelica her possible future daughter). It was Angelica though that made her want to wait. The future girl was Jackie&#39;s biological daughter. A daughter Jackie wouldn&#39;t become pregnant with for another 17 years. All Ann could do was wait and see where her and Jackie stood over the coming years.<br />
<br />
As they entered the building, both Stephanie and Ann couldn&#39;t help but smile at the festive atmosphere. Lisa and Kumiko had gone all out in decorating with lights, presents, and small Christmas trees lining the large conference room. Already it appeared the party was packed as numerous people now mingled. Ann now waved to her sister who wore a red and green sweater, black pants, and a Santa hat. &quot;Ann, Stephanie glad you could make it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for inviting us Lisa,&quot; Ann smiled. Glancing around the room, Lisa could see several employees as well as friends of theirs. &quot;I&#39;m surprised Katie isn&#39;t here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shes having a get together at her place,&quot; Lisa stated. &quot;And Jason is watching the kids tonight so let&#39;s have some fun.&quot; As Lisa now led them towards the eggnog she paused as she now beckoned several women over. &quot;Ann Id like to introduce you to Nina,&quot; she said. Nina smiled, waving politely to both Ann and Stephanie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to meet you Nina,&quot; Ann smiled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ninas son is dating Gloria,&quot; Lisa stated. &quot;We&#39;ve gotten to know eachother over the last couple of monthes and I thought she could use some girl time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could definitely use some girl time, &quot; Nina chuckled. &quot;The house has been a bit crazy with the holidays. Luckily Jacob and the boys were willing to hold down the fort for the night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you remember Reiko right,&quot; Lisa stated, gesturing to the quiet woman standing behind Nina.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah Kumikos sister in law,&quot; Ann said happily. &quot;How are you Reiko?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m good,&quot; Reiko smiled. The middle age woman now calling over a friend, Ann watching as an attractive middle age woman with auburn hair approach. &quot;Id like to introduce you to a friend of mine Natalia. She just moved into town a few months ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
Natalia smiled, the vampire extending her hand as she gave Ann and Stephanie a demure smile. &quot;Charmed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well ladies,&quot; Stephanie said happily. &quot;I don&#39;t know about you but I could use a drink.&quot; The others now nodded, making their way towards the open bar as Ann trailed behind.<br />
<br />
Gazing out at the party, Ann sighed happily. Lisa and Kumiko had grown this business together, turning it into a prosperous small business. Gazing out Ann could see close to 80 people happily mingling and enjoying the party. From Julia Harris, to Maddie Haskins, to Morgan Dean, it appeared most of the people she knew without magic were in attendance. Still, part of Ann always felt somewhat awkward in these social gatherings. &quot;After all these years Ann your still a bit of an introvert.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chuckling softly to herself, Ann simply took in the scene. It was cheerful and festive atmosphere, Ann taking a deep breath as she happily began to relax. As she now began to walk towards the bar to join the others, she paused.<br />
<br />
Ann had caught someone moving in her periphery. Whoever it was was small, quick, and despite their best efforts not good at hiding. Turning quickly she headed towards whatever it was, gasping in shock at the tiny interloper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lynne?!&quot;<br />
<br />
The tiny red haired toddler stopped in her tracks, gazing up at her aunt with an innocent smile. &quot;Annie,&quot; the girl chirped. &quot;Can I go to Mommies party too?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann was flummoxed as she now gazed at the girl. Somehow Lynne had escaped her house in her p.j.s and snuck in. &quot;How did you get here Lynne?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Magic,&quot; Lynne smiled. &quot;Can I go to da party too Annie. Pwetty pwease!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann looked around nervously, a magical toddler on the loose was probably not a good idea. &quot;I&#39;m sorry Lynne,&quot; Ann said softly. &quot;But this is a grown ups party. Mommy can have a party with you later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Lynne said sadly. Lynne&#39;s eyes now lit up as the girl seemed to come up with an idea. &quot;But if it wasn&#39;t for grownups I could stay right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Ann could answer, Lynne closed her eyes. Ann&#39;s body now began to tingle. A tingle she immediately recognized from her previous bouts of regression. Gasping, she now looked herself over, surprised to see she wasn&#39;t changing. &quot;What gives,&quot; she thought. &quot;How come I&#39;m not changing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann now tried to piece together this puzzle. Jackie had said that ever since her accident it had been harder to regress Ann with magic. Without the help of the Ring of Age, Ann&#39;s regression appeared contained within herself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey you not getting little,&quot; Lynne pouted.<br />
<br />
Ann simply nodded, it appeared she had some resistance to little Lynne&#39;s magic. Gazing out at the party though, she immediately winced. &quot;Oh crap!&quot;<br />
<br />
While Ann appeared to be unaffected, the rest of the party goers weren&#39;t so lucky. Already she could see everyone looking a little fresher, their hair a little brighter, their clothes just a tad bit looser. What was worse was no one seemed the wiser that they were gradually growing younger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everyone looks 5 maybe 10 years younger,&quot; she whispered. Turning back to Lynne she could see the tiddler giving her aunt an innocent smile. <br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re going to have fun at da party Annie!&quot;</p>
