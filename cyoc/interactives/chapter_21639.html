<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“…That’s it for the weather, now an old favorite to start your Christmas morning…” <br />
Priscilla groggily reached over and turned off her alarm clock radio.<br />
5:00 am.  That should give her plenty of time to get down to the tree and see what she was getting before her parents and sister woke up.<br />
She hopped out of bed and into her fuzzy slippers.  She threw on a robe over her pajamas and started down toward the tree.  It was surrounded by colorful packages of all shapes and sizes.  To her surprise, she noted a tall and felty cat condo with a big red bow on it.<br />
“Mom and Dad must have finally broken down and got Pru the kitty she’s been asking for forever,” Priscilla mused.  Prudence, her twin sister, had always wanted a pet cat.  She had begged her parents for years to but her one, but they had always refused.  Priscilla thought that they had finally relented due to the fact that Prudence had been so withdrawn lately.  The two girls had just started high school in the fall.  Priscilla had quickly gained popularity by joining the cheerleading squad and dating the whole defensive line of the varsity football team.  Prudence, on the other hand, was having a terrible time trying to make friends.  Her situation had been made all the worse by her sister’s popularity.  Priscilla and Prudence used to be nearly inseparable, but now their relationship had been strained.  Priscilla, though slightly pained by the schism, was basking in her popularity.  <br />
That is what got her out of bed at this ungodly hour.  She had taken a peak at her parents’ supply of Christmas presents before they were rapped, and had stumbled upon a beautiful necklace that only could be for her.  She couldn’t wait to try it on and see how it looked on her.  She was sure that it would make all the guys at school droll all over her.  As Priscilla rifled through the presents, she finally came upon a box that was about the right size for a necklace.  And lo and behold, it was a gift for her.  From “Santa.”  Without a moment’s hesitation, she tore through the paper to find a burgundy box.  Inside the box was beautiful, gem studded collar.  It even had a heart shaped tag that had “Priss” engraved on it in fine script.  Priscilla thought the necklace she had seen was a little different, but she was so captivated by the collar that she quickly fastened it around her neck.  As the clasp fastened, a wave of comfort and warmth rolled over her.  She moved quickly to the hall mirror so she could look at herself.  The sight of herself wearing the collar filled Priscilla with joy.  It seemed to fit her.  <br />
She was so captivated with her new gift that she didn’t realize that she had, ever so slightly and slowly, begun to change.  Her eyes, which had always been a dull hazel, had become vibrant green.  Also, a fine hair began to grow on her skin.  Her normally brown hair was lightening and becoming a silvery white.  <br />
Priscilla’s attention was diverted from her reflection by a sweet smell.  The aroma seemed to just recently fill the air, and she was determined to find its source.  Priscilla began to sniff the air intently.  Her search led her back to the family room and to the Christmas tree.  Another wave of warmth rolled over her.  She was so euphoric that she wasn’t conscious of what she was doing.  Priscilla gracefully dropped to all fours and began sniffing at the packages.  As she did, the hair on her arms and legs grew longer and took on the same silver-white as the hair on her head.  Furthermore, the tip of her nose began to change color and push out from her face, giving her the slightest hint of a muzzle.  Priscilla finally found the source of the aroma.  It was a small package rapped in reflective red paper.  Priscilla made short work of the wrapping paper as her fingernails began to sharpen and turn into claws.  Soon she had freed her treasure from its festive covering.  Inside she found a catnip mouse.  Priscilla rubbed it fiercely against her nose and face while inhaling deeply of its intoxicating aroma.  While she was focussed on her mouse, Priscilla’s jaw finished its metamorphosis into the muzzle of a cat.  Whiskers shot out from her cheeks and her ears became pointed and began to migrate to the top of her head.  <br />
Priscilla’s ears twitched as floorboards creaked behind her.  She turned around to see her sister Prudence, smiling with glee.  “Wow Priss, you look right at home acting like a cat.  The collar that sketchy-guy sold me really works!”<br />
Priscilla suddenly realized that something very wrong was going on.  “Pru, what’s happening to meeOW?” she mewed.  <br />
“Ever since school started, you’ve been focussed more on being popular than you have on being a good sister.  Now, thanks to the collar I got from the goatee sporting Santa wannabe, you and I will be close as ever.  And I finally get the cat I’ve always wanted.”<br />
Priscilla was shocked to hear that her sister was responsible for this predicament.  Giving in to her new animal instincts, Priscilla hissed at Prudence and arched her spine.<br />
“Don’t act like that, pet,” Prudence said in a soothing and condescending manner. “You’ll love being my cat.”  Prudence strode over to her sister and began to stroke her now fully feline ears.  Priscilla wanted to protest, maybe slash her sister with her claws, but… the petting felt SO good.  All she could manage was a sheepish mew and began purring vigorously.  “Yes.  That’s my good kitty,” Prudence reassured softly.  “We should probably get you out of those clothes.”  Prudence carefully removed her sister/pet’s robe and nightshirt.  Prudence was amused to see her twin covered in a soft and feathery coat of silvery fur.  Priscilla mewed coyly, alerting her sister/owner to the fact that her pajama pants were increasingly constricting her developing tail.  Prudence slipped the pants down, freeing her new pet’s long fluffy tail.  Prudence continued to stroke and rub her pet’s fur as the changes ran their coarse.  Part of Priscilla wanted to scream and flee, but her human memories began to fade and she gave herself entirely over to being a cat.<br />
As the Persian cat that was once her sister curled up in Prudence’s lap she smiled.  “This is going to be a Merry Christmas,” she mused.  As Prudence sat back in an easy chair, gazing at the lighted tree, with her former sister/current cat purring peacefully in her lap, she felt complete.  Little did she realize the surprises that awaited her under the tree…</p>
