<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John and Randy sauntered through the doors, eager to take out their stress from their long day at work on some weights. They were young men in their prime, working their way through college and sharing a rundown bachelors pad together as they made their way in the world. John was a tall man, with smooth lean muscles he’d developed from years of swimming and water polo. Randy, his best friend from high school, was shorter than him, and stockier. Unlike his smooth friend, whisps of chest hair poked out from his tank top, and his face was rough with a young man’s stubble. The receptionist greeted them warmly as they checked in, her face suddenly lighting up when she read something on the screen.<br />
<br />
“Oh right! The Gym is giving out free samples of this new, body enhancing drug, courtesy of Transversion Labs. Would you gentleman like a free sample?” She asked, cocking her head. <br />
<br />
John took the flyer and examined it while Randy leered unabashedly at the woman’s heavy breasts. <br />
<br />
“What do you think buddy?” John asked his friend.<br />
<br />
“Why not?” Randy said, his eyes running along the young woman’s body and admiring her curves. “Could be fun. I like to be adventurous,” he said suggestively, taking the little bottle from the receptionist. John took one too.<br />
<br />
“Glad to hear it!” she said cheerfully, ignoring Randy. “Have a towel, and enjoy!” she said, before turning away from the counter.<br />
<br />
John and Randy hefted their gym bags and made for the men’s locker room. The big open room was surprisingly uncrowded for a Saturday afternoon. There were a few other men in the room; two gawky teenagers laughing and comparing their non-existent muscles, an older man seated on the bench tying his shoes, and a large naked man standing in the corner. John and Randy had been in sports all their lives; they were used to seeing their fellow men in the locker room naked. It was just the guys, after all. But John’s brow furrowed in confusion as he watched the man examine himself.<br />
<br />
He looked to be in his late forties, maybe even his fifties, with a neatly trimmed salt-and-pepper beard and thick, wavy hair of a similar color. His body bulged with muscle, hidden beneath a layer of healthy fat and coarse, greyish body hair. His belly bulged out before him, and his pectorals were huge and round, covered in a dense pelt of chest hair. What was strange about the man was how he was examining himself, running his big, calloused hands over his hairy skin as if it were the first time he’d seen his body. John shook his head and turned away; he hated watching the bigger guys ogle themselves…<br />
<br />
He looked over to his left to see Randy loading his bag into his locker, pulling off his shirt and swapping it for his work-out shirt, exposing his growing muscular chest and bulging arms. Randy had been a cross-country athlete back when they were in high school. But now as he was getting older, his body was having less trouble packing on the muscle-mass, and he was eager to grow out of his light, wiry frame.  John loaded his own things into the locker, taking a seat to put on his exercise shoes and hearing the sound of the little pill bottle clatter to the ground. He reached down to pick it up; it seemed to have maybe ten or so pills inside. The little label on the front read ‘DILF Pill, 200 mg, take with water and Enjoy!’ He still didn’t understand the information flyer; supposedly it would help him build bulk, become hairier or sexier looking? He wasn’t sure. It sounded enticing, and when he read the ingredients, he didn’t see anything that he would think to flag as unusual.<br />
<br />
“You’re not gonna take that right now, are you?” Randy asked as he finished tying his shoes.<br />
<br />
“I’m thinking about it,” John confessed. “Maybe it’s a workout supplement. Why else would they hand it out at a gym?” he asked, uncapping the little bottle.<br />
<br />
Randy shrugged and pulled his own free sample out of his pocket. “Okay, why not?” he grinned. He popped a pill into his mouth and chased it down with a gulp of water. John did the same, coughing when the large pill stuck in his throat for a second before the water rushed it down. He coughed again, and then again, finding himself stuck in a coughing fit. <br />
<br />
As he hacked and coughed, Randy clutched his stomach and abruptly stood up, “Shit, I’m gonna loose it!” he cried running for the bathroom. <br />
<br />
John ignored him and continued to hack and sputter, not noticing that as he did so his breaths became deeper, his groans more guttural and ragged. His body began to feel hot, starting to sweat profusely as his diaphragm heaved, his back tensed. John’s muscles began to ache with a strange pain and a deeper, stronger feeling of pleasure. He huffed and moaned in a deep, low baritone as his skin itched all over, his pants grew hot and tied, and a tearing sound alerted him to the face that his shirt was splitting in places. His shoes grew uncomfortably tight, and then, as sudden as the sensation had seized him, it was over.<br />
<br />
John sat on the bench hunched over his knees, catching his breath as the warmth and discomfort slowly left him. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath as a wave of new feelings and sensations washed over him, too much to sort out all at once right now. He leaned back and sighed, saying “Oh, shit, that was intense,” before clapping his hands over his mouth as the sound of his deep, stern voice. He removed his hands when his palms felt something rough and furry poking against them; he felt his face and realized that he had grown a beard! His hair was shorter too. He looked down and gasped at the heavy shelf that his chest had become, two round and powerful pectoral muscles, sagging slightly over a heavy and rotund muscle-gut covered in a mat of silvery-black hairs. When had his shirt ripped off? He wondered to himself, rubbing his hands over his chest in wonder.<br />
<br />
He looked down at his lap; an enormous bulge strained against the thin fabric of his exercise shorts, nested between two thick, meaty thighs and a pair of lower legs covered in dense, shaggy hair. Joh blinked as he prodded the bulge with his finger, gasping when he felt the motion on the shaft of his cock. He stood up and, with shaking hands, he lowered the waist of his shorts.<br />
<br />
A heavy, flaccid man cock flopped out from the front of his crotch, its shaft round, straight, and girthy. He held it in his hands and groaned at the sensation of its warmth and weight, running his hands along the shaft and watching the purple, flaring head grow from out of his foreskin. He pulled his pants down lower so he could get a full view: a pair of large and low hanging balls hung below his cock, the whole set nested in a dense thicket of pubic hair that was only an extension of the profuse hair that seemed to cover every part of his body. John admired his new schlong for another moment, watching it throb and harden until ten inches of hard man meat stuck up from his legs before him, bobbing with his heartbeat. He was about to reach out and stroke it when he heard a bass chuckle come from behind him.<br />
<br />
John turned and saw the other man from earlier, the one who had been admiring himself in shock and awe, and now John was starting to have an idea of why. He was seated on the bench, pawing his own growing cock through his jeans as he watched John discover himself.<br />
<br />
“You just take the pill too?” he asked with a grin.<br />
<br />
John nodded and pulled up his pants. “Yeah, what,” he stopped himself and cleared his throat, still shocked by his deep and stern voice. “What the fuck happened to me?” he asked<br />
<br />
“I guess exactly what the pill said it would do! I thought it was a joke though. But this Ain’t no joke!” he said, flexing his muscled upper body. John suddenly remembered what DILF stood for, and realized that the pill had transformed them into exactly that! A sexy, hairy older man! <br />
<br />
“You might want to check on your friend,” the new man chuckled, standing up to begin taking off his pants. “I’m gonna hit the sauna, you two come join me when you calm down.” He stripped out of his underwear and leaned into his locker, taking care to flex his back and his ass muscles and give John a good view before padding away naked for the steam room. <br />
<br />
“Oh, shit, Randy!” he snarled, his curse sounding harsh and menacing in his new tone of voice. <br />
<br />
He sauntered over to the bathrooms a lot faster than he expected with his big feet and increased stride, and looked under the stalls, stopping when he saw a pair of leanly muscled legs in the handicap stall, covered in light, silvery hair. John approached and knocked on the door.<br />
<br />
“Randy,” he asked, still unsure of his voice. “You in there, man?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” came a deep, raspy voice, full of shock and fear.<br />
<br />
“Its okay man, it happened to me too,” he said, his deep voice adopting a softer and mor caring tenor. “Just come on out and we’ll get through it.” He coaxed.<br />
<br />
He heard a deep sigh and the sound of the stall unlatching, and a new man stepped out. Randy had also grown taller, his muscles had become large and cut, with almost no body fat. His hard, firm chest was covered in a pelt of silvery-white hairs that ran from his neck all the way down to his hard, sculpted abdomen. His face had turned hard and angular, sporting a neatly trimmed white beard and mustache adorning his face. But Randy’s same green eyes peered back at him from beneath his shiny forehead and bushy, white eyebrows. His silvery-white hair was trimmed short and slicked back against his head with sweat. The man’s green eyes widened as he took in John’s own altered form, admiring his meaty pecks and heavy gut.<br />
<br />
“Dude,” he spoke in a deep, somewhat raspy voice. “You look like my dad,” he said, in a hushed tone.<br />
<br />
“That pill did a number on you too, man,” he replied, stepping back as Randy pushed past him and went for the sink to look at himself in the mirror. John’s cock hardened at the sight of Randy’s strong, broad back and firm round ass. <br />
<br />
“Holy shit, man!” Randy huffed, combing his thick fingers through his beard admiring his chest. “Look at me!” he flexed his arms in the mirror, a stupid grin creeping upon his face as he watched the muscles swell and tense. “But, damn, I look older. And so do you! You look like you’re pushing fifty!” he guffawed, looking at John through the mirror.<br />
<br />
John shuffled his feet awkwardly and tried to ignore the growing erection in his pants. “You’re looking pretty long in the tooth yourself, old man.” He growled, a cocky demeanor beginning to settle over him.<br />
<br />
“Hey, buddy. With age comes experience,” he leered, rubbing his hard belly.<br />
<br />
John eyed Randy’s growing bulge with a hungry eye, his apprehension and his uncertainty slowly evaporating from his mind, replaced by a confidence, swagger, and a recollection of years of past experiences, most of them carnal. Randy’s eyes were drinking in John’s body as well, noticing the big piece snaking down his shorts. John suddenly remembered the stranger’s offer, and quickly came up with a plan.<br />
<br />
“That big older guy, who was checking himself out when we got in?” he began, “Turns out he took the pill too. Maybe we should join him in the sauna and figure this out…” he suggested, taking a step closer to the slightly shorter man.<br />
<br />
“That sounds like a good start. But lets not stay there too long; I wanna get out on the floor and see what this body can do!” Randy replied, taking another long look at his improved age and physique in the mirror. <br />
<br />
“C’mon, boy,” John ordered with a soft chuckle, a part of him wondering where that word had come from. He hooked a finger below the jock’s waistband and dragged him away from the mirror, and together they re-entered the now deserted locker room to grab their towels and deposit their shorts. As he watched Randy strip, John’s cock swelled and his heart raced at the sigh of his round, hairless buttocks, and the long, thick cock spilling out from the man’s front, a pair of egg-sized balls riding high against his crotch. Randy caught him staring at chuckled.<br />
<br />
“Save it for the steam room, you old pervert.” He laughed, slamming the locker shut.<br />
<br />
“So, can have you in the steam room?” John rumbled with a wolfish grin. <br />
<br />
They went down the narrow hallway and opened the door, being greeted by a wall of steam illuminated by a hazy white light. They saw the man from before, sitting in a corner with his legs and arms spread out over the benches, his eyes closed and his big hands resting on his enormous, sagging belly. His eyes opened and his mouth broke into a toothy grin when he saw them coming in.<br />
<br />
“Hey, there, boys. Have a seat.” He gestured around the empty rooms. Leaving their towels, John and Randy decided to sit on either side of the man, giving them each a view of each other’s new, impressive bodies. <br />
<br />
“I’m Bryan,” he said to Randy, reaching over to give him a firm handshake. Randy returned it, smirking to himself when he felt the muscles of his arm tense and harden with strength against the bigger man’s grip. <br />
<br />
“Randy,” he said, leaning back.<br />
<br />
“Didn’t realize I was the prude!” he chuckled, shifting his weight and freeing himself of his towel to exposed his furry quads and long legs. A fat, soft cock slump against the bench, draped over a pair of round, hairy balls. <br />
<br />
“You’re one hell of a beautiful man,” Randy complimented, his eyes roaming over Bryan’s heaving pectorals. <br />
<br />
“You boys turned into fine men, yourselves,” he purred, folding his big arms behind his head. “I didn’t know what to expect when I took those pills, but it wasn’t this.”<br />
<br />
“Right?” John said. “I know I’m older, and that my body has changed. But it feels so good, so easy?” he trailed off.<br />
<br />
“I know,” Randy chimed in. “I’m not bothered by it either. I just feel so…sexy and powerful.” He rubbed his bulging biceps.<br />
<br />
“Manly,” Bryan chimed in, with a chuckle. <br />
<br />
They sat there in the steam for a few quiet moments, still evaluating themselves and each other. John was enjoying the feeling of sitting amongst these virile specimens of men, finding himself thinking about some of the guys he’d met in the gym who were his age, or at least, the age he used to be. He remembered one of the trainers, a young, energetic man with lean muscles and a smooth, square jaw. His cock stirred as he imagined himself in bed with the young man, his big hands parting the boys hairless asscheeks so that he could feed his heavy meat into the young man’s tight, warm hole. He loved the way younger guys fawned over his strong, manly body, giggling when he tickled them with his bushy beard as he kissed them passionately with his rough, full lips…<br />
<br />
“Need help with that?” he heard Randy offer, snapping him from his reverie. John realized he’d been absentmindedly stroking himself, and now his enlarged cock stock up from between his thighs, throbbing and demanding. <br />
<br />
Before taking the pill John would never, for any sum of money, let one of his bros suck his dick. But John’s new mind was clear, refreshed, and aware of himself and what he needed. He was a man, who’d spent a lot of time working to cultivate who he was and what made him happy. And here was his best friend, eagerly and gratefully offering to give John the relief he so obviously needed. <br />
John leaned back and rested his big hands over his stomach, glowering at Randy as he said, “Thank’s, buddy. I can always count on you.” He winked. Randy crept from his seat and crawled between John’s legs, his own growing cock swinging heavy below him as he took his place before John’s swollen manhood. Randy took it in his rough hand, grinning as he felt it throb and buck with John’s heartbeat, before wrapping his mouth around the bulbous head. John moaned as he felt Randy’s tongue stroke and whip around the sensitive strip of flesh on the head of his cock, groaning as his friend worked his jaw further down his shaft. Randy took a deep breath through his throat and pushed himself down, feeling John’s hands rest on his heads and lightly press against him for assistance. Randy groaned around a mouthful of cock as his face was buried against John’s profusely hairy crotch; he began to draw his head back and forth, kneading John’s nuts with one hand and fondling his own cock with the other. John’s eyes opened when he heard Bryan’s growl and groan in the corner, stroking his own impressive cock. His mouth opened slightly when he saw the size of it, over a foot long and roped with thick, throbbing veins. Bryan smirked when he saw him leering and stood up, continuing to take long strokes of his cock as he stepped over to them and presented it before john’s face.<br />
<br />
John leaned forward as much as he could, clutching Randy’s head in place as he opened his mouth to take in Bryan’s massive cock. He huffed in shock as Bryan bucked forward with his hips, driving his immense girth deeper down John’s throat. As the cock probed deeper into him Bryan began to take long deep strokes into his face, his big balls slapping against John’s bearded chin. The man could only lay back, writhing and trying not to choke as Randy eagerly lapped and sucked at his cock below and Bryan kept his mouth busy from above. Johns balls were beginning to achee and churn with need; Randy increased the tempo of his thrusts, swirling his tongue along Johns shaft. John reached out and cradled Bryan’s heavy balls in his hands, pressing and massaging them as if to milk the man’s come out of him. But that’s exactly what happened; Bryan huffed and growled, his grip on John’s head tightening as he his cock throbbed and expelled its heavy load down Johns throat in waves. John sighed, his eyes streaming from as Bryan held himself inside him and his own cock strained as he orgasmed, his balls pumping a huge volume of cum through his cock and down Randy’s eagerly waiting throat. The two men withdrew from John and sat down on the benches, all of them breathing heavily and affectionately fondling their spent schlongs as they thought about what to do next.</p>
