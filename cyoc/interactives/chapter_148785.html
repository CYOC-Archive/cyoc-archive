<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff glared at the doll that made that remark to him, well he&#39;d fix that later now wouldn&#39;t he? He spent the rest of the day attending class or resolving issues the normal way. He&#39;d figured that he&#39;d changed so many people in a single day that he should relax for now. Come the end of the day he made his way back to the biology classroom with his empty backpack. Right where it had been left, laid the torso of the late Ms. Peroli. He had to pull the dildo out that was left behind to keep it from leaking anymore while in the pack. That didn&#39;t stop him from picking up the doll (Jannice) following him and reinserting it into its vagina. Bitch deserved it after today anyways...<br />
<br />
Arriving at home, he made straight for his room, the pack only slightly dripping now. Jannice however was leaving a trail behind it as it walked along. He sat the pack down on his desk pulling the torso out and setting it beside his monitor. It was still a bit strange to him to be able to see into and through it at points. As he started his computer, he looked over his new hoard of toys. A pair of onaholes, 2 dolls one large and one small, a string of vibrating anal beads with remote , a dildo, a fuck toy torso, and last but, not least his mobile app. He opened it while he thought about it and was greeted with a blank expression. <br />
<br />
Kelly or now known as Kiri, stood staring blankly out at Jeff. She didn&#39;t plead for release nor did she cower before him, he guessed she&#39;d finally succumbed. Just as a test he thought he might try and get a reaction.<br />
<br />
Jeff: &quot;I guess, you&#39;ve been through enough... I&#39;m going to give you release now...&quot; He watched the screen quietly waiting for a reaction.<br />
<br />
There was none forthcoming much to his disappointment, oh well, he&#39;d give her release anyway. He idly rubbed the screen causing her to bounce with the motion. It wasn&#39;t a couple of minutes before the moans rose out of the phone. Meanwhile, Jannice had sat at the doorway trying to look smug through the pleasure of its own. It was time for him to deal with that problem as well. Jeff called the doll over to him which despite itself answered his beckoning. Setting down his mewling phone, he picked up the doll and not gently pulled the beads and dildo out of it. A gasp and a stream of fluid gushed to the floor following as it was dropped into its new puddle.<br />
<br />
Jeff: &quot;I guess you haven&#39;t learned your place. Well, now you&#39;re going to...&quot; He turned to typing into the computer as the doll came around.<br />
<br />
Jannice: &quot;My pl... ace? You&#39;re one to t... alk... You thi...&quot; It dawned on the doll what he might do. &quot;Hey, now... I... I&#39;m sorry, let&#39;s not be...&quot;<br />
<br />
The doll froze in place as Jeff hit enable to the changes he&#39;d made. He&#39;d gotten tired of its mouth running and decided to revert it back to a simple fuck toy. Picking it up, he re-positioned it so that was laid back holding its vagina open for the next dick to come in. With that, he laid it on the floor by the larger doll still holding the dripping onahole that was his mother. The fluid from the onahole hit the dolls leg and slipped down onto the slit causing it to glisten invitingly. As appealing as it was, he still had to christen his new toy as he had most others. Without much further ado, he removed his pants and carried the torso to his bed. <br />
<br />
Lifting the torso was a more difficult than the onaholes but, laid out on the bad it didn&#39;t matter any more. He held onto its sides and positioned his dick before the awaiting lips. A quick and surprisingly smooth thrust let him inside and into the soft yet firm grip inside. It had just the right give and lube to ease the work but, increase the pleasure for him. This was great because it bothered him to see his dick thrusting in and out below. It gave him an idea for a little game to himself, see if he could get deep enough to fill the inside as he came. So he thrust harder and faster and unlike the other doll (Alice), it sucked him back in gently accepting the rough ride. He let go of the sides fondling the large breasts that had been bouncing freely the whole time. <br />
<br />
He teased the hardening nipples with pinches and flicks while the tits themselves seemed to swallow his hands. The pillow soft breasts and the supple nature of the vagina were a match made in heaven. Instinctively, he leaned forward to suck on the right breast keeping his hips into the motion. A hard suck filled his mouth with a milky substance that was a little sweet to the taste. Pulling his face away from the breast, he saw it was dribbling much like the vagina had and still was. A bonus he hadn&#39;t expected but, nonetheless glad for it. His discovery led him to doing the same with the left and it gave the same. His dick hardened with the delight and he thrust deeper inside with new vigor. <br />
<br />
After suckling his fill and going back to fondling the breasts firmly causing more to dribble out, he looked at his &quot;progress&quot;. He was almost to his goal and one especially hard thrust might do the trick. So he focused on that effort feeling the pressure building inside. The vagina slapped wetly against his hips as if cheering him onward with each thrust. The vaginal fluids dribbling down his legs and soaking the side of his bed. Feeling it was time, he thrust so hard that he thought he felt the toy break but, saw the semen filling deep inside the toy. He pulled out with a pop and a rush of fluid slopped down the side of his bed and onto the floor. <br />
<br />
Basking in the afterglow, he returned to his computer chair and looked over the chronivac settings. Seeing a folder labeled &quot;Archived&quot; he opened it to find it empty as expected. Though, he knew what he would do with it. He never intended on changing any of them back anyways so he started with his mother. One last thought before he did though... He entered a special instruction to have her name signed seductively on the toy. After he hit enable, he grabbed the onahole from Alice and saw tattooed to the left lip, his mother&#39;s signed name &quot;Sharon&quot;. Just because he wasn&#39;t going to changed them back didn&#39;t mean he wanted to forget. This last change in place, he tossed the toy to the doll letting it slap wetly to the floor and archived the folder.<br />
<br />
A message appeared on the screen as he did; &quot;Archived subjects changes will be permanently locked: Ok/Cancel&quot; With a shrug, he sealed his exmother&#39;s fate consigning her changes to the archive. He followed this change to every one of his new toys. The balls of the anal beads got theirs along the side and &quot;Jannice&quot; had three on its body. Annis on the right breast and Jennifer and Challice on both lips of the vagina. The only one left unarchived was that of Kiri, he may need to make alterations in the future after all. With that he went and slept in his exmother&#39;s room since his bed was a mess.<br />
<br />
The return to school had gone quietly and uneventful, though he heard that they had finally begun to investigate Randal&#39;s absence. A slip-up on his part after having archive his changes but, no matter it&#39;d never point back at him anyway. The biology class had been replaced by a free period in the library without a teacher to conduct it. It gave Jeff time to think about possibilities of the Chronivac, so far changes to objects and to one body were possible. What about multiple objects...? He scanned a girl across the table from him and made the changes.<br />

<br />
Hitting enable he watched curiously as the girl slowly had a concerned look on her face. She looked below the table and concern became horror. Looking around and leaving the table, she started trying to get others&#39; attention to no avail. Jeff saw a trail of wrappers following her frantic flight as she grew closer to the floor. Once the change hit her hips, a pair of peach colored toys held together by panties slipped out of the fallen pants. Still she pulled herself around until her arms fell to the floor as wrappers. It wasn&#39;t much longer that her head collapsed into the last wrappers leaving behind the last peach colored toy. The most work Jeff had ever done for an experiment... He got the broom and swept the remains into his backpack, toys and all. Extra work aside, he huffed pleasingly that it had in fact worked. <br />
<br />
As he turned to leave, a girl Diana, his crush in fact approached him. For a moment, Jeff was worried that somehow she&#39;d actually seen the show the girl had made. It was dispelled as she spoke to him.<br />
<br />
Diana: &quot;So I heard you&#39;re the new Student Council President... You know, I think I could get to know you a bit better.&quot; She winked slyly at Jeff who stood, stunned at the doorway. She passed him by and out of the room. <br />
<br />
Well, this could go well or poorly, Jeff thought to himself. Leaving the room, he saw her walking down the hall without a glance backward.</p>
