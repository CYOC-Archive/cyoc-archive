<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amy smiled  as she looked down her lupine muzzle, with Tad&#39;s penis firmly inside her wet folds and his knot tying them together for the immediate future. It might be only his second time, and there were some points where some of Tad&#39;s lack of experience did come through, but he had shown remarkable progress. He might have had to curb a lot of his sexual urges while he was with his family and living likely among only normals, but he was in Moon Lake now, and in Moon Lake, it was perfectly normal for weres in love to enjoy each other&#39;s company. In fact, during the past Saturday night, she could hear the sort of &quot;wuffing&quot; roars of a wereleopard or maybe a werepanther, the howl of a werewolf, the high yips and barks of at least three werefoxes, and the softer mews and cries of a werecat faintly in the woods, and that was more than enough of a reminder to Amy about all the physical love that weres liked and were even more easily drawn to.<br />
<br />
While she didn&#39;t know if Tad was to be her future husband, yet, he was good looking and best of all, a kind heart with all that he&#39;d offered to do to help her family with regard to her brothers. A part of her seriously felt she was falling in love with him and she sincerely hoped to introduce Tad to ALL of Moon Lake&#39;s treasures and pleasures of being a were sanctuary. Where they could be safe to love one another and  not face potential hunters. And for the moment, with Jay and Leon eating lunch with Jen Decker, Amy was content to enjoy the feeling of the massive rod stretching her vagina.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
But while Tad was enjoying his girlfriend&#39;s company and also beginning to feel confident in his family being safe and secure, there were matters that were taking things down a path to potential exposure of at least weres and they related to Lionel Ulysses&#39;s end, which Tad didn&#39;t know about, yet. Ulysses had been jealous that Jeff Decker had won Jen&#39;s heart and could never accept that Jen didn&#39;t see him as anything more that someone that she helped while in high school, and that had fueled his plot for revenge against the Decker family. That led to the FBI under Teddy Green hunting Lionel Ulysses and finally catching him in Seattle, though not without its own troubles.<br />
<br />
Lionel had evaded the initial ambush by the FBI and the Seattle Police Department, but was wounded and transformed out of reflex and it was caught on the body cameras the Seattle officers were wearing. Agent Green managed to convince the Seattle police that what they caught and saw was likely a costume and wouldn&#39;t warrant further investigation, which reduced some of the potential for weres being exposed, though that would depend entirely on how vigorously the press chose to investigate the issue. So far, the press had at least officially been fairly tame and accepting of the story, but that could obviously change. The actions of another all but assured that would happen.<br />
<br />
That was the murder of Lionel Ulysses, which gained almost as much attention as Ulysses&#39;s capture. Akane no Tachibana, a widowed werefox from a Japanese noble family had noticed this and rapidly guessed at WHO had committed the murder. From her office at Tachibana Industries in Moon Lake, she&#39;d noted the CNN report that Lionel Ulysses had been caught, which raised some concern that weres would be exposed, but since the Moon Lake werefox community, the Moon Lake Skulk, which she headed wasn&#39;t a political institution she knew that meddling in legal and likely political affairs outside of Moon Lake would be dangerous. With issues closer to home at the moment, such as the coming marriage of the Skulk&#39;s newest members, Jenny Harper and Harold &quot;Harry&quot; Jenkins and the issues that with it, Akane put Ulysses capture aside and hoped that the FBI wouldn&#39;t be lead into snooping into Moon Lake&#39;s secrets.<br />
<br />
An hour later, came CNN&#39;s report on Ulysses murder and the base comment that it looked like Ulysses had been beaten senseless, and that jogged the two hundred sixteen year old werevixen&#39;s memory as to who could have done it. She remembered back to when she was younger and when her beloved Osamu was alive. It was before the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima that took him from her. It was before Japan attacked the United States in 1941 starting the Pacific War between the two powers. It was back when Japan was only just opening itself up to the west in the mid to late 1800s when a British ship came into what is now Tokyo Bay and a lone werekomodo dragon and his young son disembarked and ultimately stumbled onto Akane and Osamu residence in Tokyo when they were there for whatever issues the Imperial Court might ask for two minor nobles to be there. The scent of a reptilian were was odd to the two werefoxes, but it was more the actions aroused their suspicions.<br />
<br />
The father, Drake, was brash and arrogant and paraded himself as something of a vigilante and promising any sort of action needed to protect the secrecy of were-beasts to the point that he ignored the consequences. His young son, whom he&#39;d inexplicably named Dymixious acted in a similar manner. He claimed to be hunting a rogue were that had come to hide in Japan. Not knowing if other weres had come into Japan for purposes that were wrong, but also not wanting to take the risk of a rogue were creating a scare in Japan, Osamu had agreed to a &quot;treaty&quot; in which the Tachibana family would support the &quot;Dragon Clan&quot; as the father described it with the point that Drake be discrete and report to Osamu and Akane on his findings and that any rogue werefox would fall into their jurisdiction. Drake agreed, but a week later, a mysterious fire caught a small rural village and burned it to the ground. Drake claimed that the were was a werewolf and had started the fire, which was ultimately blamed on samurai who were not accepting the political changes in Japan in the late 1800s, but something in the way it was said did not sound trustworthy to Osamu or Akane. But then, there were no computers or video cameras that could betray weres and they had to let it go.<br />
<br />
Ulysses murder was not a similar case, and the fact that he was a were murdered after being caught potentially exposing himself as a were made Akane certain that either Drake or his son were involved as part of their own vigilante games.  It made things potentially worse, and Akane knew it. She didn&#39;t know Tad or his parents, but Ulysses&#39; criminal activity and his capture combined with the &quot;Dragon Clan&#39;s&quot; vigilante activity had the potential to make things FAR worse, and that Akane couldn&#39;t allow as exposure in a bad way wouldn&#39;t just affect the Deckers but ALL weres world wide. That was why she contacted Dymixious directly, as both he and his father staid in touch, as though the private agreement in Japan mattered in America and Moon Lake where Akane had no more political power than any other businessman or woman did and that America&#39;s constitution meant her royal rank was worthless. The murder of Ulysses would surely be investigated and the press might be encouraged to dig deeper as a result, and Akane doubted Dymixious was smart enough to avoid being caught by law enforcement without help, and his own actions might have the potential to make things even worse than he&#39;d already made them.<br />
<br />
With her call, Akane got him to come into Moon Lake where she hoped that her son Tora Tachibana would be able to get Dymixious&#39;s wife to one of the pregnancy specialists. Akane knew her son could help to a degree, but his specialization was more with spinal, nerve, and brain issues, but he was the only Skulk member Akane knew could get Dymixious and his wife to a pregnancy specialist at the hospital with the tact to have that specialist help them keep Dymixious hidden and quiet until the present heat regarding Ulysses&#39; murder. She was tempted turn him in, but at present that might do more harm to weres than good. She didn&#39;t trust Dymixious to realize that it was his own actions that would likely expose weres. All she could do was try to keep things quiet and hope the police, press, and FBI didn&#39;t come back to bite them, as secrecy was important to all weres, Tad included, and the fact that technology was advancing and making exposure even more likely eventually. Akane could only hope that the Dragon Clan hadn&#39;t made the consequences of Ulysses&#39;s actions worse for everyone, including young weres like Tad, who Akane didn&#39;t know.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re getting better,&quot; Amy smiled to Tad as they lay on his bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Tad said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Want to go again when you deflate?&quot; Amy asked and wiggled on Tad&#39;s knot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe later,&quot; Tad commented, &quot;Mom may accept us doing this right now... but she probably won&#39;t let us go all day, especially while there&#39;s still your brothers to look after.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy sighed and then nodded, but she did hold Tad to her while they waited for his erection to go down.</p>
