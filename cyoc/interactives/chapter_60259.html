<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stripes made her way to the next stable, still worried Master Equus was still mad at her.  She was now determined to win back his favor, and <br />
make sure there were no further problems with the plan.  Reaching the next stable, she quickly slipped inside, surprised the place was <br />
unlocked.   To her further surprise she saw and human male fucking a mare. Her demonic senses could see that his perversion had left a seed <br />
of taint within him, and she couldn't help but smile at how easy this would be.<br />
<br />
A quick bout of cloaking magic and a vast increase in her equine musk had her looking like the most ideal mare.  Stripes clopped over to the <br />
male, who not only was thoroughly distracted in her perverted actions, but was quickly affected by the thick musk now flooding the stable.  <br />
She crept behind him and licked his neck, before giving his ear a nibble. He looked around to see another mare, asking for his attention.  Eyes <br />
glazed over as visions of rampant horse sex filled his brain, he pulled out of the as of yet untainted mare, and turned to Stripes with a beaming <br />
cock.  She licked his face and soon he eagerly found himself making out with a striped horse.  Stripes soon undid her cloaking as she knelt and <br />
started sucking his human shaft. Each lap of her tongue, suck of her lips recreated his cock into a equine phallus.  The pleasure had the young <br />
stablehand stomping his foot as if he had hooves.  As orgasm approached, his balls swelled and turned leathery as the pumped with stallion <br />
seed.  With a horselike neigh, he shot his tainted seed down her throat. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now you're equipped to fuck a mare,&quot; Stripes cooed, &quot;But I think you need some milk to give your inner demon strength, that way you'll be a <br />
real stallion.&quot;  With that said she stuffed a black teat into his mouth, and without hesitation he nursed the milk from it.  Every gulp of the <br />
corrupted milk nurtured the demonic seed sprouting in his body and soul.  His body pumped with muscle as it reformed into a lust demon's, <br />
now real hooves stomping in excitement as evil desire washed away his humanity.  It wasn't long before a healthy Malaposki stallion  demon <br />
was standing before her.<br />
<br />
Job completed, Stripes opened up a portal back to the ranch as she called Equus.  &quot;Master Equus, forth stable reached and stablehand <br />
converted into a EQUINE lust demon. I just opened a portal for Carl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, Stripes. I expect nothing different. Have the new lust demon aid Carl and Corey at this stable before returning to the ranch,&quot; said Equus <br />
over the phone.<br />
<br />
It was then that Carl and Corey stepped through the portal to greet Stripes and the new demonic convert. The clydesdale and mustang demons <br />
took note of the new demon, before getting to work.<br />
<br />
&quot;This six horses here need at least two gallons of our demonic seed to be tainted enough for Master Equus' purposes,&quot; said Carl to the <br />
malaposki stallion. The demon snorted and nodded his head in compliance and the three of them mounted a horse. Carl at this point gladly <br />
stuffed his musky cock into a male horse, and made sure to enjoy the completion of his mission for Equus, especially if Corey was there to do it <br />
with him.<br />
<br />
Seeing the three stallions breeding into the equines had Stripe's cunt oozing in need, but it would only make Master Equus mad to waste time <br />
fucking, when she could do plenty of that later.  With that she left the stable and headed to the next warp point.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As Stripes rode to the next stable, she couldn't help but rub her snatch as she thought about all the demons under Equus' control.  Soon all of <br />
Glendale would be his, and she could be the slutty mare her body was aching to be.  That last thought had her vulva winking as she pulled up <br />
to the targeted stable.  As she clomped  out the car and to the stable to make sure no one was around, she kept thinking of the mass of <br />
demons that would soon be on the horizon. Even with the small army Equus already had, he still didn't rival Ponius' numbers. <br />
<br />
 Rubbing her clit she thought about Equus' nemesis.  She had never seen the demon, but from what she'd been hearing, he was quite powerful, <br />
powerful enough that Equus wouldn't dare take him head on.  She wondered how many lusty horse demons the Pleasure Island stallion had <br />
under his control. Pleasure Island, the place sounded like where she would rather be, than riding around from stable to stable with barely a <br />
chance to fuck.  She was soon brought out her reverie, as her phone rang.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stripes, have you reached the next stable? Mul and Fries are waiting,&quot; said Equus over the phone. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I just arrived Equus. I'm opening a portal now,&quot; Stripes said, a slight irritation in her voice. With a twist of dark magic, the two loyal <br />
demonic fiends of Equus stepped through, cocks beaming.  Their powerful musk and aura, dampened Stripes thoughts of disloyalty as, she <br />
remembered the great sex she had with the both of them, especially Mul.<br />
<br />
As if reading her mind, Mul stomped his hoof and blast a  pint of demonic spooge onto her face.  <br />
&quot;Hey my exotic filly, when we're done with this I'm going to fuck that leathery cunt raw,&quot; teased Mul as he and Fries, unlocked the stable with <br />
enchantment.   Stripes swooned at his words and squeezed her teat to shoot a stream of milk into his fur.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I'll definitely need it,&quot; she replied.  Soon brays and neighs were echoing out the stable as the two filled the equines with corruption.<br />
<br />
From stable to stable, Stripes entertained her ideas of what was to come, of who would be the victor in this demonic battle and who would <br />
bring her the most sex her winking cunt desired.  By the time she had made any conclusions, they were on the last stable.  Master Equus' plans <br />
for Glendale's corruption going at top speed, and soon the Equestrian Center would be a powerful base of tainted lust and corruption.</p>
