<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sara&#39;s consciousness started to stir as she felt the world shacking slightly. A little rougher at some parts, but a pretty consistent shake. She opened her eyes slowly and saw she was in her family&#39;s car. Through the windshield was the site of the city coming closer, and then she realized her head was lying on something firm yet a little soft. She was also hugging on something close to her chest. Gaining focus Sara looked to what she had wedged between her breasts and clinging to like a teddy bear and saw that it was an arm. Looking at who she was laying on she found that it was Stan... There was something about this embrace that felt so right. His warmth providing strength. Sara then gained clarity and her face grew red and she pushed off of Stan and said &quot;Wahuh!?! Stan! Sorry! What&#39;s happening?!?&quot; Their dad was curious about what was going on, but as he was driving he kept his eyes on the road.  Their mom looked behind to see her son looking tired yet not some husk, and was glad to see the kids she raised up and seemingly healthy. Stan himself noticed Sara stirring so he was only slightly surprised by Sara&#39;s actions. <br />
Their mom said &quot;We&#39;re going to the city to... We found a Succubus Brothel that seems to be rather nice for Succubus that just found out they are Succubus. With the way you were hiding yourself in your room we thought that you may not be able to survive at home, and... Well you&#39;ve been asleep for a two days. We figured if we didn&#39;t do something you&#39;d starve yourself so we thought it would be for the best if we brought you to more of your kind... and since we figured we wouldn&#39;t be seeing you for awhile. Well we would all come and help you settle in.&quot; She kinda grinned and said &quot;Then during the rid you started getting a little clingy to Stan and...&quot; she had a look on her face that said she enjoyed watching her son squirm a little. &quot;Well we figured that maybe it would help you not starve on your way to the brothel.&quot; <br />
Sara let out a little chuckle and said &quot;Well... thank you Stan. I hope you aren&#39;t feeling woozy or something.&quot; <br />
Stan said &quot;It kinda feels like I&#39;ve been jogging for awhile, but I&#39;m going ok.&quot;<br />
Sara sighed a little in relief and said &quot;Just as long as you are ok. I may not be your sister sister, but I still care about you like a sister.&quot; The rest of the ride was rather quiet as the family tried to enjoy each other&#39;s company despite not really knowing what to say. Although when they got into the city the siblings started excitedly pointing things out to one another. It was after all the second time they went out and saw the sights. <br />
<br />
The brothel was only a little tricky to find. It sort of looked like an apartment complex, but the front door and sign looked a little fancy. The family was able to find some parking, and then they walked in to find... That the front was pretty empty with no one at the front desk. Also the front was basically just the front desk and then a staircase and elevator. <br />
Sara asked &quot;Did you make an appointment or something?&quot; <br />
The mom said &quot;I called and was talking about it... Maybe...&quot; The door behind the family opened a minute later the family spooked looked behind and saw a tall lady with a trench coat and a large hat on. <br />
The lady and the family looked at each other for a second and then the lady asked &quot;First time I&#39;ve seen a family come in for some special time, but I think there are a few of us getting a bit hungry so-&quot; <br />
The mom said &quot;We&#39;re not here for that, our adopted daughter turned out to be a succubus and I called and I thought today would be ok-&quot; <br />
The lady said &quot;Alright alright, calm down. I&#39;ll go call the boss.&quot; the lady got out her phone and did a quick call. A small one sided conversation later the lady said &quot;Alright, the trains were delayed so that&#39;s a fault on our side. I can however get little Sara get settled in. Hope you didn&#39;t pack too much, we&#39;re a little tight on room.&quot; The lady went behind the counter to look for a key and said &quot;My name&#39;s Rose by the way.&quot; and finding they key got out and said &quot;Ok, Sara let&#39;s go get your stuff and get you settled in to the Hostess section.&quot; Sara nodded and the family went back to their car and they got out a suitcase and a backpack they had packed for Sara. They went back in and when the whole family tried getting into the elevator with them Rose put her hand out blocking their path. <br />
The dad asked &quot;What do you think your doing?&quot; <br />
Rose said &quot;I get your adoptive family and think of her as one of your own. I&#39;ve got a soft spot for the family that raised me to, and I still keep in touch. However these Succubus brothels only work as well as they do because we tend to have a family dynamic as well. We support each other, make sacrifices for each other, and share in each other&#39;s joys. A long time ago Brothels used to let the adoptive families join in on easing new Succubi into the Brothels. It added too many complications and made transitioning into a Succubus a lot harder than it needed to be.&quot; <br />
The dad a little angry stated &quot;So you&#39;re cutting us out of her life entirely!&quot; <br />
Rose sighed and said &quot;Not a single succubus here or anywhere that I know of ever cut ties with their adoptive family without good reason. Such as the adoptive family was abusive, neglectful, or dead. The brothel is a place for succubus and their dirty deeds, adding family into the dirty deeds  areas has confused many succubi in the past. Have you heard these lines before? I&#39;m not going to turn into one of those demonic nymphomaniac sluts! I can live without succumbing to those desires! Girls like that really need to be just around other succubi and customers while inside the brothel.&quot; <br />
The mom said &quot;This is ridiculous! We&#39;ll go-&quot; <br />
Sara yelled &quot;Just let it go!&quot; her hands and legs were shaking with nervousness and said &quot;I did have those thoughts and... I don&#39;t think Rose here is lying about any of that stuff. I&#39;ll text and call when I can so... I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ll ever get used to all this but... I&#39;d like to try to adjust to my new life as easily as I can.&quot; Sara felt like crying as her eyes grew a little moist. Seeing the family loosen up Rose let her hand go and the elevator door close and lift the two succubi up. <br />
<br />
Rose said &quot;Well... That was pretty strong there little Sara. Any questions while we ride up?&quot;<br />
Sara leaned back on one of the elevator walls and asked &quot;Are we sluts?&quot; <br />
Rose chuckled and said &quot;There are a few Succubi that manage to get by with just a single partner, but they tend to be married. Know someone from their childhood that they never let go of. So most of us do in fact have a lot of casual sexual partners. However there&#39;s little meaning. Sure I&#39;ll remember really good or bad experiences, but do you look down on someone because they&#39;ve eaten hundreds of slices of bread?&quot; Sara cocked her eyebrow up a bit and Rose continued &quot;Some of us get addicted to sex. That&#39;s just how species that have sex are though. For most of us Sex is just food. Sometimes it&#39;s a little special, but most of the time we do what we do to sustain ourselves and maybe make a little money on the side. Outside of changing eating food with having sex there&#39;s very little that would stop us from being different from most other creatures. You&#39;ll figure that out soon.&quot; The elevator started to stop, &quot;Well here&#39;s your floor.&quot; and the door opened to show.</p>
