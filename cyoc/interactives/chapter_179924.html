<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>As long as he’s stuck in Brie&#39;s body and life Kyle from here on out will be referred to as and think of herself as Brie Madison.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Huh? What wish? Oh, no, I didn’t mean to wish you were dumb!” Brie exclaims.<br />
<br />
These words came far too late to effect any change in the situation as a pink mist spewed out of the bottle spout and began twirling around the Genie at breakneck speed. This envelopment continued until the Genie was completely lost in a haze of pink and Brie looked on in a state of wide-eyed shock. Then as quickly as it had begun the pink mist started to dissipate and Brie’s eyelids grew larger and her mouth began to drop open as the figure of the Genie emerged from the mist. The new Genie was everything a man would have wanted in a classic Arab genie beauty. She wore a sparkling gold-leather bikini with gem and jewel encrusted chains hanging off each side of her bikini bottoms as a trim piece and the front of her tie-bikini top had sparkling diamonds embedded in the leather. A long flowing see-though purple sash covered the front and back over her bottom piece. Very high-heeled golden leather open foot sandals adorned her feet with the same colored straps wrapping around her feet and up her ankles like a snake. A solid gold collar sat around the genie’s neck that was also encrusted with gems and diamonds. The woman was gorgeous with a dark olive complexion, long flowing black hair combed straight that drooped past her breasts, and an expertly makeup-applied face that begged to be kissed. This new Genie looked to be in her late teens probably not much older then Brie herself.<br />
<br />
Brie was stunned at what she was looking at and the fact of the matter was anyone who had the chance to witness what she just did would be just as stunned. The Genie stood in her same spot not saying a word. She had her arms folded together in front of her breasts and she leaned on one foot while the other was stepped out in front of her body. The Genie’s face had a curious look on her as she contemplated what to say. Brie decided to make the first move “Hey Genie are you OK?” Brie stammered in a nervous tone. This is all it took as the Genie’s face lit up in pure joy at this address “Hey Mistress I’m like soooo happy to see you! What can I do to make your day more fun.” The genie finished her bubbly response with a giggle. Brie was very confused and she would be a fool if she didn’t feel a bit of fear as well seeing what her sudden and accidental wish had done to her Genie let alone her wish earlier that had turned her from a teenage boy into her former sisters best girlfriend. The genie was now not too far off in intelligence and personality similar to Brie and Amanda. Brie’s wish-master now resembled a ditsy high school girl rather then a competent genie. Brie knew she would have to take this slowly and carefully as she didn’t believe she was dealing with the same genie as before.<br />
<br />
“Hey Genie I’m like so happy that your OK and thanks so much for helping me. By the way I love what you’ve done with your hair and makeup, and I love that outfit girl!” Hearing herself talk like she did angered Brie more then anything, she had no say in how she pronounced words and sentences but instead read them out of her mind like Brie naturally would. How she said the sentence angered her but what she had said frightened her. She did really appreciate the Genie’s makeup and hair style and even though it was a bit too much in the fantasy realm she really did love the genie’s bikini outfit. Moments ago she would have looked at a girls hair, makeup, and outfit and decided whether she thought that the girl was attractive to her now she looked at those same things and wondered how good and attractive she would look with them applied to herself. A stroke of terror invaded Brie’s mind at what her earlier wish had done not only was she acting like a bubbly teenage girl but she was also beginning to think like one too. Brie had already begun thinking of herself as a ‘her’ and ‘she’ without even a whimper of protest.<br />
<br />
Hearing the complements come from her mistress sent a rocket of joy straight to the Genie’s heart. The mistress was not only happy with her earlier wish to change herself but mistress Brie also wanted to make sure the Genie herself was OK and that to Genie was the sticking point of a good person. “Maybe she will be as wonderful and kind as my last master?” Mused Genie. Genie after being freed by her original master was no longer bound by the laws that governed her kind of course she had decided to make Brie her new mistress but she could now leave at anytime, cast wishes anyway she wanted, and even cast her own wishes based on her desires. Hearing the complements come from her mistress and the joy that permeated her being from those words Genie knew that she had to reward her mistress and she knew just the way to do it. “Oh Mistress thank you so much for caring about me and telling me I’m pretty. Here let me make you pretty too.”<br />
<br />
Brie did not see this coming as Genie lifted her hands and twirled her fingers around towards the direction of Brie. More terror punctuated Brie’s mind and made an appearance on her face as she surmised that more magic was being directed her way and began to try and twirl around to run out of the room. Before Brie could even make an attempt to turn around she found herself locked to the floor in her standing position. The pink mist from earlier had re-materialized at her feet and and was rapidly twirling up her legs enveloping her body as it did. Brie tried to move and even tried to scream but her body was frozen stiff as the pink mist continued up her body and soon covered her in a pink fog. The process felt longer then the few seconds it took to complete and soon after she was covered up the pink mist evaporated into the air and Brie found herself standing where she had been before and now able to move.<br />
<br />
Something didn’t feel right to Brie and she only needed to look down to guess what had happened. The denim skirt white tank-top, and sandals that Brie had been wearing before was gone and instead she was now wearing the same golden-leather bikini outfit and heels as her genie minus the neck collar. Looking downward also revealed that her blonde hair had been lengthened and straightened to perfection and the ends now hung below her breast-line. Brie should have been angry with the Genie and she was a little bit but not in the degree that she would have been just a few minutes ago. “I’m so ticked off by Genie right now, but for some reason I just love how I look, so why should am girl like me be angry?” Touching each part of the outfit with her hands and striking poses for her eyes Brie’s female mind further and further solidified itself over her old male mind. Seeing how much her mistress enjoyed her new look the Genie materialized a full-length mirror in front of her mistress so she could get a better view. The mirror appeared right in front of her and the smitten Brie Madison was further enticed by the incredible view reflected back at her in the mirror “That sash is to die for and I have the same makeup as Genie!” Brie verbally beamed in her mind as she looked away from the mirror with a huge smile on her face. Running to her Genie she wrapped her arms around the Genie’s neck giggling and squealing in delight “oh Genie, thank you!, thank you!, thank you!” squealing and shaking in happiness. Genie hugged Brie back in joy and answered “I’m like always here for you mistress, whenever you need me I’m here for my besty!”<br />
<br />
Completing the hug Brie and Genie separated but both held each of the others hands and stared deeply into their eyes smiling greatly. Just then Brie had a wonderful idea “Genie thank you so much wait here I’m going to go show Amanda this outfit I’ll be back.” Leaving Genie with a body spin that sent the purple sash twirling Brie pranced out of the room expertly navigating in her high-heels and giving her large behind a swinging exit. Genie looked on in smiling silence at her good work and the thought that she had kept the promise of her original master intact as she dissipated her form and flew back into her new bottle. Shivers of joy rattled down Brie’s spine as she shivered and squealed at the thought of showing Amanda and her friends the outfit that she had on.</p>
