<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ann sighed as she now began cooking her dinner. Work had been hectic and after hearing about all the insanity at Lisa’s house her mood had only darkened. “Are you sure you don’t want me to come over Lisa,” she asked.<br />
<br />
Lisa had insisted that things were under control, despite Gloria being given a diagnosis of epilepsy and ending up in the hospital. “Between Lynne’s anger, Gloria’s illness, and everything else around here it’s probably best you stay at your place sis,” Lisa had said. “I appreciate you wanting to help but right now I think me and Jason need to handle our girls on our own.”<br />
<br />
Ann slammed a pan onto the stove as she thought back to her conversation with Lisa. Unfortunately her sister was being stubborn, things sounded like they were out of control and she needed as much help as she could get. Lisa, in true Lisa fashion, wanted to handle things herself. “And she wonders where Lynne gets her stubbornness,” Ann smirked. Sighing Ann now began cleaning up the mess she had accidentally made.<br />
<br />
Although Lisa didn’t want her help, Ann was able to make plans for the weekend. Megan and Stephanie would be coming over tomorrow evening for dinner. She was very excited about this as it would be the first time the girls would all be together for dinner. Whatever they decided to do afterwards was to be determined, they could have a nice quiet night at Ann’s home or possibly hit the town. Ann couldn’t wait, after spending most of her life being lonely she was finally getting a chance to socialize with friends. <br />
<br />
A knock at the door brought Ann out of her thoughts. “Huh,” she murmured. “Not expecting anyone.” Curiously Ann now put dinner on hold as she made her way towards her apartment door. Glancing through the peep hole she smiled before throwing the door open. “Jackie,” she exclaimed happily. “What are you doing here?”<br />
<br />
Jackie smiled as she now hugged her best friend. Jackie had obviously used the Ring of Age as she was now 42 once more. Ann couldn’t help but find the adult Jackie attractive, her full curves, C cup breasts and mature face made Ann’s heart flutter ever so slightly.<br />
<br />
“Sorry to drop in unannounced,” Jackie smiled. “Things have been a bit crazy back home. Everything going on with Gloria and Lynne has kind of made things harder than it needs to be.”<br />
<br />
“Tha bad huh,” Ann said to which Jackie nodded. “Yeah,”Jackie nodded. “Sasha punched Lynne dead in the face then Gloria got sick after Lynne got in a huge fight with her family. Everyone is walking on eggshells right now...kind of why I wanted to get away for the weekend.”<br />
<br />
“Well Your always welcome here,” Ann smiled, beckoning Jackie inside. “Just wish I was a little more dressed up for the occasion. Wasn’t expecting company tonight.”<br />
<br />
Jackie suppressed a giggle as she looked at Ann’s dress. The woman was wearing an old T-shirt, sleep pants and purple fuzzy slippers. “I don’t know I think it’s cute.”<br />
<br />
“Your too kind,” Ann laughed. “Anyway was just cooking up some stir fry. You want some dinner?”<br />
<br />
“Dinner sounds great,” Jackie said happily as she settled onto the couch. As she began to settle in she smiled coyley at Ann, admiring the woman’s figure as she continued to cook.<br />
<br />
“So,” Ann continued, her back turned to Jackie. “How were you able to pull this off? Aren’t your folks going to be curious where you are this weekend? Also how did you get here?”<br />
<br />
“Thankfully Gloria and Tricia are covering for me,” Jackie said. “My folks think I’m spending the weekend with friends. Tricia was able to age me up and transport me here useing her magic, so I don’t have to worry about anything til Sunday.”<br />
<br />
“Well that’s good,” Ann said, turning and smiling at Jackie. “Still you should be careful. Hate to see you get in trouble at home.”<br />
<br />
“Well look at you acting all mature,” Jackie said playfully. Ann shrugged as she returned to her cooking. “Well remember I am older.”<br />
<br />
Jackie smilies impishly as she gazed at Ann. When she had mentioned this idea to Tricia and Gloria they had told her to be very careful. Jackie had insisted she could handle things after a little bit of training, now it was time to put her plan into action. Reaching into her pocket, Jackie now held Tricia’s Ring of Age. “We’ll see about that,” she whispered impishly as she made a wish.<br />
<br />
Ann shivered slightly as she stood at the stove, something felt off. As she looked herself over she watched as her breasts began to perk up ever so slightly. Quickly running her hands over her lean body she was surprised to see the slight bit of weight she had put on hips seemed to have vanished. “Hey,” Ann stated in shock. “What did you do?”<br />
<br />
Jackie said nothing as she continued to smile. Ann had a feeling what happened, running to her purse she produced a compact mirror as she gazed at her appearance. “Very funny,” a now 30 year old Jackie said.<br />
<br />
“Yeah my bad,” Jackie said impishly. “ it that’s not the only thing I did. Why don’t you check your license.”<br />
<br />
Ann raised an eyebrow as she now dug into her purse. Finding her license Ann gazed at it before gasping in surprise. “What the hell! How!?!?”<br />
<br />
Ann’s license had been altered as well. Instead of her usual birthdate and age, Ann could see that the year had been altered. Now instead of listing the woman as 42, it stated she was 30.<br />
<br />
“I was able to alter reality as well as your age,” Jackie smiled. “Now, your only 30 as far as the world knows. Don’t worry though things will return to normal by tomorrow. Tonight though I guess I get to be the older one.”<br />
<br />
Ann smirked as she placed her hands on her hips. “So tell me then,” she smirked. “What are you going to do to me. Never been the younger one in this relationship.”<br />
<br />
“Let’s see what happens,” Jackie smirked. “After all we got all night.”</p>
