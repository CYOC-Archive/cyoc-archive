<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alice was quick hug Tom with all her might. She was happy at the decision, though in many ways she didn&#39;t really think that Tom wasn&#39;t going to join her at all. After all, his points weren&#39;t about a lack of love or anything. Like many things, his issue was with a point of honesty and trustworthiness.<br />
<br />
&quot;That makes me very happy... but, I must ask, why the sudden eagerness?&quot; Alice asked as she looked to him and stepped aside to let him in and so that she wouldn&#39;t be showing the security cameras any shot of her in nothing but a bathrobe.<br />
<br />
Tom slowly walked in and explained the nightmares he&#39;d been having and the fact that he lost Alice in each of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s odd in many ways,&quot; Tom spoke, &quot;I&#39;ve never really had much luck with women... but in many ways with you... it&#39;s different.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps that is just the difference between meeting someone who&#39;s only interested in the &quot;right now&quot; and doesn&#39;t have the heart for &quot;forever,&quot; which I assure you...&quot; Alice spoke, &quot;I&#39;ve been feeling a strong bond forming... which among werefoxes lasts forever. I&#39;d be by your side no matter what.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom slowly nodded as Alice lead him into her living room and sat him down on a couch. For while she was happy that she&#39;d get the chance to bond with him in every way that a werefox loved, she also knew that Tom was a smart and dedicated man. He may love her as she loved him, which he indicated by coming back to her apartment in the middle of the night. As much as Alice&#39;s heart soured with happiness at Tom&#39;s decision to be her dog-fox she also didn&#39;t want him to rush into anything just to be with her, and based on what he described, it sounded like he&#39;d had one whopper of a nightmare. Loving her was great, as far as Alice was concerned, but she also wanted Tom to be in sound mind and of sound judgement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Tom said weakly, &quot;Everything in that dream...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It scared you and you responded in fear,&quot; Alice nodded, &quot;a sign that you&#39;re falling for me too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom looked up to her and watched as she gave a giggle and let one hand drift down toward her waist. In this it let her bathrobe opened  little and he was soon surprised to see it open to reveal the rather impressive valley between her breasts. It let him figure out that she was completely naked underneath that bathrobe. She then leaned toward him and held his hand, which only further gave him a view of her cleavage.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s a good thing,&quot; Alice continued to smile, &quot;but at the same time... don&#39;t let nightmares get to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm?&quot; Tom asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You had a nightmare and one that reinforces the sorts of fears that weres have had with exposure, which in a sense does let you see some of the fears we weres have,&quot; Alice said softly with a warm smile, &quot;but in a way... you were also right earlier. Weres have lived in an unseasoned fear for far too long that in many ways it&#39;s come to a point where weres will probably look for excuses to never reveal the secret. I&#39;ve met plenty of people here who are both liberal and conservative who have all been good people and all that... and you were right that the scenario most feared isn&#39;t always the one that WILL happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you don&#39;t fear it?&quot; Tom asked.<br />
<br />
Alice shook her head, &quot;Oh I fear it. I&#39;d be stupid not to...&quot; She then scooted closer to him and pulled him into a warm hug and continued, &quot;but in a way you were right. The world is changing and advancing toward a point where weres can&#39;t expect to stay hidden forever... and if we wait until an incident with a rogue comes out and reveals weres doing what stories say we do... then that&#39;d only assure that the response would be bad because they&#39;d only see our &quot;bad side.&quot; But coming out while things are peaceful and we can strive to make things better and let everyone work together...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you&#39;d...&quot; Tom began nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doing this would take some work and not something that I&#39;d ask you to rush into,&quot; Alice spoke, &quot;as there will be some things that will need to be done to make it work... but we&#39;ll be at a point rather soon to prepare for a new world.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom nodded and Alice continued to hold him warmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, when will you need to get up for work?&quot; Alice asked as she stood him up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d probably need to be up by six,&quot; Tom said slowly, &quot;they got me doing sports right now and covering the game at the Link. Right now its practices and planning and the opportunity to, and I quote: destroy the worst team in football.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn&#39;t sound very happy,&quot; Alice commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve never really been a sports fan,&quot; Tom admitted, &quot;but my editor didn&#39;t like my digging into Lionel Ulysses...&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice lead him deeper and into a dimly let bedroom. She set Tom on the edge and slowly began removing Tom&#39;s shoes. When she got them off, she lay Tom back and rubbed his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... get through it, and sleep well... I&#39;ll make sure you&#39;re up,&quot; Alice told him, &quot;as my alarm is set.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom looked to her as she stood over him and then tucked a set of blankets up over him. He wanted to ask her something, especially as he saw her bathrobe drop to the floor to reveal her large and firm breasts, her wide hips, and neatly trimmed pubes above her vagina, but at the moment his own tiredness caught up with him. He yawned and actually fell asleep, though he could feel Alice crawl into bed with him. She slowly patted his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;You make me happy, my love,&quot; Alice whispered and began to drift off to sleep.<br />
<br />
She was happy and knew that she and Tom would have a very happy future. She didn&#39;t tell Tom this, as prophecy dreams might be a bit much, but before he&#39;d arrived she felt like she was having one. The big reveal of all weres was coming, and while it wouldn&#39;t be easy, it wouldn&#39;t be as bad as Tom&#39;s nightmare. In fact it wasn&#39;t even close, as it ended on January 20, 2021 with Tom being sworn in as America&#39;s first were President on a platform of &quot;the truth will set you free.&quot;</p>
