<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Hayley” smiles to herself as she watches every animal, domestic and wild, interact with humans, ‘well… the world as just gotten a much nicer place,’ she thinks to herself.<br />
<br />
The “girl” doesn’t notice someone watching her a few feet away, ‘damn, that young woman is hot,’ a 30-year-old man thinks to himself, ‘she’d totally be my type, I’d just need to find out if she’s single or not’. As the man starts to walk towards the “woman”, he is unaware that she is much younger than he thinks, and the closer he gets the more stunning she seems to become, the man smiles, stopping two feet in front of the girl, “excuse me miss,” he says, “I couldn’t help but notice you sitting by yourself, so I decided to ask if I may sit with you”.<br />
<br />
“Heyley” looks up to see a man with short brown hair, brown eyes, an athletic figure and a friendly smile on his face, the “girl” finds herself smiling, “sure, I’d like to have some company,” she then finds herself saying, “please, have a seat”.<br />
<br />
The man’s smile grows, “thanks,” he says, sitting down beside the 14-year-old, “my name is Ricardo Alverez, but you may call me Rick, if you like. What is your name?”<br />
<br />
“Hayley,” the “girl” says, “Hayley Davis”.<br />
<br />
The man smiles, “what a beautiful name,” the man replies, “it’s the perfect name for such a stunning woman as yourself”.<br />
<br />
“Hayley” is taken aback and she feels herself blushing at the comment.<br />
<br />
Rick seems to notice, “oh, was that to direct,” he asks, his smile fading, “sorry… I didn’t mean…”.<br />
<br />
“Hayley” cuts him off, “n-no… I mean… yes, it was,” she says, “but… but it’s okay, I was just surprised, I wasn’t expecting it”.<br />
<br />
The man smiles a little, “still, I shouldn’t have been so direct,” he says, “I… it’s just that… well… I can’t help myself when seeing such beautiful women… if I may say… you… you are by far the most beautiful woman I have seen in a long time,” he says, sounding somewhat nervous before blushing and turning away, “s-sorry… I better shut up!”<br />
<br />
“Hayley” finds herself giggling, “you’re funny,” she says before smiling, “I honestly prefer people who speak their minds so freely”.<br />
<br />
Rick turns back to look at the “girl” and smiles, “yeah, I prefer that too,” he says, “I mean… at least with people, who speak their minds freely, you know what you get. Nowadays it is hard to tell if someone is genuine or who is just… you know… acting”.<br />
<br />
“Hayley” nods, “I totally agree,” she says, smiling, “you seem like a nice guy, Rick,” she then says.<br />
<br />
Rick smiles, “you also seem like a nice person, Hayley,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Hayley” chuckles, “I try my best,” she says.<br />
<br />
Rick chuckles, “you are doing a fantastic job,” he says, both then laugh, “you know,” Rick then says, “you are the first person I meet who makes me feel welcomed in this city”.<br />
<br />
“Hayley” tilts her head, “oh? You’re not from here?”<br />
<br />
Rick shakes his head, “I moved here about a month ago,” he says, “I’m not even from this state. I was born and raised in New York”.<br />
<br />
“I see,” the “girl” says, “so, what do you think of Florida and Miami so far?”<br />
<br />
“It’s… different, but not in an unpleasant way,” he says, “I mean, I still have to get used to the new area, but so far I am adapting pretty well, my new job is running smoothly and I have a comfy apartment”.<br />
<br />
“Hayley” smiles, “that sounds good,” she says, “if you don’t mind me asking, what job is it you do?”<br />
<br />
“I work at a security company,” Rick says, “we help business with their security systems, by installing or upgrading their technical security systems and providing them security guards. We also do security services for large events”.<br />
<br />
“Cool,” the “girl” says, “and what is your job at the company?”<br />
<br />
“I work in the IT-department,” Rick says, “but since I am trained in martial-arts and have a background as an officer, I sometimes help out as a guard, but only if it’s necessary”.<br />
<br />
“Whoa, so cool,” the “girl” says.<br />
<br />
Rick chuckles, “what about you,” he then asks.<br />
<br />
“Oh… I’m still going to school,” the “girl” says, “and I honestly don’t know what I want to do yet. I was thinking becoming a lawyer or do some kind of office job”.<br />
<br />
“I see,” Rick says, he then smiles, “if you’d like, I could ask my boss if he’d like to interview you. He is currently searching for a secretary”.<br />
<br />
“Hayley” tilts her head, “aren’t I still to young to start work,” she asks.<br />
<br />
Rick chuckles, “well, you would have to finish school first,” he says, “but it wouldn’t hurt to ask, because, once you are done with school, you’d have a place to immediately start working and you wouldn’t have to search”.<br />
<br />
“Hayley” thinks for a while, the “girl” then smiles, “sure, sounds good to me,” she then says. The “girl” is unaware that Rick is mistaking her for an 18-year-old woman, and having the mind of a 10-year-old boy, causes the “girl” to not think rationally.<br />
<br />
Rick smiles, “I’ll ask my boss on Monday,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Hayley” smiles, “thanks, Rick,” she says, “by the way, do you have a family?”<br />
<br />
Rick shakes his head, “sadly I haven’t had any luck so far finding the right partner,” he says, “what about you?”<br />
<br />
“Hayley” shakes her head, “neither do I,” she says, “I mean… I’m to young for that kind of thing”.<br />
<br />
Rick chuckles, “you aren’t to young, Hayley,” he says, oblivious that the “woman” is only 14 and that “she” is not really a woman/girl but a 10-year-old boy who had transformed himself into a girl, “you are old enough to created your own family, all you need is the right man who’d make you happy”.<br />
<br />
“What kind of man,” the “girl” says without thinking.<br />
<br />
Rick smiles, “a man that would protect you from harm,” he says, “a man who’d treat you with respect and love”.<br />
<br />
“Hayley” chuckles, “sounds like yourself,” she says.<br />
<br />
Rick chuckles, “well, to be honest,” he says, “you’re my type of woman, Hayley,” he says, “however, I don’t want to force myself upon you”.<br />
<br />
“Hayley” tilts her head, ever since the man had sat down beside her, she felt weird, her stomach flutters every time she looks at the man, and her body feels warmer than normal, the “girl” is unaware that her body is attracted towards the 30-year-old. These unfamiliar feelings, and due to the fact that “she” still has her boy-mind, causes “Hayley” to not really think about her words, “you don’t look to bad yourself, Rick,” the “girl” says, smiling, “to be honest, ever since you sat beside me, I feel a weird connection to you. I’ve never felt this way before, I feel weirdly protected and safe in your presence, as if nothing and no one could harm me”.<br />
<br />
Rick smiles, “I’d never let anything harm you, Hayley,” he says, “the feelings you are going through, means that you are attracted to me. I too feel a strong connection to you,” the man then takes one of “Hayley’s” hands in his, holding it gently, “Hayley… I… I think I’m in love with you, I know we have just met, but… but I think… I think we fit perfectly to each other”.<br />
<br />
“Hayley” stares down at the hand, the weird feelings increasing, “Rick… I… I don’t know,” she says, “I don’t know if this is a good idea… I mean… I’m still so young… my parents would never allow it”. The “girl” is unaware of what Rick means, due to “her” mentality of a 10-year-old boy, “Hayley” thinks that Rick is talking about being friends, the “girl” is oblivious to what the man really is talking about.<br />
<br />
Rick smiles, “again, I am not going to force myself upon you, Hayley,” he says, “I want you to make your own decision, you are old enough to do so, you shouldn’t care nor worry about what your parents might say or think. Do what you feel is right”.<br />
<br />
“Hayley” is silent for a while, ‘he’s right,’ she thinks to herself, ‘I may be just a 10-year-old boy, but I am old enough to make my own decisions, I’m tired of them treating me as if I were a baby. Rick is such a nice guy, my family doesn’t need to know!’<br />
<br />
“Hayley,” Rick asks carefully.<br />
<br />
The “girl” looks up at the man, who is half a head taller than she is, giving him a smile, “you are right, Rick,” she finally says, “I’m old enough to make my own decisions, I shouldn’t care what others say”.<br />
<br />
Rick smiles wide, “I’m happy to hear that,” he says, “Hayley… may… may I kiss you?”</p>
