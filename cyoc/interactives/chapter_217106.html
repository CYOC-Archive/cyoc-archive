<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Officer Bradford Connors was a simple man. But a simple man that felt crushed by the system of society. He had worked to become a policeman like his father and his father before him, and did so, only to be assigned the mundane work.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t like there was no crime in his city, no. In fact, just last week there was a high-profile robbery. But Bradford always got sidelined. He would admit, yes, he wasn&#39;t exactly the most...in-shape...of his fellow officers. Nor was he the brightest. But he managed to get this far, he should be given assignments other than litter duty. He always wished he could be one of those mounted policemen.<br />
<br />
But today, his luck would change, just not how he expected it to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your wish is my command!&quot; he heard a voice say before he was engulfed in purple smoke.<br />
<br />
The rotund officer was forced onto all fours, like he was about to do push-ups. That is, until his arms and legs bent themselves unnaturally and raised him up in height. Bradford saw rich brown hair sprout from them and grow up throughout his body. He tried to move, to stand, but any attempts to during this process sent intense pain down his spine. So, he braced until it was over, feeling his fat shift and distribute throughout his body. <br />
<br />
His torso stretched out and broadened, as his thighs and now rear legs thickened with muscle. The front followed suit. He was getting heavier now, heavier than he was before, but all that weight was now muscle of a horse. All that pressure was hurting his hands and feet, though, eliciting many cries of pain and anguish from him. Fortunately (or unfortunately) for him, that problem resolved itself soon enough, his feet curling up and morphing into hard black hooves, as his hands did the same. <br />
<br />
He felt his neck stretch out, his vocal cords modifying themselves and turning his anguished cries into neighs. His face pushed outwards, mouth and nose morphing together into a muzzle as his ears moved to the top of his head and became more pointed. His green eyes become dark and moved to the sides as he felt his short auburn hair turn into a long black mane.<br />
<br />
Around his rear, a matching black tail sprouted, swishing back and forth. But that wasn&#39;t the only thing changing around his rear. Bradford whinnied as he felt his human testicles retreat into his body, being recycled and reformed into the plumbing fit for a mare. A few fleshy mounds grew out from that area as well.<br />
<br />
His, or rather her, clothing has long been shredded during the process and she now stood naked. She kept her human intelligence, and tried to cover herself, to no avail, flopping and falling on her side, hooves waggling about. She then tried to reach the lamp and undo this, but could not find it anymore. In fact, where she was now was not where she was a moment ago.<br />
<br />
The new mare looked around and found herself in some sort of stable. A door clicked and she looked to see a police officer walk in, leading a stallion in by the reigns. Something about that stallion made her feel a sudden warmness all over that her human mind did its best to ignore.<br />
<br />
The officer smiled at her and put her head. &quot;Well, hey there, Star.&quot;<br />
<br />
Star?<br />
<br />
The officer patted the stallion. &quot;I brought in good ol&#39; Bruce. You&#39;ve been doing good work, girl, but you&#39;re heat&#39;s making you a bit aggressive. &#39;Sides, maybe sometime later we&#39;ll get some more like you on the force after this,&quot; he winked and then let the stallion into her stall.<br />
<br />
Bradford, or apparently &#39;Star&#39; now according to the officer, backed up a bit. Somewhat out of a fear, and somewhat because of how large the stallion was. He was a dark-coated one with a white diamond on his forehead.<br />
<br />
But she was having trouble staying away from him. Her new animal hormones made her tail lift up, her new sexual organ winking. <br />
<br />
&#39;No...I won&#39;t let this happen,&#39; she though, closing her eyes and imagining this wasn&#39;t happening. But it did nothing to help. The stallion recognized her scent, her need, and nudged his muzzle to her rear, sticking his tongue in to lick it. New sensations flooded her body, making her shake. She tried to get away. Resist! Do...what could she do?<br />
<br />
She was stuck, no genie, no way to communicate. At least....at least she was still part of the police force apparently. As one of their horses, it seemed. Her thoughts were cut out for a bit, her mind going fuzzy in ecstasy as the stallion climbed onto her back and thrust into her multiple times, his thick girthy member penetrating her wet folds.<br />
<br />
She couldn&#39;t help but give into her instincts, rocking back and forth in rhythm with the stallion.<br />
<br />
When it was all over, she lay down on the ground. She&#39;d do better in this life and be a good mare for the force.</p>
