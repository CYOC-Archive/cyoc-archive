<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">We all turned to look at the TV.  It was tuned to one of the news channels.  There was a breaking news story.  It said that companies and corporations all over the world were ready to reevaluate themselves in order to ensure that they could remain in business some way, and that they could keep all of their employees.  It all seemed very complicated, but the word was being spread that beginning on Monday, which was two days away, people should report to their jobs as normal to find out what would happen to their jobs. <br />
 <br />
For the next fifteen minutes or so we just listened to the news report.  When they began repeating information, Pam said, “So they still don’t know what exactly will happen.  How terrific.”<br />
 <br />
“I guess we’ll just have to wait until Monday,” I said.  “I still think that Rachel and Joyce have the most to worry about.”<br />
 <br />
Joyce sighed.  “Something will work itself out,” she said.  “It usually does.”<br />
 <br />
“I’m not going to worry,” said Rachel.  She looked at me and said, “After all, I can always count on the…”  She stopped talking as soon as she realized what she was going to say.  I couldn’t prevent myself from giving her a shocked, wide-eyed look.  Finally she finished her sentence.  “…The fact that Joe can support me.”<br />
 <br />
“Oh, yea,” said Joe.  “Of course.”<br />
 <br />
“I think it’s time for another quick photo session,” said Rachel, conveniently changing the subject.  Everyone forgot what Rachel said a moment ago and we had another quick session.  There were only two other interesting developments at this point.  Our heights had stabilized.  We were the exact same height as the previous photo session, so I assumed that meant we wouldn’t shrink any further.  I had been 6’4” but now I was 5’9”.  I thought that was still pretty tall for a woman.  Scott had been 6’1” and was now between 5’5” and 5’6”.  Carl had only been 5’10” to start and now stood 5’4”.  More importantly, our penises weren’t really penises anymore.  They no longer had any recognizable shape.  They were basically loose pieces of skin that were hanging out and waiting to be sucked into our pussies.  They were extremely sensitive as well.  Afterwards we followed through on a previous promise we made and drank another toast.  “To our tits!” we all shouted gleefully.<br />
 <br />
For the next hour or so we didn’t do anything all that exciting.  We all had something to eat, we all drank a little more and we all watched more TV.  The changes continued at a steady pace.  All three of us now possessed typically long, feminine fingernails.  The nail polish that had been spread on our fingers earlier still covered the whole nail even though they grew longer.  Our hands had grown smaller and daintier as our fingers thinned.  Our arms also continued to thin until they matched the girls’ arms.<br />
 <br />
Rachel was proven right about our figures.  Our waists continued to narrow and our stomachs flattened.  When we were eating, Carl remarked, “Normally I would eat a lot more, but now I just don’t have the appetite.”  <br />
<br />
Pam joked, “That’s because you don’t have the stomach for it anymore.”  Everyone laughed at that remark.  <br />
<br />
Our hair was now at the point where it was significantly different.  Carl’s hair had definitely acquired a natural curl to it.  It appeared that it may have actually stopped growing longer and was now just growing thicker.  As of right now his hair came down to the middle of his shoulder blades in the back and just above the top of his budding breasts in the front.  Scott’s hair was both darker and fuller.  Instead of a dull brown his hair now possessed a deep auburn hue.  His hair remained straight and still seemed to be growing, though as of now it was no longer than Carl’s was.  My own hair, meanwhile, appeared to have hit puberty.  Up till recently it had grown slowly.  In the last few hours, however, it had lengthened from barely touching my shoulders to halfway down my torso on both sides.  By far I had the longest hair in the room, even longer than the three women.  I thought about cutting it right away, but I decided I should wait to see if it would grow any more.  I didn’t want to interfere with the process of the wish, after all.<br />
 <br />
We were all excited as our breasts continued to expand.  The tiny little buds that appeared were still in their early stages.  We looked to be in the first stages of female puberty.  So far all of our breasts had the shapes of tiny cones.  It was obvious that they had enlarged since we first detected their appearance.  One thing in particular stood out to me and that was my nipples.  They must have doubled in size, and they were clearly larger than either Scott’s or Carl’s were.  This was an early indication that Rachel would get her wish and I would indeed end up with big tits. <br />
 <br />
At this point, only our faces remained completely unaltered.  This looked weird since we had almost entirely female bodies but male faces.  Pam started to cry a little.  “What’s wrong?” I asked.<br />
<br />
She answered, “I’m never going to get to see your faces again.  You’ll have new ones that I’ll have to get used to.”  That didn’t seem to have any impact over Scott or myself, but I understood what she meant. <br />
 <br />
It was sometime in late afternoon when I began to feel new sensations coming from inside my pussy.  It felt like a snail slowly crawling along a steady path.  I had a pretty good idea of what had just happened, but no one else said or did anything.  So I kept quiet until I felt the sensations pass.  It took maybe half an hour or so, but finally that weird feeling subsided.  As soon as it did I looked down at myself.  My penis was gone.  It had finished becoming my clit and positioned itself inside me.  I was now, in my mind, officially a woman.<br />
 <br />
I stood up and announced, “I’m a woman now!”  As soon as I said that I put my hands over my mouth.  My voice had changed again.  It was higher than even before and had very few, if any, traces of maleness to it.  “Ooh, in more ways than one,” I added.  I was startled, but intrigued by the sound of my voice.  It had a certain breathiness to it that I never had previously.<br />
 <br />
Scott and Carl checked themselves and found that they were now women, too.  Their voices were also higher.  Our transformations were entering the final stages.  Then Pam asked, “So now that you’re all women, and you two are now my sisters instead of brothers, are you going to use the same names?”<br />
 <br />
Great question, Pam.</p>
