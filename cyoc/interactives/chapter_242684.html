<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She picked one and pressed the button without looking too closely, almost whimpering as she throbbed and ached. It was a great shock to suddenly hear a gurgle and feel her belly expand. Wait, wait, wait!<br />
<br />
Did she input the pregnancy one?! With the eggs???!<br />
<br />
The flashing screen showed that yes, she had! No, no, no! She tried to abort it but the Chronivac’s screen did not change, the haunting bright read ‘initiating’ splashed across her screen.<br />
<br />
She grunted, feeling more weight in her belly, feeling it, feeling her eggs (oh no), bump into each other as her belly swelled even more. She leaned forward, her tits actually resting on her pregnant belly, her hard cock was pressed against the swell of it below. Holy shit, she was big! What eggs did the Chronivac assign her? How many??<br />
<br />
With dread, she looked up at the complete jingle and read the effect.<br />
<br />
Transformation complete:<br />
Pregnant with goose eggs, quantity 36.<br />
Bonus: Pregnant with one (1), random egg.<br />
<br />
Three dozen!? Three dozen big goose eggs! And a random egg too?!<br />
<br />
She could almost cry but her body was already preparing for the egg laying. Holy fuck, thirty-six goose eggs, plus one more. Her cock felt even harder, she was such a freak, oh goodness.<br />
<br />
Daisy shuffled to her bed, grabbing her towel on the way. No way was she laying thirty-six eggs on the floor! Her poor knees. Fuck, her poor asshole is going to be so sore!<br />
<br />
She grunted, hand on the edge of the mattress as the first eggs travelled down, towards her anus. With dread, she looked at the clock. It was 3am, oh, well, at least she has time to go through this! Small mercies?<br />
<br />
She felt her entrance twitch in anticipation, more slick gushing out of her, her cock fucking twitched too, as she made herself a little nest (hah! Bird pun) on her bed. (She was definitely going to do more laundry today, Lauren can laugh all she wants!) <br />
<br />
Daisy grunted and gasped as the eggs rolled over her sensitive prostate, her dick repeatedly twitching and even smacking hard against her very pregnant belly, as she pushed goose egg after goose out of her body. Her eyes rolled when the really big ones pressed into her organ, her cock a twitching, dripping mess with her aching balls hanging underneath her. Sometimes she’d press a hand against her taint, just to feel the egg roll from the other side, or to even press down a little harder to make fireworks and stars burst behind her eyelids, her eyes rolling in pleasure in a state of pain-pleasure-pain and not coming!<br />
<br />
She ached so badly but she was also enjoying herself so much, her cock bobbing and twitching, her rim stretching and having eggs drop out of her onto the towel. Her nipples were so erect and milk had started dripping from them a little.<br />
<br />
Daisy lost count after the fifteenth egg dropped, leaning forward on her bed as egg after egg left her body, her pregnant stomach shrinking down and her cock feeling every subtle shift of the eggs within her or the soft fat of her belly dwindling. Reaching behind her, she grabbed her pillows, resting her chest against the stacked pillows and easing the strain on her knees. <br />
<br />
Her belly was smaller now but it still hung down, her tits no longer resting on it but her cock was flushed against her abdomen. She could feel her balls shift as the egg rolled out of her and onto the bed, the hard shell a welcome pressure against them.<br />
<br />
Suddenly she gasped, hands flying out to grab the pillow in front of her. Her balls drew up and she came all over her pillows, her bed and towel. She couldn’t even enjoy the afterglow after finally coming because she reached behind her, touching her taint and recoiled. It was bulging, distended and so stiff to the touch. Fuck, the egg was huge! It was that random one! It was the last one?<br />
<br />
Her eyes screwed shut as she bore down, her abdomen clenching and pushing, her entrance, already so sore, struggled to open up to the egg. She felt it crown slightly only to slide back inside her. Fuck, come on!<br />
<br />
She got off her bed, mindful of the three dozen eggs (holy fucking shit! That’s so so much!) and squatted down, maybe gravity will help her. Her pelvis ached as did her entrance, but she pushed and pushed. She couldn’t see past her balls or half hard cock (she’s such a freak), but she could feel the difference immediately.<br />
<br />
With a grunt, she pushed harder, her breath held as she felt the egg move. It was crowning, stretching and stretching and stretching-! It was stretching her wide open! She drew in a started breath, the energy gone but the egg didn’t slide back in. Fuck, it was half out at this point.<br />
<br />
Daisy reached down and felt the hard shell, her fucking balls were resting on the thing even! It was so big. Her abdomen clenched against and she pushed, her hand reaching underneath her to catch the egg as it finally popped free.<br />
<br />
She panted, falling onto her knees. The egg was huge and had a pointed top, a soft cream colour. Her cock was red and dripping, flushed against her soft not-pregnant belly once more. Dazed, she put the egg on the bed, it was about twice the size of the goose eggs she laid.<br />
<br />
Turning to sit on the cold floor gave her aching rim a balm and she pumped her dick, wanting to come before taking care of the mess on her bed. It was with a few tight squeezes and firm strokes that had her spilling in her hands. She wiped the mess onto her ruined sheets (laundry it is for sure). <br />
<br />
With her cock finally soft, her balls and ass sore and tits dry, Daisy got to work stripping the bed after moving the eggs into a padded box. She placed it in the corner somewhere, right next to her pile of soiled sheets and clothes.<br />
<br />
She closed her laptop (leaving the Chronivac alone), dressed herself, then refitted her bed with new clean sheets and flopped onto it. <br />
<br />
Daisy was out like a light.</p>
