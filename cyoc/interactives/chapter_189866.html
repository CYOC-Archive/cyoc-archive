<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A part of you really wanted to get started, many of the places in town that hired summer help might wait until after the school year ended to open up those positions, but they also often were very quick to schedule interviews and see who and where they place new employees. And with the fact that as MILF-wolves, with Luna turning you and Luna growing up to the point where she would naturally transform, meaning that neither of you could hold jobs in restaurants or groceries, to assure that there wouldn&#39;t be a case where your milk got into something and resulted in accidental MILF-wolf transformations. Some of that came from fears that erupted early on when Luna&#39;s mother became the first MILF-wolf, but a lot of that was something more that MILF-wolves were a new type of werewolf and thus what was &quot;unknown&quot; lead to accidents. Once MILF-wolves were better known those sorts of accidents decreased dramatically different. In some ways the MILF-wolf numbers continued to grow, but by now, pretty much every knew MILF-wolf had made a conscious decision to become a MILF-wolf. You also privately figured that there were probably a fair number that were like you, transgender and wanted to become MILF-wolves to feel they were in the right gender.<br />
<br />
But those rules were there, and it was doubtful that anyone would change the rules for you and Luna. It then limited where you and Luna could work, the part of you that wanted to be responsible did center on being able to do something, particularly with Luna pregnant as a result of the last thing you did as a man. Learning she&#39;d loved you in much the same way you&#39;d loved her made you want to make it up to her and show that you wouldn&#39;t just be into her for sex or anything like that. And getting a summer job was something that struck your mind as something to do to show that. That you would do anything to make her feel better, and it was something that fetishes or anything else didn&#39;t apply to, and it was something you&#39;d learned from your father. Sure, there&#39;d been times where his politics made you nervous on some things, but your relationship with him was never truly bad and you knew he loved your birth mother and step mother dearly. You wanted to show the same love and responsibility to Luna. You were about to go through the various possible job openings in your home town of Clawthorn when you and Luna both heard footsteps coming down the stairs.<br />
<br />
You looked up to find that it was Kellie and Roxie coming down the stairs in human form for the morning. Like you and Luna, they&#39;d obviously changed back either when the sun came up or shortly after. You couldn&#39;t be sure as yesterday morning, the rising sun and your return to human form woke you up. This time, both you and Luna had slept through the change from MILF-wolf to human form. Kellie was wearing a pair of cotton shorts and a white tee-shirt while Roxie was wearing a pair of jeans and a more casual red V-neck shirt. It was all casual and something that might be expected for a day around the house, but could also make sense given that Roxie&#39;s job was fairly remote and she rarely had to go anywhere to inspect things as part of the business she ran and from the visit to City Hall the previous day, you got the sense that Kellie&#39;s job gave her the days around the full moon off. Thus they wouldn&#39;t have to go out for the day, and that would make sense on those three nights of the full moon with the new day being the last of those three days.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, good morning, you two,&quot; Kellie gave a warm smile, &quot;Good to see that you&#39;re up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sleep well?&quot; Roxie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; you answered, &quot;as Luna was there... though I can&#39;t believe we just drifted off at the end of the movie...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The two of you both were starting to nod off before the movie ended,&quot; Kellie answered, &quot;but you two looked cute together and we didn&#39;t want to disturb you. I went and got a guest blanket and laid it over you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, mom,&quot; Luna smiled, &quot;and I slept well too... partially because Nickie was by me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna&#39;s parents smiled and nodded to each other. You guessed there was some reminiscing going on over their own past.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s like when you and I were young and getting to where we were just starting out,&quot; Roxie said to Kellie while taking Kellie&#39;s hand, &quot;I&#39;d hold you, you&#39;d hold me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Kellie nodded, &quot;I remember. I&#39;d wager that a lot of this for Luna and Nickie was something that&#39;s been long building... and it&#39;s wonderful to see them happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
You blushed a bit, as the point was true and was embarrassing, adorable, and loving all at the same time. The two of you had been secretly interested in Luna in a romantic way and Luna admitted to feeling the same way about you. Neither of you had realized it until you arrived, thinking Kellie would be able to lead you you to MILF-wolves or lure MILF-wolves onto the two of you, and then finding out that Kellie was the first MILF-wolf and that Luna had been born one and was waiting until the apparent genetics around MILF-wolves meant that some time after she turned eighteen she would take MILF-wolf form because of her birth. It was something that you both had hidden, and Luna couldn&#39;t deny it by that point because she transformed in front of you. You then couldn&#39;t avoid admitting your love for Luna because your entrance had startled Kellie and she moved to protect her family, and by becoming what you had longed to be you were admittedly rather eager. And learning Luna loved you was enough to give you the confidence to return that love. In some ways it was like a fantasy romance where two best friends find themselves in love with each other and not realizing it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mooooom,&quot; Luna gave a groan, and noticed she was blushing too.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s no need to be embarrassed,&quot; Kellie gave a chuckle, &quot;you two were friends for years, and on levels that girls that you hung out with weren&#39;t... and Nickie as Nick always seemed respectful eager to hang out with you. It&#39;s partially what lead me to suspect that there was some attraction there for quite awhile.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And young love is beautiful,&quot; Roxie had it, &quot;Kellie and I had it when we met in college when I was still Rook. And in an interesting way... we had it again when I became MILF-wolf. I never expected becoming female would actually rekindle something that wasn&#39;t necessarily dim... but it did. There&#39;s nothing wrong with what you have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, dad,&quot; Luna answered with a brief nod to Roxie. On some level Luna&#39;s use of the male pronoun to Roxie seemed a bit odd, given that even in her human form Roxie was a voluptuous middle aged woman, just as Kellie and Luna were, just as you now were, but at the same time you really couldn&#39;t say what would fit better given what you&#39;d been told on who Roxie really was. But the fact that Roxie approved of you being with Luna so quickly also meant you weren&#39;t going to challenge anything on that level.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; you added.<br />
<br />
Roxie smiled and nodded, &quot;you&#39;re welcome... and in a way it is good that you two were also thinking on things to do for the summer. Kellie and I will help all we can, particularly when the little one arrives in nine months, but thinking ahead and being responsible is always good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We were only just getting started on that when you came down,&quot; you answered<br />
<br />
&quot;And there will be plenty to think and talk about on that,&quot; Kellie commented, &quot;among other things. Though that can wait for a moment. Why don&#39;t you two get dressed. Roxie and I can start on breakfast and we can discuss things further when you&#39;re ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
You and Luna nodded. You stood up and hugged before heading up the stairs, with you carrying the blanket under your arm. Kellie and Roxie meanwhile moved the other side of the couch to head to the kitchen. Though your mind pondered on what Kellie meant by &quot;other things.&quot; As you reached the door to what was now yours and Luna&#39;s room you looked back to Luna as she followed you in.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... what would you think the &quot;other things&quot; is?&quot; you asked to Luna.<br />
<br />
She gave a small shrug and answered...</p>
