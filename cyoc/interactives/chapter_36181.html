<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">James was glad it was the weekend. With the weekend came Spring break and that meant a week and a half of no school. Not that he hated school, but he was just sick of the bullies and incompetent teachers.<br />
<br />
He briefly wondered why the school districts would plan for the kids to return on a Thursday, couldn't come up with an answer and decided to get up and get some breakfast. Eating his morning meal, James figured he would go see his best friend Serj and see if he had any ideas on what to do for a week and a half.<br />
<br />
But James step father had other ideas and under the watchful eye of Tobias, James would spend the day doing chores.<br />
<br />
After dinner he still wasn't able to get away as Tobias gave him a new list of chores and as he drunk his beer he remarked, &quot;Maybe this'll teach you to call me Tobias. Get it through you head, boy, I'm your father.&quot;<br />
<br />
Groaning, James set to work and slowly finished up the list. It was just past eleven when he finished and stumbling to his room, he managed to pull of his clothes before he fell onto the soft bed.<br />
<br />
That night he had a strange dream. He was in a section of town he'd never been in. Scared, he wandered about, looking for something that was familiar. The dream shifted and a bum that looked like Tobias appeared in front of him and said, &quot;Pick it boy. Pick it up now or I'll hurt you for not calling me father.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking down, James saw a filthy looking amulet in the gutter. Just as he was about to pick it up, he was awoken by the sound of a vacuum cleaner.<br />
<br />
Yawning he pulled on a pair of clean of pants and stumbled to the bathroom. Out in the hall he found his mother vacuuming. Mumbling a good morning to her he disappeared into the bathroom for the next five minutes.<br />
<br />
Afterward he finished getting dressed and yawning still, James made his way toward the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Serving himself a bowel of cereal and sitting at the table, his mom looked up from the Sunday paper and said, &quot;Your father had gone out of town on business.&quot;<br />
<br />
James merely mumbled to this news, &quot;Whoopee!&quot;<br />
<br />
Closing her paper, she looked over at her son and said, &quot;I know you miss your father, but please try and give Tobias a chance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Picking up his half eaten bowel of cereal, James told her hotly, &quot;He'll never be my father. He can never replace dad. I hate him and I don't want him to ever come back from whatever business he's taking care of. May his car find itself wrapped around a tree with him at the wheel!&quot;<br />
<br />
Slamming the bowel down inside the fridge, he slammed the fridge, collected his shoes and coat and left as his mother was calling out, &quot;James Rufus Patterson! You get your butt back here right this instant!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ignoring her, he made his way through the garage and out the side door. Wandering around a bit, letting his anger cool, James eventually made his way over to his friends house.<br />
<br />
When Miss. Dennison answered the door, he asked if Serj was home and was right away greeted by his friend, who had pushed past his mother. Serj invited him in and the two sat for the rest of the day playing video games in Serj's bedroom.<br />
<br />
About five the phone rang and Miss. Dennison explained that James had a phone call. Taking the receiver, he was right away greeted by his wailing mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, what's wrong?&quot; James tried to holler over his mother's crying.<br />
<br />
Sobbing, James mom wailed that Tobias had been in a terrible accident and wanted to know if he would be alright staying with the Dennison's for the time being.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll need Miss. Dennison's permission, but I don't think it'll be a problem,&quot; James reassured her.<br />
<br />
Turning to Serj's mother, he asked and was told that that would be aright. Repeating the message to his mother, he was then told to put Miss. Dennison on the phone.<br />
<br />
Handing her back the phone, James wandered back in Serj's room to continue his game. After a bit, Miss. Dennison wandered in and said that he would be staying with them for a while.<br />
<br />
Saving his game James said to them, &quot;Might as well go get some stuff from the house.&quot;<br />
<br />
Serj said he would come along and the two departed.<br />
------------<br />
<br />
Returning about an hour and a half later, James and Serj were served dinner and then both returned to their video games. Around ten thirty Miss. Dennison came in said, &quot;Lights out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Going into the bathroom, James pulled on his Pajamas. Back in Serj's room, he crawled into his sleeping bag and the two spent the next hour talking about random stuff. Eventually they both drifted off to sleep and James found himself once again having a familiar dream.<br />
<br />
He was back in a section of town he did not recognize. As he stared up at the white building in front of him, a building that seemed out of place, he was approached by the same bum who said, &quot;Pick it up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking down in the gutter, James could make out the medallion he'd dreamed about earlier. Leaning down, he picked it up and brushed the filth off of it. It was bronze in colour and had the word Zulo printed on it. Just as he was about to ask about it's meaning.....<br />
<br />
He was awoken by Serj, who had rolled over in his sleep and right off the bed and on top of James. Muttering an apology, Serj climbed back into bed and was soon fast asleep. But sleep did not come easy to James and when it did, he did not dream about the bum or the Amulet of Zulo, as he'd now started calling it.<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
The next day, Monday, he spent the day playing video games with Serj and only stopped for meals and to go down to the library.<br />
<br />
There he used the internet to research Zulo and the medallion and after his time was up, had no answers on what it was and why he had dreamed about it now twice.<br />
<br />
Sighing, he returned to the Dennison's. Miss. Dennison had a date and had left them money to order a pizza. After a dinner of pizza and coke, both sat up till midnight watching a creature feature movie on the Scifi channel.<br />
<br />
Yawning, both were climbing into bed when Miss. Dennison came home with her date. Lying in the dark, both could hear the two start too moan passionately. Sighing, Serj clamped his pillow over his head, while James laid there, wrapped up in his sleeping bag, wondering to himself, &quot;Will I dream about the Amulet of Zulo tonight and why do I dream about it?&quot; This question and more raced through his head as he drifted off to sleep.<br />
<br />
He was outside the building again and not waiting for the bum, he looked down and pulled the medallion from the gutter. Brushing it off, he began to wander about when his dream shifted.<br />
<br />
He was in a store full of uniforms. Accidentally brushing the amulet against a school uniform for a fifteen year old high school girl, he failed to notice the spark of blue energy that leapt from the amulet to the uniform and than back. From there it sparked into his hand.<br />
<br />
So engrossed in the uniforms, for there were more than just school uniforms, he failed to see the transformation over take him. His red hair grew longer, while his skin grew softer and took on a more feminine appearance. His muscle structure shifted sexes and his chest slowly moved out into a B cup. Looking at a Spartan uniform, he failed to notice as his penis and testicles folded up into his body and the area between his legs split to reveal the pink gash of a female.<br />
<br />
As he reached up to pull down the Spartan costume, the vulva formed, followed by the cervix, uterus and ovaries. Having pulled the costume down, James failed to also notice, as set the Amulet of Zulo down on a shelf, as his normal five foot three frame grew into a five foot five frame. So intent on the costume, James completely failed to notice as the final traces took hold as he became a she.<br />
<br />
And had James noticed, he would have said that this was dream and anything can happen. Turning, he saw something she had not noticed; a book on a pedestal.<br />
<br />
Dropping the costume, ignoring the amulet, she moved to the book and just as she was opening it.....<br />
<br />
Serj's alarm clock went off. Groaning, James reached up and turned off the annoying thing. Standing, he made his way to the bathroom. Feeling the need to drain his bladder, he reached down his boxers....<br />
<br />
And felt only smooth skin where his penis should be. Gasping, James pulled down his boxers and looked at the sight presented.<br />
<br />
Seeing no penis and no testicles, James then noticed the way his shirt pushed outward gently. Stepping out of the boxers, James pulled off the shirt and turned to the mirror hanging on the back of the door and nearly screamed.<br />
<br />
Looking back was a five foot five tall teenager with a small build. Budding from her chest were two B cup shaped orbs. Placing his hand between his legs, James felt the Clitoris and Clitoris hood, the urethra and vagina. Suddenly his dream came back to him and he realized now what he'd missed; that somehow he'd transformed into a fifteen year old female version of himself.<br />
<br />
Her full bladder drew James back to reality and as she sat down on the toilet, James leaned forward and marveled for a bit on how strange it was to be peeing sitting down as the urine shot out of her urethra.<br />
<br />
Slightly worried, James grabbed a handful of toilet paper after she was done peeing and completed her business. Afterward, she put back on her shirt and boxers, thought briefly at how nice these clothes felt pressed against her skin and exited the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Creeping back into Serj's room, James picked up her discarded jeans and started to go through the pockets. She eventually found her school Id, which confirmed that everyone still knew her as a male teenager.<br />
<br />
Wondering what she was going to do, a voice from behind said, &quot;Good morning. What are you doing in my room and wearing my friends clothes? Are you his girlfriend he's never told me about before? Because that would be news to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Turning, James could only gasp at the what she saw. Serj had also undergone a transformation. Looking at her friend James asked, &quot;What did you dream about last night?&quot;</p>
<hr/><h3>What do you do now?</h3>
