<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Your job for this week is, as a Disability Toilet for the overweight at Cloudfield Hospital&quot;, Philip&#39;s jaw dropped as he approached the computer noticing the lack of any options to close the screen, he was about to place his hand on the mouse, when suddenly he froze unable to move as his body asserted itself without his control, back straight with his arms at his sides.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Why did I think that being a plug socket would be the worst&quot; Philip, thought to himself.<br />
 <br />
Within moments he started to feel light headed as his room faded out of view, only to be replaced with a large bathroom with many stalls and a large full body mirror along the wall facing all the stalls.<br />
 <br />
Without control of his own body he walked towards the end stall it was the largest with a 4 foot wide entrance with almost 3 times the volume of the other stalls, it had a small window that was closed on the side wall viewing the car park, and two hand rails on either side to aid the user, there was a large toilet roll dispenser on the left wall, yet in the middle near the rear wall was a massive floor pipe with no toilet to be found.<br />
 <br />
Philip at this point began to fear the inevitable, &quot;Maybe no one will use me, its empty right now and there are plenty of other stalls, people might be too embarrassed to use me&quot;, Philip sighed depressingly, as he felt as if a pair of invisible hands had began to guide him.<br />
 <br />
Slowly he was turned around and felt a pulling sensation as he was lowered onto the pipe, his butt and hips tingled as they widened, The pipe was a lot larger than a normal toilets but to accommodate the toilet he was becoming his anus began to match the circumference of the floor pipe. Suddenly the large pipe slowly entered, Philip felt overcome with bliss, &quot;WOW this is...&quot; the euphoria overwhelmed Philips senses realising that he was docking with the pipe as it began to slide up completely as he moved lower to the floor.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Maybe this won&#39;t be so bad after all...&quot; Philip began to relax from the euphoria, slowly his muscle control returned, raising his hands in front of his face he noticed that his hands had taken on a white porcelain colour, &quot;Well of course, I guess this is to be expected..&quot; Philip thought curiously to himself, as the white spread across his arms, over his shoulders and past his hips and then finally down to his feet. He started to notice as his hair fell out all over his body in clumps on the floor only to disintegrate within moments. &quot;This is so weird&quot; Philip began to feel his arms taking in the smoothness the was now texture of his skin.<br />
 <br />
Within moments of feeling his arms, he felt a need to close in his legs as best as he could and place his arms around them in a fetal position. Within moments of completing that action his arms felt as if they had became stiff, pressing tightly against his legs. The sensation continued to increase as they began to merge together forming and shaping into the base of a toilet along side his bottom, sealing him to the floor. He could tell he was much larger than a standard toilet already as his base was over a foot and a half across. &quot;God, what am I going to look like when this is all over&quot; Philip began to worry about himself, as he continued to take the sensations in.<br />
 <br />
Feeling the changes spreading upwards, his knees began to merge with his torso and lower neck, as this was happening his lower half had began to gain mass and volume, &quot;I&#39;m getting huge, I guess I need this to support...&quot; Philip tried to gulp, only to realise he could only look forward as his throat began to change becoming deeper as if his throat went down to the centre of his mass that continued to grow larger finally connecting to his piping.<br />
 <br />
His head and mouth began to go separate directions, his head touched the wall behind him and began to spread across it forming into a very large tank as his brain and other organs began to merge with the porcelain and plastic around them. Within moments one of his eyes began to form into what he believed would be his handle. As his tank finalised removing any remaining human features as his mouth looked quite horrific at this point began to shift.<br />
 <br />
His teeth began to merge together as his upper lip separated into 2 distinct sections. His jaw, lower lip and mouth merged with his lower base as it continued to grow and gain volume, even without eyes at this point he could still look down from his tank watching as a toilet seat designed to handle the girth of a much heavy individual grew from one part of his upper lip. He watched as his bowl settled into its wide form as his upper lip started to flatten and relax against his tank becoming a large oval lid to cover his bowl and seat.<br />
 <br />
As the final changes finalised into place, what was left of his ear merged with the piping in the wall as the water began to fill his tank and bowl for the first time, his remaining features vanishing completely, until there was nothing but a large water tank, a very wide toilet seat, bowl and base to accommodate the morbidly obese.<br />
 <br />
&quot;WOW, I can see me self in the mirror and shift my view as If I was looking up from the bowl, this is crazy!&quot; Philip looked at himself in the full body mirror across the wall from him. He thought he looked pretty good considering. Using the mirror he could see into the other stalls, he was at least 3 times the size of the other toilets &quot;At least I&#39;m unique and not just another in the row&quot; he chuckled to himself mentally about what price he’s paying for a payroll, being crapped on his entirely life and maybe soon quite literally, he sighed to himself realising the irony of his fate.<br />
 <br />
Suddenly he heard a voice as someone appeared in front of him, &quot;Hello, I&#39;m Lohse I with Transdem Labs. I was just looking over the paper work hoping to catch you before your first day&quot;. I know this isn&#39;t what you was expecting but try to understand, we are gathering information regarding the experience of inanimate transformations to improve the Chronic device, it is important for our research if you fully experience this as the object you are&quot; grinning to herself as she looks towards the very large toilet.<br />
 <br />
&quot;You will be able to enable a enjoyment protocol in the event this becomes to much for you, if you do so this, we will deduct part of your payment for the remaining time of the week as it will affect our data gathering. We also provide a loyalty bonus where by your salary can reach six figures if you opt out of the enjoyment protocol permanently&quot;, she continues to review the paper in front of Philip hoping for a reply.<br />
 <br />
&quot;You can speak your know once I finalise you, you will be unable to speak and so if you want to ask me anything its best you do quickly as this department your in has began to open.&quot; she said looking towards the toilet annoyingly.<br />
 <br />
Philip tried to speak but realised it was like gargling water. &quot;*gurlg* Is there *slosh* any *glopp* part of this I will enjoy, *splosh*&quot; he asked as best as he could.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Well considering your a toilet I can alter a single parameter as its not required for our testing but then I must go&quot; she entered something into a device she was carrying and reached over to his handle, it was sensitive she pushed it down as Philip&#39;s tank had finally filled flushed for the first time, Philip experienced the ultimate orgasm like ejaculating if only you was ejaculating tormenting amounts of water, he felt it all around his bowl tasting the water as it sloshed over the inner rim and down his throat pipes, moaning loudly as water began to settle once more in his bowl.<br />
 <br />
Lohse giggled at this, &quot;Well looks like you&#39;ll have fun, remember try to stay positive and what your function means to the innocent folk who have to attend here, but before I go, according to the time tables about mid-day a cleaner will arrive to ensure you continue to be hygienic, Bye!&quot; Lohse began to fade from his view as he settled from his high.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Well this is starting to feel exciting if it feels like that everyday I can get used too this&quot; Philip began to think to himself and settle into the day, eyeing himself in the large mirror, his thoughts drifted to imaging what he would look like once someone uses him to feeling horny and wanting to be flushed like that again..<br />
 <br />
Suddenly he heard a noise from the far side of the room as the door opened, he would have gone white if it wasn&#39;t for being porcelain, within seconds reality had sank in, as he heard foot steps approach.</p>
