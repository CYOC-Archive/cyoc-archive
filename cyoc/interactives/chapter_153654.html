<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Colin mulled over what to do next. He wanted to make some big changes, exciting changes. He had an idea in mind of who he wanted to change, but not how yet. So, for now, he settled on refining some details. <br />
<br />
“Hey Jane, you said I look better when I wear clothes. What kind of clothes do you think would look best on me?”<br />
<br />
Jane was a fashion savant and her eyes lit up at the question. “Oh, finally caring about your appearance eh? Alright, let’s see...hm...well, you’ll want something to work with those beautiful sapphire scales of yours. I’m thinking a nice crimson track jacket to really make them pop. Can’t go wrong with a black undershirt. Go with some gray chinos, darker grey so it doesn’t distract from the red or blue, and try some white loafers. Black leather belt, and a silver wristwatch. Hm, yeah, that would look nice. Are you going to go shopping?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t have to; isn’t it cool that I have my own personal tailor who made all of that for me yesterday?”<br />
<br />
“Yes,” Jane replied in her trance as the outfit she had just described instantly appeared on Colin’s body. <br />
<br />
It looked really good. Everything was custom-made no only to fit his muscular physique, but also to accommodate for his draconic features, such as extra holes for his tail, wings, and the claws of his feet. The fabric clung tightly to his frame in a satisfying way he had never experienced before, having always worn baggy clothes before. Every flex of his muscles was visible through the fabric, still showing off his body without going naked. But the nice thing was that he knew he could go back to wearing nothing at any time, without fear of drawing stares. He would actually draw more stares now with his fashionable outfit than he might have otherwise. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, it looks great, Colin; glad you took my advice! Sergio did a nice job.”<br />
<br />
Colin’s mind told him that his tailor’s name was Sergio, even though he hadn’t existed until mere seconds ago. He wondered if the elderly Italian man he now knew was someone who had existed before, or if his power had also created an entirely new person. He thanked Jane for her help and headed to the bathroom to check out his new digs. He admired himself in the mirror for a bit, loving how sexy and handsome his new dragon body was. While he did, he came up with a plan for what he would do next. But first, he needed to relieve himself. In his excitement, he hadn’t had his morning piss yet, so he shut the door and walked over to the toilet, unbuckling and unzipping his pants fully to watch the new process. <br />
<br />
He wondered how it would work with his new cloaca and retracted member, but he found that when he got ready to pee, his cock reacted on its own. Colin stifled a moan as his slick member slid from its housing into his hand. He was surprised to see that it wasn’t any bigger than it had been. He had assumed it would come with his new body, but since he didn’t explicitly ask for it, nothing had changed in its size. What was new was that he now had a fully prehensile penis that he could control as deftly as his tail. The smooth red member hung at its normal six inches as it emptied his bladder of a strong-smelling piss that reeked of what must be dragon musk. Everything about this turned Colin on, but he still wanted to be bigger down there, like he thought a dragon should be. He didn’t want to ask Jane, though. Even if the power worked, that would be an awkward thing to bring up to his sister. That wouldn’t matter, though: his next change would solve that. <br />
<br />
Colin zipped up and headed out the door, telling his sister he was going downtown to shop around. When he stepped out the door, he did the first thing he wanted to do, spreading his wings and taking off through the air. The feeling was amazing, like pushing off from the bottom of a pool. His momentum carried him up...up...up high above the treetops where he instinctively spread his new limbs to glide towards town. It was like second nature, his body acting as though he had always been able to fly, even though his conscious mind knew this was all so suddenly possible. Occasionally beating his wings to get more lift, Colin managed to mostly ride the updrafts until he reached the buildings, where the air currents were less predictable. He circled down like an eagle, touching down gracefully outside of the apartment building where his target lived. Passers by watched him in awe of his outstanding form, but once they gawked for a bit they moved on their way. Colin realized his earlier phrasing had made anthros possible, and even accepted, but not common. Even less so an anthro of a mythical creature. He stopped a man in the street who had to look up at him, even though he was three times older than Colin was.<br />
<br />
“Excuse me, sir, can you take some time to answer some questions for me?”<br />
<br />
“Yes,” the man replied, losing his uncomfortable and annoyed look at being stopped by someone he didn’t know, instead gaining a friendly demeanor as he waited patiently to answer Colin’s questions. <br />
<br />
“Am I the only anthro dragon in the world?”<br />
<br />
“Yes.”<br />
<br />
Colin knew that he was now unique, and that his appearance was usually met with more hesitance than other anthros received. But he was fine with that, because he knew the looks were almost always in awe of his magnificent form. <br />
<br />
“How does someone become an anthro, or how is it determined?”<br />
<br />
This one wasn’t a yes or no question, so it didn’t change anything. The man answered candidly that it was still unknown why some people were born as anthros, even when there were no anthro genes in their family tree. It seemed to happen at random and was still relatively rare, even in this new reality. Colin wondered if anyone he knew had become an anthro, and then realized his target may already have been changed. He didn’t want that, he wanted to work with a blank canvas, as it were. <br />
<br />
“Is it true that no one in this apartment building is an anthro?”<br />
<br />
“That’s right. As far as I know, the owner is something of a bigot against anthros and doesn’t rent out to them. Most of the tenants have similar views, so if you’re heading in there, be careful.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks, sir, that’s all I needed.”<br />
<br />
The man went on his way as Colin turned to the apartment and rang the buzzer for the person he was here to see: Eric, a big, tough, mean kid who bullied him in school. Even in his new reality, Eric had been aggressive and tried to pick fights with him, although with his newly muscular form, the fights in his altered past had gone a lot better for Colin than they had in his old life. Before, it was because Colin was weak, nerdy, and gay, all things Eric was more than ready to beat him up over. In this reality, it was because he was nerdy, gay, and an anthro. Eric’s father owned the flats, and he had imparted on his son a strong prejudice against people like Colin. Since Eric was still a jerk in this reality, he didn’t feel bad about how he was going to turn the bully’s life on its head. <br />
<br />
“Who is it? What the hell do you want? It’s 8am on a Saturday!”<br />
<br />
Colin mentally chuckled at Eric trying to sound threatening to a very buff dragon, but calmly pressed the speaker button and began implementing his plan. “Hey, Eric, it’s me, Colin. You’re going to let me in, right?”<br />
<br />
The affirmative drone was followed by the sound of the front door unlocking and Colin made his way up to his bully’s apartment. When he got there, he knocked on the wood, but was quickly cut off by the door opening and Eric standing there with a pissed look on his face. Eric was a senior in the same year as Jane. Even though he had a crush on Colin’s sister, he didn’t think much of this freshman anthro showing up at his house uninvited. <br />
<br />
The thing was, Colin had a crush on Eric despite all the nasty things the guy had done to him. Well, not so much a crush as just an appreciation for a good body when he saw one; he still hated the guy’s guts. Eric was a star linebacker on the football team, and his body reflected all of the hard work he had put in, rivaling Colin’s own muscular frame. He was handsome in a gruff, bad-boy kind of way, and even the slight gut beginning to form over his six-pack as he began drinking underage like his father only helped enhance his blue-collar appeal. As it was, Colin was getting a good look at Eric’s body, as the jock was wearing only his boxer shorts, having clearly just woken up not long before. The sizable bulge in Eric’s underwear sent a twinge of jealousy through the dragon-boy, and not an insignificant amount of lust. <br />
<br />
“The fuck do you want, freak?” Eric asked. “My dad’s still sleeping; if you wake him up I can’t guarantee he won’t shoot your scaly ass.”<br />
<br />
“I came to see you, Eric, don’t you remember inviting me over?”<br />
<br />
A look of confusion washed over Eric’s face as he replied that he did now remember. The jock stepped aside and gestured to the couch, still unsure why he had invited some kid he despised over to his house. Colin made himself at home, spreading out on the dingy old couch in a power move that let Eric know he was in control here. Eric, still racking his brain for why he let Colin into his house, took up a seat across from the younger boy, so preoccupied that he wasn’t aware how Colin was subtly influencing him even without his power. <br />
<br />
“Didn’t you want to tell me how you were sorry for treating me like shit?” Colin started, enjoying the look of regret that suddenly came over Eric’s face. <br />
<br />
“Oh, uh, yeah. Look, Colin, I know I’ve been a real scumbag to you, but I wanted to apologize. Do you think you can forgive me?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I think I can. After all, you were just about to admit you had feelings for me, weren’t you?”<br />
<br />
“Yes,” Eric replied, and his cheeks flushed red as he found himself suddenly attracted to the hot dragon boy in front of him, even though he now felt like he’d been hiding these feelings for years. “I didn’t know how to tell you, Colin. I thought it was wrong for a guy to like another guy, and an anthro at that. If my dad finds out...but I couldn’t keep it a secret any longer...I love you.”<br />
<br />
“Will your dad hate that we’re together?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, he’ll be livid.” Reality didn’t even have to change for that. <br />
<br />
“But he’ll be too intimidated by me to do anything?”<br />
<br />
“Yes,” Eric replied, gaining a bit of confidence back since he knew his dad was scared of messing with an eight-foot-tall dragon, even if he was a young kid who had turned his son gay (a prejudiced presumption that in this case was actually true).<br />
<br />
“In fact, you called me over so that you could come out to your dad, didn’t you?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah! Fuck it, I’m gonna go wake his lazy ass up!”<br />
<br />
Colin smirked as Eric took on a new demeanor of defiance against his dad. Where before he cowed to whatever his father wanted due to his fear of the abusive man, now he wanted to rebel against everything his dad stood for. Colin heard the two snapping at each other as Eric woke his dad up and told him to come out to the living room. When Eric returned, he made a point to sit next to Colin, who made a point to put his arm around his new boyfriend. He could still sense the nervousness Eric was feeling, but he seemed to be empowered by Colin being with him. After a few minutes, Eric’s father, Clint, came staggering into the room, half asleep and hung over. When he saw an anthro in his house, however, he made himself aware enough to become indignant.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck is this animal doing in my house?” he growled, though a hint of fear was hiding behind his eyes. <br />
<br />
“Dad, I have something to say. This is Colin, and I’m in love with him.”<br />
<br />
“You’re fucking what?” Clint sputtered, flabbergasted at his son not only coming out as gay, but with an anthro at that. “Boy, you had better be joking, or I’m going to beat the queer out of you!”<br />
<br />
“Aren’t you too much of a pussy to actually do anything?” Colin stepped in. Immediately, Clint replied yes and the look of fear grew from cautious to outright terrified. He put on a show now, but he wouldn’t do anything to back it up. Clint, now avoiding Colin’s draconic glare, turned to his son. <br />
<br />
“Dammit, Eric, didn’t I raise you better than this?”<br />
<br />
“You raised me wrong,” Eric replied. “There’s nothing wrong with being gay, and there’s nothing wrong with anthros.”<br />
<br />
“You never could stand the fact that your son was an anthro kobold, isn’t that right?” Colin added, now freewheeling.<br />
<br />
As Clint replied in an affirmative, Colin turned to watch Eric begin transforming in front of him. The big, muscular jock began to shrink as he started sprouting dull brown scales. When he finished shrinking, he was only four feet tall, but his body was still as beefy as ever, just scaled down. One thing Colin was giddy to see was that, like him, Eric’s genitals didn’t change size with his new form, and his hefty bulge now looked obscenely huge on his tiny Kobold body before it retracted into his new cloaca. His face pushed out into a smaller draconic snout than Colin’s, his ears were bigger relative to his head and floppy rather than bony, and a short but thick tail snaked its way out of the back of his boxers to wrap itself around Colin’s affectionately. Within moments, Colin had his arm around not a tall and imposing young man, but a short and stocky kobold bordering on cute despite his powerful build. <br />
<br />
“I knew your mother’s genes were fucked up when she told me her cousin was a fucking furry,” Clint spat, using the term that in this world was a slur against anthros. “Then she goes and dies giving birth to some freak. I tried to look past it for her sake, raise you like a man, but this takes the cake! I want you two out of my house! If you love him so much, then you can go live with him; and good riddance! Then I don’t have to look at your ugly scaly face anymore!”<br />
<br />
“Dad!”<br />
<br />
“You’re no son of mine! Get the fuck out of here!”<br />
<br />
Colin actually felt bad for Eric now. He didn’t have anything ready yet for this situation, and he was under too much pressure to figure out a clever question. Instead, he realized, this might actually be the best scenario. Eric’s species and sexuality may have changed, but that was it. Looking around the squalor that was the apartment Eric shared with his dad and hearing the aggressive, slurring words the drunkard was shouting out, Colin realized that Eric might not have been wholly to blame for his prior bullying ways. Maybe getting him out of this place would make Eric a genuinely better person, rather than being doomed to a miserable life parroting his father. <br />
<br />
Colin stood up, fast, closing the distance between himself and Clint in a blink. The balding drunkard stumbled back in terror as the intimidating face of a dragon forced itself into his own, snarling, with smoke seeping out from his nostrils. Colin was pissed. All of the anger he’d had towards Eric was now turned towards his bully’s father. He picked the man up by his t-shirt without any effort, pushing him up against the wall; not violently enough to hurt him, but in a way that showed he could if he wanted to. <br />
<br />
“You’re a sorry excuse for a man, and a sorrier excuse for a father. Eric looked up to you, and all you did was hate him for what he couldn’t help. You hate all of my kind for things we can’t help!” he roared.<br />
<br />
His rage appeared to the other two to be about hating anthros, but Colin was really still venting his anger from his old reality. He had been beaten up, trodden down, and mocked for his sexuality, his nerdy interests, and his weak body. All that hate had weighed on him, forcing him to pretend to be someone he wasn’t just to avoid being harassed. Now that he had the power to stand up to people like Clint and Eric, he wasn’t about to take these insults lying down. He spun around and pushed Clint onto the dingy couch that Eric had just stood up from. <br />
<br />
“When you sober up enough to realize what a miserable jackass you are, maybe you’ll figure out how lucky you were to have a son like Eric. And maybe, if you grovel enough, he might have the heart to forgive you. But know this, shitface, I never will. Now get fucked.”<br />
<br />
With that Colin wrapped his arm around his new boyfriend’s shoulder and escorted him out of the oppressive atmosphere of the run down apartments.</p>
