<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">    With a yawn Kairos&#39; maw stretches open, canine tongue rising into the air. Flexing and wiggling the claws on his hands and feet, the golden lupine&#39;s fiery red eyes flutter open, vision blurry from the tears the yawn had granted him. As his body relaxes, the canine&#39;s eyes squint in a curious mix of confusion at the sight that greeted him.<br />
<br />
    Where there would have been a dimly lit ceiling of wood, lay an endless void of darkness.<br />
<br />
    Rolling onto his hip, the wolfman uses his elbow to support himself. Rising up to a sitting position, bestial eyes glance to the gentle waves that lapped at his fur, before shifting back up to the endless void of a sky that had entranced his vision.<br />
<br />
    <i>&quot;Waves…?&quot;</i><br />
<br />
    Immediately Kairos&#39; eyes widen, gaze shooting back down to what lay beneath his form to witness a jaw-dropping sight.<br />
<br />
    An ethereal water-like liquid lay beneath his prone form, colored a brilliant white. The water seemed to be glowing, the gentle radiance illuminating the black expanse of sky above. The bed that had dragged him into such deep sleep was gone. In fact, <i>everything</i> was gone; replaced with this boundless sky and sea of black and white.<br />
<br />
    Much like the black void above, the cream-colored radiant waves stretched out as far as the golden lupine&#39;s ruby eyes could see. <br />
<br />
    Despite having awakened in such an unusual and bizarre location, Kairos found himself at ease. Every inch of his body felt calm and relaxed, each breath he inhaled filling his lungs with a gentle air unlike any other. <br />
<br />
    <i>Serenity.</i><br />
<br />
    That was what this feeling was called.<br />
<br />
    It was something he could rarely ever feel. He&#39;d only known the endless rush of excitement each and every battle granted him. The unending sorrow that came with the death of an ally, even as he resolved to stifle any regret. A sense of courage and boundless willpower.<br />
<br />
    <i>&quot;But why now? Why here?&quot;</i><br />
<br />
    Rising to his feet, Kairos allowed the gentle calmness to embrace his form. Even as every part of him relaxed, his thoughts continued to swirl at the world that lay before him; a question he should&#39;ve asked long ago rushing to the forefront of his mind as his eyes drifted back up to the expanse of darkness, the faint ethereal white glow of the water faintly lighting up the black void.<br />
<br />
    <i>&quot;Where is here?&quot;</i><br />
<br />
    &quot;The Void of Reminiscence.&quot;<br />
<br />
    A gruff voice piercing through the gentle ambiance of the ethereal realm, Kairos practically jumped out of his skin, a growlish gutteral gasp slipping from his parted jaws. Immediately spinning to the source of the voice in a battle-ready stance, the golden wolf&#39;s ears droop as his jaw drops, guard breaking.<br />
<br />
    The muscular furred form of a familiar grey werewolf stood before him, a metal pauldron strapped across its right shoulder and a pair of baggy trousers coating its legs. Kairos&#39; red eyes could only widen as they lock with the rich gold of the opposing lupine. The grey canine&#39;s chiseled physique almost mirrored his own.<br />
<br />
    Out of disbelief, the golden lupine lifts a shaky claw, the serenity that had previously flooded him melding with an immense feeling of disbelief.<br />
<br />
    &quot;I-It can&#39;t be…&quot;<br />
<br />
    A toothy grin grows across the grey wolf&#39;s muzzle, canines reflecting the light of the waves beneath their feet. The confidence Kairos felt from the canine completely betrayed his own feelings.<br />
<br />
    &quot;I saw you <i>die</i>.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Tears threatened to fall from his bestial eyes, the golden furred werewolf holding them back through sheer force of will. Yet as the grey colored reflection in front of him opened its maw to finally speak, they fell uncontrollably.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Well, I suppose I <i>did</i> go out with quite a <em>bang</em>, eh?&quot; Chortling at his misfortune, Orveus&#39; grin remains even as his living companion openly weeps. &quot;On the bright side, it looks like I rubbed off on you quite a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;What is this?! <i>Where</i> is this?!&quot; Large clawed hands clasping around his face, shouts of disbelief resound from Kairos&#39; maw, red eyes dilating as a horrid thought graces his mind. &quot;I&#39;m dead, aren&#39;t I? This is all just some stupid fever dream someone sees as they pass on.&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;Yup. This is a dream all right.&quot; Crossing his large arms across his barreled chest of fluff, Orveus&#39; gaze falls to the glowing white waters beneath them. &quot;Always found it funny how you love to assume the worst in situations. Talk about being level-headed, eh, Kairos?&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;B-But how is this even possible? I&#39;ve heard of magic that can screw with the mind, are you an effect of this?! My regrets coming back to mess with my mind?!&quot; Claws digging into his face, Kairos steps back. Had he been human, beads of sweat would have been dripping down his face alongside his tears.<br />
<br />
    &quot;We are not mere figments of your imagination, Kairos.&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;&#39;<em>We</em>?&#39;&quot;<br />
<br />
    Eyes darting to a shadow from behind Orveus&#39; large furred form, another gasp escapes Kairos&#39; muzzle. Stepping out from the grey canine&#39;s shadow, the familiar shape of a small cloaked lizardman graced his sight; slitted eyes a pale lavender, scales as white as chalk. The black robe draped across his body hid his malnourished form; yet with his improved sense of sight, Kairos could see that the mage&#39;s build had improved. <br />
<br />
    It was if he had been eating well.<br />
<br />
    Curious, Kairos&#39; gaze shifts back to Orveus, examining the canine diligently. Just like the lizardman next to him, the grey werewolf had also changed; form seemingly larger, as if he had been working out vigorously. His fur usually hid the contours of his muscles, yet now it seemed as if his pelt was struggling to contain the slabs of strength adorning his body.<br />
<br />
    Speechless, Kairos&#39; gaze clouds, mind threatening to shatter from the mere presence of both entities in front of him.<br />
<br />
    The negative thoughts squirming at the center of his mind begin to slowly ebb away, having no reason to exist as both beings before him serenely gazed at him, the maw of the grey wolf parting. &quot;Technically, we <em>are</em> dead, although only physically. If it hasn&#39;t crossed your mind even with the words of that other lizard; we live on through you, souls tied to you for the rest of our existence.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Pausing, Orveus&#39; golden eyes glance downwards to Kenos&#39; small form, the lizardman continuing the explanation without haste. &quot;In most circumstances, a soul is only prevented from passing on due to holding regret; yet this has been defied by our souls attaching to yours.&quot; Eyes shimmering, the white scaled reptile shuffles his feet. &quot;Although, I suppose I&#39;m an exception to this exception; I still hold regrets.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Body trembling no matter how much he tried to calm himself, Kairos&#39; head shakes in wariness. &quot;I don&#39;t understand! I thought you both were sealed into those masks!&quot; <br />
<br />
    A hearty laugh from Orveus only instills more unease within the red eyed lupine. The grey wolf&#39;s chest heaving, another smile grows across his maw. &quot;Those masks are just… catalysts. Think of them as triggers, acting as ways to allow our souls to physically manifest by changing your shape.&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;We are tied together until the end of time.&quot; Kenos&#39; voice reaffirms, the lavender eyed lizardman fidgeting with his robe. &quot;By being bound to you, your soul has eroded onto our own. As you&#39;ve noticed, both I and the lycanthrope have grown healthier… somewhat.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Pausing to digest the words of both beings, a sigh slips from the beast&#39;s maw, the lupine&#39;s head lifting, reluctantly forcing himself to make eye contact with both pairs of eyes. &quot;Then what is this place? Purgatory?&quot;<br />
<br />
    With an annoyed sigh, Kenos&#39; lavender orbs roll, the mage&#39;s claws tapping against the floor. &quot;You seem to derive some twisted pleasure by putting yourself down. We&#39;re not here to guilt-trip you, Kairos.&quot; Scaled arms extending, the lizardman gestures to the expanse surrounding them. &quot;This place lies deep within your mind and soul, completely separate from the waking world. At this current moment, your physical form rests, embraced by the comfort of a bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Seeing the confusion plastered across his companion&#39;s face, Orveus chuckles deviously. &quot;Yep, and it seems that coming <em>here</em> has also resulted in a coming from <em>there</em>.&quot; The muscular lupine&#39;s laughter grows as the thin lizard at his side groans in annoyance. As his laughter fades, the deviousness across the canine&#39;s face shifts to the same look of serenity from earlier. &quot;When you wake up, make sure to lap it up like a good boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Head tilting in befuddlement, Kairos&#39; ears involuntary twitch. &quot;&#39;<em>Lap it up</em>?&#39; Does that also refer to something about this world?&quot;<br />
<br />
    Stifling another chortle, Orveus slowly walks over to his lupine companion, slamming a clawed hand on the golden wolfman&#39;s shoulder, a grin growing across his face at Kairos&#39; surprised expression. &quot;You&#39;ll get what I mean when you wake up. I <em>did</em> mention that the werewolf life was good, didn&#39;t I?&quot;<br />
<br />
    Attempting to answer, Kairos words freeze within his throat, Orveus shooting him a final confident grin along with a wink as the forms of both him and Kenos began to fade away.<br />
<br />
    Driven by a tension in his soul, Kairos&#39; gaze shifts up to the blackened sky, radiant white waters beneath him intensifying their glow, before their rays explode outwards, lighting up the endless expanse of darkness.<br />
<br />
    Soul showered by the light, all goes white.</p>
