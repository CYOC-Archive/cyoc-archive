<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I’d rather be an adult cow than a calf,” Jeff explained. “Maybe one or two years old? I just don’t like the idea of being a baby again, even as another species.”<br />
<br />
“If that’s what you want, I’ll support you one hundred percent,” Sally said, giving Jeff the biggest hug she could muster. “I’m sorry if I’m getting in the way or being pushy.”<br />
<br />
“You’re not,” Jeff insisted.<br />
<br />
Sally still seemed sad. “If only there was something we could do about your potential pregnancy.”<br />
<br />
“The only possibility I could see is turning someone into my future calf, but who would agree to something like that?” Jeff absentmindedly said.<br />
<br />
Sally’s eyes widened, then turned back to the screen. <br />
<br />
“Are you okay?” Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Sally answered. “Just thinking. I’ll put in the inputs you asked for.”<br />
<br />
Jeff was oblivious to Sally messing with her own settings on top of Jeff’s.<br />
<br />
“Okay. Looks like we’re just about ready to begin. Shall we?”<br />
<br />
Jeff was a little intimidated because he wasn&#39;t sure someone who should be licking her own butt would be the ideal choice to take control of his anatomy and psychology. So far, Sally seemed just like an ordinary woman with above-average intelligence and a first-hand understanding of life as an animal. Even so, how would a dog use seemingly omnipotent technology, especially a dog whose mind and body have been warped by that same technology? If Sally somehow got them both in trouble, how could he have explained that he turned his exclusive beta testing opportunity over to his dog? He was happy she seemed to be listening to his requests, such as replacing him at home to ensure they didn’t lose the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, Sally, how long is this gonna take?&quot; Jeff asked, awkwardly baring it all in front of a human woman whom nature had never intended to even be a human woman, wanting to distract himself before he could talk himself out of this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why, I thought you would never ask.” Sally smiled deviously. “Just for the record, I’ve also made sure you’ll pick up the instincts of a cow over time so you can get the true cow experience. I hope the next year is a blast, Jeff. I promise to come and visit if you catch my drift. Make sure to get pregnant if you aren’t already, alright? I’d rather not stay an egg for too long.”<br />
<br />
Before Jeff could process the implications of Sally’s words, she pressed a key on the keyboard.<br />
<br />
Jeff blinked, and his recently expanded room was replaced by a barn. He was in a bovine pen; that much was obvious, each stall occupied with a cow.<br />
<br />
Looking at himself, Jeff blushed before shaking his head. Now was no time to be modest about his nudity. After all, he would become a cow and be one for at least a year if Sally’s words were an indication, and cows never wore clothes.<br />
<br />
Jeff couldn’t believe Sally would go to such extremes to meet her newfound ideology, and he was annoyed that Sally had betrayed his trust. Still, he figured that Sally had the worse end of the bargain, considering she wasn’t alive. Jeff was still worried about the potential implication he would be stuck like this for the rest of his days. Instead, he decided to turn his energies to the here and now, that being his transformation.<br />
<br />
Considering Sally was supposed to become an egg, Jeff figured the first thing that would go was his gender.<br />
<br />
Spying a bucket in the corner, Jeff walked over to it before sitting down and taking one last piss with his penis.<br />
<br />
What Jeff didn&#39;t expect was for that piss to shrivel his dick. Surprised, Jeff cradled it again as it slowly started shrinking, along with his balls. He felt shifting in his abdomen as things rearranged to a female configuration.<br />
<br />
Jeff watched in fascination for thirty minutes as his dick completely disappeared, his penis slowly receding into him, and his testicles moved from the scrotum inside the body. Jeff reached back, feeling slight discomfort under his ass, before gasping wide-eyed as he touched the new hole under her ass. Her vagina was exactly in the spot a cow&#39;s privates would be. Shivering from the pleasure, Jeff sat back down in her stall, avoiding having her vagina contact anything. <br />
<br />
Looking down at her stomach, Jeff was surprised to see pink skin barely standing out between the rest of her tan skin, with four small bumps on the patch of pink. Just looking at it made her feel giddy. Pressing a hand to her stomach, she felt the rubbery texture of it compared to the rest of her skin. Her udder was growing.<br />
<br />
Jeff didn&#39;t notice her ass relaxed in excitement for a moment. Jeff felt warm cow dung slide out her anus without any control of her own. Blushing profusely, Jeff stood there as she began to piss. At that moment, Jeff realized that cows have little to no control over their urination and defecation. She sighed but quickly accepted that her new cow instincts had taken over her waste disposal functions.<br />
Watching for a good few minutes, the teats on Jeff’s udder extended to four inches each as her udder grew round and taut, just like a cow&#39;s udder. Jeff smiled at the thought of getting milked with a moan of pleasure, pulling on one of her teats. She never noticed how the nipples on her chest had disappeared.<br />
<br />
Holding a hand to her gut, Jeff felt small shifts under her skin. Shivering as her internal organs shifted, Jeff remembered that cows had four stomachs.<br />
<br />
Next, a small lump began to push out from her tailbone and grew longer, gaining a tuft of hair at the end. It was a full-blown cow&#39;s tail, which started to naturally swing to get rid of any bugs that tried to get near Jeff’s ass. The cowgirl tried controlling her new appendage but found it challenging.<br />
<br />
While she was distracted, Jeff began growing white and black fur across the rest of her body, her skin toughening into a strong hide.<br />
Jeff’s ears felt itchy as they started to extend. Jeff winced as they fully formed into cow ears, her hearing range becoming much more extensive. The difference is truly night and day, giving Jeff a headache.<br />
<br />
But that wasn&#39;t all. Jeff’s toes started to curl up, the tips turning black. Slowly, her toes melted together, forming the two halves of a hoof, and her feet shrunk until her legs had only hooves at the end. Her legs, while still built for upright walking, her hooves were not. Her body was all wrong, and it would have been a struggle to get anywhere. Not that she had really anywhere to go.<br />
<br />
The thing Jeff was dreading the most was losing her hands. She might have agreed to this, but it hadn’t dawned on Jeff that she’d lose two of the things she valued most: her hands and voice.<br />
<br />
Yet just like her feet, her hands quickly turned into hooves. A few more cracks in her spine and tendons made Jeff tumble down and have to catch her weight with her hooves. She could feel her bones crack into place, officially becoming quadruped.<br />
Experimentally, Jeff took a step forward and all fours. She moved naturally now, more or less. It felt wrong and right at the same time. <br />
Jeff walked toward a large water trough nearby and looked into her reflection. She could see her mostly human face still there, but her ears were now the size and shape of the cows surrounding her. Jeff took a drink and then looked over her body. She was about the size of a young cow, though she wasn&#39;t sure if the rest of her bulk would come from her transformation or the food.<br />
<br />
She could feel her bones crack into place as her facial structure changed itself. Jeff’s mouth and nose elongate into a snout. Her nostrils grew as they turned pink in Jeff’s reflection. Jeff nearly screamed as her top front teeth fell out of her mouth, only to feel everything rearranging and for even more teeth to grow elsewhere. A similar effect happened with her tongue, which she could feel became more coarse as it got big enough to stick in her nostril. <br />
<br />
Blinking, Jeff noticed two more changes. <br />
<br />
Firstly, cows were colorblind, unable to see red and to tell every color apart. Secondly, her vision, which was previously limited to just the front of her head, is nearly a complete 360 degrees, or 330 to be exact. Her sense of smell increases in much the same way. <br />
Jeff looked at the reflection and saw a cow’s face and body staring back. It was truly surreal. She tried to speak and instead let out a loud moo. For some reason, Jeff didn’t mind as much as she assumed she would at losing her voice.<br />
<br />
After the physical changes were complete, Jeff felt a sudden headache. As Sally had developed human mannerisms, bovine instincts were taking further root in Jeff&#39;s brain. While her human memories were still there, the bovine instincts were at the forefront of her mind.<br />
Her neck felt stiff as a collar magically appeared around her neck, equipped with a small decorative cowbell.<br />
<br />
Finally, Jeff could feel her ears be pierced, as a yellow tag, her identification number, along with other information, was clearly visible… that is, if she could have read it. The one thing Jeff did know, though, was her new name.<br />
<br />
…<br />
<br />
Joy.<br />
<br />
The 16-month-old cow mentally smiled before the exhaustion of the transformation caught up with her body, and she fell to sleep near instantly.</p>
