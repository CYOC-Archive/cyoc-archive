<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Thanks to Dennis Dane for helping flesh this idea out. <br/>
<br/>
This is an alt TF for Cassie <a href="/interactives/chapter_141140.html">#141140</a></div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After so many hours on a plane, it felt good to Cassie to be able get out and stretch again. This surprise trip to visit her long-distance girlfriend had taken a good chunk out of her savings, but it was worth it to see the expression of Rayne&#39;s face when she told her the good news!<br />
<br />
She&#39;d finally gotten her transfer to her girlfriend&#39;s university! It had seemed like an eternity, but now it was only about a little while longer until she started her classes. Of course, because she&#39;d been afraid of rejection, Cassie hadn&#39;t told Rayne about it at all, not wanting to risk disappointing her if it fell flat.<br />
<br />
But now, that was all in the past, and their future together was looking bright. Hence why she&#39;d booked a flight to come out early to spring the good news in person and be rewarded with some love in person. They hadn&#39;t been physically together since the Seven Days at Charlie&#39;s premiere last year. Sure, they were always texting and chatting online, but noting beat face to face in the physical world. <br />
<br />
Dressed in a dark green hoodie styled after a stalker in Tunnel Maker, the 7DC t-shirt they&#39;d given out at that not-so long ago premiere, with plain blue jeans and beat-up sneakers, Cassie&#39;s attire screamed nerd, but she didn&#39;t really care what people thought of her look, Well, maybe she was still a little sensitive about her weight but that was probably expected after she&#39;d shed so much weight over the last few years. Plenty of exercise for her legs, her tummy and lots of healthy juice had proven to be the key to success.<br />
<br />
Standing at the baggage claim carousel, Cassie was surprised when her smartphone buzzed with a message alert from Rayne! Swiping open the phone, she looked at the Tube link her girlfriend had sent, and clicked immediately, pretty sure it was something cute and funny...<br />
<br />
====<br />
<br />
The thumping bass was her first clue that it might not be cute or funny. The second was when the woman dressed in what looked like a bikini and cut-off jean shorts started to rap...<br />
<br />
&#39;Straight out from down unda&#39;, Hela G is here to loot and plunda&#39; From coast to coast, there ain&#39;t nobody my flow can&#39;t roast!<br />
<br />
&#39;Cause I&#39;m da Big Gurl on Campus, ain&#39;t no way they gonna mess with us...&quot;<br />
<br />
Shots of some sort of pool party were intercut between the artist speaking rhythmically while shaking her thick and round ass. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m BAE all the way. nevah evah da GAY! Straight &#39;atcha give this Aussie BAMF a holla!<br />
<br />
&#39;Cause I&#39;m da Big Gurl on Campus! Ain&#39;t no sway they is gonna fuck with us!&quot;<br />
<br />
====<br />
<br />
Cassie frantically clicked close the video before that rapper could twerk into the camera again, a bit horrified that someone might have heard that trash coming out of her phone. But a quick glance showed nobody was staring at her. Sighing in relief, she typed a slightly angry reply to Rayne, wanting to know why she&#39;d sent that link.<br />
<br />
But every time she tapped send, she got a message saying that the receiving account didn&#39;t exist. She might&#39;ve continued to do so had her suitcase not slid down the carousel and into the railing next to her. Grabbing the bag, Cassie stalked off back into the terminal to find some place to figure out what was going on here.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for the gaymer girl, the video she&#39;d just watched had passed along the infamous &#39;were-breeder&#39; curse to her, and a momentary flush of attraction to its star Hela G&#39;s considerable assets had sealed her fate...<br />
<br />
====<br />
<br />
Airports are a strange place. You can often walk down long corridors that look like every other corridor at every other airport. Only by reading the signs could an unseasoned traveler tell exactly where they were.<br />
<br />
So it wasn&#39;t too much of a surprise that a distracted Cassie failed to notice she&#39;d somehow had been shifted from an airport in California to one in England. She also didn&#39;t see her current path was leading her towards one of the restaurants in this terminal, a surprisingly high-end establishment called simply &quot;Jordan&#39;s&quot;.<br />
<br />
This was another of the many restaurants owned by that celebrity chef Jordan Randalls. It catered to the VIP crowd that passed through this airport, serving a mix of international cuisine prepared to the notoriously high standards of its loud owner. It also had a very exclusive reservation list for clients who could enter at will.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, a pleasure to see you again, ma&#39;am.&quot;<br />
<br />
The sudden words in a reserved English accent got Cassie&#39;s attention from her phone. She looked up to see she was standing in front of a restaurant and its maitre&#39;d, a tall fellow with thinning grey hair in a black suit.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? I dunno what you&#39;re...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tish-tosh, ma&#39;am. I believe you are expected at your usual table...&quot;<br />
<br />
The man almost bowed as his outstretched arms beckoned the gaymer girl to go past the thick wooden doors. Cassie tried to resist, but her feet had an agenda of her own and carried her past the threshold. The power of the curse was beginning to make itself known.<br />
<br />
The maitre&#39;d didn&#39;t pay anymore mind once Cassie had gone inside. Instead, he merely put a checkmark next to a name in his reservation book.<br />
<br />
&#39;Mrs. C. Goodenough&#39;<br />
<br />
====<br />
<br />
The usual table was a plush and well trimmed booth in the back of the restaurant, away from the common area of the establishment but near enough the kitchen to ensure prompt serving of ordered meals. Cassie found herself sitting at the table and then sliding around to the center of the booth.<br />
<br />
&quot;W..w..what&#39;s going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
As if in a mocking answer to her question, a server arrived and put down a plate of exquistely prepared plate of sushi and a tall stem glass filled with champagne. He then walked off, leaving her alone with the food and drink.<br />
<br />
&#39;But I didn&#39;t order any...&quot;<br />
<br />
But the rumbling of her stomach cut off the rest of Cassie&#39;s words. She suddenly wanted to eat, and picked up a pair of black lacquered chopsticks from next to the plate. She failed to notice that she was using her right hand, as she was naturally a leftie. Nor did she see that the hand itself seemed different, as its fingers thinned and popped longer. The nails also grew out an inch or so, gaining a glossy coating of red nail polish. <br />
<br />
With a seemingly practiced motion of the chopsticks, one of the sushi rolls was popped into her mouth and she began to chew it. As she did, her lips began to plump up thicker, as red lipstick flowed out from where the sushi had touched them.  Swallowing the delicious food, she unthinkingly reached for the stem glass with her left hand, which swiftly changed to mirror her right. As the champagne was drunk, her neck began to thin out, and flush of golden hue washed over her skin.<br />
<br />
As she continued to consume her sushi and drink her champagne, Cassie started to feel slightly tipsy. Her confused thoughts were beginning to mix with new ones. These ideas and memories seemed to come from another life, one of luxury and wealth. Her previous concerns about her girlfriend seemed to falter and fade, as her attraction to women was drained away. In its place was forming a strong desire for men, but only if they met her exacting standards...<br />
<br />
&quot;M..m...more!&quot;<br />
<br />
The word spoken saw another order of food and drink brought to her table. This time it was a thick steak, cooked to medium rareness and a glass of red wine. Again, the server placed it before her, and remove the now empty plate and stem glass. Cassie licked her lips, as the smell of the meat wafted up her nose.  But a new properness took hold of her, forcing her to sit up straight. There were audible pops from her spine as she adjusted her posture, and sat up taller. <br />
<br />
The knife cut into the steak and a steaming piece was on its way to her mouth, as her clothing began shifting itself. Her hoodie darkened from green to black, and the hood fell off to one side. The zipper on the front pulled itself free, as buttons appeared at her now tightening belly. An unseen force pulled the developing blazer closed just as its shoulders widened with padding.<br />
<br />
Another bite of steak was washed down with a sip of the wine, which seemed to trigger another change in her. Her modest bust began to expand, growing and pushing her 7DC tee tighter with each moment. Finally, the strained material gave way and revealed a silky bra beneath that supported her full c-cups. The tattered remains of cloth whipped themselves into a new form, becoming a blouse whose wide collar folded out and over the top of the black blazer. A long and thin band of silk slid out from under the collar to tie itself to a bow.<br />
<br />
&quot;B..b..bloody delicious...&quot;<br />
<br />
The words came out in a much more mature tone than Cassie had before, with the beginning traces of a posh Britsh accent in them. But that&#39;s didn&#39;t seem strange to her, as memories of finishing school and proper manners flooded her memories now, washing away all of her previous knowledge of games or gaming.  But there was something else too, as the images of two women, older and respected, formed in her mind. These were her sisters...?<br />
<br />
As the revelation of family ties hit, so did a change to the lower part of Cassie&#39;s attire. Her jeans had already merged into a dark grey business skirt that hung just below her knees as her sneakers were twisting into a conservative pair of black pumps. The changes in clothing forced her body to adapt. Legs grew more toned and slightly longer while feet crunched smaller. Thighs thickened greatly and hips widened with cracks and pops as her ass began to plump up into a perfect heart-shape. <br />
<br />
Putting down her knife and fork on an empty plate, Cassie&#39;s right arm rose up to request the removal and a refreshing of her wine. As the server complied, she found herself checking the fit young man out, which shocked her greatly.<br />
<br />
But before she could protest, a coolness settled over her muddled mind. It soothed away her worry, and seemed to whisper into her ear in a sophisticated tone that everything was going according to plan..<br />
<br />
=====<br />
<br />
Elsewhere, new buildings were forming in nearby London. One of these used to be a bank, which had been closed since a financial crisis years ago, But now, a new logo was forming on its front, one of a elegant lotus flower as the name &#39;Miyamoto Bank&#39; formed in English and kanji underneath. Inside, staff began to appear and started to work. Unsurprisingly, a goodly number of them were Japanese.<br />
<br />
At the same time, an unsold townhouse in a once posh neighborhood was purchased and began to renovate itself according to its new owners&#39; needs and desire. Old Edwardian furnishings dominated, but there were always hints and highlights of a Japanesse style as well. And much like the resurrected bank, servants and maind appeared in the house to tend their chores. And upstairs, bedrooms formed, one for adults and one for children...<br />
<br />
=====<br />
<br />
Back at the restaurant, Cassie was beginning to lose control to the new self rising in her mind. This was no doubt aided by the third glass of red wine she&#39;d drunk. She tried to resist the tide of memories of a life growing up as a daughter of wealthy Japanese emigrants to England, but it was a losing battle.<br />
<br />
Her face&#39;s changes reflected her shifting family background. Her eyes darken to an deep brown as they gained epicanthic folds. Cheeks rose up and were dusted lightly with foundation to hide the beginning of wrinkles. Eyebrows were shaped to an arched perfection as pearl earrings pierced her ears..<br />
<br />
Her hair was among the last to shift away from its old form. Brown gave way to an ebon wave that obliterated any sign of curls. This new silken sheet then styled itself into a cut that hung past her shoulders and left her face framed by long bangs.<br />
<br />
In parallel to these changes was the formation of accessories and other important bits she was going to need. The fallen hood reshaped itself into a purse and a state of the art Cisdroid phone appeared inside. A pearl bracelet wrapped around her right wrist, a tradition of her family to emphasize their conservative values.<br />
<br />
 A few rings appeared on her fingers, but the most important one was the platinum wedding band that curled around her ring finger. It was engraved with the name &#39;Goodenough&#39;, a twin of it formed around a certain wolfish banker&#39;s finger. It was a symbol of their bond.<br />
<br />
=====<br />
<br />
Outside of the airport, a taxi pulled up to a waiting area. But it was already changing form to become a much more elegant ride for its new owners, as its driver was transformed into their chaffeur. <br />
<br />
He waited paitently for his employers to appear...<br />
<br />
=====<br />
<br />
Now, the former Cassie stood up from the booth, satisfied by the food provided by the excellent staff of Jordan&#39;s. She made a mental note to send off a bit of praise to their employer. <br />
<br />
&quot;Waiter, please charge this to my account.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, Mrs Goodenough&quot;<br />
<br />
She smiled at the server&#39;s obvious deferential tone.  Cassilda Goodenough nee Miyamoto had long had a reputation as being an &#39;Iron Maiden&#39;, regardless if it was in the boardroom of the family bank or a restaurant. She demanded perfection from all around her. Especially her husband, Gregory.<br />
<br />
&quot;Goodenough by name, but perfected by me.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was how she described their relationship to her older sisters Priscilla Chang and Delphine Riches during her last visit to the States. The famed Miyamoto Twins had been her role models growing up, and she had followed their proud matriarch methods to a tee. <br />
<br />
Walking proudly past the maitre&#39;d, who asked if she&#39;d had some dessert with her meal. Cassilda merely flashed a predatory smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I have some excellent Wolf cream waiting for me at home...&quot;</p>
