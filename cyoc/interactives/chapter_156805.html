<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Yea know it actually fweels kinda good having poopy in my pants, so nice and warm&quot; his mom remarked referring of course to the heaviness in the back of her pamper. Gripping the sides of the garment she tugged it up a little causing her mess to squish against her behind, &quot;I tink I&#39;ll stay in dis for a while.&quot;<br />
&quot;Woo wana tay inna tinky diapie? Ar woo sur war otay mommy?&quot; (You wanna stay in a stinky diaper? Are you sure your okay mommy?) Jeff replied with a troubled look, worried that his mom had messed up the mental settings on the Chronivac program and that she was mentally becoming a toddler in mind. Of course it wouldn&#39;t be too much trouble if that was the case since the regression was only gonna last another thirty minutes...unless she messed up the duration too.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine sweetee I&#39;m just enjoying myself while I can dats all&quot; she reassured her son.<br />
&quot;Weally cus jus a foo minuts ago woo tated da toywet bye makin boom boom&quot; (Really? Cause just a few minutes ago you taunted the toilet by making boom boom) Jeff said with a raised eyebrow.<br />
&quot;I thought dat would be cute and funny&quot; she admitted with a shrug, &quot;My mommy sad I was always doin silly tings wike that when I was three. I was also still in diapas at dat age too.&quot;<br />
&quot;Weit woo wa till in diapas wen woo wer tree?&quot; (Wait, you were still in diapers when you were three?) Jeff asked in surprise.<br />
&quot;Uh huh, I wasn&#39;t fully potty twained until I was five wears old. Seems dat I had a ting for dem wen I was younger, go figure&quot; his mom replied while patting the front of her wet and messy pamper.<br />
&quot;Wow, I didant no dat about woo, and as four da hole toywet ting wor wight it was kinduh funnee&quot; Jeff agreed with a giggle.<br />
His mother smiled, &quot;Point is Jeffy I&#39;m weally wiking being a toddwer right now and I just want to act ma age, are woo okay with that?&quot; she asked hoping he wouldn&#39;t judge her too harshly for her babyish tendencies.<br />
&quot;Ya sure watevah maks woo hapee mommy&quot; (Yeah sure whatever makes you happy mommy) he relented and overjoyed at her son&#39;s validation she embraced him in another warm hug which Jeff happily returned. His nose however scrunched up a little as he smelled a faint stinky odor coming from his mother&#39;s rear end. Apparently the odor guard in his mother&#39;s diaper were starting to fail. However when they broke apart he saw her expression didn&#39;t change in the slightest which meant the smell didn&#39;t bother her.<br />
&quot;Wace ya back to your woom&quot; she smirked before dashing back into the hallway with him quickly giving chase.<br />
Once they were back in the nursery they immediately resumed playing with the same toys from before her potty emergency, which of course meant his mother went back to mowing the carpet. And seemingly with a care in the world despite now having a hefty load in her diaper, the smell of which slowly started to fill the room over the next few minutes. As a result Jeff stayed a fair distance from his stinky mother as he played with a pair of toy trucks, making them crash into each other.<br />
When there was less than fifteen minutes left until she grew up again his mother abandoned her fun toy and toddled over to him while also bring her stink with her. &quot;Okay I&#39;m all weady ta have my diapa tanged&quot; she chirped happily.<br />
Jeff blushed at the request never imagining ever having to change his mother&#39;s diaper.<br />
&quot;Um otay butt I dun tink I can since I cant controwl ma hands two well&quot; (Um okay but I don&#39;t think I can since I can&#39;t control my hands too well) he replied inwardly chastising himself for setting his dexterity too low.<br />
&quot;Dats okay I can fix it&quot; she said before walking over to the office and climbing onto the computer chair and sitting on her knees to avoid sitting down directly on her full padding.<br />
<br />
Bringing up Jeff&#39;s profile she quickly made the following changes:<br />
<br />
Dexterity: Low ]------X--[ High<br />
Lisp: Full (every word) ]------X--[ None (current)<br />
Private: Diapers<br />
<br />
She got rid of his full lisp because it was really hard to understand her little Jeffy despite how cute it was. As for why she changed pull-ups to diapers, well no son of hers was going to go without his crinkly padding for even one second. Especially after her recent discovery of fondness for the garments. She left overall control at none as she wanted Jeffy to use his pampers as much as possible during the weekend, that way she could change her baby boy many more times before he had to grow back up on Monday.<br />
Clicking save on the changes she hopped down from the chair and returned to the nursery to find Jeff looking over and moving his fingers with new flexibility. &quot;Hey I tink you did it mommy...whoa hold on my wisp is almost completwee gone&quot; he announced with mild shock.<br />
&quot;Heh yeah I did dat, I made your wisp more wike mine. Hope you arent too mad at me.&quot;<br />
Jeff shook his head as he liked the change she had made.<br />
&quot;Good now wets get me tanged&quot; his mom announced before laying down on the floor. Jeff toddled over to the changing table and fetched the supplies before returning and taking position at her feet. From this spot he could plainly see her diaper and the obvious bulge in the back she had been sporting for the past twenty minutes.<br />
&quot;Just do what I did ta you befwore...and hurry deres only ten minutes befwore I git big again. I dont wanna have doodie in my pants when I turn back inta a grown up&quot; she warned.<br />
Setting to work Jeff moved her dress out of the way and undid the tapes. Opening up the pamper he nearly gagged at the stench as he pulled it out from under her, catching a brief glimpse of a brown mound inside the yellowed padding. Grabbing the wipes he generously cleaned her rear of the remaining brown mess, his mom holding her legs up high while also sucking her thumb during the changing process. She ended up giggling and kicking during the wiping but otherwise behaved herself and in no time at all he was applying baby powder to her diaper area and slipping a brand new pamper under her bottom. After taping the padding on he wrapped up and disposed of the old one as the toddler girl stood up.<br />
&quot;Yay I gotta new diapie&quot; she cheered enjoying the feeling of a fresh pair hugging her bottom. It however only last for a few more seconds as she suddenly started to glow as she began to grow older. Her cute little dress was quickly replaced with the adult clothes she had been wearing before she regressed and she frowned as the diaper she had been changed into morphed back into boring old panties.<br />
Now back to her original age his mother walked over to him and swiftly picked him up, holding him in her arms.<br />
&quot;Thanks for doing that for me Jeffy, I really enjoyed that. Maybe next time your father and sister aren&#39;t home we can play together again&quot; she promised with a bit of sigh and frown, already missing her youth. &quot;Now before I go start getting dinner ready for your father I should probably check to see if you need a change&quot; she said before inspecting Jeff&#39;s padding only to find it still used. &quot;Huh, you&#39;re still clean. Well you just go ahead and play and if you need a change just come get me. Be good now&quot; she said giving him a kiss on the forehead before setting him down and leaving the nursery.<br />
Jeff stood there bemoaning the loss of his toddler mother when he decided...</p>
