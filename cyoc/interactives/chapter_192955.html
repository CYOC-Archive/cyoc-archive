<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While slowly making out his lover, Joe still couldn&#39;t wrap his mind around the fact that this person was really Anna, his beautiful, sexy, feminine blonde girlfriend Anna... hard to believe as it was, he had no doubt it is her, the height is the same, he recognized the identical eyes and the way she... (he?) kissed was unmistakable to him. In fact he realizes that just like with her eyes, the inside of the mouth, the teeth, the tongue, these were also left unchanged, left uncovered by the elaborately realistic skinsuit. In stark contrast though was the undeniable erection which now proudly tented Anna&#39;s new men&#39;s slacks, grinding perversely against Joe&#39;s own bulge. That is obviously something Anna did not previously possess and obviously should not be there. She&#39;s a woman, how can a woman suddenly grow a cock? Well the question seemed unimportant, since the warm erection rubbing slowly against him felt damn real, too real to not take seriously! <br />
With almost scientific curiosity, Joe reached down with his hand to explore the offending organ. He carefully massages the girth and runs his fingers along the throbbing length. He could clearly conclude this was actual flesh and not some kind of rubber dildo, he could feel blood pumping through the warm phallus which causes the erection exactly as it should. Joe had to admit he is also impressed with the more than respectable size, easily longer than his own by at least 2 inches and thicker too! He explores underneath as well and at this point he&#39;s not really surprised to meet a heavy scrotum to match. Now equipped with a full, healthy, functional and REAL male genitalia meant that whether he liked it or not, and no matter how this was achieved, this person DID undergo a sex change and could no longer be considered a woman. This was no doubt Anna but she, no HE was no doubt 100% male now... <br />
&quot;Incredible...&quot; Joe remarks out loud as he caresses and explores his no-longer-female lover&#39;s flat masculine chest through her...his dress shirt. &quot;You weren&#39;t kidding, you really did become a man somehow...&quot; He concedes, all illusions he might have had that this was just kinky roleplay now shattered. He absentmindedly adjusts Anna&#39;s bowtie and collar as a gesture of symbolic recognition of her transition from woman to man. Anna understood the gesture and smiles proudly. &quot;Yes Joe, I am finally my real gender now. I&#39;m happy to see you like my tie, by the way. Finally I can actually dress nicely in shirt and tie now that I&#39;m the CORRECT gender, am I right? Hahaha.&quot; <br />
&quot;Yeah, finally... Owen.&quot; Joe replies coldly and in his head he considered the repercussions this significant transformation would have on his relationship with Owen... with Anna dammit, her name is Anna! Joe cringed at thinking of her as Owen, he still thought something was wrong here and he needs to fix it, whatever it is... There was no way Anna would really want to be a guy, no way... <br />
Anna perceives Joe wasn&#39;t too happy and as the two of them sat down to eat dinner, she decides to break the ice after an awkward 20 minutes of dead silence. <br />
&quot;What&#39;s on your mind Joe? You look glum, don&#39;t you like the food I prepared?&quot; <br />
Joe finishes up his plate and drops the fork. &quot;The food was excellent.&quot; he says coldly. <br />
&quot;Then what&#39;s the problem?&quot; Anna begins to sound a bit irritated. <br />
&quot;The problem, my chubby bowtied friend, is my girlfriend! This was meant to be a romantic evening with my GIRLfriend!&quot; <br />
&quot;Well, I mean I&#39;m right here with you am I not? You don&#39;t need a girlfriend, you have a boyfriend instead now!! I, I thought that&#39;s exactly what you wanted right? I made myself a man for you Joe, for fuck&#39;s sake!!...&quot; Anna tears up. She removes the glasses briefly to wipe her eyes, then places them on the table instead of putting them back on, suddenly remembering she doesn&#39;t need glasses, it was just an accessory to suit &quot;Owen&#39;s&quot; look. &quot;...goddammit Joe, do you realize I actually transformed myself into this nerdy boy for you, because I love you?!! Because I didn&#39;t want you to dump me since you&#39;re gay? And now you&#39;re telling me you don&#39;t like me all the same? I fucked myself up for nothing??...&quot; Anna sobs in her male voice but she could clearly feel that the skinsuit&#39;s control over her mind loosened. <br />
Joe could not believe what he was hearing. He hurries to Anna and grabs her gently by her thick masculine arm. &quot;Anna, uh sorry Owen... didn&#39;t mean to misgender you!&quot; <br />
Anna cuts him off &quot;Whatever, I don&#39;t care. I&#39;m not transgender Joe, I just wanted to impress you. I&#39;m the same person I always was, I&#39;m Anna, although I guess if you wish you can call me Owen since I&#39;m still technically a man right now... Yeah, call me whatever you like...&quot; <br />
&quot;Anna... I&#39;m glad that talk of wanting to be a man was just pretend, trust me I&#39;m relieved, but why did you think I was gay? Where did that come from?&quot; <br />
<br />
Surprised, Anna recounted what the old man told her at the skinsuit store. She tells Joe how the old man said Joe came there often to look at this particular skinsuit labeled &quot;Owen&quot; and how he expressed his desire for her to look like that since he didn&#39;t like women anymore. <br />
Joe could not believe what he was hearing. He explains that the truth was he actually went to that store just once thinking it was a prop shop, and he might find some good special effects stuff for his job in the film industry. He did remember remarking to the old man that he found the skinsuits creepily realistic and that he shuddered to imagine his girlfriend inside one of those in particular, the &quot;Owen&quot; one. For some reason the old man asked him if he had a picture of said girlfriend and like a fool he did show him a picture. That explains how the old man later knew Anna was Joe&#39;s lover, but it still doesn&#39;t explain why he deceived her? Maybe just to sell her that skinsuit? Who knows? <br />
<br />
It was nice that at least the misunderstanding was resolved between Joe and Anna, however they still didn&#39;t know how to get her out of the male skinsuit or if it was even possible. Joe refused to accept she is stuck like this and he asks her if he can remove her tie and dress shirt so he could look for an opening, a zipper, a seam of any sort. Unfortunately while Joe was undressing her and then began to touch her all over her naked male torso, the fleeting random thought that this seemed like an erotic interaction between two gay men entered her mind. While she did not like that idea and tried to push it away, the physical contact stimulated an erection. The intoxicating sensation was enough to immediately reawaken the skinsuit&#39;s mental influence and the gay male persona takes over Anna once more. <br />
Joe knew something was off when Anna grabbed the shirt and bow tie and ran back to the bedroom seemingly in a hurry to get dressed. <br />
Joe follows and finds her quickly buttoning up in front of the mirror. Joe also notices the bulge in her pants... <br />
&quot;What are you doing Anna?...&quot; Joe asks, raising an eyebrow as &quot;Anna&quot; slides the bow tie around the raised collar but fails to remember how to properly tie it, fumbling hopelessly. &quot;Well, I&#39;m getting dressed as you can see... I mean clearly there&#39;s no way to remove my skinsuit, you saw it yourself, eh? Might as well accept I&#39;ll be a man forever, eh?&quot; She sounded way too excited for Joe&#39;s taste. &quot;Hey, maybe it&#39;s not such a bad thing after all, maybe you could get used to it Joe... Say, could you please help me out with this?&quot; Joe was sure something unnatural was going on at this point, this wasn&#39;t Anna, just like before. He decided to indulge her and redoes her tie, flipping the collar down as soon as he&#39;s done. At this point Anna was grinning like a fool at her reflection, even drooling a bit! She sure developed a shirt and tie fetish, Joe thought watching her obsessively touch her tie and collar in erotic fashion, even moaning from the arousal. Her slacks were once again tented by an obscene erection and soon she even started thrusting her hips back and forth as if to penetrate the air. Joe stared wide eyed, feeling pity in seeing Anna reduced this way. He had to save her from this! <br />
In a moment of sudden inspiration he notices what appeared to be a sort of birthmark or scar on &quot;Owen&#39;s&quot; nape, right beneath where the hair ended. Joe quickly grabs the poor confused Anna in a headlock and thrusts his fingers at that strange scar, pulling on the skin as hard as he could. In one quick motion the stretched patch of skin rips open with a wet tearing sound! &quot;Owen&quot; lets out a shocked little scream then goes limp in Joe&#39;s reverse embrace. Joe sees the small rip on the neck quickly extend on its own along the spine, disappearing under the tight shirt collar and at the same time he literally feels the body deflate considerably! He can now hear Anna&#39;s familiar voice gasping and breathing hard like she just had an orgasm and he&#39;s happy to see a patch of her lighter skin as well as a lock of her long blonde hair spilling out through the opening in the skinsuit. Anna gasps in fear knowing she had to get out of the suit fast before it could close back up. She pulls frantically at the bowtie with Owen&#39;s deflated hands, throws it to the floor and undoes the buttons on the shirt as fast as she could, discarding it and managing to wiggle out of the pants and boxers when she feels the painful thrust of the suit&#39;s meaty inner cock penetrate deeply and forcefully her womanhood once again to quickly re-establish the biological connection. Anna screams &quot;NOO NOT AGAIN PLEASE!&quot; as she feels the myriad little fleshy tendrils connect to the surface of her skin to quickly transfer all sensory information from the suit. In less than a second the pain subsides and she once again feels the skinsuit&#39;s cock as her own. As much as she hated to admit it felt sinfully good to watch her cock spring to life again and she couldn&#39;t help but moan &quot;yes...yes...yes please make me a man again please!!!&quot; as she hardened to a full mast erection. As the skinsuit&#39;s flesh filled out once again, solidifying into its proper shape and the tear on the back sealed itself completely shut, Anna coughs a few times to allow her female voice to crack and deepen into the masculine tones she now wished wholeheartedly to have. Satisfied she grabs her dick with her once again thick, meaty hand and pulls the skin slowly down to reveal the wet glans. She didn&#39;t really care anymore if the skinsuit was brainwashing her again, she welcomed now it honestly... She felt extremely aroused and high and she only knew she was happy to be a man again... <br />
Joe&#39;s brain on the other hand was not addled and while he allowed this scene to play out due to morbid curiosity, now he saw his chance to free Anna for good. He lunges in and rips the skinsuit along the back then reaches in and pulls the gasping woman out before the damn thing can seal her back into its bondage. The skinsuit collapses heavily to the floor with a disgusting squelching sound and Joe cradles his scared and confused lover as she shivers and gasps for air. &quot;Anna are you ok?&quot; He noticed her naked body is drenched all over in what appeared to be blood, even her hair was soaked. &quot;I feel... I feel ashamed Joe, please don&#39;t take anything I said seriously, I think the suit was brainwashing me...&quot; Joe nodded. &quot;I guessed as much. How did that feel?&quot; Anna smiled shyly. &quot;Actually, don&#39;t get me wrong... It was scary for sure, but it also felt... exciting, dangerous... sort of. Ah forget it heh heh!&quot; Joe laughed nervously. &quot;Anna you shouldn&#39;t play with such things... you know better, you kinky girl you... Now come on, go take a shower to wash off this disgusting mess!&quot; <br />
Anna nods and before heading into the bathroom she turns around. &quot;Ah! Joe, what are you doing there?&quot; She notices Joe intending to pick up the crumpled skinsuit, a disgusted grimace on his face. &quot;Uh, well what do you mean? I&#39;m gonna take this cursed thing back to my work shop to burn it... I mean what if it, I dunno, comes to life or something during the night and climbs back onto you while you sleep? Can never be too cautious!&quot; <br />
Anna laughs amused. &quot;Don&#39;t be silly Joe, I don&#39;t think it can move on its own. Leave it there for now, don&#39;t worry I&#39;ll take care of it... And before you say it, no I won&#39;t somehow trip and fall into it, okay?&quot; She teases in a silly voice. <br />
&quot;Hmm as you wish then, Anna...&quot; <br />
Joe makes himself a coffee to relax while Anna takes a long shower to clean the blood off her skin. Thankfully the stuff comes out much easier than actual blood, and once clean Anna gets dressed in a hot little black dress and applies some sexy makeup, then joins her boyfriend on the couch for the rest of the evening. She knew he had to leave and do some work at the special effects workshop in a few hours and she wanted to make up for all that happened today. Anna made sure to dress and act as feminine and attractive as possible hoping to rectify and redeem her image in Joe&#39;s eyes. She hoped with all her heart he still found her attractive after seeing her in that state and maybe worst even, hearing her speak all that disturbing transgender stuff. Although she knew Joe was aware she wasn&#39;t herself, quite literally, she was worried that he still won&#39;t be able to look at her the same way again. Maybe he could forgive this mishap?...</p>
