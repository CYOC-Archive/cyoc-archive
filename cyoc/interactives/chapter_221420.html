<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I think I will try to fix things,&quot; Colin said. &quot;I&#39;ll first turn you guys back to normal, and then I&#39;ll try to get us to have harems of our own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If that&#39;s what you&#39;d like,&quot; you said. While there was a tiny part of you okay with this arrangement, you didn&#39;t really care what Master did with you so long as it made him happy. &quot;Now, where is this genie?&quot;<br />
<br />
Colin picked up a dented lamp and rubbed it. Pink smoke poured out of it, and a busty blonde with a long ponytail appeared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi there!&quot; the girl asked excitedly. &quot;Soooo, how do you like your harem?&quot; You started to understand why Colin might have had such an issue with this one. Were you the only woman in this house with something going on between her ears?<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah, not that much, actually,&quot; Colin replied, adjusting his glasses. &quot;I didn&#39;t want you to turn my friends into girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, really? Huh, that&#39;s interesting,&quot; the genie said. &quot;I&#39;m sooo sorry about that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As long as you fix it, I can forgive you,&quot; Colin said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? Yay!&quot; You rolled your eyes. Oh boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish for you to change my friends back to the way they were,&quot; Colin announced.<br />
<br />
&quot;I get what you mean!&quot; the genie said with a knowing wink. &quot;And, to make up for my oopsy-daisy, I&#39;ll make sure you will enjoy your new harem.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank y– wait, what?&quot; Colin asked in alarm. Even you sat up a little straighter. What had she meant by that? But it was too late. Six pink wisps of smoke swirled around in the air while the genie disappeared. Four of the smoke trails flew beneath the gap in the door. Two of them flew at you and Colin.<br />
<br />
Before you could say anything, your vision was obscured by pink smoke. You could feel odd sensations happening to your body and your mind. It felt slightly familiar, as if this had happened to you before but you&#39;re only now aware of it. Was it because you had witnessed the genie using her magic? In any case, you glanced down at your body. You could feel your boobs shrinking but also getting wider. Your checkered top burst open as firm muscle began to hold them in place. They itched a little as dark hairs began to sprout across them and down your stomach. You pressed a, for now, dainty hand to it. A slight belly pushed out against your hand. You could feel large abdominal muscles laying just beneath the layer of fat. Your shoulders widened and swelled, pushing your arms apart. Your new muscular pecs plumped up and bounced a little as you shivered. It felt just as erotic as when your tits would bounce. The strange feeling traveled down your arms. Strong muscle beneath a layer of fat expanded them. Your hands grew thick and meaty. Black hair sprouted from your arms. You flexed your now football-shaped biceps. The checkered top shrunk down into a checkered handkerchief and stuck itself into your pocket.<br />
<br />
You felt a shiver of pleasure as your newly returned penis thickened and lengthened. It throbbed with pleasure, and you hissed as it grew to a solid 9 inches. It pulsed beneath your hand as you found yourself stroking it. Your balls, the size of eggs, nestled against your growing thighs. Your quads swelled and competed for space. Your ass became huge from the sheer muscle and fat that your body continued to pile on. Your Daisy-Dukes grew down the length of your longer legs.<br />
<br />
Your hair pulled back into your head. The blonde quickly darkened to black. A five-o&#39;clock shadow sprouted across your firm jaw. You bit your lip and grunted as you continued to pump your dick. The hat on your head was now a fully traditional cowboy hat. You held it in place with one hand while you pumped. Somehow you knew that the high heels you left at the front door were now a pair of cowboy boots.<br />
<br />
With that thought came memories pouring in. You remembered going to college in your twenties to get an engineering degree. It came in mighty handy when working on your father&#39;s farm, which now belonged to you. You remembered working with your alma mater to have some engineering interns work on the machinery and to develop better ways to have a productive farm. You remembered meeting Colin through that program and feeling a kind of an attraction building. You were forty at the time, but damn was he the hottest thing you had ever seen. Something about scrawny, short, and nerdy gets you riled up in all the right ways. His small dick was always fun to suck off, just like it was right now.<br />
<br />
Right now? You opened your eyes, finding yourself kneeling before Colin with his dick in your mouth. Your hand was still pumping away. Your jeans were pooled around your ankles. Colin had his head leaning back and staring at the ceiling while his hand guided your head up and down his little member. God, this was so hot! You swirled your tongue around his dick, somehow knowing that was exactly what he liked. Colin moaned, and his dick began to pump his delicious seed into you.<br />
<br />
He suddenly seemed to come to his senses and pulled out of you. You tried not to groan, but that was what Colin wanted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mark, what the fuck? I don&#39;t know what happened!&quot; Colin complained, quickly pulling up his pants. &quot;The last thing I remember is seeing a bunch of pink smoke and feeling weird. I&#39;m so sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
You wiped up the last bit of cum off your chin. &quot;Hey, man. Don&#39;t worry about it.&quot; You licked up the rest off your hand. &quot;I&#39;m not even the least bit upset about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Colin&#39;s eyes widened with shock and a hint of desire. &quot;Fuck, man. That genie messed my wish up again. Now, you&#39;re just an older cowboy dude. But you&#39;re still a part of my harem? You&#39;re still into me?&quot;<br />
<br />
You hoisted your new body up and pulled your jeans back on, easing your slightly leaking thick member back inside. &quot;Guess so. It was kinda hot, don&#39;t you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Colin said, staring at the large bulge. He shook his head. &quot;Dammit, and the genie made me gay. Or at least attracted to you guys?&quot; He gasped. &quot;Oh no! The guys! What do you think happened to them?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only one way to know for sure,&quot; you said. You opened the door and guided Colin back down the stairs.</p>
