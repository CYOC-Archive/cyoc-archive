<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With a newfound sense of power coursing through his veins, Todd&#39;s gaze shifted from the transformed blonde, Becky, to the brunette named Carol who was still in shock. He admired her slender figure, her long brown hair cascading down her back, and her innocent eyes that were wide with disbelief. But Todd had other plans for her. He quickly navigated through the remote&#39;s menu, selecting the options for personality and appearance. He set the parameters for her transformation - gothic, SSBBW, dark makeup, piercings, tattoos. He also adjusted her personality settings, making her incredibly promiscuous, constantly aroused, and with a penchant for deviant taboo fetishes including threesomes. With a wicked grin, he aimed the remote at the brunette and pressed the change button. The transformation was instantaneous. The brunette&#39;s body began to expand just like Becky&#39;s had, but this time it was more dramatic. Her clothes morphed into a tight-fitting black corset that strained against her expanding bust and a short leather skirt that barely covered her swelling hips and thighs. Her once soft features hardened as dark makeup appeared on her face - smoky eyeshadow, thick black eyeliner, and blood-red lipstick. Her hair turned jet black and fell in messy waves around her shoulders. Silver piercings appeared on her nose, lips, and eyebrows, glinting under the library lights. Her arms became canvases for intricate tattoos - skulls, roses, and various symbols that screamed rebellion. But the most noticeable change was in her demeanor. The once shy and reserved brunette was now oozing sexuality. She ran a hand through her hair and let out a low moan, her eyes half-lidded with desire. <br />
<br />
She looked around the library with a predatory gaze, as if she was hunting for her next conquest. The library once again fell into stunned silence as everyone took in the sight of the transformed brunette. Becky, still in shock from her own transformation, stared at the brunette with wide eyes. The librarian dropped her glasses, her mouth agape. The jock looked like he was about to faint. Todd watched the scene unfold with a satisfied smirk. His remote had worked again, and this time, he had molded Carol into a gothic, promiscuous SSBBW out of a shy, innocent brunette.<br />
<br />
Todd&#39;s eyes gleamed with mischief as he turned his attention to the librarian Mrs. Dennis. The old woman was still in shock, her glasses hanging precariously on the edge of her nose as she stared at the transformed students. Todd couldn&#39;t help but chuckle at the sight. But he wasn&#39;t done yet. He navigated through the remote&#39;s menu, selecting the options for age and appearance. He set the parameters for her transformation - Korean, 19 years old,style/ personality: Kim Yo Jong. This was a more complex transformation, but Todd was confident in his device&#39;s capabilities. With a deep breath, he aimed the remote at the librarian and pressed the change button. The transformation was immediate and dramatic. Mrs Dennis’ wrinkled skin smoothed out, her grey hair darkened to a glossy black, and her body shrank, losing decades of age in mere seconds. Her clothes morphed into a stylish North Korean suit, complete with a skirt and jacket. Her face slimmed down, her features becoming more delicate and refined. Her eyes widened, taking on an almond shape, and her lips became fuller, painted with a soft pink lipstick. The old librarian was gone. In her place stood a young woman Named Emma park who bore a striking resemblance to Kim Yo Jong and took her impersonation very seriously dressing like her everyday. She looked around in confusion, her eyes wide with shock as she took in her new appearance gradually accepting it as reality. The library fell into stunned silence once again. Becky and Carol stared at Emma, their mouths agape. The jock looked like he was about to pass out. Todd watched from his corner, a triumphant grin on his face. His remote had worked again, transforming Mrs Dennis into Emma.<br />
<br />
Todd&#39;s gaze finally landed on the jock named Jerry, who was still in a state of shock from the transformations he had witnessed. Jerry was a muscular specimen, his body honed from countless hours in the gym. But Todd had a different vision for him. He navigated through the remote&#39;s menu, selecting the options for age and appearance. He set the parameters for the jock&#39;s transformation - 18 years old, a lookalike of his Todd’s mother Susan, but with his muscular physique and male groin intact. With a smirk, Todd aimed the remote at the jock and pressed the change button. The transformation was immediate. Jerry’s body shrank slightly, his features softening as he morphed into a younger version of his mother. His hair lengthened, turning into a soft brown that cascaded down his shoulders. His face became more feminine, his eyes widening and his lips plumping up. His clothes morphed into a tight-fitting dress that accentuated his muscular physique. Jerry looked down at himself in shock, his eyes wide as he took in his new appearance. He looked like an 18-year-old version of Susan, but with his muscular body and male groin intact. But Todd wasn&#39;t done yet. He navigated through the remote&#39;s menu again, this time selecting the option for relationships. He programmed the remote to make everyone in the library think they were in a polyamorous relationship with him. With a final press of the change button, a wave of energy swept through the library. Everyone&#39;s eyes glazed over for a moment before they refocused, their gazes landing on Todd with newfound affection. Becky, Carol, Emma, and Jerry all turned to look at Todd with adoring eyes. They moved towards him, their bodies swaying seductively as they closed the distance. Todd leaned back in his chair, a satisfied grin on his face. His remote had worked perfectly, transforming the people in the library and altering their perceptions.</p>
