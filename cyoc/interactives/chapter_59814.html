<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>As you stood there naked, with Ben looking you over, you couldn't help but to feel a bit sheepish. Immediately, Ben noticed that you got a 
bit tense. Wanting you to be comfortable, Ben hopped off the bed and walked right over to you. With Ben standing by you, chest to chest, he 
smiled sympathetically and put his massive hands on both of your shoulders, bracing you while kneading your shoulder muscles, hoping to get 
you to relax. Instantly, with his touch, your body released its tension and at that moment nothing mattered. Standing there, you could not help 
but to look down at his member, which made you blush a bit.</br>
<br>Dangling there limply, you took note of every detail of his flaccid cock. It was probably one of the most beautiful cocks you had ever seen 
since you started to explore your sexuality. His definitely kept himself pretty clean down there, since his scrotum was completely shaved and 
his pelvis had just a slight amount of stubble, which indicated he hadn't shaved his pubic region in a day. Even in its soft, flaccid state, you 
could see that he had thickness to his cock, along with a nicely shaped mushroom head. It was fat, round and supple... just the way you liked it. 
There was no point to it, as it looked like a rock that had been smoothed over by running water for hundreds of years, with a slit cut into it. 
You also noticed that his head was just as wide was the shaft, which you really liked. When you got it, you wanted to have the same size all the 
time and not taper one way or another.</br>
<br>As you look back up at Ben, who was still kneading your shoulders, you saw that he was smiling.</br>
<br>"You like what you see down there buddy?"</br>
<br>You smile and start to talk, trying not to giggle like a giddy school girl. "Yeah... I do. In fact, you are probably one of the fewest guys I 
have seen that had decent girth to his cock, even while flaccid."</br>
<br>"Yeah..." Ben said with a grin. "Not too many fellas out there have a setup like mine. Hell, being on this cruise as much as I have been, you 
see a lot of guys and their equipment. There was maybe one or two guys that I have seen that have an equipment setup like I do."</br>
<br>"Really?!?" You asked in disbelief.</br>
<br>"Yeah, totally being honest with you. While we are being honest, I think you have nice equipment yourself. I like my guys on the thick side 
too, but when I am with a guy, I look for a lot more than cock size. It's great in the bedroom, but it's not good for much else... you know what I 
mean?"</br>
<br>"Yeah... I know exactly what you mean. Although, I have always wanted my piece to be a lot like yours... hell, exactly like yours." You say 
with a grin and a wink.</br>
<br>"Oh... is that so? Well... I will let you in on a secret Brandon. You can customize your very first transformation, but you are going to have 
to be very quick. By the look of things in the sky, I'd say there is about five minutes before all the new guests experience their first 
transformation."</br>
<br>"Well then show me what I need to do to have a cock like yours!"</br>
<br>Ben smiled, then grabbing your hand, he guided you over to where the television was tucked away. On the side, he opened a secret panel 
and exposed a finger scanner like for the exit door.</br>
<br>"There, go ahead and scan your finger so the computer recognizes your identity."</br>
<br>Not wanting to waste precious time, you do as you were told, even though you really wanted to ask several questions. As the computer 
finished your scan, a disembodied voice could be heard in the room that sounded like a strong lumberjack type guy.</br>
<br><em>Brandon Davis, first time aboard the Pleasure Princess, how would you like to customize your transformation this evening?
</em></br>
<br>You look at Ben, not knowing what you should do or say and remained silent. Knowing that you needed help, Ben steps in, having just a 
couple minutes to make alterations for you.</br>
<br>"Computer... Mr. Davis would like to have a penis and balls to match my own."</br>
<br><em>Secondary user, please identify yourself by scanning your finger into my system so I may access your personnel file.</em></br>
<br>Doing as he was told, not really sure if this work, only having been told about this near the very end of his last voyage in another section 
of the boat. The computer made a few audible beeps in a tone to indicate its point in processing.</br>
<br><em>Secondary user identified, William Johnson, multiple visitor. His male equipment will match your own after the initial transformation 
process. Are there any other requests or would you like to see where Mr. Davis goes on his own?</em></br>
<br>"No computer, there are no further requests..." Ben said, being abruptly interrupted by you.</br>
<br>"Computer..." You say, slightly unsure of yourself. "I would like to have similar physical attributes as well, at the very least. If what my 
transformation is less than his in muscle and body hair, I would like to be like him in that respect as well. If it is better than him, then I will be 
happy to take what I am given."</br>
<br><em>Understood. Match Brandon Davis's physicality with William Johnson unless physical attributes are greater. Is this the same for your 
endowment?</em></br>
<br>You look at Ben, he smiled wryly while shrugging his shoulders, leaving that completely up to you."Computer..." You said hesitating, 
knowing that this was your only chance to make sure you would be big like you've always wanted. You also assume that what Ben had when 
hard was going to fulfill your desires and decide to just match Ben. "No computer, I want the same setup like Mr. Johnson."</br>
<br><em>Understood. Leave male endowment to be exactly as William Johnson's. All changes are accepted into the system and no more 
changes can be made. Time to initial change is thirty seconds. Enjoy your stay as well as the new you.</em> As it finished speaking, you 
noticed the panel slide closed and Ben looked happier than you had ever seen him.</br>
<br>"What's up Ben?"</br>
<br>"Oh... nothing..." He trailed off as his voice cracked.</br>
<br>"Come on Ben, I know there is something that you aren't telling me."</br>
<br>"Well... it's... it's just you've made me a very happy man."</br>
<br>"Oh... how so?"</br>
<br>"Well... you don't know what it looks like when hard, so you are taking a big risk. I mean, you could be any size that you wanted, but yet 
you chose to trust me... a complete stranger." He said as you saw a tear stream down his cheek from both of his eyes.</br>
<br>Not being too far from him, you take a couple steps to get close and place your hand on his stubbly cheek, rubbing your thumb on his 
skin gently and comfortingly.</br>
<br>"Yeah, you have a point since this is the one and only chance to make personalized changes, but you wanna know something?"</br>
<br>"What's that?"</br>
<br>"There is something that I feel between you and I that is different from how I feel about most guys. I have this feeling like I can trust you 
completely. While I know that may sound weird, it is just the way I feel."</br>
<br>Ben smiled from ear to ear warmly, a few more tears running down his cheeks, spreading his arms and walks to you to embrace you in a 
big hug. It was seldom that he ran into men like you and it was comforting. He felt that there was something about you that was different than 
the others. Ben wasn't sure what that was, but he was definitely more than willing to see where things would go between the two of you.</br>
<br>Suddenly there was an audible chime that sounded once and as you look at Ben, you see that he was still smiling and nodded toward the 
speaker.</br>
<br>"Hope your ready, that was the preparatory chime so that first timers know to be ready for the initial change."</br>
<br>Before Ben could say another word, the chime sounded again and you felt that something was different than how you normally felt. 
</br>
<br>Suddenly, you could feel things becoming different. Your muscles slowly inflated, becoming very large and voluptuous. Your forearms 
were tapered, defined and massive . Your biceps and triceps inflated to the width of a common day basketball. Your pecs inflated to be 
mountainous, but soft and supple like a pair of man pillows with small, taught and erect. Your stomach flattened out, losing the paunch that 
you heated and wanted to be rid of for a very long time. Your legs thickened out to the size of tree trunks with calves to match. As your 
muscles stopped changing, you noticed your skin started to itch. Slowly, thick and medium brown hair started growing out of all of your pores, 
covering your forearms, chest, and abdomen while avoiding your pelvic region all together.  Then the hair continued lightly around your thighs, 
thickening in coverage the closer it grew toward your knees and kept the same thickness as it went down your shins to your ankles. Thinking it 
was all over, you felt your "little" man start to stir, but it never got erect. Slowly, you watched it fill with blood slightly as it started changing in 
shape and thickness, matching what Ben had, but you also noticed that your balls grew to be slightly bigger than Ben's, which just meant that 
you were going to be a bit more productive in the seed department.</br>
<br>Feeling like things were done, you just smile. Ben looks you up and down, smiles and winks.</br>
<br>"Looks like you are a hair bigger than me all around, except where you wanted. Not to mention, you also have a nice shadow that you 
didn't have before the change."</br>
<br>"Really?!" You said illicitly. "So now that that is over, what's next?"</br></p>
