<br />
It was the start of the new year, it had seemed like so much had occurred with the Harris family in the last couple of months, but the whole family was happy to be together again. So a couple of days into the new year, Aaron made an announcement to his family as well as Nyx who had still been there after the holidays, she had told her parents she would go back home when she felt ready and they were okay with that.<br />
<br />
“Okay, so, moms, sisters, Mason, I wanted to....” Aaron began.<br />
<br />
“Ahem.” Fenrir said interrupting Aaron.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry, moms, sisters, Mason, and Fenrir,” Aaron corrected himself as Fenrir gave a smile. “I wanted to make up for the time we missed together along with missing Nyx,” Aaron said holding Nyx’s hand as Nyx herself blushed a little.<br />
<br />
“So I thought it might be a good idea for us to have a little family vacation in the kitsune realm. Nyx hasn’t been there before, and now that the civil war is over, I thought it might be nice to show her around.” Aaron announced to the family.<br />
<br />
Kari, Haley, Mason, and Fenrir weren’t particuarly thrilled about the idea of going back so soon after helping to put an end to the civil war, but they wanted their brother and Nyx to have a good time together and there was definitely more to do over in the kitsune realm since it was still the winter season on Earth.<br />
<br />
“What do you think honey? It has been a while since we went to the kitsune realm together?” Mika asked her wife as she thought about it.<br />
<br />
“Well, I do still have vacation time left before getting back to work, alright, let’s take a trip to the kitsune realm.” Claudia said as the kids were happy their mothers would be coming along with them.<br />
<br />
“I think you’ll love it over there Nyx, the countryside of the kitsune realm almost looks like something out of a painting.” Kari commented to Nyx.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, plus there’ll be plenty of romantic spots for you and Aaron to go to, right bro?” Haley nudged her twin brother as they both blushed at that thought.<br />
<br />
“Do you think you and I could have a little time together too Aaron? I want to show you all the fighting moves Fukushu taught me, and maybe we can even have a sparring match in my hybrid form with Fenrir.” Mason said to his brother.<br />
<br />
“I would like to see how you fare against us master Aaron, I’ve been told your fox form is certainly formidable in combat.” Fenrir chuckled.<br />
<br />
“I think Tatsu and Shizen wouldn’t mind us all staying with them for a few days, oh, that’s another thing to look forward to Nyx, you’ll get to meet them now as Aaron’s girlfriend.” Claudia said as Nyx looked a little nervous about that now.<br />
<br />
Nyx had indeed met Tatsu and Shizen before when they came to meet her parents, but that was years back, now things were a little different, especially since she was dating the grandson of the two. She hoped they would still have a good opinion of her. The family as well as Nyx packed up some of their belongings before they left, although the last thing they had to do was let Fenrir use the backyard to relieve himself. In no time at all, they all arrived over in the kitsune realm thanks to Mika and Claudia opening up a portal. The entire group arrived in the kitsune realm as Kari and Haley changed into their fox and tiger forms.<br />
<br />
“Well moms, it’s been some time now, but I think the kitsune realm has made a speedy recovery thanks to the likes of yours truly as well as my awesome siblings.” Haley boasted as Kari shook her head at her sister.<br />
<br />
“Wow, it’s so amazing!” Nyx said astonished as they had all arrived just outside of the city away from the capital so they could get a full look at the scenery.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, it certainly is something the first time you see it,” Aaron said holding Nyx’s hand. “I remember the first time we brought Mason here as a toddler, we had to keep him from running around everywhere because he kept wanting to meet everyone and see everything.” Aaron recalled as Nyx and the rest of the Harris family chuckled.<br />
<br />
“I was a little kid, can you blame me?” Mason said sarcastically while blushing from embarrassment.<br />
<br />
“Oh, honey, we know. We just love what an adorable little boy you were.” Mika said giving her son a hug as they walked towards the city.<br />
<br />
As they were walking through the city, a couple of young kitsune girls were laughing and playing in the street as they walked by and pointed to them then they talked to each other and ran over to tell an adult nearby who was sweeping as she too stopped and looked at the group with a little astonishment. As they walked further into the city, they stopped by a bakery where a couple were selling some of their pies on the street as Kari came over after smelling the alluring aroma of the freshly baked pies.<br />
<br />
“Oh, that smells delicious, how much for a pie?” Kari asked as the woman at booth counter had her back turned while getting a freshly made pie from her husband at the open window who had a surprised look on his face unbeknownst to his wife.<br />
<br />
“If you’d like one pie, that’ll be 500 yen, if you’d like more than one then that’ll be.....” The kitsune woman suddenly faltered when she turned and saw Kari “It’s.....oh my....it’s....it’s really you!” The woman said dropping her pie on the ground.<br />
<br />
“Uh....yes, it’s me. Do I know you?” Kari asked a little nervously.<br />
<br />
“Oh no, not in the slightest but I know you, you’re one of the heroes of the war!” The kitsune baker woman said as she looked behind Kari to see Haley and Mason too. “Why, it’s all of you! I never thought I’d live to see the day when you would grace us again. Now who are these lovely ladies with you?” The kitsune baker asked looking at Mika and Claudia.<br />
<br />
“Oh, we’re their mothers.” Mika replied.<br />
<br />
“Yep, they learned their best manners from us.” Claudia bragged a bit, liking the attention her and her kids were getting.<br />
<br />
“Their mo....oh my! Keiji-kun, give me the next two freshest pies from the oven!” The kitsune woman called out to her husband as he got two freshly baked pies and the wife put them into a box.<br />
<br />
“Please accept these pies from us to your family as a thank you for saving our land.” The woman said.<br />
<br />
“Oh, uh...thank you, that’s very kind of you.” Mika said as she grabbed the boxes from the woman.<br />
<br />
“Arigato!” The woman said as she bowed toward the family as they all proceeded towards the capital.<br />
<br />
The Harris family along with Nyx were all surprised by the smiles and waves that they were getting from the citizens and while Kari waved back a few times, Haley waved to nearly everyone on the street. Mason even saw a few girls who looked his age waving at him and smiling.<br />
<br />
“Remember Mason, you have Anjelica waiting for you back at home. Do not be seduced by these temptresses.” Fenrir reminded him.<br />
<br />
“I know, but it is nice to know I’m thought of as a hero to them.” Mason said to Fenrir.<br />
<br />
“Do you wish you could get that same attention from everyone here?” Nyx asked as she held Aaron’s hand as they walked in the back of the family group.<br />
<br />
“Come on, you know me, I’m not really someone who’s into the whole social scene. Besides the only one I want attention from is holding my hand.” Aaron said as Nyx smiled and gave Aaron a kiss on the cheek.<br />
<br />
They all soon arrived at the capital where they were let in and almost as if they had heard about it, Tatsu and Shizen were waiting for the family in the courtyard.<br />
<br />
“Tatsu, Shizen, did you have a prediction or something that we’d be coming today?” Claudia asked almost half joking.<br />
<br />
“No Claudia, we actually got word through the grapevine that the so called ‘heroes of the civil war’ had come back to the realm and were headed to the capital.” Tatsu explained to all of them. He also noticed Aaron amongst them, and before he could say anything, Shizen ran over and gave Aaron an enormous hug.<br />
<br />
“Oh, Aaron! You don’t know how much I missed seeing you. I got so worried when we heard you had vanished, what were thinking worrying your family and your grandmother sick?” Shizen said with her hands on her hips.<br />
<br />
“Grandma, I’m sorry, I was just....working some things out, and can you please not embarrass me in front of my girlfriend.” Aaron pleaded to his grandmother as Shizen looked over at Nyx and raised her eyebrow a little.<br />
<br />
“You look familiar, where have I seen you before?” Shizen asked looking the girl over a little.<br />
<br />
“I’m Nyx Tepes, a princess of the Tepes family Lady Shizen, you met my family some time back.” Nyx said introducing herself and taking a slight bow.<br />
<br />
“Tepes, I thought you looked familiar, tell me how is...” Shizen began to asked before a voice called to her from behind.<br />
<br />
“Shizen!” Everyone turned to see Lisa Tepes rushing over to Shizen with a smile on her face.<br />
<br />
“Lisa!” Shizen said as she caught up Lisa and the two gave each other a hug as they both laughed happily together.<br />
<br />
“Lisa, oh my god, how are you? You’ve never looked better.” Shizen slightly joked looking over at Lisa’s fancy clothes.<br />
<br />
“Oh you know, vampire biology and all that.” Lisa said as she and Shizen shared a little giggle.<br />
<br />
Tatsu and Vlad meanwhile were standing next to each other.<br />
<br />
“Vlad.” Tatsu said with a nod.<br />
<br />
“Tatsu, nice to see you.” Vlad replied with a slight nod.<br />
<br />
“So how are the grandkids? Mine have done so much for the realm since last we spoke.” Shizen asked Lisa.<br />
<br />
“Oh, you know how grandkids are, they’re growing up so fast and falling in love....” Lisa then looked over and saw Nyx standing there and her jaw dropped.<br />
<br />
“Nyxie, sweetie, what are you doing here?” Lisa asked happily hugging her granddaughter.<br />
<br />
“G.G, I didn’t expect to see you here at all. I was at the Harris home and Aaron came back and decided it would be nice for all of us to go to the kitsune realm so he could give me a little tour.” Nyx said looking over at Aaron.<br />
<br />
“Oh, so you’re the one my granddaughter fell head over heels for, are you?” Lisa asked sweetly as Nyx blushed a little bit.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, and I did apologize to her for disappearing on her the way I did.” Aaron said as Lisa’s face suddenly looked serious.<br />
<br />
“That’s good, because if you do anything to hurt my granddaughter again, you won’t like what I would do to you.” Lisa warned.<br />
<br />
“Uh...okay, so grandma how do you....” Aaron began to say before he saw Shizen also had a serious face on her.<br />
<br />
“Did you really leave this beautiful girl without saying a word to her and nearly break her heart? Shizen asked Aaron.<br />
<br />
“We’ve made up!” Aaron and Nyx said together.<br />
<br />
“Oh, that’s so sweet, we’re very happy to hear it.” Lisa said.<br />
<br />
“So happy indeed.” Shizen nodded with a smile.<br />
<br />
“G.G., I think Aaron wanted to know just how you two got to know each other?” Nyx asked Lisa and Shizen.<br />
<br />
“Oh, it was years ago when Tatsu and Shizen visited Tepes manor, we got to talking and found out we had a lot in common: our love of paintings, books, and of course most notably, our grandchildren.” Lisa explained to Nyx.<br />
<br />
“Ah yes, I showed her my favorite picture of you all when you were so young. I think it was when Kari tried to give herself a perm one year.” Shizen recalled.<br />
<br />
“That was an awful idea and you were the one who suggested it grandma!” Kari called out sounding embarrassed.<br />
<br />
“So grandpa, what do you and uh....Nyx’s grandfather have in common?” Mason asked walking over to Tatsu.<br />
<br />
“Well, we found out we have one thing in common.” Tatsu said.<br />
<br />
“What’s that?”<br />
<br />
“Our wives.” Tatsu and Vlad answered together as they both laughed together.<br />
<br />
“But honestly, it’s been so long since we’ve had all of you here together. In fact, I think since things have quieted down much the end of the civil war, I think it would be nice if we were to have a little celebration and invite some of the citizens to the capital.” Tatsu suggested to all of them.<br />
<br />
“That sounds great Tatsu, but we don’t really have anything to wear or anything fancy like that.” Claudia said as Shizen and Lisa’s eyes suddenly brightened.<br />
<br />
“Are you thinking what I’m thinking?” Lisa excitedly asked Shizen and she nodded.<br />
<br />
“Primping and preening!” Shizen and Lisa said together as they jumped up and down.<br />
<br />
“You two seem really excited about this.” Mika said aloud to the two of them.<br />
<br />
“Oh, anytime I get to fix up Nyx’s hair for her is a perfect day in my book.” Lisa said Nyx gave a little smile. She did very much enjoy when her grandmother would fix up her hair.<br />
<br />
“It’ll also give me a chance to help you all with your looks! Oh, this will be so exciting, I don’t think I’ve done this since I help you kids dress up for that little play you put on for us when you all were little.” Shizen recalled.<br />
<br />
“A play? what did you all do?” Nyx asked Aaron as he rubbed his neck.<br />
<br />
“We played Robin Hood, but it was kind of more like that animated movie where they’re all animals. I....played Robin Hood.” Aaron said blushing a little.<br />
<br />
“Oh, so you’re not only my knight in furry armor, you’re also my furry outlaw.” Nyx said as Aaron’s blush grew a little bigger.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I remember that play. Mason played Little John in that, and my poor baby forgot his lines.” Mika said as she gave Mason a little hug and kiss on the head.<br />
<br />
“Mom....” Mason groaned.<br />
<br />
“We can talk about that later, let’s get you all ready for the celebration. Mika, Claudia, I have some clothes you can borrow. Mason, Aaron, you can go with Tatsu and Vlad, I’m sure they have some nice hakamas for you both to wear.” Shizen said as Nyx looked up at the top of the building and whispered something into Aaron’s ear.<br />
<br />
“Uh...actually we’ll both be right there. Nyx and I are going to do something first.” Aaron said as he shifted into his fox form and Nyx wrapped her arms around Aaron’s neck as he took some jumps and they went up to the roof of the main building for Nyx to see the view from above.<br />
<br />
“It looks incredible from up here.” Nyx said as she looked across the distance.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, you do.” Aaron said as Nyx looked at him with a smile as he suddenly realized what he said.<br />
<br />
“No, I mean, it does, I mean, not that you don’t look incredible, but I was just saying that both you and the view look incredible and I wasn’t trying to....” Aaron tried to say as Nyx just shook her head and went over to Aaron and gave him a deep kiss on the lips.<br />
<br />
“You’re so cute when you stutter, it’s one of the things I love about you.” Nyx said as she broke off from the kiss and the two of them stood next to each other on the roof looking at the beauty of the land before them as Nyx lay her head on Aaron’s shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Do you want to get down so you can go get dressed with the others?” Aaron asked.<br />
<br />
“Not yet, I just want to stand here beside you for a little bit longer.” Nyx answered as she held Aaron’s hand. Both of them were up there for quite a while before they came down, it seemed short, but it felt like an eternity to them.<br />
<br />
Eventually Haley shouted from the ground level, “Come on Nyx! We have to get ready!”<br />
<br />
Nyx looked at Aaron and they both laughed. “I guess that’s my cue.”<br />
<br />
They kissed and the dhampir started heading down to join Aaron’s sisters.<br />
<br />
They all went over to the upper district where the finest clothes were sold. Lisa and Shizen were all over the place, insisting Nyx and the others try on kimono after kimono. Finally they were all dolled up. Nyx wore a black kimono with a red obi and red floral pattern. Her black hair was tied up with golden hairpins with red beads. Kari wore a blue kimono with teal accents and matching obi, her hair was styled in an elaborate updo. Haley wore a bright pink and red kimono and had her hair in braided buns. Shizen wore her own golden robes befitting her status while Lisa was adorned witb a long red kimono with glowing sleeves and a white bamboo umbrella, her blonde hair was styled in a traditional edo period style. Mika and Claudia wore matching white and pink kimonos and held fans.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile the men were getting dressed in their own hakamas. Tatsu wore his own golden robes befitting and red clothes and intended to allow Vlad to wear one of his own but Vlad politely declined. <br />
<br />
“Actually my granddaughter had one made for me some time ago, it was a birthday gift.”<br />
<br />
Vlad wore the Hamamatsu and robes Hanako had given him a few years ago; black and red robes that looked regal and natural on the vampire lord. Meanwhile Aaron and Mason were dressed in hakamas as well. Aaron in a black one and Mason in blue and white robes. They also had Fenrir&#39;s groomed so he could appear more elegant.<br />
<br />
While the men still waited for the girls to finish getting dolled up Aaron decided to purchase flowers for Nyx, he knew it was kind of corny but he wanted to anyway. On his way back he ran into Hina. The black and white vixen was dressed up too it seemed. She wore a black and blue kimono and long black haori and her hair was tied back in a bun with a simple silver hair comb.<br />
<br />
“A-Aaron-san. I did not know you had returned. Are you here for the festival?” She bowed.<br />
<br />
“Uh…yea. I didn’t know there was an official event or anything. I’m here with my family…and Nyx.” He explained.<br />
<br />
“Oh—right. The royal palace is having a festival to celebrate the return of the heroes of the civil war.” She replied nervously.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I guess my brother, Mason, and my sisters are sorta heroes now.” He said.<br />
<br />
“Hai. A-Are those flowers for your girlfriend?” She asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes. We recently made up and I wanted to do something. I know it’s cheesy.” Aaron said.<br />
<br />
“I suppose it might be…but it’s sweet…I-I’m sure she’ll appreciate it…” Hina said shyly.<br />
<br />
“Thanks. I uh—a-are you attending?” He asked.<br />
<br />
“Hai. Chisai-san wanted me to go. I’m going with Kiko-san…I-I should get going, gomen’nasai.” She bows again and rushes off.</p>
