<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Victor just couldn't get her mind(his mind just a few moments ago) off the smell of blood, the aroma of flesh, <br />
and of serving the will of her mistress with full dedication. It consumed her to the point of obsession, <br />
knowing how wrong it was, knowing that she wasn't supposed to be feeling this way...that she was really human. <br />
And that she was really a he--, a man. Not this little slinky spawn of Satan. But the more she struggled <br />
against her nature, the harder it became. She started jerking her body involuntarily, almost manifesting <br />
physically the wrestling that was going on between her vampire &quot;un-soul&quot;(for lack of a better term) and her <br />
still present but thoroughly depleted human soul.<br />
<br />
Tim watched with the smug satisfaction that only an evil being could possess. He didn't realize it, but his <br />
soul too was struggling to get out of the hold, the spell that the more powerful demon side of him was putting <br />
him under. Tim had been a skeptic all his life. Not only did he not believe in the supernatural until today, <br />
he wouldn't even allow himself to engage in things that he any magical paraphernalia in it at all. When he was <br />
six, instead of having a magician at his birthday party, his parents had a guy who brought dozens of lizards <br />
and snakes to his house. Instead of reading &quot;Dr. Strange&quot; comics, he settled for Fantastic Four. Instead of <br />
reading Harry Potter, he watched old Doctor Who episodes or read Neal Stephenson's novels. Paul was always the <br />
more gullible one, the D&amp;D freak, the one who believed that magic could exist, and if it did, it didn't <br />
necessarily ruin the fragile continuum that humanity had dug out for itself via the wonders of science. <br />
<br />
As Tim watched the bartender shake and moan in pain, the two would be victims continued to play cards and chat <br />
among themselves, seemingly oblivious to the internal showdown that was going down a few feet in front of <br />
them. Victor still battled against his vampiric urges, now urging him in a sweet, feminine, tempting voice <br />
that it was OK to give in. That the two fellows in front of him weren't meant for anything important, that <br />
nobody would miss them since they had no families to go home to...that they tasted so good. That vampires were <br />
above humans on the food chain, that they didn't understand the dark underbelly of nature as well as dark <br />
beings like vampires did...that it was in your nature now to consume like a wild animal...<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; he said to the demon inside of him. He wouldn't do it. With a sigh, he continued to resist not running <br />
over and bite their throats off right now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah!&quot; she screamed, suddenly taking a glass mug and smashing it against her head, breaking it into little <br />
fragments on the floor. Her head started to bleed, but since it was now a living corpse, no pain was felt. <br />
What was going on? Was the vampiress inside punishing Victor for not turning, or was Victor punishing the <br />
vampiress for trying to turn him? Maybe it was both. The struggle went on unabated for a few more minutes, in <br />
between the raucous laughter of the two men in the back sharing a private joke between themselves.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough&quot; stated Tim regally. &quot;Come here.&quot; The vampiress' body suddenly started accelerating toward Tim, <br />
standing face front in front of her, entirely against either Victor's or the vampiress' will.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I was wrong about you. You want to be a martyr? No blood stains off my clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim's finger nail for his right index started to grow and harden. The curve of it started to appreciate, <br />
becoming far sharper and pointier than maybe any nail in history. Within moments, it was at least a foot long, <br />
now more of an appendage than anything.<br />
<br />
With her left elbow, Tim hooked on the reluctant vampiress' waist and pointed her nail directly on Victor's <br />
heart.<br />
<br />
&quot;See you in Hell, I suppose.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just as Tim was about to stake Victor's heart and turn her into but ash, a hunk of rock salt suddenly pelted <br />
both of Tim's eyes, blinding her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah!&quot; Tim screamed, suddenly blinded and coming to the realization how far he had fallen down the demon hole. <br />
And not even a half hour into it, either. He was pathetic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ma'am, drink this&quot; he heard, reaching out for whatever the men in the back were offering him. He received <br />
nothing, it was for the bartender.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's synthetic blood&quot; Tim heard the other voice say. &quot;We can't turn you back into a human man ourselves, but <br />
we can refer you to a good guy who'll fix you up and remove the nascent demon inside of you. This card right <br />
here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim heard but did not see the man give the bartender, Victor, a business card.<br />
<br />
&quot;And as for you&quot; said the second voice, suddenly talking in Tim's direction. &quot;You're late. We've been waiting <br />
at least two hours for you to arrive, according to your energy signature anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Who are you?&quot; asked Tim, totally confused. They had looked like a couple of older guys playing cards, <br />
but evidently they were more than that. &quot;Secret identities&quot; Tim thought. &quot;Figures&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Who are the two men?</p>
