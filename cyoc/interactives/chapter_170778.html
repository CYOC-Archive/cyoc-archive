<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thinking about the now only socks Jeff and Carl let him reconsider something. &quot;Is it really a punishment for them if they are unaware? Maybe I should let them be aware again, just so they feel the punishment more. And I will need a replacement for a human Carl afterwards.&quot; So he checked through the options the chronivac would give him for a more aware punishment. And soon he found something, even when it could be a bit cruel.<br />
First, he would reset their awareness and memories to just the point it had vanished before. That also meant they would grow back to the size they had then and with being aware shrinking back down again. Next he would put them on again to let them see their new role in his life. They would regain some of their senses too. Being able to taste and smell everything that&#39;s inside their sock bodies and being able to absorb fluids inside. And they would be able to feel every move he would made in them. But there was no need for them being able to see and hear their surroundings, so this two senses wouldn´t need to be restored, letting them be isolated from the world.<br />
Also cruel would be that they would slowly loose their memories again until nothing was left beside knowing that they used to be human and their own name. After a month in that state the memories would reset again, but without them knowing that the have already lost them and restart the process of loosing them again. And that would repeat forever or at least as long as he wanted it to be so. He would add to that that everytime he used them as a masturbation tool the process of loosing memories would jump half a day further with his cum absorbed into them.<br />
The new Jeff programmed this new changes after taking the sock boys off, having layed them back on the bed. When he finally hit enter the socks grew back to human size. It took about twenty seconds before the started to shrink down again, more slowly this time. He couldn´t see any other changes on the outside, but the chronivac had provided a solution. He had a chat like window for each sock-boy, writing their thoughts for him to read. Seeing their thoughts made him laugh about their confusion.<br />
Both had nearly similar thoughts. &quot;After all had vanished from me, why am I still here?&quot; They didn´t know they could still smell and taste with their insides because of their emptiness, something that bothered them deep down. They both didn´t like the empty feeling. They shuddered before they started to shrink down, guessing what was happening. While the old Jeff panicked a bit with &quot;I´m getting smaller. Nobody will be able to tell me apart from any other left sock.&quot; in his mind, Carl was calmer, but took longer to find out what was happening to him. &quot;Whats that weird feeling? It feels as if I´m dragged around. Wasn´t I sitting on Jeff&#39;s bed? Why would someone drag me around on it? Or am I getting smaller and my body drags itself around?&quot;<br />
Jeff took that as opportunity to get them on his feet again, putting them on slowly. Putting on the old Jeff first he observed his thoughts. &quot;What happens now? Is my clone ready to threw me out already? No, whats that smell? Wait, I can smell something? It´s disgusting and ...” There was an puking emoji at the end, giving the new Jeff a good laugh.<br />
<br />
The old Jeff didn´t change his thoughts for a bit, always showing disgust and the need to throw up, so the new Jeff finished putting him on and switched over to Carl. “What is the clone doing? Arg… what is that smell? It´s disgusting cheesy and blrp…” Like Jeff Carl´s chat showed a puking emoji. <br />
When the new Jeff finished putting on both sock boys he wiggled his toes a bit, which resulted for them both to feel weird. It was a mix between being tickled and applying pressure, making it hard for them to decide on either laughing, which Carl did, or moaning in a bit of pain, like the old Jeff did. And that all beside the smell.<br />
“Oh, I will have much fun with you two” Jeff thought as he stood up and worked around a bit. He could see them both screaming in short-lifed pain whenever he only stood on one of them, piked when he sat his feet down on the ground. But Jeff sat down after a minute of torturing them, as he still needed to find a replacement for Carl as a human. <br />
His first thought had been his counterpart, but that was either at Carl´s house or somewhere else he didn´t know, and the chronivac couldn´t tell him. Taking something from Carl´s clothes wouldn´t work either, as the replacement would need them. The same goes for Jeff´s own clothes, beside the socks, as he was wearing the changed boys. That got him a new idea. He checked if it was possible and yes, it was. Grinning he took both pairs of socks from where they laid, and put them next to the computer. There he put the former Jeff´s left sock inside Carl´s right one, and used the chronivac to merge them into one sock. Next he used the program to change the other two socks, Jeff´s right and Carl´s left, into a pair that looked identical to the one he was wearing. Then he duplicated both Jeff´s and Carl´s consciousness from the socks he was wearing over to the new pair.<br />
To the original Jeff and Carl that was confusing. They felt all of the sudden as if they had been split into two, as they could feel both their sock bodies at the same time. Feeling filled and empty at the same time, tasting the new Jeff´s feet. <br />
Jeff then used the merged sock for the new Carl. That way he would also have a reason to hate the originals, and would love to torture them a bit. Slowly the sock grew bigger, while the form already started changing. The tip split into two legs, from it´s sides grew out arms and the top closed mostly into a head, the last bit of the opening becoming Carl´s new mouth. <br />
When the reformed sock stopped growing, more details appeared while the inside filled with bones, muscles and flesh. The cloth surface changed into real skin, on the tips of the newly formed fingers and toes appeared nails, and between the legs grew out Carl´s cock and balls. On the head part formed eyes, ears and a nose, inside the opening mouth teeth grew, and on top of the head hair started to grow.<br />
It took only a couple of minutes to reform the merged socks into a replacement Carl. Next the replacement gained everything that made Carl himself, knowledge, personality and memories were copied over. The only changes Jeff made was for the new Carl to be aware that his socks would be the original Carl and Jeff, thinking Jeff had the copies. Not that it made such a difference, as with the split consciousness it was both pairs like the originals. The other change would be that the new Carl would be a bit more suggestible to Jeff, and would never use the chronivac on either of them or their originals.<br />
The new Carl opened his eyes after every change was finished. He looked at the grinning Jeff at the desk next to him. “Wow, being alive feels weirdly amazing.” Jeff laughed. “Yeah, it´s weird at first. But I´m sure you will like it. Now please put the originals on, so they get their punishment.”<br />
To that the new Carl happily complied. Now the old Jeff was being worn as the new one as his left sock, while also being the new Carl´s right one. Carl had the same predicament with switched sides. And both tasted both feet they were worn onto, tasting the new Jeff, who tasted of their combined cum he had as a sock, as well as the new Carl´s, who tasted like both their feet combined. Completely disgusting.<br />
“What now?” Carl asked. “We will live their lifes, which are now ours. We can wear them endlessly, use them as masturbation aids from time to time. They will be self-cleaning and indestructible, so don´t worry about stains. Just let them dry after using them for a couple of minutes. And we can look at their thoughts whenever we want, seeing how they degenerate mentally before being restored and start it all over again.”<br />
<br />
That was their new lifes now. The new Jeff lived the life of the old Jeff, with a bit of extra control over the new Carl. The new Carl did the same with the old Carl´s life. At the same time both originals “lived” the torturous life of being both their socks, being worn everyday for the rest of their new owners lifes. Said life was even more brutal due the repeating cycle of forgetting their life over a month before regaining it, not realizing that it was a repeating process. They never grew attached to the taste of the feet they were being worn on, which to them didn´t change. They tasted their own combined cum on one half and their combined feet on the other. If they were used as masturbation aids, the cum tasted like the feet, only fresher and stronger as it was absorbed into their very being.<br />
It was only when both replacements died of old age that something changed for the originals. Suddenly they weren´t used as masturbation aids anymore, only being worn in the coffins by their replacments. Also around the death of their owners the undestroyable part deactivated itself, so with time they dissolved around the rotting feet, finally being released from their endless torture.</p>
