<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Being a newly formed dog-man, Jake did what any high-functioning organism would do… stare into a mirror!  Jake would tell you, if he were speaking directly to you now, the mirror did not disappoint.  As his hand paws explored the contours of his ‘new’ anthropomorphic body, his eyes roamed up and down his 6’5” reflection.  His human-influenced mind told Jake he had a swimmer’s build though his head was no different than what he’s been used to his whole life.  His toned musculature of his shoulders and arms was highlighted by his short black dog fur leading to a cut 6-pack laden abdomen dusted with white fur.  Black fur wrapped around his legs which had absolutely thick and beefy quads supported by a familiar hock joint and canine paws.  Though his hind paws were massive to support all his weight and maintain a bipedal digitigrade stance. He nodded in approval as he did a once around, noting his bubble butt and whip-like tail he’d chased many a time before.  Completing his 360, Jake noticed his body was getting as much of a thrill as his mind was as his cock had sprung to attention while he was busy with his self-appraisal.  <br />
<br />
Jake felt his cheeks warm as he inspected, poked, and fondled his 8-inch erect cock.  The conformation was totally new to him.  It was thicker than he remembered and shaped much like he remembered hanging between his master, Mike’s, legs.  Jake’s canid memories flashed images of what Mike would do with his cock and how delighted he seemed.<br />
<br />
‘Now that I’m human,’ Jake reasoned, ‘I should do as human’s do.’ Mike being the only human he knew to pattern after.<br />
<br />
His mind made up; Jake padded over to the kitchen.  His erect cock swinging between his legs as he ventured to the refrigerator to find one of the silver can thingies Mike always had when he lounged on the couch.  Peering inside the magic-like box of cold, Jake found the item he sought while his imprinted knowledge filled in the blanks and identified the can as a beer.  They were all over the house – Mike was not the neatest bachelor – so Jake didn’t think he would miss one.  <br />
<br />
Jake plopped his furry butt on the couch, cracked open the beer, and thought … ‘What else did master do…’  While he contemplated, he sipped the beer and grimaced the first few times as it tasted weird, but he wanted to try all the human things he could.  Looking past the can of beer in front of his muzzle he noticed the box that usually had moving images in it.   Television his human knowledge identified, which usually had a small stick or remote control.  After a few moments of searching, the remote was found and the TV was powered on.  Only to display this odd image bouncing around the screen, declaring something about D…V…D.  <br />
<br />
‘That must be what the other remote is for,’ Jake posited as he grabbed the smaller stick he had found during his exploration and tried pressing the play button.  The television sprung to life as the video picked up where Mike had left off with a human female in bed on her hands and knees being ridden doggy style by a human male.  ‘Porn!’ Jake’s mind screamed at him as his cock sprung to an achingly erect state from the visual stimulation.<br />
<br />
Jake leaned back into the couch, striking the position his memories told him Mike would take, sipped some beer – the flavor was slowly growing on him – and tentatively wrapped his hand paw around his turgid shaft.  Slowly, and with building confidence, Jake slid his paw up and down his cock as he watched the lewd scene unfold in front of his eyes enjoying the simmering feelings of pleasure emanating from his crotch and the bubbly simple-mindedness the beer was providing.  On and on it went as Jake zoned out to the porn and stroked with no urgency towards climax; eventually finishing the beer and adding the empty to the pile.  The on-screen humans went from the bed to the kitchen to against a wall… they were insatiable, and Jake started to feel a burgeoning need to feel what it was like to be them.  Over time Jake got more into the porn as his wants and needs to be the human male on the screen intensified.  His hips began lifting off the couch in a counter motion to his hand paw in time with the porn stars thrusts.  Sex… Jake wanted sex… he never had any as a dog and he wanted so badly to be buried inside a female right now.  His mind raced while pressure was building at the base of his cock to an unstoppable level, catching Jake off-guard and causing his cock to throb as volley after volley of cum sprayed from Jake’s cock onto his heaving chest and surrounding couch.  A mixture of moans and satisfied whimpers escaped his muzzle as he came down from his first orgasm, his mind already made up that it wouldn’t be his last.  <br />
<br />
Jake cleaned up his mess and returned everything to as close he could get to the organic mess it was prior to his porn session, even daring to step into the shower to clean himself up.  Not caring if Mike awoke and found his dog was an anthropomorphic beast.  <br />
<br />
Once dried, Jake made a final once around the house to be sure nothing was obviously amiss; an easy feat to achieve in this stereotypical bachelor pad.  Then went back to the computer and powered up the Chronivac to set his plans in motion.</p>
