<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John shrugged. “I don’t know. I’m not exactly familiar with the area. I suppose you want to get back to your people.”<br />
<br />
Sanin shrugged back. “I s’pose. I have a few ideas for that bitch I married.” He spat on the ground. “Cheating on me with a fucking satyr. The nerve o’ that cunt.” The reference to the satyr made John realize he really was in over his head. He was an orc, a species apparently hated by most in this world, and he was being hunted by something that could appear and take him out in mere seconds.<br />
<br />
“Where can I find more orcs, like myself?” John wanted strength in numbers. When in Rome...<br />
<br />
Sanin pointed in the opposite direction they were walking. “Around the base of that mountain. Sometimes on the mountain, sometimes near the lakes,” he explained. “Sometimes hangin’ dead from the trees,” he muttered quietly.<br />
<br />
“I heard that. This is a dangerous place for people like me, or so I’ve gathered.”<br />
<br />
“Aye.” They stopped walking. “Mate, I wouldn’t go there. Those are some scary c…people… that live there.” <br />
<br />
John was about to comment on the last-second word substitution in that sentence, when his orc blood suddenly ran cold and a tingle ran through his skin. He felt his heart starting to pound in his chest. His body had suddenly detected a source of danger and was telling him about it, but what was it? His already strong orc senses became even more heightened due to the unknown threat. He could hear Sanin’s heart pounding and stomach gurgling. “What’s wrong?” the dwarf asked, his voice booming in John’s powered-up ears.<br />
<br />
The threat was… a smell? Yes, a familiar one, but what was it? It was a short distance ahead of them… constant, not moving. Musty, like an animal’s fur. Like…a goat? The satyr!<br />
<br />
Suddenly, John heard a female scream and yelling ahead of them. Jenny! The satyr had Jenny! “WHERE’S THE AXE!” John roared at Sanin. Sanin, shocked, quickly offered it up. John snatched it and sprinted at great speed ahead, leaving Sanin in the dust. John’s combat flight mode took over, causing the orc to move at an impressive speed while virtually silent.<br />
<br />
After what seemed like hours, three figures came into view. John saw abject terror in Jenny’s eyes. “No, please! Aieee!” she screamed. As the hairy satyr was trying to force himself onto her, Jenny was trying desperately to wriggle free. Kaecinus was hanging by his hands from a nearby tree, thanks to what appeared to be a glowing blue rope produced by the satyr. He wasn’t going anywhere anytime soon. The sight of the satyr trying to rape his love caused John’s rage to reach a new peak.<br />
<br />
“HRRRAUUGGGGHHHH!” John roared, causing birds to scatter from the trees.<br />
<br />
The satyr reeled around. His jaw dropped and the blood fell from his face. “You!”<br />
<br />
John rushed in, seemingly covering the length of a football field in seconds. He leaped in the air with another loud roar, axe ready to strike. The satyr, completely taken aback, didn’t have time to ready any spell. “No!” was all he could manage. “Don’t!” <br />
<br />
The satyr dropped Jenny, and she quickly scurried away as fast as her terrified legs would allow. John struck. The axe made solid contact with one of the satyr’s arms, put up to shield his head. The satyr let loose a goat-like scream, blood spurting everywhere. John screamed as well, ripping the axe out and swinging once again with superhuman strength. This time, the axe connected, in between the satyr’s horns. It spasmed once, eyes rolling back into its head, and then it collapsed to the ground.<br />
<br />
Despite the satyr suffering what appeared to be a mortal blow, John was ready to continue his attack. He pictured himself ripping the demon’s body limb from limb, smearing its blood everywhere. John lifted the axe high above his head, ready to chop up his tormentor’s body into bite-sized pieces. But right as the axe would have landed for a third time, the satyr suddenly disappeared! John clutched his axe tightly and wheeled around, ready for another attack. “WHERE ARE YOU?” John roared.<br />
<br />
“He’s gone,” Jenny said quietly. John wheeled around with a snarl. Jenny backed away with a quiet shriek. The terrified look on Jenny’s beautiful face began to calm John down.<br />
<br />
“Where did that beast go?” John growled. “It’s about to attack us again!”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know where he went. But he won’t be able to hurt me anymore.” Jenny suddenly ran to John and embraced him with a deep hug. Despite Jenny being unable to reach her arms all the way around John’s muscled body, John’s anger melted away at her touch. He felt his orc face get hot. “You saved me again,” Jenny said, tearing up.<br />
<br />
“A...anything for you, princess,” John said. They both leaned in for a kiss. Their lips were about to touch, when...<br />
<br />
“HEY! I’m still up here!” Kaecinus yelled, hanging from a nearby tree. Jenny opened one eye and looked at the elf. After a pause, she gave him an obscene gesture and kissed John, pushing her tongue in between his orc tusks. John heard Kaecinus yelling something else, but neither was paying attention. <br />
<br />
They made out for what seemed like minutes, John’s large hands exploring his love’s body. John hoped his breath didn’t stink too badly, and that Jenny couldn’t feel the large object growing under his blanket loincloth. Their kissing was broken up by an approaching Sanin. “Hell’s bells, what did I miss?” he asked, out of breath, gaping at the orc and elf embracing.<br />
<br />
They finally broke their embrace, love burning in their eyes. “Nothing, I just bludgeoned a satyr to death.” John handed Sanin the axe and gestured at the tree. “Can you get him down from there? Sorry for the blood.”<br />
<br />
“On the double!” Kaecinus shouted. “My arms are about to fall off!”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, well I gotta get me wind back first, mate,” Sanin shouted back. “And howd’ya expect me to get up there?”<br />
<br />
“You have two arms and two legs, don’t you?”<br />
<br />
Sanin sighed. “We’re square after this,” he muttered. Sanin walked over to the tree and slowly began to climb it. <br />
<br />
John was extremely confused. He was staring at Sanin’s ripped ass, visible through his horse blanket loincloth. He had just got done making out with a lady, and here he was imagining going to town on a male dwarf’s rear end. Orcs are content putting their cocks into anything with a hole, he guessed. “How progressive,” he muttered.<br />
<br />
“Huh?” Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
“Nothing. Seriously, are you all right? You were attacked by that satyr. Did he just...appear?”<br />
<br />
Jenny nodded. “We have a history. I’m a crown princess in the royal family and to him I’m just a...a...” Jenny’s voice quivered and she sighed. “If you didn’t kill him, I want the next shot,” she said coldly.<br />
<br />
“Get in line, princess,” Sanin muttered, crawling over the tree branch. Kaecinus wriggled back in forth. “Quit shaking the branch!” The rope holding the elf to the tree, previously glowing blue, appeared to be a normal rope once the satyr disappeared. It was probably an enchanted rope that expired when the satyr...expired.<br />
<br />
“You hurry up! And I better have all ten fingers when you’re done, or your whole family will suffer!”<br />
<br />
“Ain’t got a family anymore,” Sanin said, raising the axe and gently hitting the rope, weakening it.<br />
<br />
“Someone needs to catch me!” Kaecinus said in a panic as the rope frayed. John sighed and rolled his eyes. The drop couldn’t have been more than ten feet. He walked towards the tree and got under the bratty elf just as the rope gave way. “Oof!” he grunted as he fell into John’s muscled arms. He looked up acidly at John. “I didn’t mean you,” he said.<br />
<br />
John stared back. “‘Kay,” he said, dropping him on the ground with a thud. Jenny didn’t bother to stifle her giggle. Sanin roared with laughter, hopping down from the tree.<br />
<br />
“Stop it! All of you!” Kaecinus shouted, dusting himself off. “Come along Jenny, we have to get back to the palace and away from these cretins.” Kaecinus stormed down the road. The other three stayed put. After a few angry steps, he wheeled around. “Well?”<br />
<br />
They stared back for a few seconds, confusion on their faces. Finally, Sanin said “Didn’t you have a horse before?”<br />
<br />
Kaecinus blinked and looked around. “Shit,” he sighed.</p>
