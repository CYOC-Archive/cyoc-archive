<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">pinned to the ground by the source of the voice that it flipped you over, reviling it to be what appears to be a girl. looking at her more closely that she wasn&#39;t just a girl, You find yourself looking up at her as she was a lion. Well, sort of a lion as she was more of a lioness that she Just kissed you.<br />
<br />
her head was smooth and furry with no visible human hair. Two small holes rest at the end of a feline round snout, replacing what should have been a human nose. Like any creature&#39;s ears that hers were round, just like you would expect on a lion. her eyes look human that her smile was undoubtedly wasn&#39;t human as it was more of a muzzle then lips, although it is a nice smile she had when she laid off her kiss.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your payment, is more then Just a kiss, sweetie. &quot; purred the lioness woman, as she presses her mouth tightly against yours yet again. It was useless to resist, even though she really was a good kisser. You can feel her hands tightly gripping your wrists, preventing you from pushing her away. You can feel her long rough tongue moving around inside your mouth while playfully teasing your own tongue. It was a deep, passionate kiss that You find yourself struggling to breathe, but slowly stop. it was A desperate kiss that she doesn&#39;t seem to want to end, but she soon Finally releases you from her embrace.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, that was really good. It has been SUCH a LONG time. &quot; she says wistfully.<br />
<br />
As you gasp for air is when you get a better look at the creature that surprised you as It resembles a cross between a lioness and a woman. Its entire body is covered in fur with a golden base color. unlike any lions you have ever seen before that it has two arms ending in very human looking hands, although the hands were covered in fur. although the creature&#39;s chest is covered in fur that you can see two large bumps beneath them as you could only guess they were breasts. It did have a sexy narrowed waist while giving the appearance of an hourglass figure. it&#39;s tall ended in a nice brown tuft that likewise with her arms, two legs ending in very human feet as they too were covered in fur. she looked like she was a hot sexy model <br />
<br />
&quot;Was it very lovely for you, too?&quot; says the lioness while flicking its tail around.<br />
<br />
You didn&#39;t even want to try wriggling free from the lioness as she tightens her grip around you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why ya looking at me like tat? Don&#39;t ya want your clothes?&quot; asks the lioness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please...please don&#39;t eat me,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
The lioness cokes it head back as she the laughs loudly a bit while loosening her grip a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;oh please, If I wanted to eat ya, you would be dead already. besides, I don&#39;t like to eat people. there&#39;s Plenty of better stuff to eat round. &quot; says the lioness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then please, let me go, or at least get off me. &quot; you say, trying to use the distraction to slip free of her grasp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet. You still owe me,&quot; she says.<br />
<br />
&quot;even thought you just kiss me? &quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
The lioness then sighs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I guess That was just part of my payment. it was my nature as I&#39;m a sexy lioness, But I truly wasn&#39;t lying when I said that I knew who took your clothes and where they are. I can help you get them back and get out of here. If that is what ya want,&quot; says the lioness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you at least let go of me, or at least get off of me?&quot; you ask, still trying to wriggle free of her grip. It seems like it is in constant motion, moving along your body and occasionally gently being squeezed under it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, no can do. If I let ya loose, you will just run away. I mean, it wouldn&#39;t do ya much good as I can run much faster than you can. Besides, all that chasing would just gets both you and me all worked up other nothing as ya might get lost or hurt. even So, you are just gonna have to bear with me until ya hear what I am proposing.&quot; says the lioness.<br />
<br />
&quot; I&#39;m truly am sorry about all the mysterious things and all that stuff as I wasn&#39;t trying to scare ya, nor even hurt ya, But most humans or animals get one long look at me and head for the hills. This was really the only way I could get a chance to talk to you As that&#39;s all I want to do is talk. If ya don&#39;t like what ya hear, then you are free to go while trying your luck on your own. you did the right thing though as I wouldn&#39;t recommend That kangaroo, it was only kid&#39;s stuff compared to some of the other things lurking around here.&quot;<br />
<br />
You realize you have little choice other than to listen to her. you were getting a bit anxious though to get this over with. Feeling her soft smooth fur glide over your nude skin was making you a little....believe it or not, comfortable.<br />
<br />
&quot;well, i do want to get my clothing so i can get out of here, so i&#39;ll hear you out in the terms of your payment. What do you want in exchange for my clothes and leading me out of this forest?&quot; you said as she started to purr in response to your answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;uh Well, it&#39;s like this.&quot; says the lioness softly that she turns away from you. It was as if she cannot bear to look at your face directly that Her tail seems to be moving more quickly while also, furtively. She is clearly agitated, And yet somehow you knew that she&#39;s actually blushing? &quot;What I really need for you to do for payment is to take me with you back to where you live. the reason for this payment is because there&#39;s a lion out there who treats me like garbage, telling me to do thing you wouldn&#39;t dream of telling a girl to do that i don&#39;t want you to know about them. i manage to get away from him as he was mean to me that when i saw you with that kangaroo girl as you gently refuse her offer that you were my chance to get away from him, permanently.&quot; she said as tears started falling off of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;as i said before, if i help you get your clothes back while helping you get back out, will you take me with you?&quot; she said as you gave it some thought about it that you....</p>
