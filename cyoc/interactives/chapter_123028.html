<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A week later, Jase nervously wandered into Jeremy&#39;s dance class. Jeremy, of course, was overjoyed to see him wearing the standard boy&#39;s outfit of white short-sleeved leotard under dark blue tights, white socks and ballet shoes. Jeremy ran up to his friend and gave him a bear hug, welcoming him to class. Jase was a little confused, not knowing why he wanted to do this, but knowing that he really did.<br />
<br />
Like Jeremy, Jase took to dance like he was born for it. His parents supported his new interest, but they were less inclined to buy him a whole new wardrobe of tights. He compensated a bit by &quot;getting ready&quot; for class really early, putting on his practice outfit long before class was supposed to start and keeping it on long after class was over, sometimes still wearing it at the dinner table. &quot;I didn&#39;t feel like changing,&quot; was his excuse.<br />
<br />
He also borrowed from Jeremy, who was elated to have his friend back and they spent a lot of time together, in and out of school, practicing dance or just hanging out in their tights. Sometimes they would watch TV sitting next to each other in the big easy chair, rubbing their legs together. They would look at each while they were doing this and giggle, like they were sharing a secret. But Jeremy&#39;s mom saw them and thought it was adorable.<br />
<br />
Jeremy was disappointed and confused that Frank had never showed up at dance class. What had gone wrong? Frank had touched the tights, hadn&#39;t he? So why hadn&#39;t the nanites worked? Frank seemed to be just as into soccer as he had always been and his wardrobe hadn&#39;t changed at all.<br />
<br />
But one day, Frank came up to Jeremy and asked if he could go to his house after school. Jeremy agreed and when they were alone in Jeremy&#39;s room, Frank asked if he could try on a pair of Jeremy&#39;s tights. Jeremy was thrilled. Maybe it had worked after all! He chose a pair of sky blue tights and handed them to Frank, who stripped out of his soccer shorts and underwear and slowly slid the tights up his legs. A contented smile appeared on his face as his skin made contact with the material. He pulled them up all the way. Then he ran his hands along his thighs and sighed. He said he wished he could wear them all the time like Jeremy.<br />
<br />
Jeremy said, &quot;You can!&quot;<br />
<br />
But Frank shook his head. &quot;My dad would never let me.&quot; He went on to explain that he had gone home with the pair of tights Jeremy had given him, tried them on, and found them to be the most wonderful thing he had ever worn and he wanted to wear them all the time. Then his dad walked in.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell are you wearing?&quot; he shouted.<br />
<br />
Frank told the truth: his friend Jeremy had given them to him. Then he told his dad he wanted to be a dancer and wear tights. &quot;And...&quot; he added, &quot;I want to be called Francis.&quot;<br />
<br />
His dad&#39;s response was to sit down on the bed, pull the boy over his lap, rip the tights off his legs and give him ten hard spanks on his bare butt. Then he pushed the crying boy to the floor and said, &quot;No son of mine is gonna be some sissy faggot!&quot; and he stormed out of the room, taking the balled up pair of tights with him.<br />
<br />
Jeremy hadn&#39;t considered, when he handed the nanite-infested tights to Frank, that Frank&#39;s dad was a domineering soccer dad who had pushed his son into taking up the sport and wasn&#39;t about to let him give it up for ballet of all things!<br />
<br />
Francis didn&#39;t know what to do. He saw Jeremy and Jase wearing tights and practicing their dances during recess and he was filled with envy. He wanted so badly to be with them, but there was no way he could be.<br />
<br />
Jeremy felt incredibly guilty. It was his fault that Francis was no obsesses with dance and wearing tights. Jeremy tried to comfort Francis, telling him he could come over anytime. Jeremy would let him wear his tights and maybe he and Jase could give him private, secret dance lessons. Maybe his dad would come around. But they both doubted that.<br />
<br />
Jeremy didn&#39;t know how to help Francis. He couldn&#39;t talk to Jase because he would have to admit what he&#39;d done with the BeC tights. He couldn&#39;t talk to his mom because he would have to admit he&#39;d used her credit card (she still hadn&#39;t found out). There was only one person he thought might be able to help him.<br />
<br />
He found Kyle by himself in the computer lab, apparently writing code, and asked for his help. He confessed what he had done to Jase and Francis (Kyle&#39;s response: &quot;I figured&quot;) and told him about Francis&#39;s dad&#39;s reaction. Jeremy supposed that maybe the best thing to do would be to acquire a soccer outfit from BeC and give it to Francis so he would be into soccer again. But it would require him to use his mom&#39;s credit card again and he wasn&#39;t sure he could keep getting away with it. He also didn&#39;t really want to push Francis back to soccer. And, Kyle pointed out, if he gave a BeC soccer outfit to Francis, it might not cancel out his interest in ballet. He could become obsessed with ballet AND soccer!<br />
<br />
But Kyle thought of another possibility. &quot;Do you still have your first pair of tights?&quot; He did.<br />
<br />
He brought it the next day, as instructed, to the science lab where Kyle was waiting with a microscope. He examined the tights under the microscope while Kyle stretched and practiced a few moves at the front of the class. &quot;Aha!&quot; exclaimed Kyle, eventually, and he had Jeremy look into the microscope to see what he had found.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s one of the nanobots that didn&#39;t get through. There&#39;s always a few of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. So what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can make copies of his nanobot and reprogram them to do whatever we want!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course, it was a complicated process and Jeremy, being not particularly scientifically minded, couldn&#39;t offer much help. When he asked why Kyle was helping him, Kyle said he like the challenge. When he was satisfied with the nanobots he had manufactured, he explained to Jeremy exactly what he needed to do next.<br />
<br />
The doorbell rang and Francis&#39;s house and Francis&#39;s dad answered the door. He looked down and recognized Jeremy, his son&#39;s sissy gay friend, and he could barely disguise his contempt. Was the little queer actually wearing purple tights?<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, Mr. Howard,&quot; Jeremy said innocent. &quot;Is Francis here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; replied Mr. Howard, sneering.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; Jeremy tried to look disappointed, but he actually knew full well that Francis was at Jase&#39;s house, wearing tights and getting a secret dance lesson. But Jeremy wasn&#39;t there to see Francis. &quot;Well, could you give this to him?&quot; he asked, holding up a video game case.<br />
<br />
The man shrugged and took the case. &quot;Alright,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Jeremy grinned. The plan was practically done already. The man started to close the door, but Jeremy said, &quot;Uh, sir? Can I talk to you for a minute? Inside?&quot;<br />
<br />
The man looked down at the boy. It was odd. A second ago, he wanted the little fairy off his doorstep as fast as possible. Now he suddenly wanted him to stay. Wanted to keep looking at him. &quot;Sure,&quot; he said, and made way for the boy to come inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not so much that I want to talk to you,&quot; Jeremy said when he was in the living. &quot;I want to show you something. Can I use your TV?&quot;<br />
<br />
The man gave him permission and Jeremy turned on the TV. So the kid wanted to show him a video? Mr. Howard sat down on the couch, set the game down and waited. While Jeremy busied himself with the remote control, finding the TV&#39;s YouTube app, he had his back to the man. He stood with his feet together and his back arched a little, making his butt stick out. He took a little longer than he really needed to find the video he was looking for, wanting Mr. Howard to look at him. Ever since he had put on the first pair of nanite-infested tights, Jeremy not only wanted to wear tights, he wanted to be seen in them. He wanted to show off his body. The once-shy boy had become quite an exhibitionist!<br />
<br />
Normally, Mr. Howard would have been repulsed at the sight, but now he found he could not look away from the boy.<br />
<br />
When the video was ready, Jeremy put the remote down and turned around to face the man, holding his right hand up above his head, his left hand on his hip, and his left leg stretched behind him.<br />
<br />
The music began and Jeremy danced. It was a piece from Swan Lake: Von Rothbart&#39;s solo dance from act two. Most male dancers would want to play Siegfried, but Jeremy really liked the outfit worn by Von Rothbart (in his human form) in the DVD he&#39;d seen and he was wearing a version of it now for Mr. Howard: a purple and gold shirt that was tight around the chest but had puffy sleeves and short, frilly cuffs, purple tights on his legs and his black shoes. He danced Von Rothbart&#39;s dance, knowing he was not as good as the professional dancer in the DVD, but hoping he was good enough for Mr. Howard. Kyle had told him it didn&#39;t matter how good he was. He just needed to dance in front of Mr. Howard.<br />
<br />
Mr. Howard was, in fact, captivated by the performance. Why had he never watched ballet before? This kid really knew how to move! How did he even do that thing where he spun around on one foot? It was damn impressive!<br />
<br />
The end of Von Rothbart&#39;s solo called for him to sit down in the throne next to the queen&#39;s throne. Jeremy adapted this move. When the music reached a crescendo, he jumped into Mr. Howard&#39;s lap and looked up at him with a slightly wicked smile. Mr. Howard, in a reflex, put one hand on the boy&#39;s hip and another on his leg to keep him from falling off. He felt a tingling in his hand on Jeremy&#39;s tights-covered thigh and found himself caressing the silky material. Jeremy put his arm around the man&#39;s neck and looked up at him with puppy dog eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Howard,&quot; he whined. &quot;Jase and me would really like it if you would let Francis come to dance class with us, and let him wear tights, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Howard thought about it as he stroked his hand on Jeremy&#39;s tights. To see his own son dressed like this? And learning to dance? Mr. Howard wanted nothing more! But he gave a non-committal, &quot;I&#39;ll think about it,&quot; and reluctantly picked the boy up, put him on his feet and ushered him out of the house. As soon as he had closed the door, however, he regretted it. He wanted to invite the boy back in, maybe show him a few more dances. And he wanted to get his hands on those tights again. But he stopped himself. Instead, he got on his computer to do some research.<br />
<br />
When Francis came home later, his father came to greet him. &quot;Good, you&#39;re home. Brian!&quot; he called out.<br />
<br />
Francis&#39;s eight-year-old brother came running into the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Boys, we&#39;ve got some shopping to do. You both need to get into some tights as soon as possible. And then we need to sign you up for dance classes!&quot;<br />
<br />
Francis was jumping for joy! Brian (the only one in the room not under the influence of nanobots) was incredibly confused.<br />
<br />
When programming his new nanobots, Kyle determined that the best thing to do was to make Mr. Howard really pleased at the sight of boys in tights and boys dancing. They had covered the outside of the video game case with the nanites and also Jeremy&#39;s purple tights (they were programmed to ignore Jeremy&#39;s DNA). They hadn&#39;t taken into consideration Francis&#39;s little brother, Brian, and now Brian was doomed to be in tights for years to come.<br />
<br />
Their dad&#39;s personality really hadn&#39;t changed that much. Instead of being a strict, domineering soccer dad, he was not a strict, domineering ballet dad. If his sons were going to be ballet dancers, they were going to be best ballet dancers in the goddamn country! He became an expert at ballet overnight and learned all he needed to know to help his sons excel at it. And it wasn&#39;t the end of spankings for Francis and Brian. If anything, they probably got more spankings, because it gave Mr. Howard an excuse to touch their tights. He would always rub or squeeze their butt cheeks before every spank and take great pleasure from it.<br />
<br />
But this contact was not always unpleasant for the boys. He would run his hands on their legs while he was helping them stretch and bend. He also suddenly found he enjoyed tickling his sons, especially on the soles of their tights-covered feet. And when they were watching TV together, he would have one of the boys lie on the couch with his legs in Mr. Howard&#39;s lap so he could caress them while they watched. Francis found it quite relaxing.<br />
<br />
Brian, having little choice in the matter, soon settled into the new lifestyle that had been thrust upon him. Their house became a favorite hangout for Jase and Jeremy, since Mr. Howard was so supportive of their craft and took it so seriously. The four of them often practiced together. Brian realized it was kind of fun just to spend time with the older boys, and Mr. Howard thought he was luckiest guy on earth to have so many ballet boys in tights in his house all the time!<br />
<br />
The one most pleased with the outcome of the experiment was Kyle. He hadn&#39;t told Jeremy that he had already figured out how to manufacture nanobots (based on the ones extracted from his own BeC clothes) and had been doing so for some time. Using Jeremy&#39;s tights, he was able to find the code in the nanobots and adapt it for Mr. Howard. He didn&#39;t really care if Mr. Howard supported his son&#39;s hobby or not. He just wanted to test his nanobots on an adult, and they had worked perfectly. Now, he knew, he could make adults do anything he wanted...</p>
