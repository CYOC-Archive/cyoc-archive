<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;kinda my friend&quot; Kemo explained. after a bit of talking the two found themselves in similar yet different situations. while Milo and Melody merged into one their former mother and Kemo did not. instead, Catherine&#39;s mind was now a whisper that Kemo could sometimes here. he could also access her memories whenever he wished.  <br />
<br />
As they talked and discussed what had happened the house had continued becoming a castle. however, the medieval-looking castle soon ran into a problem. they were at the edge of a suburb. the forest behind was easy to alter so the castle could continue to grow. the front yard and back became the courtyard.  <br />
<br />
the hippo watched from the primary tower torrent as it soon began absorbing the neighborhood. the mason&#39;s next-door neighbors and their next-door neighbors were absorbed into the main castle. the families and couples inside or nearby clutched their heads. their bodies changing to match the fantasy world melody had dreamed. one such individual was Melody&#39;s next-door neighbor and friend Elisa.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Elisa was currently sleeping as well. She and Melody had a sleepover. in reality, they had an all-night gaming session with their friends. Wilson and Madison had left for their own houses earlier. while she was sleeping her house was absorbed into the Fireclaw castle.  <br />
<br />
a scent of chemicals woke her up. She was shocked to find herself in some kind of library. books stretching the 3 story room. a winding staircase led to the top. looking up she could see floating candles.  <br />
<br />
across from her looked like an alchemist&#39;s table. the smell of it was oddly enticing. however, once she got up she found she was butt naked. &quot;ah! okay, I know I slept in my pajamas last night,&quot; she said before noticing something else. The nails on her fingers and toes had turned black.  <br />
<br />
she watched as they became sharp claws and then retracted into her. this proved too much and she ran to where her door should have been. instead, only a blank wall made of stone bricks was there. As she did her body was slowly covered with white fur. black stripes began covering her as well.  <br />
<br />
She looked at her hands as they gained pads. &#39;wait this looks like Elixar&#39;s hands&#39; she thought as they grew. lean muscles soon filled out her form. &quot;if that&#39;s true then this is his room&quot; she said aloud as her voice deepened. her breasts sunk into her chest as his cock finished growing to its impressive 7 inches.  <br />
<br />
memories of Elixar became more vivid as his changes continued. he now knew that this room had been hidden from the undead king. As such only the correct phrase would open it. unfortunately, he was having trouble remembering as his body and mind changed. suddenly Elixar felt the need to lick his cock.  <br />
<br />
his mind filled with lust he dropped to the ground. his spine became as flexible as a contortionist. he then licked his cock as his tail grew. his tongue soon felt like sandpaper across his dick as his balls finally dropped into his furry sack. Finally, his face pushed out. his upper canines barely dropped past his lip.  <br />
<br />
his nose became triangular and blue. his cyan eyes watched as his &#39;scepter&#39; became erect. his once mid-back hair had shrunk into a short cyan mess on the top of his head. his ears flicked as he heard noises outside. after he cumed he rose. his transformation was somewhere in between Milo&#39;s and Kemo&#39;s in terms of time.  <br />
<br />
looking to his left he spied a wardrobe. he preferred to sleep in the nude so he put his outfit in there. he snapped his fingers and it opened. out came his outfit. brown leather wraps covered his feet and calves, he liked his toes exposed in case he needed his claws.  <br />
<br />
next blue pants covered his legs. his belt had several pockets on it for potions and ingredients. a sleeveless blue tunic covered his chest as he put on his leather sling. it was used to hold his scepter when he didn&#39;t need it. however, given what has transpired he might need it.  <br />
<br />
he let it float into his hand. he saw it was how he remembered/imagined it. it was a long black metal with a crescent shape horizontally. on its tip was the path stone. it was a mineral in Kanton that could increase a magic user&#39;s powers.  <br />
<br />
which is why the undead king had invaded the kingdom. he used his powers to put the rest of his clothes on instantly. leather armbands now hung to his biceps as armbands protected his arms. he then put on his hood and approached the door. blue magic escaped his hands as he spoke the phrase.  <br />
<br />
&quot;the Fireclaw family will live on&quot; he spoke with wisdom beyond his years. the stones dislodged from the wall to reveal a hallway. he soon found the ruckus he had heard earlier. thankfully it wasn&#39;t the undead king&#39;s army. instead, there were several butlers and maids going around.  <br />
<br />
some of these faces were familiar to him. sadly his Elisa side had fallen silent. he could access her memories though. he soon realized these were family and friends. a human butler looked a lot like Elisa&#39;s mother if she was born a man.  <br />
<br />
that would mean the griffin man was his father. a feral sphinx was walking around who looked similar to their cat Thomas. Sadly it would seem that the poor girl&#39;s family had befell a worse fate than he. A mind-reading spell showed they only remembered being what they are now. it was unclear if it was due to the distance from the source or that they weren&#39;t as developed in the game Elisa and her friends set up.  <br />
<br />
if he wasn&#39;t so wise then he would&#39;ve certainly been shocked to find his world was just a fantasy game. perhaps this was a silver lining. now he and others were in the land of reality. using his powers he sensed where the transformative magic was strongest. Thankfully he felt no presence of the undead king or his minions.   <br />
<br />
however, he could feel Elisa&#39;s neighborhood still changing. he decided to head to the kitchen. there he found his friends Kemo the dragon barbarian and Prince Milo talking to each other. &quot;so do you think the house finished changing or something else?&quot; Kemo asked the dragon prince. before he could speak he saw Elixar approaching from the doorway.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid it is not just one house now,&quot; he said approaching them. &quot;Elixar you&#39;re here too,&quot; Milo asked unsure who the tiger sorcerer was before. with his powers he could see who the two had been before. &quot;it seems you and I were friends having a sleepover&quot; he said making Milo gasp and Kemo lift an eyebrow. &quot;Elisa? is that you&quot; he asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;yes and no. I have elisa&#39;a memories but sadly her voice has died out within my mind. hopefully, I can bring her back and we can be like you&quot; Elixar said while pulling his hood down. &quot;um, what did you mean earlier by &#39;not just one house&#39;,&quot; Kemo asked. &quot;Elisa&#39;s old house has become one with the castle as well as others. those within have become servants ranging from butlers and maids to mythical pets&quot; the young mage said.  <br />
<br />
Milo would have paled at the moment if he could. instead, his face showed worry. &quot;do they remember?&quot; he asked. shaking his head Elixar sighed &quot;It would seem their memories have been wiped. They only remember being servants of the castle. Be thankful that your mother was chosen for such a pivotal role. Otherwise, she too might have been wiped.&quot; as the sorcerer spoke they heard a knock on the door.  <br />
<br />
A Cyclops man and llama woman came in wearing chief outfits. &quot;our apologies my lord. however, we need to make lunch&quot; the llama woman apologized. &quot;perhaps we shall go elsewhere to continue our chat,&quot; Elixar said as they left. True to his word the castle had taken up several good acres of land.  <br />
<br />
They were now in the courtyard. Kemo could finally reach his full height. &quot;so Elixar any idea how this happened?&quot; he asked as he stretched. suddenly Elixar shot a blast of magic at the main tower&#39;s turret. the hippo man was unaware that he had been spotted.  <br />
<br />
as such he was struck from the turret and fell almost to the ground. the three watched as he disappeared. &quot;I&#39;m afraid that necklace it had was the cause,&quot; he said as the others looked at him. summoning a large red book he opened it. &quot;thankfully he unknowingly let it show up in your dream&quot; he said as he found the page he was looking for.  <br />
<br />
&quot;the dream weaver. a dream catcher with the ability to turn dreams into reality. no matter how weird.&quot; he made the book vanish as he sighed. &quot;Unfortunately I can tell it had been used before&quot;. &quot;how could you know that,&quot; Milo asked looking at the courtyard. humans anthros and mythical creatures were going about their day unaware of the change in the neighborhood.  <br />
<br />
&quot;because he is made of pure dream magic. No doubt whoever dreamed of him was also the owner of it&quot; Elixar said as he began heading to the castle wall. the two dragons followed him to the top of the wall. they soon saw what was left of the neighborhood. to their left was a bridge that headed to an outlook.  <br />
<br />
the undead king had made it an entrance to the mines. directly ahead of them was a bridge. Milo saw the ground sink into the water as a river began to form. on the wall across from the mine entrance was a huge lake. the final wall had another river that merged with the one in front of them a little ways off.  <br />
<br />
They saw the guard tower at the edge of the bridge forming.  the entire neighborhood had become Fireclaw Castle. now everyone within it was a citizen of  Kanton. these ranged from peasants to knights. the prince knew that they also ranged in species and gender.  <br />
<br />
from a human female to a male Minotaur to even a herm wolf. &quot;what of Claire if we are here and the castle is too then what about her&quot; Milo asked. &quot;she has yet to surface. We shall see who she comes from&quot; Elixar said.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
in the reflection of the water the hippo man hid. he had no idea he could be harmed. he was lucky to get to a reflection so fast. &quot;htaed ni nuf on si ereht .luferac erom eb ot deen lliw I mees dluow ti&quot; he said as he rubbed his burned chest hair.</p>
