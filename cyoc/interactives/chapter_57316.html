<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I think we should make camp elsewhere,&quot; Nausikaa said with a little smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I agree,&quot; Semele said looking around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Dike it looks like we'll be camping someplace else,&quot; I said nodding. I turned and <br />
started walking with my sisters following me.<br />
<br />
We walked for ten minutes when we came upon a clearing and we began setting up <br />
camp. It didn't take us long to set up the tent and dig a fire pit so within an hour we <br />
had a fire going and food cooking. I still felt like there was something strange here and <br />
looking up at the sky again it didn't look like the moon had moved. Maybe I was <br />
getting a little paranoid but I didn't like that. As soon as we finished eating I looked at <br />
my sisters and said, &quot;We should get some sleep. I'll take the first watch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The first watch?&quot; Semele asked looking confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;One of us stays awake for a set time while the others sleep so we're not taken by <br />
surprise by a monster or someone,&quot; I explained. &quot;When your watch is over you wake <br />
the next person up and go to sleep yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't need to do that,&quot; Nausikaa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember that we're not safe here,&quot; I said shaking my head. &quot;If we're all asleep a <br />
monster could come and kill us all with no warning. This way we'll have at least some <br />
warning if a monster comes. Now get in the tent and get some sleep. I'll wake you up <br />
in three hours Nausikaa then you'll wake Dike up three hours later and finally Dike will <br />
wake Semele up after her three hour watch. Semele will wake us all up after her three <br />
hours. This will give each of us a total of nine hours sleep.&quot;&nbsp;With a little grumbling my <br />
sisters went into the tent to sleep. Nothing happened on my watch except for the moon <br />
remaining where it had been. At least we had a watch so we knew what time it was. It <br />
was with some relief that I woke Nausikaa up for her watch since the quiet was starting <br />
to make me drowsy. I could only hope that my sisters would be able to stay awake. <br />
After changing into a nightgown I slipped into my sleeping bag and was soon asleep.<br />
<br />
My dream started with me and my sisters on a train. The door to our compartment <br />
opened revealing a young girl standing there with a look of surprise on her face. &quot;I'm <br />
sorry but there seems to be some sort of mistake,&quot; she finally said. &quot;I was assigned to <br />
this compartment but it looks like it's already full.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's your name?&quot; I asked the girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Helen King,&quot; the girl said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well hello Helen,&quot; I said with a smile. &quot;You're in the right place. We were told that <br />
we'd have someone else with us for the night. I'm Lisa Plunkett and these are my <br />
sisters Nancy Boone, Bai Kwan, and Sara Slade.&quot; I pointed to Nausikaa, Dike, and <br />
Semele in turn.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't have the same last name and Bai's name sounds oriental,&quot; Helen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Bai's mom is Chinese,&quot; I said. &quot;We're actually half sisters. Our dad only knew our <br />
mom for one night each and left them with us. Our moms never knew what our dad's <br />
last name was so we took or stepdad's last names.&quot;<br />
<br />
The scene grew dark and then we were in some sort of great hall with floating candles. <br />
Somehow I knew that this was Salem's Witch Academy though there were wizards <br />
here too. I looked around to see Nausikaa and Dike sitting at a table. There was a <br />
stern looking guy holding a pointed hat behind a stool. Looking at a piece of <br />
parchment he called out, &quot;Katrina McCusker.&quot; A girl walked forward looking nervous <br />
and sat on the stool. When I saw her my pearl vibrated against my skin and I knew <br />
she had been transformed.<br />
<br />
As the hat is lowered onto Katrina's head the dream shifts again. I was now standing <br />
in an office facing a stern looking woman. I was standing with Katrina, Helen, who <br />
looked nervous and a boy that looked really smug. I knew that he wasn't in our house <br />
and that there was a little animosity between the two houses. &quot;There's no reason to be <br />
roaming around the school at night without permission and being in the restricted <br />
section of the library,&quot; the woman said. &quot;The restricted section is dangerous enough to <br />
the teachers let alone first years. All four of you will have a weeks worth of detention <br />
and your houses will lose one hundred points for each of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The dream dissolved and I became aware of Semele shaking me and saying, &quot;Wake <br />
up Anthea.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What time is it?&quot; I asked opening my eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it's seven but it's still dark outside and the moon is still overhead,&quot; Semele said.<br />
<br />
I sighed and got up. I had figured that it would still be dark but it was disappointing to <br />
know that I was right. Once we were all dressed we left the tent only to find ourselves <br />
in a bedroom. The bed didn't look like it had been slept in but there were girl's clothes <br />
on the floor. Then I noticed there was something on the bed. Approaching it Nausikaa <br />
asked, &quot;Is that what I think it is?&quot;<br />
<br />
I picked the medallion up and nodding said, &quot;I believe it is. This has to be the <br />
Medallion of Zulo. At least it won't transform us, I hope.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then we heard a man's voice ask, &quot;Who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
I dropped the medallion back on the bed and quickly turn around tapping my bracelet <br />
as I do. The silver disk grew into a shield and straps wrapped around my arm and the <br />
palm of my hand. Out of the corner of my I saw that Nausikaa had drawn her sword, <br />
Dike had drawn her dagger, and Semele had drawn her bow and arrow. I reached for <br />
my sword as I completed my turn and saw a man and woman standing in the door. <br />
Both of them looked frightened and before my sisters could do anything else I called <br />
out, &quot;Hold,&quot; and took my hand off my sword. I then tapped my shield and it shrank <br />
back down to my bracelet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you girls and what did you do with my daughter?&quot; the woman asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have done nothing with your daughter,&quot; I said keeping my voice non-<br />
confrontational. &quot;As to who we are I am Lisa Plunkett and these are my sisters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you here?&quot; the man asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;To be truthful I don't know why we're here,&quot; I said sighing. &quot;We were in a tent and <br />
when we left we were surprised to find ourselves here. Perhaps we're here to help find <br />
your daughter. Could you tell us what happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We may think about it if you put those weapons away,&quot; the man said. &quot;You girls <br />
shouldn't playing with them anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I assure you we are not playing with weapons,&quot; I said and then nodded to my sisters. <br />
They reluctantly put their weapons away and the man motioned for us to follow him. I <br />
grabbed the medallion and my bag and followed after them.<br />
<br />
They led us to the kitchen and the woman said, &quot;Sit down and I'll tell you.&quot; After we <br />
had sat down she continued, &quot;She went to her friends house yesterday to stay the <br />
night with her friend. She woke up this morning to find my daughter gone which isn't <br />
like her. Poor Aimee is beside herself with worry and wondering if she did something <br />
wrong. What happened to her? Did she run away?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I may have an idea,&quot; I said then showed them the medallion. &quot;Have either of you seen <br />
this before?&quot; When they shook their heads I continued, &quot;It may be that your daughter <br />
has been transformed and she left out of fear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can't be serious,&quot; the man said. &quot;My daughter couldn't have been transformed <br />
because it's impossible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You saw my bracelet become a shield then a bracelet again,&quot; I said looking the man <br />
square in the eyes.<br />
<br />
The man looked away and said, &quot;Well yes I did and I can't explain it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's magic,&quot; I said sighing. &quot;This medallion is also magic and has the power to <br />
transform someone when they touch it to an article of clothing. Did either of you see <br />
any clothes that didn't belong to your daughter?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I was hanging up some of her clothes when I noticed an Army jacket in her <br />
closet,&quot; the woman said. &quot;I thought that she may have a boyfriend and he had given it <br />
to her.&quot;<br />
<br />
I thought for a bit then said, &quot;It may be possible that your daughter came home for <br />
something last night. That something may have been in one of the pockets of the <br />
jacket but when she reached into one pocket she touched the medallion and it <br />
transformed her. The clothes she was wearing probably didn't fit so she took them off <br />
and seeing that she had been transformed she pulled the jacket and maybe some <br />
pajamas on then went to find the guy who gave her the jacket hoping he would have <br />
some answers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do we do?&quot; the woman asked. &quot;We can't call the police and tell them that <br />
our daughter was transformed. They wouldn't believe us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's true,&quot; I said nodding. &quot;You can call them and report your daughter missing. <br />
They won't find her if she has been transformed but it's all you can do. We can look for <br />
her and reverse the transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can you do that?&quot; the man asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;With these pearls,&quot; I said showing them my necklace. &quot;We each have one and they <br />
can reverse transformations. They can also sense someone who has been <br />
transformed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You girls shouldn't go out by yourselves,&quot; the man said shaking his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll be alright,&quot; I said smiling. &quot;We have some power from our father.&quot; I concentrated <br />
on the water in the glass before me and felt the tug as it began to swirl around. Soon <br />
there was a tube of water swirling up out of the glass. I let it go back down and settle <br />
before I said, &quot;Our father is Poseidon, god of the sea.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you girls will at least stay to eat?&quot; the woman asked.<br />
<br />
