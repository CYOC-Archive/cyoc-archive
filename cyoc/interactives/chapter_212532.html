<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kate pushed a still wet Larry back into the bedroom. Jacob looked over and saw the now naked duo coming toward the bed, and Kate was not happy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get your fat ass in there and let Jacob work his magic,&quot; Kate sternly told Larry.<br />
<br />
Larry slowly crawled onto the bed, looking at Jacob. Jacob sat up, sighed deeply, then raised his head, eyes closed as his body liquified, and he felt Larry crawl into him. Jacob pushed against Larry&#39;s lips nose as he gently forced and grew a few breathing tentacles deep into Larry&#39;s chest. Jacob did not waste time in penetrating and working deep into Larry&#39;s mammary glands, working to grow their size and capacity, as well as deep into Larry&#39;s urethra, flowing out from his bladder into his prostate and eventually his testicles. Larry finished off by joining with his remnants already in Larry&#39;s ass to work on massaging Larry&#39;s prostate.<br />
<br />
Kate was angry and frustrated as she said aloud, &quot;The son of a bitch could not take anything I had, and wanted to fuck my ass with his tiny shit. No. No fucking way. He wants to fuck me, then he needs to be worthy, physically. I can&#39;t enjoy that little prick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob thought, &quot;I got this dear. Come join us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kate sighed and said, &quot;Not yet, I&#39;m going to eat and when I get done I&#39;ll be back and I&#39;ll feed you, we both know he can&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob knew physical changes required a lot of energy on a cellular level, and Jacob knew he would not have enough fat to work with to get Larry to Kate&#39;s desired condition, but maybe three quarters. Oral changes would have to wait, but he could get Larry&#39;s ass, cock, tits, and body shape ready. His face and head would have to wait. Jacob felt a strong urge to change Larry into a carbon copy of Kate, so much so the liquid blob was throbbing on the bed as Jacob was already hard at the task of fixing his friend to be his second husband.<br />
<br />
Kate reentered the bedroom just after 10pm and sat down on the edge of the bed. She looked at Jacob in his blob form, knowing Larry&#39;s fat ass was inside there.<br />
<br />
Jacob thought inside Kate&#39;s head, &quot;I&#39;ll have enough to get him more than halfway, maybe three-quarters. Breasts, balls, cock, and ass in that order.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can  he have a different cock than mine? Say a horse cock with a knot? Something that will feel good for us and him, but will keep him from fucking anyone else?&quot; thought Kate in hir own head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea, that fixes a few things going forward. No need to suggest that he defer to you, it&#39;s already there in a big way,&quot; Jacob thought in Kate&#39;s mind.<br />
<br />
Kate said aloud, &quot;I know. He doesn&#39;t want power in the relationship, just to belong. I don&#39;t have a problem with that. And when he goes asserting himself, I will deal with him directly if I feel the need.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob was amused by Kate&#39;s verbal words, &quot;Your the boss dear.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kate reached over and did hir best to pinch the closest part of Jacobs form she could reach, &quot;No dear, we share that role. Just be glad your not where I can pinch you. I have the memories of the last time Larry was with us in this reality. We have to do better this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob formed a cavity for Kate, hir tentacle mask for breathing hanging at the end.<br />
<br />
Kate sighed, saying aloud, &quot;I&#39;m not full yet, but it&#39;s been a long day. I&#39;ll take it dear.&quot; Kate crawled into Jacob&#39;s open cavity and took the breathing tentacle into hir mouth, letting it seal and  hir throat relax as felt the cavity close around hir and hir cock and ass slowly invaded by Jacobs other tendrils. Kate was out in a deep sleep in just a few moments, and Jacob got his slow feeds of Kate&#39;s milk and cum going, then returned his focus on managing Larry&#39;s physical changes. Jacob enjoyed how Kate&#39;s hard cock poked between hir breasts, and Larry&#39;s would too. Jacob was already having some issues with Larry&#39;s older body taking more energy to change. Jacob had to take it slower with Larry. It would be after midnight when Jacob had Larry&#39;s cock mostly equine in structure and shape. The canine knot was proving to be tricky, so Jacob had to get a bit creative. Equine sheath, human base, canine knot, and rest was a hybrid human/equine structure with a fully equine head and glans. Jacob also realized that DD&#39;s were as big as he could grow Larry&#39;s chest in one night, so he focused on milk production. Larry would need several milking sessions or he would just leak from his nipples. Jacob was able to add some equine elements to Larry&#39;s ass and add the ability for Larry&#39;s colon and rectum to produce lubricant like Kate can. Jacob was careful with Larry&#39;s pelvis, and  was able to separate it into several pieces then add some of his form to help keep things in position until Larry&#39;s own bone filled in the gaps. Jacob loved Kate&#39;s female form, and wanted Larry to mirror that, and a female pelvis was a start. Jacob wanted to do more, but Larry&#39;s body limited the pace of the change.<br />
<br />
Kate awoke outside of Jacob, but hir chest was still connected. As soon as Jacob felt Kate wake up, he was pulling himself out of hir nipple ducts as fast as he could without making Kate uncomfortable. Kate looked over and saw Jacob was still oversized, with Larry still inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still baking?&quot; Kate thought in hir head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea, his age limits how fast and what I can do. I&#39;ll be a week or so on the major changes, but I&#39;m about halfway with the big changes.&quot; Jacob thought in Kate&#39;s head, then added, &quot;I&#39;ll need your help with him today. He will be sore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kate sat up in the bed as Jacob started to slide away from Larry. Kate saw for the first time some of the physical changes, and the bruising around his cock sheath and hips. Larry&#39;s breasts look stretched and unnatural, and his skin was quite loose as Larry&#39;s body used a lot of fat and some muscle during the overnight changes. Jacob removed the breathing mass from Larry&#39;s throat and nose, then continued to move further away from a sleeping Larry. Jacob was slow to take form to preserve his on energy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow....that&#39;s one way to have weight loss,&quot; Kate said aloud.<br />
<br />
&quot;Best I could do considering his age and time. He will clean up good, but it will take a little bit. He&#39;s committed,&quot; Jacob said weakly.<br />
<br />
Kate studied Larry&#39;s groin and said, &quot;Still too small for me. Good call on the shape. I like the equine flared tip.&quot; Kate got close to Larry&#39;s flaccid cock and licked the tip slowly. Kate was licking Larry&#39;s tip when she could taste his glans producing some lube. Kate liked the taste and continued as Larry&#39;s cock hardened. Kate found that the opening in the tip was sensitive and led to Larry waking up, and that&#39;s when Kate stopped.  Kate put hir hand on Larry&#39;s shoulder, and commanded, &quot;Stay still, you will be a little sore. Move slow and don&#39;t force it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Larry was slow, with Kate helping him move to the edge of the bed. Larry&#39;s body was pushing back with pain limiting his range and speed of movement. &quot;I feel like I lost a fight. Damn. This is how you treat guests,&quot; Larry said aloud, trying to smile.<br />
<br />
Jacob and Kate took several minutes to help Larry up and to the bathroom, stopping by a mirror on the way for Larry to see the progress so far. Larry had no need for the toilet, but a shower was in order for the threesome. A clean Larry was then helped to the kitchen where he sat in a chair as Kate prepared a breakfast for three, since Larry said he was hungry enough for two.</p>
