<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jessica had realized the power of the device, even if he failed to notice that he had been changed by it. Now he had an idea that he really wanted to try.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don't you go first?&quot; Jessica offered, hoping that his plan would work.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Melissa said, &quot;Just let me go to the bathroom and wash up first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, I'll wait for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
As soon as Melissa was out the door Jessica was on the computer. Since he still thought of himself as a girl, he was upset about Brian having dumped him earlier in the week. He had really thought it would work out between him and Brian, but now he had the opportunity to get the perfect boyfriend.<br />
<br />
Jessica pulled up Melissa's information and went to work. The first thing he did was set her gender to male and selected that reality would adjust. As he was doing this he noted that one of the options selected had Melissa set as being 15% tiger. Feeling daring he set it up to 50% and again set reality to adjust. He figured that it would be great to snuggle up against a big, furry tiger man. In his haste to get in all the changes he wanted, he forget to turn off Melissa's awareness of the changes.<br />
<br />
Then he went to mental changes to be sure that Melissa would keep human intelligence and personality. He also set it that Melissa would be very loyal and would love to snuggle just as much as he did, because what was the point of having a tiger man for a boyfriend if you couldn't cuddle with him? He set it so that Melissa would begin to experience feelings of love towards him.<br />
<br />
Before he had the chance to change anything else, his sensitive feline ears picked up the sound of her footsteps in the hall. He set the changes to happen instantly, saved them and closed out of the program so that Melissa wouldn't suspect that he had done anything, unaware that due to his failure to turn off her awareness, she would know exactly what he had done.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
At the door to her friend's room Melissa felt a strange sensation overtake her. When it passed she looked down at herself, her muzzle twisting into a smile. Jessica had used the Chronivac to change things while she was out of the room. She was now much more tiger-like to the point where it was almost hard to walk upright. Her fingers were much shorter, especially her thumbs, making it hard to grab on to the doorknob. As she attempted to manipulate it her claws extended, a full two inches long. On the bright side, she had a full coat of striped fur, something that she might see about keeping after she changed the rest of herself back. Another interesting detail was that she was no longer wearing a tee shirt and sweat pants, instead she was shirtless and clad in nothing but boxers, which did little to hide her feline sheath which stuck out a full four inches above the waistline of her boxers.<br />
<br />
So, Jessica had decided to make her a tiger man? Interesting, but why?<br />
<br />
Giving up on opening the door for herself, she knocked on the door with a massive paw, &quot;Open the door.&quot;<br />
<br />
She was shocked by the sound of her voice, more of a roar than anything. Deep and powerful, but also barely human. Jessica had made her a lot more feline than she had made Jessica.<br />
<br />
Just as she was about to try speaking again, Jessica opened the door and looked up at her.<br />
<br />
For the first time Melissa realized just how massive she had become. When she had left the room Jessica had been at least six inches taller than her, now she was more than a foot taller than him.<br />
<br />
Putting her paws on her hips she got ready to scold her friend, only to have him give her a hug. To her surprise she found herself returning the hug, practically lifting the smaller jaguar man off his feet. Something about the way Jessica was acting struck her as endearing.<br />
<br />
When Jessica pulled back from the embrace, Melissa shook her head, &quot;Silly.&quot;<br />
<br />
She would have said more, but talking was so difficult and her voice so loud that she figured it was best for her to limit speaking to one word at a time until she got the chance to adjust things.<br />
<br />
Jessica jumped onto the bed and rolled over onto his back, twitching his tail excitedly, &quot;Pet me please.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Melissa looked at Jessica, she noticed how attractive he was as a leopard man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; she growled, climbing on the bed next to him. The bed creaked under her weight.<br />
<br />
Melissa began to rub the soft fur of her friend's stomach, causing Jessica to close his eyes in ecstasy, &quot;You're so nice to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
For some reason this delighted Melissa, she wanted Jessica to be happy. Maybe she would stay as a tiger man a bit longer if Jessica liked it so much.<br />
<br />
Growling with delight, Jessica climbed onto Melissa's lap and rubbed his head against her chest. Then, without warning he brought his muzzle up up to hers in a kiss. Not even thinking Melissa returned the gesture, pressing her friend up against her.<br />
<br />
A stirring from between her legs reminded her that she was no longer a girl, but she didn't care all that much any more. If it meant that she could cuddle with Jessica like this she had no problem being a tiger man.</p>
