<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a simple thing, to change.  Odette found the desire to do so everyday.  From that first night with Jimmy she had gone further and further.  Like a little girl plays with clothing or a young teen playing with makeup, Odette found her whole body a simple fashion accessory.  Choosing her breast size for the day was just as crucial to her image as the colour of her top.  The length of her leg would help or hinder the look of her skirt.  She could change her shoulder's width, her arm thickness.  The curve of her neck was something to go with the high collar top or not.  In short getting ready for the day was taking longer and longer.<br />
<br />
A few weeks passed and her routine became all too difficult.  Odette would wake at seven and get clean in the shower.  By seven-thirty she would have picked out her clothes but that was just the start.  What followed was often a difficult race against the quickly distracting power of her curse.  First the body: legs and feet; then hips and waist; fix the arms and make the hands more delicate; then the shoulders and neck; finally the breasts, bigger or smaller, rounder or not, firm and perky.  She would turn her Loki-given body into something new and altogether much better.<br />
<br />
Next she would lean in close to the mirror and fix her face.  Make-up was no longer necessary but that was the least of the benefits.  Her entire face was open for manipulation.  The nose was often the first thing to change.  Smaller and more narrow.  The cheeks were coloured then and shaped.  The lips could be puffed or not, the chin changed to be better.  Sometimes she changed her eyes.  The colour was something that could be matched to anything she wanted.  By the time she was done it was difficult to see how she could have been what she was before.  If she was particularly resistant to the tingles and the warmth of the change, she would do her hair.  The important parts was the length and the colour.  Everything else she could do the old fashioned way; with pins and spray.<br />
<br />
Her clothing could be changed a little.  It was only the first layer of clothing that she had any control over.  Any piece of cloth that was completely in contact with her skin was subject to change.  Size and shape was available for modification to fit her body that was often in a state of flux.  This made it easier for Odette to find a top that fit.  But like her body there was a catch.  She found that if she took the clothing off before she fell asleep then the clothing would remain the way it was and would not revert to normal.  It would, however, do so the next next time she wore it during nap time.  Odette had found it desirable to shop for many new pieces of clothing for raw material.<br />
<br />
By nine she would be at her limit.  Unable to resist any more she would find herself twitching and rubbing her body all over.  She would become too horny to be able to concentrate on any further changes.  If everything had gone correctly then she would be perfect for the day.  A whole new Odette, from head to toe.  The only problem was that it would not last and she would have to do it all again tomorrow.<br />
<br />
But while it lasted her boyfriend could not keep her hands off her.  Jimmy came by each day to see her.  He was pleasantly surprised every time to find Odette a little better.  She liked to tantalize him with a new hair colour or a little more up top.  He would arrive around lunch and the two would spend an hour exploring each other.  Jimmy would have the pleasure of inspecting her whole body with both his eyes and his hands.  Jimmy was delighted but there was something that was nagging at his mind.  Jim, did not know why she stayed with him.  Odette could look like anything she wanted.  She could have any guy she wanted.  It would be a simple thing to just dump Jimmy and find someone better.  What did he mean to Odette, now that she could be far out of his league?<br />
<br />
On this particular day, about three weeks after the prom, Jimmy arrived at Odette's home to find her in a bit of disarray.  Her waist was shrunken to minuscule size.  This was made all the more noticeable by the wide hips large rear end and balloon like breasts.  Her legs seemed longer to; the increased length seemed to take up two thirds of her total body length.  This put her nipples right around Jimmy's chin.  And the accompanying cleavage forced his eyes to be constantly drawn away from her face.  Which was a good thing.  Her lips were bee-stung and deeply red.  Her cheek bones had been strengthened until they stuck out too far.  Her nose seemed far too small and her hair a little bit too yellow.  And she was dressed in a bikini-like underwear set that shimmered when she moved but did little to cover the fact that she looked like a misshaped character of a voluptuous woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't look at me, Jimmy!&quot;  She cried tears streaming down her face.  &quot;I look like a freak.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;  Jimmy said trying very hard to look anywhere but at her tits while trying to sound consoling.  &quot;You don't look that bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I look terrible!  Maybe you should just go home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait! O, listen just calm down a little and let me know what happened.&quot;  His arm was around her shoulders and he steared her as best her could to a seat.  Once there he sat down next to her and tried to get her to calm down.  It also helped that he could not look her directly in the face  at this moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just wanted to try something big for you today.&quot;  She sniffled and it was high-pitched and whistled a little.  &quot;I was trying to make myself into all your favorites.  Big breasts, tiny waist, long legs.  Everything.  But I just could not get it right.  I would change one thing but then something else would look wrong.  So, I changed that and it wouldn't work with the other things.  Then suddenly I had to stop and now look at me.  I'm ugly.&quot;  The she sobbed.<br />
<br />
After a moment, Jimmy had to say something.  &quot;You didn't have to do this for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I wanted to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?  I've liked everything that you've done already.  Why did you have to try and put everything together?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted to turn you on.  I wanted to be the sexiest thing you have ever seen.  But it just didn't work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Odette,&quot;  Jimmy said choosing his words carefully, &quot;you are sexy to me.  Not right now, but I liked you before you could change and I like everything that you do.  It's great that you want to experiment.  But you may have to get used to a few mistakes.  It's not like you are stuck.  Just relax and take a nap.&quot;<br />
<br />
She sniffled for a little while longer thinking over what he had said.  &quot;The thing is that I just don't want to make mistakes.  I can't go out like this.  And I won't always be able to take a nap whenever I want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's true, but if you get used to being able to go to sleep for a little bit it might be easier for you to do so if you get stuck.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But, that doesn't help right now, Jimmy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure it does.  Listen why don't you take a nap.  Just relax and try to sleep and then we will think of something to make things right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Odette was tired from her cry, and lay down easily.  Jimmy left her and went to the basement to watch TV.  About and hour later Odette joined him, in her normal form, looking better.  She still wore the shimmering bikini-thing with the hot-pants bottom.  To Jimmy she was perfect; slim, tanned, and she still sported the pinched middle that Loki had given her.  She snuggled up close to Jim gave him a long kiss as thanks for his strength and calmness.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I have a solution for you,&quot; he said.</p>
