<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lucile had awakened very early and she had been looking for some help on internet. She thought that sending an email to the people who sended her the pills will give her some solutions. But she received no response. She was frustrated, her last option was to go where that mysterious Company was located but that implied to left his son and his cousin alone. She can&#39;t do that at any cost but her time was running out. She started to send a lot of email to press a response, but it didn&#39;t make any difference. She was giving up, her son should be awaken and he should have noticed his body alteration.<br />
The only thing Lucile  could do right now was to look at the kids by using the camera. So, she opened the camera program on the pc. She saw her son was awaken as she assumed, but her nephew, Jimmy was still sleeping.<br />
&quot;Just like Raul yesterday...&quot; Lucile whispered. Then she decided to go to look for her son and trying to explain him what happened to his body. &quot;Maybe, he will understand.&quot;<br />
Lucile printed some articles about puberty and erectil dysfunction that could help her to explain it better. Also, she printed some naked men photos with the purpose to give him some contrast with real men and how he wasn&#39;t too different from another people, although she knew he was as gifted as a male pornstar and no regular men.<br />
When she went off her room, she saw that Raul&#39;s friends had already discovered him and they quickly hid on the bathroom.<br />
&quot;Oh, no!&quot; Lucile thought. &quot;How will I confess to my son without those kid knowing? They could tell to their parents and I will be seen as a terrible mother to everybody.&quot;<br />
Lucile ruled out the possibility to tell her son the truth. Instead, she went to look for her nephew and how he was doing. When she entered the room, she saw he was naked, but she wasn&#39;t able to look more than his little and cute butt, because was upside down. She sighed of relief. &quot;Thank god, he hasn&#39;t awaken!&quot;<br />
Then she remembered that her sister had told her Jimmy used to pee while he was sleeping. She quietly went to the bed and she saw that the blankets were wet. &quot;Oh, poor baby. You are 10, but you still act like a toddler...&quot;<br />
Lucile took the blankets and she inspected them. Some yellow spots could be seen in them, but also another fluid was there.<br />
&quot;What is this?&quot; Lucile thought and she sniffed the blanket a little. &quot;Ugh, I think it&#39;s precum! Gross!&quot; Lucile thought. &quot;I don&#39;t think little Jimmy could be able to produce precum, so this thing should come from Raul...&quot;<br />
Lucile left the room and went to the washing machine. She put the blankets and then she returned to her room. When she was closing her door, she Heard that boys were out of the bathroom. Some yells can be heard from them, she heard a deep voice between them, but she didn&#39;t care about it.<br />
Back to her pc, she saw a new email from the pills company. She leaped of joy and read it.<br />
<br />
Dear mrs. L<br />
We sorry to read what happened to your son and we apologize because we don&#39;t have a solution to your situation.<br />
Our main focus and test subjects are men over 40 years old, so we don&#39;t have any information or treatment that could<br />
be helpful to you. In fact, we warn you to keep your son away from other kids around his age, because the excess of testosterone his body is producing and can&#39;t be holded inside of him could affect the metabolism of any other boy.<br />
The only aid we can offer to you is to bring him to our facilities and we can analyze his body with the hope of finding some cure, but we can&#39;t guarantee any favorable result.<br />
If you&#39;re disposed to keep the medication, we can expect he would develop a body almost as normal as regular men. But he won&#39;t be back to his childhood body again.<br />
We want to know your decision. So send us an email when you had made one.<br />
Sincerely, XXX.<br />
<br />
Lucile was more worried than before. They can&#39;t help his son and the only way to make him look normal is to continue with process and turn him in a man. She can&#39;t do that to her son, it was like taking away his childhood, his innocence, his friends... His friends! They were in contact with Raul since a few and Jimmy had slept with him all night. What had happened to them? Lucile thought. &quot;Jimmy took a pill and he was with Raul all night. What will be the effect of that?&quot; She must see her son right now!</p>
