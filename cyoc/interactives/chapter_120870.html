<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Coffee?&quot; Steve asked, almost sounding confused. &quot;Fuck that! The only thing I want in my mouth is you!&quot; he added vehemently. Steve stood up from his chair, still amazed by the hulking beast in front of him. He couldn&#39;t begin to understand how the short man from the bar several days earlier had been replaced by the tower of muscle that now stood next to the table. But Steve didn&#39;t care. At that moment, all he wanted was to be fucked by the glorious titan who seemed to fill the coffee shop with his size. <br />
<br />
Cole smirked down at his date, feeling his huge dick swell a bit in his too-small shorts. He bounced his jutting pecs again, enjoying the way Steve stared at them, the smaller man&#39;s jaw dropping open as he ogled the huge masses of moving muscle. Steve bit his lower lip, lust coursing through him. <br />
<br />
Cole chuckled. &quot;Let&#39;s get out of here. Before I start breaking some public indecency laws...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I live just around the corner!&quot; Steve added enthusiastically, a big grin on his face. Normally he was a smooth operator, a cool customer who wrapped his conquests around his finger and made them dance to his tune. But right then, with lust coursing through him, his wits addled by Cole&#39;s size and strength (and his musk), Steve was anything but his usual suave self. His excitement was obvious on his face. Still, he moved with fluid agility as he walked toward the exit of the coffee shop. Cole followed behind him, looking down, watching Steve&#39;s beautiful ass move in his tight jeans. The rounded glutes were perfect, and they made Cole&#39;s cock harden even more as he watched. <br />
<br />
The walked quickly down the street, crossed it, and finally arrived at Steve&#39;s townhouse. Cole was fully erect by then, his huge tool sicking out of one of the pant legs of his too-small shorts, the thick head and half the shaft visible to anyone who cared to look. Steve noticed immediately as he let the hulking muscleman into his home, his eyes widening as he gazed at the pulsating tool. <br />
<br />
Steve couldn&#39;t help himself. He fell to his knees in front of Cole, right in the living room. He reached out, running his hands up and down one enormous thigh. He leaned in as he stroked the giant mass of muscle, then kissed the tip of Cole&#39;s huge dick. His tongue snaked out and lapped at it, pressing against the spongy mushroom head. He was rewarded with a stream of pre that began to leak out of the slit. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aww fuck that&#39;s nice...&quot; Cole growled, reaching down with one of his large hands to massage the back of Steve&#39;s head and neck. Steve opened wide and pressed his face against Cole&#39;s giant leg, sucking on the big cockhead. Cole groaned loudly, his dick becoming harder, the seams of his shorts beginning to pop as the monster within struggled to free itself. Snarling, he reached down and tore his shorts and underwear off with one quick motion, the garments yielding instantly to his incredible strength. Finally unconstrained, his dick whipped upward, out of Steve&#39;s mouth, sending little droplets of pre and saliva into the air. Steve looked up in surprise. He breathed in sharply, awed by what he saw: two big round nuts filling Cole&#39;s sack, hanging below the biggest, longest, thickest dick he&#39;d ever seen. Steve groaned with lust, then pushed his face up against the underside of Cole&#39;s big cock. He rubbed himself against it, moaning softly as he felt its warm hardness against his cheek. <br />
<br />
Cole was going mad with lust. But he steeled himself, not yet ready to cum. He took several steps back, away from Steve. He brought up both huge arms and slowly flexed, his massive biceps rising at his command. Both sleeves of his tee shirt shredded, unable to contain Cole&#39;s giant arms, while his lats ripped through both sides of the shirt as well. Still on his knees, Steve could only stare in awe, his eyes wide and hungry. Cole smirked cockily, grabbed the neck of his shirt, and pulled. The garment didn&#39;t put up a fight as Cole ripped it right off of his body, finally unveiling every massive, bulging, sculpted inch to Steve. The smaller man gasped as he stared up at the enormous man who loomed over him. <br />
<br />
Cole stepped forward, bent down, and easily picked Steve up over the floor. He threw the man over one of his giant shoulders, then climbed up the stairs, heading for the bedroom. He gave Steve&#39;s beautiful ass a few exploratory squeezes on the way up and liked what he found: a firm, rounded, set of muscular glutes. When they arrived, he set Steve down on the bed, then began helping the smaller man undress. Together they pulled off Steve&#39;s clothes, flinging them to the floor. The bed creaked as Cole got onto it, but neither man paid much attention to that. Steve was too busy groping Cole&#39;s massive body, feeling up the bloated muscles that Cole obligingly flexed. The big man&#39;s musk washed over Steve, stripping away any reserve he had left. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck me! Please! You&#39;re so hot it&#39;s driving me crazy!&quot; Steve begged. <br />
<br />
Cole chuckled as he slathered lube over his dick, letting it mix with the pre he was still leaking. He spread Steve&#39;s legs, positioned himself, and then slowly pushed in. <br />
<br />
Steve&#39;s eyes went wide as he felt the thick cockhead enter him. He rarely bottomed, and certainly had never been fucked by anyone of Cole&#39;s size. He briefly wondered if he had just made the worst mistake of his life when Cole leaned over to kiss him. Steve melted into the kiss, his hands massaging Cole&#39;s big traps while the larger man&#39;s tongue pushed its way into Steve&#39;s mouth. He was so focused on kissing Cole back that he barely noticed his ass loosening up, stretching out to accommodate the large intrusion it was experiencing. Slowly Cole pushed forward, sliding more of his dick into Steve. The smaller man gasped, but what little pain he felt was outweighed by the incredible pleasure from being filled with such a big tool. <br />
<br />
&quot;You like that?&quot; Cole purred, pulling back just a bit, then pushing in further once more, deeper into Steve&#39;s ass. <br />
<br />
The smaller man gurgled happily. &quot;Oh fuck yeah!&quot; he panted, &quot;More!&quot; His hands caressed Cole&#39;s huge chest, exploring the bloated slabs of pectoral muscle. He found Cole&#39;s nipples and began to toy with them. The larger man grunted in response and began to thrust harder, faster. Steve&#39;s moans of ecstasy provided additional encouragement. Cole ramped up the power of his thrusts further, slamming his dick hard into Steve while the latter cried out with pleasure. There were no more words exchanged between them, only grunts and groans that got louder and louder as Cole fucked Steve hard, using the power of his huge new body. Finally the towering hulk came, roaring with pleasure as he unloaded a considerable volume of cum into Steve.</p>
