<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Josh leaned back in the very soft leather chair in one of the many reading areas within the massive archives of Heaven. His soon-to-be wife, Penemue as doing research and so was he. He had wrapped himself into the records of heaven trying to figure out who was who, since he was going to be a “member” of the royal court of heaven he better learn at least the general outline of the court of heaven. Maybe member of the court was stretching it, Penemue was God’s daughter and of royal blood, but she didn’t rule any of the cities like her sisters, brothers and the archangels however she was the official record keeper of the court. She was in every meeting of the court; she did all the research for God and the higher ups of the court.<br />
<br />
He was trying to study the entire break down of how many children of God there where and who they where all married to because they would soon be his in laws and related to him but trying to study the whole thing was giving him a headache.<br />
<br />
“Well Josh, are you having fun yet?” inquired a voice which caused him to almost cough up the cup of coffee he had just taken a drink from. He turned around to see a figure he recognizes standing on the other side of a small half wall.<br />
<br />
His blonde locks framed his perfect face, a face he had worried was trying to steal Penemue from him when he was on Earth. His impossible blue eyes seemed to be even brighter now and the four blue wings on his back was something that hadn’t been there when he met on Earth.<br />
<br />
“Charles?” inquired Josh in amazed confusion as the angel nodded his head. “You’re an angel too?”<br />
<br />
“Yep, ran into Penemue on Earth when she was dating you and since your up here now thought I would pop up to see how you’re handling everything?” inquired Charles as he flapped his wings and flew over the wall to take a seat across from Josh.<br />
<br />
“So, who are you on this massive list?” inquired Josh as he looked at the long list of names of God’s sons and daughters.<br />
<br />
“None.” confirmed Charles with a shrug of his broad shoulders. “I would call myself an honorary grandson of God, but I am Michael and Joan’s son.”<br />
<br />
“Oh.” confirmed Josh<br />
<br />
“Hence the name Charles, Mom named me after the French King when she was a human. No fancy court name for me. Mom won that fight with dad when I was born.” explained Charles with a smile “Truth be told I rather enjoy having my name be so “normal”. Makes whenever I go down to Earth much easier, don’t have to worry about a new name and all that stuff.”<br />
<br />
“I guess that makes sense.” Confirmed Josh as he paused. “Is Stacy….”<br />
<br />
“No, my girlfriend Stacy isn’t an angel, at least not yet.” confirmed Charles as he took a resigned sigh. “I am half tempted to propose to her, just to tell her that Penemue and you are alive. She is taking your “death” very hard.”<br />
<br />
“That is right, we died on Earth didn’t we?” inquired Josh<br />
<br />
“Yes, and you and your family is all the headlines on Earth and in Heaven and Hell.” Stated Charles “It isn’t often that a preacher firebombs his own kid’s apartment killing his whole family.”<br />
<br />
“What?” asked Josh confused.<br />
<br />
“God, was very upset that your father hit his daughter as you know so he decided to destroy his reputation.” Explained Charles “I am talking, having Angels fake an assault on camera of your father hitting your mother, Penny and you. Then it was rather simple to have an angel throw a firebomb into Maisy and Rachel’s apartment which you all happened to be in. Burned alive by your own father who is on the run being hunted by every police force in the nation. It’s headline news.”<br />
<br />
“And this was God’s idea?” inquired Josh<br />
<br />
“He can be very vindictive when he wants to be.” explained Charles “So how are you adjusting to everything.”<br />
<br />
“It’s something, they are talking a triple wedding in a couple of days and trying to understand all these relationships is going to be a nightmare.” Stated Josh<br />
<br />
“I know that.” Confirmed Charles “I stay the hell out of all that BS. Sometimes it is better to just be a piece on the board then a player.”<br />
<br />
“You’re the son of Archangel Michael and Joan of Arc, hard to believe you’re a piece on the board.” Countered Josh as Charles’s shrugged.<br />
<br />
“I am just a guard and a member of armies of Heaven.” Stated Charles, that made some sense to Josh, Charles was studying criminology back on Earth. “I just hope I stay a simple guard. Word from Hell is that there is a whole lot of political trouble brewing down there and when that happens you can be sure someone from Heaven is messing with it.”<br />
<br />
“What do you mean?” inquired Josh<br />
<br />
“Some people just want to get revenge for past crimes and wrongs.” explained Charles “There are some, mostly in the old guard, pretty much the upper officer core of heaven’s armies who actually want to restart the war.”<br />
<br />
“Is there really that big of a chance of war?” inquired Josh concerned.<br />
<br />
“Not so long as God is in command up here and Lucifer is in command down there.” confirmed Charles “The funny thing is, that most of the higher ups who want to fight the war the most didn’t actually fight in it last time. The biggest pusher, the High Inquisitor Kusheil handled internal security during the rebellion, never drew his sword my father said and from what my dad told me it is the same in hell. I think it’s the ruler of the 8th circle, Beelze…something was what you would call a supply officer and he is the biggest pusher for war in hell according to my dad. Those who have fought all agree that while the other side are SOBs they are respectable SOBs and would rather not have to fight again.”<br />
<br />
“I see.” Said Josh more concern then ever for his sister and mother down in hell. "Those who never have seen war, are the first to want to start one."<br />
<br />
“Very true, my biggest concern is that someone, like your father will somehow set off a war between Heaven and Hell.” Stated Charles “Those Iron Knights are pains…”<br />
<br />
“Looking back, I think my father was planning to have me join the Iron Knights.” admitted Josh “He wanted me to join some social circle of religious believers he was a member of.”<br />
<br />
“Likely your right, he wanted you to become the next generation of Iron Knights.” confirmed Charles “I am just glad you have wings on your back instead of darkness in your heart while claiming to do so in the name of God.”<br />
<br />
“So am I, even if I have to go get fitted for wedding cloths in a few hours.” Said Josh “Do angels wear suits? How does that work with wings?”<br />
<br />
“You will see.” Laughed Charles as he got up. “Well, I better get going Stacy thinks I am making a run for food, I need to get that before I portal home. I hate lying to her about your deaths.”<br />
<br />
“Haven’t you been dating her for 3 years now?” inquired Josh<br />
<br />
“Yes, I have the ring but I am waiting.” admitted Charles as he went on. “Stacy’s parents died when she was a kid, she only has an elderly grandmother alive now and I can’t part them. So I wait, as horrible as it sounds, once she decides to move on, I will tell Stacy who I really am.”<br />
<br />
“I hope she says yes, she and Penny…well Penemue really got along even if they are so different.” stated Josh. Back on Earth, his Penny had been the stereotypical book worm while Stacy was for the lack of a better term a hippie. The whole save the whales, stop eating meat and get arrested at every social justice protest she could get to type of hippie. The type of women who wasn’t afraid to speak her mind no matter who she was talking to.<br />
<br />
“So do I.” confirmed Charles as he opened a portal and Josh saw on the other end what appeared to be a shopping center parking lot. Charles step through transforming back into his human form before closing the portal.<br />
<br />
“Sometimes I wonder what I got myself into.” stated Josh as he went back to studying the family records of Heaven and Hell.</p>
