<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Julia had been waiting her whole life to see Joe again, but with the development of his simulated wife and daughter... She had too much to think about and she may as well talk to his family before chewing his ear off. &quot;So... Julia how about we talk?&quot; Julia asked. Sim Julia nodded and the two women walked into the booth together. It was a small room with just two chairs and a small table. Each Julia sat on either chair and then sat there for a little while. Sim Julia waiting to see what Earth Julia would say, and Earth Julia figuring out where to start. <br />
<br />
Julia asked &quot;So... how was your simulated Earth life?&quot; <br />
Sim Julia chuckled and said &quot;Well I know when it started, but before all that it seemed like... Well your life. I was a carbon copy, and a few years later we got married. A few years later after that we had Victoria out there. The little bundle of joy. Then a few years later Joe was shot and killed by a criminal... and that&#39;s where the simulation ended. It was very abrupt, I was preparing dinner and then we were with Ty who was explaining what happened. We were well off, never cheated on each other, and Victoria was a little too young to have had much of a life apart from us.&quot; <br />
Julia said &quot;That seems nice...&quot; a little unsatisfied with how her other self answered, but then again... what was she going to do watch her other self&#39;s life with Joe? <br />
Sim Julia said &quot;I mean if you are really curious why don&#39;t we ask Ty to let you watch the simulated life?&quot; <br />
&quot;Wait can we?&quot; <br />
&quot;I had asked Ty about it awhile ago. Here in heaven Joe would go and watch your life when Victoria and I were away, then I sneaked up on him and found what he was watching. At the time I had just thought I was raptured to spend time with a heaven beta tester, and wished my simulated world into a peaceful place of plenty. Although I had a sneaking suspicion something was up. That&#39;s when I saw you prayed your boobs to be... How big were they then?&quot; Sim Julia stretched her arms outward as far as she could reach to pantomime the size of the milk makers. <br />
Julia said &quot;Hey they were just G-cups and I shrank them down!&quot; <br />
Sim Julia having fun said &quot;I think Joe compared it to having a sweet milky cup of coffee and adding in sprinkles and marshmallows...&quot; Sim Julia looked at the blushing Julia and said &quot;At that point the both of us occasionally peaked into your life, and I have to say Joe does have an eye for YOU... Still we&#39;ve invaded your privacy so I figure it&#39;s fine that you could invade ours.&quot; A monitor appeared and started by showing Sim Julia eating an early dinner in her old apartment. <br />
Julia asked &quot;What are we watching?&quot; <br />
&quot;My memories on simulated earth. The moment Joe was brought to heaven we were eating, and that&#39;s essentially where I was born... Much how it never felt like that. Currently there was no difference between the two of us. That&#39;ll change in the evening when you get the call that Joe went missing and I didn&#39;t.&quot; A few minutes of mastication later and both Julia were getting a bit bored so Sim Julia said &quot;While we&#39;re doing this mind if I bring up our name thing?&quot; <br />
Julia asked &quot;What thing?&quot; <br />
&quot;Well we&#39;re both Julia, as you&#39;ll learn soon we&#39;ve got a lot in common, and I feel like if we&#39;re going to both want to be a part of Joe&#39;s life here in Heaven one of us should probably change their name. You want to or should I?&quot; <br />
Julia raised her eyebrow and asked &quot;Got any ideas for yourself?&quot; <br />
Sim Julia said &quot;When I was thinking of names for Victoria I found Cynthia, but Joe was the one to choose the name and promised me I could name the next one.&quot; <br />
&quot;Let me guess you never wanted another.&quot; <br />
&quot;Love the brat, but never again... So if you want to keep your name I feel like I&#39;d be fine going by Cynthia.&quot; <br />
&quot;Fine, Nice to meet you Cynthia.&quot; <br />
<br />
The two women ended up fast forwarding through to some highlights, they changed the chairs and table onto a couch and were lounging around together. Occasionally materializing some popcorn or the meatloaf their mother used to make. Sometimes they laughed, sometimes Julia had a lot of questions for Cynthia, and other times they were just left to think or just chat on occasion. The two were stretching while the monitor was displaying Cynthia washing her pregnant self in the shower.  Cynthia said &quot;I&#39;ve been having an odd thought... Aren&#39;t we kinda like sisters in a way?&quot; <br />
Julia asked &quot;In what way?&quot; <br />
&quot;Well, we&#39;re like Twins. Been together for basically all our early and a lot of our adult lives, inseparable, and we have a lot in common.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah... I remember about you talking about Joe comparing me to coffee... Maybe that rubbed off on you.&quot; <br />
&quot;Maybe... still though, assuming our relationship with Joe doesn&#39;t make things too complicated. Wouldn&#39;t you rather be friends? Then since we basically share the same memories of childhood, school, and whatnot... I don&#39;t know just think about it ok?&quot; <br />
&quot;I suppose I can at least think about it... now that I think about it couldn&#39;t I just get this information beamed into my... Do we still have brains? Like do I have a body still or?&quot; One short information beam later and Julia and Cynthia basically knew basically the same things. <br />
<br />
Julia asked &quot;So what exactly is different about us now?&quot; <br />
&quot;The knowledge of who we are.&quot; Cynthia replied &quot;Along with how our personalities were at least a little different when we started... So got all your curiosity about me out of your system?&quot; <br />
Julia said &quot;Mostly... the memories involving Victoria are a little fuzzy though...&quot; <br />
&quot;Well, I guess while me and Joe were peaking into your life... Victoria wasn&#39;t, and if you want knowledge about her you gotta ask her.&quot; <br />
&quot;Well... I said I&#39;d talk to Joe last so. I&#39;ll go meet her properly!&quot; <br />
&quot;Just remember she&#39;s my kid.&quot; <br />
&quot;Sure sure Cynthia, she&#39;s been alive for what over 60 real years?&quot; <br />
&quot;There aren&#39;t a lot of real people up here yet, she&#39;s mostly just had Joe, me, Stew, and Ty.&quot; <br />
&quot;Alright, I&#39;ll see but it&#39;s been nice hanging out with... kinda sorta me.&quot; <br />
&quot;Same...&quot; <br />
The two similar women left the room and outside Joe and Victoria jumped as they had let down their guard as the two women had just entered the room to them. <br />
Victoria said &quot;Um... that took basically no time.&quot; <br />
Julia said &quot;Well for us that took... several years.&quot; <br />
Joe said &quot;I get what you mean... Like when Ty told me my simulated life took no time at all.&quot;<br />
Cynthia asked &quot;But can you tell us apart Joe?&quot; Joe broke out in a cold sweat and pointed to Cynthia sure only she would ask the question... probably right? They could&#39;ve conspired against him, would either do that? Probably Sim Julia so that was her right? Cynthia nodded. <br />
<br />
Julia looked to Victoria and said &quot;Well... your up miss...&quot; unsure of how to address this sort of anomaly. The two went back into the room.</p>
