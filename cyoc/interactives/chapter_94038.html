<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After forever, (five minutes, which is forever for a toddler anyway), the two baby furs finally broke the hug. <br />
<br />
Sammy stood, naked except for a diaper the same as everyone else now in Franky Town. A cute little baby fox fur. <br />
<br />
He was surprised when Jessy gave him a pair of sun-glasses. &quot;You&#39;re a DJ aren&#39;t you?&quot; <br />
<br />
That made perfect logical sense and Sammy took them. <br />
<br />
He also politely turned off the sleepy music that had kept away Jessy&#39;s other friends who were eager to meet him too. He think stuck his head out the window and shouted, &quot;HEY EVERYBODY! COME ON IN!&quot; To Jessy&#39;s other friends so he could be their friend too!<br />
<br />
Turns out everyone . . . was bigger than Sammy had expected. They had stormed the place like a flood, literally pouring in through the front door and some windows. <br />
<br />
His new friends helped get his house fixed up. Before he&#39;d have been so upset at seeing his paid for house and carefully crafted equipment turned into their play-school equivalent. But now it felt so, NATURAL. And they all worked like they did before, BETTER than before in some cases. And the rest of Franky Town were gonna be happy that he could transmit music to the rest of the baby furs and play music for play time again (which meant all the time). <br />
<br />
Jessy also took the time to introduce Sammy to all her new friends . . . this took, a long while, a lot longer than &#39;forever.&#39; <br />
<br />
Billy The Buffalo, who ran the pawn shop. Eddy The Tiger, who&#39;d been a hobo (but he didn&#39;t know what not having a home had to do with clowns). Ziggy the cat. Husky Flinty. Danny the delivery lamb. And the macaques baby fur who was Bob who owned the local electronics store that Sammy had bought most of his stuff from. And plenty more where that came from. <br />
<br />
What surprised Sammy was no matter how many friends he made or was introduced to, he could remember the name, face, and likes of all of them! The empathy sphere each human had that clicks in around 250 had expanded infinity for Sammy. <br />
<br />
The moment Sammy touched his TV set, it became a large white plastic toy with a magic eye screen with a carrying case and little toy kobs. It also worked without being plugged in. And it picked up TV channels just fine. <br />
<br />
The news channels still owned by humans he picked up, mentioned an &#39;explosion off the coast of Florida&#39; in passing, and that that they had the situation contained, and there was no need to panic. Sammy noticed they were sweating. <br />
<br />
Ironically, Sammy found the &#39;news reports&#39; being given by his fellow baby furs had more information buried underneath their childish exterior than the official reports run by those who hadn&#39;t been changed yet (which seemed more about keeping people from panicking).  There was a foal donkey boy and a baby elephant girl sitting behind a desk their size, waving at the camera. &quot;Hiiiii everyone in furryland! We got some interesting stuff to talk about!&quot; Sammy couldn&#39;t help but wave back at the TV. <br />
<br />
They showed crayon drawings of some baby furs who had been going out from Florida on their toy boats that were completely sea worthy against all rules of sanity (with fun looking folded paper hats), and a big plane had flown over head and dropped a big fireworks on top of them, and the dust the dust (fall-out) when it came in contact with their little boats turned into confetti and glitter, and the wind blew the confetti and sparkles towards the Caribbean Islands, and were now getting radio transmissions from new baby furs there, many who were now visiting cities in Mexico where they were making many new friends too. <br />
<br />
There&#39;d also been an incident in Texas, where planes had dropped bombs full of green gas that killed little animals and grass when it was spreading towards the furs, but changed into laughing gas when they touched it. <br />
<br />
Turns out several baby furs had gotten the idea to simply use ear muffs to get past the lullabies, but Jessy had convinced them to wait out Sammy&#39;s generator to fail first. <br />
<br />
&quot;I was scared you, might do something foolish if you had lots of friends come visit you at once, since you were so fidgety, about making new friends.&quot; <br />
<br />
Sammy wondered about that, would he have gotten so desperate that he&#39;d &#39;go away forever&#39; rather than become friends with everyone? The idea hadn&#39;t actually crossed his mind once, he&#39;d wanted to stick it out to the end, not give up. <br />
<br />
In a while Sammy&#39;s house was transmitting music for the whole town to hear. And Jessy gave him a little tour of the parts of town he couldn&#39;t see from the toy floor of his old house. For starters, he saw the porn shop now sold plush animals. And all the R rated movies from the theater had vanished, though they were having a showing of &#39;My neighbor Tortoro.&#39; The money at the bank had become little more than play money, with the only real currency now valid being promises between baby furs. But given how scarcity no longer existed, money would be increasingly pointless. <br />
<br />
As it turns out, the run off from the water balloons (formally grenades) and squirt guns spraying down had entered the drainage systems, transformed Franky Town&#39;s sewer system (not that there was really a need for it with everyfur wearing diapers), and gone out to sea. This made Sammy wonder. How long did the, transforming effects of the water last? How long did it take to wear off? DID IT wear off? Was the effect spreading through the ocean in a change reaction, or was it contains to the water that was created/changed? How much was needed to transform a human into a new friend? A drop? A mole-ha-clue? A bucket&#39;s worth? Did it get &#39;used up&#39; as it transformed things? <br />
<br />
&quot;Jessy,&quot; Sammy asked as they bounced on a trampoline with a leopard baby fur wearing a hospital gown who was laughing, &quot;No more Can-Sir, no more Can-Sir!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah Sammy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Has anyfur done any re-search on how our stuff works, or how we make friends?&quot; <br />
<br />
Jessy thought about it for a bit, thinking really hard. Even putting her paw to her chin. &quot;Welllllll, the Mayor did say there were some baby furs trying to figure some stuff out at the universe-city, but I dunno the rest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we go to the universe-city? I wanna learn!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Sammy! If it&#39;s for you!&quot; Jessy smiled and nodded.<br />
<br />
A bit later they were at the bus stop. &quot;Hey Gary!&quot; She asked a brown bear baby fur. Who was playing jacks. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Jessy!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sammy wants to go to the Universe-City, wanna take us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;SURE! It&#39;ll be fun!&quot; <br />
<br />
Gary proceeded to write &#39;universe city&#39; on the front of his yellow toy bus and ushered them inside. &quot;All aboard for the universe-city!&quot; <br />
<br />
Another baby fur bear wearing a police cap on a tricycle waved them off as they bus &#39;drove&#39; off (more like &#39;Vroom! Vroom!ed&#39; off). <br />
<br />
The little baby fur soldiers at the edge waved them off. <br />
<br />
They waved at other baby furs going &#39;vroom vroom&#39; along the road too, now painted and scaled to them rather than humans who weren&#39;t friends yet. <br />
<br />
The little bus Sammy could tell from how the wind was blowing, couldn&#39;t have been going that fast, but it took no more than normal to travel to the state capital. <br />
<br />
The state capital university. <br />
<br />
The State capital.<br />
<br />
Sammy didn&#39;t think before where the smiling rainbow lights had come from. <br />
<br />
Samuel had been there before, but Sammy was in awe of the big big changes that had been made, everything was now bright and cheerful. He saw baby furs going about in what could be considered an adorable parody of their adult lives. Even baby furs riding in baby carriages being pushed by other baby furs. The bill boards now having crayon drawings on them. And everything now scaled to their size. The city looking now like the world&#39;s largest playset. <br />
<br />
And every single baby fur smiled and waved at each other as a dear friend. <br />
<br />
Gary&#39;s toy bus got them to the &#39;universe-city&#39; as soon as they liked, except now it had slides instead of stairs going down. <br />
<br />
Sammy and Jessy got out, skipped up the skips. The two found inside a &#39;dirkoree&#39; (as it spelled) that showed crayon drawings of different little baby fur faces. To a human, they&#39;d be incomprehensible nonsense, but as Sammy looked at them, he realized they all made perfect sense to him. That one was for the one figuring out how to make flowers smile. Another on what came first the chicken or the egg. And-<br />
<br />
&quot;This one!&quot; Sammy pointed at one smiling face, and the number next to it, room 531, well, it was 5E1 since the number was backwards. But who cared?<br />
<br />
The two baby fur holding hands skipped through the universe-city, seeing baby fur scrawling scipples on white board, and making paper-air planes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; Sammy asked as he and Jessy stepped inside room &#39;531&#39;. &quot;My name is Sammy friend, can I talk to you about baby furs?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure! What do ya wanna talk about?&quot; Said the occupant of the room hopping down from a stool. <br />
<br />
She was a baby fox like him. She was wearing a lab coat a couple sizes too big for her, and large thick framed reading glasses that never fell off no matter what angle she tilted her head. It only made her more adorable. <br />
<br />
Her &#39;lab equipment&#39; looked like a young child&#39;s play chemistry set -at best-, but like Jessy&#39;s toy phone, it all worked perfectly to her. <br />
<br />
The scrawls on her white board looked like the doodling of a child rather than any scientific formula, but the more Sammy looked at it, the more he understood it. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Samantha, I guess we can&#39;t both be Sammy, maybe call me Doctor Sammy? Tee-hee!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay!&quot; Sammy nodded and giggling too. &quot;So you&#39;re the one trying to figure out how we work?&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Sammy giggle and nodded. &quot;Yep! I&#39;m learin&#39; lots of stuff! I feel so happy I&#39;m one of the first to get to be made friends with! A whole new special day is happening and I get to see it! IT&#39;S SO COOL!&quot; She giggled and hugged her tummy. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;What about what we&#39;re losing? Boys and girls not getting together because the others is &#39;icky&#39; and even if we&#39;re gonna live forever, we&#39;ll be the first and last generation of our kind.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think you&#39;re icky.&quot; Jessy hugged and nuzzled him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, we&#39;re working on a way to create new baby furs using play-dough and the power of love,&quot; Samantha said with all the confidence and certainly only a toddler could bring to those words. And Sammy himself found he couldn&#39;t really argue her logic. He knew when he was human he would have, but now, what she said felt so obvious. <br />
<br />
&quot;So . . . do you have any idea where we came from? How we work?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think maybe we baby furs are actually part of the next iteration of the universe, and that&#39;s why we have different laws of fizz-icks governing us, and why contact with us and things we effect cause our universe to spread further. Or this is the desire of the collective &#39;un-con-sicious&#39; of human-icky, many-festive due their increased numbers creating unenough untapped &#39;psyic-ick&#39; force. Or maybe somefur just wished really really really really REALLLY hard to be young, happy and have lots of friends. My friends and I are still debating. We settled our last debate with tiddlywinks.&quot; <br />
<br />
Sammy nodded at the peaceful non-violent way to solve things. <br />
<br />
&quot;But isn&#39;t it bad to do something to someone they don&#39;t want happen to them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it could be thought of like a surprise party, and I feel super-duper-happy. And does my husband and our kids. Though we promised they could be the parents and we could be the kids for this weekend since we&#39;ve been the parents for decades. I can&#39;t really imagine myself without my diaper and fur now. And I don&#39;t think I&#39;d really want to. Would you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sammy started. He remembered he had become friends with everyone, so he figure out a way to change everyone back including himself . . . He meant what he said to Samantha, and he didn&#39;t want the humans and his own kind to be fighting, but he really did feel -at home- among his fellow fur.</p>
