<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Soon enough, the Chronivac dinged as his changes were finally completed that Jeff was panting from the aftermath. He was already looking forward to having his true hands back when this was all over that Jeff shortly after responded to Sally&#39;s question if he was alright by purring with delight and quickly pounced on her naked body, with his cat like feline chest against her breast as he soon nuzzled her face completely. Sally was caught off guard by his strange new behavior and was sure enough surprise by this reaction, but was extremely happy about this to as Jeff was enjoying his start of being her temporarily pet.<br />
<br />
&quot;ha, ha... I guess i&#39;ll take that as a yes then.&quot; Sally said as she laughed about it and soon enough after is when Jeff gently got off of her for she shortly got up and removed a bit of fur off her face. standing there naked in the room side by side together now that the two were soon looking at the mirror as they were amazed at the results of their new bodies for the former pet and master looked on with each of their smiles, before looking up towards at one another.<br />
<br />
&quot;welcome to the other side of the fence, my Jeffy boy. I sure do hope that you enjoy your new life as i&#39;ll have with mine.&quot; Sally said as she soon realized something for she looked to herself in the mirror more while posing like a mannequin model.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm... you know... as much on how good I am with this look, I don&#39;t think that humans should be going around naked all the time. let alone during the day.&quot; Sally started to say as she soon turned to see the clothes Jeff discarded on the bed that picking his briefs up, she decided to wear them.<br />
<br />
&quot;well... might as well. time to get dressed, since these are the only clothes that I can think of.&quot; she said as Sally approached the bed and struggled to put on Jeff&#39;s that Jeff looked on to her dressing up for he was surprised on how well she knew to put on clothing to begin with. however, he did gave her human intelligent that she would know by how to do things in which normal people would do and not act like a dog in human skin... even if Jeff knew some people who were into petplay.<br />
<br />
once she was finished on dressing up that she then returned back to the mirror and see on just how she looked for she did indeed was, ridiculous in male clothing. despite it being possibly tight in a few places however, she did managed to work it out while making her look more modes that she even tied the shirt in the middle to show off her mid section and lowered the pants so it was close to her private. she looked a bit like a tomboy with Jeff&#39;s clothes on her that Jeff started to dress himself by placing on his secretive black leather boxers first, followed by his blue korean jeans with torn holes in the legging as he made a hole for his strippy rope of a tiger tail, and a white armless t-shirt.<br />
<br />
looking to themselves, Sally gave a cocky grin and said, &quot;not the best look out there. for now though, at least that it will have to do. unless I take some of your mother&#39;s clothing that i&#39;m gonna have to go out and buy me some outfits I like to wear, while looking like this for now. still though, she&#39;ll be asking about where her stuff went off to. so, until then as i&#39;ll figure something out that let&#39;s just enjoy our day together.<br />
<br />
Sally walked over and gave Jeff&#39;s furry head a rub, while carefully putting a new leather chain collar around the neck of her new tizzy tiger. Jeff purred happily and hugged her closely as he was now ready to start spending his time, as Sally&#39;s temporarily pet. unhugging, Sally soon turned to Jeff and asked in a polite tone on what they should do with their switched lives for she was now the master as Jeff was now nothing more then her pet while flexing his muscles and looking himself out in all his glory before returning to see Sally being his master for the time being. &quot;so... what now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it, boy? Does it hurt?&quot; Sally as Jeff felt a small migraine happening, he growled a bit. &quot;It&#39;s probably just the &#39;vac, teaching you things. You know what, I bet you know all sorts of neat tricks by now. We can try some. Let&#39;s see,hmm...oh, Sit!&quot; She said, firmly.<br />
<br />
as he was sitting next to her that Jeff jumped off the bed and assumed a sitting position, by sitting onto his hunches on the floor. Realizing as to what she has told him to do and what he has done that suddenly, he starts glaring at her. What was she doing.... doesn&#39;t she know that he wasn&#39;t really a humanoid pet?<br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy.... however, that was just an easy task for you. Now then, kiss me!&quot; When she gave a command in that firm voice, he instantly knew just what to do. Jeff slowly got off the floor and gently appeared Sally, to softly kiss her on the lips as she returned the kiss back to her. &quot;I guess you&#39;re an expert at this. If you don&#39;t know something, I can always use the &#39;vac here to help you out. Is that ok with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded, agreeably. He loved her to death, and wanted her to be happy. Curiously, He looked over at the Chronovac. His knowledge of how to use it was getting harder to access, even if he had memories of using it. His feline knowledge told him that it was impossible for it was something he wasn&#39;t supposed to even use at all as it was the master&#39;s, let alone touch it.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about we go and get a treat? Carry me off to the kitchen.&quot; Sally said to him as she gave him a firm order. He growled approvingly that He got slowly got up and walked over to her to lift her up in his furry buffed arms, before heading off to the kitchen. It didn&#39;t even occurred to him to walk bipedalism while carrying her out to the kitchen, instead of walking alongside her to the kitchen on his hands and knees with her on his back as he was still wearing his decided clothes on. It was quadrupedalism locomotion that would seem strange to walk on all fours for him, not that he wasn&#39;t thinking about it.<br />
<br />
Once there, he gently lowered her down as sally shortly reached into the pantry and pulled out a large slab of raw meat stack. She instead of tossing it to Jeff that she hands it over to him to eat while she then heads back to the fridge, to get herself a glass of chocolate milk.<br />
<br />
She thought about looking for a straw to drink from, when the door shortly opened. As it opened, Jeff&#39;s mom, Dad, and twelve year old sister soon entered. &quot;Sally, dear...we&#39;re home. Can you help us with the groceries? They&#39;re in the trunk.&quot; Jeff&#39;s mom asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, be right there.&quot; Sally said. almost automatically, she was heading toward the door while as Jeff was still chewing down on his piece of meat.<br />
<br />
Jeff, smelling three new humans, scarfed down his meat in a hurry that he then ran to them excitedly. He was so happy that they were home, but this meant... That something about the thing in the bedroom had to be done... Right? As soon he started on the thoughts of the bedroom that he had a strong memory of being told something strange. The strange thing was that the bedrooms were off limits, unless someone is in there with you. He didn&#39;t want to be a bad tiger-man!<br />
<br />
Not knowing why, he&#39;d had to wait for Sally to do the thing... If it was that important to him that is. he shouldn&#39;t do it without her permission.</p>
