<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>People will realize I&#39;m intentionally mirroring the previous chapter and didn&#39;t just copy-paste it, right?</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Well, obviously we don&#39;t let anything go to waste here. We stitched your other halfs together, too. But unlike you they will stay here and become a new Dr. Vergunstien. We can&#39;t have two of you just running around, we made that mistake before. Just consider it your payment. You did say you’d do everything,” Doctor Vergunstien explained. <br />
<br />
Both Maria and Lilith were conflicted hearing this information about their other halves, but they were aware of the risks coming to this place carried and agreed to do everything. They could only hope that they would understand. “Can we at least see them?” Maria asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes, you’re allowed to see them, but no more than that for now. Maybe some time later, once all of you fully figured out your identities. Follow me, they should have woken up by now.” The doctor pushed a walking aid towards the half-and-half girl. Each half gripped one of the handles and they started to carefully walk forward step by step. Walking felt a bit like in a three-legged race, just with two legs. They’d have to get used to this as soon possible.<br />
<br />
~~~~~<br />
<br />
When Lilith opened her eyes she noticed two things, one she could see everything only blurred, and two her entire left side was now numb. She sat up right only to notice something else weird, her height had decreased a little. It was then that Maria woke up, looking around she noticed much the same as Lilith had, the two looked from left to right trying to find any trace of their companion before eventually looking down. There they saw that one half of them was normal, however the side they felt was numb was replaced entirely by their girlfriend’s body bordered by stitches. At the same time they both reached up and touched their face, feeling another hand already there as well as the facial features of their lover. <br />
<br />
Before they could do anything else they just then noticed the doctor that operated them sitting in a chair, the lab coat hiding her additional arms again. “Oh good, you&#39;re awake, now we can begin.” She turned to face them. “I’ll just make sure the surgery went alright. I should probably mention beforehand a few things. As you might&#39;ve already guessed, I also attached your respective other halves together. One of you had to get some preferential treatment and through pure chance it became your other halves.” Seeing them squint at her she handed the half-and-half girl Maria’s glasses, which they managed to put on after some fumbling. <br />
<br />
“Onto the details, I needed to borrow a few leg and arm bones from Maria and put them into Lilith so your body evened out. I also meshed your vocal cords together, so don&#39;t be surprised by your composite voice. It also goes without saying, but you have one half of each one’s brain inside your skull.” The doctor then began to cockily fan herself with her clipboard. “I really am a wiz when it comes to neurosurgery. Working those tiny little...” She started groping herself under the labcoat with some of her extra hands before stopping and coughing. “Anyway, the reason we did this was to make it easier for the two of you to walk and function as one. Just answer these simple questions and you can be on your own in no time.”<br />
<br />
“Lilith, what is the name of your first dog?” she obviously read the question off the clipboard. <br />
<br />
“Benny.” Said Lilith in their new voice, but Maria felt her own lips move to answer. The green-and-magenta haired girl made a check. “Maria, same question.”<br />
<br />
“Benny.” The two girls blink. “Wait… no… His name was… umm, uh...” said Maria. <br />
<br />
“It’s right now,” said Dr Vergunstien with a grin. “Favorite color, Lilith?” <br />
<br />
“Green,” she said.<br />
<br />
“And Maria?”<br />
<br />
“Green, but Lilith’s answer is supposed to be blue.”<br />
<br />
The doctor made another check on the board.<br />
<br />
“Name of father?”<br />
<br />
“Jason,” said Lilith. <br />
<br />
“Mark,” Maria said somewhat bitterly.<br />
<br />
The doctor raised an eyebrow and wrote something.<br />
<br />
“Name of mother?”<br />
<br />
They both answered “Karen.”<br />
<br />
“Name of grandmother?”<br />
<br />
“Alice,” said Maria.<br />
<br />
“Jennie,” said Lilith.<br />
<br />
Again the half afro-american, half asian with multiple arms made another note then shrugged.<br />
<br />
“Well, neurosurgery is a tough science and unfortunately even I am only almost perfect. Up next on the plan is the physical section.” The composite doctor sauntered over to Maria-Lilith. She then pinched Maria on the shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Can you feel this Maria?” <br />
<br />
“Yes,” she replied meekly.<br />
<br />
“Lilith?” <br />
<br />
“Nope.”<br />
<br />
“Good.”<br />
<br />
She then reached over and began pinching the nipple of Lilith’s small chest, making the tomboyish girl bite their lips.<br />
<br />
“You can feel this, right?” <br />
<br />
“Hn… yeah.”<br />
<br />
“And Maria?” <br />
<br />
The blonde-haired side shook their head. Dr. Vergunstien smiled then clicked her pen making more notes as she walked around. She then tapped on the spine of the merged girl with her other hand before then moving to the front of them. Slowly she parted their legs before jamming two fingers into their shared slit. Both their heads went back in utter ecstasy, as the doctor drove her fingers deeper into their labia till their tips were brushing against their shared clit.<br />
<br />
“You can both feel this, right?”<br />
<br />
The girls nodded enthusiastically, letting out a moan in their mixed voice.<br />
<br />
“Your good doctor here took extra special care to connect your nerves to a single clit.” Her fingers moved back and forth against the respective pink walls of their cooch. Just when it felt like they were about to burst. The doctor removed her fingers and licked off their fluids before making a final note. “Hmm… we’re going to have lots of fun together, I can already tell. Anyways, that should be all for now.”<br />
<br />
A knocking from one of the walls surprised the occupants of the room. “Looks like they were faster, oh well.” The doctor moved towards the wall and pressed a button that turned the glass see-through. “Ladies, get your first and potentially only look at your other halves.”<br />
<br />
Slowly they walked to the wall. Standing beside a half african, half ginger cat woman in a lab coat was a clone of themselves. Not a perfect one, left and right were inverted, they had Lilith’s height, her green eyes and the long half of what once was a shaved sidecut. Maria placed her hand on the glass and the other Maria did the same. “What are you going to do with us?” Maria asked.<br />
<br />
“They will return home once they&#39;re fully recovered. You will stay here and become part of our little family, the next Dr. Vergunstien, as part of your payment. Don&#39;t blame them, I decided who goes and who stays,” their doctor explained. “This here will be your only contact for now. The other Dr. Vergunstien over there believes that talking to your other half too early will harm your psyche.”<br />
<br />
Maria and Lilith stared for a moment longer into the eyes of their other halves. When coming to this place they were fully prepared to give everything for a chance to stay together. “Will we be able to help others like you did for us?”<br />
<br />
“If you want to.”<br />
<br />
“Then we&#39;ll do it.” Maria and Lilith gave a determined nod towards their other selves.<br />
<br />
“Perfect, not like you had a choice…” The doctor pressed the button and the glass wall turned opaque again. Maria left her hand on it for a moment longer. Somehow she knew her other half was doing the same. “Okay then, once you two are fully recovered, we can start your first step on becoming one of us and that is…”</p>
