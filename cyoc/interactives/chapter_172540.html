<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Maddi carries you inside her house in search of the rest of hee family. Your current form was a bit too big for her front door, so she takes you in through the garage, which had a slightly wider door frame. When you entered the garage, Maddi realizes that her family must be out somewhere because the cars are gone. <br />
<br />
&quot;Seems like no one is home.&quot; I say as I look down at Maddi to see what she thinks. &quot;My parents don&#39;t seem to be, but maybe my little sister still is. Although, I am not sure if she would be of much help as she is only 8. Hell, she may even be afraid of you now. So I guess just prepare yourself to be screamed at.&quot; I could feel Maddi give me a comforting rub along my body. &quot;You should prepare as well. While you still look similar, you did change quite a bit too.&quot; &quot;Yeah... I really hope this isn&#39;t going to be too complicated.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maddi opens up the house door and carries me inside. I have been over here quite a few times before, and it still is as spacious as ever. The entire home had a modern design theme, which really made the place seem a lot bigger. We could hear that the TV in the other room was on, so someone likely is home. &quot;Hey May May, you still here?&quot; Shouts Maddi. You could here the TV turn off and footsteps running towards you. &quot;Seems like she is here. Oh, could you put me down behind you for now?&quot; I ask as I would rather not startled the little kid. &quot;Yeah, sure. Let me just unwind you.&quot; Maddie quickly unwraps me and sets me down behind her right as her sister enters the room, having just ran down the stairs.<br />
<br />
Maddi turns back around right as her sister was about to hug her from behind. The moment she did though, her sister tripped and stumbled passed Maddi and fell right onto my chest. &quot;May May. I have told you that you can&#39;t run on the floor in socks!&quot; Scolds Maddi as she peals the little girl off of me since I can&#39;t do it myself, yet at least. <br />
<br />
Maddi&#39;s sister is, for lack of a better descriptor, energetic. Her full name is Marybeth, but Maddi has always just called her May May as she felt that using Mary sounded too similar to her own name. She basically looked like a younger Maddi though, not really quite as much at the moment. May May was rubbing her head as she was picked up by Maddi and set down to sit on top of the nearby counter. Finally she was able to get a good look at us.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whaa, your so tall Maddi!&quot; It was a good start since it seems that she at least recognizes Maddi. &quot;I just happened to go through a bit of a sudden growth spurt is all.&quot; While Maddi&#39;s explanation wasn&#39;t exactly wrong, I felt that calling her change just a growth spurt was selling it extremely short. &quot;Hey, could do you know who this is?&quot; Asks Maddi, now pointing towards you. &quot;That&#39;s Lily!&quot; It seems like she only knew you as Lily now. &quot;And who is Lily?&quot; May May looked confused by the question. &quot;Lily is Lily.&quot; Was her answer. Yep, that answer was kind of expected from an 8 year old. <br />
<br />
Maddi set May May back down on the ground and went to get something to drink, she tried offering to get something for me too, but I reminded her that I couldn&#39;t hold a cup, let alone drink from one by myself. She laughed and said that she would hold it for me and would give me a straw in a glass of water. <br />
<br />
Maddi&#39;s phone began to ring while she was getting the drinks, so she put it on speeker phone. &quot;Hello&quot; answeres Maddi. &quot;Maddi! So Alex let you return back to normal I guess. You guys just left us here when Alex suddenly went home. We also have your clothes with us. Want us to meet you at your house?&quot; It was Liz and Amanda. &quot;Thans for getting them, and yep, we are all seperated once again, although not exactly back to normal. And sure, come on over. I am sure Alex would love to show you both what has happened to him. Its kinda cool, and somehow sexy in a way, but creepy all at the same time. You just gotta see it.&quot; Invites Maddi. It was not like I was hiding anything, but I now was a bit anxious that Liz and Amanda would be comming over, and how they would react to seeing us. Hang on a minute. They still know me as Alex, and not Lily. I wonder if it works something like if you know about the amulet, then you don&#39;t get your memories altered? <br />
<br />
About half an hour later, me and Maddi were still in her kitchen. Maddi helped move me over to the table, where I now stood/sat in one of the chairs. I have been slowly learning how to move each of my boobs and am starting to make a bit of progress towards walking even. <br />
<br />
The front door opened up and Liz and Amanda walked in carrying a bundle of clothing and headed towards the kitchen after Maddi called them in. They only managed to make it to the door way before they stopped dead in their tracks and just stared at the two of us in disbelief as to what they were seeing. &quot;Ok, what the hell did you guys even bet to end up like this?&quot; Asks Liz. &quot;I assume that you&#39;re Alex?&quot; Added Amanda.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, I am still Alex. And we didn&#39;t bet anything. And before you ask, I have no idea how I ended up like this. I just did.&quot; Liz looks at me sympathetically &quot;Well, on the bright side, at least you have a pretty face as a girl.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks... I think? You should maybe know that I don&#39;t necessarily dislike this form either. It is just a bit hard to control at the moment is all.&quot; I explain to them that I didn&#39;t hate being like this so that they didn&#39;t get any misunderstandings about me being miserable or something. &quot;Admittedly, I have actually been feeling really great. This body feels really good to be in, at least in terms of comfort. If only learning to walk again wasn&#39;t as hard, I would probably be enjoying my self quite a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Asks Amanda as she moves over next to me and begins feeling up my body. Her slightly cold hands tickle as she investigates my body. &quot;Ohh, I can definitely see why you like it with these babys&quot; she says as she grabs my cocks. &quot;Holy shit those are huge!&quot; Added Liz, after seeing them as well. Thankfully May May had long since gone back to watching TV by now or this would have been even more awkward since now Liz and Amanda were each playing with one of my cocks, causing both of them to become erect. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, wait a minute guys&quot; I try saying, but it was too late as I felt both cocks burst forth 2 globs of my thick cum, causing my ass to shrink in size a bit as my cum sacks emptied a bit. Each glob coated their respective girl&#39;s body with a thick layer of white cum. Amanda had even gotten a lot of it into her mouth as I came right as she was about to speak. She was now  coughing it up as a bit of it was even dripping out of her nose as well. &quot;Fucking damn Alex, calm your dicks down&quot; jokes Liz, who is now stripping her cum soaked clothing. &quot;Sorry about that Amanda. I only wanted to tease him/her a bit. I didn&#39;t expect Alex to blow her load that fast.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No shit I came that fast, I had 2 hot girls rubbing themselves all over my cocks.&quot; Maddi was the only one to look worried. &quot;So, now we need to clean this up I guess&quot; she says with a heavy tone of irritation, as well as just a bit of regret as it would seem. &quot;Hey, so about how you both got like this&quot; reminds Amanda, who had finally <br />
stopped coughing up my cum.</p>
