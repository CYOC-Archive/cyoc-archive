<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Samantha stared in awe at her youthful complexion. In a matter of moments she had watched herself transform from an elderly woman into a seven year old first grader. The short sleeve blouse she had worn now hung on her like a smock with the cuffs resting on her forearms and the hem brushing against her shins. The only thought going through her head now was that she looked like a girl about to participate in a really messy art class.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hope you don&#39;t mind Samantha,&quot; Katie said. &quot;Me and Mary have been thinking about this for awhile.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha turned to Katie and Samantha and smiled. &quot;A month ago I would of had a fit,&quot; she said. &quot;Now I think this works, besides if I remember correctly Mary you wanted to see me in kindergarten, hope you like what you see.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary Elise smiled. &quot;Katie and I decided on first grade instead. Kindergarten seemed a little too young even for us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha sighed and looked at her friends. &quot;Okay so let&#39;s get dressed and go see your mom. Hope she can handle a bunch of seven year olds.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie smiled. &quot;We decided to shave a couple of years off mom as well. She might find it easier dealing with us if she were a little younger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha&#39;s jaw went slack as she took in this new information, to her knowledge she was unaware of Katie or Mary Elise ever making Kellie younger. Mary Elise and Katie had decided to keep the information of their first regression a secret between the two of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;How young are you making her?&quot; Samantha asked with concern. &quot;Only ten years,&quot; Katie said as she made her wish. <br />
<br />
Downstairs Kellie was unaware of the changes taking place as she began the journey back to 33. The changes were subtle as the fine lines around her eyes faded and her hair gained a more youthful luster. Kellie Absentmindedly adjusted her loosening slacks as she hit 33, the extra weight she had put on in her later years. Now happily humming a tune she continued making dinner as the girls came in dressed in jeans and t-shirts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi girls,&quot; Kellie said cheerfully. &quot;Dinners ready and after that I rented some movies and was thinking of braiding your girls hair.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls squealed with delight as they sat down for a home cooked spaghetti dinner.<br />
<br />
As the evening wore on the girls enjoyed themselves watching several Disney movies as Kellie braided their hair. Samantha particularly enjoyed it as Kellie gave her two long braided pigtails. Finally around 9:30 the girls began to get tired,Kellie noticed the sleepy looks on the girls faces and sent them upstairs to go to bed. Changing into their nightgowns the girls cuddled into one bed and fell into a blissful sleep.<br />
<br />
The next morning the three girls woke up with boundless energy and sprinted downstairs. Kellie was already up and making breakfast. &quot;Morning girls,&quot; she said. &quot;I hope you slept well, after breakfast I was thinking of taking you to the out mcdonalds playland for lunch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds great mom thanks,&quot; Mary Elise said. <br />
<br />
Kellie smiled. &quot;Glad you like it Mary now finish up and get dressed.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls ate quickly and raced upstairs to get changed. As they got changed into shorts and t-shirts Mary Elise turned to Samantha. &quot;You enjoying yourself so far Sammy?&quot; She asked. Samantha nodded enthusiastically. &quot;This has been so much fun,&quot; she said. &quot;I can&#39;t wait to get to the playland. I&#39;ve always wanted to try that thing out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know Sammy it&#39;s your turn to decide our age,&quot; Katie said. Samantha paused and looked at Katie. &quot;I think I&#39;ll wait for right now...I&#39;m enjoying myself too much.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls piled into Kellie&#39;s car and drove to the local playland in town. After grabbing some happy meals the girls ate before discarding their shoes and racing through the playland with several other kids. Now camped out in the upper portion of the playland the girls looked out at the restaurant. <br />
Kellie was happily chatting with a Hispanic woman and a shy dark haired woman who were both in their early thirties. The women were laughing as they continued to watch the playland. As the girls watched Samantha had an idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Katie can I ask a question?&quot; Samantha asked. &quot;What&#39;s on your mind Sammy?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was wondering if we could make Kellie and those women kids too. They keep looking at the playland...I&#39;ve got a feeling they might enjoy themselves in here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not a bad idea Sammy so what do you think should we make them older than us, younger or the same age.&quot; Mary asked. Samantha rubbed her chin as she thought as she was about to make her wish her eyes went wide and she began to blush heavily. Quickly the young girl darted behind the wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sammy what&#39;s the matter?&quot; Katie asked alarmed at her friends actions.<br />
<br />
&quot;My husband is here,&quot; she stated as she pointed to an elderly man sitting by himself. &quot;I can&#39;t believe it. The doctor told him to lay off the fast food.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary Elise and Katie quickly scanned the restaurant at saw Samantha&#39;s husband. The elderly man was eating a hamburger and sipping on a chocolate milkshake in a booth. &quot;You should go talk to him Sammy see what he&#39;s up to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What am I going to say to him,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I&#39;m literally a little girl in pigtails, besides he wouldn&#39;t recognize me we did t meet until we were in college.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really how old is he,&quot; Katie asked. &quot;You only told us his name was Jacob and that he was a loving husband. Tell us a little more.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha sighed and told them about Jacob. Jacob was 70, five years older than Samantha. Jacob had enlisted in the army after high school and attended college with Samantha when he left the army. Jacob was a gentle man who treated Samantha like a queen. The two were married when Samantha was 26 and had two boys and a girl. Jacobs only regret in life was that his hectic work schedule as a police officer had forced him to work a lot. Even with his hectic work schedule he always tried to make time for his family. Now retired he loved spending time with his wife but was very understanding when she said she wanted to spend time with her girlfriends. As he would always tell Samantha &quot;your happiness is my only concern. If you want to see your old friends I not the man to stop you. Have fun I&#39;ll be waiting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He sounds like a wonderful man,&quot; Mary said. &quot;You should go see him. Maybe get him to join in with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know how he would take that,&quot; Samantha said. &quot;Well the decision is yours,&quot; Katie said. &quot;You could go talk with him...we don&#39;t need to regress him or we could change my mom and her friends. Whatever you want to do we&#39;ll support you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha smiled and hugged her friends as she contemplated her next decision.</p>
