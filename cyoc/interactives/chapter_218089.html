<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex knew he was dreaming again, but he didn&#39;t care. He was back in that forest clearing but not with the wolf, instead Flint lay on the grass completely naked, and he lay atop him, similarly unclothed. Their rock hard cocks were trapped between them as they kissed eagerly, Flint&#39;s strong arms wrapped around Alex and holding him tight as Alex&#39;s hands held on to Flint&#39;s shoulders.<br />
<br />
They rolled over in the grass, limbs becoming tangled, bodies rubbing against each other until they both laid in the grass, Flint behind Alex, eagerly kissing the back of his neck. He felt something warm and slick pressing between his cheeks. He relaxed and welcomed the shaft of his partner inside him, wincing a little at the thickness of it spreading him apart, but loving every moment.<br />
<br />
A crash of thunder snapped Alex out of his dream. He looked over to the open window. There was barely any daylight filtering in and the sky was dark, another shock of lightning streaked across the cloud followed by another peal of thunder. Slipping out of bed he went over to close the windows before the rain started. Another trip over to the dresser to change his pants, which had a rather obvious damp spot on their front and he grabbed a pair of sandals that had been left for him, he decided maybe to take that trip downstairs.<br />
<br />
Venturing from his room, it was only a short trip down the hall to a staircase that led right into the inn&#39;s common room. Some voices echoed up from below, but it was quieter than Alex would have expected. Slowly, he headed down the stairs into a room that was mostly empty. Two tables had a few patrons sitting at them, and Flint stood at one of these setting down bowls and mugs. Another man stood behind the bar who must have been Flint&#39;s father. The family resemblance was strong, the man looking like Flint with another thirty years. He was maybe a touch taller, and even heavier, with more muscle and a slight layer of fat that added to his bulk but in no way made him look out of shape, just burlier. His beard was salt and peppered, and streaks of gray highlighted his temples. He looked over as Alex descended and broke into a big smile, waving him over.<br />
<br />
Alex approached the bar and took a stool. &quot;Alex then?&quot; His voice was just as deep as Flint&#39;s, though gruff rather than soft. &quot;I would have come up to greet you, but Flint was insistent you be left alone to rest.&quot; He let out a deep belly laugh. &quot;He&#39;s quite protective of you already.&quot; There was an almost knowing smile on the older man&#39;s face. If this is how Flint would look older, Alex thought, he&#39;d be quite happy to spend his life with the man. The thought made him blush a little. Flint&#39;s father must have mistaken the blush as a response to his comment. &quot;Ah, sorry, I talk too freely. I&#39;m Brock by the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alex.&quot; Alex offered in return, though Brock&#39;s nod indicated he already knew that. &quot;Thank you for letting me stay here, I don&#39;t know how I can repay y..&quot;<br />
<br />
He was cut off by a heavy slap on the shoulder. &quot;No payment needed. I&#39;m not so desperate that I&#39;ll turn away a young man in need. Just don&#39;t let it get around or I&#39;ll never rent another room.&quot; He looked consideringly at Alex for a moment. &quot;Though, I&#39;ve heard you&#39;re stranded. If you need a place to stay and some employment, I could use some more help around here. It&#39;s just me and Flint since my last hired help went off to try a life in the king&#39;s army.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad. Don&#39;t go trying to recruit the guests.&quot; Flint&#39;s tone came in chiding but fond.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not? Maybe it will lead to something and I can retire knowing the place is in good hands.&quot; Brock&#39;s grin was almost too wide, and for the first time Alex got to witness Flint flustered. Alex felt a little flustered himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad!&quot; Flint said in a harsh stage whisper.<br />
<br />
Brock paid it no mind. &quot;Why don&#39;t you keep your guest company. It&#39;s slow and I doubt it&#39;ll pick up with a storm rolling in. Take a load off, I&#39;ve got it handled.&quot; He patted his son on his shoulder, who just sighed and nodded. Flint stepped around the counter and moved to one of the smaller empty tables, motioning for Alex to follow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about him. Any cute guy around my age that wanders in he tries to hook me up with. He wants me to settle down and start a family.&quot; Flint winced a little as he took his chair.<br />
<br />
Cute? Alex smiled at the compliment, not one he had heard often back home. &quot;Do you not want to?&quot; He asked as he took the other chair.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. No, I mean I do. I just.. I&#39;m waiting for the right guy. Too many of my friends hooked up with the first person to come along and now are stuck in unhappy marriages. I want someone I know I want to spend the rest of my life with.&quot; He grinned, then quickly added. &quot;The casual hook ups in the meantime are fun too. What about you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, I mean, if I found the right person, yeah.&quot; Alex blinked as suddenly Brock was nearby, setting down a bowl of stew in front of him, and a mug of beer in front of both him and Flint. He vanished as quickly as he appeared, surprising Alex with how deftly he moved despite his size.<br />
<br />
Flint just cast an annoyed but fond look after his father. Looking back to Alex he leaned in, voice going to a bit of a whisper. &quot;Earlier, you said I smelled good, what.. can I ask you what you mean?&quot; This close, Alex could still smell that scent, though it was less strong in the common room, mingled with the other smells drifting about like baking bread, and the cooking stew, and even the ale added it&#39;s own aroma. Not that the place stunk, quite the opposite, it was a pleasant homey smell, but it just vied with Flint&#39;s aroma.<br />
<br />
&quot;You just smell good.&quot; Alex said, a little confused by the question, but also unable to resist a small laugh. &quot;It&#39;s distracting, whatever it is, cologne, soap, I don&#39;t know. You just smell good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like?&quot; Flint said, gently prompting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woody, and spicy. Kind of like cedar, or cinnamon, maybe cloves.  I can&#39;t say for sure, it just smells good. Like..&quot; Home, Alex thought to himself, just finishing with a shrug. &quot;I don&#39;t know. Just good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Flint nodded, looking thoughtful. &quot;Guess I&#39;ll need to get more of that soap.&quot; He picked up his beer and took a swig. Alex couldn&#39;t resist the stew much longer and began wolfing it down eagerly, dipping some of the bread that had come with it into the broth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your dad&#39;s a good cook.&quot; Alex said between mouthfuls.<br />
<br />
Flint just grinned. &quot;I do most of the cooking actually, but thanks.&quot; Despite the misplaced compliment, he still looked pleased and Alex grinned around another spoonful of stew. He felt a leg press against his under the table. &quot;Do you want to try to get back to your realm? The trip to the capital city takes about a week, but if you want to see if a wizard can help you, that&#39;s the place to find one. I&#39;ll even escort you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex set down his spoon, sitting up a little in the chair. &quot;I dunno. I mean, there&#39;s things I miss about my home but, I haven&#39;t really seen here, just been in a room upstairs. I was kind of alone back home anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
Flint nodded. &quot;Well, let me know when you&#39;re up to it and I can show you around town. In the meantime, maybe I can answer some questions.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex pulled his beer closer, taking a sip and smiling at the hoppy taste. &quot;Is.. okay how do I put this. Everyone in this world is a guy?&quot; Flint tilted his head to the side, looking a bit confused. &quot;I mean, there&#39;s only one gender? Everyone has a...&quot; Alex&#39;s voice dipped into a whisper. &quot;Cock?&quot;<br />
<br />
Flint arched a brow but nodded. &quot;Well, unless something happened to it, yeah. And I hear there&#39;s a kingdom on another continent where they do that to some people as part of some ritual. But yeah, I think I know what you&#39;re asking, and yes. Why? Is that not how it works where you&#39;re from.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex shook his head. &quot;No, we have two genders. Men and women. Women.. well.. they are the ones that give birth, and they have breasts, and usually when people partner it&#39;s a man and a woman, though some like me prefer their own gender, and.. I guess it doesn&#39;t matter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds complicated.&quot; Flint said with a laugh. &quot;Nope, just one type of person here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex shook his head. &quot;So, when you said you wanted to start a family, would you be the one to...&quot; He patted his stomach.<br />
<br />
Flint frowned. &quot;Well, some couples do that, just pick one partner to do the birthing, me, I think it&#39;d be easier to trade off if you wanted more than one.&quot; He shrugged. &quot;Or just let fate decide. I&#39;m not one of those that likes it just one way.&quot; His smile was a bit coy as he scooted his chair a bit closer to Alex. &quot;Tell me more about your world.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex obliged, regaling Flint with tales he listened to with a mix of wonder and skepticism. It lasted what felt like minutes but was probably hours. The room emptied and soon it was just Alex and Flint left. &quot;And you might not want to go back?&quot; He asked after another explanation on television.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we don&#39;t have magic.&quot; Alex pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess, not that it&#39;s really something you run into a lot.&quot; Flint said, bumping Alex&#39;s shoulder with his own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Flint! Time to clean up for the night.&quot; Brock called form the counter, making his son look up and nod.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, duty calls. I&#39;ll talk to you tomorrow?&quot; Alex nodded his answer, watching as Flint got up and wandered into the kitchen. His eyes stayed on that door for a long moment before he got up to head to the stairs and back to his room. Slipping inside he wandered over to his bed, but before getting in stripped down. He had never really slept naked, but spending the last couple of days doing so, decided it had its advantages.<br />
<br />
That night he dreamt of running through the woods on four legs once again. Eventually the black wolf showed up and gave chase. They made a game of bounding through the woods, trying to grab one another by the tails until they lay down in a dewy clearing, nestled together. He had a second, shorter dream, where he was human, but being cradled in a pair of strong furred arms, being carried through the woods. He nestled up against the monster&#39;s powerful, furry chest and sighed contentedly, knowing this giant beast would never hurt him as he drifted off in it&#39;s arms.</p>
