<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Gah! Shit that hurts!” you said as Nat pressed the syringe deep into your arm. You were now standing in a small barn, with Jessica nervously waiting beside you for her own transformation to begin. Given the limited choice of species available you figured you had both chosen well, however; that didn’t do anything to ease the pain as you felt the Zoo’s curse beginning to get to work once again.<br />
<br />
“Oh don’t be such a baby,” Nat replied as she finally removed the syringe, “you’re going to have to be braver than that for where you’re going. Come on Jessica, now it’s your turn…”<br />
<br />
With that, Jessica nervously turned away and held out her arm. Then, Nat wasted no time before injecting your girlfriend with her chosen serum. As a result, both of you were soon convulsing in pain, as you felt an intense heat spreading over your body and the first animalistic changes beginning to get underway.<br />
<br />
First, you felt a few patches of heat beginning to spread across your back as you started to feel new hairs sprouting through the pores of your skin. Wisely, you and Jessica had already removed your clothes, thus ensuring that they wouldn’t be destroyed; whilst also allowing you to watch the changes as they happened. As a result, you were able to see your new pelt starting to form as tawny brown fur began to spread all over your exposed skin.<br />
<br />
As for Jessica, her skin took on different characteristics as hundreds of small pin pricks started to erupt all over her body. These spine-like growths were then engulfed by a fluffy brown layer of soft feathers, which gradually started to blanket everything beneath her neck.<br />
<br />
“Ah, your new disguises are coming along nicely,” Nat said with a smile as she looked between you and Jessica. “Remember, your bodies will transform but your minds should stay intact. I’m afraid this may make your changes less enjoyable, but at least you won’t be tempted to quite literally screw your humanity away!”<br />
<br />
Hearing this made you grunt in amusement, however you were soon overcome with pain again when you felt your bones and organs beginning to twist and contort. You could only cry out in distress as your chest started to become leaner and more streamlined. Your arms and legs also started to shift, with the muscles becoming more elastic as the bones themselves shifted into a quadrupedal orientation. Then, to cap these changes off, you let out a groan of discomfort as you watched your hands and feet morphing into a set of four padded paws; each adorned with a set of sharp retractable claws.<br />
<br />
As your changes continued, you hoped that watching Jessica might help distract you from some of the pain. With this in mind, you looked over to your transforming girlfriend, only to see that she was starting to dwindle in size. Already, she had already shrunk to about half your size as she looked up at you in discomfort.<br />
<br />
Aside from shrinking, Jessica’s body had also changed dramatically. Already, her body had lost most of its fat and weight as her chest flattened and her breasts were absorbed into her body. A rich covering of feathers now covered most of her lower body, with the one exception being her legs which had now adopted a yellow, scaly texture. Furthermore, Jessica’s feet had also contorted into a strange new orientation, with three toes left facing forwards while a fourth now pointed backwards; each of which was adorned with a sharp black talon.<br />
<br />
“Are you OK Jess?” You asked in between grunts of discomfort.<br />
<br />
“Nnnghh… it hurts but I’ll… I’ll be fine.” Jessica replied as she grimaced in discomfort. “You holding up ok?”  <br />
<br />
“Yeah sure,” you replied sarcastically, “never bet- Ahhhhhh!!!”<br />
<br />
Your words tailed off as you felt an enormous spike of pain suddenly strike your pelvis. You looked down, only to see that your hips had now snapped into a quadrupedal orientation, meaning it suddenly became very difficult to remain upright as you wobbled around on your new animalistic legs.<br />
<br />
“Come on dear,” Nat said as she watched you desperately trying to stay on two legs, “why prolong the inevitable? Your disguise won’t work if you remain upright, so you’d better get used to being on all-fours…”<br />
<br />
With that, Nat suddenly pushed you forward with a hard shove. You groaned out in dismay as you felt yourself falling, but you did manage to catch yourself as you put your arms out in front of you. You glared up at Nat after feeling betrayed, but you soon distracted by another spike of pain as your hips snapped loudly once again; this time settling into their final configuration. Now you knew you would have to remain like this, down on four legs as befit the animal you were becoming.<br />
<br />
With this major adjustment out of the way, the changes seemed to accelerate as they continued to reshape you into your new form. You cried out in agony as your spine started to lengthen into a long tail, which soon became covered in the same rich golden-brown fur that made up the rest of your new pelt. Once this was out of the way you could see that your body was now pretty-much complete from the neck downwards. However, there was still one glaringly obvious change that had yet to unfold, but as you felt a tingling in your cock and balls you knew it was time for this to be corrected…<br />
<br />
You looked under yourself as you watched your junk nervously, desperately not wanting to see it turn into a vagina again. The chemical you had been injected with specified that it was a male animal you were turning into, but you still had your doubts as you watched for any signs of change.<br />
<br />
Initially, you were horrified by what you saw as you saw your penis beginning to shrink and reform. However, you soon breathed a sigh of relief when your cock soon stopped shrinking and instead started to reform. You felt slightly embarrassed as you watched your dick taking on a shorter, more pointed shape; which embarrassingly started to stiffen and turn a reddish colour as more blood was quickly pumped into it. <br />
<br />
As strange as this all was, things got even weirder when you noticed numerous backwards-facing spines appearing over your dick’s surface. With biology never having been your best subject, you hadn’t been prepared for this unusual development as you watched your fully-erect, barbed cock bobbing beneath you proudly.<br />
<br />
Mercifully, your embarrassing erection only lasted for a short while, after which it quickly started to soften now that the curse had finished reshaping it. Soon, your deflated penis followed your fuzzier testicles in pulling back further between your legs, before finally settling beneath your new tail. Feeling the cool air on your new genitals felt strangely good; so much better than the sloppy mare cunt you once possessed as Princess.<br />
<br />
With a newfound sense of relief now that you knew you would remain male, you decided to have another check up on Jessica. By this stage, your girlfriend was starting to become almost unrecognisable now that her changes were starting to near their conclusion. <br />
<br />
The two of you were now about the same height now that you were on all-fours. However, that was where any similarity ended as you looked at the distinctly avian features of Jessica’s developing body. She now looked ready to take off as she spread her new tail feathers and flapped her massive wings in an effort to get comfortable. <br />
<br />
“Are you ok Jess?” You asked with a slight growl to your voice. “Looks like you’re nearly there.”<br />
<br />
“Yes baby, I’m nghhh…” Jessica wasn’t able to finish before another powerful surge of pain seemed to grip her entire body. She let out a breathless cry which sounded more bird-like than human, as the changes now powered on towards their conclusion.<br />
<br />
You could only watch in silence as Jessica’s feathers crept up her neck, transforming her voicebox and replacing her words with a chorus of agonised avian cries. Following on from this, Jessica shook her head in dismay as her lovely blonde hair started to fall to the ground, only to be replaced by clear white feathers; contrasting nicely with the brown colouration of the rest of her body.<br />
<br />
As well as this, Jessica’s face also started to shift dramatically. Her nose and mouth seemed to morph together as a long yellow beak started to push out towards you. Jessica let out more cries of discomfort as her nostrils shifted to the top of her developing beak, while the tip became curved at the tip as it pressed out further.<br />
<br />
With this dramatic change out of the way, the only thing still human about your girlfriend were her bright blue eyes. Sadly, this wasn’t the case for long as you watched Jessica’s irises shift to bright yellow colour, not too dissimilar to her new beak. And with that the process was complete. Jessica was now a magnificent bald eagle!<br />
<br />
“Bravo!” Nat announced as she went to inspect Jessica’s new body. She gently offered her outstretched arm to your disorientated girlfriend in an effort to pick her up. It took Jessica a few moments to figure out what the woman wanted, but eventually she did figure it out as she carefully wrapped her wicked black talons around the arm being offered to her.<br />
<br />
“Ah, aren’t you magnificent,” Nat said as she held Jessica up for a closer inspection. She then proceeded to examine one of the eagle’s impressive wings after running her hand through some of the fluffier feathers on her underside.<br />
<br />
“Yes, you will do nicely,” Nat finally announced in conclusion, “the process was faultless as anticipated. Now, all we need to do is wait for your precious boyfriend. Don’t worry, he doesn’t have much left to go…”<br />
<br />
As if to prove Nat correct, you suddenly felt an intense pain around your neck and skull. You cries of pain increasingly started to resemble loud inhuman roars as the changes crept over your neck and started to encroach upon your still-human face. You could only let out more grunts and growls of discomfort as you felt your face starting to push out into a pronounced muzzle. Like with Jessica, you also felt your human hair coming out in clumps, only for the bare skin to be filled-in by more of your rich, golden-brown fur. <br />
<br />
With your transformation now nearing its conclusion, you briefly turned to look at Jessica for reassurance. Happily, you could still see a strong flicker of intelligence in the eagle’s large, expressive eyes. The knowledge that Jessica was still in there helped to put your mind at ease and to embrace the rest of your changes.<br />
<br />
As a result, the curse seemed to accelerate as the last of your human features started to fade. You felt your ears grow rounded and furry as they shifted to the top of your head, while big new canines started to emerge inside your developing jaws. Not long after this your muzzle also finished pressing forwards, which then prompted long whiskers to emerge as your new nostrils flared for the first time.<br />
<br />
Finally, just as with Jessica, your eyes were the last thing to change as you felt your vision blur for a few moments. Then, once this was done, you felt the curse finally loosen its grip on you now that its work was done; leaving you as a complete, male, cougar!<br />
<br />
“There we are,” Nat said with a smile as she crouched down to get a good look at your new body, “you too look simply magnificent.” As Nat said this she ran her free hand through the hairs of your warm pelt as she started to inspect you like she had with Jessica.<br />
<br />
“Perfect!” Nat quickly declared as she released you, “both of you should blend in seamlessly.” Now then, let’s get you both loaded into the truck; then we can start putting our plan into motion.”<br />
<br />
With that, Nat beckoned you to follow her as she allowed Jessica to keep perching on her arm. She then led you out of the barn and over to an ominous black truck which was already prepared to transform you back to the Zoo.<br />
<br />
You and Jessica both looked at each other nervously as Nat motioned for you to head over to a large cage at the back of the truck. Of course, deep down you didn’t want to voluntarily surrender your freedom and put yourself behind bars. However, you knew that you had now committed to this crazy plan. It was now far too late to turn back…<br />
<br />
With your mind made up, you steeled yourself before heading up the ramp leading into the truck. You then settled down inside the cage that was waiting for you inside, before Nat finally sealed it shut with a strong lock and padlock. Not long after this, Nat then helped ease Jessica into a smaller cage before that too was securely locked and bolted.    <br />
<br />
“Right then you two,” Nat said as she headed for the ramp, “just remember the plan and everything will be fine. Come the morning you and your loved ones will be free, and we will be one step closer to taking down the Zoo for good.”<br />
<br />
With that, Nat nodded to you both before exiting the truck and sealing it shut. Your nerves started to get the better of you as you heard the truck’s engine roaring to life and you started to pull away. <br />
<br />
This was it. You were heading back to the Zoo once again; only this time you were much better prepared for the horrors that you knew lay in store. ‘Just stick to the plan,’ you told yourself, ‘and hope that Nat knows what the hell she’s doing…’</p>
