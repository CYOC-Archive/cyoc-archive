<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Corey didn't know what came over him but he felt as if any vestige of his previous manhood was slipping away.<br />
<br />
He slid his lithe new body up Greg's until they were face to face. Corey kissed Greg long and hard. His lips felt so soft and warm. As he slowly parted them he pushed Corey's apart too. Placing his hands just above Corey's hips he felt Greg take control, even bent down from his height to reach his lips. They melted into each other, Corey's slender frame into Greg's powerful physique, as Corey felt Greg's strength lead him. Slowly he felt the soft velvet touch of Greg's tongue inside his now female lips, then Greg played with the tip of Corey's own, much smaller tongue. His hands wandered lower and he gripped Corey's wide hips, pulling him closer. Corey's own hands wondered onto Greg's hard stomach, gripping the folds in his shirt and caressing his taught muscles beneath. Corey thought about how his hands felt so small, almost dainty im comparison to Greg's size. <br />
<br />
Greg's kiss became more passionate as their tongues entertwined. Pulling Corey's waist close into him Greg raised Corey's hands to  his own chest, as Corey began to massage his firm pecs. They were toned and as firm as steel, much sexier than Corey's old body he thought to himself. Corey's body slowly flopped and he felt that tingling again between his legs. As Greg pulled Corey into him, he felt movement around his waist. Something was bulging into Corey around his midriff - he could guess what it was that was pressing into his soft flesh. The two began to Greg's bulky frame to behind his back to pull him closer. Corey felt a gaping void within himself and wanted to be so close to Greg to feel whole. Corey caressed his firm arse and hooked his short, thin but soft fingers into the belt of Greg's trousers.<br />
<br />
Then what felt like an electric pulse coursed through him. Greg had placed his hand on Corey's breast and he let out an involuntary moan as Greg massaged it through his bra. <br />
<br />
Corey just stared into Greg's eyes, thrilled and fascinated by the hungry look sparkling in them. &quot;I must be imagining things.&quot; He said quietly. &quot;I can't believe I'm getting so turned on by a new girl. But you're just so...gorgeous.&quot; He ran his hands over the curves of Corey's hips and kissed him again, firmly, deeply and passionately as those strong arms embraced him. Corey loved the feeling of his bulging arm muscles clamped around him and pulling him into that rock hard chest. He loved the hint of his smooth, tanned skin through his open shirt. He loved the way it felt so warm and inviting as he ran his small female hands over it.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're wonderful,&quot; was all he could manage.<br />
<br />
Greg pulled back and just smiled at that, slowly stripping. &quot;Relax and enjoy it.&quot; <br />
<br />
Once Corey was completely naked, he was nearly in heaven. &quot;God I'm sexy.&quot; he whispered to himself, posing even more and getting even more turned on. His nipples were so hard that they poked right out, feeling so intense when Greg or his great pecs rubbed against or touched them. And his crotch.... His new slit was so wet that it was dripping down his thigh. &quot;Holy shit.&quot;<br />
<br />
It didn't take long before Greg was licking, sucking and rubbing at Corey's new nipples again. Corey absolutely loved the sensations that they provided. They were so much like what he normally had when turned on as a guy, but completely different as well. It was like his whole body was wired up to his cock but his cock wasn't there! Every touch or caress from Greg sent a buzz throughout his body and brain. Absent-mindedly his hand dropped down to his crotch to play with himself as he and Greg writhed tightly together. They were like animals. <br />
<br />
After a few minutes Greg's legs forced Corey's wide and he let out a high-pitched yelp as Corey felt Greg's manhood press between them. Glancing down he saw Greg had as massive a cock as he could have guessed of his neighbour. Corey ran his hands over and around his powerful thighs, massaging them and teasing him by holding him back from his dripping sex. <br />
<br />
Then Corey raised his hands up to Greg's balls and finally his erection. It felt so odd to be handling a man's parts on another body which was not his own. His erection was massive, and Corey's small hands made it seem even bigger. He could barely get his hand around its girth and began to worry it would be too big for him.</p>
