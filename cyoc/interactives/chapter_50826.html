<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ironically, Anne DIDN'T know the religion of everyone within her new family. They were all <br />
decidedly NOT the same faith, nor the same facets of the same faith, and some who would <br />
had violently argued with some others over their theologies, but now peacefully accepted <br />
the other's philosophy within the pack. Anne was simply the only member of her theology <br />
who had chosen to risk going outside with the 'lady detective' out there.   <br />
<br />
And it was one big joke that nobody knew both the question and the punch-line to. <br />
<br />
Shortly after church Serenity sensed it. More uses of the game. One of the people from last <br />
night had used their turn on five new people, then one of those had used their turn again <br />
on five new people, then one of those on three new people.  <br />
<br />
'On the silver lining of the black cloud, at least the more the game's been used lately, the <br />
more keen my 'turn seismograph' has gotten.' <br />
<br />
 However, in spite of all of it, Serenity still couldn't tell that Anne had been one of those <br />
involved in the turns last night, she could only logically conclude she was not having met <br />
her before. And she -still- couldn't tell where the -where- was when a turn was used in <br />
Glendale. Then again, the sicko who had included her being able to sense when a turn was <br />
used had included it taunt her on what she could never use to return to being a Irishman. <br />
<br />
Serenity didn't bother to follow Anne, she went in the direction of the rich part of town, <br />
which only added proof to what Trevor had said, the wolf pack resided at the Smith Estate. <br />
It didn't feel right to call it a harem anymore. <br />
<br />
Serenity returned to where Trevor was still waiting, when he didn't say thing she asked,<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren't you wondering how it went?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;These ears aren't just for show.&quot; Trevor commented dryly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can still joke. That is a good thing.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever.&quot;<br />
<br />
The church was now mostly empty, and those that remained thought 'curse, don't talk <br />
about it, maybe it'll go away.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Let me ask you Trevor, do you CARE about those people who were turned into monsters?<br />
&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What should I care? I'm going to die anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So is everyone!!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I had my lifetime -STOLEN- from me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think you're the only one whose had their life stolen from them? There was a slew of <br />
child kidnappings a couple decades back before you were born little man! They couldn't <br />
find the children because the 'person' who doing so was using the Game to turn six year <br />
old into over-sized eighteen year old women regardless of original gender and selling <br />
them off to the highest bidder!!! Can you imagine having the mind of a child, confused <br />
and scared and suddenly having a body you weren't meant o have for over ten years, or <br />
not at all, and being treated as someone disposable sex object? Can you!&quot; <br />
<br />
Trevor sent said calmly, &quot;... starving children in Africa comparison huh? Mom used to do <br />
that too.&quot; <br />
<br />
Serenity backhanded him across one ear with an audible smack, &quot;Get over yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor shuddered, the tears were coming again. <br />
<br />
Serenity knelt down pushed on the cat's head and making him look into her eyes, &quot;Trevor, <br />
is this really what you want? Do you want to spent what precious time you have left <br />
lamenting it all?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... I don't even know when the clock is going to strike midnight, I can't even keep track of <br />
my birthday! I can't even tell my family they never raised me wrong and I never killed <br />
myself! And I can't do a damn thing about it!&quot; <br />
<br />
Paul nearby would have corrected his language, but had no desire upset the apple-cart. <br />
<br />
&quot;Then how about you focus on what you -can- change!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't change anything.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You found out where the wolves are living! Who knows how long that could have gone on <br />
otherwise! Trevor! You also kept a child from being alone from his family for the rest of <br />
his life... doesn't that count for anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor thought back to the little boy trapped in the body of a mouse he had had to <br />
actually -carry- in his mouth to keep them both from being eaten by the horde of rats <br />
that had sniffed them out as Trevor had found the lad a year the little boy had spent <br />
hiding. Unlike Trevor, the lad still had a human life time in terms of his Transform...<br />
<br />
&quot;No... it does count.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't expect you to stop feeling sad for everything you lost! But I do expect to accept <br />
that you're a part of this team as long as you're breathing! And no part of any team is <br />
worthless!&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor thought of his football team... how many times had he said the opposite to the <br />
bottom tier? How many had he said it to? <br />
<br />
&quot;You're right.&quot; Trevor replied at last. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'd say you've made some excellent progress, but I know that hearts don't mend in a day. <br />
So instead I'll just say you've taken a step in the right direction.&quot; <br />
<br />
The tabby Trevor looked up to see the black cat Judas sitting on the top of the seats. <br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Judas asked of the cat and human, &quot;What do you plan to do now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Serenity just stared, &quot;What did he say?&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor laughed, &quot;Come on, we know cats, I mean, regular cats don't talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
Serenity frowned, &quot;You were looking at him like you were listening not like you were <br />
confused. Now spill it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;.... Judas was asking what we plan to do now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;First I intend to show you a good time until you snap out of your funk so you're able to <br />
function once your leg has mended. And we also plan to find a person who has a turn of <br />
the game who isn't part of the wolves' pack. After that, Paul, me, -and you too Trevor- <br />
discuss the best way to neutralize the pack's master and subdue a small army of wolf <br />
women who'll fight to the death to protect their young. After that, using the game to <br />
restore their humanity and free will. And after -that-, using the powder to wipe out any <br />
traces of the game forever. I'll examine the powder's recipe to see if it has any toxic <br />
substances, -if it doesn't- we can just beg the city council to add it to the water supply <br />
and that'll kill the game once and for all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Most of what Serenity said went over Judas' peach sized brain, however, enough got <br />
through that he knew one thing. <br />
<br />
Judas leapt off the pews and onto an open stained glass window. <br />
<br />
&quot;Where are you going?&quot; Trevor meowed.  <br />
<br />
&quot;To find a human who isn't part of the wild dogs pack and has a Turn of The Game.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn't you tell me you were the pariah of every cat in town?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I still have some friends, a few connections, a couple favors from the sanctuary I maintain <br />
behind the church. It's not the biggest cat information network in Glendale, but it should <br />
churn up something... pray for my success.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right.&quot; Trevor nodded automatically in return. &quot;But-but why? Your human has an <br />
investment in this not you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... It's to help those in need who can't help themselves, I need another reason?&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor just stared as Judas left the church through the window. <br />
<br />
&quot;And that time?&quot; Madam Serenity asked calmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;He said... he's going to try and find a human who has a turn of the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
Serenity was surprised, &quot;He's hoping he finds one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually...&quot; Trevor said feeling awkward, &quot;He asked us to pray on that.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
With Pearl and June flanking him, Zack was playing Risk with Lawrence and Rodger when it <br />
happened. The ringing. The noise Zack had worried about hearing ever since his <br />
transformation. He let it ring, not picking it up. The other wolves all looked at him oddly, <br />
and immediately ordered Pearl NOT to pick it up for him.  It rang one more time, then <br />
Zylphia's cell phone got a new voice mail.<br />
<br />
&quot;You still have that thing?&quot; Roger asked, &quot;You can't get coverage if you don't exist.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not like you, the glitch left my parents knowing I still exist.&quot; Zack replied simply he, <br />
VERY CAREFULLY typed in his password with his claws and  listened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Zylphia! Where are you? It's not like you not to have your phone with you!&quot; Said the voice <br />
of his mother. &quot;This is a reminder that your father and I will be back home tonight and I <br />
hope you're there to greet us. See you soon honey.&quot;<br />
<br />
The phone clicked off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Zackery dear?&quot; Pearl asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;....tonight it is then...&quot; Zack said simply.<br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Of course, Caroline and the Gemstone colored wolves couldn't visit the island retreat <br />
selected by Jensen to host a herd of free range deer and a community of wolf people until <br />
after Alice and the other glass wolves returned from their apparently play day exploring <br />
their universe. Hopefully they wouldn't out late: with Martha with them that shouldn't be a <br />
problem, in particular if she realized that lunch was around the corner. <br />
<br />
Jensen found somewhere deep down he couldn't blame his daughters, after all, it was <br />
Sunday, the day of rest and all that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Master! Master! Look at me!&quot; Jensen was started as his plans at the excited and charged <br />
voice of Caroline. <br />
<br />
&quot;Look at me Master! Look at me! Now I really am part of the portion of our pack destine to <br />
look over and maintain our sanctuary away from Glendale!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen did look, and he was very surprised, &quot;How precisely did this happen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not sure Master! I think it has something to do with me using 'we' in the Transform I <br />
used to bring Opal and the rest into our pack! Oh Master don't I look wonderful?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Like the other gemstone colored wolves, Caroline's eyes were now a solid color the same <br />
as her fur with no visible whites or centers. Also her fur now had a slight sheen to it that <br />
wasn't there before. As she twirl around to give her Alpha Male a better view, he saw the <br />
white flower mark on her back. Oh, and she now had the same full long hair the rest had. <br />
Jensen wondered if her maternal material was also bigger but he hadn't paid precise <br />
attention to that in Caroline's case before so he couldn't tell one way or the other. <br />
<br />
&quot;This isn't have happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Master?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Think about it Caroline, you were the speaker, there was no logical reason for the game <br />
to effect YOU.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually Master I was thinking, my name is now Cobalt, to match the rest.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen remembered the children's book on a 'Coraline' who a witch promised her all the <br />
games and happiness Coraline could want if only Coraline let the witch sow buttons in <br />
Coraline's eyes. She strangely felt something similar here. <br />
<br />
&quot;... Caroline, Cobalt, whatever, the point is, this isn't how the game works... the asker is <br />
NEVER transformed. Ever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you,&quot; The dark blue wolf looked disappointed, &quot;Not like me this way?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not about you, it's about the game's rules going wonkey. Do you still love me and your <br />
pack?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Both to the ends of the Earth my Master.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And any changes in your mind you can tell at all?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I'm starting to get the knowledge that I gave the others, but I'm not sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen sighed. &quot;BEATRICE!&quot; <br />
<br />
The plain green she wolf was there in a matter of seconds, &quot;Yes Master how may I-WHAO! <br />
What happened to you Caroline? OTher Mother get you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That girl was named CORALline and no and my name is now-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The moment Alice gets back you're to tell her that she's to speak with Zackery and go <br />
over precise how he's going to speak his Transform to his parents whenever they come <br />
and spot any bugs or loopholes -at all-. Be sure tell Zack he isn't to even THINK about <br />
Transforming his parents until he's gone over the Transform with Alice!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master! Anything else?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;None of the pack are to use the game unless they've gotten permission from me and have <br />
spoken what they'll say with Alice, OR have a shotgun pointed between their eyes with <br />
their backs against a wall or a similar inescapable situation with threats to the pack. This <br />
order stands until further notice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master!&quot; Beatrice was gone in a flash.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have any of the other she wolves the gems or you have interacted with changed at all?&quot; <br />
Jensen asked the dark blue wolf.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not in the least Master.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. A run away glitch in the game is the last thing we need.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As you say my Master, I am sorry this happened if it upset you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's nothing, just be sure to follow my instructions and deliver my instructions to the new <br />
wolves as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes My Master.&quot;</p>
