<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the 2015 Moon Lake Halloween Party/Dance reached its midnight conclusion at the high school gym, the werewolf disc jockey began his last set of the night by first playing encores of &#9835;Monster Mash&#9835; by Bobby (Boris) Pickett and the Crypt-Kickers before Warren Zevon sang about the &#9835;Werewolves of London&#9835;, although there were not as many lupines in the gym to howl along with the tune as there were the last time it played.<br />
Then the DJ closed the night with Michael Jackson&#39;s &#9835;Thriller&#9835;, timing the song just right so that Vincent Price&#39;s portion was correct when he said, <i>The Midnight Hour is close at hand.</i><br />
Just as the late horror star&#39;s laugh faded through the speakers, the sounds of a clock rang out through the gym. Only the Disc Jockey knew it was just a recording of Big Ben&#39;s famous chimes striking 12, but as the last chime rang, the DJ turned on his microphone and said, &quot;Okay bats and ghouls. It&#39;s been a surreal gas. Xenon, Argon, and all the rest. Hope you all had a devilishly good time. Take care getting back to your crypts or wherever you&#39;re planning to haunt next.&quot;<br />
Then he gave one last long howl, imitating the famous radio personality he was dressed up as for the evening, before the DJ turned everything off and started packing up his equipment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Care to walk me home, Mister Anderson?&quot; his boyfriend Alex Ramsey asked, smiling at his fellow werewolf.<br />
&quot;It would be my pleasure,&quot; replied Nate, holding out his paw.<br />
Alex happily took it, before they smooched and started to leave the gym.<br />
They only stopped long enough to say good night to Nate&#39;s younger brother Eric, who was getting ready to leave with his fiance, Julie Stovall.<br />
&quot;You two have a great night,&quot; Nate said, while smiling at the couple.<br />
&quot;We will,&quot; Julie said, while grabbing Eric&#39;s hand in hers. &quot;You too.&quot;<br />
&quot;Definitely,&quot; said Alex, before the couples left the gym together.<br />
Outside, they parted company. Alex and Nate heading to the Ramsey&#39;s house for the rest of their night together, while Julie and Eric headed off toward the fresh water swimming pool in the Stovall&#39;s backyard.<br />
Along the way, Julie and Eric continued to hold webbed hands like any were-mer couple in love.<br />
Eric was carrying the rest of his costume in his free hand, while Julie had her purse in her free hand.<br />
&quot;I had a great time tonight darling,&quot; said Julie, before kissing him on the cheek, &quot;but there is one thing you should do for our future.&quot;<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that, my jewel?&quot; he asked in return.<br />
&quot;In the future, consider boxers instead of briefs,&quot; she suggested. &quot;While briefs are more practical for swimming, provided you even bother to wear anything at all in the water, you don&#39;t want them hurting any of your... little swimmers before we start having children,&quot; added Julie, before reaching down to briefly caress Eric&#39;s manhood trapped within the cloth covering.<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; said Eric, even as he felt his face start to blush.<br />
After he recovered, Eric asked, &quot;Speaking of children, have you had any dreams or thoughts on whether or not we&#39;ll have any more besides our future Eric Junior and Melinda?&quot;<br />
They had shared prophecy dreams of the day when Julie would become his Mrs. Anderson after high school graduation, and when they would start a family after both had graduated college and had their respective adult careers underway.<br />
But with both of them being just 14 and Freshmen in high school, that was still a long way off.<br />
&quot;No. You?&quot; Julie asked in return.<br />
&quot;No. Just wondering. Do you think we&#39;re destined to just have the two?&quot;<br />
&quot;Your guess is as good as mine. Would you like to have more?&quot; she asked cautiously.<br />
&quot;Maybe. After all, us weres do have an average lifespan of around 400 years,&quot; replied Eric. Although he was originally born a normal human being, Eric no longer thought in those terms since becoming Julie&#39;s were-merman and was looking forward to a bright and wonderful future together with the love of his life. &quot;I think Junior and Melinda will be getting on with their own lives long before we reach 100, don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
Julie agreed, but then realized something. &quot;It&#39;s that spawning urge again, isn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Possibly,&quot; conceded Eric. &quot;Then again, considering how I feel about you...&quot; he said, before pulling her close and passionately kissing Julie, now far from the shy, reserved young boy he was before moving to Moon Lake.<br />
Among their abilities, were-mers have discovered that they can kiss for a longer period of time than other weres before needing a fresh breath.<br />
But when their lips did finally part, Julie looked at him and said, &quot;Don&#39;t worry darling. I took today&#39;s were-mermaid birth control pill late, so I&#39;m safe till around 3 tomorrow afternoon, so we can have all the spawning fun we want as soon as we get to the pool.&quot;<br />
Then she kissed him on the cheek, smiled at Eric, and then yelled, &quot;Race you!&quot; before Julie took off running down the sidewalk.<br />
They had already made the turn onto her block, so Eric just smiled and took off after his fiance.<br />
<br />
When they reached the Stovall residence, the kids didn&#39;t bother going through the house. Instead they raced around to the side and went through the backyard gate.<br />
Securing it behind them, Eric and Julie started hastily taking off all of their remaining clothes, even as they continued to the edge of the pool.<br />
Were-merman and were-mermaid, now naked except for the single pearl necklace Julie proudly wore around her neck signifying their engagement, were about to jump in, when they spotted a familiar couple at the bottom of the pool doing what they planned to do.<br />
&quot;Mom and dad?&quot; Julie said, staring at her parents having sex in the deep end.<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t see a car in the driveway,&quot; commented Eric.<br />
&quot;They must have parked in the garage before going through the house to get here, because I don&#39;t see a trail of clothes either,&quot; she replied.<br />
Instead of just jumping right in like they originally planned, Eric and Julie walked around to the shallow end and used the steps to enter the freshwater, for aquatic weres can&#39;t stand chemicals in what they swim in.<br />
There, the two of them went further into the pool until their heads were underwater, which didn&#39;t affect were-mer activities in the least.<br />
Once submerged, Julie smiled while shifting from her Stage 2 to Stage 3 form, displaying her full tail.<br />
Eric did the same, even as Julie reached out to caress the place where his shaft was starting to emerge from its hiding place in hid tail.<br />
The young couple kissed and were about to join together as one, when a voice asked, &quot;It&#39;s after midnight already?&quot;<br />
Since were-mers can see, hear, speak, and breathe underwater as easily as on dry land, they simply turned and saw her mother waving and smiling at them, even as her husband continued to pound his hard cock deep into her vagina from behind, since they were only in their Stage 2 forms at the moment, with the legs still separate entities instead of whole tails.<br />
&quot;Having fun mom?&quot; Julie asked, although the question was quite redundant.<br />
&quot;Yes. We were at the Halloween Party, planning to have a good time there, when suddenly your father wanted to rush back here and ravish me like there was no tomorrow,&quot; replied Melissa Stovall, not knowing that her husband Martin had a cup of the punch spiked with Alice Decrux&#39;s <i>Love Potion #9</i>.*<br />
&quot;I haven&#39;t heard you complain once since we dived in,&quot; said Martin, even as he continued to fuck his wife.<br />
<br />
Were society has no nudity taboos.<br />
Eric had already encountered this situation before, but had no problem watching other weres enjoy themselves physically.<br />
While he had absolutely no interest in his future mother-in-law sexually, sometimes Eric liked seeing Mrs. Stovall au natural, for thoughts of how Julie would look in the future ran through his mind.<br />
Mother and daughter were just two different versions of the same woman, as far as he was concerned. While Eric already knew how beautiful his fiance was, the fact that in time Julie&#39;s breasts would be bigger, her curves more sexier than they already were, and all the other advantages of her becoming an adult were-mermaid were something he greatly looked forward too.<br />
<br />
Julie was totally unfazed by seeing her parents in their natural state, let alone engaged in what seemed to be the favorite activity of were society.<br />
She had already swam with them plenty of times, each proudly displaying their tails and scales underwater either alone or with other were-mers.<br />
Sex was a given fact of life, considering that&#39;s how future weres were created and that she was now quite sexually active herself with her fiance.<br />
With that fact in mind, Julie turned to face Eric and smiled before she closed her eyes and said, &quot;Marco.&quot;<br />
But instead of starting a round of the water based Hide and Seek game, Eric swam right up to Julie and said, &quot;Polo,&quot; even as he wrapped his arms lovingly around her as the tip of his hard penis started to enter its proper slit in the front of her tail.<br />
The lovers kissed and embraced, even as Julie felt herself grow full of her future husband&#39;s were-manhood.<br />
Then they simply sank to the bottom of the pool and enjoyed each other&#39;s company for the rest of the night, even as her parents continued to physically express their love for each other.<br />
