<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At first, he hadn&#39;t really notice anything off. His summer seemed on track to progress as confusing as it had started. And by the end of the second week of July, Jon was even more confused and troubled than when he&#39;d first became aware of what was happening to him. Brushing an errant strand of hair from his face, he huffed as he stared at his reflection.<br />
<br />
It, for reasons he hadn’t fully worked out, didn’t bother him with how his hair now looked. Having grown out longer, fuller, taken on a more female look, Jon had initially wanted to cut it, as the Parkers had offered to allow him to do, if he wanted. But, the more he considered doing so, the more he couldn’t bring himself to have it snipped down to how he usually had it cut. Absently reaching for a brush and a Scrunchie, he pulled the hair tie over his hand to rest around his wrist before starting to run the brush through his hair.<br />
<br />
Thoughts on how he might style it, something which bugged him, as he now knew he didn&#39;t know how many ways to do up his now long hair, some of which he&#39;d swear were cute, he tried not to dwell too much on it as he gazed at the face reflected back at him. A couple days or so ago, he&#39;d noticed something was off about his face, and it&#39;d taken him a bit before it clicked. Now, staring at it, seeing how much it&#39;d transformed since he&#39;d first noticed the change, he stopped what he was doing and turned his head one way, then another. Seeing a face which was clearly a girl&#39;s face, he huffed as he observed how even his eyebrows had thinned. Starting to run the brush through his hair again, Jon&#39;s thoughts drifted to other hair-covered areas of his body.<br />
<br />
Not being overly hairy to begin with, he already had a smattering of hair on his legs and arms, as well as in his pits. Most of what he had on his chest was centred around his pecs, whilst the stuff he had covering his crotch, whilst not super thick, was enough. Or, at least it had been. Around the same time he became aware of how the hair on his head was getting longer, softer, fuller, Jon had become aware of the way his body hair was lessening. Starting with his leg and arm hair, the issue had widened to include his underarms, then his chest, and lastly, or so he thought, to his face. Left with smooth, bare skin, he wasn&#39;t happy with this, especially when he noticed how his eyebrows had begun to morph.<br />
<br />
This of course all paled in comparison to the pubic hair covering his cock and balls. Gradually lightening in colour, the stuff had even seemed to become softer as if shifted until he was left with a patch of hair he&#39;d never want show off after getting undressed in a locker room. &quot;Not that I can,&quot; he thought as he finished brushing his hair, then proceeded to use the Scrunchie to do his hair up into something cute.<br />
<br />
Brush returned to where it normal was on the sink, he stared at his reflection a bit longer. Wanting to take his hair down, to have it cut, he still could bring himself to do any of this as he stared at a person who looked female from the neck up. Sighing as he made this observation, his thoughts drifted to how the Parkers had noticed this as well, had asked him if he&#39;d start HRT, to which, after figuring out what they were talking about, replied he wasn&#39;t. In addition, Dr Deks had noticed, which led her to begin inquiring why he&#39;d grown his hair out, why he trimmed his eyebrows, if he was happy with the way his appearance, and a bunch of other questions he&#39;d tried to explain he hadn&#39;t done anything, except let his hair grow out, though he couldn&#39;t bring himself to tell her he didn&#39;t want it cut. Complimenting on what he&#39;d done, Jon was rather put-off by the whole session, as Dr Deks had taken it as he&#39;d done this to himself and it confirmed he wanted to be a girl.<br />
<br />
With a last glance at his reflection, still unable to bring himself to undo how he had done his hair up, Jon huffed and left the bathroom. Heading downstairs, glad nobody else was around, Jon grabbed a bowl, spoon, poured himself some cereal, and went to go sit out on the patio and eat his breakfast. Splashing milk over the cereal, he didn&#39;t tuck in right away. Letting his thoughts wander, he again tried to find a possible cause for what was happening to him. Thinking back over the last two months, the differences in his life, how he&#39;d tried to apologise to Denise and Mrs Parker for his past behaviour, hoping by doing so it&#39;d stop, maybe reverse, what was happening to him, but even this hadn’t worked. Still unable to determine what might be causing what was going on to him, he reached for the spoon, but paused when a voice called out, &quot;Jon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Whoever it was speaking, he didn&#39;t recognise their voice, and looking in the direction of the speaker, he saw a girl he couldn&#39;t tell if she was rather masculine or not standing in the backyard. Breakfast forgotten, he stared at this person, positive he&#39;d never seen them before. And then, they said, &quot;Fuck. You look worse off than the last time I saw you,&quot; and seeing the perplexed look he had on their face, the girl told him, &quot;You probably don&#39;t recognise me, but, it&#39;s me. Billy.&quot;</p>
