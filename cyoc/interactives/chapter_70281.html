<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had been three days since Connor had woken up in what he was thinking as his girly nightmare. Everyone, his mom, his sister, treated him like a girl. He found that he enjoyed being treated like a girl and that he liked acting like a girl. He found himself constantly caught up in the activities that normally only a girl would enjoy. He found himself overwhelmed, in a good way, by the clothes that he had to wear. And the more he resisted, the more it seemed that he gave in.<br />
<br />
Frustrated, he found himself once again wondering what he'd done to deserve be thrust into being an eight year old girl. Glancing down at the swimsuit he was wearing, light blue, except along the sides, shoulder straps and betwixt his legs, which was dark blue, with white swirl patterns, he sighed in frustration at how much of a girl he actually looked like and how he didn't even need to tuck his privates back when wearing the swimsuit because of how small they were. Sticking out of a specially cut hole, Connor could feel his tail idly moving back and forth and glancing up, he took in the lake that spread out before him, trying to focus his thoughts and find some answers.<br />
<br />
&quot;You coming in or are you just going to stand there,&quot; a voice, with just a hint of laughter in it, interrupted his thoughts and glancing in the direction, he saw his sister, now four years old than him, treading water.<br />
<br />
Smiling, Connor took a deep breath and before Hadley could say anything else, he jumped off the pier and into the semi-cold June water. Surfacing, getting his bearings, Connor spied Hadley, who immediately called out, &quot;Race you to the Buoy Marker, Caeleah,&quot; and than started swimming out farther and finding himself troubled by the feeling that he was slipping, he called out, &quot;Wait up. You know I can't swim as good as you.&quot;<br />
<br />
After a couple hours, Connor climbed out of the water and reached for the beach towel he'd brought along. As he started to dry off his hair, something he found took longer to do now due to its increased length, Hadley slipped out of the water and grabbed her towel.<br />
<br />
Noting that she was wearing a bikini and how her body was developing, Connor suddenly found himself wondering if he'd ever look as beautiful as his big sister. Embarrassed at what he'd been thinking and hoping, Connor wrapped the towel around his body, just below his armpits, as Hadley said, &quot;Hurry back up to the house. I am sure mom is wondering what is keeping you as you know that you have that doctor's appointment today,&quot; as she began to dry herself off<br />
<br />
Connor, nodding, started up towards the house, wishing Hadley hadn't reminded him about the appointment. It was, he knew, to make sure that nothing strange was happening, besides the growth of a dog's tail and ears, that everything was proceeding as perfectly as possible and whether he'd be ready to start phase two soon.<br />
<br />
Sliding open the patio door, Connor was immediately greeted by his mother, who told him, &quot;Strip.&quot;<br />
<br />
The feeling of embarrassment creeping over him, Connor wondered how he could get out of stripping in front of his mother and after a couple seconds, seeing no way, he hastily began pulling off his swimsuit. As he did this, he mother handed him a pair of underwear, which was loose enough for him to place his tail between his legs, a skirt and a t-shirt with a purple pony on the front.<br />
<br />
Dropping the clothes on a nearby chair, Connor started to pull on the shirt first and than the underwear, torn between liking that he was wearing girl's underwear and despising that he was wearing something suitable for the opposite sex and that his own male genitals looked like something you'd find on a new-born. As Connor reached for the skirt, Hadley came in and announced, &quot;I'm going over to Ren's place,&quot; as their mother started pulling a brush through Connor's hair, being careful around his ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;No boys,&quot; their mother commented, to which Hadley grimaced and than disappeared up to her room.<br />
<br />
Placing a bow in Connor's hair, which covered up the dog-ears, he was told, &quot;Get your sandals on and than go out to the car,&quot; to which Connor nodded in compliance and headed for the backdoor.<br />
<br />
Slipping his feet into the small sandals, he gazed at the clothes he was wearing. Thinking how everything pieced of girl's clothing that was his had been adjusted to accommodate somebody with a tail. Thinking, &quot;My underwear, shorts, pants, swimsuits and dresses either have a hole cut in them or are loose enough for me to keep my tail between my legs,&quot; and disturbed how much he liked wearing girl's clothing, Connor immediately pushed the subject from his mind and headed out to the car.<br />
***<br />
<br />
Sitting in the waiting room, Connor idly flipped through a magazine that clearly aimed at a female target audience, but enjoying the contents within, stopping every once in a bit to glance at the two other people waiting with him.<br />
<br />
One was a boy who had the nose, whiskers and eyes of a cat, Sitting next to a woman with a very haughty look on her face, who Connor thought must the boy's mother. The other person occupying the waiting room was somebody who had horse ears, cat eyes and a dog's tongue lolling out and appeared to be neither male nor female. Sitting next to that person was a man and a woman, both frowning.<br />
<br />
As the androgynous let loose a barking-mew, Connor turned his attention back to the magazine he was reading, an article on a new boy-band catching his attention, he found himself glad that he didn't have that kid's problem and that the drug had only given him dog ear's and tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Caeleah?&quot; a woman's voice called and glancing up, Connor saw the doctor his memories told him he had been seeing since had been a toddler.<br />
<br />
Standing, finding that he knew what was coming, Connor barely heard his mother saying, &quot;I'll be waiting right here, sweetheart,&quot; as he followed the doctor through the door, down a hallway and into a medical bay, where he was immediately guided to a table and told, &quot;Please remove all of your clothes and lie face down on the bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor, finding himself once again embarrassed, started to comply and shucking off his shirt, he folded it and placed it on a nearby chair. His skirt, underwear and sandals followed next and naked as the day he'd been born, he lay down on the bed, as instructed and shortly, the doctor returned, this time carrying a tray of instruments in one hand an a metal chart in the other. Setting down the tray, she pulled on a pair of gloves and approaching Connor she asked, &quot;Have you noticed anything out of the ordinary, Caeleah,&quot; as she began to examine first his tail and than his anus.<br />
<br />
Wanting to ask if waking up to find that you've gone from a fifteen year old boy to an eight year old male-to-female transsexual with dogs ears and a tail was considered out of the ordinary, Connor instead shook his head as he figured the doctor wouldn't fully understand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything looks good here,&quot; the doctor announced and stripping off the gloves she was wearing, she told him, &quot;Spread your legs,&quot; as she put on a new pair.<br />
<br />
Following her instructions, Connor immediately felt her gently probing the area between his legs, commenting, &quot;Hmmm,&quot; every once and a bit. Tapping his leg, she told him, &quot;Roll over,&quot; to which Connor did so, and immediately felt her running a hand over his penis and testicles.<br />
<br />
A clattering noise caused him to glance up and as he watched her put on a pair of magnified glasses, he was told, &quot;Lie back,&quot; as the doctor returned to examining first his penis and testicles and than the area between his legs. Afterward, she had him sit up and tested his reflexes by hitting a rubbed hammer against his knees, listened to him breath and than told him, &quot;Stand up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doing as directed, Connor stared straight ahead as she started at his neck and slowly worked her way down, checking and probing every square inch of his body. When she finished checking the soles of his feet, she returned her attention to Connor's nipples and after a moment she told him, &quot;Squat down.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Connor did this, the doctor ran a hand over his abdomen in certain area, checked his nipples a third time and than investigated the area between his legs. When she finished doing this a couple times, she removed her gloves, tossed them away and donned a fresh pair. Leaning in close, she began to look at Connor's head, paying particularly close attention to his ears.<br />
<br />
When she finished with that, she took off the magnified glasses and picked up an instrument for examining the interior of the ear. After announcing, &quot;No excess build-up,&quot; she began to examine Connor's face, taking her time when she looked at the side of his head, where his human ears used to be, and when she looked into his eyes. When she'd finally finished, she told him, &quot;You may put your clothes back on,&quot; and as he did this, she began to prepare a hypodermic needle.<br />
<br />
Seeing the worried look on Connor's face, she smiled and said, &quot;Relax. It will only hurt for a moment and than it will be over.&quot;<br />
<br />
A nod from Connor, who looked the other way as the doctor tied a band around his upper arm, swabbed the area just below the elbow joint and than asked, &quot;Ready?&quot; and before Connor could nod, she plunged the needle into his arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;There,&quot; she said after a couple seconds and looking over, Connor watched as she put a pink Band-Aid on his arm.<br />
<br />
Reaching for a plastic jar, the doctor handed it to Connor and told him, &quot;I need you to fill this up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly realising that he had a really full bladder, Connor nodded once again and knowing where to go, turned and walked across the room to a closed door. Letting himself into the bathroom, Connor headed for the toilet, were he pushed down his underwear and squatting down, holding the jar just below his penis, he let his bladder loose.<br />
<br />
When he finally stopped, Connor pushed the jar away and immediately reached for some toilet paper. As he patted himself dry, he asked himself, &quot;Why am I doing this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Unable to come up with a reason, only knowing that he was supposed to, Connor finished, pulled up his underwear and washed his hands. Returning to the examination room, he handed the jar to the doctor, who told him to wash his hands and doing so, he took a seat in the chair when he'd finished.<br />
<br />
After a couple minutes, Connor's mother walked in and handing the magazine he'd been reading a bit ago, she asked, &quot;Everything all right?&quot; to which he shrugged.<br />
<br />
As she took a seat on another chair, she commented, &quot;Doctor says we'll have the test results in about half an hour,&quot; something Connor already knew, but didn't comment on as he turned his attention to the magazine his mother had handed him.<br />
***<br />
<br />
Half an hour later his doctor came back and setting down the chart, she explained, &quot;I'd like Caeleah to come back in a month, instead of three months.&quot;<br />
<br />
Setting down her magazine, Connor's mother asked, &quot;Is everything all right?&quot;<br />
<br />
A nod from the doctor and as she flipped open the chart, she explained, &quot;I've noticed some unusual growth between Caeleah's legs. That, and her penis and testicles have already begun to show scabbing,&quot; and seeing the look on Connor's face, she added, &quot;Don't work. It will be just like when your umbilical cord fell off. You mother can tell you all about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;What I think I am seeing is the new growth of the vulva, which shouldn't be happening for another year or two. It might be the pills. It might be what caused the initial mutation of the ears and tail. Either way, I'd like to run an ultra-sound test in a month to see if there is any growth within the body. Specifically, the growth of the reproduction organs. If there are, I am going to be changing your pills, Caeleah, to Phita-3 and starting you on half a yellow pill.&quot;<br />
<br />
Flipping to another page, she continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am also seeing a growth in the chest area, specifically in the development of the nipples,&quot; and glancing at Connor, she asked, &quot;Have you been feeling any sensitivity in your nipples or area around your nipples?&quot;<br />
<br />
Thinking, Connor shook his head and his Doctor flipped to another page and said, &quot;I am also noticing a small development in four other area of the chest. Switching to Phita-3 might clear up this, but without more test, I cannot be certain. Especially as these test would have to be done when Caeleah is around the age of eleven to thirteen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What development?&quot; Connor's mother asked.<br />
<br />
Flipping to another page, the doctor explained, &quot;It appears Caeleah is developing four more nipples. Now, as I said, Phita-3 might clear this up. But it also might not clear it up. It might have been something left over from Alpha-7, before being switched to Gamma-2.<br />
<br />
&quot;It should also be noted, and I cannot say for a hundred percent sure, but this always might effect your reproductive tract. In this case, you would go into heat, much like a dog, two times a year. But I cannot say for sure until more tests are done. And those tests will have to wait till you're older.&quot; Flipping to another page, she continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your blood work shows you are developing fine. Your hormone levels are right where they are supposed to be for an eight-year old girl. There are some minor traces of dog, specifically Bull Terrier, but that is to be expected when looking at your ears and tail.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tuning out what the doctor was saying, knowing that the rest of what she had to say was that he was pretty much a healthy girl, Connor glanced down and thought about the tail he had, the fact that he was developing a vulva and that his penis and testicles where going to fall off, much the same way his umbilical cord had. Suddenly scared, wanting both not to become a girl but also to become a girl, Connor silently asked himself, &quot;How did I get into this mess? What did I do to deserve this and how do I undo it before it becomes to late?&quot; as his doctor said, &quot;Than I will see you next month.&quot;</p>
