<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eric was just laughing over a joke from Zack when he suddenly felt wrong. He couldn´t say what was wrong, just that something was. Looking around, he spotted nothing that could explain it. An urge made itself known, and Eric stood up and left the room without a word, confusing the others. Normally Eric wouldn´t just leave the group like that. But they shrugged it off and continued to have fun.<br />
<br />
“Why do I feel like I need to be in the bathroom? I don´t need to go.” Eric thought confused. The urge pulled him towards the bathroom without a reason, just the need to be there. “Need to find owner” was the answer his mind pushed out, and Eric mentally recoiled. “What owner? I don´t have an owner, I´m not a dog.”<br />
<br />
But the urge got stronger, making him walk a bit faster towards the bathroom. “My owner waits for me, needs me.” Eric couldn´t explain those thoughts that came in unwanted and were so wrong. At the same time, something about having an owner felt right to it. Things had owners, right? Again, Eric recoiled, he wasn´t a thing … right? Why was he questioning itself?<br />
<br />
Eric pushed open the bathroom door and stepped inside. His eyes widened at seeing Ryan standing there, naked and grinning. He pushed the door shut behind him while asking loudly: “What the hell is happening? Why are you naked?”<br />
<br />
Ryan grinned even wider, an evil glint in his eyes. “I have waited for you, Eric. After all, I need my new clothes, right?”<br />
<br />
Eric looked a bit confused. Who was Eric? That wasn´t his name … right? No, his name was … why couldn´t he remember? But instead of asking about that, it answered: “Yes, here it is, owner.” in a monotone voice. Mentally he panicked. What was happening with him? What had his owner done to it?<br />
<br />
Ryan laughed as he realized something. “Sorry, but not sorry, but I think I did erase a bit too much from your profile, but don´t worry, that wasn´t important. After all, why would my clothes need their own name, right? Or an age or gender?”<br />
<br />
The still human looking clothes gasped, realizing that its owner was right. It had no recollection of its former name, and as it thought about its age, all that came up was that he was new, but no real age.<br />
Before it could do anything, its clothes vanished, leaving the clothing … human naked. And in another blink of its eyes, it felt weak and lost its balance, tilting towards Ryan. It closed its eyes in fear, only for them to vanish, along with the other features on its head. Its hair was sucked into his skull, only for the bald head to open, forming one big hole around the high its ears had been. Its neck was divided into two openings for the legs, slightly pushed outwards, disconnecting it from the rest of the body. The newly formed boxer briefs turned black as they hollowed out, leaving only the cloth itself behind.<br />
<br />
In seconds Eric´s old body changed into the clothes Ryan had programmed it to become. Its hands balled into fists, the gaps between the fingers closing, forming a blob like mitten. Its wrists bend, forming the heel of the socks, before everything up to the elbows turned a light blue color, disconnecting from the upper arms.<br />
<br />
Its bare feet become wider a bit, as Ryan´s feet were a bit bigger. Its toes merged, forming a round end of the sneakers. The top split open with small holes along the edge and a piece of flesh on the inside becoming the tongue. From the inside shoelaces wormed their way outside and into the holes, closing the shoes top again. The sole hardened and gained a profile, turning white. While the round end, the heel and the shoelaces were also white, the sides and top become a dark blue color, and the rim above the ankle turned a lighter blue color.<br />
<br />
Its legs hollowed out, losing any indication to recognize them as legs as the knees vanish. The area behind its genitals ripped open before closing with a newly formed zipper, which then was hidden by a fold of skin. The skin itself turned blue and more robust, as on its hips and ass checks small pocket opened. They separated from both its former feet turned sneakers at their new rim, as well as its torso just above its new button, formed out of the belly button, where it had grown out.<br />
<br />
The genitals had flattened and turned metallic, forming into three dog tags on a chain. The cock one was slightly bigger than the two formed from Eric´s former balls, the chain made from the skin its scrotum had been. It simply dropped away from the now closed zipper behind it.<br />
<br />
Its torso also ripped open and turned black, with holes on one side and skull-looking buttons on the other side. The back turned out slightly thicker than the rest, as Ryan´s wished white skull formed, raised from the black leather the rest of the jacket was made of. It gained features and with the raised material gained a 3D look to it.<br />
<br />
Ryan catches his jacket and boxers, while the socks drop and the jeans rushed down. A light metallic sound signaled the dog tag necklace hitting the ground as well.<br />
With a wide grin, Ryan started to put on his newly made clothes. He stepped into the boxers, slowly pulling them up, enjoying the thought about Eric´s reaction to it. He patted his now hidden cock satisfied, knowing it would be where Eric´s mouth had been before.<br />
The socks followed, and he fantasied about the massage Eric´s hands were giving his feet. He slipped on the jeans and put on the sneakers, already loving how comfortable they feel. After a few steps, feeling like walking on clouds, Ryan sighed satisfied. Eric was such good clothes, better than the annoying kid he had been.<br />
<br />
Ryan noticed his small error than. Nothing of Eric´s body had become a new shirt for him. So, he was forced to retake his normal one, but smiled when he pulled the jacket above it. As the final touch, Ryan put the dog tags around his neck, playing a bit with them, grinning.<br />
<br />
At the same time, the former Eric was split between a couple of emotions. The part of him that saw itself as Ryan´s clothing was happy to be worn, satisfied its owner found him comfortable. The other part, what was left of the former human, was horrified for being turned into clothing, and disgusted by being worn. It could taste Ryan´s body, his manhood, as well as smell it and the sweat his body gave. It had no idea why Ryan playing with the tags felt so good, though.<br />
<br />
Ryan altered two small things before leaving the bathroom. One, nobody would think his clothes had been changed, he had them on before heading to the bathroom. So, even if one of them would connect Eric vanishing to Ryan, nobody could connect it to his clothes. Second, he made sure that while his clothes still had no name, they would remember being Eric before. Therefore, if Eric was mentioned, it would know it was meant, but not see itself as him anymore.<br />
<br />
Back in the living room, the others looked up when Ryan returned. “Have you seen Eric?” Rob asked after Ryan sat down again. “Yeah, he went into the bathroom after I left. Why?” Ryan asked shyly in return.<br />
“He just left, which he normally didn´t. But maybe something was wrong.” Rob said, thinking. “We can ask when he comes back.”<br />
Ryan smiled and nodded, while mentally laughing, knowing Eric would never return.<br />
<br />
The former Eric, now remembering being called Eric before, screamed for his friends to help him. Partly, to become normal again. But as part of him also saw itself as normal, that part wished for help in another way. It wanted their help to make its owner even more happy than he was now. The former Eric was horrified, thinking what Ryan could do to the others. He didn´t understand his split feelings in any way.</p>
