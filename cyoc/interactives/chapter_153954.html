<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Trying to get back to some sense of normalcy at least for a while, Dan went back to his room to do something human-like and distract himself from the mixed feelings he was having over his fate. His pants and footwear had long since fallen off, since his lobster legs were much to small to sustain a fit. He intentionally ignored his nudity, though, and looked around. He saw his TV on the dresser and decided to watch that for a while. His collection of old socks scattered around the floor tasted awful; he kicked those out of the way in a hurry. He didn&#39;t bother to sit down anywhere; his eight walking legs held him up easily so his furniture looked awkward and unnecessary. It didn&#39;t take very long to find his remote control. Having already learned to use his forward feet as something like hands, he picked it up using those, knowing he that he wouldn&#39;t accidentally crush it with his big lobster claws that way. He noticed that the device tasted notably bland an uninteresting--just like the thick piece of plastic it was. That was okay, though. It&#39;s not like he had any expectation of eating a remote control anyway. He lifted up another foot so he could press the &quot;ON&quot; button with it.<br />
<br />
There was a comedian on the screen, and Dan let himself just zone out and laugh along, knowing that it was just a matter of time until his next change. He imaged that Kat really was at an 18th birthday party somewhere, and that his parents were there too, welcoming Kat into the inner circle of their secret witch friends, and bragging that their useless son was well on his way to becoming seafood. He mostly managed to put these thoughts out of his mind, though, and just enjoy the TV show during his wait.<br />
<br />
The show was almost over when Dan felt a sudden pressure building behind his rearmost set of legs. It was like something was straining to shove itself out of his rear. He planted his eight walking legs firmly on the ground and took deep breaths, heaving and moaning as if he was giving birth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on,&quot; he said to himself. &quot;Whatever it is, come on out!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was then that he felt his butt actually start to get pushed further away, out behind his back legs, out to the end of a new mass of flesh that was blossoming into existence back there. The new shape also started to fan out at the end, and new muscles allowed him to wave it up and down even as it grew. It was exhilarating... by the time it was longer than his torso, it started getting encased in armor-like shell plating of the sort that covered his many legs. It was finely segmented, allowing him full mobility to keep waving it up and down if he wanted to. That wasn&#39;t all, though, because the underside of his new mass immediately started tingling.<br />
<br />
Dan was ready and willing for new appendages. His mind was now quite accustomed to accepting them, and he was even starting to feel entitled to them after talking with his sister and seeing how many more of them his dinner had than he did. &quot;It&#39;s my birthright as a lobster,&quot; he thought slyly, knowing full well that he wasn&#39;t born a lobster and most people would be disgusted by turning into one.<br />
<br />
The little bumps sprouting from the bottom of his behind turned out to be little claw-like stubs that were even shorter than his walking legs. He had known since dinner to expect them, but he had no clue what their purpose was or what they were called. Actually, they were a set of swimmerets, and in his new aquatic habitat at the end of his change, they would serve to help him swim. The front pair would also have an additional purpose as his new sex organs; he didn&#39;t notice yet that he no longer had a penis in the traditional sense. All Dan knew was that there were eight of them, and he was in heaven feeling them wiggle under his big muscular growth.<br />
<br />
Panting for breath, exhausted from this most recent change, Dan gave himself a moment to relax and then finally looked back at the massive body section that had forced itself out behind him. This was a lobster abdomen. Of course, cooks and diners everywhere know it as a lobster tail. Seeing it caused another pang of fear in Dan, causing him to gasp, because the huge addition that was now half of his body looked just like half of the creature he had so shamelessly devoured in the kitchen. It looked just like what he had seen his parents pay big money to eat in fancy restaurants, and it drove home the point that he wasn&#39;t really even half human at this point.<br />
<br />
The TV comedian droned in the background, the tastes of the bedroom floor filtered up his legs, but Dan tuned it all out and stood silently in fresh emotional turmoil over what was happening to him.</p>
