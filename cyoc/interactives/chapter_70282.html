<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hadley was enjoying herself. She could clearly see her former brother was not adjusting easily to his new lifestyle and secretly wished that she could tell somebody, whether it be her best friend Ren or her and her neo-sister's mother. But at the same time she knew that secrecy was the best policy and so contented herself with simply watching.<br />
<br />
When the fifth day came to a close, Hadley started thinking about what she could do to Connor next and slowly, she began first formulating and than putting together the next lesson she would teach her brother. By the time the eighth-day came to a close, she was ready.<br />
<br />
Gathering the items she'd prepared, a pair of underwear that she'd sewn together out two different pairs so that the front part was proper for a two year old boy, but the section between the legs and the back was proper for a teenage girl, the amulet and a bra, size 36B, hoping that her new sister was just a heavy sleeper as she had been when she'd been male, Hadley crept down the hallway and paused a moment. Listening to the sounds of the house, she made sure nobody else was awake.<br />
<br />
After a moment, she set the items down, the amulet on her right, the clothes on her left and reaching into her pocket, she took out a pair of latex gloves, wanting to leave nothing to chance. Smiling, forgetting why and what it was she wanted to teach her brother, only knowing now that she wanted to do this, Hadley pulled on the gloves, reached down and picked up the garments first and than the amulet. Placing an ear against Caeleah's door, she listened.<br />
<br />
Certain now that everybody else was asleep Hadley gently pushed open the door and waited a couple seconds. When she was sure the noise hadn't awoken the occupant, she crept over the threshold and paused a moment, letting her eyes grow accustomed to the room as Caeleah, unlike Conner, kept a very dim nightlight plugged, but partially obscured by the dresser.<br />
<br />
When she finally had her bearings, Hadley began to move across the room and towards the bed, glad that the carpet muffled her footsteps. Reaching her sibling's bed, she peered down at the sleeping girl and smiled, thinking, &quot;You think you're miserable now. Just wait till morning comes,&quot; and gently, so not to wake her sister, Hadley reached down and arranged the bra and underwear on a portion of Caeleah's exposed skin, praying that it would cause the girl to wake up.<br />
<br />
A moan escaped Caeleah and for a brief moment, Hadley was sure that she'd woken her sister. Pausing, studying her sibling and the nightgown she was wearing, Hadley wondered what it was that was going through her former brother's head each day now that he'd been transformed. She pondered how it was that she would know if and when her brother had learned his lesson and if she'd be able to transform him back in the end.<br />
<br />
A movement distracted her from her thoughts and Hadley watched as Caeleah turned over in her sleep so that she was now facing away from the girl standing over her. Reaching out, Hadley readjusted the garments touching her sister's hand and holding up the amulet she grinned. After a couple more seconds, she touched the medallion to the clothes and the exposed bit of her former brother’s skin.<br />
<br />
Immediately Hadley could see the changes happening as her sibling began to grow in size. Another moan escaped the girl and as she rolled over onto her back, Hadley collected the underwear and bra. As she did this, she watched as Caeleah's chest pushed outward and the nightgown started to change from white to what appeared to be a very pale pink in the dim light. Taking a step back, hoping to see better, Hadley watched as the transformation continued, but before she could see it to the end the light in the room vanished.<br />
<br />
A thought that the room was also changing stole over Hadley's mind and deciding that she would just have to wait until morning to see the changes, she began to creep back across the room, nearly falling over a chair that hadn't been in the room when she'd come in moments ago.<br />
<br />
Out in the hall, Hadley listened one final time as Caeleah first gave another moan and than started to whisper in her sleep. Satisfied and feeling she was doing the right thing, Hadley pulled the door to her sister's room closed and crept back to her room. There, she hid the amulet again. After that, she threw the bra and underwear in her closet, confident that they'd be gone by morning and shucked off the latex gloves.<br />
<br />
Tossing them into the trash bin, she laid down on her bed. As she did so, she silently giggled and wondering what Connor would do in the morning when he found he'd not only transformed some more, but that he'd also aged over the space of one evening. After a moment, she reached for her top sheet and comforter and rolling over on her side, Hadley hugged the bedclothes to her chin and wondered what it was she should do to her brother next.<br />
<br />
After a moment, she giggled and whispered silently to herself, the next lesson already starting to form in her mind.</p>
