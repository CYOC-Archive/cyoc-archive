<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lia came to the conclusion that it would be a great idea to relax and freshen up a bit, so she accepted the invitation but said that she would have to go to the school lab first to finish a little experiment that she had already started and she couldn&#39;t stop, saying she only needed about 10 minutes to finish. She then proceeded to the lab where she analyzed a mouse into which she had injected an experimental drug she was developing. She had never told anyone, and was also ashamed of such a thing as one of her motivations was envy, that she was developing a cell development treatment that would increase the size of anyone&#39;s breasts. which would primarily work for women who want a bigger bust, but with development she realized that it could also be used to treat men who want to undergo a sex change.<br />
<br />
While Lia was analyzing whether it had any effect, the laboratory door opened and Clarissa entered.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you come here for Clarissa?&quot; Lia asked the girl in the bikini who entered the laboratory alone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I came here just to make sure you don&#39;t run away today. You spend a lot of time alone and need to socialize more with your schoolmates, I want to make sure you join us.&quot; Clarissa said<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, but you&#39;ll have to wait for me to finish here.&quot; Lia said<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t mind waiting a bit.&quot; Clarissa said<br />
<br />
Lia resumed examining her experiment. She was so focused that she didn&#39;t even realize what happened after that, because Clarissa was one of those people who has a hard time just sitting still and waiting, so she kept looking at things in the lab curiously.<br />
<br />
As Clarissa snooped around she took a vial off the top of a shelf and looked carefully at the contents, the name of which was too complicated for her to understand, and when she returned it to its place she didn&#39;t put it right and the vial tipped over to fall. Realizing this, she grabbed it in a quick movement, but at the same time she got in the way, as she ended up bumping into other lower vials, which also lost their balance and started to turn. Despairing and trying to avoid the damage, Clarissa tried to avoid the fall of the vials, but it only made the situation worse because she bumped into the shelf and so all the vials turned over, some vials just rolled a little while others broke when bumping into each other, thus causing its content to react and fall on Clarissa. Other vials fell and broke as they hit the floor, covering the floor with shards of glass and chemicals. <br />
<br />
Lia looked at the shelf when she heard the vials breaking and was shocked by the damage, several broken vials, including the one that held the sample of the drug she was developing. She then saw Clarissa, who had dropped to her knees on the shards on the floor. She ran to her colleague worried, as she had been hit not only by her prototype, but by various chemicals she had never mixed before, including some acids that were dangerous if they came in contact with human skin. She could also have suffered several cuts from the shards and that would make it easier for the substances to enter her body, making the situation even worse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no. Clarissa, what happened?&quot; Lia asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry.... I messed up... I.... aahhhhh...&quot; Clarissa tried to say it, but she squirmed and screamed, clearly in great pain. Her bikini fell apart as it was corroded by the acids and blisters formed on her skin as blood dripped from her legs onto the floor.<br />
<br />
Lia despaired, put on a protective suit and went to help the girl. She hauled Clarissa up with difficulty and sat her naked on a bench, as her swimwear fell out completely destroyed by the acid. At that moment she realized that something unexpected was happening, the blisters that had formed on the girl&#39;s skin were decreasing and the cuts on her legs were healing quickly.<br />
<br />
Clarissa had never imagined so much suffering or anyone feeling as much pain as she was feeling, she couldn&#39;t reason anymore and had lost track of what was going on around her. The situation was so bad that when she felt the pains start to subside she thought it was the end and that she was dying, but she then heard Lia calling her name and looked at the geeky girl and then back at herself, only then realizing she was naked and seeing her body finish healing completely.<br />
<br />
&quot;How are you feeling Clarissa?&quot; Lia asked very worried, removing her protective clothing<br />
<br />
Clarissa stood up and moved a little before saying &quot;I feel great, much better than I&#39;ve ever felt. It doesn&#39;t even feel like I was suffering so much a short time ago and all the pain disappeared completely.&quot; and looked at the scene of the accident, where if it hadn&#39;t happened to her, she herself wouldn&#39;t have believed that all that blood was hers given the condition she was in at the time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now I&#39;m in trouble. If it was just the lost material it wouldn&#39;t be so much of a problem, but how am I going to explain all this blood?&quot; Lia said<br />
<br />
&quot;You won&#39;t need to explain this to anyone. As it was my fault for being careless so I&#39;ll take responsibility so let me clean up. <br />
In the meantime I want you to do me a favor and go to the locker room and get my clothes there, with my swimsuit in this state it&#39;s just junk now.&quot; Clarissa said<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t, we have to get help for you, I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re safe yet.&quot; Lia said<br />
<br />
&quot;I already told you I&#39;m great. Now I don&#39;t have any problems so I&#39;ll do my part, if I feel anything strange I&#39;ll let you know.&quot; Clarissa said</p>
