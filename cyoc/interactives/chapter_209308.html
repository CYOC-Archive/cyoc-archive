<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was some unease among the Chapmans as they looked across the living room to Simon and Melody. The two had given them some help and information that let them know more on what Slug People could do against Cupple’s powers and where the real limitations that they would have against the wizard that was the cause of all the family’s present problems and battles. For Zoe and Grace, it had also provided some means of possibly forgiving Megan and Jenny once Cupple was defeated, as it seemed that the two of them were also victims of Cupple’s schemes. Even Lucy, as she looked to Melody, had some reason to accept the two Slug Women that had showed up at their door the previous day. <br />
<br />
Some of it came down to some interest in Melody, though Lucy couldn’t fully place why. Melody had been honest and helpful, but Lucy saw that as a basic curtesy and wasn’t necessarily something that would be all that definitive, or at least it normally wouldn’t. But a part of Lucy felt strangely attracted to Melody, and she inwardly tried to keep that quiet or hidden, particularly as while Simon and Melody had been able to help, they still faced some limitations and difficulties that came primarily from the legal position that Cupple was able to use to his defense for the moment to reinforce the raw powers he had. Lucy occasionally turned one eye to note that Jeff and Simon did occasionally look to each other, and both looked nervous as they did so, indicating possible rivalries between Male Slug People, even if the only Slug Woman that wasn’t related to Jeff was Melody.<br />
<br />
“I’m not sure there are many places you could go, for the moment,” Simon said slowly as they began to think over what to do regarding where the Chapmans would stay the night, “I could make some calls and see if some colony members might wish to take in a guest… I could offer you to stay here with me… but given that you’re all still adjusting to new instincts and bodies, I’m not sure that is something that you want. And particularly when it would seem that your son, Mrs. Chapman, is battling with some of the natural rivalry instincts male Slug People can have toward each other.”<br />
<br />
“Rivalry?” Whitney spoke up and turned to face Jeff, who backed away with a frown.<br />
<br />
“It’s nothing to worry over,” Simon spoke in a more assuring tone, “because female Slug People are hermaphrodites and male Slug People are rare, it is often that males will have some rivalry with each other because they may also be competing against female Slug People for mates, particularly if they’re looking for only ONE mate. And that’s often just with male Slug People that hatched from a female’s egg. Many human men who’ve fallen in love with a Slug Woman and became a Slug Man to be with her, have often shown a rather protective nature regarding female family members and so on. Not in the sense of mating with them but protecting them from abuse or too forward advances from other Slug People. They recognize their new libido and how high it can be and they don’t want someone taking advantage of their family. And because Cupple has seen to all of you becoming Slug People, I would be guessing that your son doesn’t want me to put unwanted moves on you or your daughters. And it can be a reasonable expectation. I would never act without permission or consent… but I won’t sit here and say I’m not attracted.”<br />
<br />
“I see,” Whitney said slowly, barely holding back a smile as a part of her was also attracted to Simon, as he was a well-built Slug Man. But with Cupple still out there and that being the main focus for the moment, she conceded that for the moment that might not be a good idea.<br />
<br />
“Though, that still leaves us with a question on where to go,” Jeff sighed as he felt some of the tension levels go down a bit and noted a hopeful look from Melody to Lucy and one that he thought his twin returned, “I mean… Cupple remains dangerous and our house would only leave us having to lock ourselves in rooms away from Megan and Jenny… until they can be freed of Cupple. The help we might get in town will take time for answers to come, and even you’ve said that there isn’t too much that you can do right now.”<br />
<br />
“You could stay with me,” Melody offered, “I may not have many rooms… BUT I’m a bit more familiar with how humans behave and look at Slug People than most others in the colony. And… well… a part of me would want to work to make it up to you, given everything.”<br />
<br />
“You’d do that?” Zoe asked as she blinked, “but you barely know us.”<br />
<br />
“The rest of the colony would know you even less,” Melody answered, “and I could give you a better introduction to the colony while waiting for my father to get things arranged so that the help we’d have to wait for can arrive.”<br />
<br />
“And you wouldn’t take advantage of us? Or of Lucy?” Jeff asked pointedly.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s line made Lucy turn to glare at him with both eyes, in a way that Lucy couldn’t fully expect or understand why. The rational part of her mind understood that Jeff was just trying to protect her and that fit in line with how Simon had described how Slug Men, and particularly Slug Men that had once been human might protect their family and siblings. But another part of her mind just seemed attracted to Melody for reasons she couldn’t fully fathom. Melody had been polite and kind, she hadn’t been forceful, and she had offered help, all things that Lucy was thankful for, but the rational part of her mind could argue that was to be expected from a good and honest person. It wasn’t something that would automatically go beyond that.<br />
<br />
“I would never seek to take advantage of anyone,” Melody answered quickly, trying to calm some of the shock that she sensed as Grace and Zoe picked up on Lucy’s reaction to Jeff’s question, “none of that would be right and would take away your choices. Like any Slug Person… I can’t say I’m not interested… but I would NEVER try to take away someone’s choices. And given that a friend of mine was one of Cupple’s victims as well and then took advantage of you… a part of me feels responsible.”<br />
<br />
“And we can thank you for that,” Whitney tried to keep herself between the main factions in the developing and easing tension, “as I think Lucy would like that you would give her a choice and wouldn’t deny her that. And Jeff, should understand and recognize that.”<br />
<br />
Jeff noted that the way his mother had finished the sentence that what had been said was more a point made against him and he was forced to back down on his tail. He’d picked up a bit on Lucy showing some interest in Melody, and a part of him wondered if this was all just Slug Person instincts manifesting, but if it wasn’t, or if Lucy was willing to let those instincts manifest, it really wouldn’t be his place to interfere. The only thing he could at least ask for was waiting to deal with Cupple first.<br />
<br />
“Wouldn’t everyone in the colony support that base position, though?” Grace wondered.<br />
<br />
“They would and should,” Simon nodded, “we’re all connected… but forcing ourselves on others is never part of what we believe in. Particularly with those that have fallen victim to a wicked wizard’s schemes.”<br />
<br />
“Then maybe we should split up,” Whitney commented, “If you would host us… Grace, Zoe, and I could stay with you and you could maybe provide some tips on what to do after Cupple is defeated regarding our home as a “new” colony and that we aren’t taxing you later.”<br />
<br />
Simon blinked as he looked over to Chapman mother.<br />
<br />
“Melody could then host Jeff and Lucy,” Whitney then continued, “that way, you and Jeff won’t be at odds and your daughter could honor her personal thoughts and debts. We can all meet up again tomorrow before either learning more about the colony and then meeting with whoever you have to help us.”<br />
<br />
“Splitting us up?” Grace asked to Whitney.<br />
<br />
“Only for a short time,” Whitney said slowly, “and trying to avoid things that will be unnecessary while waiting for help. Particularly while we’ll have to wait regardless of whether or not we’re together.”<br />
<br />
“You would all be safe here at the colony from Cupple’s powers, regardless of whether or not you split up,” Melody spoke.<br />
<br />
“And we wouldn’t harm you,” Simon added, “I promise that you are not under any threat with us.”<br />
<br />
“That’ll be good,” Zoe spoke up, “and… I’d hope we do trust you when you say you want to help us.”<br />
<br />
There were a few nods from the other Chapmans as they agreed with it and seemed to sense that base agreement and trust through the hive mind. It then let Zoe pat Lucy’s tail with some trust while Grace looked back to Melody and Simon with some relief. Whitney nodded and then looked back to Jeff with one eye while the other looked to Simon.<br />
<br />
“And I trust, son, that you will not cause any trouble for your host or your sister?” Whitney asked to Jeff.<br />
<br />
“Of course,” Jeff answered quickly, “I mean… I just want to make sure that she’s not taken advantage of… or messed with. I mean, everything that we went through with our transformations was rather nerve-wracking… starting when you transformed, and overwhelmed with lust wanted ME to…”<br />
<br />
Whitney shrank back a bit, noting that Simon didn’t really respond to that, “I know. You and Lucy have always been close friends, despite your differences and some of the pranks you pulled when you were younger. But there is a difference between protection and domination.”<br />
<br />
“Right, mom,” Jeff agreed and looked over to Melody, “I’m sorry if I said anything too harsh to you. Things have been rough, and I promise I won’t give you any trouble.”<br />
<br />
Lucy found herself smiling at her brother’s apology and that Melody seemed to smile at it as well.<br />
<br />
“It’s okay,” Melody spoke as she slid up behind the couch that Lucy was on, “If I were in your place… I’d probably be doing the same thing. Family can be important, and after a wizard takes choices away from you, you’re going to be bound to be defensive in a new place.”<br />
<br />
Lucy also agreed with that as she got up off the couch, patting Zoe’s shoulder and then sliding on her tail to pat Grace and Whitney’s shoulder as well. The last person she approached was Jeff, who had moved from his spot from behind the couch that Grace and Zoe were on.<br />
<br />
“And all of that is a good thing,” Lucy spoke, “we all accept that.”<br />
<br />
Melody smiled, “well… I guess we should be off then for the evening. Get dinner started cooked. Show you where you can sleep for the night… and maybe, talk for a bit”<br />
<br />
“That’d be nice,” Lucy found herself saying before Jeff could even answer. She then blinked at the almost pained smile that Melody returned her and that only raised some other puzzled questions in the back of Lucy’s mind, but as she and Jeff moved to follow Melody out she didn’t say anything.</p>
