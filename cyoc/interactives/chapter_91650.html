<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer gazes around her room, looking for something, okay, i think i got something for you kyle, i want you to transform into a Goddess kyle! <br />
Kyle&#39;s face turns pale and he orders his friends out of the room, what ? a goddess ? you cant do that, to late, i just did kyle also it will be permanent and you can never change back to be a guy ever again so have fun kyle.<br />
kyle looks down at his cell and tries to desperately call up jennifer again but no one picks up, he starts panting heavily and he starts to feel dizzy, the room is spinning and his vision blurries but he manages to stay up, he leans his body against the wall and looks down at his hands. a small white glow was enveloping his hands as he looked down, trough the light he could see his nails getting longer and turning pure white, his fingers turning longer and slender, he looked up and looked out the window, the sun was shining and there wasnt a single cloud in the sky, it was the perfect summer day yet he couldnt look out, he forced his gaze back on his hands, the light was gone but his hands was definately more femenine, he clenched them into a fist, his nail pushed into his skin. he could hear footsteps and a door opening and closing, he looked out the window to see his friends leaving the home, he let out a sigh of relief atleast he didnt have to deal with them...he looked at them as they passed the corner and sat down on the bed and picked up his cell just as he picked it up kyle heard a sort of crack, he shot up from the bed and almost fell right back down, his legs were cracking and twisting, the hair was dropping down from the legs and piled down on the floor, then the feeling stopped, he looked down, his legs were long and slender, almost glowing even yet kyle knew what was to come out of a morbid sense of curiosity kyle walked to his mother&#39;s bedroom and opened her wardrobe to look at the mirror inside it, Kyle closed his eyes and slowly opened them as he looked in the mirror, it was big enough to show his whole body, It was just as he had assumed, his legs and arms were definately femenine, very femenine in fact, his hips were wide and he turned around to see his butt had changed aswell, it was alot more round, he kicked of his pants that was already around his ankles and slowly let his hands glide over it.<br />
Kyle almost lost in thought just staring back at his reflection was quickly forced back to reality as his head started to crack, kyle covered his mouth to avoid screaming yet...there was no pain whatsoever, just a small crack, he could feel it changing and sliding around but he felt no pain from it, he could feel his hair growing longer aswell as it started to tickle the back of his neck, He slowly removed his hands from his mouth and looked at the mirror again and gasped, it was both in shock, amazement and curiosity, his face was totally femenine, his lips was full and look like they were already painted since they were gently red-ish colored his eyes were pure blue and his hair was long and blonde reaching almost down to his butt. <br />
Kyle opened his mouth and whispered the words &#39;&#39;Oh my god&#39;&#39; and was just as suprised to hear the soft voice, almost like a young mother talking with her child, Kyle&#39;s perspective had changed all of a sudden, instead of fearing the inevitable he stod confident and looked in the mirror and gently stroked his hair, it was thick and silky smooth, He removed his shirt leaving him only in his now to big boxer shorts and looked at the mirror again, kyle could feel it coming now as he looked at the mirror and saw his chest starting to grow aswell as slimming down in the waist area, it was pure bliss, he looked amazedly at the transformation happening right infront of him. it was a minute or two at most before they stopped growing at a gentle C-cup, kyle blushed and almost dove in the wardrobe looking for something to cover up it with, he found a black bra that fit perfectly, he instincly knew how to put it on aswell, Yet what kyle didnt know is what was happening inside him, his organs started to change to acompany his gender, all he felt was a small rumble in his stomach and it was over his boxers fell down from his legs and surely enough there was nothing there except what mattered, Kyle....Kylie looked at the mirror and...nothing, she stod there looking for what seemed like forever before something snapped her back to reality, the white glow from before was slowly floating infront of kylie, it was just floating there as it went right inside kylie with a sudden force almost knocking her down.<br />
so it happened, her eyes lit up for a split second, a stream of air went trough the room blowing up her hair, the mirror started to shine brightly as kylie looked at the reflection, it shone brighter and a warm, comforting feeling surrounded her it was she had just walked outside in the fresh warm air, she could feel something awakening inside her, her hands glew gently white, it was her gift and power, she knew it, she was a Goddess, she smiled to herself and picked out some clothes for herself, she looked over her mothers clothing but nothing fit except for the bra and a pair of panties, disapointed but not quite sure what to do she started to think, she still remembered all her memories of before, she would never lose them, she would always treasure the memories of her past life but now she had a new life and a new purpose aswell, she snapped her fingers just out of the blue as a silky white dress slowly starting to form around her body, sewing itself to make sure it fit perfectly, it was beautiful, it showed of her assets and seemed to embody goddesshood, she smiled to herself and put on a pair of white heels and walked back to her room and looked outside, it was such a beautiful day, she was free to do what she pleased, Kylie looked up at at the sky and smiled, a word echoed in her mind, it was weak but it sounded like a name...her new name ? kylie focused, she never thought about it but she would need a new name since jennifer did this to her she thought maybe something with a J ? Jessica ? maybe ? or maybe Alexandra...something femenine and god-like she eventually decided on three names, Diana, Freya or Venus she would decide one but before that she would like to call up a certain someone to talk to, woman to Goddess, she found her old phone and called up jennifer.</p>
