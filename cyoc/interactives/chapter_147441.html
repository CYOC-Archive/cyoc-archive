<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the cute waitress started walking away from your table, you saw how she raised her tail up and spread her feathers behind her. Her ass was swaying suggestively and she turned her head to look back at you with a smile. Upon arriving at another table, she lowered her tail slightly and went on with her job.<br />
<br />
For somebody as special as her, you needed to make sure you were prepared to give her the evening of a lifetime.<br />
<br />
You patted your pants pocket, making sure you had the remote with you. Looking at your watch, you saw that you still had about half an hour left before your date got off her shift, so you decided to take a walk to see if you could entertain yourself some more while waiting. It was already reasonably late, so most people had left the mall by now. The few people that were still left were party-goers, ready for a fun night in some of the local music tents, other places filled to the brim with people were the pubs.<br />
<br />
Just for the heck of it, you decided to enter one of those pubs, to see if you could swap with some more people. Maybe you could invite the waitress out here later, you had her number after all.<br />
<br />
The pub had a nice, giddy atmosphere. There were all kinds of people. You took the remote out of your pocket, and decided to test some swaps.<br />
<br />
You saw a group of jocks your age hungrily checking out a gaggle of girls in the far corner, furthest away from the stage. The latter were conversing loudly, and most attention of the men in the pub was drawn to them.<br />
<br />
These guys had a predatory look on them, and you could almost imagine the tents in their pants right now. You decided, for each of the four jocks, to swap their mouths and cocks with each other. There was an audible zap, you&#39;d gotten used to it by now, and moments later you saw how their mouths began to change in their appearance. At first it looked as if the guys were just pouting, but the skin of their lips stretched out further before them, changing from the color red to their skin color as the lips began to shrivel slightly, morphing into foreskin. They stuck their tongues out, and you saw them grow slightly thicker, shifting in shape, taking on the form of the head of a penis. Not long after, the jocks&#39; cocks stood largely erect in front of their faces, pointed at the direction of the girls they were looking at. <br />
<br />
You decided to do something similar for the loud gaggle of girls in the corner of the pub. Pointing the remote at them, and pressing the button for their changes, they suddenly looked to have difficulty talking, their lips becoming stiffer and slowly turning ninety degrees on their faces. One of the girls brought a napkin to her face and wiped off some juice that slowly leaked out of the corners of her lips, shivering slightly in pleasure, but still doing a decent job cleaning her wet, now uncovered private parts. The sounds had died down, and their talking had become much more muffled, as their mouths had morphed into their respective pussies, while the process had gone vice-versa down below.<br />
<br />
You saw how a couple of them had the tendency to cover the mouth, blushing slightly at the looks they got. Another stood up, and bent down, reaching underneath the hem of her dress, slipping of her panties. She then brought them over her head, and voila, it was covered once more. You saw their way of sitting had shifted as well. Where their legs used to be kept together, they were now spread wide apart, so they could talk more audibly. It looked really strange as to how reality tried to adapt to the changes of these people. You noticed one of the men standing up and approaching the ladies, trying to make a move.<br />
<br />
Another one, you noted, had a cock in front of their face that stretched out way further than the average man&#39;s. It must&#39;ve been at least six and a half inches in length, maybe even more. In comparison to the amount of inches you and Mike packed, it was a monster.<br />
<br />
You remembered your date in half an hour, and how you wanted to prepare for the occasion. Aiming the remote directly at the man&#39;s face, you swapped his dick with yours, and saw how it visibly shrunk before your, as well as his eyes. The bulge inside your own pants had grown substantially, and you felt the strain of his large erection against your briefs. You decided to head over to the bathroom for a moment to readjust.<br />
<br />
This meant the men&#39;s bathroom of course, despite the alterations in your appearance. No longer did you have that cow&#39;s udders, but you had switched it with the softly toned belly of that of a slightly tipsy woman from the restaurant you had left fifteen minutes ago. Her skin tone was slightly darker than Mike&#39;s, and her belly button was pointed inwards. Turning around, you noted that the changes had also affected your lower back, but neither reached further down than just a quarter of an inch below your belly button. From there, the skin tone shifted, parted by a visible horizontal line, and small pubic hairs formed to down your crotch.<br />
<br />
Unbuckling your belt, you saw the larger cock you now sported. Before, it had been worn by the jock who appeared to be the least muscular of the bunch. People are always in for surprises, you noted. It had a long shaft, with a nice girth, probably a treat for the cute waitress you were intending to nail.<br />
<br />
But enough of that. Putting your pants back on properly again, you took a last look at the mirror, feeling your neck. You had changed it with that other girl. You had a giraffe&#39;s neck before this, it had been fun looking over the busy crowd of this afternoon&#39;s zoo visitors. You found that the Adam&#39;s apple was no longer visible. Testing your voice once more with a hum, it made for a nice soprano.<br />
<br />
Ten o&#39;clock. Time for the leap of faith then. Looking at the old receipt the waitress had given you, you dial her number.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; Asked a seductive voice from the other side of the line.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello there nightingale. This is Pete, the guy you gave your number to, if you didn&#39;t recognize my voice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I recognize it alright? My name is Jessie, where can I find you, cutie?&quot;<br />
<br />
You flushed slightly, feeling the same fluttering warmth in your stomach as when you swapped your belly with that of that drunk girl&#39;s. &quot;At Somer&#39;s. It&#39;s about a block away from the restaurant you work at. I wanna get to know you and have a couple of nice drinks with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice place. I&#39;ll know how to get there. See you in five minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
She hung up, and you were left marveling.<br />
<br />
_____<br />
<br />
Sooner than the time she promised Jessie arrives at the bar you had decided on. You share two kisses on the cheek and start talking, each holding a cocktail in one hand while leaning with your free arms. It isn&#39;t long until the two of you come to the topic of the remote you were toying with.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what&#39;s that for?&quot; She asks, pointing at the remote. &quot;You forgot to bring your TV with or somethin&#39;?&quot;<br />
<br />
You shake your head. &quot;It&#39;s a special remote.&quot;<br />
<br />
A voice within you, still sober, tells you it&#39;s information you shouldn&#39;t share, but it had been a while since you last thought clearly. After two more alcoholic drinks, still not knowing how much the woman you borrowed the stomach from had drunk before this, you are starting to enter a state of drunkenness.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s it do, that makes it so special?&quot; She asks with a curious smile. Her eyes are still bright, despite also being slightly tipsy already. You know she studies something in the field of Biology, but can&#39;t remember what exactly anymore. She had gotten interested in that field of study because she was born with a tail when no one else had been. You know that story isn&#39;t true of course, and she probably had another reason before all this, but it is still funny how reality adapts.<br />
<br />
She timed her question pretty well. Right at that moment, the cock-faced jocks and the pussy-faced ladies pass by your seats. They are being all flirty with each other, probably in for a night as fun as you hope yours to become.<br />
<br />
You point at them and simply say, &quot;That.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessie turns around to look at them, then raises her eyebrows questioningly at you. &quot;What about them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This remote swaps the body parts on people. Tell me nightingale,&quot; you&#39;ve come to call her by that nickname, because of her attractive, melodic voice, and more so because of the feathery tale behind her. A peacock and a nightingale aren&#39;t exactly the same, but they share similar traits despite it. And calling a girl a peacock doesn&#39;t sound all that gentleman-like. <br />
<br />
&quot;Have you ever seen a bunch of men and women with genitals attached to their faces?&quot; You ask.<br />
<br />
She shakes her head. Obviously not. &quot;I may have passed by them, but I never noticed them.&quot; She tells you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not what I meant. Have you ever met <i>anyone</i>, other than them, with genitals on their faces?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I have not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s because the remote changed them.&quot; You say, holding the device up in your hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;They look pretty normal to me honestly, Pete. You&#39;re not just being discriminate towards them, are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
You shake your head. &quot;Whenever the remote changes somebody, reality changes with it. Only the user of the remote will remember the changes they&#39;ve made, not even the people they&#39;ve changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I highly doubt that to be true,&quot; Jessie says, crossing her arms.<br />
<br />
You sigh exasperatedly, then take a large sip from your cocktail. Frustrated that you can&#39;t prove your point, your drunk mind offers her the remote.<br />
<br />
&quot;Try it yourself then, if you don&#39;t believe me?&quot; You say.<br />
<br />
You see her tail twitch behind her slightly, as if she were surprised. She takes the remote from you, and starts fiddling around with it. When you take a sip from your drink once more, you hear a loud zap, recognizing it as the sound coming from the remote. Looking back at her, you see an expression of shock and awe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool eh?&quot; You look around the room, trying to look if you can spot the changes, despite not knowing which. Giving up, knowing the remote&#39;s effects, you look back at Jessie. &quot;What things did you swap? Any people? I can&#39;t spot them,&quot; you say with a curious grin.<br />
<br />
Her eyes are still widened in shock, ogling at your chest. You laugh. &quot;Eyes up here, nightingale,&quot; you say, pointing at your face.<br />
<br />
She looks back up at you and flushes a bright red, making your grin spread even wider. Then, while choking over her own words she points back at your chest, urging you to look down.<br />
<br />
With a gasp of surprise, you cover your breasts.<br />
<br />
It was so stupid of you not to realize it sooner. How drunk are you anyway? You look around the place, seeing if others had noticed. To your relief, yet still feeling a pang of disappointment, nobody had been looking at you, apart from Jessie.<br />
<br />
<i>&#39;Why didn&#39;t I come here wearing a bra?&#39;</i> You think to yourself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck me sideways!&quot; You exclaim.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-your breasts.&quot; Jessie gasps.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t rub it in, dang it!&quot; You say in a muted tone. Despite the shame, there&#39;s still the feeling of mischief coming from this situation. It was pretty exciting anyhow.<br />
<br />
You look at Jessie and the clothes she is wearing. You date&#39;s attention is now turned towards herself, as she is looking at her own masculine chest. It was quite the sight to behold in between those feminine clothes of hers.<br />
<br />
Your hand reaches out towards her. &quot;Hand me that bra of yours,&quot; you say, &quot;you don&#39;t need it.&quot;<br />
<br />
She&#39;s probably still flabbergasted from the revelation, as she stares at your chest once more, and, as if on instinct, removes her bra from her chest and hands it over to you.<br />
<br />
You stand up, bra in hand, lower arm covering the stiff nipples poking through the fabric of your favorite t-shirt. You decide that wearing only one layer of clothes is not a good idea when going out to public. Jessie is folding with the remote again, her grin almost manic. <i>Start using it, then!</i> You tap her on the shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going into the bathroom for a bit. It appears your bra fits my size on point. Thanks, by the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your w-welcome.&quot; She manages to sputter, as you slowly walk away from your seats at the bar.<br />
<br />
Walking over to the bathroom, you begin swaying your hips, and look back over towards Jessie, in a similar fashion as to when she did it back at the restaurant. Back when she did it, it simply looked comedic. But given your sexy figures, you imagined this was a pretty arousing sight for your date.<br />
<br />
You enter a stall, and lower the lid of the toilet, so that, when removing your shirt, you could lay it on top, without needing to hold on to it or drop it to the ground when putting on the bra.<br />
<br />
You start blushing once more, at the reminder that you have basically flashed everybody who has seen you today. In all honesty, it had never even occurred to you that you weren&#39;t wearing a bra. You rub your thighs together at the thought, feeling excited. But not yet. Your bra is set, and you put your shirt back on. Putting up the toilet lid again, you slide down your pants once more and take a seat on its surface. You make sure that Mike&#39;s peacock tail isn&#39;t in the way, doing so by lifting it up as high as you can, which automatically causes the effect of them spreading out behind you.<br />
<br />
The feathers look healthy and unharmed. All of them the same beautiful and shiny, with mostly blue and green colors all over them. The base of your tail twitches in excitement. You&#39;ve been anticipating this night for quite some time now. You aren&#39;t going to back down now. Making sure to wipe after you are done with business, you lift up your shorts and trousers again and head back over to where Jessie is seated.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; you start, approaching her from behind, using your chest as leverage by pressing against her back. &quot;Have you used that remote  yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
She smiles at you as you sit back down. You raise your hand at one of the bartender, gesturing that you would like the receipt. He mouths for you to wait a second, which is understandable because he&#39;s still busy pissing beer out into a glass, aiming at it with his penis. A nice head of foam forms on top of it. Props to the man&#39;s handling.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wouldn&#39;t notice anyway,&quot; she says, giving you back the remote.<br />
<br />
&quot;Try me.&quot; You say with a grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the bartender was a subject, for one. Nobody I know has a beer tap in their bladder. Unless they&#39;re really fucking drunk on Budweiser.&quot;<br />
<br />
You pause for a second. &quot;Now that you mention it, that <i>is</i> a bit odd.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I also made that predator guy behind you really drunk from the alcohol he had constantly been offering to the girl he was hitting on. Any more and she wouldn&#39;t remember what she&#39;s done tonight anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Clever choice. I guess that&#39;s also a way of using the device.&quot; You try putting aside the memories of that guy having been drunk the whole time already. It is really weird how the remote plays reality. But it&#39;s also a nice fail-safe, since nobody but the user themselves finds the results unnerving.<br />
<br />
&quot;I made myself a bit tipsy by swapping my belly with that of a girl who had already drunk some alcoholic stuff. I&#39;m really having a blast right now.&quot; You say. Jessie laughs at your comment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tonight&#39;s been an... amazing experience so far, Pete.&quot; She says. She is twirling a lock of hair between her fingers, giving off a flirtatious vibe. You re-position yourself on top of your stool, feeling excited again. Some of your wetness is dribbling down against the fabric of your shorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;So...&quot; She continues. She leans in towards you, and brings a hand towards your thigh, slowly brushing over it. &quot;Your place or mine?&quot;<br />
<br />
Your heart makes a leap again, and you feel your pussy quivering. You smile a mischievous smile, eyes widening with lust when you look at her. &quot;Becoming a bit pushy during a first date, are we?&quot; You say, already knowing you would&#39;ve done exactly the same if you were in her shoes.<br />
<br />
Jessie laughs. &quot;Make no mistake, <i>nightingale</i>. You were the one inviting me out in the first place.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your heartbeat picks up at her pushiness, and you feel like you&#39;re about to lose your calm composure. God! You wanted to jump her then and there. Jump on his cock, slide it down your soaked sex, pumping and pumping and pumping...!<br />
<br />
The bartender puts a receipt down on your end.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, your place. Let&#39;s go.&quot;</p>
