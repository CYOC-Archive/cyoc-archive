<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Devon heard his alarm clock buzzing as he closed his eyes tighter, groggily.  He reached out a hand and pressed the button, his arm feeling heavy and forefinger fatter than normal as he felt for the button, his whole big hand hitting the clock and feeling clumsy to him.<br />
<br />
He opened his eyes and looked as his arm, thick and muscular and the bigger hand attached to it.  Holy shit!  This can&#39;t be happening, he thought as he sat up in his pajamas.  He had gone to bed in his pajamas but things weren&#39;t the same.  His top rode halfway up his chest, showing his whole midriff, which was lightly fuzzy and had a man&#39;s abs and even a trail of hair sprouting out of his belly button like he had turned into some sort of teenage beast.  It was like his whole body had grown right out of his pajamas.<br />
<br />
He pulled back the covers and there was a big wet spot on the crotch of his pajamas, which felt tight on his thighs and ass, and as he pulled back the covers further he saw they rode way up his thighs practically to his knees, muscular legs that were rather hairy sicking out and big ass feet that were sticking out over the edge of the bed.  He looked at the manly toes sicking up, the blood rushing to his head as he felt panic at the surreal sight.  It just wasn&#39;t quite kicking in that this was real.  He moved a foot and watched the toes curl as his leg stretched.  He gawked at it for a bit, realizing after a bit he was actually slack-jawed with his mouth open.  No wonder, talk about a shock.<br />
<br />
Devon pulled the cover back up and buried his face in his pillow, pulling the cover over his head.<br />
<br />
What was he going to do?  For now he had to make sure his parents didn&#39;t find out.  He curled his legs up under the covers, making sure his feet didn&#39;t stick out at all.  All they&#39;d see like this was his hair, he thought, if even that, as he pulled the covers tight and wrapped himself up in them.<br />
<br />
He held still as his head raced, trying to lay out a plan.  When they&#39;ve gone to work he could maybe think of something, or a way to hide this or explain.  How could he hide it?<br />
<br />
&quot;Devon, good morning&quot; he heard his as his mother&#39;s feet thumped up the stairs.  &quot;I&#39;m sicckk&quot; he groaned before she even got too close to his door.  His voice!  What came out sounded so deep that it did sound like he was sick, though he didn&#39;t have a sore throat anymore.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sick mom&quot; he groaned, trying to take his voice up back to his usual octave but only getting part of the way there.  It wasn&#39;t working like it used to, he&#39;d have to learn how to adjust it so it sounds the same as it did before, he thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t come in&quot; he said, &quot;I&#39;m not dressed&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Devon, but you don&#39;t want to miss practice tomorrow.  Do you want me to drive you to the doctor?  You don&#39;t want risk being sick putting you out for a week.&quot;<br />
<br />
Practice?  Putting you out?  What was she talking about, Devon wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s ok mom&quot; he said, this time managing to actually almost approximate his old self by trying to change his tone.  Maybe there was a way out of this still.  &quot;I just want to sleep.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll call in but you let me know if it gets worse, mister.  I&#39;ve gotta get to work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok mom.&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
When Devon heard the garage door open and close he knew he was in the clear.  He&#39;d have the whole day to figure this out at least.  Hopefully it&#39;d be reversible in the end.<br />
<br />
He pulled the covers back very slowly, shocked all over again as he took in his broad chest stretching his pjs tight, that hair coming out of his belly button, the wet spot like he&#39;d pissed his pants although he was starting to fear it might be something else, and again probably most shocking, how hairy his lower legs were now and the big manly feet that were embarrassingly his.<br />
<br />
As a nerd, Devon had always been weird about bare feet.  It had taken him years to stop wearing his socks to bed, his mom had said he shouldn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
Devon got up and went to the bathroom so he could see what had happened, his whole body feeling gangly and oversized to him, though he knew he was not gangly-- he was taller for sure.  It looked ridiculous that he was wearing these pajamas that rode up on him, and also his whole face looked like a teenage dude coming into whiskers now.  He could see it on his upper lip and chin, embarrassing him as he suppressed his fear and panic.  This couldn&#39;t be him, he wasn&#39;t like this.<br />
<br />
If only he could take it back and had never been stupid enough to worry about helping Joe.  He could kick himself.<br />
<br />
He took off his clothes, peeling his tight top over his head and catching the shocking flash of dark hair busting out from his pits now.  No way, he wasn&#39;t having this!  He had bushes of hair under his arms now, this wasn&#39;t what he was about.  He dropped the shirt and held up an arm; that was definitely a bush.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a dude now&quot; he said to his reflection for no reason, if only to hear his voice.  He hoped his pits wouldn&#39;t stink at least.  He tried to smell himself and maybe there was a faint something there but not bad.<br />
<br />
He slid his bottom down, and out fell a fat adult-looking dong that was surrounded by dark hair and his nuts had changed too.  They used to look cute and tucked up, now they dangled and looked like they&#39;d flop around or something.  Were those really his balls, all this hair, what the fuck, no way!<br />
<br />
Devon wasn&#39;t sure whether to look in the mirror or look down at himself as he checked himself out, so he did both.  At first gingerly, he touched the pubes that had grown in, disgustingly.  And then as he got brave he really grabbed a clump to see what it felt like; wiry and not like regular hair at all, in his hand.<br />
<br />
He kept touching himself, touching one hand with the other, unable to believe how big they&#39;d gotten.  He touched the hair in his pits as he looked in the mirror, and on his lip with his finger.  He washed his hands after touching himself so much and then as he dried them, rubbed a wet finger on his lip just to see what happened, darkening the hair there.  Unbelievable.<br />
<br />
Devon decided he&#39;d better take a full shower as he felt gross, and of course his dick and balls were kind of damp and he was pretty sure he might have had a wet dream or something as it didn&#39;t seem to be pee.</p>
