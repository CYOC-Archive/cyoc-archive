<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Waking up had become Rachael’s favourite part of the day, since the most changes happened while she was asleep and she could view them all at once. She leapt naked out of bed to stand in front of her mirror in what was fast becoming a morning ritual. This time though, not all of her stopped moving when she landed. Her breasts looked even bigger than yesterday afternoon, perhaps a DD or E cup. She hefted the warm globes in her hands, soft flesh overflowing each palm. She twisted this way and that in front of the mirror, admiring her slender, curvy form.  She had a very pronounced hourglass figure now, a far cry from the overweight, depressed girl she had been a few days ago. Her shimmering copper hair had grown again and now cascaded down to her tiny waist in shiny waves. Her arms and legs were slim, toned and tanned and she had a face most models would die for, Rachael was on top of the world.<br />
<br />
Again she had trouble with what to wear. She only had the one skirt that would fit and she had worn it yesterday. All her dresses and pants were far too big on her now, but her blouses still fit, though she was big on top in other areas now, but she knew she could never fit into one of her Mom’s bras again. She settled on a supportive undershirt instead and hoped her nipples wouldn’t poke through or she’d die of embarrassment. Rachael knew none of her skirts would fit, but she thought her Mom might have something suitable so she went to raid her parents’ closet.<br />
<br />
Having found a, surprisingly short, blue skirt her Mom hadn’t worn for years, Rachael decide she would put on some makeup today. Normally she didn’t bother since highlighting how unattractive she was didn’t seem the best idea. Today though she actually felt pretty for the first time and wanted to show off a bit. She tied her long hair back in a ponytail, which proved quite difficult since she could have sworn it was thicker than yesterday. She pulled an elastic out of the drawer and tried to tie it the normal way, but it was so thick she couldn’t double it up to fit the elastic over it. She eventually had to work the tie up from the bottom of her waist-long mane but finally had it in place. <br />
<br />
Makeup presented another issue, she couldn’t find anywhere to put it. Her eyelashes were already long, dark and curly, her lips were already full and red, she didn’t need foundation and eventually gave up quite happily. Rachael was about to go down for breakfast when she thought about her Mom. She might not know the extent of Rachael’s transformation, but she must have noticed something. Still, Rachael decided to be discreet. She hunched her shoulders forward to try and hide her large unbound breasts and went downstairs for something to eat. <br />
<br />
“Morning dear, come and have some toast before you go.” Her Mom said without looking up from the paper.<br />
“Thanks Mom.” She said quietly and began searching for the honey. Her Mom put the paper down.<br />
“Oh, you didn’t tell me you were going to dye your hair, it looks nice.”<br />
“Um…yeah, I did it yesterday after school.” She hunched her shoulders self consciously and hoped her Mom couldn’t see her breasts. She could feel them pressing against her blouse.<br />
“It seems longer too, turn around dear.” Rachael sighed, still keeping her chest concealed and twisted slightly in her chair. “It’s very long now.” Her Mom commented.<br />
“Yeah, I uh…got extensions too. I’m gonna miss my bus.” She wolfed down the rest of her breakfast and ran for the door.<br />
“Rachael, is that my sk-” she didn’t hear the rest, she didn’t want to answer any more questions. She could explain away longer hair (extensions), a slimmer figure (diet), a prettier face (makeup), but she didn’t know what to day about her breasts. A good push-up bra couldn’t make an increase of five cup sizes and she would never think about implants. The best way at the moment was just to avoid the subject. <br />
<br />
 When she got on the bus she attracted a lot more attention than she ever had before. But it was strange, almost as if people were only looking at her to see what was different. As if everyone who got on the bus was different somehow and they just wanted to see what was new about her. As she climbed aboard, Rachael made the mistake of standing up straight and her big breasts pushed against her blouse and stood out for all to see. She blushed and hunched forward again, but not before everyone discovered her change and went back to looking out the windows. Since everyone seemed distracted, she took a moment to glance around and see what everyone else was so curious about. It seemed she wasn’t the only one who had changed. Another girl a few seats behind Rachael kept looking at things out the window, then pulling a pair of ugly thick glasses out of her pocket, squinting through them and putting them away again. It was as if she thought she should need them to see, but couldn’t understand why she didn’t. A boy in front of her, who she recognised as being in the chess club, kept feeling his bulging bicep every few minutes, as if to check it was still there and he wasn’t dreaming.<br />
<br />
Down the back of the bus, Rachael was disappointed to see, the popular people were as attractive as always. Then she saw something weird happen. One of the cheerleaders, a pretty, slim, brunette girl, leaned over to her football player boyfriend and said in a loud whisper.<br />
“Did you see that Rachael girl? I mean she must be really desperate to go get huge implants and put on that much makeup, what a skank!” she grinned evilly as she said it but then her expression changed to one of shock. The girl’s curvy figure was deflating where she sat. Her breasts got smaller, her bubble butt shrank, her hips became thinner and she got shorter. She became a stick figure and her boyfriend backed away as she screamed<br />
“Oh my God! What’s happening to me?” That just served to make everyone on the bus turn around and look at her. She went bright red and hid behind a seat. Everyone kept staring until she emerged a few minutes later, back to normal but still very scared. <br />
<br />
When she arrived at school, Rachael noticed a few more oddities like that around. She saw a group of cheerleaders laughing at an overweight girl as she walked past. The girl started to cry and run away but then stopped in amazement. Her fat was melting away, her breasts grew and her figure slimmed to an hourglass. Across the hall though, the opposite was happening to the cheerleaders as they put on weight at an amazing speed. After a few minutes of marvelling, from the now very attractive girl, and screaming, from the overweight cheerleaders, all returned to normal. It did seem to Rachael though, that the girl was a little less heavy and the cheerleaders a little less curvy. She saw a football jock standing threateningly over a smaller kid and demanding something, probably lunch money, but as he raised his fist, he started changing. He got smaller and within moments he was a scrawny little boy, and the kid he had been bullying now towered over him. The scrawny jock started running, but he was back to normal before he got to the end of the hall. He didn’t stop running though.<br />
<br />
It was only ten minutes into first period when Rachael got her first wolf whistle. She raised her hand to answer a question and her blouse tightened across her chest, letting the whole class see her enlarged bust. It took almost a quarter hour for the teacher to calm the guys down after that and he threw a frown at Rachael, as if she’d done it on purpose. When she left that class, buoyed up by her happiness there was a boy there waiting for her. She recognised him as Simon, a guy from the basketball team. He was tall, athletic and handsome and she knew he wouldn’t have given her the time of day before she changed.<br />
“Hey, you’re Rachael, right?” he asked with a grin.<br />
“Um…yeah.” She was nervous, no boy had ever looked at her like that before.<br />
“Has anyone ever told you you’re hot!” She blushed. “How about you meet me outside the science rooms at lunch, I’ve got something to show you.”<br />
“Okay…I’ll be there.” She said quietly.<br />
“Great, well I’ll see you later.” And he sauntered away, feeling very pleased with himself. Rachael was amazed, she’d just been asked out by a senior! Okay, so it wasn’t really a date, but it was about as close as you could get in the middle of the school day.<br />
<br />
Lunchtime couldn’t come fast enough for Rachael but she made it through the next few periods without causing any problems like she had that morning. Well, except when her hair burst out of its ponytail and sent the elastic flying across the room. She had shivered while her teacher was speaking about the War of Independence and suddenly her hair had fallen all about her face and shoulders. She guessed it must have gotten thicker because she felt more weight, but when she checked, it had also grown down past her cute butt. She got a few stares and some whispering, but her annoyed teacher quieted everyone fairly quickly. <br />
<br />
When the lunch bell rang she almost ran to the science rooms to meet Simon, something she had been looking forward to all morning. She waited a few minutes before Simon casually strolled up.<br />
“Hey there hottie, how’ve you been.”<br />
“Uhm…good. You said you had something to show me.”<br />
“Woah, slow down hottie, not here, inside.” He opened the science room door and waved her in. She walked inside and leant back against a bench, her breasts pushing upwards and out. She stared at some of the posters and heard Simon coming up behind her.<br />
“This is what I wanted to show you,” She turned to see him holding his throbbing erection through his open fly. “And I think you’ve got a few things to show me too. Two very big things.” He leered at reached for her top. She screamed as he pushed her against the wall and mauled her breasts through the fabric of her blouse. His tugging pulled some of the buttons off and he tore her undershirt to expose a cherry red nipple. She tried to push him away but he was too strong and he planted a sloppy kiss on her full, pouty lips. She only had one option left since she was sure he was going to rape her. Ignoring his rough handling, she reached down and softly gripped his shaft. He took it to mean she was giving in and backed off slightly. Then she squeezed viciously and his eyes opened wide in shock. He fell to the ground in the foetal position, clutching his groin and she stepped over him and ran for the door.<br />
<br />
Rachael fled down the hall, her unsupported breasts bouncing painfully against her chest. Running blindly, tears clouding her vision, her feet took her to her usual refuge from the world: study hall. She was lucky, there was no one else in there and she collapsed in a chair in the corner and sobbed into her hands.<br />
<br />
A few moments later, Kyle came running into the room and saw her crying at the back corner. He walked slowly over and pulled her hands away.<br />
“Hey, you look terrible, what happened.” He said gently. She looked up, saw a friendly face, threw her arms around him and clung on tightly. Kyle didn’t know what to do, he’d never had a girl throw herself on him before, especially not one as beautiful as Rachael had become. Still, he knew she was hurt and very vulnerable right now, so he patted her softly on the back and tried to comfort her. <br />
“Shh, it’s alright, you’re fine now, nothing’s going to happen, alright?” he sounded stupid, he knew, but couldn’t think of anything else to say. He’d seen her running past the lunchroom door and had rushed to see what was wrong. Her clothes were torn so he’d gone to his locker first and pulled out a clean shirt he kept there for gym class. That was important now, getting some clothes onto her, having two enormous breasts pressed into his chest was getting very distracting.<br />
“Here, put this on, you’re quite a mess.” He untangled himself from her and held out the shirt. She sniffled and took it gratefully. Kyle turned around to give her some privacy.<br />
“A-alright.” Rachael said quietly and he turned back. He didn’t know how she’d gotten it on, her full breasts stretched the fabric of the shirt to breaking point and her nipples were clearly visible. She sat despondently in the chair, eyes downcast and dishevelled hair curtaining her tear-stained face. Kyle sat down next to her.<br />
“Why don’t you tell me what happened.” Rachael wasn’t sure she was ready to talk about it, but talking to Kyle had helped last time and he had been so kind already.<br />
“The last couple of days…things have been happening to me. I’ve been…changing.” She began. “At first I loved it, I had been fat and ugly all my life and finally people would start to like me. Then today, a guy in my class asked me to meet him near the science rooms and I…I said yes.” Kyle could tell by her sad expression that she bitterly regretted that decision. “It’s just that nobody, besides you, had ever paid any attention to me. He called me a ‘hottie’ and said he had something to show me. Now I realise he just saw me as an object, something to be taken and enjoyed, not even a person. He…tried to rape me.” As she said those words, the images came back, the terror and she started wailing and crying again. Kyle reached over and put his arm around her and she clung to him again. She cried into his shoulder and he held her awkwardly, still not knowing exactly what to do when a beautiful girl was pressing herself against him. He felt her shiver in his arms and her breasts swelled against his chest. She broke the embrace and looked into his eyes, mutely asking if he had felt it too. He nodded and she looked down at the shirt he’d given her, now stretched far out of its original shape trying to hold in her F cup breasts.<br />
“I thought being pretty would be great. I thought people would like me. Now I almost wish I was back the way I used to be.” She said, still looking at her bulging breasts.<br />
“Almost?” he asked.<br />
“People treat me differently. Like I’m an object, like I’m just there for their pleasure. Like he did.” Kyle didn’t have to ask who he was. “I don’t have anything to wear, I don’t like lying to my Mom, but I don’t know what to tell her. I can’t tell her the truth, can I?”<br />
“What did you mean by ‘almost’?” he asked<br />
“Well…” she hung her head shyly “So far the only good thing about being pretty is the way you look at me now. A few days ago you were nice to me, nicer than anyone else had ever been. You’re still nice, but now it’s different.” She smiled at him.<br />
“Oh…um…Transform or Dare?” Kyle said softly, under his breath.<br />
“What?” Rachael asked, confused.<br />
“I said anyone who treats you like he did doesn’t come under the category of ‘people.’ He was an animal.” The minute was up. Rachael was touched by his disgust on her behalf, she gave Kyle a watery smile.<br />
“Thanks, that means a lot.”<br />
“For your transform, the original curse I used on you will continue, but members of your family will simply think you are special and accommodate you. Also, the clothes in your closet will change to suit whatever size you are.” He said it all under his breath and Rachael looked at him.<br />
“What are you saying?”<br />
“I said you’re a beautiful person, and not just on the outside. You deserve better.” She hugged him again. “For your dare, I dare you to say Transform or Dare back to me immediately, dare me to use the curse to get revenge on Simon and forget I ever used it on you.”<br />
“Transform or Dare?” she said over his shoulder, still hugging him.<br />
“Dare.” Kyle chose.<br />
“I dare you to use the curse to get revenge on Simon.” With that she snapped out of the curse-induced daze and pulled away from him.<br />
“Thank you Kyle, you’ve been so nice to me. You’re a really great friend.”<br />
“No problem. Hey, I think I’ll go have a little chat with Simon.”<br />
“Don’t go! I don’t want to see you get hurt. He’s very strong, believe me.”<br />
“Oh I don’t intend to fight him. I intend to get rid of him. Forever.” Rachael saw the determination in his eyes and hugged him again, this time intentionally pressing her breasts into him. Kyle was stunned. She gave him a quick kiss on the cheek and said<br />
“I’ll be here when you get back. Please be careful.”</p>
