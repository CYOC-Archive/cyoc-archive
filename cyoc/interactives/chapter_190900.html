<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Erika&#39;s mother Carol, exhausted by her day at the shop, hadn&#39;t sat on the couch for more than 10 minutes when her husband Daniel came home. He had been absent for a few days, as work often asked him to travel to give conferences in other cities.<br />
<br />
Daniel put his suitcase down and removed his work shoes before he walked to his wife and bend over the couch to give Carol a tender kiss.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope you had a nice trip,&quot; she said when the kiss ended.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not as nice as being back home with you, that&#39;s for certain&quot; Daniel teased her before settling in the couch with her. &quot;Exhausting. And I&#39;m famished!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m too tired to start cooking right now. I just came home too actually! Let me take a breath, Daniel. Your stomach can wait a little longer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daniel put an arm around Carol with a chuckle and let her lay her head against his shoulder. Her beautiful blonde hair smelled particularly nice and he closed his eyes for a moment.<br />
<br />
Carol felt a little more awake and alive, cuddling up against her husband&#39;s body. His musky scent always made her senses perk up a little. Or was it something in the air tonight? The air in the house felt a little hotter than usual perhaps.<br />
<br />
None of them had noticed the small cum stains on the couch, which Erika and Emily had covered in pheromones. The molecules found their way on the couple&#39;s clothes and in their nostrils, stirring up a certain mood in them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmh tell me, love, is Erika in her room right now?&quot; Daniel asked sort of absent-mindedly, feeling a slight swell in his pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;She just got out to walk Max and take some fresh air&quot;, Carol replied. &quot;Won&#39;t be back for a moment&quot; she added, looking down on Daniel&#39;s bulge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I guess I missed you that much. I couldn&#39;t help it...&quot; he started, but Carol cut him with another kiss, needy. He unbutonned her shirt and opened it, removing her bra to grab onto his wife&#39;s breasts. She opened his pants and pulled his erection free from his underwear.<br />
<br />
The daily routine of work and having a child growing under their roof hadn&#39;t done much good to their sex life over the years. Having sex at fixed hours, basically when Erika was asleep and the adults laid exhausted in bed, was not the most exciting setup. So right now, Carol and Daniel were cherishing this little spark of adventure that they could steal while Erika was outside, unaware of the effects the volatile chemicals she had left behind were having on their libido.<br />
<br />
All that Carol could feel was that she hadn&#39;t felt that turned on by her husband in a very long while. She wanted him, right now, without any hesitation and without having to wait. She removed her underwear and threw it aside. She hadn&#39;t had the time to get very wet yet though, and she let out a frustrated grunt as she realized that this ride wouldn&#39;t be the most comfortable right away.<br />
<br />
On that moment, as she was sitting on Daniel, facing him, her knee hit something. Daniel looked at his side and picked up something. Some kind of small bottle or vial.<br />
<br />
The salve.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that, some kind of lubricant? Looks almost empty&quot; Carol said, her voice growing more and more needy by the minute. &quot;Hurry up, we don&#39;t have all night...&quot; she almost whimpered in his ear.<br />
<br />
Daniel shrugged a little and aimed the salve at his erect member, spraying his length in a smooth motion with the remainder of the salve before discarding the bottle on the side, which fell between the cushions of the couch.<br />
<br />
Before he had the time to prepare himself though, Carol gave him another hungry kiss and sat herself on his dick, pressing her vulva against the glistening head and pushing down with her weight. Daniel almost let out a howl as he felt a wave of pleasure ring through his cock. The sensation was stranger than usual, and also much stronger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, was that some kind of clitoral stimulant or something? I... ah...&quot; Daniel started and trailed off as his wife was picking up the pace and moaning.<br />
<br />
She just couldn&#39;t slow down, her vagina hungry for action and juices finally coming. And she could feel Daniel&#39;s cock swelling so much, filling her up entierely, stretching her insides while her clit rubbed against the base of Daniel&#39;s dick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Daniel, you&#39;re so big, it feels perfect!&quot; she let out between two moans of pleasure. Meanwhile, Daniel couldn&#39;t believe how hard he was feeling; it was like his cock kept on swelling and swelling, and his wife was getting tighter around him. The feeling was so intense, and he could almost hear his balls churning while they, too, felt more swollen than ever.<br />
<br />
He tried to back up a little, but he was locked in the couch by his wife, and somehow his cock felt locked inside his wife as well, as though it was too big to slide out. Daniel did not realize, of course, that he had grown an impressive knot, and his now canine balls were about to shoot a massive load into his wife&#39;s belly.<br />
<br />
As his pointy dick hit Carol&#39;s walls one more time, she let out a lewd scream of ecstasy and reached climax, contracting around his length and knot and tipping him over the edge. He felt his balls draw tight against his body and one, then another and a third explosion of cum escaped him to fill his wife&#39;s womb.<br />
<br />
The last gush of semen felt like an eternity, his cock throbbing against the fleshy walls - Daniel unable to pull out as Carol hung around his neck, her breasts pressed against his sweaty chest. The two of them held each other for a few minutes as they tried to catch their breath, unable to think clearly after being hit by such a strong orgasm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha... Carol, what has gotten into you? That was incredible...&quot; Daniel laughed a little, his member softening and sliding out of his wife. She blushed a little, for the first time tonight embarassed by her own actions.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I don&#39;t know! I think I need to clean up a little, before Erika returns with the dog,&quot; she said to excuse herself, grabbing her things and heading for the bathroom with juices running down the inside of her legs.</p>
