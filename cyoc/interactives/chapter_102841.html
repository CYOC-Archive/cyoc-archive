<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You&#39;d want to be a mother?&quot; Lucie asked slowly to Tabitha.<br />
<br />
&quot;And the mother of YOUR kittens,&quot; Tabitha, Tabby for short, replied and took Lucie&#39;s hand, &quot;I know I kinda messed things up for you getting drunk and becoming a werecat... but that doesn&#39;t mean I EVER stopped loving you or didn&#39;t want to be with you. I would have been more than happy to have you be a different were-beast species from me so that the two of us could be a happy were couple like any other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t like me as a werecat?&quot; Lucie asked weakly before Tabby pulled Lucie into a firm hug and delivered a very passionate and loving kiss.<br />
<br />
After a few moments of tongue wrestling, which Lucie did enjoy and actually found herself growing wet for the first time since her transformation was completed as a result, the two came up for air. Lucie found Tabby smiling and holding onto her firmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What you are doesn&#39;t matter,&quot; Tabby answered, &quot;I think you make a very cute werecat. Your boobs could be bigger, but you&#39;re still cute, and that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ve stopped loving you.&quot; <br />
<br />
Lucie managed a smile as she did detect some humor in Tabby&#39;s voice on the part about her chest. She did sound sincere though about loving her. Lucie thanked her and the two hugged before she yawned, as it was getting late. Tabby did pick up on this and helped Lucie over to her bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to let you rest for now, Lucie,&quot; Tabby said to her, &quot;and I&#39;ll see you in the morning. It&#39;ll be bright and early, as we&#39;ll have to go into the police to deal with the fines related to not having you properly tested...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But magic negates all that...&quot; Lucie said weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;NOT as far as the law is concerned,&quot; Tabby answered, &quot;and we&#39;re both lucky that ALL I&#39;d get out of this is a fine and a slap on the wrist. And if it means you&#39;ll be with me again and be cheerful... the person I remember again, I&#39;ll pay it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m very different from what I was,&quot; Lucie reminded Tabby.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Tabby smiled, &quot;and in time, I hope to show you all the fun being a woman can be, but for the moment we still have things we MUST do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucie slowly nodded and climbed into her bed. Tabby slowly walked back to the door to the bedroom and smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll bring you some of my undies in the morning, and we can do some shopping tomorrow for some clothing that work better with your knew form,&quot; Tabby said to Lucie and then departed.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Saturday morning came early, and Lucie was awakened to the sound of her doorbell ringing. She found it was a little after six and grumbled at first before remembering her mission  for the day, to deal with the issues that related her transformation and Moon Lake&#39;s laws. She found Tabby waiting at the door with a small bag held in front of her. After a rushed breakfast, Tabby helped Lucie get dressed, which lead to some amusement on Tabby&#39;s part.<br />
<br />
Having been born male and living life as a male, and as a firmly straight male, Lucie as Luc had never worn woman&#39;s underwear and wasn&#39;t initially comfortable with even the simple cotton pair that Tabby had presented to her to wear. It took a little bit of coaxing, but Lucie did eventually relent. They didn&#39;t fit too bad for plain cotton panties, but Lucie did feel they fit rather odd on her. Tabby assured her that she looked good in them. Eventually, Tabby did manage to get Lucie dressed, though her outer clothing was all &quot;Luc&#39;s&quot; old clothing and much to Lucie&#39;s disappointment, she found that her old male clothing didn&#39;t fit her quite as well as it used to. The shirts were okay, but the pants didn&#39;t quite fit right, as they weren&#39;t cut to fit her new hips and rear which were wider than her waist. Tabby assured her that they could and would get some clothes that would fit the new her much better.<br />
<br />
Eventually they made their way to Moon Lake&#39;s police station and found Samantha Twist waiting for them. She met them just inside the door to the building and even held it for them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning,&quot; Lucie said politely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning,&quot; Samantha said slowly, &quot;are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty good... no visions since last night,&quot; Lucie answered, though not making mention of the fact that her last &quot;vision&quot; made her think that she had gotten Tabby pregnant. Tabby didn&#39;t mention it either, though, mostly because she had missed her werecat birth control pill for yesterday because of Luc&#39;s call. It made the possibility that Tabby was pregnant very real.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was referring more to your health,&quot; Samantha spoke, privately certain that these &quot;visions&quot; were the result of her body&#39;s dramatic and drastic change, &quot;This is something that is rare... in fact you are the SECOND man in Moon Lake&#39;s history to go through such a change, and the first has had plenty of difficulties that she&#39;s had to overcome.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I&#39;ve felt good, no problems,&quot; Lucie answered, &quot;other than that my pants don&#39;t fit anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha only nodded, and ushered them forward. What followed was an extensive series of paperwork and statements with the desk officer on duty. Lucie and Tabby stated that their liaison was perfectly willing and that Tabby didn&#39;t force herself on Lucie and that Lucie had obviously survived and become a fully functional werecat. This absolved Tabby of a Statute 1A charge and a Statute 1 charge. Samantha stated that since Lucie had lived, the city wasn&#39;t going to press charges. However, Luc had never been tested prior to his transformation into Lucie. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; the desk officer, a weredog, sighed, &quot;That will be a violation of the new regulations concerning the transformation of normals into a single gender were-beast species. With no charges related to Statute 1 and Statute 1A, that will mean, Tabitha Halberd, that you are to pay a fine of fifty dollars for that violation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does it have to be that high?&quot; Lucie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;They are the rules,&quot; the desk officer answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay, Lucie,&quot; Tabby said back to her and wrote out the check to pay the fine, and handed it into the officer.<br />
<br />
The desk officer took it and nodded. With that, their first mission was done.</p>
