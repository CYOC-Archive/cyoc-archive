<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Albert was a quiet boy. A tiny little 12-year-old, whose growth spurt wouldn’t even do him much good. Black, messy, unkempt hair, wide, cricle-framed glass, and the clearest blue eyes alight on a large topped on a scrawny, twig-like body. It was no wonder he came home to bruises and injuries every day, clutching his books. <br />
<br />
Some of them were the typical books a 12-year-old would read, books on knights and dragons and swords and magic. Others were the more advanced kind, science and philosophy and politics. He was very smart. Very quiet. Didn’t even converse much on the internet. His parents were loud and overbearing. Divorced too. So he just had himself. <br />
<br />
One day, poor little Albert, after an especially good beating from the bullies over his book on fairies, had decided enough was enough, and, backpack and all, decided to find a more quiet corner of the world to reside in. <br />
<br />
The park. <br />
<br />
Here Albert slowly opened the book. Read page after page. Until a small little note slip from between its pages, held together by the force of the thick leather binding that Albert could barely lift.<br />
<br />
Curiosity filled Albert’s clear blue eyes, as he picked up the note and inspected it. <br />
<br />
“To my dear reader, this note is for you. Just answer the following questions…” He read aloud. <br />
<br />
Albert thought it interesting. An interactive part of the book. Maybe someone already answered it, but he took out a pen nonetheless (to keep his answers honest), and opened the folded piece of paper. <br />
<br />
“Question 1: If you were a girl... would your handwriting be nice?”<br />
<br />
Huh? This… was not what he was expecting. But it seemed empty. And he needed something to do to pass the time. <br />
<br />
“Yes. It would flourish and spin, like the sparkles of night, or the vines which crawl upon a stone wall. It could fall in blocky straight letters, or fly to the moon if need be.” <br />
<br />
Satisfied with his answer, he moved on, not knowing that his neat, small letters seemed to sparkle and spin more, just as he said, until they themselves were a piece of art. <br />
<br />
Question 2: If you were a girl... would you like pink?<br />
<br />
Albert thought again. He assumed he would have to think constantly here. <br />
<br />
“Pink is a lovely color, when not excessive, but my favorites would likely remain the purples and greens that I enjoy watching from the trees and the sky.”<br />
<br />
Question 3: If you were a girl... would your hair be straight or curly? <br />
<br />
Again, a strange question. <br />
<br />
“Curly. But in long, natural curls, so that a bed’s rest would look equivalent to a post-shower.” <br />
<br />
Albert’s hair already had some curls, but they curled even more so, giving him a cute haircut. <br />
<br />
Question 4: If you were a girl... what would be your favorite color?<br />
<br />
The question seemed redundant, but oh well. <br />
<br />
“Same as mentioned above. Greens and purples.”<br />
<br />
Question 5: If you were a girl... what color would your hair be?<br />
<br />
A tough question. But he had an answer. Something he had always imagined the girl of his dreams would be. <br />
<br />
“It would reach that shade of brown it which it shows like fire in the dying light of sunset, but lightens up to the light brown of a doe’s coat at night. During the day it would reach a peace with the color Auburn, always shining whether day or night.”<br />
<br />
Unbeknownst to our wishing child, his hair color turned eactly that, his new curls turning into fiery shade of red as the sun began to set. <br />
<br />
Question 6: If you were a girl... what color would your eyes be?<br />
<br />
Albert was always complimented by his mum about his clear blue eyes. He hated them because of it. <br />
<br />
“Green. Emerald green. As pure as a polished gem, clearer than a clear sea, with the reflection of the world around them.”<br />
<br />
It is said, it is done, his clear eyes now that brilliant shade of emerald green. <br />
<br />
<br />
Question 7: If you were a girl... would you like makeup?<br />
<br />
Her mom was a huge makeup fan, caked it on to hide her bruises and tears. <br />
<br />
“No. Whether in tears, rain, snow, shine, I would look beautiful without any makeup.”<br />
<br />
It was strange to see this face on a young boy’s body, but his answer came true, as his lips seemed to plump up ever so slightly, with every movement of their corners perfect as they were pursed. His skin cleared, the beginnings of acne faded away, as what remained was beautiful pale white skin. His eyes widened, the size of a doe’s, making his new emerald eyes more clear. His boy’s jawline smoothened, his nose more button-like, and his eyelashes so perfectly long and full, you would think it is makeup with how dark and perfect they were.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 8: If you were a girl... would you be sporty?<br />
<br />
Albert blink, his eyes itchy. <br />
<br />
He thought hard about this one. Oh, how he wish he could get back at those bullies. Oh how he wished he could be the heroine of some story. <br />
<br />
“No. I would be born lean and strong, with legs that can move faster than the wind, and arms that can lift a tree, but yet would still look the image of dainty, thin, feminine woman.”<br />
<br />
Albert’s skin started to itch slightly, as his body slowly reshaped into that of a girl’s, eith a little wider hips, thinner shoulders, but nothing to drastic considering his already thin waist. But once he had a chance to stand, the difference would be clear. At least he now felt more energetic, which was strange to the ignorant child. <br />
<br />
Question 9: If you were a girl... would you wear high heels?<br />
<br />
Albert shrugged, not knowing much.<br />
<br />
“As much as any other girl.”<br />
<br />
A slight change to his sneakers, as they turned white with a pink stripe on them. <br />
<br />
Question 10: If you were a girl... would you wear a skirt?<br />
<br />
“Same as above.”<br />
<br />
A little drafty now, but Albert attributed it to the cold and his shorts. <br />
<br />
Question 11: If you were a girl... would you wear jewelry?<br />
<br />
“Also same as above…” he paused for a moment, “but it would be simple, beautiful, and tasteful, like elven jewelry.”<br />
<br />
A silver band appeared on both his arms with a small emerald on them and Albert jumped in surprise. Realizing the change in clothes, his hair, he didn’t need a mirror to know his face changed too. He stood up and suddenly he felt like he could fly as he took a quick lap around the park, no sweat. He laughed, joyously. <br />
<br />
“I gotta finish that questionnaire!” His voice seemed higher? He didn’t care, he knew what was coming, and he was excited for it now. A chance to change his life for the better?<br />
<br />
Question 12: If you were a girl... what size would your breasts be?<br />
<br />
An immediate blush. Maybe from the blood rushing to his head? But this was embarrassing. He knew cup sizes. He read about them in a more… adult book. And he knew what size seemed good. <br />
<br />
“They would grow up to be a D-cup.” <br />
<br />
A slight pushing, as Albert’s chest was more sensitive now, at the beginning of puberty, but there was nothing more. Albert knew he had to grow older for their full size, and he turned redder just thinking about it. <br />
<br />
Question 13: If you were a girl... would you be into guys?<br />
<br />
He stopped. He supposed he liked girls, and he’s read of many girls being into guys. He just wasn’t sure yet. But maybe he should keep his options open. Pragmatic for his age, to say the least. <br />
<br />
“I would be into both girls and guys.” <br />
<br />
Suddenly he was much much more aware of both his own genitalia, and the images of boys and girls he can imagine now that he was into them. His dick started to arise as his arousal did too. <br />
<br />
Question 14: If you were a girl... would you shave?<br />
<br />
As a hairless little boy, he wasn’t entirely sure what the question meant.<br />
<br />
“I wouldn’t have any hair besides the one on my head, like always, as it should be.” He answered, confused. But now his hairless days were set. <br />
<br />
Question 15: If you were a girl... would you use pads or tampons?<br />
<br />
He knew nothing about these. What were they? Pads? Tampons? He’ll go with the simple answer. <br />
<br />
“Whichever is more comfortable.”<br />
<br />
A shot of pain through the stomach, as he felt that little weewee, the penis that he could feel tent his pants immediately wet them, the stuff coming out sticky and gross smelling, like the mildew in his attic room. What was it? Magic? <br />
<br />
As his insides rearranged, so did his underwear, leaving him an underdeveloped vagina and panties, both now slightly wet. But that felt surprisingly… good. Is that what the adults felt in those big books?<br />
<br />
Question 16: If you were a girl... what type of shirt would you be wearing right now?<br />
<br />
“A simple blouse. With a jean jacket over it. Nothing extravagant.”<br />
<br />
Question 17: If you would were a girl... would you be wearing briefs, bikini, thong or boxers?<br />
<br />
What were these? He had no clue. He only knew briefs and boxers. Maybe briefs were better, since he knew boys wore boxers?<br />
<br />
“Briefs.”<br />
<br />
Question 18: If you were a girl... what would be your intelligence? One being stupid and ten being high enough to drive the class nerd up the wall.<br />
<br />
Well. Albert. She. Wow, that was weird to think about. She was already smart. But she didn’t want to be on top. She knew what they did to people on top. Yet she wanted to still be smart enough to survive. <br />
<br />
“8. Smart enough to do anything I want to with no issue.”<br />
<br />
Question 19: If you were a girl... what type of bra would you be wearing?<br />
<br />
This he had no clue. Uh….<br />
<br />
“A normal bra.”<br />
<br />
Question 20: If you were a girl... how old would you be, how tall would you be without shoes and what would you weigh without clothes?(Don&#39;t lie)<br />
<br />
The real answer. <br />
<br />
“18 years old, a freshman in a good university, I’d be 5’8” (taller than some boys!) and 160 lbs (due to my lean muscle).” <br />
<br />
A yelp of pain as Albert grew older. Breasts pushed out of his shirt as his bones creaked, his skin stretching, almost unable to handle the sudden growth, as his hips widen, his thighs fattened, as he now grew feet, until he was almost unfamiliar with his surroundings, having never seen the world up so high. She touched her new breasts. Wow, they were big. And kinda heavy. But she was strong, so they felt like nothing. It felt good to touch. She might try again later, as new memories flooded in. She’s still a virgin apparently. She blushed. But the masturbating (she knew what that was now!)  was constant.<br />
<br />
Question 21: If you were a girl... what would your name be?<br />
<br />
“Crystal. Crystal Coriander.” Like a superhero. <br />
<br />
Immediately she remembered something. Tonight should be the night her boyfriend and girlfriend both take her firsts. She couldn’t wait. She jumped up and ran off, quickly grabbing her backpack along the way, leaving behind the book of fairies and the note. She was eager, and a little horny, but as her life as a sad, little boy faded away, she knew she was going to be very happy in this life.</p>
