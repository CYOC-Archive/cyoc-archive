<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The first thing Janace did was stretch some before taking hir first step on all fours. Snowy had to have hir step to an x-ray machine, due to the fear of hir rib becoming worse. On the contrary, it did just the opposite. The rib had healed back up and even became stronger. Hir body flowed with the DNA of the four animals that made hir new body. Shi looked around. &quot;Wow, this, is a.... amazing. Why hadn&#39;t this been discovered sooner?&quot;<br />
<br />
Maurice walked up and smiled. &quot;It was. A little over twelve years ago.&quot; Shi replied. &quot;Forgive me, Miss Cain, it&#39;s Maurice.&quot; Shi said softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;My, Maurice, now I can say you are litterally one cool cat.&quot; Janace giggled. &quot;And drop the formalities. I took back Alexandria as it was my Maden name. Anyway, thank you, for this gift. I heard you and Cat were behind the genius.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yes, and started the first of all the outbreaks.&quot; Maurice looked at hir.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hun, how could you have known it would&#39;ve turned out as bad as it did? Your hearts, as crazy as you two are, were in the right place, however your mind was in your ass.&quot; Janace hugged Maurice. &quot;Now if you will excuse me, I want to see the city that my children have started. Though I could&#39;ve sworn Jess wanted a ranch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Nikole smiled. &quot;Shi did start that ranch. It&#39;s just on the outskirts of town. Call it the UN&#39;s way of saying thanks to us all.&quot; Shi took Janace out. &quot;Though you know, if I weren&#39;t mated to Jess, I&#39;d take you where you stand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nikole, I&#39;m not....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t say it. The way  you&#39;re built, the sexuallity issue is gone. We have no sexuallity.&quot; Shi giggled. &quot;Now, let&#39;s show you the rest of the beloved city.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Janace smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we did good, love. Now most of their families are whole again. I do have an idea for Charlie and Brent.&quot; Shi looked. &quot;Casey, can you get a satalite to search for Mr. Wise?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ssssure, but why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I intend to unite father with his sons, or should I say daughters. I know Nikole wouldn&#39;t want it, but shi should know it&#39;s a matter of time before they cross paths. Once you find them, have Chris and Christine swim to his location and tell him his sons are in trouble. He&#39;ll come, knowing Charles, Sr, and how close he was to Charlie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Casey nodded. &quot;Alright. I&#39;ll ssstep on it.&quot; Shi took off.<br />
<br />
---------------------------<br />
<br />
Nikole had decided to take Janace to the orphanage. &quot;You know, I got a good idea, you love the idea of raising children, your purrrfect position would be working in the orphanage.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That... wait, what gave you that idea?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How happy you were to meet your grandchildren. Hun, from the first day we met, I knew you loved children. Funny, last you saw Sally and Charlie, they were in seperate appartments, now, they have.... let&#39;s see, Luna, Midnight..... nine children... I think. And they&#39;re already grandparents.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;By way of adoption, and that is amazin...&quot; Shi looked up and saw Sammy walk up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nikole, we&#39;ve got a problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it Sammy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it seems the entire eastern seaboard from Boston to DC is under full scale quarentine. The President just arrived and as did the Vice President. They need a place to stay for the time being.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell them they are welcome to use my home to stay, as long as they like.&quot; Nikole said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Sammy ran off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, the largest outbreak. I think we&#39;re in for a long haul. I have to get my things ready. Seeing as I&#39;m not pregnant, as with Snowy and Maurice, we&#39;re likely to be called to go to DC to meet the outbreak at that end, so the others and I can catch it before it covers the full east coast. I fear though that soon the entirety of the US may become, along with Canada, and I speak of the eastern half, will become Chakat States of America.&quot; Shi looks over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, then, I&#39;ll prep my bags too, well I would if I had any.&quot; Shi smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;For what? You just arived and your daughters need to spend time with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nikole Assandra Wittman, if you think for one second that I will stay behind, when I could serve a better good in helping, you are out of your fucking mind. I will have plenty of time to spend when these &#39;outbreaks&#39; are all finished. So don&#39;t you patronize me. You are preparing to leave your own children to do this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nikole smiled. &quot;I figured you&#39;d say as much. Come.&quot; Shi led hir friend. &quot;Let us finish your tour first, okay?&quot; Shi giggled. &quot;It&#39;s not an official order to be leaving yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;True.&quot; Shi giggled.<br />
<br />
Nikole walks with hir best friend. Shi hadn&#39;t used Wittman in such a long time, since shi married Charlie and Brent&#39;s father. Shi looked over. &quot;Funny, when I look back, I see you, Justin, Maurice, Cathrine, and Charles in highschool just having a good time. Now all save one is in this very town.&quot; Shi rubbed on Janace&#39;s shoulder. Just then Reca was laying in the sun, foot stuck between two boards.<br />
<br />
Janace giggled and walked up. &quot;Hold on, little pup.&quot; Shi bent down and helpped Reca free. At that moment as they continued their tour, hir granddaughter, and shi can actually say that shi is hir granddaughter alone by blood, Justin as well, but still, and Nikoles through hir daughter in-law, Reca decided to walk beside grandma Janace. Though Nikole swore it was cause shi was curious about the four tails and eight ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grandma? Can... you carry me?&quot; Reca asked softly.<br />
<br />
Janace smiled. &quot;Come here you little rascal.&quot; Shi lifted hir as they continued their tour. Reca and Janace became fast pals. They even managed to get Diamond to tag along who Nikole was happy to carry.<br />
<br />
Janace&#39;s first day in Janace was anything but eventful as shi held hir granddaughter. Hir and Nikole carried the two to their home. &quot;I believe Sally and Charlie have set up a room for you to get comfortable, Janace. So here you are. Now that you&#39;ve seen everything, including what it&#39;s like to be a kat, I suppose you want some rest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do. I most certainly do. Come one you two, your mom and dad probably want you in.&quot; Shi led them inside.<br />
<br />
Fortunately for Janace, Snowy had called Sally and Charlie to let them know shi had accepted the changes to become a kat. And well, to everyone&#39;s surprise adjusted very well, so when shi walked in, hir daughter greeted hir. &quot;Hello mom.&quot; Sally smiled, watching the right four ears twitch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh dear, Sally, You know, if I focus my ears, I can hear eight heart beats from you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, that&#39;s crazy, that would be too crazy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hun, don&#39;t say that. I know what I hear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit. Mom, I hope you&#39;re wrong, cause that would mean I have triplets in my belly.&quot; Shi walks out headed to the clinic.<br />
<br />
Charlie looks. &quot;Hello Janace. Um... were you joking about what you said, I&#39;ve heard canine ears were.... able to pick up the faintest sounds, but....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Charlie, I don&#39;t joke when it comes to my daughters health. And as for you, you only have four heart beats.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that&#39;s a relief. Here, I&#39;ll show you your room.&quot; Charlie smiled. &quot;Considering it&#39;s Reca&#39;s room, I doubt shi&#39;ll object considering how shi&#39;s clinging to you already.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Grandma smells a lot like mom.&quot; Shi giggled.<br />
<br />
Janace smiled. &quot;Such a sweet heart.&quot; Shi walked right into the room and looked around, spying two beds, one for her, the other for Reca. Charlie had left Janace and Reca and went back to the living room to watch the rest of hir show. Janace stretched out and went to hir bed and lied down. Reca, being Reca, decided to lay by grandma, who just purred as the little one curled up at hir upper torso. Both were out by the time Sally returned to confirm what hir mother told hir.</p>
