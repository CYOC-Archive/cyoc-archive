<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Martin spent the morning wearing her own now oversized clothes exploring the internet. She had been determined that she would just stay in her unit and wait out the 12 hours until she should be able to change back to her own body. She had also resisted the temptation to look at her own body (In an attempt to preserve her mothers dignity, but also the fact that having a 85 year old female body wasn&#39;t exactly a turn-on)..... But.... then she started feeling dizzy and found herself sweating. Those symptoms prompted her to remember that her mother was an insulin dependant diabetic. She could recall her mother being hospitalised multiple times because she had allowed her glucose levels to become too low. Was the same thing now happening to her?<br />
<br />
Getting into a bit of a panic, Martin searched her unit for medication, but there was none. She recalled glucose lollies were another option but she had none of those either. She ate a chocolate bar that was all she had in the house, but that did nothing to relieve her symptoms. Glumly she realised she had no choice to leave the unit and get to the local drugstore - and she needed to hurry!<br />
<br />
Fortunately she had a collection of clothes that belonged to her mother. There wasn&#39;t enough storage at her mother&#39;s nursing home unit. That now came in handy. In the days before putting her mother into the nursing home she had on many occasions had to dress her. That now came in handy as she was able to dress herself, including putting on a bra. However she drew the line at wearing her mother&#39;s incontinence underwear and stuck with a pair of her own briefs, even if they were rather loose where a favourite organ of Martin&#39;s was no longer present. Not wanting to wear a dress she put on a pair of her mother&#39;s slacks and a plain tan shirt. <br />
<br />
The dizziness was getting worse by the time Martin found a pair of her mother&#39;s slippers. She slipped them on. Then thought better than to leave the medallion, the value of which she now appreciated, sitting on her desk near the computer. Looking for a safe hiding space she hid it in a shoe box which she placed as high as she could now reach on her bookshelf. She placed some books in front of the box so it was well hidden.<br />
<br />
Nervous at going out in public but desperate for medication she left the unit. She was unaware that she had left her wallet and keys behind and effectively locked herself out.  She shuffled off towards the drugstore at her now very slow walking pace.<br />
<br />
At about the same time, Bambi (formerly Sam) was changing into a skimpy Bikini, in a room on the now moving boat, with a black girl by the name of Darlene who was also in Tony&#39;s stable. It was only when talking with Darlene that Bambi found out that Tony liked all his girls where he could &quot;Take care of them&quot; which Darlene then went on to explain as  &quot;We all live together in a block of units. I hear you will be my new flat mate&quot;. <br />
<br />
Bella later confirmed what Darlene had told her &quot;Surely that&#39;s not a surprise to you Bambi. You know how Tony operates. He takes a bigger cut than Skeesy, but provides accommodation and discounted drugs&quot; <br />
<br />
The former Sam briefly considered doing a &#39;Marcia&#39; and jumping off the boat, but the shore seemed a fair distance away and was receding quickly. She didn&#39;t even know whether her current body could even  swim. Reluctantly she followed the other girls to the lounge where the party was waiting for them.<br />
.......<br />
Marcia (Jordan) and Samantha (Bambi) returned to the motel having not found the new Bambi. Samantha didn&#39;t initially understand what was going on. Her unit was cleaned out. A neighbour who didn&#39;t recognises Samantha told her that &quot;Bambi moved out this morning. Some of Tony Musko&#39;s goons were here taking all her stuff. I would assume she has joined his stable. I&#39;ve heard her old pimp has gone missing&quot;<br />
<br />
The walked back via the bar but were turned away as soon as they were recognised by staff members. They did notice that the posters that had been there the previous day, offering a reward for the return of the medallion, were gone.<br />
<br />
As they morosely trudged back to the motel, Samantha explained to Marcia who Tony Musko was. The good news was that Samantha knew where Tony accommodated his girls. The bad news was that &quot;He get&#39;s his girls addicted to drugs and dependant on him. It will be hard to extract her from his stable&quot;<br />
<br />
They did notice an ambulance outside a drugstore not far from the motel. Some paramedics were attending to elderly woman who appeared to have had some medical episode on the footpath. They crossed to the other side of the road so as to not inconvenience the emergency workers.<br />
.......<br />
Several hours away Jordan (Bruce) and Belinda (Skeesy) were busy shopping for their birthday surprise for Sam (Janet). Belinda had totally forgotten her angst about the medallion going missing. It was exiting to choose the matching outfits, including lingerie, that she and Jordan would wear. Jordan had even convinced her to join her in booking at a day spa, where they could get their hair styled and be professionally made up on the morning of Sam&#39;s birthday.</p>
