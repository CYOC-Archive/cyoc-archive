<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After Erika showed Maria her greater height, the latter tried to avoid the former whenever possible unless she was wearing heels.<br />
Maria couldn’t comprehend the thought of her little sister being taller than she was.<br />
This meant that even inside the house, in things such as family dinner, Maria wore her heels.<br />
<br />
That caught Erika’s attention, and she used it to tease her sister in many possibilities.<br />
“Why are you wearing the hells in home? Aren’t they uncomfortable?” she commonly said in a teasing tone.<br />
“Are you afraid of feeling short next to somebody?”<br />
<br />
Over the next few weeks, Maria noticed that even in her 4 inch heels, Erika was closing the gap between them. This made the older sibling afraid of the thought of Erika standing taller than her even when she’s elevated by her heels, and she started avoiding her little sister even more.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Erika was enjoying her life. She loved the fact that she outgrew her sister, and teasing her about that fact, but she also loved her blossoming body for other reasons.<br />
Her more mature appearance made people act to her in a more respectable manner.<br />
Her height allowed her to reach things up high far easier, and made her noticeable in the crowd.<br />
And well, she also liked being hot. She liked the attention people paid her her on the street, probably thinking she is years older than she actually is.<br />
And even outside her looks, she was now a genius among her age group, to the point teachers started considering to move her up multiple grades to match her with the learned subjects.<br />
<br />
Back to her looks, every morning, she measured her height next to the wall of her room, and her growth was very clear, even in the difference of a week.<br />
Still, she waited for a specific point, where she could truly take revenge on Maria.<br />
<br />
Five months have passed since Erika started growing, and Maria was searching her closet for her favorite bra, but she couldn’t find it. She knew what it most likely meant. Erika probably stole her bra. She already stole her clothes many times over the last month (though she did it less and less as it passed), but this was too far!<br />
<br />
She knew that to get her bra back, she had to confront her younger sister.<br />
Putting on her heels, she went to her sister’s room and barged in.<br />
“Erika! Give me back my bra! I know you stole it.”<br />
<br />
As she looked around the room, Maria saw Erika lying on her bed, playing on her phone in her underwear.<br />
And wearing the exact same bra she expected to.<br />
<br />
As Erika moved her sight from her phone, a smile formed on her face.<br />
“Alright sis, I’ll give it back” she said as she moved to a sitting position on the edge of the bed.<br />
Then, she stood up in front of her sister, looking at her eye to eye, from the same vantage point.<br />
<br />
Maria was shocked. She knew that this was about to come, but she tried to hold the thought back as much as possible. Her little sister was as tall as she was in heels, meaning she was 4 inches taller than her barefoot height, or 6’2…<br />
<br />
“Besides, the bra feels too small”<br />
And then Maria moved her glance down, to her sibling’s chest. They were spilling over the cups, being about a size too large.<br />
Her little sister wasn’t just 4 inches taller than her, but also bigger breasted than she was.<br />
<br />
“Erika, give them back!” Maria tried to stay firm.<br />
“I will” Erika replied, as she closed the rooms’s door. “But I have one requirement”<br />
<br />
“And what’s that requirement?” Maria asked, getting scared.<br />
“I want us to compare our bodies.” Erika replied. “Barefoot, and naked”<br />
<br />
After some hesitation, Maria agreed, and removed her clothes and heels while Erika removed her bra and underwear.<br />
And without the heels, the height difference became very clear. Erika towered over her older siblings with pride, while Maria was staring at her younger sister’s neck.<br />
“Looks like you’re now the ‘shrimp’ doesn’t it?” Erika said in a very happy manner as she bent down in a teasing manner to be at eye level with her sister.<br />
Maria hated every moment of this. She used to tease and bully Erika countless times when she was taller and more developed than her, and now all of it comes back to bite her in the ass as the tables have turned.<br />
<br />
“And now, our bodies” Erika continued<br />
While not drastically bigger, it was clear that Erika had larger breasts and a bigger ass than Maria.<br />
Putting the curves aside, Erika was now also proportionally leggier than Maria, with most of her additional height going to her legs.<br />
“This explains why the bra was uncomfortable. I was too big for it” Erika said while grabbing her blossoming chest and moving it up and down.<br />
“Looks like I won’t steal any more clothes from you. You must be happy about it.” She continued in a teasing manner.<br />
<br />
Maria absolutely hated it.<br />
It was one thing that her sister was her size, but now that she’s bigger than her? And hotter than her? This was wrong. Very wrong.<br />
And the fact that Erika wasn’t even 12 made it worse. A 17 year old beaten by her 11 and a half year old sister…<br />
<br />
Erika then picked up the bra, and threw it to her sister. “Here sis, enjoy your underwear”<br />
Maria then hurried out of the room in shame, leaving Erika smiling in pride.<br />
<br />
The day afterwards, Erika and her mom went to buy her new clothes, as she was just too big for any womanly in their home (only things she could put on belonged to her tall, 6’4 father)<br />
Erika loved the fact that she towered over her 5’8 mom by half a foot, and the attentions that she gathered from the crowed, who saw her as a tall, beautiful teen. Little did they know her true age.<br />
<br />
Erika left the mall that day with a huge smile on her face, carrying a bag of new clothes and an E cup bra.<br />
But the clothes weren’t as much as most women would have, as her mom was well aware that she would outgrow them soon enough. And that thought made Erika excited.</p>
