<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A good two weeks later their routine was interrupted. Bill came in to invite them all over for dinner. This was unusual as normally he either selected just one of the pigs to dine with him or he came over to sit with them. When they entered, one of the pig feeding places was specially adorned. It was the one for Knuckle, the fattest of them. Knuckle had lived with Bill for a good year know. He had been a teenage boy from a ghetto neighbourhood, not very intelligent, but sturdily built, before a street gang had captured him and sold him to Bill. he had been castrated to make sure his hormones wouldn't spoil the taste of his meat and had enjoyed life as a pig. Bill announed: &quot;My dear Knuckle, two days from now you will receive the final blessing a pig can receive. I will make you my next butcher pig.&quot; Knuckle brightened up at this prospect and Steph almost envied this prospect. &quot;So as it is a tradition you will have a luxury goodbye meal tonight and fast tomorrow so that you are in perfect condition on Thursday.&quot; Steph wouldn't even have known it was Tuesday, time had lost its meaning to her. <br />
<br />
The meal was great and pleasant as always. When it had ended with a huge Chocolate pudding for each pig, the biggest for Knuckle, whom Steph envied for the amounts he was able to devour, Bill motioned the pigs back to their room. Later that night they fanasized even more about what Bill would turn Knuckle into. The next day Knuckle kept a strict diet and the morning after Bill came to collect him while the other pigs followed suit. Surprised, Steph asked Chops what this meant. Chops replied: &quot;Oh, alright, your first goodbye day. Bill always allows us to watch when he butchers one of us. It is very interesting and you always feel sooo envious on the one who was allowed to deliver his meat.&quot; Again, Steph felt a strange, cold sting at hearing this but could not explain to herself what should be wrong about it. When they arrived in Bill's butcher room, it was a stark contrast to the rest of the mansion, all white tiles and cold, silver steel. Bill lead Knuckle into a narrow steel bar box and stroke his head. &quot;Time to say goodbye, Knuckles.&quot; So did Knuckles and Bill carefully placed something on the sides of his head that looked like an electric pair of tongs to Steph. Then he pressed a red button on each handle and spasms went through Knuckle's body. His gaze went empty and Bill expertly lowered his body before lifting him up by a chain he had put around his hind legs. When Knuckle's body swung before him, he cut open his throat and collected the blood in a Plastic basket. &quot;This will be blood sausage later-on!&quot;, Ham whispered excitedly. Stepgh nodded and followed the procedure intently, while Knuckle's body shook a few times before hanging limp. When the blood flow had been reduced to a dripple, Bill moved Knuckle's body to a scale and weighed him: &quot;180.5 kg! That's fifth place in my eternal ranking!&quot;, he announced. Steph immediately had only one thought: She would beat the record. Bill had explained to hear, that normal pigs were slaughtered at around 100 kg already, but that he liked really fat pigs for Italian style ham and sausage. So she would beat the 200 kg, just to please Bill, she swore to herself. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Bill moved knuckles body through a sort of metal drum, torched his body and used a scraping knife to remove the remaining hair. He then lifted the know pinkish-gleaming, smooth body, this time held by hooks through both hind legs. Steph was now at full attention. First, Bill cut off Knuckle's ears which he announced would be dried and serve as food for Rufus who was also there, watching with great interest. Next came out Knuckle's eyes which ended in a trash bin. &quot;Useless!&quot;, as Bill called them. &quot;Now comes the best bit!&quot;, Chops whispered and all pigs but Steph nodded in agreement. Indeed, Bill now cut carefully around Knuckles rectum, wrapping it in plastic to avaoid any contamination of the meat through his feces and then slid open his body, removing the penis in doing so. The penis was thrown over to Rufus who chewed on it with delight. Knuckle's organs slid out, with Bill putting the package of liver, heart and lungs on a hook, while the white organs ended in a metal bowl. Then Bill split the body with a huge saw, putting the brain halfs into an extra bowl. &quot;He can cool down now, but you can watch me clean his inner bits!&quot;, he announced cheerily, before Knuckle went into a giant freezer. Then they watched Bill rinse the red organs and brain before he cut apart the different white organs. He emptied the bladder and stomach which were insed and stored. Finally came the intestines who would be used for sausage casings as the other pigs explained to Steph. These intestines were carefully pulled onto metal bars so that the remaining feces were pushed out and only a thin layer of tissue remained. When it was all over, the pigs got their lunch and Bill relaxed to prepare for the afternoon. Later that day, Knuckle was cut to pieces, much of his fat was turned to sausage, filled into his own intestines and in the end of the day all that remained of him was some bones, which, Bill explained, would be cooked for gelantine or used as fertilizer. The other pigs were all envious and for days discussed who great it was for Knuckle to have been put to so many good uses. Steph was so excited by what she had seen that she rubbed her pussy against a chair until she came in order to relax at least a bit.</p>
