<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Though &quot;normal&quot; Evan had no idea where this was, construction worker Evan navigated the dark roads with ease. Robbie, having lost 90 lbs throughout the day, could now accurately be called a lightweight and had fallen asleep from the 2 shots and 3 beers he drank with the guys. Evan had slowly worked him over throughout the night turning him from staunchly heterosexual to mostly gay bisexual.<br />
<br />
Evan felt the rage well within the pit of his stomach as he eased into an alleyway and killed the engine. &quot;Fucking lightweight gayboy, making eyes at me all night. Desperation is pouring off of him.&quot; Robbie shifted as he lost 5 more pounds and his orientation finally shifted the rest of the way to homosexual. Evan exited the truck startling Robbie awake as the door slammed. <br />
<br />
As Evan made his way to the passenger side he mumbled to himself &quot;Young queer like this one is lucky I didn&#39;t find a good woman tonight, otherwise I&#39;d leave the kid wallowing in his own desperation. No telling what he&#39;d drag in...&quot; Robbie felt a strange disorientation as he was trying to get his bearings after waking up... the 38 year old man rapidly regressed to a 22 year old and was barely able to catch his breath now that he was finally alone with this god of a man. Evan was knowledgeable, strong, handsome, capable, masculine and ... straight.. of course Robbie would be into him, he is not available.<br />
<br />
Evan made it over to the passenger side and opened the door. He reached in and pulled a surprised Robbie out. with an intense glance Evan explained, &quot;I wanna get off as much as you wanna get me off, don&#39;t hold back or you will never get this chance again.&quot; With that Evan pulled out his penis and stood there expectantly.<br />
<br />
Robbie didn&#39;t miss a beat, he immediately fell to the ground and began giving head. Forever desperate for a strong man who can protect him physically.<br />
<br />
Moments later Robbie had finished and Evan seemed to glow. Robbie started to walk back to the dorms but Evan called to him as he opened the door to his truck, &quot;You did a great job, you should feel proud of yourself.&quot; with that Evan was in his truck backing up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks&quot; Robbie halfheartedly mumbled to himself. He was glad he could make Evan feel good, that was his power. But being told he should feel proud brought up the bitter disappointment his father expressed 8 years ago when he came out. Proud? How can Robbie feel pride when his dad felt so much shame? Robbie hated himself, but he was proud that he could make Evan feel pleasure enough to say something and they both enjoyed their stolen tryst. Robbie was torn as to what he should feel and what he did feel. <br />
<br />
Evan&#39;s truck seemed to be lingering in the alley, perhaps Evan was waiting until Robbie was out of sight? Robbie couldn&#39;t turn back to tell Evan to go. Hot tears began to stumble down Robbie&#39;s face, and he refused to let Evan see him so weak. &quot;Evan was happy, Evan is my father&#39;s age, and I respect Evan more than I respect my father, why isn&#39;t this enough for me? Why aren&#39;t I happy?&quot; As Evan&#39;s truck pulled away Robbie mumbled aloud, &quot;Why aren&#39;t I enough for him?&quot; Robbie collapsed against the wall and began to sob not knowing if he were talking about Evan or his dad.<br />
<br />
As Evans truck was backing out of the alley, Evan was trying to think of what to do next. A sudden urge to grab some smokes or find some weed pushed its way into his head with a sudden sense of urgency. He rapidly pushed the idea out, &quot;I haven&#39;t done either of those things in years, where did that idea even come from?&quot; A second later the thought of drinking more pushed its way in... Evan quickly reasoned that his coworkers are probably already on their way home, his brain&#39;s solution was that he could get a handle and drink it till he was piss-faced and pass out somewhere. &quot;What the fuck kinda thought is that?&quot; Evan stopped the truck as he imagined himself as an alcoholic so clearly he could almost taste the shots, he shuddered in disgust and pushed the thoughts away.<br />
<br />
Evan began heading back to his house when another thought came to him, maybe he could find himself a nice girl to get down with tonight. Evan liked the idea and felt a reminiscent twinge in his pants as he thought of his last girlfriend. Her mouth, her boobs, her ass... she had it going on but was was more selfish than he could handle. She never seemed to respect how hard he worked to pay the bills and would give him attitude; he was tired at 10 pm on a weeknight and wanted to go to bed so he could wake up at 430 the next morning.<br />
<br />
In the back of construction worker Evan&#39;s mind there was this odd yet familiar sense of laughter, after a few seconds of hearing it Evan was suddenly struck with horror, &quot;It happened again! Oh shit who am I?&quot; <br />
<br />
The laughter was no longer a stiffed giggle in the back of his mind, but a roaring cacophony distracting him and making him second guess himself. &quot;I&#39;m not looking for a girl!&quot; Evan yelled at the voice. &quot;No?&quot; the voice asked still laughing, &quot;And why is that?&quot; the demonic voice questioned innocently as it broke into roaring guffahs, <br />
<br />
Evan knew he wasn&#39;t looking for a girlfriend, that thought seemed to be absolutely true but why? &quot;Because I already have one! And she&#39;s great! Wait, what was that with Robbie then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haw-haw-haw You got me there!&quot; the demon kept laughing. <br />
<br />
&quot;I gotta remember.&quot; Evan said to himself, &quot;How did this start?&quot; Looking at himself in the rear view mirror he realized, &quot;Oh shit, I was in school!&quot; Immediately the thought of adult learning classes in the local community college popped into his head, but he immediately dismissed the idea, believing himself to have been much younger. But how young? Someone made him angry enough to attract some sort of rage demon, Middle school? High School? Evan saw the wrinkles diminish as his skin youthened, the fat from his 30&#39;s and 40&#39;s vanishing in a heartbeat. High school sounded right but it felt weird to think that he was too young to hang out at bars, have sex, or that he may not have ever smoked anything. Construction worker Evan remembered many such times...<br />
<br />
The laughter suddenly faded away, and reality seemed to spin and suddenly things seemed to refocus, like the cogs of reality were bolted back into place. Cautiously, Evan examined his memories...</p>
