<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Edited: Forgot to add an ending title to this chapter path.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stopping at a tiki beach bar sticking out of the side of the hotel in the same patio plaza as the pool without even getting their names or exchanging a few words between the three of them Damon quickly exited the scene under the guise that she had to go to the bathroom. Nodding their heads and giggling as they sat down on the booths at the bar They watched as their girlfriend jogged away towards the resort her butt cheeks jiggling with each lunge of her legs. Getting to a secluded corner around the building a very frustrated and flustered Damon whispered forcefully “Genie you get out here right now!” Appearing in the same puff of pink mist as earlier genie in her same beach outfit stood before you this time with a very happy smile dotting her face as her eyes roamed around your body. Seeing what she was doing and embarrassed by it Damon placed her left hand on her groin and her right arm across her breasts and turned her body to the side angrily telling her genie to “stop checking me out!” Snapping out of her observance Genie giggled “sorry Mistress Danielle I was just checking out my handiwork” Damon was a bit taken aback by the name “wait what did you call me? Danielle?” Smiling again Genie  continued “Yes Mistress your name is Danielle Larson now and your two friends are Sarah Matthews the brunette and Sonya Leary the redhead.”<br />
<br />
Still flabbergasted by these names Danielle nonetheless pushed on with her confrontation “Genie why did you turn me into a chick?” The genie just nodded her head and sighed to this question “I tried to warn you mistress before I cast your last wish but you cut me off before I could explain that you probably wouldn’t like the outcome of the wish based on how you worded it and I was gonna give you a chance to reword it more to your liking but you forced me to cast it as directed.” Feeling stupid for her earlier transgression but not wanting to be in this form a second longer Danielle blurted out her last wish<br />
<br />
“Genie I wish that I was back up in my room and back to normal” Genie didn’t even wait this time only sorrowfully muttering “oh mistress why did you do that?” as darkness enveloped her vision.<br />
<br />
Suddenly her senses regained awareness and Danielle found herself laying on her back in her bed. Danielle was horrified that she was still a women but her worst fears were laid out for her. Danielle’s bikini was gone as she was naked on the bed spread eagle with her ankles cuffed to the end of the bed and her wrists handcuffed to the bed-board! Danielle tried to scream but all that came out was muffled whimpers as a piece of duck-tape covered her mouth. Danielle desperately tried to break the cuffs imprisoning her but she got nowhere with her reduced strength and the material which bound her. Right before Danielle was to give up her genie appeared in her usual puff of pink mist and looked down at the now excited and ecstatic Danielle. Thinking she was saved Danielle began whimpering and hollering to her genie to remove the tape and release her but unfortunately for her this would not be happening. <br />
<br />
“I’m sorry mistress but I can’t remove the tape as I am no longer bound to you for you have made your last wish. Again I tried to warn you but you wouldn’t listen and made what I believe was another mistake contrary to what you really wanted.” A wave of fear coursed through Danielle’s veins as she heard this news “How you worded the wish directly affected how reality was reshaped to fit your  intentions. Here you are now back up in your room or Damon’s room and you are a normal heterosexual girl named Danielle Larson who is a model on vacation with her model friends. Damon already had this room but you and him met as you were both on vacation here and really hit it off. After a romantic dinner followed by a steamy make-out session on the beach he brought you back up to the room here and upon your kinky request bound you up like this. Damon should be coming out of the bathroom any second now ready for action with who he believes is the love of his life.” This news was frightening and devastating all at once to Danielle who began thrashing and kicking trying to break the cuffs that held her while pleading through muddled sobs to let her go. Genie felt for her she really did but she was bound by the Genie Laws and she couldn’t break them. Looking to Danielle as she gave up and slumped down in the bed Genie offered her one piece of advice as the bathroom door was heard to open and Genie began to disappear into nothingness. “This is the life that you have been given, don’t waste it, and accept who you are.”<br />
<br />
Coming around the corner Damon looked again at the buxom beauty that he had met on this fairy-tale vacation of his. Laying naked on the bed was the most beautiful women he had ever met and even Monica had nothing on her. As he stripped naked himself Damon knew that the had found the ‘one’ even if it was so early in their relationship. Danielle had stopped crying at seeing Damon and suddenly was filled with the most incredible emotions of love, and desire she had ever felt. When Damon got naked and slid into bed with her Danielle wasted no time in allowing him full access to all of her assets and when he removed the tape covering her mouth she could barely wait any longer for the kissing to begin.<br />
<br />
That was two years ago and the new Danielle never looked back at her old life. Danielle’s friends left the resort two weeks after that night in Damon’s room but Danielle stayed with Damon for another two weeks before both left on the same flight back to the continental United States. One week after arriving home Damon moved in with Danielle, one year later they were married, and a year after that in the present-day they are expecting their first child any day now. With her modeling career in full swing and a family on the way Danielle had accepted her new life and was never going to allow it to be wasted.<br />
