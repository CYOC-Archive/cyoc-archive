<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jack yawned, &quot;Yeah, more volunteers, but how about a nap for now, OK?&quot;<br />
<br />
Being bears you and Ross yawn in sympathy and agree.  A nap right now would be a very welcomed thing, it's late in the year and bears (even Werebears like you) get in the mood to hibernate… even if it is just for a day or two at a time.<br />
<br />
The three of you pile into bed, gently sucking, stroking and nuzzling each other.  Soon, you're all asleep and a couple days pass while the three of you snooze peacefully under the thick covers.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, your Uncle Jake who wouldn't be using the cabin for 'awhile' decides it's deer season and he wants to go hunting.  He's got his license and his cottage in the woods is a perfect base for his hunting expedition.  You uncle used to take you hunting when you were younger and he ALWAYS brought back a buck or, when the license permitted, a doe.<br />
<br />
He was a responsible hunter, always trying to take the older deer and never killing a mother with fauns.  He always used as much of the animal as he possibly could and always 'thanked' the spirit animal for providing him and his family with food in the way of his ancestors.<br />
<br />
Your uncle arrives at the cottage late in the evening, the lights are out of course, but he notices a van with which he is not familiar.  Uncle Jake, of course, had met Jack your roommate and the two of them had hit it off well enough but he doesn't know what Jack drives and so interprets the van outside as being that of an intruder.<br />
<br />
With the lights off, your uncle assumes that there are potentially robbers creeping about in the dark, not that there would be much to steal, except the furniture (some of which are antique) and a few of the hunting rifles locked up in the basement of the cottage that are family heirlooms.<br />
<br />
Max silently unlocks the door in the back that opens to the kitchen, in his hand he has a pistol, the safety is on.  Max is a BIG man in his late forties, ex-marine and very well muscled, though the fact that the man doesn't miss a meal is beginning to show on his middle aged form.  He feels that the pistol he's holding is only for a last resort sort kind of situation.  He's an experienced hunter and warrior who is no stranger to open hand combat and is by no means trigger happy.<br />
<br />
In the dim light he begins to search the cottage silently and methodically.<br />
<br />
Max notices a couple of beer cans on the coffee table in the front room.  Things have been left out but nothing seems to be missing.  Max shifts the likelihood of robbery down on the list but keeps it as a possibility.  He's now leaning more toward 'squatters' as a likely situation.<br />
<br />
He makes his way up the stairs knowing, of course, where all the 'creaks' on them are and avoiding them deftly.<br />
<br />
At the top of the stairs he pauses and listens.  In the guest bedroom he hears snoring and pushes 'squatters' to the top of the list of possibilities as to why someone in a van he doesn't recognize might be here in his cottage.<br />
<br />
Slowly, he makes his way to the bedroom door.  Silently he turns the handle, listening to the unbroken snoring from what he assumes is two to four large men.<br />
<br />
Max knows the door will creak when he opens it, but also knows if he opens it fast, it will creak for less time and if he can time it with a snore, it may go undetected by the sleepers.<br />
<br />
Max listens and times his move.  The door swings open under the cover of one of the loud snorers.<br />
<br />
The scene in the bedroom, bathed by moonlight, is of a pile of men under the covers.  From what Max can tell, there are no more than three, they're all large and from the arms and legs sticking out here and there, hairy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone's been sleepin' in my bed, and there they are, STILL sleepin' in my bed.&quot; He mutters to himself quietly.<br />
<br />
Max walks over to the bed and gently pulls the covers back.  These men are particularly sound sleepers and he doesn't recognize any of them.  From their position he guesses that they're all gay.  Men don't usually sleep in the same bed if they can avoid it if they're hetero and certainly not face to crotch and CERTAINLY not nude.<br />
<br />
Max didn't have a problem with gay men, he knew many in the service and never 'told' nor did he 'ask'.  BUT these gay men were strangers AND they were in his house.  Perhaps their van broke down, perhaps they were cold.  He'd give them a chance to explain.  He nudged the black haired one, not knowing he was nudging his own nephew.<br />
<br />
He figured if these men wanted to put up a fight, they'd be at least disadvantaged in that they'd be coming out of sleep AND they'd be without weapons.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, buddy.&quot;  Max said in a soft voice, &quot;Whatcha doin' in m' house?&quot;<br />
<br />
David stirred a little and Max repeated the question.<br />
<br />
The other two remained asleep.  Damn but they were sound sleepers!<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; David said groggily.<br />
<br />
Max was getting hard, he was unaware of course, being focused on the situation.  The bear pheromones were beginning to have an effect.<br />
<br />
Max repeated a little more loudly, &quot;I said, what are you doing in my house.  Who the Hell are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
David, forgetting all about putting the suit on Jack which changed him and then he himself changing after taking Jack's thick seed and 'recruiting' Ross looked up into his uncle's bearded face and smiled through his own thick, now longer, beard and said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unc'!&quot; David yawned, &quot;What are you doin' here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Max completely puzzled why a stranger would call him Unc' asked, &quot;Who the fuck are you?  Why the Hell are you in my house?&quot;<br />
<br />
David's mind cleared, events of the last three days began to return to his conscious mind as he became more awake.  He still didn't realize that he looked different, full beard, thick muscular body, extreme body hair, none of that was what his mind remembered his self image as being though his deeper bass voice was strange, he must have the beginning of a cold or something, he thought briefly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's me, David… you nephew?&quot;  David said and then he remembered the changes and who was in bed with him, his eyes bulged.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure don't look like my nephew.&quot;  Max pulled up a chair and moved the pistol from behind his back where he'd kept it while woke the sleeping man.  &quot;Now,&quot; he said in his calm resonate baritone, &quot;why don't you explain who you are and why you're in my house?&quot;</p>
