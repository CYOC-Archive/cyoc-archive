<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;That was... weird. I&#39;ve never felt fuller after an ejaculation,&quot; said Pete as he slowly moved his hand down to fondle himself--only to have it slapped away by Ally.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t even think of spilling that seed just yet,&quot; said Ally.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what&#39;s the explanation, then?&quot; asked Pete<br />
<br />
&quot;Jim and I grew younger, if you didn&#39;t notice,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I did... but I just thought... well, that you&#39;d had a bit of hair dye, a bit of a face lift, and had been working out?&quot; suggested Pete.<br />
<br />
&quot;In any case, Jim didn&#39;t stop getting younger. He kept halving his age until... he was in me and even then he kept going.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... don&#39;t tell me that we... we just...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Congratulations, I think we just unconceived Jim--which seems to have stopped the whole getting younger thing. Which means that hopefully if we do it one more time, we can get Jim back.<br />
<br />
&quot;All right... I&#39;ll bit this... crazy idea. Ally, there must be thousands if not millions of sperm in me now--the chances that the one that made Jim connects with his egg half are astronomically--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s the only chance he has now, so are you going to keep yapping, or are we going to get Jim back?&quot; asked Ally, as she positioned herself straddling Pete.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess all we can do is try...&quot; conceded Pete.<br />
<br />
As soon as it became apparent to Nate that his Mom and Pete were going to have another round of sex, Nate decided it might be the best time for a bathroom break. When he returned, he found them once again in post coital bliss, but this time with his Dad listed as conceived--thank god. However this time, there was an option listed on the screen saying &quot;Time Share Transformation&quot;. Nate clicked on it and a pop-up with a bit of a description of the transformation popped up.<br />
<br />
NEW FEATURE<br />
<br />
Time Share Transformation<br />
Want to dramatically shift the power dynamics in a room? Link two individuals and exchange the time from one into the other until a desired stopping point. Time and experience will flow from one into the other until the Transformation is stopped. Even out the power dynamics in a room, or completely flip flop who is in the driver&#39;s seat! With Time Share Transformation, shift the balance of power that time provides. Change your place in the world with Time Share Transformation!<br />
<br />
That might be an interesting thing to try to make Dad older, especially if he linked Uncle Pete and Dad together, that might be fun. So Nate closed the pop-up and noticed that since he had hit the Time Share Transformation, his cursor was highlighted. Curious, Nate clicked on Uncle Pete, which caused his profile to be highlighted, and then Nate selected his recently reconceived Dad&#39;s profile, and suddenly another pop-up appeared asking how he wanted the time share transformation to work, either from James to Peter or Peter to James. Nate selected for Time to be transferred from Peter to James, and suddenly the transformation began with their age counters highlighting. One moment Uncle Pete was 34 and Dad was just a just conceived egg burying itself into Mom&#39;s uterus when suddenly a year came off Uncle Pete and was given to Dad. In a flash, Dad appeared as a three month old infant at Mom&#39;s feet, and Uncle Pete was now 33. Not much had changed for Uncle Pete, while a lot had for Dad.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s reversing!&quot; exclaimed Mom as she saw Dad now fuss at the bottom of the bed.<br />
<br />
Another year saw Dad go from a helpless infant grow into a chubby baby who could now sit up on his own. Again, at 32, the changes to Uncle Pete were rather indistinguishable, perhaps a few less gray hairs, a little less body fat clinging to his stocky body making his muscles more apparent, but nothing much.<br />
<br />
And so the transformation of Dad went as he aged through his toddler years and reacquired speech and grew cuter and bigger as he pressed into early childhood with the slow diminishment of baby fat. By the time Dad was Kindergarten age<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s different this time... he was halving his age before, this time he&#39;s gaining back his age one year at a time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;s my kid brother feeling?&quot; asked Uncle Pete to the now six year old James.<br />
<br />
&quot;Laugh it up all you like, Pete, that was terrifying--and Ally, don&#39;t tell me why you two are naked--I don&#39;t want to know, I&#39;m just glad I&#39;m back to being me and not weirdly split between two places anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
At the mention of naked, Ally noticed Pete covered himself with the sheet, drawing her attention to her brother-in-law only to be surprised at how... young he looked compared to a few minutes ago. He almost looked her current age of 25.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh boys... I think we have a different problem now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; asked Pete<br />
<br />
&quot;Jim&#39;s getting older, but at the same time I think you&#39;re getting younger, Pete,&quot; said Ally<br />
<br />
&quot;I think she&#39;s right,&quot; said the now ten year old Jim who now sat on the edge of the bed with his growing legs dangling over the side.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; exclaimed Pete as he got up out of bed and hurried over to the mirror hung above the dresser.<br />
<br />
&quot;I--I look like I did in college!&quot; exclaimed Pete as Jim crossed the line from child into pre-pubescent. Pete was now noticeably fitter, his facial hair a bit thinner, and his hair lacking any hint of white hairs whatsoever.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully it stops before yOU get tOO young,&quot; said Jim as his voice began to crack and the tips of his feet touched the floor from his seat on the bed. His body was beginning to stretch out, grow lanky and look more like a young teenage bean pole.<br />
<br />
Uncle Pete&#39;s muscles were now beginning to fade and shrink as years of working out in college were undoing themselves, his facial hair retreated to a few scraggly hairs, and the exhaustion about the eyes lifted as he soon began looking more like a freshman than a senior.<br />
<br />
The exchange of puberty allowed for Dad to shoot up quick, while Pete seemed destined to meet him in High School. Soon, two nearly identical athletic teenage boys the age of 17 were staring at one another, hoping that the transfer might stop there, but Nate allowed it to continue. Soon Jim had regained his status as the older and bigger brother has he became a legal adult, and Pete shrank to having a driver&#39;s permit. The amazing exchange of puberty between them before continued, only with more maturity accumulating in Jim, returning him to a young adult he&#39;d been before Nate had started experimenting on Dad alone with the halving of his age, while Pete lost all his maturity and retreated through the stages of lanky to bean pole to awkward boy, to pure boy. Uncle Pete began to cry as he descended through Elementary School, while Jim, tried to comfort his youthening brother with a hug--but Pete was both not in the mood for it, and desiring it as he retreated to Kindergarten age and Nate felt that with Pete at 5, and Dad at a respectable 28, it was time to stop the transformation.<br />
<br />
Nate pressed the &quot;Stop&quot; button and a blinding flash eminated from his computer screen, catching Nate offguard. When the light dissipated, he saw his brother Jim in his pajamas comforting his nephew Petey who&#39;d clearly woken up from a nightmare during his nap. Nate felt something was off about the scene--that there was something wrong, but all Nate could think was that Jim was his much older brother, Nate having been an &quot;oops baby&quot; before his parents had died. Jim and Ally had taken him in and were raising him as best they could. Petey had come along five years ago, before Nate had moved in, and Petey really looked up to his &quot;Uncle Nate&quot;. Something at the back of Nate&#39;s mind was nagging him that this wasn&#39;t right, but at the same time there was this overwhelming sense that everything was correct and to just let that nagging feeling go. And so he did.</p>
