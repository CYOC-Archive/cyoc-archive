<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So you got everything,&quot; asked Jack as he shouldered his pack.<br />
&quot;Yep. I&#39;m finally packed up,&quot; responded Lelu. <br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; answered Sara.<br />
&quot;What about you two,&quot; Jack asked as he looked at Vect and Beverly.<br />
Beverly was fastening the last saddle bag onto her back while Vect was trying to close the flap on his rucksack. With a final snap their packs were closed.<br />
&quot;Damn, its about time,&quot; fumed Beverly as she got to her feet....hooves.<br />
&quot;You said it. How do we leave with more than we came with,&quot; asked Vect.<br />
&quot;Well you have an excuse with that getup Edran is making you wear,&quot; joked Jack.<br />
&quot;What do you mean &#39;getup&#39;,&quot; asked Vect putting his hands on his hips as he adopted his best snobby and arrogant voice.  &quot;These garments are the finest clothes in my homeland and are supposed to look overblown and washed out.&quot; He began to grin and laugh uncontrollably. Edran had protested vehemently about Vect coming to the capital in the furs and leathers of the camp. &quot;The second son of the Whitewood family should never be seen dressed is such clothing,&quot; he had said. And Duinir had reluctantly agreed with him. Vect was given the traditional clothing of his homeland, in his family&#39;s house colors. A sky blue shitagi under a white koside and white hakama for lower clothing and a gold colored cloth sash around the waist.  Edran had also insisted on a gold colored coat called a haori,  but Vect saw it as overkill. The shoes he wore were actually close fitting leather shoes, more practical than the ones Edran presented. Vect&#39;s sword had seemed to have settled on a shape after shifting for a while to one that was 2 feet wide and 4 and a half foot long not including the handle one blade, the other side being flat and curved slightly along the length ending in a point.A section was cut out on the flat side in a half circle for him to rest it on his shoulder. It was clearly meant for slashing but the point could still be used for stabbing if need be. <br />
&quot;Besides you&#39;ve got a lot of room to talk with that.&quot;<br />
&quot;Hmpf. This is what I&#39;m gonna wear in the tournament, and it&#39;s very functional,&quot; said Jack as he crossed his arms, the armour plates on his left arm clanking with the movement. His left hand, arm, and shoulder were covered by a thick platemail armour. A large armour belt covered his abdomen like the one he had during the attack. His kopesh hung on his left side, and a buckler on his back. His dire bear spike hung from a string attached to his hair behind the left ear and would swing when he turned his head. Green trousers and leather boots finished the ensemble.<br />
Lelu wore tight fitting brown tunic that exposed her midriff and brown leather trousers with her blue mages robe, adjusted to fit her taller size, hung open on her. Her prized bracers were gleaming in the sunlight that shone through the window.<br />
Beverly wore a leather vest over a loose green tunic. Her horse half was covered with a saddle pack. &quot;I&#39;m picking up my gear in the Capitol once we arrive,&quot; she explained. &quot;It was too much trouble to bring up here anyways.&quot;<br />
Sara had just finished lacing up her vest as best she could, still leaving ample cleavage to show. She had been spending spare time tailoring her thieves school outfit to better fit her new stature. The vest was the remains of the leather top she had brought, extra material taken from the pants and hood to increase the size for her. The harem pants she had purchased from the merchant had been tailored to allow her tail to swing freely. Her wings were fitting nicely through the holes in the back of the vest. However, she didn&#39;t like having her boobs crammed into the top. If she loosed it up the would have a very big window for everyone to ogle at, and she was already feeling pent up after cutting off Vect from sex. &#39;Maybe I should have thought it through a little better. I&#39;m really wanting him right now,&#39; she mused. <br />
&quot;Hey! You 4 ready,&quot; asked a gruff voice outside.<br />
&quot;Yeah one minute,&quot; replied Beverly. <br />
&quot;You all packed?  We probably won&#39;t be back here in a while,&quot; said Jack.<br />
Vect laughed.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s so funny,&quot; asked Jack.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m still thinking about Salazar&#39;s reaction to the news about the traditional challenges here being called off.&quot; He grinned widely. &quot;I thought he was going to explode.&quot;<br />
The dragon druid had sputtered and fumed when Gorg passed the news they were joining the graduation tournament. He had lost his surefire chance to fight Vect. Now he would have to get lucky to possibly fight him. To be honest, Vect was a little disappointed himself. He wanted to fight him, to test himself.<br />
&quot;Well, let&#39;s go.&quot;<br />
<br />
They filed out and joined the crowd in the camp center, Gorg towered over almost everyone with Gratz standing on a box to elevate himself to see the crowd better. As the last reached the center, Gratz nodded.<br />
&quot;Everyone is packed and ready to go? Good. Now touch the person in front of you.&quot; People placed hands on other&#39;s shoulders or backs. &quot;Now those closest hold onto me or Gorg,&quot; The chief placed one large hand on Gratz&#39;s head, much to the shaman&#39;s disapproval. &quot;and everyone brace in 3. 2. 1. NOW!&quot; A green light started to envelop the Hobbit and Orc and spread out until it encompassed everyone. Then it blinded everyone.<br />
<br />
When the light faded, they were in the center of a large plaza, people watching them teleport in place. <br />
Gratz raised his hands high. &quot;WELCOME TO THE CAPITAL EVERYONE!&quot;</p>
