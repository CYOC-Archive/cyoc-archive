<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Earlier across town…<br />
<br />
	A girl was jogging along, minding her own business when she ran into some seemingly random guy, splashing them both with whatever liquid in his hands he had. Briefly she looked back, the guys seemed a little ticked off so she quickly took off down the street, hoping to go unnoticed. “Sorry guy…not dealing with any dicks today.” She rubbed the liquid into her skin, it smelt great. “Wonder why he had it.” She looked down at her arm, she hit his elbow right after bumping into him. “That’ll bruise…” <br />
<br />
The woman’s name was Brittany Clayton, she was a fairly well educated person, but was never taken very seriously because of her beauty, and as such had difficulties getting into what she always wanted to be, a high end lawyer. She was certainly smart enough but no one was giving her the opportunity, not to mention the constant harassment, both sexually and mentally from her bosses. She didn’t want to say anything because she just couldn’t afford it really. She sighed, running up to her apartment building, she had just finished the last leg of her run and was ready for a nice shower. <br />
<br />
Walking up the steps to her apartment, she felt like her feet were on fire, straining the shoes to their maximum. “Damn, I need a new pair already?” She coughed, her voice seemed a little deeper than just a second ago, she shrugged. “Hope I’m not getting sick.” Taking out her keys, Brittany walked into the apartment, again sighing. It felt so empty, her boyfriend just broke up with her two weeks for some tramp and she had yet to get over it. She pulled at her shoes, throwing them to the ground, not noticing her ankle socks were stretching out. Pulling off her clothes as she walked toward the shower, she threw them into the single bedroom’s open door. <br />
<br />
“Maybe I shouldn’t jog so much…the girls are looking a little small…” Brittany spoke as she pushed them together, she wasn’t all that big for starters, a small B-cup, now they just looked much smaller like cherries. “Fuck it…” She balled her hand into a fist in frustration. She turned the faucet to the tub on, waiting for the water to warm up before turning the showerhead on. Hopping into the tub, she heard a thud, much harder than usual. “Okay…I guess that’s a no to the not jogging.” She ran her head through the relaxing hot water, running her hands through her hair, quirking her head slightly. Brittany thought her hair should’ve been much longer, but pushed it off as being her tired state.<br />
<br />
It seemed like the water kept hitting her lower and lower on her back as she unwittingly grew in height. Brittany’s hands running over her body, she felt her stomach, smiling, it was fit, that was for sure. “All those sit-ups really helped out…” She coughed clearing her throat. Her abs had become so muscular, she looked down to get a better view, her jaw dropped. “They’re gone?!” Her hands touched the now muscular chest, she had in place of her breasts, masculine pecs. Her nipples seemed to have shrank, she quick reached a hand for the faucet, turning the water off. <br />
<br />
Jumping quickly out of the shower and into the better lighting of the bathroom. She studied her new form, it was obvious that her chest was not the only thing. Without the distracting sensation of the water, she could feel hair growing on her arms and legs. Even a small bit on her chest. Her strategically placed piercing(s) had fallen to the ground sometime during the change. “What the fuck?!” Her voice was deep and strong now, she grabbed her throat just hearing it. <br />
<br />
Standing in front of the mirror to get a better look at what she’d become. Staring back at her was the man from earlier…only a little more attractive. Brittany was stunned, looking down, she could see the man’s pubic patch between his strong, thicker legs. As she checked, she realized that she was still a girl where it counted. She sighed slightly, but soon she felt a slight tugging coming from her groin. “Fuck!” She saw her clit slowly growing in size, which was and odd feeling, but a far more painful sensation came when her new scrotum expanded from her former pussy lips. The feeling of her new testicles squeezing their way out was extremely discomforting, but a relief once over.<br />
<br />
On her knees from the pain, she quipped. “Now I know what a kick in the balls feels like…holy shit…” Brittany’s gaze centered on her expanding equipment, she cupped the balls with one hand and her member with the other. The transformation completing with her gluteus becoming muscular and fit, along with her hair reaching a nice trimmed appearance. Her circumcised cock which was over 7” and it was flaccid had slowly begun to grow stiff from her attentions.  It had grown to around 10” making her smirk a little prideful. “Well if I had to pick one to be my own…this would certainly be perfect.” She stopped her playing in light of strange it all was. Her revelation came quickly. “Whatever spilled on us both…it has to be.”<br />
<br />
Once more she stood up, but this time noticing how much smaller things now were. Brittany walked closer to the mirror, seeing the Adonis mimicking her perfectly. She flexed, feeling stronger than ever. “So this is what it’s like to be a guy.” She looked closer to the mirror. “He’s cute at least…don’t think I remember him being this hot though.” Still, she thought of going back to where they ran into each other, surely something similar happened to the guy. Grabbing a towel, she quickly dried her body, somewhat exploring her new form as she did. As she wrapped the towel around herself, she readjusted it quickly, realizing the fact that she had no breasts meant she could do it around the waist now. “Now I really can walk around without my shirt on and no peeping Tom’s to worry about.”<br />
<br />
	“Good thing that fucking twat Brian left a lot of his shit.” Brittany said as she walked into her bedroom. She went straight to the dresser, opening the bottom drawer, it was filled with guys clothing. Letting the towel fall to the floor, she picked a pair of boxers, glancing down at her bobbing cock. She was transfixed, not really turned on, but just admiring it’s rather girthful appearance. “A shamed to cover up something so sexy…” Strangely a wondering thought of the way her old body would’ve been hot for a guy like this, she felt nothing but a sense of pride. She pulled on the boxers, followed by a very tight pair of jeans and a small t-shirt. “Damn, Brian was a tiny man…figures…” She sorted through and found the biggest t-shirt and jean combo she could. <br />
<br />
	Brittany ecstatically found that getting dressed as a man was much easier than as a girl. She put some gel of Brian’s in her hands, running it through her shortened do and done, no make up, nothing. Brittany grabbed for her purse, thinking it over, she decided to grab out her wallet, cell and keys, leaving everything else there. She prayed that the guy from earlier would be there. She slipped on a pair of Brian’s old sneakers, if nothing else, he had big feet, and they fit perfectly. She ran down the steps of her apartment and down the block to where she ran into the man.<br />
<br />
	As she approached the approximate place she had been earlier, she spotted a young woman, Brittany saw her banging on the door to the little shop. She also saw an officer approaching her and engaging her in conversation. Brittany tried to act inconspicuous as she got closer to them as they talked. “Wendy Williams” He heard the young girl saying, that’s when she saw the girl’s face…it was her own body, except…it looked phenomenal, like a suped up version of herself. She stopped at the bus stop, waiting for the cop to go away, she was certain it was the guy from earlier, but she didn’t know how to approach him or if she even wanted to.<br />
<br />
	After a few moments, she’d heard her body saying that she needed to get into the shop and the cop simply told her to come back next time, Brittany thought it a little strange that Will was so obsessed with the store. Her body walked over to where she was standing, only inches away, apparently too distracted by his own dilemma. The bus slowly approached the stop, the door squeaking open. They both entered, Brittany was just trying to figure out what exactly had happened, but she wasn’t going to make matters worse by suddenly appearing, even though none of this was really her fault. At the last stop, Will got up from where he was sitting, having left his keys sitting on the seat. Brittany saw this, she quickly grabbed them as she walked off the bus a few moments after Will.<br />
<br />
	Brittany walked a few paces behind Will so as not to draw attention, but it seemed like she could’ve been right in his face and he wouldn’t know it. She watched as he went up to the apartment building, seeing him realize that he’d lost his keys. She hid around the corner, hearing him throw a tantrum, kicking his shoes off into the dark. “Must be close to ‘that time’…” The thought made her think of how great men had it and how glad she was that she wasn’t the one that had to deal with it…but then, she did want her body back. Next, she watched Will walking down the street toward a payphone and another ten minutes an extremely nice car pulled up to the side. <br />
<br />
	It only took a moment for her body to get into the car. As Brittany got closer, trying to see into it. She saw them talking for a bit, and a bottle was gestured. “That’s the shit…” She wanted to just go up there and grab it, but they soon pulled off down the street. “Shit, well, that kind of sucks that he’s gone now. But, I can see who he is…” She held the keys in her hand, checking them all for numbers. Finding the right ones she soon found her way up to the guy’s apartment number. Brittany entered, locking the door behind her, she knew that he wouldn’t be back till tomorrow based on the phone call she over heard. “Plenty of time to figure this out.”<br />
<br />
	Scavenging throughout the apartment, she came upon some cloths that actually fit her new body. “Well, it is his body…Will Bower…” She said, checking the I.D. she found in Will’s room. After a while of checking things out, he determined that Will was just the average guy. He did have studies in law and was almost finished, which was impressive to her and also very enticing. “I could be a better lawyer than even this guy…just pass the bar, show ‘em what I’ve got and bam, easy money.” She thought out loud, but felt too much guilt, thinking about doing that to someone. <br />
<br />
	Thoughts of life as a guy began to flood her day dreaming, no more guys pinching her ass at work, no more dicks…well, besides her own. Brittany’s dreams could’ve been realized simply by taking over Will’s life…her thoughts interrupted by the sound of a cell phone going off. She looked around for a few minutes until finding it on the counter. “Hello?” She answered quizzically, not really sure she should in the first place, but if it was this Will guy, she could swap back before she gave it a second thought. She looked at the phone, reading the name. “Oh…Megan?”<br />
<br />
	“Yeah, it’s me, is everything okay? I’ve been trying to get a hold of you for hours. I’m downstairs, open up, you scared the daylights out of me.” Brittany sighed, hanging up the phone. “She had to be downstairs…” Pushing the button, she buzzed the front door and opened the apartment one for her as she walked up. “Wow…” Brittany muttered as an incredibly cute little brunette walked up to her, Brittany felt a passion course through her suddenly, pulling her and the petite girl closer together. Easily lifting her off the ground, Brittany kissed her with a grand passion like she’d never known, Megan was happily surprised by Will’s sudden action, Megan’s arms wrapped around his neck. Brittany’s large manly hands found their way up Megan’s black mini-skirt, she was wearing a garter slip underneath, and Brittany felt the straps holding up the black satin stockings.<br />
<br />
	Brittany focussed long enough to gain control and set the girl down once again onto her heeled feet. She closed the door, never taking her eyes off Megan. “Sorry, you just…look amazing…” Megan smiled, blushing. “Aw, why so sappy all of a sudden? I might get to like this, so don’t go changing back.” Megan joked. Brittany laughed slightly, lost in the thought that she was hard as rock below by just kissing the girl, how did guys handle that all the time, she wondered. The two walked into the living room, where Megan turned to whom she thought was Will seductively. Megan had already intended to make the night a memorable one, now with an opening kiss like that, she knew it was going to be a good night. “Does Will seem more attractive than usual?” Megan pondered to herself.<br />
<br />
Standing with her hand on her hip, Megan smirked, “well, I guess since you made the first move, it’s my turn for a little treat.” She unzipped the side of the miniskirt and pulled it completely off. Megan unbuttoned her blouse, leaving her in only her garter, and stockings, and the sheer black satin slip that hid nothing, and a pair of black thong panties. Losing her heels decreased her height by a couple of inches, Brittany looked down at the smaller form, she was getting more and more turned on by Megan’s beauty. “Wow, I can’t believe how gorgeous she is, a little experience from the opposite side does sound interesting.” Brittany thought, hypnotized by her.<br />
<br />
Briefly Brittany looked away, the moment she looked back, Megan was right up on him, her hands reaching under Will’s shirt. She felt the rippling muscles with her soft finger tips, she pulled his shirt up over his head. “Wow, someone’s been working out, you look hot baby!” She threw the shirt, reaching on her tip-toes to kiss him, one hand on his face, the other snaking it’s way into his jeans. Megan giggled, feeling him already stiff for her, but it seemed a little different, but continued despite it. She stroked him a few times as she kissed him, it seemed to grow even harder now. Her hands reaching down to his pants, she quickly and expertly undid them, pulling them down with his boxers. Curiously, she stared at it, as if she never had seen it before. <br />
<br />
Brittany noticed her staring, and realized it must’ve increased by quite a bit for her to notice. “Babe, I’ve never seen you so hard…it’s so big…” Megan’s hands reached out for the excited member, she began to work her magic, stroking his stiff cock in her hands, blissfully unaware that this was not her boyfriend. “I’ve just never been so attracted to you as I am right now.” Brittany spat out with a quick thought. Megan smirked, she pulled Brittany over to the couch, gently leading Brittany with her penis. The pleasure was increasing with each little touch of Megan’s hands, they were so small in comparison to the large penis they held. Megan got onto her knees as Brittany sat on the couch. <br />
<br />
Megan slowly bent over and licked the head of the enlarged dick, looking up to Will as he shuddered from the electrifying feeling. She worked it with her hands and intense licking and sucking. She could hear Will moan, inwardly smiling that it was having the intended effect.  ‘Will’s’ groans got louder, Megan took it as a good sign, she started moving forward, getting as much into her mouth as she could. Brittany’s hands gently grabbed the back of her head for more, being careful not to suffocate the wonderful girl. Brittany had had some experience with giving blowjobs but this was a new level all together, she was surprised that she had any level of control (not knowing the liquid enhanced the body’s natural sexual abilities among other things). <br />
<br />
Gagging as ‘Will’s’ cock increased in size as Megan was sucking on it, she was about to release him but he protested. “Please…keep going…it feels phenomenal!” Said an obviously still excited ‘Will’. Megan was shocked at how much larger his dick seemed to be than anytime before this, it enticed her more than she thought it would. Megan took her time, exploring every inch of his enhanced penis with her tongue and fingers. Soon each little jolt from Megan’s touch was becoming too much for Brittany’s mind to handle. &quot;Fuck... I'm going to cum!&quot; announced Brittany, &quot;Oh God, yes... ohhh... that's it, don't stop... ohhh...&quot; Brittany was attempting to warn Megan of her impending eruption, but she just kept going… &quot;Oh God...&quot; Brittany felt the pressure build and finally she came, her mind filling with the exquisite pleasure of that moment. She felt herself empty into Megan’s waiting mouth, swallowing every bit of it, Megan didn’t seem to understand why she had now and never before.<br />
<br />
Sinking into the couch as Megan lapped up each and every drop of cum, Brittany smirked down at the girl. She was in love, she had to be to show such devotion for a guy, she was obviously not the slutty kind of girl. “You’re amazing…Wi…I’m lucky to have you.” Brittany stared into Megan’s gorgeous eyes, she winked at him as she excused herself to brush her teeth quickly. Brittany stood for a moment, shaking off the fog from her first male orgasm, it certainly felt very different from before. “I never thought I’d be so turned on by a girl before…but what a girl…takes my breath away.” Brittany took the small window of time to really study her new form, she smiled at the sight of her now powerful naked body. “Maybe I can stand to be like this…at least for a while…”<br />
<br />
Within a few moments Brittany was able to get her new member stiff from the thought of Megan’s sexy little body. This surprised both Megan and Brittany as she walked out from the bathroom, usually it took Will at least twenty minutes to get hard again. Yet, there it stood, proudly, and as excited as when she had been sucking on it moments ago. Brittany walked over to Megan commandingly grabbing her hips, Brittany pulled her in closer, and kissing Megan’s soft accepting lips. Lifting her off the ground, Brittany’s hands on her soft ass as she took them into the bedroom. <br />
<br />
Brittany threw Megan onto the bed, following her closely behind, Brittany removed what little clothing Megan had on, ravishing Megan’s soft flesh with kisses as Brittany pulled her panties down her soft thighs and legs, leaving her in nothing but the stockings. Brittany’s boyfriend had a thing for that too and for some reason she did find it especially appealing now. “I’ve never really noticed how perfect a woman’s body could be.” Brittany said truthfully.<br />
<br />
It didn't take any more invitation than that, Megan was so enthralled, she’d never heard Will talk like this and it was refreshing.  Megan wrapped her legs around Brittany, pulling her still rock hard penis into Megan’s hands guiding it down to her wetness. Immediately Brittany went to work, the feeling was fantastic, every nerve ending tickled by her gripping walls. Megan was excited and shocked by the new feeling of ‘Will’s’ larger tool, never having felt so full before. Their love making continued for what seem like hours, Brittany’s improved member could easily hit Megan’s g-spot with one strong thrust. Toying with her, Brittany smiled, liking the new power, but also knowing that teasing would make it all the better. Brittany knew she didn't want it to stop, her stamina seemed to grow as she thrust in an out of Megan, her moaning growing louder every few moments.<br />
<br />
 Brittany was thrusting hard, but Megan was thrashing and bucking her hips just as fast to meet him, groaning and yelling louder and louder as the pleasure quickly grew. Soon the climax approached, and Megan started screaming, &quot;Yes! Yes! Oh, God, yes!&quot; as it hit her, Brittany felt herself shudder as Megan’s grip tightened around her shaft. Megan felt a warmth spread through her as ‘Will’ shot his load into her, micro-orgasms rocked her body from the feeling. She giggled, looking down at who she thought was Will as he slowly pulled out of her and collapsed next to her on the bed. Megan was still breathing hard, Will pulled her closer to him, he kissed the gape of her neck. “I think I’m in love with you, darling…” Brittany said with a smile, spooning up next to her.<br />
<br />
Minutes turned into hours and soon they’d made love a dozen times, each time was different but just as enthusiastic as the first. For a little safety they used condoms the remaining times, having forgotten the first time due to the passion. Megan was asleep on top of Brittany’s chest, completely exhausted by their activities. Gently Brittany rolled Megan onto her side, Brittany studied her vulnerably nude body, gripping her soft ass, she didn’t even stir. Simply smiling, Brittany got up, pulling the covers over Megan’s small form, she smiled from the warmth. Impulsively Brittany leaned forward and kissed her on the lips before walking out of the dark room.<br />
<br />
For the first time, Britt had to face the odd task of using the restroom. Tempted to just sit down, she sighed. “Might as well give it a try…” It took her a moment or two to relax before a jet stream of liquid erupted from her penis, she missed the toilet briefly, shaking her head. “Got it now…” After she finished, she figured a quick shower and a look around while Megan slept would be the best course of action. In the shower, she rinsed off the smell of their love making, as she thought about it, she once more became turned on. “What the hell? This body just wants more…gotta be something to do with that stuff that spilled over us…” Britt smiled slightly, impressed that she could keep going if she wanted. “Brian could barely last once…haha, this is funny as hell, I’m more of a man than he is now.” <br />
<br />
Finishing with the shower, Britt stepped out, drying off, giving her body the once over again. Finding a pair of Will’s boxers in the bedroom, she pulled them on and headed back out to the living room. Britt spent hours going through Will’s personal things, it was nearly 2:00 AM by the time she’d finally decided what she was going to do. She’d found quite a bit of money hidden away in Will’s financial accounts and she’d found his PIN numbers for them. Britt smiled slightly, she knew that what was to happen next was going to require it to be enacted quickly. “I’m sorry buddy, but…I can’t pass this up.” She spoke aloud to herself. It wasn’t long before she was dressed and out the door, with keys in hand.<br />
<br />
Speeding off in the Jetta that belonged to Megan, Britt soon reached her real apartment. Britt quickly collected some personal things that she wanted from the apartment, nothing of real value, say for one item. Her grandmother’s engagement ring, it was worth a fortune in itself, but it was a family heirloom. “Sorry grandma.” Britt had no family left, her parents died years ago, no one would notice. Britt did call her old boss, Ronald Delsky, the biggest dick of them all, he was always harassing her, making lewd comments about her body. <br />
<br />
He answered with a just woken-up tone in his voice. “Hello, who the hell is this?” Britt grew angry for everything he’d ever done to her. “Listen Ron! I’m Brittany Clayton’s attorney, I’ve heard all the nasty things you’ve been doing and saying to my client. You should know better than anyone than to go commenting about women as a lawyer yourself. Now, we can come to an agreement here, all she wants is six months severance package, if you accept, we’ll forget this all happened.” <br />
<br />
All that could be heard was dead air for a moment. “Fine…it’s done.” Britt smiled, at least she did one thing for the guy who got her body. “Have her things shipped to her apartment and the check. Have a nice day Mr. Delsky.” She hung up, laughing the moment she was done. “Been waiting for years to do that. Dick is lucky I didn’t just kick his ass.” She quickly put the phone down. She’d done Will that favor. “At least he won’t have to put up with Delsky…” The harassment would’ve been too much for the new ‘girl’ to handle. She pulled the Jetta up to the ATM, Britt moved as quickly as possible putting in the appropriate cards, she cleared out all the money from both Will’s and her accounts. The severance package would be enough for Will to survive on for a while.<br />
<br />
Before she knew it, she was back at Will’s apartment, it had only taken her all of a half hour to finish all of that. Walking up the steps, Britt thought about what she was about to do and hoped that it would go as planned. As she entered the apartment, Britt tried to be as quiet as she could be, she didn’t’ want to wake Megan prematurely. Britt walked into the bedroom where Megan was still asleep soundly. Britt lit a candle or two, on the end table nearest Megan, giving them just enough light. Britt leaned toward the sleeping beauty kissing her fully on the lips. Causing her to stir awake, Megan returned the kiss. As she woke, Britt stopped, smiling slightly down at her angelic face. “Hey baby…” Was all she could mutter out in her tired confusion.<br />
<br />
“I’ve been thinking about this a long time and I’ve finally made a really big decision that I hope you’ll take part in with me.” Britt got to one knee, holding out her grandmother’s engagement ring. “Will you be my wife?” Seeing Megan’s eyes go wide in sudden clarity seeing the huge diamond in front of her. Her eyes darted to Britt, her eyes began to tear up. “Of course I will!” After another quick round about in the sack once more, Megan laid back, looking at the ring on her finger. Britt went on to explain that they needed to move within the next few hours so that ‘Will’ could finish his lawschool up in Boston. That he had $15,000 to put on a place and the moving expense to get them out that day. “We have to be on the road in less than twelve hours.”<br />
<br />
Megan only seemed to consider things for a moment before she started nodding her head. “Okay…” She said, thinking of all she had to do. “Sounds good baby, I’ll do anything so long as I’m with you.” She hugged ‘Will’. “Jane and Clarissa will be able to help pack my things, can you manage here?” Megan asked as she got out of bed and started to dress, she dressed quickly as Will said he could handle the truck and everything, that he’d be by around 10:00AM for her things and to be ready. “I love you so much.” Britt said with a confident smile. “I love you too.” They kissed before she took off, Britt smiled, it was easy, though it isn’t hard to convince someone when they’re in love...</p>
