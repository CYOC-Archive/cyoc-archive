<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Back at the Federal Building, the rest of the doctor's envelopes that were stuffed with the PBT virus were being sorted by the mail sorters and being sent through the mail sorting machine.  <br />
<br />
One mail sorter in particular, Mike Stanley, was a guy who was not to bright and a had no moral values but yet continued to hold down his job as a mail handler. Anyway, this particular day would not be a good day for him as finally he would get his just deserts coming to him.  Mike Stanley typified your classic jock, he enjoyed playing baseball and hockey in his spart time. He was extremely handsone and very well built. He was 25 years old, 6'5 225 lbs of pure muscle. His jeans were a size 34 and his had size 14 new balance trail sneakers on.  Everything about this guy was huge.  But like I said this day would not be his finest.  He was sitting down on his stool next to the conveyer belt sorting the mail to be delivered when he notced one of the doctors envelopes.  He picked up the letter and decided to open it because he had heard of this doctor before and about the research he was doing and wanted to know more.  So he carefully unsealed the letter so he could reseal it again once he was done snooping around. Unfortunately for him, his supervisor, Tom Spangler,was watching him from a distance and saw what he was doing.  Tom Spangler dressed in his armani power suit stood at only 5'9 and was 32 years old but was in great physical condition.  He weighed about 175lbs, 31 waist size, and had on a size 10.5 wing tip loafers.  Tom walked right behind Mike as he was just about to open the letter and yelled &quot;Mr. Stanley what are you doing?&quot;  Mike was so startled by this because he knew he was caught by his supervisor and as he jumped the contents in the letter, a white powder, came spilling out all over Mike and Tom.  As the white powder became airborne they each inhaled quite a bit of the material and started to sneeze.  &quot;I am sorry Mr. Spangler about opening the letter but it seemed pretty suspicious but I guess all it is just regular talcom powder&quot;, Mike said to his boss trying his best not to lose his job.  Angrily Tom replied, &quot;Mr. Stanley please close up that letter and place it back on the conveyer belt and try not to let this happen again.&quot; and stormed off back to his nice big office across the room.  <br />
<br />
Mike just sat there on his stool and continued to sort the mail feeling sorry for himself that he was now on thin ice here at his new job.  He knew that white powder in the envelope was not talcom powder and that a majority of the stuff spilled all over him but he couldn't tell that to his boss.  Not even a half hour later Mike began to feel light headed, dizzy, and sweaty.  Mike thought to himself shit what was in that letter that he opened and now he was regretting for being nosy.  Mike noticed that his normally tight shirt and jeans seemed to become a lil looser fitting and he thought this was a lil strange but just ignored it and his face seemed to be smooth now which was odd cause he did not shave in a couple of days.  A minute or two later the PBT virus was really working its magic on Mike as he regressed from 25 to around 17 and shrank from 6'5 to 6'0. He shirt sleeves were hanging past his hands now, his jeans where all bunched up around his sneakers and his heel was now slipping out of his now larger sized sneakers.  All of Mike's body hair seemed to disappear during this process which seemed extremely strange to him as he wonder what the hell was happening to him. The process really started to accelerate now that the he had a high concentration of virus in his blood stream. He yelled out in a shrill cracking voice to his coworkers, &quot;Someone pweease help me&quot;, as he continued to regress and shrink into his clothes.  All his coworkers stopped what they were doing and came over to see what was wrong with Mike, what they saw they did not believe.  There was Mike in his now ridiculously huge clothing and was rapidly regressing to around 4'0 and age 11.  &quot;What's happening to me&quot;, Mike said and began to cry, all of his adulthood and masculinity was being erased away as he regressed.  As Mike continued to regress, he shoes finally became way to big and heavy for his now shrinking feet and fell right off his small feet and hit the floor with a thud.  Mike looked like he was collapsing and shrinking right into his now oversized clothing as he was approaching age 8.  His now large socks were becoming quite loose around his now skinny and small feet/legs and fell off right onto his sneakers on the floor when Mike shifted in his chair in order not to fall off.  Poor Mike continued to shrink in age gaining more baby fat as he went from 7...6...5...4....&quot;Me no wannah be babaaaayyyyy&quot;, Mike said as he continued to grow younger and younger.  Mike's feet became way to small to hold up his now heavy pant legs and finally gravity tooks its course and they fell down to where they were almost touching the ground but were empty cause his small legs were somewhere trapped in the thighs of his now massive jeans.  Mike continued to regress in age from 4...3...2...and finally becoming just a year old baby crying in a his oversized shirt and jeans.....All the coworkers huddled around the infant that was once age 25 Mike Stanley and were shocked and wondered about what had caused this fate for him....what they failed to realize was that they were too now infected with the PBT virus and would soon begin to regress in age and share his similar fate.....<br />
<br />

Meanwhile in Tom Spangler's office.........</p>
