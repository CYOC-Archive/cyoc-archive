<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I had set the alarm for 6.30am and was in a way relieved to see a bit of bleeding when I went to the toilet. My sunburn also didn’t seem to be as bad as it had felt last night. I showered and washed my hair. <br />
<br />
I took out another of the outfits Sarah had recommended would be suitable for work. This time a black pencil skirt and a light pink, sleeveless, button-less top. I put them on, and looked in the mirror. The white bra I was wearing was standing out under the partially see through top. I changed to a skin toned bra. That looked better. Time for breakfast.<br />
<br />
I waddled down to the kitchen. The pencil skirt restricted the length of stride I could take. I had to walk with short steps. Mum was in the kitchen. “Good morning Jenna” <br />
<br />
“Hi Mum, I must have been asleep before you came home. Was everything still fine when you left?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, she is bearing up bravely. I’m planning to spend the morning with her. She has to go into the hospital. It will be hard” I had to bend at the knees in order to get out a bowl and my muesli. Mum saw the difficulty I was having. “Those pencil skirts look nice but can be difficult to wear. Are you planning to wear heels?<br />
”<br />
“Yes” Sarah had suggested some black heels to wear with the outfit. “Do you think I should wear pantyhose?”<br />
<br />
“Your legs are nice, no need in my opinion……. If you like I can help conceal that sunburn”<br />
<br />
“Thanks Mum”<br />
<br />
After breakfast she came to the bathroom and worked on my face. When she had finished I no longer looked like Rudolph. <br />
“What would you recommend for my hair?” <br />
<br />
That prompted her to tie my hair back in a ponytail. When finished she said “Just some lipstick and earrings and you will be ready. I will leave you to it – stay out of the sun for the next couple of days”<br />
<br />
Thanks again”<br />
<br />
I returned to my room and applied lipstick and some put on some pearl earrings. I thought I looked good. I then put on the suggested shoes. Black with a 3 inch heel. They made walking even more difficult. I had time so made my way to the kitchen and made myself a cut lunch.<br />
<br />
Driving the car was a bit more difficult in high heels and a pencil skirt than I had imagined. I ended up taking off the shoes and driving in bare feet.<br />
<br />
On the way to work I stopped at the drycleaners and picked up Sarah’s suit and blouse. I was relieved to see the Mastercard still worked. I hoped it would hold out until I got my new banking details. <br />
<br />
At work I was introduced to Linda, my fellow receptionist who had been on holiday last week. She was a short brunette of about 21. With 3 of us on reception, work was a lot less hectic. At lunch Linda told of her trip to Cambodia. It sounded as though she had a grand time. She had gone with some girlfriends. They had all gone to my old high school. We reminisced about some of the teachers at the school.<br />
I was busier in the afternoon as Maria had gone home after lunch feeling unwell. Linda had to mind some three year old twins whose mother was been seen by Amy. She ended up doing jigsaws with them in the corner of the waiting room. Leaving me alone behind the desk. I heaved a sigh of relief when it was finally after 5 and Linda suggested I go, she would wait for the last patients to leave.<br />
<br />
I found myself heading toward home before remembering the doctor’s appointment. It was about a 10 minute drive in the opposite direction from work. I was almost exactly 5.30 when I reported to the receptionist that I was Jenna McKenzie and that I had an appointment with Dr Richards. She told me to take a seat. Dr Richards was running slightly late. I would have a 15 minute wait.<br />
<br />
I found myself looking through the latest edition of Vogue. However instead of perving at the models in the ads. I was perusing the fashion pages. Looking at the clothing rather than the models. <br />
<br />
I was engrossed in the magazine when a woman asked “Jenna, would you like to come in”<br />
<br />
I followed Dr Richards into her room and sat in the chair she indicated. She shut the door and sat down at her desk. “So Jenna, how is everything? Are you just here for a regular check-up?”<br />
<br />
“Yes” I replied. Not knowing whether Jenna had any health issues. <br />
<br />
“No issues or strange symptoms?”<br />
<br />
“No, other than getting a bit sunburnt yesterday”<br />
<br />
“Well looking at your records, 3 months ago everything was fine, all the blood tests came back clear. How are the new contraceptives going?”<br />
<br />
“Fine I think. My period started today” <br />
<br />
“That’s always a relief isn’t it” Not if you’re a man I thought. “Have you noticed any lessening of your libido?” How to answer this? I hesitated. She continued “Yasmin can take the edge off your desire. Hmm you haven’t noticed anything. Maybe we will need to go to something stronger”<br />
<br />
“I’m happy to keep trying the Yasmin” Was Jenna being treated for nymphomania?<br />
<br />
“Ok, no drugs? Unprotected sex?”<br />
<br />
“Umm No drugs, but yes I have had unprotected sex”<br />
<br />
“You need to be careful Jenna. Always insist on a condom”……. “Any violent partners?” Again I hesitated. “I take that as a yes. Would you like me to recommend a counsellor?”<br />
<br />
“No it will be fine. I’m sure it won’t happen again”<br />
<br />
“Ok sit back and I will measure your blood pressure” I sat there while she did a blood pressure test then examined my mouth and eyes. “All looks fine. Disrobe and lie on the table” I got up and took off my shoes, top and skirt. lying down just in my bra and panties.<br />
She observed the remnants of the bruise on my hips. “That must have nasty” she massaged my skin where the bruise had been. “No pain”<br />
<br />
“No”<br />
<br />
“Just bruising”  She examined my neck and underarms. I tensed up “Just checking your lymph nodes. Everything looks fine. Try and relax”<br />
She kneaded my stomach gently “Any pain”<br />
<br />
“No”<br />
<br />
“Can you slip off the panties?”<br />
<br />
“I have my period”<br />
<br />
“That’s what the towel is for”<br />
<br />
I pulled the panties off and stared at the ceiling while I could feel her probing my genitals. She had a bright light illuminating my crotch. I could feel her probing inside. “I will just take some samples” I could feel her scraping inside my vagina. This must be a Pap smear. “All looks good. Roll over”<br />
<br />
I turned around so I was now lying on my stomach. I felt her probing my anus. Eventually “All done, get dressed”<br />
<br />
I inserted a new pad as I hurriedly dressed. I asked if it was ok to put my soiled pad in her bin. She indicated that was fine. Once dressed I sat down on the chair again. “I will contact you if anything comes from the swabs but everything look healthy. Remember to insist on a condom, otherwise you are asking for trouble”……..“I will write you a new script for Yasmin. I think the new formulation includes sugar tablets for the off days. That will make it easier.”<br />
<br />
She worked on her computer for a while then filled in a prescription and printed a form out which she signed. She handed both to me and said “Make another appointment in 3 months”<br />
<br />
She ushered me out of the room and called in the next patient, a woman in 6 inch heels and surely what were enhanced breasts.<br />
<br />
I went to the receptionist and made an appointment for July. I was bulk billed.<br />
<br />
Once back in the car I decided that the script could wait. I needed to get home in order to change for my dance lesson. I looked at the other form Dr Richards had printed out. It was titled ‘Sexual health check. Certificate of attendance’ I guessed that meant Jenna was a sex worker.</p>
