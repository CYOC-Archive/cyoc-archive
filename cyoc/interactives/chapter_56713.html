<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Beta-Julie and Beta-Darla were father surprised when the medical wing's good luck charm <br />
sprang to life  as a full sized lupman woman and began helping around with the sleeping <br />
and half awake leoman and pack mates. When  Beta-Julie managed to dully asked what <br />
was going on, the good luck charm said happily, &quot;Don't worry, this is just a dream you're <br />
having, no need to worry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we CAN'T be sleeping at a time like this! Our pack mates are depending on us!&quot;  Beta-<br />
Darla protested her sister echoing her voice at the same time while  Beta-Fran shuddered <br />
in her sleep. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Okay! Look, you're -sleep-walking- so while you're dreaming this, everything you're <br />
doing you're actually doing, and you're lucid dreaming, so you're in control of your own <br />
actions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...okay... that makes sense... we guess...&quot; The two triplets said together, her heads <br />
swimming, deciding to accept the help for the night, even if she was just a dream.  The <br />
good luck charm in the morning will be quick to tell them that it was best they didn't talk <br />
about their dream and became a proper good luck charm again where she belonged. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, everyone commented on how beautiful looking this morning the giant solid <br />
god sun goddess clock statue, and the giant solid silver moon goddess star-chart statue <br />
with the sunlight hitting them just right with the equally giant bronze lupman statue <br />
between them. All three looked a little extra happy this morning if that was possible for an <br />
set of inanimate art (if tall enough that if they stood up straight their ears would go <br />
through the ceiling) they everyone remembered being commissioned and assembled in the <br />
house when Alpha-Jensen was still a pup. <br />
<br />

<br />
1689 July<br />
<br />
Sitting around a make shift table, injecting their thoughts and ideas about how to basically <br />
save the world Marie Cruz said,  &quot;They think there's an army of us Mal'Akh says? I vote that <br />
we take advantage of that and make them think they're going up against an army. They'll <br />
be on the look out for a horde, not one or two raiders. It won't really help us more than the <br />
element of surprise and getting just a little bit closer, but it'll have to do. And remember <br />
what Running-Bear said, the pendants he fashioned slow down and make it harder for the <br />
familiars and witches being able to change us, it doesn't outright make it impossible.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Everyone nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;Our best bet is to divide their attention. Make them think we're coming from all directions <br />
instead of just one or a few. We don't know if the trees are geassed to be invincible like the <br />
familiars are, but Draco's fire, and I trust Linus can provide with a mix of blasting powder <br />
that can produce the same effect. The locals aren't trained soldiers so we have that on our <br />
side. I'm going to see if I can carve what left of our... supply from the graveyard after I <br />
made the throwing knives into something that can cut through the thorns so we don't have <br />
to play by where they want us to go, or I can at least shape what's left along the cutting <br />
edge of the blade.&quot; 'I also suspect the Running Bear used some of those bones in these <br />
pendants he gave us, but... I do not wish to know.'  <br />
<br />
 &quot;Those cannons need to be reloaded after each use, that is your only advantage and like <br />
any cannon can be well aimed at extremely close range. And then there's the leoman <br />
themselves and the gargoyle to worry about... I'm hoping we can use the cannons <br />
themselves to break through the house, if they haven't been hexed to have security to keep <br />
them from being used by anyone who isn't loyal to the witches... I'd ask Mal'Akh to do test <br />
things but... it's clear she'll never go near that house again as long as the witches live. ... <br />
They won't be counting on us being resistant to their magic, that's one advantage we'll <br />
have, but it once last long once they realize what's up and concentrate their efforts like <br />
hornets defending the hive. We won't have time for delays or set backs or retreats or <br />
second guessing ourselves once it all starts and all madness breaks loose. <br />
<br />
&quot;And remember,&quot; Marie Cruz sighed, &quot;This isn't just us at stake, nor one town, or one child, <br />
this possibly the entire world, I suggest you all pray to The Lord that we succeed. Our lives <br />
are forfeit in front of this task.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Marie,&quot; Kathrine put a hand up on her shoulder, &quot;I'm sorry, but I'm not going to discard <br />
you life in this or anyone else's here.&quot; <br />
<br />
Linus and Draco stayed silent. <br />
<br />
Marie smiled, &quot;You're a wonderful nun Kathrine, you deserve it a lot more than I do... and <br />
in a kinder world you'd be the best of all people. ... But our lives don't mean as much in <br />
regards to all this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kathrine's eyes narrowed, &quot;And the lives of all the children the witches have enslaved?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We've all chosen to put on their mantle, none of them have! None of them were given a <br />
chose over what happened to them.&quot;  None of the hunters so much as reminded Marie Cruz <br />
that Mal'Akh had said that the slave Afua  had apparently become a part of the witches' <br />
entourage of her own free will. And none of them knew at this time that the gang  Linus <br />
had reported of murderous thugs who had vanished that were now among those innocent <br />
children the hunters sought to free. &quot;I did my absolute hardest to keep you from following <br />
me here Kathrine. Father Draco could have turned me down and even reported me to the <br />
authorities for my crimes. Vatican could have chosen to honor his oath to protect The <br />
Vatican over his oath to my father to protect me, and Linus could have chosen to simply let <br />
us pass! All of us have chosen to walk down this road, and we'll have to see it through to <br />
the end.&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;It's my birthday,&quot; Joella thought, &quot;And that means I can do whatever I want!&quot; True, her <br />
foster-mothers had declared she was free to do as she wished whenever and whatever she <br />
liked anyway, but on her birthday those boundaries were somehow pushed even further <br />
back, and if she wanted to see Mal'Akh on her birthday! Then she'd seen Mal'Akh on her <br />
birthday! <br />
<br />
The witches, in particular Golgatha and Herodias, would have normally noticed Joella's <br />
departure at once, but like the children they claimed to be still at heart (with the <br />
immaturity to match) they let slip the responsibilities, and Golgatha in particular  was <br />
distracted by an odd dream she had been having lately, incomplete half images, it would <br />
come together perfectly when she'd have her final vision that would inspire her and her <br />
sisters to defy a victory handed to them by fate and give secretly give Joella to their god-<br />
father along with a child familiar for protection so Joella would be in position to sacrifice <br />
herself for her mothers. <br />
<br />
Humans were built for enduring unforgiving climates, endurance, climbing, and the most <br />
precise and fine and delicate hands of all the species of Man and thus the ultimate tool <br />
user.  And her mind was on Mal'Akh. As she walked out of the witches' grounds, the thorn <br />
maze changing shape to allow her to pass without so much as turning a corner, and Free <br />
not interfering in her will in anyway... it took a while for Joella to realize she was being <br />
followed. <br />
<br />
'Where is she going? Why is going where she is going? Why is she going alone? Why is she <br />
not going with someone else? What is at where she is going that is not someplace else she <br />
could go? Why is it there and no elsewhere?' Lark thought curiously tilting her head like a <br />
bird would when she noticed Joella leave mostly cause she was waiting her turn to play one <br />
of the more popular games. <br />
<br />
Jimmy was riding 'horsie' with Mondain Renard, the adult male of the Witch Pride along <br />
with Oliver.  Lark considered waiting for him, but her curiosity won out, and she followed <br />
Joella (Joella still wearing an incredibly beautiful birthday dress given to her as a present <br />
that very day that would make some real princesses green with envy and no Puritan would <br />
ever dream of buying for it's absurd emphasis on appearance and thus vanity). <br />
<br />
&quot;Where ya going?&quot; Betty asked as Flora and Peter Renard (the Witch Pride's cubs) were <br />
painting and drawing on every inch of her naked body like was a canvas.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm just gonna go see where Joella is going.&quot; Lark answered honestly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh okay.&quot; Betty nodded and went back to giggling as Flora and Peter continued to paint <br />
her. <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Marie-Elize wondered how long it would take before one of her audience to remember <br />
Renard had been Fox's maiden name, and was NOT just happenstance they were the same. <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
<br />
For Lark, it was like she was setting foot on a new world, she felt like she hadn't step foot <br />
outside the witch's ground her entire life (she was right). <br />
<br />
The various horses had become ponies, a breed of horse smaller and much more tame that <br />
traditional mares and stallions. The animals obeyed their younger and younger masters <br />
with almost entranced perfection.  Not to mention many of them were colors that had no <br />
business existence outside of a rainbow. <br />
<br />
The various other domestic animals had undergone various other changes, becoming <br />
brightly colored, and become stunningly docile and tame. The donkeys of course were the <br />
last to go, their world famous stubbornness fighting to the bitter end until they too, were <br />
little more than flesh and blood toy animals with obedient little minds to match. <br />
<br />
The plants had grown nearly to weed, all brightly colored, all cheerful, all pretty looking, <br />
some in a growth pattern as if they were smiling!  The poor woman who had suffered <br />
miscarriage, now looked like they had never been pregnant, or two looking too young to <br />
even be properly wed. <br />
<br />
The girl with her dark hair in a pony tail not wearing a stitch of anything save for the band <br />
that held her hair in place walked behind Joella without a peep of alarm of complaint from <br />
the puritans, which should have been a dead give away about how thick the fog in their <br />
perceptions had become.  If the little boy wearing shorts far too large for him riding a <br />
purple pony through a field of flowers that had once been main street for fun was not a big <br />
enough clue. <br />
<br />
Lark looked at all of this in wonder. Joella smiled seeing how her foster mothers were <br />
making the world a more beautiful place and giving everyone their youth and innocence <br />
back, after all, they all LOOKED happy didn't they? Happier than she remembered them <br />
being a year ago. She knew they'd find a true cure for the wandering demons soon! <br />
<br />
The houses themselves were becoming garishly colored, some even slightly changing <br />
shape to accommodate their changing residence. <br />
<br />
Joella arrived at Mal'Akh's home, she saw Mal'Akh's parents who seemed younger than <br />
when Joella had last seen them, she smiled and waved at them, and they smiled and waved <br />
back. She smiled when she saw the tiny hints of rainbow color in their fur... yes.. her <br />
foster-mothers, (not that she'd call them that to their faces) were healing Glendale, she <br />
just knew it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mal'Akh... are you home?&quot; She called out. <br />
<br />
Silence. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your mom and dad let me in! I hope I'm not intruding...&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally, the lion girl who looked like a slightly older version of Aimiliona peaked out from <br />
behind a couch. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why--why are you here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted to visit.&quot; Joella didn't want to risk yet hurting her feelings and tell her it was <br />
Joella's birthday. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you bring one of -them- with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Joella looked around and finally noticed the human Lark standing as naked as a <br />
leoman  a couple feet behind her like she was on a family outing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lark?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Joella?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To see what you're doing here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I didn't know what you were going to be doing here, and I wanted to know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you want to know?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lark blinked her big eyes and placed her chin against the back of her hand thinking, <br />
&quot;Hmmm.... I guess I just wanted to know why. This is your birthday, so that makes <br />
everything you do special right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Today is your birthday?&quot; Mal'Akh thought, 'witches have birthdays?' <br />
<br />
Joella looked as red as the ruby broach she was wearing, &quot;Uh... I didn't want to bring it up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Happy Birthday.&quot; Mal'Akh said as was civilized.  &quot;Couldn't you have at least brought <br />
Aimiliona?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't mean to bring Lark, but she wanted to come, she was curious.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mal'Akh remembered, this girl had been watching them always while at the witches' <br />
grounds, like a predator laying wait, ready to spring, (fear was not a trust worthy <br />
interpreter of events). <br />
<br />
The child familiar side stepped Joella and stuck out a hand to the leoman cub, &quot;I'm Lark, I <br />
think we've met before, right?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... I think we have...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh goodie! That means we're friends! And you're Aimiliona's sister right? Cause if I'm <br />
Joella's friend/sister, and you're Joella's friend,  and if Aimiliona is my friend/sister, that <br />
makes us sisters right?&quot; <br />
<br />
Looking at this creature, this servant of evil in front of her wearing a smiling face, <br />
declaring they were family then and there when her own sister had barely even recognized <br />
her since going mad, at last, something in Mal'Akh broke. <br />
<br />
&quot;I AM NOT YOUR SISTER! YOU ARE NO ONE'S SISTER! You're not a girl! You're not a hue-<br />
mans! You're not a person! You're just a bird! An animal that those wicked witches turned <br />
into something that LOOKED LIKE a girl! You're just ah-ah A -THING-!&quot; <br />
<br />
A look of dismay, horror and confusion crossed Lark's mind. And her childish imagination, <br />
began to spiral like a whirl wind, 'I'm really a bird? Is that why my name is a bird? That's <br />
why I can't remember any stuff from before I lived with-ow! Is that why I can't-ow- <br />
remember?' <br />
<br />
Lark broke down crying right into Joella's shoulder. &quot;I am too a girl! Am too a person!&quot; <br />
<br />
Alice asked, &quot;Did you Marie-Eliza, not tell us before at some point in this story, or at least <br />
narrate as such, that souls have no genders or species? Or am I thinking of one of a <br />
spiritual discussion that Ami took part in?&quot; <br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza simply nodded, &quot;Indeed souls aren't defined in such terms, but Mal'Akh had no <br />
way to know that. And she was angry, scared, worried, desperate, and all those things will <br />
make any child lash out at any available outlet, Lark had the misfortune of being such.&quot; <br />
<br />
Joella looked at the crying girl just a little under a year younger than her (the witches kept <br />
the familiars ages all the same too). Joella remembered the bad men with guns, she <br />
remembered her guardians' wraith, she remembered how they had given all those bad men <br />
a chance do their lives over again not weighted down by the bad things they had done <br />
before. But Lark was no longer that bad person! She was alive! A person! <br />
<br />
Joella hugged her, &quot;It's okay Lark, I promise, you've always been human. You're a real girl.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;P-promise?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I promise...&quot; Joella said stroking her hair, &quot;You're not a bird.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mal'Akh meanwhile also stared in shock... monsters didn't cry... did they?</p>
