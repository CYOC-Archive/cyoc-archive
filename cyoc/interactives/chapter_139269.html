<br />
The months spent at the camp training were more physically demanding than anything they had previously done, save their trial. Their daily routine was difficult at first, but they learned to adapt or they would get left behind. Morning involved a light breakfast after exercises and combat drills. Midday had them sitting in lessons and practicing various craftes and even some battle strategy and small scale leadership. Sara had discovered she was an excellent cook, able to make use of minimal ingredients and still make it taste amazing. Jack and Vect found a talent in the forge making armour and weapons, some students wanted to commission them for some items. Vect had found he also had a talent for sewing, though several male students teased him on it the instructor, a massive amazon pointed out how much they would appreciate fine needlework during the winter. They had brushed it off until the snow came and everyone was bundling up in some of the coats Vect had made, then the jokes turned to praise. Lelu was enjoying the trap making lessons and tactics lessons along with Jack. Afterwards it was sparring practice in the camp center where they could practice the morning&#39;s lessons and perfect their own techniques. Lelu had difficulty at first as she had never wielded a weapon before, but Jack was more than willing to help her, what was surprising was how she had become adept in hand-to-hand combat, using spells to add more power to her blows. One teacher had some training in the monk&#39;s school taught her the movements he had learned, and soon her brawling style had become more disciplined and flowed from one attack into the next. The training had been difficult but the results did not lie as all four had firmed up from the training, becoming more defined especially Jack and Lelu. While Jack was looking like the poster boy for what a barbarian should look like, Lelu&#39;s growth was more noticeable as her thin frame filled out into a warriors. Vect and Sara had not grown as much in that same span, but Vect had gotten much faster than the others, even out pacing some teachers. Sara caught herself looking over her body. Well muscled arms, legs thick with power, a vivid set of abs, her breasts had shrunk slightly due to the regiment, but were more firm and didn&#39;t bounce in the way when she opted to forgo her top. Even her tail was more powerful, able to lift a shortsword and use it in battle, which she did in some sparring matches. Dinner was the time to relax and socialize with each other, the meal prepared by both teachers and students that had been selected beforehand. The winter was a pain to get through, but everyone was ecstatic when the snow finally melted. Postal day was usually an exciting time for the camp. Every 2 months, a caravan would arrive from the south to bring supplies that the camp could not supply it self and letters, and leave with any messages the students wanted sent. However as the day got closer Vect seemed increasingly worried.<br />
&quot;Hey you&#39;ve been acting strange ever since you sent off that letter, even more so now. What&#39;s wrong,&quot; asked Sara 2 days before it was scheduled to arrive.<br />
Vect didn&#39;t look at Sara as he responded from his sitting position on the ground at the edge of the sparring grounds, thick beads of sweat running down his face and bare chest from the match he had just finished, going against 2 students at once to test his abilities. &quot;Besides the bruises I know I&#39;m going to have later?,&quot; he panted trying to cool down in the spring air. &quot;Last time post day came I sent a letter home. I&#39;m expecting a response. I know they will respond once they see I&#39;m here instead of at say; a knight&#39;s school, or a Nobleman College. When I went to the training school, I was given VERY specific classes I was allowed to take. This is the opposite of those on the list. I know they&#39;ll demand I either withdraw and join another class, or worse return home.&quot; Vect continued to look at the ground intently.<br />
&quot;Then why did you come if you&#39;re so scared of their response?&quot;<br />
He looked up at her, &quot;Because I didn&#39;t want to leave you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Wha?&quot; Sara took a step back.<br />
Vect realized the way he said it and needed to recover this quickly. &quot;Uh, I didn&#39;t want to leave any of you guys.&quot; &#39;Yes that works.&#39; &quot;Back home it is surprisingly lonely. There are no friends for heirs, only subjects and ass kissers. I feel happy being around you. I didn&#39;t want to loose you by going down another path. I do miss Mai and I wrote her as well. As a kid, I was told how to do everything, coming to the training school is my chance to choose my own path, at least until I come of age. Then I&#39;m to return home and do my duty.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then stand up to them if you really want to stay.&quot;<br />
Vect gave a halfhearted laugh, &quot;they&#39;ll eventually send someone to drag me back if they have to.&quot;<br />
&quot;Is there any way out?&quot;<br />
&quot;I could go into hiding, abandon my family and forfeit my claim, be on the run for a few years. That would make things more difficult.&quot; He looked down at his calloused hands and clenched them into fists. He looked up slowly, &quot;There might be another way.&quot; He stood up. &quot;Shaman Gratz wanted to see us after sparring practice for some kind of special event. I&#39;m going to go wash before that, you coming?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure. Don&#39;t do anything rash Vect.&quot; <br />
Vect looked at Sara, giving her a half smile, &quot;do I look like jack?&quot;<br />
They headed to the bathhouse together.</p>
