<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a general fashion store for women&#39;s clothing, and one of the smaller ones from what you could tell. The clothing ranged from various tops, bottoms, dresses, and some other items that could be used in either casual or fashionable outings. You couldn&#39;t really say more than that because as a guy you didn&#39;t really care much about women&#39;s fashion other then if it looked good on them and if it fit the situation.<br />
<br />
One of the female clerks was preparing you for what seemed to be the morning opening and this was the first time you were being really handled for your job as a mannequin rather then just an object to be carried around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, its one of those monoboob ones. Guess we&#39;ll put it more towards the back.&quot; Said the clerk while she was figuring how to use you in the store. For some reason you felt genuinely insulted by this comment, but you gave a mental shrug as she continued getting you ready.<br />
<br />
You were thankful for whatever changes were done to make you comfortable as a mannequin as you felt the more intimate touches of the clerk&#39;s purposeful adjustments. You never, ever felt the need to move or even flinch. The was somewhat more odd feelings when she adjusted your limbs at the few seams you had, and in some cases detached your arms while she put a fashionable floral dress over you. Of course she would need to do that because you are a mannequin, you wouldn&#39;t just come to life to move your arms into position. At least you still felt your disembodied arms somehow.<br />
<br />
Soon she was finished with the dress and posing you, and finally put you on a small raised platform with a stand. Up until this point, you had a proper standing pose to not fall over without interaction, although the trip in the van proved it took little to knock you over. It made sense you would need one and she attached you accordingly. She did a few more adjustments to your pose and finished off adding a matching sunhat.<br />
<br />
It suddenly hit you. The reality of being a mannequin. You already got use to being one physically for the most part, but it dawned on you that you would most likely be in this one position for most, if not all of the day. But once again, you felt a sort of contentment. It also helped that your ability to still &quot;look around&quot; despite having unmoving, undetailed eyes. Of course you couldn&#39;t turn your head to look around better, but you loved that you could look at the clerks in a vouyeuristic way whenever they came into view. Soon the time came to open, and you took a mental breath to begin your day.<br />
<br />
It was morning, however. The female clerks had very little to do at this point and looking bored out of their minds, but finally a lady came in. It looked like some 30&#39;s woman of average looks. She looked at this and that, but nothing particularly seemed to interest her. There was points she got near you, but other then looking at the dress that was on you, its like you didn&#39;t exist. Once again, you were a mannequin. Despite her average looks though, you eyeballed her with nothing better to do. Soon she went on her way out, and the day continued.<br />
<br />
The day went on. More women of various looks came in, you looked at them, they did their business, and they left. Knowing in the back of your mind that you were on the job for security duties, you eventually expanded to try and look at things around the store and out into the mall proper, even if you were in a bad position to do so in the store. You had a bit of wish to be at the front for a better view, but something kind of nagged at you that it was a matter of pride. <br />
<br />
With nothing better to do, that last part stuck out to you and wondering if that was another part of mental changes to be a mannequin. To test things out, you tried paying attention to what the women coming in were wearing to see if you cared a bit, and what they seemed to be looking at would be good for them. It turns out you did. You were no skilled fashionista, but as the day went on, it became obvious something like it was something you cared about as a mannequin. Perhaps that&#39;s why you felt insulted about your pyramidal mono-boob when one of the clerks commented on it earlier. <br />
<br />
So time continued on, more traffic came, but there was still plenty of time for nothing to happen. But you weren&#39;t bored. You could stand there all day, not be tired, not be unhappy. You especially appreciated when you got to look at some hotter women that came in, and you even entertained some thoughts with trying out some clothes in the store if you ever got the chance. Your mannequin senses also did well for telling you times when you could move. You knew there was cameras around the mall and store, but you guessed you were in a blind spot because you &quot;felt&quot; plenty of times where you could move including when the clerks weren&#39;t paying attention as well as any store-goers. Heck, there was times you felt you COULDN&#39;T move because someone far off in the mall proper happened to be looking in your direction. You couldn&#39;t see them, but you did &quot;feel&quot; them in a general direction. <br />
<br />
You decided to be a little risky and moved your head on your neck seam just a bit when you &quot;felt&quot; okay to do it. You did it, and you were sure no one noticed. You played with the idea of doing more adjustments, but felt it was too risky to raise any suspicion of your pose changing. Even if people thought they were going insane from noticing it, you were here to protect from chaos, not cause it. Especially on the first day of the job.<br />
<br />
Eventually the day ended. The clerks closed up the store, took the dress off you, and took you off the stand to be put somewhere in a storage in the back with other mannequins. You were left leaning against a shelf and in the dark (which you found out you could see in, although not perfectly). You felt you had plenty of opportunity to move from your mannequin sense, but decided to wait a bit to make sure no one was around. Then you thought about it:</p>
