<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Samantha left the main conference room at Moon Lake&#39;s city hall with every sense of frustration in her mind. The situation they had with regard to the Harper/Jenkins wedding represented the last issues that related to the consequences of Yvette Smith&#39;s actions, but had problems that had nothing to do with Moon Lake other than that Jenny and Harry were citizens of Moon Lake. Moon Lake owed the two young werefoxes all they could to keep them safe, which Dieter Wilhelm&#39;s actions seemed to threaten.<br />
<br />
&quot;The hits seem to keep coming,&quot; Katherine Chambers spoke with a sigh as she came up to Samantha.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, especially as a lot of this will mean having to keep Harry... and possibly Jenny... kept in a small space until their wedding since we have nothing we can legally use to arrest this second agent at the present time,&quot; Samantha answered, &quot;and while young love birds may like being together, it&#39;ll still be a major interruption of their schedule, loss of time in their respective classes, and no work on their part to plan for their wedding until either A) this agent leaves Moon Lake of his own accord, B) we gain enough evidence to arrest him, or C) the wedding itself when we&#39;re already expecting and planning for the proverbial shit to hit the fan.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two walked along quietly before Samantha continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the meantime, we have the mess in Seattle to keep an eye on and at the same time we have a new family moving in according to what the college dean has said to us,&quot; Samantha continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;A new family?&quot; Katherine wondered, &quot;Shortly before Halloween?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, hired to teach economics or history or something at the college, but signed a contract that would have him starting until the next semester,&quot; Samantha answered, &quot;The guy called the dean on the day he left for here. So we&#39;ll need to be ready... especially as their last name is also Jenkins and the father is named Harold.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Any relation to the werefox we&#39;re trying to protect?&quot; Katherine wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t know,&quot; Samantha shrugged, &quot;I may ask when I meet them in person... but right now I have some phone calls to make.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katherine nodded and both made their way toward their respective offices. Samantha entered hers and told her secretary to hold any and all incoming phone calls for awhile so she could begin what would likely be a lengthy game of phone tag to make sure that Harry and Jenny could be kept safe until Dieter Wilhelm&#39;s agent was no longer a threat. From there she closed the door to her actual office and settled into her chair. The first thing she did was to turn on her desk computer and begin going through the various contact numbers that she kept on file. The first was the college dean who she called directly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Dean Myers, this is Samantha Twist at City Hall, do you have a moment to talk?&quot; Samantha spoke into the phone after the male weretiger answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can... is something wrong?&quot; Dean Myers asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It isn&#39;t so much wrong as it is a threat,&quot; Samantha spoke, &quot;you are familiar that the STUDENT Harry Jenkins and Jennifer Harper are planning to get married this coming weekend, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve heard that,&quot; Dean Myers answered, &quot;I&#39;ve also heard from Campus Security that someone came on campus looking for miss Harper this past week.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, the result of a obsessed lunatic trying to keep miss Harper to himself,&quot; Samantha answered, &quot;the man your campus security found out about is dead, but the man who sent him has sent another agent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He wouldn&#39;t dare...&quot; Dean Myers growled his voice dropping almost a full octave.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have the concern that he may try to kill the student Harry Jenkins and need a safe place that he can be kept until his wedding day,&quot; Samantha answered, &quot;and possibly keeping miss Harper with him as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can they still attend classes?&quot; Dean Myers answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a possibility,&quot; Samantha said slowly, &quot;as this guy won&#39;t have an image of what Jenny looks like now and certainly wouldn&#39;t have a picture of Harry. In that they could probably hide from him in plane sight. Though that could also be a potential danger as we don&#39;t know how well this man is armed. He could potentially have a hunting rifle and set up camp at a spot where he&#39;d be hidden in the woods with a clear line of sight of the campus green and would wait until he sees someone he thinks matches Jenny&#39;s pre-vixen description and then gun down whoever &quot;she&quot; is with...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will NOT have my students gunned down on MY campus!&quot; Dean Myers growled again, a weretiger&#39;s highly protective instincts kicking in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully we won&#39;t have that happening,&quot; Samantha answered, &quot;You may need to have your campus security patrol the edges of the campus and be on the alert for suspicions. The big thing is going to be keeping miss Harper and young Mr. Jenkins safe, as the first agent sent here made it all the way to miss Harper&#39;s dorm room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will have campus security on alert and on patrol, and I will see to that personally,&quot; Dean Myers answered, &quot;and I suppose we could offer to give Harry and Jenny access to the college&#39;s &quot;safe room&quot; during the night...&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha gave a sigh. The &quot;safe rooms&quot; that the hospital, the college, the Moon Lake Police Department Building, and even Moon Lake&#39;s City Hall Building had were all built to help deal with potential issues related to a new were being &quot;incomplete&quot; for some reason. The rooms were secure enough that a fully transformed were would lack the physical power to break out of the room and thus be a danger to themselves, other weres, or to any normal in Moon Lake. Normally these rooms were only needed when there were accidents when the were who initiated the transformation had done so by complete accident and never realized it or that the initial coupling had been deliberate between the two but something interrupted the transformation before it could be completed. Situations like what had happened with Yvette Smith going rogue and infecting two normals was fairly rare.<br />
<br />
Samantha knew that would make those rooms highly defensible and that this agent of Dieter Wilhelm&#39;s wouldn&#39;t even know of their existence, but that didn&#39;t mean such an option would sit well with Harry or Jenny. Jenny had had to be in the hospital&#39;s safe room because her transformation was incomplete. Samantha didn&#39;t know if Jenny would want to be in a situation like that again, even if it was for her own safety, though she also had to privately admit that she didn&#39;t know of too many other options. She tapped her fingers on her desk for a moment and then came up with a question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would there be any other solution?&quot; Samantha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The only other one that I&#39;d know of would be to have them stay with someone other than family here in Moon Lake,&quot; Dean Myers answered, &quot;though I&#39;d need to talk with them personally to see which they&#39;d prefer and  make sure things are clear with whoever they wish to stay with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you contact them?&quot; Samantha asked, &quot;and then let me know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know how long this issue with this agent will last?&quot; Dean Myers asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;At the longest until the wedding day,&quot; Samantha answered, &quot;by then the wedding will have occurred and whatever criminal mischief that the man who sent the agent has will be played out... likely with him revealing his cards and intents to the point where we can arrest him for something that will stick for a LONG time. However, with this second agent... for the moment we don&#39;t have enough that we could use to justify arresting him. At best we can only observe and monitor him, though the police and the Skulk are likely going to put together some sting operation plans in case this agent does reveal something that we can use in a court of law... but we don&#39;t know how long that will take.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha heard a heavy growling sigh and knew that the college dean was likely feeling the same frustration that she and the others who had just come out of the conference on dealing with this new agent of Dieter Wilhelm felt. Eventually he did answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I&#39;ll let them know of the situation and give them their options and then I&#39;ll get back to you,&quot; Dean Myers answered, &quot;but please keep me posted on whatever the police and the Skulk find out with this guy. I&#39;ll have campus security on alert and on patrol in case this guy tries something... but I&#39;d like to be able to know that what I&#39;m doing is in coordination with the police.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Samantha nodded, &quot;we&#39;ll do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Samantha hung up and gave a sigh. For the moment it would appear that they would have the means to keep Harry and Jenny safe, at least with regard to a plan. It might not be much, but it was something.</p>
