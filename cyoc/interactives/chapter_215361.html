<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The full moon cast its light softly through the window and provided enough light to show both of them what had happened. Derrick rocked back and felt a tug on his member. Looking down he gasped from what he saw. Light brown fur covered from his belly button down to his legs. Remy likewise gasped and tried to pull away feeling herself locked to her former master. Derick still examining himself exclaimed. “This can’t be. This all has to be a bad dream!? But why does this all feel real.” Almost instinctually he reached around and pitched himself. “Ouch! Nope this is definitely not a dream!” Remy likewise shocked looked at Derrick and accused. “What did you do?” Derick looked at Remy with a confused look on his face and exclaimed. “Don’t look at me. I didn’t make myself grow what looks to be a dog cock!” Remy looked down at herself and Derricks new member. It has to be the coin! Derick looked up and saw the coin around Remy’s neck. His gaze then drifted down slightly. “You changed too!” Derrick exclaimed. Remy looked at Derrick’s direction and gasped. “What, I’ve, I’ve got breasts.” A dawn of realization fell on Derrick. “I’m goanna call that woman!” Derick exclaimed. “What are we going to do now in the meantime?” Remy asked. Derrick replied with a shudder. “I guess we wait and calm down, and then we can separate.” Eventually this did happen. Derrick pulled from Remy his cum dripping from his cock and Remy’s pussy. His red cock retracted into its new home and completely out of sight. “This is going to take some getting used to.” Derrick thought to himself. He looked at Remy and asked in a calm concerned voice. “Are you okay? Well at least as okay as you could be.” Remy sat there and nodded. She sat there for several more second and commented. “You, you felt…” This got Derricks attention and Remy looked as abashed as a German shepherd could. She then finished. “Amazing.” Derick blushed and likewise ashamedly replied. “You did too.” That was then when both of them made eye contact. That moment it was as if an understanding passed between them. “Let’s get some rest.” Remy suggested crawling under the blanket. “Okay I guess that we can.” Derick replied. He then thought of something and asked. “Remy, could you please pull off that coin? I don’t want any more surprises tonight. Remy grinned a wolfish grin and replied. “Okay but I’m not sure if it will do any good.” Derick grinned back at her and crawled under the covers to lie next to her. Remy then pulled off the coin neckless and set it on the night stand next to the camper bed. “No underwear?” Remy observed. Derick blushed and replied. “Honestly I didn’t even think of those.” Remy chuckled and replied. “Its fine with me.” She again wiggled against him. But they didn’t drift off, but laid there enjoying being close to each other. Derrick was the first to break the silence. “Remy… I feel.” He paused and continued. “I don’t know why, but I have never felt this attracted to someone in my life.” Remy rolled over faced Derick. She starred into his eyes as if drinking him in. She then replied. “I understand. I can’t shake this feeling.” Remy then Reached for Derick. She rested her rough ringers against his cheek. Lightly dragging one of her black claws along the ridge of his chin. Derrick felt a tingle run down his spine at the gentle touch. He then felt the urge and he likewise reached for her. He rested his hand just above her hip. Remy then started to gently run her hand down until she started to gently stroke the new fur around his new sheath. Derrick likewise started to explore her running his index finger around her right breast nipple. He felt himself getting hard and could not suppress the urge to grind one, now twice against her rump. It felt amazing and electrifying. He then gave the breast that he was exploring a gentle squeeze and Remy let out a gasp in pleasure. Almost as if instinct was guiding him.  Derick then rolled himself on top of her. “Wait!” Remy gasped. Freezing Derick replied. “I’m sorry I should not…” Remy interrupted Derick by replying. “No I want this.” She then rolled over onto her chest and stuck her butt up and curled her tail to the side. “Please.” She gasped. Derrick didn’t think twice. He obeyed her wish. He Hunched over her back and moved forward. He found her on the first try and entered her swelled soft lips. He groaned and Remy gasped and started panting. Like before he was slow to enter the depths. She was already dripping with wetness but he wanted her to enjoy it. He realized then that he cared more about her enjoyment more than his own. He still felt enjoyment from the pleasure full sensations coming from their connection. But he felt more pleasure when Remy expressed her enjoyment in the joining. He continued pumping deeper and deeper. He could feel her clench and unclench and he timed his thrust to the orgasms. Finally he his throbbing knot was pressing against her pussy once gain but he did not enter yet. Remy stared rocking back against him gently timing their thrusts together. Derrick felt the change in sensations and was even more aroused. He suddenly felt the urge to bite Remy’s neck and hold onto her scruff. He did this gently holding on with his teeth as he pumped. It was as he did this that Remy moaned. “Derick! You feel so-big.” But in this turmoil of love making completely unnoticed by either of them the coin started to glow once again. Derricks head started to lengthen. This went unnoticed due their intense love making. His jaw extended along with his nose which gained mass and the nostrils reformed. The tongue lengthened and widened. Derrick not noticing this had his eyes shut in concentration holding himself back. His ears then started to grow and reshape. Moving to the top of his head. Then black and light blondish fur started to sprout on his newly formed face and head. The hair on his head receded and fur took its place. Suddenly he felt that he could not hold it no longer. He pushed the knot in just in time as Remy climaxed. He felt himself pumping into his new lover and felt euphoria course through his body like never before. Everything felt so right and sensitive. Remy laid there in evident bliss as the sensations of their climax washed through her body. The coin became dark once again. “R-remy, that was amazing.” Derrick gasped after he had released his hold on her neck. Remy carefully rolled her body over until they were laying chest to chest and face to face. Remy suddenly exclaimed. “Derrick your face! What’s wrong with my face?” He asked. Remy stared back at him and exclaimed. “You have a dogs face!” Derrick lost interest in what his cock was doing and instantly reached for his face. His fingers contacted whiskers and soft fur. Horrified he continued to explore his features. Pulling back his lips he felt his elongated k9 teeth that were pointed and sharp. Remy commented “I think you look even more attractive now! This didn’t seem to calm him as he felt his new pointed ears. “Why is this happening?” He asked in fright. “Calm down.” Remy encouraged. That was when they finally slipped apart. “It’s not too bad Remy replied.” “Not to bad?” Derrick then paused realizing what he was about to say. “Remy commented you look like me now. So attractive!” She then growled a playful growl and pounced at him.</p>
