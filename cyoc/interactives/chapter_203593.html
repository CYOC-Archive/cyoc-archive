<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sighing Marisa MacGregor now leaned back in her office chair, a contented smile upon her face. After interviewing the Kitsune Akira, she had quickly gone to work crafting yet another novel. While the novel could be described as a true story, she knew no one would truly believe that. Once more she would be credited with crafting a truly unique fictional tale of the fantastical.<br />
<br />
“Hey honey.”<br />
<br />
Marisa now glanced up, a warm smile on her face as she gazed at her husband Liam. Liam MacGregor was a relatively short man, standing perhaps 5’6” with a rather plain face and average body. A corporate lawyer by trade, Liam had moved his family here after being promoted. Despite the stereotype of the soulless lawyer though, Liam had proven himself to be perhaps the kindest, gentlest, man Marisa had ever met. This gentle and kind nature is what attracted the vampire to the man. “Hello honey,” she smiled. “I didn’t here you come in.”<br />
<br />
“Well I have been working on my Nina skills,” he joked, drawing a sympathetic laugh from Marisa. “And you’ve just been so focused on your new book. How’s it going anyway.” Marisa stretched, scanning over her writings with pride. “Better than I could have imagined,” she said. “It almost feels like its writing itself.”<br />
<br />
“And probably why you’re I’ve been missing meals,” he replied. Liam now approached, placing a rather large mug of warm blood in front of his wife. “Where did yu get this,” she asked.<br />
<br />
“Blood bank,” he answered. “Paid the guy a good chunk of change too. You know, never would have thought that blood banks were a front for vampires until we met.”<br />
<br />
“No one ever does,” Marisa grinned. “Why do you think the Red Croos is always holding blood drives? Helps to keep the peace.” Liam chuckled softly, rubbing his wives shoulders as the vampire took a sip. “Your favorite AB,” he said softly. “Can’t have my favorite girl working on a empty stomach.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you Liam you’re so sweet,” she smiled, using a napkin to dab the blood from her lips. As the vampire now happily gazed into her husbands eyes, she couldn’t help but feel a certain contentment wash over. She had never been a violent vampire, never wanting to harm humans when she still lived within the vampire nation. Growing up her family would often drink animal blood only rarely sampling human blood from blood banks. While Marisa was content to feast on animal blood, their was no denying that human blood did taste better. The closest she could describe the taste was by comparing an expensive steak to ground beef. The tastes were similar but you could tell which was the better product. The sound of the door now opening and closing, now drew Marisa from her musings as she called out. “Natalia is that you?”<br />
<br />
“Um yeah mom,” Nat replied. “And I um....brought friends.”<br />
<br />
Marisa And Liam now have eachother a curious look. They were used to Reiko coming over but from the sound of things it appeared Nat had brought over more than just Rei. Tucking her mug of blood away, Marisa now slowly exited her office, gazing towards the front door.<br />
<br />
Nat now shifted nervously in place, the damphir teen appearing flummoxed. Maria’s And Liam immediately noticed Rei, as well as four other teens that were unfamiliar to the couple. “Hello,” she said, waving politely. “Were Nat’s parents.”<br />
<br />
“Hi Mr. and Mrs MacGregor,” Rei exclaimed. “Hope you don’t mind us dropping in.”<br />
<br />
“Well it would be nicer if we had notice Rei,” Liam stated. “But why don’t you introduce us to amour friends.”<br />
<br />
“Oh okay,” Rei said quickly. “This is Miranda and Miles Desoto.” Miranda now have the married couple a timid wave as Miles studied them carefully. Marisa now gave the siblings a slight smile as she waved to them, noting the two teens appeared a bit apprehensive to be in her home. “And who are these two,” Marisa asked, gesturing towards a sandy haired boy and his green haired companion.<br />
<br />
“Umm that’s Connor,” Nat answered quietly. “Connor Moreland and his girlfriend Spark.” Marisa’s eyes went wide as she stared at the boy. “Moreland,” she whispered, to which Connor nodded. Marisa now gulped, beginning to understand why Nat appeared so anxious. When they had met the Moreland family she had been introduced to everyone except the youngest son. It appeared now though that the boy was standing in her home, which meant that Nat as well as Marisa’s secret had been exposed.<br />
<br />
“I see,” she said softly. Taking a breath she now straightened herself as she pointed towards the living room. “Shall we all take a seat? I’m sure we all have a lot of questions.” Making their way towards a set of couches, Marisa took a seat in an easy chair, her husband by her side as he wearily eyed Connor and Spark. As the teens sat on the couch, Marisa noted her daughter sporting a defeated look. Obviously the teenager had not wished to reveal her damphir nature and was feeling guilty for not telling her friends who found out unexpectedly.<br />
<br />
“Geez why is everybody so tense,” Spark asked. “It’s not like someone died or anything.” Marisa now cleared her throat, casting a dubious look at the punk looking teenager. “No,” Marisa answered. “However I take it everyone in this room is aware of my daughters true nature.”<br />
<br />
“That she’s a damphir yeah,” Spark stated. “I should apologize too for Connor trapping her,. It was my bad, I thought she was a vampire.”<br />
<br />
“Trap her?!”<br />
<br />
“Yeah totally got caught up in the moment,” Spark continued. “We were hunting some rogue vampires and then red over there kinda wandered into view. My bad totally I thought she was a vampire but Connor here wasn’t so sure. That’s why he wrapped her up instead of shooting her through the heart. Should have remembered that their was another damphir in town after meeting you.”<br />
<br />
“Hold on back up,” Liam exclaimed. “You almost shot my little girl!”<br />
<br />
“But we didn’t,” Spark corrected, Connor turning red in embarrassment as Mr. MacGregor turned red with anger. “See Connor here remembered his brother and dad telling him about a god vampire, which is kind of an oxymoron since like 95% of the vampires I’ve met are always trying to drain humans dry. But not you for whatever reason.”<br />
<br />
“Hold up your moms a vampire,” Miles asked. Nat simply buried her face in her hands, giving her friend a nod. The Desotos turning their gaze between Spark, Nat, And Marisa as they tried to wrap their minds around the fact that not only Nat half vampire, her mother was an actual vampire.<br />
<br />
“Hey don’t be so shocked,” Spark exclaimed. “Seriously it’s not that big a deal. I mean I’m a fairy and you don’t see people getting all freaked out about it do you.”<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry a fairy,” Miranda asked.<br />
<br />
Spark nodded, standing up befor the twins. In an instant where a petite punky  looking teenage girl stood, a green fairy with blond hair now fluttered before them. Miranda And Miles had gasped as the teen girl shrank instantly, her clothes vanishing as the small green speck fluttered in front of them. “Holy crap,” the twins whispered. Just as quickly the fairy now transformed back into a teenage girl, a mischievous smirk etched on her young face. “See no big deal.”<br />
<br />
“Uh it’s kind of a big deal,” Miles stated. “Up until recently I didn’t think magic, vampires, and fairies evens existed!”<br />
<br />
“Sonyur telling me you were sheltered then,” Spark answered, causing Miles to frown at the girl. <br />
<br />
“Well it is a big deal to me,” Nat replied sadly. “I’m not suppose to tell anyone. Bad things could happen, people might hate me, my family could get hurt.”<br />
<br />
“Whoa nothing bad is gonna happen Nat,” Miranda said quickly, taking her friends hand. “We don’t hate you, were just...surprised.” Nat glanced up at the girl, sniffing as she gazed at the biracial teen. “Do you mean that?” Miranda simply smiled, hugging the damphir teen tightly.<br />
<br />
Marisa And Liam had watched carefully, slightly relieved to find that the Desoto twins were accepting of Nat. Still, they were still a bit unsure about Connor and Spark. While Marisa had gotten to know Jacob Moreland and his eldest reasonably well, she hadn’t yet dealt with Connor or Spark. Seeing as the two had tried to stake her daughter through the heart, Marisa already felt it would take awhile to warm up to the two of them.</p>
