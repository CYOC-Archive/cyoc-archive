<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was much that Sammy was curious about how Baby Furs worked. How their &quot;magic,&quot; as he saw it, changed things and shaped who they were. It seemed to make everyone friendly and he felt closer to everyone back in Franky Town. He even felt close to Doctor Sammy and her family. He felt even closer to Jessy, like she was super important to him personally. Though, while the idea of pinkie promises sounded workable to prevent humans who didn&#39;t want to changed but remain friends would work on a one to one basis, a part of him still worried that while baby furs couldn&#39;t directly control how they made new friends, humans would be afraid. He was fine with making new friends, but they should all WANT to be new friends, just has he had.<br />
<br />
&quot;They never took the cam-mer-ruh from him?&quot; Sammy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;How could it show anything?&quot; Jessy added from beside Sammy, &quot;Is it like superman?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it&#39;s just a normal camera,&quot; Oscar answered, though his definition of &quot;normal&quot; was based on baby furs and what was normal for them. &quot;Just keep watching... Right now it&#39;s on his bed, not in his diaper.&quot;<br />
<br />
They watched the television screen as it continued to show a baby fur bear manage to amuse himself in the room. On some level he looked bored, but with the crayons he&#39;d been given by someone, he was managing to amuse himself with drawing pictures. Many of these pictures showed what looked like a crudely drawn baby fur bear walking calmly with an adult woman who was carrying a baby. Though to Sammy&#39;s eyes, the only part of the baby that could really be seen was its head, which was round and pink in color.  <br />
<br />
Though that wasn&#39;t the only drawing. Some were of jungle gyms. Some were of random mundane animals. Some were of baby furs drinking tea in funny looking hats. Sammy was privately amazed by how much this baby fur was able to draw and create. It seemed to battle boredom to a degree, but Sammy knew he wouldn&#39;t like being alone and away from his friends... particularly being away from Jessy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this all that you have?&quot; Sammy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It goes a bit more,&quot; Oscar answered, &quot;keep watching.&quot;<br />
<br />
They kept watching as the baby fur began to write a few jokes on the walls and floor as well. One read: &quot;Where does an ellyfant keep its clothes? In its trunk.&quot; Another read: &quot;Why should bears ware shorts? Beecause then they&#39;d be bear naked.&quot; Sammy chuckled at a couple of them.  He kept watching when there came a clicking noise from the door on the screen. The baby fur bear on the screen stopped his doodling and stood up, giving the group watching the view of the back of his head and his round ears. The door then opened to reveal a middle aged woman in a white lab coat and looking very much like a medical doctor with a younger man dressed as a soldier standing guard over her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Teddy,&quot; the woman spoke, &quot;how are we today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno,&quot; the baby fur bear, identified as Teddy, answered, &quot;How are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman raised an eyebrow. It was like she didn&#39;t expect a baby fur to actually know the exact ins and outs of English grammar. After a few moments she rephrased her question, which actually made the soldier guarding her giggle.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine, Teddy,&quot; the woman spoke, &quot;How are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gud,&quot; Teddy answered, &quot;can I go see my sister now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet,&quot; the woman answered, &quot;We want to work to help you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Teddy shrugged and looked down for a moment. Sammy couldn&#39;t tell what he was looking at, but at the same time, the young soldier that was guarding the woman also looked down as well. His face looked rather curious and perhaps even puzzled over something. Then suddenly the soldier began to chuckle, seemingly without reason. Teddy looked up while the woman standing next to the soldier turned to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is something funny?&quot; she asked him, and Sammy thought she saw the man&#39;s face seemed be growing some gray-brown fur in places.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where does an elephant keep its clothes,&quot; the soldier chuckled as his nose began to push forward slightly and he began to shrink slightly. He continued to laugh, and was completely unaware of what was going on. &quot;In his trunk.&quot;<br />
<br />
Teddy looked on puzzled  and the woman seemed to actually look terrified, but was unable to move. The solider&#39;s jacket seemed to melt as he continued to chuckle at the joke that Teddy and scribbled down. His feet grew longer as his boots melted and as his pants shrank and changed until they were a camouflage colored diaper on the shrinking soldier, and to Sammy&#39;s surprise, the soldier also got progressively younger. His face became rounder, his eyes slightly larger, and then his ears grew long and thin and gray-brown rabbit baby fur holding a pump action water gun stood in the doorway and looking between Teddy and the woman. He also continued to chuckle at the joke that Teddy had written.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dontcha see,&quot; he said the woman with a giggle, &quot;it&#39;s funny.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... no it&#39;s not funny!&quot; the woman declared as her nose suddenly turned very dark, almost as dark as her raven black hair. &quot;It&#39;s silly... childish.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sammy watched as she began to get younger as well. Something that was pushing her shirt forward seemed to shrink down until there was nothing underneath the material. As with the soldier, her eyes grew slightly larger, and her ears began to move toward the top of her head. However, her ears weren&#39;t as long the soldiers, and while his had become rather floppy and hung down, hers stood erect and became covered in tan brown fur. As she began to shrink down as well, she repeated the word &quot;no&quot; several times, though toward the end as her clothing began to melt away, with the exception of her lab coat, she actually began to giggle is well. Her face pushed forward into a modest but pointed muzzle and as her clothing vanished, Sammy noticed that white spots lined the sides of her tan brown fur were visible. After a few moments, a female deer baby fur stood by the rabbit baby fur and aside from her lab coat, which had know shrunk down to fit her new size, she wore a pink colored diaper.<br />
<br />
&quot;I still think it&#39;s funny,&quot; the soldier commented.<br />
<br />
The woman sighed and looked down for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I suppose it is a bit funny,&quot; she admitted after a moment. &quot;You okay, Teddy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Teddy answered slowly, as if puzzled that the two had turned into baby furs.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wanna go somewhere?&quot; the doe baby fur asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanna see my sister,&quot; Teddy answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... let&#39;s go,&quot; the doe baby fur answered, &quot;I&#39;m s&#39;posed to be in charge... and you should be with friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean I can go?&quot; Teddy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, we&#39;ll come with you,&quot; the rabbit baby fur nodded, &quot;Keep you safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... but you&#39;d have to pinkie swear not to laugh around her,&quot; Teddy spoke, referring to his sister.<br />
<br />
Both new baby furs nodded and raised their pinkie fingers in the air. With that, Teddy nodded, turned, collected the camera and stuffed into his diaper. From there the transmission cut out... or ended.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did that happen?&quot; Doctor Sammy asked in surprise, &quot;He didn&#39;t laugh!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno,&quot; Oscar answered, &quot;but that&#39;s why you had to see it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How could they transform with out him laughing?&quot; Sammy and Jessy asked to Doctor Sammy, almost at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno,&quot; Doctor Sammy said, &quot;Maybe what allows us to change things and what allows us to make now friends is connected. So... when Teddy got them to laugh... it affected them and changed them...I can&#39;t say any more than that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there any more?&quot; Jessy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well the three of them do leave the base... but the battery seemed to go dead while they were somewhere outside it,&quot; Oscar answered, &quot;I can&#39;t say for certain where they went... or if they even made it to the sister&#39;s house. The camera could pick up the sound of crickets, so it might have been night time... or if he did make it and uploaded what his camera copied, we didn&#39;t get to see that he had made it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The images shown were surprising and Doctor Sammy looked very curious about the new development. Sammy was curious, himself, and while he wasn&#39;t adverse to making new friends, he feared that this revelation would only make things more difficult for them. It further made him wonder if there was any true way they could control how they made new friends. It was clear that Teddy didn&#39;t know what his drawing combined with the guard laughing at his humor, both spoken and written, would do, as if he did, he wouldn&#39;t have done either. He did pinkie swear, after all. But humans would surely fear baby furs more, simply because this was knew and different from what they already knew and that the pinkie swear, while helpful, wasn&#39;t perfect as the baby fur could break it if they didn&#39;t know they were breaking it.<br />
<br />
In that, Sammy felt he and Jessy had to get to Florida, find the first fur and find out how she came to be. Sammy was certain their condition was magical in nature, as there was too much that couldn&#39;t be fully explained by the science he remembered, even if many of the ways he saw what he remembered was now more through the lens of a toddler. And, if it was magic, there might be a way to make it so that they could control how they made new friends. That way, they could befriend normal humans and they wouldn&#39;t have to worry about becoming baby furs unless they consciously wanted to.</p>
