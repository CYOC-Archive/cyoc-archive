<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The box was much too big for it&#39;s contents...nothing but a pair of red wrestling boots, a pair of red and yellow wrist bands and big red trunks with a golden belt attached to them.<br />
<br />
He took put the things on the floor and looked at them for a while. He knew that other than maybe the wrist bands, he couldnt really wear the other things. The boots were very big, and he would never ever fill the trunks. This looked like the suit of a wrestler, one that liked to go around almost naked like trying to show off his body. Of course he didnt really have a body to show off: he was very skinny and small and couldnt wear something like this in public not even ironically...<br />
<br />
But he wanted to have some fun with the gift, so he actually went ahead and put it on. He closed the door to his room and got completely naked, hating to see his pathetic naked body. He grabbed the wrist bands and put them over his hands and saw that even they were too big for his bony wrists. He shrugged bony shoulders and put the trunks on. It was like a giant tighty whity, only red. It was ridiculous how the leg holes didn&#39;t come even close to fitting his twig thighs and the belt was way loose over his hips so he held it up with his hand. Finally, he slipped his feet onto the size fifteen boots.<br />
<br />
The moment when he strapped the boots, he felt a shockwave that almost knocked him out, like he couldn&#39;t really breath. He noticed that the gear was firmly in place and attached to his skin! He looked at his hands and saw how the bands were setting in place...over larger wrists!<br />
<br />
His hands were bigger and his wrists and forearm were beginning to thicken and grow, veins bulging like they were being pumped with air! His feet were doing the same thing! His ankles and feet were beginning to grow thick until he felt the boots begin to grow tighther. He began to panic because he suddenly knew that he was changing into something else to fit the wrestling clothes and he wasn&#39;t sure what it was.<br />
<br />
It hurt when his bones shifted and became even thicker and longer like to be more resilient to damage. He was beginning to grow very, very tall, almost closing in on the ceiling! The same way his ribcage barreled out and his shoulders became wider, but he actually looked horrible...hugely tall but skinny and lanky, with gigantic hands and feet. He wanted to cry because though he had always wanted to be tall, he looked like a lanky monster and he didn&#39;t like that.<br />
<br />
But then the changes continued. His stomach hurt when the muscles that wrapped his new huge skeleton began to inflate and harden. He first felt it in his legs when his long thighs and calves began to pile on dozens of pounds of rock-hard muscle. His legs grew so ridiculously big they began to stretch the fabric of the trunks, his calves growing almost too thick for the boots. He saw how a giant ass and a new huge cock filled out the trunks until it was tight on him.<br />
<br />
His chest grew much much larger, as did his belly, which showed the makings of a six pack, though it began to be buried beneath a layer of hair that was growing thick over his chest, and shoulders. When his shoulders inflated like rock hard baloons and his neck grew thick, wrapped around gigantic traps that climbed all the way up to almost his ears, he saw that he was transforming into something far larger and stronger than any bodybuilder or powerlifter on earth! His arms grew to the size of his head, forearms like giant hams stretching the wristbands and growing hairier as well.<br />
<br />
When he finally stopped growing bigger, he felt hair growing from his face and making a thick, full beard. Some of his facial features changed to make him appear even more dangerous, and then he saw himself: a giant, terrifying vision of power and strength...someone who could wrestle a bear and even snap its neck.<br />
<br />
He used his giant hands to masturbate many times. Every time his huge cock went flaccid after cumming it would only take a moment of posing in front of a mirror, flexing every gigantic muscle, to get him hard again. He hoped that his secret admirer was a woman, because no matter how many times he jacked off, he still felt horny.<br />
<br />
Now eager to let the world see his massive new body, he prepared to leave and meet her...</p>
