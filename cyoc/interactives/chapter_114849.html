<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After their recent act of coupling; Nate was following Jean downstairs to the kitchen. Growling as he observes Jean carrying a large grocery bag she managed to hide it from his sight and superb lupine sense of smell. Catching the smell of rabbit coming from the bag, Nate couldn’t help but drool as hunger overtook him. Watching Jean purr as she takes out some containers of coleslaw and potato salad; other items she picked up at the grocery store. It didn’t take long for Nate to realize that this was going to be a romantic dinner for two. Coming up behind her as he sneaks his arms round Jean and giving her a generous hug; Nate growls happily as Jean pulls out two large rabbits. The sight of the wild animal makes Nate ravenous as he lets go of Jean and sits at the table, eager to rip and consume the gamey flesh.<br />
<br />
“Now we eat,” Jean smiling as she takeout a bottle of European soda; pouring a couple of glasses and placing them on the table as Nate starts spooning out the potatoes and coleslaw.<br />
“If it wasn’t for the were-alert,” Nate licking his lips; “this would make for a delightful picnic in the forest.”<br />
“Wait until dessert,” Jean displaying a large toothy grin; “you’re going to love it.”<br />
<br />
Nate looks at Jean curious as he tries to figure out what that meant. Watching as she takes one of the rabbits into her paws and biting down on the soft underbelly; her leonine muzzle becoming stained with blood as she deftly separates the flesh from bone. The coppery smell of the blood splattering on the table was enough to put Nate over the edge as he too dove into a rabbit; ripping large chunks of flesh with fur, swallowing the pieces whole. His Muzzle stained crimson as his fur and paws rapidly soak up the blood spilling forth from his delicious meal. Despite the fact that the rabbits were almost as large as some of Martha’s serving plates; it didn’t take long for the were-lioness and werewolf from placing bloody remnants on the table cloth Jean lay down earlier. Cracked bones and a lifeless head staring back at them as they used a fork to shovel mouthfuls of potatoes and coleslaw in them.<br />
<br />
“That was a delicious rabbit Jean,” Nate looking at his mate and feeling satisfied; drinking the soda that was poured earlier; “it makes what I’m going to do to you afterwards that much more enjoyable.”<br />
“If you think the rabbit was delicious wait until after we clean up,” Jean purring; “I have dessert waiting for us back upstairs.”<br />
“What is it,” Nate feeling his desire to claim Jean.<br />
“It’s a surprise,” Jean smiling; “another little item I picked up from It’ll Be Our Secret. One hundred percent edible,” Jean whispering into Nate’s lupine ears; causing him to perk up and whine with excitement. “But first,” Jean looking at the remnants of their quickly devoured dinner; “help me clean up.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
“Are you a full on vegan,” Peter asking Helen; after another round of rutting. With him on top and looking at the tiny were-creature below him; tiny compared to his robust frame. Peter was a were-lion while Helen was a were-rabbit. A were-rabbit that was his doctor until she was struck down with an intense heat cycle; stemming from taking the wrong were-birth control pills and forcing her to be safely contained in a hospital safe room. Peter was present; but only due to the fact that her heat cycle had all the symptoms of an incomplete transformation.<br />
<br />
“No,” Helen looking at a the large were-lion above her; his member in her and the barbs digging into her canal, ensuring the two remain locked together for the time. “Why do you ask?”<br />
“I was just thinking,” Peter looking at Helen; pausing to enjoy watching her pink nose twitch at his musky smell. “While we were-lions can be intimidating to most,” Peter gently massaging one of Helen’s large rabbit ears; “we can be quiet romantic a lot of times. Hunting and providing fresh meat to one’s mate as a gift,” Peter trying to shift and move without harming Helen; “watching said mate eagerly devour the gift and looking at their satisfying face as they lick their muzzle clean.”<br />
“I take it,” Helen unable to stop herself from giggling; “that rabbit is the most often presented gift.”<br />
“It’s easy to devour solo,” Peter looking sheepish; “but now and then a large buck is taken down and both parties make it into a romantic meal with a spirited round of wild rutting afterwards.”<br />
“And I take it,” Helen rolling her eyes; “that the men do this when courting their potential mate?”<br />
“It’s not just a male only thing,” Peter grinning; “a lot of times a were-lioness will do this just to reaffirm her claim on her male.”<br />
<br />
Helen couldn’t help but laugh; not a were-lioness and a hunter, she wasn’t planning on running through the woods trying to bag a buck or any game for that matter.<br />
“The best I could do,” Helen still chuckling; “is order a meatlovers pizza.”<br />
“Well expect some fresh goodies from me now and then,” Peter licking Helen’s cute nose.<br />
“Just not rabbit,” Helen wrapping her arms around Peter and pressing him close to her; “that’s just cannibalism for me.”<br />
“What about a juicy and succulent fish from the river,” Peter kissing Helen.<br />
“With lemon and a bit of dill,” Helen feeling Peter still inside her grow bigger.<br />
“And asparagus and roasted potatoes,” Peter affectionately nibbling on Helens ears.<br />
“Oh yeah,” Helen getting lost in the moment.<br />
<br />
Peter growling as he stops making out with the were-rabbit below him. Pulling out of Helen; eliciting a gasp from Helen’s petite muzzle. Peter was getting hungry with all the rutting he was doing; placing a paw at his wound still healing from Friday evening, he stares at a were-rabbit looking longingly into his eyes; pleading for him to relieve her of the heat she is in.<br />
“Are you hungry,” Peter looking at Helen; “because I am.”<br />
“There is no mini-bar in the safe room,” Helen running her paws up and down her body; trying to pleasure herself in the hopes of getting relief.<br />
“So we are stuck in here without anything to eat until morning,” Peter looking at Helen.<br />
“Hopefully,” Helen placing her paws at her sex and fingering herself; “we might get checked up on by a nurse. But yes; we are stuck here until morning.”<br />
<br />
Peter watches as Helen furiously masturbates; trying to get some relief as the need to mate drives her crazy with lust. Peter all willing and eager to help; can’t help but hesitate that he might harm Helen during their bouts of sex. Being stronger than the female were-rabbit and clearly several feet taller than her; Peter was naturally concerned he might be a little too rough with her and hurt her badly. With no one coming to check on them until morning at the latest; accidently causing Helen serious pain was the last thing he wanted to do to her.<br />
“Helen,” Peter looking at the writhing were-rabbit; “I don’t want to risk harming you.”<br />
“I trust you’ll be gentle,” Helen panting as she rolls over to being on all fours; displaying her wet sex to Peter, begging him to mount her. “Just make me feel relieved.”<br />
<br />
Peter inhales the sweet aroma’s emanating from Helen’s sex. The hormones putting her heat cycle into overdrive, making him eager to fill her with his seed.<br />
“But what if you get pregnant,” Peter allowing his baser instincts guide him; “Tora mentioned that you were taking the wrong were-birth control pills.”<br />
“We’ll cross that bridge if it comes,” Helen sensing Peter about to penetrate her; “right now, just fuck me silly.”<br />
<br />
Peter roars with primal delight as he drives himself deep into Helen’s wet snatch; the feel of be clamped and massaged as he thrusts in and out of her, made the were-lion growl with pleasure. Helen feeling the barbs on Peter’s feline cock dig in her as she is rutted in a pure and primal fashion. Enjoying the feeling of being dominated and bred; Helen squeals and screams as her body shudders violently. Being rocked with an earth shattering orgasm; blinded by the pleasure she was enjoying, Helen did not hear the loud roar coming from Peter. Yet she felt his member quickly twitch and spray her womb with his seed; the warm fluid making her full as she feels her body finally sated at last.<br />
<br />
With both collapsing back onto the bed soaked with their musk and sexual fluids; Helen just melts into Peter’s body as continues to growl and roar. Feeling him slowly come around and embracing her; Helen just smiles as she see her were-rabbit self smiling back at her. Helen couldn’t help but grin as the phantom image of her slowly fades rom view. Despite the orgasm still rocking her body, Helen could tell that her heat was finally quenched. It would only be a matter of time if the injection of an extra strong dose of the were-rabbit birth control Tora Tachibana gave her before closing the door would stem her from getting pregnant.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you Peter Talbot,&quot; Helen blurting out in pure joy.<br />
&quot;I love you as well,&quot; Peter purring as he slowly drifts off to sleep; &quot;Helen... Talbot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Helen sighed as she heard Peter reciprocate his love for her. Lost in her own moment of bliss; Helen over looks that Peter just mentioned Talbot instead of Tompkins. Despite her intense heat cycle; neither Helen or Peter currently realize they just had a were-wedding of their own.</p>
