<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">*Roughly twenty minutes after the church meeting.*<br />
<br />
She woke up from a deep slumber; using her fingers to move the long strands of blonde hair from her eyes as she opens them to the new morning light. Groaning as she shifts her frame to a sitting position on the hay; unaware that she wasn’t alone.<br />
“Fuck,” she muttered quietly; not sure if Epona was still present or not, the centaur mare remembered what happened last night. The transformation from a man into a mare; the chat with Epona. A brief talk with Amanda; a Nonius breed of horse for her lower half.<br />
‘She won’t allow a mare to be forcibly taken when she is not interested,’ were Amanda’s final words to her as she escorted her to the bungalow she just woke up in.<br />
<br />
Scanning the room in the dim morning light; the Nakota mare with a white mane and tail noticed that the pile of hay she slept in. It was comfortable and felt soft; not at all itchy to bare skin. The bare skin in question being her upper torso; examining the scoutmaster shirt she wore, Josephine noticed that most of the buttons popped. Whether they burst from her transformation last night or as she slept made little difference as her breast stood stiff and proud. Normally Jackson would revel at the chance to cup and fondle such beautiful pillows of flesh; the fact that they were her pillows of flesh made her still male mind shiver. She knew without having to twist and look behind that she had an equine half with near pale white fur. An equine half that was unmistakably female; the absence of a sheath standing guard to a furry sack housing testicle pumping out testosterone and seed. No she had the velvety lips of a mare’s vulva, playing gatekeeper to a vaginal canal that once filled with a massive stallion phallus would melt her brain in orgasmic bliss.<br />
<br />
“Double fuck,” Josephine noticing something she knew she was dreading; a pressure building deep within her. Begging for release; the sensation was both familiar and new.<br />
“I have to pee,” the mare shaking her head in disgust at having to relieve herself like a mare. Struggling to get up on unfamiliar legs, she finally notices the presence that was sleeping next to her as well as a powerful musk. The smell muddled her senses; causing a conflict with her mind. The male mind recoiling in horror at the thought of possibly being taken; while the mare instincts were rearing their head, eager to have her body used and filled. With trepidation she turns her torso to see snuggled next to her was a massive centaur stallion snoring softly. A Russian Don she thought as if she knew what species of horse he was. Where the neck and head of the horse should be was a Samoan with a tanned complexion with black hair that was wild and unkempt looking. Her hearts flutter at the sight of this stallion’s equine package that she could glimpse before the centaur’s legs move, hiding a prize she was envious of.<br />
<br />
The struggle within her mind made her neigh in frustration as her bladder once again commanded her attention. Her audible distress was enough to rouse the stallion from his slumber as he slowly rose to sit up and stare at her. Her hearts once again flutter as she see his smile and pale blue eyes.<br />
“Who,” Josephine looking scared; trying to get up but still struggling to get use to her new hooves.<br />
“My master,” the centaur speaking; “called me Rasputin. You can call me Rasp for short if you like,” the stallion effortlessly getting up; offering a hand to help the Nakota mare up as he continues to smile kindly. “When I saw you last night,” The stallion helping Josephine up; “it was as if I was, how the humans would say, struck by cupid’s arrow. And I saw by your expression,” the Stallion staring at the confused mare; “that you were also struck by that same arrow.”<br />
“I think there has been a mistake,” Jackson regaining control of his faculties; “I’m not gay. I’m not into dudes.”<br />
“Neither am I,” Rasp smiling; “I’m into mares. You’re a mare, you look and smell like one;” he adds. “You are a very lovely looking mare,” The stallion grinning; “worthy of bearing many foals.”<br />
<br />
Before Josephine could muster up a pained cry for help; a large knock on the door to the bungalow could be heard. Thankful for the distraction she makes for the door; her tail fanning her pheromones for Rasputin to grin as he feels an urge growing within.<br />
“Oh thank you,” Josephine opening the door; “I’m in here with a mad beast.”<br />
You mean the Russian Don,” Amanda greeting the newest mare to the Haras. “He is not beastly looking nor is he mad, “Amanda seeing the stallion approaching already with his penis out and bobbing as he walks to the door. “You are just getting use to your new body Deputy Jackson,” Amanda noticing the mare’s breasts exposed; “and you need more appropriate attire.”<br />
“I need to pee,” Josephine hoping to change the conversation; “can you please…”<br />
“Show you where to go,” Amanda nodding; “yes, but first a new top. We have foals just waking up and I want them to see we all maintain some modesty.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
After finding and tossing on a simple hand stitched top, Josephine was sighing as she relieved herself in the communal toilets. Just as she raised her tail an intense stream of urine blasts out of her new sex; giving her relief as the pressure subsides. She looks next to her to see Amanda also relieving herself; crinkling her nose as she gets a whiff of the head mare’s stool as it falls to the ground.<br />
“Let me show you how we clean,” Amanda grabbing a nearby sponge attached to a stick. “We use this to clean each other after relieving ourselves. I’ll wipe you and you can wipe me after.”<br />
“You want to touch my privates,” Josephine looking horrified as Amanda gently cleans the urine off of the mare’s entrance and legs.<br />
“It’s not about feeling each other up,” Amada rinsing off the sponge before handing it to Josephine; “it’s about trust. If you can’t trust your fellow herd brother or sister from wiping you down, then how can you trust them to help in raising a barn or harvesting crops.”<br />
“Or help in defending the Haras,” a male voice could be heard. “A good lesson to teach the foals as they wake up,” Chris nodding at the idea of hygiene being a good lesson to teach some energetic yearlings in both anatomy and community cooperation.<br />
<br />
Both turn around to see Chris quietly waiting for the mare’s to finish up.<br />
“Dear,” Amanda speaking as Josephine reluctantly used the sponge to clean up the head mare; “I thought we agreed that I would help Jackson acclimate herself.”<br />
“I’m just waiting for you to finish up so I can poop,” Chris showing some curtesy; “unless you want to wipe me down as well love.”<br />
“No need to stand on ceremony or wait on chivalry,” Amanda answering as Chris takes a spot on the other side and loosens his bowels. She turned to Josephine, “go get some breakfast and then see Fred at the smithy. He will have some shoes ready for your new hooves.”<br />
“Afterwards,” Chris accepting Amanda’s offer to clean him off; “you are helping Marcus to shovel shit. Afterwards, you’re free to explore the town, or if you are in need of a distraction you can help us fence in a pasture for the cattle we found yesterday.”<br />
“I just might take you up on that,” Josephine shuddering as the Russian Don who slept with her arrived at the community washroom and promptly sprayed the ground with a stream of urine. His musk once again invading her sense of smell and scrambling her brain with a desire to be mounted, plowed and thoroughly bred.<br />
“You two trot off,” Chris grabbing the sponge; “I’ll help out our newest herd brother.”</p>
