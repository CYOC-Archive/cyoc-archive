<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A couple of minutes later Bill&#39;s fiance now wearing his body entered the room. &#39;There you are Clover. Oh hi Clare. How&#39;s little Jack going?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I didn&#39;t know breast feeding would be so pleasurable. Clare had told me it felt good but this is amazing!&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;It&#39;s something I&#39;ve never had the pleasure of doing yet... but once we are married&#39; The new Bill looked across at the real Bill wearing Clover&#39;s body. &#39;I&#39;m hoping we don&#39;t take too long to start a family&#39;<br />
<br />
Bill realised her female body was reacting to the presence of her former body. She had an urge to cuddle the new &quot;Bill&quot;. Her thoughts were interrupted when the new Bill addressed her.<br />
<br />
&#39;Well Clover just about everybody has headed back to their own rooms to swap suitcases. Are you ready to call it a night?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;You called me Clover&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Yes because that&#39;s who you are for the next week. Everyone will be calling you Clover. You need to get used to answering to your name. Anyway we should call it a night. You will have an early start tomorrow. I know you are on breakfast duty&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;What does that entail?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;As a female you are expected to help out with the cooking for one meal every two days. There is a roster on the noticeboard in the hallway. Be in the kitchen at 6 am and someone will give you a job&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;That&#39;s sexist&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Yep, welcome to the world of womanhood. It will make you appreciate me I hope&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I already appreciate you&#39; Bill found her self cuddling her old body. Clover was so big and strong. To Bill Clover was still Clover. She had trouble thinking of her fiance as &quot;Bill&quot;<br />
 <br />
&#39;Get a room you two&#39; chipped in &quot;Clare&quot; who had been witness to this conversation. &#39;I think Jack&#39;s had enough. I&#39;ll see you in the morning&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Good night Clare&#39; said &quot;Bill&quot; as he led the new &quot;Clover&quot; out of the room.<br />
<br />
The dining room was mostly deserted. Several women were setting the tables for breakfast, it looked like they were almost finished. Bill felt compelled to ask &#39;Do you need a hand?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;No Clover. Thanks for the offer but everything is under control&#39; <br />
<br />
Bill recognised the woman as the cousin who Clover&#39;s Pop had become. She could not recall this woman&#39;s name.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t until the real Clover said &#39;Goodnight Chantelle&#39; that Bill was reminded of the young woman&#39;s name. It was hard to believe this spritely and rather attractive young woman was really Clover&#39;s 92 year old grandfather&#39; <br />
<br />
It was a slow journey back to their room. The corridors of the cabin were filled with people exchanging suitcases. People were collecting the clothes they would be wearing for the next week. Everyone seemed to want to say &#39;Goodnight Clover, did you enjoy your surprise?&#39; Clover explained that the only reason she had unpacked earlier was that she knew what changes were coming their way. <br />
<br />
When they finally got back to their own room Bill spent several minutes examining her reflection. It was hard to believe that she was now in possession of this beautiful body. She was now an attractive young woman. She touched her face and watched as the girl in the mirror touched her dainty fingers to her face. Surely this was some sort of dream.<br />
<br />
Clover had left her alone and had headed to the nearest bathroom. They shared two bathrooms with the other residents of their wing. No doubt Clover was enjoying a pee while standing up. Bill realised for the next week that was some thing she would not be doing. She would be sitting on the toilet.  <br />
<br />
Bill took a moment to inspect the wardrobe and the clothes Clover had unpacked on their arrival. As Bill she hadn&#39;t paid attention to what Clover had packed but now these were going to be her clothes for the next week. She first looked at the outfits Clover had hung up. There was a selection of dresses in an assortment of colours and designs, no trousers or jeans. She then opened the drawers. Inside was an assortment of underwear and sleep wear. Everything was very feminine. Bill couldn&#39;t even find a pair of shorts. Even the footwear was girly. The least feminine thing Bill could find was Clovers pink running shoes. The other shoes were either heeled boots, sandals and one pair of stilettos. <br />
<br />
Clover returned while Bill was holding the heels. &#39;Yes Clover. They are for the New Year&#39;s Eve party&#39; The man in the room said.<br />
<br />
&#39;Did you pack anything that is maybe just a little bit unisex? I haven&#39;t found any jeans&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I packed knowing it would be you wearing these outfits. No jeans. Just outfits that will show off your sexy body. I want you to remember the experience&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Thanks&#39; Bill tried to imply sarcasm.<br />
<br />
&#39;My pleasure Honey&#39; said Clover apparently not picking up on the sarcasm. &quot;Honey&quot; was a nickname Bill often called his fiance. &#39;I would recommend getting to the bathroom quickly before everyone else unpacks. The bathrooms get busy at bedtime. Take the vanity bag. Don&#39;t forget to brush your teeth and remember to sit down to pee then wipe afterwards&#39; He handed Bill what was Clover&#39;s vanity bag.<br />
<br />
Bill could fell she had a full bladder so didn&#39;t protest, took the bag and headed to the nearest bathroom. She entered and locked the door behind herself. There for the first time she peeled down her panties and sat down on the toilet seat. It took a minute to figure out how to work her new plumbing. She had to relax her muscles rather than squeeze as she was used to. Once the flow finally started it came out in a gush. She did remember to wipe before pulling her panties back up.<br />
<br />
She then took her time once more examining Clovers face in the mirror and practised making faces. She now had Clover&#39;s pearly white teeth that the real Clover was so proud of and the lovely smile that had so captivated Bill when he had first met this girl. She found a toothbrush and toothpaste in the vanity bag and brushed while she examined the contents of the bag. Besides an assortment of shampoo&#39;s and conditioners it also contained what to Bill appeared to be a huge array of make-up along with deodorant and perfume. When Bill came across a pack of sanitary pads she quickly closed the lid. She didn&#39;t want to think about having to use those.<br />
<br />
She was interrupted by a knock on the door. &#39;Are you finished in there? I&#39;m in a hurry&#39; It was a woman. Bill quickly gathered her belongings and left. There were two women waiting outside. Bill recognised Rose and tried to recall who was in Rose&#39;s body. She couldn&#39;t recall and called the woman the name of the person she now was. &#39;Sorry Rose, I forgot that people might be waiting&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;It&#39;s fine Clover. I can recall my first time changing as well. It&#39;s quite an experience isn&#39;t it?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Yeah, It sure is&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Well I&#39;m in a hurry, We&#39;ll have plenty of time to share experiences in the morning. I&#39;m on kitchen duty with you. Goodnight&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Goodnight&#39; Bill recognised the other woman waiting. It was One of Clover&#39;s many aunts. She couldn&#39;t remember the woman&#39;s name nor who she really was. She could recall that this person had been on the same table as Bill and Clover.<br />
<br />
&#39;Hi Clover. I&#39;m your Aunt Cynthia for the next week. I won&#39;t tell you who I used to be. You hadn&#39;t met me anyway. I&#39;ll just say that I am now my own sister in law. Enjoy your week and welcome to the family&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Um Thanks... Aunt Cynthia&#39; .......&#39;Goodnight&#39; Bill hurried back to her room.<br />
<br />
Inside she found Clover now dressed in Bill&#39;s pyjamas flexing his muscles in front of the mirror. &quot;All done?&#39; he asked. &quot;I&#39;m ready for bed. Are you going to join me?&#39;<br />
<br />
Bill hoped that Clover had not noticed the way Bill&#39;s new female body had reacted to seeing Clover in sleepwear. Could her fiance detect that her nipples were totally erect? And why was she feeling moist down below? She tried to act calmer than she felt. &#39;I suppose I should have an early night if I have to be in the kitchen by 6&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;You have a choice of two nightgowns in the second drawer&#39; Clover said matter of factly. Bill didn&#39;t realise what a sexy voice he used to possess.<br />
<br />
She could recall looking in the drawers earlier and knew her choice was of two rather sexy garments. Her only real choice was colour, bright red or sky blue. Bill recalled that the two nightgowns appeared to be new purchases. She would have recalled if Clover had ever worn such sexy garments.<br />
<br />
She realised Clover was standing there waiting for her to make her choice. Pretending to be composed she opened the drawer and selected the blue nightie. It was satin or silk and had lace trim on its bodice. Bill realised Clover was just watching her. &#39;Are you just going to stand there or are you going to allow a girl to get changed?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I thought your might need help to get out of your dress&#39;<br />
<br />
Bill blushed. Clover was probably right. She had certainly needed help to get dressed. &#39;You can unzip me but then get into bed and let me change myself&#39;</p>
