<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Jellybeans with cabbage and tripe. Licorice with snails and worms?”<br />
Edward looking at some of the pizza recipes the cubs wanted to make thanks to getting hyped up at making mini pizzas. All the bizarre and vile tasting combos came from the latest children cartoon. A cartoon featuring the adventures of a unicorn and her grumpy ostrich friend, as they explore the amazing world of Befuddledonia. While Edward did not care for the show; he endured several hours watching it with Adam, while the cougar cub would dance and sing along.<br />
<br />
“Do you really want a pizza with,” Edward looking at the list Adam and Julian printed off of the internet; “pigs feet, lawn clippings and boogers? Julian,” Edward putting the list down; “isn’t this show supposed to be cub friendly? What is with the disgusting food?”<br />
“It’s from an episode,” Jullian shaking her head in bemusement; “if you look at the bottom, you will see that it is a gag and that the pizzas eaten were mushroom and bacon; as well as chicken chunks and peppers.”<br />
“Well,” Edward looking at the end and seeing the two; “a bit more reasonable, but what kind of peppers?”<br />
“If I were you,” Julian taking out a bell pepper and placing it on the counter; “nothing stronger than this.”<br />
<br />
Edward smirks as he watches the cubs giggle as he puts down the paper; watching as Julian helps to spoon the sauce on the ready rolled pie doughs. Quickly slicing up the pepper; Edward grabs a couple more, a yellow and red to go with the green Julian pulled out earlier. The chicken chunks were pre-cooked chicken breast strips meant for salads or sandwiches. Watching as both Roxy and Adam grab some peppers; he tries to stop then from flinging them on the pizza, but is too late as multi-colored pepper land in a chaotic fashion. Having to wipe away drops of pizza sauce, Edward shakes his vulpine head as the cubs giggle while grabbing the chicken.<br />
<br />
His grand cub Jimmy J.R was making the mushroom and bacon. Choosing the diced Portobello with diced white mushrooms; Even Edward was liking this pizza more than Adam and Roxie’s; the bacon making him lick his lips as he saw the cub dump the pork product on the pie. Julian then came forward with the grated mozzarella and started to sprinkle in on the pizza; making sure a spread was on the mini pizzas.<br />
“Now to bake in the oven,” Julian putting the pies in; closing the door as the two male cougar cubs and lone female tigress cub look on eagerly. “This large one is ours,” Julian looking at her mate; watching him nod in return as he begins to clean up the mess.<br />
“Chicken, spinach and cauliflower,” Edward answering as he puts the unused pizza toppings back into the fridge for a quick salad tomorrow; “with mushrooms on half.”<br />
<br />
*********<br />
<br />
Twenty minutes later, the pies come out of the oven and a thunderous stampede of paws could be felt through the floor as the cubs rush into the kitchen; their noses twitching as the smell of freshly baked pizza fills the air.<br />
“They are hot,” Edward stopping Adam from grabbing his; “let the cool. Julian can you fetch the plates while I deal with the ninja paws.”<br />
“Ha,” Julian laughs as she watches her mate do his best to keep the hungry cubs at bay; quickly getting the plates she places them in front of the three, while Edward gets the pizza cutter and slices the pies into four slices each. “They should be cool enough now,” Julian placing the pizzas on the plates; watching as the three quickly take the plates and rush back to the living room.<br />
“They’re watching that cartoon aren’t they,” Edward shaking his head; “it can’t be that popular.”<br />
“It is,” Julian grabbing two more plates as Edward slices their larger pie; taking two slices, one with the mushrooms before sitting on a stool on the island; “when Denise was in New York last month, she noticed Radio City Music Hall advertising a live performance.”<br />
<br />
Edward shakes his head as he rips into a slice; his sharp vulpine teeth mashing the meat and veggies before he swallows and repeats with his second bite. Listening as Julian explain how this show exploded like earlier kid friendly shows prior to the furry flu pandemic of 2023.<br />
“You remember the one you would watch religiously,” Edward grabbing a third slice; pausing to listen to the raucous noise coming from the living room.<br />
“They are fine,” Julian picking up on her mate’s concern; “and it was Smurfs. I loved watching that every Saturday morning,” Julian feeling nostalgic as she looks at Edward; “you think that is on the streaming service?”<br />
“You want to binge watch with cubs don’t you,” Edward thinking of watching a show that wouldn’t drive him mental; an old cartoon from the 1980’s would do. “If it isn’t available; would you settle for one of my favorites?”<br />
“And what would that be,” Julian feeling full from her pizza slices; “some action show that was designed to shill toys?”<br />
“I preferred Mr. Wizard’s World,” Edward smiling; “and The Hilarious House of Frightenstein.”<br />
“Well that came out of left field,” the anthro cougar smirking; “but these cubs need a little action in their show. How about some retro cartoon movies?”<br />
<br />
After Edward and Julian discuss possible shows to watch with Adam, Jimmy J.R and Roxy; they settled on a few old dinosaur cartoon movies after Adam saw an old short lived show about a Dinosaur family living in a modern world. His parents groaning as that show was a bit low brow to put on settled on a few movies geared more for his age.<br />
“Lots of choices here,” Edward settling on one made in the late eighties; “if you three are still up after this one is over, we’ll put on the second one.”<br />
“How many did they make for this series,” Julian coming back from the kitchen with a drink in her paw.<br />
“I’m seeing six so far,” Edward scanning the menu; noticing a few were high up the numeric value; “but I wager there is at least ten.”<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
They were halfway through the second movie when the cubs began to fall asleep. Noticing Roxy the first to yawn, followed by Jimmy J.R and Adam; Julian slowly lowered the volume as Edward quickly headed upstairs to prepare extra pillow and a light sheet for comfort. Heading back downstairs, Edwards gently picks up Jimmy J.R, while Julian already has Roxy in her fury arms. The two quickly take the cubs upstairs and lay them on the floor of Adam’s room. Heading back to the living room, Edward collects his son while Julian turns off the t.v and picks up Roxy’s unicorn plushie. Placing his son next to the other two sleeping cubs, while Julian places the unicorn next to Roxy; they place the bed sheet over the three as the y turn off the light and close the door.<br />
<br />
Retreating to the master bedroom, Julian immediately starts to feel flushed with desire as she sees her vulpine mate’s rapidly thicken shaft as it grows from its sheath. Licking her lips as she slinks towards her mate and the hard rod he was sporting; her tail twitching as she feels her thighs do damp from her juices. Edward growled with lust as he knew what his mate wanted after a long day with cubs.<br />
<br />
Edward extends a hand paw to his mate as he guides her to the bed. He watches as Julian gets on all fours; her tail off to the side as he gets a good view of her fury feline entrance. It wasn’t long before he jumped on the bed and was already mounting her; his tapered vulpine shaft spreading her entrance and pushing deep inside her sensitive tunnel. He slowly exhales his hot breath next to her ear; getting a deep shiver from Julian as she instinctively shifts herself; allowing him to push deeper and his knot pressing upon her swollen lips. Hearing her moan as his bulbous mass of flesh pushes its way inside her; locking the two together as his thrusts go from slow and deep to fast and shallow.<br />
<br />
“Did you *huh* put up *gasp*,” Julian panting as she feels her release building; “the sound *ooooh*proof bubble?”<br />
“Don’t worry,” Edward growling as he fights back his release; wanting to work on his stamina in preparation for another sex lottery. “They won’t *arrrr* hear us,” Edward pounding becoming more furious; his furry balls swinging wildly as they slap Julian’s crotch. The sensation causing his sack to clench and his release to shoot through him like a runaway freight train. He instinctively bites down on Julian’s neck just as he make ne final thrust and presses himself close to her body. The spasms coming from his hard dick caused Julian to yowl in pleasure as she herself feels her own orgasm coursing through her. <br />
<br />
She collapses on the bed; dragging her still tied mate along with her as he still pumps his seed in her. She sighs as she wasn’t in heat at the moment; know this rutting act would have bread her, the subsequent couplings, ensuring a successful breeding. While she has pondered wanting another cub; Julian decided to wait until Adam was a few more years older before having that discussion with Edward. For now, she just enjoyed the bestial act as she came down from her orgasm and shifted herself on her side; forcing Edward to follow suit as he spooned her.<br />
“You’re still pumping in me,” Julian muttering as she starts rumbling a satisfying purr; like house cats, cougars and cheetahs are capable of purring, a talent Julian discovered she had after many enjoyable nights with Edward.<br />
“Yeah,” Edward wrapping himself closer to his anthro cougar mate; gently cupping her fury breasts as he lazily massages her stiff nipples, getting rewarded with a satisfied moan from Julian.<br />
“I wonder how that party at Proudhoof’s is going,” Julian starting to nod off; “you think a sex orgy has erupted?”<br />
“hmmmmm,” Edward weakly mumbles as he rests his head to Julian’s; his chin resting on her shoulder as he happily drifts off.</p>
