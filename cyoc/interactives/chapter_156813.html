<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The other maids continue with their gossip as Geri and Arden continue cleaning, using dusting techniques neither them thought they knew. Geri is feeling increasingly concerned with how they might stand out on account of not joining in with the typical maid gossip tree. He hoped the Prince was okay, it is hard to check up in his royal charge currently without looking suspicious.<br />
<br />
Arden meanwhile is quite enjoying himself seeing what life is like for the common maid, a very fascinating subject of examination indeed. He brushes his hair back down his neck, not noticing how long it has gotten as he worked. Looking at the gossiping maids he feels somewhat left out, and even he is wise enough to be aware standing out is not a good idea when in disguise, he wouldn’t want his adventure to be over now would here.<br />
<br />
He lets out a very girlish giggle at the latest piece of gossip and places his hand on his hip as he poses in a distinctly feminine manner “I heard the princess’s suitors are so numerous that her handmaidens do nothing but reply to love letters for her” this causes the a chorus of giggles, even from Geri who feels the urge to join in, causing him to almost blush in embarrassment before stopping himself so to not stand out.<br />
<br />
Arden briefly wonders where he heard that. He does not exactly keep up with the princes’s... his sister’s love life. Although he suppose he must’ve heard it off hand due to living in the same castle as her, he probably just dismissed it at the time and only now is it relevant for him.<br />
<br />
Arden continues cleaning, stretching out his hands to reach an oddly high cupboard. He doesn’t remember his cupboards being as big as this. As he reaches up his  arms stretch and become even more slender as any fat they had is pushed back into his chest to slightly add onto the growing pair of modest breasts he is begging to sport.<br />
<br />
Geri meanwhile is bending down to dust under a table, his legs shifting as he does as what  muscle he  may have once had began slowly redistributing into his thighs and behind, not too noticeable but it does add a very womanly figure to his lower body.<br />
<br />
He briefly glances over to Arden to notice that his breasts seemed pronounced, he doesn’t think they were that sizeable before.<br />
<br />
‘Arianna’s bust is so much more appealing to men than mine..’ Geri thinks with a tint of jealously as his internal voice takes on the girly voice he has been speaking with, before blinking in confusion ‘wait... what did I just think....’ however his thoughts are interrupted by the fact that the other maids, Arden included, are staring at him.<br />
<br />
He realises that he is the only one to have joined in on the gossip and quickly comes up with something in a panicked attempt to not stand out, causing him to lose his previous train of thought.<br />
<br />
“I heard the princess has been seeing some in secret, according to the washers, they see her sneaking out and about” while Geri was nervous at first the moment he became speaking his soft girly voice seemed to gain a life of his own and produce a rumour without even having to think.<br />
<br />
He momentarily is concerned he has unwittingly slandered the princess by making something up, but then a memory of hearing that very same rumour from the washers surfaces in his mind. He isn’t sure when it happened and it isn’t exactly the most reliable source to base claims on royalty on, however this memory nonetheless washes away his concerns.<br />
<br />
Afterwards all maids continue their duties while gossiping endless, both Geri and Arden finding no difficulty in keeping up, as if they have been doing this for ages. Geri himself has to admit that despite his eariler concerns on Arianna’s... Arden’s plans, he was really getting into this gossip, something about it seemed so inticing about this, addictive even,<br />
<br />
As he worked, Geri let out an increasingly more common series of cute giggles as he begins leading the trail of gossip. Someone managing work and gossip came natural to him. He played with his curly red hair and wondered how he didn’t realise he had allowed it to grow so far, although it doesn’t overly concern him right now, in fact he even thinks this style his cute.<br />
<br />
‘I really should Geri Arian... uh I mean Arden to try it so time’ he thinksas he looks at the prince’s straight hair which has grown beyond shoulder length. He finds the sight odd, he is pretty sure that the prince’s hair isn’t that long and he doesn’t think the prince found a wig anywhere. However another thought of gossip pops through his mind causing him to  drop his concerns over hair for now in order to relay it to the girls.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Arden smiles merrily at the fact Geri seems to have gotten over his concerns on this brilliant plan.<br />
<br />
‘Good to see Geri has seen this is a great opportunity for new experiences’ he noted smugly in his mind as he cleans one of the last shelves of his massive room ‘What was Gertrude so concerned about eariler anyway, she gossips all the time’ the prince suddenly stops as he realises the oddity of his mind and begins to go back over that  last mental comment.<br />
<br />
However as he ponders the strangeness of it, Geri suddenly causes him to giggle at a very scandalous and embarrassing rumour about the Duke. <br />
<br />
‘What was I thinking about again? How well can’t be that important, me and Gertu... Geri better finish helping get things in order for this Duke. Such a fascinating experience’ he returns to working.<br />
<br />
Both ‘Arianna’ and ‘Gertrude’ continue with ease, briskly walking across and room and going about their duties in an undoubtedly womanly manner.</p>
