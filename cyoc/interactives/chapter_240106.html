<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I wish for a new young dad!&quot; Mike said. <br />
<br />
&quot;A new young dad?&quot; Taylor repeated back. He vaguely remembered Mike&#39;s original father. He seemed nice by all appearances, but then he left his family for another woman five years ago.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seems like a waste of a wish--you&#39;ve gone this long without one, why wish for a replacement now?&quot; asked Taylor.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s something I&#39;ve wanted for a long time... ever since I stopped wanting my old Dad back when I realized how sad he made my Mom. I want a new young dad, not just for me, but for my Mom as well. Someone who can do all the Dad stuff with me, but also make my Mom happy again... what I wouldn&#39;t give to see her smile and have it reach her eyes again, like it used to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy cow... Mike... that&#39;s deep.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well I&#39;ve had a long time to think about it.&quot; Mike said as he typed in the wish and hit enter. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder what he&#39;ll be like!&quot; Mike wondered aloud. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, first the app has to work,&quot; countered Taylor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, right!&quot; Mike said as he watched the timer count down from ten and hit zero. <br />
<br />
The words, &quot;Your Wish has been Granted!!&quot; appeared. They waited for a few minutes, but nothing happened. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I guess that&#39;s that,&quot; Taylor exclaimed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, man! I really wanted it to work!&quot; Mike shouted as he went to close and delete the app. But when he did, his phone glowed bright. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah!&quot; &quot;Woah!&quot; Mike dropped the phone as the light faded away. <br />
<br />
&quot;What was that about?&quot; Taylor wondered. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. Maybe... umm...&quot; Taylor watched Mike stare at him strangely. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wro... Huh?!&quot; Taylor stared to say as he eye level started to move upwards.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mike!&quot; Taylor cried out as he started to lift up into the air. &quot;Taylor!&quot; Mike called back as he tried to pull Taylor down and was unable to. He let go when he felt his feet leave the ground too. &quot;Mike?! Mike!&quot; Taylor kept moving upwards until he was about five feet above the floor. He flailed around until he felt his body stiffen. His arms laid across his sides as his toes pointed towards the floor. &quot;What the hell?! I can&#39;t... ugh... move!!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Taylor?&quot; Mike questioned as he started to see something more unbelievable than his best friend floating. The looser bits of clothing were starting to fill out and his face was getting a little more angular as well. <br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; Taylor shouted as he noticed Mike staring at him funny. <br />
<br />
&quot;Holy cow! Dude, I think your getting bigger!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&quot;m what?!&quot; Taylor looked down and saw his clothing was getting tighter around his body. He could feel his feet being smushed in his socks. They then stared to tear and eventually his feet burst out of his socks. &quot;What the hell?!&quot; Taylor exclaimed as he wiggled his toes; toes that were getting bigger. Hair started growing on them as the rest of his feet fattened up. &quot;Mike!&quot; Taylor cried. <br />
<br />
Mike could only watch in a mix of horror and awe as his best friend was getting bigger. He took his eyes of his feet to see the rest of his body was getting bigger too. His face no longer looked like a twelve year old boy, but a fourteen year old teenager. <br />
<br />
&quot;No way! Taylor! You&#39;re not getting bigger, you&#39;re getting older!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?! No way! I don&#39;t wanna be older! Make it stop!&quot; Taylor cried out, but his pleas fell on deaf ears as he felt the rest of his clothes tighten around his body. Eventually they also started to tear. <br />
<br />
First his shirt ripped apart from the front, both sides fell to the floor. Mike watched as his chest grew older. His pectoral muscles were shaping up and getting bigger, and harder. His stomach area rolled as eight square slabs of meat formed abdominal muscles. Then his pants were the next to go. They ripped from the bottom to the top. The waist was just holding on. Mike could see his undies fill in, Taylor&#39;s ball sacks were squeezing out and showing more pubic hair. His waist then gave way and Mike could tell his underwear wasn&#39;t for much longer. A bulge formed bigger in them as Taylor&#39;s penis was growing. Hair was forming on his growing leg and arm muscles and his chest as well. A thin path of hair from said chest was snaking down his stomach and connecting to his crotch. Soon enough the elastic in his underwear gave way and Taylor&#39;s cock and balls burst out into the open air, no longer that of a young boy, but one of a teenager in the throes of puberty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy crap!&quot; Mike exclaimed. <br />
<br />
&quot;My wiener!&quot; Taylor shouted. His voice was much deeper now, which made talk of his &quot;wiener&quot; sound sillier. Said &quot;wiener&quot; was pulsing up and down as it rode out erect. It stood out pointing at Mike&#39;s direction at a good ten inches long. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your dick is huge, man!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I can see that dude! Ah!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Taylor?&quot; Mike watched Taylor wince as he crunched his toes together. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah! Ah! Mike! Watch out! I&#39;m... Gahhhhhhh!&quot; But before Taylor could explain further, his dick shook and then shot out a white liquid right onto Mike&#39;s face. <br />
<br />
&quot;Agh! Gross!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Mike! Oh god! Mikey!!!&quot; Mike could only stand there flailing as Taylor&#39;s ejaculate got all over him. A few seconds passed until Taylor stopped cumming. &quot;Oh god! You okay?!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh! No! Taylor, what the hell man?!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t help it! It just happened!&quot; the former twelve year old now looking eighteen said as the patchy hairs started to appear above his lip. He continued to get a little bigger as he hit his twenties. He was still in the air, so Mike and Taylor assumed he was still growing older.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we&#39;ll deal with that later I guess! How are you feeling beside... THAT?!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I feel so weird, man. I did not expect THIS today.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s my wish, isn&#39;t it? You&#39;re gonna be my new dad soon.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like it. Man, I&#39;m gonna be a dad! Well a least I look like a total stud! Burp! Oops! Excuse me!&quot; &quot;That was quite the burp, man!&quot; Mike said. &quot;Maybe that means your almost done growing?&quot; &quot;Maybe. How old do you think I... Burp! Oops again! Burp!&quot; Taylor started to burp every so often, while his mustache came in nice and thick. <br />
<br />
&quot;You okay, man?&quot; Mike asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Burp! I... I think... Burp! Jesus! Burp! Ugh!&quot; Taylor said as he started to squirm again. &quot;Taylor?!&quot; &quot;Ohhh... Mike... I don&#39;t feel so good... My stomach...&quot; Mike watched as his friend&#39;s stomach started rolling, His abdominal muscles were starting to fade as his stomach started to jut out a little bit, giving Taylor a muscle gut or the early beginnings of a beer belly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mike!&quot; Taylor shouted as he notice the changes to his own body. &quot;What&#39;s happening to me?!!&quot; &quot;Umm...&quot; was all Mike could say. More body hair was spreading throughout his body and started to show a few signs of a receding hairline and greying at his temples. &quot;Gahh! My head, hurts!&quot; winced Taylor as he clutched his temples.<br />
<br />
A few moments latter, Taylor started to move back down. Wind started swirling from out of nowhere and wrapped Taylor ripped clothes around him. Mike could no longer see him as the wind formed a visible twister around his friend. The twister touched the ground and dissipated in seconds, leaving his friend turned young father back on the floor in new clothes. He wore a simple wife beater that just barely covered his small beginner&#39;s beer belly. Over top of it was a Hawaiian t-shirt with the buttons left unbuttoned, and a pair of glasses hanging from the front left breast pocket. Taylor&#39;s pants had turned into a pair of bermuda shorts, worn rather high with a thick belt which at least looked like it fit snug around his waist, cock and balls. No socks were there anymore, instead flip flops adorned Taylor&#39;s large hairy feet. <br />
<br />
Taylor was in a bit of a daze, but soon snapped out of it. He looked at Mike for a few moments then back to his body. He lifted the neck of his shirt to see the massive changes to his body below. He then looked back to Mike with horror in his eyes at what he had become. Mike fidgeted awkwardly as he said the only thing he could think of. &quot;Hi... Dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
At first the thirty-four year old Taylor seemed confused until he put his left hand to his temple, put on his glasses, and then blinked a few times.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Mikey... how&#39;s it hanging?&quot; asked the man whom Mike could now no longer see as his friend Taylor, but instead his new Dad. Mike assured his new Dad that everything was good, and they decided to spend the afternoon watching a football game and bonding over the plays. Soon, Mom was home from the shopping trip she&#39;d been on and stood leaning against the archway entrance to the living room her two &quot;boys&quot; were in. <br />
<br />
Anna had long been waiting for something like this ever since she and Taylor had met and married a few years ago--where she could just come home and see the two most important men in her life bonding and at ease with each other&#39;s company. It was honestly the sexiest thing about Taylor in her mind--his at ease and go-with-the-flow nature that allowed her to loosen up just a little bit. She idly wished that she had met Taylor first.</p>
