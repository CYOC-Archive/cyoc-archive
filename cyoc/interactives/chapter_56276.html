<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty casually walked through the park until something caught his eye. It was a few members of the zoo's staff shooting two almost-fighting lions with tranquilizers. It all happened so fast, and within a blink, all Ty saw was the smaller (but still huge) lion being dragged off into a metal warehouse. Ty was curious as to what happened, so he asked one of the staff members who was involved in the who fiasco.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that all about?&quot; Ty queried, pointing towards the lion exhibit. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, well, Leon didn't take too kindly to Leo. So we had to give them both light tranqs so we could safely get Leo out of there. He's probably going to be sent to a tamer or something. Either that or put him down, since he's domesticated and doesn't get along with other lions. It's a shame, he's a real sweetheart too. It's like he should've been born a dog or something.&quot; The woman replied, letting out a depressed sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leon and Leo... That's what they named the lions? Couldn't they have been more, you know, creative?&quot; Ty mused, trying to suppress a goofy grin so he didn't offend the woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it's better than our very own Tiger the triger. The owner isn't good with names. Anyway, I have to get back to work. Enjoy your stay!&quot; The woman said, trying not to sound dismayed. As she walked off, Ty could hear her mutter something like &quot;That poor, poor animal...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty couldn't help but feel sorry for Leo as well. Ty wished he was invisible and was inside the warehouse so he could get a better look at what was going on. Once in the warehouse, he saw some men discussing what to do with Leo. As the woman expected, he was going to be put down since it would be difficult to relocate him and expensive to take care of him. Shortly after Ty arrived, the men began leaving and locked up the warehouse. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, let's save a gigantic kitty!&quot; Ty said to himself as he made himself visible. Ty walked up to the cage and sure enough, Leo did look like a little sweetheart - it could be sene in his big ol' amber eyes. That's probably why the other alpha-wanabee lions pick on him. Surprisingly enough, there weren't any scars on him at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, now how do I get you out of here? If I take you home with magic, people will still freak out since you're a lion... And I can't call for help since it's not illegal... I think.&quot; Ty said aloud. &quot;Wait, that's it! If you don't do well as a lion, maybe you'll do better as a person.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty opened the cage, allowing Leo to stagger out into the open. The lion sat down in front of Ty, seemingly unable to support it's own weight due to being groggy. Right there and then, Ty wished for Leo the lion to become Leo the human with the ability to talk like a human.<br />
<br />
Leo's eyes shot wide as the magic took effect. The first thing that happened was his hair began receding. His mane shrunk down to nothing, and his tail just disappeared all together. Leo shot up in a frenzy, causing him to chase his own behind as if he were a dog trying to get his tail. He was obviously confused and frightened about what was happening. Leo then fell flat, unable to move due to his four legs now morphing into a pair of humanoid arms and legs. His lionesque body seemed to condense until it resembled a large, strong man's body. The last thing to transform was his manhood, which was also now that of a human - albeit, more on the above average side.<br />
<br />
There laid Leo the human, 6'4&quot; tall, weighing at least 300 pounds of solid muscle. His suave, sandy blonde hair had much volume, resembling a small mane of sorts. His body was covered in a lavish thin layer of golden hair, though he wasn't overly hairy. As for his face, it had a thin layer of golden stubble. However, he still had some unusual traits such as large, sharp canine teeth and amber-colored eyes. Ty thought Leo made an impressive and handsome human, to say the least.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Leo?&quot; Ty cautiously said as he approached the ex-lion.<br />
<br />
Leo looked up for a minute, before letting out a strange roar.  &quot;WHAT YOU DO?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... I only made him able to understand what talking is... But I guess he only knows words he heard from his trainers...&quot; Ty said to himself before turning his attention back to Leo. &quot;I made you into a human since they were going to kill you. I kind of saved you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Leo then grabbed a hold of Ty as if he were going to crush him, but then stopped short after he realized he no longer had paws, but some strange bendy-things. He flexed his hand a few times, then proceeded to grab Ty again before letting out a few unexpected giggles. Leo picked Ty up and put him down with ease, which made him giggle even more. He seemed to be fascinated by the new body he was in. Things bulged out of places - otherwise known as muscles flexing, he had weird paws - called hands, he was cold - due to being naked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What these?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hands. You can grab things with them, Leo.&quot; Ty replied, grabbing Leo's massive hand and giving it a hardy shake. &quot;See? My name is Ty, got it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Leo like.&quot; He said shaking Ty's hand back, though with a lot more force than Ty expected. &quot;Leo like Ty!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that's good. So Leo, do you need anything?<br />
<br />
&quot;Hrrrrng, Leo cold!&quot; He complained, wrapping his new limbs around his broad body in attempts to keep warm. Ty fixed Leo's problem by giving him a set of sweats and comfy socks with roomy sneakers to wear. Now Leo was tugging at his new clothes, the idea of him being human suddenly sinking in even after Ty told him. &quot;Leo want be lion...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can't, they'd kill you and you can't be anywhere normally as a lion... I'm sorry. I'll help you out though, Leo, don't worry.&quot; Ty said in attempts to comfort Leo. &quot;Now let's do something fun to cheer you up, okay?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Leo responded by nodding as he pouted. He really had no idea what was going on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, let's slip out of here and get a-going!&quot;</p>
