<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Donnovan takes the box inside and sets it down on the table. &quot;Might as well make sure it&#39;s right,&quot; he said as he pulled out a knife to open it up. If they screwed up the order earlier, it was possible for it to happen again. However, as he dug through the packing peanuts all he found was a shirt that had four big letters on it, &#39;DILF.&#39; <br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck is this?!&quot; he held it up in the air and then against his own body. &quot;This is too big for me, let alone Jackson. How could they have possibly mixed this up!?&quot; His next step was to go to his phone. If they had this bad of shipping then how was he supposed to ever get what he wanted. He quickly dialed up the number. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, thank you for calling AeAeA. This is Michelle speaking. How may I help you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hi,&quot; Donovan said, not expecting the phone to be picked up so quickly. &quot;I&#39;m calling because I received the wrong order.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh dear,&quot; Michelle responded. &quot;Is the product defective?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... No. It&#39;s not what I ordered. I received a shirt in the mail, but I&#39;d ordered something different.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is the shirt not comfortable? Or are you allergic to the material it&#39;s made out of?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Donovan absentmindedly ran the material through his hands. It&#39;s soft and flexible. &quot;It feels fine...&quot; Then stops. &quot;But that&#39;s not the problem! I didn&#39;t order this!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh dear!&quot; Michelle exclaimed. &quot;There&#39;s no need for yelling sir. We will more than happily return it. However, we won&#39;t be able to send anyone to pick it up until tomorrow morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s fine,&quot; Donovan answered. &quot;So what do I have to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Simply put the product back in the box and place it outside of your house. One of our employees will be by to pick it up tomorrow morning,&quot; Michelle said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s really convenient. Thank you,&quot; Donovan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not a problem. Have a nice night,&quot; Michelle said and then hung up the phone.<br />
<br />
Donovan took a second as he looked over the shirt. He knew it should just go back into the box, but the material just felt so comfortable. Shaking his head, he headed over to a mirror. &quot;Probably would make a good night shirt...&quot; Donnovan mumbled to himself. &quot;Maybe I don&#39;t need to return it...&quot; Running his fingers against the material, he couldn&#39;t help but feel how nice it felt. The more he touched it the more he wanted to wear it.<br />
<br />
Finally, he gave into the desire and stripped off his own shirt and put this one on. &quot;Woah... This is comfy...&quot; Donovan muttered. He twisted and turned showing it off to himself. With his hefty belly on full display, he couldn&#39;t help but feel as though being called a DILF was a bit of a strange concept. He&#39;d always heard of MILF and figured there had to be an equivalent for men, but never really thought about it before. But since the divorce he&#39;d pretty much given up on any kind of standard of modern handsomeness he might have been able to obtain.<br />
<br />
&quot;It does feel nice though...&quot; Donovan&#39;s mind was rapidly trying to reason with himself. The more he wore it the better it felt. Almost like it was calling out to him. He scratched at his hairy belly, not noticing the unkempt mess of hair was slowly starting to trim itself. Nor did he notice it ever so slightly shrink. Instead, he was distracted by his face. The beard he&#39;d only ever trimmed when it was becoming completely unwieldly, seemed to have change a little bit. Any of the white hairs that had been slowly growing in looked as though they had been dyed black. And for some reason it almost looked like it&#39;d been trimmed perfectly to accentuate a strong and masculine jawline. <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh??&quot; he leaned in closer to the mirror running his hand through it. To his surprise the second chin he&#39;d been using his beard to hide was no longer there. Instead, he could feel the bone rather than an excess amount of skin or fat. &quot;What the--?!&quot; he backed away. This time getting the full view of his body again. &quot;What the hell&#39;s going on?!&quot; Looking over himself, he wouldn&#39;t have even recognized his body. No longer was it the overweight and pudgy form of himself, but something far larger and stronger. Even as he looked at his body, he could almost feel his bones lengthening and growing thicker. Donovan had to take a step back to keep himself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is crazy...&quot; he said in disbelief. Donovan went back to posing. This time feeling more natural to the sensation. It was like his body craved the positive attention he was giving himself. &quot;Wait until the guys see this,&quot; he bragged as he held up his bicep, giving it a firm slap. The sound reverberated off his walls. &quot;There&#39;s no way they&#39;ll believe it. I&#39;m so big...&quot; he gave himself a smile. &quot;And handsome. Could be in one of those superhero movies! Damn!&quot; <br />
<br />
The more Donovan complimented himself, the more he started to feel up his body. Hard muscles lined every bit of him. Two thick pecs pushed at the shirt he was wearing, while 6 solid abs were hidden directly underneath. The fat in his arms had completely dissolved and turned into hard defined muscle making him lose none of the size but only add the strength. He couldn&#39;t believe how wide his shoulders looked in the navy-blue shirt or how much more of a strong presence he gave off even to himself. <br />
<br />
His hands slowly rolled over each and every part of him. Slowly going down over his legs. A devious smirk filled his face as he thought about what else could make up a DILF. Donovan quickly undid his pants and let them drop around his large feet. He kicked them off and then turned to the side. &quot;DAMN!&quot; he smiled as he saw the rod pointing out of him. A solid hard 10 inches sprung from his waist. &quot;No fucking way!&quot; one of Donovan&#39;s hands started massaging it. &quot;So... Big...&quot; he moaned as he touched it. And it felt nearly twice as sensitive as it had before. &quot;Fuck...&quot;<br />
<br />
Donovan made his way over to the couch and plopped down onto it. His feet kicked up onto the coffee table giving him a more relaxed position. Donovan continued to pleasure himself as he felt over his body. He couldn&#39;t believe how good it felt to feel these hard muscles. This his hand touching his body slowly started to move somewhere he didn&#39;t expect. First it started out as a small itch in his asshole. He subconsciously gave it a scratch. But it didn&#39;t go away. He scratched again. A wave of pleasure rocketed through his dick. However, Donovan held on. He bit at his lower lip. <br />
<br />
But the itch was still there.<br />
<br />
Naturally he dug a little deeper, opening up his asshole. The sudden intrusion was better than he&#39;d ever expected. &quot;OOO!&quot; he grunted as he unloaded onto his furry abs and chest. Load after load sprayed onto him, coating his fur. Donovan lets out a deep and long breath as he continues to play with his insides. &quot;Woah...&quot; he smiles. It&#39;d been nearly 2 decades since he&#39;d felt something that good. But then he realized where his finger was. &quot;SHIT!&quot; quickly pulling it back out. He bit at his lower lip. &quot;The fuck was I doing?! The fuck&#39;s going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
Donovan stands up and notices that he&#39;s still wearing the DILF shirt. His body is practically molded to it. And it looks good. Almost exactly like a dad he&#39;d like to fuck.</p>
