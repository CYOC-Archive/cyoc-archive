<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">One of Ty's friends, Zachary, sat next to him in History class. And <br />
wasn't it such a coincidence that the teacher was about to discuss <br />
Greek Mythology in class today. When zach got out his notebook, he had <br />
the word &quot;Zeus&quot; printed on the cover.<br />
<br />
&quot;Zeus?&quot; Ty asked him. &quot;Who's that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that...&quot; Zach chuckled. &quot;That's what they call me at home. It's <br />
my nickname...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty just smiled. Zach had always been nice to him. Ty decided he was <br />
going to be nice to him as well, and give him the same thing he had <br />
given Elias.<br />
<br />
&quot;Zeus, huh? I'll make you into Zeus... a little later...&quot; Ty thought. <br />
&quot;When I make you have a craving for chocolate...&quot;<br />
<br />
After History class was over, a handful of students remained in the <br />
classroom for homeroom. They just worked on their homework assignments <br />
and they caught up on any missed class work. Zach and Ty were also in <br />
the class, along with just six other students. All the other chairs <br />
were empty.<br />
<br />
Ty just turned towards Zach and silently wished for any changes he'd <br />
make, not to be noticed by anyone else but him and Zach. Just then, <br />
Zach turned and faced Ty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I wanna get a Snickers Bar out of the candy machine. Want one?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhm... Sure... But, I don't have any money on me...&quot; Ty replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;No sweat, dude... I got you covered!&quot; Zach replied.<br />
<br />
Zach got up and walked outside of the classroom and down the hall. <br />
Since it was homeroom, they were allowed to leave, as long as they <br />
came back within five minutes.<br />
<br />
As soon as Zach reached the cafeteria, he had to open the door, since <br />
the doors to the cafeteria were already closed, but they weren't <br />
locked. The vending machines were located inside of the large <br />
cafeteria. Zach felt a little spooked, being the only person in the <br />
large, abandoned cafeteria, but he knew he was safe and nothing would <br />
happen to him. He had been bullied in the past, but since it was the <br />
final period of the day, nobody would bother him inside of the <br />
abandoned cafeteria.<br />
<br />
The moment Zach approached the candy machine, he was overcome by an <br />
intense tingling sensation in every muscle throughout his body! Every <br />
muscle then tensed up, as they rapidly inflated!<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhhhhhhhnnnnn!!!!&quot; Zach squealed, as he leaned against the side of <br />
the machine, while struggling to maintain his balance. His legs were <br />
exploding with muscle, while his pecs and his arms were bursing with <br />
raw power. His skinny arms were transforming into pythons of muscle, <br />
as mighty biceps ripped out of the sleeves of his shirt, and triceps <br />
bulged out the back of his arms. His pectorals screamed to life, as <br />
they inflated like fresh bread in the oven at a bakery, pushing out of <br />
his flat chest. His shoulders were pushing outward and sideways, <br />
struggling to make room for all his new, inflated muscles, while his <br />
entire bone structure was rapidly being reshaped at the same time. <br />
Zach's skeletoral structure was being transformed, to allow for <br />
hundreds of pounds of muscle to be added instantly. This boy was going <br />
to get BIG!<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhh.... What.... What the hell... is... going ON???&quot; Zach gasped, <br />
as he looked down at his rapidly changing body. He couldn't believe <br />
what was happening to him. His muscles were growing like MAD! Was he <br />
dreaming???<br />
<br />
His quads and calves practically burst out of his shorts and socks <br />
with outrageous muscle and power. Zack played soccer for the high <br />
school team, so the feeling of having so much muscle in his legs was <br />
just unbelievable! <br />
<br />
Zach's moaned out loud as his quads and calves practically tripled in <br />
size and weight, since they exploded with amazing muscle following the <br />
amazing growth spurt. His calves inflated like large balloons until <br />
they were the size of soccer balls and his quads became as thick and <br />
as wide as steel columns of a building, vibrating with muscle. His <br />
flat stomach transformed into a sea of thick, hard abdominals. Truly, <br />
Zach was now bursing with muscle all over!<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh... I... Wow...&quot; he panted, while trying to catch his breath as he <br />
was leaning against the machine. He was sweating all over, but luckily <br />
his clothes magically adjusted to fit his much expanded body.<br />
<br />
He quickly purchased two chocolate bars, and cautiously walked back to <br />
the classroom. As he opened the classroom door, he almost ripped the <br />
door knob out of the door, due to his amazing strength. <br />
<br />
Nobody mentioned anything when he sat down in his chair, except Ty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Made it back, huh, Zeus?&quot; Ty chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... Hey... Ty... Do...D-d-do I look different to y-you?&quot; the big <br />
muscle boy stuttered nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look even cuter and better and bigger than before, big guy!&quot; Ty <br />
grinned. &quot;Thanks for the chocolate!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But... But... My muscles!&quot; Zach continued. &quot;I wasn't big like this!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So? You look great! Shoot... I wish you added a few pounds more!&quot; Ty <br />
blurted out.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Zach was hit by another surge of power, and his arms grew <br />
even thicker! His chest expanded a little, and his quads widened <br />
another inch!<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohmygosh! I had another growth spurt!&quot; Zach exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chill out, big guy! You're not done growing, yet...&quot; Ty laughed.<br />
<br />
Ty figured that a giant like Elias needed an equally large and <br />
muscular boy friend, so zach still had some catching up to do...</p>
