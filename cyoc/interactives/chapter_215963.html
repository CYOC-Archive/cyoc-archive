<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With nothing else to do, Nick gazed out at the dining room and watched the party he was missing. He always had a penchant for eavesdropping, and as he watched the room, he started to pick up on two very odd trends.<br />
<br />
The most startling was that people <i>recognized</i> him. Or rather, they recognized Sir Silver’s armor. The way they talked about it though wasn’t in awe of some new party decoration. They discussed him like he, that is to say the rusty suit of armor, had always been a part of the dining room.<br />
<br />
A few minutes into his imprisonment someone walked over and stuck a bottle opener into one of his gloves. It wasn’t long before someone placed a bucket for discarded bottle caps appeared between his legs. Nick spent the better part of an hour hearing people refer to the bottle opener that “Silver” was holding. Everyone already seemed to know the intricate scoring system involved with some game that consisted primarily of rebounding bottle caps off his chest.<br />
<br />
Eventually though Brad walked in and scolded the group. “Hey! Stop fooling around with Sir Silver!” He snatched the bottle opener out of Nick’s hand. “Do you want to get haunted? Cuz this is how you get haunted.”<br />
<br />
Everyone groaned at the reprimand, but Brad remained adamant about it. “I’m serious! Sir Silver’s haunted decades of TFU alum! Victor swears he’s seen him roaming the halls at night!”<br />
<br />
Decades!? Nick didn’t like hearing himself talked about as a fixture of frat life when he was still literally fixed to the floor. Before he could fret about that too much however, he started noticing the other odd trend.<br />
<br />
Early on in the party, someone ran by Nick dressed in goat pants. He vaguely recalled seeing someone with the same outfit at The Second Skin and hadn’t thought much of it at the time. He’d already seen a few weird costumes that night. A while later however, Nick started to notice that people were beginning to look… scruffy? It was a weird thing to pick up on, but everyone was starting to look like they really needed a good haircut.<br />
<br />
He didn’t really start paying attention to it until Dave walked into the dining room. Nick glared at his room mate, hoping he would recognize him. Unfortunately he seemed just as nonplused at the large suit of armor as everyone else. If only he could get his eyes to glow again and get his room mate’s attention… As Nick continued to glare however, he noticed something unusual about Dave.<br />
<br />
The two had just driven in Dave’s truck together, and Nick knew for a fact Dave had shaved today. He was wearing his cosplay ninja jacket from last year, and Nick was sure there wasn’t any fake hair involved with it. Yet somehow his room mate had a significant amount of stubble on his chin.<br />
<br />
Dave took a sip of his drink, and Nick was able to watch in real time as the stubble shifted into a full on wispy goatee. Scanning the room, Nick realize Dave wasn’t the only one sporting a new beard.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t uniform though. It mostly seemed to be- Huh. The guys holding solo cups? The party was in full swing at this point, and the frat’s usual beers were slowly starting to be traded out for cups of punch. Someone must have made a good batch this year. Hair raising to say the least.<br />
<br />
Hey, he was stuck here. Least he could do was come up with the occasional pun.<br />
<br />
About ten minutes after the dining room filled with punch drinkers, one of them… bleated? It sounded like it came from an honest to goodness goat. Nick wished he could turn his head for a better look, but he quickly realized there were plenty of people to watch.<br />
<br />
Everyone in the room had started to grow horns. They were just little nubs at first, but were growing out at an alarming rate. Dave and Brad were standing close to Nick, and he had a clear view as two short white horns poked out of Dave’s hair. Brad on the other hand took a big swig of punch, and his new black horns started to curl out impressively behind his head.<br />
<br />
Okay, this was seriously weird. Did someone spike their drinks? People just didn’t spontaneously grow ram horns. They didn’t turn into haunted suits of armor either, so Nick mostly just had to roll with what he was seeing. He was living in a world with spontaneous goatings now apparently.<br />
<br />
These frat boys weren’t just scruffy anymore, they were becoming downright hairy. Maybe furry would be the better word? He had noticed a few people sporting positively gnarly side burns, and a lot of them were beginning to grow fur out on the back of their ears. Their very pointy ears.<br />
<br />
It was about that time that everyone stopped being able to tolerate their clothes. Dave let out a flustered bleat, “Is it just me or is it getting hot in here?”<br />
<br />
Dave started to tug off his orange jacket. He scratched awkwardly at his shirt for a moment before deciding to take it off too. Nick would be all the money in his (probably no longer existent) wallet that Dave’s chest wasn’t that hairy yesterday.<br />
<br />
“Oh, did we hit the clothes optional part of the party?” Brad grinned. He started to unbutton his shirt. He went one step further and began to kick off his shoes.<br />
<br />
Brad wasn’t being subtle about it. He was frantic to get his shoes off and Nick got the strangest impression that they didn’t fit anymore. Sure enough, with one last firm kick of his leg Brad sent a shoe and sock flying.<br />
<br />
Underneath it was a glossy cloven hoof.<br />
<br />
“Woah! Nice hoof bro!” Dave stared with a huge grin on his face.<br />
<br />
Brad causes a small ruckus of clopping as he wiggled out of his remaining shoe. Nick stared, watching the two of them react to all this remarkably calmly.<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah?” Brad grinned, “Well let’s see yours then!” He pushed Dave back up against a table and held up one of his legs. Dave put up little resistance as Brad pulled on his shoe. Sure enough, with one last tug on his sock, Brad was able to reveal a shiny black hoof where Dave’s foot should have been.<br />
<br />
“Woah, I’ve got ‘em too?” Dave bleated excitedly. He proceeded to hold up his other leg for Brad to take his remaining shoe off.<br />
<br />
Brad didn’t need any further coaxing. He easily freed Dave’s other hoof from its shoe prison. He didn’t stop there however. Brad kept pawing at Dave’s clothes, doing his best to pull them off. He yanked at Dave’s pants, revealing a shocking amount of unkempt fur underneath.<br />
<br />
Dave was up on the table at this point with Brad holding both his legs spread apart in the air. They were absolutely covered in… that had to be fur, right? The two were rubbing up against each other, gyrating back and forth. A short scruffy tail poked up out of Brad’s pants, easily pushing them down to the floor.<br />
<br />
“Man, you look amazing…” Brad grinned, tugging off Dave’s boxers. He tossed them over his shoulder, barely missing Nick.<br />
<br />
“You look fucking hot!” Dave bleated in return. He tried to reach down to tug off Brad’s boxers, but his arms couldn’t reach in his current splayed position.<br />
<br />
“You let me handle everything.” Brad grinned as he pushed his boxers to the floor.<br />
<br />
Dave was still leaning up and reaching for Brad, so he chose that moment to slide forward and wrap his arms around Dave. The two kissed passionately as their bodies rubbed together.<br />
<br />
Both of the figures were completely naked now. They had goat legs from the waist down with large scruffy sheaths resting between their legs. They were both clearly worked up and it wasn’t before long that both their sheaths were revealing the tip of a thick goat cock.<br />
<br />
Their words devolved into bleats as Brad pinned Dave against the table. Brad’s cock found its mark, and the two began humping back and forth with one another. The scene of transformation Nick had been watching quickly devolved into an orgy of fucking.<br />
<br />
The good knight meanwhile was still stuck in place. His vision was fixed on the dining room, and he couldn’t turn his gaze. After watching a few moments of pure gay lust play out, Nick realized he couldn’t even close his eyes. He simply had to stand there and watch as at least three different groups of goat men went at it.<br />
<br />
Brad and Dave finally both climaxed. Brad filled Dave’s goaty ass with his seed, and Dave just made a general mess of his chest and the table. Brad set Dave down, and the two laid splayed out on the tabletop.<br />
<br />
“That was… incredible….” Brad panted.<br />
<br />
Dave licked some seed off his lips, “Mhmm, I’ll say.” He wagged his sticky tail eagerly. “I get to be on top next time.”<br />
<br />
“Next time?” Brad started to tickle Dave, playfully brushing his goat ears, “You want to go again already?”<br />
<br />
“Maybe?” Dave teased his sheath. “Man, this is a fucking awesome party.”<br />
<br />
“You’re telling me,” Brad wagged.<br />
<br />
The scene was playing out across the room. Everyone was taking it in stride. They seemed…<br />
<br />
Nick had a while to think about the right word.<br />
<br />
They were mesmerized.<br />
<br />
It was clear whatever they were feeling was downright euphoric. It wasn’t until Brad and Dave started going at it on the dining room table that Nick realized what he was looking at. These were satyrs. Like out of a Shakespeare play.<br />
<br />
Very few of them were freaking out. A couple were taking notice of their changes, but in a, “Check this out!” sort of way. They’d start changing, ahem, find an outlet, and then be… fine with it. They were all treating it like a cool party trick.<br />
<br />
Brad finally helped Dave off the table. He nuzzled one of his ram horns up against Dave’s shorter pointy horns, “You make a really hot satyr? You know that?”<br />
<br />
Dave’s ears twitched sheepishly, “Takes one to know one.”<br />
<br />
They even knew they were satyrs! This one one bizarre thing after another tonight.<br />
<br />
Naturally not everyone had partaken in whatever the hell was in that punch. Nick’s classmate Frank walked in with a beer and hand and stared at the scene in front of him.<br />
<br />
“What the hell happened here!?” He gazed around the room in disbelief.<br />
<br />
Dave held up a wine glass that he had gotten from… somewhere? “Baah! We decided to truly embrace Greek life!” He beamed.<br />
<br />
Brad clopped over, “Here, let me show you.” He gave the human a passionate kiss and dragged him over to one of the tables. Nick got to stand and watch as Frank quickly joined the ranks of the goat men. It seems that punch wasn’t the only way to make a new satyr.<br />
<br />
This scene repeated itself a few times in front of Nick. The armor was sure that the whole house would be satyrs by the end of the night, but surprisingly enough there were a few holdouts. Zach has always been open about his asexuality with his friends, and he seemed to just be enjoying the unusual costume party. He wasn’t the only one either. There was still the occasional stray human here and there. Maybe Nick had more ace friends than he realized? Then again, judging from their wobbly posture, they may have just been too drunk to fuck.<br />
<br />
After what felt like a few hours, (Nick wasn’t lucky enough to be placed with a view of a clock), the frat house seemed just like any other party again. Well, almost any normal party. At some point a centaur walked in front of Nick, and later on an orc started an arm wrestling contest on one of the far tables. Fuck it, sure, why not.<br />
<br />
Nick kept scanning the room for new satyrs, but the party seemed to have hit an equilibrium. He gazed around, trying to see if there were any remaining humans in the room that he may have missed.<br />
<br />
Instead, Nick noticed the dining room’s wood trim for the first time. When had the goat motif crept into the house itself…?<br />
<br />
Nick’s gaze fell back on the mirror across the room. It was shifting and becoming a bit more ornate as the minutes past. More distressing however was what was in it.<br />
<br />
Sir Silver’s position by the door had become much more codified. Nick suddenly found himself standing on a short podium. There was a metal bar rising out of it, and he realized he could vaguely feel it holding up his chest plate.<br />
<br />
Err. His back. Man, this was way too freaky. Hopefully the party would wrap up soon. He could see the changes to the room continue to ripple out over time. Nick <i>really</i> wasn’t enjoying watching his frame’s supports grow out and attach to his arms in real time. They looked suspiciously like the stand he had found the armor on back at The Second Skin.<br />
<br />
Before he could dwell on it for too long, a gaggle of satyrs walked out of the kitchen. They were all sipping wine and discussing the considerable crowd that was gathering outside of the frat house. This party had apparently turned into quite the rager. The frat satyrs eventually drew straws to see who would have to go outside and check IDs. Dave managed to draw the short straw.<br />
<br />
“Baah, man, do I have to?” He pouted.<br />
<br />
“Come on, it’s only for an hour. Then we’ll send someone else out.” A frat boy turned satyr tugged on Dave’s horn.<br />
<br />
“Fiiiiiiiiine.” Dave finished off his wine glass, leaving it on the table.<br />
<br />
“Hey, at least you got the watch the pledge initiation earlier,” his friend bleated.<br />
<br />
As the group broke up, a pair of satyrs walked over towards Nick and completely filled his vision. “Bah, Sir Silver, Snack Guardian Extraordinaire, we thank you for these nibbles we are about to receive and present you with this humble offering.”<br />
<br />
They gave a mocking bow and held up a bowl of popcorn. One of the satyrs lifted his visor and tossed a few kernels inside his helmet. Nick suddenly realized how distressingly hollow he felt. He could feel the popcorn bounce around inside him and finally settle into the base of his boots. The two laughed and head back into the party.<br />
<br />
When Nick could see the room again, a familiar wizard was standing by the kitchen door. Nick didn’t have to put wizard in air quotes anymore. If ever there were an evening that could convince him magic were real, it was tonight.<br />
<br />
What was he doing here? Nick realized he didn’t care. He just <i>really</i> wanted to get his attention. Oh man, what if he didn’t recognize him either?<br />
<br />
Merlin chatted with one of the miraculously still-human pledges for what felt like a small eternity. Finally though, the wizard waved the human off and walked directly up to Sir Silver’s display.<br />
<br />
“How you holding up there Nick?” He grinned, tapping on Nick’s chest plate.</p>
