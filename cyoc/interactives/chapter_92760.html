<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As a million thoughts raced through Ty&#39;s young mind he found himself focusing on the alteration of reality so that Dustin had always been small and undeveloped. Out of all the things that could have frightened the 15 year old that felt the ickiest, as if some sixth sense was telling him it was wrong. With a simple will of his power, Ty wished that everything save for himself and his new abilities would return to normal.<br />
<br />
With a start, the door flew open and Dustin emerged in a bath towel soaking wet. He was his normal athletic size and height, and his usual ignorant demeanour. &quot;Hey twerp!&quot; He said viciously. &quot;If you&#39;re done jerking off in here, dad wants you to go clean the fucking yard up. You missed breakfast too, so too bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a solemn nod of his head, trying not to smirk as he pictured how small and helpless Dustin had been, Ty slipped down to the front yard without being noticed. At just four and a half feet tall that wasn&#39;t hard. Ty knew they were watching him, and he knew all three would be leaving the house for the Saturday, so he prattled on with pulling the weeds and mowing like he always did, sweating at the work made harder by his weak and scrawny body. Eventually, with Dustin kicking mud at him and laughing, the three of his tormentors left. Mark to the bar to watch the game with his buddies. June to go do the shopping and fool around with a coworker in secret. Dustin had gone for his ritual wandering around town.<br />
<br />
Now alone, Ty took a break from his work. He willed the weeds to shrink away forever, which they did in moments, and looked around to see if anybody had noticed. Nobody had, their suburban home was typical and forgettable on the street and besides the rattle of a lawnmower a few houses down, it was typically dead. Breathing a sigh of relief, Ty wondered some more about his current issues. If he could change anything, did that mean himself too?<br />
<br />
Beginning to push the heavy old mower (Mark had insisted Ty use the non-powered device to build character) Ty willed himself to get strong enough to push it. Sighing heavily, he began to cut the grass, exerting his lean and weak body against the mower and the grass. Slowly, halfway down the first stretch of yard, he noticed his arms and legs felt less strained. Looking over himself in disbelief, his skinny arms had a bit more shape to them, though hardly much.<br />
<br />
He continued, finding it easier and easier to push the mower, and stopped in shock to find he was completely building muscle over his entire body. His scrawny legs now had firm definition, his flaccid arms now had small biceps when he flexed, and his chest and abs were even more pronounced. Watching in amazement, barely feeling anything at all, he watched himself steadily but slowly build physique, and felt hot excitement rush over his once typically nerdy form.<br />
<br />
Now endowed with confidence, Ty practically ran the mower around the yard, now feeling himself getting heavier and bulkier with strength as his clothing began to pull tighter and tighter around him. When his waistband began to pull painfully and his shirt was stretched over handsome pecs, Ty gulped and stopped his strengthening, not wanting to get overly big. He quickly finished the lawn, raking the trimmings with ease, and even though he could have simply willed it, the euphoric feeling of being powerful and confident in his abilities was a huge satisfaction.<br />
<br />
After cleaning up, slapping the wet grass off his hands, Ty went into the house and found himself staring in awe at his toned and athletic body. He was certainly defined and masculine, with runner&#39;s legs and a proud broad chest. He smiled at his pathetically tight shorts and shirt, and decided that while he liked himself big this way, it would be very noticible if suddenly the little nerdy kid had blown up overnight. He reduced himself to a firm but still strengthened version of his former self and felt relief as his strained clothes loosened again.<br />
<br />
Most importantly, Ty looked at himself in amazement as it sunk in that he had really done that. His power was real and wonderful. What would have taken him hours to do normally was only twenty minutes to do. That made him smile wider, and he found himself wondering what it would be like to go around town on a warm Saturday with godlike powers. He washed up, relishing a warm shower, and got dressed. But he didn&#39;t like his clothes, which were nerdy and consisting of too much plaid, so he changed them into typical cargo pants and a loose band t-shirt. Satisfied, he headed out. He had to be incognito after all.</p>
