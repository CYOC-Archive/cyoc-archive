<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kat smiled seeing Dan holding one of her breasts like she had been groping it, and her udder like she had been playing with her tears. &quot;How’s my cow doing? Still in love with yourself I see,&quot; Kat giggled in a teasing way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kaaaat, you know how sensitive I am around my ladies, why did you bring me into your bathroom again? You know your mom and dad don’t like me in the house on the account of my...... ‘accidents&#39; you know....&quot; Dan replied<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Dan do you have to make an &#39;accident&#39; now? The flower beds could use some extra compost,&quot; Kat replied and Dan tilted her head,&quot;Dan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What’s that?&quot; Kat asked smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who’s Dan? Is he like your boyfriend or something?&quot; Dan asked <br />
<br />
Kat blushed slightly and giggled,&quot;Oh you must’ve misheard me Dalia, you know I like to just call you Dal sometimes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh....&quot; Dan.... or Dalia paused then nodded,&quot;Your magic thing is really cool and I’m so glad I can talk to you now, Happy Birthday by the way! I’m sorry.... I couldn’t get you a gift....&quot; Dalia blushed and looked down a bit ashamed.<br />
<br />
&quot;It’s fine, you’re my gift this year, I get to show you to all of my friends remember? Do you need to well... take a shit outside? We can do that really quick beforehand if you want.&quot; Kat said and Dalia paused,&quot;Beforehand? What are we doing? Wait! I get to show up to your party?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh huh, and I want both of us to get nice and clean beforehand, and I know how dirty you get when you need to lay down a few pies,&quot; Kat replied making Dalia blush and sigh,&quot;F-Fair enough, and better safe than sorry I suppose,&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat nodded and turned on the water in the bathtub then snapped her fingers, teleporting Dalia and Kat outside. Dalia then looked around and squatted over in the corner of the yard watching Kat grab the garden hose before Dalia let out a fart before dropping a few large cow pies onto the ground. Dalia sniffed the air a bit and sighed,&quot;I hate how much I smell after I do that,&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat smiled and walked over with the hose,&quot;It’s alright girl, just bend over for me and I’ll rinse you off before we go upstairs and scrub each other down.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Dalia said before bending over and showing Kat her large fat cow ass, and as soon as the water hit her rear Dalia blushed and thought,&quot;God everytime you do that I picture myself out in the fields about to be taken by the most muscular bull~!&quot; The water then turned off and Kat gave Dalia’s ass a nice hard smack, making the cow jump and moo loudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;K-Kat! What was that for?&quot; Dalia asked rubbing her flank after it jiggled and Kat giggled,&quot;I heard everything about the bull, remember I can hear your thoughts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;O-Oh... h-heh,&quot; Dalia blushed awkwardly then Kat snapped her fingers and the two appeared back in the bathroom. Kat soon started to strip down after she turned off the water in the tub, and slowly got on into the bathtub.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Kat, why do humans wear clothes?&quot; Dalia asked and Kat shrugged,&quot;Because we get punished harshly if we don’t and because they keep us warm, you have fur and are fine without clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Dalia said then shrugged and got on in with Kat,&quot;You humans are weird but I like you, you’re so sweet!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat smiled then grabbed a bar of soap and said,&quot;Turn around and let me wash you, we only have an hour before my friends all start showing up girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heheh, sorry Kat,&quot; Dalia said then turned around, letting Kat wash her back and leaning against the wall so Kat could get her asscheeks really well,&quot;Mmmm~ You’re so good at washing me~&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That’s why I’m your favorite right? You hate being messy, but as a cow you can’t help it because you need milked every so often and your Crap smells worse than most.&quot; Kat exclaimed and Dalia replied,&quot;I know... I’m a big cow slob aren’t I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? No! You’re adorable, now turn around so I can wash your front,&quot; Kat replied and as Dalia turned around she paused,&quot;I’m cute? Stop trying to flatter me, and careful with my udder and breasts, they just got milked an hour ago remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah yeah,&quot; Kat laughed before she started washing Dalia&#39;s breasts, and Dalia bit her lip and blushed heavily as Kat did this before she mooed out loudly and started panting before Kat moved onto her face. <br />
<br />
&quot;Kat... what are your friends going to do with me? I can’t talk to them like I can with you,&quot; Dalia replied and Kat laughed,&quot;You’ll see, we’ll milk you once for sure, and I’ll show off how much of a person you are rather than an animal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;R-Right... sadly I won’t be able to come inside to see most of your big day,&quot; Dalia replied<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about? I’m having it in your stable sweetheart,&quot; Kat laughed and Dalia perked up,&quot;Stable? Wait I actually have one?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it’s better than the basement guest room,&quot; Kat laughed,&quot;Think if it as my gift to you,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?! Oh my gosh I could kiss you!!&quot; Dalia clapped her hands a happily and Kat laughed nervously,&quot;P-Please don’t... also it’s your turn to wash me.&quot; Kat handed Dalia the soap and leaned against the wall for her, and Dalia smiled and started washing Kat’s body, back and waist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kat why do you keep this body locked up under clothes? How are you going to attract a mate if you keep all of this hidden?!&quot; Dalia asked and Kat blushed,&quot;It’s not like that with humans Dal, but I appreciate the compliments, but honestly your ass and breasts are bigger than mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you kidding?&quot; Dalia asked before gently grabbing Kat’s ass and rubbing it,&quot;You’re curvy, and that’s what males like, and your breasts are pretty large I think. You could attract someone easily, compared to me you’re like a shining star of beauty and I’m just a rock.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Th-Thanks, but you’re cute too, and some guys prefer girls like you over girls like me,&quot; Kat laughed as Dalia finished up and turned around,&quot;You’re like an older sister to me Dalia, and I love you for being you, even if you are a bit dummy thicc with boobs that could make a bimbo blush, you’re my best friend and my favorite cow. You’re definitely the smartest cow I’ve known, as well as caring, come on and finish me up now babe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dalia nodded and gave Kat’s front half a nice scrub before the two of them rinsed off. Kat started to dry Dalia until the two heard Kat’s father,&quot;Kat! Your friends are going to be arriving soon! You ready?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit!&quot; Dalia covered her mouth about to moo, and Kat quickly snapped her fingers. Dalia suddenly found herself outside in front of a nice large shed that on the inside was a set of stables. Dalia sighed and guessed she should get settled in and help the others get set up doing small things for Kat and everyone else.<br />
<br />
Ten minutes had passed and Kat’s mom and Dad came out and started setting up tables and chairs. Dalia was more than happy to help them with the heavy lifting, and Kat and her family rewarded Dalia with lots of pets and love.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure you are your friends are alright out here with the cow?&quot; Kat’s Dad asked and Dalia turned around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, I’ll be fine I’m 18, and if there really are creeps around I’m sure that Dalia could kick them hard enough to give them at the very least a concussion,” Kat said<br />
<br />
&quot;Dear, just let the girls be boys and girls be boys and girls tonight,&quot; Kat’s mother said then looked at Dalia,&quot;Plus I’m sure Dalia will be a good girl, she’s always sweet, even when she ends up licking our faces.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat’s Dad sighed and said,&quot;Alright..... well let’s see who shows up,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I’ll take them all back here when everyone arrives okay?&quot; Kat said then smiled back at Dalia, and Dalia mooed happily,&quot;I can&#39;t wait to meet your friends Kat!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat laughed and the family went back inside, and until they would come back Dalia decided to eat some of the food in her feeders. Ten minutes passed and Dalia saw the door to the backyard open and Dalia saw Kat and four others, two guys two girls with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Since when did you have a cow Kat?&quot; One asked and one of the guys laughed,&quot;You know at least one of us was thinking of trying to push it, though honestly not a lot of us would have the balls to do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shut up!&quot; The other boy shouted and punched the first in the arm in a friendly fashion before the second girl laughed,&quot;Well I’m the only one here from an actual farm so I welcome the idea of a sleepover with a cow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She’s not exactly a regular cow guys...&quot; Kat replied and one of the guys laughed,&quot;How so-&quot;<br />
<br />
The guy’s eyes locked with Dalia’s and slowly all of the other stopped and stared. Dalia blushed awkwardly and waved scratching the back of her neck as she looked at all of them and Kat smiled,&quot;There she is, isn’t she cute?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She’s on two legs?! How?!&quot; One of the guys asked and Kat looked at him and shushed him,&quot;Hey, she can understand you, hush it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dalia blushed and looked down at herself wondering if it actually was common for cows to walk on two legs like her. The second girl then spoke up and said,&quot;Well personally I think she’s cute too, two legs aside and all of that, where’d you get her Kat?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It’s a secret, and honestly I dunno, we’ve just been with each other my whole life,&quot; Kat replied,&quot;Now come on she doesn’t bite!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat then made her way over to Dalia, and the others slowly followed her. Dalia got to know their names one by one, and Kat seemed to be the youngest of the group having just turned 18, and Kat was the only one who was single. The first girl was Molly, and the guy who mentioned pushing Dalia over was her boyfriend who was Dylan. The other girl seemed to like Dalia and was from a farm was Grace, and her and her boyfriend Brady sat next to Dalia on her sides on a hay bail. Grace was stroking Dalia’s head and admiring her body. Dalia especially likes it when Grace ran her hand gently across her breasts and udder, but avoided her teats. Brady was more squeamish but Grace introduced him to petting farm animals and he was petting your thigh, both of them seemed nice.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Dylan seemed like a hotshot, and it seemed like he said what he did earlier as a cocky remark. Brady compared to Dylan, was much more composed but shy and a bit more introverted it seemed. Then there was Molly, who was definitely a city person, she was afraid of Dalia the most, but that just made it more fun for Dalia to tease her with her presence more and more. Kat smiled and looked around at everyone and said,&quot;Now guys, let me show you something cool,&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat took out her wand and Dalia tilted her head and got excited,&quot;Oh Kat what are you going to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat just giggled at all and everyone gave her a weird look before her wand started glowing and several orbs of light surrounded everyone, but nothing really happened. Dalia tilted her head slightly then paused and asked,&quot;What happened exactly?&quot;<br />
<br />
Then suddenly Molly shrieked,&quot;What the fuck?! Did I just hear a voice?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, you too?!&quot; Brady shouted<br />
<br />
&quot;U-Uh...&quot; Grace just muttered and Dylan shouted,&quot;Okay, someone better explain what the hell is happening.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat started laughing and stood right up,&quot;Oh god that was priceless!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What was? Is this some kind of prank?!&quot; Dylan shouted<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh far from it, trust me,&quot; Kat replied and Dalia added,&quot;Kat what exactly did you do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone’s eyes went wide again except Kat and Dalia’s and everyone was on alert. Kat continued to laugh and she said,&quot;Guys guys, let me explain!&quot;<br />
<br />
All eyes were on Kat now as she stood up and said,&quot;Alright this is a secret from me to everyone who’s in this room. You see, every female member in my family is a witch, and when we turn 18 we gain our magical abilities to do so.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on what?&quot; Grace asked then Dylan chimed in,&quot;Yeah I’m gonna call bullshit on that,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sweetheart I’ve already used one spell, that voice in your head is Dalia’s. It’s the spell I used on her so she can speak to us,&quot; Kat exclaimed which caused Dalia to suddenly bolt up onto two legs, moo loudly, and mentally shout,&quot;Wait you guys can hear me?!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone’s eyes now shifted from Kat to Dalia, and Dalia seemed overjoyed and the moment she saw this she announced,&quot;Holy shit you did!! You can all hear me like Kat now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat laughed at this and said,&quot;Someone’s happy, and I told you all she was smart.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grace, and Brady both looked up at Dalia and looked just as shocked as everyone. Everyone just stared and this made Dalia feel awkward and blush awkwardly,&quot;D-Did I do something wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;N-No just...... wow....&quot; Grace muttered and Brady slowly nodded, the two of them seemed to be calming down whereas Molly continued to stare for a bit and Dylan was in a state of denial as he looked at Kat,&quot;I still don’t believe you Kat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat then paused and raised her brow at Dylan,&quot;I don’t know whether or not I should punish you for that comment and prove it further.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dalia tilted her head and paused,&quot;Do I need to lick him Kat?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dylan immediately spun around and flared at Dalia,&quot;Don’t you dare!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you DO believe I am talking to you,&quot; Dalia replied then placed her hands on her hips sassily.<br />
<br />
&quot;U-Uh... you aren’t going t-to curse us or anything r-right?&quot; Molly asked and Kat paused,&quot;What? No! I just thought since this is my first night with these powers we could do something &#39;unique&#39; my family specializes in transformation magic you see. So that’s why I planned something special for tonight,&quot;</p>
