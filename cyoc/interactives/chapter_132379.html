<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Patricia asked josie if she could join them. Josie said no. Patricia went to kat and asked her for something since she was now always be like this only until midnight. Kat said yes since her party was delayed for a few weeks. Kat asked her what she wanted to do. Patricia wanted her friends to be girls like her, but kat told her that Josies friends were already told to keep this a secret because we do not need for this to happen. Back a Josie’s room Katie told Josie that they can stay until sunday, Josie was  happy because it was now two nights they got to stay over her house. Back to kat, Kat decided to go get dan, Dan saw her in his room and quickly he got a knife. Kat said that she was not going to harm him. She asked him if he would play with patricia and her. Dan was confused and kat told him that patrick was going to be a girl for the rest of this day. Dan said ok. Kat and dan went to Patricks room. Kat and dan asked patrica what she wanted to do. Patricia said that she wanted to play magic dress up. They both were confused, she told them to wait here as she got mom. Patricia got everybody around and she said that they will start with would you rather. Patricia asked mom to enchant the closet for this. So she did. Patricia then went into the closet and pulled up a small dress and a diaper. Patricia asked dan would he rather become a baby boy or a six year old girl. Dan asked if he would be brainwashed and patricia said no, you will act like your self. Dan realised that he could experiment with this. Dan decided to put on the dress. Dan regressed to six. his hair grew long and went into pony tails. He became more femine and his dick was sucked up forming a vagina. Dan asked now what. Patricia said to stay like that for now. Patricia told kat it was her turn. Kat pulled out a princess dress of bell and of cinderalla. She asked patricia what would she be of those two. Patricia said bell. She put it on and turned into a five year old bell. Mom pulled out baby diaper for males or a dog girl costume. kat chosed the dog girl. Kat was turned into a dog, Mom said that she should not be turned into everything. The three were turned back into normal and Kat suggested that they become mermaids. Dan said that he did not want to be stuck as a girl. Mom told dan that she has certain clothes in josie’s closet that will make him a girl if he wears the clothes. Mom made the box for others in josie’s closet appear in patricks room. she also unenchanted the closet. She asked dan if he wanted to have a whole suit or a bikini. Dan chose the bikini and put it on with ease. as soon as he did his hair went down, the size of the suit expanded to his size, he grew c cup breasts and his penis went into his body forming a vagina. He became more feminine. He now she was dani a sixteen year old girl. Kat said to the pool. the three went into the pool. And the three jumped into the pool, then kat turned them into mermaids. The three girls were having a lot of fun. Back to Josie. Her party was going great as Josie truely felt like a girl. Katie, Juile, Anne and Marrissa asked Josie if she knew where Kat was, then they heard splashing and saw three mermaids in the pool, luckily they all brought swim suits as they went down, the girls were shocked to find that John was tell ing the truth. Josie asked Kat if she could transform her new friends into something two. Kat said that when your slumber party is done I will not do it to the again. Kat asked the girls what they wanted to be. Anne wanted to be a mermaid too. Kat told her to get into the water. When she did she instantly became a mermaid. Katie asked if she could be a boy for a little bit, just to see what it is like be one. Kat cast a spell as her swim suit turned into swim trunks her hair grew up, and her vagina grew until it formed a dick. Kat said hello to kyle. Kyle jumped into the pool. Josie asked if she could not change into something. But kat said no, Josie then asked if she could be a fish. Josie then became a fish. Juile asked if she could be a water ninja and she was turned into that. Marrisa said that she wanted to be a five year old girl. she regressed into a five year old girl. They swam for about two hours, but mom went out and told them that it was ten thirty and it was time for bed. They all got out, Kat turned Josie back into a human. She turned Dani and Patricia into humans again. Dani went to her room and took off the bikini and turned back into dan, kat yelled up into dans window that this was one of the few times she would be nice to him with her magic. Dan quickly went to bed. Kat then turned Kyle into Katie and Katie told Josie that shenis glad to be herself again. Katie said that she never wanted to do that again. Kat revesed the water ninja spell on Juile. Juile told Josie that she has a cool family. Josie said thanks as she blushed. Kat turned marrissa back into her nine year old self again, she then turned anne into a human again. Mom said get inside as the seven girls did Josie and her friends went to Josie’s room and they fell asleep as Josie was very happy because she was able to go into their group easily. Kat went into patricia’s room with patricia. Kat told her that she had to be a boy again. Patricia said ok, and she told Kat that this was fun. Kat then reversed it as patricias dick grew back, her hair shorten, her clothes were the ones that she had on when she was transformed into a girl. Patricia now patrick went to bed knowing that he had a fun sister. Kat went to her room and Mom told her thank you for bringing happiness to john. I knew that he was depressed but i did not want to show him that i had powers. you fixed it and figured out why he was always sad and in his room. You also brought peace to this whole house. You will make a good which Kat. Kat blushed and said thank you. Mom said good night and happy birthday sweetie. Kat told her good night and went to bed.<br />
