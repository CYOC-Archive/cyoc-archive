<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As midday arrived, Will was still nursing a bubbling anger over the Gyp that got away.  He needed to vent, and he couldn&#39;t do it cramped up in these classrooms.  As the bell rang for lunch break, Will made his way directly to the lunch room to find Sasha.  Along the way, the students all parted in front of him.  They knew better than to get in William Marsh&#39;s way.  It had only been last month when another student bumped into him between classes.  Will had practically dragged the kid outside and punched his face in, with Dave, Ross, and Sasha watching and laughing.<br />
<br />
Will spotted Sasha with her feet up on the table in front of her, talking with Dave and Ross.  They were laughing about making some of the elementary kids pee themselves, or something like that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; said Will, taking a seat next to them.  &quot;I&#39;m gonna split.  You guys, comin&#39;?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sasha looked at Will sideways for a moment.  &quot;Split?  Now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Will, glowering.  &quot;Got a problem with that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ross was chuckling.  He whispered something in Dave&#39;s ear, and he began guffawing as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot;  Will was scowling.  &quot;What&#39;d you say?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave shook his head.  &quot;Ross was just saying that the kid from this morning got under your skin.&quot;<br />
<br />
In a flash, Will was across the table snagging both buy their shirt collars.  Students in nearby tables either immediately got up and left or stared at  the commotion taking place.  It wasn&#39;t often they saw the four fighting amongst each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, you sacks of shit!&quot; Will growled.  &quot;That little fucker is nothing!  You hear me?  In fact, I don&#39;t wanna hear another word about that little Gyp, got it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eyes wide, lips sealed, the two boys nodded quickly.  Working together, they would maybe have the edge over Will.  But the senator&#39;s son had such a hold over the two, the thought never crossed their shallow minds.<br />
<br />
After a moment of silence, Will let go of the two and turned to leave.  As he did, he turned to Sasha.  &quot;You coming?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sasha shook her head.  &quot;Can&#39;t, sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What, you got something better to do?&quot; Will asked, sounding indignant.<br />
<br />
&quot;LIsten, Will,&quot; she said, crossing her arms.  She wasn&#39;t about to let Will push her around, even if he was a senator&#39;s son.  &quot;If I want to make it to high school next year, I have to pass science, which means I can&#39;t miss the test today.&quot;<br />
<br />
Will face took on the expression of someone who had eaten something particularly sour.  The thought of Sasha choosing schoolwork over him was, well, it just didn&#39;t happen.<br />
<br />
Sasha&#39;s expression soften and she smiled a little.  &quot;I&#39;ll make it up to you later, okay?  I just need to pass this test.  That&#39;s it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Will rolled his eyes.  &quot;Yeah, whatever.  I&#39;ll see you later.&quot;  And, with that he left.<br />
<br />
As Will walked out of the the cafeteria, he felt a tingling in his extremities.  He didn&#39;t realize it, but when he harassed Dave and Ross, Jake&#39;s curse on him activated.  Will was beginning to age to sixteen.  His hands and feet were growing larger, as were the length of his arms and legs.  Luckily, his clothes seemed to be compensating for the growth, growing along with the bully.  His muscles grew somewhat, growing more defined as he entered his mid-teens.  His face matured as well, losing its baby fat.  His jaw became more pronounced, as well as his brow.  The slightest shadow crossed his jaw as the peach fuzz adorning his face turned a shade darker.  Wisps of dark hair appeared at his sideburns, as will as a few hairs adorning his chin.  Blemishes began to appear on his face as acne took hold,  The hair on his arms thickened somewhat.  Under his shirt, a trail of hair grew up to his navel.<br />
<br />
Will wasn&#39;t really aware of the changes.  He did notice that his stride was off and stumbled slightly.  He also took notice that everything seemed a little off-kilter.  He decided to ignore these and continue on.  He knew Dave and Ross were right, but he wasn&#39;t about to let them know that.<br />
<br />
As Will made his way out, he was too distracted by his own thoughts to notice Jake,the boy who had gotten away from his that morning.  Jake was making his own way to the cafeteria when he spotted Will.  He quickly hid behind a group of students talking who took no notice to him.  Jake could see the curse he&#39;d put on Will was having it&#39;s effect.  Will looked like he belonged in high school, now.  He was even more imposing with his musculature and the first signs of facial hair appearing.  Jake slowly shook his head.  This wasn&#39;t going to go well for anyone, that was for sure.  He had to fix this... but how?  He&#39;d only been taught rudimentary curses, not how to remove them.  He&#39;d have to call his grandmother.  She wasn&#39;t going to be happy about this.<br />
<br />
Will absentmindedly scratched his shoulder as he left the building.  He didn&#39;t care if anybody saw him leave.  He&#39;d like to see them try and stop him.  His dad would be all over them if they ever even tried to lay a hand on him.<br />
<br />
As Will walked down the street away from the school, Jake&#39;s curse activated again.  For Will&#39;s disrespect towards authority and skipping school, he&#39;d once again age three years.  As Will approached nineteen, he grew taller once again, his clothes compensating once more.  He plateaued out at around six feet.  His muscles toning once more.  He had an athletic, but not overly muscled build, his pectorals defined by his shirt.  His acne receded, leaving his face smooth, save for the dark stubble lining his jaw.  His dark hair grew a little shaggy and was swept by the wind.  The hair on his arms thickened and covered them in a decent coating.  The hair on his stomach surrounded his navel and shot up to this chest, covering his pectorals in a fine coating.  Once again, Will seemed oblivious to the changes.  That is, until a stinging pain shot into his right shoulder.<br />
<br />
His hand shot to the spot of pain.  &quot;Fuck!&quot; he shouted.  Thinking he&#39;d been stung, he rolled his sleeve up to reveal a well muscled upper arm with a fine coating of dark hair.  There, dead center, the tattoo of a flaming skull sitting in front of a heart inked itself into existence.  Beneath it, was a scroll declaring &quot;Do or Die!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck...&quot; Will muttered to himself.<br />
<br />
Will felt the pain suddenly on the underside of his left forearm.  He clasped his arm in pain, and found it coated in hair.  He turned his arm over to find the tattoo of a bloody knife appear.  The pain appeared again on the knuckles of his right hand.  There on each finger, a letter appeared.  W-I-L-L<br />
<br />
Will&#39;s hand shot to his mouth in surprise.  His hand immediately felt the sandpapery texture of at least several day&#39;s worth of stubble.  Will immediately ran to a nearby window and caught his reflection.  He saw a young adult version of himself standing there.  He experimentally ran a hand over his stubble and another through his hair.  The reflection repeated the action.  He turned the flame skull tattoo to the reflection and flexed the muscle.  A slow grin appeared on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuckin&#39; sweet...&quot;</p>
