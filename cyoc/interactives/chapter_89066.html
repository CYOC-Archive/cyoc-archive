<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle already panting heavily looked at the mirror to see his reflection, back starting at him was a beautiful young woman in her early 20&#39;s, her hair was chocolate brown reaching down below her shoulders. Kyle still holding the phone in her slender and femenine hands with newly painted long nails, Kyle took a deep breath, he could hear jennifer giggling on the other side of the phone. Kyle just stood still looking at his reflection on the wall, his shirt had changed into a short sleeveles V-neck showing of her curvaceous form, he gently touched his face to even see if what he saw was real and uttered a small sound as his hand unwillingly moved down to her newly acquired D-cups, looking down he was also wearing a thight tube skirt for that little extra. Kyle almost dropped the phone but quickly put it back to his ear, J-Jennifer ? you there ? her new voice sounded very soft spoken and calm, Finally you decided to reply to me, look Kyle i am going to forgive you for calling me a bitch, im not that mean after all. Kyle sighed and kept looking at his reflection, are you happy with my work ? after all, this is your fault, do not blame me Kyl-...noo, you need a new name.....how about...Aisha ? thats cute right ? Are you out of your mind jennifer ? you cant do this! what am i going to tell my parents ? jennifer just giggled, Awww, poor you, like its the end of the world, how about i come over ? Kyle looked a bit shocked, C-Come over ? Yeah! i gotta see this myself and i honestly do feel a bit bad about what i did so, its only fair right ? I...i guess thats okay...Jennifer smiles to herself, Awesome, im there in like 10 minutes then, see you soon girl.<br />
<br />
After about 10 minutes Aisha can hear the doorbell rings, she assumes her friends left the house when she told them to get out so she is all alone for now, she takes a deep breath and walks over to the door and looks trough the peephole, sure enough Jennifer is there. Aisha took a deep breath and slowly opens up the door, Jennifer looks at her totally stunned and giggles loudly, Oh my god! oh my god! Is..is that you kyle ? oh my god! Aisha sighs, just...just get inside, Jenny walks inside and sits down on the sofa, oh my god, i just cant belive it, i mean just...wow, you look....you look pretty cute actually ? like i thought you would end up like sorta gangsta girl that sorta type but you actually look pretty...formal i guess ? Aisha sits down on the sofa next to her and shrugs, thanks i guess ? Jennifer smiles, look i know what im talking about Ky...Aisha and i promise you, you look fine and dont tell me you dont like it a bit ? Aisha smiles gently, i suppose so its just kinda you know... Jennifer just smiles, looks if it makes you feel any better i&#39;ll let you Transform or dare me ? i know i shouldnt but im just that nice. Aisha smiles and looks at her, oh yeah ? are you sure about that ? Jennifer shrugs, not really but you know, i did kinda turn you into a black girl and its...you know..permanent, W-What ?! its permanent ? Aisha sits up and looks at jennifer, Jennifer just nods slowly, yeah, thats...like the rule right ? every transformation is permanent but seriously, Kyle, i know this is going to be harsh and all but...you...jennifer sighs, youre better of like that seriously, Aisha looks at her again, Excuse me ? Jennifer smiles, think about it, youre a good looking girl right ? sure youre...black but so what ? and youre still alive you just gotta...start from scratch and besides, if we follow your logic things will change so it will be like you&#39;ve always been like that right ? Aisha nods slowly i guess thats true but we dont know that, she takes a deep breath and smiles faintly and walks over to the mirror hanging on the celing, Jennifer gets up from the sofa and walks over to Aisha and stands behind her, you look good Aisha, dont think about kyle okay ? look if....people still remember Kyle and i am wrong about...people forgetting and getting new memories i&#39;ll help you, Jennifer smiles at Aisha. Aisha smiles back and turns to look at jennifer, okay jenny but what about my parents ? what about my family ? Jennifer shrugs...you live alone so you dont have to worry about that now, like i said, i&#39;ll help you. Aisha without thinking smiles and hugs jennifer, jennifer giglggles and hugs back, oh my god Aisha, youre an amazing hugger, Aisha smiles, thanks but...you&#39;re sure about that ? do you really want me to T or D you ? Jennifer nods slowly yeah but...remember this is  like almost the last time its going to work for another hundred years, i dunno why but i just...when i lost the powers back to you again i just sorta instantly knew it.<br />
Aisha nods slowly and looks over at jennifer, oh...Uhm..Jenny, you did say some stuff after that aswell ? i dropped the phone so i didnt really hear it...Jennifer giggles, seriously ? oh my god okay well its pretty much spot on like i said, black woman...well endowed twenty years and really, thats what im seeing here, Yeah ? but you didnt say...anything else did you ? Jennifer shrugs, i did say with appropriate traits and clothing, your clothes are...like i said, kinda formal that skirt really sorta suits you though, you look kinda cute with it but you should really get some jeans or something, also...? did you apply make-up before i got here ? Aisha shakes her head, N-no...it just sorta happened ? eyelashes and everything but...weirdly enough i like...know how to do it ? i know how to apply make-up, shopping for clothes, finding right size and so on. Jennifer just keeps smiling, its womans intuiton Aisha, i told you, Aisha smiles okay so for your Dare Jennifer. i..Dare you to....Aisha stops and thinks for a moment...you dare me to what ? look i know what youre going to say so just say it and honestly im totally fine with it Aisha jennifer smiles happily at her, W-what ? S-seriously ? Jennifer nods, okay then...i dare you to be my girlfriend and someday wife til we die Jennifer. <br />
<br />
A bright light shines around jennifer as she looks up at aisha and smiles at her lovingly, Aisha, i love you she leans closer to her and gently kisses her cheek, Aisha blushes and looks at jennifer, J-Jennifer...stops for a second and looks down before looking back up at jennifer, i love you jennifer. They look at each others for what seems like an eternity as jennifer takes and holds around aisha&#39;s hand, Aisha...can i tell you something ? Aisha nods, of..of course girlfriend. Jennifer smiles and sits back down on the sofa, i sorta...look as soon as i could hear you speak after the...change...i just...i just kinda knew it would end up like this and the weird part is that...im like totally fine with it, i would not have it any other way now, i love you Aisha, youre perfect....i have always loved colored women and you just...jennifer is blushing heavily and hides her face in her hands as aisha sits down next to her. Aisha strokes her hair and looks at her, R-really ? like seriously ? Yeah! seriously! Aisha cuddles up a bit closer to her and smiles, I&#39;ll...ill be your perfect girlfriend then jennifer and hopefully...someday even your wife, Jennifer takes away her hands from her face and looks over at aisha, she is blushing quite heavily, Aisha ? i know i said you could transform me aswell but...you did just dare me so can i say a tiny dare back to you and then you can...transform me if you really have to...? Aisha looks at her for a little while but sighs and nods, of course girlfriend. Jennifer giggles with excitement and looks at aisha, okay Aisha girlfriend, you dared me to be your perfect wife so i will dare you to be my perfect girlfriend and wife! that means no mention of kyle ever again, youre going to be proud to be a lesbian woman Aisha.<br />
<br />
Aisha giggles a bit and strokes jennifer&#39;s hair again, mention who and of course im proud to be myself darling, this is after all who i am just your average gal right ? Jennifer giggles and nods well, maybe not average, you&#39;re perfect after all! Aisha smiles, lets just get the transformation out of the way then shall we ? Jennifer nods, okay but...you love me for who i am right ? Aisha nods! of course i love you for who you are! youre my wifey girlfriend after all, so for your transformation... how about whenver you want you can turn into a different sort of person ? only female of course but...like anything at all, real of fiction ? but no superpowers of course, Aisha giggles and looks at jennifer. Jennifer looks at her a bit shocked but looks pretty happy aswell, so like anything i desire ? i could...turn into you for example ? Aisha giggles, sure, why not ? but promise you wont ever cheat on me or anything...it is just for us in private okay ? Jennifer quickly nods and kisses Aisha deeply and lovingly on her lips and holds around her thigtly as a small light envelops around her, she can feel something different about her and she pretty much knows how she can change shape and form just by thinking of it but she also needs Aishas permission to do so. Aisha looks at her and kisses her lovingly back, my perfect jennifer.....my perfect Aisha. They smile and keep making out for several hours as they both fall asleep cuddling up togheter each dreaming of each others and loving their new and perfect life togheter.<br />
<br />
The next years went fine, nobody remembered kyle had ever exsisted, his former friends knew about Aisha but had never really talked to her alot, Jennifer managed to get her to join her cheerleading squad and they both seemed to enjoy each others company alot, they both graduated school with good grades and ended up working for the same company as writers and editors of a fashion, after about three years of working there they both quit and started up their own company selling expensive desinger dresses and luxury clothing for women and turning quite a profit from it. By the age of 32 they had both gotten happily married and just living in happily as they days passed on, eventually adopting a cute little asian girl called Changying. they lived happily and enjoyed each others company pretty much all the time, there was never a dull moment nor a boring one at that and of course, Aisha could never thank Jennifer enough for the wonderous gift she had given her, each day, while never mentioning kyle she smiled as memories of kyle fading away making new ones as Aisha, a proud wife and mother to a wonderfull wife.</p>
