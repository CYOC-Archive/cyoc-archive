<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty was so happy with his latest transformation where he just casually transformed a girl into a handsome, tall, and muscular boy without any consequences at all. The boys just continued with their lives, like nothing had ever happened and nobody knew that Ty was responsible for their gender change. <br />
<br />
He knew that the number of girls at his high school outnumbered the boys by a ratio of 2-to-1, so there were way more girls than boys at his school. Furthermore, they needed more guys on the football team, the tennis team and on the soccer team, for these sports were on the verge of being canceled due to the lack of participation. There just weren’t enough boys to play on these teams so they could fill the roster. <br />
<br />
“We need more guys at our school” Ty thought to himself as he looked around the busy hallway of his school, taking note of the large groups of girls walking around everywhere. “We got girls all over the place, but not enough guys! I need to change that!” <br />
<br />
So, Ty used his powers to quietly sneak out of his boring English literature class, which he hated. He quietly wandered through the vast, wide corridors of his school, searching for some victims to change. When he didn’t find anyone, he decided to make himself invisible as he approached the women’s restroom. Since he was invisible now, he quietly snuck into the large ladies’ restroom, where three girls were holding a long conversation while they were standing in front of the long counter where four sinks were located. A large mirror was hanging on the wall before them. <br />
<br />
“I can’t decide which sports teams I want to sign up for” Allison said to her friends. Allison was tall with long, dark hair. “There are so many players on the girls’ soccer and softball teams already. I just don’t think they need any new players!” <br />
<br />
“The boys have it much easier!” Madison spoke. She was shorter with long, blonde hair. “They need players on almost every team! They don’t have enough players. Why is it that we can’t play for any of the boys’ teams?” <br />
<br />
“I already tried out for the soccer, lacrosse and tennis teams, and I got rejected since there were twenty other girls trying out as well! So much competition! It’s just not fun anymore! Ugh!” Robin groaned. Robin was a bit shorter with light brown hair. “What are we gonna do?” <br />
<br />
“Ahh… Three girls who can’t join any teams because there are too many girls out there already! Time for me to change these girls into… boys!” Ty grinned happily. “They will make three great, athletic additions to the boys’ teams, which we desperately need right now! Here goes!” Ty whispered, as he quietly made his wishes. <br />
<br />
Allison suddenly lurched forward as her hair shrunk while her breasts disappeared. She quickly grew a few inches taller as she rapidly grew some more muscle in her long legs and arms! Her face changed too, as she now had a sharp jawline, and she suddenly showed some stubble on her face. She also had some hair all over her chest and arms. Within seconds, she transformed from a tall girl into a handsome, tall, dark young man with thick quads and nice, defined abdominal muscles. <br />
<br />
All while Allison was changing, Madison was transforming as well. The blonde girl was changing into a shorter but muscular teenage blond boy with broad shoulders and big pecs, with thick, large biceps and triceps. The boy was athletic enough to be considered a young up-and-coming bodybuilder. He had thick, wide quads and large calves, which stuck out from the back of his legs like melons. Even though Madison was shorter than Allison, his bigger muscles made up for the difference in height. <br />
<br />
And then there was Robin. Robin also grew way more muscular right away, with short brown hair and eyes as her breasts disappeared, leaving her with broad shoulders, big pecs and broad shoulders with a firm jawline. He became a little taller than Madison with some good muscle everywhere, great for sports and for bodybuilding. Robin now looked like a young guy who spent a lot of time lifting weights in the gym! <br />
<br />
Once the transformation of the three had completed, Ty quickly teleported them to the boy’s restroom, so they wouldn’t freak out. <br />
<br />
The three young men just stared at each other when they noticed that they were standing in the boy’s room, talking about sports. <br />
<br />
“Umm, where were we? Oh yeah.” Allison said, but now his name had changed to Aaron. He was the tallest boy in the group. “I’m gonna try out for baseball tomorrow. If they won’t take me, then I’ll try out for soccer. They desperately need players!” <br />
<br />
“Hey, I’m definitely trying out for soccer tomorrow! I mean, they need something like ten players! The girls’ team is full, but we don’t have enough players on the guys’ team at all!” Madison reasoned. He was perfect for soccer since he was short and muscular. <br />
<br />
“Me too! They got all the players they need for football, but I wanna try out for lacrosse! That seems like such a fun sport to me! And we’re so short and players right now, that I’m pretty sure they’ll take me!” Robin grinned. “I’ve been working out in the gym really hard so I’m ready!” <br />
<br />
Ty couldn’t be happier. Three girls, who were frustrated and unhappy, had been transformed into three boys, who were completely content with their situations at school. Ty just grinned as he saw the three boys leave the restroom and walk down the hall, as they discussed their sports goals with excitement. <br />
<br />
Now, all Ty wanted to do was look for more young girls, older woman or sad, lonely or depressed teenage students to transform into boys. He had the power to do it, after all, and nobody needed to know that he was the one responsible for changing their genders. </p>
