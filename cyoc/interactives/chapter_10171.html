<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dustin followed Ty into the bathroom, carrying a large tent... or at least it looked like one.  It was a robe for Ty.  &quot;Here you go, I found one of the really big ones.&quot;  Ty picked it up from his younger brother and slipped it on.  It barely tied around his waist, which made him question &quot;How big will the next one be?&quot;  Dustin moved around Ty and stood on the scale to his right.  Young and thin Dustin weighed in at only 115 pounds, he sighed dejectedly and walked out of the room.  Ty decided it was time to wish off the weight, and as he got ready to wish, he was interrupted.  &quot;TY, COME DOWNSTAIRS PLEASE!&quot;  It was Mark!  Now he had to wait to slim down, they'd see him changing if he did it right now.  &quot;Coming!&quot;  He yelled back.<br />
  Ty squeezed his way through the doorframe and bounced down the stairs, Dustin in pursuit.  The whole house shook with his movements as he blubbered into the kitchen.  Mark stood there with a few bags of fast food.  &quot;Here kid, get to work.  You've got to keep eating if we want to beat that record again.&quot;  Ty looked at him in disbelief.  &quot;Beat it again?  How would that be physically possible?  People don't get that fat.&quot;  Mark shook his head  &quot;Those people didn't try hard enough, we're shooting for 1600 or higher here.&quot;  Ty sat at the table as june put heaps of fries and burgers on the table.  &quot;Remember, we pay for your college.  Eat up or you get cut off.  We're going to spend the whole day on you before you leave.&quot;  Ty dreaded the thought.  The only person in the family who liked him at all seemed to be Dustin.  &quot;So you want me to be completely immobile just for college?  I don't think it works like that, that defeats the purpose of college because I'll be too fat to go!&quot;  Mark and June glared at him, causing him to shy away from them and begin to eat.<br />
<br />
  He sat there for an agonizing hour, eating bite after bite of food that seemed to be endless.  He didn't dare stop from the look he was given, these people had gone insane.  Ty stared across at his little brother he looked longingly at the food.  June and Mark must forget him from time to time since they got him as a prize pig.  Ty noticed a tightness in his robe, and loosened the knot.  The robe pulled back across his stomach, still pulled tight across his frame.  It exposed his deep navel and his grossly tight stomach.  He finally reached an end to the food and pulled himself up from the table.  His gut was pushing itself outward in front of him, and he couldn't tie the robe.  He sighed, and asked June and Mark if he could at least use the washroom before they started the afternoon eating session.  <br />
<br />
  &quot;Sure, but go with him Dustin.  We don't want him purging or anything while he's in there.&quot;  Mark said sharply.  Dustin rose obediently and followed the lumbering Ty. Dustin watched Ty struggle his way up the stairs with respect.  Ty pushed himself into the bathroom and looked at the livestock strength scale, he stood on it and watched the balance hit 805.  He had eaten 21 pounds of food in under an hour, it was no surprise that his parents thought they could boost his weight up to 1600 pounds.  Ty looked over at Dustin, paltry and pale.  He was a stark contrast to Ty's own bulbous shape.  Dustin was shy now, he was nothing like he was as a jock.  Ty finally spoke up  &quot;What's wrong kiddo?&quot;  Dustin looked at Ty and his massive body.  &quot;Nothing.  It's just so great that mom and dad fuss over you like that... I wish they'd do that for me.&quot;  Ty shook his head.  &quot;You don't want this Dustin.  They're treating me like a farm animal, not a person.&quot;<br />
<br />
  Dustin quieted for a moment.  &quot;I know... but they look at you at least.  I haven't changed a bit since I was 12... at 16 years old I should have hit puberty at least.  It's like I'm stuck this way, skinny and undeveloped.  I've got a kiddie-dick of all things.&quot;  Ty looked at him with a bit of pity.  &quot;So... you'd trade this to be really fat, so Mark and June would notice you?&quot;  Dustin hung his head.  &quot;I'm just sick of being a little kid.&quot;  <br />
&quot;Just wait Dustin, it will happen.&quot;  Ty said.  He thought to himself &quot;Right now it will.  I wish that Dustin would hit puberty right now and be developed into a strong 16 year old by the end of the hour.&quot;<br />
<br />
  &quot;I've got to sleep some more Dustin... being this big makes a guy really tired really quick.&quot;  Ty said with a grin.  He pat Dustin on the head and squeezed his way back into the hall.  He lay down on the bed on his floor and fell asleep.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------<br />
<br />
  Dustin stood in the bathroom after Ty left.  He stood ready to shower on the cool tile floor.  Slowly he began to change.  He stared into the mirror at his body, as dissappointing as it was.  He flexed his arms and noticed something strange, pit hair!  He began to smile, he had finally started the change.  He looked down in the mirror at his dick, which was still pitifully small, but then he realized something.  He had never been able to see his dick in the mirror before, he was always so short that the counter was tall enough to reach his navel.  He was getting taller!  He looked at his lanky frame.  He may have been getting taller, but he wasn't getting any heavier.  He looked like a beanpole.  He looked down at his crotch again, at his 3 and a half inch erection... but it wasn't three and a half inches.  Dustin watched as his dick swelled to 4, then 5, 6, 7, and 8 inches.  His nuts swelled and lowered from his body.<br />
<br />
  Soon Dustin was standing at 5'11&quot; with a great 10 inch erection, but he was still 115 pounds, but then another change happened.  He looked at his chest, which began to swell.  His biceps were beefing out too, so were his thighs and calves.  Dustin nearly squealed in glee as his weight climbed from 115 to 125, then 135.  Dustin looked at his swelling body, he was going from frail boy to a beefed out jock.  Ty wasn't kidding, puberty would happen soon, but he didn't think it would happen like this.  In only a few minutes he was a beefy 170 pounds,  none of it fat.  He ran from the bathroom into Ty's room.  He crouched down and shook his enormous brother awake.<br />
<br />
  &quot;Ty, look!  Look what happened to me!&quot; He shouted.  Ty rolled over groggily.  &quot;Dustin, why are you standing naked in my room.... with your dick very close to my face?&quot;  He backed up and apologized, &quot;But ty, look at me!  I'm big!&quot;  Ty fully awoke and tried to act surprised  &quot;Whoa!  How'd that happen?&quot;  Dustin grinned &quot;I don't know and I don't care!  But I'm going to start going to the gym, I want to get even bigger.&quot;  Ty smiled at him and made another silent wish.  &quot;I wish that Dustin could gain muscle mass easier than normal.&quot;  He thought that was a good present for the kid.  Maybe Mark and June would get more interested in having a massively muscular teen.  Ty noticed that his stomach was gurgling.<br />
<br />
  Dustin looked down at Ty's enormous stomach and said &quot;Wait here, I'll go get you some more food!&quot;  As he got up he wrapped Ty's tent-sized robe about him and ran downstairs.  Ty wondered how he was already hungry...  &quot;That's it, I think it's time for everyone to go back to bed.&quot;</p>
