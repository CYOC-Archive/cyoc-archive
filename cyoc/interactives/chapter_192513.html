<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Damon felt himself being carried, cradled in a pair of arms. Then laid on something soft, his tail gently being adjusted for comfort. Then he fell back into a deeper sleep.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Are you satisfied now!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Nnnuh?&quot;<br />
<br />
The world was a pale grey-blue, with strands of white cloud drifting through. All around, in every direction. Damon stood on empy air in a void -- or maybe there was just nothing to differentiate transparent floor from walls or ceiling. Across from him stood a mirror image of himself, fists clenched and face twisted in outrage.<br />
<br />
Or no. The figure across from him was as he had awakened in the morning: 5&#39;11&quot; as opposed to his old 5&#39;9&quot;; handsome; noble in bearing. Dirty blond hair, peircing blue eyes. Dressed in the finery he had himself donned.<br />
<br />
But that was no longer him, was it...? He was even shorter than he remembered, maybe 5&#39;7&quot;. Looking down, he saw large, pale, naked breasts capped with pink areolas and nipples. His hands were tipped with little, half-retracted brown claws instead of nails. And as he ran them over himself, he confirmed that the rest of his body was just as feminine as his chest, including his loins. A moan slipped between his fangs as his fingers brushed his soft, silky folds, and a flush of warmth spread through him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you done feeling yourself up, slut?&quot; sneered the princely figure. Damon blushed, and shifted to trying to cover himsef. Herself? </i>So confusing...<i> He could feel a long, fluffy tail press against his legs, his ears tilted down.<br />
<br />
</i>What am I?<i><br />
<br />
<b>&quot;A Foxwoman.&quot;</b> He remembered that, the voice of the madame, Marie. He shook his head, bewildered by the other Damon&#39;s words and the heat radiating from his womanhood at the disjointed memory of the sex and the change.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I&#39;m sorry? I&#39;m not --&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry!? You -- you ruined my life! Who or what even <b>are</b> you!? Why did you take possession of me? Where did you come from? What do you want? -- to turn me into a moaning whore!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No! No, I...&quot; Damon blinked, tears starting to form in his eyes. &quot;I didn&#39;t... I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on!&quot;<br />
<br />
The other Damon drew a breath, his rage seeming to abate a bit as he took in the the weepy female form before him. &quot;I woke up this morning with no control of my body. It was like a dream, watching someone else talk with the servants, my parents, Yavarond... I know you call yourself Damon too. And that you&#39;re from another world?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-Yes...&quot; Realization dawned. &quot;Sooo... wait... you&#39;re <b>the</b> Prince Damon?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! And you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;D-Damon McAllister... I...&quot; He choked, eyes sliding closed. Hot tears spilled down his cheeks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh for Goddess&#39; sake. What are <b>you</b> crying about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I didn&#39;t mean...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn&#39;t mean!?&quot; Damon forced his eyes open as he felt the other draw nearer. The Prince pointed off to his right -- Damon&#39;s left. &quot;Look at what you&#39;ve done to my body!&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon turned, and saw a large mirror -- a wall of glass -- showing both of their reflections. His own was rather blurry -- drawn from the brief impression he had formed between transforming and passing out. Long white hair, black fox ears, black fox tail. Foxwoman. On the other hand, his human counterpart was crystal clear, and he found it even more unsettling to see his current form paired off against what he had been. What he <b>should</b> have been -- except...<br />
<br />
Except it <b>wasn&#39;t</b> his body. It was this other Damon&#39;s body, not his own scrawny little Earth body.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; he groaned, shaking his hand. Abandoning modesty, he hugged his slender arms around himself under his bust. &quot;None of this was supposed to happen. Why didn&#39;t the genie grant my wish? Even here my existence is hurting people...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Djinni?&quot; queried the Prince, momentarily thrown. The two turned to face each other again, Damon sniffling.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I found a genie in a lamp... Sh-She said I had... three wishes... Everyone hated me... so I... I wished to not exist.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Goddess.&quot; The two stood awkwardly for a while, quiet except for Damon&#39;s sobs.<br />
<br />
&quot;So...&quot; The Prince spoke again at last. &quot;This Djinni granted your wish by sending your spirit to another world? -- <i>my</i> world.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I guess...?<br />
<br />
&quot;And you took possession of <i>my</i> body because it was most similar to your own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I didn&#39;t <b>mean</b> to, I...!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s really hard to swallow that there was a duplicate of me in another world, you know? How do I know you&#39;re not making this all up? It seems far more likely that you&#39;re some kind of fox demon trying to destroy Lightgard!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Damon sniffed, and rubbed at his face. &quot;I -- I&#39;m human, really! Or... I was...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why? Why warp my body into -- into that!?&quot; He jabbed a finger at Damon. &quot;I don&#39;t despise Beastmen the way a lot of Lightgarders do, but I don&#39;t want to BE one! And a female -- do you know what this <b>means</b> for the kingdom!? Succession reverts to Thamasa now -- and <b>she&#39;s married!</b>&quot;<br />
<br />
At the moment Damon had no idea what that meant. All he knew was that he was scared, confused, and ashamed. He wanted to just slip away... his hands lowered themselves to his breasts. So full... nice and smooth... if only he could just enjoy them... He shook his head, trying to focus.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I didn&#39;t mean to! That woman... Marie... she tricked me! You -- you were there, weren&#39;t you?&quot; Damon thought he remembered a voice in his head, though he wasn&#39;t sure.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Yes,&quot; admitted the Prince after a minute. &quot;I guess... you were drunk, and it let me gain more awareness of what was going on. But much too late! Damn it...&quot;<br />
<br />
The heat was increasing, seeming to pour into Damon from outside, pooling in his lions and at his nipples. He began to stroke over his breasts. Surreptitiously at first, but as he felt pleasure radiating from the touch, and the heat increasing, he began to lose himself to it, nearly shutting out his double&#39;s tirade.<br />
<br />
Subtly the light around them shifted, from slate to pink, the clouds sparkling gold and red.<br />
<br />
The royal Damon was fretting over what he would do now, how he would escape the brothel and get back his humanity -- or at least his manhood. &quot;This is a crisis! And I doubt Marie will just let me go, after I saw her --&quot; A soft moan drew his attention to what Damon was doing. &quot;Goddess! Are you <b>listening!?</b> You really <b>are</b> a shameless slut!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;S-Sorry...&quot; Damon tried to stop fondling his tits, but as he stopped, the heat in his nethers spiked. &quot;I -- ohhhhh!&quot;<br />
<br />
Helplessly he squeezed at himself, teasing his nipples as the need to be touched grew in him. His shaven pubic hair grew out, denser, softer, until black fox fur lapped all around his damp lips and began to spread outward over his thighs and belly.<br />
<br />
The Prince did not notice this at first, just staring in disgusted anger at the wanton display. But then he too felt heat, his cock stirring in his pants -- and then suddenly he was naked! He shivered, a chill before feverish heat spread through his flesh. He looked down, gaping, as his penis curved upward, throbbing with sudden need.<br />
<br />
&quot;What in the hells?&quot; He watched his own pubic hair fade down into soft fur, a black swamp that devoured his cocks and balls. Pleasure built up as they sank down, and ran to his nipples, which also began to stiffen. &quot;What!?&quot; His eyes widened. &quot;Oh Goddess no!&quot; He clutched at his privates just as his balls vanished and his skin drew apart in a fleshy slit. &quot;NO!&quot; His voice broke, becoming as high and breathy as the Earth-Damon&#39;s. &quot;You can&#39;t -- can&#39;t do this to me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon could only groan in answer. He watched, enraptured, as the Prince&#39;s body truly did begin to mirror his own, showing the changes as they progressed. As the carpet of black fur swept up, two more pairs of nipples buddedd across their fronts, mammary tissue mounding beneath them. Their first pair of breasts grew as well, gaining a cup size under the velvety blanket.<br />
<br />
Their legs grew longer; heels lifting, balls and toes thickening into paws. Thighs, hips, butts expanded in proportion, keeping their symmetry even as their cores grew hard with lean muscle. Their spines popped softly, adding to their stature, as lithe, feral power filled them. Feeding into their lusts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop it!&quot; screamed the Prince, futilely grasping at his cock as it compressed down into a clitoris. &quot;Goddess, please! Stooop!&quot;<br />
<br />
The fur -- and the heat -- washed up their necks, over their faces. &quot;Ohhhh...&quot; It was almost like another erection as Damon&#39;s jaws pushed out, his fangs growing longer, the rest of his teeth sharpening to match. His silver hair growing out to a thick silken mane cascading down to his heart-shaped buttocks. His nose growing wet, the scent of lusty vixens filling his head. And -- a musky odour, hot, spicy even... males...? His tail began to wag.<br />
<br />
The world was definitely tinged red now, the clouds beginning to swirl in a hot tempest. Behind the Prince, Damon saw a tall figure coalesce: a large masculine silhouette, with foxy ears and whiskers, and burning golden eyes. even thoguh the werevixens had now surpassed six feet, the dark figure completely overshadowed the Prince.<br />
<br />
And he felt a similar presence looming behind him, warming him with its lust for his body, and saw it taking form in the mirror from the corner of his eye. Shaped from his buried vulpine instinct, he saw the shadow of a long, tapered dick pointing at his pillowy rear, an unknown bulge at its base.<br />
<br />
The royal Damon seemed unaware of them as he continued to loudly protest his own transformation. &quot;A werefox!? Were-vixen!? Gods, no!&quot; The Prince&#39;s new-grown tail, meanwhile, was bushed out, low and stiff with anger and fear. &quot;This CAN&#39;T be happening! Don&#39;t drag me down to your level, slu-ahhhh!?&quot;<br />
<br />
His ranting shifted into a yelp as the shadow-fox reached around and grabbed his breasts -- his first and largest pair, for he now had four more globes below them, C and A compared to his luscious main E cups, matching Damon perfectly now.<br />
<br />
Damon responded with another, more needy moan as his own phantom todd mirrored the Prince&#39;s, roughly groping his heavy breasts. He put his hands -- tiny in comaprison -- over the male&#39;s, urging him on as Damon melted in his embrace. He was ashamed to be giving in like this, but... he couldn&#39;t stop. He couldn&#39;t stand the pain any more; he needed the comfort.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sweet vixen,&quot; growled a deep, throaty voice in his ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeeesss...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; The Prince was struggling, though not very hard, as the shadow fox nibbled at his ears. He wanted to fight -- but he found his control over the dreamscape vanishing under the pervasive <b>need</b> of Earth-Damon&#39;s sexual fantasy. A need he himself felt with increasing urgency. &quot;No, I -- I&#39;m not a whore! Noo-oo-oo! L-Let go...! Y-You...&quot; He reached out pleadingly as he felt his body uielding tot he male&#39;s touch. &quot;You can... stop this...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmm...&quot; But Damon was only half-aware of his double&#39;s words, mingling them with the accusations of his own masculinity. How could he enjoy it as the shadow-todd tweaked his nipples, and teased that hard throbbing meat agaisnt his pussy lips? He was ashamed of himself. He was sorry for the Prince.<br />
<br />
But he needed this. He <b>wanted</b> this. No... <b>she</b> wanted this... yes... Damon <b>was</b> a vixen and he... she... she wanted to be loved like a vixen...<br />
<br />
But the Prince... she didn&#39;t want to hurt him. So, she made one last effort. Closing her eyes, she tried to will it all away. If this was all coming from her, then... maybe she could --<br />
<br />
&quot;On all fours, vixen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Quickly she complied with the todd&#39;s command, the thought of resisting puffed away like dandelion seed in a gale. His hands guided her down until her forearms braced against the non-existent floor, boobs pressed into the hard surface and squeezing against each other. The strong hands ran tantalising over her lesser breasts before gripping her flanks, the hot tip of his rod nudging aside her equally hot petals.<br />
<br />
&quot;Never!&quot; screamed Prince Damon as the same command growled in his ears. But once more the sense of helplessness overcame him as control slipped away into the lusts of the Foxwoman his body had become and the werefox those lusts had conjured. Before the dominant touch of the male, all strength fled his body, and he was being bent forward. He heard a wnaton moan spill from his own lips as his tits crushed into the ground, reflecting the fate of the Earth-Damon.<br />
<br />
Their noses were almost touching. Damon stared into the panicked golden glow of the Prince&#39;s eyes, even as they both panted with anticipation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please,&quot; begged the Prince, his voice a soft feminine whisper. &quot;I can&#39;t... like this...&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon could not answer as the renard pulled her hips back and speared her with his hard, thickening length. The todds leaned over, fondling their submissive vixens&#39; dangling breasts, then pulled back, pulled out, to thrust again. And again.<br />
<br />
<b>&quot;Doesn&#39;t it feel better?&quot;</b> echoed the voice of Marie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ye-e-e-essss,&quot; whimpered both Damons together, their pussies squeezing around the invading cocks. The Earth-born Damon stared into the muzzle of her royal counterpart, seeing him give into the pleasure just as she had: tongue lolling, the panic in his eyes glazing over with sensual abandon. Finally, they mirrored each other, just like the figures in the glass to the side.<br />
<br />
Four vixens, in a world now spinning with dark red desire, shot with crimsons and sparks of ruddy gold like bubbles in a wine glass. Mounted by four todds, shadowy but intensely, carnally real. The four vixens pressed back as one, meeting the males&#39; thrusts. Eager to feel that bulge enter and stretch them to their limits. <br />
<br />
It just felt too good! So natural to have a vulpine shaft pushing deep into their raised rears, their tits jostling each other under the weight of a male... So wonderful to just let go, forget their worries...<br />
<br />
<b>&quot;Be free.&quot;</b><br />
<br />
Yes... free... Damon&#39;s longing to shed his worries mixed with the fire of the enchanted liquor, and the Beastwoman&#39;s deep connexion to the wild... all fumed and roiled, driving both vixens and their reflected images further, and further, until...<br />
<br />
&quot;Cum,&quot; growled the deep voice in Damon&#39;s ear. She felt the claws dig into her hips. The thick knot wedged itself inside; her flower sealed around it. An ecstatic wail rose from her throat, echoed helplessly by her doppelganger.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m cummiiiiiing...!&quot;</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Ah! ...ah...&quot; Damon blinked, red haze clearing as she awoke. Panting, she let the sensations sink in -- she was laying on her back, her bare flesh nestling into a soft bed. Not on furry tits pressing into unyielding ground. The light was low, but it was daylight -- she could see it filtering in past drawn curtains.<br />
<br />
For a minute she just lay there, continuing to catch her breath. <i>Was that all just a dream...?</i> She could feel the weight on her chest, her tail moving idly across the bedspread. Wetness between her legs and soaking the sheets beneath. <I>So... I am a Foxwoman...?</i> She shifted her head, looking around. <i>Where am I?</i><br />
<br />
She sat up, and put a hand on her smooth-skinned breast. <i>Just</i> a Foxwoman, not a werevixen. It <i>had</i> been just a dream. Damon was almost... disappointed. It had felt so good to be bigger, more powerful... and those extra curves... that wild lust...<br />
<br />
She sighed. She could see she was in a bedroom; well-furnished, though not opulent. How had she gotten here? She wasn&#39;t sure, now, where reality had ended and the dream began.<br />
<br />
Ears twitched as someone walked outside the room, and she turned her head. The door opened, and in stepped Marie. Once more the madame was dressed, and looked to only be a tiefling. No orange eyes, red skin, or spaded tail. Had the Succubus been part of the dream too?<br />
<br />
&quot;I see you&#39;re awake,&quot; she said, nodding. &quot;I didn&#39;t think the drink would hit you <i>that</i> hard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where am I?&quot; It was the first question on Damon&#39;s mind as she struggled to separate fact from fantasy.<br />
<br />
&quot;My bedroom. I brought you here after our little romp, when you passed out. It&#39;s been a little over an hour, I reckon.&quot; She studied Damon.<br />
<br />
<i>And the Prince?</i> Damon wondered as the tiefling scrutinised her guest. <i>Was that just part of the dream too?</i> She couldn&#39;t sense him, not even the pressure in her mind that had plagued her earlier.<br />
<br />
<i>Him...</i> She realised suddenly that <i>she</i> herself had been male not so long ago. Odd... after that dream, of submitting and feeling herself orgasm to being penetrated, that identity seemed distant and no longer right. Still, she crossed her legs, a bit self-consicous.<br />
<br />
&quot;All you all right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon looked up at Marie. This was all her doing, wasn&#39;t it? Whether it was the drink, or some other magic, the tiefling had turned her from a human male to a Fixman female. Even suggested that she would become a whore herself.</p>
