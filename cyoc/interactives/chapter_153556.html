<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Temperatures had dipped during the night, making the fitfully sleeping Freddie grateful that he could curl his furry form within the blanket his mother had spread over an unoccupied spot beneath the roof of the family carport. Shortly after sunrise, his sensitive ears picked up the abundant evidence of the dawning of a new day: birds chirping, trucks and cars moving along nearby streets, and even a passenger jet passing overhead on its descent to the local airport.<br />
<br />
He buried his snout deeper into the blanket, determined to get some more sleep. He might have succeeded if not for the sensation of having his face washed by a wide, warm tongue. The licking moved around to his ears, which really made the transformed teenager sit bolt upright and take notice.<br />
<br />
Ellie, the neighbor&#39;s cute brown and white Australian shepherd, continued to nuzzle his right ear. For Freddie, the other dog licking his ear felt ten times more powerful than any of the almost orgasmic sensations caused by  the behind-the-ear scratching his boyfriend had bestowed on him.<br />
<br />
Then, even as he bathed in the intensely pleasurable feelings, something clicked. Ellie! What was she doing on his side of the fence?<br />
<br />
Tangled in the blanket, Freddie struggled to put all four paws under him. Ellie gave some excited yips as he finally found his footing while at the same time discovering the equivalent of morning wood, doggie style, with his penis completely emerged from its furry sheath.<br />
<br />
Ellie circled behind him and began sniffing his butt. &quot;Oh my god!&quot; Despite his vision being relegated to all the shades of gray, Freddie swore he saw explosions of color in his brain as Ellie deliberately coaxed and teased him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go away!&quot; Freddie whimpered with some desperation. &quot;How did you get here?&quot;<br />
<br />
A possibility sprang to mind and, only after considerable mental effort, he tore himself from Ellie&#39;s side and trotted to the section of fence where he had been digging last night. The hole, too small for him, had been perfectly adequate for Ellie, especially after she had contributed her own effort to widening it slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;That explains...&quot; His thought never got finished. Ellie joined him and now squatted in the grass in front of him. He heard the sound of liquid splashing onto blades of grass at the same instant the scent of powerful sex attractant pheromones from Ellie&#39;s tiny spray of urine smacked him across the face much like a physical slap.<br />
<br />
He stood there, doggie cock fully erect, his jaws open and drooling canine slobber into a puddle forming on the ground, and stared. He whimpered. A battle of will launched itself in his sex-addled mind.<br />
<br />
For Ellie, the decision, once made, left no room for doubt or deviation. She smelled the sex of her intended on the breeze and whimpered in confusion when he remained unresponsive. Resourceful, she had ways of forcing a response. Trotting to his side, she surprised him with a sudden awkward lunge as she mounted herself behind him and gyrated wildly before a panicked Freddie threw her off and ran through the yard toward the backdoor.  He tried to repeat his previous trick with the knob. His concentration was understandably not at its best, but he got the knob between his front paws and tried to turn it. His efforts met with a loud click.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; His parents, as was their habit, had locked all the doors for the night.<br />
<br />
He heard the soft steps of Ellie&#39;s paws in the dew-coated grass. A few seconds later, she re-mounted him. He would have ran away again... should have ran away... but Ellie&#39;s gentle lessons in what he needed to do worked.<br />
<br />
His body knew what to do and began to do it. Freddie&#39;s lithe German shepherd form twirled away from her and then circled back. This time, he found himself the one mounting, getting his front legs around her furry sides as his back legs lifted him into a stance that allowed easy access. Colors exploded again in his head as his dick began hammering inside Ellie. In some distant, currently unused space of his consciousness, he realized he was fucking the neighbor&#39;s dog. And he liked it.<br />
<br />
The sensations carried him to a natural high that reminded him of the time he had smoked some grass in eighth grade with his then best-friend, Joshua Peterjohn, who had provided the joints. He kept hammering at the completely receptive Ellie and dimly felt a sudden tightness and squeezing sensation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot; Freddie whimpered. Freddie and his brother had never owned dogs and, until this recent change, Freddie  had never really given the subject of dogs much thought. Some important facts had simply never implanted themselves in Freddie&#39;s reservoir of basic knowledge.<br />
<br />
The crescendo rose with his eager, determined thrusts of his hard, sensitive dick. The colors melted with a massive white-out as Freddie achieved success with a long growl from the back of his throat as his doggie cock pumped and spurted.<br />
<br />
As he fought to get his panting and drooling under control, he prepared to slip out and...<br />
<br />
Freddie tugged. <br />
<br />
Ellie whimpered.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the...&quot; Freddie produced a panicky growl.<br />
<br />
He squirmed and twisted and found himself stuck. The biology of the knot had evaded the teenager&#39;s awareness and he had somehow managed to miss those groups of kids who laugh and point whenever two dogs would get stuck together during forays onto the schoolyard playground. So he had no idea that the period of being tied together for a short interval was perfectly natural with dogs.<br />
<br />
His only focus was on being stuck and quite possibly discovered in this extremely awkward position by his parents. He tried squirming free again, but the knot remained quite intact and his tugging actually produced some discomfort.<br />
<br />
In a flurry of thoughts, he debated his options. As he did, he reached a hand to his face and scratched his chin.<br />
<br />
Hand! Face? Chin!?<br />
<br />
Indeed, still supporting himself with one arm and hand on the grass, he stared at the other hand and its fingers held in front of his face as his paws shifted back into the pattern of human hands. His short pelt of brown and black fur retracted. The reversal worked itself quite rapidly. His canine snout sunk back into his normal face. The smells and odors that had been bombarding his senses became virtually undetectable. <br />
<br />
To complete the reversal, his tail vanished, as did his sheath. In very little time, he resumed his human form and discovered Ellie remained under him. In panic, he fell back, freed from his forced embrace with Ellie the instant his cock had changed back to human.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit!&quot; He was also naked in the backyard.<br />
<br />
Ellie whimpered, confused to say the least. &quot;Oh shit!&quot; Freddie said aloud as he looked at his recent four-legged conquest. Only he didn&#39;t feel as if he had conquered anything. If anything, the insistent Ellie had forced herself on him.<br />
<br />
He ran awkwardly to the backdoor. Ellie followed, rubbing herself against his bare legs. &quot;Shoo! Go home!&quot; Freddie scolded.<br />
<br />
He started to knock but then remembered the blanket. If he had to face his parents, he decided he would do it covered in the blanket his mother had provided for his bedding.<br />
<br />
As he walked, he felt like he was being choked. He reached a hand to his neck and found he was still wearing the dog collar. He stopped, unfastened the collar, and let it hang from his right hand. <br />
<br />
Once he returned to the carport, placed the collar on a shelf, and wrapped himself in the blanket, he still faced the problem of Ellie. He wanted the source of a confusing and prominent embarrassment absent from the scene. He grabbed Ellie by her own collar and dragged her back to the gate, unlocked fortunately, that admitted her back into her own yard. He would have to hope she didn&#39;t return to the hole soon.<br />
<br />
Freddie felt his face warming from the spread of color caused by the embarrassing prospect of facing his parents, but at least he would manage to do so while standing on two legs and, thanks to the blanket, not naked to the world.</p>
