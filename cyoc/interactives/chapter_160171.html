<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You looked at the suits. The zippers looked a bit too big, and you never were a particular fan of skintight suits. Nevertheless ones with high heels. You looked at the costumes, they looked a bit odd...And you didn&#39;t feel like wearing them. You felt that there was more to them than you could see, and you were comfortable not finding out what more there was to them. You looked back at the suits. Grey, red, purple, pink, blue, yellow, orange... They didn&#39;t look enticing. And all looked the same. The same ridiculous high heels and oversized zippers. No thank you.<br />
<br />
You looked at the walls of the alien wardrobe. &#39;&#39;Wardrobes usually have closets don&#39;t they?&#39;&#39; You pondered out loud as you walked over to them, a slight shiver running down your spine from the rather chilly temperature. You knocked on the wall, listening to their reverberation, it didn&#39;t sound hollow so you were unsure whether it was hollow on the other side. You looked over the wall. There were no visible door nor segmentation. You sighed, then walked over to the alien hangers where the skintight suits were, defeated. Then as you looked over which suit you would look less awkward in, you spotted an odd looking suit folded up on the floor of the open-aired closet.<br />
<br />
You looked down at it. Musing out that it was dark grey with pieces of grey... Armour plates? covering parts like a harness. The dark grey material had odd patterns segmenting it at different parts. Unfolding it you look over it. Noting how it seemed to have some sort of &#39;&#39;tail&#39;&#39; on it&#39;s back. The suit looked capable of easily fitting you but it looked a bit too large. But that doesn&#39;t stop you from being interested. &#39;&#39;If these are really advanced suits, then maybe they could fit me even if it looks too big?&#39;&#39; You mumble to yourself as you look for an opening. Looking at it&#39;s back you could see an opening. The only opening was the hole for the head, and it was large enough so that you could put it on through it.<br />
<br />
You look over it one more time. Noting that instead of high heels the suit seemed to have boots instead thankfully. You were mildly happy with your choice, and so you put the suit down and put your left foot into it, sliding it down the left leg  and setting it down into the boot where you could feel your foot getting secured, yet it still felt a bit too big. Could be that it adjusts itself more correctly after it&#39;s put on fully. You slide your other foot down the right leg and feel the boot secure it. Then you lifted thesuit up and slid your arms into their respective places. The gloves felt a bit odd, but you didn&#39;t mind it particularly much. You then awaited the automatic adjustment of the suit. After several seconds you raise an eyebrow and look to see if somethings missing. <br />
<br />
You notice the grey plate secured around your wrist having a blinking red display. You look more closely at the display, noticing it displaying several symbols. You were confused what it meant. Then the symbols disappeared as the display stopped blinking. Displaying a white square surrounded by red. You looked quizzically at it, confused what it wanted you to do. You shrugged and decided to press it. To see what it did. Maybe it was a confirmation for the suits adjustment? You could only ponder before you felt a sharp pain from your back. <br />
<br />
Releasing a sharp, surprised grunt you shoot your arm to your back to where the sharp pain originated from, rubbing it as you cursed through gritted teeth. You noticed how you began feeling warmer, You felt like you were growing oddly enough too. Then you let out a hiss as you couldn&#39;t help but bend over slightly as you felt something coming out of your rear, sliding into the previously limp piece of the suit. You were confused at what was happening. You felt your body then stop growing as you felt the suit get comfortably tight. You looked down and noticed how your height had increased and the fact your neck had gotten longer. <br />
<br />
You let out another hiss as your eyes hurt, blinking rapidly you noticed everything getting blurry before clearing up, then becoming even clearer than you could previously see. You felt your mouth and nose push out as your teeth started falling out, feeling your skin drying up and your hair beginning to fall out in clumps. You leaned against he wardrobe wall as you endured your transformation. Your nose and mouth haven pushed out into a snout with razor sharp teeth and venomous fangs while your body was covered in smooth black scales. <br />
<br />
Your sides and snout covered in dark grey scales while black scales covered your back and top of head along with your underscales, travelling up your neck to under your snout. Also, the sides of your neck acked a bit as two large flaps extended outwards, the insides covered in white with black slits in the middle. Then you felt the changes being done as your tail fully extended into the suits tail. You were in partial shock at this. But shook it off as you wanted a better view and walked over to the mirror in the wardrobe. <br />
<br />
Shocked at how you knew how to walk instinctively without falling backwards due to your tails presumably very heavy weight. You looked at yourself in the mirror. Staring into your own glowing reptilian amber eyes for a while before shaking your head. Your admired how fiersome your head looked. Your rather large tail swaying back and forth, mere centimeters from the floor. You noticed how you looked admirably sexy for a anthropomorphic snakewoman.<br />
<br />
Looking down at your body you could see your wide hips with your bubbly butt standing firm under your thick tail. Your breasts having increased to a double D-cup and standing firm as well, covered nicely in the black material. You then noticed several red lights from the grey armoured harness shine dimly. You put your gloved hand on your hip and looked at your mildly attractive and protected look. You reared your head to the door, then decided you were mildly ok with becoming a snakewoman as you walked to the door, stopping halfway as you looked back at the open-aired closet where the other skintight suits still hang. <br />
<br />
You noticed something sitting fairly camouflaged against the wall in the obscured corner not far from where the suit had originally lay folded up. It looked like a rifle of sorts. You walked over to it and picked it up. Noticing the white and black colourscheme and a small line of symbols you didn&#39;t understand under what you assumed was the scope. Your lifted the rifle and set it against your shoulder and grabbed ahold of it&#39;s grip wit ha finger on the trigger. Your other hand serving to stabilize the rifle by holding onto it&#39;s handguard. Aiming down the sight you could see it adjusting automatically to something more suited for the environment. <br />
<br />
Lines of symbols were present on a small display located not far back from the scope. Some of the symbols were larger, presumably a bullet count? You shrugged and lowered the rifle. Noticing it&#39;s sling which you pondered on. Then you came with a desiscion and slung it over your back, fitting the sling itself neatly between your boobs. You looked back at the mirror and liked the fact you looked both sexy and fearsome. You liked the feeling and smiled. Then you walked out the door, seeking the lizard.<br />
<br />
After a small while of walking around you finally found the lizard in the control room. A large curved and angled window exposing the vast void of space. The final frontier. The lizard herself sat in the captains seat about right in the centre of the room with a wide control panel in front of her. dozens of screens were throughout the room, displaying all sorts of information presumably, not that you understood any of the symbols. You approached the lizard form behind. Noticing how she seemed oblivious. You were mildly confused. Then looked down and stomped lightly with your boots, noticing how they didn&#39;t make any sound. <br />
<br />
You looked back at the lizard whom was still just working with the control panel. You pondered what to do and decided to tap the lizard on the shoulder. Then as you touched her, her entire body jerked as she froze immediately, then quickly turned around and looked at you with a shocked expression. She stayed quiet despite opening her mouth for several seconds. &#39;&#39;Uh?&#39;&#39; You mutter as you looked mildly confused at her. Then she finally spoke. &#39;&#39;Who are you?&#39;&#39; She asked confused. You didn&#39;t know how exactly to answer her question. &#39;&#39;Um, im the human you teleported aboard and made female.&#39;&#39; You answer, she looks narrow-eyed at you, as if suspicious of your believability. <br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;Uh, you then lead me to your wardrobe. Where i found thisssss sssssuit folde-.&#39;&#39; You begin explaining just to try and make yourself more believable. &#39;&#39;OH! Oh. Oh, you found that old suit?&#39;&#39; The lizard interrupts with an expression of sudden realization. &#39;&#39;I knew i recognized that suit and gun.&#39;&#39; She said, as if trying to explain her sudden realization to you. You merely nod. The lizard then laughs, then sighs as she leans backwards. <br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;That there is an old combat suit that an old friend of mine used. It&#39;s unable to adjust to more or less any being like more modern combat and civilian suits, so it uses an old genetic manipulation factor to adjust whatever being wears it to sufficiant proportions in relation to it&#39;s original wearer. Humerously enough, those suits are much more protective than modern combat suits, although much more bulky and doesn&#39;t make the wearer as agile as modern suits, also doesn&#39;t support personal shielding but thats exceptionally bulky and weak it doesn&#39;t really matter.&#39;&#39; The lizard drifted off.<br />
<br />
You felt a little curious. &#39;&#39;Sssssso, do you know where your friend isssss now?&#39;&#39; You asked. &#39;&#39;No. I lost contact with her when we parted ways. She left behind her gun and suit, and now you&#39;re wearing it.&#39;&#39; She smiled without worry.<br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;Now let&#39;s............&#39;&#39;</p>
