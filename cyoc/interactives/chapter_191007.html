<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John headed inside the mall. The big red and white letters of the health store seemed to call his name. Even though he&#39;d never really bothered with one before, he almost felt drawn to it. Something about his new body was probably going there pretty often. It still hadn&#39;t been an entire day since he&#39;d given himself his new athletic body, yet he kept forgetting just how big and strong he was. Muscles were built all over him. His shirt hugged his chest and arms. Even his abs could be seen partially through it. <br />
<br />
One of his hands naturally ran down those defined muscles. &quot;Might as well figure out what I need to do to keep you,&quot; he said. It didn&#39;t matter that he was a gym coach, he&#39;d never really put much stock in protein powders. Sure, he&#39;d used some weight gainers to get some of the football guys to go up in weight, but nothing that really help him. He was a coach in mostly name only. <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to Protein Powerhouse,&quot; the guy behind the counter moved closer. He smiled handsomely at John. It was obvious this guy worked out. He was a bit over 6 feet tall and built with lean but defined muscles. His shirt clung tightly to his chest and shoulder and the soft breathable shorts formed nicely around his rear. &quot;What are you looking for today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhhh...&quot; John looked around the shop. He didn&#39;t realize there was so much to choose from. Dozens of large five gallon jugs with different colors, brands and labels. Then there were even more differently sized and shaped containers lining the walls and on tables. &quot;I&#39;m not really sure. &quot;Not really sure. Never really shopped for something like this before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really.&quot; The other guy said. He looked absolutely stunned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really,&quot; John nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really bro? There&#39;s no way you don&#39;t know your way around here. I figured you&#39;d already had your mind made up. I mean,&quot; he looked up and down John. &quot;Just look at you! You&#39;re built like a fucking truck!&quot; He caught himself. &quot;Sorry. I mean...&quot;<br />
<br />
John smiled at the complement. He almost felt a bit embarrassed with just how genuine the guy was being. &quot;Thanks,&quot; he nodded. &quot;But can you just give me a second.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing man. Take all the time you need. Just let me know when you&#39;re ready,&quot; he went back to the counter. &quot;By the way, I&#39;m Jace.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing Jace,&quot; John said. He turned to his phone, opening up the Chronivac. Taking just a second to think about it, John typed, &#39;Every time he talks about gaining muscle or getting bigger, he&#39;ll grow a little bit more to his ideal size and shape. All the while getting hornier as the changes progress. Clothes won&#39;t grow and he&#39;ll be completely oblivious to the changes.&#39; John looked back up from his phone at the 20 something behind then counter. &quot;You like working out?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Heck yeah!&quot; Jace said. &quot;Absolutely love it! Makes me feel all swole. But I bet you know the feeling, eh?&quot; Already a little bit of the changes started to take place. Little veins ran up and down his arms as blood flowed through them just a little bit faster. A bit more definition was forming in his arms. He shifted his shoulders as the shirt pulled at him in an uncomfortable way all of a sudden.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess so. Don&#39;t know if I&#39;d say I love it, but I don&#39;t know of any other way to get bigger,&quot; John said. He wanted to keep the conversation light and friendly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still hard to believe that&#39;s all you&#39;ve been doing man. Can&#39;t get over it. But I&#39;ve got a couple of things to help make it even easier. Hell, you&#39;ll probably double in size,&quot; Jace smiled. He reached over to grab something off one of the tables. &quot;This-- MMPH,&quot; he grunted as a wave of pleasure washed over him. His arm shook, almost missing the product. &quot;Sorry bout that,&quot; he added. <br />
<br />
His body was starting to grow again. Pound after pound seemed to be adding onto him all at once. It was layered over his entire body, yet it was still noticeable. His shirt had already been skin tight. Barely any room for even air had been between it and his skin. But now it was starting to strain. The seams were stretching against his widening back. His chest looked heavier. A bit of skin was starting to appear between his shirt and shorts. Jace even fidgeted with his feet. Obviously they were starting to feel a bit cramped inside their confines. <br />
<br />
But Jace kept it professional. &quot;This,&quot; he held up the product. &quot;This will really help you gr-grow.&quot; His voice shook a little bit. &quot;It&#39;s fi--filled with all--all kinds of en--zymes and nutrients to help y-you achieve you--&#39;re goal.&quot; He was really shaking now. Putting the product back down, he gripped at the table holding it. The veins sticking out of his arms only seemed to bulge even more. Muscle packed on top of muscle. His body was going from the average gym goer to something far more professional. The large shirt that he was wearing was really starting to strain. More skin started to show off displaying the bottom set of his abs.<br />
<br />
One of his hands swatted at his dick. Something else that had clearly grown substantially as there was a hard rod running down the left part of his shorts. &quot;MMPH!&quot; he grunted, biting at his bottom lip to regain control. &quot;You could... Use this... To really gain... MMPH! Some more en-ergy. For. All. You&#39;re workouts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; John pretended he didn&#39;t notice anything strange happening in front of him. Even though Jace&#39;s shirt started to rip down his massive back. The fabric couldn&#39;t contain him anymore. It ripped right down the center.<br />
<br />
Jace let out a labored grunt as it continued to tear. His wide shoulders and thick chest grew even more, enjoying the freeness they now had. The cool air brushing against his pulsing body felt amazing. A light dusting of hair covered his pecs and ran down his firm abs. &quot;Ye-yes,&quot; Jace grunted out. He was having so much difficulty not touching himself. &quot;It&#39;s re-really gooooooood for wooooorkooouts. MMPH!&quot; His shoes were next as his toes pushed out of the front. There was no way those tiny spaces could hold his massive feet. They wiggled, happy that they were free from their confines.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then,&quot; John smiled. Jace was actively losing to his desires. The 20 something was almost openly masturbating in the lobby of the store now. &quot;I guess I might as well get it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;GGggoooood Chooooiiiice,&quot; Jace moaned. He tried to stand back up, but doubled over again. His hands unwilling to give up the massive meat they were currently jerking off. &quot;You&#39;ll beee ggrrrooww--- OH FUCK!&quot; he belted out as he came. It shot out of the bottom of his shorts and started to pool around his feet. Thick globs of cum rocketed out of him over and over again. &quot;Oh shit... Sorry man,&quot; Jace apologized. &quot;Don&#39;t know what came over me. Let me check you out and you can be on your way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing,&quot; John nodded, still pretending that nothing weird had happened. <br />
<br />
Jace finally stood at his full height again, He must have grown a 5 or 6 inches and easily gained over 100 pounds of rippling muscle. Sweat coated his skin, giving it a light shine. &quot;Guess I&#39;ll need to find another shirt... And some shoes...&quot; he joked.</p>
