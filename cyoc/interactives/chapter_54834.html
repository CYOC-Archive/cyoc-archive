<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you shift your head around the attic, you notice a fairly small yet dusty photo album. You reach over and grab the album, pulling apart many old cobwebs in the process. After blowing off a great amount of dust, you quickly opened the old album. In it you see many different photos of Jack as a child. As you turned the pages, you notice that many of the photos were just of him doing pointless things. Boredom started to creep up within you as you continued through the album. As you shifted to a new page, a particular photo grabbed your attention. It was a photo of a young Jack with someone else, however part of the photo was missing making it difficult to determine who that person was. You flipped to the next page, and noticed that more photos suffered the same phenomena or worst, completely cutting out the person in the photo. You finally got to the last page where a lone portrait of a preteen Jack was up against someone you couldn't make out due to it also being cut.<br />
<br />
You smell a familiar odor and turned around to see Jack walking up to you. &quot;So this is where ya been the entire time. What you doin' up here anyways?&quot; asked Jack as he leered over your shoulder. &quot;Hmm? What's that you got there?&quot; You slowly closed the album. &quot;Oh, just some album I found lying around. Hehe.&quot; You replied. &quot;Album? You mean those old music record things?&quot;, Jack questioned. &quot;No [dumbass], I meant this photo album here.&quot; You turned and showed him the album. &quot;Ah! Th-that ol' thing!&quot;, Jack sputtered and quickly snatched it from your hand. &quot;Don't go ponderin' through my stuff like that, hear!?&quot;, shouted Jack. &quot;Woah, I'm sorry! Dang.&quot;, you shout. Jack neatly places the album on top of a high shelf. <br />
<br />
You figure this would be a good time to ask him about the strange photos. &quot;So what's up with those photos at the end?&quot;, you asked. &quot;Wuddya mean? There was just somethin' in them I didn't like. That's all.&quot; He murmured. &quot;Oh, really?&quot; You said as a matter of fact. &quot;Yeah, but enough 'bout that. Why don't you get yer ass down from here! Don't touch any of my stuff without askin'!&quot;, He lectured. &quot;Alright, alright! Calm down, big fella.&quot;, you sneered as you rolled your eyes and cross your arms.<br />
<br />
Jack proceeded to climb down the ladder first. As you walked towards the ladder, you cautiously glanced back at the album. A small breeze <br />
ushered through a boarded up window nearby and way slowly made its way through the attic. Your mind became affixed on those photos and you started to began feeling a little light headed. &quot;Hurry yer ass up, will ya!?&quot;, shouted an angry Jack, breaking your trance. &quot;Y-yeah, I'm coming.&quot; You replied while climbing down the ladder and closing the attic hatch. As soon as the darkness shrouded the attic, the inside of the album scarcely began to glow.<br />
<br />
You find yourself dusting yourself off as you walk downstairs towards the living room with Jack when suddenly mother nature called. &quot;Hey, man. Mind if I use the bathroom real quick?&quot;, you asked. &quot;Whatever, just use the one downstairs.&quot;, he replied. &quot;Alright cool.&quot;, and with that you scurried to the bathroom. You turned on the light and, as expected, the bathroom was absolutely filthy. Used toilet rolls piled up next to the bathroom sink. The cracked tiled floor was completely stained with mud, dirt and other various grime you can't make out. There was a leak at the corner of the wall with the water falling into a rusted old steel bucket filled with garbage and what not. The water in the bucket produced and highly vile scent and appeared brownish in color. You creep away from the bucket and lift up the grungy toilet seat to find several turds and a large amount of used toilet paper afloat. You moan in disgust at the sight. &quot;Dang, Jack! At least flush the damn thing, christ!&quot;, you wailed. &quot;Fuck off, cunt.&quot;, he starkly replied. <br />
<br />
You flush the toilet and unzip your fly, letting it all go. For some reason, your urine shot at a completely different angle than expected hitting the side of Jack's toilet and the wall. You freaked out and adjusted your wanker properly. It was getting awfully warm in the bathroom as you wiped your forehead with your free hand. You began to ponder what you drank today as it was an awful lot of urine coming from your bladder. Once done, you quickly clean yourself up with the last bit of clean toilet paper and zipped your fly. You panicked at the mess you made at the side of his toilet and grabbed a very filthy rag nearby. However, you hesitated to clean it as upon closer inspection, you can see remnants of Jack's own urine around the same area. It's pungent odor was utterly rancid, shielding you from entering the territory. &quot;Man, fuck this.&quot;, you say as you drop the filthy rag on the floor. You get up and wash your hands in his cracked sink. As you wash, you glance in the mirror and notice the sweat piling up across your forehead. You splashed your face in the water, bathing away the access sweat while also cooling you down a bit. You turn the faucet off, wipe your hands clean with your shirt, and exit the bathroom, returning to your seat next to Jack on the couch. <br />
<br />
He glanced at you for a bit then fixated his eyes back on the TV. &quot;You had some trouble or sumthin'? You got yourself a wet spot there I see.&quot; Surprised, you look down at your crotch and indeed see a rather large dark spot exposed on your jeans. You sigh deeply as you you tuck your shirt over it in embarrassment. Jack smirked. &quot;Heh, happens to me all the time. Don't worry 'bout it.&quot;, he admitted while reaching for an open can of beer. <br />
<br />
&quot;*Gulp!* *Gulp!* *Gulp!* [sigh], so why'd ya come here anyways?&quot;, he questioned. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eh, I was just in the area. Y'know, just curious to see how my &quot;old friend&quot; was doing.&quot;, I replied.<br />
<br />
Jack belched loudly towards the TV, reached down in his crotch and scratched his balls. &quot;Tch! Curious my ass. You here 'bout that money I owes ya, huh?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, since you brought it up-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now listen here. I already gone and told ya's when I plan to pay ya back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Saying &quot;I will soon&quot; doesn't distinctively qualify as a precise date Jack. I didn't lend you some of my tuition money just to help you fill your table with cheap beer and pizza boxes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack sneers at you and chugs another can of beer down his throat. &quot;Look, I have an interview with the manager at the food mart. Can ya lend a guy a few more weeks?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;[sigh] You said that the last time...&quot; You think for a moment about him and sympathize. &quot;Alright. 2. more. weeks. Jack. That's all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack grins at you, lays his sweaty hirsute arm around your neck and smiles, &quot;..and that's why you're my best friend!&quot;. The scent of his foul breadth and drenched armpit looms across your nose. &quot;Um.. yeah.&quot;, you say as you push Jack away from you. You wipe the increasing sweat off your face once again. Concerned, you ask Jack, &quot;Hey did you turn the heat on or something? It's getting kinda hot in here.&quot; Jack shakes his head, &quot;Heat? Ya know, I don't have any air conditionin' fixed up in here.&quot; &quot;Oh, right.&quot;, you say exhaustively. Jack tosses you a can of beer. &quot;Here. Maybe this'll help ya cool down.&quot; You snap it open and begin chugging it. Surprisingly, it was remarkably good; much better then your average cold beer. You stop and ask, &quot;Hey, this ain't to bad. Where did you get it from?&quot; &quot;Eh, some liquor depot downtown that opened not to long ago. It's nothin' special if you ask me.&quot; You finish downing the can and you belch slightly. &quot;I think this is actually pretty good. Toss me another one.&quot; Dumbfounded, Jack looked at you in surprise. &quot;Damn, you drunk that fast. Here.&quot; He tossed you another can and you chugged it equally as fast. Your belching was starting to get louder. &quot;You feelin' alright?&quot;, asked Jack. &quot;Other then this heat, I'm feelin' fine. Really fine.&quot;, you babbled in a drunken stupor. &quot;Toss me another one, Joe.&quot;, you drunkenly ask. &quot;Uh, right..&quot;, he replied as he slowly reached for another can.<br />
<br />
The night continued with you and Jack drinking in front of the T.V. watching old Hannah-Barbara cartoons and ESPN. As it was getting late, you decided you wanted to drive back home. Jack, however, wouldn't let you leave the house in such a drunken state. You begin to throw a loud tantrum, but after awhile you fell asleep on his couch. Completely knocked out. The next morning..</p>
