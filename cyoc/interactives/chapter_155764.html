<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Waking up the next morning, Josh followed the instructions that Joe had written out for him. They were slightly different then the ones he had to follow for weekends, but while Josh enjoyed the physical exertion, the food was still just as bad. However, even if Josh would have been overjoyed to eat something sugary for breakfast, he loved his brother enough to follow the plan.<br />
	<br />
After finishing his meal, Josh quickly got into the shower. Letting the warm water wash away the sweat and grime he had accumulated while exercising, Josh made sure to take some time and enjoy his brother’s large member. When Josh got his body back, he knew that this would be the one thing that he would miss. The only consolation he had was the fact he would be able to enjoy his own pee pee like this in a few years.<br />
	<br />
Getting out of the shower, Josh examined himself in the mirror. Wide shoulders tapered down to a narrow waist with two large square pectorals and eight defined abs. His arms hung at a slight angle because they were forced to fight for room with his flaring back muscles. Veins snaked down his arms, which ended in two large meaty hands, calloused from years of physical activity. With two column like legs that were as thick as Josh’s body’s waist, Joe’s thick cock hung down next to two egg sized balls. A thick bush of pubic hair surrounded the cock and balls with a trail of hair leading up between his abs but stopping before reaching Joe’s pectorals. Joe’s square jaw and crew cut only heightened his masculine appearance.<br />
	<br />
Rapping a towel round Joe’s waist, Josh went to his brother’s room to find his body sitting on the bed. “Hey Josh. How are you doing this morning?”<br />
	<br />
“A little scared.” Josh’s replied honestly. “What if I can’t pass as you? Or if I have to take a test, I don’t want to fail.”<br />
	<br />
“I know what you mean. I’m nervous too. But you should be okay. I don’t have any test scheduled today, and if you keep your head down, I don’t think anyone will notice a difference. What I am concerned about is football practice this afternoon.”<br />
	<br />
“What do you mean football practice? I can’t go to that. We have to go and pick up the broken console.”<br />
	<br />
Getting off the bed, Joe walked over to the bag that held his equipment and said, “If you don’t go, people will be suspicious. You have to go, but don’t worry, as soon as I get home, I will walk over and get the console. We can change back right after practice.”<br />
	<br />
Still seeing the concern in his eyes, Joe asked, “Is there something else?”<br />
	<br />
“Well…I’m not sure I know how to put on your stuff.”<br />
	<br />
Joe smiled slightly. “Then why don’t I show you now. That way you won’t have any problems this afternoon.” With those words, Joe explained how his pads and uniform were worn and even had Josh put them on and take them off.<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
Walking into the front of Joe’s school, Josh could not help but look apprehensive. While he liked that he was taller then the vast majority of the people he saw, he still felt like he was only a kid, visiting a high school. Fortunately, Josh did not have any problem with the classes he had to attend. Only once did he get lost that morning, but was able to cover by saying he was about to use the bathroom.<br />
	<br />
At lunch, Josh saw a table with some of Joe’s friends, so he sat down and pulled out the lunch that Joe had prepared for him. Chicken breast, broccoli, and rice. Josh started eating with a grimace. About half way through lunch, Josh noticed some girls joining them. Just looking at them caused Josh to become aroused. Not sure what to do, Josh quickly finished his meal and headed to the bathroom.<br />
	<br />
It was the end of the day. Josh walked into the locker room to see many of the other players getting ready for practice. Going over to a locker with his last name written on a label, Josh opened it and pulled out the equipment he had placed there that morning.<br />
	<br />
Going slowly, Josh did so that he would not make any mistakes. By the time he was finished putting on Joe’s football gear, Josh was one of the last in the room. Taking a deep breath to calm his nerves, Josh headed out onto the field.<br />
	<br />
For the next three hours, the football coach worked the team hard. Josh was forced to do numerous activities that while he had no memory of them, Joe’s body did. This allowed Josh to zone out and think about all of the different sugary foods he was going to eat when again in his body. It was only when he was practicing different plays that Josh had to concentrate. He had heard his brother discuss football to know some of the plays, but Josh needed to really think for him to execute them correctly. The few times he did not make the play, the coach was in Josh’s face, and for the next few minutes, the coach would work Josh extra hard.<br />
<br />
----------------<br />
<br />
Josh slumped onto one of the benches. He had no idea that you could ever be this tired. Even with his bigger body, Josh was exhausted. After dragging himself into the locker room, Josh slowly removed his uniform and pads. As much as he wanted to leave immediately, one quick whiff had Josh heading for the showers.<br />
	<br />
Standing under one of the shower heads, Josh, unable to stop because of curiosity,  was able to surreptitiously inspect the bodies of the other players. Sure Josh had seen some of his class mates after gym class without any clothes, he just never expected to take a shower with everyone in full view. Though one thing that made Josh very proud was the fact that Joe’s cock was just as big if not bigger then every other guy there.<br />
	<br />
Finishing cleaning his body, Josh quickly went and grabbed some clothes and headed home. What surprised Josh, as he walked down the sidewalk, was the fact that he did not feel as tired as he thought he would. Just taking a shower had given Josh enough energy back. However, Josh’s face slumped when he remembered his brother would spend at least two hours every night lifting weights. If the console was not fixed, Josh knew he would have to do the two hour routine.</p>
