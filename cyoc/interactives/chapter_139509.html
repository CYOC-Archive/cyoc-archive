<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Riley took wild Nick to the jungle park. As Riley used the regular routes and trails, Nick jumped to a giant tree and climbed it with relatively ease. The next few hours, Nick was vine swinging and playing with monkeys and birds. Riley was happy seeing his friend acting like a real life Tarzan.<br />
At sunset, Riley went to a nearby shop and bought something to eat and other stuff while Nick was eating fruits and bugs in the wild. People around him was watching him like an attraction in a zoo and throwing him chips and peanuts. Although he was having fun, Nick didn&#39;t like the idea of being treated like an animal and returned with Riley.<br />
&quot;Ook hoo hoo!&quot; Nick tried to speak to Riley but he just made monkey like sounds instead. He felt ashamed when people began to laugh at him after hearing that.<br />
&quot;Do you want to go back to our room, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Riley told him as he petted Nick&#39;s broad back. &quot;The candy effects should end soon.&quot;<br />
As Riley was saying that, Nick&#39;s tanned skin was returning to its regular hue. His monkey like feet became human and he immediately can stand up again. His simian expression and his wild hair turned back to normal too. However, he was still a hairy 20 something years old dude and not an 11 years old boy.<br />
&quot;Finally.&quot; Nick sighed in relief. &quot;What were you thinking? That wasn&#39;t funny!!&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey, calm down!&quot; Riley told him. &quot;I saw you enjoyed it, don&#39;t lie to me!&quot; Nick blushed, Riley was right, he had a good time as a jungle man.<br />
&quot;Fine, I enjoyed it a little.&quot; Nick grinned. &quot;But the next time told me before you turned me into a wild man!&quot;<br />
&quot;I will.&quot; Riley said. &quot;It&#39;s getting late, let&#39;s go back to our room, you stink!&quot;<br />
Nick raised his left arm and smelled his hairy armpit. He smelled like he hasn&#39;t taken a shower in months, he sheepishly shrugged and followed Riley although he was the adult of the two.<br />
<br />
While they walked he saw other men wearing banana hammocks like him but this time, Nick wasn&#39;t ashamed of not being enough big. He was ashamed of being way more bigger than them. His endowment was clearly visible through the fabric and it bounced side to side with each step he made. He thought of cover it but he knew it would catch more attention. He glanced at Riley who was walking happily. Of course, he has wearing jeans and an almost non-existing bulge.<br />
<br />
When they arrived to their room, Riley began to take off his clothing and grabbed a towel.<br />
&quot;I will take a shower first.&quot; Riley said.<br />
&quot;B-but...&quot; Nick said. &quot;I want to shower first! I reek like a monkey!&quot; He raised his arms but immediately put them down again when his bushes were on sight.<br />
&quot;Hey, it looks like this shower has two shower heads. We can take a shower together.&quot; Riley told him.<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; Nick blushed, he wanted to use his shower time to get used to his new body. He didn&#39;t want that Riley saw him naked looking like that. &quot;Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s inappropriate with me looking like this?&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey, we&#39;re the same age, remember?&quot; Riley grinned. &quot;It&#39;s not like you&#39;re a pedophile or something.&quot;<br />
&quot;But I&#39;m bigger and hairier.&quot; Nick replied.<br />
&quot;Nothing that I hadn&#39;t seen in a biology book or in this place.&quot; Riley said. &quot;Also, you are practically naked already. Your clothing leaves nothing to imagination.&quot;<br />
Nick blushed but knew Riley was right. It won&#39;t be much different being naked from how he is right now. He agreed to Riley and entered the shower with him, his face was close to the shower head so he has to duck a little instead of Riley who has the perfect height.<br />
He slowly and shyly took off his only garment exposing a dense bush of pubes that he hadn&#39;t yesterday. When his dick and balls were exposed he gasped, they were huge! Like a fat salami and big chicken eggs. He was shocked of how they hung low between his thick thighs.<br />
&quot;Nice set.&quot; Riley told him as he soaped his chest.<br />
&quot;Hey, don&#39;t look!&quot; Nick yelled at him and covered his manhood in his hands. But he realized he&#39;s getting an erection although he wasn&#39;t aroused. &quot;Shit! Not now!!&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not your fault.&quot; Riley told him. &quot;It&#39;s your banana hammock lock. You will be hard while not wearing it.&quot;<br />
&quot;No fucking way!&quot; Nick shouted. &quot;Are you saying that I have to wear the same fucking clothing all the time?! It&#39;s dirty now!! I won&#39;t wear that nasty thing!!&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t punished you.&quot; Riley said. &quot;If you don&#39;t want to wear it you can go around with that boner. It&#39;s big enough to make some grown men jealous.&quot;<br />
Nick didn&#39;t reply, he was so angry and embarrassed but it was useless to discuss with his friend about it. He took his shower silently, avoiding to look at the stiff pole between his legs.<br />
He took his time to soap all his body, it was his first time touching all of it. He put extra attention to where he was hairier, his armpits, his chest and his crotch. He grabbed his balls and felt ashamed that it&#39;s   really hairy there too. However, he was even more ashamed when he felt hair in his butt crack as well.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a fur ball.&quot; Nick muttered to himself.<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Riley agreed and Nick blushed after realizing he wasn&#39;t alone.<br />
<br />
When they finished their shower, Riley dressed up with blue jeans, a wifebeater and a red hoodie. Nick, however, wore just his dirty banana hammock again. He had to wear it to get soft and none of his other clothing will fit him anymore.<br />
&quot;You remind me of something.&quot; Nick told Riley when he saw his outfit.<br />
&quot;That kid from the day of the dead movie.&quot; Riley replied. &quot;I&#39;m going to a costume party and you&#39;re going with me.&quot;<br />
&quot;No way! I don&#39;t want to go out!&quot; Nick said. &quot;And I don&#39;t have a costume.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not a problem.&quot; Riley grinned and opened his right hand. A shiny black candy was there. &quot;This candy can turn you into a skeleton just like in that movie.&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot; Nick hesitated.<br />
&quot;It will take away those hairs you&#39;re complaining... Unless you want to stay and discover yourself...&quot; Riley smirked.<br />
&quot;No no no.&quot; Nick reddened and took the candy. Almost immediately all his skin and muscles began to disappear until he was just bones. His face took the cartoonish shape of the movie characters and just his eyes and the hair on his head remained. When the transformation finished he realized his banana hammock had fell on the floor and he was fully naked. He immediately put his bonny hands over his crotch.<br />
&quot;What are you hiding?&quot; Riley grinned. &quot;Skeletons don&#39;t have dicks!&quot;<br />
&quot;But I&#39;m naked!&quot; Nick yelled as a cartoon character.<br />
&quot;So?&quot; Riley asked him. &quot;No one will care. Come on, let&#39;s go to the party!&quot;</p>
