<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Before I begin,” Leon sighing as he looks at his daughter Jean and her mate Nate; “you two should at least head off to do what you wanted to do.”<br />
“No,” Regina glaring at her husband; “they are going to hear what you have to say. Plus,” the were-lioness giving off a low roar; “your daughter and Nate are the reason why I’m not trying to claw your eyes out.”<br />
<br />
Leon looks at his wife; sighing heavily as he takes a seat at the kitchen table. Regina glaring at him with her amber leonine eyes; absently flexing her retractable claws.<br />
“Well you better sit down,” Leon exhaling; “this is going to take a bit.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
While Leon was busy telling his wife along with Jean and Nate the recent siege at the jail he helped repulsed; Frederick Parker being arrested along with a few of his surviving cronies; Frederick was fuming. His one phone call and the man he got on the line was not wanting to help him.<br />
“I don’t care if you want your fee up front,” Frederick keeping his voice down; “remember I know all of your skeletons. What would your wife say if she got a copy of the photo of you and that crack whore you slept with? How did you explain to your wife,” Frederick chuckling; “that case of the clap you got?”<br />
“My wife already found out you idiot,” the man swearing back; “she left me. So I say again; I’m not representing you without a hefty retainer.”<br />
<br />
“Bullshit,” Frederick swearing back; “get your ass up in this hick town, or I’ll have your hide.” Frederick having to choose his words carefully as he was afraid this was a party line and a deputy could be listening in on the other line.<br />
“Good luck with that,” the man scoffing; “just to let you know, the Feds came to see me a few hours ago. They have photos of me coming out of that massage parlor that was raided here in Oakland yesterday,” the man grumbling; “they can’t prove I availed myself of the establishment’s services, but they are already threating to have me disbarred unless I help them go after you. So unless you have connections to make that not happen; go fuck yourself.”<br />
<br />
Frederick raged, getting hung up on as he tried to rip the payphone off the wall; he was stopped as the deputy that allowed him to make his one phone call quickly grabbed the mobster’s arm, gripping him tightly as he placed the handcuffs back on.<br />
“Let me go,” Frederick demanding; “you’re breaking my arm!”<br />
“Save your belly aching for the judge,” the deputy escorting Frederick back to the cells; “you’re going to be here awhile.”<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Sitting in a holding cell in Seattle, Daniel Parker had no idea the trouble his father was in. That the attempt to break him out of the Moon Lake jail was a complete failure. Being his usual stubborn and pig headed self; Daniel demanded his lawyer; refusing to answer questions or be let out of the holding cell until the man arrived. Watching as Agent Brooke Reed leaves.<br />
“Well this is fine mess I’m in,” Daniel mumbling to himself; “Take a deal to save myself and bury my dad, or face some serious charges. All from shooting that man, just for his sweet ride.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
“So does this mean that the were-alert is now lifted,” Jean asking after listening to her father speak.<br />
“Just because the man is now in jail,” Leon answering; “doesn’t mean we can all run around in our fursona and celebrate. Once word gets out that Frederick Parker attacked the police station; the press are going to be all over our town.”<br />
“Who in the town is going to squeal to the press,” Regina sighing at what she just heard.<br />
“Frederick for one,” Leon growling at the name; “his lawyer, the gazette will undoubtedly publish what just happened. That will get picked up by the other news outlets.”<br />
“So we get through one crisis,” Regina shakes her head; the fight in her gone.<br />
“And run smack into another,” Nate speaking up; “is there any good news to be had?”<br />
“Peter wants to come home from the hospital,” Regina answering; “go pick up your son, Leon.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Lance Knight, editor in chief of Moon Lake Gazette and sole owner of Knight media; a company comprising of various media outlets up and down the pacific coast and the were-club. Entering the gazette and heading to his office, Lance sees Ella furiously at work on her computer; the mayoral announcement regarding Kenya Adaeze-Crawford going belly up thanks to the reporter. The edition of tomorrows paper giving an in-depth detail of Kenya’s past as well as Jack Crawford’s questionable activities.<br />
<br />
“So how is your article for the mayoral announcement going,” Lance letting Ella know he was there.<br />
“It’s going great,” Ella smiling; “with this and the expose on the Crawford’s, those two will quickly find themselves wanting to leave town fast.”<br />
“The sooner the better!”<br />
<br />
Both Ella and Lance turn around to see Takibana along with Daisuke approaching after getting off the elevator.<br />
“Your security guard at the main entrance wasn’t around,” Daisuke commenting; “so we let ourselves in.”<br />
“Probably doing rounds,” Lance answering; “so why are you here?”<br />
“Frederick Parker,” Tachibana answering while looking at Ella; “perhaps it is best we should talk in your office. Part of this conversation is elder council related.”<br />
“Oh,” Lance looking concerned; “does this have anything to do with that explosion we heard earlier?”<br />
“It does,” Tachibana following Lance to his office; “Daisuke please make sure the door is closed.”<br />
<br />
Lance watched as Tachibana took a seat at a nearby chair while Daisuke stood at the door; making sure it stayed closed and no one could get in.<br />
“Frederick Parker tried to break his son out of jail,” Tachibana speaking.<br />
“What,” Lance looking stunned; “When?”<br />
“During the Crawford boondoggle,” Tachibana responding; “Daisuke can fill you in.”<br />
<br />
“I only observed the tail end of the event,” Daisuke speaking up; “but what I do know is this, the men that assaulted the jail were professionals. Yet they had the misfortune of being overwhelmed with the full staff of Moon Lake’s police force.”<br />
“Did any of the deputies,” Lance asking but unable to finish his sentence.<br />
“Only Frederick’s men were killed in the attack,” Daisuke answering; “the few that didn’t die quickly surrendered.”<br />
“And what about the mob boss,” Lance sitting at his desk; “did he die?”<br />
“He would of if he ignored my family’s sword,” Daisuke looking serious; “I made sure he was arrested by the sheriff before he could press his attack any further.”<br />
“Well this is going to make the paper rather thick tomorrow,” Lance chuckling; “the whole town will be jumping for joy now that this man is behind bars.”<br />
“We’ll talk about that in a minute,” Tachibana speaking; “but this is the important bit. Leon Talbot was present during the attack and was assisting Sheriff Cooper. Apparently both got wind of the planned assault,” Tachibana sighing; “as such, Sheriff Cooper had Daniel Parker transferred to the custody of the FBI and he is currently in Seattle.”<br />
“And Leon agreed to that,” Lance looking stunned; “after his son got shot by the man himself?”<br />
“From what the sheriff said,” Daisuke cracking a small smile; “he had to slap the were-lion around to make him see reason.”<br />
<br />
“Which brings us to the next part,” Tachibana getting up; “while I know you are the were-panther rep on the council…”<br />
“Until Frieda turns twenty one,” Lance reminding Tachibana.<br />
“I’m aware,” the were-vixen speaking up; “I’m also aware you are a reporter as well. What happened at the police station is huge news wise. Please keep the town’s secret in mind when reporting Frederick Parker’s arrest.”<br />
“I will,” Lance answering; “I’m not keen on our existence being revealed to the world over.”<br />
“Certain details should also be omitted or revised,” Daisuke speaking; “such as my involvement, limited as it may be.”<br />
“Also,” Tachibana pausing before continuing; “once the major news networks get wind of Frederick Parker’s situation, they are going to descend on our town. The were-alert will undoubtedly continue until they and Frederick leave.”<br />
“So much for the make-up picnic this Saturday,” Lance shaking his head.<br />
“Let’s hope that the FBI will want Frederick before then,” Tachibana answers; “once he is gone, the press will also go away.”<br />
“Anything else,” Lance looking despondent.<br />
“Be at the council building for ten tomorrow,” Tachibana nodding to Daisuke; “we have the matter of Jack and Kenya to deal with. I gave them both a summons to appear.”</p>
