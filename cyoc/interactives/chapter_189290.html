<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Helen didn´t stop wailing for over ten minutes, Ty decided to move on with everything. He had just to make sure that she wouldn´t do anything that would bite him now. He also wanted to make sure she wasn´t alone.<br />
Seeing as Buster, their dog, was still sitting under the table, impassive about what had happened to his family, Ty had an idea. Aiming the phone, he had gotten from Frank to shot a picture, which he had used for all the regressing before, he was quick to snap another picture, this time mostly of Buster, but part of Helen´s leg was also there. Ty made sure the change was something else this time.<br />
When the light cleared, there wasn´t a dog underneath the table, but a young man around Helen´s current age, looking asleep. He was casually dressed, similar in fashion to Helen but for a man. A loose blue shirt, dark jeans, grey socks and shoes. He still wore his old collar, a black band with a silver buckle at the back of his neck.<br />
Buster slowly opened his eyes, as he felt something was off with him. His position was suddenly rather uncomfortable. As he looked around, he didn´t know why he was uncomfortable, as lying under the table was normal for the dog. Only when he saw that he now had hands he clumsily tried to get out from there, all while saying in a rough but deep voice: “Hands? Why do I have hands? What?” <br />
After a bit of work, Buster finally got out from under the table, sitting right in front of his still wailing owner. As he hadn´t been part of the pictures before, he had no idea what had changed, so he didn´t remember anyone as his owner beside Helen. He approached her, trying to calm her with his presence by putting his fore-paws, now hands, up in her lap, and by that, also onto her full belly.<br />
Helen stiffened as someone touched her belly, fearing that it could harm her family inside her. There had to be a way to get them back, but only if they were unharmed. She was sure of it. Looking down towards the hands, she spots a young man, different from the boy that had taken their pictures, looking up at her with big eyes. What caught her attention before she could scream at him for not touching her was the familiar collar around his neck. “B… Buster?” she whispered in shock.<br />
Buster smiled at her, and missing his tail to wag, he did so with his whole ass. “Yes, mistress. Calmer now?” It was somewhat cute to watch, at least for someone uninvolved. <br />
Helen continued to look at her former dog in shock. All this was just crazy, right? She was getting crazy.<br />
Ty chooses her silence to say something: “I thought you needed a new partner for your quintuplets. Raising them alone wouldn´t be good. And your dog was fitting.” He then grinned at her.<br />
Helen´s head swung up, facing the boy who was responsible for all that happened. “Please, just give me my family back. I didn´t do anything to you to torture me like this. I can´t be with my dog, even if he is human now.” She didn´t scream in anger but had spoken at a normal volume, sounding defeated and confused. But Ty could also see the panic was still there, as she feared losing her family.<br />
Buster also turned to look at the boy, and growled at him. That was the reason for his owner being so distressed. <br />
Ty shook his head, slowly raising the phone as he answered: “No, I won´t. It will come back on its own when you birth them again. But don´t worry, it won´t be a problem to be with your former dog, and the only torture you will have to endure is birthing your children again.” And with that said, Ty shot another picture.<br />
This time, it affected both the now human Buster along with Helen. Helen did forget that she ever had a husband or kids before, only being engaged to the young man kneeling before her to look at her pregnant belly. The one time they had forgotten protection, and he had gotten her pregnant with not one, but five kids in one go.<br />
Buster, in turn, gained a full human mind now, forgetting he was a dog minutes ago. He was now engaged to the one he had just seen as his owner and mistress seconds before. The woman he loved, and had already gotten pregnant.<br />
Ty smiled as he left the happy couple to themselves. He had made sure that, at least for now, neither Helen and Buster, nor their soon to be born children Frank, Susie, Alex, Katie and Billy would remember anything that happened. In a few years maybe, but not now. <br />
With that, Ty went looking for another target to change, slipping his new phone into his pocket.</p>
