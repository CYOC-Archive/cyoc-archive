<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Back at Lucile&#39;s home, Raul was recovering from his ecstasy moment. He was as dizzy as Toby was when he awoke that he barely can stand up.<br />
&quot;Mom?!&quot; Raul said. &quot;Where are you? I don&#39;t feel good...&quot;<br />
But he didn&#39;t get an answer. Lucile was too busy in the bathroom that she didn&#39;t hear his son&#39;s manly voice. What was she doing there?<br />
Raul began to walk through his house, he was too dizzy that he hadn&#39;t realized what had happened to him. His body felt like a rock which he was trying to move with difficulty. He didn&#39;t even care about where Toby was or the last moments before he fell on the floor. His big feet were crawling on the carpet as he can&#39;t lift his meaty legs. His broader shoulders were colliding with the walls and when he tried to go across a door frame he saw that he can&#39;t do it without hitting somewhere of it.<br />
Finally, he was able to go to the kitchen which had a small door to the backyard and a big window which gives a good sight of his neighbor&#39;s house. On the kitchen&#39;s table there was a lot of things that Raul didn&#39;t recognize. Weird-looking glass bottles with shining colorful liquids, an old photo camera and a lot of paper things. Also, there was a jar with cold milk which Lucile had used to trick the former kids before. Raul took the jar and put some milk in a glass. He thought that drinking something could help him to overcome his dizziness. He was going to drink it when he heard a loud noise coming from the window. He walked to it and saw his neighbor&#39;s kid, Joel, mowing the lawn.<br />
Joel was a year older than Raul, but they didn&#39;t get along very well. Joel liked to mock of Raul and to take his things without permission. Also, Raul thought that he was a little nasty and brute, as he liked to burp in public or farting if he needed to. <br />
Raul kept standing in front of the window looking at Joel until the boy look him back.<br />
&quot;Hey, dude!&quot; Joel shout. &quot;Nice bod!&quot;<br />
&quot;Thanks!&quot; Raul answered without being sure if he was making fun of him.<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot; Joel said. &quot;I haven&#39;t seen you before around here! Are you Raul&#39;s cousin?&quot;<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Raul didn&#39;t hear well what Joel said and he thought that Joel said just Raul, so he nodded.<br />
&quot;And what are you doing there shirtless?&quot; Joel said. &quot;Oh, well. It&#39;s a hot day after all!&quot;<br />
Raul was surprised. Joel had never talked to him like that, but he didn&#39;t know that Joel had grown in a big family and to talk to grown ups like that was more usual to him than to talk with kids of his same age.<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; Joel said. &quot;I am a little bit thirsty! Don&#39;t you have something to drink?&quot;<br />
Raul, still in his dizzy state, just could think on the milk he had on his hand.<br />
&quot;I have this glass with milk&quot; Raul said. &quot;I can give you if you want it!&quot;<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; That&#39;ll be fine!&quot; Joel answered. &quot;Can you bring it to me? I don&#39;t want to see your cousin if you know what I mean... I don&#39;t know if I should say this but as I feel I can trust you I will tell you that your cousin makes me feel a little bit uncomfortable...&quot;<br />
Raul didn&#39;t understand that and said instead. &quot;Wha.. why?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, in my former house I used to be the only child. So, I grew up with people ten or more years older than me. Hanging out with kids it&#39;s still new to me. But, hey, I feel more confident with tough guys like you!&quot;<br />
Raul was leaving his home, he was having a few troubles to move his new and massive body because he didn&#39;t get accustomed to it. On the other hand, Joel continued mowing the lawn and he didn&#39;t care too much of Raul&#39;s approaching. When Raul finally was next to him, he extended his arm and offered the milk to Joel.<br />
&quot;Take it, Joel!&quot; He said with his manly voice.<br />
&quot;Thanks dude! I&#39;m too thirsty!&quot; Joel said, but when he turned his face to look at Raul, he surprised of his nudeness. &quot;Wow! You must be very very hot! You are completely nude!&quot; Joel said. &quot;But, don&#39;t worry! You don&#39;t have anything I hadn&#39;t seen before!&quot;<br />
&quot;What are you...&quot; Raul tried to say, but instead he look at himself. &quot;Am I naked? I&#39;m naked!&quot;<br />
&quot;Calm down, pal!&quot; Joel said. &quot;Don&#39;t be afraid of yourself! In the farm where I lived, being naked and to fight in mud was one of the best things I could remember! You&#39;re very well built, I wonder if I could have a chance against you!&quot;<br />
&quot;Well built?&quot; Raul said as he recovered from his dizziness. Then, he remembered what happened before. &quot;My arms! My chest! My body!&quot; He shouted scared.<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve a good looking, pal!&quot; Joel said while he was drinking the milk. &quot;And that salami you have is as big as the stallions&#39; ones in our farm! Hahaha!&quot;<br />
Raul moved his head in order to see what Joel was refering about. Between his legs, a pair of strong and long legs, a big meaty tuve was hanging under his chest. He tried to take his dick at the moment, but instead he touched one of his balls. He realized that them had changed too into a huge pair of hairy lemons. They couldn&#39;t fit in his kiddy hands, but with his now bigger and manly hands it wasn&#39;t a problem,<br />
&quot;Dude.&quot; Joel said. &quot;I don&#39;t have problem if you want to stay naked. But if you want to touch yourself, it&#39;s better if you&#39;re inside. Come on, you can go to my house. My parents went to the farm, so I&#39;ll be alone for a couple of hours. I almost ends mowing the lawn. So, go inside and I will be there in a minute.&quot;<br />
Raul was still scared of his own body but he knew that he can&#39;t be outside naked and showing it. So, he didn&#39;t think too much about it and accepted Joel&#39;s offer. He walked to Joel&#39;s house which was very similar to his own house, and he entered into the kitchen.<br />
Inside there was a large window similar to the one in his house where he could see Joel&#39;s mowing the lawn.<br />
&quot;What happened to me?&quot; Raul said to himself. &quot;Where all these muscles and hair have come from? And my balls, they&#39;re huge and bouncing all the time!&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m almost done.&quot; Joel shouted. &quot;I just need to pee and I&#39;ll be with you in a second!&quot;<br />
&quot;My hands! my feet!&quot; Raul said. &quot;I&#39;m like a bigfoot!&quot;<br />
Raul was lost in his thought when he heard an odd sound. In the lawn, Joel was pissing right next to where the lawn mower was. He remembered how nasty Joel was, that he wasn&#39;t surprised about it. Raul gave a glance at Joel and thought.<br />
&quot;Joel is very endowed for his age...&quot; Raul kept thinking. &quot;He is bigger than me...&quot; And Raul&#39;s dick shake a little bit as if that comment was an offense to it. &quot;Well, now. I think he can&#39;t be bigger than a grown man...&quot; He surprised of thinking of himself as a grown man, but he looked like one now and that was an obvious thought to everybody.<br />
Raul stop thinking when he saw that Joel hadn&#39;t stopped pissing. He must be fully charged, Raul thought. But, again, he saw something odd in the boy.<br />
&quot;Is he becoming bigger?&quot; He thought as he saw that Joel was a little bit taller. &quot;And were his clothes so thight?&quot;<br />
On the lawn, Joel was feeling like if he was releasing a lake from his bladder. He was surprised on how much piss he was doing. He was lost on the moment, until he felt a sudden pressure on all over his body. He felt his body trembling as if his heart was pumping faster and his body cells were becoming crazy. He tried to touch his chest, but his pissing was keeping his hands on his dick. Meanwhile, in the kitchen, Raul saw how Joel had reached a 6&#39;6&quot; height, now he looked like a lanky kid but that didn&#39;t keep for so long. In a matter of seconds, and with Joel unable to do anything, his clothes begin to burst.<br />
Starting from his shoes, the small pair exploded to reveal two 14 size feet. They didn&#39;t look large and skinny, but manly, hairy and meaty instead.<br />
His shorts were too baggy that they could resist his growing legs for some more time, but they let to see the growing hair above them which grew to dense and manly like a bear.<br />
His stomach and chest inflated to barrel proportions and his skinny shirt burst in an instant revealing his growing muscles and hair. So dense that it looked like a thick forest.<br />
His arms grew too, pumping his muscles until they were as big as his legs, similar to gorilla arms. Hair grew in them too, and in his armpits, whose hairs where slightly visible even if Joel, had his arms down holding his dick.<br />
And his dick was the most interesting thing to change. As his hands had grew to manly proportions, his dick looked smaller in contrast, almost invisible inside the manly fingers. But in a couple of second, and with Joel still pissing, his dick began to inflate like a balloon to humongous proportions, until it was as big as a firehose. The pissing increased his intensity and after a few seconds, the powerful torrent reached its climax and bursted into a powerfull orgasm which released a big load of cum to the lawn mower.<br />
Joel stayed in there for a few minutes, recovering from the sudden arousal that he felt. After a few minutes, he gasped and recovered himself. Raul was astounded of how fast he recovered from that sudden rush of energy.<br />
&quot;Wow! That was an intense pissing session!&quot; Joel said in a very deep voice. &quot;I felt like a new guy!&quot;<br />
&quot;Certainly you are!&quot; Raul said as he was leaving the house. &quot;Give a look to yourself!&quot;<br />
Joel was a little confused about what Raul had said until he saw his new meaty and heavy arms and his big barrel chest.<br />
&quot;Wow! What happened to me?!&quot; Joel said. &quot;Amazing!! And my voice! I sound very badass! Hahaha!&quot;<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; Raul replied. &quot;Now you&#39;re almost naked... Let&#39;s find something to wear.&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you crazy!&quot; Joel yelled. &quot;Look at me! I&#39;m sure I&#39;m as hung as you!&quot; Joel saw that his shorts were still hanging on him. &quot;I won&#39;t need these shorts anymore! Men like us must be free!!&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t do that! I want to wear it!&quot; Raul shouted but Joel had already ripped off his shorts, reaveling a torn withey tighty which was fighting to covering a new adult package. Joel finished ripping it, until he revealed his meaty dong and a proper set of bull hairy balls to match to his new body.<br />
&quot;Hahaha! I wish that Raul can see me now!&quot; Joel said with a big smile on his face. &quot;He would be so jealous!&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m seeing it&quot; Raul answered. &quot;And I&#39;m not jealous at all...&quot;<br />
&quot;Raul? Is that you?&quot; Joel said and Raul just nodded. &quot;Well, of course you&#39;re not jealous. You&#39;re hung like a horse! My stallion pal! Hahahaha!&quot;</p>
