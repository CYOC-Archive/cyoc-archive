<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">           As you lead Tony into the dinner table (your nose wrenching in disgust as you smell his putrid scent) his eyes buldge out tremendously. To say he was impressed was a understatement. Tony was at this point completely awestruck. <br />
<br />
      Tony not waiting for you immediately sits down and starts to wolf down his food as if he hasn&#39;t eat in a week. You sit down and eat your food much more slowly as you start talking to Tony. Your past together was in the past, you may be a demon but that doesn&#39;t make you a savage. If he apologize you might let him live you decided.<br />
<br />
    &quot;So... Tony, I want to talk to you about something.&quot; You say, putting a piece of steak into your mouth. Tasty, but not as tasty as Tony could potentially be.<br />
<br />
          Tony barely nods as he keeps filling his mouth, you wouldn&#39;t be surprised if he was a gluttony demon himself. He ignored most of the vegetables on his plate as he took a massive bite off the baked potato you made, bits of food and saliva going everywhere from his open mouth. He nearly snorted as he chewed.<br />
<br />
     &quot;Anyway... Tony. We have both known each other for a long time and it&#39;s brought so many good memories back.&quot; You say, having involutanry hiss when you said the word good.<br />
<br />
            &quot;Tony. Remember that time you framed me for drawing a dick on some jock&#39;s car?&quot; <br />
<br />
   Tony nearly chokes as he hears that. Clearly he remembers given by his pig like laughter. Your anger grows, anyone with keen sight could almost see a dark aura of green flame surround you body as you manage to keep your emotions in check.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Or that one time where you knocked me out and put my unconscious body in the girls locker room.&quot; You continue.<br />
<br />
   At that Tony gives a hearty laugh, pounding the table with his greasy hand as he laughs.<br />
Tony looks at you, his eyes reminding you of high school. His eyes told you what he was thinking, you didn&#39;t need magic to tell you that. He felt in power again, he was knocked down a bit when he saw your amazing apartment, but now after reminding him of his victories against you in high school, he felt in control once more.<br />
<br />
     Swallowing a chunk of meat down his throat (Your advanced  hearing letting you hear the sound as it drops into his stomach) he replies<br />
&quot;Yeah I remember, and I don&#39;t regret a single thing about it bitch. You may have a fancy digs, you may have this delicious food! But I&#39;ve always been on top baby. Now I already know what you want me to say. You expect me to stoop to your level and be &quot;civilized&quot; about it. But I&#39;m not apologizing, in fact, I like this place. How&#39;s about this.&quot; Tony says, he at this point has angered you so much more now, all of the the stress, anger, jealousy you felt during high school returned in full force as he continues.<br />
<br />
  &quot;This place, I&#39;all give you credit Elric, it&#39;s pretty fancy, Is not sure how you made so much money but I&#39;m impressed. But. Now this place is mine. Your going to give me all of this property, your money, your belongings, the deed or whatever and everything else! Don&#39;t try saying no, cause if you do, well... I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;ll survive with your genitals intact.&quot;<br />
Tony threatens. Tony thinks he&#39;s in control, that he&#39;s winning. How wrong he is.<br />
<br />
       &quot;You must be a mind reader Tony, all that I was going to ask you to apologize.&quot; You say, standing up. &quot;Apologize now and get out, if you don&#39;t I&#39;ll make this place your next hell.&quot; You say darkly, now your anger was just at its climax. He better say no, for his sake atleast.<br />
<br />
    For a second Tony looked scared, as if he saw something in your eyes, something... strange, almost... demonic. You swore he was about to open his mouth to apologize. Then the fear faded as his mind told him he had simply imagined it. Then Tony laughed again, this time for nearly a minute.<br />
<br />
     &quot;Man, you almost got me for a second. Put on some muscle and you would be a pretty good intimidator. But... you know how this goes. Judging by your face your pretty mad. But listen up runt, here I&#39;m in charge.&quot; Tony stands up, purposely knocking his dinner plate to the floor, the plate shattering and the food going everywhere on the marble floor. <br />
<br />
     Well... you gave Tony a chance didn&#39;t you? It&#39;s a shame, if you were more calm you probably would&#39;ve gotten more pleasure out of it. Atleast the walls were sound proof.<br />
<br />
            Before Tong could react, you  snap your fingers, your illusionary clothing bursting as fur exploded out of your flesh, nails turning into claws, your face pushing outwards as you regain your muzzle. Finally you were back in your demon fox form, powerful demonic energy flowing through every inch of your body. Your furred muscles and body now towering over Tony.<br />
<br />
   With the speed of the ultimate predator you grab Tony with both arms and sinks your teeth into his neck, easily drawing blood and making him scream in pain.  However more than just blood leaked from his body. Tony&#39;s eyes and mouth started emitting a dark green light as you began to suck Tony&#39;s soul right out of his body. You savored it immensely. It was far more tasty than other souls you&#39;ve eaten in the past. <br />
<br />
            As Tony&#39;s body began to transform into that of a hellhound, you summon a portal into the abyss and throw him head first, hearing his savage screams as he is thrown into hell itself.<br />
<br />
<br />
           After closing the portal you begin to clean up the mess Tony made. After cleaning up you transform back into your human form, fur and claws receding as you gain a new idea.<br />
<br />
     Tony may have been a piece of cow manure, but he had given you a amazing idea. Recalling your dream you remember that you could either specialize in a specific sin to gain power or focus on all Sins. But, Tony reminded you of something. In society, there were always classes. There was a middle class, a working class, a high class, etc. Now was the time to make your mark on the world. Before you had your strange dream, you could only transform your victims into a weaker version of your demon fox form, however, now you could effectively design your own demons.<br />
<br />
<br />
          Not just change their physical appearance, but much more than that. You could change their abilities, magical powers, even make them ethereal and non solid. <br />
<br />
      You could do so much now. Now just gain power, but forge a new empire, one hidden within the shadows of the world, quietly watching and learning, purifying the world from the evil that grows around it.<br />
<br />
          All you had to do was come up with a plan and so much could be yours.</p>
