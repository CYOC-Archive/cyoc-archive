<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tommy thought about Andys suggestion to connect the glass-prisons for three days before deciding to do so. But he didn´t want to only connect two shoes, so he looked for other troublemakers to imprison. By the end of the following week he had found enough victims. <br />
The first two groups were similar to his brothers. One was the son of his neighbors with his two male friends, the other was the younger sister of a classmate with her two friends. Both groups caused trouble at home and in school.<br />
The third group was the so called &quot;kings of the playground&quot;, two pairs of siblings that had parents who believe everything their kids say. Everytime the get into trouble the would say the others started the fight and played themselves innocent. <br />
The fourth group Tommy put together from two pairs of teens that had much fun in annoying and humiliating other younger kids. Both pairs had nothing to do with each other before.<br />
The last group was the biker gang of their city. Because they were a group of ten, Tommy split them into two groups of five for the imprisonment. They bikers had fun in destroying and spraying, next to be loud with their bikes, so the whole city hated them. <br />
<br />
With his targets selected Tommy took his time to collect their data on Sunday. Finding all of them was easy, only the bikers were a little harder because they hadn´t a place where they hang out normally. After having collected everything, Tommy returned home. <br />
<br />
What he didn´t plan was that there was some burglar in his house when he returned, fallen into a trap that Tommy had put up with the Chronivac. He had locked his room to everyone but himself and his mother or someone he invited in by putting up the same freeze program he had used on his brother and his friends before. The burglar was horrified that he couldn´t move and more so when he heard the front door.<br />
When Tommy found him, he was surprised that someone had tried to break into his room. Seeing that he didn´t know the person before him he simply asked &quot;Who are you?&quot;<br />
The burglar stayed silent, only more panicking that he was caught. Not getting any answer, Tommy looked up what the Chronivac said about the person. &quot;So you are Frank McForster, a thief and burglar at the age of 27 and live alone.&quot;<br />
Shocked, Frank asked &quot;How did you know that?&quot;<br />
Tommy didn´t answer, he was already thinking what he would do with the man in front of him. He then decided that because of Frank is a thief he would be something to keep unwanted guests away from his house. &quot;Okay, I will just change you into something useful.&quot;<br />
With that he programmed the Chronivac to change Frank. With a loud ripping sound the back of Franks pants burst open, showing the big fluffy tail that had grown there. Still not able to move, Frank didn´t know what was happening to him. He felt itchy all over but wasn´t able to scratch himself. His feet ripped his socks inside his shoes while turning into paws. The same happened to his gloves, ripping away by his changing hands. The first thing Frank could see changing was his nose, growing longer with his mouth into a muzzle. He was to shocked to ask what happened to him. All over his body grow black fur while his back and legs bend the other way with a painful crack and a scream. Then both his arms and legs shorten to the same size.<br />
When the changes had finished, his body fell forward on all fours. &quot;You will be the guard dog of the house from now on. I will let you keep your memories, but you will always behave as the dog you are now, loyal to me and my mother. Goodbye, Frank.&quot;<br />
Frank screamed on the inside of his head, but the dog just trotted over to his master, shaking of his ripped pants, leaving his shoes behind. The only things he still wears are his shirt and a small necklace that was now well hidden under his fur, but Tommy had seen it before. &quot;I will need some things for you now, Franky.&quot; He had decided to let him keep his name, mostly. <br />
He then changed the necklace into a dog collar. Next he changed his shoes back on the ground into bowls for food and water, the shirt into a dog harness, his belt into a leash and the pants into a dog bed. The shreds of his socks, gloves and pants turned into dry dog food, being placed into one of the bowls. He would need to get more dog food later. After getting petted Franky decided to lay down on his dog bed.<br />
<br />
Tommy smiled at his new dog before remembering his plans before he had known Frank was here. So he used the Chronivac to let his chosen groups come here, to the front of his house. <br />
Everytime a group was complete, Tommy started the preprogrammed changes. One after another the groups did shrink, fall into on of the groups shoes which turned to glass and deformed around them. Tommy didn´t have any problems with someone watching, not even the other victims because the moment the shoe sealed itself all about the people inside it vanished from the memory of everyone.<br />
After all the groups were sealed away in their prisons, still having their memories about the outside and all, Tommy let  the shoes teleport into his room. He put the other two shoes in between them, letting it look like a flower with eight leafs. One by one they now started to lose their memories, Tommy had found a liking into watching the look on their face change from panic to happiness.<br />
When all their memories were changed, Tommy took some of his own old socks he had found a couple of days before start to change into tubes, connecting to every shoe at the heel to it. In the center formed a round room, to the shrunken ones it would look like a big hall. <br />
After the connecting area was complete, Tommy changed the heel of the shoes into doors and let everyone inside remember the other rooms and the interactions with the other people inside.<br />
<br />
The rest of the day he just watched the groups meeting each other, living their life. He only got out once when Franky wanted to go outside. He used the time to buy some dog food, too.</p>
