<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jamal feels like he fixed what he can for now. Tam will have to wait until Jamal can find a good time to unfuse her and Deena is still at home. Oh. And maybe he should defuse that fly-shaped stress ball when he feels like it. <br />
<br />
Speaking of Deena, wouldn&#39;t his over protective mom notice Deena was gone by now? It&#39;s been more than 12 hours. Huh. He guess that he been so worried about how Mom treats him that he didn&#39;t fully understood how she treats Deena. He always assumes that she treats her like an angel just like him. Mom does buy into everything Deena says. Or maybe Mom just forgot. Or maybe he is just thinking too much.<br />
<br />
Anyways, the last thing to do before lunch is over is to meet with Gen. <br />
<br />
Upon entering the cafeteria, Jamal noticed that there were no more lunch lines. That means everyone already got their lunch. After some looking around, Jamal finally found Gen sitting by herself on a lone table. <br />
<br />
Jamal couldn&#39;t believe it! For as long as he knew Gen, she always been sitting with her friends. Never alone. This might be his chance to talk to her!<br />
<br />
Jamal managed to strategically sit in front of her. To act cool, he took his sandwich out and ate it silently.<br />
<br />
For the next few minutes, the two ate their lunch silently.  But Jamal soon became worried about how much time was left before the bell rang.  If he let Lunch Time end before talking to her, he probably won&#39;t get a chance to talk to her alone again. So to start a conversation, he went with probably the most intrusive thing he ever said. &quot;Um, why aren&#39;t you hanging out with your friends? Aren&#39;t you always with them?&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite never talking to him before, she decided to humor him. &quot;Yeah. But today I just want a break from them. Even the best of friends need a break from each other every once in a while.&quot; She gave a sad smile.<br />
<br />
So she and her friends had a falling out huh? Most people would take advantage of this situation and try to get close to her but Jamal is starting to have second thoughts. He may not be able to fully understand her situation because he doesn&#39;t have much friends himself, but he CAN understand the need to be alone every once in a while. Now he REALY feels like he&#39;s intruding on her. But he also feels that this is his only chance to get to know her. This rut will probably not last for long and she will probably be back with her friends tomorrow. Her friends will probably try to keep him away from her after today. That&#39;s how it works on TV anyway. Well, this is his first and probably last time talking to her... he might as well take those first steps while he still can. <br />
<br />
&quot;Um. My name is Jamal. Nice to meet you.&quot; She just looked at him strangely.  Jamal mentally slapped himself. Idiot! No one introduces themselves that quickly.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when Gen suddenly giggled. &quot;It&#39;s nice to meet you Jamal. My name is Gen.&quot; That took Jamal aback. She was FINE with that bad delivery of words?!<br />
<br />
*BEEEEEEEEEEEEP*<br />
<br />
That was the lunch bell. Lunch is over. <br />
<br />
Gen stood up and then gave a slight bow to Jamal. &quot;It was nice talking to you Jamal.&quot; She gave a smile that could make angels swoon. <br />
<br />
But instead of replying, Jamal was mentally panicking. That was his only chance to talk to her and he blew it by taking too long. There are still so many things he wanted to say. He didn&#39;t even get to show her his powers!<br />
<br />
Before Gen could leave, Jamal ran around the lunch table and grabbed Gen&#39;s hand. &quot;Gen! Wait! I got to show you something before you g-&quot;<br />
<br />
SCHWOOOOP!&quot;<br />
<br />
A tug of the hand was enough for the glove to work. The loud sound could be heard as the world around the two teenagers faded to black.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Luckily, almost everyone has left the cafeteria when it happened. So no one witnessed or heard what happened. That didn&#39;t stop a concerned custodian from waking an uncouncous teenager on the ground. &quot;Miss... Sir... You got to wake up. This is a no sleeping zone.&quot; <br />
<br />
After some gentle nudging, the unknown teenager woke up. &quot;Uh....&quot; The strange teenager got up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lunch is already over. Wake up and get to class.&quot; The custodian should be sending this student to the nurse&#39;s office, yet he or she seems to know what their doing...<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. Thank you. Bye.&quot; The strange teenager sprint walked to the nearest restroom. The same one that Jamal and Craig was in just a few minutes ago. As soon as he/she got there, he/she made sure no one was there and locked the door. The mysterious person went up the nearest mirror and gasped at what they saw. Staring back at him/her was what a child of Jamal and Gen would look like if he/she was a teenager. All of his/her characteristics were a balanced combination of Jamal&#39;s and Gen&#39;s. This also made the newly fused/born person look very ambiguously gender neutral. There&#39;s just the right mix of boyish and girlish characteristics that it&#39;s hard to tell if this person is a boy or girl. For example, Gen&#39;s caramel-colored skin became a lighter color thanks to Jamal&#39;s white skin. Gen&#39;s C-cup breasts also became flat B-cups. It was hard to tell if he/she even had breasts with how flat they were. This gave the newly fused person a tomboy or a tom girl look.<br />
<br />
Jamal and Gen&#39;s cloths has also merged together. His/her pants was a pair of short jeans that goes right below the knees. The rest of his/her cloths were sorta of a mix between Gen&#39;s style and Jamal&#39;s style. Not too revealing but not too not too normal. What made Gen look gorgeous mad this new person look like a tomboy. Oh, and Tam pensile is still in his/her pocket.<br />
<br />
This new person stood at a height between Jamal&#39;s 5&#39;10&#39;&#39; and Gen&#39;s 5&#39;7&#39;&#39;. He/she is now 5&#39; 8.5&#39;&#39;.<br />
<br />
Man, it&#39;s getting tiring referring to it self as he/she. He/she doesn&#39;t even have a name. He/she was born when Jamal and Gen fused together so... He/she guess that the name Gemal will have to do until he/she comes up with a better name. <br />
<br />
Speaking of which. What gender is he/she? Gemal draped his/her crotch and felt Jamal dick down there. But Gemal felt that there was something more... Gemal went into one of the toilet booths. Gems then preceded to take off his/her shorts. It seems Gemal is wearing what Gen&#39;s panties would be like if they were boxers. So basically pink, frilly men&#39;s boxers. After removing those, Gemal was shocked to find out that he/she Jamal&#39;s dick and Gen&#39;s Virgina underneath. Gemal is a hermaphrodite. But what gender should he/she refer him/herself by? Well, This all started with Jamal&#39;s fusion gloves so maybe Gemal should refer him/herself as a guy. For now any ways.<br />
<br />
So what to do now? Gems was born when Jamal and Gen fused together. As a result, he has both of their memories. He also has the sinking suspicion that he has a combination of their personalities as well. But he is not either of them. He is his own person who happens to look like a very feminine looking guy.<br />
<br />
But he knows what he has to do. Jamal and Gen deserves their own lives. Gemal was just a sad result of their endeavors. Gemal decided to defuse himself. Jamal and Gen doesn&#39;t deserve having their lives stolen away from them. So Gemal began pulling himself apart. As he tugged at his skin, the pain intensified a thousand fold. It was like he was pulling his essence apart. It felt like he was committing suicide after being born for a few minutes... NO!!! Gemal stop pulling at himself. He can&#39;t do it. Or rather, he doesn&#39;t want to. He wants to LIVE dammit!<br />
<br />
That was the last straw. He got to get out of here. But... were will he go? He doesn&#39;t  know if either of Jamal&#39;s or Gen&#39;s folks would accept them in their house. </p>
