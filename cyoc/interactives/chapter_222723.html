<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle took longer to dry off than he wanted to, gingerly touching all of these new legs, trying not to think about who&#39;s they were as he touched them, even though he could feel every inch of them, he couldn&#39;t stop thinking of them as his mom&#39;s. He stepped out into the hall, shaking, disgusted and disturbed by what he had just done in the shower, he walked into his bedroom and opened the top drawer of his dresser. In the drawer were not only his old boxers, but a ton of panties made just for his new legs. Kyle groaned, grabbed the appropriate amount of clothes, and started putting on the underwear, shuddering as he felt the silk slide up each of his smooth feminine legs. He searched the lower drawers for clothes he could be comfortable with and found his old shorts, but everything for his new legs were tight, and very short gym shorts, daisy dukes, yoga pants and what looked to be sweat pants but were tight enough to be yoga pants, leaving nothing to the imagination.<br />
<br />
He walked over to the wardrobe and found nothing better, skirts that would show off the curves of his new asses, business slacks that were a size slightly too small, full length jeans that would still show off his asses. “DAMN IT! I DON&#39;T WANT TO LOOK AT THESE LEGS ANYMORE!” He screamed to no one, shaking with disgusted rage he finally made a move. “FINE! FINE! I&#39;LL WEAR THE FUCKING SHORTS! ARE YOU SATISFIED CURSE?” He grabbed six pairs of tight gym shorts and roughly put them on, fed up with trying to decide on a set of clothes. Having dressed he stomped his way out into the living room, feeling every inch of plump flesh jiggle and shake as he went, and sat down on the love seat. He stared down at his now crowded lower half, the twelve legs nestled against each other, the love seat having barely enough room for them all to sit, his side asses being pressed up passed the arm rests, the legs shifted around on their own, trying to get comfortable. His front pair straddled him again, he tried moving her again and again, but it seemed they would only sit comfortably in the missionary position. He turned on the tv and tried not to think about the legs, absently he found his hands resting on the front set of his side pairs asses like arm rests on a couch, he tried not to think about who&#39;s asses he was touching. What would she think of this?<br />
<br />
An hour went by and he heard the door open, his with a shaky nervous panic as if he was going to be in big trouble he stood up and walked into the kitchen to meet his mother.<br />
<br />
“What a day, Kyle I can&#39;t tell you how glad....” His mother stopped and stared at him mouth agape. “KYLE! LOOK AT YOU!” She sounded gladly surprised, this was not the tone he expected. She quickly walked over then around him. “You look wonderful honey! Why my legs though?”<br />
<br />
“Um... I um...”<br />
<br />
“No, don&#39;t tell me, you admired your dear old mom and wanted to surprise me with this gift! Oh look at  you!” She started touching his new asses as if she was feeling a skirt&#39;s material. “Oh to be this young again! Oh honey, you really do look terrific! I can&#39;t believe it! This is the best gift I could be ever be given!”<br />
<br />
“R...Really?”<br />
<br />
“Yes! To think that my son was thinking of a make over, and decided to put on not a pair but six of my legs! And.... Oh! What are these?&#39; She reached down and gripped both of his cock, they went hard in her hands. “OH MY GOODNESS! WELL AREN&#39;T YOU JUST A SIZE QUEEN!” She laughed with delight. Kyle for his part was very disturbed by this, her behavior shouldn&#39;t be so admiring, she should be upset, it&#39;s almost like.... oh yeah, the curse. “Did you play with you new parts yet?”<br />
<br />
“Um...” Kyle blushed deeply.<br />
<br />
“Oh, honey, I love you too!” She kissed him on the cheek, “So how long are you going to keep these? A  week, maybe two?”<br />
<br />
“um... forever.” Kyle mumbled.<br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, um.... their permanent.” Kyle said a little louder.<br />
<br />
“OH MY GOD! HONEY THIS IS GREAT!” She hugged him hard, “YOU&#39;VE MADE MY DAY, IF NOT MY YEAR!” She practically started crying, “You love me this much to keep my legs with you?”<br />
<br />
“Yes... Yes mom I love you that much.” Kyle lied, not about loving her, but wanting to keep the legs. “I just wanted to make you happy, so I um.... decided to try on some of your “stuff” and it feels so right I&#39;m going to keep them.”<br />
<br />
“Oh you couldn&#39;t have made me more proud! My son, wanting to be like fashionable like his dear old mom! Thank you Kyle, you make an old woman feel pretty again!” She stopped humming, “I&#39;m going to go get a shower, then make dinner, maybe you can go.... enjoy yourself for a bit, eh?” Before Kyle could respond she turned, practically dancing through the apartment, singing to herself, Kyle shuddered, Jen&#39;s curse was already uncomfortable, this made it even harder.<br />
<br />
During that evening his mother was beaming, he hadn&#39;t seen her smile this much in years, and it made the condition he was in a little easier, he had to sit in the love seat to eat dinner, since the kitchen chairs couldn&#39;t support the weight of his new anatomy. He went to his room a little earlier than usual, his mom making another remark about having a little fun and not worrying about being loud if he knew what she meant, he mock groaned, not really wanting to lower her spirits he put as much fake sarcasm into it. After he got into his bedroom, shut and locked the door he collapsed on the floor against the door, the mess of legs tangled itself in front of him, he started crying, how could he deal with this when everyone thought he was normal, he punched random sets of legs several times wincing at the pain. Finally getting himself together he practically crawled over to the bed and just lay there for a while, feeling all of the new flesh pressed against each other and trying to ignore it. <br />
<br />
An hour or two went by and he felt himself getting horny, his old habits of marathon masturbation on a Friday night coming back to haunt him. He was getting sickly horny when he finally gave in, practically ripping all of the clothing off of his legs he turned to lay on his back. “Am I really going to do this? Willingly fuck my mom?” Kyle hesitated for a few minutes. “Well, they are my legs now. And she did give me permission to enjoy myself with them....” Kyle breathed deep and started his musings. He moved his male ass into position and gingerly inserted the cock, he hadn&#39;t pushed too deep the first time, but this time he was doing this for real, so he shove it deep, and soon found the cock buried to it&#39;s base in his ass, he moaned softly, and started to move the legs in front of him into position, this time he tested the flexibility of them, and found he could practically straddle his own hips and ride himself as if she were sitting on him cowgirl style. He pressed his front cock into his pussy, pushing deep inside and hitting the back wall of the pocket that it had, he moaned in a slightly higher pitch, the cock was tight, it hurt a little, but he wanted more. He experimented with the side legs, finding he had an innate knowledge of how to manipulate the muscles of their pussies to make them masturbate without touching them.<br />
<br />
“I...If I&#39;m going to do this.... I want to go all the way.” Kyle panted as he reached both hands around the front side pairs asses and pressed his finger into their pussies, and that set him off, he started pumping, moving just his pelvis up and down, pistoning both of the cock in and out of both his ass and his front pussy. He moaned loudly, not caring any more, he started moving harder, his hands slipped mostly into his motherly pussies he was lost in bliss, he ground himself hard, nearly hurting himself in the process he finally cam, moaning loudly with obscene pleasure, rocking side to side as he felt all six pussies spasm, and both cocks erupt. Shaking, sweaty and breathless he slide the cock out of his holes, cum oozing out of both, all of his legs were shaking with pleasure, and he finally felt a little less awkward. A few minutes later he heard a knock at his door.<br />
<br />
“Y...yeah?” He said feebly. The door cracked open. <br />
<br />
“I&#39;m glad you like them honey. But next time, try not to play with yourself when I&#39;m trying to sleep. I have to be to work in the morning.”<br />
<br />
“Oh... heh...” Kyle looked over at the clock and saw it was midnight. “Sorry mom.”<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s okay, I&#39;m glad your happy, goodnight honey.”<br />
<br />
“Goodnight.” Kyle was still a little uncomfortable with this exchange, but unlike Jen, he was a bit more open to strange fetishes, he reached down and put his hands on his front ass. “Thanks mom, I needed that.” He recoiled at his words. “What am I saying? That&#39;s my ass, thanks Kyle, we needed that.”<br />
<br />
Kyle didn&#39;t sleep that night, he got a shower and found himself sitting naked in his newly changed gaming chair, his luscious  legs crossed and sitting in random positions as he lounged, occasionally he reached down and caressed two of his side pussies, causing a cascading effect as he continued to play with his body parts, he ground his cocks against his flesh, but not burying them into his holes like he had earlier, having clad them in some silk stockings to keep the cum off the floor, it felt amazing. By the time his mom had left for work in the morning he had masturbated nearly twenty times. He finally lay down in bed after a quick wash of his privates, the legs now feeling less alien and more like a cozy harem of lovers, he sighed, finally somewhat comfortable with his new anatomy, he wondered how he would deal with this and fell asleep.</p>
