<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;This isn&#39;t what I ordered...&quot; Rachel said as she pulled out a football jersey. It was the same printing as the one of the school Kyle was currently going to. She held it against her small body and it nearly went down to her knees.<br />
<br />
Kyle let out a laugh seeing the giant shirt pressed up against her tiny body. It looked like it was something that would almost be too big for his offensive line sized body. At 6&#39;6&quot; and a bit over 300 pounds he&#39;d usually been one of the biggest guys on the team but even this seemed to large for him. &quot;Thinking about joining us out on the field?&quot; he smirked. His large body crossed the room and nuzzled his bearded face against the soft skin of her neck. <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; she played back. Her lips pressed up against his. Rachel was probably the best girlfriend Kyle had ever had. No other woman had ever wanted nearly as much sex as she had. &quot;Why don&#39;t you go see what I got you and then you&#39;ll find out.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Kyle smirked as he broke a way. &quot;You got me something too?&quot; he cocked an eyebrow completely unsure what it could have possibly been. Looking down in Rachel&#39;s box he was a bit concerned as it wasn&#39;t just a jersey that she seemed to have gotten, but rather the whole deal with pads, leggings, cleats and a helmet. Kyle reasoned it off as some kind of joke and she was probably going to receive that later. <br />
<br />
&quot;I did,&quot; she smiled broadly as she pushed him to the bedroom. &quot;You go get ready and I&#39;ll be in, in a second.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok,&quot; Kyle couldn&#39;t take the wild smile from his face. On the bed was a box labeled just for him. &quot;She didn&#39;t,&quot; he smirked seeing the same box label as hers had been. &quot;Did she really?&quot; he slowly started to tear it open but was a bit confused as to what it was supposed to be. It was some kind of uniform but he couldn&#39;t quite recognize it. The colors were the same as his school&#39;s but the clothes were built for someone half his size. Holding the shirt up to his arm, there was no way he could get it in without tearing it completely apart. <br />
<br />
&quot;The hell?&quot; he questioned again. But the realization of what it was finally dawned on him. It was the same uniform as the cheerleaders but the male version. He pulled out the pants that were stopped between his knees and feet. There was no way he could get this on. He turned around. &quot;Babe?&quot; he questioned seeing her dressed head to toe in the football uniform she&#39;d gotten. Everything but the cleats. But it was odd. It didn&#39;t look as big on her as he thought it should have.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you like it?&quot; she asked. <br />
<br />
Kyle felt like he was frozen. His mind was screaming that something was off but he couldn&#39;t quite get a grasp on what it was. Ray standing there in the doorway seemed to be what was making him nervous. And a little horny. It was like each second he was growing more and more into the giant oversized uniform. That even just standing there he was getting bigger and bigger, filling the doorway. His shoulders filled out the sides of the jersey more, like they were perfect for tackling the opposition. His chest swelled more and more while a bit of a belly formed underneath it. The leggings weren&#39;t held up by the pull strings but rather his thick quads and ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did I get it too small again?&quot; Ray pulled off his helmet reveling his stern masculine face. A thick but trimmed full beard rounded his squarish jawline while the hair on top of his head was just as short. He held the helmet under his arm and seemed to almost pout at the fact that he may have made a mistake.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Kyle was taken aback as to how confidently he said it. Holding onto the shirt it suddenly didn&#39;t seem so large. He shook his head trying to rationalize what was going on but it didn&#39;t seem to help. &quot;I&#39;m just going to go try it on...&quot; he grabbed the box and headed towards the bathroom. As he passed his boyfriend he realized that Ray wasn&#39;t just getting bigger, he was getting smaller.<br />
<br />
A quick slap to his ass made Kyle forget what he was thinking. &quot;I knew you&#39;d like it,&quot; Ray bragged. His deep voice permeated every part of Kyle. He leaned his large arms over Kyle&#39;s shoulders. Ray wasn&#39;t just growing. He was shrinking. There was a weight difference between them and every second, it seemed to grow ever more prominent. &quot;Go try it on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle naturally picked up the box and headed for the bathroom. His mind was abuzz with the thought of playing as football stud and cheerleader. But something seemed off. Wasn&#39;t he supposed to be the football player? He looked in the mirror at his tone body. There wasn&#39;t a bit of bulk on it. He was strong and defined but trim and cut, better for flexibility than actual size or raw strength. He slid off the shirt he was wearing, recognizing it as Ray&#39;s due to it&#39;s size, and slid on the sleeveless uniform shirt.<br />
<br />
He raised his arm and gave the solid bicep a flex. The 15 inch round arm wasn&#39;t small compared to most guys but right now all he could think about was the powerhouse of a man in the other room. Ever since he started cheerleading he&#39;d always stared at the guys on field while he was over there stuck with all the girls. It wasn&#39;t bad, he could get along with them fine, but the football guys would always go for them instead of him. Then there was one day Ray came up. He spoke to him. <br />
<br />
Kyle had thought it was some kind of joke or prank. There was no way that someone like Ray would be interested in him. He could have had his pick of nearly all the girls on the team but he chose Kyle? It was probably the best day of his life as they made out in the locker room after everyone had left. Even now he could feel himself getting hard over the idea again.<br />
<br />
Then a knock to the bathroom door brought him back down to reality. Ray opened it up and pushed Kyle&#39;s back against the sink. &quot;I&#39;m sorry bud.&quot; Their lips locked while their tongues wrestled with each other. &quot;I know you like to play a little before... But I&#39;m so god damn horny,&quot; Ray muttered in between breathes. He hefted Kyle&#39;s 180 pound body onto the sink and continued running his thick hands over the smaller man&#39;s body. Every inch of Kyle was now his to do with whatever he wanted.<br />
<br />
It took every ounce of willpower for Ray not to just start fucking him right then and there. He knew how much Kyle preferred a bit of foreplay but pre was already leaking out of his cock and falling down to his feet. His hands stayed close to Kyle&#39;s ass, ready to pull him forward. All he needed was the signal. Kyle broke the kiss and gave him a nod. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck yeah!&quot; Ray celebrated as he pulled Kyle&#39;s ass off the bathroom sink and onto his dick. Kyle held tightly to his thick shoulders and neck while Ray fumbled with his cock. For some reason it felt oddly small. Like it hadn&#39;t been there. He ignored the feeling and managed to get it in. Feeling Kyle&#39;s body loosen it&#39;s grip, Ray pulled him in even closer. Their eyes locked for a second until Ray seemed to hit a special spot sending Kyle&#39;s head back, roaring in pleasure. <br />
<br />
Ray cocked a grin enjoying how much Kyle enjoyed his ride. The cheerleader was a perfect little toy for his cock. Ray could fairly easily lift his body up and down pleasuring himself but he could see the amount of pleasure running through his face as he dipped another inch deeper into his asshole was just too much. He loved the loud boisterous moans and groans coming from his boyfriend. Though it was getting too much. He&#39;d already been so horny and now he couldn&#39;t control it anymore. He leaned Kyle&#39;s back against the sink and unloaded deep inside his ass.<br />
<br />
Thrust after thrust more and more cum shot up deep inside of Kyle. The sensation must have been too much for him as well as his cock throbbed and then unloaded onto his perfectly cut abs. Slowly Ray started to come down from the high and leaned in to kiss his boyfriend. &quot;Sorry bout that bud...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think you need to apologize,&quot; Kyle smiled back.</p>
