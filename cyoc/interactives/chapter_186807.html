<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Casseus and The Boss stood within the city square, a satisfied smile upon their faces. &quot;Commander report.&quot;<br />
<br />
A Normal soldier now approached, giving a salute as he began to speak. &quot;Sir,&quot; he said. &quot;Our forces have pushed the kitsune back. We are beginning our final assault on the palace.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Resistance?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The foxes are stubborn but we&#39;ve been able to counter. We calculate 30% of the population has been neutralized.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thirty percent,&quot; Casseus whispered in awe.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have received reports of their allies rallying to their aid,&quot; the commander continued. The Boss simply nodded, that was to be expected. When this operation was over they would deal with the kitsunes allies. &quot;Press the attack commander, none leave the cities limits alive.&quot; Saluting the soldier now sprinted back to his troops, leaving Casseus and the Boss alone. <br />
<br />
Or so they thought.<br />
<br />
Gazing out across the plaza, the two watched as a lone figure began to emerge from the smoke. &quot;Well I&#39;ll be,&quot; the Boss stated. &quot;If it isn&#39;t the head honcho of the kitsune.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tatsu furrowed his brow, his sword at the ready, as he glared at the two men that had brought so much death and destruction to his people. The smug arrogance of these two was almost palatable. They would pay for what they had done.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you&#39;ve come to surrender I appreciate that,&quot; the Boss stated. &quot;Save me the trouble of hunting you down later.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tatsu growled, tightening his grip upon his katana. &quot;For a millennium I have protected my people,&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;I have beaten Mongols, demons, and all manner of would be conquerors. You shall be no different.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; the Boss stated happily. &quot;You want to go? Well, this is going to be fun.&quot; The Boss now made a motion with his hand, Tatsu watching as a platoon of soldiers emerged from the shadows. &quot;Take him!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tatsu readied himself, the soldiers leveling their rifles before unleashing a hail of gunfire. The divine kitsune simply smirked, humans and their guns. Leaping into the air, Tatsu now summoned forth his magic, useing the very elements of nature to strike his opponents down. Wind, lightning, and balls of flame streaked outwards sending the soldiers scattering. As the divine kitsune landed he noticed a squad of soldiers barreling towards him. With a stomp of his foot, the ground now split open, sending the soldiers sailing into the air.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that the best you have human,&quot; Tatsu growled.<br />
<br />
Tatsu glared at the hooded Boss, watching as the red eyes beneath narrowed. &quot;Okay you have some skill,&quot; he grumbled. The Boss now produced a pair of uzis from beneath his robe as he opened fire. Much to everyone&#39;s surprise a wall of rock now appeared between Tatsu and the Boss. Curiously Tatsu glanced behind him, shocked to see a teenage boy standing next to him. &quot;Darren?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t let you kill everyone,&quot; Darren screamed. Tatsu grinned, thankful to have the Catalyst by his side. &quot;I thank you Catalyst,&quot; he said. <br />
<br />
&quot;So whats the plan sir,&quot; Darren asked as he watched the Normal regroup.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take care of the soldiers Darren,&quot; Tatsu stated. &quot;I shall deal with these two.&quot; Darren nodded, concentrating his magic on disarming the Normal as Tatsu now darted forward.<br />
<br />
The Boss and Casseus now began to focus on the vengeful kitsune lord. Casseus began to fire blasts of energy, the Boss letting loose with a torrent of lightning. Tatsu simply deflected all of it. Magic, bullets, lightning, all were brushed aside by the enchanted katana of the divine kitsune. As that occurred Darren occupied any Normal soldier that looked to get in Tatsus way. <br />
<br />
Darren was useing the power of his ring to transform soldiers into anything he could think of. Soldiers reduced to infancy, soldiers turned to stone, soldiers even turned into maid droids. Darren was straining himself trying to defeat them.<br />
<br />
Casseus stepped forward, he was the last line of defense protecting the Boss. As Tatsu sprinted forward, Casseus looked to strike with his spear, only to have his weapon deflected. Tatsu delivered a vicious punch to the wizards midsection before kicking him through a nearby wall. Glaring at the Boss, Tatsu could see shock and fear in his beady eyes.<br />
<br />
The Boss now tried to attack, raising his weapons, only to have them cleaved in half by Tatsus blade. &quot;Get back,&quot; the Boss bellowed as he unleashed a torrent of lightning. Tatsu deflected that as well, straining as he advanced. Finally close enough the divine kitsune backhanded the Boss, sending him sprawling into the dirt.<br />
<br />
The Boss landed with a thud, his cheek burning from being struck. Glancing up he noticed the kitsune looming over him. Tatsu now kneeled before the Boss, unleashing vicious punches into the Bosses face.<br />
<br />
&quot;You killed my people,&quot; Tatsu bellowed, his fists raining down on the Boss. &quot;Attack my home! Terrorize my children! No more shall I allow you to draw breath in this world!&quot;<br />
<br />
The Boss was barely conscious, the taste of blood in his mouth. Glancing up at Tatsu with one good eye he began to think that attacking the kitsune may have been a bad idea. That is until Evan arrived.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tatsu behind you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren&#39;s warning was too late, Evan Harris had used his magic to draw Tatsus sword to him, impaling the divine kitsune from behind. Tatsu coughed, spitting up blood as his attack stopped. The kitsune simply staring down at his chest as blood soaked his clothing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Tatsu,&quot; Evan said quietly. &quot;Its not personal. Just business.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren screamed, charging at the young man. Evan quickly noticed, unleashing a torrent of lightning at the Catalyst. Tatsu watched as Darren now collapsed, writhing in pain.<br />
<br />
The Boss groaned, slowly rolling onto his belly as he unsteadily made his way to his feet. &quot;Ugh you pack a hell of a punch,&quot; he groaned. Wiping his mouth he now lifted Tatsus head as he looked directly into the kitsunes eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know I respect you kitsune,&quot; he said. &quot;Not alot of people can get the drop on me or beat my ass like that. When you die I&#39;m going to put your skin in my office. Like a bear skin rug, a trophy of the greatest adversary I&#39;ve ever faced.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tatsu grit his teeth, blood dripping from his mouth as the Boss continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know what your thinking,&quot; the Boss said. &quot;Whats going to happen to my people. Well, they won&#39;t all be dead.&quot; Tatsu narrowed his eyes, trying to remove the blade from his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean sure I&#39;m going to have to kill all the males,&quot; the Boss continued. &quot;But your women, your children. Hell, I&#39;m not a monster. You&#39;d be amazed the kinks some people have, your women will work for me pleasing men and your children, well, ill make sure that they stay busy working in my warehouses and fields.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tatsu screamed, a guttural cry that split the very earth and knocked the Boss off his feet. He would not allow his people to be used as whores and slaves. Conjuring a spell with the remainder of his magic, Tatsu opened a portal in the very fabric of reality. A portal now began to suck all of the Normal soldiers from his kingdom. Grabbing the Boss by the throat he now choked him, watching as his eyes began to bug out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get out of my kingdom and never return,&quot;<br />
<br />
With a final toss he now sent the Boss sailing through the portal, holding it open just long enough as the Normal, Evan, Casseus, and the rest of his allies vanished.<br />
<br />
Darren now slowly began to recover, the fight was over. Tatsu had banished the Normal from the realm. Trying to recover he gasped as he looked at Tatsu. The divine kitsune was motionless, kneeling in a pool of his own blood.</p>
