<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mellony went straight to the bathroom, where she took off her wet clothes and threw them in the laundry basket.  she was dripping with sweat, which she found odd as it wasn&#39;t that hot a day. She stepped into the shower, leaving a wet trail, and turned on the water.<br />
<br />
When she did that something strange happened.  The water that fell on her did not run down her body, but instead was immediately absorbed by her skin. She didn&#39;t miss this bizarre phenomenon and kept looking down, and the thing got worse when her body started to become very malleable, as if her bones were melting. It was too late when she realized the seriousness of the problem and she didn&#39;t even have time to run for help.  Mellony&#39;s feet deformed for good in a puddle of a transparent blue substance that was quickly washed down the drain.<br />
<br />
Mellony despaired as the transparent blue color spread faster through her body, which liquefied and went down the drain, so much so that she lost consciousness.<br />
<br />
When Mellony woke up, she initially thought that the shower was just a dream, but then she saw that she was in a totally dark and humid place, with only a very dim light coming from an opening somewhere above.  She tried to move, but it felt like her body was a uniform mass, but she managed to crawl until she could see the source of the light.  Under the light she looked up and saw an opening to the night sky, but there were bars closing the exit. She tried to raise her hands towards the bars, which she couldn&#39;t reach anyway, but thinking that doing that and screaming for help would make it easier for someone to find her.  She only managed to raise an arm on the third attempt, which was when she concentrated the most, but instead of screaming for help Mellony screamed in fright when she saw the transparent blue hand that appeared in front of her, and as soon as she screamed the blue arm crumbled and fell on her.<br />
<br />
She heard voices coming from above, someone had heard her, but judging by the voices and what she could hear from what they were saying, they were young people who were passing by and they were terrified when they heard her, thinking she was some ghost, and they ran away.<br />
<br />
Mellony had no choice.  She tried to concentrate like before and this time she felt her body in its normal form again, and looking down she saw that she had become a transparent blue slime girl. She tested her body and discovered that she could not only change between her human form and a puddle, but she could reform her body to take whatever form she wanted. <br />
With that she tried to reach out with her arms to grab the railings and pull herself up.  Mellony&#39;s arms really stretched, but with that she found that she was limited by her body mass, and that it wasn&#39;t enough to stretch her arms far enough, but when she tried to scale the side wall in the puddle form, she found that she could slide along the walls and ceiling, and she used it to get out of where she was, seeing right away that she came out of a sewer.<br />
<br />
The street was deserted now, and apparently it was early morning.  The place she was was a luxury neighborhood, where the houses were big and luxurious, but she didn&#39;t know exactly where and how to get back home. She then took advantage of her liquid body and entered a nearby house that was all dark, where everyone would be sleeping, passing under the door. She then slithered along the wall and ceiling to avoid being seen if someone woke up and crossed paths with her. She searched through the rooms until she found a large bathroom, in which the mirror took up an entire wall.<br />
<br />
She turned on the lights and was finally able to see herself in full after her transformation.  Mellony assumed her human form, even though she was always in that transparent blue color, but now with more clarity she realized that there were dark spots floating inside her.<br />
<br />
&quot;How disgusting, I absorbed the dirt from where I passed on myself.  And now, how do I get rid of them?&quot; Mellony thought questioning herself. Knowing what she wanted her body reacted instinctively.  She felt something grow between her legs and saw in her reflection a cock and balls form. Her cock was hard, even more than you&#39;d expect from someone whose entire body is liquid.  She didn&#39;t want to touch her cock and tried to make it disappear, but it wouldn&#39;t obey, instead she saw that the impurities in her body were being guided to a single point, which were her balls, and changing their color to white. She had no doubt that her body was purifying itself by turning filth into cum. She then tried to stroke his cock, but it lacked density and came apart easily, which forced her to keep trying until she learned how to increase the density of her body to the point where it functioned as if it were solid. Doing so, she jerked off.  Her body grew cleaner and cleaner as the impurities transformed and joined the cum, which she could see churning inside her transparent ballsack, and then traveling past her cock when she came.<br />
<br />
After orgasm, Mellony was able to make her dick disappear.  After that she experimented more and discovered that she could make her dick appear and disappear at will, she could even change its shape to whatever she wanted, even an animal, in the desired quantity and location. She discovered that she could fully assume the form of an animal if she wanted to, she just couldn&#39;t change her color. She then tried to clean her cum so as not to leave any traces of her presence there, but then she discovered one more thing about herself.  By messing with water, her body absorbed the colorless liquid making it part of her body, which made her realize that she could get bigger by mixing water with it, and to decrease in size she only needed to discard a part of her body.<br />
<br />
Mellony was sure that this was due to the toxic waste from the reservoir that Brad had pushed her into, that&#39;s why she blamed him for what had happened to her, but she still didn&#39;t know that the very liquid that made up her body was toxic to people and would make them slime creatures like her.</p>
