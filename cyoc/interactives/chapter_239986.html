<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">( AN: No. I can&#39;t just let this happen to Eugene. It&#39;s not over. Marked violence for implied violence and broken glass in Eugene&#39;s hand.)<br />
<br />
That&#39;s it. Eugene was dead inside. She had come to value this lonely group of outcasts, at least, as much as she could while dealing with the nightmarish reality that had changed all of this. Now, she had been framed. Her wish had given her a perfect life that she could not handle, and she had shed that in a fit that everyone else had deemed true, medical madness. That explained the fall from grace. Her horrified parents, hearing something so uncharacteristic of their once perfect child, denied that she had done the prank against Willow. Eve at first was too stunned to mount a defense. Then, her girl brain flooded with emotion, her hormones swirling, Eugene took a deep breaht, her large breasts rising as she did so, and then... then, she let it all out.<br />
<br />
Her teenaged emotions overtook her as Eugene began to scream, tears pouring as she began to shout and curse at Gloria and Tom, defending her innocence in a flurry of curses that had not fled her mouth since Eugene, as the male Eugune she so missed, drank her male self into a vomit-coated stupor after Gloria had founded the predation rumor. He almost missed being known as a supposed creep, after all of this horror that had been done to her.<br />
<br />
The school resource officer came in to see Eve, once the golden girl of the city, hyperventilating between maddened howls, clawing at her hair and inventing new curses to describe what happened. Eugene was not Eve! Eugene did not want any of this! Why, why was this her fate?! What did she do to deserve this?!<br />
<br />
Eugene next step was self-evident: with the world crumbling around her, and no reason to live, with the last person she respected a broken shell, she knew what she was going to do.<br />
<br />
Eugene was going to end her life.<br />
<br />
She had to die. NOW. She knew EXACTLY how she was going to do it, too. She bolted, her knotted hair swishing behind her as she shoved and slammed anything in her way. She ran, ran, ran, gasping for air, breasts bouncing, legs stomping, and ran to the janitor&#39;s closet from her former life. She slammed the door and barricaded it shut, still hyperventilating.<br />
<br />
Eugene turned, fury in her eyes at her own reflection. She looked at it. She hated it. It looked so much like Eugene. If Eugene had been born a girl, her face would have looked like that at this age. The same shape of her jaw, the same large ears, the same color hair. The same thick eyebrows. Sure, her cheekbones were different and her face a bit softer, but she still looked like Eugene&#39;s twin sister. Certainly, though, not the same body, be it these breasts, this figure, this youth, or this life. Eugene recalled her own childhood in her original life, how he looked, at his &quot;male twin,&quot; begging to change it all back. All of Eugene&#39;s features looked unremarkable on Eugene as a man, but her angular jawline and boyish features came across as unique, and with the expertly applied makeup and skin care that this &quot;Eve&quot; had done in a world Eugene never knew, she was seen as adorable and stunning in both looks and personality. She was in the world beautiful, feminine woman, a twin of Eugene where nothing went wrong..<br />
<br />
SHE HATED IT.<br />
<br />
She screamed at the mirror, slamming the full weight of her fist into the mirror, shattering the glass. It sank deep into her hand, as the blood began to fall from the wounds.<br />
<br />
It was time. Eugene picked up a jagged shard of glass. Eugene raised the shard up to her throat. She gritted her teeth, ready to slit her own neck.<br />
<br />
Then she stopped. A flash of something had caught her eye as the naked lightbulb swung on its wire above her.<br />
<br />
A flash... of GREEN.<br />
<br />
Eugene&#39;s heart skipped a beat. The... the Ahn&#39;Ger Stone. It had been here this whole time. She grabbed it, like a shipwrecked sailor grabbing flotsam in the raging sea. Everything could be made right. Everything c-<br />
<br />
BANG!! BANG!!<br />
<br />
The pounding on the janitor&#39;s door by the school resource officer snapped Eugene back to her predicament. She looked at the door. She looked at the Ahn&#39;Ger Stone. Everything swirled around her, as she began to focus all her hatred, all of the feelings she had bottled up, all the tears she had cried, into a primal disgust, concentrated and pouring out within at the Ahn&#39;Ger Stone. If the Ahn&#39;Ger Stone could feel, if it knew anything it was doing, then the rage within Eugene would have been otherwordly, a hatred it had not felt in many, many years. <br />
<br />
She wanted to get out of this. She wanted to get out of this.<br />
<br />
...but... Eugene&#39;s mind flashed back to Willow&#39;s innocence, her happiness at Tom being with her, and the betrayal Willow misinterpreted as being hers. She flashed back to Joanna, the kind, loving woman that had once loved the man who had been turned into Willow. She flashed back to Gloria, that pretentious, demonic witch. Everything and everyone she touched was made more miserable, much worse. Gloria couldn&#39;t get away with doing this. Not to Eugene, and not to Willow. Tom... Tom was no better. This was both their doing.<br />
<br />
The only thing Eugene hated more than this blasted stone was Gloria, and all the woes she had wrought on this school, both to her as Eugene and to her as Eve, and now, with Tom&#39;s assistance, Willow had been betrayed by the one person she trusted more than anyone, spare Paige.<br />
<br />
Eugene gripped the stone, the hatred at this series of events growing. Eugene hated Tom. Eugene hated Gloria. Eugene hated this girl body. Eugene hated Eve.<br />
<br />
Most of all, Eugene hated the Ahn&#39;Ger Stone.<br />
<br />
The stone glowed a blinding green as Eugene made a shortsighted wish.<br />
<br />
&quot;I WISH...&quot;</p>
