<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The woman&#39;s stagecoach came to a stop on the edge of a village. As before, the coach was pulled by eight donkeys --one of whom was now Jessica.<br />
<br />
Jessica and the seven other donkeys were tightly fitted to their reins and thus unable to escape, forced to do the Woman&#39;s bidding by pulling the coach to and from the ferry to Pleasure Island. <br />
<br />
Jessica quickly snuck a glance around her and saw that the coach was once more packed to the brim with boys and girls of all ages that it practically was full. In addition to them crammed into the interior of the coach, others were piled on top. <br />
<br />
&quot;All aboard for Pleasure Island!&quot; the Woman announced just like a carnival barker would. <br />
<br />
On the road next to the coach were three boys, who all cheered at the prospect of traveling to place where they could do whatever they please. They excitedly climbed atop the coach and held on for dear life, ready to begin their journey -- which as Jessica knew was one they would never forget and would deeply regret. <br />
<br />
&quot;All right, let&#39;s go!&quot; the Woman shouted to Jessica and her fellow donkeys. She only had to crack her whip once for the frightened and tired donkeys to start pulling the stagecoach once more. <br />
<br />
Jessica and the other donkeys groaned in pain and exhaustion in having to pull the packed coach up and down the roads again. Their hooves hurt from having to run across the rough terrain and they had been standing on them all night long. <br />
<br />
&quot;How stupid I was&quot; thought Jessica. &quot;I should of never got on that coach to begin with. I should have listened to what they tried to teach me in school. Nothing is ever free and now I will be paying for it for the rest of my miserable new life.&quot; <br />
<br />
And with that very thought, tears streamed down from her eyes and down her muzzle as she continued to help her fellow donkeys in their grueling task of pulling the heavy stagecoach towards it&#39;s destination -- the ferry to Pleasure Island.     <br />
<br />
Night had fallen on Pleasure Island once more and with it had come more boys and girls lured to the island with the promises of unlimited fun and no authority. And just like before, after they partied to their hearts&#39; content, the Woman&#39;s new prey had once more fell victim to the island&#39;s donkey curse. <br />
<br />
Jessica layed in a corner of the donkey pen that housed the stagecoach&#39;s donkey workforce. <br />
<br />
All of the donkeys here had retained some human intelligence and could not be sold by the Woman without risk of them talking about the reality of Pleasure Island. <br />
<br />
So they were retained and used by the Woman to pull her stagecoach through the various towns she would travel to in search of more &quot;stupid boys and girls&quot; to victimize. <br />
<br />
Only hours earlier, there had been the sounds of newly turned donkeys braying in panic as they were processed and shipped off to a new life of donkey slavery. Now all was quiet and no more sounds echoed down the tunnel that lead from the donkey pen to the ferry&#39;s dock. <br />
<br />
All the other donkeys were asleep in the pen, but Jessica was restless. She couldn&#39;t sleep, especially knowing what the next day would bring. <br />
<br />
The next day would see them put to work helping the Woman&#39;s Minions clean up the mess in the amusement park from the night before. Then they would go out once more to pull the stagecoach on the main land in search of more boys and girls. <br />
<br />
Jessica was amazed by the scope of the Woman&#39;s operation. Every couple of nights were spent with another batch of stupid boys and girls to be made into asses, which the Woman would then sell for reasonable prices on the mainland. <br />
<br />
&quot;She must be a multi millionaire by now,&quot; Jessica thought to herself. &quot;How long exactly has she been doing this any way?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica sighed sadly as she knew she would never get any answers to her numerous questions. <br />
<br />
Through a small hole in the rock ceiling above her, Jessica could faintly make out the stars in the night sky. One star in particular seemed to glow stronger than the others and had an elegant beauty about it. This star made Jessica think of someone. <br />
<br />
Her friend James. <br />
<br />
Jessica wished James was well and safely away from Pleasure Island. She hadn&#39;t seen her since that fateful night they spent on the island and she had overheard the Woman fuming over someone managing to escape from the island. <br />
<br />
Jessica hoped it was James and wished she had never tried to lead James down the path and promise of an easy life with no consequences. Jessica had learned her lesson, but it was far too late for her to do anything about it. <br />
<br />
Jessica stared longingly at the bright star and closed her eyes. &quot;I wish for my voice back, so that I might lead others away from this nightmare that has become my life. I know I haven&#39;t made good decisions, that my behavior has been bad though and though, but if I had just another chance... I&#39;d do things differently... I&#39;d be a better person... I&#39;d...&quot; <br />
<br />
Jessica cried, believing her situation to be hopeless and also believing that she didn&#39;t deserve a second chance. <br />
<br />
Suddenly there was a bright light up in the sky which caught Jessica&#39;s attention. The star she had been watching began to glow brighter and brighter till it blinded her with it&#39;s light. And then it was gone, disappearing from the sky completely, much to Jessica&#39;s confusion. <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Jessica exclaimed. &quot;Where&#39;d that star go?&quot; <br />
<br />
Suddenly Jessica gasped in shock: she could TALK! <br />
&quot;I can talk&quot;<br />
<br />
And not only that, Jessica was human again. She looked down at herself in amazement, she was naked and with some whip wounds on her back.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s... it&#39;s a miracle!&quot; Jessica exclaimed as she leapt to her feet. She felt her own hands and with them she touched and stroked her ears, her nose, her chest, her hip. Immediately she turned back to see her own butt and discovered that she no longer had a tail. That excited her so much that she began to dance shaking her butt and wagging her ass cheeks with joy because she no longer had a tail that would hit her ass and embarrass her when it wagged back and forth. For the first time in a while she was happy.<br />
<br />
Why was she a human girl again? Many more questions were running through her head but she had to get back home and out of the open. So, Jessica ran out over a cliff to escape from there and jump into the ocean. She dived into the water, and swim far away from Pleasure Island, and get up on homeland.<br />
As she approached her home, not caring that she still had no clothes on,she walked out to find her mom sitting in the kitchen crying. Jessica walked up to her mom and hugged her, apologizing for any outburst earlier. She was happy to be home and human again but she still thought about the entire experience in her head. She was daydreaming actually and remembering the feeling of the animal instincts, the pleasure to walk on all fours or the grass sweet flavor.  It was at this time that Jessica felt the throbbing in her spine.<br />
<br />
Once she stood in the middle of the public square on all fours and, with her eyes closed, began to eat the flowers on the ornamental flowerpots. When people started laughing, she came to her senses and ran ashamed. And not only that, sometimes she was seen braying with donkey herds as if she were talking to them and when she got angry she got back on all fours and started kicking, bucking and braying until she remembered that she was a human being. She always returned to her human behavior but had to deal with the mockery and laughs of people all her life for this donkey behavior that still remained within her.</p>
