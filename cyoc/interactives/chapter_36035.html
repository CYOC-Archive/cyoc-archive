<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rick was walking around during the first nice spring day after the brutal winter they had. He was thinking about the blizzards that they had had. One of those storms he had been snowed in at his girlfriend's house on one of those days. He had had fun playing with her younger sisters. Her mother and older sister had gotten stuck in a hotel and he had thought that maybe Karen was ready to have sex. She didn't want to have sex then because of her little sisters. He could understand that.<br />
<br />
Something on the ground caught his eye and he bent to pick it up. It was some sort of medallion or amulet and it looked really old. He knew that Karen had taken an interest in old medallions and he figured she might like this one.Looking at his watch he realized that he had to get to Karen's or else she would be mad at him. He stuffed what he found into his pocket and hurried on his way.<br />
<br />
As he walked up to Karen's house he saw her mother come out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Miss Punnit&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well hello Rick&quot; Alice said. &quot;What brings you here? As if I didn't know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I came to see Karen of course&quot; Rick said blushing a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Karen's upstairs in her room&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
Just then Karen's little sisters came out of the house. &quot;Hello Rick&quot; they said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello girls&quot; Rick said. &quot;You all look pretty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm taking them out to meet Mike&quot; Alice said. &quot;I would take Karen but she already had plans with you and Denise is out on her own date. I already told Karen and I'll tell you. If everything goes ok we won't be back until late.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Miss Punnit&quot; Rick said. &quot;I hope everything does go ok. You deserve to be happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I'm plenty happy with my girls&quot; Alice said. &quot;Being with Mike has made me happier.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I wish you luck&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Rick&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're welcome&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now get in the house before Karen comes storming down here&quot; Alice said as she herded her daughters into her van.<br />
<br />
Rick went into the house as Alice drove away and went up to Karen's room. He knocked on her door and when she told him to come in he did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello handsome&quot; Karen said smiling at Rick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello beautiful&quot; Rick said smiling at Karen. &quot;Would I be put to death if I gave you a kiss?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, only one way to find out&quot; Karen said breathily as she leaned in to kiss Rick.<br />
<br />
They kissed for a few moments and when Karen pulled away she said &quot;Well you're still alive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mother doesn't know that we just kissed yet&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're such a kidder Rick&quot; Karen said. &quot;That's why I like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just like?&quot; Rick asked with a smile on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok I might love you&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you too&quot; Rick said. &quot;I want to spend my life with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So do I&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I almost forgot&quot; Rick said as he reached into his pocket. &quot;I found this and I thought you might like it.&quot; As he said that he pulled out the medallion and showed it to Karen.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have the Medallion of Zulo&quot; Karen whispered as she reached out for it.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Medallion of what?&quot; Rick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Medallion of Zulo&quot; Karen said. &quot;It transforms people when they touch any clothes to it while wearing it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on now Karen&quot; Rick said. &quot;Do you really expect me to believe that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's true&quot; Karen said. &quot;Daisy was originally my older brother and Stephanie was his best friend who was also male. Daisy decided to use the medallion to change herself into a little girl. Stephanie did the same thing about three months later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have to be kidding me&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll prove it&quot; Karen said as she grabbed the medallion.<br />
<br />
A blue spark leaped between them and the medallion.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that?&quot; Rick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
It was then that Rick noticed that Karen's hair was getting shorter and she was growing taller.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're changing Karen&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So are you&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
Rick could feel himself getting shorter and a strange tingling in his dick and balls. He was feeling them less and less until finally he couldn't feel them anymore. Instead he started feeling something new down there. He realized that what he was feeling was a pussy forming. As he realized this his hips widened and his waist shrunk. All the while his arms and legs were becoming thinner, more feminine. He knew the same thing was happening to his face. He also noticed a weight growing on his chest and looking he realized that he<br />
was growing breasts. Once the transformation was complete he looked at Karen again and was surprised to be looking at himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;We switched bodies&quot; Karen said in Rick's voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did this happen?&quot; Rick asked in Karen's voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;It must have been the medallion&quot; Karen said. &quot;All I know is I have to get out of these clothes. They're a bit tight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I'll take mine off too then&quot; Rick said. &quot;My shirt is a bit tight in the chest.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once the two of them had stripped they looked at each other and Rick felt his pussy get very moist. He couldn't help but look at Karen's new dick. He had seen it often enough but now he wanted it inside his pussy. As he continued to look at it it became hard which just made his pussy wetter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh Rick&quot; Karen said hesitantly. &quot;I don't know what's going on here but I think I'm horny.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I am too&quot; Rick said. &quot;So what do we do about it?&quot;</p>
