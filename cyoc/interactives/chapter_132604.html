<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The boys&#39; mornings were both similar and vastly different. Dillon awoke to a call from his mother, who as usual called at this time to make sure he was studying. This time, however, it served as his alarm. As Dillon picked up the phone and began to converse with his mother, attempting to feign innocence, he found himself having difficulty getting through the conversation. He could still understand the Mandarin his mother was speaking, but somehow he found himself struggling to respond back. He was fluent in the language before he knew English but right now Dillon could only think of the English words for many of the things he wanted to say. His mother even asked if he was okay in English, since he was speaking so little to her. Somehow, he managed an excuse for his behavior and ended the conversation, but not before saying goodbye by butchering the Mandarin word in almost a complete American accent. Stunned at his change in speech, he hung up, looking down at his hands to understand what was happening.<br />
<br />
It was then that he noticed something else odd. Did his hands seem... daintier? Dillon walked up to his mirror and was taken aback at what he saw. At 5&#39;6&quot;, Dillon was nothing short of average for his ethnicity. It was why he&#39;d worked so hard to make up for it in muscle; it was the only way to impress girls. Now, however, much of his efforts were no where to be found. Where before he had the bulging muscles of a bodybuilder, now one could believe that he barely went to the gym. Only a light layer of muscled remained on him as he stared at himself, jaw dropped. Even his body hair, light as it was, seemed to have diminished to nothing.<br />
<br />
Dillon stripped off his shirt to survey the damage. As he did, his attention started to dissipate. By the time his shirt dropped to the ground to see his 8 pack abs missing, replaced with merely a toned, smooth stomach, he began feeling aroused again. The culmination of memories from last night&#39;s failed study session to this morning&#39;s changes to his body and mind made Dillon very horny. Quickly, his hand found his cock and he quickly began furiously stroking it. He didn&#39;t even notice that his former seven inch rod had clearly shrunk as he let his feelings consume him and push him over the edge. He cupped his hand around his cock, allowing all the jizz to pool on his hand and as he came, the issues that were plaguing Dillon&#39;s mind seemed to drift further and further away. He almost entirely forgot about them as he looked around, searching for what he&#39;d do next to occupy his time. Dillon&#39;s eyes eventually found his calculus textbook and he quickly sat down and opened it up. The asian 19 year old spent the rest of the morning focused solely on the magazine that mysteriously appeared hidden between the pages of the textbook while licking the cum off of his hand as a snack.<br />
<br />
Dillon was blissfully unaware of his situation or his changes, as were the other four guys for the most part. All four guys had gone through a reduction in muscle mass and inhibitions while their libidos increased. William had spent the entire morning loving the feeling of coat after coat of cum drying on his body and couldn&#39;t care less about his thinned body. Nicholas had been more than happy with the changes to his body and had spent his time recording himself stripping down multiple times, getting hotter with each rendition. Originally, he&#39;d started by just looking at himself in the mirror, but some urge made him want to start saving the strip tease and the moment he&#39;d done it once, he was hooked. He&#39;d spent the next four hours or so practicing technique, ignoring his mother&#39;s calls for breakfast downstairs.<br />
<br />
Johnathan was the only one who actually felt something majorly wrong. Perhaps it was because he was the group&#39;s leader. Perhaps it was because he awoke in a pair of briefs that he didn&#39;t remember having before, lying on the floor of a house he&#39;d never been in with a shot glass in his hand. No one would know. Nonetheless, the embarrassment from having done something so outrageous caused him to move incredibly fast, sprinting out the door of the house he&#39;d slept in before anyone could notice. He didn&#39;t even think to put clothes on, though he was painfully aware of it as he neared his dorm. All eyes were on him on his way back and each gaze sent a thrill through his body. Something was very wrong, Johnathan thought to himself. Why was he feeling so strange?<br />
<br />
Getting into his dorm, however, he realized that it wasn&#39;t just him. He walked in to find William naked, his clothes from yesterday covered in cum and on the floor, while he danced around the room in the most erotic way Johnathan had ever seen. It was clear that Johnathan wasn&#39;t the only one who had slimmed down overnight. Just as Johnathan&#39;s all American muscleman stature had been reduced to an all American swimmer&#39;s stature, William&#39;s body, originally one fit to survive any terrain, probably couldn&#39;t go through a quarter of the heavy lifting it had gone through daily before.<br />
<br />
&quot;William, what are you doing?&quot; Johnathan asked, attempting to keep his voice as calm as possible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, William sounds like such a boring name. What am I, 26? Call me Will or Liam, at least. Or better yet, Billy!&quot; William exclaimed excitedly an odd glow in his eyes.<br />
<br />
Johnathan simply stared at his best friend. His best friend that had got him into conspiracy theories and working out. His best friend who wary of anything even slightly mainstream and hated dancing with a passion. His best friend who was serious and full of himself almost to a fault. His best friend who was currently jacking himself off while twerking and grinding his ass against Johnathan&#39;s bedpost like some gay whore, his glasses only staying on because his head was thrown back as he moaned loudly. Like a slutty twink, Johnathan realized, his cock hardening at the scene. The blonde haired man made a decision.<br />
<br />
&quot;William, you fucking slut. Call the others over. Now.&quot; Johnathan ordered. William, did as he was told, right after cumming from Johnathan&#39;s order.</p>
