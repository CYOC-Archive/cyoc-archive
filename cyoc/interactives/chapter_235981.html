<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mister Mystic, who’s real name is Milan Jones, uses the first half of his show to work on his plan on how to make sure the 10-year-old girl will be his, unaware that the girl is in fact a boy. The first thing he decides on doing is “plant a seed” in the girl’s mind, causing the girl to have dreams about him and feel slightly attracted to him. He’d also would link his soul to hers, causing him to be able to know where she is, and finally he’ll link his mind to hers, without being able to read her thoughts, only for him to be able to enter her dreams, with the idea of slowly pushing the girl in the “right” direction of becoming his wife and mother of his kids. Milan would use his link with the girl to be able to even teleport himself into her home, this would give the wizard the possibility of manipulating the girl’s family, causing them to be “okay” with him dating their daughter.<br />
<br />
Satisfied with his plan, Milan is ready to start working on his future wife, so as the second half of the show begins, the magician calls “Judy” onto the stage.<br />
<br />
“Judy” nervously walks up the stairs that lead onto the stage, “welcome, what is your name,” Milan asks.<br />
<br />
“Jay… um… Judy,” Jayden says, almost saying his real name, though it seems that no one, not even the magician had noticed the slip.<br />
<br />
“It is nice to meet you, Judy,” Milan says, smiling as he leads the “girl” to the stage center, “now, I couldn’t help but notice your outfit,” he then continues, “I don’t think the outfit suits you, I think you need a more suitable outfit. An outfit that is fit for a princess like you, so I was thinking, why not change your outfit into a beautiful figure-hugging dress?”<br />
<br />
Hearing the man call HIM a “princess” causes Jayden to feel weird, ‘do I really look THAT pretty,’ he asks himself, “um… th-thanks for the compliment… I guess,” he then says, sounding a little nervous, “b-but… I don’t think I’m a “princess”… I mean… they are far more pretty than me!”<br />
<br />
The magician chuckles, “I personally think you’re even prettier than any princess out there,” he says, he then turns to the audience, “who of you agree?”<br />
<br />
To Jayden’s surprise every single hand in the audience raises, even Lucy raises her hand, “I think SHE’S the most beautiful and most pretty princess in the whole world,” she says, “but my little SIS just refuses to show off HER beautiful curves,” the 16-year-old grins up at her “little sister”.<br />
<br />
Jayden glares at Lucy, giving her, “you-are-not-helping”-look.<br />
<br />
Mister Mystic, looks down at Lucy, “I thought that you two were somehow related,” he says, smiling, “I agree 100% with you. Judy seems to be nervous about wearing dresses, isn’t that right,” he then asks, turning to “Judy”.<br />
<br />
“Judy” blushes, feeling so nervous with all those eyes on “her”, “w-well, yes,” she then says, “I just find dresses and skirts to… well… sexy. I mean… I am only 10… I don’t want to appear as some 18-year-old woman! The thought of being stared at by boys AND men… it creeps me out!”<br />
<br />
Milan nods, “I totally understand,” he says, “but there is no shame and no reason for a 10-year-old girl like you to NOT show off her body. I think we should first make you realize, that wearing a dress or skirt isn’t as bad as you think”.<br />
<br />
Before Jayden is able to protest, the magician lies a hand on his head, the man’s thumb on his forehead, and as mister Mystic does this, the 10-year-old suddenly feels a warmth spread over his head and it feels as though his mind, his brain, is dipped into a bowl of warm water. Jayden feels himself immediately relax and calm down, why had he been so nervous?<br />
<br />
Milan smiles, “that’s it, relax,” he says in a calm voice, to Jayden the voice sounds as if it were inside his head, it even has an echo to it, “wearing dresses and skirts is normal for a girl. And you are such a pretty girl, such a pretty princess, you should be proud of your beauty and show it off to the world. What better way than to dress in clothes, like dresses, tight jeans, tight shirts, skirts? It is time for you to dress accordingly, there is nothing wrong with you wanting to show off your sexy curves”. As Milan says this, unaware that he is messing with a boy’s mind, he is also infesting “Judy’s” mind with a little spell, which will cause the “girl” to feel slightly attracted towards the 45-year-old.<br />
<br />
Lucy, who is watching the whole scenery, grins to herself, ‘poor Jayden,’ she thinks to herself, ‘but I doubt he’ll start wearing dresses and skirts as a boy, but it could come in handy if he really wants to become “Judy” from time to time’.<br />
<br />
Milan removes his hand, smiling down at the “girl”, “how are you feeling now, Judy,” he asks, “you still refuse to wear dresses and skirts?”<br />
<br />
Jayden blinks a few times, as if waking from a dream, he then looks up at the man, ‘why haven’t I noticed how beautiful his eyes are,’ he asks himself, ‘he is pretty handsome!’ The “girl” shyly puts “her” arms behind her back, blushing a little, “I… um… I g-guess I could… give it a try,” she mumbles, ‘god… why am I feeling so shy and weird? I mean… he IS a handsome man… but I am a boy… I… I shouldn’t be feeling this way,’ he thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
Milan, noticing how shy the girl is, grins inwardly knowing that the “seed is planted”, he can feel that their souls and minds are linked together, the first step in his plan is done. The man smiles, “no need to be shy,” he says, “you’ll look stunning, and you’ll see that it isn’t as bad as you think it is”. The magician begins waving his hands in front of himself, Jayden then suddenly feels the clothes he is wearing, shift.<br />
<br />
The jeans jacket and t-shirt seem to melt together, changing into a nice royal blue color, the material also changes from stiff jeans to a soft satin, the boy feels the clothes cling tighter to his body. As the changes reach his pants, the top part of the soon-to-be dress fuses with the waistband of the jeans, Jayden’s eyes widen as he watches the pant legs merge together, soon the “girl” is standing in a beautiful royal blue dress that reaches her ankles, showing off her curves beautifully.<br />
<br />
The audience gasp, some even whistle, Milan smiles, “the audience loves your new look, Judy,” he says, “how does it feel wearing a dress?”<br />
<br />
“It… it feels weird,” the “girl” says, “but… but you were right… it… it actually isn’t as bad as I thought!”<br />
<br />
Milan smiles, “that’s the spirit,” he says, “you can return to your sister, and you may keep the dress, my gift to you,” he adds with a wink.<br />
<br />
Jayden blushes, the wink making him feel weird again, ‘he… he’s so kind,’ he thinks to himself, “I… I don’t know what to say,” he then says, ‘why am I feeling so weird… I feel… almost drawn to him… almost as though I want to be close to him! What does that mean,’ he asks himself, “th-thanks for the dress,” he then mumbles.<br />
<br />
Milan chuckles, “my pleasure,” he says, he then turns to the audience, “give it up for Judy,” he calls and as the audience applauds, “Judy” slowly walks back to her sister.<br />
<br />
“So, how does it feel wearing a dress,” Lucy asks in a whisper, “it does honestly suit you. It looks really amazing on your body. I’m serious!”<br />
<br />
Jayden looks up at his sister, “you… you really think that,” he asks.<br />
<br />
“Do I look as though I am making fun of you,” Lucy asks, “I really mean what I have said, you look great in the dress! But… how do you feel?”<br />
<br />
“It… it feels weird, I mean… I’m a boy… I shouldn’t be wearing this,” the 10-year-old whispers, “but… I must admit… it isn’t as bad as I thought. So… I guess I wouldn’t mind… IF I should choose to become “Judy” in the future… to wear skirts and dresses”.<br />
<br />
Lucy nods, smiling, “no one is telling you to wear dresses or skirts when you are your normal self,” she says, “when you are “Judy” no one will know that you are a boy wearing a dress. One more thing: I think you look good with long hair!”<br />
<br />
Jayden’s eyes widen at this, “you can’t be serious,” he says, “the boys in at my school would call me names! I don’t want that!”<br />
<br />
Lucy shrugs, “I’m just saying,” she says, “but it’s up to you”.<br />
<br />
Jayden is silent, turning back to the stage, the boy not realizing how he is looking at the man, ‘I wonder what he looks like without those clothes on,’ he thinks to himself, ‘why can’t I stop thinking about him… why am I IMAGINING him naked?! Something feels wrong! But… it feels also so right! What is happening to me?! Maybe… maybe I’m just curious? Ye-yeah… that must be it… but why… why would I want to see… an adult naked? I’m ten! Shouldn’t I rather want to see someone my age naked? But… imagining seeing someone my age naked feels… not right!’<br />
<br />
The 10-year-old boy tries his best to come up with an explanation, but the more he thinks about the 45-year-old man, the more he feels drawn to him, wanting nothing more than to see him naked and be close to him. Jayden even begins imagining what the man might look like without clothes, the 10-year-old’s eyes widen when he feels his tiny 3 inch cock starting to erect at the thought of seeing the man’s cock, but Jayden, instead of being disgusted, feels more curious… wanting to know what it would feel and taste like… would… would the man’s cock even fit… inside of him? Jayden is shocked, why would he want THAT? And why does THAT feel so… so right?<br />
<br />
Jayden looks over at his sister out the corner of his eye, wondering if he should tell Lucy, maybe she’d know what is happening with him, but… what if she’ll get annoyed? No… he better keep it to himself, he’ll figure it out by himself. Maybe he is just tired, it had been a long day, maybe tomorrow everything will be back to normal. At least, that is what Jayden hopes for.</p>
