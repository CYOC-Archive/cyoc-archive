<br />
Clyde was being led down a corridor with the man who hired him giving him instructions on what to say and do when going into the office of his new boss’s office, as what not to do.<br />
<br />
“Okay kid, now it’s always important to make a good first impression. So if Mr. Amberhill speaks to you, speak back, but don’t speak before he does. But above all else, do not, and I repeat do not stare at his eye. He hates it when people stare at the eye.” Clyde’s boss informed him as they approached the office. When they got near the door of Amberhill’s office, they heard his loud voice from the other side.<br />
<br />
“What the hell do I pay those idiots at the county clerk’s office for?!” A booming voice echoed behind the door.<br />
<br />
“Oh, good, he’s in a mood.” Clyde’s hiring manager commented before they entered as the two of them entered the office with a few men standing before Amberhill’s desk and a very lovely looking fox secretary woman standing to the side in a business suit and wearing glasses.<br />
<br />
“Unfortunately sir, our efforts into finding any legal way around acquiring Eliana Hoti’s land has proven to be powerless.” The fox secretary said.<br />
<br />
“Powerless? Powerless is not a word I prefer to use in daily conversation. Don’t those idiots know who’s in charge of the Lycan realm?” Amberhill asked his secretary.<br />
<br />
“You are sir.” The secretary answered with a nod.<br />
<br />
“That’s right, me.” Henry Amberhill said turning around as Clyde saw the Alpha of the Amberhill pack looked to be a large man. Although he looked fat, he did look like he also had plenty of muscles on his body. He wore a shirt and waistcoat with a suit jacket over it. But the most distinctive thing about him were three claw marks over his left eye.<br />
<br />
“Lord Wyatt and his family may get all the praise, but I have something better, respect. I earned that respect when I took down that bastard Luca.” Amberhill said getting up as he walked in front of his men before stopping at Clyde.<br />
<br />
“Trisha, who’s this?” He asked his secretary while not taking his eyes of Clyde.<br />
<br />
“Clyde sir, he’s one of our new recruits to replace the ones that your daughter is dealing with.” Trisha answered as she just slightly glanced up at the man before looking back down at her digital notepad.<br />
<br />
“Oh, right. You ever been in a dog fight before Clyde? It can get pretty brutal.” Amberhill asked as Clyde nodded.<br />
<br />
Clyde seemed to stare a little too long at Amberhill’s scarred eye before he noticed and lowered his eyebrows at him.<br />
<br />
“It’s impolite to stare boy.” Amberhill said as Clyde nodded and tried to looked around the room instead.<br />
<br />
“I’m....I’m very sorry sir, it’s just, I had heard about the brawl with....uh....Luca, but I didn’t realize that he had...uh.....” Clyde tried to reply as he stammered his words while looking directly into the alpha’s eye. Amberhill then placed a very firm and strong hand onto Clyde’s shoulder.<br />
<br />
“You know, there are times when I would hurt a man very badly for staring at me as much as you have. But since it’s your first day here, I’ll let it go. But know if you ever come into this office and stare at me like you have been...” Henry Amberhill warned as he shifted into his werewolf form with his suit stretching out and Amberhill glared at Clyde’s eyes. “I might not be as lenient as now.” The imposing werewolf said as he gave Clyde a slight push onto the floor.<br />
<br />
Then Trish answered her cellphone, “Mr. Amberhill’s office, how may I help you?” Trisha asked into the phone as her eyes then suddenly looked surprised.<br />
<br />
“Sir, it’s Mr. Casseus of New Horizon, he has a proposition for you which is related in regards to the now confirmed rumor of one Caleb Moreland.” Trisha said as her boss’s interest seemed to change as he shifted back into his human form.<br />
<br />
Clyde took a few heavy breaths as some Clyde’s hiring manager came over to him to caution what happens the next time he says or does anything to Mr. Amberhill.<br />
<br />
“Casseus, May I call you Dustin? I hear you have some good news for me?” Amberhill asked as he listened to Casseus’s proposition.<br />
<br />
“No, of course not, it’ll be simple with that Moreland asshole incapacitated. He’s got a brother though, right? The punk with the crutch?” The pack leader listened a little more to Casseus as he spoke before giving a little smile.<br />
<br />
“I’d be happy to take you up on your offer sir. No, thank you for your cooperation.” He said with a smile on his face.<br />
<br />
“Boys it’s a day to celebrate, we’re one step closer to Eliana Hoti and her property. Trisha, where’s Effie? I need to tell her the good news.” Henry Amberhill asked Trisha as she looked at her watch.<br />
<br />
“She should be down in your parking garage dealing with a couple of your defectors.” Trisha answered as he shook his head.<br />
<br />
“Always wants to make a big spectacle, never wants to do anything quietly.” Henry Amberhill said as he called his daughter’s number of Trisha’s phone.<br />
<br />
Down below in the parking garage of Amberhill’s building, two beaten up and thin looking young men were on the floor with and panting very heavily as a woman with half shaved blonde hair crouched down to look at the two and made several “tsking” sounds with her mouth, her lip piercing shining when it caught the light. She wore a white tuxedo shirt, undone to show off her cleavage, and black suit pants with short black cowgirl boots.<br />
<br />
“Now, now boys, a little birdie told me that you two were considering leaving my father’s pack. “ she then kicked one of them in the stomach and clawed the other with her long nails. “So now, tell me: what makes you think either of you can leave my this family after everything he’s done for you?” The frightening woman said as she rubbed the back of her hands against the faces of the two scared men with the ends of her fingernails lightly pricking their faces. Both men opened their mouths but were too frightened to bring themselves to answer.<br />
<br />
“Alright, here’s what’s going to happen. I won’t use little ol’ ‘Effie Jr’.” The woman, Effie, said, tucking her gold plated .50 desert eagle into the front of her suit pants. She then took out a sterling silver, Pearl handle colt single-action army and rubbed it against her face and let out a moan. “No, what I’m going to do is give you two a chance, with a little Russian roulette, a favorite past time game of mine. So I’ll just put one bullet in here and spin the barrel and we’ll see which one of you gets to live longer.” Effie said with a malicious grin on her face.<br />
<br />
Both men trembled terribly as they awaited one of their fates. Effie continued to grin, until a cellphone began to ring.<br />
<br />
“God....fucking damn it! Who’s the asshole who’s....? For fucks sake,” Effie said as she answered her phone. “Trisha, what the fuck do you think you’re....oh, hi daddy, how are you?” Effie said immediately changing her tone of voice to a sweet tone over the phone.<br />
<br />
“What am I doing? Come on daddy! I’m just enforcing your law like you asked me to.” Effie replied as she listened to her father her father had to say and a little grin formed on her face. “Sure, sounds like great fun, daddy, I’ll be in your office soon to get the full details. Bye, kisses!” Effie said with a false sound of happiness as her eye twitched and she took a deep breath. Effie now looked over at the two scared men.<br />
<br />
“You know what? I’m in a bit of a good mood with the information my father just gave me. So you two run along back to whatever shithole you were born out of, and stay there a while.” Effie said as the two men looked at each other with a little confusion before looking at her again.<br />
<br />
“You two deaf?! Get the hell out of my sight!” Effie yelled at the two as they got up and ran away from Effie Amberhill and her men. Effie opened her barrel gun to look inside and looked at the gun barrel having all six rounds filled. She hadn’t exactly lied, there was one bullet in there, among five others.<br />
<br />
Effie put away her revolver and took out ‘Effie Jr.’ as she looked at the two running men. She tapped the barrel of her gun against her chin thinking.<br />
<br />
“Tell me something Rodriguez, which one of them first suggested to leave?” Effie asked one of her men.<br />
<br />
“The....the one of the left, ma’am.” Rodriguez answered.<br />
<br />
“The left you say? Good, now I have a target.” Effie said as she aimed ‘Effie Jr.’ to the man on the left and fired.<br />
<br />
BAM!<br />
<br />
She lowered her aim and pointed towards the other and fired again.<br />
<br />
BAM!<br />
<br />
The man cried out on the ground as he clutched his leg.<br />
<br />
“Bring him to the meat locker…I’m not finished with him.” She smiled wickedly and turned to leave.<br />
<br />
She adjusted her loose blue tie and grabbed her black suit jacket and threw it over her shoulders. The blonde reached the elevator and hit the penthouse button.<br />
<br />
When she reached the top she walked up to her father’s office and sauntered in. She dropped her jacket on Trisha’s desk and threw one of the chairs facing Henry’s desk and flipped it around before sitting, her arms leaning on the back.<br />
<br />
“What‘s the good news? I was having fun.” She asked lighting up a cigarette.<br />
<br />
The fox woman swiped the city from her mouth, “No smoking in the office.” She said.<br />
<br />
“Tell me daddy: are you fucking her or is she really just your assistant?” Effie asks.<br />
<br />
Henry exhales before turning to his sociopathic offspring.<br />
<br />
“Effie, listen, I was just speaking with Dustin Casseus of New Horizon.” Henry began to explain.<br />
<br />
“What? Don’t tell me you want me to have a play-date with that skank daughter of his? I fucking hate that little bitch Misty or Misery, or whatever the fuck her name is.” Effie rambled.<br />
<br />
“Mister Casseus has confirmed with me that Caleb Moreland was indeed recently incapacitated. He’s still alive, but fortunately for us, he won’t be coming along to save Eliana Hoti’s little ass from us.” Henry explained to his daughter who gave a grin at the news.<br />
<br />
“So you want me to go over to his house and finish the job and steal his crappy cowboy hat?” Effie excitedly asked holding up ‘Effie Jr.’.<br />
<br />
“No.”<br />
<br />
“Figures. I’m stronger than anyone else in the pack, and you stuck me with the boring shit. I wanted to kill a Moreland!” Effie said crossing her arms.<br />
<br />
“I guarantee you’re going to get excited for this. Since Caleb Moreland won’t be a problem anymore for us, we can move along with getting Mrs. Hoti’s land from her. I also got word from Casseus that Mrs. Hoti also has a daughter,” Effie seemed to lean forward in her chair at this mention. “And what’s more, she has a roommate with a daughter of her own around the same age. So it seems like you’ll have some playmates on this one.” Henry said getting her daughter excited again as she spun around in the chair.<br />
<br />
“Pfff. Taking out a couple kids ain’t a problem. I bet they’ll scream for mommy the second I show up.” Effie scoffs.<br />
<br />
“There is however unfortunately a catch in your little plan for Mrs. Hoti’s daughter as well as her friend’s daughter.” Trisha said as looked up from her digital notepad.<br />
<br />
“Fuck Trisha, why do you have to be the thorn in my father’s side? Fine, what’s the fucking catch with the brats?” Effie sighed as she leaned back in the chair.<br />
<br />
“According to Mr. Casseus as well as the Dark Garden, Eliana Hoti’s roommate as well as her daughter have powers related to a quote ‘Japanese Magical Girl Show shit’ as Dark Garden put it.” Trisha explained.<br />
<br />
“Of course, because everyone and their fucking bitch of a daughter has to have some kind of magic shit. Still I guess it will be interesting.” Effie tossed her cigarette into the wastebasket while it was still lit as Trisha dumped some water into it to stop it from burning.<br />
<br />
“This sounds like it’ll be fun and all and I am definitely looking forward to it.” Effie said as she applied lipstick while looking in a mirror.<br />
<br />
“Call me back when we get to planning. I’ve got to go see that punk in the meat locker. I like to make them feel uncomfortable before the pain.” Effie smirked as she left the office and kissed ‘Effie Jr.’<br />
<br />
“I am relieved her gun is the closest thing to a child she’ll ever have.” Trisha said as Henry gave a slight chuckle.<br />
<br />
“Yeah well, she killed the last six men I tried to set her up with…I don’t know where I went wrong with her.” He sighed.<br />
<br />
“Trisha, get me a layout of Hoti’s land, I want to have the element of surprise on our side this time,” Henry said as Trisha nodded. “Boys, get the rest of the pack ready, in a few days time, Eliana Hoti and her whole family will be on their knees in front of me.” Henry Amberhill said crossing his fingers as his men left the office while he and Trisha looked over the area.</p>
