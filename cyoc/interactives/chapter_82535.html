<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;What the fuck happened to you?!&quot; Darren almost yelled, eyes suddenly wider but trying to be quiet as not to wake the still sleeping Mark.<br />
<br />
Ben looked back to the mirror, and the chubuscular, slightly older, lightly hairy hunk staring back at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not sure ...&quot; he said, rubbing his small gut with one hand, &quot;but I feel fucking great...&quot; and he eyed Darren and stretched, making sure to show off his new muscle by tensing his arms and flexing his pecs in the process. Darren noticed, his eyes following the new curves.<br />
<br />
Normally Ben wasn't so cocky, in fact he had never been one who could even be described as cocky, but at the moment he felt so freaking horny he didn't care. His now-larger cock was still thumping against the towel wrapped around his waist, and watching Darren check him out was making that feeling <br />
stronger. Darren didn't seem to have noticed Ben's larger-than-average bulge, but he was still staring.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're ... like, bigger&quot; Darren noted, and stepped into the bathroom, closing the door behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I had a uh ... growth spurt or something,&quot; Ben said, still trying to figure it out himself and checking himself out as he cupped a flexed bicep.<br />
<br />
That's when he noticed that he wasn't alone in the boner department. Darren too had a huge bulge in his boxers, and it looked like it needed attention. <br />
<br />
Darren came up beside Ben and realised suddenly that he had to look up to the formerly younger jock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude ... you're taller too&quot; he said in almost a whisper, &quot;I was always taller than you&quot;.<br />
<br />
Ben looked down and smirked, &quot;not any more little guy,&quot; he said, and in his eyes something glinted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I ... I mean, if it's not weird - could you flex your arm again?&quot; Darren asked awkwardly, thinly containing his excitement as Ben turned back to the mirror, and flexed one arm. His bicep bulged out in a powerful sphere of jock muscle, and Darren absently reached up and touched it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go on, squeeze,&quot; Ben said quietly, watching as Darren's eyes widened at the sensation of feeling muscularity far bigger than his own.<br />
<br />
Darren complied, and Ben turned to him, eyes locked onto Darren's as the now smaller man felt him up, hands roaming from bicep to bulging shoulder, then to pec, and finally to hairy midsection, to skirt along the towel at Ben's waist.<br />
<br />
Ben couldn't take it any more, he grabbed Darren by the waist and pushed him backward against the wall, his tongue going in for a kiss and his hands roaming under Darren's t-shirt to find hard, cobblestone abs on a ripped torso only a dedicated athlete could achieve. Ben's hands moved up Darren's sides as <br />
the pair kissed, Darren moaning slightly and his boner threatening to burst out of his boxers, a large patch of pre-cum already darkening the fabric.<br />
<br />
Ben pushed his hips into Darrren now, and pinned the smaller man against the wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't know you wanted this ...&quot; Ben said quietly, breaking the kiss in between breaths.<br />
<br />
Inside Darrren's head, things were going haywire. The sensations of being touched, and touching this raw, powerful hunk in front of him were completely overwhelming his sense of reason, which, if he'd listened, was calling out in confusion. He was straight! Why was he doing this? But instead of paying <br />
attention, his hands were gripping the bulky shoulders of the stud in his reach, feeling the soft skin, and the powerful bulges underneath, and now he was grinding, thumping his cock into his roomie like an animal.<br />
<br />
Ben stepped back, and Darren, as if knowing what Ben wanted, ripped the towel off his roomie's waist, and knelt down.<br />
<br />
NO! STOP! His conscience yelled, and for a moment, he listened to it, but then he was face-to-face with a cock almost twice the size <br />
of his own, and his mouth opened up.<br />
<br />
Ben tilted his head back in ecstasy as his roomie went down on him, sucking like he never knew Darren was capable. Ben had been so sure that Darren was straight, nothing otherwise had ever crossed his mind. But now, it was like Darren had been doing this for years.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...&quot; Ben moaned as the now younger jock took his meat and deap-throated it, pounding Ben into a stupor.<br />
<br />
Ben was getting closer, his balls tensing, and pleasure flooding through him. He grabbed Darren's hair, and forced him into a rhythm, back, forward, back, forward, back, forward. &quot;Oh fuck ... amazing&quot; Ben whispered.<br />
<br />
He was getting closer, closer, his breathing becoming shallower, and it was like Darren could feel it. He took control of the rhythm himself and sucked, waiting for what he knew was about to come.<br />
<br />
Then with a small roar, Ben came, exploding down Darren's throat and the younger jock took the orgasm with enthusiasm, swallowing the whole load, and moaning himself while cumming powerfully at the same time into his boxers.<br />
<br />
It seemed like the orgasms lasted twenty seconds or so, and then, finally, the two collapsed onto the bathroom rug in each other's arms. The afterglow kept them still for a few minutes, both breathing heavily, and Ben realised that both of them would need another shower, covered in sweat and somehow also <br />
Darren's cum.<br />
<br />
Ben sighed, thinking of their other roomie, Mark, still asleep in the other room.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope he doesn't find out about this&quot; he thought worriedly.<br />
<br />
Mark was difficult, he was so straight, and pretty homophobic. That's why Ben had come out to Darren. Darren was different, and now he had proved it! But Mark was a tough one, and had Ben a bit afraid sometimes. He could be violent, which probably came from all the workout supplements he used. He was <br />
always trying to get buff, but never succeeding because of his insane metabolism ... &quot;but he's so hot&quot;, Ben thought, thinking of Mark's ripped body.<br />
<br />
But instead of getting bigger, Mark just kept getting more ripped, and it annoyed him to no end. This aggravation came to a head the last time he had been dumped by a girl, when he had punched a hole through the front door.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish he could just grow up a bit,&quot; Ben thought, not realising he had just triggered another wish.<br />
<br />
Then Ben got distracted as Darren stroked his newly enlarged calf muscles, and Ben looked into the eyes of the young man in his arms, and counted himself pretty lucky as he began to bone up yet again...</p>
