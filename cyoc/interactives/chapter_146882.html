<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well... everything does appear in order,&quot; Jeremy spoke as he looked down at the clipboard in his hand.<br />
<br />
The clipboard was about the normal size for it and the normal sized writing on it would come off as proportionately small when compared to his massive clawed hands after his conversion to be with Heather. However, he had found things that confirmed a fair number of things that Rex had theorized on and had discussed with other paleontologists regarding the eyesight of Theropods at least. And that was that they actually had extremely good vision, particularly the Tyrannosaurs with more forward facing eyes. They didn&#39;t have limited vision the way they did in movies, though there was some debate over how much of that in Dinotopians was based on the fossil DNA and how much was on the Human DNA that it would be mixed with.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though... if you&#39;d like, there could be some offers we could make,&quot; Jeremy spoke as he looked from the clipboard to the woman who stood before him. <br />
<br />
She was dressed largely in black and carried herself a bit nervously. He thought it was fear at first, given his appearance as a Syntixisaurus Rex. The hybrid species of Theropod might have enough Tyrannosaurus Rex DNA to qualify as a subspecies of Tyrannosaurus, but there were the other features that had the potential frighten those not expecting to come face to face with a Dinotopian. However, after a moment the woman actually seemed to grip herself for a moment, which struck Jeremy more as shame than anything else. That jogged his memory to the notes he&#39;d gotten on her request. She&#39;d apparently had past employment with a genre themed strip club that had little interest in doing things the &quot;right&quot; and that had caused some health problems. And while better doctors would resolve those immediate issues, that wasn&#39;t to say that the woman was one hundred percent better.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what... Project Mesozoic is open to the public now,&quot; the woman commented in a low tone, &quot;it&#39;s not like you could offer to reimburse me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is open, yes,&quot; Jeremy nodded, &quot;and for that reason, you will still have some fees that you will be responsible for. But Therizinosaurus is not a species we have real data on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it&#39;s hardly that different... it is a Theropod and isn&#39;t the largest even it its part of the world,&quot; the woman looked to Jeremy, &quot;hasn&#39;t most of your testing more in relation to the size issue for Dinotopians?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is the general concern...&quot; Jeremy nodded, &quot;but Therizinosaurus also presents some unique differences from the typical Theropod. In this many of the museums that have Therizinosaurus fossils have stated they would want some data on you post transformation. Some of it is probably to confirm reconstruction theories and specifically on Therizinosaurus&#39;s diet. That sort of thing, and we can compensate you for that... at least partially.&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman seemed to nod and accept that, and from there the process kept going...<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take too long for Agatha Julien to fill out the paperwork that would relate to some of the testing agreements that Horizon had wanted for her conversion. She accepted it rather well, mostly as it did relieve some of the issues that she&#39;d had to deal with for much of her life. She&#39;d always been into things that were darker and weird than most of those she knew what she was young. It was something that left her a bit isolated at times, and had been partially for her taking the name &quot;Nightwing&quot; as opposed to her given name. Of course a lot of that in turn only lead her into a situation she&#39;d found herself poorly prepared for, particularly when she found out that the club she&#39;d &quot;joined&quot; did much of its business on the black market.<br />
<br />
The black market surgeons rushed their job and from what Nightwing had found out later, was that they had been forced to leave the main hospitals they&#39;d been at for issues that bordered on malpractice. Though by that time, she&#39;d already ben having pain as a result of the things they&#39;d done and had to have their enhancements removed. The removal had ultimately fixed the &quot;pain&quot; issue, but even that had left scars and Nightwing had tried hard to cover them up and find some sort of cleansing that had gone on. She&#39;d had some odd jobs here and there that let her put food on the table and get away from prying eyes, but that didn&#39;t necessarily fix everything. <br />
<br />
Then she&#39;d come across one of the ads that Horizon had put out that advertised Project Mesozoic being on the market with the offer of a new life and a new confidence with it. Thus, her decision to join, though she did with her own opinion to be something more unique. Therizinosaurus thus made an obvious choice, a medium sized Theropod that ate plants and had extremely long claws on its hands. That would certainly stand out in a way that would be new and let her move past her own past. And once all the paperwork was in order, she followed male Dinotopian that she&#39;d spoken with and one human nurse, who was carrying two needles and one alcohol swab through Horizon&#39;s hallways to one of the transformation rooms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... here we are,&quot; Jeremy said slowly as he opened the door to the transformation room and held it open as Nightwing and the Horizon nurse followed.<br />
<br />
Nightwing slowly sat on the bed and watched as the nurse placed the needles in Jeremy&#39;s hand while then working to prepare the alcohol swab. He stood calmly in what was more of a supervisor&#39;s role, which Nightwing guessed was due to the fact that the needles were tiny in his hands. She&#39;d heard that the Dinotopians would be getting their own colony city in Texas by the summer and she figured that if Horizon opened offices there, which they tended to do with all of Animalia&#39;s colonies to cover either conversions or medical needs for the Animalians as well, that would mean that syringes designed to carry a human dosage but sufficiently large enough for a Dinotopian to be able to handle would probably be delivered to the new offices there.<br />
<br />
But while Nightwing knew that she would grow quite a bit when she transformed and that she had done some stripping professionally with a genre themed nightclub, she wasn&#39;t going to take her clothes off until she had more privacy. All of that was something she didn&#39;t want to return to, and regardless of Animalian libido, she had no intent of doing so again. That whole path had got her in the position she&#39;d been in where she&#39;d needed corrective surgery to repair damage done by quacks, and even that hadn&#39;t fully healed everything. And so she watched as the nurse then rubbed the alcohol swab on her arm and then took the needles from Jeremy to administer the two shots.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to Animalia,&quot; Jeremy spoke politely as the Human nurse delivered the injections, &quot;we&#39;ll see to getting you some cloths that will fit the new you better once your transformation is finished.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have clothing for a Therizinosaurus already?&quot; Nightwing asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;More that we have clothing for a Theropod of comparable size,&quot; Jeremy answered, &quot;that&#39;s about all that I can say at the moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that, Jeremy and the nurse left, leaving Nightwing alone in the room. She could already feeling the room grow warmer as the door shut, and once she heard that click she prepared herself for what was already beginning. As she got her shoes and socks off, she could already see her feet beginning to change heavily. The nails on her toes were starting to lengthen and grow pointed. Her smaller toes were starting pull together and almost merge. It was an odd sensation and for a moment, Nightwing focused on it as the skin on her feet began to turn gray.<br />
<br />
Though the room was growing ever warmer and at the same time she also began to feet a bit itchy while also feeling a sort of sensation that was pulling her ring and pinky fingers together. That brought her attention to her hands, and she could now see her last tow fingers merging together, just as her toes were. At the same time her fingernails were also beginning to grow pointed and stretch out from her fingertips. Nightwing could also see what was casing the itching as well. A downy coat of creamish-tan feathers were starting to grow out on her forearms, and Nightwing figured that this was occurring under her clothing as well, and the interaction between her present clothing and her newly grown feathers was making things rather itchy for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Better get going,&quot; Nightwing thought to herself, knowing that her transformation was now going in earnest. Even as she felt her neck seem to stretch with her head rising higher into the air.<br />
<br />
She got to her now three toed feet and began wrestling with the button on her pants. She managed, but as her pinkie and ring fingers completed their merging, her finger claws began to accelerate their growth, growing longer and longer. She got her pants down, reveal that the gray skin on her increasingly digitigrade feet came up to her knee before transitioning into the creamish-tan feathers  on the outer side of her thighs. By now with her fingers thickening and the claws growing longer and longer, there would be some dexterity issues. She still had her thumbs, and strangely they hadn&#39;t changed much, if at all. They had a similar shaped claws to the ones on her fingers, but the ones on her thumbs were nowhere near as long. She gripped at the back her shirt and began to pull it off, as she did so she began to realize how long her neck was actually getting as her shirt came off.<br />
<br />
Nightwing managed a small sigh of relief as she got her shirt off, and managed to look herself over, finding her new neck to be far more flexible, possibly with new bones added in. It allowed her to get a better look at the feathers that were covering her body. They were mostly a creamish-tan, but there seemed to be a speckling of darker brown feathers here and there, though the feathers were rather primitive in nature and there was no indication of more &quot;wing-like&quot; feathers on her arms. By this point though, her face began to push forward with the facial bones audibly cracking has pushed into a rather beaklike muzzle with a harder lip on upper front of her jaw. She managed to stagger her way toward the mirror, and she could see the grayish skin on her new muzzle while her teeth had largely stayed about the same.<br />
<br />
At the same time, she soon felt her bra and panties begin to grow tight on her. In the mirror, she could see her hips widening and she could feel pressure at the base of her spine. She looked down to see her breasts also beginning to swell inside her bra. Her muscles were also swelling as well. Though the biggest thing was that as her breasts swelled larger, she began to see patches of wetness form in the cups of her bra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh,&quot; Nightwing gave a rather husky moan as despite the tightness in her underwear, things were actually feeling rather good. She managed to wrestle her panties down without destroying them, and that revealed a growing tail that was starting to stretch out behind her. Her bra, however, was not so fortunate. As her back muscles grew larger to help support the growing mass of her breasts, the hooks on the material began to break and snap. She managed to get her thumb behind her back and near her bra&#39;s clasp, but the material was growing tighter as her swelling breasts to the point where it was really starting to pinch. With that she raised up her hand and got her thumb inside the front cup of the bra. And with one great pull, the fabric and the hooks in the bra finally snapped and Nightwing was left to bounce free, letting her give a relieved sigh as all that pressure was released. &quot;Ahhhh.&quot;<br />
<br />
From there, she slowly began to examine the new her in the mirror. There was a small splattering of milk on the reflective glass, but then Nightwing had expected that coming in. Female Animalians that were seventeen or older seemed to always be lactating, regardless of whether or not they were pregnant, in this becoming a Dinotopian would be no different for her. And there wasn&#39;t too much there, so it would be easy to clean and it didn&#39;t obstruct her view of herself. And as she looked in the mirror, Nightwing felt her self smile and actually feel happy, in a way. She felt better and looked stronger than ever. <br />
<br />
The feathers on her neck, particularly on the underside of her neck, were thinner there than they were elsewhere on her body, letting her see some of the grayish colored skin through those feathers there. And this sort of continued down her under side. The creamish-tan feathers were there, but they were thinner on the inside of her neck, chest, the juncture between her legs, and her inner this. The thinner feathers on her chest made her erect nipples more visible at the moment, though Nightwing wasn&#39;t too focused on that at the moment. It wasn&#39;t what many people had expected with dinosaurs, but in some recent years she&#39;d occasionally see some news reports when someone apparently found evidence of feathers with dinosaurs, which was in turn different from how dinosaurs had always been portrayed.<br />
<br />
And as a Therizinosaurus Dinotopian, she knew she was also very different from most of the other Theropod Dinotopians that were there. She&#39;d seen some of the news reports on Heather&#39;s activities when she arrived in Lyre and how her hybrid species, the Syntixisaurus Rex was different from the species that made up most of the Syntixisaurus&#39;s genetic origins. But Therizinosaurus was still completely different. Despite being a Theropod, the group known for its meat eaters, it was actually a plant eater, regardless of what one might think when looking at the long claws that Nightwing now sported.<br />
<br />
And that difference had lead to a few differences in Therizinosaurus and its relatives in that they were thought to be a bit more &quot;pot bellied&quot; than other Theropods. That sort of carried over as she looked herself over in the mirror. She wasn&#39;t overweight in the sense that she was carrying a lot of fat around her midsection, and her abs were about as well defined as any other Animalian after their conversion or uplifting. But with her wide hips with a bit larger and firmer butt than she&#39;d had before, in addition to having much larger breasts than she&#39;d had before, even counting when she&#39;d had the implants, Nightwing found that she was a bit more on the &quot;thick&quot; side of things. That didn&#39;t drop her confidence, however, and she found herself smiling in the mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do look good,&quot; Nightwing mused to herself while cupping one breast. She wasn&#39;t anywhere near as big as the breasts that she&#39;d seen on the two Sauropod Dinotopians, Jen and Marjorie, but they were a bit bigger than Heather and Tyra&#39;s. And while she had no plans to get involved with the Meat Market or what would be its equivalent in the Dinotopian colony when it was built, that didn&#39;t mean she didn&#39;t have satisfaction in her new form.<br />
<br />
She then made her way to the door and reached for the latch, noticing that the ceiling was much closer to her head now, and that she actually had to tuck her neck down to get it through the door. She found Jeremy waiting politely with some clothing in his hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe I&#39;m ready for my new clothes,&quot; Nightwing announced making Jeremy turn to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You may have to make due with some things that aren&#39;t black,&quot; Jeremy spoke as he offered a gray shirt and a pair of light blue wind-pants, &quot;Ms. Nightwing…&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually... I&#39;d think I&#39;d go back to my given name... Agatha,&quot; Agatha spoke, &quot;Or Aggie for short. Nightwing… that was something that that strip club sorta forced on me when I was looking for people that would accept my interest in darker things... Yet... now... strangely, I feel happy. Content. Confident.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would seem fairly consistent with many Animalians after their conversion or uplifting,&quot; Jeremy commented as Aggie reached one had through the opening in the doorway. It was enough to preserve her modesty and let her get the clothing that would fit the new her, &quot;diseases and many other things seem to go... though there can be times where instincts can be a concern.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... something in the back of my mind is &quot;screaming&quot; Tarbosaurus when I look to you now... and that is nervous,&quot; Aggie admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... Tarbosaurus lived around the same time as Therizinosaurus and its possible the Tyrannosaurus relative may have preyed on Therizinosaurus from time to time,&quot; Jeremy commented, &quot;and with Syntixisaurus being mostly Tyrannosaurus in its genetic make up... I would imagine my appearance would spark some self preservation instincts...&quot;<br />
<br />
Aggie nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;But no one will harm you,&quot; Jeremy then assured her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, they won&#39;t want to deal with these!&quot; Aggie flexed her fingers moving her gigantic claws up and down. She knew she&#39;d probably have a practice to see on how dexterous she was now, and those long claws would be a hinderance in that regard, but she felt confident that she could manage it. After all, with all the digital and computer stuff that people were getting into, it wouldn&#39;t be too long before things like writing with pen and paper became things of the past.</p>
