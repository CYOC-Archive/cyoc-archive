<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Sam was probably taking more to the racial transformation than anything else, it seemed that he wasn&#39;t quite a twink yet. Being that he was only three days into his transformation as opposed to Gabe and Terry, who were nearing on four or five days as of today. Sam usually had his hair spiked up as a way of distinguishing himself on the field, but now, due to his transformation underway, it really did look like Sam was &quot;believing it&quot;.<br />
<br />
Danny felt a little disappointed when he realized that fact that Sam wasn&#39;t quite as far along as Gabe and Terry, swearing to himself as he remembered that at day 3 not even Gabe and Terry had been exactly flamingly gay yet. Though there were still some hints toward that. Sam had proceeded down, and asked a few people if Jackson had said anything about him. When he was told he hadn&#39;t been mentioned, Sam shook his head and on some level seemed disappointed.<br />
<br />
Danny watched from the upstairs though as he saw Sam join the crowd in the party. It wasn&#39;t like, though, there wasn&#39;t going to be some enjoyment to be had in this...<br />
<br />
Sam had been hoping to see something like Jackson drunk enough to call him a hottie, which for whatever reason would&#39;ve really interested him. But well, here we go. Instead Sam saw that Jackson had indeed shaved his head - among other things. Sam swore that Jackson seemed older somehow, but he didn&#39;t know if it was just his perception or if it was a legitimate observation. Still, he really loved these thrumming parties. By now the shirts had come off of a couple guys, and Sam found his eyes wandering.<br />
<br />
When Jackson&#39;s shirt came off though, he couldn&#39;t help but stare.<br />
<br />
Sam still considered himself a straight man - at least so far - but once the shirt came off he couldn&#39;t help but look. Jackson was looking more heavily muscled than ever, tight, toned abs under a shelf of pecs that almost made Sam feel something he hadn&#39;t expected to. He came down here expecting to tease Jackson about voicing some attraction to him, but here he was. &quot;W-Wow! Looking great, Jackson!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Sammy, welcome to the party. Didn&#39;t expect to see you around...are you trimming for Soccer?&quot; Jackson asked, looking Sam over. He didn&#39;t see anything wrong with his face more with his build.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that I am, I&#39;m trying to make sure I&#39;m lighter on my feet.&quot; At least, that was what Sam told himself was going on. Tell the truth, he could tell something was more than a little off about himself as of now...but it had been so far not making him exactly worse as a soccer player, so maybe he could just see what was happening.<br />
<br />
The blond soccer player took a seat near some other guys, finding himself needing to get a glass of water to deal with his parched mouth. Sam really hadn&#39;t expected Jackson&#39;s physique to hit him half as hard as it did. Heh, hard. Sam looked down at his shorts and saw his manhood, still thick and capable, half hard in his shorts. He needed to find a girl here right? Someone able to handle this for him. Maybe if he could get Sasha to help him out here.<br />
<br />
For some reason he was feeling really tempted to just take care of this himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright!&quot; Jackson clapped his hands together and stood up, &quot;Just got a great idea. How&#39;d you guys like to try out a fitness challenge? Try and do more push ups, sit ups, and any variations therein - and see if you can beat me.&quot; Some whoops from the crowd as the guys in the afterparty started trying to come up with who should try for this first.<br />
<br />
Sam found himself feeling oddly excited at the thought of working out alongside Jackson. Even though he was half hard in his shorts. Sam gulped and stepped forward first, &quot;I&#39;ll give it a try!&quot; Sam felt some of the guys clapping his shoulders and someone even slapped his ass playfully, which made Sam bite his lip with how good that felt. He wondered about all these weird things he was experiencing lately. The weight shifts, the way his handsome face seemed different...ah, it was probably just all Sam being nervous!<br />
<br />
Danny meanwhile watched the undergoing &quot;fitness challenge&quot; but decided to keep off and observe. It seemed Jackson wasn&#39;t growing any older tonight, though he didn&#39;t even know already how physically old he was at any rate. How healthy he was didn&#39;t help, though Danny swore he could tell Jackson was probably nearing his mid-thirties. And he still considered himself a teen who was probably gonna attend school the next day!<br />
<br />
Danny was honestly amused by the idea, enough that he could get over his anger at their little discourse. After all, it&#39;d all be pretty funny once he saw this 45 year old man desperately trying to pass himself off as a teenager. As he walked by the bathroom, he thought he heard something going on inside. Something distinctly sexual. His cock pulsed, though he didn&#39;t really intend to look in very much and see who was doing who in there...<br />
<br />
He listened in and remembered that day at the gym. The way these two sounded. Could it be...? Yes. It sounded like Gabe and Terry were in there, having quite a time with themselves.<br />
<br />
Gabe moaned as he felt Terry really push his manhood up in him, shivering at the sensation. Even still trying to tell himself he was just doing this to deal with his &quot;thoughts&quot;. Terry on the other hand was grinning like a fool as he thrust away into Gabe&#39;s ass. This was one of the only times Terry would be on top at least first in any sexual relationship. He verbally at least played to Gabe&#39;s little obsession...even though he was himself far beyond it by this point.<br />
<br />
Terry looked in the mirror in the bathroom, seeing himself poised over Gabe, and almost came then and there.<br />
<br />
&quot;D-Dude...can I try being on top soon as you&#39;re done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Soon as I&#39;m done, Gabey.&quot; Terry felt himself getting closer and closer, and he gasped, falling forward and gripping Gabe&#39;s thin torso as he kept pumping his hips, &quot;And that&#39;ll be really soon, Gabey. And I&#39;m a man of my word...&quot; Terry let out a long, feminine moan and emptied his cock into Gabe. As soon as he was done, he merrily got up and repositioned, not even the wiser that they had an eavesdropper.<br />
<br />
Danny wondered what&#39;d happen if Gabe and Terry got discovered now...nah, that was far too cruel. Still, he could almost wonder how these two would continue changing during the following days considering how much had happened to them already. Poor Gabe, still thinking somehow that engaging in these activities would clear up his &quot;gay thoughts&quot;. He really latched on hard to that catharsis nonsense when Terry brought it up.<br />
<br />
Something apparently that Terry himself no longer paid any heed to. Danny was honestly surprised though when he thought he heard Terry utter something in Korean through the door. Seemed something else was happening with those two.<br />
<br />
That was when he got a notification, letting him know that apparently another transformation would be starting. Brady from the basketball team would be the next to be starting his transformation, alongside Tristan. Danny remembered that Tristan and Brady were best friends, and probably were hanging out today instead of being at the party. It should be interesting seeing how this worked, considering Brady was half-African American on his mother&#39;s side.</p>
