<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jason had been sitting on the couch when Ty had knocked on the door. He hadn't exactly been dressed in the most decent of clothing. To be quite honest, he hadn't been wearing anything at all.<br />
<br />
When Ty had knocked on the door, Jason had been sitting on the couch with his legs elevated in the air, and two fingers gently massaging his asshole. A gay friend of his had suggested he try anal masturbation, and so Jason was eager to test it, to see if the feeling was as pleasurable as it had been described.<br />
<br />
Jason had found out, that it was.<br />
<br />
Ty had knocked on the door at the most inconvenient of times. Jason had quickly stood to his feet and thrown on his undershorts, but that was it. Answering the door in his underpants was better than answering the door completely nude.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I come in?&quot; Ty asked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, sure.&quot; Jason said, too embarrassed to refuse.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Ty closed his eyes. Jason was acting a tad odd. Perhaps he could look back a bit and discover what had been going on. He smirked as the mental images of Jason's masturbation flashed into his mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cute.&quot; He thought, &quot;But I bet I could make him cuter still.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, Ty?&quot; Jason asked, &quot;Sorry about my clothing, I just jumped out of the shower.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup,&quot; Ty said, &quot;That would explain why you are completely dry.<br />
<br />
Jason blushed. Ty smirked. Jason was a terrible liar. Still, he was an adorable liar, what with his skinny muscles, and thin legs.<br />
<br />
Ty stared at Jason and decided that the boy had the perfect body to make a small size incredibly adorable. This world could be so ugly, it needed someone with large, brown eyes and cute little body like Jason to keep around.<br />
<br />
He closed his eyes and made a wish on his friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-um...&quot; Jason said, scratching the back of his head.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Jason was mortified. Oh god, Ty knew. He didn't know how he knew, but Ty did. What if Ty found out about Jason's homosexual tendencies? He was ruined. He knew it.<br />
<br />
What was he going to do? He had to lie. Say something homophobic. No, that would be too obvious.<br />
<br />
All the while Jason was growing incredibly uncomfortable. He felt hot, sweaty, and extremely exposed. Jason looked down to notice his briefs were beginning to fall down around his waist, exposing the V on his torso, as well as a recently shaved treasure trail.<br />
<br />
Gulping, Jason pulled the white briefs up. The sweating was getting worse, he noted. It was starting to soak his briefs, causing them to stick to his skin. If this kept up, he might as well be naked in front of Ty.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I-I-I w-w-w-wasn't d-d-d-doing anything.&quot; Jason stammered, barely able to speak.<br />
<br />
Ty stared at him, his eyes suddenly looking very intense, &quot;Of course not.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason looked up at Ty, &quot;S-s-s-so why are you over here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wait? Wasn't he taller than Ty? Or was he just cowering in light of his humiliation?<br />
<br />
He let go of his briefs for a minute in his confusion. They fell around his waist again. He felt a breeze over his butt crack and looked down.<br />
<br />
For some odd reason his underwear was fitting incredibly loose on him.<br />
<br />
What was going on?<br />
<br />
&quot;Ty, please leave. I don't feel so good.&quot; Jason murmured.<br />
<br />
Ty shook his head, &quot;Relax Jason. Lie down on the couch. Everything's going to be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason looked up and realized that he was eye level with Ty's shoulder. Something was happening to him! This was wrong, so, so wrong!<br />
<br />
Still confused, humiliated, and shocked, Jason allowed the increasingly taller boy lead him over to the couch where he sat down. Jason leaned over to look at his feet. He gulped, realizing they no longer touched the floor when he sat down.<br />
<br />
His briefs were becoming increasingly larger on him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ty,&quot; Jason asked, &quot;What's happening to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're becoming cuter, that's all.&quot; Ty said, his eyes sparkling.<br />
<br />
Ty sat down on the couch next to the small boy. He crawled up next to Jason and pushed a bit of hair out of his face. His lips moved towards Jason's forehead.<br />
<br />
Jason's eyes widened. Ty was kissing him. Another boy had kissed him, and he was sitting on a couch, practically naked, and shrinking!<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not gay, Ty.&quot; Jason whispered, sheepishly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course you're not, Ty whispered, as he trailed a finger down towards Jason's briefs, &quot;You're just having an erection because you're almost naked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jason murmured, &quot;Yeah.<br />
<br />
Jason watched his body diminish beneath Ty's gaze. He looked into the large blue eyes of the larger boy. Those eyes were so tender, so caring, and so strong at the same time. <br />
<br />
In moments, Jason's underwear had grown to large to hold his shrinking body. He curled his legs up to his two foot tall body and crawled out of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ty, I'm scared.&quot; He whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll protect you, Jason. Don't worry,&quot; Ty said, &quot;Everything's going to be okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason wanted to believe him. But the question still rang out inside,<br />
<br />
What was happening to him?</p>
