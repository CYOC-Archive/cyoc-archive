<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He couldn&#39;t take it anymore. He couldn&#39;t be human ever again. He was a fox through & through & only felt right as one. He began looking for a way to be a fox only & still support himself & his animal habits. He had a month of time off accumulated so he took it off. He looked online for a 2 weeks before he found it. A job that would fit his fox needs indefinitely. <br />
Adam was kinda surprised when the anthromorphic fox entered the room. He marveled up at fox. The pawed feet, the tail, the head, the fur, everything. He had to get an Animal Costume for himself some day. The fox didn&#39;t take a seat seeming to prefer to stand. Adam started to say Frank but the fox stopped him growling &quot;Don&#39;t call me that. I&#39;m a fox. Refer to me as one.&quot; Adam finding that odd but he went on. &quot;So...Mister Fox you know what you will doing?&quot; Adam asked making sure. &quot;Eating people turned into feral prey animals.&quot; Adam was surprised by how the fox said that. It was like talking to a predatory animal. Adam went on regardless. &quot;Yes. We came up at a very elegant way to handle overcrowding in our prisons for our lifers. Life row inmates. Turning them into feral prey animals for someone that is a predator animal to eat.&quot; The fox stated &quot;That&#39;s why I applied.&quot; Adam questioned &quot;I got to double check. You are ok with eating animals you know are people right?&quot; The fox walked right up to the desk, placed his paw-like hands on the desk lending over staring right into Adam&#39;s eyes. The fox told him &quot;I&#39;m a fox. I&#39;m not a human. That&#39;s why I&#39;m Sealed now.&quot; Adam looked into the fox&#39;s eyes & saw only an animal staring at him. There was no human behind those eyes. &quot;Ok.&quot; Adam said a bit nervous. Adam looked over the paperwork & told the fox &quot;You&#39;re paperwork is in order. I see you are a Shifter too. When can you start?&quot; The fox replied taking his hands off the desk & standing up straight again on his digitgrade paws. &quot;Now.&quot; Adam asked almost nervous &quot;Do you prefer to be referred to by &#39;fox&#39; or your given name?&quot; The fox answered &quot;Fox. Fox only.&quot; Adam wrote that down as a note in any Capital and Bold. &quot;Alright Fox. You monthly payment for this job will be forwarded to your personal bank account each month automatically.&quot; The fox told him &quot;I don&#39;t need money.&quot; Adam confused asked &quot;What?&quot; The fox told him pointing out the window &quot;I have dug a burrow in the field nearby. That&#39;s where I&#39;ll be living.&quot; Adam got up & looked out the window. The fox explained to Adam &quot;I slept & hunt in my feral form. I may be in my feral form most of the time actually.&quot; Now Adam truly got it. &quot;You don&#39;t got anything on you because you live as a wild animal. A wild fox.&quot; Adam asked sure he was right. &quot;Yes human. I am a fox. Period. I don&#39;t need money or clothing or any of that human crap. I just need prey to eat & a safe place to live & sleep.&quot; The fox explained. Adam got up said with a smile &quot;Ok. Then we&#39;ll only give you prey to hunt & eat.&quot; The fox told him &quot;I don&#39;t want to know any of my prey names or anything. I am an animal & so will they be.&quot; Adam nodded understanding saying &quot;I&#39;ll note that too.&quot; &quot;Just use a whistle or something to notify me of prey released in my area. And leave me alone while I hunt and eat it.&quot; Adam nodded with an &quot;Ok.&quot; &quot;I&#39;m hungry. There something for me to eat out there right now?&quot; The fox asked. Adam answered &quot;Actually yes. A brown field rabbit.&quot; The fox opened the door & went out it shifting into his feral form dropping to all fours. Adam watched as the fox took off. Soon the fox found & caught the forementioned rabbit. Adam watched as the fox killed & began to eat the rabbit. [He is a predatory animal through & through.] Adam thought astonished. He acted & ate just like any other fox. Adam walked back over to the desk & grabbed the paperwork for Frank. He took it to his office & fed it through the paper shredder. Adam knew there was no point to have any paperwork for Frank. That was just a wild fox. An animal. An animals don&#39;t need paperwork or jobs. They just do what they do. <br />
The next day the fox in (anthromorphic form) entered the building. Adam showed & used a dog whistle telling the fox this is how they would signal him that they have released prey into his area. Since they new canines like him were the only ones that could hear the whistle not humans. The fox nodded with a pleased &quot;Got it.&quot; Adam added &quot;I figured that this would be acceptable for an animal like you.&quot; The fox nodded agreeing & he left. <br />
5 months passed...<br />
Adam was sitting outside in a chair near the fox&#39;s burrow. The fox came out & Adam asked if he could anthro shift to talk a bit. T the box complied and shifted to his anthromorphic form. &quot;So what you want human?&quot; The fox questioned sitting on the grass. &quot;How you doing?&quot; Adam asked wondering. &quot;Fine.&quot; The fox answered. &quot;Seems so.&quot; Adam stated. &quot;The dog whistle is working great the notifying me of prey in my area.&quot; The fox informed. &quot;I know. And this has been working out great for us too. So our arrangement seems to be working out fine.&quot; Adam informed. The fox nodded. Nothing was said for a few. &quot;You know I&#39;m a wild animal right?&quot; The fox asked stating that. Adam nodded &quot;I am well aware.&quot; The fox leaned back &quot;Thank you for this.&quot; The fox said. Adam got up &quot;No need to thank me. You keep doing what foxes do & you can keep living around here.&quot; The fox got up & said &quot;Of course I will.&quot; Adam informed the fox &quot;Most only know you as a feral fox. No different than any other fox. They think you&#39;re trained to respond to that whistle.&quot; The fox stated as Adam folded up his folding chair &quot;I am just a fox.&quot; Adam smiled &quot;I know.&quot; The fox shifted back to his feral form dropping to all fours. Adam watched the fox go back into his burrow [You are just a wild fox.] Adam thought & he walked away.</p>
