<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Danielle shed her clothes, Brandon took the opportunity to really get a good look at her.  He had found her attractive before, but now as he got a better view his heart skipped a beat.  She wasn't just attractive, she was beautiful!  The fiery red fur covering her body was almost too bright to look directly at, even though the sun was low in the west.  The jet-black fur on forming gloves on all four of her paws and capping her eartips was so dark it seemed to suck the light from around it.  The cream white covering her tailtip and her chest from the chin to the crotch was as pure as the first snowfall of the season.<br />
He found his gaze lingering on her chest, admiring what he saw.  On this closer inspection he realized that below her shapely breasts were two more pairs, although the lower pairs were nearly hidden by her fur.  Brenda might have been a little put-off, but Brandon relished the idea of having a six-breasted girlfriend.  Satisfied with himself, he moved his gaze upwards directly into Danielle's big beautiful eyes.  She had been watching him check her out the whole time, and despite feeling a little uncomfortable about it at first by now she was feeling proud of herself, even striking poses.  She gave Brandon a little wink as he met her eyes.<br />
&quot;Like what you see?&quot; Danielle said with a grin.<br />
Brandon felt a hint of embarrassment at having been caught checking her out, but took it in stride.  &quot;No,&quot; he replied, &quot;I don't like it, I love it!&quot;<br />
At this Brandon swept Danielle off her feet and gave her a passionate kiss that took her by surprise.  Her surprise quickly faded into excitement as she melted into his arms and returned the kiss.  After what seemed like forever he broke off the kiss and gently set her down.<br />
Brandon grinned to himself, realizing that Danielle was in a very receptive mood right now and probably would be quite agreeable to any action he might suggest.  He had made a promise, though, so focused his willpower to resist what he was thinking of.<br />
&quot;We need to find somewhere to take a bath,&quot; Brandon said.  &quot;I think our noses being so sensitive and our scents being so strong is messing with our hormones.  The waterfall ends up in a little lake, and over to the side a little the cliff turns into a hillside that's not to steep to climb down.&quot;<br />
&quot;All right,&quot; Danielle said with an inner sigh.  Truth be told, despite the promise she'd asked for Danielle had really been hoping Brandon would have kept on going.  &quot;Do you think we can make it before dark?&quot;<br />
&quot;I'm not sure, but we can set up camp halfway down if we have to.&quot;  Brandon hoped they wouldn't have to, because he didn't know if he had enough self-control to keep his paws off Danielle if they were to sleep at this point.<br />
* * *<br />
The going had been slower than Brandon expected.  While they were able to gradually work their way downwards, they had to zigzag left and right along the cracked rockface in order to avoid the many parts too steep to descend.  The route started off within sight of the waterfall but had snaked between completely out of sight of it and nearly directly beneath it.  They had made it to a wide ledge about halfway down the cliff, but had been going sideways towards the waterfall for some distance now without finding a slope they could climb down to the next level.<br />
Suddenly Danielle let out a sharp scream and toppled onto Brandon.  Fortunately for the both of them, he was able to turn around quickly enough to catch her without either of them falling over.<br />
&quot;I'm...I'm sorry,&quot; gasped Danielle, &quot;It's starting to get dark and I slipped and I might have hurt us both and-&quot;<br />
Brandon cut her off.  &quot;Don't blame yourself, it's getting hard to see.  We should find somewhere to wait out the night.  I can see a cave just ahead that should be perfect.&quot;<br />
As they entered the cave, they couldn't help but gasp.  Opposite the small entrance they were ducking through was a giant gap in the Western wall providing a perfect view of the sunset.  Even better, near the back was a small pool fed by a small sprinkle of water coming through a crack in the ceiling, which overflowed into a tiny stream emptying out to the Western exit.<br />
&quot;Perfect timing!&quot; Brandon exclaimed.  &quot;We can wash up in the pool and then rest here until morning.  And look at that view of the sunset!  On Earth you'd have to be a millionaire to have a window like that!&quot;<br />
Danielle was awestruck at how beautiful it really was.  At the top of the cliff she was too shaken to appreciate it, but here was just as good a view with a sunset thrown in!  She joyfully embraced Brandon, looking into his eyes against that beautiful backdrop.  She drank in his scent and swooned at the powerful feelings it evoked inside her.<br />
Brandon held Danielle tightly, feeling her heart race.  After mustering all of his self-control, he spoke.  &quot;We really need to wash up, we're driving each other's hormones crazy.&quot;<br />
Danielle sighed but nodded in agreement.  She didn't want to let go, though.  Brandon realized this and lifted her, carrying her to the pool.  As he stepped in the water, to his surprise it was comfortable - not a hot-tub by any means, but neither the icy chill he had been expecting.  The vixen in his arms still wouldn't let go, so he just sat down while still carrying her.  As she looked up to him with needy eyes, he again felt his willpower tested.<br />
&quot;Sweetie,&quot; Brandon said.<br />
&quot;Mmm?&quot; Danielle replied.<br />
&quot;I made a promise, and I intend to keep it,&quot; Brandon stated.  He wasn't sure whether he was trying to convince Danielle or himself.<br />
At that Brandon began to wash Danielle in the water, massaging all over her body to help work the water through her fur.  She squirmed and made little noises of pleasure, but he focused on washing her and tried to ignore how much he was enjoying having his paws all over her.  She was clearly enjoying herself and before long started to join in, running her own paws over herself and lingering quite a bit on her chest.<br />
Brandon found his mind clearing as he cleaned Danielle.  He was still having fun - quite a bit of fun, in fact - but he was able to think clearly again.  He realized that this was having quite the opposite effect on Danielle.  He had barely cleaned himself and was having quite a bit of physical contact with her, so she was just getting more and more excited.  He gently stopped cleaning Danielle and moved to the opposite end of the pool to focus on cleaning himself before Danielle really lost control.<br />
It took her a few moments to realize Brandon had stopped, but once she did realize it Danielle heaved a heavy sigh.  She wanted more, but he had retreated to the other end of the pool.  She felt almost cheated.  Danielle got up onto all fours and began to prowl over towards Brandon.  While he was washing himself she got her first really detailed look at his anatomy.  He was a bit taller and more muscular than her, and the red of his fur seemed more like clay than the vibrant fire-red of her own.  She watched as he dunked his head in the water, working his way downwards as he cleaned his face and then the bottom of his muzzle.<br />
Her eyes continued to look downwards until they found something quite unexpected at his crotch.  He was quite erect (no doubt from having enjoyed washing Danielle) and was surprisingly well-endowed - Daniel would have felt a bit inadequate.  What really surprised her was that unlike a human's it seemed to taper to a point and looked as though there were some sort of a bulge at the base.  It was pinkish-red and sticking out from a sheathe, with his balls further below.  A few days before she might have been disgusted, but right now it was the sexiest thing she had seen in her life.<br />
She continued on all fours, creeping towards Brandon as he sat in the water and washed his chest.  He wasn't paying very much attention in the rapidly-darkening light, and before long she was right in front of him with her face just inches from his crotch.  The tip poked out from the surface of the water, almost hypnotizing her as it moved slightly in the water.  She gathered her courage and reached out with her long tongue, licking the inch of his member that protruded above the water.<br />
A flood of sensations washed over Danielle's mind.  She had thought Brandon's scent had a lot of power over her, but this made that seem like nothing.  She wanted him.  Bad.  She wanted him inside her and didn't care about what the consequences might be.  She needed it as much as she needed air to breathe.<br />
Brandon was taken by surprise by the contact to such a sensitive part of his body.  Quickly glancing down he saw Danielle on all fours, looking like a predator about to pounce.  &quot;Wow,&quot; he thought, &quot;She looks so hot like that!&quot;  Shaking his head to regain his focus, he reminded himself to keep his promise.  He loved her, and he wasn't about to give in to desire when it was something she might regret later on.<br />
&quot;Danielle, you have to concentrate.  I don't think this is really what you want right now.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes it is!  I need you to take me!  Please!&quot;<br />
Brandon thought to himself.  It would just be a few more minutes until he'd be washed up enough for Danielle to be thinking clearly again.  If he could just keep her from jumping his bones for that long then everything would be all right.<br />
&quot;I'll make a deal,&quot; he said, &quot;You go to the other side of the pool and wait for five minutes, and then we'll do anything you want.&quot;<br />
&quot;That's too long!  I need you now!&quot; Danielle said with more than a little bit of mania.<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Brandon said, &quot;How about this.  You help me wash myself for five minutes, and then anything you want.&quot;<br />
Danielle quickly agreed.  She leaned forward and began to open her mouth, but Brandon caught her with a paw.<br />
&quot;Help me wash myself with your paws,&quot; Brandon said, &quot;Not with that.  And that part of me gets washed last.&quot;<br />
She whimpered in disappointment, but once she saw in his eyes that he meant it she obeyed.  She sneakily kept trying to work her paws down to her goal, but Brandon was watching carefully and each time guided her back to less-intimate regions.  By the time that was all that remained, she regained control from her hormones and began to sob.<br />
&quot;Oh Brandon,&quot; she cried, &quot;Thank you.  I would have never been able to resist something like that!  That's not how I would have wanted it to happen, and without you to save me from myself I would have regretted it.  I love you...so much...&quot;<br />
Brandon embraced Danielle as she trailed off into sobs, gently stroking her head.  &quot;I love you, sweetie.  You know I'd never do anything unless it felt right for both of us, and that just wasn't the right circumstances for us.  Now we're both ourselves again so there's nothing to worry about.  It's all right, we're back to normal.&quot;<br />
Brandon felt perfectly natural calling these forms normal.  As far as he was concerned, this was what they were now and there was no use denying it.  As long as they were careful not to let their scents set their hormones wild they were still themselves.<br />
Danielle finally stopped crying, but remained in Brandon's arms.  She felt so safe like that, and knowing Brandon would always look out for her even in the most tempting of circumstances made her feel even better.  She looked deeply into his eyes and smiled.</p>
