<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was Friday morning; the sun just rising form the horizon; yet obscured by rain clouds. While the brunt of the storm Has passed, a lite drizzle still remains. the main power restored; the town now no longer suffering from a blackout. Frieda Knight a fourteen year old were-panther was looking out the large room height window in her bedroom. While in nothing but a nightgown; Frieda felt no shame in anyone seeing her as she looked out on to her families rolling green lawns. Since her nearest neighbor lived five miles from her family’s house, she could look out the window naked if she so chose; yet even she had limits. Despite the servants walking out on her parents after Frieda’s father assault on Jeffery; Frieda still had a modicum of modesty when not in her fursona. Walking to her private bathroom; Frieda begins her day with a quick shower and a fresh change of clothes.<br />
<br />
Minutes later Frieda is heading to the kitchen. Clearly hungry despite the sandwich she made for herself last night. She sets her mind to get some cereal, only to be surprised to see her father Benton Knight already in the kitchen looking at the coffee machine lost in thought. While Frieda usually sees her father in an impeccably tailored suit; this time he is wearing nothing but a pair of jeans and a simple t-shirt.<br />
“Something wrong dad?” Frieda speaks as she hopes on the bar stool.<br />
“Coffee sucks,” Benton remarks.<br />
‘Have you tried changing the filter and adding fresh grounds?” Frieda answers.<br />
Benton thinks for a minute before answering; “How do you do that?”<br />
Frieda just rolls her eyes as she gets down off the stool. When the servants where still around she witnessed many times the cook and various maids perform the task of brewing a fresh pot of coffee. Removing the hopper and putting its contents in the garbage bin; Frieda grabs a fresh filter from the drawer and puts several scoops of coffee grounds afterwards. She adds fresh water to the machine and then pressed a button.<br />
“Now give it a minute or two,” Frieda comments as she gets herself a bowl of cereal.<br />
“You knew how to do that?” Benton looking shocked.<br />
“Don’t you?” Frieda answers back as she eats her breakfast. “I bet you can’t even make toast.&quot;<br />
“I can too!” Benton responds, “I just haven’t done it in years.” Looking around; “speaking of toast, where is the toaster?”<br />
Frieda just laughs as she watches her father try to find the device in question. “It’s next to the coffee machine.”<br />
Benton turns around just as the coffee is finished percolating. “Ah how convenient.” He pours himself a fresh brew and takes a sip. “Ahhhhhhhh, much better.” Looking at Frieda, “How often do you have to change that filter thingy?”<br />
“Every time you want to brew a fresh pot dad,” She answers finishing her bowl of cereal. “Bread is in the cupboard next to the fridge, along with the butter.”<br />
<br />
Benton puts bread in the toaster and presses down on the plunger. Grinning at Frieda that he could at least do that, Frieda just shakes her head slightly bemused. It was at this moment that Amanda entered the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“There you are Frieda;” Amanda approaching her to hand her daughter her were-birth control pill.<br />
“Don’t you think I’m old enough to not need having you spoon feed me pills?” Frieda states as she swallows the offered pill. &quot;I can take these without you hovering over me.&quot;<br />
“Frieda, I only want to make sure you don’t do something foolish, like get pregnant;” Amanda responds lovingly.<br />
“I’m not a fool,” Frieda responds. “Not unlike dad who is about to burn toast.”<br />
“Hey!” Benton speaks up but stops as he smells something burning. Turning around he sees the toaster smoking. Getting the toast to pop up he puts two black slices on a plate and butters them. Eating them he immediately washes the nasty taste with a sip of coffee.<br />
<br />
Frieda just laughs at her father’s determined effort to eat two slices of bread that quickly became charcoal. Amanda also joins in as Benton starts accepting the truth and tosses the burnt toast into the trash bin.<br />
“Does anyone know if the diner delivers breakfast?” Benton asks.<br />
Frieda and Amanda laugh even more causing Benton to chuckle as well.<br />
<br />
As the family moment passes, Amanda begins to get serious. She takes the scroll that Tachibana handed Benton last night and places it in front of Frieda. Instructing Frieda to read it, both parents witness her eyes go big with surprise as to its contents.<br />
“Is this true?” Frieda looks at her father.<br />
“The were-council is not known for practical jokes, Frieda;” Benton looking serious. “Since up until yesterday, I was a member.&quot; Taking the scroll from Frieda; “Now because of what I did yesterday, I have been kicked out. You are to take my place when you turn twenty one.”<br />
“I thought the age of majority was eighteen?” Frieda asks<br />
“It is in some states. But on the federal level, age of majority is twenty one. That is when you are legally allowed to drink and vote.” <br />
<br />
“Anger management classes?” Frieda comments.<br />
“You know I am loathed to being told what to do. But after yesterday; Hitting Jeffery, destroying have the house;” Benton pauses “What if I have another blow up and I inadvertently hit you, your mother or a complete stranger?” Benton continues, “while I’m not sure if Jeffery is going to press charges or not. The fact that Sheriff Copper or his deputies are not here to arrest me; could imply that Jeffery would rather forget to whole affair.”<br />
“So you’re admitting you have anger issues,” Frieda states.<br />
“I guess so,” Answers Benton; “As a businessman I can’t let anger take over when a deal falls through or a plan comes to naught. But if the were-council tries to get me to see Frances Twist, then they are in for a fight.” <br />
“Why do you despise Frances?” Amanda chimes in. I’ve talked to her at social functions a few times. She seems knowledgeable in her field.”<br />
“It’s her lifestyle choice that I can’t accept,” Benton responds. “It’s unnatural.”<br />
“Being a lesbian is unnatural?” Frieda asks. “What about Bi-sexual? Do you find my lifestyle choice abhorrent? Are you one of the religious bigots that believe if you are not heterosexual, you’re a going to hell?”<br />
<br />
Benton doesn’t answer. Knowing that this will spark an argument that will just make everyone upset. Instead he looks at the scroll; “I’m surprise you haven’t jumped for joy on the third edict;” looking at Frieda. “I’m barred from sending you away. You got your wish, you staying in Moon Lake.”<br />
“But I’m still grounded;” Frieda glares, “you and mom won’t let me be with ‘my’ friends.”<br />
“I’ve been thinking about that,” Amanda chimes in again. “If your dad can admit he has anger issues, then perhaps I can admit that punishing you was wrong.” Frieda is about to speak up when Amanda silences her; “While I still do not approve of what you did Tuesday, in this house. I cannot deny that your mood and disposition have changed upon meeting Eric Anderson and Spencer Lawson. The fact that you are passionate in their well-being speaks volumes. So consider your grounding lifted. But you do have a curfew; you will be home no later than nine in the evening on school nights. Weekends we can discuss. But if you bring your friends here, no sex. There are limits that your father and I will impose.”<br />
<br />
Frieda was ecstatic; she leaps off the stool to hug her mother. “Can I stay over at Spencer’s or Eric’s place?”<br />
“One step at a time Frieda,” Benton answers. Now hurry up so we can drive you to school.&quot;<br />
&quot;You forgot the restitution to Tachibana, Benton;&quot; Amanda speaks up after pouring herself a cup of coffee. Sipping it she looks at Benton if he brewed it.<br />
&quot;Frieda showed me how,&quot; Benton responds. &quot;And as for the restitution to Tachibana, that part I recall didn&#39;t apply to her.&quot; Sipping on his coffee; &quot;That bit is on me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Benton thinks to himself as he finished his coffee; &#39;perhaps Daisuke should of taken my head yesterday. Then all this would be moot.&#39; Knowing that Tachibana has effectively guaranteed a war if he went after the Lawson&#39;s or the Anderson&#39;s; Benton smiles as he grabs his car keys; &quot;You never said anything about your grandson, old lady. And I will drive you into the dirt Daisuke. Even if it kills me, I will have my vengeance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frieda skips back to her room to collect her school bag and phone. She blasts a message to Eric and Spencer telling them the good news and can’t wait to tell them more when they meet up at the school entrance.</p>
