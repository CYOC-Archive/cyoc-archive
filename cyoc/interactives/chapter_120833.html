<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Derrick woke up slowly, his mind a hazy blur. Where was he? Thinking was hard for him. He was aware of a wetness around his crotch and torso, but he didn&#39;t know what it was. He rubbed his eyes and blinked a few times. Derrick looked down and saw that the events yesterday were not a dream! He gasped at what he saw.<br />
<br />
He saw his body was much more muscular, and absolutely filthy. His 10 inch uncut soft cock was now pounding erect at 14 inches. He saw that the wetness was from what had to be a half dozen loads he shot all over the sheets and himself last night. The cum was sticky and it was everywhere! Even with all the loads he shot, his bigger balls felt full to the point of bursting. He was so horny he couldn&#39;t think straight. What had he accepted from the fauns?! This was too much.<br />
<br />
Derrick grabbed his throbbing cock and stroked it. He orgasmed within seconds, grunting as he shot his semen all over himself and the already soaked bed. As he grunted, Derrick was surprised to find his voice was much deeper than the day before.<br />
<br />
With his huge uncircumcised hose softening up and his mind clearing a bit, he examined his body. It was very dirty, covered is dirt and grime. It looked like he had never showered before in his life. He also noticed he stunk, too. He lifted up an arm to smell and he was shocked. A huge brown bush of hair stuck out of his armpit! &quot;What?!&quot;, Derrick mumbled in his deeper voice. He lifted up his other arm. He indeed had bushes of hair under his arm. He pulled the hair experimentally, feeling pain as a yanked a couple out. Yup, They were definitely his.<br />
<br />
Derrick was so shocked because he hadn&#39;t ever had armpit hair before. He couldn&#39;t grow any yet. Even just yesterday he had none. Those fauns must have done something!<br />
<br />
While examining his pits, Derrick noticed a very strong BO coming from them. His old self would have been embarrassed, but his new self found this to be something to be proud of. Almost erotic. He felt a twinge in his huge cock. Looking down at his huge set, he saw that he now had a huge tangled bush of pubes where he only had peach fuzz the day before. His balls, the size of small oranges now, we&#39;re covered in thick hairs, too. The thick pubes tapered into a thick trail running all around his belly button, and climbing up his chest to meet a bush of chest hairs in the center.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have chest hair now?&quot;, he mumbled to himself, tugging and twirling his new chest hairs. There was a whole bunch in the center and quite a few long ones around his nipples.<br />
<br />
Feeling his face, he felt the unfamiliar feeling of raspy stubble. He also felt a huge Adams apple on his neck. Much to Derrick&#39; s surprise, he also felt his forehead sticking out a bit. A large bony protrusion sticking out, giving him a large brow. What had the fauns done to him! He was so hairy and hung now!<br />
<br />
While exploring his new body, Derrick realized he was fully erect again. He felt hormones swimming around in his head; he was so horny again, even though he had just cum minutes ago. He gripped his shaft again, noticing his dirty callused hands were covered in brown hair, as were his powerful forearms. He began to pump his shaft, noticing his powerful biceps bulging out.<br />
<br />
As Derrick jacked his huge cock, unable to stop, he began to wonder what was happening to him. What had the fauns changed him into? An overshadowed, unbelievably horny, hair teen? Or something else?<br />
<br />
Derrick blew his load again, getting the sticky cum in his chest hair and on his torso. He lay there, sweaty, dirty, and stinking.<br />
<br />
Now that he wasn&#39;t as horny, Derrick needed to figure out what to do. Why was he so hairy and dirty? Why was it so difficult to think? He looked down. Did his cock look bigger? Does his chest have more hair?! Why did he have a huge brow on his forehead? Derrick lifted an arm and scratched his hairy armpit absentmindedly, the smell comforting him.<br />
<br />
He had to act now. Before these changes get worse or he had to stop to jack off again. Already he was feeling horny again. Derrick got up. He had to go see the fauns.</p>
