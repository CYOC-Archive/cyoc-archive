<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Alpha Phi Omega Fraternity at a certain college was about to have one of the most intense ragers of the year. One of the biggest &quot;jock&quot; frats at the college, they were known for such things. Spring break was almost here, and they wanted to lead into the debauchery of the break with a big party at the fraternity house. They had no idea exactly how debauched things would get though, thanks to the intervention of one Owen Ayers. A rejected member of the fraternity, he had nevertheless come calling when the fraternity needed some more party punch for the &quot;party of the century&quot; the following day.<br />
<br />
Owen for his part was still bitter about how for all the preparations he&#39;d made, he was still rejected for the fraternity. He&#39;d prepared for months, gone on an intensive steroid regimen that completely reshaped his nerdy, thin body shape. Now as he walked into the grounds of the fraternity house he was only in due to a delivery, he was powerfully muscled - but apparently, still too dorky to be a &quot;true&quot; member of the frat. The dark haired nerd carried with him a case of drinks for the rager, easily hoisting the heavy container.<br />
<br />
<i>Well, if I can&#39;t have the hot party experience one way, I figure I&#39;ll have it another way.</i><br />
<br />
He&#39;d heard of those pills. The ones that either got some bodybuilders up to the next level or turned them into hot chicks or something. He didn&#39;t remember the exact rules. Owen had himself not messed with the stuff. He was more than happy with the results he got from a simple routine of dianabol, anavar, trenbolone and testosterone.<br />
<br />
Only that the things had an interesting relationship with the orgasm. And he knew the stories about this frat well enough to know that these guys did not know the meaning of the word restraint. They&#39;d be fucking all over the guest rooms, the hall, the den and possibly even the backyard. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Owen, right?&quot; He turned his head to look at the guy speaking as the man walked in.<br />
<br />
It was Scott Camden, one of the older athletes here and thus, generally a leader among the guys. He was a blond haired, blue eyed athlete with a passion for both wrestling and bodybuilding - and he achieved naturally something just a bit better than what Owen needed steroids to achieve . &quot;You really came through for us, even though we didn&#39;t get you in, bro. Thanks for the drinks.&quot; Scott took the drinks and set them on a nearby table, &quot;You&#39;re more than welcome to hit up the party, if not stay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, that settled that minor issue, Owen thought to himself. He then crossed his arms and feigned hurt, &quot;Well, I was just really hoping to get into a cool frat like this. Never really got the chance to party back in high school, before I...well, bulked up as much as I have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you&#39;re a solid dude...&quot; Scott scratched the back of his head and sighed, &quot;It&#39;s just you have a certain vibe. It&#39;s perceptible to guys like us. We gotta do consistent vibe checks, you get me? We can&#39;t be having anything messing up how our frat comes off to the babes, eh? Eh? You get me. I mean, there&#39;s plenty frats where you&#39;d be the biggest, strongest guy in the whole thing. Nothing personal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hearing it for himself made sure that Owen felt as good as he did about dosing these guys with his mix of party punch and the pills. He had to suppress a smirk as he answered, &quot;Yeah, yeah you&#39;re right. Sometimes you just gotta deal with the hand you&#39;re given and make the best of your circumstances.&quot; <i>And not in the way you&#39;re probably expecting, you insipid ignoramus.</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Knew you were a solid bro. Hope you enjoy your time at our party. And hey, maybe we&#39;ll keep you in mind to help us out in the future. Best thing, right?&quot; Of course Scott saw nothing wrong with just seeing Owen as nothing but repeatable, disposable help for any future parties. Of course, Owen had heard the stories about good old Scott.<br />
<br />
For all that he portrayed himself as the man&#39;s man, there were rumors that Scott&#39;s preferences weren&#39;t contained to the bevy of women who graced his bed. According to the gossip going around, Scott was closeted - he liked his men every bit as much as he liked his women, but it wouldn&#39;t <i>do</i> for a wealthy scion to be so openly queer. So there&#39;d be at least twice as much chance for Scotty here to end up a hot babe by the end of the day.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah you&#39;re right. I&#39;m glad to help you guys out.&quot; Owen said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you keep going on working out, bro...&quot; Scott glanced Owen over in a subdued, rather appreciative manner, &quot;You&#39;re looking pretty good for a nerd. Very nice pecs.&quot; A quick clap on the shoulder, and Owen headed out - not interested in contributing to any homoerotic tension with Scott.<br />
<br />
Once the former nerd got home, he quickly undressed and sat at his computer, immediately looking up images of people who had ended up transformed by the drug that he&#39;d supplied the unknowing frat with. So...basically, either the biggest bunch of jocks on campus got even jockier should they by some miraculous alchemy not cum the entire time they were at the party, or they would become fit, vivacious babes that would likely be all over Owen&#39;s dick.<br />
<br />
Just the thought of so many women located in one place got him glancing at a bulge in his pants. Fuck...! Sure, he&#39;d experienced some of the classic side effects from so much steroid use. His balls had seen better days, but his dick if anything was bigger. A quick pinch of his right nipple - more pronounced since the use - and Owen let out a quick little aroused huff. &quot;Well I&#39;m not sleeping tonight till I take care of this. Let&#39;s just...also take care of my weekly dosages.&quot;<br />
<br />
He took his pills, and as usual when he injected the test and trenbolone his dick throbbed. &quot;Man, tren and test make me fucking pulse...&quot; Gripping his dick in his hand, Owen promptly spent the next three hours jerking off, all the way until he fell asleep that night mid-pump of his hips.<br />
<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
The next day, Owen made sure to get his workout done early and his shower not long after, eagerly anticipating the start of the party at 5:00 PM. It was the weekend, nobody&#39;d be at school but everybody would be at the party that evening. He had Scott&#39;s word that he would be in, and he couldn&#39;t wait to see how the buff, muscled jocks of the frat all ended up lusty ladies who&#39;d probably end the day gagging on his rod. He just had to make sure he didn&#39;t take his own supply, as it were, and leave the drinking of the spiked punch to the jocks.<br />
<br />
By the time the party was due to begin, Owen swaggered into the sprawling fraternity house yet again with the confidence of a man who knew that his retribution was close at hand. Dressed in a black polo shirt, jeans, and with his usual black framed glasses, Owen walked by the doorman Kyle Hartley. A close friend of Scott&#39;s, Kyle was a big, stocky guy - just about everything on that ginger haired athlete&#39;s body was taut, toned and strong, except his gut. Yet it seemed Kyle being plus sized didn&#39;t hinder him whatsoever in the girlfriends department.<br />
<br />
And already, once Owen walked in, he could see Kyle drinking some party punch while manning the door. <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to the best night of your life, Owen Ayers.&quot; Kyle gestured at him with a hand still holding a cup full of punch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed, Kyle. Indeed.&quot; Owen kept walking, a smile crossing his face.<br />
<br />
He could see some others loitering about, already getting hot and heavy with the sorority babes. He could see the swimming star Jake Sakaki, a muscular but largely more toned Eurasian with dyed short blond hair, light brown eyes, and a tanned appearance. Apparently his dad was some rich Japanese businessman. He was on a couch making out with one of the girls, a redhead, who teased him, &quot;Ohh Jakey, are you this turned on already?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m the fucking Asian Adonis.&quot; And then they went right back to humping around on the couch. Still clothed, but worked up. And Jake had a half full cup of party punch right by the couch they were making out on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey man, welcome to the party!&quot; And there was Scott himself, a lady on each arm, shirtless and with his pants unbuttoned. It was clear he was looking for the perfect opportunity to run off and bang his two lady-friends. The bulge in his pants didn&#39;t lie. &quot;Thanks again for the punch. Everybody says it tastes amazing! And they don&#39;t lie. I&#39;ve had a cup already and hoo-boy, it gets the engines running.&quot;<br />
<br />
Owen just awkwardly nodded, noting again that Scott was looking him over just as perversely as he looked over his two girlfriends. &quot;Yeah, looks like you&#39;re gonna have fun...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t miss out, bro,&quot; Scott started heading toward the stairs leading to the upper level, full of rooms likely full of other jocks enjoying a sensual romp. <br />
<br />
Owen spied the football team&#39;s slim, boyish runningback Lucas Dimatta in one of the rooms with his pants and shirt already off. It seemed he was already getting wild and frisky, even when other people could just walk by. He had thick, fluffy light brown hair, blue eyes, and was a bit more thin than most guys here, though he was so good at his position he didn&#39;t get much shit for it. And he - despite his boyish (some might say downright twinky) appearance - was aggressively, overbearingly macho to make up for it.<br />
<br />
Owen leaned in, hearing the runningback enjoying a remarkably sensual &quot;massage&quot; by one of the girls. Really, it was more just him getting his muscles and body touched all over. &quot;Yeah...fuck yeah babe you feel me up. Can&#39;t wait to stick my cock in there...&quot; And he didn&#39;t even notice Owen looking in on the events going on.<br />
<br />
One thing that was pretty good about the pills was how intense they worked. It didn&#39;t take long for the people so affected, once things got rolling, to just fixate on sex. Even when they were slowly feminizing. Every orgasm would push the guys here one step closer to total femininity - and it was just kind enough of the pills mixed with the drinks to bequeath enhanced stamina, too. No issue of the mind being willing but the body being weak...<br />
<br />
It was just a matter of time...</p>
