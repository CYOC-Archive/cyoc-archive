<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>My 50th chapter on this site, wohoo!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Audrey and Laura continued geeking out about their new combined body, Jen quickly adapted to moving around with it. Strangely enough it was much easier than the triple-torso-ed tripod. It didn&#39;t take long for all three to arrive at the same conclusion. <br />
<br />
“This body is awesome!” Audrey exclaimed.<br />
<br />
“Can we keep it?” Laura asked.<br />
<br />
“I agree this body feels great, especially… ah… down there,” Jen said. “But what about the other cheerleaders?”<br />
<br />
“I can faintly hear the five in our mind-link,” Laura, their resident expert on shared minds, spoke up. “They are in a constant state of mind-blowing, hehe, pleasure and none of them want it to end.”<br />
<br />
Now that she mentioned it, both Audrey and Jen could also hear it when they focused on it. Non-stop moaning of five girls interspersed with the occasional (mental) cry of “More, more!”, “I love this!” or “Please don&#39;t stop this!”. At that even Jen found it hard to resist fulfilling their wish. “Looks like I’m outvoted. Alright, let&#39;s take a pill and make it permanent.”<br />
<br />
Jen had already coughed up a pill into her hand, when Laura stopped. “Wait, there are some other improvements I’d like to make to this body, when we already have this chance.” She mentally sent Jen and Audrey a list of all the additions she&#39;d like to make. <br />
<br />
“Wow, that&#39;s quite a lot,” Audrey commented. “This might be a bit too much for one pill… especially because there are one or two things I’d like to add as well.”<br />
<br />
“Then how about this,” Jen offered. “We each take a pill and each of us adds whatever she wants and thinks might be useful.”<br />
<br />
Both quickly agreed to her proposal and coughed pills into their hands. At the count of 3 they swallowed them and started to eagerly await the telltale tingling that would signal their changes. <br />
<br />
The first change was the vaginal openings on the back of the heads of Annie, Becca, Cindy and Deborah closing up, sealing around Eliza’s tentacles. Similarly the holes the legs of Jen, Audrey and Laura were inside of closed around those and quickly any hint their legs were once separate from that body disappeared. The eight girls were now connected permanently.<br />
<br />
Jen was really proud of the idea behind their next change. A glossy sheen started to spread across the massive body leaving everything shiny and removing any non-head hair. The exception were the hairs on their crotches, which were instead sealed into their new skin to become something akin to tattoos. Above Jen&#39;s pussy was now a red triangle, while Laura’s now featured yellow stripes, making them look like sun rays with her vagina as the sun. Jen couldn&#39;t wait and started rubbing her hands against her breasts, producing the satisfying sound of rubber on rubber, as each of the three’s chests increased by one cup size. The logic behind the rubber skin was that it would protect their body from any outside influences or damage as finding fitting clothes would be getting harder and harder with each transformation. Additionally she wished it so that their body and each clone could walk around naked without issues. The breast growth was just a nice bonus.<br />
<br />
Up next the three girls felt a tingling around their heads. They felt something push out of their skulls and their hearing improved as they each got an additional pair of animal ears on their heads, though with the rubber coating they looked more like from pool toys. Jen got red fox ears, Audrey gained black bunny ears and Laura received blotched cow ears. There was some more tingling located in their mouths and throughout the bodies of the other girls that were a part of their body now, but none ended in changes that were visible from the outside.<br />
<br />
While admiring their improved body Laura was the first to speak up again. “Rubber skin and animal ears, didn&#39;t know you two were so kinky,” she teased her bodymates.<br />
<br />
“So what? I’m surprised you haven&#39;t given us udders yet,” Jen replied.<br />
<br />
“I just find them cute…” Audrey mumbled. “I would&#39;ve added tails, too, but there isn&#39;t enough room.”<br />
<br />
Laura frantically waved her (technically Jen’s) arm. “Hey, hey, don&#39;t worry, no kinkshaming, I love it, too. Anyways, I used my pill to turn this giant body into the ultimate transformation factory! Just put in one or more people and we can turn them into whatever we want. Or just something random, if we&#39;re in the mood for it. It&#39;s a bit complicated, so I’d rather just demonstrate it to you when we get the chance.”<br />
<br />
“Looking forward to it,” Audrey commented. “I did something similar to make using the pills easier. You know how people can shoot out their saliva like out of a water pistol? We can do the same now with the pills and they can dissolve through the skin to make turning people easier. Just some quality of life improvements.”<br />
<br />
Just then another girl entered the gym. “Sorry, I’m late, art class took a bit longer,” said Fiona. She didn&#39;t even bat an eye at the giant consisting of eight merged girls.<br />
<br />
<i>Looks like we got someone for a demonstration, Laura,</i> Jen thought to her friends. “Hey, Fiona, could you come here for a moment? We need your help for something,” she shouted to the late cheerleader. <br />
<br />
Fiona approached the giant cheer-mecha. Meanwhile, Laura started her instructions on how to use their body. “First, you have to gather the materials.” She positioned the Annie-arm right above Fiona and moved it down to fully stuff the other girl into Annie’s gaping pussy. Annie’s stomach bulged out until it looked like she was 9 months pregnant and if you got very close you could hear some faint moaning from inside it. “This is where our materials are stored until we start the transformation. Each limb should be able to store multiple people. Of course it&#39;s possible to release someone again unchanged. Also, keep in mind if we use multiple people they will end up merged in some way.<br />
<br />
“Up next is the actual transformation, during which the materials stored in the limbs will be pumped into the main body, where they&#39;ll be changed. And to start that, we have to pump.” Laura started using what were the original legs of their tripod body to move the trio up and down the quite literal stick up their ass that was protruding from the Eliza-torso. While the three continued their anal masturbation, the bulge that was Fiona started mving up through Annie&#39;s body and through the connecting tentacle into the Eliza-torso. While the big torso’s stomach started rumbling the moaning of Jen, Audrey, Laura and Fiona started increasing in volume and frequency.<br />
<br />
“How long hn… Laura,” Jen managed to get out.<br />
<br />
“Till we ah… cum, obviously.” With that Laura not only increased the pace of their pumping, she additionally started moving her tongue in Audrey&#39;s pussy. Soon they came, giving each other a taste of their fluids. At the same time the big vagina of Eliza opened up and something came out and flopped to the ground. <br />
<br />
While still recovering, the cheer-mecha took a few steps back to admire Fiona’s changed body. The first they saw was her now bigger head with anime-like facial features, huge eyes, big mouth and small nose. All-in-all it gave the head a chibi-like look. Her boobs, hips and ass were comically exaggerated and her hourglass-figure could put actual hourglasses to shame, you could easily reach around it with one hand. Her throat and limbs had the same diameter with the latter being more like long stalks, the likes of which you could see on old cartoon characters. Her hands and feet had been replaced by big boob-like orbs. The hands each had five finger-like teats coming out with each lactating a fluid in a different color.<br />
<br />
Laura happened to be the first one to regain her bearings. “Thanks for helping us, Fiona.”<br />
<br />
“No problem, girls, I’m always willing to help out the team. If you don&#39;t mind, I’ll be doing some warm-up stretches now,” Fiona casually replied as if she hadn&#39;t just been reborn as a weird sex creature and wasn&#39;t still dripping with their vaginal fluids. As the other girls watched her stretching, they noticed Fiona bending her thin limbs as if they didn&#39;t have any bones. She pretty much became a real-life cartoon figure.<br />
<br />
“So, how do you like the transformation factory?” Laura asked.<br />
<br />
“It was great,” Jen answered. “You truly are a mad genius.”<br />
<br />
“It felt so good doing it, I already want to transform more people,” Audrey said. “I fear I might get addicted.”<br />
<br />
“And what of it?” Jen spoke up. “The whole world is open to us. We can transform anyone we want. No one can stop us, girls. So let me ask, who do we want transform next?”</p>
