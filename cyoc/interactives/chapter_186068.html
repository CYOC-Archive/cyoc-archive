<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I wish I had your power!&quot;<br />
<br />
At first, as Anna was reluctantly compelled to snap her fingers and grant the wish, she was grimacing, terrified at what kind of horrible things Raize could do with demon powers. But after a moment... the anxiety vanished, as she realized something. She instinctually knew that, yes, it was entirely possible and even allowable for a genie to grant their master or mistress all of their supreme mystical power to bend and alter the fabric of reality and the cosmos. There was just one small caveat: if they wanted a genie&#39;s power... they had to take a genie&#39;s form.<br />
<br />
Disappointing though it might have been, the bimbo was relieved as the magical power vanished from her veins, her breasts shrinking down to their still-impressive mortal size as she was forcefully shoved away from the pink smoke, careening to the ground as a normal, unmagical human once more. Raize watched with interest as the smoke then drifted to her, diffiusing over her demonic lower half and absorbing it; her eyes gained a pink glow as she laughed wickedly. &quot;Oh my god... so much power!&quot; She held out a hand to try and exert some sort of magical influence - only to find out that she couldn&#39;t just go altering the world willy-nilly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like, thanks for freeing me, you mean old bitch!&quot; Anna taunted the now-enraged demon-bimbo-genie as she grabbed the lamp, rubbing her hand over it furiously. Raize growled, reaching out wanting to strangle her, but her claws turned to smoke. Anna had just become her mistress, and thus, couldn&#39;t be harmed, no matter how badly the former huntress wished it; her new owner seemed aware of this, grinning as she took a step back from the genie. This demon stuff had gotten way out of hand, and she was gonna fix it, and totally be a hero. And she was gonna make Raize do it for her too.<br />
<br />
Because even though she was a ditz - she was a ditz who still remembered all the genie stuff that had been dumped in her head when she was in the lamp. She knew how to get around any wordplay trickery, and she didn&#39;t even have to worry about her head being screwed with - Raize could only serve bimbos, but she was already the most natural bimbo in the world.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, first, I like, wish that Terri and Aubrey and Adie were all normal, human, not at all demony werebimbos, just like the other Terri and Niamh!&quot; Raize growled again, infuriated by the thought of sapping the demonic taint from the women around her - but she had no choice. The ex-huntress snapped her fingers, and instantly, the trio&#39;s skin shifted back to a normal sunbathed tan complexion, the succubus features vanishing and hair becoming golden blonde - though they all kept their ginormous racks and butts. Terri and Aubrey still had milk leaking out of their nipples, but Anna knew the smell of normal human milk well enough to realize it wasn&#39;t dangerous.<br />
<br />
&quot;What else, my mistress?&quot; Raize seethed at her.<br />
<br />
Anna already had something in mind, something that was kinda nerd shit, but she&#39;d make it hot and sexy and not nerd shit. &quot;Next, I wish I was a superhero like Athena from those movies, but don&#39;t make me tall or all musculey or make me look different! I just wanna have her powers, and like, still be me! And I want my lightning to be pink!&quot; She didn&#39;t read stupid comic books, those were dumb things for dumb boys, but she&#39;d been dragged to those movies a lot by dates, and she always thought Athena would be super cool if she wasn&#39;t so butch and ugly. Again, Raize clearly hated it, but she had no choice, obliging Anna with another snap of her fingers.<br />
<br />
The other three bimbos in the room, quickly joined by a very confused-looking Future Terri and Niamh come to investigate all the sexy sounds, watched in amazement as Anna floated up off the ground. Her hands crackled with pink electricity as she felt a surge of power ripple through her - the ability to fly, near-invulnerability, superhuman strength, and powerful blasts of thunder were all at her command now, and all while still being as hot as ever. Anna wasn&#39;t just a bimbo now - she was [i]Superbimbo.[/i] A bona fide heroine, considering she had totally just saved Past Terri and Aubrey and Adie from horrible demon fates.<br />
<br />
&quot;And for your last wi-&quot;<br />
<br />
The aggravated demon genie didn&#39;t get a chance to finish her sentence before Anna slammed the lid back onto the lamp, forcing the monster back inside. &quot;Like, hell no!&quot; As long as the last wish was left ungranted, Raize remained severely restricted in her ability to affect the world - and Anna wasn&#39;t dumb enough to change that. The reasoning behind wanting superpowers rapidly became apparent as she grabbed some tape, binding the lid shut with it, floated over to the balcony, and hurled the lamp out towards the ocean with all the force her superhuman strength could muster. It sailed through the air, far, far out, beyond what even her enhanced vision could see, sure to plunk into the ocean and sink to where nobody would ever find it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t mess with Superbimbo!&quot; She shouted with a victorious fist pump. This was totally awesome! She laughed with glee as she floated back into the room, finding that, much to her annoyance, the girls had all gotten so confused that their arousal had worn off, turning them back into their normal selves. Which was at least still slutter for Niamh and Future Terri and Adie. And Aubrey was still kind of hot in a natural way. And Past Terri was even sorta cute even if she was a total bookworm. <br />
<br />
Speaking of - both Terri&#39;s raised their fingers and spoke the same thing at the same time. &quot;I have several questions.&quot; They both shot each other looks after the unison statement, blushing at seeing each other naked and holding hands with redheads. God, Terri was just fucking drawn to redheads like nothing else in the world, wasn&#39;t she?<br />
<br />
&quot;Raize got turned into like, a really really mean and nasty demon thing,&quot; Anna explained as she floated in a circle around them, clearly adoring her new power of flight. &quot;But like, she was dumb and swapped places with me, so I wished for you to be regular werebimbos and for me to be the hottest superhero ever! And then I tossed Raize&#39;s lamp out where nobody can ever ever ever find it!&quot; She grinned. &quot;Like, you&#39;re welcome!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Werewhohowwatsnow?&quot; Aubrey asked nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ye did <i>what</i> with Raize?&quot; Adie chimed in as she stood up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did ye have to make me so sensitive?!&quot; Niamh was next, moaning softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you... please... please never do anything like that again?&quot; Past Terri said, anxiously recalling her brief docile state.<br />
<br />
&quot;How the hell did you even know who Athena is?&quot; Future Terri was last to contribute, the confidence in her slut form allowing her to strike a balance between having a spine and remaining a brilliant nerd.<br />
<br />
Anna responded to all of the inquiries with a roll of her eyes. &quot;Gawwwwwwwwwwwd, why do you have to ask so many questions?! You&#39;re like, standing her with an ultra sexy superhero, and you&#39;re gonna be able to be hot whenever you want now, and you can still be boing and normal when you really want to!&quot; She threw her arms out. &quot;You totally can&#39;t tell me that&#39;s not, like, the best of every world! So just shut up with the questions, cause I&#39;m <i>soooooo</i> horny right now!&quot; She floated back over to the balcony, out to hang above the crowd and shout down to them. &quot;HEY! WHO WANTS TO, LIKE, HAVE AN ORGY WITH A SUPERHERO!&quot;</p>
