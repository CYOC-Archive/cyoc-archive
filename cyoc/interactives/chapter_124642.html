<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
Jeremy stood in the doorway, afraid to enter the room and hoping he was in the wrong place.  But a cheerful voice jovially welcomed him in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome! Come in, Jeremy, &quot; said Dr. Jones, motioning for him to enter. &quot;I am so glad you could make it.  We were just about to start.  Have a seat anywhere.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy slowly trudged into the room, dragging his feet the whole way. He simultaneously tried to duck his head and hide his face while looking for an empty seat at the same time, preferably somewhere in the back.  Sure enough there were a number of empty seats surrounding a familiar face - Heather. She was seated at the back of the room, all alone.  It was not surprising.  Heather was still not very popular and Jeremy thought quite a few people were probably still not comfortable being around her.  <br />
<br />
But Jeremy didn&#39;t mind. He was used to her by now and had gotten to know the girl hiding behind the gruff exterior. Although she put up a tough front, no doubt the result of her hard life, Jeremy knew that it was just a cover for Heather&#39;s very sensitive interior. She was an artist, after all.  Well, she used to be when he knew her in college and Jeremy didn&#39;t think she had changed that much since their school days.  Jeremy plopped down on a seat beside her.<br />
<br />
The chairs were oversized, designed to accommodate large Animalians like Heather.  Jeremy knew that most humans would have been disturbed to be looking up at the dinosaur sitting beside them.  But after working with Heather for a long time, the size difference really didn&#39;t bother him anymore.<br />
<br />
Heather smiled down at him weakly.  It was obvious she was nervous and more than a little uncomfortable.  And equally grateful for Jeremy&#39;s attendance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for coming,&quot; whispered Heather.  &quot;I know you didn&#39;t have to be here and I really appreciate it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem, &quot; whispered Jeremy.  &quot;Happy to help. Although I think I need this as much as you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?!&quot; asked Heather a little louder than she intended.<br />
<br />
Dr. Jones stopped talking and gave them a stern look.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you two are new to the group, but that doesn&#39;t excuse you from the rules.  Please refrain from any cross-talk.  It can be very disruptive and slows down the session. If you have something to say, please share it with the group.  Otherwise, it can wait for the break,&quot; said Dr. Jones.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Doctor,&quot; they both said simultaneously, each blushing a little.<br />
<br />
Jeremy resisted the urge to laugh. It was almost like they were in school again, getting admonished by the teacher for cutting up in class. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now, Jerry.  You were just telling us about your relationship with Michele.  How has it been progressing?&quot; Dr. Jones continued.<br />
<br />
A small, short balding man was holding tightly to the hoofed hand of an uplifted gazelle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really well, Doctor. I think the Animalian Council will finally approve my application and let me convert so I can be her bond-mate,&quot; said Jerry happily.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is excellent, &quot; said Dr. Jones. &quot;Why don&#39;t you tell the rest of the group why you want to convert with Michele?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, because I love her,  &quot; said Jerry with a little confusion.<br />
<br />
The crowd chuckled softly.  Dr. Jones quickly silenced the group and continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we all understand that, Jerry.  But what specifically do you love about her?  What attracted you to her?&quot; asked Dr. Jones.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I love her soft fur, &quot; said Jerry, stroking her arm,&quot; her cute tail, her button nose and her horns....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, she is beautiful, Jerry,&quot; said Dr. Jones. &quot;But I would like to ask a question, if I may.  What is Michele&#39;s favorite food?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, oats I guess,&quot; said Jerry.<br />
<br />
Michele pulled her hand away and gently hit his arm.  &quot;You know that&#39;s not it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is her favorite movie?  Her favorite book? What does she like to do in her spare time?&quot; asked Dr. Jones.<br />
<br />
&quot;I ... I don&#39;t know,&quot; said Jerry sadly, looking down at the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you have some more work to do, Jerry.  You need to get to know Michele a little better. Conversion is an important step in a relationship, not to be taken lightly. It is a lifelong commitment.  There has to be something more than physical attraction if you want the relationship to last,&quot; said Dr. Jones.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Doctor,&quot; said Jerry.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fine, Jerry.  You did nothing wrong.  We are all here to learn, to help each other. I would suggest taking her on a few more dates, quiet places were you can just sit and talk, so you can really get to know one another.  Maybe some place she enjoys - like the park,&quot; suggested Dr. Jones.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would like that.  I like the park. The grass is nice, &quot; said Michele. &quot;Cool and soft.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There now, Michele seems to like the idea. Why don&#39;t you two have a nice date and  tell us all about it at our next session?&quot; suggested Dr. Jones.<br />
<br />
The couple kissed and the group clapped softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, who is next? How about you, Jill?&quot; said Dr. Jones.<br />
<br />
Jeremy turned to see a large female alligator sitting alone.  Well, she was sitting beside other Animalians, but he could not see another alligator in the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have been trying, Doctor.  I really have, &quot; said Jill, on the verge of tears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still no luck?&quot; asked Dr. Jones.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, but it&#39;s not my fault,&quot; said Jill, breaking down into sobs. &quot;It&#39;s just .... well, no one seems to like alligators.  Everyone always goes gaga over mammals.  They all think they are so cute and fluffy.  Everybody hates the scaly reptiles. No one wants to love me.  They think I am hideous!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jill began to cry loudly.  The other Animalians gently hugged her, patting her back and trying to compliment her appearance. Jeremy noted that none of the humans seemed to make any attempt to get near her.  As Jeremy scanned the room, he saw few reptiles. There was some kind of snake and a turtle, but the only other reptile in the room was Heather.  <br />
<br />
Jeremy could see Heather clenching and unclenching her fists.  He could tell this must have been a sore spot for her.  Was she also worried that no one would love her?  That everyone would think she was ugly?<br />
<br />
Jeremy reached out and gently patted her large, meaty thigh.  She looked down at him and smiled.  Then she reached down and grabbed onto his hand.  Jeremy felt a little uncomfortable, but still allowed her to engulf his small hand in her tight grip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, Jill, you know that is not true.  You are just as lovely as any other Animalian.  Do you regret your conversion?&quot; asked Dr. Jones.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I love being an alligator.  I was so excited when the Animalian Council accepted my application and agreed to let me be converted, &quot;  said Jill. &quot;It&#39;s just that... well, I thought that somebody else might like alligators as much as me.  But no one seems to want to be converted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jill, you know that is not how it is supposed to work.  Even if someone else did convert to an alligator, that doesn&#39;t mean he would necessarily become your partner.  Your mate should be someone you love and who loves you, someone who really cares about the person you are inside, not someone who just cares about what you look like, &quot; said Dr. Jones.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Have you tried online dating?&quot; asked a female black panther.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did!  But no one ever replies,&quot; said Jill.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you should try doing it without posting your picture,&quot; said the panther.<br />
<br />
The group hemmed and hawed, a few even booing or hissing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, now.  Let&#39;s be polite.  Let Rosie finish her point,&quot; said Dr. Jones.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Doctor.  I wasn&#39;t trying to be mean.  I think you are lovely, &quot; said Rosie. &quot;But you might be more likely to get a reply if they don&#39;t know what species you are.  You can have anonymous conversations online till you find the person you really click with.  If you think you are compatible, you know, feel the connection, then you can let him see what you look like. If he really does love you, he will stay with you.  At least he should.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you feel about that idea, Jill?&quot; asked Dr. Jones.<br />
<br />
Jill shrugged her shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess it couldn&#39;t hurt.  It&#39;s not like I am getting alot of offers now, &quot; said Jill. &quot;But what if I really like a guy and he still doesn&#39;t want to convert once he sees me?&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;Jill, if someone truly loves you, they will not care about your appearance. It will be a difficult decision, but I have found that most people are willing to convert to a species regardless of their personal preference if they really want to be with that person,&quot; said Dr. Jones. &quot;Of course, they may choose to be with you even if they do not wish to convert.  Thanks to the vaccine, interspecies dating is now a safe alternative option. Speaking of which, how are you two doing today Judy and Nick?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy followed Dr. Jones&#39; gaze to an odd pair, an uplifted rabbit and fox tightly holding hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are coping,&quot; said the female fox.  &quot;It is rough, knowing we can&#39;t have children.  But we are still hoping to adopt one day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s great, Judy. I am sure some child would be happy to have such loving parents.  The world could do with more love like that,&quot; said Dr. Jones.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I wish everyone was as open-minded.  We still face a lot of discrimination, from people and Animalians.  Not everyone is as comfortable with interspecies bond-mates,&quot; said the male rabbit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have patience, Nick,&quot; said Dr. Jones. &quot;This is a new situation for everyone.  The world changes, but it changes very slowly.  There are laws in place to protect your rights, but it may take a bit longer to change public opinion. Any more problems with intimacy?&quot; asked Dr. Jones.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it isn&#39;t always easy, what with our different anatomy and all that. But we manage. We try a lot of different things, positions and techniques, mind you. It can be frustrating sometimes. But I don&#39;t mind telling you the experimenting part can also be pretty fun,&quot; Nick.<br />
<br />
The group chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great to hear you are both making the most of the experience, Nick. I could recommend some books on the subject later if you would like, but it seems like you two are doing pretty well on your own. Remember, everyone - there are many, many ways to satisfy your partner,&quot; said Dr. Jones.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me about it,&quot; guffawed Nick.<br />
<br />
Judy gave Nick a playful slap and the group chuckled. Nick used a kiss to reconcile with Judy and the crowd clapped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I think this is a good time for a break.  We have coffee and donuts, bathroom down the hall.  We will meet back here in fifteen minutes,&quot; said Dr. Jones.<br />
<br />
After grabbing a cup of coffee, Jeremy made his way to a corner with Heather.  He felt a little guilty.  Dr. Jones had told him to socialize, but he found himself just hanging out with Heather.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for coming, Doc. I feel kinda stupid for coming, but it helps to be here with someone you know, &quot; said Heather.<br />
<br />
Jeremy chuckled.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You can call me, Jeremy.  We have certainly known each other long enough.  And it&#39;s not like we are at work, after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay ... Jeremy.  But thanks again.  I really owe you one.  If you ever need a favor, just ask,&quot; said Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I was wondering if you would come to the Halloween Carnival with me,&quot; said Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean, like a date?&quot; asked Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I don&#39;t know about that,&quot; said Jeremy, blushing a little. &quot;I mean, my sister Polly will be with us, too.  I promised I would take her to the fair.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, &quot; said Heather, the disappointment heavy in her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, but I would really like for you to come with me,&quot; said Jeremy nervously. Heather brightened up a little. &quot;Polly is very sweet, but she can be a handful. It&#39;s hard enough for me to keep her under control when she isn&#39;t over stimulated and hopped up on sugar and sweets.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, I&#39;d be happy to go with you,&quot; said Heather, smiling. It wasn&#39;t exactly a date, but it was a start.  And she would take it.  &quot;Oh, are you sure Polly wants me to come along? I was kinda rude to her...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I wouldn&#39;t worry about it. She really is a sweet kid.  She is very forgiving, believe me.  She has probably forgotten all about it, &quot; said Jeremy. &quot;And I am sure she will like you once she gets to know you like I do. Of course, if you really want to get on her good side you can bring her some seal meat. Its pretty expensive, considering it has to be exported from Canada, but it is her favorite meal. &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, group.  Let&#39;s take a seat and get started again, &quot; said Dr. Jones, clapping his hands.<br />
<br />
Everyone resumed their previous positions.  Heather sat down, holding out her hand to Jeremy.  He took it with a little more confidence this time.  Although they were still isolated in the back of the room, somehow Heather didn&#39;t feel so alone anymore.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Rosie.  I believe it is your turn.  And it looks like you brought a friend....&quot;</p>
