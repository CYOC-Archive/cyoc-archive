<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a typical fall Saturday morning in Moon Lake. A gentle wind blowing the leaves off of the many oak and elms growing about; signifying that wither is soon to come. With the streets quite save for the odd fitness freaks doing their morning jog and the paper boy delivering the daily news to various subscribers. Moon Lake was looking like your typical American town. Yet moon lake was home to the largest were population in the world. A population that has managed to remain secret; despite the recent advances in technology, which allows for the instant streaming of data from smart phones to various social media sites.<br />
<br />
While most people where still sleeping; Julie Stovall was just getting up. Pulling the covers off of her she was completely naked as she got out of bed. Sometime during the night after jilling off; the vibrator she left in her was eventually pushed out of her vagina. Putting on a bathrobe, Julie picks up the vibrator and carries it to the bathroom. Cleaning it off after she did her morning business on the toilet; Julie heads back to her room and places her toy back in its box under her bed. She gets dressed with a matching pair of bra and panties and puts on a simple shirt and blue jeans. Forgoing socks for the time being, Julie goes on her computer. Still oblivious that a worm from Brain Walker has infected it; Julie does a bit more research regarding the Spanish American war for a history report, despite the fact she was suspended from school. Her suspension was due to the fact that she assault Eric Anderson and Frieda Knight during freshman lunch. Being denied her chance to turn Eric into a were-mer, caused her to assault the two students despite many teachers sitting nearby. That act alone is why she now faces legal problems and will soon be required to stand in front of a judge and give a plea.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Eric Anderson a fourteen year old teenage were-panther was snuggled with his girlfriend Spenser Lawson; a fifteen year old werewolf/panther/feline hybrid was content as Eric hugged her while both slept. Despite wanting to be alone while their parents went back to their little fun; after last night’s adventure involving another of Benton’s outbursts, both the Anderson’s and Lawson’s felt all should be under the same roof. So Eric and Spenser were snuggled in spencer’s room while their parents went back to rutting with each other in the rec room. Neither party bothered to interrupt the other.<br />
<br />
Throughout the night the sounds of lustful partners could be heard upstairs and downstairs. It was enough to drive Mike Lawson batty who foolishly chose to sleep on the sofa. Unable to take the continual sound of the howling yipping and purring form the various were’s; he bolted out the back door and ran into the woods while in his fursona. Figuring he would at least get some sleep while curled up by a pine tree.<br />
<br />
****<br />
<br />
Nate Anderson was a sixteen year old werewolf; lying in between to bi-sexual weres. One a were-feline roughly the same age as him named Liv. The other an eighteen year old were-lioness named Jean Talbot. While Nate did have a disturbing nightmare involving the two horny ladies with him; he managed to shake it off and fall back to sleep. Sleep that was pleasantly interrupted when Jean woke him up and was rubbing her slit on his sheathe; trying to get his lupine rocket to come out and play.<br />
<br />
Still in the barn refereed as the old mill; a place where various wer-cat prides congregate at times; he was eager for more sex with the sexy were-lioness; Nate growls in approval as Jean gets his still rising penis in her eager snatch. Nate begins rocking and thrusting his hips, pushing his now fully engorged rod through Jean’s moist tunnel. With his knot quickly being enveloped by Jean’s lips, causing her to purr and yowl in pleasure. Not caring if Liv wakes up; Nate starts to thrust faster as he feels the churning sensation in his balls quickly travel up through his rod. Grunting as he releases his seed in Jean; Jean’s vaginal muscles clamp down and begin milking Nate, drinking every drop of sperm. Jean sighs as her own orgasm rocks her body. Liv who is by now awake and a witness to Nate and Jean’s act; is furiously pushing one of the vibrators she brought with her in and out of her snatch. The fur around it matted and crusted from the many acts of sex the day before.<br />
<br />

<br />
Frieda was up early despite not getting much sleep. After skyping Spencer to find Eric with her as well, she gives them an update on her mom’s condition. Not really wanting to talk about her father’s possibly being bi-polar, she watches yin and yang as they give her a strip tease and then burst into their fursonas over the encrypted skype channel.  Seeing Eric effortlessly shift into his were-panther form; an albino panther with striking green eyes and a larger then average cat like penis with flesh like barbs all along its length. It caused Frieda to become wet as she orgasms from the spectacle. Quickly shucking off her clothes she shifts into her fursona; a grey fur were-panther with russet highlights. While unable to join with them, Frieda was still able to get off by fingering herself; after watching the show both Eric and Spencer had to go. They made a promise to meet up Saturday to include her in on the fun. Frieda agreed but still had to look in on her mother in the morning.<br />
<br />
Which was why Frieda was up early; making some scrambled eggs for breakfast. While still in her fursona she was wearing a bathrobe as her father came into the kitchen. He looks at her daughter as she effortlessly puts the eggs with bacon and toast on two plates.<br />
“I didn’t know you could cook,” Benton looking dumbfounded.<br />
“Ethel, showed me as I did homework in the kitchen,” Frieda answers as she shifts back to her red headed human form; handing her dad a plate of breakfast as she sits to eat her own.<br />
Benton doesn’t say anything as accepts the food and dives in.<br />
<br />
“After we visit mom at the hospital I’m heading over to Spencer’s,” Frieda states. <br />
“Before we go their Frieda,” Benton answers shoveling food in his mouth; “I have a junk removal company coming by to get rid of the pile of trash bags in the garage.<br />
“Okay,” Frieda looking confused.<br />
“What I need from you is to watch over them. Make sure it’s only the pile that is removed. I would do it myself, but I have a press conference scheduled in the afternoon. I need the morning to get ready.<br />
“Press conference?” Frieda looking worried.<br />
“It’s regarding the elementary school having to close yesterday do to the damage it received in Thursday’s thunderstorm. I’m announcing a plan to fund and build an entirely new school.”<br />
“Does this have anything to do with the were council?” Frieda looking suspiciously.<br />
“No, it was your mother’s idea after she talked with Martha Anderson yesterday;” Benton shuddered at the word Anderson. The sucker punch he received from William at the hospital last night still fresh in his mind; “your mother thought it would be a great way to regain our social standing after my outburst at Tachibana.”<br />
“So it’s another power grabbing scheme,” Frieda answering disgustingly.<br />
“Well,” Benton pauses as he finishes breakfast; “it is and it isn’t. Think of it as a way for me to blunt whatever heavy-handed punishment the elder council will inflict on me; especially after last night.”<br />
 “Speaking of last night,” Frieda also finishing breakfast; “Did you at least think about what I said?” Frieda referring to her father getting tested to see if he is in fact bi-polar.<br />
“Let’s discuss that after your mother is better,” Benton answering calmly as he collects the plates but is unsure where to put them.<br />
“Try the dishwasher,” Frieda rolling her eyes in embarrassment.<br />
“I would but she along with the rest of the staff quit,” Benton looking confused.<br />
“No the machine under the countertop next to the sink,” Frieda answers.<br />
“Oh,” Benton realizes as he opens the door to put the plates in it.</p>
