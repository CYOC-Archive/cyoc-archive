<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Heather did not sleep like a baby. A baby tosses and turns, wakes up every hour and cries, and is impossible to put back to sleep again. Heather did the exact opposite. She lay flat on her back while sleep held her in a dreamless grip. When she was eventually woken up it was a rough shake and not a gentle one that pulled her back to consciousness.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s time to wake up sleepyhead!&quot; said a chipper voice.<br />
<br />
Heather cracked her eyes open reluctantly and squinted blearily up at the face hovering above hers. It was Mel. She was smiling gently.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mel? Whuh?&quot; Heather mumbled around the pacifier still in her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wakey Wakey!&quot; Mel replied. &quot;Nap time&#39;s over. Time to eat, and then later we can play some more.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather&#39;s memory clicked back on and everything that had happened earlier came back in a rush. She blushed heavily as she realized that she was still in a thick diaper and still very much turned on from what Mel did to her. Hoping that maybe, in spite of the evidence she was still wearing, all of it was just a very vivid wet dream, Heather rolled onto her side and looked around at her room. The crib bars were right in front of her face. Through them she could see that the rest of her room was still too pink and full of furniture that wasn&#39;t built with the average teen girl in mind.<br />
<br />
She also saw the booklet. It was sitting in the middle of the floor, exactly where it had been earlier. If she could just reach it...<br />
<br />
Mel&#39;s gangling frame stepped between her and her prize. Heather couldn&#39;t help but stare at her. The t-shirt and shorts she had worn to the park had been replaced by a short-sleeved navy blue dress that fell to just below her knee. The way it was cut showed that she did have some slight curves on her stick thin body. She was wearing stockings, something Heather had never seen her wear in all the years she had known her, and her feet were in a pair of sensible brown shoes. She looked a bit like a (stereotypical) professional British nanny. She bent over so she could look Heather in the face.<br />
<br />
&quot;You awake yet?&quot; She cooed. &quot;Come on now. Your mommy made dinner and we don&#39;t want it to get cold.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mel? Din- Mommy?!&quot; A note of panic was starting to seep into Heather&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep!&quot; Mel chirped, reaching through the crib bars to tousle Heather&#39;s hair. &quot;She got home shortly after we did. She decided to let you nap while she cooked so dinner would be ready when you woke up. Dinner&#39;s ready now, so it&#39;s time for you to get up!&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather struggled to roll onto her hands and knees, but Mel dropped the railing on her crib and scooped her up before she could. Once again she found herself being carried by her best friend like a baby, the thick padding of her diaper being ground into her sex by Mel&#39;s bony hip. Heather resisted the urge to grind herself further, but only barely. As Mel swept from the room Heather&#39;s diapered rear was wiggling far more than she felt it should be. Mel didn&#39;t seem to notice.<br />
<br />
Mel carried Heather down the stairs, through the living room, and into the kitchen. As they drew closer Heather began to smell the spicy scent of her mom&#39;s signature tomato sauce. That usually meant spaghetti. Heather loved spaghetti. Mel strode into the kitchen and greeted Heather&#39;s mom who was standing at the stove dishing noodles and sauce into bowls.<br />
<br />
Mandy Linton was 39 years old. Tall, broad of shoulder and hip, with long brown hair tied back in a ponytail. Heather always thought she looked like a quintessential mom, almost stereotypical. She had been worried that the weird changes may have affected her, but her mom was exactly as she had always been. She turned as they entered the kitchen and smiled broadly at the both of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;There you are!&quot; She gushed enthusiastically. &quot;I haven&#39;t seen my little girl all day!&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather blushed as Mel carried her over to the kitchen table. Her mom may still look the same, but she had changed. Under normal circumstances she would have never reacted to seeing her daughter dressed as an oversize infant with such enthusiasm. Trying to ignore her own embarrassment she looked at the new addition to the kitchen furniture. The table was the same as it always had been, a massive and heavy wooden one with a well-scrubbed surface. Around it were six matching chairs, one of which had a booster seat strapped to it for her little brother. But now one of the chairs was missing, replaced by a wooden highchair sized for a small teen. Heather knew this was for her even before Mel pulled the tray out and deposited her into the seat. By now she was resigned to her fate and simply sat while she was buckled in and the tray was replaced in front of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it just us tonight?&quot; Mel asked Mandy while she tied a bib around Heather&#39;s neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Mandy answered. &quot;Steve took Derek with him to the basketball game for a &#39;guy&#39;s night&#39; and Hillary practically lives at her friend&#39;s house these days. I don&#39;t expect any of them to be back until very late tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather watched as her mother took knife and fork and cut up the contents of one of the bowls she had filled. This she placed on the tray in front of Heather along with a small bottle of juice and took Heather&#39;s pacifier from her mouth. Mel took a seat at the table with her own bowl and dug in with enthusiasm. Heather looked down at her meal. Neither Mel nor her mother had given her any utensils. She didn&#39;t even bother trying to ask. With a sigh she dug her fingers into the saucy mess and began eating. She had to admit that it was fun despite being very messy. Her mother&#39;s spaghetti was always out of this world and not even the weird changes could effect that. Before long all three bowls were empty and Mandy began cleaning the dishes while Mel cleaned Heather.<br />
<br />
Heather tried to object but Mel just pushed past her waving arms and attacked her face with a damp cloth. The cloth quickly turned orange and Mel had to stop more than once to rinse it in the sink. When Heather&#39;s face was finally clean Mel removed the tray and undid the straps holding her in. Heather braced herself, expecting Mel to lift her from the seat, but instead Mel reached down and pressed her hand into the padding between her legs. Caught entirely off-guard and still more than a little worked up from earlier, Heather let out a small groan as the padding was pressed up against her. Mel gave her an impish smile and wiggled her fingers a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does she need a change?&quot; Mandy called from the sink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mrs. P.&quot; Mel said over her shoulder. &quot;She&#39;s quite wet. I think I should probably give her a bath before I go home tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, I&#39;ll leave her to you then. I&#39;ll be in the living room watching that new show if you need me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mel removed her hand from Heather&#39;s diaper and picked her up again. When Heather was placed onto her hip she could both hear and feel just how wet her diaper was.<br />
<br />
&#39;How did it get this wet without me noticing?&#39; she thought, a little scared. &#39;I&#39;m wetting and I can&#39;t even feel it. Is this permanent?&#39;<br />
<br />
She thought again of the little booklet on her floor. She needed to get it. First chance she got she was going to make a break for it. She thought she would get her chance very soon. Mel was carrying her back up the stairs. Heather braced herself. She knew Mel still had her freakish strength but she was hoping that maybe if she caught her friend by surprise she might just break free. It would be risky, but Heather needed to take the chance. Mel reached the top of the stairs.<br />
<br />
Heather...</p>
