<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After the sleepover at Greg&#39;s place, Ethan and Eric went home on Sunday morning. Ethan had left a message for their dad the previous night, and although he probably wasn&#39;t happy about it, he usually let stuff like this go, so long as they kept out of trouble.<br />
<br />
Both boys finished off their homework, completing it to satisfaction. Ethan was a good student, and he made sure his brother kept up with schoolwork too. Then after their lunch, he had a chat with Eric about &#39;the situation&#39; as it currently was.<br />
<br />
&quot;So since I&#39;m going to have Haylee&#39;s parts until I see her and Greg at school tomorrow, I&#39;ll have to leave us changing back until after I pick you up,&quot; Ethan explained. &quot;I know you&#39;ve been enjoying having it, but we&#39;ll need to swap back then.&quot; He hesitated for a moment, feeling oddly nervous at admitting anything, even to his little brother, whom he loved a lot. &quot;I&#39;ll make you a promise though. We&#39;ll ... do it again, soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric&#39;s visible disappointment immediately vanished, replaced by hope. &quot;Really?! That means a lot to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Weird as it sounds, I&#39;ve been enjoying it too.&quot; Ethan smiled at his brother, who returned it. &quot;Why quit when we&#39;re both having fun?&quot;<br />
<br />
For the rest of the day, they went about their business. Eric played some video games, and of course spent a decent amount of his remaining time enjoying his larger teenaged dick. Jerking off was awesome fun, and he was getting very familiar with the weight and size of it, and how natural it was to have it hanging from his groin. It felt like it was as much his, as his original was, but more real somehow, like an improved &#39;true&#39; version. Sort of like a superhero next to his normal alter ego -- a Supercock to his Clark Kent regular cock! The idea of it made Eric giggle.<br />
<br />
Ethan, on the other hand, felt more than a little awkward. He did some research for a paper and then took a shower before the evening. For a male teenager who was used to carrying a good sized mass, his empty flat crotch was disconcerting, and though he wanted to think about it as little as possible, his mind couldn&#39;t help wandering there while he was making sure everything was clean.<br />
<br />
The experience with Greg the previous night WAS fun. In the same way as having his brother&#39;s tiny child-sized cock, the fact that Ethan liked it made him feel really strange, and a little ashamed. Also like the brotherly swap, he for some reason wanted to experience those feelings more, despite the internal humiliation his emotions went through when he thought about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I guess I&#39;ll have to ask Haylee tomorrow,&quot; Ethan said to himself, before he went to sleep on Sunday night for the following school day. He wanted to learn more about what he was feeling. &quot;Maybe ... we can work something out.&quot;<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
Before classes began, Ethan met up with Greg and Haylee to reverse their swap. First, with Greg alone, on his request, so his ex didn&#39;t know he hadn&#39;t been able to last the distance with girl parts. Then after that they found her.<br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;s it hanging?&quot; She greeted them with a standard hello that quickly became a joke, as she looked pointedly at Greg. &quot;Oops, I forgot. It isn&#39;t!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha-ha-ha. Funny.&quot; He deadpanned. &quot;Can we get this over with so I can go to class as ... you know ... myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, alright, don&#39;t get your panties in a bunch.&quot; Haylee smirked. &quot;Hand them over, instead.<br />
<br />
Wordless at her puns, Greg passed her an old pair of boxers and Ethan handed her the ring, and she went off to the girl&#39;s bathroom. A minute later, Greg drew in a breath and then sighed. &quot;There it is. Thank god for that.&quot; He nudged Ethan&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Thanks for keeping your word, but I&#39;m glad that&#39;s over. See you in class. Tell her to chuck the boxers.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that he was gone, and Haylee emerged a few moments later.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did he run already?&quot; She laughed, passing the ring back to him. &quot;For an athlete, he&#39;s a bit of a wimp sometimes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No kidding.&quot; Ethan agreed. Thinking quickly, he asked her about her experience. &quot;So, how did you like being, uh, &#39;one of the guys&#39; ... ?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was definitely interesting. I mean, I&#39;ve seen a few dicks, but having one is different.&quot; Though she wasn&#39;t what Ethan considered slutty or easy, Haylee was honest about having some experience with other guys. She seemed to be true to herself though, and not a fake personality like a lot of highschool girls were. He liked that about her, and she definitely was pretty, plus ... she had been very chill after discovering his swap with Eric. No judgement or anything like that. &quot;Getting off is easier, but pretty neat. Messier though, I think my mom believes I have a cold the amount of Kleenex I went through.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, you must have been busy through the weekend.&quot; Ethan commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have no idea.&quot; She giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um,&quot; he paused, &quot;hope you don&#39;t mind the question, but, I was wondering ... since I did you a favour with Greg, would you be prepared to repay that with another swap?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Another one? With who?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan took a deep breath. &quot;With ... me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You?&quot; Her eyes went wide, but then her expression became calculating, and cunning. &quot;Actually ... I might be interested, but ... this isn&#39;t really a great place to talk about it. Can you come to my house after school? My parents and brother won&#39;t be home &#39;til later, and we can have a private discussion without being bothered.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; He nodded. &quot;I&#39;ll have to drop Eric off first, but after that I should have some time before my dad gets back from work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect.&quot;<br />
<br />
They exchanged cell numbers and addresses, and went their separate ways.<br />
<br />
The rest of his classes cruised by. It was just another school day for Ethan, and apart from the sensitive little nub in his pants seeming to go stiff at the slightest provocation, he managed to reach the final bell without incident. After picking up his brother, they drove home, chatting along the way. Eric was upbeat, enjoying school more in his current form, but underneath it he was clearly glum about returning to how things were. Ethan couldn&#39;t help but feel guilty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, bro.&quot; He gave Eric his reassurance right before they swapped back. &quot;I promised you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Eric sighed, but then smiled. &quot;I trust you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Putting on the ring and focusing, Ethan felt his crotch fill out again, the familiar weight pushing into his underwear. At the same time, Eric&#39;s shrank away, returning to its diminished state.<br />
<br />
Letting his brother know he had to go see a classmate about a &#39;new project&#39;, Ethan departed the house and set out for Haylee&#39;s place. Though it wasn&#39;t strictly a lie, he still felt bad about not being properly open with Eric, but he wanted to protect his brother. Telling Eric that he was considering swapping his cock away temporarily with someone else might have caused hurt feelings. Ethan swore to himself he was going to make it up to Eric. The two of them were close and had always looked out for each other.<br />
<br />
Haylee&#39;s family home was big, with two stories, her family quite well off. Meeting him at the door, she invited him inside and led him through the house and upstairs to her room. As she told him, nobody else was home, so they sat down on her bed and began to talk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, the only reason I&#39;m really considering this is because I really do like you.&quot; Haylee shrugged. &quot;I wasn&#39;t exaggerating just to get into your pants when I told you that. Also, any guy who&#39;s willing to stand up for his kid brother like you is a cut above most of the others.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan nodded. &quot;There&#39;s not much I wouldn&#39;t do for Eric.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough about that though. You&#39;re curious about what it&#39;s like on &#39;the other side&#39;, just like I was, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
He nodded again, not about to admit that he&#39;d already had a taste of it thanks to Greg, and just wanted to find out more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, before we go any further,&quot; she asked, &quot;are you back to being yourself? Because the first of my two conditions to agreeing is that my swap is with YOU, for YOUR dick. I want the full sized salami in trade, not a cocktail sausage, if you understand me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan went red. &quot;Y-yeah, I gotcha.&quot; He stammered. &quot;I&#39;m back to, um, myself. What&#39;s the second condition?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s non-negotiable.&quot; She said. &quot;The second condition is a blowjob.&quot;<br />
<br />
He blinked. &quot;Uh ... what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A blowjob,&quot; Haylee repeated. &quot;After we swap, I want you to suck my cock.&quot;</p>
