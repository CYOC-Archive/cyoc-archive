<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Liam sat there momentarily, he began to feel a weird tingle coursing through his body. He felt it start at his legs and torso, as if his legs were getting static shocks. He looked down and saw as his legs and torso grew longer, pushing him from a modest 5’6” to a large 6’2”. Liam looked at Evelyn in shock, he really was transforming! Evelyn looked at Liam with a devilish grin, saying “If you think this is great, just wait for the rest!” Liam began to feel another change coming along, as his body began to bulk up. He saw as legs began to explode with muscle and his torso expands as the muscle began to pack onto his slim figure. Liam lifted up his shirt just in time to see his abs just pop into existence. “Whoa! This is so nice!” Liam said as he felt his sculpted abs and began to reach around as he felt his ass tingle as the muscle pushed it from flat to bubble butt. As he lifted his shirt up more, he saw thick slabs of pectoral muscle slide onto his figure, leaving him with an amazing, thick, muscular rack that could leave even the biggest girls jealous. His clothes however, would soon be unable to handle the growth as his jeans were straining at his tight, sculpted ass and thick legs in his skinny jeans. His shirt wasn’t faring well also, leaving it almost painted onto his body with his thick figure from his thick chest and abs to his growing biceps leaving his sleeves straining for any room to breathe. <br />
However, this stunning growth of Liam’s began to change in the opposite direction. As Liam was admiring his body, he began to notice a different feeling beginning to overcome him. He couldn’t quite describe it, but he felt…. heavier. He looked and saw as his legs began to expand once more, but this time it wasn’t with muscle, rather fat. He saw his well-defined legs soon just become large thick figures with little to no definition. “Wait a second, what’s happening to me?” Liam cried as his dream body was soon becoming overtaken with adipose. His abs, that once looked like they were hand sculpted by the gods, were slowly disappearing, as a firm thick tire of fat began to spread across his torso. Although Liam had the fear of his body becoming round everywhere, his muscles just lost some slight definition as his biceps became larger but not as defined, with his pecs slightly drooping with this extra padding that surrounded his former fit physique. As Liam explored his new body, he began to feel a breeze along his scalp. He went up and grabbed his hair, only to find that more than half of it was contained within his hair. His once slick and styled hair style was now gone, leaving him with a bald dome atop his head.<br />
As the transformation began to finish up, Liam felt his face rearrange as he began to take the final form of the subject. Liam put his hands to his face, feeling the slightly doughy beginnings of a double chin along with a 5 o’clock shadow as he felt the prickles of facial hair. Liam soon was able to move, and he quickly rushed to the bathroom to see his new form. As he made his way to the bathroom, he could feel that heavy footsteps had overtaken his once light, almost undetectable movements. With this body, Liam knew that they would always know he was coming, either by the sheer size or his loud footsteps signaling his arrival.<br />
Like he assumed, the face staring back at him in the mirror was not his own, rather a completely foreign of an older age.  His face was lined with some slight wrinkles, light but fairly noticeable along with a broad face that was accompanied with the soft addition of fat distributed across his cheeks and down to his chin. His nose was much larger that once it originally had been as well, trading in his once petite nose to a pudgy mushroom shape that seemed to just have been thrown onto his face. As Liam felt the stubble of his new beard, he could feel that the thin fingers he originally had were now a lot more chubby and thick, while still being incredibly worn from what he assumes could be caused from this body’s profession. However, as he looked at his new body, Liam found that this new face of his coincided with his body rather well, completing that look of an ex-jock, around the age of 35, who just had a bit too much to eat between workouts. Intrigued about the change, he began to take note of all the additions he had not noticed upon first glance. Looking around his new body, he saw the formation of several tattoos etch its self across his skin, ranging from anything like barb wire to tribal patterns around his shoulder. This body seemed to be an absolute definition of the masculinity that Liam so often sought for. Although the body wasn’t in the peak form, he still was beginning to change his mind on what he needed to have to be happy in life. As Liam reached a chubby hand towards his gut, he began to play with it almost child-like, lifting it up and letting it drop down, sending his whole torso shuttering in ripples. He saw that his pecs had long since expanded with muscle but had then slightly drooped down as fat provided a soft layer. Liam thought about it and realized that it wasn’t as bad as he thought. For example, he could just be a skinny twink all his life, or he could have a body like this, showing off his large muscles while not being intimidating with his extra padding. It just seemed to be perfect the more he thought about it, from his bald hair to his padded muscles, he just seemed to have the perfect look that he had sought for when he went to college.<br />
<br />
Liam then returned to the main room where Evelyn and Jeremy awaited him. Just as he was about to ask a question, Evelyn quickly stopped him by saying &quot;Alright, so how are we feeling? Do you enjoy this body?&quot; Liam responded &quot;Yes, I absolutely love it! I&#39;d be so happy to have this body, it&#39;s definitely what I dreamed I&#39;d look like when I&#39;m older&quot;. &quot;Well, alright, let me set this up and I&#39;ll give you the entire personality of Subject 3125&quot;. &quot;Wait, I don&#39;t get to keep my person-&quot;. Liam suddenly stopped speaking as Evelyn finalized the swap, flooding his mind with the memories associated with his new body...</p>
