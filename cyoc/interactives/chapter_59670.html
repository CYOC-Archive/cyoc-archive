<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff was surprised to receive a package in the mail. He'd never heard of TransDem Labs. He'd been known to order computer games and <br />
volunteer to beta test new games but this was the first time he'd been sent a package that he hadn't known about. He thought that maybe it <br />
was just a new game that this company wanted him to beta test.<br />
<br />
He took it inside and began installing it on his computer. Although there were no instructions, which was very unusual, anyone who'd beta <br />
tested games could easily figure out how to use the different parts. So once the install was complete, he opened the program to see what kind <br />
of game it was. He expected the program to ask him his name and registration information but he was surprised when the program instead <br />
said, &quot;Scanning . . .&quot; and then began listing his name and registration information. Then the program started listing other information such as <br />
his height and weight. Jeff wondered where the program was getting such detailed information. Then he looked at the emitter and thought that <br />
the emitter must be scanning him. Then the program listed stats about his room size, the decorations on the walls, and had even listed his <br />
parents names.<br />
<br />
The computer went on like this for hours. It was a very fast program but the amount of information it was processing was so vast that Jeff got <br />
bored and left the program running while he watched t.v.<br />
<br />
When he came back to the program, it had finished and showed a 3-D image of Jeff and his room on the screen. Jeff had already realized by <br />
this point that this was no ordinary game. He noticed that the trash can in the room on the screen was full of garbage just like the trash can in <br />
his real room. So He decided to test out the program by emptying the garbage can of the 3-D simulation. As soon as he did, the trash can in <br />
his bedroom also became empty. He realized that this device just might have the power to change reality. He did a few more simple tests to <br />
confirm this: changed his walls to green, repaired the drawer knob that had broken off three days ago, added more light. Jeff was afraid to try <br />
any major changes yet.<br />
<br />
He began looking through all the options. Most of the options were ways that he could change himself, not just the room around him. He <br />
thought about changing his body to make himself more attractive to the ladies but thought if that was all he was going to do with such a <br />
powerful device, it would be a waste. He looked at the options of becoming an adult or reliving the fun of being a kid again. He thought this <br />
program could be so much fun when he saw the options where he could turn himself into an animal temporarily. He even contemplated some <br />
of the inanimate options he could change himself into and thought inanimate would certainly be an exotic adventure. To go inanimate might <br />
be too much of an adventure with too great a risk but then again, Jeff might just be brave enough to try it. But he couldn't make a decision. He <br />
went back and forth looking through all the options but not deciding what to try.<br />
<br />
Then a tiny window popped up. This window only had three buttons. The first button said, &quot;Let Chronivac Read Your Mind&quot;. The second button <br />
was a question mark that looked like a help button. The third button was just so Jeff could close the window. This program was designed so <br />
that if anyone spent fifteen minutes exploring options without making a decision, this window would pop up.<br />
<br />
Jeff selected the help button and a larger window appeared that read, &quot;If you are having trouble deciding, it is probably because you want many <br />
things and some of the things you want can't be done at the same time. You can't have your cake and eat it too. This program comes with an <br />
option where, based on the stats that our emitter has collected, this program will attempt to predict what you would want. If you are short, this <br />
program may predict that you want to be tall. This program is much more sophisticated in it's predictions as it also takes into account other <br />
factors such as your room decor. If you have a bunch of baseball posters on your wall, this program may predict that you want to be a major <br />
league baseball player. Letting this program predict your desires automatically provides you with a unique package custom tailored to you but <br />
you don't have to spend hours answering questions in order to customize it yourself. Just push the button and this program will fill in all the <br />
options for you. WARNING: any mementos of your old life that you wish to preserve should be taken more than twenty feet away from the <br />
emitter before activating this option.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff looked around his room and wondered what the program might predict. He did have a baseball glove but it was sitting right next to an old <br />
science project of his. His room showed a variety of different interests but there was no overall theme. His room was full of generic odds and <br />
ends. Jeff decided that he wanted to see what the computer could come up with based on the decor of his room. He pushed the button.</p>
