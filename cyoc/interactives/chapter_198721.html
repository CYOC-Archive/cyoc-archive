<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tom realized that of his wife were to return to her human form she would be pissed! She would hate Tom forever. How could she not? He had turned her into a dog. Allowed his dog to fuck her like a common bitch. And he had even tried to get his dog to mate with himself. <br />
<br />
Samantha would probably want a divorce after this, I mean, how much how a man could she think her husband was after watching him submit to his own pet like that? Though he now realized that it must have been the intelligence of 3 setting that caused him to crave being mounted like the bitch he had become.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when he thought of an idea. The intelligence setting. He could adjust his wife to be more dog in mind and keep her this way. She wouldn&#39;t leave him because, well, she&#39;d be a dumb loyal animal now. Tom looked at Max. Max would love it I&#39;m sure. Tom realized that unless he had his wife fixed, which seemed to cruel, he would basically be giving her to Max as a mate. <br />
<br />
Tom couldn&#39;t think of another way to keep his wife around, she would not be a good dog if he kept her with her human mind. <br />
<br />
&quot;Samantha, come inside with me. Let&#39;s see if we can figure this out.&quot; Tom said and instinctively patted his leg at her, like he was calling over any other dog. His wife looked at him unamused, but followed anyways. <br />
<br />
As she approached Tom she was cut off by Max, who was still very horny. <br />
<br />
&quot;Max no!&quot; Tom yelled. &quot;Not ye...I mean no! Bad dog!&quot; And he gently pushed Max aside so his wife could go inside. <br />
<br />
Once Tom and Samantha were both inside, Tom closed the sliding door behind them, locking Max outside. Tom looked back at the sad face of Max and thought to himself &#39;You can have her back in a minute.&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lets go to my office, I think I know how to fix this.&quot; Tom told Samantha as they made their way through the home they shared together with their family. <br />
<br />
Tom sat down at the computer chair, his discarded clothes still laying on the ground from when he had turned himself into a greyhound bitch. <br />
<br />
Samantha came and sat awkwardly, she was still not completely use to her new body, beside Tom and looked at the screen. She may have been a dog, but she could still read. She saw the main menu with the stats of her family listed. And quickly noticed that under her name, listed for species, was dog! Samantha quickly started to put the pieces together, that her husband was responsible for all this! It was his fault she was a dog! His fault Max had fucked her and he had even turned himself into a bitch! What a sicko! She started growling at Tom and snarling in anger. <br />
<br />
Tom wasted no time. He quickly clicked edit next to Samantha. &quot;I&#39;m going to fix this! Don&#39;t worry!&quot; He said. He skipped over the species option, which for some reason seemed to be dithered out anyways, and went to intelligence. He hesitated for a moment before deciding to enter 9. The screen description said &#39;Mind 90 percent dog, 10 percent human&#39; Tom figured that he was being kind in doing this.<br />
<br />
Samantha read the screen and yelped in fear! <br />
<br />
Tom, before Samantha had a chance to lunge at him, quickly clicked the Commit button!<br />
<br />
Samantha froze. She whined. She barked. Her brain was changing. It was an odd feeling. Slowly changing from her human brain to that of a dog&#39;s, mostly. Complex thoughts started to fade, her anger lessened. Feelings started to simplify. Her once wonderful, smart, self was quickly replaced with a dog. She was filled with the desire to eat, drink, sleep, play and mate. But what was most disturbing was that the part of her brain that remained human was aware of everything. She was a prisoner in her own mind. <br />
<br />
Tom would never know that leaving that 10 percent human brain would be like a dog lifetime of torture for his wife, well ex-wife now. <br />
<br />
Tom watched the intelligence fade from Samantha&#39;s eyes. And realized bit was done. His wife was now a dog. In body and in mind. <br />
<br />
There was a ding from the computer and he turned his attention back to it. A window had popped up that read <br />
