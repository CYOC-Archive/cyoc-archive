<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I think we should take the first door,&quot; Michael said. Sara and Bai nodded their <br />
agreement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well the first door it is then,&quot; I said taking another look around the room. I didn't want <br />
to go through the door but there was no sense in staying here. Either way I was sure <br />
I'd be transformed in time. I opened the door and we found ourselves looking not at <br />
another room or hall but a forest. This made me nervous but we had decided to take <br />
this door. Michael and Bai walled through the door trying to prove that they were <br />
brave. Sara grabbed my arm and looked up at me. I sighed and said, &quot;We'd better go <br />
after them.&quot; Sara looked scarred but nodded and we went through the door.<br />
<br />
Once we were through the door slammed shut causing me to jump and Sara to <br />
scream. We looked back only to find that the door was gone. Sara began shaking and <br />
asked, &quot;Why did the door disappear?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; I admitted. &quot;All I know is that more than likely we won't be able to get <br />
back to that room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does that mean I can't go home?&quot; Sara asked looking at me with pleading eyes.<br />
<br />
I knew that she wanted me to say that it didn't mean that at all. I couldn't lie to her so I <br />
said, &quot;I don't know. Though I promise you that I'll do all I can to get you back home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Sara said a few tears rolling down her cheeks.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're welcome,&quot; I said with a smile. &quot;We'd better hurry and catch up to Michael and <br />
Bai or we'll lose them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok,&quot; Sara said trying to smile.<br />
<br />
We set off on the path and didn't go far when Michael and Bai jumped out from the <br />
bushes on either side of the path growling. I jumped and pushed Sara behind me <br />
while she screamed. They started laughing and Michael said, &quot;The look on your faces <br />
was priceless.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That wasn't funny,&quot; I said anger in my voice. &quot;In case you've forgotten Michael we're <br />
in a forest in a CYOC story. There could be anything in here just waiting to either kill <br />
us or transform us. I don't know about you but I don't want to die and I'm sure Sara <br />
doesn't either.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright don't be so angry,&quot; Michael said putting his hands up. &quot;I was just trying to <br />
lighten the mood.&quot;<br />
<br />
We eventually started walking again though we each listened carefully for any sound <br />
that might mean danger. We walked for a long time stopping every now and then so <br />
one of us could pee. We were getting hungry and thirsty by the time the sun started to <br />
set. I didn't want to eat anything here since it would probably transform us. However I <br />
knew that we would eventually eat something no matter what the consequences would <br />
be. Our thirst would also get the best of us if we came to a stream or river. I should <br />
have known that we would come upon a lake when we couldn't resist quenching our <br />
thirst. Sara was the first one of us to run to the lake and drink the water. Michael and <br />
Bai were right behind her and against my better judgement I too went and drank the <br />
water.<br />
<br />
Once we had our fill of the water the changes began. First all our clothes just simply <br />
vanished. This caused Sara to yelp and scrunch up to try and hide her nudity. Then I <br />
felt a tingling all over my body. I watched as all my body hair fell out. I reached up to <br />
my face and felt that the stubble had also fallen out. I then felt myself shrinking until I <br />
was just a little taller than Sara. I looked at Michael and Bai and saw that they had <br />
also shrunk though Bai didn't shrink as much as me and Michael did. Bai was just a <br />
little shorter than Sara now and Michael was the same height as me. Our hair grew <br />
long and changed to blue. I looked at Sara and saw that her hair had also turned blue. <br />
I thought I knew what was coming next so I looked down at my dick in time to see it <br />
and my ball sack melt into my body leaving a smooth doll-like crotch. It didn't last long <br />
as a slit formed between my legs. With that I was a girl and I saw that Michael and Bai <br />
were also girls now. The changes weren't done however as our bodies slimmed down <br />
a bit and me and Michael grew breasts. They weren't big but they were noticeable and <br />
I thought Michael's were bigger than mine. Bai had a bit more happen to him. His face <br />
lost the oriental look and his skin lightened until he looked like the rest of us. Finally <br />
clothes appeared on us or what were clothes in ancient Greece.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot; Michael asked and put his hand over his mouth upon hearing his <br />
voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we were transformed of course,&quot; I said shaking my head. &quot;We're girls now. I <br />
don't know how long we'll remain girls or what we'll become if we get transformed <br />
again.&quot; I then turned my attention to Sara and kneeling by her said, &quot;You don't have to <br />
stay like that. You have clothes on again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No I don't,&quot; Sara said looking at me. &quot;It's embarrassing but...&quot; She blushed and <br />
couldn't continue.<br />
<br />
I understood what she was embarrassed about and nodding said, &quot;All any of us are <br />
wearing is a chiton. It's what was worn by ancient Greeks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know what they are?&quot; Sara asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had wondered what the ancient Greeks wore one time so I looked it up,&quot; I said <br />
shrugging. &quot;These are Doric chitons made out of linen if I'm not mistaken. It's just a <br />
rectangle of fabric where the fold is on the left side of the body. It's pinned up on the <br />
shoulders and a belt is worn around either under the bust or around the waist. The <br />
fabric is taller than the person so the excess is pulled up through the belt and allowed <br />
to drape over it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Weren't the white though?&quot; Michael asked looking at his chiton which was blue with <br />
gold trim.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mostly they were brightly colored,&quot; I said looking at him, I mean her.<br />
<br />
Suddenly a woman came out of some bushes and said, &quot;There you girls are. Poseidon <br />
and Amphitrite would throw me into the deepest pits of Tartarus if anything happened <br />
to you four. Now let's get back to the palace.&quot; She walked into the lake and kept on <br />
walking until she was submerged. Maybe she kept on walking after that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is the palace at the bottom of the lake?&quot; Bai asked looking confused. &quot;And who are <br />
Poseidon and Amphitrite?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Poseidon is the Greek god of the sea and Amphitrite is his wife,&quot; I said looking at the <br />
lake. &quot;The palace won't be in the lake but in the sea.&quot;<br />
<br />
We stood there for awhile wondering if we should follow the woman or not. Her head <br />
appeared above the water along with the heads of five horses. She looked angry as <br />
she said, &quot;Anthea, Nausikaa, Dike, Semele, get on the hippocampi so we can get to <br />
the palace. If you don't I'll tell your father how disobedient you have been and he won't <br />
let you out of the palace for a long time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michael looked at me and asked, &quot;What do we do now?&quot;</p>
