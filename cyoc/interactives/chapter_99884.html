<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex figured that he might as well drop off his luggage at his room before heading over to the Gender Wing. As he began walking down the hallway that was the Age Wing he passed by two woman pushing along strollers with toddlers strapped inside, a boy and girl around three or four years old. He wasn&#39;t fooled though, Alex knew that they were actually regressed adults who were here to re-experience the joys of babyhood.<br />
<br />
As he continued to search for his room he came across more little kids, all of whom were under the age of five. He also noticed that the maid&#39;s carts for the Wing contained a large supply of baby diapers, containers of baby wipes, and bottles of baby powder. Alex wasn&#39;t surprised by this as from what he heard the majority of the people who stayed in the Age Wing regressed back to ages where they needed to wear diapers again.<br />
<br />
Alex shook his head, he didn&#39;t understand why people would rather be a baby and use a diaper rather than be a adult and use the toilet.<br />
<br />
After five more minutes of searching he finally found the room and set his luggage down in order to get the key card from his pocket.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there!&quot; a voice called out.<br />
<br />
He turned to his left and noticed a three year old boy standing there watching him. The toddler had short blonde hair and was dressed in a red Pokemon themed t-shirt and a pampers disposable diaper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi I&#39;m Scott, you must be my roommate&quot; the toddler said with a friendly smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh yeah the name&#39;s Alex&quot; he responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to meet ya. Hey if you don&#39;t mind me asking how young are you going to get?&quot; Scott asked curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I&#39;m not getting young at all. There was a mistake with my reservation and I got stuck with a room in the Age Wing. I&#39;m actually supposed to be staying in the Gender Wing. I just here to drop of my stuff and then I&#39;ll be heading over there. You probably won&#39;t see me at all for the next two weeks&quot; he explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry to hear that. If you change your mind feel free to come over to my room and we can play together&quot; Scott offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks but I&#39;m not interested in going back to diapers&quot; Alex replied firmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;But that&#39;s the best part of being a baby, getting to wear and use diapers again&quot; the toddler exclaimed, &quot;I&#39;ve been wearing diapers for almost a day now and I wonder why I ever got potty trained in the first place. Going in a diaper is way better then using a toilet if you as me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot;<br />
<br />
Scott nodded, &quot;Yeah, not only are they convenient and give you the freedom to go whenever you want and wherever you want. I don&#39;t have to worry about finding a toilet when I need to use the bathroom because I&#39;m already wearing it.&quot; At this point Scott gave his pampers a pat for emphasis. &quot;However at this age I have no control so I don&#39;t feel the need to go until its already happening. But I don&#39;t really mind because it&#39;s like a pleasant surprise every time I use my diaper. I should also mention they&#39;re really comfy to wear, its like having a soft crinkly pillow for your butt.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex found himself nodding along in agreement, he could definitely see the agreement.<br />
<br />
&quot;But the really best part...&quot;<br />
<br />
The toddler then gestured for him to kneel down, which he did and whispered in his ear, &quot;...Are the diaper changes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They are?&quot; Alex asked incredulously.<br />
 <br />
&quot;When a person changes a baby&#39;s diaper it invokes a powerful intimate moment between the caretaker and the baby. I&#39;ve been through a few changes today and I can honestly say that getting my diaper changed is better than sex&quot; Scott said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Better than sex? No way!&quot; he challenged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh huh. Just imagine lying on a padded table wearing nothing but your used diaper. Your caretaker comes and removes the diaper leaving you naked from the waist down exposing your privates and butt to the world. She then tenderly and gently cleans from the waist down with wipes before applying some powder. Finally she puts a new diaper on you and while you&#39;re enjoying being clean, you also know that eventually you&#39;ll use this diaper too and have to get changed again resulting in a never ending cycle of change&quot; Scott finished explaining.<br />
<br />
Alex was stunned, &quot;Wow that&#39;s really something.&quot;<br />
<br />
For a moment there as he was listening to the toddler talk he had actually imagined he was a baby getting his diaper changed and was loving it.<br />
<br />
Scott nodded, &quot;So now you see why diapers are...&quot;<br />
<br />
The toddler paused as his face suddenly scrunched up. He then squatted down before letting out a muffled fart. Alex&#39;s eyes widened as he then watched as the back of Scott&#39;s diaper expand outward with a tell tale bulge. A smell then began to rise up and fill the air further confirming that the toddler had indeed pooped himself.<br />
<br />
 Before either of them could say anything a young woman in her twenties with long blonde hair walked up to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Scott there you are, I&#39;ve been looking all over for you. I told you not to wander off like that&quot; she chastised before picking the toddler up in her arms. She then sniffed the air and wrinkled her nose, &quot;Uh oh, smells like someone made poo poo in their diaper&quot; she said smiling knowingly at Scott.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did! I made a poo poo!&quot; Scott exclaimed in excitement as he kicked his legs.<br />
<br />
The woman then turned to looked at Alex, &quot;Oh hello there. Normally I&#39;d introduce myself but I gotta get this guy in a fresh diaper pronto. Anyway I hope you enjoy your stay and maybe I&#39;ll see you again soon. Who knows I might even be changing your diaper in the near future&quot; she winked before opening the door to their room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alex remember what I said. You should definitely give being a baby a try. I guarantee that you&#39;ll love wearing and using diapers again if you just give them a chance &quot; Scott called out just before the door closed leaving him alone in the hallway.<br />
<br />
As he pondered the toddler&#39;s words he pulled out his key card and opened the door to his room. Stepping inside he casually tossed his luggage on the floor before noticing a letter lying on top of the bed.<br />
<br />
Curious Alex picked it up and opened it up, reading the note inside.<br />
<br />
Dear Alex<br />
<br />
First of all, allow me to welcome you to the Transformation Resort. I hope this trip is worth it. Now I’m<br />
pretty aware that you have chosen the Age Wing of the resort. To that end let me give you some rules and<br />
advice.<br />
<br />
As you already know, this resort can transform their guests into anything and anyone they want. The Age Wing<br />
in particular can age or regress the guest into whatever age they want. But of course there are a couple of<br />
ways to do that. The room your in is one of them. It can help you change your age just by thinking about it.<br />
All you have to do is to picture the age you want to be and the room will do it for you. If you don’t want to<br />
change your age in your room, there are other things in the wing that can suit you better. All of our<br />
restaurants have a special ingredient on their food for appropriate ages, eat them and you will regress to<br />
that age. Our shopping center has different ways in changing your age. We got a pool and a spa for just<br />
regression, like a Fountain of Youth. And lastly we have some entertainment to help accommodate your age<br />
changes.<br />
<br />
Just a bit of a warning before you start. Age does have a limit from zero (newborn age) to a hundred. If you<br />
go past a hundred, you will instantly die from old age. If you go below ten-years-old a babysitter or a<br />
substitute mother will be assigned to the room to take care of you. Don’t worry if you regressed past newborn,<br />
you would be instantly inside the woman we would assign you with. But if you regressed past concievement, you<br />
will not die, only become just an egg and will need to wait to be reconcieve again. And for the clothing and<br />
other necessities in your luggage, don’t worry. When you change your age, you clothes will change to match<br />
that age.<br />
<br />
Once again, thank you for choosing the Transformation Resort and I hope you have yourself a safe and wonderful<br />
stay.<br />
<br />
From: The Chair of the Transformation Resort<br />

Alex put the now open letter down on the bed and recalled the conversation he had with Scott a few minutes ago. The toddler had really seemed eager to talk him into regressing and wearing diapers. And he would have probably continued to do so had his caretaker not pulled him away in order to change his dirty diaper.<br />
<br />
He remembered the way Scott seemed to squat down, bending his knees a little before he filled his diaper. Alex continued to reflect on the memory of recent messing, the sound of the muffled fart echoing loudly in his mind as he focused on the image of the back of the pampers bugling out suddenly from the size of the toddler&#39;s smelly load.<br />
<br />
Breaking out of the recollection Alex realized he was growing younger and continued to physically regress until he was...</p>
