<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Seeing the power of the flashlight has given you some ideas. Your first thought is to make some changes to yourself, or maybe play around with a little just for the hell of it, but the more you think about it, the more certain you become of where you want to start.<br />
<br />
Since you first started college you have been friends with Christina, your roommate ever since the first semester and unlike most college friendships it has continued going strong despite the two of you having been roommates for two years straight. Neither of you have any annoying habits that bother the other and you both manage to work around the few differences you have, or at least that was how it had been for most of your time together. This semester things have changed slightly though, especially during the past month. Christina started seeing a guy, Rodger, who you thought was a real creep, but you never said anything since you trusted her judgment. Now though you have started to have second thoughts about your decision not to intervene. Lately Christina has been dressing and acting differently, focusing more on pleasing Rodger than on being herself. The flashlight strikes you as just what you need to help her fix things without making it obvious that you are stepping in to help. With things the way they are now anything too obvious on your part might cause her to distance herself from you.<br />
<br />
You spend the bus ride back to the dorms formulating a plan and by the time you get back you have what you hope is a good one. It depends heavily on the reality adjusting powers of the light, which you hope you can use to adjust things for the better and give Christina her confidence back. You just hope that she will be there when you get to your dorm room since lately she has spent more time hanging out with Rodger than doing anything else, even going so far as missing classes because of him.<br />
<br />
Opening the door to the dorm building you let out a sigh of disgust, reminded of why you had planned to spend the day out at the mall in the first place. The air conditioning in the building broke late Thursday night and word is that maintenance won't be getting around to fix it until Tuesday at the soonest. It being only Saturday means that you and all the other students in the dorm will have a long, hot weekend.<br />
<br />
At the door to your room you can hear the soft hum of your window fan and nothing else and you let out another sigh. It seems that luck is not with you today. Lately Christina has been spending so much time with Rodger that she often doesn't return for days at a stretch, still you have a plan for when she returns, and you comfort yourself with that.<br />
<br />
When you open the door it takes your eyes a moment to adjust to the darkness of the room, but once you can see you realize that things are better than you ever could have hoped. Christina is in the room, she's just asleep and even better, because of the heat she has tossed all the blankets off the bed, which lets you see that she is totally naked.<br />
<br />
Your original plan slipping from your mind, you decide to take advantage of the opportunity presented to you.<br />
<br />
For a time you stare at her, feeling slightly guilty for ogling your best friend, but you reassure yourself that you are going to do thing to help her. Christina's hair is long and blond, and she is toned and fit, though lately she's been getting a little thinner, and slightly worried looking. The thought makes you frown as you recall how you once heard Rodger criticizing her weight, but doing it subtly to plant in her mind the idea that she was too fat. She wasn't though, and you know it had nothing to do with her weight or appearance, it was just that Rodger was the sort of guy who always had to make people feel bad. you can hardly understand what she saw in him, though you can easily tell what he saw in her. Her breasts are lovely, even you are willing to admit that, even though you have no interest in girls, a pleasantly round d-cup, you know that they are what most guys focus on when they look at her. You're tempted to set the light to a lower pink setting and shine it on her chest to shrink them, but you feel like doing that would be more out of jealously than desire to help her. Instead you decide to try a little experiment, just to see what will happen.<br />
<br />
Setting the light to its very lowest pink setting you shine it on her pussy, which you can see is clean shaven, something else that she probably did because of Rodger.<br />
<br />
The results are as startling as they are fascinating. Her petite nether lips grow flushed and part slightly, allowing you to see her clit, once hidden away by her soft folds. Under the power of the light it plumps up and grows, increasing in size until you can see its little tip, bright pink and about the size of a pencil eraser. <br />
<br />
Christina lets out a small sound and shifts in her sleep. Worried that she will wake up and see you staring at her, you turn off the light and take a step back, but her eyes remain closed as she brings a delicate hand between her legs and gently strokes herself. Under her attentions her pussy grows even more flushed and her clit perks up, actually growing erect. When her hand slides away and she falls back into a deeper sleep you can see that her clit is about an inch long erect, even possessing what could be considered a head, like that of a guy's cock. Yes, you realize, her clit looks almost like a miniature cock jutting out above her pussy lips.<br />
<br />
Amazed, you stare at the flashlight, realizing that the lowest setting of each color must bring a person to the most androgynous state of the selected gender possible. This opens up a new set of possibilities, but you're not sure how to go about pursuing any of them, instead you turn it to a slightly higher pink setting and shine it on her hair. In response her hair shrinks back into her scalp, going from long enough to reach the small of her back to just past shoulder length. This is because she had been talking about cutting her hair short because she thought it looked better that way. Once Rodger came into the picture she stopped talking about that since he had been very adamant about his preference for long hair.<br />
<br />
You look Christina over, trying to figure out how else to change things. What you have is a good start, and you don't want to push things too far with your first effort, but you don't think that what you have so far is anywhere near enough.<br />
<br />
In the end you decide to take a big chance and step in as close as you dare. Turning the light to its lowest blue setting you bring it down until it is almost touching her big, plump clit and turn it on, taking great care not to shine it on anything else.<br />
<br />
Her clit, already large, plumps up further and grows longer, its shape becoming more defined, the head becomes unmistakable above what could only be foreskin and the suggestion of a shaft becomes visible. The growth is less impressive, just half an inch or so, but the sum of the changes are shocking. Christina now has an undeniable penis, small, but fully formed and perfectly proportioned for its size.<br />
<br />
Shaking you turn off the light and step back. You cannot believe what you have done to your best friend, but with luck it will make her less attractive to Rodger and once they break up you can turn her back to the way she was and make her understand what a jerk he was to her.<br />
<br />
With that thought to reassure yourself you put the light away in your dresser, closing the drawer a little harder than you intended to because of how badly your hands are shaking.<br />
<br />
From her bed Christina lets out a loud yawn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; you stammer, not wanting to turn and look at her, afraid that somehow the power of the light will have failed and she will realize what you have done, &quot;I didn't mean to wake you up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's fine,&quot; she says softly, &quot;I've been wanting to talk to you anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;About what?&quot; you gulp, afraid of what she might say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rodger, me, us, I don't know,&quot; her voice chokes in a sob as she talks and you turn to look at her.<br />
<br />
She is sitting up on her bed, holding her breasts apart so she can look down at her clit-cock which has shrunk back down to a flaccid state so that its foreskin makes it look like nothing more that a particularly large, floppy clit.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's wrong?&quot; you try to keep your voice even, afraid that she knows, even though it is obvious that she does not, otherwise she would sound frightened rather than depressed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know how Rodger can be kind of...well, harsh with how he says things? Last night when we were at the party we were both kind of drunk and we off on our own to mess around a little. He wanted to have sex and I went along with him. We did it from the back and he said he liked it better that way because he didn't like it when 'that big thing was sticking out' and bumping against him,&quot; Christina takes a deep breath before continuing, &quot;Well, I was drunk too so I said some things that I shouldn't have and now he doesn't want to talk to me until I apologize to him.&quot;<br />
<br />
You try to hide your pleasure at your plan having worked so well, &quot;Don't apologize to him.&quot;<br />
<br />
She looks at you, her eyes wide with surprise, &quot;But what if he's right? That my clit is too big and ugly for any guy to like me. What if - &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop it,&quot; you cut her off, &quot;You're beautiful the way you are. Any guy who would focus on something as little as your clit isn't worth your time. I've been wanting to tell you for so long that Rodger was bad news and i feel like this is my fault.&quot;<br />
<br />
Christina stares at you so you continue, feeling good to finally get the chance to say something about her situation.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I had said something maybe it wouldn't have come to this, you know? I mean he never has anything nice to say about how you look, always telling you to dress differently or change how you do your hair. Then for him to say what he did, that's just too much. You're just fine the way you are,&quot; you finish, glad to have gotten all that off of your chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Christina says softly, smiling through her tears, &quot;I needed to hear that. And I guess I have some explaining to do too. I only started dating Rodger because I was embarrassed. I felt like I needed to date a guy or else. I was never attracted to Rodger though, and I guess I learned something from him. I don't think I even like guys to begin with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now it's your turn to stare. You feel like you should be surprised by her revelation, but you're not. All the little things she's done since you've known her add up now, the way she never minded being naked around you, instead almost going out of her way to make you notice, the little looks she gave to other girls, how she never talked about guys, even once she started dating Rodger.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's,&quot; you take a moment to figure out what to say, &quot;That's great!&quot;<br />
<br />
And it is too. You realize that with the flashlight you can get exactly what you've always dreamed of having, a 'boyfriend' who's also your beast friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; she gets up from her bed and gives you a big hug. <br />
<br />
Feeling her big breasts press against you, you smile.</p>
