<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The conversation kept flowing but Henry did not participate. He couldn’t. He had to play a mute girl. Alicia answered all the questions on “Rachel’s’ behalf. According to Alicia, Rachel was a personal assistant to the general manager of a small tech company. That was quite sensible of Alicia as it closely reflected her previous employment as Henry’s assistant. She was able to explain ‘Rachel’s’ day to day tasks. <br />
<br />
However Henry had to object when Alicia answered another question on behalf of her sister. Alex had just told his friends how Alicia’s husband had left the country for a few days on business and how Rachel had come to join her sister on Alicia’s honeymoon. Terry asked “And what about you Rachel? Do you have a man back home or are you single?”<br />
<br />
To Henry’s dismay Alicia answered “Rachel doesn’t have a man”<br />
<br />
Henry almost choked on his drink. He made the silly throat noise Alicia had objected to earlier and shook his head. Began pointing at himself and at his ring finger.<br />
<br />
Alicia replied. “Perhaps I was wrong. Clearly Rachel she is saying she does have a man. And by the sounds of it she is serious about him, if she’s pointing at ring fingers. I have yet to meet him so I must say my curiosity is aroused. Can you describe him Rachel?”<br />
<br />
Unbelievably it was Alex who came to Henry’s rescue “Let’s not put Rachel through a charades test. Clearly she does have a friend back home. But she’s here in Hawaii this week and whoever her beau is he is a long way away. Who’s ready for another drink?”<br />
<br />
Alicia suggested she would like a Pina Colada and Henry just nodded as if to say that will do. Alex left to buy the round of drinks. Henry rolled his eyes towards the rest rooms trying to indicate that he wanted to talk to Alicia. She got the hint “Excuse us gentlemen. We need to powder our noses” <br />
<br />
Henry followed Alicia into the ladies. After checking they were alone. He whispered “What are you doing? You are leading them on”<br />
<br />
“No I’m not. I made it clear to Alex earlier that I am not obtainable and you just made it clear that you are not either”<br />
<br />
‘Of course I did! What made you say I was single?”<br />
<br />
“Just having fun. Your reaction was quite amusing”<br />
<br />
“I’m not amused. Then you went and agreed to dinner with them after the golf. We don’t know these people. They seem to me to be playboys who prey on holidaying women”<br />
<br />
“They are just men who enjoy the company of beautiful women. They get their thrills by just being seen with us. Remember we are unobtainable goddesses” Henry could relate to that.<br />
<br />
“Unobtainable?”<br />
<br />
“Yes unobtainable. While we are here let me fix your make-up. You should have touched up your blush”<br />
<br />
Alicia quickly went to work on Henry’s face then her own. As she did so she complimented him on how good he looked and how well his entrance had come off. “You had the whole bars eyes on you as you came in and you walked in those heels like a veteran. You looked very elegant. I was proud of you”<br />
<br />
Henry took the opportunity to use a stall and have a pee. He hitched up the skirt and peed standing up. The only problem was tucking Mister Marvelous back in once he was finished. As soon as he had stopped peeing the penis started to swell. Whether it was his nail clad hands or the effect of wearing the leather skirt and pantyhose, Henry wasn’t sure. However the problem was only getting worse.<br />
<br />
“Well I can’t help you with that now” said Alicia when he explained his problem. I’m going back to our puppies. You deal with it however you have to” She left the ladies.<br />
<br />
Henry felt like he was going to snap his penis off as he tried to bend it backwards underneath his crotch. It would just not go. He ended up returning to a stall and masturbating. That worked quite quickly but then he had a mess to clean up. Fortunately, he had caught all his gunk in toilet paper. Then he had to dispose of that and wash Mister Marvellous. He needed a trip to the sink to wet some tissue paper in order to wipe himself, hoping no one else would enter the toilet. He then sprayed himself and the cubical he had been using with the Chanel No. 5 in an attempt to mask the smell. <br />
<br />
That completed he had no trouble tucking the now limp penis away and after one last check in the mirror and another dash of perfume just to make sure, he left.<br />
<br />
All eyes turned to Henry once more as he walked back to his seat. He wondered what excuse Alicia had given the others for why Rachel had been so long. Certainly they appeared to looking at him with sympathetic eyes. He felt himself blushing and growing weak at the knees, he even toyed with not returning to the seat, just turning around and walking back to their suite. But Alicia was looking at him with a bright smile on her face. Henry gave that same smile back, remembering once more that he was an unobtainable Goddess, so he thrust his breasts out, held his head proudly upright, gave a wiggle of his hips and tried to walk as elegantly as he could back to his seat. <br />
<br />
They stayed at least another hour. Henry was given another cocktail this time a ‘Lava flow’ courtesy of Richard who insisted it was his shout. Henry played the mute girl the whole time. Just smiling and nodding his pretty head. Terry was actually quite amusing, telling stories of the some of the people he did business with. He ran his own engineering business. Henry actually liked him and in other circumstance could imagine developing some sort of friendship. He didn’t fit in with the macho playboy image given off by Alex and Richard who it turned out was the professional at the club they were going to visit tomorrow. <br />
<br />
Eventually when Alicia had finished her ‘Lava flow’ she stood up and explained that “Rachel is in need of her meds. We’ll have to get going. Thanks for the lovely evening” The men all stood up and initiated by Alicia there was a round of hugs and kisses. Henry was caught up on it and found himself been squeezed and receiving whiskery kisses from all three of the men. <br />
<br />
Terry told Henry “Lovely to meet you” while the others said “See you tomorrow” and “Till lunchtime”<br />
<br />
Before they had left the room, Henry stumbled in his heels, Luckily Alicia caught him and stopped a fall. The men rushed to Henry and asked “Are you all right?” Henry could only smile and nod while Alicia said “Just a little tipsy”. Henry had to admit that was most likely the case.</p>
