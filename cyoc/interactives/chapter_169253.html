<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenkins pretended to act like any other dumb cow as he dully chewed some grass from one of the feeding troughs. He did his best to convince the armed security forces that he was an oblivious animal as he looked around and listened carefully. <br />
<br />
The guards were calling his name and Carter’s as they searched around the building. Jenkins couldn’t help but find it amusing that the farm manager was mere feet away, busy being fucked again by the giant black bull. But then he remembered the incident in the store room. What if the female farmhand could still speak, or had left them some kind of message? <br />
<br />
Jenkins watched the store room door nervously as the security forces piled inside. After a few moments he was relieved to hear a series of angry bellows, before a distressed dairy cow emerged from the room. The angry cow was herded into an empty stall before most of the guards started to march out.<br />
<br />
Then, one individual who looked like they were in charge picked up her radio. “Command this is Security Team Alpha, no sign of Jenkins, Carter or female employee. Multiple bovines in facility and three sets of destroyed clothing. Impossible to identify who is who. Jenkins may have destroyed clothes to mislead us. Over.”<br />
<br />
Jenkins couldn’t hear the reply, but it looked as though he had fooled them for the time being as most of the guards filed out of the building, only leaving a few behind to secure the area.<br />
<br />
With most of the guards gone, some more farmhands arrived to deal with the cows inside the barn.<br />
<br />
“Hurry guys” one said “the truck’s already here. We need all of these females on board.” <br />
<br />
With that, three farmhands approached with ropes in their hands. Jenkins was amused as she watched the farmhands struggling with the two other cows. Carter was desperate to remain with her mate as she bellowed out in protest, while the female farmhand-turned-cow was still clearly angry about her transformation as she stomped and kicked in frustration. Meanwhile Jenkins was on his best behaviour in an effort to gain their affections.<br />
<br />
“Quick guys… get those two under control.”<br />
<br />
 The farmhands battled with the two stubborn cows, struggling to get them under control. Carter did eventually succumb, clearly tired from her transformation and rigorous matings. As for the formerly female farmhand, she was simply refusing to cooperate. <br />
<br />
After a few minutes of struggling with the stubborn cow, the farm worker eventually gave up. “She needs a bull I reckon,” the young worker panted out in between breaths, “my guess is that this is that bastard doctor. She sure acts like she isn’t happy with her new body.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah you’re probably right” another farmhand replied “in that case we’ll find her a fresh bull once these two are sorted out.”<br />
<br />
“What about this one?” Jenkins’ heart skipped a beat as the farmhand pointed directly at her. “Can you tell if this one’s been mated?”<br />
<br />
“We don’t have time for this” came the stern reply. “It’s standard procedure that all transformations are locked in immediately. If she was mated hours ago then there probably won’t be a trace by now. Besides, she’s acting far too docile for a cow in heat. She’s a good girl, aren’t you?” Jenkins mood as cutely as possible as he licked the worker’s hand. It was all part of the act; and it seemed to be working surprisingly well.<br />
<br />
“Right then,” the worker in charge continued, “let’s get these two loaded up.”<br />
<br />
With that Carter allowed herself to be led, with Jenkins obediently following close behind her. Jenkins couldn’t help looking at Carter’s cum-stained vagina as she plodded along in front of her. The bull’s semen looked and smelt fresh as it oozed out of her bovine pussy. For a second the sight triggered something in Jenkins’ mind as he imagined what it would feel like to be filled with that much cum. But Jenkins knew he had to snap out of it. He looked away, hoping that thinking about bulls wasn’t enough to make him lose his mind. Sadly only time would tell.<br />
<br />
The two cows trudged out of the barn and towards where the lorry was parked. Before long the truck came into view. It was a large truck with a tall two-story trailer. Jenkins reckoned it could fit at least 50 cattle inside. <br />
<br />
Seeing the cows milling around inside the holding pen as they waited to be loaded up made Jenkins feel a little uneasy, especially since he knew that they had all once been human. There were a range of emotions on display: anger, fear, grief, acceptance, tiredness… the list was long and depressing. Remembering what the farmhand had said about the Farm’s ‘standard procedure,’ Jenkins suspected that all of these people had been locked into their new forms permanently. In fact, the musky scent of bull hung heavy in the air as they neared the pen, suggesting that Carter wasn’t the only one to have been mated recently.<br />
<br />
Upon arriving at the holding pen, the gate was opened just enough to allow Carter and Jenkins to squeeze through. After that things got very claustrophobic and chaotic as the cows were pressed together in the restrictive space. Hearing the bellows of the more outspoken cows made Jenkins feel uneasy, but he decided to keep his head down and not draw attention to himself.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes things did eventually become more bearable as more cows were loaded aboard the truck. Jenkins looked up and spotted Carter as she submissively walked up the ramp and into position. Jenkins didn’t follow far behind as he ended up a few rows back from the former farm manager. Again Jenkins noted how ironic it was that Carter had doomed all of these people and was now sharing their fate.<br />
<br />
With all of the cows finally on board, the trailer’s heavy door closed and the truck began to move. Jenkins looked around to study the cows around him. He could see another freshly-mated one to his front with her head hung low, while another one next to him was mooing out in defiance. However, most of the cows looked defeated, clearly having accepted that this was their new role in life.<br />
<br />
The journey didn’t last long, but Jenkins was grateful when it was over. The trailer stunk of cow and bull, and the more vocal passengers had been letting out piercing bellows of fear and despair for the whole trip, clearly not willing to accept that they were now animals.<br />
<br />
Mercifully the ramp to the trailer did eventually open. A pair of farmhands clambered into the trailer in order to usher the first cattle out. The cows obeyed for the most part as they moved from the trailer to another holding pen. When it was his turn Jenkins followed the others down the ramp and into the enclosure.<br />
<br />
The conditions inside the pen weren’t much better than inside the trailer, save for the fact that it was out in the fresh air. Jenkins strained to get a good look at this new location. He quickly deduced that it was a large dairy farm, but it wasn’t a place that he recognised.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless Jenkins was pleased with himself. Phase 2 was complete and everything so far was going according to plan. However, what followed was the hard part: surviving for a week as a dairy cow without being mated. Phase 3 had begun…</p>
