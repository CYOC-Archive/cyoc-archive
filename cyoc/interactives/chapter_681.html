<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sean manages to get the two now wimpish looking guys to their car, he's surprised at how different these two former studs look without there muscular physics,
<br>
 poor mark now weighs only 90Lbs and where his torso still shirtless looked so well toned only a couple of hours ago was now a skeleton skinny chest with bone
<br>
 thin arms and two quarter sized nipples showing on top of his now visible rib cage, he was trying to hold up his baggy jeans that once clung tightly to his once fine
<br>
 athletic ass and legs the fabric now sympathetically hid his now flat ass and thin weak legs. 
<br>

<br>
 Jays own body looked even stranger he was now less than 80Lbs and a short5'2&quot; high, his body was muscles and his or should I say Sean's jeans looked
<br>
 ridiculous on his tiny frame, the waist line of his jeans he was trying to hold up came up to his once proud chest, he was a pathetic looking skinny little wimp now
<br>
 and he knew it &quot;What happened to me Sean I'm a little wimp!&quot; he said as he tried to walk in his now over sized shoes, the excess fabric from his jeans was all
<br>
 bunched up below his sagging crotch area that was now between his bonny knobby knees. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Just get in the car Jay your causing people to stair at us&quot; Sean said as he opened the door for the little guys, and pushed the guys in the back seat, Mark was
<br>
 begging to realize what had happened as well and was also freaking out bad &quot;what happened to us were skinny as hell!&quot; Mark said looking at his thin forearm ,wrist
<br>
 and now bony hand, his football ring he got for scoring the most yards passed in a season was slipping all the way to the palm of his now thin finger. Sean quickly
<br>
 pressed in a sleep order and fired at the guys, they fell into a deep sleep and Sean took them home, when he got there he found it easy to pick the thin guys up and
<br>
 carry them to Jays bed, when he had both guys laying next to each other he stood back and stair at them the waist of there jeans was laying flat around there now
<br>
 tiny waist, the elastic of there underwear not even hugging there thighs. Their chest were strait up and down with no sign of their once broad chests and v shaped
<br>
 backs showing. 
<br>

<br>
 Sean thought that they both looked younger almost boyish except for the hair on there chest and faces they would now pass for kids, Sean started to laugh out loud
<br>
 &quot;Man wouldn't it be cool if these two woke up and thought they'd gotten younger as well!&quot; Sean went to Dan's room and got the bottle of epilady hair remover that
<br>
 Dan's girl friend had left and went back to see the soon to be boys room. Sean removed all there adult hair from there legs to there faces, and gave poor Mark a
<br>
 little kids hair cut, Sean looked at their dicks now hairless balls and penis area and thought that they were still to well endowed even though there cocks had kept
<br>
 up with there proportions they were to big so he programmed in 9 year old cocks and hit them with the ray there dicks regressed in size and length so much that
<br>
 they even looked puny on there now smaller bodies, Sean laughed and dressed them back in there now over sized clothes, he left there shirts off so the first thing
<br>
 they'd see was there now hairless chest. 
<br>

<br>
 Sean turned off the lights and closed Jays door, as he was walking into the hall that led to the living room he herd the TV playing, 'shit Dan's home Dan was the
<br>
 all-star athlete of there place he was handsomer than even Mark to Sean his body was toned though diligent workouts and his more mature facial features his
<br>
 angular strong jaw unimposing nose and deep blue intelligent looking eyes made the 6'3 220Lbs guy a babe magnet, he was also very intelligent he was near genius
<br>
 with a 134PNT IQ all this just made Sean all the more jealous of him. Dan didn't particularly care for Sean he thought he was gay and he hated gay guys in the
<br>
 worst way, he once even kicked Sean's ass for just seeing him nude as Dan ran for his room to get a towel, he accused Sean for taking it while he was showering
<br>
 so that Sean could snatch a look at him, Sean hadn't Dan just forgot to bring one to the shower with him. &quot;Well its payback time now&quot; Sean thought as he
<br>
 programmed his new toy for Dan 'lets see we'll take some of those IQ points away and of coarse his perfect body and some of his years as well. Sean
<br>
 programmed -50% IQ/45% muscle mass/35% age/penis age 12. He hit save and came into the room. &quot;Oh hey queer, its you I thought maybe Jay was still up?&quot;
<br>
 Dan said with a shitty smile &quot;no he's sleeping off a major drunk&quot; Sean said as he aimed at Dan's bare chest and hit him between his enormous pecs, &quot;WHAT THE
<br>
 FUCK WAS THAT YOU ASSHOLE&quot; Dan said rubbing his chest, &quot;YOU BETTER HAVE AN ANSWER FAG OR IM KICKING YOUR SHIT FOR
<br>
 BRAINS ASS&quot; Dan said getting up and still rubbing his broad chest with his powerful arm, Sean was staring at his 22inch biceps as Dan stood there &quot;well actually
<br>
 its you that has shit for brains Dan, or at least you will soon.&quot; Sean said as he backed away from the still monsterous Dan, hoping that it would start to work soon
<br>
 otherwise he was as good as dead. 
<br>

<br>
 Sean noticed it had started Dan's prominent pecs were getting smaller and soon his biceps and forearms followed Dan was still oblivious to it though and started to
<br>
 move toward Sean, as he walked though his tight 36/36 jeans were begging to ride down his narrowing thighs exposing his underwear's elastic band, Dan began to
<br>
 notice that he was feeling weaker and looked at his arms and then down to his jeans that were now looser and threatening to fall around his thinning legs &quot;WHAT
<br>
 THE HELL DID YOU DO TO ME! IM Going to kill youuu..??&quot; Dan voice cracked up a notch from its normal baritone and almost sounded childlike. &quot;What'd ya
<br>
 do ta my voice asshowle! Dan was begging to panic his biceps were down to 14inchs and he had to hold up his jeans now, as he stood there frozen in confusion
<br>
 and ultimately in his now less intelligent mind, fear! &quot;Looks like things have changed a bit haven't they Danny boy.&quot; Sean said in a confident tone. Dan couldn't
<br>
 believe this he was quite literally getting smaller and skinnier by the second. &quot;Help me Swan I dwid nowt mwean anwy twing erwer pwease mwake itwa stwop&quot;
<br>
 Dan said as he watched his well-built body fade away. &quot;Hey Dan what's 10x10? If you can answer that Ill return you to your old asshole self!&quot; Sean said knowing
<br>
 that Dan was now a mental midget and not the valedictorian he graduated as from high school. &quot;Ahh II kwnow dis I dwo itws swimplae itws 14 tween! Wight.&quot;
<br>
 Dan said with a stupid grin on his now thin face, a face that Sean had watched getting younger as he lost more weight &quot;NO STUPID ITS ONE HUNDRED
<br>
 MORON!&quot; Sean yelled at the now frightened younger man. &quot;Pwease chwange mwe bwack Swaen mwe no wanna bwe dwum mwe smwart anwd bwig gwuy
<br>
 pwease pwettiy pwease!!!&quot; Dan said standing there holding up his now huge jeans crying uncontrollably, deep in Dan's now diminished mind he knew he was a
<br>
 smart handsome jock, but somehow Sean had changed all that...</p>
