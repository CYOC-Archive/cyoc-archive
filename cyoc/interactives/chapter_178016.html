<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Forty minutes later, in which his newer pets had swapped places every ten minutes, giving all of them a chance to suck Conner off, while Tony and Alex had remained at Conner´s feet the whole time, they all heard a car door close outside.<br />
<br />
“Stay aside and wait.” Conner said, pointing over towards Tony´s bed. In a tumble of bodies, all six hopped on it, eager to follow the order, but also happy to finally get away from Conner. Conner himself turned towards the computer and scanned. Finding only Daniel´s profile had joined the list, he started to work on his changes, quickly assembling them.<br />
<br />
Daniel had no idea what was to happen as he opened his front door and stepped inside. “I´m home” he announced to the house, sure that his children had heard him. No answer came back, but a quick glance down showed him seven pairs of shoes at the stairs. Thinking that maybe the are all occupied with their friends right now, Daniel moved and sat on the couch, starting to remove his shoes and socks. It was an old habit of him to walk around the house barefoot or in slippers.<br />
<br />
When he finally heard steps, he looked towards the stairs, only to stop short. Conner, Tony´s friend, came down naked, grinning like mad. Before he could ask, he noticed something moving behind him. He watched in shock as six other naked boys followed Conner, each more crawling then walking behind him. But the shock was about that he recognized the faces of his four sons between them. <br />
<br />
“What are you doing?” he asked silently, to shocked to scream at them. There was a rule in this house to not run around naked, after all. But while his sons, and he also recognized the Thompson brothers between them, remained silent, Conner answered him, still grinning. “Oh, nothing. I´m just to collect my last pet.”<br />
<br />
Not understanding what Conner meant, Daniel watched his sons more closely. He noticed the blond, floppy ears on Tony´s head, and there were clearly bunny ears on Michael´s head. Looking even more closely, there were cat ears hidden in Alex´s hair, mouse one´s in Oli´s, similar looking one´s in brown in Kyle´s hair. Only his son Yanis looked more normal, only darker skinned. <br />
<br />
Then there was the fact that each of them had hair tufts the same color as the rest on their chests, joints and hands, as far as he could see. Beside that Oli´s normal black hair was grey and Yanis´s blond hair was a near black brown now.<br />
<br />
“Stand up and come over, Daniel, so I can see you become my pet.” Conner said while Daniel was still distracted. He had made the same adjustment to him as the rest, meaning Daniel couldn´t move much and was to follow his orders.<br />
<br />
As Daniel was to scold Conner for calling him by his first name, he stopped short as his body did as ordered. “Why did I do that?” he asked now extremely confused. He stopped just a bit before Conner, who still grinned at him. But his answer was weird to Daniel: “Such an obedient pet, good.”<br />
<br />
Just as Daniel wanted to ask, a shudder went through his whole body. With wide eyes he watched Conner grow, and it took him slipping into his shirt´s collar to realize that, no, he was shrinking instead. He had no idea that he was also rapidly regressing younger, getting down from being forty-six to being eleven like the others. He remained more than a head bigger than Tony, Yanis and Kyle, if they all stood straight. Sudden movement was heard, and then his shirt was removed by Conner, and his other clothes on the ground were removed from his feet as well.<br />
<br />
Looking shocked and embarrassed at standing naked in front of all the others, he missed tufts of fur grow out his chest, around his groin, on his elbows and knees, and on his back. Said hair was nearly white, the same color his normally black hair had become while it had grown longer. His ears went up, getting more pointy tips. His hands suddenly felt cramped, and as he watched in horror his fingers shortened, as he made a fist, unable to open it again. His feet followed that example, getting shorter and rounder. His fingernails grew bigger, nearly connecting to each other, forming a semi-circle on his hands. Something similar happened at his feet, only it wasn´t forming from the nails but around his ankles.<br />
<br />
Not understanding it, his thoughts were interrupted as his cock grew erect, making him blush even more. A sudden horniness built up, and he felt like he would need release just now. And just as he looked at it, his cock and balls vanished into thin air, making him gasp. But his need stayed, got even worse by his suddenly filling bladder, ready to burst.<br />
<br />
“Nearly ready” said Conner as he moved towards Daniel, how tried and failed to move backwards, away form him. And then the butt-plug with white, long and loose hairs was pushed into Daniel´s ass, making him yell loudly. The yell was far to high for Daniel´s normal voice, he realized shocked. He toppled over as his limbs had become weaker unbeknownst to him, face-planting before his kids and their friends.<br />
<br />
“What have you done to me?” Daniel got out with his little, young voice. Conner soon stroked his longer hair soothingly. “No worries, my little foal. All is good now. You fit in right with your fellow pets now.”<br />
<br />
Daniel soon joined the others in Tony´s room and had a chance to see himself in the mirror. He resembled a human horse foal. He looked no older than his sons and their friends beside Conner himself. And to his great shock and horror he sucked Conner of while he worked with the computer.<br />
<br />
When Conner finished his work at the chronivac, having already cummed twice into Daniel´s mouth, he explained to them grinning wide. “Now nobody will notice you missing, and if someone else sees you, they will think nothing of it. I altered reality so all seven off you are my pets and nothing else. You will all live here, as this house is now mine, with me. As much as I love my family, I will visit them, but I always wanted to be independent. I will enjoy having my loyal pets around the whole time, as I won´t need to go to school anymore.” Then Conner laughed at their shocked faces. <br />
<br />
Each of his pets got one day he was the one sucking Conner off, while the others would play with each other or do other things with Conner. They all were doomed to be just Conner´s pets.</p>
