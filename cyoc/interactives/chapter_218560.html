<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alexa absolutely hated her transformation.<br />
<br />
It was said that all negative transformations made by the Fusion Wave were like double-edged swords.  That they all had their benefits.  <br />
<br />
About every fusion and transformation made by the &quot;Fusion Wave,&quot; or rather, the &quot;Transformation Wave&quot; - the event was coined by the press as the &quot;Fusion Wave&quot; since 8 famous, large cities around the world that major newspapers and news networks were based in had a much higher amount of fusions than any other type of transformation (and because &quot;Fusion Wave&quot; was much smoother to say) - was supposed to have a beneficial side, no matter how outwardly detrimental it seemed, according to the press.  And they were mostly right.<br />
<br />
People who lost their arms gained extreme dexterity with their legs.  People conjoined to their worst enemies soon turned into friends, or lovers, with them.  Completely fused individuals enjoyed a new lifestyle with the personalities, minds, and ways of thought of multiple individuals.  Buff jocks turned into supermodels and supermodels turned into buff jocks saw life from another angle and made the most of it, with newfound respects for members of opposite genders.  The same could be said for body-swapped or head-swapped or mentally-swapped individuals or conjoinments or fusions or just plainly race-swapped individuals who gained newfound understanding and respect for other ethnicities.  Swapped individuals typically enjoyed their new lives and made friends with the families of the people they had swapped with. <br />
Hell, people with severe transformations who lost all of their limbs or their ability to see or talk typically gained an incredible amount of intellect as well as newfound abilities.  <br />
Headlines had been made for a girl, originally a star volleyball athlete heading for the Olympics, who had become a limbless SWB (head and neck attached directly to hips and butt - minus a torso, legs, and arms).  When it was discovered that she had gained the ability to fluently and flawlessly speak and understand 67 different languages, she was hired, in a week, as a new United Nations interpreter, incredibly useful for such a stressful time humanity was undergoing.<br />
An even larger headline was made when it was discovered that famed singer Harry Styles had been the victim of a debilitating compound transformation.  He was caught in the street when the Fusion Wave hit, and was a victim of a head swap (just the head, no neck) with a 40-year old black English woman, and as a result, had gained her voice, and she had gained his.  Despite not being a fan of him or his music, the woman, named Angela, had guided him to safety to her house, where they took cover for the next 3 weeks, until the unrest died down.  During the time, multiple other transformations had befallen Harry Styles.  When he woke up the day after the Fusion Wave, though he retained his facial hair, his face feminized.  In the evening of that day, while eating dinner, his tongue transformed into a large fully-functioning penis (minus the testicles).  When he woke up the day after that, in tears, he found that his new breasts had wrinkled-over and grown hair, replaced by two large testicles.  The singer, distraught, was comforted by Angela for the next two weeks as he learned how to navigate his new, mostly female body, talk with his strange new tongue, and satisfy any urges.  When the unrest ended, and Styles untransformed girlfriend found out about his transformation, she ended their relationship - leading him, now even more distraught and furious, to write a series of angry new songs.  Angela, who now had his voice, agreed to try and sing the new songs as Styles provided music and vocals with his new voice.  Upon release, they were a smash hit - these songs on transformation inspired many to continue on and adapt to their new lives, persevering in the face of adversity.  Angela was invited by the rest of the members of One Direction to join them, who also transformed, and Harry was wholeheartedly accepted.  (There are rumors that Angela and Harry are romantically involved now.)<br />
<br />
Alexa could say that this was true for her family, that had all been transformed by the Fusion Wave - <br />
Her father had completely fused, mentally and physically with her younger sister into an androgynous, hermaphrodite young adult with an entirely new identity, and her mother had fused with her best and only friend into a two-headed, four breasted, armless short-torso shemale humantaur (a centaur but with human parts instead of those of a horse - look it up) that instead had hands attached to their legs, which had become as dexterous as those of a professional gymnast.<br />
(Note: A short torso humantaur has a lower attached body that does not contain an upper torso, simply the stomach area and legs only)<br />
Of course, her parent&#39;s sex life had been destroyed - their plans for a new baby boy had been canned, and Alexa missed her dad and sister.  It was also incredibly odd to see her best friend all of the time, and even more strange to see her friend&#39;s family all of the time. Since they lived nearby, they came to visit her friend often.  Due to her friend&#39;s choice, they had allowed for Alexa&#39;s mom to remain with Alexa, and as such, she had to remain away from her family.<br />
However, there were many benefits.  Her new sibling, the fusion between her father and her sister, was a hilarious, hard working and intelligent person who tried to get to know Alexa, her mother, and her friend better.  They took over Alexa&#39;s father&#39;s job after the unrest died down and got a new, unique identity.  As for her mother and her friend, their fusion had forced Alexa&#39;s mother to see things from a teenager&#39;s angle, getting a better grip on technology, and to go easier on her studious daughter, who she understood more.  When school started again, it felt awkward for Alexa going to school with her mother in tow, but most of the students in her high school had been transformed, and were self-conscious of their own transformations, so they understood and helped them along.  Alexa&#39;s mom grew into an instant celebrity - she had to quit her job as a business consultant after the Fusion Wave, but was capable of providing great business advice.  With it, Alexa&#39;s friend and her &quot;company&quot; in their Entrepreneurship class rose to prominence and became the best that the school had ever seen.  They absolutely killed it at a mock conference the class went to.<br />
<br />
Considering everything, Alexa had thought about and considered all the benefits of her, rather simple, transformation.  The Fusion Wave had altered her body to give her everything she would have killed for in the past.  And she was thankful and happy for those changes.<br />
<br />
But with a quick and quiet toot as she lay on her bed that Saturday afternoon, thinking about all of this, Alexa again dismissed her thoughts with a sigh.  She still hated her transformation.  No benefit could beat or outweigh the single, stupid deficit the Fusion Wave had given her.<br />
