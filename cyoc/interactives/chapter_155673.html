<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&#9642;Week 17<br />
<br />
My beautiful blond hair was gone, fell completely, leaving only  black fur occupying the place where it was. Another fact is that this week my tail has reached its final size, stopping growing at 4 feet in length.<br />
<br />
This Monday we went to a kind of camp, which was only frequented by people entering the advanced stage of animalization. We ageed to meet in Lara&#39;s place before we go to the bus. When we got there, Lara&#39;s father asked us to come in and wait in the living room. I could see why we had to wait,  Lara&#39;s mother was milking her. I know I shouldn&#39;t, but it bothered me a little, I wish it was me milking Lara. When it was over Lara came to us and we left to catch the bus.<br />
<br />
We met Jack on the bus, I noticed that his cock was much smaller and that his testicles were clearly no longer in his sac. I also realized that, although small, he had breasts, eight of them. He realized that I was looking and was embarrassed. I&#39;m sure if it wasn&#39;t for the fur his face would be red with embarrassment.<br />
<br />
Bruce already had his arm almost covered in hair and his breasts were even smaller. There was a kind of funny situation that happened several times this week as we forgot to treat Bruce as a male and called him Chris or himself forgetting that he was no longer a girl.<br />
<br />
At the camp there were cabins with rooms for four people, we managed to convince the organizers to leave me, Lara, Bruce and Jack in the same room.<br />
<br />
Throughout the week we had sex with Bruce several times, Bruce needed a lot of energy for that, as at the moment he was the only one with a fully functional penis. With Jack it was always anal.<br />
<br />
&#9642;Week 18<br />
<br />
It was a week that my transformation took an unexpected turn for me. First with my teeth that began to adjust to my new face. But the most important happened Wednesday, I had already realized that I was no longer feeling pleasure when Bruce fucked me, but I thought it was because I grew too big and his cock was too small to satisfy me, after all I was huge standing 10 feet tall and weighing 400kg. But when my period did not come, I thought I might be pregnant, but the doctor on duty informed me that I was beginning to go through the &quot;sex change&quot; and becoming male too!<br />
<br />
Later, when reporting this fact to others, Lara began to worry if she would change sex as well and went to the doctor, who said she was not at risk, because if this were to happen she would not have developed udders, which were already huge and had stopped growing.<br />
<br />
As for Bruce, his upper body was already covered with hair, and his cock began to lose its human shape.<br />
<br />
&#9642;Week 19<br />
<br />
Last week of camp. My vagina is closing and my clit is growing, starting to become my dick.<br />
<br />
Bruce&#39;s breasts have also completely disappeared, and with that, only those who know him long ago know that he was once a woman. He is also showing a special interest in Jack, who now has clearly formed breasts, his dick no longer exists and his vagina has already formed, so we started treating him like a girl and now calling her Jen.<br />
<br />
Lara already has almost her entire body covered with fur. If it wasn&#39;t for her horns, I&#39;d say the head was the only part of her body still intact.<br />
<br />
&#9642;Week 20<br />
<br />
We left the camp. Lara is still living with her parents. Bruce continues with his own apartament, but he has assumed a relationship with Jen and they are living together now. Only I had no choice and had to move, I stopped growing at 10 and a half feet tall and weighing half a ton, not only had it gotten too big for the house, but my weight was damaging the floor outside the stairs almost collapsed with me over it.<br />
<br />
My breasts are also shrinking, my clitoris is already a penis, and my vagina no longer exists. <br />
<br />
I began to have less contact with Bruce and Jen, who have started dating since joining.<br />
<br />
Sunday morning someone came to me at my new home. It was Lara, and she was crying. When I asked what the problem was, she said she argued with her mom, because she was getting fat and her mom didn&#39;t even care about that, just said cows were really fat.<br />
<br />
I comforted her, with our height difference she was face to face with my dick, so I lifted her and hugged her like a child. While I was holding her, at the worst possible time, I had my first erection, and Lara noticed. She, already calmer, found it funny that I showed such interest in her, and then I fucked her.<br />
<br />
After we had sex while lying on the floor, she told me she was a little lonely, with her two best friends becoming males and one of them spending all the time with his new girlfriend. Then she asked me if I would accept to be her boyfriend.<br />
<br />
When she said that I remembered not liking it before I saw Lara being milked by her mother, and I realized that it was jealous, and I was liking Lara. So I agreed to be her boyfriend and asked her to call me Joey from this moment on.</p>
