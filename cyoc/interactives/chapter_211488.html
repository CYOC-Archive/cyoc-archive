<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The run in with the superintendent that ran the apartment complex across the street from their home had left Dakota and Harper with many questions, partially because there were things that were brought up that they didn&#39;t have immediate answers for, and things that they knew presented some of the potential issues that many did worry about regarding Animalia. Harper had known there were mild concerns over the size and strength of Animalians, particularly when reports indicated that their average libido was higher than Humans, but he&#39;d also known that for the most part that Animalians generally didn&#39;t lose control over themselves because of this.<br />
<br />
However, other reports lead to the various worries that the superintendent had noticed. One came with the revelation from when Heather Wilcox first became a Dinotopian that a Human could be overwhelmed by animal instinct at first, and then came some other revelations that followed. One came with the theory that there cases where those who were elderly became Animalians to get their youth back might have their libido supercharged, even for an Animalian, and that the same could happen with those that had had some major traumatic events in their past. It showed that regardless of the physical healing the Animalia Virus could achieve, it could NOT heal any and all mental wounds or issues and this created the worries over Regressive Hypersexuality Syndrome, that someone would convert, gain it, and then lose control over themselves as a result.<br />
<br />
The other worry came more from the fact that it was found that those who were homosexual before becoming Animalians often became bisexual after becoming Animalians. On its own, this wasn&#39;t a big thing, and Dakota and Harper both understood that, but Harper was well aware on how this news had been used to try and use conversion as a means to &quot;cure&quot; homosexuality. This in turn created resistance and raised further worries among those who had already converted as to whether or not these new instincts would hurt them or hurt the way in which they loved. Harper understood a lot of that after becoming a hermaphrodite Dakotaraptor Dinotopian, as hir relationship with Dakota would then potentially fall into that category. Shi didn&#39;t like that all these sorts of outside pressures were there, but shi couldn&#39;t avoid having to deal with them and the potential for stresses that were there.<br />
<br />
And the apartment building&#39;s superintendent did seem to fit into the category of someone who likely wasn&#39;t all too interested in those things. However, he had been polite enough and seemed concerned enough to ask questions about possible help for those that had moved into the apartment building. Dakota and Harper didn&#39;t know who the ones who moved in were and hadn&#39;t devoted any time to worrying about those things, but the super had apparently found enough that made him worry about some things regarding what these Dinotopians, or soon to be Dinotopians were dealing with. Without any other information, about all Dakota and Harper knew was that the best help was therapy, particularly for those dealing Regressive Hypersexuality Syndrome, but beyond that, they didn&#39;t have any more information and thus couldn&#39;t share that with the superintendent.<br />
<br />
That now had them out on a bit of a &quot;hunt&quot; to see if they could get some of that information that the superintendent seemed to want, if only to offer it as a solution to anyone of his tenants that were dealing with any of those issues. Some of it took time, and they couldn&#39;t avoid a lot of their daily jobs, but they were able to start with the one they felt might be the one most likely to have experience with this in Tyra Ramos. They had to come to the club where she worked as a hostess and entertainer, but the club was relatively classy, and Tyra did seem to have some time for the conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re sorry to have to interrupt your work with all this,&quot; Dakota finished as shi and Harper finished explaining their run in with the BARA House superintendent.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is understandable... though, one could make the case that it really isn&#39;t your or his responsibility,&quot; Tyra spoke with some degree of warning.<br />
<br />
&quot;You and I both know that if something goes wrong at some point that it won&#39;t be seen that way,&quot; Harper countered, &quot;and the guy did seem genuinely concerned and wanting his tenants to be happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyra gave a growling grunt in frustration at that, as that came as a sort of reminder of stuff that had gone on after Heather first became a Dinotopian. From things that had been reported after that, it was like support for Animalia went from extremely high with no worries to suddenly worried about everything, because the first action had been an attack on a Lyre High School and the threat to eat two students. Heather had gotten through that and rebounded in many ways, becoming friends with Sophie and Roland, who at times were like a younger set of coaches for Heather, which Tyra could support, but it didn&#39;t change that one set of mistakes nearly had catastrophic consequences.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;re thinking Doctor Jones in Lyre/Animalia might be able to help with these cases?&quot; Tyra asked, &quot;or potential cases? I mean he does a lot of work with that in Lyre/Animalia and even hired additional staff to help with the practice... particularly as he initially only set up shop there as a couple&#39;s counsellor. Helping Animalians find romantic partners and things like that. The Regressive Hypersexuality Syndrome issue came after that... and overtook it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re hoping he might have some ideas on who might be able to come in take over the role in Dino City,&quot; Dakota answered, &quot;we&#39;ve looked around and found a couple of small offices in Glen Rose... but we haven&#39;t seen any ads for them covering things like this. So, we thought that Doctor Jones might be able to provide recommendations on which of them to suggest... if one of those tenants is struggling. I mean psychiatrists all share papers and theories, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s possible that any published study might be shared,&quot; Tyra said slowly, &quot;but because Doctor Jones lives in Nevada and his practice is there, and most of the times when he&#39;s seen patients outside of his licensed area has been on a more informal basis and often at Animalia&#39;s behest... often when setting up a new colony. So, he may not know the psychiatry clinics in Glen Rose that you&#39;ve found.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It couldn&#39;t hurt to ask, right?&quot; Harper asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose not,&quot; Tyra spoke, &quot;and you need Doctor Jones&#39; number, I take it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dakota and Harper both nodded, while Harper produced a small slip of paper and a pen from hir purse. Tyra nodded back and carefully wrote down the number.<br />
<br />
&quot;There you go,&quot; Tyra spoke, &quot;you&#39;re free to hang around and socialize... or get a bite to eat at the bar. Though, most of what the club serves is going to be small snack size things. Jerky for predators and things like carrot sticks for herbivores.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Dakota and Harper were grateful to get the number, but they also quickly found that it was a business number and not something that would let them talk to Doctor Jones personally. This meant that they would have to wait until a time when Doctor Jones&#39; clinic was open before making that call, and it would be unlikely he&#39;d be available to speak at night. This in turn limited the time they would have during the day to try and contact Doctor Jones. It then meant waiting until they either had a day off or a weekend and hoping to play to shorter hours on a Saturday. It was ultimately the latter and they dialed the number and put it on speakerphone so both Harper and Dakota could talk.<br />
<br />
The call was easy to make but took some work in getting through the secretary. Eventually they did get a response that they wished to hear.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Doctor Jones,&quot; came a male voice, &quot;I trust this wouldn&#39;t be series, as I&#39;m scheduled for a session in thirty minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This shouldn&#39;t be too long,&quot; Harper spoke, &quot;I&#39;m Harper, and my mate Dakota is with me... we&#39;re calling with some questions regarding some help that might be needed regarding converted Dinotopians possibly struggling pressures related to changes in sexuality or potentially for Regressive Hypersexuality Syndrome.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Harper and Dakota...&quot; Doctor Jones said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, the hermaphrodite Dakotaraptors,&quot; Dakota answered, &quot;one of the large raptors from the late Cretaceous.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve seen some of the reports on Dakota&#39;s uplifting,&quot; Doctor Jones answered, &quot;are you having trouble? I mean... as hermaphrodites, I&#39;m sure that there will be...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WE haven&#39;t had that problem,&quot; Harper cut him off, trying to cut down on time, &quot;but we met the superintendent for the apartment building from across the street from our house. Apparently, he thinks he&#39;s run into some that might be... or at least that is what he seemed to tell us. That they were gay before converting or might have Regressive Hypersexuality Syndrome... or at least that was his thought and asked us if we could help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... therapy is generally the best way to work with those in many ways,&quot; Doctor Jones said slowly, &quot;though the specific discussion would be different. The therapy for Regressive Hypersexuality is going to try and get them to acknowledge and recognize past mental trauma that they&#39;ve likely buried... which then gets jumpstarted with the conversion. Recognizing that helps them get things in mind to deal with that issue... but a lot of it is still going to depend on the person actually wanting to be there. I&#39;m not sure you two, or this building superintendent could force anyone you think MIGHT be suffering from Regressive Hypersexuality. Not unless there is something where they would prove themselves too... frisky for standard business.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We understand that,&quot; Harper answered, &quot;but I&#39;m sure you do know the potential risks that could happen if it gets out of control.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do,&quot; Doctor Jones answered, &quot;but I also know that it&#39;s a complicated subject and shouldn&#39;t be done second hand. This building superintendent may have misread things, and even if he is right... some with Regressive Hypersexuality can actually function fairly well without therapy, as it&#39;s never been at a level that truly becomes distracting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That may be... but the superintendent I think ultimately has good intentions,&quot; Harper replied, &quot;and these things could happen. And we don&#39;t want there to be any sort of mistake.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a silence that followed for a few moments.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we&#39;re not asking you to take time out of your schedule to come down to Texas and interview these tenants or advertise your practice in case they might want some help,&quot; Dakota spoke, &quot;we&#39;re just curious on your thoughts and recommendations regarding a pair of therapists that have offices in Glen Rose. A Doctor Rosa Winters and a Doctor Yellow Dog. They have offices here, and we thought you might have some insight into more about what they do and how well they do. Something of a professional curtesy. Just in case those residents might want help... or need it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And this superintendent is that concerned?&quot; Doctor Jones asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We think so...&quot; Dakota answered, &quot;and he thought we could help because we&#39;re hermaphrodites... which could imply a certain line of thinking, but he was polite enough to not start a fight over it.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was an audible sigh that was then heard before Doctor Jones finished, &quot;Okay... I&#39;ll do some research and outreach into these two doctors. I&#39;ll leave you with my email and you can then send me the addresses for their practices and the contact information.  I&#39;ll then see what I can do and get back to you. Though, keep in mind, some of these residents in Dino City may already be seeing these therapists, particularly if they have showed signs of struggle with things like Regressive Hypersexuality or stress from changing instincts. If that is the case, they can&#39;t reveal anything to me, and even if they could reveal it to me, I can&#39;t reveal it to you. Understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Harper answered, &quot;and thank you for your help.&quot;</p>
