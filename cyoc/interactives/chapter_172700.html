<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff stared at the breast, trying to come up with some sort of game plan while weighing his options. On the one hand, Brianna was an incredibly attractive girl who he was being given an amazing opportunity with. If he played his cards right, he might be able to watch a second movie with her and trying snuggling even closer - the idea of which cause the breast the tingle further.<br />
<br />
But that segued onto the other hand: if he continued here being this aroused by the situation, the breast would undoubtedly become more and more noticeable, especially without the bra-cup to keep it restrained. And if he kept on being this friendly with Brianna, with more and more hormonal thoughts entering his mind, there was no way he would be able to calm it down.<br />
<br />
With a heavy heart and a defeated sigh, Jeff decided he had tempted fate enough today as it already was. Much as he wanted the momentum back in Brianna’s bedroom to stay moving (the thought of that sentence alone making his newfound nether-regions pulsate), it was better to cut his losses and head home. He couldn’t help but fantasize about her, and all the things he wanted to experience with her. Her beauty, her smell, the idea of kissing her pervading every inch of his memory. He had opened Pandora’s Box inadvertently by being so careless with the lotion, and he was now paying the price.<br />
<br />
He desperately needed privacy for what he wanted to do, and he couldn’t chance trying to do it here in the bathroom of the Ferguson home, for various reasons. Even if he had his regular privates, which he most certainly did not, he wouldn’t have tried to massage the carrot to alleviate his libido-laden fantasies, rife with naked Brianna’s and breasts that weren’t stuck where his birthday toy had once been.<br />
<br />
Carefully and cautious tucking the free breast back into his pants, a task made even harder than normal (Normal? How was this normal?), Jeff cautiously tread his way back to the room, just in time to see Brianna laughing at the mid-credits scene the movie was offering. Her sweet and sensitive chuckle made his heart flutter, but did similar things to the area below his belt line. Hyping himself up, drawing from the film they had just watched to act cool as best he could, he spoke out.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Brianna. I’m so, so sorry, but I just remembered. I need to submit a project by email for one of my classes by 10 today, and I… I haven’t even gotten halfway through it. Is it cool if I head home? I just-” Before he could even finish, Brianna was smiling and holding up a hand. “It’s all good! Totally understand. I’m glad we got to spend time together; we should do this again sometime!” Jeff nodded, fully in agreement with that proposition.<br />
<br />
“Well, thanks for having me, and, uh… Yeah, you’re welcome for your bikini back.” Jeff screamed internally at how that had come back, but Brianna, as usual, was completely understanding. “Oh, don’t mention it. And yeah, thanks. Means a lot that you handed it back…… even though I would’ve let you keep it…”<br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
“What? Huh?”, Brianna asked, a slight blush barely visible on her face in the darkened room. Jeff swallowed, and smiled as normally as he could. Returning the favor to her for her hospitality and generosity, he didn’t pry on what she said. “Oh, nothing. Well, it was great to see you! Thanks for understanding about the project and all that. Bye!”<br />
<br />
Giving their final farewells for the day, Jeff headed downstairs, the thought of what he thought Brianna had said at the end there making his situation even more dire. Had she said she would have let him keep them? Oh, my… He would certainly have a lot of funds to withdraw in the spank bank with the way his mind was forming filthy thoughts.<br />
<br />
With the dairy-filled teat already sloshing with arousal-induced warmth, Jeff decided he needed to get home sooner rather than later. However, not wanting to push his luck in a different, equally bad direction, he decided to tie up one loose end. He’d have to be in public for a little longer, but it would be quick - hopefully - and it would save him hours of lecturing. Tucking the breast breast his legs as efficiently as he could to divert attention away from it, he opened the back door to the yard.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, his mom was almost immediately outside said door as he left the house, making his search for her far shorter than he anticipated. Walking up to her as she lifted Josh up and down, making him laugh, he smiled and put on as his best good-son demeanor.<br />
<br />
“Hey, mom. I was talking with Brianna. She, uh, reminded me I have homework, and I figured it would be best for my GPA and punctuality if I competed it on time.”<br />
<br />
Jeff’s mom looked at him, still lifting an ecstatic Josh up and down in her arms. “But the party isn’t done yet, honey. And if you forgot your homework, I don’t see why the Ferguson should have to lose a guest over your lack of foresight.”<br />
<br />
Prepared for this response after years of dealing with his mother’s reasoning, Jeff quickly managed to reply, having gone through a simulation of this interaction in his head as he left the home.<br />
<br />
“Right, and please tell Tim and the Fergusons I am ever so sorry. But Brianna is a host of this household as well, and even though I want to stay - truly I do - she helped me realize that my schoolwork is more important and that it would be better if I get home. Besides, I’ve enjoyed a great deal of their wonderful party as it is, and have taken part in many of the festivities. If I have to miss out on the cake and the best parts of it, I wholeheartedly accepting responsibility due to my lack of diligence. I promise, this will be a learning experience.”<br />
<br />
As Jeff reflected on how, technically, he hadn’t really told any lies in that excuse, his mom thought pensively, holding an annoyed Josh still as he reached out to her, wanting the lifting and dropping game to continue. “Hmmm…… Well, okay. But don’t let something like this happen again, Jeffrey. And the only reason I’m letting you go early is because you were so civil and affable to our hosts, as one always should be. Bear that in mind.”<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded, wanting to get back to the sanctum of his room to relieve the arousal currently plaguing him. Turning around carefully, Jeff walked out through the backyard calmly and cautiously, doing his best not to stick out or move in any way that would draw unwanted attention - that is, any attention at all.<br />
<br />
Jeff managed to make it to the front yard, and after making it out past the driveway, the neighborhood was excessively empty due to a majority of the residents and their cars being situated back at the Fergsuon’s. Not taking any half-measures, however, Jeff stayed alert and ran home in bursts, so as not to let the breast flop around blatantly to any passing motorist or jogger or dog walker ,no matter how unlikely such an interaction would be. Part of him wished he had gone back tot he pool house for the bra cup, but as far as Jeff could tell there was no point. Going back there would likely have drawn more attention to him, he’d had have to walk to the far side of the lawn past more people than he was comfortable with, and remembering the bra he used to fashion the first one, he realized he could just cut the second cup off and fashion himself a Mark II sort of deal.<br />
<br />
The image of Brinna drinking the cola entered his mind as he was about halfway back to the house. Her lips had looked so soft and inviting, the idea of the wet cola sliding around in her mouth before drizzling back down her throat. Jeff couldn’t take the tension or the piling thoughts of depraved teenage desire constantly reminding him of what he wanted- no, what he NEEDED to do.<br />
<br />
With the dairy building up, the aroused thoughts of his pubescent mind prodding and taunting him, Jeff made it home in a feeling of sexual heat. Racing up the stairs, making sure not to trip with the excess weight handing off his pelvis, Jeff closed himself in his room, shutting he door and drawing the curtains.Taking his pants off, he lay backing his bed, getting comfy, and proceeded to massage the crotch-breast sensually. He closed his eyes, thinking back to Brianna. <br />
<br />
Her long, beautiful hair. Her clear skin. The way that bikini had looked on her. The idea of the tight, skimpy bikini she had loaned him being worn by her, tucked away in her buttocks before being introduced to his, her laugh, her kindness. After minute or two, Jeff was already halfway there, the pressure building to the exit point of the nipple.<br />
<br />
His arousal spiking, Jeff began to wonder what receiving oral from Brianna would feel like - if he had his penis back. He felt guilty, thinking of such a sweet and friendly girl in such a position, but he couldn’t help it. He could envision it clearly. He’d be sitting down in a big, comfy chair, draped in a nightgown or something else leisurely without a bottom. Brianna would be kneeling down, licking his testicles, going up the shaft, kissing the erect tip before gently and sensually caressing her hands around the base, she’d then go in and suck on the whole thing.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s hands picked up speed, his entire body quivering with bliss at the physical sensations he was creating. He kept focusing on the thought of Brianna, wrapping her hands around his legs, rubbing her cheek against his thigh, licking upwards up his long shaft to his nipple… wait, nipple? She’d then raise a hand to the firm boundaries of the swollen breast, squeezing it and emptying its warm and creamy contents into her mouth, swallowing it down gulp after gulp as he breathed sigh upon sigh of relief. As the breast’s sensual liquids of raw, passionate dairy passed through her suckling lips, he would… he would…<br />
<br />
Jeff expunged the dairy from the breast in a hefty lob, the liquid contents splattering onto his bedroom floor, leaving him tired and in a state of post-milking joy. He exhaled, wiping sweat from his brow, catching his breath as the mammary gland began to relax and adjust to its reduced shape made possible by the evacuation of the interior cream.<br />
<br />
“Shit”, Jeff said, getting up to clean the milk before it dried into the carpet. He grabbed some tissues from his bedside (ironic, he knew, given what he was doing) and mopped up the milk as cleanly and efficiently as he could. He resisted the urge to drink it as he had done before, difficult though it was to ignore, being more focused on making sense of what had just happened. He had been fantasizing about Brianna, and how she’d be performing oral on him and his penis. But, halfway through, it just… shifted. Was it his doing? Was it subconscious? Was it him playing with the breast that made him think about it? He wasn’t sure, and part of him didn’t want to know.<br />
<br />
Throwing the tissues away, he sat on his bed, bottomless, and gazed down at the still-large but relieved teat and its pink nub sitting on the end, the smallest drizzle of milk pouring down it. Jeff pursed his lips, and thought to himself. What was happening to him?</p>
