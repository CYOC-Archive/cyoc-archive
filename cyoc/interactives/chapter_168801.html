<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At Wandler’s  request for volunteers, Rhonda found herself biting her lip in contemplation. She had been dearly hoping to get through the school year without being stuck as some mythical creature, or trapped in some horrific inhuman state. But this woman seemed to know her transformation magic pretty well, and... honestly, it wouldn&#39;t be something Rhonda hadn&#39;t already been through. With a safety ward in place, she could probably be put back the way she was afterwards. Plus, showing that she was comfortable and familiar with being transformed might make her a less appealing target to any tricksters who got their kicks from seeing girls panic and freak out at being changed.<br />
<br />
Besides all that, though, there was one big reason for why she was considering it: May was right here, and Rhonda would hate to waste a good opportunity to show off how tough and brave she was in front of that cutie. &quot;I uh... I&#39;d be willing to volunteer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wandler looked like she was over the moon with happiness as the latina raised her hand. &quot;Oh, splendid! Come on up, my dear!&quot; She quickly checked through a list of the students in this class as Rhonda approached the centaur-like woman, humming to herself quietly. &quot;You would be... Rhonda Martinez, I believe? Thank you so very much - I assure you, it&#39;ll be a worthwhile experience!&quot; She grinned and began rubbing her hands together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I&#39;m sure.&quot; She glanced out over the rest of the girls in class, checking the reactions of a few people in particular. Lichi, unsurprisingly, was grinning like mad, sitting at attention and eager to see how this would play out. Usami seemed fascinated, and May flashed her an approving smile that caused the latina&#39;s heart to briefly flutter. Abigail looked like she was trying to look disinterested, despite her clear hope that something awful would happen to Rhonda. It was Sofia&#39;s gaze that threw her off slightly - the blonde looked like she was about to blow a gasket and fighting to keep her mouth shut. After a moment, though, Rhonda returned her attention to the teacher. &quot;I&#39;ve... been transformed before, actually.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her eyes brightened. &quot;Really? Why that&#39;s wonderful, I&#39;m always happy to see someone familiar with such an exciting school of magic!&quot; She retrieved a wand and a thick tome from the bag she&#39;d brought into the class, her arm stretching to bring the latter object up to where she could easily read it. &quot;I hope you won&#39;t mind if I go for something a bit... flashier, then, since you&#39;re accustomed to the sensations? Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll be back to your old self as soon as class ends!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rhonda was just about to ask that the teacher keep it to something light, but her eyes trailed out over the classroom again, and for just a second, they met with May&#39;s gaze. The scientifically-minded witch looked so excited, so eager to see what would happen. The surge of something in her heart (or more likely, the surge of hormones flowing through her body) quickly changed her mind. &quot;Yeah... let&#39;s do something wild.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fantastic! I know just the thing!&quot; She flipped through her book, letting out an excited a-ha on finding the right page. With a series of complex gestures she began to intone in some ancient language understandable only to the magically-inclined, sounding like pure, vintage gibberish to Rhonda&#39;s mortal ears. More understandable was the feeling of some blanket of eldritch force beginning to spread over her skin, starting at her feet and rapidly traveling up to hold her in place as the magic began its work. That was definitely a familiar feeling - she had to fight not to wince at remembering all the terrible transformations that had followed these particular sensations.<br />
<br />
It started in her back this time. A pressure between her shoulder blades and her spine - something growing, trying to force its way out. Her mind flashed back to the time she&#39;d gotten turned into a bee monster, and how difficult it had been trying to explain to her mother why such an expensive jacket had been ruined in that way. Mercifully, the magic seemed to weave through her clothing this time, pulling apart some openings for the two bony protrusions to rocket out. She turned her head slightly as they emerged, confirming that she was looking at the bones of a pair of wings wrapping around her, slightly shorter than she herself was. Oh great - were those a batlike structure? Was she turning into some flying rodent? She <i>hated</i> getting turned into a rodent.<br />
<br />
No, no, maybe not. Flesh was starting to form, skin and membrane, but no hair. In fact, the black texture that began to bump up along the ridge of her wings looked... scaly? Was that... oh shit... oh shit. Her eyes widened as she looked down to her hands, finding that the pressure in her fingertips was already seeing her nails lengthen and sharpen into points. Was she... oh no, she couldn&#39;t be. But she could! The black scales that began to poke through the skin on the back of her hand, interspersed with glinting crimson all the way up to her elbows, just confirmed it. The one thing that she&#39;d always thought might be cool to be turned into, and it was actually happening! Holy shit!<br />
<br />
She actually smiled at the sensation of spikes popping out from her elbows, bony protrusions that you could put a hole into somebody with. Yes! Yes! Finally, something that wasn&#39;t horrific! She rubbed her lower legs together, loving the sensation of scales appearing up to her knees, another pair of bony spikes popping out the front of the middle joint in her legs. Heat was flowing through her now, especially between her thighs as she felt something poke out just above her rear end, quickly rocketing out in a length of cartilidge that gained the same flesh and scales as her wings, tapering off from the width of her arm to a point after abouy four feet in length. The tail quickly curled around her hips, a tiny bit of self-control barely keeping her from finding some inappropriate uses for it immediately.<br />
<br />
Her eyes shut tight, embracing the burn as human pupils shifted into something golden, more reptilian in shape. Hair atop her head was pushed aside as six little nubs, two rows of three, pushed out atop her head, little miniature versions of the spikes on her elbows and knees. Eagerly her hand ran through her brunette locks, a sigh passing her lips as she felt her new horns brush against the rough scales of her hands. Finally, the eldritch force keeping her in place vanished, returning her full range of movement as she opened her eyes once more, slitted orbs glancing over the mostly-enraptured students.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, I will admit, a dragon-morph is not the most out-there possibility,&quot; Wandler spoke up once more, her tone thick with glee. &quot;But I have to say, you&#39;ve come out of it looking absolutely splendid! And if you won&#39;t mind my saying, you are <i>remarkably</i> malleable! Normally witches can be a pain to transform to such a degree, but your body takes to it-&quot; She stopped short, blushing slightly. &quot;Ah, yes, sorry, I&#39;m getting carried away again. Tell me, how do you feel?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rhonda&#39;s answer came quickly, her attention still mostly focused on feeling over her new scales. &quot;Fuckin&#39; sweet,&quot; she muttered. &quot;Sorry. Language.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, it&#39;s quite alright! You&#39;d be surprised how common a reaction that is. Well - in your case, maybe not so surprised.&quot; With a grin she turned back to the rest of the class. &quot;As you can see with Miss Martinez, a little bit of transformation magic can work some incredible wonders on a body. If any of you would like to experience it, and feel nervous about committing to a full year with a new state, then please let me know - I will be more than happy to execute something temporary for you!&quot; She clapped her hands together, sighing contently and motioning back to the empty desk. &quot;Now, Miss Martinez, if you won&#39;t mind taking a seat - we&#39;ll continue with class, and I can revert you after the lesson.&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded, staggering slightly on her first few steps back as she grew accustomed to the new center of balance to her body. Quickly though she got the hang of it, even finding it was easy enough to fold up her wings into a comfortable position when she sat down once more. Every girl in class was still giving her occasional glances, some excited like Lichi&#39;s, some exasperated like Sofia&#39;s. Next to her, she did her own glance to May; the blonde was grinning like crazy, giving her a thumbs up and mouthing &#39;you look awesome&#39;. Rhonda gave her a grin in return, her confidence boosted by her new new draconic nature - goddamnit if it wasn&#39;t nice to be turned into something <i>badass</i> for once.<br />
<br />
The rest of the lesson was positively boring by comparison, really. Math was math, and while there was a fairly unique and fantastical woman teaching it, high school level mathematics weren&#39;t exactly different for witches. That suited Rhonda just fine - she had a head for numbers, after all, moreso than most of the other girls here probably would. She got the feeling that, compared to most of the other classes, this one would be a breeze for her - a good thing, too, as it gave her more time to relish how wonderful it felt when her scales brushed against something, or when her tail swished back and forth, or when her wings fluttered slightly.<br />
<br />
Far too soon the class was over and dismissed, Wandler calling her back up to the desk to be returned to her human state. For a moment, though, Rhonda found herself pondering. All things considered, this was not at all an unpleasant form to have... and the repeated glance-and-look-away-blushing views from May seemed to affirm that the other girl liked what she saw. Sure, she usually wasn&#39;t on board for lingering in changed states, but... this wasn&#39;t so bad. What could be the harm in staying like this a while longer?</p>
