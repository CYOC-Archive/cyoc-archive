<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jim drove as fast as the traffic could take him, he needed to find his missing sons. If they too had <br />
transformed that meant they could be causing trouble or worse, be in trouble. <br />
<br />
A red light. Jim was not going to be deterred by it, but the police car behind him could stop him, better to <br />
play it safe, than loss more time. He stopped when suddenly a shirtless, most likely coming from the beach, <br />
man knock on the passenger window wanting to get out. The man was pretty fit, and the red Mohawk, was his most <br />
defining feature.<br />
<br />
Jim was yelling at him, he hadn't time for being mug, and why didn't the police went to his help. <br />
<br />
&quot;Open up man!&quot; yelled the shirtless man, not demanding, but begging.<br />
<br />
He was about to leave him, when he saw a bunch of men angrily running toward the one pleading help. It was <br />
something in his eyes, but Jim felt compelled He unlocked the door, and in came the man. He was wearing flip <br />
flops and a tiny short, that looked for a much younger boy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Finally!, Floor it pops!&quot; yelled the man seeing a couple of strong dudes running toward his passenger.<br />
<br />
The light went green, and he drove away. Having advanced a little farther and seeing the boy catching breath, <br />
he finally asked. &quot;Who are you? And most importantly did you did something illegal?&quot;<br />
<br />
The man saw him with an astonished look. &quot;Naw man, well I did STOLE a bunch of chicks from that wad of <br />
losers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah... Jealous boyfriends.&quot; said Jim, remembering he had better things to do. &quot;Look kid, I'm in a hurry, were <br />
can I drop you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, well you are going my way actually, how close could you take me to Madison Ave. 2314?&quot; asked the young <br />
man.<br />
<br />
Jim slammed on the breaks. That was his son's house. &quot;Who are you? And what business do you have with the <br />
Flynns?&quot; yelled filled with rage Jim.<br />
<br />
The man was actually terrified. &quot;I-I-I'm...&quot; stuttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Spit it out!&quot; shouted Jim.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Sam Flynn, I live there!&quot; said the young man sobbing and crying, obviously scared.<br />
<br />
Jim couldn't believe his ears. His son Samuel was barely 8, but a hulking teen like that wouldn't dismantle <br />
like that for being yelled. A child might though.<br />
<br />
&quot;Little Sam? What happened to you? Do you know where Porter is?&quot; asked Jim frenetically.<br />
<br />
It took a little time for both to calm down enough to sort things out. Sam didn't know what happened and had <br />
spent the day flirting with the beach girls, nights in a party, and the next days the guys were fed up with <br />
him. He didn't know where Porter was or why he needed to be close to girls, but that he felt good. Apparently <br />
he was young enough mentally to ignore about sex, which at least calmed his father a bit, still he was worried <br />
about Porter. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile Jim himself presented him as a friend of his mother who had ask her to find her missing sons.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's drive to the park, maybe he is there. Porter likes the park.&quot; suggested Sam.<br />
<br />
It was a longshot, but Jim had no other lead, and it was as good as any. After all it was cheer luck that lead <br />
him to Sam. But sheer luck was on his side when on the way to the park, a market near it was having troubles <br />
with a small furry creature.<br />
<br />
Apparently it was trying to steal fruit and the owner had catch it. It looked different but it had the liking <br />
of his son Porter.  His poor devolved son.<br />
<br />
Jim apologized for his escaped monkey and even paid for the fruit and the trouble. The owner doubted the <br />
veracity of the story, but the money had a liking to Jim, so he accepted the money.<br />
<br />
&quot;He smells good. Familiar.&quot; thought Porter.<br />
<br />
However, a female officer came to Jim asking for the papers for the 'animal'.<br />
<br />
&quot;He hasn't hurt anyone, he was just confused.&quot; said Jim.<br />
<br />
The officer wasn't move, but as she was about calling reinforcement Sam stood up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Milady, please think straight.<br />
That's it you're doing gre-e-eat.<br />
Search your heart, you'll see.<br />
There's nothing wro-o-o-ong here-ere!&quot;<br />
<br />
The officer was blushing at the shirtless Sam. She regain enough composure to said. &quot;I'm letting you off with <br />
a warning this time. And you... Put on a shirt.&quot; said the still stirred officer.<br />
<br />
Jim took his monkey son, and the one who just save him a lot of explanations. But now he was tore. He had to <br />
take them to their mother who was a wreck for her missing sons, but he was driving with the child of the <br />
missing link and a womanising beach hunk, not her cute little munchkins. He could take them to the cabin when <br />
all his offspring would gather and sort this out first.</p>
