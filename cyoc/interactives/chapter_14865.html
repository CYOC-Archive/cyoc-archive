<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Paul needed money. He needed a lot of it! He had a very expensive hobby, and he thought of a way to get a lot of money from his school. He hated school, therefore he saw his school as the best target for getting the money that he needed in order to support his hunger for drugs and alcohol. <br />
<br />
He was a tall, big man, he was only 17 but he looked like he was 20. Nobody really knew how old he was, since he didn’t talk to anyone besides his two henchmen. He didn’t talk to any other students and he never said anything in class either. To him, school was nothing but a big waste of time, and it interrupted the times where he could do whatever he wanted, which was usually to indulge in the few pleasures that he seemed to enjoy most, which was drinking beer and taking drugs.<br />
<br />
Randy and Tyrone were the only two people that Paul ever talked to while at school. All three were about the same height and weight, and they all enjoyed the same pleasures. But Paul was the one who always thought of new ways to get money, so he could buy the stuff for his group. But supplies were about to run out once again. <br />
<br />
The three men had watched several action movies and news clips, and they came up with a brilliant idea to get the school to pay them a hefty sum of money, or else they would cause significant structural damage to the buildings in the school district. They had decided to execute the new plan at JFK High School. Unfortunately for them, that was the same school which Ty, Peter and Jason attended.<br />
<br />
Paul had gathered all the supplies needed to build a large bomb, big enough to destroy a large section of the school’s main building, where all the classrooms and administrative offices were housed. He just needed someone to build the bomb for them. Since none of the men really cared enough about chemistry, they decided to be on the lookout for any student, who seemed geeky enough, to know how to build a bomb for them.<br />
<br />
Randy and Tyrone would wander around the halls of the building after school. The science and the chemistry labs were of great interest to them, and they carefully observed and noted which students spent the most time in those labs. <br />
<br />
One afternoon, after the last period was over, Kent stayed behind in the chemistry lab, long after the teacher and all the students had gone. Tyrone was walking through the hall, when he spotted Kent through the glass window in the main door to the lab. He signaled Randy to come and see, they had finally found their man. Kent was one of the biggest geeks in the school, and they figured that he would surely know how to construct a bomb for them. <br />
<br />
They quietly opened the door and walked in the classroom. Kent was startled, and he stood up, wondering what the two students wanted from him. Tyrone walked up to him, with Randy standing behind him. He asked Kent if he knew how to construct a bomb, and he responded that he did. Then, in a flash, Randy got behind Kent and tied a small towel over his mouth, while Tyrone reached down and tied him up with a long rope. Kent tried to kick and to scream, but Tyrone grabbed a paper towel with a strong alcoholic scent, and he placed it over Kent’s nose, which caused him to lose consciousness. They carried Kent over their shoulders to the car, and they took him to Paul’s house.<br />
<br />
During the scuffle with randy and Tyrone, Kent dropped his baseball cap on the floor and he left his backpack with all his books in the chemistry class. These would provide clues to the others, who began to wonder what had happened to their geeky friend.<br />
<br />
Later that afternoon, Kent’s sister, Jessica, began to get worried, and she picked up the phone and started calling some of Kent’s friends from school, just to see where he was at and why he hasn’t come home yet for dinner.<br />
<br />
One of the first people she called was Jason, Kent’s loyal classmate and best friend. Jason was shocked to hear that Kent never came home from school, and he decided that it was time to call on his friends Ty and Peter to help him track down his buddy. Where could Kent be? And why didn’t he come home that afternoon? They needed to start an investigation right away!<br />
<br />
Jason picked up the phone and called Ty. He asked Ty to come over to his house and to meet him out in the garage. Luckily, Ty and Peter just lived a few blocks away from Jason, and the three boys met in Jason’s garage about thirty minutes later.<br />
<br />
“Guys…” Jason began to explain, in a serious tone of voice “Something’s happened to Kent. Jessica just called, and he never made it home from school. We need to find out where he is, because she’s all worried about him right now!”<br />
<br />
“I guess this is a job for the ChaosRiders!” Ty shouted out loud!<br />
<br />
“Men, we’re called to rescue Kent from his captors. We need to find out where he is and who is keeping him… and why!” Jason responded. “Let’s change our uniforms and our bikes, so that we can get started with our rescue mission!”<br />
<br />
“I wish for the three of us and our bikes to change into the ChaosRiders!” Ty shouted out loud. Immediately his power started to change Ty, Peter and Jason.<br />
<br />
The three bicycles in the garage started to change right away. They each grew taller, bigger, and longer. They each had an engine like that of a very fast motorcycle, and the consoles and the seats all changed. Within seconds, the three mountain bikes had transformed into three high-speed motorcycles.<br />
<br />
Ty, Peter and Jason suddenly grew slightly taller and a lot more muscular, as they were now about 6 feet 6 inches tall. Next, their clothes transformed into leather straps, which were tied around their ankles, their chest, and their wrists. They were wearing their shorts, and they had large shoulder pads over their shoulders, which contained several sharp spikes. They had masks over their heads, with golden horns sticking out on top. Peter’s uniform was blue, while Ty was red and Jason was green. Within moments, the three teens had successfully transformed into the mighty ChaosRiders!<br />
<br />
All three immediately jumped on their motorcycles and rode on the street. Jason was the leader, and he rode out in front, while Ty and Peter followed right behind him. Since Kent was last seen at school, he decided to ride straight towards the main parking lot in front of their high school. As soon as they arrived, the three ChaosRiders jumped from their bikes and ran into the building.</p>
