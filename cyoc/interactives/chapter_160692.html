<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Most would assume the live of the rich was a worry-free one, a nonstop luxury from morning to night. However, their lives are more complicated and taxing than one thought. For among the upper class, there were high expectations of how one behaved and what they would be skilled at. Some of these people could be very strict and controlling of their children so that they wouldn’t ruin their family image. And there were times where the pressure of prestige were just too much to bear. Such is the story of Nicole and her mother, Joanne.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Nicole and her mother have had a pretty rocky relationship. It was hard to say if things soured when Nicole hit puberty or when her father died. Either way, Nicole’s adolescent was not a smooth one. Like many teenagers, she was rebellious against her mother’s way. Though unlike most teenagers, Nicole had a lot to rebel against. Joanne had tried to pack in as many activities as she felt a young lady should engage in, including flute lessons, riding lessons, dancing lessons, and so forth. Nicole protested that she didn’t need to know most of these things. This was the 21st century, not the 19th. She wasn’t just some debutante destined to be an ornamental housewife. Joanne tried to make her daughter see that being multifaceted was a good thing in life. However, neither was able to get her point across and thus there were a lot of arguments.<br />
<br />
The breaking point was when Animalia started expanding into a bigger community. It wasn’t that Joanne disliked Animalians. On the contrary, she was quite pleased by their arrival. Since her husband passed away, Joanne had been running her fashion company pretty well, but sales were starting to stagnant over the years. But with Animalians needing new styles of clothes for their different bodies, Joanne was able to bring some new life into the business. And helping the Animalians meant more good publicity for her and thus more business elsewhere. The real problem was that while Joanne appreciated the Animalians for the business opportunities, she didn’t think very much about them otherwise.<br />
<br />
Nicole was a different matter. She admired the Animalians for being able to build up their own society and being willing and able to work with human governments in the most peaceful way. And she couldn’t deny she envied the supermodel bodies Animalians get. Part of that was derived from Nicole’s own dream to be a supermodel, but her mother had always said no because ‘a respectable lady should not be showing off her half-naked body to complete strangers’. As such, there has been a lot of arguments between her and her mother over Animalians.<br />
<br />
Their last argument went something like this. It had started off with a somewhat off-color comment by Joanne regarding the limitation of conversions. Nicole was quick to leap to the defense of Animalians. Things soon started becoming more heated until both of them were shouting.<br />
<br />
“Would you stop treating Animalians as nothing more than a business asset?” snapped Nicole, “They are real people with real feelings.”<br />
<br />
“They <i>are</i> a business asset,” snapped Joanne, “If you can’t really see that, you’re not going to make it far in the corporate world.”<br />
<br />
“Not everything is about money!” snapped Nicole, “Haven’t you ever considered doing good for the sake of doing good?”<br />
<br />
Joanne groaned and said, “Where did I go wrong? How could you not learn anything about running businesses and work from under me.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, is that what I’m doing?” asked Nicole dryly, “I thought you were raising me to be some snob’s trophy wife.”<br />
<br />
“Apparently I’ve been raising a spoiled brat who doesn’t appreciate what her parents went through to give her what she’s had,” snapped Joanne, “If your father were here-“<br />
<br />
“Oh, sure, always use Dad as your last defense,” snapped Nicole, “I would think Dad would have cared more about his family.”<br />
<br />
“That is it, young lady,” snapped Joanne, “If you think I’m handing over the company with that attitude, you’re very mistaken. Unless you start shaping yourself up, it’s your grandchildren who will be getting it.”<br />
<br />
“Like I ever even wanted it,” snapped Nicole, “I don’t need this company, this house, and I certainly don’t need you.” With that, Nicole packed up what few possessions she wanted to take to her new life. She wanted a far simpler life, away from the trappings of the elite. She didn’t even bother packing too many clothes. They won’t be fitting her long anyways.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
“Are you certain about your choice?” asked Judy.<br />
<br />
“More certain than anything,” said Nicole, “I don’t see what the problem is. You have plenty of red foxes here. A fennec fox wouldn’t stand out.”<br />
<br />
“It’s not about your choice of animal,” said Judy, “But I’m worried if your judgement is clouded with anger. As the saying goes, ‘choose your transformation in haste, regret in leisure’.” Nicole gave her a raised eyebrow. “Ok, so that isn’t how the saying goes, I’ve never heard the original version,” said Judy, “But I just want to make sure you’re not rushing into something you can’t undo.”<br />
<br />
“I’ve been thinking about it for years,” said Nicole, “It’s past time I acted on it. I’m more than capable of taking care of myself.”<br />
<br />
“Very well then,” said Judy. But she made a mental note to contact Dr. Jones later. She was pretty sure Nicole was dealing with some emotional issues, even if she was doing so by ignoring them.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t that hard to get fennec fox DNA. They were becoming quite common in the exotic pet trade, though their behavior didn’t make them easy pets. Nicole could have chosen from many other species, but she chose the fennec because foxes were sexy and she had plans for those oversized ears.<br />
<br />
Soon Judy had injected her with the solution, gave her the customary welcome to Animalia, and left her alone. Nicole could already feel the changes starting. She had been wearing shorts to show off her legs, recently shaven since spring had started. Now they were getting hairy again, though the hair quickly thickened to a light sandy and white fur. She took off her shoes so she could watch her feet shift into vulpine paws.<br />
<br />
Things got uncomfortably tight when her hips started growing. She knew Animalians had curvaceous figures and was expecting that to stack on top of hers. She pulled off her shorts and panties, giving her more room to grow. She felt a presence in her lower back and turned to watch her tail grow out. She was a little surprised when the tip grew black fur. She forgot that fennecs had black-tipped tails.<br />
<br />
Then she remembered the other feature of fennecs and looked in the mirror. It was a little unnerving watching her face distort into a vulpine muzzle, but she knew she looked even cuter. And her ears were growing larger, easily parting through her blonde hair. They grew bigger and bigger, not unlike Judy&#39;s ears, but a lot more angular. Nicole giggled, thinking it looked like she had a pair of satellite dishes on her head. She could already hear things going on in the next few rooms.<br />
<br />
But Nicole wasn&#39;t just cute, she was sexy. The way her breasts were swelling reminded her of that. Releasing them from their prison, Nicole fondled her growing boobs. And before long, she was on the bed, fingering herself out. Nicole let out a few happy yips as she got herself off. If just this feeling is good, she couldn&#39;t wait for the rest of her Animalian life. Looking herself in the mirror, she knew she was as sexy as the other vixens. Her extra-large ears deterred nothing from her beauty. She could easily get a career in the modeling world now. But what&#39;s the rush. With the epidemic going on, modeling opportunities will be limited. Besides, Nicole had years of repression to work out of her system. A dancing career in the Meat Market sounded like just the ticket. Julie grinned, showing her sharp teeth. This fennec fox wasn&#39;t going to be a proper lady at all.</p>
