<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The air grew thicker with the ripe ever-present musk that now pervaded the entire planet of bears. The weather forecast for the <br />
day predicted a pleasant 2.5 logarithmic T-SCALE, enough vaporized testosterone from sweat in the air to make everyone feel <br />
pleasantly stimulated, but no where near the 7.0 INSTA-BONER one might experience on a hot day in the city without a prevailing <br />
breeze. However, in that crowd surrounding the giants Magnus and Patrick the air was so heavy with musk and hormones it reached <br />
the theoretical 9 of 10 on the T-SCALE--which until now was only theorized by Prof. Tenhaff's of Cambridge University's PERFECT <br />
PORN STORM scenario computer simulation. Nearly every man in the vicinity had dropped their pants and started stroking at the <br />
sight of the two brutes on stage.<br />
<br />
The pair locked each other in a dead heat as their massive barrel-sized arms wrestled each other. The Nordic god Magnus fixed <br />
his dominant icy-blue gaze on Patrick's fierce vivid green-blue eyes as their arms shook ferociously. The thick biceps and <br />
triceps rippled and pulsed like fearful bulls butting heads, maneuvering and plunging at each other. Both panted and grunted as <br />
their massive chests heaved, sending the tendrils of their thick braids deep into forests the forest of chest hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dan is mine!&quot; the Nordic bear shouted with the deep thundering voice that possessed him after Dan had created it. Magnus <br />
roared and the over-sized chair beneath him collapsed and shattered into pieces as he grew even larger, his huge massive gut <br />
and tree-trunk legs making him look more like a gold and white elephant with pecs than a man. The red haired Celtic god seized <br />
upon Magnus' sudden change loss in balance and slammed Magus' flaxen-haired knuckles against the table. <br />
<br />
Sebastian the ref started to count to three to call the match, &quot;One.. two...&quot;<br />
<br />
However, bigger than Patrick now, Magnus fought back and slowly worked his fist back up off the table. As he rose to a kneeling <br />
position, one of his huge big-foot-like feet planted itself flat on the floor and the other knee dug down against the ground.  <br />
This stance revealed his Beach-ball sized nuts and a cock almost as long as Dan was tall, and semi-hard pushing up against the <br />
bottom of the table. The mini-skirt of a kilt he wore earlier completely tore away. Magnus had entered the realm of too-big for <br />
clothes and Dan knew that no mater the victor Magnus would be forever nude. Magnus worked the arm-lock back the other way.<br />
<br />
The moment Patrick saw that he was loosing he roared a fierce battle cry and his chair gave way. However, he was able to brace <br />
himself after watching Magnus' chair shatter and lost little headway as he assumed a similar stance to Magnus--one of his <br />
massive hairy ginger feet on the floor and the other knee on the ground, exposing to the audience his vein cock and balls <br />
roughly equal in size to Magnus' package. A fan had taken one of Patrick's favorite old 24XL-t-shirts and fashioned it into a <br />
hipster Speedo for his idol, but as the tattered shreds of the rock-band t-shirt smothered beneath the beach-ball sized nuts as <br />
the Celtic god moved beyond being contained by mere human clothing. Patrick was a true beast now and like Magnus would be no <br />
longer wearing clothes from here on out.<br />
<br />
As Patrick managed to wrestle back to a deadlock the crowed watched the battle going on beneath the table. The two cocks the <br />
size of men, well at least in the old world, pressed tightly against each other as their combined pre oozed like a hot spring <br />
down into the audience. The hairy Celtic god smirked as he slowly thrust against Magnus' cock with a deep conceited grunt. The <br />
rock-hard Nordic god's visage flashed for a moment with submissive embarrassment and the red-haired mountain smiled a big <br />
toothy grin framed by his epic flowing beard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dan is mine!&quot; Magnus shouted in protest and his body began to rumble, signalling the oncoming change.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Dan is mine!&quot; Patrick bellowed as he used up his last growth spurt and his body shook.<br />
<br />
Simultaneously the two giants burst larger than ever before. The force of their two guts slamming against each other shattered <br />
the table into shreds. The perfectly round gut-globes the size of smart cars pressed against each other as the over eight foot <br />
tall giants continued to roar savagely at each other, their thick braided manes entangling each other like a celtic knot of <br />
fire and gold. Their hulking rounded bodies and beach-ball sized pecs made it almost impossible to continue the arm-wrestling <br />
competition, especially without a table to hold their guts back. Both giants shimmered with sweat as their cocks--now roughly <br />
the size of some of the smaller bears here--fought each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dan is mine!&quot; Magnus shouted, his golden haired body bulging and flexing, pushing his cock against Patrick's. Sweat dripped <br />
from his thick brow and ran across his cheeks into his golden beard. &quot;He's going to fist me elbow-deep every night until I <br />
cum!&quot; (however, at this point, given Magnus' size, Dan would have to go shoulder-deep into those round golden hills for any <br />
effect.)<br />
<br />
&quot;Silly bottom!&quot; Patrick's voice bellowed deep like a thundercloud, &quot;Dan's my cub and my cub only!&quot; And with that he began to <br />
thrust into Magnus' muscle-gut. Magnus winced and a half-liter of cum squirted out of his rock-hard cock and into the fire fur <br />
on Patrick's chest. The Nordic god ground his teeth as it was obvious he was on the edge of shooting his load. Patrick shot an <br />
evil smile across his face as his stubby fingers wiped the cum off his chest and he licked it. &quot;You're my cub too now Magnus, <br />
aren't you?&quot; he said with a sly grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; the golden god shouted as he neared cumming and loosing himself and the battle to sub-zone ecstasy, &quot;I'll win, Dan is my <br />
cub I--&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that Magnus used his last growth spurt. Magnus' body began to rumble! He had to be bigger than Patrick!<br />
<br />
Patrick glared down Magnus, seemingly halting the power of the CHRONIVAC with his pure will. <br />
<br />
For a few moments the world was in limbo as the CHRONIVAC fought back. The two men were simultaneously drunken frat boys duking <br />
it out to win over Dan, two fat gamers raging over a game of halo to win over Dan, two steam-punk knights dueling on cyborg <br />
human-horse hybrids to win over Dan, two high school kids competing in rhythm-video games contest to win over Dan and finalists <br />
on a music idol show to win over Dan. Finally reality collapsed back into the &quot;bear world&quot; with the two hulking giants penis-<br />
wrestling in an testosterone-ladden arena for Dan's love. Those eyes and the will contained in them demanded than Dan belonged <br />
to Patrick. Somehow on some higher level Magnus knew he had been beat.<br />
<br />
After-all wasn't Magnus always the perfect power-bottom? It was years since he advanced in bear society tiers from FAT JOCK to  <br />
LEATHER SIR to KILT MASTER to GIANT FOREVER-NUDE? Hadn't he deserved the right to allow everyone to marvel at his perfectly <br />
rounded buns with a core of rock-hard glutes, bursting with a layer of fat and a thick coating of golden-yellow fur? He had <br />
worked hard at the gym every day, downing those weight-gain shakes, syncing daily with his mechanized hormone regulators and <br />
doing all the best  gene therapies. I mean sure, technically he was bigger than Patrick in mass and his balls were bigger than <br />
his as well, but Patrick was taller and packed more ginger fire-power. Patrick was so big, so strong--probably the biggest and <br />
the strongest in the world, it seemed.<br />
<br />
Dan looked on in disbelief as Magnus' last growth spurt made the Nordic's body wider but not taller, bigger, but not stronger. <br />
The golden gut swelled to the size of a mini-cooper and his tire-sized nuts dragged on the ground. His perfectly round golden <br />
globes of ass swelled larger, inviting all to plunge into the powerful man's buns. The golden man's blonde eyelashes fluttered <br />
as his giant cock shot streams of cum over the pair of gods. Patrick quickly dominated the situation and the pair mud-wrestled <br />
waist-deep in cum as all the horny collage-age bears cheered and shouted in excitement shooting their own streams into the <br />
arena.  Patrick waddled behind Magnus, pushing the cumming man down on his hairy golden gut until his nipples touched the cum-<br />
soaked floor and his rounded furry butt raised high in the air. Patrick forcefully slid his massive cock into the ultimate <br />
power-bottom in front of the crowd. Magnus was in bliss.<br />
<br />
Sebastian resumed the count, &quot;One!&quot;<br />
<br />
Magnus merely moaned like a cow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Two&quot; the Asian bear shouted in the shadow of the two colossi.<br />
<br />
Patrick grunted, &quot;Uhngh!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Three! Patrick Wins!&quot; Sebastian declared. The crowed cheered and shot their loads into the air.<br />
<br />
Underneath his crimson beard Patrick's mouth made an &quot;O&quot; shape as he panted and shot his seed into the PERFECT POWER-BOTTOM <br />
Magnus. He was the ALPHA-BEAR and everyone knew it.</p>
