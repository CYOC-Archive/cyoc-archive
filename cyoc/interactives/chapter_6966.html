<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The four women descended the elevator, hoping above everything that their plan would work.  <br />
<br />
“Everyone remember what to do?” Ricki asked.  The others all nodded.  “Good.”<br />
<br />
The bell on the elevator chimed softly, and the doors opened wide.  The bell was not loud enough to alert Ray, standing 20 feet away and through a dense wall, that people were getting off the elevator.  That was to the advantage of the four women.  They stepped out and the doors closed behind them.  Brenda walked a few feet away from the others, assuming her position.  The other three crept around the other side of the wall.  Ricki and Kelly stayed back in plain sight of Brenda.  <br />
<br />
Tabitha snuck her way along the wall until she could just see Ray sitting behind the desk, apparently filling out some paperwork.  She hoped that none of the monitors displayed the images of what they were doing.  After a few seconds, she grew confident that he wouldn’t suspect anything was wrong.  She turned to look down the hall and saw Kelly and Ricki waiting for her signal.  She nodded at them.<br />
<br />
At the other end of the hell, Ricki saw the signal and turned to look at Brenda.  Brenda was waiting just outside the doors of the bathrooms.  She was standing in plain sight in the second hallway.  She just had to do her part, and Ray would come to her.  “Oww!!” she screamed loudly, and collapsed to the floor.<br />
<br />
Tabitha watched as Ray reacted.  He pushed his papers aside, stood up, and went down the other hallway.  Tabitha looked back at Ricki and Kelly and waved frantically for them to start moving towards her.  They had removed their high heel shoes so that they could run without being heard.  They joined Tabitha at the end of the hallway and waited to hear Brenda speak again.<br />
<br />
Brenda was pretending that she had hurt her ankle.  Ray approached her, worried that something might be wrong.  “What’s wrong?” he asked with obvious concern.  <br />
<br />
Brenda looked at him, faking a look of pain.  “I tripped coming out of the bathroom,” she said.  “I think I twisted my ankle.”<br />
<br />
As soon as Brenda spoke, Tabitha, Ricki, and Kelly made a break for the front door.  They went slowly and quietly, to make sure that they didn’t attract Ray’s attention.  Right before they left the building, Kelly place a small piece of paper on top of the pile on which Ray was working.  Luckily for them, the doors did not make any noise as they opened them and walked out into the night.  “Well, that was close,” Ricki said.  “Now we just have to wait.”  They walked towards Ricki’s car.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, back in the lobby, Ray tried to think of what he could do for Brenda.  “Do you think you can walk?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“I’m not sure,” Brenda whimpered.  “Could you help me up?<br />
<br />
“Sure,” he said nervously.  He couldn’t help but get aroused at this moment.  As he bent over, Brenda’s impressive cleavage was on full display.  Hell, even more than that, it looked like her breasts might just pop right out of her dress.  He took Brenda’s hand and slowly helped her stand up.  <br />
<br />
“Oh, God, it hurts,” she said.<br />
<br />
Ray thought quickly.  “OK, no problem.  Let me just take you into the office here.” <br />
<br />
If Brenda’s mind could smile, it would have grinned wider than the Cheshire cat.  This was exactly what Ricki hoped Ray would do.  The office on the lobby floor was the security office.  It was where they kept the tapes of the video cameras.  They did not have to worry about their activities in the lab being taped.  There were no cameras in that section of the building.  However, Ricki did want the tapes of the lobby to be removed, just in case.  <br />
<br />
Hopping on one foot, Brenda let Ray lead her a few feet to a small door that led to the security office.  “Be careful,” he warned, “The door is a little small.”  Brenda hopped right along as Ray opened the door and helped her inside.  There were two chairs sitting in front of a huge wall of monitors.  Ray helped Brenda sit in one of them.  “Ah, shit,” Ray cursed.<br />
<br />
Brenda was taken aback.  “Something wrong?” she asked.<br />
<br />
“No, just that I remembered I have to throw away some old tapes tonight,” he said.  His attention shifted back to the gorgeous blonde.  “What am I looking for?  Let’s see.”  His eyes scanned the room.  “Damn, that’s right.”  He looked at Brenda who still had the same puzzled look on her face.  “Sorry.  I forgot they moved the first aid stuff up to the front.  I’ll be right back.”  He left the room, closing the door behind him.<br />
<br />
This was just the opportunity Brenda needed.  She found the monitor that showed the lobby.  Apparently, a series of cameras kept cycling back and forth on the one monitor, and that was it.  There was a VCR hooked up to this monitor.  Brenda quickly ejected the tape.  It had a label with the day’s date on it.  She peeled the label off and grabbed a tape from the pile that Ray had referred to a few minutes ago.  She peeled the label off that tape, which was 3 months ago, and put it on the tape from this night.  She put the old tape, with the label from the first tape on it, in the VCR and pressed record.  She placed the tape of the night back on top of the pile that was to be discarded.<br />
<br />
No more than 5 seconds after she finished her job, Ray reentered the room.  He was carrying a rolled up Ace bandage.  “Hopefully this will make it easier to walk,” he said as he held it up.  He sat down on the second chair and turned it to face Brenda.  He was about to start putting it on, but saw that her shoe was still on her foot.  Motioning towards the shoe, he said, “Uh, do you mind if I just—“<br />
<br />
“Oh, not at all,” Brenda replied with a giggle.  “Thank you for doing this.  You’re such a gentlemen.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, it’s nothing,” he said.  “Just doing my job.”  He removed her shoe and started to wrap the bandage around her ankle.  It was the right ankle that she pretended to hurt.  As he wrapped the bandage around, he asked, “So where are Mrs. Cra—Tabitha and your other friend?”<br />
<br />
“They were waiting outside the elevator for me when I went in the bathroom,” Brenda improvised.  “I guess they got tired and left the building.”<br />
<br />
“That’s funny,” Ray said.  “I didn’t see them leave.”<br />
<br />
“Hmm,” Brenda said.  “Maybe they were on their way out when you came and found me.”<br />
<br />
“Maybe,” Ray said.  Deep down, he was a little suspicious.  If that was true, shouldn’t her friends have heard her scream and come to check what was wrong?  He dismissed it as nothing, though.  He knew Tabitha well enough to know that she wasn’t going to do something criminal, especially not in a place where she had a good idea of the security layout.  It was merely a little odd.<br />
<br />
Ray finished wrapping the bandage around Brenda’s ankle.  “Well, that’s about all I can do,” he said.  <br />
<br />
“It’s just fine,” she said, while replacing her shoe.  It did not come into contact with the bandage at all, so she had no worry about putting it back on.  Ray stood up and waited for her to make a move toward the door.  <br />
<br />
An idea entered Brenda’s mind.  She wanted to seduce Ray, and seduce him bad.  She put her right hand on her chest, just at the spot where the top of the dress began.  She stood up slowly, making sure she would sell her fake injury.  But as she stood, she clenched her dress in her hand and let it pull the dress off of her breasts.  “Oh, my God,” she said, pretending that it was an accident.  <br />
<br />
Ray’s eyes went wide and he quickly turned around.  “Just, uh, let me know when you’re, uh…decent again,” he stuttered.  <br />
<br />
But Brenda did not pull her dress back over her massive mammaries.  “Ray, don’t be embarrassed.  It’s my fault.”<br />
<br />
“Yea, no, I mean—“  He couldn’t find the words.  “Still.”<br />
<br />
Brenda smiled.  She could have him eating out of her hand.  She slinked behind him, placed her hands on his shoulders and pressed her body against his back.  <br />
<br />
Ray could feel her breasts pressing against him.  His cock came to attention.  He didn’t know what to do.  He stayed frozen in place, too afraid to move.  Brenda spun him around.  He looked straight ahead, over Brenda’s head.  He did not once glance down.  Brenda put her hands on his face, and pulled it down so that they looked at each other in the eyes.  She removed her hands from his face and reached down to pull her dress back over her chest.  His eyes did not move from hers.  <br />
<br />
She placed her hands back on his face and said, “You know, I think you’re really cute.”<br />
<br />
“Really?” he giggled half-heartedly.  He was getting too afraid to speak.<br />
<br />
“Yea,” she said.  “What time does your shift end?”<br />
<br />
“Uh, about 7 AM,” he said.  “Depends on whenever the morning guy gets here.”<br />
<br />
“Would you like to meet somewhere for breakfast tomorrow?” Brenda asked, batting her eyes at him.<br />
<br />
“S-sure,” he said.  “What’s g-good for you?”<br />
<br />
She picked up a piece of paper and wrote her phone number on it.  It was actually the phone number to Brendon’s cell phone, which, of course, was her phone now.  “Give me a call.  I’ll be ready anytime.”<br />
<br />
“OK,” he said taking the paper from her.  “Thanks.”  He winced, thinking he had said something dumb.<br />
<br />
“No, Ray.  Thank you,” she said.  She inched closer to his face.  She put her hands back on his face, pulled him closer and kissed him.  She had to coax his tongue out of his mouth with her own tongue, but she did get him to kiss back.  While they continued to kiss, she reached down, took one of his hands, and put it on her breasts.  When he instinctively tried to remove it, she gripped it tightly and did not let it move.  <br />
<br />
A minute later their kiss ended and Brenda pulled away from him.  “I said don’t be embarrassed.”  He gave her a dumb smile.  She smiled back, knowing he had just been taken by surprise.  “Would you mind walking me to the front door?”<br />
<br />
“Of course,” he said.<br />
<br />
They left the small office, Brenda still limping, though not as much as before.  “Are you sure you don’t need any help out to your car?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“I’m sure,” she said.  “It feels a lot better.  Again, I can’t thank you enough for your kindness.”<br />
<br />
“My pleasure,” he smiled at her.  They reached the door.<br />
<br />
“I’ll see you tomorrow, then?” she cooed.<br />
<br />
“Yes,” he said.  She gave him another quick kiss.<br />
<br />
“Until then,” she said.  With that she hobbled out of the door.  As she walked out, she looked back over her shoulder, only to see Ray still looking at her as she walked away.  She blew a kiss at him, and she could see him smile once again.  <br />
<br />
Ray walked back to his desk and saw a piece of paper that had not been there a few minutes ago.  He picked it up and saw that it was a note, clearly written by Dr. Pilsner.  It was definitely his handwriting.  It read, “Ray—I locked up the lab on my way out.  Everything inside looked good, so you don’t have to check it tonight.  Have a good night.  Dr. Pilsner.”  Ray seemed satisfied with the letter.  Dr. Pilsner would often tell him not to bother checking that lab on the nights he worked.  That was why he liked Dr. Pilsner so much.  He wasn’t sure if he was going to have a good night, but he thought he was definitely going to have a good morning.</p>
