<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer and Cat were looking at the eight eggs in their bedroom, with two more hours away. Both were thinking how they would get these to Ms. Perkins.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe it is Sunday night.&quot; signed Cat.<br />
<br />
Jennifer hugged her, &quot;We should have Ms. Perkins take us home tomorrow from school.&quot; Jennifer rubbed her belly, &quot;We will have two more just before midnight, and two for the library.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cat nodded. Their entire day was spent at home. &quot;Did you do your homework?&quot; asked Cat.<br />
<br />
Jennifer stood still for a moment, realizing she didn&#39;t even think about school the entire weekend. &quot;Hmmm. No.&quot; Jennifer tried to look innocent at Cat.<br />
<br />
Cat shrugged, &quot;It was a good weekend. We can worry about that tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer and Cat snuggled together in bed naked after they impregnated each other immediately after laying their eggs. They both fell asleep, their tails buried deep inside of oneanother.<br />
<br />
Maria woke the two up, &quot;School bus in 45 minutes&quot;<br />
<br />
Both sleepily stumbled to the kitchen for coffee, and took their cups with them back to the bedroom. They separated from each other, as they looked at their naked bodies.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eggs make us fat&quot; Jennifer slightly slurred.<br />
<br />
&quot;But it feels good&quot; Cat grinned. Jennifer smiled back.<br />
<br />
Jennifer nodded, &quot;You make a good point&quot;<br />
<br />
The two made the school bus, but only because they each put on a tube dress, with nothing underneath. This was the pair&#39;s first time with a tube dress. It looked like a good idea, five minutes to get to the bus stop and still naked from the shower. The clingy fabric seemed to stick to them like glue where their skin was still wet. The school bus seats were no help, as the vinyl seats made what persperation they had just a bigger wetspot on their dresses.<br />
<br />
The plastic chairs at the school were also no help. By the time they made it to the library, both smelled as if they had sex all morning in a sauna. Ms. Perkins came by the study room as Cat&#39;s lunchtime egg was crowning. Jennifer tugged slightly until it was all the way out, and Cat layed down, twitching in her sustained orgasmic state. Ms. Perkins was asked by Jennifer and agreed to take the girls home to pick up the other ten eggs. Once Ms. Perkins left, Jennifer and Cat fertilized eatch other again, making their next egg laying in about 12 hours.<br />
<br />
&quot;I like the tube dresses&quot; said Jennifer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Several of the boys wanted to reach under&quot; smiled Cat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you let them?&quot; asked Jennifer.<br />
<br />
Cat shook her head no, &quot;No, I told them to keep their hands on my boobs or to themselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer grinned, &quot;We do love that nipple play&quot;<br />
<br />
The bell rang for the end of lunch as the two were still milking each other&#39;s tails. It was afterschool, waiting for Ms. Perkins that Cat and Jennifer saw the boys from the park.<br />
<br />
&quot;They go to school here?&quot; asked Cat.<br />
<br />
Jenn wondered aloud, &quot;That is them. They have been busy. I did not recognize them until you said something.&quot; Jenn and Cat both watched as the group went into the boys bathroom all at the same time. Jenn and Cat joined them.<br />
<br />
Jenn and Cat disturbed their milking orgy in progress. All six of them looked at Jenn and Cat, and froze for a few moments, before they resumed what they started. Three of them had perfect teardrop breasts that would fill up a F cup bra, their nipples leaking with white sticky fluid. Their faces and heads clearly very female. Their bodies were very muscular. The three doing the milking were not as far along. Their very female faces still had some masculine qualities and their breasts were not even half the size of the other three. All six had testicles that looked like swollen basketballs, filled with the strawberry flavored nectar they will be addicted to for the remainder of their days. Jenn and Cat left the group as they were no longer a danger to anyone.<br />
<br />
Ms. Perkins was still in the library when she asked the two to help her carry the two eggs from lunch to her car. Ms. Perkins told them on the ride home about Edna and their work at the nursing home. It was odd for both Jenn and Cat to hear how the eggs were a gift. She always talked about needing more, but never about those who had already received an egg. Once at home the two loaded Ms. Perkins&#39;s car, and she left smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;She doesn&#39;t know what the eggs do&quot; said Jennifer.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s because only you and I are aware. Once the eggs merge, it was as if that person was always that way.&quot; explained Cat.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s better that way, those boys in the park remember. I don&#39;t want anyone else to have problems with us or what we can do.&quot; Jennifer responded.<br />
<br />
The six boys from the park took turns staying as pairs in each other&#39;s homes. The pictures on the walls and elsewhere in their homes showed them as more and more alien to themselves. None of the parents had an issue with two of them staying together. They knew of the milk that they shared and their need to keep their throats in top condition for milking cocks. That night, in three house&#39;s, the six did their homework in pairs, and fell asleep later that night in a 69 position. All six regretted what they did, and they were slowly making the best of what their lives were becoming.</p>
