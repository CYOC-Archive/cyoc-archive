<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After some thinking in silence, Amy had decided what the punishment for her son should be. While she petted Ally again, she turned towards Kyle, and showed him the coin to be put under again.<br />
“Now, let´s see. When you wake up, you can move and talk again. You will get a fitting punishment, Kyle. As you made your sister a dog, it´s only fitting you join her in that predicament. So, whenever I call you a “good boy”, you will act more dog-like. When I mention you´re a “good dog”, you will become a dog completely, but stay male. If I call you a “good bitch” instead, you will become a female dog completely instead, and you will be in heat. You need to return to human before your gender can be switched again, so the command “good dog” won´t work while you are a female dog. The same goes the other way around, the “good bitch” command won´t work on your male dog form. <br />
When I say it´s “a normal week day” to you, you will become your normal self again. But regardless of what form you are, you will be fully aware, even if you act as a dog of either gender, having no control over the dog. And while we are at it, you can´t use the coin, and won´t try anything to harm either yourself, your sister or me. And you won´t run from home to escape, as you are very loyal to the family.” <br />
Amy smiled at him, seeing the horror in his eyes, as he started to repeat the commands in a monotone voice. “When mom calls me a “good boy”, I will slowly act and turn into a dog. While being called a “good dog” will change me into a full male dog, while being called a “good bitch” will change me into a female dog in heat completely. These commands can´t change my gender in either full form until I´m turned human again. If mom tells me it´s “a normal week day”, I will turn back to normal. I will remain fully aware the whole time, but are unable to do anything as a dog. And I can´t use the coin, harm Ally, mom or myself or run away and escape, as I´m very loyal to my family.”<br />
Amy laughed at her sons pleading look. “Okay then, wake up.”<br />
Kyle dropped forward before catching himself with his hands, shock written all over his face. Had his mother just made it possible for him to become a dog as well? And doing so for both genders? “Mom, please, it was a joke. I didn´t even know it would turn Ally into a dog in body. Please, just remove it from the both of us.”<br />
Amy laughed again. “I´m sure you wouldn´t remove this from your sister, maybe change the phrase to something normally not said after you learned this. Let´s see how it works, then. You are a good dog, right Kyle?”<br />
Because of Kyle remaining aware, he screamed: “Nooowwwlll” as the changes started, his voice changing into a howl in the first seconds. Like Ally, Kyle quickly changed into a golden retriever, a fitting partner for her. But like with Ally, Amy hadn´t thought about Kyle was wearing anything. Much less being fully clothed, so the dog was in discomfort as he changed. <br />
While his thickening nails and shortening fingers had no problems, his feet were another story. Ally had only worn socks, but Kyle had his shoes still on, something with more resistance. He was lucky that his raising heel pushed out of his shoes, leaving them intact after seconds of discomfort. His socks had been ripped by his claws.<br />
His growing tail was worse, as it pushed against his underwear and jeans, which didn´t bulge enough. Kyle yowled in pain until it finally pushed through the clothes, leaving the jeans with a hole for his tail. His underwear underneath had fallen apart in bits. His shirt, being tighter to him than Ally´s had been to her, thanks to her breasts, restrained his fur only for another few seconds before it ripped under the inside-pressure. With a last whimper from Kyle, as his face pushed out into a muzzle, he was pushed in the mental backseat, as the dogs’ instincts took over.<br />
Seeing Kyle´s tongue roll out of his muzzle, Amy knew it wasn´t her son in control any longer. “Come here, Kyle.” She commanded, and Kyle walked over, panting. She quickly started to pet him as he sat next to Ally, which the dog seemed to enjoy.<br />
“I really need to remember that I should make you strip before you change. Lucky your shoes stayed intact, right Kyle? Not so much luck for your shirt, but I hated that anyway. The jeans will be harder to explain, but we will just throw it out as well and nobody will be any wiser, right?” Amy laughed as Kyle and Ally both panted satisfied by her petting.<br />
At the same time, Kyle´s mind was screaming angrily. It had been one of his favorite shirts, and she just laughed at that? But he couldn´t do anything now. Somewhere deep inside her hypnotic commands about being very loyal and to never harm the family stopped any threats he could create in his mind, not that he could do anything about that, either.<br />
After a few more minutes just petting her kids turned dogs, Amy decided to remove their remaining clothes and shreds. Pulling off Ally´s shirt wasn´t that hard, But Kyle´s jeans were trickier. After him yowling at her as she tried to pull it off, she got over to the kitchen and got a pair of scissors. She carefully cut the part above Kyle´s tail open, having removed his belt beforehand, before pulling it away. After ordering them to stay, Amy throw Ally ruined panties and sock, along with Kyle´s underwear, shirt, socks and jeans into the trash, leaving only Kyle´s shoes and belt behind. Ally´s jeans still remained where Kyle left them before as he had stripped her.<br />
“I will need to get some dog-food, I hope you will behave while I get some.” Amy said after some thinking, before she left her kids turned dogs alone in the living room. Mentally, Kyle was shocked again. His mother would make him eat dog food?</p>
