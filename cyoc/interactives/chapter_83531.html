<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You stood their dumbly, your green eyes wide and too shocked by what the white Chakat had just said to even notice the sounds of Chakats having sex throughout the city. You were even too surprised to really notice how aroused you were and how aroused Sally smelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it&#39;s me,&quot; your mother said with a smile and rubbed the sides of your head  with her hands.<br />
<br />
Like you she had bright green eyes with the vertical slit pupils of a domestic house cat and fairly long white fluffy fur that was also typical of various breeds of domestic house cat. She sort of looked like an all white Turkish Angora that your family owned when you were growing up. It also created the wonder in your mind that was your Chakat form was a hybrid of a cheetah and some long haired domestic house cat. But the whole thing was so new that you really didn&#39;t know what was going on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom... you... you tried to rape me...&quot; you stammered.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?!&quot; Sally gave a roar and very nearly jumped over you to confront your mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;I never would have raped you, son,&quot; your mother answered, &quot;as I said then, I was only having fun and you looked lonely.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you wouldn&#39;t have infected my boyfriend?&quot; Sally questioned, sounding very suspicious, and borderline possessive.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... I would have infected him,&quot; your mother gave a small shrug, &quot;but I would not have raped him. I would have come in... announced who I was... told him that I loved him very much and wanted him to be happy... and then I&#39;d purr like a great vibrator until he agreed to drink from me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your mother then sat back on her rear legs with her forelegs staying straight below her. Between those rear legs was an erect penis, and just like Sally, she had no testicles, just the shaft.<br />
<br />
&quot;You would infect your own son with a virus that&#39;s turning people into hermaphroditic cat-taurs with enough libido to float a battleship?&quot; Sally growled, gripping your shoulders with her hands and moving around to face your mother more.<br />
<br />
&quot;To make him happy, like ANY mother would do for her children,&quot; your mother answered, &quot;I mean look at them...&quot;<br />
<br />
She then gestured to the six Chakats in their orgy. Four were females and two were males, but given the hermaphroditic nature of Chakats, the gender differences were rather small. They were all mounted together in a circle with the penis of one in the vagina of the one in front of them. They were also leaning toward the center and were all licking each other, purring, and massaging the chests of the other. That reminded you of your own arousal, but Sally held you firmly by her side.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Do they look sad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not right now,&quot; you admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;But did they want to be Chakats?&quot; Sally questioned, &quot;being happy now isn&#39;t the issue. Every Chakat is swimming in lust and who knows what all this instinct driven sex will do with regard to STDs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As Chakats we&#39;re immune to STDs,&quot; your mother answered, &quot;AIDS, Herpes, Syphilis, all of them are not a threat to us anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Chakat Virus IS an STD!&quot; Sally argued, &quot;Charlie&#39;s own neighbors transformed him by sending him a dildo that they had coated in their own semen!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you used it?&quot; your mother wondered, showing some concern.<br />
<br />
&quot;I picked up and some of the cum fell on my knee,&quot; you answered, &quot;it hadn&#39;t fully gotten into my system when you broke into my apartment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; you mother shrugged, &quot;well... you became a marvelous Chakat and you brought your girlfriend in to join us. The two of you will be happy for many years and the old diseases will go away. The Chakat Virus will make everyone happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Some of that was puzzling and your mother made it seem like the virus was to try and do good in the world. And the scene of the orgy also wasn&#39;t conducive to really being a plague to wipe out humanity as the Chakats were now more focused on mating with each other. Even Jack and Caitlyn had returned to their own apartment after you and Sally had run into them in the apartment building.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know this?&quot; you asked nervously, as your transformed mother seemed to know too much about this to have merely been a victim.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember the job I got last week with Chakat Industries?&quot; your mother then asked.<br />
<br />
You slowly nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;What job was this?&quot; Sally asked, still suspicious.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was actually hired to do some secretarial work at Chakat Industries downtown, it advertised itself of doing a lot of pharmaceutical work and was run by a pair of doctors, a Catherine Snow and Maurice Chakat,&quot; your mother spoke.<br />
<br />
That made you sigh. Your entire new species got its name from some industrialist doctor. Your mother continued her explanation.<br />
<br />
&quot;They were doing some research as a way to try and find cures for various diseases and man&#39;s capacity for war and hatred,&quot; your mother continued, &quot;Maurice was a bit of a hippie in his younger days and came up with the idea that if we all looked for free love and free sex, we&#39;d be too preoccupied with making love to make war. Catherine was a bit of a cat lover and noticed that cats didn&#39;t suffer from the sexually transmitted diseases humans suffer from and they began isolating the hormones that humans produce when aroused and isolated them and began to mix them with cat DNA and using just about every cat species and subspecies out there. My job was to keep the official notes for the project...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the result was an STD of its own,&quot; Sally grumbled, &quot;and even if they had a good idea... it&#39;s being spread against people&#39;s will... the reporter that got changed on the news clawed me and Charlie&#39;s neighbors tricked him into absorbing the virus through his skin. Your cure has become worse than the disease, itself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you should both be happy,&quot; your mother protested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I&#39;m NOT happy!&quot; Sally roared, &quot;my boyfriend lost his humanity and only just barely has control... and the control he has is probably only to hope that he can mate with me... and I&#39;m honestly just holding back from mating with him here and now... and right now my sister is under threat of being turned into a Chakat against her will! I won&#39;t be happy until all this stops spreading and everyone gets control over themselves again. No one&#39;s had a choice in this, and that&#39;s the problem? I mean... did you choose to become a Chakat?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually no,&quot; your mother answered, &quot;Maurice and Catherine had already become Chakats by the time I fully realized what was going on... but I am happy now, so I don&#39;t see what is so wrong with it... and if you&#39;re both wanting to mate with each other... wouldn&#39;t you want to do so? Wouldn&#39;t you want to be happy?&quot;<br />
<br />
You gave Sally a look, momentarily ignoring the surprise at the white Chakat being your mother and the exact origins of the virus.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please?&quot; you asked, your own lust creeping into your voice, which made your mother smile.<br />
<br />
Sally looked back to you and gave a slight sigh, &quot;Once my sister is safe and isn&#39;t in danger of having her choices being taken away from her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally then nuzzled your cheek with her muzzle and then licked it, which felt slightly sensual as the rough barbs tugged on your fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not before,&quot; Sally finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; you gave a slightly defeated sigh, but Sally was the only one you really wanted to mate with and you try to keep your control together just get to make Sally happy.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you&#39;re not going to spread the virus, son?&quot; your mother asked as she got back onto her four feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not if they don&#39;t want to be Chakats,&quot; you answered, &quot;it&#39;s all a matter of choice, mom. I&#39;m sure you wanted me to be happy and I&#39;m sure you&#39;re wanting others to be happy... but you can&#39;t judge the end result without including the choices available. If someone doesn&#39;t want to be a Chakat... the only thing that will make them happy is the virus itself, which will mean you&#39;ll have a revolt on your hands if we&#39;re all contained and turned back...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maurice and Catherine said the virus can&#39;t be reversed,&quot; your mother answered, &quot;we&#39;re going to be Chakats forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then their happiness is still forced by the virus,&quot; Sally answered, &quot;not by choice. And Charlie and I will be working to make sure that freedom of choice is not lost in the world.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally then began to walk toward the north end of town where her sister lived, &quot;We won&#39;t be mindlessly infecting anyone. Come along, Charlie.&quot;<br />
<br />
You gave a nervous glance to your mother and then turned to follow Sally. You took two or three steps when you felt a gentle tug on your tail. You looked back to see your mother gently gripping the furry appendage, rubbing a spot where black and white bands interrupted your faded yellow fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I come with you?&quot; your mother asked, &quot;I want people to be happy... and... I&#39;ll admit that maybe my new instincts got the better of me...&quot;<br />
<br />
You glanced to Sally, as you didn&#39;t want to go to war with your mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you promise not to infect my sister?&quot; Sally questioned after a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cross my heart and hope to die,&quot; your mother answered, running her hand over her snow white breasts in the form a letter &quot;X.&quot;</p>
