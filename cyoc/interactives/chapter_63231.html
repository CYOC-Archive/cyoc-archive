<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Molly was the first to greet me as our part of the group made our way out onto the lawn outside the church. In her excitement, she hopped up and gripped me in a very happy hug with her legs dangling down below her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you have a good time, Molly?&quot; I asked her as she nuzzled my cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;A very good time,&quot; Molly answered with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;You looked good, dear,&quot; Frank Rhoer told her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Uncle,&quot; Molly nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come along, let's go congratulate the happy couple,&quot; Jacob Wayne urged.<br />
<br />
Molly and I nodded and I released her from the hug. We then slowly made our way toward where Leon and Jacki were shaking hands with the various people who had attended the wedding as they made their way out and headed back to their vehicles. It made me chuckle a little when the all too human guests found their hands enveloped in Leon's or Jacki's much larger paws.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, let me give you a handshake where you aren't looking like you're handling fine china,&quot; I quipped as I approached and shook Leon's hand, &quot;congratulations.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, George, Molly... you two don't know how much much it means to have you both here,&quot; Leon answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You helped us out when I transformed,&quot; I told him, &quot;and for that, Molly and I are both grateful...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And because of that, we see you as a friend,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;always remember that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Leon nodded, &quot;again, thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly and I nodded with a slight smile. It was then that Leon noticed Frank Rhoer standing on the other side of Molly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And who is this?&quot; Leon asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is my Uncle Frank,&quot; Molly introduced him, &quot;Uncle Frank meet Leon Washburn.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Congratulations,&quot; Frank Rhoer spoke, &quot;and on the subject of thanks, I must thank you for whatever help you've given my niece.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is no problem,&quot; Leon answered, &quot;really...&quot;<br />
<br />
Frank Rhoer nodded and shook Leon's hand. As we talked with Leon, I overheard my father talking with Jacki.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think I'll be able to drive my car anymore, sir,&quot; Jacki spoke to my father.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can assign you a partner to drive you,&quot; Jacob Wayne answered, &quot;George has a human partner that does the same for him... and if you don't want to remain on patrol or doing probation work, I can assign you to dispatch if you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No desk job for me, thanks,&quot; Jacki replied, &quot;I can accept a partner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good then,&quot; Jacob Wayne replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;You looked quite well, dear,&quot; Polly Wayne complemented Jacki.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Jacki answered, &quot;I was afraid things wouldn't fully sit right... I'm apparently an inch or two more &quot;curvy&quot; then Leona was.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You looked fine,&quot; Polly Wayne insisted.<br />
<br />
&quot;How are you feeling... instinct wise?&quot; Jacob Wayne asked calmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I guess,&quot; Jacki shrugged, &quot;the hunting instinct is certainly there... though the strongest urge I've had is actually to sleep...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To sleep?&quot; Jacob Wayne asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Jacki nodded, &quot;lions apparently do a lot of that. Don't worry. I won't snooze on the job.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about female things?&quot; Polly Wayne asked, &quot;if I may be curious...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like am I more attracted to males now or something like that?&quot; Jacki asked back, &quot;It's there, yeah... odd given that I never had female instincts or desires before... but yes, I can feel it. Most of it seems to be scents though... Leon smells nice to me, so I stick close to the scent.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a silence for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though I don't think we'll actually get to mating in our reversed genders just yet,&quot; Jacki then spoke, &quot;I'm still adjusting to things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There will be plenty of time to adjust and to do those other things,&quot; Jacob Wayne told her, &quot;hopefully, you and Leona have many happy years together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Jacki replied.<br />
<br />
With their conversation then ending, Leon turned to ask a question to all of us.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you be coming to the reception?&quot; Leon asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Reception?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, we've got a space in the park rented for a bit of picnic reception,&quot; Leon explained, &quot;for a case of irony, I suppose, my sister has rented a Lion's Club picnic area. There is the promise of grilled meat and hamburgers for all who come.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Non lions allowed?&quot; Molly teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Leon and Jacki nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll be there,&quot; I answered, &quot;No free meal goes unserved.&quot;<br />
<br />
The joke did not go as well as I thought would have.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The gathering in the park was smaller then the wedding had been. Part of it appeared to be that many of the guests couldn't get the entire day off to attend and part of it was that some of the &quot;groom's party&quot; had come from outside Peoria and needed to get back quickly. Technically, Molly and I fit into that category, but we hadn't planned on returning to Columbia Falls until the day after the wedding. But, none one seemed to complain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Steaks and burgers are on their way,&quot; Leon's sister said with a smile from a grill that she had set up.<br />
<br />
It certainly smelled good, and Molly and I made our way over toward the picnic tables that were under the small structure the Lion's Club had erected in the park. Leon and Jacki had managed to beat us there, and actually waved us over to the table they were at.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry, George, Molly,&quot; Leon spoke as we approached, &quot;It'll support your weight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn't this table be reserved for those that were part of the wedding?&quot; I wondered as I sat down beside Molly.<br />
<br />
&quot;If this were something truly fancy, then yes,&quot; Jacki answered, &quot;but most of Leon's groom's maids had to get back to their own jobs and homes. I'm partially surprised that they even came, given how short they've been able to stay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They must be good friends then,&quot; I commented, &quot;if they came at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I tend to see it that way,&quot; Leon nodded, &quot;which is better then then them not coming at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly and I nodded. As a few other guests arrived, Leon's sister finished grilling the first servings and began delivering them to the tables. She started with the table that Leon, Jacki, Molly, and I were seated at. Four plates of ribs were set down before us. They had all been cooked well, and I noticed a couple of men who hadn't been at the wedding taking their turn to man the grill while Leon's sister delivered the food.<br />
<br />
&quot;And don't worry you four, there is plenty more on the way,&quot; Leon's sister said politely and moved on to deliver food to the other tables.<br />
<br />
In time, everyone was served a hamburger and a can or bottle of soda, or some bottled water. One or two people asked for some of the ribs, but had to be told that they were reserved for the four large members of the cat family who couldn't digest  anything but meat, meaning that a hamburger was useless to us as all we could do was eat the patty. Once everyone was served, Leon's sister clapped the grill tongs together to try and attract everyone's attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahem,&quot; Leon's sister spoke, &quot;Now, before everyone starts eating, I would like to say a few words to commemorate this happy occasion... Leon, I've known you ever since you were a little girl, though I was obviously littler at the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
That earned a few muffled chuckles.<br />
<br />
&quot;You've alway been smart,&quot; Leon's sister continued, &quot;always pushing the envelope with science. I swear that by the time you reached high school you could teach there... and I thank you for getting me through Middle School.&quot;<br />
<br />
Again there were a few chuckles.<br />
<br />
&quot;And while life has thrown you some rather wicked curve-balls, it has also generated some grand opportunities,&quot; Leon's sister continued, &quot;Changes forced you to forsake your humanity so he could make money... but without him and his scheme, you would have never met Officer Jackson Kearns, who from what little I've seen, has made you extremely happy. He looked after you and allowed you to work on what you enjoy the most... science. He's made you happy and was even willing to change his gender and his species to make sure you were happy and complete...&quot;<br />
<br />
She paused for a moment, and then finished, &quot;I can not say I know Jacki well or that I knew Jackson well. But, I know the affect he, now she, has had on you. And to see you happy reminds me of the big sister who helped me so much growing up. And I hope that for a very long time, you both live happily together and allow the world to see just how good a man my big brother is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Leon gave a soft smile and pulled Jacki to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;May you both always be happy,&quot; Leon's sister finished, &quot;may your pride be happy and may your cubs be beautiful... if you have any.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was a nice little speech, though Leon and Jacki both groaned a little at the concept of children between them. I got the feeling that they still thought themselves too old for that. They had little time to really think on that though as a cry of &quot;kiss&quot; soon echoed through the area. After a few moments they acknowledged it by nuzzling their muzzles together.<br />
<br />
With that finished, everyone settled in to eating the lunches that had been grilled for them by Leon's sister and a small squad of helpers. Leon, Jacki, Molly, and I each ate three sets ribs and a couple of extra hamburger patties before the lunch part of the reception was over. As it finished, several of the other guests began to depart as well. Again likely heading back to work or back to some distant home. Most of the rest settled into quiet conversations.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want to dance?&quot; I asked to Molly after cleaning the fur around my mouth with a moist toilette.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, George,&quot; Molly gave a soft smile and stood up, &quot;see if you've learned anything after gaining stripes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I learned I'm taller,&quot; I gave a soft shrug.<br />
<br />
Molly only shook her head and lead me out into the grass around the Lion's Club picnic area. We were soon slow dancing in a small area of the grass.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how does this compare with our wedding?&quot; I asked Molly as I made my best efforts not to step on her toes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ours will always be better in my mind and heart,&quot; Molly replied, &quot;the day you and I became one... became husband and wife... and obviously the night I gained my mate...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you like me as I am now?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I liked you then too, but yes,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;you've gained the outward appearance of everything you were then. A strong, loving, protector... I love you, George.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you too, Molly,&quot; I replied as we nuzzled our muzzles together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you two mind if we join you?&quot; came Leon's voice from the edge of the grass.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Molly answered as we paused our nuzzling, &quot;go on ahead.&quot;<br />
<br />
Leon and Jacki slowly made their way out into the grass as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;It still feels odd like this,&quot; Jacki commented, &quot;I can still feel the blades of grass through my pads... I haven't been barefoot so much since I was a kid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll get used to it,&quot; I told her, &quot;and don't worry... the skin on the pads of our feet and hands are tough. They serve like shoes for us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Jacki answered, &quot;I guess it's just adjusting to everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll be fine, darling,&quot; Leon told her, &quot;shall you lead, or shall I?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacki gave a smile then got in one good jab at Leon, &quot;If you want me to bring you deer come hunting season... I suggest you let ME lead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, dear,&quot; Leon answered.<br />
<br />
Molly and I only chuckled. Others that were there soon joined us in dancing in the grass. The reception ended rather well. Even if there was no music to dance to.</p>
