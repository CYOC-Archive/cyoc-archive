<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex sat there with a strange feeling in his stomach. He didn't feel sick, but it definitely wasn't normal. Whatever it was was gone as quckly as it came, and was shortly replaced by a sort of throbbing feeling in his hands and feet.<br />
<br />
John returned with another glass of water, which Alex drank; this time, at a more leisurely pace. The next few moments were spent in silence. Alex was experiencing a sudden intensification of the strange things he was feeling, and John seemed to be expecting something to happen.<br />
<br />
After more silence, John finally asked, &quot;Are you feeling ok, Alex?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I think so,&quot; he replied, shakily. &quot;Can I use your bathroom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure. Down the hall, first door on the left.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex stumbled into the bathroom and locked he door. He didn't know what was going on, but whatever these feelings were, got more intense when he was around John. Alex wiped some sweat off his brow with his hand, but stopped half way through. Something felt odd. He  looked at his hand and couldn't help but think it looked bigger than normal. He couldn't be sure, but it did look bigger. Maybe he was having an allergic reaction to something. His feet felt weird,too, like they were pressing against the insides of his shoes.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, John was waiting in the living room. He couldn't understand what had gone wrong. When Hugo had drank the seed, his transformation was instantaneous. Nothing seemed to be happening to Alex. Maybe his body was rejecting it. The book warned about that. But he'd been so sure that Alex had been attracted to the Alpha scent. Maybe it was because he'd diluted it in water. He decided he'd better go check on Alex.<br />
<br />
Alex was trying to determine if his hand was indeed bigger or swollen, when he heard a knock on the bathroom door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alex, are you sure you're alright?&quot; It was John, and once again the feelings intensified. Now he could see his hand growing right before his eyes and he couldn't believe it. He was quickly distracted by a pain in his feet he looked down just in time to see his feet bursting out of his size 16 basketball shoes. Now the strange throbbing was shooting up his legs and concentrating in his crotch. At the same time, he was losing all anxiety of the present situation. His mind calmed and focused on one thing: the scent that was on the other side of the door; he had to get to it. <br />
<br />
John tried the door to find it locked. Just as he was about to try his hand at breaking it down, Alex opened it. When John first saw Alex, he didn't look all that different except that he was now in his stocking feet. But it took no time for John to realize that Alex was growing and fast. <br />
<br />
John backed up as Alex approached him with a lustful look. Alex was growing taller and wider with broadening shoulders. The most notable things about him, though, were his disproportionately large hands and feet. John could see his feet expanding longer and  wider, stretching the fabric of the socks until they tore.  But those were soon forgotten when Alex's shorts ripped off and his monstrous dick, rock hard, popped out and bobbed a mere inch from John's face.<br />
<br />
When this happened, Alex stopped and began to stroke his dick with his large hands. Just when he got a good rhythm going, he stopped suddenly. This puzzled John until he realized that Alex had actually grown too tall for the apartment. Alex abruptly sat down on the floor and leaned back on his hands. He then brought his feet to his dick and continued jacking off! HIs feet were bigger yet, and the toes were quite big and long. They still looke like feet, but they were definitely not normal. One foot played with his balls while the other worked the shaft. All the while, he was leaning back on his arms.<br />
<br />
It was then that John noticed how skinny Alex was. He was also quite hairless. Alex began to moan rhytmically and John noticed that his muscles had begun to swell, too. And they were growing huge! The feet-jerking got faster, as did the moans and his growth, until all reached a final crescendo. Alex shot his load which left a crack in the ceiling, and a mess all over after the initial shot. <br />
<br />
After that, Alex promptly passed out, just as Hugo had. John looked him over. He had to be over 9 feet tall, and his muscles were bulging out all over the place. His feet and hands remained oddly large, but that seemed to fit with his massive dick. The thing that struck John as odd, was how Hugo had became so hairy, and Alex just had a covering of fuzz. <br />
<br />
John was suddenly over come with heavy drowsiness, and made it to the couch before he collapsed.<br />
<br />
And so far our beastmen: John, the alpha, asleep on the couch. Alex, using his feet to play with his dick during his sleep on the living room floor. And the first recruit, Hugo, snoring in the bedroom.</p>
