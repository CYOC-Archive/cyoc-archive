<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You don't know much about snakebites, but this doesn't seem normal. It's almost like your skin is changing to <br />
that of the snake that bit you!<br />
<br />
You look to the other side of the log to find the rattlesnake is gone. You realize you never did hear it <br />
rattle. Desperate, but unable to stand you sit up and lean against the log, unsure of what is happening or <br />
anything you can do to deal with the situation. You try to calm yourself as the changes continue.<br />
<br />
You don't know it yet, but you are becoming a naga, a serpent-human chimera from the folklore of the people of <br />
India, a human-torso with the body of a snake from the midriff down.  You only know that your hands and feet <br />
feel strange, and that you don't have the strength to stand up.<br />
<br />
You're a normal, average man in your early 30s, a bit out of shape from your office-work job, and your healthy <br />
impulse appears to have betrayed you... or maybe not.  The numbness spreads up your leg, and down into the <br />
other leg, and from one arm to the other.  You can still move, a slight pins-and-needles sensation in the <br />
muscles, but you don't feel strong enough to stand, and your voice has become a whisper as you try to call <br />
out, 'help me' ... the sound barely audible.  A dizziness comes and goes, your vision blurs and clears, and <br />
you feel your muzzy-headed blur of thoughts sharpen, and now you can wonder why you aren't feeling more panic, <br />
because the scales have started on your other hand.  You watch them spread up both arms, and take off your <br />
other shoe, finding that the scales are there as well.<br />
<br />
The sun is pounding down on you, and the heat makes you feel good. You feel the need to bask in it, so you <br />
unfasten your shirt, pull it off.  The scales are spreading further, having reached your shoulder, spreading <br />
across your chest and presumably up your neck, though you cannot feel them, with your hands still numb, and <br />
you realize that your nails have become some kind of claw, quite sharp, and you could cut yourself and not <br />
realize it with the anaesthesia of the change.  So you don't poke at your face.  Instead, you pull down your <br />
pants and underwear, and see something even stranger happening.<br />
<br />
Your penis is covered in tiny scales. This is definitely not something that snakes have, you're certain of <br />
that - you can remember much more clearly than you were able to before, the trivial details of all your <br />
classes, and you know from biology courses that male snakes have &quot;hemi-penes&quot; - each testicle equipped with <br />
its own individual penis that retracts into a cavity in their abdomen separate from their cloaca, and that <br />
they don't have scales.<br />
<br />
This should worry you as well. The scales on your legs are moving further up, and you feel your tailbone <br />
growing and your ribcage feels very odd.<br />
<br />
The sharp smell of another serpent fills your nose and you find yourself licking the air, catching the scent <br />
and pushing with the two forks of your tongue into a slot on the top of your mouth.  Your jaw feels strange, <br />
loose.  The rattlesnake slithers over the top of the log you are lying against, and drops a large rabbit onto <br />
your chest.  The smell from the snake is almost like a simple conversation: &quot;EAT. YOU MUST EAT.&quot;<br />
<br />
You feel a growl from your stomach.  Yes. It's raw. That's ... irrelevant, it smells delicious, so you pick it <br />
up and open your mouth.  The stretch of your jaw is startling - you find yourself shoving the rabbit in, head <br />
first, and you don't even stop to worry about breathing.  It doesn't matter. You can breathe from under your <br />
tongue; the air channel there lets you swallow without suffocating.  The rabbit is a bit of an effort going <br />
in, but you push, and feel your neck straining up and down, and it pushes... past something, you push your <br />
shoulders together and it CRUNCHES inside you, and slides in more easily.  Then you feel it, sliding into your <br />
stomach, and the sensation of hunger fades briefly. The rattlesnake is gone again.<br />
<br />
You feel a stretching sensation in your feet. The shape of your feet changes, the toes growing longer, the <br />
great toe shifting a bit to the side, and the heel spreading, and you realize that you now have large hands <br />
where your feet once were.  There is an odd popping in your hips, and you look down to see the scaled length <br />
of your body shifting further. Your ribcage has continued to grow, longer and longer, though there is a taper <br />
where it originally ended that remains; it feels looser to you, in some ways.  You feel the length of your <br />
newly growing tail, and examine the hand that used to be your right foot.  It looks much like the one that <br />
comes from your shoulder, though that one has grown larger while the 'foot' grew smaller in its translation to <br />
hand. Your legs feel shorter, as well, your arms slightly longer. Apparently, you will have four arms.<br />
<br />
The midday sun beats on you hotter, but you don't feel overheated. The energy of the change is coming from the <br />
heat, from burning the fat you had stored, and from the rabbit... rabbit, you're hungry again. The rattlesnake <br />
appears again as soon as you realize that, with another wild hare, already dead.  &quot;EAT&quot; says its scent, and <br />
you do, this time finding it easier to open your throat, and to crunch down to swallow the prey that fuels <br />
your transformation.<br />
<br />
It seems to you that the digestion is much faster than it should be - you remember that snakes cannot digest <br />
as quickly as mammals, and you've been digesting a whole rabbit, fur, bones, nails and skin along with the <br />
rest of it.  Your entire body is now covered in the scales; thicker, wider 'scutes' running from where your <br />
old abdomen started and going down the tail, which has extended past where your feet were.  You know you are <br />
going to need much more than two rabbits to fill in even that much, and you can feel the new ribs forming. The <br />
snake returns to you with a third rabbit, and waits for you to finish.<br />
<br />
The smell from the rattlesnake says &quot;EAT ME NOW&quot;.   You are certain that you don't want to do that, because <br />
the rattlesnake appears to know about your change, but it doesn't give you a choice: as soon as you have <br />
swallowed the third rabbit, and the momentary torpor of digestion washes over you, the snake slides up onto <br />
your body.  It feels, not erotic, but very comfortable, very familiar, to have its scales slide across yours. <br />
But then it pushes its head into your mouth and the scent it releases is strong, and you find yourself helping <br />
it to slide into you, past the throat and into your gut.  The snake is quite large, nearly as big as you were <br />
as a human, which makes you wonder how you possibly missed it in the first place.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was disguised, of course.&quot;   The voice in your head that is not your own internal narrative is <br />
sufficiently strange that it would make you choke, but you have only swallowed about half of the serpent, and <br />
you are feeling an intense, buzzing tingle through where your hips were, and down your back and out into the <br />
tail that you now feel growing longer and heavier.  Your arms are stronger, you can now lift the snake to pull <br />
it down, with both sets of arms, and you feel muscle shifting in your back and neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot; you think, hoping that whatever spoke to you can also hear you.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am the egg of the Guardian, oh newly-fashioned, and I am the mother and father of the new you.&quot;  The voice <br />
seems both warm and dispassionate. You sense a faint affection, and a hint of apology, and you realize that <br />
you have been changed in a way that will make it difficult to return to your old life.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why was I chosen?  Accident, happenstance, or was I selected?&quot;  You feel that perhaps this new body you are <br />
being forced into will be tolerable enough if there is a good reason for the change.  Certainly you were bored <br />
with your previous life, and not looking forward to where it had been taking you: you had broken with your <br />
lover, who wanted you to be a 'better provider' but wasn't willing to contribute to that; you had cordial but <br />
distant relationship with your parents, who were neither affectionate nor malicious. They were simply so <br />
preoccupied with their own selves that they never really considered you once you grew past childhood; they had <br />
raised you to be self-sufficient, and then gone on with their own lives.<br />
<br />
The voice of the egg of the Guardian did not answer you, as you pushed the last foot of the rattlesnake into <br />
your gullet, swallowing it and feeling it digesting, much faster than it should have, and feeling the weaving <br />
of new muscle stretching across your body.  Your rib-cage had changed shape to accommodate the mechanics of <br />
your intended form, as your legs moved up and your hips disappeared bone and tissue migrating to where they <br />
would be needed, and the muscles in your chest and back that moved arms had attached to the migrated former-<br />
legs, still slightly brawnier and larger than the ones above, but not in an unpleasant way.  You can tell that <br />
you have a more muscular build than before, but still somewhat lithe, and you realize that you are still not <br />
properly filled-out yet. An awareness from the egg perhaps, telling you that you will need to be much more <br />
physically to become the Guardian.  And you put aside that thought, for a moment, because your emotions, while <br />
still pleasantly blunted, are preparing to scream at you if you let them.<br />
<br />
The numbness now fading, slowly, you could feel the coolness of the ground where the sun had not touched, the <br />
warmth of the sun on your body giving you energy - literally, it was like they were solar cells, taking light <br />
and providing you with power from within the deep red-and-yellow brown scales.<br />
You see that you are patterned similarly to the rattlesnake, with darker and lighter scales in a slight <br />
diamond pattern down your back and the &quot;outer&quot; surfaces of your arms, a more golden sleekness on the scutes of <br />
your belly. Your body extends out nearly four meters from head to tail - that is, nearly twenty feet long in <br />
the more common usage. You measure your length against the log and against the leg of your discarded pants.  <br />
You also know that you prefer to remain shirtless, for that reason, but that there will be a need for some <br />
sort of garb - the wordless knowledge from the egg telling you that you will need to live within society - but <br />
that it won't be important yet.<br />
<br />
You examine your new body, making sure you can feel everything and that you are moving correctly. A snake with <br />
an external penis, however scaly, would be unable to go over ground, so you are not distressed when you find <br />
that it is &quot;gone&quot; now.  Your penis has retracted, while you were busily devouring the serpent that changed <br />
you; you know where it is, under a red-tinged scute, and you know that there is a cloaca further down from <br />
which you will expel wastes, and you also know that you won't likely have many of those because your body will <br />
continue to be extremely efficient about using the food you eat.  And the knowledge from the egg tells you <br />
that you are able to eat vegetables, but not so many as you used to.<br />
<br />
The voice speaks again, as the sun begins to move down and shadows lengthen.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are now integrated into your new form. You are a Naga, a Guardian. I will remain with you, and speak with <br />
you, as long as you need me to be here, but I am now a part of you.  We must go to the place I was created, <br />
you could call it a temple, or an embassy, or a ruin.  While we go, I will answer your questions. Gather your <br />
worldly goods, we must not leave behind any trace of your former self.&quot;<br />
<br />
You had a small belt pouch in which you carried your smartphone, a utility knife, and your wallet with <br />
identification. The belt can barely go around your torso, but without hips it would slide right off as you <br />
moved, so you tighten it up and punch holes closer in with the claws of your former right foot, and tighten it <br />
above the bicep of the left lower arm.  Your wallet, your information - you also make a bundle of your <br />
clothes, and tie it across your right upper shoulder and down between your left arms, tied at the chest and <br />
slung across your back.<br />
<br />
Moving through the forest path is easier than first thought suggests it should be; you find that your strong <br />
back muscles allow you to raise your body up into a 'standing' position and that your lower arms can be used <br />
to push off of low boulders or logs, that you can slide soundlessly and faster than running by back-and-forth <br />
undulation, that you are leaving no tracks behind you other than the occasional smudge.  The ground is dry and <br />
hard in most places. You stay to the path for the most part, but the Egg instinct tells you to take a few <br />
small side-paths that look like nothing. The brambles and stones are unable to penetrate the armor of your <br />
scales, and you find yourself breathing quickly, warmed up and eager.  You catch the scent of a small deer on <br />
your tongue and taste it from the air, but the urgency of getting to your destination keeps you from going to <br />
hunt, which is, on reflection, a good thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were chosen, and not chosen. There would have been perhaps a hundred male humans who would be suitable <br />
who could have come. You were the one whose spirit answered the call, and that is entirely your choice, and <br />
entirely metaphorical. We did not send out a specific psychic message; if you had not replied, then the <br />
serpent would have waited, if none had come before the cold weather, he would have returned, or died, and my <br />
mission failed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is this mission?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are now the Guardian. There is a catastrophe, a disaster, coming soon. You were changed to enable you to <br />
survive and to protect the treasure of this world against loss from this disaster.&quot;  The voice then goes <br />
silent, and you know that it isn't going to answer further... and you see the shape of stone columns covered <br />
in many years' growth of plants and vines.<br />
<br />
The ruins, once you get inside, are a bit of a surprise.  It appears that in the past, a rather large stone <br />
structure was here, perhaps as large as a city block. A small pond gleaming wetly in the shaded bottom was <br />
probably the deepest part of the basement; you feel drawn to go down alongside it and enter a dark tunnel. <br />
There are paths through the collapse that you can take, but at least three times you have to use the strength <br />
of your arms to lower yourself. Faint tracks of something reddish appear to your vision, and a dim path shows <br />
you the route that the rattlesnake took on its way out.<br />
<br />
The path leads you to a place filled with light...</p>
