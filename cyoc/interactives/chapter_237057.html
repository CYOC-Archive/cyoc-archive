<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rachel let out a sigh of contentment that transformed into a throaty belch when the hot shower water hit her skin. Her hands go up to cover her mouth as her chubby cheeks light up, chuckling at the unexpected eruption; she was never a particularly gassy person, so this change was certainly bringing in unique experiences. Among those, of course, was her much wider, softer body; she was still mixed in her feelings on the weight. A little chub is one things, but she was FAT, double chin and belly folds and all. Just the water running down her body brought a number of different sensations, warm water slipping into every crease and fold she didn&#39;t know existed. The feeling of her thighs touching, and every movement making her body jiggle were so alien that she felt out of body almost every moment. <br />
She ran her fingers down her belly, marveling at it&#39;s size and weight. She grabs it and shakes, appreciating the amusing feeling and sight of her belly wobbling. It prompts a number of large groans and gurgles, making Rachel wince as she could feel large bubbles moving painfully through her system. <br />
She put one hand on the shower wall to lean forward, feeling her belly droop beneath her like a pendulum as she braced herself. The pain spiked, and Rachel let out an involuntary grunt of pain as a rippling burst of hot gas squeezed out her shelf of an ass with noisy rumble, giving her another new sensation of her butt shaking from a fart. That would normally be the biggest fart in Rachel&#39;s life, but she knew her new self wasn&#39;t through. She continued to brace herself as the pressure kept up, grunting as a chain of farts popped out one after another, hardly able to catch her breath. Even is she could, it&#39;d be overwhelmed by the intense smell; Rachel&#39;s nose twitched between groans, the heat of the shower just making the stench rise up in an especially potent manner. She didn&#39;t even hate the smell---in fact, there was a level of interest at just how unique and pungent her scent was. <br />
After 10 straight seconds of uncontrollable flatulence, Rachel let out a massive sigh of relief as it slowed down into barely audible toots, resting her head on her pillowy bingo-wings. She stood up and glanced back at her butt with a blissful face of release. It goes to say that Rachel has never needed to fart that much before, and the experience wasn&#39;t even bad. She patted her ass, noting how different a shape it was from before as little squeaky puffs of air continued to leak out---even now she wasn&#39;t fully empty, and had a feeling it&#39;d never truly stop.<br />
She wasn&#39;t quite sure what her feelings on her vocal behind were either; she came in wanting a leaky ass, but came out with an extra stinky one instead. Even now the foul wind filled the air, making Rachel teasingly wave the air in front of her. She felt a grotesque sense of pride in being so big and gassy, like she&#39;d take up space everywhere she goes whether she wanted to or not; it&#39;s hard to ignore a girl as big, loud, and stinky as her.<br />
Her new body was already so embarrassing without needing diapers, she was seriously starting to regret her decision. However, now that she had time to actually explore her new body, she realized she had more positives than negatives. Of course, that&#39;s just when she&#39;s alone and can enjoy her new self in private; no doubt being in public will be an entirely different picture. Rachel felt dread in stomach at just the thought of anyone seeing her like this, groaning when that dread turns into a nasty sputtering fart. She blushes as she tries to hold her butt together in some semblance of trying to stop her gas, only succeeding in turning the sputter into a high pitched quake; her face blushes further when she imagines someone seeing her like this.<br />
But that&#39;s soemthing to worry about for the future, right now she can enjoy exploring and cleaning her new body. Reaching down, she reached underneath her apron of a belly, a little curious what lied below. Lifting it forced Rachel to push out another bellowing, embarrassing fart---forcing her to squat slightly and push in effort from the force of it---but she found what she was looking for. She tried looking over her gut in a futile endeavor that made Rachel realize she can no longer even see her toes. Grumbling in embarrassment, she opened the shower curtain enough to view herself through the mirror and lifted her belly. <br />
She winced as further gas bubbles were stirred up, causing painful bloating to spread through her tummy. She almost dropped it from the pressure, stumbling a bit as she never felt a more desperate need to fart in her life. She could see her face turning red from effort as she involuntarily squatted to push out a fog horn of a fart, loud enough that she&#39;s afraid it might wake her mom but having no choice but to empty her tummy of all that horrid pain. Her cheeks jiggled as a guttural belch ripped from her mouth without warning as she tried to look down, and finally could see what she was looking for. <br />
She wasn&#39;t expecting to see her crouch covered by another flab of fat (the fupa, she thinks it&#39;s called. She remembers reading about it when she was younger and being a little grossed out; never in her life did she think she&#39;d have one of her own); she was expecting the yellow liquid running down her thighs even less. Her eyes widened with a gasp that turned into a surprise burp, causing her to accidentally drop her belly. She saw in horror as it jiggled violently, already feeling nauseous from the massive spike in pain and pressure. <br />
She looked down at her feet to see that yes, yellow liquid was flowing into the drain. She was currently wetting herself, and she had no clue; she honestly shouldn&#39;t be surprised, given that she drank a potion that made her incontinent. That was the only observation she could make before cramps wracked her body. <br />
She was forced to brace both hands against the shower wall, actually whimpering in pain as the pressure swelled to an unbearable degree. Rachel spent the next several minutes doing nothing but pushing out monstrous, humiliating, minute long farts. Her outburst before was nothing compared to this, her ass clapping to the force as she moaned loudly into each one. Every time one would end, the next would follow up, and Rachel couldn&#39;t do anything except focus on ridding her poor intestines of their funk. If Rachel&#39;s mom wasn&#39;t awake before, Rachel had a feeling she would have to be now. She lost track of time by the moment her gastric storm lessened; not ended, &#39;lessoned&#39;. She let out a moan of relief, tears in her eyes from such an intense experience...and the absolutely rank smell in the air. She still grunted as continued to loudly break wind, but was able to move again. She breathed the tainted air with heavy breaths, somehow feeling exhausted just from relieving herself. <br />
She looked at her reflection again, red from her ears to her double chin...and laughed. She couldn&#39;t help it; she was just so explosively gassy that gassy felt like too weak of a word. Jupitar came to mind, and felt weirdly appropriate as a descriptor: the largest planet in the solar system, a gas giant, and always had a gassy storm raging inside. She kept laughing, little quacks of gas escaping with each chuckle. It was horridly embarrassing, but damn was it an experience! She quickly finished cleaning herself and exited the shower, still chuckling as toots still escaped her. <br />
After thoroughly drying herself (at least she hopes it was thorough, she&#39;s still new to this whole &#39;being fat&#39; thing), she attempted to wrap the towel around her to preserve modesty as best she could. Her breasts had gotten a major upgrade, which unfortunately made modesty significantly more difficult. She tried not to wrap it too tight as to not upset her stomach again (god forbid her mother catches her like this cause of her farts), but found that the towel wouldn&#39;t even wrap around her fully. With another embarrassed grumble, she held the towel to her chest and crouch as best she could before exiting to her room.</p>
