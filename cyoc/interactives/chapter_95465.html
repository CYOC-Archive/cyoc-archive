<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The room fell silent as Melissa held the dice in her hand. Scott and Kat exchanged worried glances, while also attempting to hide their attraction as Cal brought himself to another orgasm.<br />
<br />
Scott was the first to speak up. &quot;Hey Cal, are you okay man?&quot; he asked tentatively.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does it - mmm - look like I&#39;m - aah - okay?&quot; Cal said, struggling to bring himself under control as his hands betrayed his commands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Melissa, you better just roll,&quot; Kat said dejectedly.<br />
<br />
Melissa nodded quickly, snapping out of her haze. She tossed the dice out in front of her, and was surprised as they stayed in midair, spinning in place. A card drew itself from the pile prematurely, which made them gasp.<br />
<br />
Before the dice have landed, you must choose<br />
Who will be transformed this turn<br />
If changing another, you do refuse<br />
A second change, you shall earn<br />
<br />
Melissa looked around the room with all three of her eyes, and saw that everyone was frozen where they sat. Kat looking as though she was going to say something, Scott with a surprised look on his face, and Cal with his hands still roaming across his body. She looked at all of them and how many changes each of them had already accrued. Then she looked back down at herself. While these changes have been unusual and perverted, she couldn&#39;t force someone else to take a change for her. Besides, even though she didn&#39;t want to admit it, something deep inside of her was enjoying the way her body was transforming.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll take the transformations myself.&quot; <br />
<br />
Very well.<br />
<br />
As the narrator uttered these words, time seemed to catch up and the dice fell upon the board. 2 and 6. However, her figurine moved along the board without Melissa&#39;s hand. It moved more than eight spaces, ending up a full twelve spaces from where she started the turn.<br />
<br />
A reward for your boldness.<br />
<br />
The board declared this before drawing two more cards. Only one of them was read to begin with.<br />
<br />
One of your least favorite aspects at the start of this game<br />
Grow an awe-striking rear-end that puts all of them to shame<br />
<br />
Melissa gasped as she felt her lower half begin to shift, her already generous butt beginning to grow as her hips widened considerably. The changes continued, the pleasure making her erection almost painfully hard. Meanwhile, the second card was read.<br />
<br />
Another special gift, much like your third eye<br />
Even without wings, you take off and fly<br />
<br />
Melissa wasn&#39;t listening to the second card however, the effects of the physical changes too burdensome to ignore. Her pillowy rear looked to be a pillow in its own right, and yet ass-flesh was still spilling forth from beneath her. Her hips had just now stopped their growth, easily more than two and a half times as wide as her thin waist. From her perky breasts and slightly broadened shoulders, her figure curved inwards towards a petite yet powerful six-pack of abs, which curved out into her immense hips and rear end.<br />
<br />
As the changes finished, Melissa got to her feet and attempted to look behind her. She didn&#39;t have to look far to find her massive ass, sticking out behind her almost a full foot and looking like someone had stuffed a melon inside each cheek. Her ass jiggled relentlessly, however beneath all of the soft flesh existed a thick layer of muscles. Her wide hips created more than a bit of a gap between her muscular thighs, however her large balls that swung pendulously underneath her equally large member did its best to cover it up.<br />
<br />
Melissa tentatively reached back and squeezed one of her ass cheeks, feeling it&#39;s large size. &quot;Wasn&#39;t there another change?&quot; she asked, unable to remember what the narrator had said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, why don&#39;t you look down further,&quot; Scott said, his eyes wide.<br />
<br />
Melissa took his advice and looked down towards her feet.<br />
<br />
They were hovering six inches off the floor.<br />
<br />
Melissa screamed and suddenly landed back on the floor, causing her ass to unleash an earthquake from the sudden movement. &quot;What the fuck was that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit, you can actually fly now,&quot; Kat said in disbelief. &quot;That&#39;s so fucking cool! I&#39;m so jealous!&quot;<br />
<br />
Cal continued to moan as he brought himself to yet another orgasm, after giving up on trying to stop it.<br />
<br />
Melissa looked down at herself and concentrated, and without any trouble she was able to lift herself off the ground once more. She floated in the air, spinning herself around and moving a bit around the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, I&#39;m going to have to get used to this,&quot; Melissa said, curious about her new ability. After a few more tricks, Melissa flipped herself horizontally and lowered herself close to the floor, staying a few inches above the ground. She propped her head up on one of her strong arms, despite not having anything under it to support her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Definitely going to have fun with this later, it&#39;s a shame we can&#39;t go outside,&quot; she said, looking every bit casual as she hovered above the ground. On the board in front of them, Melissa&#39;s piece grew a proportional rear, and her figure detached itself from its base and began to float above it. Melissa was now two ahead of Cal, taking the lead.<br />
<br />
Scott snatched up the dice, and after doing a quick survey of the other players, shook his head incredulously. Already they had all changed so much, and they all still had more to go.</p>
