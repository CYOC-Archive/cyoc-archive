<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“BUCKKKAWWW!”<br />
<br />
The transformative jams that had just filled the room were now replaced with the shrill caw of a newly minted anthro hen who was agonizing to lay her first egg.  Ryan didn’t have time to ponder the fact that the sound seemed to be coming from far closer to him than it should have as the broken shards of reality began to rain down onto the floor.  <br />
<br />
It was then the air in the middle of the room cleared up, leaving Ryan staring at something completely unexpected.  Before reality had shattered, Ryan was looking down on the wizard-turned chicken girl, who had been squatting as she tried to lay an egg.  But now, Ryan found himself looking past a yellow blob that now occupied the bottom middle of his vision – and which decidedly had not been there before – and up at the wizard, who otherwise looked the same as he had prior to Ryan’s transformative jam session.<br />
<br />
‘Why isn’t the wizard a chicken?  What’s that in front of my face?  Why am I so low to the ground?’  Those thoughts had begun taking shape in Ryan’s confused mind when a flood of pain spilled out from his stomach, silencing anything that his mind tried to focus on other than the instant agony that he now found himself in.<br />
<br />
The sensations came quickly.  Ryan could feel himself squatting down with his legs spread as far apart as was chickenly possible, all while his fingers pressed into soft feathers covering his bulging stomach and a nub of flesh just above his butt waddled back and forth.  Then there was the pain – underneath the thin flesh that his fingers were pressed into, fire surged through powerful muscles that were clenching down.  And behind that pain was the pressure.<br />
<br />
Every fiber of muscle, string of tendon, and globule of fat that ran from the bottom of Ryan’s ribs to the top of his hips was stretched taunt around a zone of pure, unrelenting pressure.  He could feel it pressing against the front of his spine and then extending deeper until it entered his hips.  There it entered his hips, where the unrelenting pressure met with solid bone, forcing the tender flesh in between the two to be crushed between them.<br />
<br />
But it continued even lower, until Ryan could feel a gap in the flesh just in front of his asshole – right where his cock should be – spread wide by a hard, smooth object.  Every pulse of the muscles in his stomach forced it lower and lower, which forced the circle of flesh in Ryan’s crotch to spread wider and wider, turning it into a ring of excruciating lava with every firm push.<br />
<br />
Ryan tried to stand from the squat but found that he couldn’t as every muscle in his body was painfully locked in tension - all straining to push down on whatever was inside of him.  His mouth began to open, though instead of the soft lips that he expected, what instead opened was a hard beak that seemed to stick off the front of his face.  Tongue extending from his mouth, Ryan could feel sound reverberate through his throat as it vibrated against his beak – “BUCKKKAWWW!”<br />
<br />
That sound.  That… caw.  Were it not for the fact that Ryan had felt it echoing through his throat, he might have thought that it had come from someone else.  It wasn’t the sound of a human.  No, it was the sound of a hen crying out in agony – and it had come from his throat.<br />
<br />
Looking up at the wizard, Ryan saw him holding onto his sides, doubled over as he laughed.  “Oh… I’m… I’m sorry.  I didn’t mean to… ahahaha… I didn’t mean to laugh.  It… ahaha… it seems like you’re going to be busy for a while, so I’ll take some time to compose myself…”  With that, the still laughing wizard plucked the headphones off of Ryan’s head and walked into the back room.  <br />
<br />
Ryan looked at the wizard’s retreating backside.  He opened his mouth as fleeting thoughts entered his mind.  What was happening?  Why was he in so much pain?  What was inside of him?  But all that came out was a frightened “BUCKKAW!”<br />
<br />
Another wave of agony washed through Ryan’s body as the muscles in his stomach continued to bear down on the thing inside of him.  With every second that passed he could feel it slide deeper and deeper inside of him, before pressing into the tight hole in Ryan’s crotch.  That burning ring of flesh needed to grow ever wider to allow the object to continue it’s descent, but no matter how hard Ryan’s muscles pushed, the ring would stretch no further.<br />
<br />
His fingers lifted out of the feathers covering his stomach, as both of Ryan’s hands shot to his crotch.  There, he pressed one of his hands against the object pushing out of him, only to realize that the pain coming from his body failed to encapsulate just how large it actually was. <br />
<br />
What filled the palm of his hand was rock hard yet, at the same time, had a lubricated smoothness to it.  Then there was the fact that it was already protruding a few millimeters out of the overstretch ring of flesh that surrounded it.  With one hand still cupping the object, Ryan tried to use his other hand to grab at the flesh of his new vagina to pull it apart – only to find that it was so tightly stretched around the object inside of him that there was no way for him to grip onto it.<br />
<br />
His body was in so much agony that, for a minute, he considered trying to fall forward onto his hands and knees.  But the moment the thought entered his head, it was replaced by a strange instinct that told him that squatting was the best position for a hen like him to lay in – and that needed to push.<br />
<br />
That latter instinct to push was so bizarre given that Ryan’s body was already on fire as it strained to its limit in an attempt to do exactly that.  Still, that instinct was so overwhelming that Ryan mentally reached out to his pained muscles and tried to add to the clench.<br />
<br />
The effect on his body was immediate – where previously the muscles of his stomach had felt like they were at their limit, they now went into overdrive with a commensurate wave of fresh agony.  Clenching and straining and squeezing, burning lightning surged through Ryan’s belly as the object pressed out of his vagina and down into his palm.<br />
<br />
The delicate, tightly stretched flesh of Ryan’s chicken cunt had previously felt like it was at it’s limit, but as the object pressed down, the flesh began to groan and strain as it felt like it was ripping apart.  <br />
<br />
“BUCKAWWW!”  Ryan cawed out terror as his body told him that it was about to split open, but despite every nerve in his cunt screaming that it was tearing itself apart, the flesh parted ever so slightly, allowing the object another fraction of a millimeter of descent.  <br />
<br />
As Ryan continued to amplify his body’s own pushing, the muscles of his stomach began to grow tired.  With each ounce of mental effort rapidly resulting in less physical exertion, Ryan tried to relax.  In this, he was only partially successful as his muscles continued at the previous level of effort, leaving Ryan panting as his body burned and the object remained lodged firmly, and painfully, in his tight vagina.</p>
