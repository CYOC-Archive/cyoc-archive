<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Zoe stood up confidently.<br />
Zoe – I&#39;ll do it.<br />
Lucy – Now hold on a second…<br />
Zoe – No. Look, I&#39;m the most agile of anyone here, the hardest to catch. You are not changing my mind.<br />
Jeff – Okay, I know you well enough to know you don&#39;t change your mind easily. But I&#39;m coming too.<br />
They nodded at each other, it was decided.<br />
Jenny and Megan were no where in sight when they carefully opened the door, but the house was not the same one they remembered. It was not only the floor, the walls and ceiling were covered in the substance too, this transparent ooze. <br />
They did their best to avoid touching it, know it&#39;s effects but they had no shoes so some of it always on them. The kitchen was worse, the ooze was dripping from the ceiling everywhere, but as long as they were fast enough they could just take a shower after. In the fridge, all the meat was gone, but the fruits and vegetables were intact, they quickly gathered it while being showered in the slime.<br />
Zoe was already starting to get flustered and Jeff&#39;s hard on to throb, but they decided it was a good idea to fight it and grab as much food as they could. They didn&#39;t know how long this would last or if they would have another chance like this.<br />
Finally, they decided it was enough, and prepared to walk upstairs with the food and the keys that they collected on their way there. Unfortunately Zoe slipped on her way out, falling in a large puddle. Jeff was quick to push her out but her wet body was now rubbing on his and his mind was starting to break apart.<br />
Zoe – Jeff, I&#39;m so horny…<br />
Jeff – Zoe, we have to f-fight it.<br />
Despite the worlds coming out of his mouth, his hands were cupping her ass, while his fingers wandered around both her asshole and pussy. Zoe didn&#39;t care about much anymore, being or not a slug was not something her mind could even process, she wanted to get laid right here and now. <br />
Jeff never saw the kiss coming and he couldn&#39;t fight it, he reciprocated immediately. He could feel Zoe&#39;s wet skin rubbing on his, sending waves of pleasure to his brain. It wasn&#39;t long before they were on the ground, his cock inside her impossibly wet pussy. Zoe already had her first orgasm but the more Jeff went in and out of her, more and stronger orgasms came. When she briefly opened her eyes she could see in different directions at the same time, and one of the things she saw was her new cock pumping it&#39;s first load on her belly as her legs fused together. She was scared but the pleasure was too intense and she wanted more. Her new tail coiled around her bothers legs as she explored his mouth with an extended tongue.<br />
Jeff never stopped fucking her, even after he saw what she had become, he was too drunk in lust, much like her, but he also felt something different, a sense of pride in her transformation. He pushed those feelings aside so he could focused of his climax, which filled Zoe&#39;s pussy. It wan not like her had a choice to pull out, Zoe was holding him tight, but his clarity was returning and so was guilt.<br />
Jeff – Zoe, I&#39;m so sorry I...I…<br />
His sister looked him in the eyes with a calm and loving expression, she said it was okay, she didn&#39;t care anymore. Whether she was human or a slug didn&#39;t matter to her as she was still his sister and loved him. Jeff got some hard Whitney vibes from her, but she swore she didn&#39;t want to turn Lucy and Jeff, she just was happy they had this experience together. He thought hard about leaving her behind, but what if the neighbors came back and did something to screw her mind even more. No, he couldn&#39;t allow that to happen, Lucy was going to be pissed but she would understand in time.<br />
Megan and Jenny were still no where to be found when they went upstairs, but the screaming match that started when Lucy saw what had happened and refused to let her inside brought both of them from outside of Grace&#39;s room, where they were still sleeping. In a panic Jeff forced the door open and locked himself and Zoe inside, while Lucy ran and locked herself in the bathroom crying.<br />
Zoe – Is she going to be okay?<br />
Grace – I don&#39;t know…<br />
Jenny – Hey Zoe, why don&#39;t you and Grace unlock this door? Come on, we are sisters now.<br />
Zoe -Fuck off bitch, I may be a slug, but my only family is inside this room.<br />
Megan – Leave them Jen, we have all the time in the world.<br />
Whitney – Hey, what did I miss? Open this door.</p>
