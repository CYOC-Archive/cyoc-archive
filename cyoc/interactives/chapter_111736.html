<br />
<br />
      Desperate  for options you decide that the best chance for survival was to go north. Enven rarely talked to you about demons so you have to worryingly rely on your demonic knowledge you&#39;ve gained from those strange dreams you had. Demons tend to stick to either blood, necro, or fire magic so going to the icy north would Atleast take care of one of those categories. This still was a hunch though. <br />
<br />
    Enven despite his kindness and generosity was still harsh in some areas. He refused to let you see any local maps nor let you know the name of the continent to were on. This had frustrated and confused you at first but you decided to let it go. It&#39;s not like Enven could trust you anyway.<br />
<br />
           Still in just your sleep ware that Enven had given you, you start your journey north, relying on the sun for your navigation. You hiked at a quick pace for nearly six hours, your demon body giving much more stamina than the average human. Though even you had your limits. Tired and with sore legs you drop to the ground and sit against the trunk of a thick tree, wanting to get some energy back. You sigh and try and relax. You had been tense for a while now, fearful that a demon or hunter would come out of nowhere and kill you. You were in an unfamiliar place so you had to keep watch. <br />
<br />
   As you thought that your thoughts drifted to memories of your old life. If someone had told you your situation back then, you probably would&#39;be thought they were crazy and leave.<br />
Who could blame you though?<br />
<br />
        You had a home, a family, a well paying job, sure you were stressed a lot at times but it was nice. You only wanted to take a relaxing walk through the park, then suddenly everything had shifted and gone hazy. Your old world disappeared and was replaced by this strange one. You had traveled across worlds, possibly even dimensions and in the process turned into a demon wolf with a sentient snake penis! <br />
<br />
   The only two people who had given you kindness either decided to get rid of you or died by some cruel demon. <br />
<br />
   Now you were here, in an infinite cycle of running away. You give another deep sigh. Closing your eyes you smell the fresh air around you. Your sense of smell was much more advance than your human form. You could nearly taste it as you sensed the air quality. Here in this world, the air was fresh and clean, even in the cities. This was a vast difference from your old world. Here, this world preferring magic and the arcane over science and technology was cleaner and more pure. Not to say it didn&#39;t have its downsides. Demons weren&#39;t your favorite thing in the world, though in some ways you were almost lucky. What gamer or fantasy nerd wouldn&#39;t die to go to a world like this?  A world where gods, angels, demons, maybe even dragons existed.<br />
<br />
         For the first time in months you smiled. Enven had been kind but he wasn&#39;t true. If he had survived you had a hunch you would&#39;ve  learned secrets about him you&#39;d wish you didn&#39;t know. <br />
<br />
     Then as you thought to yourself, you felt a strange cold fill your body. Normally you didn&#39;t feel cold due to your furred body, but now this cold was strange and forgein... almost artificial. The coldness grew stronger and your body almost went numb. You open your eyes and see the forest that was once vivid and green turn into a icy wonderland. The grass and ground had become icy permafrost and the trees were turned into popsicles.<br />
<br />
   What had caused this? Who had caused this?<br />
<br />
     You concentrate and using the magic skills that Enven had taught you, you feel something. A powerful magical energy source nearby. You weren&#39;t trained enough to learn more about it, but you could tell it was coming closer by the second.  <br />
<br />
           You did your best to use the magical skills Enven taught you to defend yourself. However the ice along with your inexperience with using magic made it difficult to even use the slightest amount of nature magic. You didn&#39;t want to use your blood magic however, if you did that, you would feel as if you had betrayed Enven in a way.<br />
<br />
     &quot;Well, well, well. What a weak little demon I found. Are you one of the ones who destroyed that pesky light mage? I&#39;m not saying I liked him but he did do a good job of clearing rats like you.&quot; A cold feminine voice said, coming from nowhere. You could tell that this voice was clearly the magic energy source you feel right now. You had only been used to sensing Enven&#39;s magic aura but this stranger was possibly far more powerful. <br />
<br />
       Afraid to speak you keep quiet, not sure how this mysterious voice would react. She however picked up on this.<br />
<br />
    &quot;What a shy demon you are, and with unique fashion sense too.&quot; She said, mentioning the sleepware you were in. &quot;Anyway will you answer my question or not? Which demon lord do you belong to? Is it Grix? Or possibly Fanaus&quot; she said, impatience starting to sprout in her voice.<br />
<br />
           You didn&#39;t know any of those names nor who she was but you figured you might as well answer.<br />
<br />
    &quot;I&#39;m not owned by a demon lord, I was well...a guest of Enven for a while before the demons attacked his temple.&quot; you reply to frosty thin air, not sure where the voice was coming from.<br />
<br />
     &quot;Interesting... don&#39;t say guest so strongly either, Enven was known for his experiments on demons so don&#39;t flatter yourself. But don&#39;t lie. Who is your demon lord? I know you have one, those who don&#39;t never survive.&quot; she says.<br />
<br />
     Her words frightened you, not because of her but because of what this voice said. Experimentation on demons? Were you right all along? Was Enven secretly using you for some unknown purpose? What reason did this voice have to lie to you for?<br />
   <br />
    &quot;No... well, I only survived for so long because I was in Enven&#39;s care, but who are you? What do you want with me?&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
     &quot;Hmmm... your quite a strange demon, no demon lord, your quite polite even if it does stem from fear, and your even being grateful for someone else&#39;s kindness. Wait a minute....&quot; the voice pauses as if a revelation had just come to it. You don&#39;t hear from it for several minutes and for a second you consider trying to run away. Then in front of your eyes you see something happening in the air. The frosty mist in the air was changing, growing. It started collecting itself in the air, forming a humanoid shape. Then it happened. Fog became flesh, mist became skin and suddenly hovering a few inches off of the ground was possibly the most elegant woman you have ever seen. A slender woman, with pale blue skin, thick grey hair and wearing a ornate light blue dress appeared. Her eyes were electric blue with a mixture of arrogance and beauty. <br />
<br />
    Her pale lips smirked at you. <br />
<br />
        &quot;Demon, you are weak, you are nothing compared to me and mages who spent their lives dedicated to magic, becoming much more than human.. But... even you have a use....&quot;<br />
<br />
          You had a bad feeling about this.</p>
