<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sarah&#39;s mind seemed to race over dozens of questions as she and Malice began walking along to explore what the Brown farm had become since the Animalia Virus outbreak had changed things, uplifting various animals to where they became more human like and in one case seeing Abby infected. Sarah had seen enough from the news to know that the farm had changed a lot and was becoming something more of either a massed communal farm or a separate town growing alongside the main town as the laboratory that had accidentally created the Animalia Virus and the government sought to study how a non-human society functioned and if it could function with human society. From what Abby had told her at lunch about Animalia, and its ten edicts, Sarah felt that it was functioning rather well and provided some human group didn&#39;t decide to just kill off the Animalians, Animalia would function fairly well alongside humanity.<br />
<br />
&quot;And now I&#39;M part of it!&quot; Sarah thought to herself as looked down to her bountiful white furred breasts and her raised paw-like hand in front her, &quot;Me and Abby both... Friends forever and through everything. Thick and thin!&quot;<br />
<br />
She also looked over to her former pet, Mary Alice, or Malice as she appeared to prefer the shorter nickname. Sarah smiled to Malice who smiled back as an unstated bond of sisterhood seemed to be growing between them. Sarah had always wanted siblings, but her mom and dad never thought about it after Sarah was born and now it was probably too late to give Sarah a younger sibling. That was partially why they&#39;d bought Mary Alice in the first place. But now, with both of them strong and beautiful Siberian Husky women, Sarah had a sister in Malice. That did make her feel very good, and that bond was more than enough to insure that she had no shame in suckling from Malice and becoming a anthropomorphic husky.<br />
<br />
And the sights they could see as they could walk around the farm also looked interesting. She remembered seeing the houses that had been built closer to the barn, stables, and the main Brown house for the uplifted cattle and horses that had been built. She remembered seeing something similar that was nearby, but was long and narrow by comparison, which Sarah figured was for the uplifted chickens. The sights of the various uplifted animals with their strong and even sexy bodies was also very clear and had furthered Sarah&#39;s opinion that it was all &quot;cool.&quot; Animalia wasn&#39;t a threat and wasn&#39;t bad to Sarah, and that also helped support her easy acceptance of joining it. And since she and Malice weren&#39;t as big as the uplifted cattle or Abby and the other uplifted horses, they wouldn&#39;t need all the other &quot;adjustments&quot; that Abby needed at school and so on.<br />
<br />
&quot;This place is big,&quot; Malice commented as they walked along and looked to see all the changes that had occurred to the Brown farm, including the spots that the two of them had already seen when they went to find Abby.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Sarah nodded, &quot;Abby&#39;s dad had a lot of land that was set aside for grazing and even for hiking and horseback riding. Me, Jessica, Sophie, and a few of Abby&#39;s other friends always came out here to go horseback riding from time to time.  It included a lot areas that were rather &quot;wild&quot; if you know what I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And now they&#39;re expanding the farm part of it,&quot; Malice commented as the two of them quietly walked through an area where they had gotten fruit trees planted. For the moment the trees were small and wouldn&#39;t be ready to put out a crop, yet, but they were arranged in neat rows and would have enough space to grow strong and healthy. &quot;What about the wild areas?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m pretty sure that area, while Mr. Brown still legally owns the land, is what&#39;s being converted into the rest of the Animalia settlement,&quot; Sarah commented as she looked over to Malice as they walked, &quot;thus why the occasional &quot;trenches&quot; that we&#39;ve gone by.&quot;<br />
<br />
The trenches had been filled in, but were a clear sign of the work done over the summer to make sure that Animalia had running indoor plumbing, and thankfully paid for at the government&#39;s expense. Sarah remembered a few arguments made on the news, but so far, things had remained positive in that regard. That presented some hope to Sarah that in general things would be fine, but there was one potential negative that clung to the back of her mind, and regardless of how good it felt to be Malice&#39;s equal and to be a part of Animalia, Sarah couldn&#39;t shake that potential negative from her mind, and that was how her parents might react.<br />
<br />
They might accept an accident that got her infected and transformed, but she found it doubtful that they&#39;d accept her maturing into her present form, which would have meant a second dose of the virus. Her mother would surely take that as consciously trying to join Animalia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that sounds good,&quot; Malice commented, enjoying all the sights and smells, which she&#39;d never seen before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Sarah agreed, &quot;and hopefully... mom and dad end up okay with all of this... I mean... both of us will need a new wardrobe. People generally don&#39;t go around naked unless its in private or at a nudist colony.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The clothes itch,&quot; Malice commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;My old clothes?&quot; Sarah answered with a shrug, &quot;probably because they weren&#39;t designed for fur. Abby told me a lot at lunch today that some clothing company did a lot of research after Animalia was &quot;created&quot; in terms of finding special clothes that our fellow Animalians can wear without major irritation. We&#39;ll need to talk to the government guys who Animalia&#39;s leaders to get those clothes that we can wear.&quot;<br />
<br />
Malice nodded and looked over to see that Sarah had taken a rather distant look. Her muzzle pointed out toward river, which they could both hear flowing in the distance, and her ears tentatively going from perked to pulled back as Sarah thought over things.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay, sis?&quot; Malice asked, placing a hand on Sarah&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Sarah sighed, &quot;Just thinking over how mom and dad will react to all this... When we came here, you looked more like a teen and weren&#39;t that much bigger than I was, not to mention that I was still human. Yet now... we&#39;re both taller than most human women, definitely buffer then they are and with bigger breasts, wider hips, and a better butt than ANY member of my family. That&#39;s a lot of changes that my mom won&#39;t react well to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... it was an accident,&quot; Malice assured her, &quot;You did trip.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know... but how do I explain the second dose that let me grow into this?&quot; Sarah spoke and gestured to her new form, &quot;I know why... your milk tasted so good and it fueled the part of me that was very impressed with what Abby became and wanted to share in it. It was so good that I had to have more and just couldn&#39;t stop myself... But mom would say I should have more self control.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe, but when I drank that milk in the barn... I too found it too good not to drink,&quot; Malice commented, &quot;I don&#39;t think anyone could stop it once it starts. Things just taste so good... and the growth in strength and power only pushes one on. So... while maybe you could have had more self control, it&#39;s understandable to want more as it happens because it felt that good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah looked over to watch Malice wag her tail, making her wag her own in response.<br />
<br />
&quot;And it made me feel glad to have my sister on equal footing with me,&quot; Malice smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;That might work with me,&quot; Sarah sighed after a moment, &quot;but what about you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... you DID tell me not to drink any water,&quot; Malice pointed out, remembering Sarah&#39;s instructions when they first arrived when Malice went looking for something to drink, &quot;and in my mind... I was afraid that more infected water might cause trouble... and well, I suppose you could say, I was following my sister&#39;s instructions. I was told not to drink any water, so I didn&#39;t. We can leave out my overhearing what the uplifted cattle were talking about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose,&quot; Sarah said slowly as they approached the river and looked down into it.<br />
<br />
The water was fairly clear and gentle enough that Sarah could see hers and Malice&#39;s reflection in the water. She could see two beautiful and well muscled anthro huskies. Their muscle wasn&#39;t to a point where they took away from their femininity, and one had long human hair that framed around her black and white fur. Both were naked, but it took a bit of effort to really see their nipples or the exact folds of their vaginas through their fur. Sarah found her new form to be quite beautiful, but knew it was very different from how she used to look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully mom and dad accept us,&quot; Sarah commented, &quot;or at least accept our changes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Malice nodded and held her sister to her. She knew Sarah would have some unease with her mother&#39;s response, as she had the same feelings to a degree. She liked Sarah&#39;s parents almost as much as she loved Sarah. In that, she feared not having the love of Sarah&#39;s parents as much as Sarah feared losing her parent&#39;s love. However, Malice made sure to keep her hopes high, as she&#39;d never seen Julia Wesley, Sarah&#39;s mother, or Thomas Wesley, Sarah&#39;s father, be mean or cruel to Sarah or to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;It may be tough,&quot; Malice held Sarah to her, &quot;but I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll love us all the same. Come on... let&#39;s go see if we can find someone that can help with clothing that won&#39;t itch.&quot;</p>
