<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Vince watched Josh storm off to the cabin after that ballsy little weasel kid actually talked to him. Marten he corrected himself mentally. He had always kind of known Josh was a bit of a self-centered prick, but when his usual bossy antics instead came out of a fourteen year old they seemed less like a man who wanted control and more like a, well, prick. How had he put up with it?<br />
<br />
Vince shook his head and headed back to his own cabin for a little rest and relaxation before his next lesson. Waking up like this was like some sort of dream come true. Viola was not happy with her life, Josh was stringing her along, they had met in college and ten years later he still hadn&#39;t proposed, and as she got older she thought it would be harder and harder to get back into dating so she just stayed. Then she woke up as a two-hundred twenty pound rhino brimming with muscle and eleven years knocked off his age.<br />
<br />
He stepped into his cabin and stripped off his shirt, tossing it aside before dropping into his bunk. His hand ran over the sculpted muscles of his torso. No offense to Soren, who he knew was a good friend and teammate of his, which was a surprise, but a pleasant one. The bear and that jokester of a possum seemed to get along well. He had to admit he even thought Jack was kind of funny. But he was not going to tie himself down again. It seemed like many of the counselors were pairing off, but he wanted to fly solo.<br />
<br />
He shoved down his shorts and grabbed his thick cock in his hand, giving it a few slow strokes. He had no worry his roommate was going to walk in, he was off spending time with Val no doubt. That was another weird couple, cute, but weird. No. Vince had plans for this body. He was going to go back to school and sleep his way through half the college if he could. He was going to enjoy being single and free.<br />
<br />
He snorted softly as he continued to stroke himself. In the pleasurable haze, Viola disappeared. There was only just Vince - jock, stud, ladies&#39; man, mans&#39; man - it didn&#39;t matter. He was young and had years ahead of him to enjoy himself. Though he did idly wonder if he could talk on of his pairs of friends into a threesome before the weekend ended. It would probably be easier with Heath and Val, he knew Heath was a kinky little hedgehog. The thought of it tipped him over the edge, and warm ribbons of spunk landed across his muscular chest. Oh yeah, this was the life.<br />
<br />
---------------<br />
<br />
Elsewhere in the camp Alex looked up as the trees rustled a bit. There was the first, and it was just after lunch time on the first day. He jotted a quick note in his clipboard. He was certain six more would be on his list by dinner.<br />
<br />
----------------<br />
<br />
Josh trudged along the field after Martin. He had no idea how he had let the other teen talk him into this. It was the right thing to do, of course, he had been a bit of a dick to these three for no other reason than they were easy targets. His dad would have kicked his ass if he found out half of what he had been doing, not really, his father wouldn&#39;t kick anyone&#39;s ass deserved or not. As that thought passed through his head, Josh stumbled a little. His dad he pictured as a stern-looking stag, a doctor who was really quite kind. He&#39;d be disappointed in his son and for some reason that hurt for a moment.<br />
<br />
Josh shook his head. No. He was not going to give into this place. His father was a useless dick who sat around and drank away their money. But he couldn&#39;t bring up that hated face with that thought, just the stern seeming but kind hearted stag he admired.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing with him, Martin?&quot; Came one accusatory voice. Jared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Josh has something he wants to say.&quot; Martin put a hand on Josh&#39;s shoulder and he looked up at both Jared and Ricky, then stuck out his hand. The two stared at it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;ve been a dick. You didn&#39;t deserve it.&quot; The words were a little dragged. Josh, the old Josh, was not used to making apologies or admitting he was wrong. That he was doing so know stuck in his throat, but it was getting harder to resist the impulses of the young deer.<br />
<br />
&quot;And...?&quot; Martin prompted.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I hope you guys can forgive me.&quot; Ricky took the hand and shook it, Jared just shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever, man.&quot; The tiger said casually. Josh frowned a little, the tiger had more right than anyone to be pissed. Then. &quot;Anyone up for some two on two.&quot; He nodded to the bit of paved area with a basketball hoop set up near the office.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good.&quot; Martin said as he started after his two friends who were headed in that direction. Josh just stared at them, completely dumbfounded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Coming?&quot; Jared said with a look over his shoulder to Josh. &quot;Two on two needs four.&quot; He motioned along himself and his two friends then to Josh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right.&quot; The deer said and trotted to catch up. Just like that? These three were willing to just get over it just like that? He suddenly felt even more ashamed he had been bothering these guys. Hell, they were probably going through some of the same confusion as him and he had just been making it worse. Still, he caught up to them and tried to forget what he had done, which also meant forgetting some other things.<br />
<br />
------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh look!&quot; Jack nudged Soren. &quot;The whole crush crew is together. Aww.. that&#39;s kind of cute.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Crush crew?&quot; Soren asked as he looked up from his lunch and towards the four campers. The bear did arch a brow at seeing Josh there, and the handshake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Crush crew.&quot; Jack confirmed. &quot;Not so much Ricky, but he seems to be a package deal with them. Jared&#39;s got a thing for me, though he seemed more focused on Ricky, now, thank god. I don&#39;t think I could deal with a camper trying to kiss me again. That Josh kid seems like an ass but he practically twitches every time Vince walks by. I can&#39;t blame him, really. And Martin? Well, he checks out your ass almost as much as I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Soren made a choking sound at that, washing down the bite of sandwich suddenly stuck in his throat with a chug of water. &quot;Dude. Not funny.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? It&#39;s true. I check out your ass a lot, so I notice who else is staring. It&#39;s a really nice ass. Best ass in camp. I might use it as a pillow tonight if you don&#39;t watch out.&quot; He could tell he was making the bear squirm and was enjoying every minute of it.<br />
<br />
Soren reached out and grabbed Jack&#39;s paw. &quot;Okay, I get the point. You like my butt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you like my butt?&quot; Jack said with another of his teasing smiles.<br />
<br />
Jack....&quot; Soren started, giving the possum a bit of a look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wanna try it out tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
Soren choked again. Jack was impossible, but he found himself nodding at the question. He really did.</p>
