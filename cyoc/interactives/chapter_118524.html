<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
Jack slowly woke up, gently shaking his head as he tried to clear the muddy thoughts clogging his foggy mind.  He didn&#39;t shake it too hard - he had a splitting headache, not doubt part of the hangover resulting from the massive amount of alcohol he imbibed last night.  The sun shone brightly in the room, indicating it was well past daybreak.  By this time his father Joe must have already begun the morning chores.  Jack should have joined him, but he didn&#39;t feel like it.  He never felt like it, much to his father&#39;s disappointment.  Instead, Jack wanted to crawl back into bed and go back to sleep.  <br />
<br />
Jack would have gone back to sleep, too, if not for his desperate need to urinate.  He groaned as he sat up in bed.  The room seemed to spin around him, and he held what felt like an enormous head between his hands.  His cheeks felt fuzzy and Jack idly thought he needed to shave.  Not for his father, of course.  No, it was for the ladies.  They loved a smooth face.<br />
<br />
Jack stumbled as he stood up.  He couldn&#39;t seem to get his balance and had to lean against the wall.  It felt like his feet wouldn&#39;t bend right.  He didn&#39;t have time to ponder his problem too deeply.  He had to pee - bad!  He walked jerkily on the tips of his feet to the bathroom, bracing himself against the wall for balance. <br />
<br />
In the bathroom he went straight to the toilet.  He grabbed his large penis and aimed it at the bowl.  He was surprised by his lack of underwear. He didn&#39;t remember removing his clothes last night.  But then again, he didn&#39;t remember a lot of what happened last night.  His penis felt very large in his hands.  Jack was very well-endowed and he was very proud of the fact.  He probably enjoyed it more than the many girls that lined up to try out his legendary organ for themselves.  But today it felt even bigger than usual.  It was almost too large to hold in one hand.  Was it possible for a penis to keep growing?  He didn&#39;t know and really didn&#39;t care.  Bigger was better, after all.<br />
<br />
He was still pissing after several minutes.  He really must have drunk a lot of beer last night.  Still, he was impressed with the size of his bladder.  The loud sound of his steady hard stream of urine reminded him of the horses on the farm.  But even horses had a limit, and soon he was finished.  He didn&#39;t bother to flush.  His Dad could take care of that.  He just wanted to go back to bed and rest.  But he did want to wash his hands.  The urine had splattered everywhere.  He turned on the sink and washed his hands, staring up at the mirror in front of him.  When he saw his reflection his hands were quickly forgotten. He stared at shock in the face staring back at him in the mirror - at the long face that grew even longer as his jaw dropped open.  <br />
<br />
To his amazement, a horse head was staring back at Jack.<br />
<br />
At first Jack just thought he was still dreaming.  Or maybe just hallucinating.  He splashed a little water on his face to wake himself up.  When nothing changed he slapped himself hard in the face.  The blow not only hurt, but tickled his nose causing him to snort and sneeze like a horse.  As he lifted his hands to wipe his nose, his quickly sobering mind began to notice the other changes to his body.  His finger had merged into two digits, leaving him with just two fingers and a thumb.  All of his digits ended in a hard black nail that looked just like a hoof. His entire body was covered in brown fur. A thick black mane trailed down his neck.  He reached behind himself and grabbed a hold of bushy black tail.  He looked down and saw thick muscular thighs leading to thin short calves and ending in long hooves.  He looked like some kind of anthropomorphic horse!<br />
<br />
Jack leaned down into the sink and vomited, hurling most of what he had eaten and drunk into and over the edges of the sink.  He was still moaning, head down in the sink,  when he heard a knock on the bathroom door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jack, you okay in there?&quot; asked his father Joe from the other side of the door.<br />
<br />
Jack began to panic, fear rising in his chest.  He didn&#39;t know what to do.  Should he tell his father the truth and ask for help?  Or maybe try to hide his changes for a little while, just until he could figure something out?</p>
