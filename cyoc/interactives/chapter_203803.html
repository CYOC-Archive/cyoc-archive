<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kat’s tongue parted Jay’s lips as she aggressively snogged her best friend. She lapped a sheen of warm drool onto his lips before her tongue wormed its way inside her hesitant partner as Jay just sat there stiff as a board.<br />
<br />
Kay pulled out, breaking gooey one-sided kiss before shooting Jay a smug smirk. “Bruh.” She chuckled in her deep feminine voice while stroking his cheek. “I thought you never kissed a girl before, but you’re so bad at this I bet you’ve never even kissed your mom on the cheek.”<br />
<br />
“Shut up.” Jay smirked back, pushing Kat off him, setting her right next to him on the couch. “I’m not some kinda kiss-less virgin, you know. It’s just kissing you is… weird.”<br />
<br />
“Only ‘cause you’re making it that way.” Kat said in her usual lazy monotone as she tugged Jay on top of her, looking him straight in the eyes, “We’re friends, you don’t hafta worry if you suck at kissing; I’ll teach ya. And you’re lucky I’m a lesbian – like, half the stuff we do is oral so I’m basically a master at this.” The girl’s hand wrapped around Jay’s butt, grabbing his ropey tail and giving it a light squeeze. “Plus, your promised you’d infect me and give me a butt noodle too, that’s not gonna happen without a little swapping spit, so come on – try it again with tongue.”<br />
<br />
The tail… why does she have to keep touching the tail? Jay went limp as Kat’s finger stroked that light grey fuzz covering his equine appendage, gently tugging it, trying to coax it out to grow even longer; and Jay felt like it was working.<br />
<br />
“Kat…” Jay groaned, his rear swaying, guided by the motion of her pulling his tail. “Cut it out, that’s super weird too.”<br />
<br />
“Is it like… a good weird?” Kat grinned with a hint of genuine curiosity in her voice, “Weird like kissing me?”<br />
<br />
“No. Just weird.” Jay asserted, “Let go or I swear to God, the first thing I’m gonna do if I go full donkey is buck you into next week!”<br />
<br />
“I’ll let go if you do a real kiss.”<br />
<br />
“What, you’re holding me hostage?”<br />
<br />
“If it’s what I got to do to make you relax, then yeah!” Kay shot back, “It’s just kissing, dude! I’m not asking to marry you and have kids, just relax!”<br />
<br />
“Fine…” Jay huffed, dipping his head down as his lips smooshed into Kay’s for just a brief second before pulling back, “Now let go!”<br />
<br />
Kat pulled on Jay’s tail really hard, forcing a shocked yelp out of her friend, “Wrong. That’s some super weak stuff – no wonder you can’t get a date. Do it again. With. Tongue.”<br />
Jay trembled on top of Kat, as he felt his donkey tail spurt out another inch. Something in his spine seemed to just “snap” in place as he suddenly gained articulation in his tail, Jay was surprised and a tad concerned as he could feel himself consciously wave that ropey appendage.<br />
<br />
Without another word, Kay pulled him down, forcing him to dive back into her lips, his tongue fitfully pressing against the opening of her mouth. As Jay’s tongue started to eek inside, Kay made sure to clamp down on it with her lips, preventing any backward progress as she huffed contentedly, pressing against Jay’s butt to make him lean in even closer. As Jay’s tongue shyly worked its way inside the girl’s maw, Kay wasted no time in tying tongues with him, lapping at the hesitant boy’s tongue, twisting and turning her pink muscle over his.<br />
<br />
It felt like an hour to Jay, but in truth he only managed about a minute, finally pulling back and gasping for breath as a strand of drool connected their two mouths. “B-better?”<br />
<br />
“Well, ‘better’ is a hard word.” Kat smiled, licking Jay’s drool off her lips, “But I’ll give you a ‘C+’ for effort.”<br />
<br />
“Fine – just let go of my tail, would ya?”<br />
<br />
“You really want me to let go? I’m sorta getting the feeling you like it.”<br />
<br />
“What? No! Fuck you.”<br />
<br />
Kat smirked, looking down to the groin of his pants spotting a small bulge rubbing against her leg. “You wanna?”<br />
<br />
Jay immediately leapt off Kat, blushing furiously as she kept that same half-joking-half-serious expression on her face.<br />
<br />
“Just kidding.” The teenage girl said with a dry laugh before standing up off the couch, “Here, let’s calm down and eat some of the food I got. You’re gonna faint from all the blood going to youe cock if I don’t give you a break.”<br />
<br />
Jay didn’t protest, instead he followed behind Kat, his sensitive tail swaying behind him as he entered the kitchen. In the center of the table there had to be a dozen Burger Barn bags filled to the brim with unsold fast food that Kat brought. The pair scooched over some chairs and sat down next to each other, picking through the greasy spoils.<br />
<br />
“Whoa, boy.” Kat chided Jay like a horse as he picked up one of the bags, just to hand him another. “That one’s got meat in it. I made a couple of bags that have veggie burgers and stuff for the new herbivore.”<br />
<br />
“Eugh…, gross.” Jay exaggerated his disgust, “I’m not that far gone, I’m sure I can stomach a real burger.”<br />
“Ok, give it a shot.” Kat chuckled, handing him back a bag with a Barn Buster Burger inside. Jay picked up the goliath triple patty stack of meat, shoving the greasy sandwich in his mouth, biting down and…<br />
<br />
“Bleugh-“ Jay coughed, shaking a little as a barely chewed chunk of burger dropped from his mouth to the table. “I used to love these… why…can’t I…”<br />
<br />
“Here.” Kat shot him a smug grin as she passed him a bag filled with French Fries. “I think the donkey should just stick to these for a while. Growing livestock needs plenty of feed.”<br />
<br />
Jay didn’t have anything to retort. As much as he hated to admit it – anything made of vegetables sounded so much better. His tail whipped behind him idly as if it were swatting at annoying insects as he grazed on fries. Kat kept that knowing grin on her face as she chowed down on the burger he threw away, making extra sure to eat anywhere where his donkey-pox laden drool touched.<br />
<br />
The two sat in relative silence for while, the pair able to knock down a surprising amount of food between them and emptying several of the bags. Jay polished off the sack full of French Fries and reached out for a new one to see if there was more food fit for developing herbivores.<br />
<br />
“Brownies?” Jay asked Kat, peering into the bag.<br />
<br />
“Mhm.” Kat mumbled with her mouth full of chick nubbets, “It’s a special batch I usually make before closing – for me.”<br />
<br />
“So… weed brownies?” Jay squinted at the sight of what had to be four dozen fudge squares in the bag.<br />
<br />
“Let me guess.” Kat turned to him with a mirthful grin, “You’re afraid of weed too, just like you’re afraid of girls, right?”<br />
<br />
“Just stuff it. I’m already going through a lot tonight and I just don’t feel like trying it.”<br />
<br />
Expecting a snarky reply, Jay was surprised to hear Kat concede immediately. “Fine.” She shrugged her elbows, reaching across the table to pick out a few squares from the bag for herself. “Some people think this stuff is poison, but it just helps you mellow out – to focus.”<br />
<br />
“I was never told marijuana was poison, just that it makes you lazy - makes you lose ambition.” Jay corrected her, watching her pop a square into her mouth, savoring the sweet treat as she raised another to her lips.<br />
<br />
“Mmm…” Kat sighed with her mouth full of brownie, as if that comment hit a sore spot inside her. “I’m not lazy – I work all the time.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, at Burger Barn.” Jay retorted, “I mean, you have other life goals, right? For me, I wanna be a lawyer, I want a family and a nice house…”<br />
<br />
Kat starred back at him blanky, pressing the pot brownie against her lips thinking about what he said like it was an alien language – like it was something she’d never considered.<br />
<br />
“Anything?” Jay asked again, “You never wanted to be an astronaut or a princess as a kid? There’s never been anything that you really wanted… that you’ve strived for?”<br />
<br />
“I-I…” Kat stammered, losing her guard, “I… liked my grandpa’s farm… before he passed…” Kat finally managed with a sigh, “I loved going there when I was really little… all the happy animals, ya know... but it was sold after he died, but I still walk by it sometimes…”<br />
<br />
Kat takes a swig of soda from a nearby cup before continuing, “I guess that’s all I really want… to live at a place like that, ya know? There’s no way I could afford to buy a place like that with my job so…”<br />
<br />
The girl peered beside her to see Jay with a genuinely sympathetic look on his face. Quickly stuffing another brownie in her mouth, she looked over to Jay again with a grin on her face as instantly shifted the subject. “Nah… what I really want is a butt rope like yours!” She snickered, reaching down to rub just above the base of Jay’s tail. “When are ya gonna get me to change? You promised you would!”<br />
<br />
“Ack! Let go!” Jay jolted in his chair, catching Kat’s hand before she could attack that sensitive skin any further, “Sorry I gave a shit…”<br />
<br />
“Looks like you can’t help but give a shit.” Kat snickered back, pointing to a tiny tent in the front of his pants.<br />
<br />
“I thought you were a lesbian, why do you keep looking down there?” Jay fired back, turning his groin away from her so she couldn’t talk about it anymore.<br />
<br />
“I’m just noticing my friend has a problem…” lets out another laugh, before getting out of her chair and reaching for the buttons of Jay’s pants. “…Here, just lemme…”<br />
<br />
Jay’s chair squeaked back, slamming against the wall as he quickly stood back up. “Hey. S-stop. I’m serious, I really thought you were a lesbian! Why would you even want to do that?!” He blasted back at her, trembling a little as Kat leaned forward in her chair.<br />
<br />
“I am.” Kat replied blankly, “But that doesn’t mean I can’t help my guy friends out, right?” Kat’s face drew ever closer to that tent in his pants, her tongue flicking out as a tiny bit of humid moisture traveled inside the fabric, bathing the tip of Jay’s prick in warmth. “Guys tend to relax a little when they can blow a load. It takes the edge off, ya know? I usually take breaks with other coworkers at Burger Barn, just to help them relax a little…”<br />
<br />
Jay tried to take a step back as Kay went straight for the buttons on his pants again. “Just calm down… seeing how you are with girls I know you’ve never had this done before…” Kat cooed as she undid the boy’s pants, “Sex isn’t anything sacred… and this is just a friend scratching an itch ya got, got it? Just scratching an itch…”<br />
<br />
The boy couldn’t really think straight as Kat tugged down his pants, nuzzling the bulge in his underwear as she reached up, slowly pulling the sweat drenched fabric down until…<br />
<br />
Kat stifled a giggle watching Jay’s weiner pop free. “Oh… ummm….” She held the four-inch member in her grasp, looking up to Jay’s eyes with a trademark smirk.<br />
<br />
Jay stood there as his best friend kneaded his tiny penis in her hand. He couldn’t look back down at her after seeing that face she shot him. “Wh-what? What’s wrong?”<br />
<br />
Sensing a bit of distress in the boy, Kat just let out reassuring purr, nuzzling the little dick to her nose, smearing some gooey precum on her face. “Nothing. I love fun-sized dicks. Little guys are really nice.”<br />
<br />
Jay groaned, both in pleasure and embarrassment as his glans smooshed against Kat’s soft skin.<br />
<br />
“I’m serious. Girls I know say they don’t need big honking dicks – and you’re circumcised so that’s a plus. They’re perfectly happy with tiny, itsy-bitsy, little-“<br />
<br />
“I get it!” Jay huffed out with a steaming breath, “I get it…”<br />
<br />
“Alright, Alright, I get it. Less talky, more sucky.” Kat giggled, licking her lips and covering them with a sheen of gooey drool before taking the tip to her lips, kissing that blushing pink cock tip before gently parting her lips and accepting it into her mouth. Jay’s shaft disappeared quickly after his glans dipped in, four inches of boy meat vanishing as Kay’s lips pressed against his groin. The girl’s tongue cradled the little penis in her tongue, lapping against the other side with lewd slurps, covering it in a viscous layer of drool. Kat looked up at Jay, a smirk clearly visible on her face even as her mouth was full of cock.<br />
<br />
Looking back down at her, Jay flinched in place, holding himself as still as possible as he tried to read what the girl wanted now. As if to answer his question, Kat grasped his hand, placing it on her head and gripping it, like she was asking him to grasp it. With trembling hands, Jay complied, latching onto her hair and tugging her, gently rocking her head back and forth as a few inches of penis popped free, only for Kat’s head to swallow it back down. Jay started panting, the boy clenching his teeth as he began to hump into her head a little, pulling the girl’s head back before tugging it back towards him with a wet slap.<br />
<br />
Kat didn’t seem to mind it at all, simply letting her friend use her, closing her eyes and obeying the ragged thrusting from his hips. The girl’s hands stroked along the contour of the back of Jay’s leg, her hands stroking along his butt until they reached towards his tail once again, using one hand to rub against the dock of Jay’s tail to make it flag upwards, and the other to touch what was underneath it.<br />
<br />
A sudden rough buck erupted from Jay’s hips as he felt Kat’s finger stroke along his pink anus. The fleshy starfish was getting prodded by one of her fingers, Kat gingerly forcing her digit in and out, deeper and deeper until she poked something that made the boy above her writhe. Jay’s butt cheeks clenched tight around Kat’s hand as the boy shoved her head hard into his groin. Kat purred as a few spurts of precum painted her tongue with boy goo as she tended to Jay’s little cock, the girl continuing her assault on the eighteen-year-old boy’s virgin prostate as she massaged his shaft with her lips.<br />
<br />
Another flurry of thrusts squelched against Kat’s maw, drool and pre seeping from her lips as the boy’s balls tensed, churning out a shotglass-worth of cum into Kat’s hungry throat. Kat kept stroking the dock of Jay’s donkey tail, forcing the sensitive appendage to strand on edge as the feeling her finger plunged inside Jay’s asshole started to feel looser.<br />
<br />
Jay held his death drip on Kat’s head as the alien feeling of puffy flesh pressing against the inside of his butt cheeks took hold. As Kat fingered her friend, the boy’s human asshole started to swell, that plump ring of muscle starting to bloom outwards with dark, leathery skin – velvety and plush with, soft squishy animal flesh. Kat became excited feeling her friend start to shift, and flesh growing around her finger as it more easily accepted her digit inside. Pushing in another finger, then another, then another, she stretched his expanding pucker open, a warm puffy equine donut starting to squish around her knuckles as she forcefully pressed in deeper, her whole hand suddenly sliding in with a sloppy “slurp!” as the boy’s satin-soft insides jostling and jiggled around her.<br />
<br />
“Haa… Haaaaw…!” Jay gasped out a bestial moan as Kay grasp the boy’s prostate like a tiny water balloon, strokes and massaging it in her fingers as more boy cum spattered against Kay’s tongue in ever desperate spurts.<br />
<br />
Kat’s eyes widened as she felt that tiny prick nestled in her mouth suddenly jerk out another two inches in length. His glans somehow fanned out wider like an umbrella as that sensitive, soft cockhead grew more spongy. A stronger, more savory taste of boy meat rubbed against her tastebuds as it began tasting like a hotdog from Burger Barn to her – savory, slick animal meat.<br />
<br />
Kat murred against the teenager’s groin, soft glucking sounds emanating from her throat as Jay’s child-sized hotdog stretch out into a footlong, dipping passed her uvula and into her throat, forcing the girl to breath through her nose as she mustered all her blow job skills to keep herself from gagging. Distinctly bestial flesh filled every nook and cranny of her mouth and upper-throat as that cock expanded to the girth of a beer can, a soft-ball sized bulge appearing in Kat’s neck as the flared cocktip hidden inside anchored itself in her throat.<br />
<br />
As Jay shakily stood there, hawing and squirming with the teen girl’s fist stuck up his ass and Kat struggled for air, kneeling with her face pressed against Jay’s groin trying to handle his foot-long length of bestial pride, neither noticed the boy’s balls changing. Those quail egg-sized orbs churned, spitting out the last of their human seed as the boy’s scrotum darkened from a grey to a pitch black. The soft human skin grew lush and leathery, expanding balls weighing down his asinine sack until two orange-sized testicles hung snuggly in that taut scrotum. Once Jay’s babymakers had shifted entirely into foal factories, a steaming hot stream of salty and thick semen jetted out that equine shaft and into Kat’s throat. The girl gagged, her throat getting force-fed by a never-ending tap of donkey cum, the viscous goo trailing down her esophagus and leaking into her belly, filling it with molten hot animal cum. Kat grew light-headed, the boy’s light male scent strengthening to an intoxicating curtain of equine musk. <br />
<br />
The kitchen began smelling like a stable, loud pleasured brays ringing out with each burst of semen sent slithering down his friend’s throat. His orgasm must have lasted for a full five minutes, dying as a quivering Kat felt that fat donkey organ soften in her maw, fleshy folds of tube of skin roiling from Jay’s crotch and forming right against her lips. Jay’s new cock slithered back from her mouth into his new sheath, Kat’s lips slinking over that flaccid cock head as it snaked into its new home, sinking into its fleshy cage with it loud “slop”.<br />
<br />
Jay came back to his senses looking down at his best friend leaking cum out of her mouth, her face still pressed up against that soft sheath as the boy pet the back of her head. He’d hardly noticed that changes that happened to his own body at this point. But as he pet Kat’s hair, he instead saw that Kat had changed.</p>
