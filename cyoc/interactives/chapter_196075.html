<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">9 years ago when he was just a child, Ethan’s mother would take him to the public swimming pool. He would rush to the place like his life depended on it. People who recognized them would often say “There he goes, that boy sure loves to swim!” little did they know that his eagerness mainly came from the spoils he’d garnered in the changing rooms.<br />
<br />
There was a 16 year old in town at the time named Noah Carrillo who, now and again, would hold a little show and tell between the other boys in the neighborhood. He would have them gather in the spacious disabled toilet and make each pull out their junk, measuring them to see who had the longest and biggest dick. Noah would then give each and every boy copious amounts of sweets while the one who proved to be the victor would stay back and receive a mysterious ‘special prize’.<br />
<br />
One day it had just been Ethan and 2 others in the roster, one was 14 while the other was 12. They all stood in a line, back against a musty tiled wall. Noah knelt down for each of them, grabbing their dicks as he did and measuring.<br />
<br />
“Diego looks like you grew a few centimeters” Noah said to the 14 year old as he held the measuring tape up “5.25 inches”.<br />
<br />
Diego used his fingers to push his groin’s fat pad in, making the skin on his tightly circumcised penis curve his erection further back “Come on, there’s at least another inch in there” he whined, but Noah just smirked and shook his head.<br />
<br />
“That’s not how we do things here” Noah said, as he moved on to another participant. “4.5 inches, pretty good Jorge, you’ll catch up to Diego in no time” Jorge sprung up as Noah tousled his hair.<br />
<br />
It was finally Ethan’s turn, Noah pinched the flaccid cock between his thumb and index finger “Well I know this one is 3 inches” the teenager said, circling his thumb on the foreskin. A stifled laugh was heard from the other end of the line, Diego shook his head.<br />
<br />
“Why is he even here, he can’t even get it up?” Diego blurted.<br />
<br />
“Yeah go play with the other babies in the shallow end” Jorge chimed in.<br />
<br />
“Come on, you’re gonna make him cry” Noah kept twiddling with Ethan’s little prepubescent cock; he pulled the foreskin back to reveal a red tiny sensitive head. “You ever try jerking off by yourself Ethan?” He asked. Ethan nodded vigorously; he had seen the other boys get hard and somehow knew that if he managed to as well he could win that elusive special prize at least once, but alas, no cigar.<br />
<br />
Noah had a big smile on his face, teeth showing “Look at that guys, it’s twitching” He flicked the little boy’s penis once or twice. The other boys began to giggle and snort. Diego was starting to lose his stiffy and began jerking off himself.<br />
<br />
“You’re never going to win with that useless thing” said Diego, his palm going up and down in a twisting motion, his curved dick bouncing and slapping just underneath his navel whenever he lost his grip.<br />
<br />
The comments were getting to Ethan he felt the heat flush through his cheeks, a tightening in his chest and an odd throbbing in his penis. Lo and behold, it was happening. Ethan’s little dicklet started with little twitches, it pulsated, getting warmer and warmer until finally it grew. Right in front of everyone’s eyes and within Noah’s sweaty palms, he could feel a pulling sensation and the skin expanded to double its size.<br />
<br />
“No way…” Jorge exclaimed. Diego stopped masturbating, his hand fell to his side and eyes glued to the 6 inch hard-on between the 8 year old boy’s legs. Noah separated his hand from the impressive piece of meat, covering his mouth with the hand and breathing in its scent.<br />
“Damn niño… you’ve been holding out on me” Noah laid both knees on the floor and pulled his swimming trunks down. He pressed his own hard penis against Ethan’s “You even got me beat” It was only by a centimeter or so but hearing Noah say that got Ethan beaming; he was finally going to find out what this special prize was.<br />
<br />
Another boy about Noah’s age barged into the disabled toilet “Noah someone’s coming!” he took a second to look at the scene “Holy shit… uh Noah, we gotta go”.<br />
<br />
The others scrambled to stuff their erections into their swim trunks and left, before Noah could go, Ethan grabbed the teenager&#39;s trunks “But… my prize…”<br />
<br />
Noah grinned, he tossed the measuring tape to Ethan “There’s your special prize kid, till next time” He winked and scrammed out of the place. That was the last Ethan had seen of him. It was an anti-climactic end; he didn’t even get any candy. Regardless Ethan would keep the measuring tape in a toolbox he would be gifted a few years later.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Now Ethan is a year older than Noah had been back then; Noah would definitely beat Ethan in his current diminished state. His mind lingered on the flashback, what would the boys think of him now, in this predicament.<br />
<br />
His tattered underwear was hanging on his left thigh, the fake penis just dangling. The cold had made Ethan’s testicles rise up closer to his body, creating a deeper hole for his already hidden, tiny dicklet. Mrs. Abuzalgo had turned around trying hard to stop herself from laughing out loud and Nurse Freeman’s eyes travelled from Ethan’s tiny cave of a groin, to the dangling falsie and back, the teenager was completely frozen.<br />
<br />
“Ah…um…you…” Nurse Freeman started, but stopped herself from saying anything further; she composed herself then continued with the treatment, lightly rubbing the slightly burned areas with petroleum jelly. The sensation of being touched and so exposed brought on a familiar tingling. Soon enough, a cute little nub pushed forward from the depths of the hole.<br />
<br />
“Oh… that’s perfectly normal…nothing to be ashamed of dear” Nurse Freeman assured.<br />
<br />
“You shouldn’t lie to him like that Ireti” Mrs. Abuzalgo said quietly with arms crossed.<br />
<br />
Nurse Freeman smacked her lips “Shhh Julianne! I meant the erection”<br />
<br />
Mrs. Abuzalgo took a good look at Ethan’s groin “That neither”.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Abuzalgo’s degrading words were getting Ethan hot and bothered. He could feel his testicles retreating further upwards and tightening. The march of electricity going through his tubes and then an arch of white pearls shot across the air from his eager cocklet. It hit Nurse Freeman right in the face which made Mrs. Abuzalgo lose control, almost toppling over laughing.<br />
<br />
Ethan apologized frantically, finally being able to move. Nurse Freeman didn’t look amused but said nothing; she grabbed a few tissues and wiped her face. When Mrs. Abuzalgo managed to stop laughing, she looked Ethan up and down, this boy was an interesting spectacle.<br />
<br />
“Shouldn’t you check if he’s okay there?” Mrs Abuzalgo wiggled an index finger towards the teenager’s embarrassing package.<br />
<br />
“Excuse me?” Nurse Freeman said sternly.<br />
<br />
“Make sure he didn’t get burnt, you know, over there”.<br />
<br />
“Julianne you’re really pushing me right now”.<br />
<br />
“It’s your job, besides a boy’s…friend…is precious to him no matter the size”.<br />
<br />
Nurse Freeman looked at Mrs. Abuzalgo with a very annoyed expression, but complied. She turned to face Ethan and asked him if he could pull his penis up himself. Ethan’s face turned a dark red as he pinched the head and pulled it up, his dick was already hard but it was still partially buried from the extra scrotum skin, he can’t believe it still managed to obstruct his penis even with the shrinkage from the cold.<br />
<br />
Ethan recalled what Eric had done when he went to pee. So with a free hand, Ethan pushed the extra skin down, exposing more of the thin short penis, it really wasn’t much, but at least it looked more like an actual penis this way, albeit incredibly small; for god’s sake the fingers he used looked more worthy of praise.<br />
<br />
As the nurse told Ethan to move his little friend around, so she could inspect it properly, he kept cumming into his hand, by the end his cocktail sausage and legs were covered in a thick white sauce. Nurse Freeman got a towel to pat Ethan dry, when he wouldn’t stop ejaculating, she gave him a men’s urinal bottle and told him to release into it while she finishes up bandaging him.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Mrs. Abuzalgo was intently observing this strange teenager. He had a delectable body, almost too perfect had it not been for his underdeveloped penis. She felt herself squirm a little and a wet spot was forming under her skirt, interesting.<br />
<br />
“I think we’re done here” exclaimed Nurse Freeman. Mrs. Abuzalgo though, thought otherwise and she placed a hand on the nurse’s shoulder. “What is it now?” The nurse asked.<br />
<br />
“Safety” Mrs. Abuzalgo said, raising both her eyebrows. Nurse Freeman gave her a puzzled look, so Mrs. Abuzalgo expanded on it “Safety from STIs”.<br />
<br />
“Are you serious?”<br />
<br />
“We are obligated to provide students with the proper tools and knowledge to protect themselves” Mrs. Abuzalgo motions her chin to the various STI awareness campaign posters decorating the nurse’s office. Nurse Freeman picked up a few pamphlets and passed them on to Ethan, who grabbed them and stood up off the examination bench; his tattered underwear slipped down onto the ground.<br />
<br />
“Give him some condoms, God knows he needs some” Mrs. Abuzalgo said rolling her eyes at Nurse Freeman.<br />
<br />
“It’s not like they’ll fit!” Nurse Freeman snapped a little, then quickly looked back at Ethan “I…I’m sorry”. Mrs. Abuzalgo couldn’t help but snort.<br />
<br />
“I still have those… you know, from Jessica’s party?”<br />
<br />
“Jessica’s party…?” Nurse Freeman paused for a second before widening her eyes “No… you don’t mean, Julianne don’t”.<br />
<br />
“They’ll work just fine, what other choice does he have?” Mrs. Abuzalgo’s motions a hand to a confused Ethan. She then rummages through her purse and pulls out what looks like some kind of toy packaging. She hands it over to Ethan and his jaw dropped.<br />
<br />
“Extra, extra, extra small condoms…” Ethan muttered. They were one of those gimmicky gifts one could find in a joke shop. His little excited teenie weenie reacted again and shot a few droplets on the tiled floor.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Abuzalgo coughed before speaking up “I know they’re a gag gift but they are made of latex and should function just the same”. Nurse Freeman let her head hang low and pinched her forehead; Ethan was frozen yet again, so Mrs. Abuzalgo clapped her hands together. “Well, I think that should be everything, we can’t let you go to class in wet clothes, so follow me to lost and found”.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Abuzalgo turned to leave the room “Pick up your things Morales and put on that lab coat for now” she said, looking at her phone and texting. Ethan did as he was told.<br />
<br />
“Don’t… forget your… that” Nurse Freeman, pointed to Ethan’s modified underwear lying on the floor. He grabbed it, and thanked the nurse, before following Mrs. Abuzalgo out, his face redder than a beet.</p>
