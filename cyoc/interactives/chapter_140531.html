<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kellie slowly stretched as the sun broke through her window. “Wow I slept great,” she thought. As she looked over her friends she was not surprised to see everyone was still seven years old. Smiling she now raised her hand in an attempt to change everyone back. Lifting her hand she paused as she now remembered Merlin had taken her ring.<br />
<br />
“Morning Kellie.”<br />
<br />
Kellie turned to see Samantha enter the room, the young Samoan girl smiled brightly as she now stood next to the bed. “Hey Sammy,” Kellie answered as she slid out of bed. “How you sleep?”<br />
<br />
“Pretty good actually,” she answered. “Although still trying to get used to being a kid again. It’s weird being so short, actually had to step on a step stool to reach the toothpaste in the medicine cabinet.”<br />
<br />
“Imagine how the rest of us feel,” Kellie smirked. “I probably need a step stool just to see my reflection in the bathroom mirror.”<br />
<br />
Samantha nodded, noticing the others begin to stir. “Morning everyone,” they said happily.<br />
<br />
Kumiko and Lisa yawned, waving to their friends as they slid out of bed. “Anyone else weirded out being this short and this young,” Kumiko asked as she gazed around the room in awe. “We were just talking about that,” Samantha said. “Kellie you think Merlin will give you your ring back now?”<br />
<br />
“Hope so,” She answered. “Really don’t feel like reliving first grade again.”<br />
<br />
As the girls journeyed downstairs the smell of pancakes and bacon wafted through the house, causing the girls stomachs to growl. Entering the kitchen they were somewhat astounded by the wizards cooking abilities. The kitchen itself appeared quite messy as it appeared he had made everything from scratch. “Morning girls,” he said happily. “Hope your hungry.”<br />
<br />
“Starved,” Mika sighed as she slid into one of the ten chairs positioned around the table. “Hope you have something good.”<br />
<br />
“Homemade pancakes, English muffins, eggs and orange juice,” he said with pride. “Now eat up girls.”<br />
<br />
As the girls pushed their chairs closer to the table, they were each struck at just how young they currently were. None of the girls feet now touched the floor. As they glanced at the table they were astounded to find it rested almost chest high to them as well, making them feel even younger and smaller than they already felt. “Hey dad,” Kellie frowned. “Did you make us even younger?”<br />
<br />
“No cant say that I did,” he answered. “Why would you think that?”<br />
<br />
“Well none us can touch the floor and the table looks huge,” Kellie exclaimed. “You sure you aren’t playing a joke or something? Is this the same table you usually use?”<br />
<br />
“I assure you I have done nothing except make the table longer to accommodate our guests,” he said. “It’s the same height as it usually is, you on the other hand are not.”<br />
<br />
“Kinda noticed that dad,” she grumbled. “Which reminds me, can we have our rings back. Really want to be a teen again if you don’t mind.” <br />
<br />
“Of course,” Merlin smiled. With a wave of his hand Kellie and Katie watched as their rings returned to their hands. Smiling the two girls thanked the elderly wizard before wishing the entire group back to normal. Kellie sighed in relief as she noticed the girls slowly growing back into their teens. By the time the girls reentered the double digits of their lives everyone but Claudia and Mika found that they could not reach the floor once more. By the time the girls became 11 even those two now found their feet solidly on the floor.<br />
<br />
“Never thought I would be happy to be tall,” Samantha sighed as her height began to increase dramatically. “Yeah that’s one of the crazy things about becoming younger,” Katie said. “You don’t think about how small you used to be until you relive it.”<br />
<br />
“I’m just glad the girls are coming back,” Kumiko smirked as she pushed together her slowly blossoming breasts. The girls now giggled as they watched themselves slowly begin to ascend once more into puberty.<br />
<br />
“Seriously Kumi,” Mika sighed, “That’s the first thing that comes to mind, your tits.”<br />
<br />
“Not like you weren’t thinking the same thing sis,” she countered. “I saw the smile of relief on your face when your boobs started growing again.”<br />
<br />
The 12 year old blushed as she nodded in response. The girls now happily began talking with one another giggling and telling stories of their sleepover as they reentered their teens. Kellie had watched her friends intently as slowly but surely the girls returned to the teenage girls she had grown accustomed too over the last couple of months. Glancing over herself she smiled happily. “Glad that worked,” she sighed. “And even more surprised The nightgowns grew with us.”<br />
<br />
“So,” Katie said. “What are our plans for the day?”<br />
<br />
The girls now curiously gaZed at one another as they began to spitball ideas, all of which sounded promising. “If I could make a suggestion,” Merlin stated interrupting the girls. Kellie and her friends now stared at the wizard, wondering what his idea was. “What you thinking dad?”<br />
<br />
“Well,” he started. “In between cooking I was able to get in contact with Katie in the other timeline. I proposed another jump for Kellie to practice with. I believe Kellie will need a few more practice jumps before finally reuniting with the Lisa and Ann in that timeline.”<br />
<br />
“Sounds like a good plan,” Kellie smiled. “So where am I going?”<br />
<br />
“Well here’s the thing,” Merlin smirked. “I was thinking that perhaps all of you could go this time instead of just Kellie.”<br />
<br />
“All of us,” Claudia said in awe. “Is that possible?”<br />
<br />
“Yes Claudia it is,” he answered. “And I believe it would good for the group as a whole. Despite the differences you seven have, it appears you are stronger together than apart, I’m hoping a trio such as this can bring you girls closer together.”<br />
<br />
The girls smiled as they looked at one another. Yes they still had quite a ways to go before they could consider themselves best friends but it appeared they were beginning to make progress. “So,” Lisa asked. “Who are we visiting?”<br />
<br />
“Well that is an interesting question,” Merlin mused. “But I would propose either Mika or Samantha.”<br />
<br />
“Why them,” Katie asked. “I mean wouldn’t thing be easier if we visited Katie again or even Gloria. It would save a lot of awkward introductions.”<br />
<br />
“True,” Merlin stated. “However those two are quite close with Katie. To avoid anymore possible crossovers in the future, perhaps it would be best to introduce ourselves. The choice though, is yours to make.” Kellie and her friends now thought carefully about who they should visit. This time though they would be doing it together.</p>
