<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Ill humor you. Transform you freak.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, I had something planned but it should work without he dare. You shall become a anthro skunk girl. Skunk girls are incredibly sexy and horny at all times. They have IQs of 50 at most and have terrible memories to the point where they can barely rember anything besides how to eat each other out, how to eat sleep, breath, say words with less than two syllables, what they are supposed to do, and who certain people are. They never wear clothes or clean up after themselves because they are so slutty and are not embarrassed by it because they hate being clean and any clothes are likely ripped off them so they can have sex faster. They are lesbians and just the thought of a naked women makes them want to jump on the nearest women and eat them out. They don&#39;t get tired or need to sleep and can cum an endless amount of times. Skunk girls live off of each others cum and can get pregnant by eachother because they are all a single gendered species. Skunk girl pregnancies are very rare and happen extremely fast. Skunk girls age at an extremely fast rate but stop at  twenty five years old. They have very little self control and often have sex with anyone they can, anywhere they can. They also are immune to all diseases and STDs. They have a gland which can be used to spray people like a skunk. They reflexively spray anyone who startles them or tries to attack them. Anyone sprayed will become a skunk girl and everyone will believe they have always been one. Just so you don&#39;t freak out everyone and ruin my plan, reality will change so that you have always been this way. Everyone will treat you relatively the same way they did before and your real family will stay the same and become your adopted family. Your family and your cheerleading friends will know about your strange habits and quirks but will put up with them because they love you. Just so you don&#39;t tell about this conversation you will forget what you where saying when you try and say transform or dare and your transformation will be extremely quick so you don&#39;t miss the bus. Goodby and happy transforming.&quot; Kyle hung up as Jennifer&#39;s transform began. Small black hairs began to cover her body and change it. Small leathery pads developed on the bottoms of her hands and feet, making it so that she could got without shoes. Her nails became claws, perfect for scratching, which would obviously happen when having sex. Her breasts expanded from a modest c cup to a big gig cup, becoming incredibly sexy and bouncy, while her ass cheeks grew to the size of cantaloups. Her face changed so she had a muzzle with a cute little pink nose above it. Her ears changed to become more sensitive to sounds and moving to the top of her head. Two white stripes of hair went up from her pink nose, down her back, and up her big fluffy skunk tail. A small gland developed  above her asshole and under her tail. The gland was perfect for spraying people with stinky, transforming fluid. Her final changes began as her mind altered. She quickly forgot about everything she learned in school as new information on how to pleasure herself flooded her mind. Her vocabulary shrunk as her IQ went down to forty three and she now only knew words that had less than two symbols. Her likes and dislikes changed so she now loved being dirty and eating out fellow skunk girls, licking clean their tasty sex juices. She would now be constantly horny and sex craving. Her memories changed so she now only knew the names of a her friends, family and a few other people. She remembered other stuff like what to do and  most of her past as a human, but other than that she don&#39;t know much. Reality rippled so that everyone believed Jen had always been this way. Her clothes dis appeared, leaving just Jen&#39;s  fur to cover her modesty. Instead of being clean and tidy like she used to, she was so dirty that she it looked like she hadn&#39;t ever been cleaned, which she most likely hadn&#39;t. Her fur was caked with dirt, dried shit in her butt crack, and dried cum stuck to her pussy, most likely from hours worth of fingering herself. Her room had changed from being pristine and full of expensive stuff, to having dirt all over the floor, waste on pretty much everything, her bed now being nothing but an old mattress, and the only things that weren&#39;t worn out and dirty where a vibrator that had been licked clean multiple times and a laptop with hours worth of poem files on it. The changes happened so quickly that Jen didn&#39;t notice them at first. She was now a slutty anthro skunk girl. Normally she would have been freaking out but thanks to the the  mental changes she was  now fine with them. Normally she wouldn&#39;t be caught dead like this but now she thought it was rather arousing. The thought of being covered with dirt and grime, naked with pussy and tits on display for the world to see was rather arousing. She smelled horrible, but to her the smell was like roses and the thought of being clean disgusted. Just then she realized the bus was outside and ran to it and got on.</p>
