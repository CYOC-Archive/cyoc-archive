<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andrew & Maxwell walked into their local Animalia Transformation Center. Both only wore a pair of shorts. They approached the employee & Maxwell told the human employee &quot;We have come here to be transformed into an anthromorphic chimera.&quot; The employee asked &quot;So who wants to go first?&quot; Andrew said &quot;You misunderstand. We are here to be transformed into an anthromorphic chimera. We want to be merged into one.&quot; Maxwell went on to explain &quot;I want to have my lower body be goat & my upper body be lion. I want to still be able to speak & have paw-like hands. As for Andrew here he will be 100% feral snake. He&#39;ll still be able to speak but with a hissing lisp. He will be attached to me where I would have a tail. He&#39;s be my tail. He will be able to move himself freely & I will have no control over his snake body. He will be a green tree python about 4 foot long.&quot; The employee looked at the 2 & said &quot;This should be possible. But you really sure you want this?&quot; The 2 men said &quot;Yes,&quot; in unison & took off their shorts making them naked. They entered the transformation chamber as instructed & did everything they were told. <br />
5 months later...<br />
Sarah was waiting for her friends Maxwell & Andrew to arrive. They told her to meet them at this table outside this restaurant. She hadn&#39;t seen in monthes. Then it walked up. It was an anthromorphic creature with the lower body of a goat, upper body of a lion & had a green snake for a tail; the tail moved as if it had a mind of it&#39;s own. It was also naked. &quot;Hello Sarah.&quot; The chimera creature said to Sarah&#39;s shock with Maxwell&#39;s voice. The snake tail then spoke with Andrew&#39;s voice &quot;Sssup.&quot; Sarah yelled &quot;Maxwell?! Andrew?! That you?!&quot; &quot;It&#39;s us Sarah.&quot; Maxwell said sitting down at the table. The snake tail that was Andrew came into view. &quot;I didn&#39;t know you could be merged together like this.&quot; Maxwell answered &quot;You can. We proof of that.&quot; Andrew nodded with a &quot;It&#39;sss great.&quot; Sarah asked curious &quot;So how&#39;s it work?&quot; Maxwell answered &quot;Well I can eat & drink or Andrew can to feed my body & his body. Our bodies feed each other.&quot; Andrew then jumped in &quot;But I have no pissss or ssshit holessss. All my wasste goesss through Maxwell&#39;sss body. I also have no sesex organs i.e.penisess or ballss.&quot; Sarah amazed asked &quot;Does it matter where someone who is a snake is attached to the person&#39;s body? Or how many?&quot; Maxwell answered &quot;No. Not at all.&quot; Sarah quickly whipped out her cellphone & gestured for Maxwell to stand up. Sarah did a conference call between her other friends Lucy, Richard, Philip, Wendy, David & Abby. &quot;Hey guys. You know how we all talked about Gorgons & snakes?&quot; The reply was all yes in various ways. Sarah turned the phone to video chat & pointed the phone at Maxwell & Andrew the anthromorphic chimera. &quot;Hi.&quot; Both Maxwell & Andrew said. There was a lot of shocked talk. Sarah said then &quot;I want to become a naga type Gorgon. A Gorgon that has a snake tail instead of legs & her whole body is covered in scales with a slight snake head. And I want you guys to be my 6 snakes for hair.&quot; There was excited talk about that. All their answers were various ways to say yes. &quot;How about tomorrow after at about 3 pm for us to be merged together into a Gorgon?&quot; There were various excited yes answers. Richard was the first to ask &quot;Maxwell? Andrew? Uh...&quot; Maxwell just said &quot;Call us, me chimera.&quot; Richard reasked &quot;Ok chimera can you explain what it&#39;s like to be a merged creature?&quot; Maxwell answered &quot;Sure.&quot; Lucy interrupted &quot;Should we be able to speak as snakes?&quot; There was a quick discussion between Sarah, Lucy, Richard, Wendy, David, Abby & Phillip.  It was decided that Richard, Lucy, Wendy, David, Abby & Phillip won&#39;t be able to speak as snakes; only hiss sounds & the like. Also they would be genderless. And they would all give up their names to be nameless snakes. Only Sarah would have a name. Now that was settled they all began asking Chimera about being a merged being. And Chimera answered all their questions the best to their ability. It got late & as Sarah was about to end the conference call & leave Maxwell asked curious &quot;You going to be naked like us as a Gorgon?&quot; Sarah answered &quot;Yes. Can&#39;t see any sense in wearing clothes as a mostly snake creature.&quot; This seemed to prompt Abby to say &quot;We should all go together naked to the Transformation Center.&quot; David said &quot;Would make sense sense none of us will ever be wearing anything ever again.&quot; Wendy then said &quot;Yeah. We won&#39;t have a mess of clothes to take off for our merged transformation.&quot; &quot;I&#39;ll take you in my van then.&quot; Maxwell suggested. Everyone loved that idea; so that was the plan. &quot;I&#39;ll call them right now & explain our transformation & pay for it by credit card right now.&quot; Sarah said. Again everyone loved that idea. Sarah hung up & did just that. <br />
The next day...<br />
Sarah, Lucy, Wendy, David, Abby, Richard & Phillip all got out of the van at the Transformation Center. They were all naked. &quot;Soon we&#39;ll be a Gorgon Sarah.&quot; Richard said with a smile. &quot;Soon we&#39;ll be your snake hair.&quot; Wendy said with a smile. Sarah said with a smile &quot;I can&#39;t thank you guys enough for agreeing to this.&quot; David said with a smile &quot;No thanks necessary. We all want this.&quot; The 7 headed inside & they soon saw an anthromorphic cat of some kind (naked of course). He said a bit surprised &quot;You all did come naked as you said you would.&quot; &quot;Only made sense to.&quot; Abby stated. The cat agreed. The cat lead them to the Transformation Chamber & Richard joked to Sarah &quot;Soon we&#39;ll be your snake hair Medusa.&quot; Sarah looked at them & smiled &quot;Medusa. I like it. I will be Medusa my snakes.&quot; They all entered the chamber together. The chamber kicked on & their transformation began.<br />
An hour later a creature with a snake&#39;s tail instead of legs, a slight snake head, scales covering it&#39;s body & 6 moving snakes on its head where hair should be came slithering out of the building; a Gorgon. The van side door opened & the Gorgon slithered into the van & closed the door. &quot;It&#39;s us Chimera.&quot; She said. The snakes hissed angry. &quot;Oh sorry. We agreed it to only be me Medusa; not us. Less confusing.&quot; Sarah now Medusa corrected. Chimera looked back & Maxwell said &quot;You look amazing.&quot; Andrew then said &quot;I don&#39;t mean to offend but you look awesssome together.&quot; Medusa & the snakes were happy to hear that. &quot;I have to agree Snake.&quot; Medusa asked confused &quot;Snake?&quot; Andrew now Snake explained &quot;We decided I ssshould go by Sssnake Tail or Sssnake for ssshort & Maxwell by Chimera.&quot; Medusa thought about that & said &quot;Yeah. It&#39;s less confusing.&quot; Her snakes agreed too (though they couldn&#39;t say it). &quot;Aslo Medusa is a cool name. It&#39;s so fitting to you now.&quot; Chimera stated. &quot;Agreed.&quot; Snake Tail nodded in agreement. Medusa asked &quot;You guys hungry?&quot; Chimera & Snake Tail answered in unison &quot;I could eat.&quot; Medusa commented &quot;I want to try swallowing food whole. I had myself remodeled to be able to unhinge my jaws & swallow food whole like any other snake.&quot; Snake Tail told her &quot;It&#39;s really cool Medussa.&quot; Chimera chimed in &quot;Even to watch.&quot;<br />
