<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff wanted to be a magician but what kind of magician name was Jeff? He wished he had a name like Cyrus or Jasper or Callum. He could make great magician stage names out of those but who would take Jeff the Magnificent seriously?<br />
<br />
Besides, Jeff was a little clumsy and that made his magic not so impressive. When he had tried to put on a show, the card he hid up his sleeve slid out onto the floor for everyone to see and the linking rings came unlinked when he didn&#39;t want them to. Not only couldn&#39;t he come up with any new tricks to impress, he couldn&#39;t even do the old tricks correctly.<br />
<br />
Then one day, he got a Chronivac. After a little experimenting, Jeff realized he could use the Chronivac to improve his show. So he set to work programming the Chronivac so that when he pushed a letter on the portable emitter, it would trigger the transformation he programmed into it. He also set the awareness setting so that everyone would think, whatever happened, it was just part of the show, that if anyone saw the portable emitter, they would think it was just his magic wand.<br />
<br />
Jeff also made some other changes before the show, mostly to himself, such as making himself look more handsome and magical and changing his name to Cyrus so he could bill himself as Cyrus the Cryptic. Then he called his high school to enter into the upcoming talent contest.<br />
<br />
He decided to transform Dean, his best friend, into his lovely assistant. Now Cyrus did not want to change Dean&#39;s gender but he did make some other alterations such as making Dean look more like a twink with sexy red hair and a sexy body. Dean&#39;s name was changed to Jasper and even Jasper&#39;s personality had some modifications made to it. Cyrus didn&#39;t make any drastic changes because he still wanted his best friend Jasper to be the same as he&#39;d always been. Cyrus just moved certain traits along a continuum to a more agreeable setting.<br />
<br />
The time came for the show. Cyrus wore a magicians style tuxedo. Jasper wore a glittery, sequined, sexy, cobalt blue outfit. Other than being blue instead of red, Jasper&#39;s outfit was very similar to the outfit Harry Styles wore in the video As It Was.<br />
<br />
The high school audience seemed bored. Cyrus wasn&#39;t the first act and many of the acts so far had been meh. There was one duet that was pretty good and the cheerleaders did a funny skit impersonating the teachers and other staff but the audience did not expect Cyrus the Cryptic to be any good.<br />
<br />
Mr. LeRon, the drama teacher, acted as emcee announcing each act. When he announced Cyrus the Cryptic, a pair of legs walked out on stage while a voice could be heard off stage saying, &quot;Hey, get back here, what do you think you&#39;re doing?&quot; The legs turned around and walked off stage. Then Cyrus walked on stage holding his &quot;wand&quot; and saying, &quot;Sorry folks, sometimes my legs have a mind of their own. I am Cyrus the Cryptic here to amaze you with my cryptic power. I&#39;d also like to introduce you to my handsome assistant, Jasper.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cyrus pointed off stage but no one came out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jasper, that&#39;s your cue. Where are you buddy? Excuse me folks while I go find out where Jasper is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cyrus walked off stage. From off stage he called, &quot;It&#39;s okay folks I found Jasper. Apparently he got himself plastered.&quot; Cyrus came back out rolling a piece of plastered wall with a picture of Jasper on it.<br />
<br />
The audience began to pay attention.<br />
<br />
Cyrus said, &quot;Yea, when Jasper gets himself plastered. There is only one cure. Coffee.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cyrus pulled out a cup of coffee and put it up to Jasper&#39;s lips allowing him to drink. Jasper began to inflate slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unfortunately it looks like Jasper is too plastered for just one cup of coffee. We&#39;re going to need a lot of coffee.&quot; Cyrus walked off stage and came back with a coffee urn. Jasper drank and inflated more but it still wasn&#39;t enough.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Jasper, you really got yourself plastered this time. Even an entire urn isn&#39;t enough.&quot; Cyrus put the urn on a table and pulled out a large cloth which he draped in front of the urn and then pulled back to reveal three urns. Then Cyrus took each urn over to Jasper one at a time until Jasper completely inflated and pulled himself off the wall.<br />
<br />
Jasper sputtered, &quot;Okay, that&#39;s enough, I&#39;m fine now.&quot;<br />
<br />
The audience started clapping. Cyrus and Jasper bowed but Cyrus said, &quot;Wait folks, that is just the beginning.&quot; The audience quieted down.<br />
<br />
&quot;For my next trick, I would like to have a volunteer from the audience.&quot;<br />
<br />
Several hands went up and Cyrus examined the crowd until he found Chad who didn&#39;t have his hand up.<br />
<br />
Chad was the school bully. He didn&#39;t do any bullying himself. He was too popular and respected to do the bullying himself. What Chad did have though was a group of goons that did whatever Chad told them too and Chad would tell them to beat certain kids up or steal their shoes or squirt glue on them. Most people did not know that Chad was behind it all but Cyrus knew.<br />
<br />
Cyrus pointed his &quot;wand&quot; at Chad and Chad raised his hand. Chad looked up in wonder that his hand was raised but Cyrus said, &quot;Chad, thank you for volunteering. Would you come up here on stage, please.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad didn&#39;t want to go on stage but everyone around him cheered him on. So Chad adopted his best attitude of confidence and walked up on stage. Chad asked, &quot;What are you going to do, saw me in half?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cyrus said, &quot;No, that&#39;s not what I have planned for you. All I want is for you to step behind that curtain.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad waved to everyone before stepping behind the curtain. The curtain was arranged in a circle so no one could see Chad, not even from backstage.<br />
<br />
Cyrus pointed his wand at the curtain and said, &quot;magic words&quot;. Then Cyrus walked behind the curtain and a moment later came out holding Chad&#39;s shirt.<br />
<br />
Cyrus said, &quot;This is the magic trick where I change Chad&#39;s clothes while he&#39;s behind the curtain.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cyrus then walked behind the curtain again and a moment later came out with Chad&#39;s shoes and socks.<br />
<br />
The audience wondered why Chad kept silent. Did he even know that Cyrus was bringing his clothes out one at a time and dropping them on the stage? Either Cyrus was stripping Chad but Chad was not protesting or Cyrus somehow had exact duplicates of the clothes Chad wore.<br />
<br />
Cyrus walked behind the curtain again and came out with Chad&#39;s pants.<br />
<br />
Cyrus said, &quot;Sorry folks that this is taking so long. I must not be a good magician. This went faster in rehearsal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cyrus walked behind the curtain again and came out with a pair of sky blue boxers. Chad&#39;s girlfriend blurted out, &quot;How does he know the underwear Chad wears?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad, meanwhile, was completely aware that he was being stripped completely naked but Chad couldn&#39;t do anything. Cyrus could move Chad&#39;s arms and legs about however Cyrus wanted but Chad couldn&#39;t move any part of his own body. He couldn&#39;t even make a sound.<br />
<br />
Cyrus walked behind the curtain one more time and posed Chad. It was a very simple pose as if Chad was just casually standing around waiting for a bus.<br />
<br />
Then Cyrus came back out, pointed his &quot;wand&quot; at the curtain and said, &quot;magic words&quot;. Then Cyrus pulled back the curtain to reveal a marble statue of Chad. The marble was mostly white with a slight bluish tint. The statue looked exactly like Chad except that Cyrus had programmed the Chronivac to shrink Chad&#39;s genitals at the same time that it turned Chad into a statue.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was an uproar from the audience but Mr. LeRon came out to calm everyone down. &quot;It&#39;s just a statue. It&#39;s not Chad. I&#39;m sure Chad is hiding backstage somewhere.&quot; The audience quieted down.<br />
<br />
Cyrus said, &quot;Oh, this is Chad alright. I never thought Chad&#39;s danglies would be so tiny though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Some people laughed but some people wondered if Chad had agreed to let himself be humiliated this way. Why wasn&#39;t Chad out here protesting? Why was Chad still hiding?<br />
<br />
Cyrus said, &quot;If you wish to examine the statue for yourself to see if it really is Chad or not, my assistant, Jasper, will carry Chad out to the concession stand and leave him there for your inspection.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jasper came out and clowned around pretending to wonder how to pick Chad up without touching Chad&#39;s privates. Jasper even grabbed Chad&#39;s genitals and quickly let go. Finally, Jasper stuck his fingertips up Chad&#39;s butt crack and lifted.<br />
<br />
Chad was not as heavy as a statue. Otherwise, twink Jasper would not have been able to lift Chad. But not only did twink Jasper lift Chad but twink Jasper began to twirl Chad around his body and over his shoulder like Jasper was dancing with a mop instead of with a real live statue. Then twink Jasper carried Chad off stage.<br />
<br />
Chad felt dizzy, violated and humiliated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now for my next trick . . .&quot;</p>
