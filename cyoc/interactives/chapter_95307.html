<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate looked to his friends who all seemed a bit unsure themselves. He looked back to Vincent and nodded. &quot;Yes, I&#39;d like to join.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent! Anyone else?&quot; asked Vincent in his gruffed voice.<br />
<br />
Nate turned back to his friends, all who shook their heads. Jamie and Tiana then turned and started looking into other options but Dylan hung around, a little more unsure. Nate turned back to Vincent, looking visibly excited. He had a life long interest in werewolves and had fantasized about turning into one. Now he finally had the chance to turn into one. <br />
<br />
&quot;Apparently not,&quot; replied Vincent. &quot;Follow me.&quot; <br />
<br />
Vincent stood up and walked through the door to the back of the building. Nate followed the werewolf with a mix of excitement and apprehension. He looked at the way the black furred werewolf walked and couldn&#39;t help but think that would be him soon enough. He looked at the strong wolf&#39;s musculature and then down at his chubby self. Vincent opened the door to a small room, no bigger than the average bedroom. There was a table and a few chairs in the middle. One wall was all mirrors but other than that the room was non-descript with simple off-white walls and a tile floor to match. Vincent stepped inside and gestured for Nate to follow. <br />
<br />
&quot;Close the door and have a seat at the table.&quot; Vincent took a seat on one side of the table and Nate took a seat at the opposite side.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you wish to be a werewolf?&quot; asked Vincent. <br />
<br />
&quot;Since it&#39;s just the two of us, yes. I&#39;ve wanted nothing more. I&#39;ve fantasized about it ever since I was a young boy.&quot; Nate looked at the werewolf dead one, without wavering one bit to let him know he was serious. <br />
<br />
&quot;Transforming into a werewolf is painful and arduous, especially the first time. Is that something you would be able to deal with?&quot; Vincent looked back at him with the same intensity. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I think I can,&quot; replied Nate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; growled Vincent. Before he knew what was happening, Vincent grabbed Nate&#39;s right arm and sank his large, sharp fangs right into the tender flesh of Nate&#39;s forearm. Nate cried out in surprise and pain. Just as quickly, Vincent let go and backed away. Nate held his bleeding arm over the table, not wanting to get any on his clothes. Vincent walked over to the door, opened it and grabbed a small towel off the table and then closed the door again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah...it stings. Oh, it really stings...&quot; cried out Nate as he felt the sharp pains radiate through his body. Nate took the towel from Vincent and wrapped it around his wound. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the gift of the bite. It&#39;s working it&#39;s way through your body. And once it does, your transformation will begin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate looked at Vincent and smiled. &quot;Really?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shouldn’t be long now,” growled Vincent. Nate pulled back the towel and walked over to the sink by the door. He washed away the blood and was surprised to see the wound had already healed. This was really happening. He turned back to Vincent with a look of shock on his face. “Ah, yes. Any moment now indeed.”<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Nate felt a sharp pain radiate through his body, followed by another. He cried out in shock and anguish as he suddenly felt incredibly warm. He felt a strong jolt of pain in his mouth as a couple of his teeth felt loose and then came free of his mouth. He spit them out into his hand in shock. <br />
<br />
He walked over to the mirror to check out his reflection, shocked to see fangs starting to grow in where his usual human teeth had been. The changes came faster then as Nate fell to his knees and began to feel his entire body start to change and reform suddenly. He felt an itching all over as fur started to grow in and he watched in shock as his nails grew out into thick, sharp claws. Even though the change was painful, he was also finding it intensely pleasurable. He heard a tearing sound that he realized was the back of his shirt as his back muscles reformed. He ripped off the remains of his t-shirt and marveled as his extra fat seemed to be disappearing as his midsection grew tighter and more muscular. He ran his claws through the dense fur growing in, letting out some pleasurable growls. He watched in the mirror as his ears grew to large points and smiled. The dense brown fur framed his face, now far more beastial and darker with a lupine nose and a mouth full of large fangs. There was a loud popping noise as his shoes slowly ripped apart as his feet stretched and reformed into large digitigrade paws. <br />
<br />
Nate slowly stood up again on his newly reformed feet. He turned to Vincent, smiling, revealing his new large fangs. <br />
<br />
“Welcome to the pack, my friend.”<br />
<br />
“You mean this is permanent?” growled Nate, surprised at his deeper voice.<br />
<br />
“Of course. Why delay the inevitable. I knew you’d want it for good.”<br />
<br />
Nate threw back his head and let out a loud howl of joy. He couldn’t believe his fantasy had come true.</p>
