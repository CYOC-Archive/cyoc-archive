<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Damon wishes for power and for immortality too! Like that Damon will be the real king of the jungle! And Damon will be very handsome too!&quot; exclaimed Damon, his head spinning with all the possibilities and adventures his new life promises.<br />
The genie smiled and snapped her fingers.<br />
&quot;Eternal youth! Damon wants eternal youth too!&quot; he shouted, all smiles and jumping up and down. <br />
The genie snapped her fingers again.<br />
&quot;Calm down now. It&#39;s a lot of wishes. A bit hard for the magic to fill all of those so fast. Wait a moment, if you will, jungle boy.&quot;<br />
Around Damon, reality altered itself. He found himself in a warm humid jungle, teeming with life and noice. His hair reached his shoulders and was lustrous and wavy. His muscles bulged under his smooth skin with no body hair, including his impressive abs. His fur loincloth covered privates that he could guess were just as big and virile.<br />
&quot;Is Damon going to live forever now?&quot; he asked the genie.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a lot to ask for in one wish so the magic had to accommodaye things. It does indicate that a lost stature, relic of an ancient civilixzation, is inside this cave in the distance,&quot; she explained, pointing to the mouth of a cave far away.<br />
&quot;Great! Me go! You follow Damon!&quot;<br />
The genie sighed as Damon had fun swinging from branch to branch and experimenting with his new muscular body. She couldn&#39;t see precisely where the magic was going but at least the handsomeness part was fulfilled. And somewhat the power part too, for who was into that type. She hoped the immortality part of the wish would go just as smoothly. <br />
<br />
The cave quickly turned out to be a long winding corridor that twisted underground. Damon made himself a torch and went in without a second thiught. At first there were bats but those weren&#39;t dangeroux. Yet as he went down motre and more, he was bothered by sticky enormous spider webs. He was covered in the damn things! At long last, still covered in webs, he reached a great cave, with a gold statue on a pedestal with intricate carvings. <br />
&quot;You need to touch the statue to receive immortality.&quot;<br />
&quot;And etetnal youth? Damonbwants that!&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, I guess so,&quot; shrugged the genie.<br />
&quot;Damon thinks it&#39;s a breeze! Damon powerful! Damon find it easy! Damon can get it easy! Damon soon great!&quot;<br />
Well, &#39;Damon is smart&#39; is not part of the package, thought the genie. The boy must have lost some of his intelligence during the process of gaining more muscle mass. So of course the youth rushed without thinking towardds the statue.<br />
<br />
But not for long, alas for him. He struggled against more spiderwebs and as he got away from a spot. He turned to see a giant spider, three times his size, approach him.<br />
&quot;Genie! Damon scared! Damon need help!&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t, master. Your current wish for power and eternal life is still unfolding so you have wait until you make another one.&quot;<br />
&quot;But Damon not understand! Damon not immortal, Damon going to die!&quot; he screamed as he attempted to get away from the spider but crashed to the ground, feet getting caught in a low webbing.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure how it can turn out but I can&#39;t do anything. We&#39;ve got to wait. The magic knows where it&#39;s going. I&#39;m merely a conduit for it.&quot;<br />
Damon continued screeching as the spider approached. It shot threads of its silk at him and quickly he was tightly wrapped and incapable of speaking clearly. He wriggled on the ground, certain the spider would eat him. But the huge animal picked him up and hung him to the roof of the cave, leaving only his feet unwrapped. To eat him at leisure later. Or so Damon thought.<br />
<br />
The spider went to pick up of bowl-shaped stone and grabbed the gold statue. It filled the stone with water and dipped the statue in. Then, it replaced the statue back and climbed up it web to Damon. It unwrapped the the silk covering his mouth and made him drink the water. After the bowl was empty, the spider shot another thread to gag Damon again and went down to rest.<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; the genie said. &quot;The spider made you drink from water where the statue was and you&#39;re now immortal and with eternal youth. But why it did that is still a mystery. Again, let&#39;s wait.&quot;<br />
Damon struggled but if elastic to the extreme, the web did not let him move much. Struggling was futile and he could only breathe and curse and moan incoherently. The water given by the spider also sloshed uncomfortably in his belly. He felt heavy and exhausted by his struggling, he let his eyes droop. <br />
<br />
When he woke up, the spider was detaching him from the stalagmite he was dangling from. Sleepily, he saw that the spider was holding him aloft, above its body, between two claws and using its six others to climb the ceiling of the cave and get out through an opening well-concealed at the far side of it. Outside the sun was setting and the spider moved on, a squirming and moaning furious Damon in its clutches. The genie followed silently behind. At long last, the spider halted near a river pooling at the foot of a waterfall tumbling from a cliff. Again it hung up Damon to a protruding rock and went away, gathering things here and there. Still feeling bloated and weak, Damon squirmed but only his feet could really move. Then, the spider picked him up and settled him gently where it had busied itself. It was a carved out trunk, rubbed smooth, and filled with flowers. Damon, once deposited there, felt confused and ridiculous. But as he wriggled, he felt a rocking motion. The spider was rocking him with one of its legs, as if he was some sort of giant baby! He screamed for help but the genie shook her head, still powerless, leaving Damon still at the mercy of the magic wish he had made himself. In spite of his utter humiliation of being a jungle boy reduced to such a situation, the proud immortal youth was calmed down by the smell and sweetness of the flowers and fell asleep again.  <br />
<br />
He woke up following grunts and clicks. He moved his head and gasped through his webbed binds. The spider was clicking furiously at a giant ape as big as it was! Damon hoped the chimp-like giant would squash the repulsive arachnid but it merely gave it bits of giant insects, grunting and pointing at Damon. Then it approached, making the youngster flinch. Yet the ape didn&#39;t eat him. It just cooed and kissed him. It then poked him with amused little grunts and when Damon squirmed and squealed, it poked him in his belly that seemed so much bigger than before and laughed in delight. The female monkey wasted no time in kissing and poking his feet that she found so adorable and suddenly incredibly ticklish, Damon could only twist and let out garbled and muffled protests and pleas. He writhed like a big grub, totally under the loving painless tickle torture of the female ape, as he noticed she had a flower behind her ear. She grunted at the spider and then effortlessly tore the webs from Damon&#39;s body. The boy was appalled at the body in question. He was chubby, with more fat than muscles and his loincloth covered tiny privates. His fingers looked like little sausages and his feet were fat and folded in fat and soft skin it seemed. With sluggish movements, he check his face and noticed it was fat, baby-like and his hair now short and sticking out in all directions. What had happened to his handsome beefcake body? What had this happened. He tried to talk but only gurgles and cries came out of his mouth. And he had no energy to keep the ape&#39;s hands away from him! Just uncoordinated movements and unimpressed  by his cries, the ape chided him softly, tore his loincloth from him and proceeded to tickle him some more, taking delight in his armpits and ribs. The ape cooed, clucked and made soft noises that were exactly the sort any human would give to a fussy baby deserving to be tickled into submission. Once he was breathless and utterly compliant and incapable of moving, indeed a giggling mess, the giant ape gave the spider more food and made a diaper out of leaves and stuffed with soft moss to cover Damon&#39;s privates. She then forced coconut milk and banana and sweet potato puree into his mouth. Damon was too tired and feeble to resist, even when his new mommy patted him on her shoulder and he burped loudly. She then placed him again in his makeshift crib and rocked him to sleep. Before he drifted to sleep, Damon saw the genie and raised pleading eyes at her.<br />
&quot;The magic makes sense now. You wished for power and eternal youth. You&#39;ll get it but as a giant ape-man. Raised by a female giant ape, you&#39;ll grow up as a giant and be an immortal young one at that. Even if it&#39;ll take a very long time. You need to be raised as such, after all. You got your wishes, just not the way you wanted, that&#39;s all. Nothing I can do.&quot;<br />
Damon desperately gurgled something at her.<br />
&quot;No more wishes, sorry. I can&#39;t understand you so I cannot grant anything. Good luck. Try to make the best of it.&quot;<br />
She left, but not before snapping her fingers and making a pacifier, rattle, bonnet and little booties appear on Damon, all in jungle motifs, as well as a soft toy shaped like a monkey. She could help a bit that way, after all. But Damon did not see it as such and started crying, pushing the giant new mother to shush and rock him more, promising him with more coos all the love and tickles she would give to her new precious baby.</p>
