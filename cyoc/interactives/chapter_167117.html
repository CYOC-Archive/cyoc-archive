<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Her eyes had been locked on the doctor as he entered. Typical-looking man, lab coat, glasses, short hair, the works. As soon as she saw who was coming in behind him, however, Allison couldn&#39;t focus on anything else. <br />
<br />
The legs were what caught her attention first. Pale, smooth, going on forever, exposed by the crimson slit dress she was wearing. It hugged her frame so tightly showing off a pair of thighs that were hard not to imagine ones head nestled between, the way they flared out before curving up to her slender body. Her chest formed a true hourglass figure, large yet still entirely well-proportioned to the rest of her body. The line between them traced up to the choker-style neckline of her dress, and for the briefest moment, Allison imagined herself kissing her way up to that face - that long face, a perfect blend of asian and gemanic features, with dark, mysterious eyes, all framed by platinum blonde hair that hung down to her shoulders. Her ruby-red lips were curved into a smile - she knew exactly what effect she had on the young woman, and she relished in the feeling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm.&quot; Even in simple noises as she approached Allison&#39;s seat, that soothing kiwi accent was impossible to miss. &quot;Such a plain girl. You really are fortunate.&quot;<br />
<br />
She blushed, embarassed at her own relatively boring looks compared to the bombshell exmaining her. The doctor ignored them booth, busying himself with preparing a robotic arm with a syringe attachment as the woman continued to pace around the brunette, examining the form she was about to discard. &quot;Allison, was it? Allow me to introduce myself: Catherine Zhang, the woman you&#39;re going to be thanking every day of your life.&quot;<br />
<br />
The brunette felt a chill travel up her spine as she stopped next to her, leaning in close enough to whisper in her ear. &quot;You&#39;re about to become the most beautiful woman in the world.&quot;<br />
<br />
She was given no chance to ask who that woman was before the syringe plunged into her arm. She winced, fighting the urge to grab at the metal prick as it withdrew. Instantly a fan lowered from the ceiling, blowing hot and humid air at her body - supposedly, it helped accelerate the retrovirus&#39; changes. She&#39;d never really understood the science behind it all, and as the feeling of the process started to surge out from the injection site across her body, she had no time to consider it further.<br />
<br />
The skin, she had heard, was where it always started. The urban myth proved correct as she looked down, and found that there was a change in the coloration, beginning in her arm and spreading over her body. She was too distracted by the sight of her skin becoming paler, lightening gradually to remove years of natural tanning, to pay much heed as Catherine pulled the hospital gown from her body. If anything, it was fascinating to watch the discoloration spread over her chest and stomach, eventually covering her legs and rendering her looking like she avoided the sun in general.<br />
<br />
It was good she was looking at her legs, because that was where the next feeling began to build. A sense of... stretching, was the best way to describe it, primarily in her legs but across her whole body. Like she was being forcefully lengthed, pulled so as to increase her height. It hurt - oh god, it hurt, especially as her bones were forcibly lengthed. She started to cry, but her client merely closed her mouth, shaking her heard; she was not allowed to let out any moans or cries of pains as her body was altered.<br />
<br />
Her struggle to not scream in agony became a hundred times greater as the stretching sensation spread to more sensitive parts of her body. Her hips, and more noticeably, her breats, seemed to be on fire as their size was forcibly increased - along with their sensitivity. At the same time as she gripped the sides of the chair to grapple with the pain, her thighs briefly rubbed together, a reflexive response to the arousal that rippled through her body. She felt ashamed, so incredibly ashamed to be turned on by this torture, and that fact seemed to bring a smile to Catherine&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
Oh, her face - that was where it became truly unbearable. She could feel bones shifting, crushing, flattening and rearranging, the very shape of her skull altering. Never before had she imagined what it was like to have her brain squeezes, but now she got to experience that as her head narrowed ever so slightly. She finally let out one solitary moan through closed lips as her throat lit up with pain, the tone and accent one that she didn&#39;t even recognize. Her hair, once straight, was longer and wavier, she could tell from the way it now tickled the back of her neck.<br />
<br />
It seemed like the greatest mercy of her life when she finally felt the pain and burning subside. A few last sparks and bits of crunching signaled the end of her overwrite, the retrovirus having completed its job. Tears could no longer be held back, and she didn&#39;t even want to open her eyes - but she had to see what she&#39;d become. Truth be told, she&#39;d expected a monster to be staring back at her, some sort of abombination that would exist only for her client&#39;s derision. Instead, as her darkened eyes trailed over to the mirror, she found herself recoiling slightly in shock, for quite opposite regions.<br />
<br />
Staring back at her in the mirror was... Catherine. Catherine&#39;s body, rather. The woman herself leaned up, pressing the side of her head against her now-twin&#39;s with a devilish grin. &quot;I told you, dear - the most beautiful woman in the world.&quot; She briefly traced a hand down the side of Allison&#39;s altered face before standing up, snapping her fingers. &quot;Come along, dear. We have a great deal to discuss.&quot;</p>
