<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As I walked into the not-so-hallowed halls of East Jefferson High School, another thought occurred to me.  I had made it so that no one would notice my sudden appearance in front of the school.  But no one would know who the hell is was now.  I wasn't Joe Winslow anymore.  I guess I was Josephine Winslow.  But in order to make sure there wouldn't be any further complications, I wished that everyone besides me would always remember me as being Josephine, and not Joe.  I guessed that meant that even my mother would always think I was a girl.  Well, that wish could always be changed.<br />
<br />
In homeroom, the teacher, Mr. Benson, only called out &quot;Joe Winslow.&quot;  I said, &quot;Here,&quot; and nobody looked at me like there was something wrong.  I guess I insisted to be called &quot;Joe&quot; by everyone else.  Actually, &quot;Jo&quot; would be more accurate.<br />
<br />
So I went on to gym class.  I saw Kim and her good friend Rachel Warrick, another totally hot girl with whom I was friendly.  I decided not to talk to them, as I might do something stupid.  But being in the locker room changing into my gym uniform, and seeing a few hot girls in their bras and panties didn't do me any good.  I could feel my nipples harden under my bra immediately.  Well, at least I knew I still had a passion and desire for girls.  I certainly didn't want to get the hots for guys.<br />
<br />
Attendance in gym went off without a hitch as well.  Miss Rawlings, a mid-20s brunette who looked like she shouldn't have been a teacher, as she was too athletic and too good-looking, did not look at me weird when I answered my name.  We weren't doing anything particularly fun in gym right now.  We were doing all of the stuff for the President's physical fitness test.  What a laugh, I thought.  Who was the last President to be perfectly physically fit, I wondered.<br />
<br />
Then it became time for the class to end.  This, of course, was the part of the class I was waiting for.  There were shower stalls in the boys' locker room, so naturally there had to be stalls in the girls' room too.  It wasn't a requirement for all of us to shower after each gym class.  However, I always thought that Kim showered all the time, because in our next class, which was actually two periods later, her hair always looked to be a little wet.  Or maybe I was just being too presumptuous.  I was about to find out.<br />
<br />
Not surprisingly, most of the girls simply changed back into their regular clothes.  They all had their sprays and deodorants with them in order to wipe clean the stink of the gym and the locker room. <br />
 <br />
Miss Rawlings came into the room and found the row of lockers that Kim, Rachel, and a couple other girls were sharing at the present moment.  I was in the next row, but I could overhear what they were saying.  &quot;Kim, I'm going to leave the key in on my desk, like always.  You just take your time and find me before your next class.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, just like always,&quot; Kim responded cheerfully.  Hmm, I wondered what that was all about.  Miss Rawlings walked away and so too did most of the girls in the room.  In fact, I think that only Kim, Rachel, and myself were the only ones left in the room now.  &quot;Can you grab me a towel?&quot; I heard Kim ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, just a sec,&quot; Rachel said.  I heard her walk into the aisle leading to the locker room door, where Miss Rawlings' office was situated just off to the side.  There was definitely nothing on her feet, as I could hear the cold slap of bare skin against the hard floor.  I peeked out from around the row of lockers separating me from the girl I fantasized.  My eyes were greeted with the sight of Rachel's naked body walking away from me.  God, she had a gorgeous figure.  And her ass was so perfectly rounded.  I quickly ducked my head out of sight, not wanting her to see me.  Well, at least I had that question answered.  <br />
<br />
At this point I had stripped down to my bra and panties.  Confident that they were both showering, I decided that I should as well.  I walked out from behind my hiding place, in order to get a towel for myself.  I saw Rachel bending over and picking up a couple of towels.  She looked up at me and saw me approach.  &quot;Oh, here you go, Jo,&quot; she said.  She smiled as she tossed a towel up at me.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; I said, just a little flabbergasted.  I found it interesting how she wasn't at all embarrassed to be naked in front of me.  I guess she had the &quot;we're all girls&quot; attitude.  Ha!  If she only knew.<br />
<br />
I retreated back to my locker, and stripped off my bra and panties.  I heard Rachel and Kim walk into the shower and start running the water.  I followed in after them.  The girls shower room did not have stalls.  That was funny, I thought.  The boys room had separate, individual stalls.  But the girls shower was a community shower, so to say.  Rachel and Kim were showering right next to each other.  I picked a shower head about 3 or 4 spots away from them.  I turned the water on and let it run over my body.  I felt my nipples tingle as cold water splashed against them.  I turned it to warm as quickly as I could as I heard two soft giggles emerge from the other two.  I glanced at them and saw them smiling at me.  &quot;Too cold,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea,&quot; Kim agreed.  &quot;You have to make sure you get them turned to warm and then let them get warm first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; I said.  I guess it was obvious I didn't normally do this.  And they did, from the looks of it.  I tried to ignore them, or rather ignore what they were doing so it didn't appear that I was staring at them.  But after a few minutes, something quite unexpected happened.</p>
