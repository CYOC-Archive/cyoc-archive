<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Here&#39;s the shower,&quot; Megumi said as she led Rachel to the shower.  &quot;I&#39;ll take care of your clothes while you shower off.  Hopefully, your dad won&#39;t suspect a thing when and if he gets here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Rachel said, &quot;For everything.&quot;  She peeled off her shirt and pants and then started to remove her bra when she looked over at Megumi.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Megumi said, &quot;We did share a moment together.&quot;  Megumi grinned as Rachel rolled her eyes and continued to strip.  Once the last piece of clothing was off her body, she handed her clothes to Megumi.  &quot;I&#39;ll put these in the laundry, and I&#39;ll come back when these are done.  You enjoy your shower.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Rachel said as she climbed into the shower.  She turned on the hot water, and water flowed from the showerhead onto Rachel&#39;s body.  Rachel sighed as the hot water flowed down her body and it seemed to take her stress away.  Her mind replayed the events of the past couple of days.  Her family moved here to support Frank as he went to college.  They didn&#39;t know that this town was a town of were-beasts, and they soon learned that at least one of them had to turn in order to stay in the town.  Rachel, at that time, was a bit curious about things, but Richard, Rachel&#39;s dad, wasn&#39;t having any of it.  He was about ready to load up the van and head out, but something happened to the van that prevented that from happening.  That evening, Rose had enough of Richard&#39;s bullishness, and the two of them went out into the woods.  When they came back, Richard was now a werelion.<br />
<br />
Rachel took a bar of soap as she continued her memories.  At the same time, Rachel was learning about werefoxes and was meeting with Megumi.  Megumi showed herself as a werevixen and Rachel was impressed by it.  Megumi offered to turn Rachel, but Rachel turned it down saying she needed to learn more.  Rachel then met up with Aaron.  At the time, Rachel couldn&#39;t exactly tell what she was thinking except how handsome he was.  Rachel was a bit daring and asked to see Aaron&#39;s werefox form, which he consented to.  Rachel&#39;s face warmed up as she remembered how willing he was to strip in front of her which led to their first encounter.  Rachel asked about the werefox&#39;s ability to please their partners, which Aaron readily showed.  At the same time, Rachel played with Aaron and gave him a handjob.  This almost turned Rachel into a werevixen had Aaron not wiped his cum away on her face.  As Rachel remembered this, she could feel her body responding to it.  She turned on the cold water to help relieve the sexual tension.<br />
<br />
The next day she learned about werebears and werecows.  She met up with a werebear guy whose name she couldn&#39;t remember right off hand, and she was impressed with the characters of werebears.  She had a thing for bears, and she was, at least in the present, interested.  After school, she met up with her best friend Melissa Jenkins and went to her place.  Rachel learned about werecows and watched as her friend transformed into her cow fursona.  Rachel looked down at her breasts and couldn&#39;t help but notice that she was tiny compared to Megumi and Melissa.  Her memories continued to her going to the hospital to get some were birth control pills, but they were closed for the day.  She heard a noise in the woods going home and decided to investigate despite her concerns about her safety.  She discovered a couple of lesbian werefoxes going at it, and she found herself almost joining them.  Megumi found Rachel and they had a discussion, followed by a session of their own.  Megumi again offered herself but Rachel declined again, albeit it was a bit harder this time.  Megumi led Rachel to her home and Rachel was taking a shower there to wash off some of the sexual scent.  Rachel finished wiping herself down with the soap and then rinsed off her body.  She turned off the water and opened the curtain when she received an unexpected visitor.<br />
<br />
Aaron walked into the bathroom and asked, &quot;Meg?  You there?&quot;  Instead, he was greeted with the sight of Rachel stepping out of the shower.  Aaron stopped talking as he stared at the now naked Rachel.  Rachel, whose first instinct would have been to scream and cover herself, instead stared at him.  She looked at him as he was in werefox fursona while he stared back at her.  She stepped out of the shower as the two teens looked at each other.  Neither of them said a word as the two of them looked at the other&#39;s body.  It was clear that Aaron was attracted as his penis started to appear out of its sheath.    <br />
<br />
Without an invitation, an image formed in Rachel&#39;s mind of Aaron and Rachel in a bed, with Aaron pounding his penis into her.  She took a step towards him.  <br />
<br />
In Aaron&#39;s mind, he saw a flash of her in a wedding dress as he removed her veil and the two of them shared a kiss.  He took a step into the bathroom towards her.  <br />
<br />
Rachel then had an image of her walking into a new home with Aaron, her belly swollen with new life.  She took another step.<br />
<br />
Aaron saw an image of him returning home from work.  Rachel was in the kitchen cooking up food while three children were playing in the living room.  He took another step.<br />
<br />
The two shared the last image of the two of them, sitting on a porch in rocking chairs enjoying a sunset somewhere.  It was at this point that the werefox bond, teenage hormones, and instinct took over as the two closed the distance between each other.  She pressed her body into him, and he pressed his body into hers.  Rachel could feel his fur on her skin, and it seemed to light her on fire.  She could feel his now fully erect penis on her belly.  Aaron shifted his hips a little, and Rachel moaned as she could feel the movement of his fur on her skin.  The two looked at each other as the two embraced.  Rachel made the first move as she wrapped her leg around Aaron&#39;s waist.  Aaron responded by grabbing Rachel&#39;s butt and lifting her up against his body.  Rachel responded by wrapping her other leg around his waist.  The two of them were now painfully aware of how close Aaron&#39;s penis was to Rachel&#39;s vaginal lips.  Rachel shifted her hips while her legs were wrapped around him, pulling him into her.  She moaned as Aaron thrust his hips forward, filling her completely and taking her virginity.  After that initial thrust, the two of them were connected.<br />
<br />
&quot;What...What are you two doing?&quot; a female voice exclaimed.  The two of them snapped out of whatever stupor they were in as they both turned to see Megumi standing in the bathroom door with Rachel&#39;s clothing.  <br />
<br />
Rachel looked down and saw that Aaron was completely inside her.  &quot;Oh...oh god...&quot; she said as she tried to untangle herself off of Aaron.</p>
