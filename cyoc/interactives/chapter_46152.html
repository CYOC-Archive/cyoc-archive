<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex eventually wandered toward the local mall and looking around, he suddenly wondered something. Walking through the mall, he made his way toward what he considered to be stores aimed at females and only females.<br />
<br />
Entering the store, he began to browse, waiting for the clerk at the front to finish with the transaction she was ringing up and to come and ask him if he needed any assistance. When this didn't happen, Alex selected something from the rack and seeing it was a bathing suit, he immediately headed for the back of the store and the changing rooms, all the while expecting to be stopped by the shop attendant.<br />
<br />
Inside the changing rooms, Alex faced the mirror and thinking, &quot;Something looks off,&quot; he pulled off his shirt, shoes, pants and boxer briefs. Next he tucked his penis and testicles between his legs and began to pull on the swimwear...a biking with the top being strapless and being a band that went around his chest.<br />
<br />
Looking in the mirror, still thinking something was off...besides the fact that he was clearly male wearing a girl's bikini...he thought that if he had been born female he would look cute in this, especially if he had the appropriate breast size to fill the band that was fastened around his chest.<br />
<br />
Taking off the swimwear, Alex redressed and exited the changing room. Looking at the tag, he decided to buy the garment, something telling him that it would fit. Unsure of where this thought came from, Alex made his way to the front of the store and when greeted by the clerk, purchased the bikini, unaware that the article had shifted so that the bottom section now required to be tied in back...like it was making room for a tail.<br />
<br />
Satisfied with his purchase, he began to make his way through the mall, looking for any of his friends from school and wondering if they would notice anything different about him.<br />
<br />
When it became that none of his friends were at the mall, Alex prepared to leave, but stopped as he realised that he was passing the corridor that took people to the Men's and Woman's lavatories. Curious about something, he turned in that direction.<br />
<br />
Looking at the two signs, he wondered briefly if he was pushing his luck and then before he could change his mind, Alex swallowed and walked into the room marked Woman's.<br />
<br />
Inside the room was empty except for a bank of stalls, clearly hiding the toilets. Alex noted that there were no urinals and this confirmed that females did in fact pee sitting down. Suddenly a noise behind him announced the presence of a group of people entering and before he could hide, three girls entered.<br />
<br />
Instead of commenting what a perv he was for being in the Woman's Restroom, they walked past him, giggling and talking amongst themselves. As Alex moved toward a stall, he watched out of the corner of his eye as each stood before took something from their purses and standing in front of the mirror, they began to either reapply lip gloss, some type of facial cream or something that Alex couldn't fully see.<br />
<br />
Ducking into the stall, he undid his pants and sat down on the toilet, listening as the girls...who he realised as being his age and at least one of them was in his homeroom...talked amongst themselves and then one entered the stall next to Alex. After a bit, Alex decided enough was enough and realising that he did have to pee, he finished his business and high tailed it out of the restroom after washing his hands...just as the girl in the next stall exited and greeted her friends.<br />
<br />
Outside, he moved back down the corridor and out double doors into the courtyard outside. Breathing a sigh that nobody had called him a pervert or tried to alert the mall security or anything to that nature, Alex breathed another sigh and began to wander again. As he did, he unconsciously folded his arms across his chest like a lot of females did.<br />
<br />
Walking, Alex first wondered where he should go next. As he thought this over, it suddenly dawned on him what was different.<br />
<br />
Stopping in front of a window, Alex pretended to be looking at the objects on display. What he was really doing was staring at his hair, which had started to turn from its normal brown to a medium to dark shade of red.</p>
