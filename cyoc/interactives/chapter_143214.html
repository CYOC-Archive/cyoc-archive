<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jack Martin frowned, crumpling the divorce paperwork he had been served and pouring himself a drink. After years of marriage his wife had finally discovered he was cheating and served him with papers. Jacks wife was proving that the old adage of hell having no fury like a woman scorned was true. The alimony payments she was seeking would bankrupt him. On top of that his secretary Maggie was sueing him for sexual harassment. After discussing it with other lawyers in the firm he discovered that she had a strong case. Now his partners were distancing themselves from him to preserve the firm. A firm he himself had started. As the 52 year old drained his glass dry he heard a knock on his office door.<br />
<br />
“I said I didn’t want to be disturbed,” he barked. The knocking persisted causing Jack to slam his glass on his desk and approach the door. Angrily he threw it open, prepared to yell at whoever was disturbing him. Jack paused as he now gazed at the empty office. As he was about to close the door he noticed a small gift wrapped box sitting in front of his office. Cautiously he now picked it up, noticing a small card.<br />
<br />
Closing the door once more Jack placed the gift down as he read the card. “Inside is a gift for you,” he read. “With it you may make any wish you want.” Scoffing in annoyance Jack tossed the card to the side as he now unwrapped the gift. As he finished he noticed a small ring inside. “What is this,” he grumbled. “Damn thing looks like a wedding ring.” Sinking into is chair Jack now gazed at the photo of his wife and his secretary, the two women who were trying to ruin his wife.<br />
<br />
“Bithces,” he grumbled. “I wish those two had never been born.”<br />
<br />
As he said those words he was startled as the ring in his hand began to glow. Dropping it to the floor he gazed at it in shock before turning back towards the photos. Jack watched as the photos of his wife and mistress began to fade from sight. Slowly but surely Jack watched as their images grew fainter and fainter until they disappeared from sight. As that happened he watched as the room seemed to shimmer for a moment before growing dark once more. “What the hell just happened,” he murmured. Glancing down at his desk Jack was shocked to see that the divorce paperwork had vanished from his desk. At first he tried to find but soon discovered it was nowhere in his office.<br />
<br />
As Jack ran a hand through his grey hair he felt a tingle emanate from his ring finger. Looking down at his wedding ring he watched as slowly but surely the ring began to disintegrate. In only moments the ring dissolved from his finger, meaning he was no longer married. Still shocked he now quickly picked up the ring he had dropped giggling softly as he realized what had just happened.<br />
<br />
“Huh it worked,” he laughed softly. A laugh that grew in volume as he realized he had just made his problems disappear. Still laughing Jack reached for his bottle of scotch, pouring a glass for himself to toast. “To new beginnings,” he smirked. As he took a large swig from the glass he smiled momentarily before doubling over in pain.Jack screamed in agony, it felt as if his insides were on fire. Now sweating profusely Jack stood before gasping in shock at his appearance in the window of his office.<br />
<br />
Jack was no longer a man in his 50s, if anything he appeared to be in his early 30s once more. Jacks grey hair had returned to its previous honey blond color, while the wrinkles and age spots had vanished leaving a young man in its place. Before Jack could say anything else he felt another sharp pain rack his body. Jack gazed up into the window aghast at what he saw.<br />
<br />
The young man in the mirror was growing steadily younger. Now Jack appeared in his mid twenties and was quickly growing younger still. Jack felt his clothing become looser as he was now just a young man in college. As he tried to stand he leaned against his desk, looking at his youthful hands. “What’s happening to me,” he choked.<br />
<br />
The now 18 year old honey haired boy stumbled as he tried to gain his bearings. Jack was still growing younger as he descended through his teens. A young boy of 14 now tried to find the ring he had only moments ago, finding it was missing. “Where did it go,” he said, his voice rising in tenor with each word he spoke.<br />
<br />
Jack was now only a boy of 12. The honey haired boys dress pants collapsed off his thinning waist as he tripped. Jack had no idea what was happening but he needed to get away and fast. Quickly a now 10 year old boy kicked away his overly long shoes and pants as he stumbled towards the door of his office.<br />
<br />
Jack was continueing to grow younger as he stumbled towards the door, growing steadily younger with each step he took. By the time he had reached the door the young 5 year old tried to free his hands from his overly large sleeves and escape. Frantically the young boy tried to turn the knob, watching as the doorknob grew higher and higher. Soon the young boy of 18 months wobbled on his infantile legs, collapsing in a heap of clothing. As Jack crept under a year he began to ball at the top of his lungs like the infant he was. The cries grew in pitch until growing quiet, leaving a small newborn boy tangled in the remnants of the once powerful lawyers business suit.<br />
<br />
“That should do,” Lilith stated as she raised her hand, ending the spell. Slowly she now approached the tiny infant picking him up in her arms. The small boy barely moved and appeared to be sleeping soundly. “”How will this work,” Baba asked as she gazed at the infant. “He’s far too young to go to high school now.”<br />
<br />
“That my dear Baba is true,” Lilith smirked. “However time for us is not an issue. We shall journey back and raise this child in Kellies timeline until he is old enough. Then, we shall give him the power to be able to stand as an equal to Katie and Kellie.”<br />
<br />
“Give him power,” Circe asked. “Lilith you intend to raise this child?!”<br />
<br />
“I most certainly do,” Lilith responded with a smirk. “Merlin is not the only one who cAn raise a child Of is own. I will raise this child as I have raised countless others. He will love us as his mother, aunt, and grandmother. Together we will give him the tools to make him a truely powerful warlock. And when he is ready, we will give him the knowledge of his former wife and daughter.”<br />
<br />
Cricket, Baba Yaga, And Lilith now smiled as they gazed down at the small infant. They were now setting in motion a plan to tip the scales back towards the darkness.</p>
