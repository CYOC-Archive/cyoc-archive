<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your feet had changed into claws too, and they had ripped through your shoes. Your felt a painful crack in your legs and your feeling forwards onto all fours. Your face pushed out to form a muzzle and your teeth were replaced by jagged carnivorous teeth and you tongue became forked.<br />
<br />
&quot;This....hurts!&quot; You growl as two horns force themselves out of the back of your head and curve forward with sharp ends pointing at whatever you were facing. Droze watched you and whimpered,&quot;I...I didn’t know...I.....I’m sorry. P...please don’t be....&quot; You interrupt Doze by yelling as three new appendages destroy your remaining clothes. <br />
<br />
Those two appendages were two wings that grew out to match your body length, and a lizard tail that was also the length of your body. You start breathing heavily now as the most painful parts felt like they were over as your horns turned a dark blue color, and your eyes became reptilian slits then their color became a bright yellow.<br />
<br />
As the scales spread across your back dark blue spikes emerged, and you growled trying to hold in your urges to cry out in pain. The final spike was on the tip of your tail, and it pointed out like an arrowhead. <br />
<br />
Now there was no more pain, just weird feelings as your wings developed blue flaps that matched my scales. You then paused as thick dark blue scales covered your underside, and your cock and balls turned black and reptilian. Your genitalia then receded into and nestled comfortably into a slit between your hind legs and you paused to stare at it for a few seconds before you turned your head back to Droze. You weren’t that big for a dragon, not even fully grown, and one could still consider you juvenile at first glance. You flapped you wings and you could feel the might of them, and when you flapped with all of your might you could actually get some lift off the ground but it was only a few inches.<br />
<br />
You then shook your head and faced Droze again, and he was just staring at you with a worried look on his face. &quot;Droze, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; You asked, wondering if he was shook up by witnessing your transformation.<br />
<br />
Droze looked up at you as you stood double his height and he had tears in his eyes and he sniffled before he asked,&quot;A...are you mad?&quot; You shook your head as your new instincts recognized Droze differently now, and you felt obligated to follow those instincts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would I be mad at you? You didn’t do anything to me. I thought you would be happy about this. This transformation just...hurt a lot, and that was all me...admittedly, heh.&quot; You said then chuckled at your new, younger sounding voice that sounded like a prepubescent teen.<br />
<br />
Droze paused then he nodded and smiled up at you and he tried to stand, but he fell and whimpered,&quot;Ow!&quot; You saw this then you looked at the ruined shirt and tore it off with your claws. The wound looked bad, but it wasn’t as bad as before as you were able to stop the bleeding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Droze, just lay down where you are, you’re fine as long as I&#39;m here little bro.&quot; You told him and he nodded then he gave you a puzzled look and he asked,&quot;D..did you call me...brother?&quot;<br />
<br />
You smiled then nodded happily and you nudged him over onto his side then you began licking the wound in order to clean it. Droze winced and whimpered at the pain and you looked at him then said,&quot;Sorry, I should have said that it would hurt, but yeah. I’m your big brother now, I think. Either way it’s clean now, mostly so just...heh well....&quot; You began feeling really tired now for some reason, and you couldn’t resist it. Droze looked at you with concern and he asked,&quot;Big bro? You okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded in order to reassure him then you said,&quot;J...Just a bit sleepy, and uh....sorry....wake me if anything happens.&quot; Droze nodded and seconds later you blacked out onto the ground next to him unconscious.<br />
__________________<br />
<br />
<br />
You then woke up, and you were immediately alert, but you were in a black void of nothingness. You looked around and called into the darkness, but there came no response and your voice echoed. You looked down and saw that you were still a dragon, but you could actually feel the ground beneath you.<br />
<br />
Was this a dream? No, it couldn’t be, because why could you feel the ground. It was then something poked you in the back of your head and you felt frozen in place as you felt the air move backwards and the sound of something large sniff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Way!&quot; You yapped and you turned around to see two fully grown dragons staring at you. The one to the left was male with light blue scales on his back, and gray ones on his underside, and he reminded you of Droze with his eyes. The other one was female, you could tell immediately from her breasts and you blushed as you glanced at them. The female one had black scales covering her back, and dark blue ones covering her underside, and the patterns of color on her wing flaps, and horns were all like yours astonishingly enough.<br />
<br />
The eyes of the female were bright yellow and seemed to pierce the void while the black parts of her blended in with it. The male&#39;s scales all matched Droze’s scales and his eyes were even the same, red like his, almost like your were staring at Droze from the future.<br />
<br />
&quot;He certainly looks like ours, but can he be?&quot; The female asked and the male looked to her astonished and he replied,&quot;I think he is, the scent he carries matches us, and.....Droze. But how? We never conceived more than one egg.&quot;<br />
<br />
You perked up at the mention of Droze’s name and you said,&quot;Wait you know Droze?! Where are we now? Where is he at?&quot; The two dragons&#39; eyes widened at this and they looked to each other and the female now had a warm smile on her face, and her eyes began tearing up.<br />
<br />
The male just looked shocked at this then he nuzzled the female and he walked up to you and he towered over you, probably 10 times your size at first sight. He then leaned down and lied down on his side then the female came and lied next to him and dried her tears. The male dragon then spoke to you in a deep voice,&quot;We&#39;re Droze’s parents, and before you ask, we are deceased. I believe for you this is a dream.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where’s Droze at? Is he okay? Where’s my little boy at?&quot; The female asked and you paused and said,&quot;W...well he’s hurt, he was trying to survive on his own and he got into trouble with three other dragons. I erm...was human, and I jumped into the situation and I took Droze and ran. We escaped them, but his leg is wounded and he can barely walk. It’s okay though, the bleeding has stopped, and I cleaned the wound. But...well before I cleaned it my body started transforming, and well....he mentioned something about a story and a few things about it....and well....&quot; You paused looking from one dragon to the other then you continued,&quot;I...I don’t know how else to put this but.....I think we’re siblings now.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two parents then looked at each other and they both sniffed me again and paused looking at one another. The female then smiled and the male just stared at her and blinked. &quot;I told you that the story was true dear.&quot; The female said and the male blinked again and said,&quot;Well erm....I’m sorry then.&quot;<br />
<br />
The female then smiled down at me and she examined me closely and smiled. &quot;Oh you even look like you take after me! You have my tail spike! My underbelly scales, and my eyes!&quot;  She cooed and the male cleared his throat and he said,&quot;Sorry, but we must change topics. So, you’re out new son then, it’s uh...incredibly unbelievable but you certainly share our genes. You said Droze was wounded, how badly? Can you provide much more care?&quot;<br />
<br />
You paused then shook your head,&quot;It’s a good sized gash, claw probably because there were three dragons that weren’t as big as you, but probably the size of a horse? I’m not exactly sure, but it’s not very pretty, and he’s lucky that I found him when I did.&quot;<br />
<br />
The female one looked pretty distressed by this and she looked to me and asked,&quot;Did you escape?! Do you have any herbs? Are there any nearby?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down! This is no time to panic now!&quot; The male roared and he took a deep breath and said,&quot;Look, you’re an adolescent welp now, a late stage mature one, but a welp nonetheless. You’re a toddler in human eyes and Droze is an infant. You need to adapt, learn to hunt, learn to survive and care for Droze then teach him. Do you think you can hunt?&quot;<br />
<br />
You paused then nodded and said,&quot;I believe I can hunt, I have the instincts of a dragon now I&#39;m sure of it. I’m not sure how I can teach Droze with his leg though.&quot; The female then perked up and said,&quot;Lila!&quot;<br />
<br />
You turned towards the female then she looked down at you and said,&quot;Okay now listen, I have a sister on the north end of the island on the beach. She’s a healer, and your aunt by now, plus she was human like you were before she transformed.&quot;<br />
<br />
You paused then asked,&quot;Wait what?! Okay she was human too?&quot; The female paused then she said,&quot;Oh sorry, you can call me your mom now if you wish. Anyways my sister saved me at a young age too, but from another human. She transformed and since we were both young my parents decided to overlook the fact that she was human, and they were in debt to her too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your new dad paused then he looked at your mom and asked,&quot;What are you getting at honey?&quot; Your mom then smiled at him and turned back to you and said,&quot;Find Lila, she looks like me with my black scales, but she has a red underbelly and a a big claw birthmark on her chest. She was to take care of Droze, but he must have wandered off, so find her as soon as you can.&quot;<br />
<br />
You paused then nodded immediately and said,&quot;Understood, actually that sounds perfect all things considered. But uh... well I’m still worried about those other dragons, plus I am not so sure how to be a dragon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your dad then nodded and said,&quot;Understandable to an extent, how long ago did you transform?&quot; I paused then replied,&quot;About a minute or two before I passed out and woke up here I think, either way not any more than a few minutes at most.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your dad nodded and said,&quot;Well then, in that case I should teach you then. I do worry though about how you may find your aunt, and your safety.&quot; Your Mom then looked at your dad and asked,&quot;Why wouldn’t they find her?&quot; Your Dad then looked at your mom and said,&quot;She maybe distressed about all of this. She may think Droze is dead, and she may think that she is responsible. She may be still frantically searching around, and if she is then she could be anywhere. Either way I am obligated to teach you everything as your new father, and knowing that you&#39;ll teach Droze too, right?&quot; Your Dad shot you a stern look and you nodded then let out a whimper,&quot;Y...yes sir...&quot;<br />
<br />
Your dad nodded then a smirk appeared on his face and he said,&quot;Then you need to learn how to hunt first. It’s not too difficult, but you may find trouble since there’s no prey to practice on here. Just simply focus, follow your instincts and fall back into a stance to lunge. Then wait for your prey from a hidden area and thrust your body forward and aim for the neck, no fire unless you absolutely have to flee.&quot; You nodded to your dad then he looked to your mom and she smiled at you then said,&quot;We should give you a name too, maybe when we see each other next time we can do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
You paused then you asked,&quot;Wait again? How? Is there a limit?&quot; Your Dad gave you no response and he turned to your mom looking just as shocked as you were then your mom leaned closer and gently nuzzled you. <br />
<br />
&quot;That story states that you are basically like a median, but only for us. Droze was orphaned before you became this, so that’s how we’re talking even now. Just go to sleep and we&#39;ll be there for you.&quot; Your mom said and you blushed then licked her back smiling then said,&quot;Thanks er...Mom and Dad? That’s gonna to a weird thing that I have to adjust to.&quot;<br />
<br />
___________<br />
<br />
<br />
Without a moment&#39;s notice you suddenly were forced out of your dream and you woke up next to Droze in the ditch. Droze was drowsy and he yawned and you paused as the darkness around you accompanied by the moon and stars signifies that it was clearly night time.<br />
<br />
Droze saw you wake up and he tried to stand again, but you stopped him and firmly told him,&quot;No Droze, not now.&quot; You looked down at the leg and saw that it looked more or less the same, but if it was exposed like this then nothing good would come of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;B..big bro, you’re awake.&quot; Droze said groggily and he let out a yawn and he lied his head down on the ground. You looked at Droze and said,&quot;Yeah, get some sleep now. Don’t worry, I have a plan to get through this. You really would find it hard to understand now but...&quot; You then heard the sounds of snoring and you saw Droze asleep. You then sighed and smiled then you looked around and found some loose sticks and leaves that you used to cover up Droze to hide him. You weren’t sure if he was hidden, but at least he could be warm.<br />
<br />
You then looked out into the night and wondered what you should do next.</p>
