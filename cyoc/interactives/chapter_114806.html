<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before I begin, I&#39;d like to give a huge shout out to Dragonman.  He&#39;s a great author, and has made many different chapters on this site, including some from my own works.  His alternative to this chapter option is very good, and I&#39;d highly suggest checking it out as well.  Also, some of the ideas for this chapter are from his version of this option.  I would like to give him credit for that.  Anyway, on with the chapter!<br />
<br />
&quot;Grrrrr.&quot;  You heard and felt in your stomach.  &quot;Master?  Will we be eating any time soon?&quot;  You asked, pawing at Rowan&#39;s leg with one of your claws.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your dinner will be part of your lesson.&quot;  Rowan answered sternly.  &quot;And please don&#39;t claw me like that.  Dragon&#39;s claws are much more deadly than any sword.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Master.&quot;  You apologized, lowering your claw.  &quot;It&#39;s what my pets did when I was back home to get my attention.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand Gannoth.  But you didn&#39;t have a dragon as a pet.&quot;  Rowan started, losing some of the sternness from his tone.  &quot;You still do not understand exactly what you are yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean Master?&quot;  You asked curiously, not realizing that there was more to this &#39;familiar&#39; business.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where to start.&quot;  Rowan muttered, stopping in his tracks.  &quot;As I said before, a familiar is a mage&#39;s companion.  Sometimes, they can use magic, sometimes they cannot.  In some cases, like that of your own, their soul is bound to their master, so if they die, so do their familiar.  Our case is a bit different though.  As I am immortal, so are you.  However, as I mentioned, defy my, and the eternity you will be alive will be non-stop torture.  Are we clear on that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master.&quot;  You answered feebly, bowing your head slightly down, as if being punished.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, when it comes to dragons, you&#39;re very different.  There are many species of dragon.  You are a special one.  The most feared one.  The Royal Irontail.  They are known to be ferocious, clever, intelligent, and dangerous.  Very few people come back alive from a Royal Irontail encounter, and those who do are scarred for life.  They generally grow to be about 50 feet long, and are easily the strongest species.  They are physically impressive, but magically absurd.  There have been tales of Royal Irontails using magic to obliterate mountains.  However, they are exceedingly rare.  There have only been five credible sightings of Royal Irontails.  The only thing most people know about them is what they look like.  Now, going back to you, Gannoth.&quot;  This made you perk your head up slightly.  &quot;You will only grow to, at most, ten feet long.  You&#39;re an adolescent dragon, so you may still grow a bit.  But, your capabilities may outshine even the strongest dragon.  I made sure of this.  Despite your size, you&#39;re physically as strong as a full grown dragon, and your magical capabilities will be second only to myself.&quot;  You started to get excited.  &quot;You are already quite intelligent, but there is much for you to learn, the first of which is using your magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Master.&quot;  You smiled, getting excited at the prospect of your power.  &quot;When do we start?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I like your enthusiasm Gannoth.&quot;  Rowan chuckled.  This brief smile turned quickly to a frown.<br />
<br />
&quot;Master?  Is something wrong?&quot;  You asked concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just like you, I am quite hungry.&quot;  Rowan chuckled.  &quot;My stomach feels like its in a knot.  Rather than my original plan, we will eat, then train.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Master!&quot;  You smiled.  &quot;What was your original idea?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You go out and hunt for your dinner with only your magic.  But we&#39;ll save that for another day.&quot;  Rowan responded.  &quot;Follow me.&quot;  Rowan turned around and started walking in the opposite direction.  You quickly followed behind, anticipating dinner.  Along the way, you continued asking questions about your new draconic body.  Rowan answered each question thoroughly and thoughtfully.  Some were simple, like &quot;How tough are my scales?&quot;, and &quot;What is the average lifespan of a dragon?&quot;, and some were not, including &quot;Would I be able to get along with other dragons?&quot;.  To that question, Rowan gave an interesting answer.  In summary, &quot;Dragons work in a wolf-pack type of society.  The strongest lead, and everyone else follows, until a stronger dragon appears.  If you are able to prove yourself Gannoth, all of dragon-kind will bow to us.&quot;  This got you motivated to strengthen your capabilities.  (The answers to the other questions are, your scales really can only be punctured by magically infused weapons, like magic swords or other dragons, and 5,000 years.)<br />
<br />
You eventually made it to a large kitchen, where you saw the first sign of other life in the castle.  Yet, there was something different about them.  They were suits of armor, moving around, cooking.  But, while definitely animated and moving like humans, there was something off about them.  &quot;Before you ask Gannoth, these suits of armor have been enchanted by me to act as servants to me.  They will respond to you too.  After all, part of my soul is inside of you, just like how part of you is within me.&quot;  Rowan explained.  &quot;The only living beings in this castle, that I am aware of, are the two of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Master.  I was going to ask what was going on with those suits.&quot;  You smiled, satisfied with the explanation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Servants, we need one meal for myself and one for a dragon!&quot;  Rowan commanded.  Instantly, the suits of armor stopped what they were doing, and started making dinner.  &quot;They may not look like it, but these suits are all great chefs.&quot;  Rowan smiled.  &quot;Follow me Gannoth.&quot;  Rowan walked over to a large dining room, with a giant table in the center.  Above it was a large chandelier.  With only a soft snap, every candle on the chandelier was lit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Magic is truly amazing.&quot;  You said in awe, looking at the chandelier.  &quot;I&#39;m going to miss Internet though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about Gannoth?&quot;  Rowan chuckled, taking his place at the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not me, it&#39;s Kevin talking again.&quot;  You replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Kevin&#39;s memories will not last forever.  Soon, it will be like he never existed.&quot;  Rowan explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;What will happen in my old world?  With Kevin gone, will his, or my parents get into a frenzy?  What about my friends?  My family?&quot;  You asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nobody knows for sure.  It&#39;s not common for the soul summoned to be human.&quot;  Rowan started explaining.  &quot;When a mage summons a familiar, they usually try for an animal for a companion.  I wanted something a bit different.  I wanted one with more sentience and intelligence than a squirrel.  That&#39;s why I summoned you, and decided on a dragon.  Dragons are intelligent, wise, strong, and great companions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Master.&quot;  You smiled, taking what he was saying as a compliment.  &quot;Err...  Where should I sit?&quot;  You asked, noticing that you didn&#39;t really fit at the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come next to me Gannoth.&quot;  Rowan smiled, motioning you to his side.  As you walked over, you noticed a large water trough and an empty trough.  &quot;We&#39;ll put your food here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This feels somewhat humiliating.&quot;  You muttered to yourself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, until I find a way to accommodate a dragon at a dinner table, it will have to do.&quot;  Rowan responded, understanding where your sentiment is coming from.  &quot;Besides, you&#39;ll be hunting for a lot of your food in the future.  This won&#39;t be used much.  Hunting will allow you to exercise and train your abilities.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand Master.&quot;  You said, waiting for your dinner.  Eventually, it came.  It was a huge amount of meat.  You weren&#39;t even sure what it was.  It just looked delicious.  One of the knights plopped the meat into the empty trough, and you started eating away.  It was heavenly.  When you took a drink of the water, it was cool and refreshing.  &quot;This is wonderful!&quot;  You smiled, taking very little time between bites.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re enjoying your meal.&quot;  Rowan smiled, holding a large piece of chicken in his hand.  &quot;Once we&#39;re done, we&#39;ll be heading outside for some, practical training.&quot;  Rowan continued, chuckling to himself.  You thought nothing of it as you continued eating your dinner.<br />
<br />
One hour later:<br />
<br />
&quot;Gannoth.  Welcome to the Forest of Porentia.&quot;  Rowan stated, waving his hand towards a dark, eerie looking forest.  &quot;This is where I do most of my magical training.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why here?&quot;  You asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll see.&quot;  Rowan said, smiling an evil grin.  You were not sure whether you should be excited or scared, but you trusted your master and his judgement.  &quot;Follow me.&quot;  Rowan smiled as he walked into the dark forest, you following closely behind.  You noticed that, despite the darkness, you could see quite clearly.  Rowan seemed to be able to.  You chalked this up to your draconic biology and his dark magic, and continued following.  Pretty soon, you walked into a large clearing.  &quot;Can&#39;t you smell the crisp, clean air?&quot;  You took a whiff of the air, and noticed how pure it felt.  It was a pleasing feeling.  &quot;This forest has been tainted with dark magic for years.  It is the perfect place to learn it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that why you like to train here?&quot;  You asked, wondering what brought that smile to your master&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
&quot;One of the reasons.&quot;  Rowan&#39;s evil grin continued to show on his handsome, young face.  &quot;Gannoth, my first task for you is quite simple.  I want you to fly up, over the forest, and take a look around.  You will understand why as soon as you get up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master.&quot;  You flew upwards, loving the feeling of the cool, crisp nighttime air rushing along your scales.  As soon as you reached the desired height, you stopped in the air, almost hovering.  As you looked around, you understood just what your master meant.  All around the forest, both in and out, were small villages.  Some were completely destroyed, some were being rebuilt, and some were completely untouched.  Once you got the full view, you descended, landing right where you took off from.  &quot;Master, all of those villages.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.  That&#39;s why I come here.  Destroying these small villages.  Watching them rebuild themselves.  It&#39;s a rush.&quot;  Rowan explained.  &quot;If I&#39;ll be destroying kingdoms, the first steps are the villages.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you want me to destroy one of them?&quot;  You asked, shaking nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;As I said.  You&#39;ll have to get used to witnessing and partaking in death.&quot;  Rowan started.  &quot;Destruction and death are my two specialties.  It&#39;s what I was born to do.  Any you were born to assist me.  Be my companion for eternity.  If this disturbs you, then what kind of familiar are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A bad one?&quot;  You answered nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;A defiant one.&quot;  Rowan corrected sternly.  &quot;And as I mentioned, defiance brings with it punishment.  Gannoth, this is what you were born to do.  You must accept your fate before you can truly live and understand life.  Accept your fate Gannoth!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master!&quot;  You shouted, making sure Rowan understood that you would be by his side, no matter what.  &quot;Now, what do I need to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the spirit.&quot;  Rowan&#39;s grin returned.  &quot;You feel energy coursing through your whole body, don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;  You answered, paying attention to your master&#39;s every word.<br />
<br />
&quot;This energy is magical energy.  You must tap into it, and unleash it.&quot;  Rowan started.  &quot;Try focusing on it, making it go somewhere where you think you&#39;ll be able to control it.  Nod when you&#39;re ready for the next part.&quot;  You tried focusing on the energy, and noticed that it seemed to follow your thoughts.  You tried directing it to one of your claws, and noticed it well up there.  You nodded, signaling completion of the first part.  &quot;Now, imagine that energy forming around that part of your body.  Form it into whatever you want.&quot;  You imagined the magical energy surrounding your claw, and noticed that your claw gained a strange, black aura.  &quot;Good Gannoth.  Now, unleash it!&quot;  You took your claw and tried to swipe at a tree close by you.  You noticed that your claw went straight through, causing the tree to catch fire.  &quot;Good.&quot;  Rowan smiled and snapped his finger.  Immediately, the fire stopped.  &quot;Something tells me that this &#39;melee&#39; magic will not be very practical to you...&quot;  Rowan stated, looking at your quadrupedal stance.  &quot;Try this instead.  Focus that energy in front of you.  Not in you, but in front.&quot;  You tried this, imagining the energy inside of you leaving and forming a ball in front of you.  As you did this, you noticed a small fireball form in front of your eyes.  You continued focusing this energy, trying to make the ball bigger and bigger.  Soon, it was a full two feet across.  &quot;Now Gannoth, focus on trying to make it do things.  Make it move, shrink it, grow it.  Just don&#39;t make it disappear.&quot;  Rowan commanded.  You focused on trying to make the ball raise in the air, moving it, and changing its size and shape.  Once you got the hang of it, Rowan told you to throw it in the air and make it explode.  You did exactly that, watching the orange orb fly up and burst.  &quot;Now Gannoth, if you focus on trying to make fire, it will be fire.  If you try focusing on more evil thoughts, it will become the dark magic I am so acquainted with, and want you to be as well.  Try that.&quot;  You tried focusing on murdering innocent people, and noticed that a ball of blackness formed in front of you.  Rowan smiled an evil grin as you fired the ball into the forest.  Soon, you saw a huge explosion, and watched as birds flew away from the scene.  &quot;Dark magic is far more powerful than any other magic.  That is why it is forbidden.  This is the magic used to destroy kingdoms.&quot;  Rowan stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;And now I can use it?&quot;  You asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Gannoth, and you will.&quot;  Rowan smiled evilly as his hand glowed a light shade of blue.  Soon, you felt something on your back.  You turned to look, and noticed a saddle.  &quot;If I will be riding you, it should be comfortable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand Master.  Just please tell me when you&#39;re going to do something like that.  It scared me a bit.&quot;  You said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Gannoth.  Now, let&#39;s see the damage done.&quot;  Rowan smiled, getting onto your back.  You flew up, and noticed a new clearing, with some smoke coming out.  You approached it and noticed that it was more like a small crater than a clearing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did that?&quot;  You asked, looking at the crater.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Gannoth, and you will do so much more.&quot;  Rowan smiled, excited from the idea of more power.  &quot;Now, your exam.  See the village over there?&quot;  Rowan pointed straight ahead.  In the distance in that direction, you noticed some small fires and buildings.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master.&quot;  You replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Destroy it.&quot;  Rowan stated simply and sternly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master.&quot;  You flew over to the village, where only 100 people lived.  &quot;It&#39;s quite small.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, you need to start small.&quot;  Rowan stated.  You devised a strategy, for lack of a better term, as you flew closer in.  You heard a couple of screams, and that was it.  You opened your mouth as you focused your evil energy to there.  Soon, you felt the energy overflowing in there.  Focus and unleash.  You unleashed it, using the dark energy as a breath weapon, obliterating the village, making another crater in the forest.  &quot;Very good Gannoth.  There were no surviving people, buildings or animals.  Complete annihilation.  Soon, you will learn the true extent of this power.  But for now, very good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Master.&quot;  You smiled, realizing that this destruction felt satisfying and fulfilling.  Maybe being evil wasn&#39;t so bad.  You flew back to the castle, where you walked to the bedroom.  &quot;Good night Master.&quot;  You said as you curled up in your bed and fell asleep.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good night Gannoth.&quot;  Rowan said, getting into his bed.<br />
<br />
