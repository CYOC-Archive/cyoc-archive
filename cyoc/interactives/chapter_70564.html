<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When the morning came, Alex found David watching TV with a protein shake, who smiled enthusiastically as he <br />
saw his friend. Alex was still shocked at the size of him. David was just wearing sweat pants so he could show <br />
off his huge torso, his spherical pecs weighing heavily from his big chest into his ridged stomach. His <br />
enormous shoulders looked as though there were bowling balls shoved under the skin, and they led down to the <br />
biggest biceps Alex had ever seen. ‘Do I want to be that big?’ Alex wondered, honestly unsure of the answer.<br />
<br />
“Hi Alex. I’m going to the gym soon, do you want to come?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know man, still struggling to get my head around all this...”<br />
<br />
“Come on man, it’ll take your mind off it! Plus, if you don’t work out this month maybe you’ll get fat <br />
instead...”<br />
<br />
Alex hesitated. He wasn’t sure if he wanted to be a muscle freak like David, but he didn’t want to be fat. <br />
Couldn’t he just stay as he was? But given the options...<br />
<br />
“Okay, I’ll come too.”<br />
<br />
David smiled, “Great, pack yourself a gym bag, we’ll leave when you’ve eaten.”<br />
<br />
So a little later the boys left for David’s 24 hour gym. Alex was still feeling a bit apprehensive when they <br />
got there, but once he hopped on the treadmill and started jogging he was able to just focus on his workout. <br />
After fifteen minutes he started doing some weight training. He began with some bicep curls, barely realising <br />
it but choosing a really high weight so he’d be going for growth and not strength. Still, he decided to go for <br />
it anyway and did 8 reps, grunting and breaking into a sweat with the effort.<br />
<br />
So Alex circulated through the machines for a while, always going for a high level of resistance without <br />
giving it much thought. After an hour in the gym, he realised he wasn’t feeling as tired as usual: he still <br />
felt energised and wanted to keep working out.<br />
<br />
“Hey David,” he called, “How long do you usually work out for?”<br />
<br />
“About three hours, why?”<br />
<br />
“Nothing,” Alex replied. ‘Shit,’ he thought with a drop in his stomach. It must be starting already if he <br />
still felt this energetic.<br />
<br />
But Alex kept working out, his muscles glistening with sweat from his hard work. Alex suddenly felt an urge to <br />
throw some poses in the mirror, so he went over and pulled a double-bi, then a most-muscular, and any others <br />
he could think of. ‘Damn, I look good!’ he thought.<br />
<br />
David came over, also covered in sweat from his strenuous workout, and said “It’s been like three hours man, <br />
you ready to bounce?”<br />
<br />
“Sure,” Alex said, and he picked up his bag and was about to leave, when he heard David call, “Hey man, can’t <br />
leave yet, gotta shower first!”<br />
<br />
He threw Alex a towel and walked off into the shower room. Alex followed cautiously, and by the time he’d got <br />
there David had already stripped, freeing his huge hard cock and letting the hot water soak his muscles. Alex <br />
felt self-conscious, particularly since David was hard. David must have sensed his hesitation and said,<br />
<br />
“Come on in man, gotta clean that sweat off,”<br />
<br />
Alex reluctantly stripped and walked into the communal showers. Turning on the tap and lathering up his own <br />
muscles, he was reminded of how much smaller he was than David. Not that Alex was small – at around one-ninety <br />
Alex could easily hold his own – but David was a muscle monster. And he was kinda turned on to think of David <br />
that way, he realised as his dick started to grow. Alex quickly filled his mind with something else to make <br />
his erection go away. He scrabbled around in his mind for something to make the erection go away, flicking <br />
through a number of different images before hitting on Lana. And as soon as she was in his mind, his dick <br />
instantly got softer. ‘Shit,’ Alex thought as his heart sank. He knew he’d turn gay pretty quickly but he <br />
hadn’t expected it to be two days after he’d sucked on David! He just focussed on getting clean and then dry, <br />
avoiding David’s gaze, only looking back when he was sure he must be dressed and ready to leave.<br />
<br />
The car-ride home was spent mostly in silence, until they were a few blocks away, and David said, “I noticed <br />
you getting hard in the shower.”<br />
<br />
Alex went red, “Don’t do this David.”<br />
<br />
“Come on, we need to talk about it. This is going to happen more often to you, even if you don’t want it, so <br />
you need to get used to it early.”<br />
<br />
When Alex didn’t respond, David carried on, “Look, it won’t happen too much at first, but more and more as <br />
time goes on. And it’s nothing to be ashamed of – this is what you like now and you may as well embrace that. <br />
I know it’s hard, but you’ve got to be open to it.”<br />
<br />
Alex still didn’t reply, so David gave up. When they got back to the flat, Alex went straight into his room <br />
and stared at himself in the mirror. He didn’t really know why, but he carried on flexing, bouncing his pecs, <br />
staring at his glutes and back...and he got hard again. He hesitated for a moment after noticing this, but <br />
then slowly took his rod out of his pants, and stroked it over his own muscles. Just a few minutes later he <br />
came, shooting hot cum all over his glistening body, and while he was cleaning up he smiled at himself in the <br />
mirror. ‘I’ll be OK,’ he thought, not really sure if he should believe himself or not.<br />
<br />
******************************<br />
<br />
Over the next few days Alex really tried to forget about his changes and just spend some time with his friend. <br />
Alex had thought to book a month’s holiday from work while he changed – he had no idea what he’d tell them <br />
when it was done but he could work that out later. He and David went to the gym and worked out solidly for <br />
hours each day, bonding over their shared love of fitness. Alex had always loved working out and had never <br />
thought David would be into working out as much as he was now, but he was kinda glad he had someone to share <br />
it with.<br />
<br />
And he had to admit...David was looking pretty good. Alex was reluctant about thinking this but David had <br />
grown into a really attractive young man: muscular, tanned, this stylish tousled hair, and a goofy grin which <br />
revealed how dumb he was now. And Alex had started to get boned any time he saw David less than fully clothed, <br />
which was getting quite awkward at the gym where David would routinely go commando and get a hard-on while <br />
lifting.<br />
<br />
Tony had insisted the two of them keep track of their changes, including David. Alex wondered if Tony expected <br />
David to keep getting bigger at the same rate, because David was working out just as hard as before, if not <br />
more. He was trying to get even bigger, probably past 300lbs. The first Friday after David changed Alex, they <br />
both hopped on the scales. David went first, and was disappointed he’d only put on 5lbs since last week. This <br />
was still a high rate of muscle growth, but compared to David’s peak of 25lbs a day, it was crushingly slow. <br />
He was visibly dejected as he stepped off the scales and motioned for Alex to go.<br />
<br />
Alex took a deep breath. He was really nervous about how much he’d grown. Being around David made him lose all <br />
reference points – as David was so big and they only saw other big guys at the gym, Alex started to think of <br />
his body as normal size, so at times he wanted to be bigger, until he remembered David was actually huge and <br />
he was already pretty big. He was confused, and that in itself scared him.<br />
<br />
Alex stepped onto the scales in his underwear. It felt like forever until the needle settled but settle it did <br />
– on 220lbs.<br />
<br />
“Are you fucking kidding me? Thirty pounds in a week...” Alex said.<br />
<br />
David instantly grew a bulge in his underwear, “Fuck bro, you look so hot.”<br />
<br />
Alex smiled as his cock swelled a little at the compliment. He hadn’t realised but as he looked at himself in <br />
the mirror he saw how he’d changed. His pecs did swell out more than before, his arms more defined and <br />
vascular, and his ass was a firm, round bubble.<br />
<br />
David saw the bulge appearing in his friend’s underwear and picked up a ruler, saying with a smirk and a wink, <br />
“Gotta measure everywhere bro.”<br />
<br />
Alex had always been proud of his body but he now felt something different. He felt like it was wrong to be <br />
covered up at all: like he should be showing off all the time. So he pulled down his boxers and held out his <br />
dick, ready for David to measure it. David smiled and held the ruler against Alex, taking a moment to figure <br />
out the right number.<br />
<br />
“How big were you before?” he asked while getting the measurement right.<br />
<br />
“Five inches naturally, but I was six the day after I sucked you off.”<br />
<br />
“Shit man...you’re nine now!”<br />
<br />
“The fuck?! Are you sure?” Alex looked down and sure enough, the tip of his hard dick was just touching the <br />
nine inch mark. He felt a little weak at the knees – while he’d wanted to be a bit bigger, nine inches now <br />
made his cock much bigger than average.<br />
<br />
“How fast did yours grow?” Alex asked.<br />
<br />
David thought for a moment, then answered, “Well I started off at seven, then by the end of my first week I <br />
was on nine and a half...so nearly as much as yours. It does slow down though dude.”<br />
<br />
Alex sincerely hoped so. Nine inches was really big, and he didn’t want to be as big as David’s foot-long – or <br />
worse, even bigger. But he had to admit, as he saw his bigger body in the mirror, he was looking fucking good. <br />
His pecs were bigger and hung a bit lower over his abs, which were more pronounced and a bit more symmetrical <br />
than normal. His arms were looking much more powerful and his shoulders broader to handle them. He rubbed a <br />
big hand across his chest and grinned. David saw this and said, “If you like this, you’ll love what’s coming <br />
next.”</p>
