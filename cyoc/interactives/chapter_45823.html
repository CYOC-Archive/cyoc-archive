<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Still holding on tight to him, Brian stood on tip-toe and tilted his head up -- John was several inches taller than him now. He lowered his head to meet Brian's and they nuzzled for a few moments before starting to kiss. John's tusks made it a little tricky -- they couldn't lock lips in the usual way and wound up experimenting passionately for a couple of minutes, tongues sliding back and forth. When they parted to catch their breath they were both dripping with saliva and both grinning like idiots. John took one of his large hands from the small of Brian's back, wiped his chin on the back of it, then settled it down on Brian's hip, stroking the denim gently.<br />
<br />
&quot;I notice my potential boyfriend still has his pants on,&quot; he said. He could feel the vibrations from his deep voice running through Brian. &quot;That doesn't seem fair.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian spread his arms. &quot;What can I say? Maybe I feel insecure all of a sudden.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? Do you need a little... reassurance?&quot; John asked, sliding his hand around to Brian's butt and squeezing slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm. You're welcome to try, for sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
John knelt down, trailing his other hand along Brian's chest as he went, until he was down on one knee and his face was at the level of Brian's crotch. He adjusted his position a bit to get comfortable -- his balls rested on the ground and his long penis, still erect, hung between Brian's calves -- then snagged the zipper of Brian's fly with one claw and carefully pulled it down. The warm male smells seeped out and he took a couple of deep sniffs with his snout-like nose. He exhaled slowly, letting his warm breath breeze in through the open fly, then spoke into it in a stage whisper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello in there. Brian tells me you are a little shy, but I would very much like it if you came out to play.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not helping!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hush you,&quot; John called up, then turned back to the open fly. &quot;Don't pay any attention to him. Just nod your head if that's OK.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, John leaned forward and placed his open mouth over the large bulge just to one side of the zipper. He breathed out warm air again and gently massaged the bulge with his lips. It twitched.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, that's not -- uh! -- not fair.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All's fair in love and war. But first, we've got to liberate a couple other friends of yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
He reached down and quickly untied the laces on both of Brian's sneakers, then took a loose grip of one shoe. Brian caught on and lifted it up, and they wrangled it off. John tossed it aside, then rolled the sock down rather more slowly and sensuously. He repeated the show with Brian's other foot, then knelt down all the way to kiss the top of each one before returning to his earlier position.<br />
<br />
&quot;Apologies for the delay,&quot; he whispered, then took hold of Brian's pants at the waist, undid the button, and lowered them gradually, revealing the boxer shorts underneath. There was an awkward moment when, half-way down, the crotch of the pants got snagged on his own penis and he had to shuffle backwards and tilt it out of the way, but he soon had the pants down at Brian's ankles. Brian stepped out of them gracefully and nudged them out of the way with a toe.<br />
<br />
Brian's boxer shorts were thin and had a simple, checked pattern. There was a large damp spot on one side, on top of the bulge where the penis pressed against the fabric. John ran a fingertip across it, feeling the stickiness. The uneven pressure was holding the fly open. He placed is mouth over the gap, covering it, then reached around to put his hands on Brian's buttocks and began to squeeze and rub them with a circular motion, making sure to keep his claws out of the way. With a little care -- and, he suspected, a little assistance from Brian -- he was able to twitch the cock towards the hole. After couple of deliberate squeezes it popped free of the material and into his mouth, gliding in-between the smooth curves of his tusks. Brian immediately pushed forward as though he'd been released as well, his dick sliding along John's tongue. John let him go all the way until his lips were at the base of Brian's cock and his upturned nose was pressed against his pubes, then gradually eased backwards until his lips slipped back over the head of Brian's cock and they separated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Feeling a little less inhibited now, huh--om.&quot; He was abruptly cut off when Brian's manhood poked between his lips again. He licked it, then started running his tongue around the rim of the mushroom head. His tongue seemed to be stronger and more flexible than he was used to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Better than any therapy,&quot; muttered Brian, but that was it for the repartee; neither of them had any attention for it after John began bobbing his head back and forth, at first just over the head of Brian's cock but then deeper and deeper. He pushed Brian's butt forwards in time with his movements, and before long Brian was thrusting his hips himself. He found Brian's hands running through his hair, ruffling it, and playing with his pointed ears. As Brian's thrusts grew more insistent his grip changed, palms flat against John's head and fingertips pressed against his scalp to get more traction. This would be the finale then, thought John. He relaxed himself as Brian tensed up, pushing forward one final time and then holding as he came, shooting into the back of his mouth. He waited for him to wind down, swallowed, and then edged his tongue further forward so that he could run it all the way along the underside of Brian's cock as he pulled back, licking the tip at the very end.<br />
<br />
Brian just stood there, looking dazed, as his cock softened. John's, on the other hand, was very much erect. He'd been aroused now for -- God, how long ago had dinner been? It seemed an age. Giving Brian head had made him even hornier than before. He could actually feel his nuts throbbing, building up the pressure. How often did orcs usually have sex, anyway? He'd already orgasmed twice earlier this evening, but apparently that didn't count for much.<br />
<br />
Something brushed his dick -- his very sensitive dick -- and he shuddered. Looking down, he saw that it had been Brian's penis which was now hanging down between his legs, resting against the front of his boxers. His own dick ran almost vertically up to the top of Brian's thighs next to it. They brushed again, smearing one another a little. This time it seemed to snap Brian out of his reverie.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was amazing,&quot; he said, resting his hands on John's shoulders. &quot;I don't know how you--uh, oh wow.&quot;<br />
<br />
They both stared at John's cock. It twitched, pressing against Brian's. It simply dwarfed it. Brian looked shocked for a moment, then broke into a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look a bit preoccupied there,&quot; he said. &quot;Let me see if I can help you now.&quot;<br />
<br />
John held still, not quite sure what to expect, as Brian hooked his thumbs into the waistband of his boxers and pushed them down. The underwear hung on the head of John's penis looking like some kind of absurd headscarf, then Brian stepped back and the boxers slipped free and slid down to his ankles. Brian was completely naked now, and the head of John's cock rubbed against his inner thigh, matting the hairs with streaks of precum. Planting his feet wide apart on the ground and gripping John's shoulders tightly, Brian edged forwards and down, forwards and down. John's cock traced up Brian's thigh, behind the back of his balls, then along his taint.<br />
<br />
As Brian lowered himself a little further and John felt the head of his cock start to press against the cleft of Brian's ass, John finally realized what he was trying to do. He had to give him full credit for willingness and determination, but just wasn't going to work.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry hun,&quot; he said, putting a hand on Brian's hip. &quot;I really appreciate it, but I'm just not going to fit. Even if we did get it inside, it'd tear you up. See, there really is such a thing as too big.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian looked utterly crestfallen. &quot;I'm sorry. I didn't think -- I should have realized...&quot;<br />
<br />
John carefully pulled back his penis and then stood up, pulling Brian up with him. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's okay, you didn't do anything wrong. Just the opposite,&quot; he said, pulling him into a hug and then kissing him on the forehead, then between the eyes, then on the cheek, and finally, for rather longer, <br />
on the lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; he continued a little later, &quot;if you do still want to help me, I wouldn't say no.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything,&quot; replied Brian and squeezed him. &quot;Er, but what exactly should I do?&quot;<br />
<br />
John's cock throbbed against Brian's chest and leaked another spot of precum. &quot;At this point,&quot; he said, &quot;more or less anything short of a cheese-grater will work.&quot;</p>
