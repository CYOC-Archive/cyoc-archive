<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You grabbed the keys from your pants pocket and sat down on the couch.  &lt;&lt;What would be a good test?&gt;&gt;  You looked at your tv, a 24” hand me down from your parents.  Law school wasn’t cheap but you probably could have splurged a bit for a slightly larger tv.  You focused on it intently and pressed the unlock button, the TV flew apart, the pieces expanded and it flew back together like nothing happened except now it was 30”.  &lt;&lt;Ok...  Now.... back to the 24”&gt;&gt;.  You focused again, it’s a shame of course because a bigger tv was pretty great.  You pressed the unlock button, the tv flew apart and then flew back together again but it was still 30”.  &lt;&lt;Damn.  Ok... how about bigger again?&gt;&gt;  You pressed the unlock button, the TV expanded to 40”.  &lt;&lt;Huh.....  maybe color?  Bright pink.&gt;&gt;  Press... it stayed the same &lt;&lt;nope... Glass Bevel?&gt;&gt; Press...the TV reassembled itself this time with glass bevel instead of plastic &lt;&lt;Now that looks nice.  Maybe it only improves things?&gt;&gt;  You press again without thinking of any specific property.  The TV expands again, this time consuming the nearby stereo as well which gets integrated into a 60” tv with surround sound system.  &lt;&lt;Fuck-ing-sweet.  Ok, Old 24” TV?&gt;&gt; Press... it stayed the same &lt;&lt;Nope. Hmm.... Ok.... So it improves things and won’t un-improve them... but how does it define an improvement?&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
You looked at the coffee table, there were some magazines, a plate from last night, a scuff mark from when you were a kid.  You focused on the plate and pressed the button... The plate was now clean but still sitting on the table.  &lt;&lt;Wonder if can change properties but not physical location?&gt;&gt; You imagined the plate back in the cupboard and pressed the button, but the plate remained where it was.  &lt;&lt;Huh... ok, next&gt;  You focus on the magazine, and pressed... The magazine flew apart in a flurry of paper and reassembled itself into a hopefully non-paper tablet.  &lt;&lt;Nice!  How about the table itself?&gt;&gt;  It wasn’t worth much retail value but it had sentimental value, like that old chip from when you tripped over your brother’s sports equipment as a kid and fell face first onto the table.  What would it do with that?... You pressed the unlock button.  The table shimmered as if coming apart and reassembling at the cellular level.  The wood looked bright and vivid like it used to, and it shined like it was freshly cleaned, but the chip mark remained.  You pressed it again just to make sure, and yup the mark stayed the same.  <br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;Maybe... maybe the keys aren’t improving things according to retail value, but rather according to my own intrinsic values?&gt;&gt; “Hey Keith!  Bring me one of your beers from the fridge”<br />
Keith stopped cleaning, grabbed a beer from the fridge and headed towards you “Thought you didn’t like my beer?”<br />
“I don’t, but this is an experiment”<br />
Keith put the beer down on the coffee table, “Ok dude... Oh sweet TV.   Don’t suppose you can conjure up a console.  That game that just came out would look super sweet on a screen that big”.<br />
“Eh, Maybe later” You focused on the beer.  Now you didn’t particularly like Keith’s brand of beer, but beer is beer, and more beer is better... right?  You tried to convince yourself of that fact while focusing on Keith’s beer and how you wanted it to be a two four of Keith’s beer instead.  You pressed the button and in response Keith’s beer split and multiplied and a box appeared around it out of nowhere. “YES!”<br />
“Sweet” Keith picked up the box, took out one of the beers and gestured it towards you.  “You still need it?  Ohh they’re cold too”<br />
“Yeah”, you grabbed the beer from him and put it back on the table, “You can put the rest away though”.  Keith brought the box back to the kitchen and resumed cleaning.  You focused on the new beer in front of you, this time thinking about how awesome it would be to have a single beer, but your favourite brand of beer instead.  You pressed the button, and this time the label shimmered and changed to your brand.  You opened it up and give it a taste test.   &lt;&lt;Ahh.. just right.  Better than normal even.&gt;&gt; “I think I’m starting to get the hang of this” you call out to Keith.<br />
“Glad to hear it” <br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;Lets try something larger.&gt;&gt;  You got up and focused on the couch.  &lt;&lt;I want.... a black leather couch with built in recliners, heated seats, and massage function.&gt;&gt;  You pressed the button, and your old lumpy couch rebuilt itself to your exact specifications.  &lt;&lt;Oh this is so awesome!!  It’s like I’ve won the lottery of lotteries!  Ok.... What next?&gt;&gt;  You spied your one lonely potted plant hiding out in the corner being all droopy.  It was so hard to keep that dang thing alive, but artificial plants looked so tacky.  &lt;&lt;Healthy plant, healthy Plant, healthy plant.&gt;&gt;  You pressed the button, and the plant started to shimmer and change.  The leaves perked up and twisted about , the veins became shiny and started to glow, then the leaves became translucent and changed to blue color before the leaves calmed down again, making the plant look like a beautiful living crystal sculpture.  Amazingly beautiful but not terribly plant like.  You got closer to inspect it.  The whole plant changed color and started to dance, light swirled through the veins it as your face came near it.  &lt;&lt;Cool&gt;&gt; You pulled back and waved your hand over it.  The swirling lights and dancing leaves mimicked the movement of your hands.  Very cool and you didn’t have to water it anymore.... at least... you don’t think you have to.  Hopefully not.  Still the goal was a plant.  “healthy biological plant, healthy biological plant, healthy biological plant...” You said it aloud that time, hoping the increased focus would change the outcome. You pressed the button but the plant remained as it was.  It would seem that even when you had different intentions you couldn’t use the keys to make a change you didn’t think was as an improvement.<br />
<br />
About that time keith came and bent over to grab the plate off the coffee table.  Damn his ass was so nice and he was all yours, a blank slate to explore your wildest fantasies with after all these years you’ve wanted him.... “Fuck.” it was an improvement.<br />
“What that a statement or a command?” Keith turned back to you with a curious look.<br />
“I.... there’s a pattern...with the keys” How could you tell him?  No matter how much you wanted to, you couldn’t change him back, possibly not ever.  And the reason why was because as far as you were concerned, the way Keith was now was an improvement over the way he was.  You liked what’s happened to Keith... you were excited even.  Already in the back of your mind you were planning how to change him even more, and you had already used him first for sex and then to clean your apartment.  He apparently liked getting ordered which is a bonus, but before he’d have just told you to fuck off if you’d ask him to do your chores.  Probably anyway.  The android persona had implied Keith already had that desire before the change but to what extent?  Did that get improved as well?    <br />
“Goooo ooon?” Keith looked at you as if assessing if you were ok.<br />
You broke eye contact and continued, “I... I can’t change things back to the way they were.” Truth, not the whole truth, but truth. “Maybe there’s a time limit or something but otherwise I think you’re stuck like this... possibly forever.”<br />
<br />
“Oh...” Keith looked down at the plate in his hand, then headed back to the kitchen.<br />
“Just Oh?”<br />
“I’m thinking, but I still having to obey your order to clean the apartment”<br />
“Well you can take a minute to stop and think”<br />
Keith stopped and stared at the wall for a few seconds, “It’s not super bad.  probably.  I can transform, I have a fusion power source that runs on everyday food, as a robot I’m probably going to have a much longer lifespan than I would have anyway...  This could be a good thing.”  Keith ran his hands over his body, then looked at you,  “I still have feelings, and all my senses.  Hopefully I can still orgasm once I have the equipment back.  And my best bud is now, well... Huh... Forever... Can I make another request?”<br />
“What?”<br />
“Well... I don’t know what your thoughts on kinky stuff or dominance was before all this, but if this is going to last forever and be my life from now on, would you be my Sir in the comparatively mundane relationship sense too?  Give me orders and use me, but also you know, kinda look after me, and help me improve and stuff?  It’s hot as it is right now but I kinda always wanted the emotional connection that comes with having a Dominant too.  Since I’m literally compelled to follow your every order it would seem almost natural, and if it’s going to be anyone, who better than my best bud?  If... well... I hope that’d be ok.”<br />
<br />
Man these keys were awesome, Keith was asking _you_ to start a relationship with _him_!  You sincerely hoped there was no time limit on how long this will last.  “I’m not super experienced in power play but Yeah I think I’d be ok with that. What about sex though?”<br />
“The sex itself doesn’t turn me on, that’s for sure... maybe you can use the keys to make your cum taste better? Ha!” keith shuddered at the memory.<br />
“I’ll see what I can do I guess.” You didn’t think it worked that way, but maybe something else could be done, “I suppose you could still date girls too, who knows Maybe I’ll end up dating someone like Marcus, so it wouldn’t have to be a purely sexual relationship.  Though you’re still not escaping from pleasing me completely and I have a lot of fun ideas of how to change you... body and mind.” You grinned evilly.<br />
“Well... I am your personal android slave with super awesome transforming powers, it would be a shame not to use ‘em”  Keith smiled at you and rubbed his chest.  “It’s intense but I’m liking it so far.”<br />
<br />
“Since the college thing and all your recent jobs were a bust I assume you have no objections about moving out east with me?”<br />
Keith’s smile widened, “Seriously?  Of course, I have no objection dude!  That will be so sweet!  A couple of buds in a new town.  Just you, and me and hot college chicks!”<br />
You raised your eyebrow<br />
“And hot college guys too I suppose.  Hey, why don’t you take a nap on the couch while your personal android slave finishes cleaning and we can do more fun stuff later?”<br />
“That sounds good” You sat down on the couch and popped up the recliner, wondering what to make of Keith’s requests, and of course what you’d do to him later.  The heated massage function kicked in before you got too far though and soon you were fast asleep.</p>
