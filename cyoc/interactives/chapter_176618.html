<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I could only lay there, choking with the desire to sob while the doctor walked around, looking me over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting. Dominick is fatter and heavier than his twin Nestor&quot; he said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eerrrrgghh hhhaaaww!&quot; I couldn&#39;t respond to that! I tried again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eeerrrgghhh hhhaaawww!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was only then, that I fully realized that I wouldn&#39;t be able to talk. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eeerrrgghh hhhaaaww!&quot;<br />
<br />
That was to be my speech from now on!<br />
<br />
&quot;Eeerrrrggghh hhhhhaaawww!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lying there on that table, i was struggling to come to terms with my new body. As I always would. But not quite this intensely. I was squirming about, trying to work my hands and feet. Trying to talk. Feeling more and more trapped. In all my squirmings, I was getting noticably hard!<br />
<br />
I don&#39;t want to be a donkey! This couldn&#39;t be my destiny! No way! But. Well. Here I am to this day, still on all fours and still unable to utter even a syllable. Forced to shove my face into a field of grass just to eat. No hands. <br />
<br />
And so,  there I lay on that table as a fat, gluttonous, obese beast of burden with new horrendous smells already wafting from my new body. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eeerrrrggghh hhhhhaaawww!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
I lifted my head and craned my longer, more flexible neck to take stock of my new body. Still believing I&#39;d see the pale smooth human skin covering my arms and legs. Instead, my eyes were greeted by the sight of my gray furry hide, ending in the sight of my new hooves at the ends of equine-shaped legs. It was like a nightmare. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eeerrrrggghh hhhhhaaawww!!! Eeerrrrggghh hhhhhaaawww!!! Eeerrrrggghh hhhhhaaawww!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
All I could do, was bray like the jackass I now was! <br />
<br />
&quot;Eeerrrrggghh hhhhhaaawww!!! Eeerrrrggghh hhhhhaaawww!!! Eeerrrrggghh hhhhhaaawww!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
I continued, as I struggled to flex my non-existant hands and fingers. <br />
<br />
I looked at the doctor to ask a question that was on my mind at the time.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Eeerrrrggghh hhhhhaaawww!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
I tried again. And again. My new large fuzzy ears crowning my head with humiliation picked up the unintelligible &quot;Eeerrrrggghh hhhhhaaawww!!!&quot; bray of a jackass issuing forth from my assinine mouth instead of human words. <br />
<br />
I lay my head back down on the table, defeated and still in denial. I closed my eyes, trying to picture my human form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no! No sleepy time now!&quot; someone said. I opened my eyes, and was greeted yet again by the image of a donkey reflected in the mirror above me. &quot;We have one more shot to make. This one, to make you a little more....compliant.&quot; <br />
<br />
Before i could do anything, an assistant jabbed a big long needle into my side.<br />
<br />
&quot;That solution will override your human brain with new messages to act like a proper donkey jack. Pretty soon,  your mind will dull into that of an ordinary animal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eeerrrrggghh hhhhhaaawww!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
I didnt want to be turned into a stupid mindless animal! Turns out, he was wrong about that last part. While I certainly acted more animal-like against my will, I did in fact, keep my intellect. Probably would have been better if I hadn&#39;t. While I still had some semblence of control over my body, I would never be able to resist my instincts to eat, shit, piss, and fuck every chance I had. It would be like my body went into automatic mode in order to satiate the instinctual parts of my brain, even if I mentally railed against those newfound humiliations. The result, was that I appeared to be an ordinary dimwitted donkey to humans. There would be no way for anyone to know I still posessed my human consciousness.<br />
<br />
I lay on the table for a few minutes, when the handler came over with a bridle of straps. I knew that would be fitted over my new long, fat face and further mark me as the beast I had become. I started resisting, but felt an overpowering instinct to just remain compliant. <br />
<br />
The old,  dirty,  used straps were fitted over my face and head. The handler tugged it in such a way that made me get off the table and onto my new four-legged stance. It was a really strange feeling. Almost like vertigo. I felt like I was falling, but ended up on my four hooves with four loud &quot;CLOPS&quot; and a &quot;haaawww!&quot;  This was it. I was now permanantly stuck on all fours! I felt sick, at my imprisoment.<br />
<br />
I wanted to be standing on two legs. I wanted to be able to speak. I was getting worked up, knowing the privelegdes of both have been revoked. The only response I had, was to get hard for the first time as a donkey. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,  look! Hes already ready to reproduce! Look at the size of him!&quot;<br />
<br />
I knew I now had the enormous black cock of a jackass between my new hind legs,  swinging from side to side and up and down with every movement for the world to see. I could also feel my new huge black nutsack wobbling around somewhere back there. I wanted to cover my shameful nakedness. The only thing I had, was a tail. But I quickly discovered I had little control over that. Sure, I could feel it moving around back there, occassionally wipping to one side or another. But it moved purely on instinct.<br />
<br />
I wanted my clothes back. <br />
&quot;Eeerrrrggghh hhhhhaaawww!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
The handler tugged on my bridle. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on,  big boy. Time to say goodbye to your family,  and hello to a mare we have set up for you to break you in.&quot;<br />
<br />
I pulled back, trying to resist. But the handler tugged on the lead in such a way as to force me to comply. With very heavy steps on my new hooves, I unwillingly went forward towards the door that Patrick had left through as a cow a little while ago. I still remember the look of his (her?) big brown eyes as she was led away towards a waiting bull when we were walking towards the building before I became myself a lowly farm animal.<br />
<br />
While we were inside waiting, my last moments as a human, she was becoming accustomed to her new low form and subjected to being raped and impregnated by a bull. The terrified sounds she must have been making while that bull forcefully deposited his seed inside of her. Now the same animalistic fate awaits me, except I&#39;ll be the one on top. As lowly a fate as I have, at least I didnt end up as low as that cow. <br />
<br />
Reproachfully,  I found myself following the handler outside. The sunlight greeted my large donkey pupils for the first time. It was brightfully blurry, and I had no hands or any sort of free limb to block it out. I could only slowly blink it out of my eyes with my heavier thicker lashes and lids.<br />
<br />
&quot;And here he is. Your former son. And brother, &quot; my large furry ears managed to easily pick up.<br />
<br />
I looked over out of my right eyeball, and saw a bunch of blurry figures standing outside where I knew was supposed to be a fence. Out of my left eye,  I saw another group of blurry figures walking down that ill-fated path. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is that really him? Is that really Vin?&quot;<br />
<br />
I opened my mouth to confirm and beg for help and mercy,  but only ended up braying instead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eeerrrrggghh hhhhhaaawww!!! Eeerrrrggghh hhhhhaaawww!!! Eeerrrrggghh hhhhhaaawww!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Not a single word was ever allowed to escape my thick,  black,  slimy donkey lips; no matter how hard I tried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eeerrrrggghh hhhhhaaawww!!! Eeerrrrggghh hhhhhaaawww!!! Eeerrrrggghh hhhhhaaawww!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
I also wanted to cry. Such human-level expressions were denied to me. All I could do, was bray like a jackass and goofily move my lips around my large blocky teeth. And get hard. I felt my huge male appendage become excited again out of pure frustration and feeling trapped inside thisnew obnoxious disgusting body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,  lets go to the breeding pen where we can break him in. You can bring your son along, for the lesson on biology.&quot;<br />
<br />
Along with my inability to outwardly communicate, I also lost my ability to recognize human facial expressions and facial differences. Mostly because of my new irritating nearsightedness and washed out lack of vibrant colors. But it turned out, even when a human got close enough to me to look at their face, I couldn&#39;t ever recognize any of them as being distinct! Not even if they are male or female! They all look the same! It would turnout that I couldnt recognize either of my (former) parents. I only knew my twin brother based on bis slighy smaller stature. But not his face.<br />
<br />
I found myself doing an about face as the handler pulled me along through the field. I could hear the two-legged movements of the people on the path. Slightly uphill through the spongey grass, and towards another fenced-in field. This one much smaller. As we got closer, I smelled her! Instantly, my large furry black wobbly donkey balls began churning. I could actually feel the potent hot liquid inside of them! My penis extended outwards even harder! The thought that real donkey DNA was being produced inside a real donkey penis attached tp my underside that i could feel as my own, utterly disgusted me <br />
<br />
&quot;Eeerrrrggghh hhhhhaaawww!!!&quot; I brayed in humiliation, knowing full well I would never be able to resist the really gross, disgusting, strong fishy odor coming from that female donkey. And that I would be performing in front of my family.<br />
<br />
The handler unbuckled the bridle and thankfully took it off my face as he released me inside that fence. My nose immediately picked up the fact that her scent was getting stronger. She noticed me as well, as she turned her rearend towards me and lifted her tail. Oh god! I found myself going up to practically bury my nose into her rear-end. The smell was horrendous, and I knew I would be gagging and maybe even throwing up if I were still human. The human part of my mind certainly wanted to. But my donkey body became intoxicated.<br />
<br />
Somehow, I lifted my large obese body up enough to land on her back side. Now enamored, I attempted to grip her, but my inflexible hooves lacked fingers which I would never get used to. Clumsily, I wrapped my front knees around her waist as much as possible, and walked my back legs forward. My donkey dick was searching for its home. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hhhhhaaawww Eeerrrrggghh Hhhhhaaawww!!!!&quot; I squealed in frustration at my lack of fingers and toes. The constant braying of my unpliable jackass voice and my utter humilation at such a lowly, disgusting station in life with head crowned by large furry ears, made me go ballistic. I took it all out through my smelly gigantic black penis that finally hit home as I buried it into a natural-born female donkey that has never had any sense of modesty or cleanliness in its life. <br />
<br />
Eeerrrrggghh hhhhhaaawww Eeerrrrggghh hhhhhaaawww Eeerrrrggghh hhhhhaaawww Eeerrrrggghh hhhhhaaawww Eeerrrrggghh hhhhhaaawww!!!&quot; I bellowed out loud over and over again,  until I saw the sparks in my head that matched the sparks down below. <br />
<br />
Over and over again, I squirted my donkey seed into her. Four, five, six times during the climax. As it neared the end, i climbed off her back, fully expecting to take to two feet. It was like an intense dream where I had forgotten I was now stuck as a donkey. To my utter surprise, consternation, and momentary confusion, I fell down onto all fours. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eeerrrrggghh hhhhhaaawww!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Shit! I cant speak! Im still stuck on all fours! And i lack my prescious hands and fingers! <br />
<br />
&quot;Eeerrrrggghh hhhhhaaawww!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked behind me, to see my large barrel-shaped body extending back towards my wide fat gray-colored left side, and let out another bray:<br />
<br />
&quot;Eeerrrrggghh hhhhhaaawww!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
I heard the people I came in with speaking. They were talking about me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, thats it then? Thats his blah?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,  he will be blah blah of.&quot; <br />
<br />
I blinked. I tried focusing on what they were saying,  but it slowly became more difficult. The more I tried to understand their speech, the less clear it came through my foggy brain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Blah blah blah blah son.&quot; <br />
<br />
That was it. Those people who were my former family walked away out of my life forever after that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eeerrrrggghh hhhhhaaawww!!!&quot; I tried yelling. But then felt my stomach rumbling. I tried resisting. Knowing full well it would be the final step towards full donkeyhood. But my stomach couldnt be ignored. I found my head lowering, my large jaw opening as I took my very first bite of grass.</p>
