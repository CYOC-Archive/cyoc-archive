<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer held the fetal position for minutes and anticipated for the gravity to shatter her body in to small chunks. But nothing happened. Jennifer took both of her hands off from her face and carefully opened her left eye lid. Jennifer’s forward movement had stopped and she was now laying on top of something. Jennifer sensed it was something soft under her arm which made her turn around. The soft fluffy thing under her was the mattress. Jennifer felt happiness when she saw the bed sheets full of sunflower patterns and images of pretty flowers. Jennifer had big blanket covering her body and a comfortable pillow under her head. Jennifer went from laying onto a sitting position and begun to turn her head. The void around her had completely disappeared and it was replaced by four solid walls filled with colorful posters that were stuck there with blu tack. Some of the posters looked self-drawn images of ponies and flowers while others looked store-bought ones. The room smelled like flowers with a hint of lemon and there were no sweaty or fishy scents in the room.<br />
<br />
Jennifer scratched her head and remembered an important thing that she had to check. She pushed the blanket away from her and was happy that under her flowery pajamas were no dents or bulging. Jennifer put both of the hand in front of her mouth and let out a cry of joy. The red headed Jennifer used the side the blanket as her tissue for her wet eyes and the nightmare had finally ended.<br />
<br />
Jennifer’s joyful emotions released all the dopamine in her body but soon Jennifer felt something approaching to her mouth from her stomach. Jennifer quickly jumped on the side of the bed and without a warning shot out a mouthful of stomach acid from her mouth on to the floor next to her bed. Jennifer stared at the brown bile that was now on the floor and she heard how loudly her heart was throbbing. The throbs sounded like two timpani drums that filled the cozy room with it’s rhythmical beats. The acidic stench ravaged Jennifer’s nose like if she had inhaled a stack of small needles and a single drop of sweat dropped on top of the brown pile from Jennifer’s forehead.<br />
<br />
Jennifer looked at her palms and the little amount of stomach acid that were on her fingers. It made Jennifer’s body tremble. Jennifer gasped for air as all the memories rushed back in her mind. The glass shards penetrated and shred Jennifer’s body and mind like a piece of paper. Every cell of of body screamed for help when new unwanted memories entered her mind. She didn’t want to know what her other self had done. Jennifer took her pillow and threw it in wall. Jennifer winced and wished the pain to end. The glass shards inserted themselves inside Jennifer’s head. Jennifer didn’t want them but they were now inside her.<br />
<br />
Jennifer felt how her body’s battery was running low. The room begun to turn more white and suddenly darkness engulfed everything. Moments later Jennifer opened her eyes once more and found herself back on the bed tucked under the blanket while Jennifer’s mother Silvia rubbed Jennifer’s arm softly.<br />
<br />
“What happened Jenny? Were you awaken by a nightmare?”<br />
<br />
Jennifer tried her best to make an eye contact with her mother but something vile that Jennifer didn’t want to witness was pulling her two irises downward to her mother’s gut. There was a big outward dent that pushed itself from her mother’s abdomen toward Jennifer’s direction. It was like a huge magnet for Jennifer’s eyes. Silvia’s midriff revealing tiger patterned crop top and her skin colored leggings as pajama shirt and pants made the belly appear even bigger. Jennifer spotted that her mother’s feet weren’t touching the floor anymore when she sat down on the regular sized chair. Silvia’s two legs swung like petite pendulums on the chair.<br />
<br />
Jennifer tried to make an eye contact with her mother but Jennifer saw something else that she found way too interesting than eye contact. Jennifer blinked her eyes twice when she saw how her mother’s massive tear shaped breasts swayed in motion like two basketballs in a shopping bag. Jennifer swallowed loudly when her two eyes tried to avert their gaze from two funbags that her mother had. Jennifer couldn’t tell if her mother had gotten younger, shorter, older or how Silvia had changed this time. Jennifer could only spot very minor details that were the most stricking when Jennifer saw her mother the last time. Jennifer could only stay quiet and watch when the calm looking Silvia dragged the chair under her towards Jennifer with her toes. Silvia&#39;s frontal heavy weight made the simple task look like a herculean triathlon. When Silvia reached near Jennifer she used back of her motherly hand to measure how warm her daughter’s forehead felt.<br />
<br />
“You also look very pale, Sis. Is everything all right?”<br />
<br />
Jennifer couldn’t open her mouth at all. The upper and lower lip were tightly glued on her mouth. The ceiling and it’s white paint looked way more interesting. Jennifer turned her head away from her mother saw from the window that it was sunny and bright day. Jennifer imagined herself running outside with other kids and she imagined how happy she should have had felt when she woke up. But something felt off. <br />
<br />
It was like a song she had heard multiple times but now the singed sounded jaded and awry. Jennifer didn’t know why her body had reacted that way, or actually, she knew. She knew what was happening but her mind wanted to have a rest. She didn’t want to deal with the things she was seeing right now. Jennifer’s eyes felt dry and she felt how much every muscle in her body shook like crazy. Jennifer turned her head back on her mother and gave the most weakest and forced smile that she would ever give to someone if she worked behind a retail counter. Jennifer didn’t want her mother to worry. Jennifer didn’t want to tell her mother how many rusty nails were currently penetrating her brain when she had seen the bulge on her mother’s belly. Jennifer didn&#39;t want to think about it. <br />
<br />
Jennifer continued her smile and told her mother with the most sweetest voice she could muster, “I might have a fever. Other than that I think I’m fine.”<br />
<br />
“Fever?”<br />
<br />
Jennifer’s ears perked up when her mother sounded so surprised. How was that an odd answer to give her mother when she asked if she was doing well or not. Jennifer continued her smiled and asked gently from her mother to elaborate with her question. Was the answer something she wasn’t supposed to have said. Silvia crossed her arms and leaned back on the chair. The round pregnant belly and big tear shaped chest followed Silvia’s movement like three big natural water balloons that were loosely taped on her body.<br />
<br />
She scratched her chin and said with a soft voice, “Well. I was secretly hoping you would have said something else.”<br />
<br />
“Like what?”<br />
<br />
“Like, ‘Congratulations sister. I’m finally pregnant,’ or something along those lines.”<br />
<br />
“Huh? Why would I say something like that?”<br />
<br />
Silvia’s pulled her jaw to the side and raised her eyebrow. Jennifer saw how her mother was genuinely confused and it looked like for her that her daughter was playing games with her.<br />
<br />
“Jenny. My sweet little pumpkin of a sister. Are you sure that it’s fever you have and not, like, an early symptoms of pregnancy?”<br />
<br />
“Hundred percent! This has to be a fever and nothing else.”<br />
<br />
The whole room was filled with an awkward silence. Jennifer saw from Silvia’s face how her mother didn’t know how to continue the conversation any further. Jennifer didn’t want to accept the words that came out of her mother’s mouth. Seconds passed and Silvia let out an audible puff of air from her mouth and stood up. Silvia didn’t say a word and only shook her head. Before Silvia left the room Jennifer saw visible disappointment and contempt in her mother’s eyes.<br />
<br />
When Silvia closed the door Jennifer begun to clench her teeth and rub her belly. Jennifer laid back on the bed and stared at the ceiling. She wasn’t ready to take on a day which was sure to be as shocking as it was yesterday. She could feel how much mental and physical she had wasted by throwing a hissy fit at the curse like a rambling lunatic shaking his fist at the clouds. Jennifer contemplated in her mind if she should cut her losses and accept her doomed fate or stand up and fight against the curse. Was her mom home schooling her anymore or had Silvia fallen with her daughter as a victim to the curse. All Jennifer knew was that when she opened that door it meant more misery for her.</p>
