<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Doctor Stein was surprised to have gotten the call that ultimately brought him into Louisiana after a call had come in regarding a building collapse in the state. To some degree he could accept a lot of people would want to become Animalians to recover from injury or old age, as a fair number of people had already availed themselves of that option. Project Phoenix had been a big part of that program and Horizon took pride in it. But when this request came in, he was surprised because the request was coming from a group that normally had stayed away from Animalia, not because of hatred but because of their vows. The request came from a Sister Mary Lazarus, the head of the Sisters of Mercy Convent of St. Tammany County, Louisiana.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for coming,&quot; said the medical doctor to Doctor Stein as they made they walked through one of the hallways that lead toward the wing that they had the sisters in, &quot;I&#39;m told that this program Horizon provides can do a lot for healing...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It does,&quot; Doctor Stein answered, &quot;it can cure just about any disease as part of the transformation, allow for the regrowth of lost limbs, and healing various injuries without any difficulty and some of the largest buyers for the Animalia Virus are those looking to heal injuries or diseases. Though they&#39;ve usually been on an individual basis.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve never had the victims of a shared home that collapsed on them make the request,&quot; the medical doctor said slowly, &quot;which is what happened with the sisters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are they alright?&quot; Doctor Stein wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Largely,&quot; the doctor spoke, &quot;though given how long that they were all likely burried in that building, we had to do a few amputations and provide treatment for a variety of other crushing injuries. They&#39;re about as good as they can be. But if they&#39;re to do anything besides lay on their back or sit in a wheelchair... there isn&#39;t much more that we can do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Horizon can help with that, though I am a bit curious as to why they would want to be Animalians,&quot; Doctor Stein said slowly, &quot;Animalians lead pretty... well... sexual lives. I would think that people that have taken Vows of Chastity wouldn&#39;t want to have to deal with that increased libido.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That will be something that you&#39;d have to ask Sister Mary Lazarus directly,&quot; the medical doctor asked, &quot;and be prepared for this... as she will want to know if you have the doses.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Stein only tapped the suitcase he was carrying. They then walked along until they came through an open doorway into a specialized wing in the hospital. As they entered, Doctor Stein could see the rows of doors that ran along one side of a hall and then another set of doors running down the other side. He could just make out that three doors were open on one side and then two on another. The doctor was headed to the first door on the left, where Doctor Stein could also note that there was someone in the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;All six are here in these rooms here,&quot; the medical doctor spoke, &quot;and Sister Mary Lazarus is in this room.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Stein nodded and entered the room to find an older woman looking toward him. The blankets pulled up to her waist, though Doctor Stein noted that the the woman had lost a leg. At the same time there were bandages around her head and covering one eye. He watched as the woman blinked and then slowly nodded to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You the man from Horizon?&quot; Sister Mary Lazarus asked in a semi weak voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; Doctor Stein answered as politely as he could, or as what he thought was the most polite way of answering, &quot;My name is Doctor Stein.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sister Mary Lazarus,&quot; the nun answered, &quot;I assure you that I&#39;m healthier than I look.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; Doctor Stein said slowly, &quot;though I am a bit puzzled why you and your sisters would request conversion to heal your wounds.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The church has given no condemnation of Animalians,&quot; Sister Mary Lazarus answered, &quot;and to a degree... this was something of a bit of guilt for all of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Stein blinked in some surprise at this. Aside form the obvious looks of pain that Sister Mary Lazarus had, he could see nothing that he could consider a &quot;sign of guilt&quot; on her. In fact the pained smile that formed on her lips made him think that this older and wounded nun was quite the kind hearted person and would do all she could to be kind. He couldn&#39;t see how this woman would feel guilty.<br />
<br />
&quot;You see, our convent also served as a shelter for stray cats in the area,&quot; Sister Mary Lazarus said slowly, &quot;many roam the streets in the town nearby and in various parts of the county. Many of them live horrible lives where they are at risk of being killed by cars, stray dogs, or snakes and many of the secular run shelters were over-worked and under funded.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you sought to help...&quot; Doctor Stein mused and watched as the nun nodded in reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;We got them medical care, cleaned them up, and would train them as best we could,&quot; Sister Mary Lazarus continued, &quot;and would the offer them up for adoption. It was something that also helped keep us involved with the community and brighten the day for those that desire pets.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a brief moment of silence as the two looked to each other. Eventually Sister Mary Lazarus gave a slight cough to clear her throat and then continued her explanation.<br />
<br />
&quot;The last storm hit all of us hard,&quot; Sister Mary Lazarus said slowly, &quot;our convent was totally wrecked by it... It was the storm that caused the collapse and then the power went out and we were left burried for quite some time. When we were rescued... were hungry and injured. Thankfully the doctors here managed to save us...&quot; Her voice fell off at the end as she looked down and a tear came down from the one eye that Doctor Stein could see, &quot;but the cats we cared for... they were killed when our building collapsed in the storm. We survived... but the charges we cared for were killed... or died of starvation after the storm passed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that is why you all wished to become cat Animalians?&quot; Doctor Stein asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Sister Mary Lazarus said with some firmness, &quot;to honor those we cared for and in a way loved... and to be able to resume our missions of mercy for those animals that aren&#39;t uplifted and bring joy to the local people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Doctor Stein said slowly, &quot;well, Horizon would be more than happy to offer this to you... though there are other concerns...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have already contacted the bishops and superiors in the church,&quot; Sister Mary Lazarus spoke, &quot;so long as we can hold to our vows to the church, they would not forbid the conversion. Though, while the Bishops that my convent reported to are mostly Franciscans and thus might see Animalia and Animalians as a means to serve the Patron Saint of Animals... I suspect their approval was more financial. Paying for our conversion would be cheaper than caring for us while recovering without limbs... or with great weakness in those limbs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; Doctor Stein said slowly, &quot;though... I must also remind you, that Animalians are known for a high libido, higher than normal humans, and there have been times where those who are older have that super-charged. Are you sure you can hold to any and all vows of chastity?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Matters of the body ultimately pale before the matters of the will,&quot; Sister Mary Lazarus answered, &quot;the desires may be there, but with proper focus... they can be endured. Just as I endured them when I was a young woman and made my commitment to God.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re sure?&quot; Doctor Stein asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am,&quot; Sister Mary Lazarus insisted.<br />
<br />
Doctor Stein then looked back to the medical doctor, who seemed to nod and give the permission that the conversions could be carried out. The medical doctor then called on various nurses to come in and begin to disconnect Sister Mary Lazarus from the IVs that had been needed to administer pain killers and other medicines while she&#39;d been in the hospital. Once that was done, Doctor Stein then administered the Animalia Virus shots and this was soon repeated with the other six, a Sister Mary Veronica, a Sister Mary Augusta, Sister Mary Amelia,  Sister Mary Aquina, and Sister Mary Josephine. It ultimately left him with six very healthy looking Cat Animalians when their transformations finished, with bandages removed and smiles on their newly grown feline muzzles. The only &quot;issue&quot; that might have been there was that the gowns the hospital had given them to wear were stretched a bit and their open backs had the potential for their new tails to move the material about, but thankfully the gowns were big enough to preserve their modesty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Doctor Stein,&quot; Sister Mary Lazarus said with a smile, &quot;you&#39;ve done all of us a great kindness.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure...&quot; Doctor Stein said slowly, &quot;but I will also have to administer the vaccine for the Animalia Virus... that you are not infectious to anyone as per all requirements.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The state would also require written verification that that vaccine was administered,&quot; the medical doctor spoke, &quot;which we can handle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Sister Mary Lazarus answered with complete calm, &quot;we all have our roles to fill...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As for any and all acclamation classes,&quot; Doctor Stein spoke, &quot;I believe you might be able to get some help from a Beauregard and Jill Shucks that live in the state. As they are Animalians.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re Gators, though,&quot; Sister Mary Veronica wondered, &quot;wouldn&#39;t their instincts be... different?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In terms of specific instincts, sure,&quot; Doctor Stein answered, &quot;but in many ways there are a great many instincts that seem to cross all Animalians, regardless of species. And they can help... though I think they live south of Baton Rouge while we&#39;re presently east of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We will get in contact with him, and see what his work schedule will allow and what else he is involved in,&quot; Sister Mary Lazarus commented, &quot;despite his work in real estate and development... he&#39;s also devoted a lot of his time to protecting much of the natural habitats in the state. Essentially looking to develop land in an ecologically friendly way. Various local papers and news entities have documented this... especially after he became an Animalian.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Stein could only nod to that.</p>
