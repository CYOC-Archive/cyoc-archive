<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Isaac wait!”<br />
<br />
Ilivir turned around to see Nat barely out of sight. Annoyance building up within him, he hollered back. “What do you want?”<br />
<br />
The young looking woman yelled back. “You agreed to be my teacher! When are we going to train?!”<br />
<br />
Ilivir was already opening up his metal pouch. “I’ll train you when I come back!”<br />
<br />
Not waiting any longer, Ilivir left the girl to her own devices. Isaac will come back. He always comes back. He’ll leave the training to him.<br />
<br />
As he walked, he went back to doing what he has been doing for awhile now… thinking.<br />
<br />
He is finally in control of Isaac’s body! Now what? Nothing really changed. Isaac WILL regain control no matter what Ilivir could do. He’s just too strong.<br />
<br />
Ever since Isaac absorbed his soul into his halo, Ilivir has begun remembering a lot of things from his corrupted life. The things he did as a werewolf, his life as Isaac’s spawn, and most importantly… His life from before his corruption.<br />
<br />
As Ilivir walked through the forest, he thought back to the last time he had sex as a human. It was with that female wolf. That session was more mind blowing then he could have imagined. He even used his powers of purity to burn away some of the corruption just to extend his session. Once he was fully turned, he just kept on fucking her. His memory after he became a corrupt is a little foggy, but he thinks he remembered that fucking to last for days. It was probably the best he had in his life. Thinking back, he kinda remembers having children with that corrupted wolf woman. He’s not sure how many however. Nor did he remember his mate’s name… That was only the first of many mates he had… <br />
<br />
Looking back, all those fucking sessions… became boring after awhile. Sex was all he did as a werewolf. He didn’t even need to eat so as long he fucked. And as much as it surprises him… He actually missed being human. <br />
<br />
There were so many things he wanted to do back in the day. Like becoming an artist, building up his cottage, and maybe do more research. But after all this time, he still hasn’t been able to do any of that. As satisfying life as a sex animal was… was it really worth it?<br />
<br />
Ever since Isaac mentioned the history of the dark knights back at the mansion, Ilivir has been… silently listening, remembering and… thinking... <br />
<br />
What does he want?<br />
<br />
Isaac has been talking not knowing whether he should choose being a Dark Knight or Paladin… <br />
<br />
Ilivir on the other hand… always wanted to be a Dark Knight.<br />
<br />
After he first witnessed those two werewolves fucking, he’s been wanting to become a Dark Knight and feel that pleasure…<br />
<br />
But then the last Dark Knight up and died before he could teach Ilivir how to be a Dark Knight. So he did the next best thing and became one of the first paladins. The first division of paladins had to study the Dark Knight’s ways and figure out how to use their methods to counteract corruption. Hence the focus on using purity instead of corruption. Of course, Ilivir studied the Dark Knight’s ways only to keep his humanity while having sex with the corrupt. And he had many sex sessions with the corrupt before turning…<br />
<br />
But what is he going to do now? Years of his life gone, because he wanted to become an animal. His world is completely different from his time. Even if he had his own human body again, what was he gonna do with it? Everyone he knew is gone. And that paladin… He is supposedly from a long line of paladins… and line he helped start. Ilivir is not sure what to think of that. Why is Isaac is so adamant on ending something that has been part of their lives for so long?<br />
<br />
There is one thing Ilivir knows for sure however. Isaac intends on ending the corruption. But without the corruption… Then what would happen next? Corruption has been so integral to the kingdom for so long, that it’s are almost reliant on it. He doesn’t mind not having corrupt sex anymore, but just ending it sounds so… simple.  For some reason he can’t put his finger on, Ilivir just knows that Isaac is wrong somehow. That ending the corruption won’t automatically make things better.<br />
<br />
Ilivir’s face held grimly at that thought.<br />
<br />
Sometimes he wonders why does he put up with Isaac. <br />
<br />
Isaac is going to make a mistake he can’t take back... And Ilivir will be there waiting for the right moment to stop him.<br />
<br />
*Squawk!*<br />
<br />
“Huh?”<br />
<br />
*Squawk!* *Squawk!* *Squawk!*<br />
<br />
Ilivir hid behind a bush as he watched a scuffle play out ahead of him. <br />
<br />
Ahead of him seems to be a clearing. In the middle of the clearing is a misty looking nest full of… They look like harpies from legends of old from his world.<br />
<br />
Actually, now that he’s paying attention more, it looks like two flocks of harpy fighting for territory. Though it seems the owners of the nest are not putting up a fight. They are just flying away. They don’t even look concerned about abandoning their nest.<br />
<br />
Once the losing flock succeeded in escaping, the winning flock celebrated on their rival’s nest.<br />
<br />
“And STAY away from our territory, you weirdos!” One of the harpies shouted.<br />
<br />
“Boss. Should we take over their nest?”<br />
<br />
The leader of the flock shook her head. “Don’t bother. In fact, destroy it to make sure those outcasts don’t come back. No normal harpy would build their nest out in the open like this. This is a perfect place for hunters snipe out.”<br />
<br />
And so the harpies proceeded to dismantle their rival’s nest.<br />
<br />
Ilivir just watched and waited.<br />
<br />
Once they were done destroying the nest, their leader sniffed out the area.<br />
<br />
“There is something here… It smells like nothing I smelled before…”<br />
<br />
She’s probably talking about him. It’s probably about time to move.<br />
<br />
But before Ilivir could do anything, another harpy flew in from the distance to meet with the flock leader. “Boss! A group of hunters are nearby our nest! They don’t seem to be well armed nor does there seem to be that many of them. Should we engage them?”<br />
<br />
Their “Boss” pondered to herself for a moment.<br />
<br />
“Let us at least see if they are as defenseless as they seem...”<br />
<br />
And thus, they flew off in the distance. <br />
<br />
This is honestly none of Ilivir’s business, but they did catch his curiosity.<br />
<br />
And so, Ilivir took off after them.<br />
<br />
…<br />
<br />
“Do you think the rumors about the Sky King coming to these mountains is true?”<br />
<br />
“I mean… This IS Mount Sky. It’s his favorite hunting grounds.” The other hunter responded.<br />
<br />
“No, I mean are the rumors about him coming here sometime this week are true?” The first hunter clarified.<br />
<br />
The second hunter shrugged his shoulders. “How should I know? It’s not like he announces when he’ll be coming.”<br />
<br />
“I just hope he doesn’t hog all the good kills this time.” The first hunter muttered.<br />
<br />
Just then, they heard some screeching from the distance. <br />
<br />
“Everyone brace yourselves! Incoming harpies!”<br />
<br />
…<br />
<br />
By the time Ilivir arrived, it was already too late for the hunters. They were either dead, or being raped to death by the harpies. Their cargo are already being searched through by the harpies.<br />
<br />
“We got their food!” <br />
<br />
“Alright! Let&#39;s return to our nest!” The boss shouted.<br />
<br />
Ilivir silently followed them to a cave not too far from were they massacred those hunters.<br />
<br />
All the harpies went in there, so that probably means their nest is inside the cave. Certainly makes sense to hide from hunters.<br />
<br />
Of course, a clever hunter like Ilivir could just blow up the cave entrance and seal the harpies off from their food stash… But doesn’t really have the right magic items to do that right now.<br />
<br />
Ilivir readied his sword. He’ll just have to hunt them the old fashioned way then! This should be a fun way to blow off steam!<br />
<br />
…<br />
<br />
They didn’t stood a chance.<br />
 <br />
Ilivir held their leader tightly in one of his outstretched arms, his rib cage already opened up and ready to absorb the harpy.<br />
 <br />
Even now, she and her flock tried to swipe at him with their clawed legs, only for any wounds from their attacks to regenerate instantly.<br />
 <br />
The hunt overall was a fun change of pace for Ilivir. Especially now that has his own body complete with Isaac’s abilities.<br />
 <br />
Besides from sex and researching the Dark Knights, Ilivir enjoyed hunting. It’s been such a long time since he had a proper hunt! And this time… he is the predator!<br />
 <br />
It was a fun game of cat and mouse were the harpies used actual tactics to try to ambush Ilivir. However, Isaac’s body was just too durable and heavy for the harpies. They did try to tip Isaac’s body over, which was a clever strategy, but despite his body’s weight, it also too wide and balanced to be tipped over by the harpies’ light bodies.<br />
 <br />
Ilivir could just assimilate her and her flock right now and be done with it. Sure, Isaac would complain about absorbing “sapient” beings…. But Ilivir just doesn’t care such things.<br />
 <br />
Whether Isaac likes it or not, the plan still involves him absorbing a living being. If Isaac truly wanted to get lighter, he could have absorbed all that wildlife they passed by so far. Why waste their time looking for Pegasus if Isaac is not willing to absorb anything living? Why slow himself down? He didn’t have a problem absorbing others before. Why stop now? He’s probably doing them a favor by stopping them from harming others.<br />
 <br />
But then… a thought occurred to Ilivir.<br />
 <br />
Why would he make things easier for Isaac? He’s trying to sabotage his quest to end the corruption. Not speed him along. Surely, if he spares the harpies while he’s in control, then Isaac will also spare them just for being able to speak.<br />
 <br />
For now, he’ll just have to let these harpies live to prevent arousing suspicion. Since Isaac currently isn’t willing to kill the living, then he’ll just do the next thing…<br />
 <br />
“Listen closely. If you don’t want me to eat you and your flock right now, you will do as I say…”<br />
 <br />
The harpy leader stared at Ilivir’s face with courage and skepticism in her eyes. “What do you want?”<br />
 <br />
Ilivir thought back when he saw the harpies raping those hunters to death. Despite spending years having sex himself, he found it kinda… off putting.<br />
 <br />
“Why do you rape your victims to death? Why do you fuck them at all?”<br />
 <br />
Personally, Ilivir has no problems with raping strangers. So as long it feels good for both parties, it should be fine, right? But killing them? How can they experience sex again if they are dead?<br />
 <br />
The harpy leader eyed him warily. “Us harpies don’t normally give birth to males. However, our species are able to mate with any male from any species. As for why we kill our mates, we simply can’t have them give away our positions.”<br />
 <br />
Ilivir frowned at that. “Surely, there must be a better way than just killing off your mates.”<br />
 <br />
She shrugged her shoulders. “It’s the harpy way. It worked for us so far. That way, we can dispatch our prey while also being able to mate. Only traitors would consider letting their prey go.” She said that with resentment in her voice.<br />
 <br />
As he listened to her testimony, his genitals arched from pressure.<br />
 <br />
An idea came to mind.<br />
 <br />
“How ‘bout this? I will give you and your flock a chance that will benefit both of us. I will let you all mate with me to death. If I manage to stay alive however, you and your flock will have to pick me and my companions up and fly us to wherever I tell you to go.”<br />
 <br />
The leader’s eyes narrowed with annoyance. “We don’t accept payment. Not even in seeds.“<br />
 <br />
Ilivir nodded. “I accept the declination.”<br />
 <br />
Ilivir willed Isaac’s body to sprout vines and grab the entire harpy flock. “May you serve me with honor.”<br />
 <br />
The leader’s eyes widened in panic. “Wait!”<br />
 <br />
Ilivir held the harpies in place. “Yes?...”<br />
 <br />
“I accept the challenge. But only to save my flock. Even if it means taking in your revolting seed.”<br />
 <br />
“Excellent!” Ilivir said with a smile.<br />
<br />
The harpy leader wasn’t done yet. “But be aware. If your companions are light enough, my flock may be able to carry them, But you… You are too heavy to carry.”<br />
 <br />
Ilivir frowned in thought. He is well aware of that drawback. She and her flock has indeed already tried to carry Ilivir during his battle with them… They couldn’t even lift him much less move him.<br />
 <br />
Back to the initial plan then. “Alright. I have another question then... Do you know any powerful Pegasus?”<br />
 <br />
The harpy leader looked up in thought. “Well… There is Sagittarius… Stargazer the tactician… and Cliffskipper, the fastest delivery Pegasus out there…”<br />
 <br />
The harpy leader fretted under Ilivir’s gaze. He simply kept staring at her in hopes of getting more information out of her. “Oh! You must be talking the “Horned One”!”<br />
 <br />
“Do you know this “Horned One”?”<br />
 <br />
Her eyes wavered for a moment. “Maybe…” She said slyly. “I do know where the Horned One might be.”<br />
 <br />
Ilivir simply nodded. “Can you and your flock take me and my companions to this horned one?”<br />
 <br />
“If we can carry them. But you will have to follow us from the ground.”<br />
 <br />
Ilivir nodded. “Very well.”<br />
 <br />
Ilivir willed his metal cock pouch to open up, and with his free hand, he grabs his former captor’s spawn, and carelessly tossed it to the side.<br />
 <br />
“Wait.” The leader mustered. “You have already bested me in one battle. It’s only fair that I know the name of the one who defeated me.”<br />
 <br />
Ilivir nodded in respect. “Very well. I go by many names. To my companions, I am called Isaac… You may call me that as well outside of battle. But during these two battles, know that “Ilivir” defeated you.” As much as he wants to remain under the radar, he rather take credit for defeating a worthy foe.<br />
 <br />
The leader nodded in understanding. “Very well “Ilivir”. I shall remember your names well. In return, I shall give you my name. I am Sen. The older sister of “Len the traitor”.”<br />
 <br />
Ilivir nodded in respect. “I shall remember your name well. Though, I never met your sister.”<br />
 <br />
Sen stared at Ilivir’s eyes with conviction. “Let us hope you never do.”<br />
 <br />
Ilivir nodded in acknowledgment. He then readied his cocks. “Are you ready for your second battle.”<br />
 <br />
Sen looked to her fellow flock for confirmation.<br />
<br />
“Yes. Me and my flock are ready for your challenge of survival.”<br />
 <br />
Ilivir smiled in sly content.<br />
 <br />
“Let us begin the challenge.”<br />
 <br />
He didn’t wait as he plunged his twin cocks into the leader’s small clit. The rest of her flock joined in.<br />
 <br />
Ilivir knows her kind well. She will either escape or backstab him when she gets the chance. Luckily, Isaac’s body equipped to countered such attempts…<br />
 <br />
Well… They could try to kidnap Isaac’s companions…. There’s not much he can do to chase after them. Not that Ilivir cares if they do carry away Isaac’s companions. Besides, Isaac will probably think of a firmer way to keep them in check from a distance.<br />
 <br />
In a way, the harpy leader is not that different from Ilivir himself.<br />
 <br />
He too will wait for the right opportunity to backstab his captor…<br />
 <br />
…But for now, he needs to blow up some much-needed steam while he has a body.<br />
<br />
--------------------------<br />
<br />
The 1&#39;s Note: I&#39;m back! This is the second of two versions I wrote for this encounter. As far as I know, this version is considered a part of ChronoSeth&#39;s continuity. The original chapter was a lot more optimistic. However, ChronoSeth felt that the original version&#39;s cheery tone was too different from what came before. He was expecting savage harpies that rape their victims to death. Not what I wrote. So I wrote up a second version of that chapter to better fit ChronoSeth&#39;s vision. This is that chapter. The first version is called &quot;The Value of Sex&quot;.<br />
<br />
Another thing to note that the chapters &quot;A Beginning to an End&quot; to &quot;Bewildering Breakfast&quot; by ChronoSeth are loosely based off a bunch of drafts (I haven&#39;t posted yet) and a story arc outline I wrote up and showed ChronoSeth and a few other writers. As a result, his chapters have a lot my own ideas in them. So just so you know, ideas such as... &quot;A thief who stole Alice&#39;s Tome&quot;, &quot;A Breakfast with Alicia&quot; and &quot;Mary&#39;s secret heritage&quot; were all ideas I came up with. I guess ChronoSeth forgot to explain that. Oh well.<br />
<br />
Welp, I hope you enjoyed the chapter!</p>
