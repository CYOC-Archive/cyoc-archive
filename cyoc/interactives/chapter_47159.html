<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;We are going to be testing Formula 4 today.&quot;  The Doctor lifted the syringe, giving it a few taps and a slight press on the plunger.  Eric pulled up his sleeve, but the doctor just laughed.  &quot;Oh no, this shot doesn't go there.  Please disrobe and lay face down on the bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric sighed, eying the two mirrored walls, but pulled off his clothes anyway.  Eric's one problem was that he had always been average, and it was clear with his clothes off.  He wasn't out of shape, but he wasn't exactly fit either, a little bit of pudge around his midsection put on freshman year.  A treasure trail and a bit of hair in the middle of his chest was all he ever grew, his body hair everywhere was mostly sparse.  As well, his circumcised cock was unimpressive, four flacid inches appearing even smaller in the cool air.  He walked over to the bed and laid down on his stomach, the sheets felt good on his skin, &quot;Hmm.. Silk.&quot;  While he was distracted by the bed he felt a prick in his butt cheek and a slow spreading warmth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Roll over please, and just lay there.&quot;  The doctor put the syringe in his pocket as he headed from the room, probably to the observation room behind the mirrored wall.  Eric couldn't help but feel odd just laying there, but his thought were quickly pulled to his crotch as he felt a familiar stiffening.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not while I'm being watched..&quot; Eric groaned to himself, looking down at his cock.  The six hard inches sticking directly up into the air.  HE felt a heat run through it, from his balls up through the shaft, like a miniature orgasm, causing him to grip the sheets.  It was followed by two more in rapid succession, making him sit up.  &quot;Oh god, is this supposed to happen?!&quot;<br />
<br />
A voice broke into the room, crackling over a loud speaker.  &quot;It is normal, please relax and lay back down.&quot;  Eric did as he was told, still watching his cock as it spasmed from the waves of warmth.  Something looked off, he knew is cock, perhaps a little too well because of his sessions in the shower every morning, it didn't look right.  It seemed swollen, even at his hardest it hadn't been like this, and what was that uncomfortable tugging at the base?<br />
<br />
He reached down, but paused for a moment, no voice stopped him so he cupped his balls.. or ball..  He could only fit one in his hand, the other still hanging free.  It was the size of an egg, and still growing in his hand.  And there was no mistaking it this time, his cock was larger, it looked to be almost eight inches now, and thicker, the weight pulling it down towards his stomach.  He gritted his teeth as another rapid series of waves passed through the organ, the ball cupped in his hand first becoming the size of a lemon, then an orange, his dick slowly creeping past his navel.  The intense feelings were getting to be almost too much, pre glistening on the tip of his cock, and it crept creeping closer.  As his balls swelled to grapefruit size the head of his cock rested on his chest, it had to be easily two feet long, and so thick, he would have bet his two hands couldn't circle it.  Finally letting the one testicle go, feeling it drop against the fabric between his legs, he instead grabbed his cock between his two hands, and he was right, he couldn't get his hands all the way around.  But with a bit of a scrunch, he felt the tip press against his lips.  Running his tongue over it, tasting himself for the first time, he put as much of it as he could in his mouth as a last wave pushed him into an actual orgasm, filling his mouth with seed until it couldn't take anymore, the rest pouring down his chin and dripping on his chest.<br />
<br />
After a few moments, the door opened, readmitting the doctor, who tossed him a towel.  &quot;Clean up, then come over here.&quot;  He sat, setting aside a clipboard and an odd looking device.  Eric blushed, wiping himself off as best he could, the attitude of the doctor causing him to go almost immediately limp, but even so, the weight between his legs was so odd, his balls hung down to his knees, the head of his cock down the far as well.  He walked over and the doctor pressed a button on the device, which hit Eric with a light. &quot;Just scanning your body data into the computers.  &quot;If you're curious, flaccid you are 2 feet long, 9 inches around.  Testicles each eight inches in diameter.  Erect,3 feet long, 15 inches around.&quot;  The doc tapped the screen, the rest of these numbers you should know. &quot;Height 5'10&quot;, weight 140...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do?&quot;  Eric stammered slightly interrupting the doctor, who merely sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;This was a drug designed to increase a man's natural testosterone production with one dose.  We gave you an extra large one.  And of course, to increase testosterone production, one must have larger testicles.  This will be your room as we observe you over the next few months.&quot;  The doctor stood grabbing his clip board.<br />
<br />
&quot;Months?!&quot;  Eric shook his head, he expected a few weeks, and being able to go home.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was in the contract you signed.  We need to see the effects of increased production on your body, and for that we need observation. Please, make yourself at home.&quot;  And with that the doctor left.</p>
