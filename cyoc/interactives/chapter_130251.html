<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You were serving their drinks to them and you bend over to fetch some more glasses. You suddenly hear a whistle and you stand right up to see an anthro leopard man, who was obviously drunk, with a bar looking at you with a big dopey smile. &quot;You have one fine ass *hic* tiger!&quot; The leopard cheered and you blushed.<br />
<br />
One of the animals from before rolled their eyes at him and the one who was a lion groaned,&quot;Ugh, drunk bastard.&quot; You then looked to the group from before and said,&quot;Uh....one second please gentlemen.&quot; You walked up to the drunk leopard now and he looked at you still smiling and said,&quot;Aw, did I upset the *hic* big bad kitty?&quot;<br />
<br />
You sighed at the man and you facepalmed and saw your orange and black striped fur like a bangle tiger. At least you knew what you were now, but you had to deal with this idiot first. &quot;Sir, I’m going to have to ask you to...&quot;<br />
<br />
The leopard then busted out laughing and he looked at your breasts and said,&quot;You’re rack looks nice,&quot; He then lunged forward and grabbed onto your breasts with his claws, and you screamed,&quot;Gah!&quot; <br />
<br />
You then smacked the leopard&#39;s hand and growled at him then he just gave you a cocky grin and said,&quot;Oooh, kitty is feisty!&quot; The leopard then fell off of his chair and he vomited on the floor. The lion then stood up from his stool and growled,&quot;That’s it! You’re out of here!&quot; He and another animal stood up, an anthro cheetah man, and they grabbed him by the arms and they dragged the drunk out of sight.<br />
<br />
You groaned and took a moment to compose yourself then you sighed,&quot;Guess I should clean that up.&quot; It was then an anthro skunk man of all things, in a janitor uniform, that came out from the kitchen door to your right and said,&quot;No, that’s my job, thanks for the offer though newbie, I&#39;ll take it from here.&quot;<br />
<br />
You watched the skunk grab a mop and a wet floor sign and start to clean up the puke, and moments later you saw the two gentlemen who threw the leopard out return to their seats. You walked up to them and smiled then said,&quot;Sorry about that, but thanks for the help with that freak.&quot;<br />
<br />
The member of the group who was a wolf nodded and said,&quot;Yeah that was just Ralph, and he&#39;s just like that.&quot; The final member of the group who was a tiger man nodded and said,&quot;Yeah, it’s kind of our job to keep guys like him in check. I’m Reese, the wolf here is Alex, the lion is Chad, and the cheetah is Spots.&quot; You nodded to him and looked to the others and paused then blushed. &quot;I uh...forgot your drink orders....in the moment of uh...that situation. Apologies but can you all remind me what you ordered?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad nodded and said,&quot;That’s understandable, I&#39;m going to have a talk to him later.&quot; The group reminded you of what they ordered and you served their drinks just as they wanted. Spots smiled at you and said,&quot;Thanks....uh....Kari, right?&quot; <br />
<br />
You paused then looked down and saw a name tag on your uniform that read &quot;Kari&quot; and you nodded to them. &quot;Should I pay for your drinks? I feel like I owe you at least something for getting rid of that guy.&quot; You exclaimed then the tiger shook his head and said,&quot;Nah, not mine at least. You seem like you&#39;ve had a rough night.&quot; The others nodded individually in agreement then Chad added,&quot;It’s just our job, just like it is yours to be here.&quot;<br />
<br />
The skunk then looked back at you and said,&quot;Probably want to close up soon. The place is opening up to humans, and we don’t want them getting worried about seeing empty habitats. Personally I can get away with it and clean a bit more, we skunks aren’t the most uncommon of a sight. You on the other paw will be noticed, so you should probably get to your place soon.&quot; You looked at the skunk and nodded then the group quickly finished their drinks and they paid you.<br />
<br />
You got a rather large tip from each of them, the biggest being from the Reese and the next biggest from Alex. As the others began to leave Alex turned back to you and said,&quot;You look good as a bartender by the way miss. I&#39;ll make sure I come back again.&quot; <br />
<br />
The skunk continued to clean up as you counted out everything you earned today as far as cash money, and then Reese tapped you on the shoulder and said,&quot;You know where to go from here? I&#39;ll help you if you need it.&quot;<br />
<br />
You paused then shook your head and said,&quot;Sorry, I don’t really know my way around here.&quot; Reese nodded then offered you his paw and said,&quot;Ah, so that’s why I haven’t seen you before. You just arrived recently haven’t you?&quot; You replied with a nod then you took his paw, and then the skunk shouted,&quot;Hey, you don’t have much time you know!&quot;<br />
<br />
Reese then nodded to you and the two of you took off running out of the bar, and the shop by extension. You couldn’t help, but noticed the bouncing motion of your breasts as you ran. Eventually the two of you reached an enclosure that indeed looked like it could house jungle cats. The enclosure itself looked like a combination between a jungle and a savannah, with a cave, a large boulder, and tall grass that was all in in front of a few plexiglass windows and metal bars. <br />
<br />
You approached a cage door that opened with a key that Reese had on him, and you watched him do so as if you were almost admired by that. Reese then began taking off his uniform, which looked fitting as a security guard, and you watched him strip nude and blushed. &quot;Hey...uh you alright Kari?&quot; Reese asked waving his paw in front of your face and you shook your head to focus yourself, but still blushed red.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh...why are you....doing that?&quot; You asked pointing to the pile of clothes on the floor. Reese paused giving you a puzzled look then he said,&quot;You really are new aren’t you? We have to do this every day so that the visitors see us in doing our &quot;natural duties in our natural environment&quot; so we all have to strip unfortunately.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;B...but I....&quot; You stammered then Reese shouted,&quot;No time! Sorry, but I&#39;ll have to explain more inside, starting with how you got accepted here. I have to get out there now before any of the human keepers see me, and I suggest that you do the same.&quot; You paused when you heard this and watched Reese kick his clothes to the side next to a locker, and he ran off into the enclosure.<br />
<br />
Under the pressure of the situation you decided to do the same as him, taking off your uniform then your top and your panties and kicking them aside for the time being until you came back. You then ran into the enclosure too and Reese closed the door behind you then placed his keys behind a nearby bush.<br />
<br />
Reese then took a deep breath and sighed then said&quot;Whew! We made it in time. You must have so many questions for me, and I know that I have questions for you. But I should probably give you some keys in case I’m not available. But now, where should we start first?&quot;</p>
