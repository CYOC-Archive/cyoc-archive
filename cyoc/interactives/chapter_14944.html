<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty lay there, thinking about all that he had experienced that afternoon. Could he really have the power to alter people’s physical bodies? Did he really change Dustin permanently and reverse his age? He remembered watching Dustin’s body hair vanish and his size diminish to that of a thirteen year old. Could he effect changes in himself too?<br />
<br />
Ty had always been envious of many of the guys in his class at school. Even though they were the same age as he was, many of them had already started to develop as puberty came to them. Ty had hit puberty, as his voice had broken and he had some pubic hair, but he still looked rather undeveloped, especially compared to some of them. Even compared to Dustin, Ty looked quite undeveloped and immature. He always envied the other guys’ being more mature than them. As he thought on these things, he wondered that, if he had some power over Dustin and altered his body to that of a thirteen year old, he could do something to himself to alter his body to the way he should have liked it to have been now. Could he just do this though by only thinking about it?<br />
<br />
Another thought was passing through his mind; if he’d been given this power, then he’d have to be extremely careful when he used it as, like with Dustin, he could make changes just by thinking about it. He knew that he had to be cautious. If he could do such things, then, in a moment of anger, he might hurt somebody. Although Ty always felt very bad about some of the things that Dustin and his parents did and said to him, he would have felt devastated if he’d in some way, through his anger, hurt them in any way.<br />
<br />
Turning his thoughts back to himself though, he thought just how he’d like his body to be. He’d love to have hairy legs and to look taller and more muscular. Suddenly, he felt like there was something rubbing against his legs under the bed clothes. He usually slept naked so it couldn’t have been pyjamas rubbing his legs. This tickling sensation continued for some moments and Ty threw of the bed clothes; to his utter astonishment, he saw that his legs, instead of being smooth were now covered in thick, black hair. “It works! It works for me too!” Ty almost shouted to himself in his amazement. As he leant forward to feel his new body hair, he felt so much more muscular and developed. He could actually feel that when he moved, his muscles felt larger and bulkier.<br />
<br />
“So, I can change myself too” he thought to himself. “This is amazing, totally amazing!”. He couldn’t help thinking that he’d love to look like some massive bodybuilder, like he’d seen in pictures. He’d always been attracted to pictures of huge muscular guys ever since he’d picked up and old, discarded muscle magazine. As quick as he thought this, his body began to tingle and to change. Muscle piled on muscle as, before his very eyes, he became a huge bodybuilder, just like one of the guys in the magazine! “If only Dustin could see me know” Ty thought! “He’d soon stop bullying and teasing me”. All at once, there was Dustin, standing in front of Ty’s bed.<br />
<br />
“Hey, how did I get here?” Dustin shouted. Then, he saw Ty, lying there on the bed. He saw just how muscular and hairy Ty had become in a matter of hours since he last saw him, naked in the shower. “How did you get like THAT?” Dustin exclaimed! “Are you some sort of freak?” Ty looked at his step brother and said “I just thought it, and it happened! Just like when you were teasing me in the shower this afternoon, I thought that I’d like you to know what it feels like to be physically immature for your age like I am and then you began to change. It was me, though I don’t know how I did it!”<br />
<br />
Dustin looked confused, but then confusion turned to fear. “If Ty has this power, then perhaps he could do something to harm me” he thought. As if in answer to this thought, Ty said “I’m willing to forget everything that’s gone on between us provided that you stop bullying me. I’d rather have you as a friend than as an enemy.” Dustin thought about all the times when he and his friends had picked on and bullied Ty at school, on the bus, outside in the street. Ty stood up, and walked towards Dustin. Dustin now felt as though he was even smaller and more like a little boy next to the vast, muscular bulk of Ty who now stood over him. “I could have complete power over you” said Ty “to alter you in any way possible. Like this….”<br />
Ty had just thought what it would be like if Dustin was even smaller than he was now. As he thought this, Dustin began to shrink in size until he was about two foot tall. “What are you doing to me?” Dustin cried, “Are you going to hurt me? Please don’t hurt me!” Ty now towered above him, looking down on this puny boy. “You rat” Ty exclaimed, “Remember all the times…..” Ty broke off; as he watched, Dustin began slowly to change. He was changing into a rat before his very eyes! It was all over in a matter of seconds. Dustin didn’t really know a thing about it, apart from the fear which he felt as the massive bulk of Ty bent down to pick him up, now transformed into a large white rat.<br />
<br />
Ty realised again what he’d been thinking about before about how his anger might harm someone. As he thought, Dustin turned back into his human shape again, but still only two feet high. He was trembling and his knees were knocking together with fear. “I’ll do anything, ANYTHING if only you’ll not hurt me!” he shouted out to Ty. “I know you have the power over me and that you could squash me like a fly” Ty thought quickly and put out of his mind the notion of turning Dustin into a fly and squashing him. “I promise I’ll not do anything to bully or humiliate you again.” Ty looked at him, somewhat jubiously. “Do you sincerely promise that, or do I have to FORCE you never to do it? You know that I could”. Still quaking with fear, Dustin promised Ty that he wouldn’t ever bully him again. Ty thought that he sounded genuine enough, but he still needed some more convincing. “Ok, I’ll believe you” he said, “but I need to do something that’ll remind you of that promise you made.”<br />
<br />
Dustin said “Ok Ty, if I break my promise, you can turn me back to the way I look now. But will you please turn me back to the way I SHOULD be?” Again, Ty looked at Dustin, who was still only two feet tall, shaking with fear next to Ty, the world class bodybuilder at the age of fifteen! “Ok Dustin.” As soon as Ty said that, Dustin became what he had become before the encounter in the shower. The hair returned to his body, his size returned to its normal, muscular shape and his age was now back at sixteen.  But one thing didn’t change, his dick and balls. Ty had kept those at the size they were before Dustin had started puberty. “Your dick and balls will stay like that for the first six months from now on. When that time is up, they’ll then turn back to the way they should be. That should remind you of your promise.” Dustin wanted to say something to object to this but Ty had already sensed what he was going to say. Before Dustin said anything, Ty said “You know I could let your cock and balls stay like that for ever, or even remove them completely, so take it or leave it” Dustin thought better of what he was going to say and remained silent.<br />
<br />
“I think it’s about time you went back to bed now and if you even breathe a word to ANYONE about what you’ve seen tonight, you  know what to expect!” Dustin just nodded his head in agreement. “And perhaps” Ty continued “when the six months is up and you’ve learned a little bit of respect and humility……” At this point Ty started to think himself even taller than he was; he grew to seven feet tall and his huge muscular frame increased in proportion. “we might have ourselves a little bit of fun together” Dustin, still overwhelmed at what he was witnessing could only murmur a rather puny “Yes, ok.” At that point, Dustin faded away from sight, back to his room.<br />
<br />
Ty, now on his own could hardly contain his excitement! His powers were awesome. He could be or do almost anything. The world lay at his feet. As he lay there thinking of all the fun that he was about to have, he changed himself back to his normal self  (except for his hairy legs of course!) in order that he could actually fit in his bed. He fell into a deep, contented sleep.</p>
