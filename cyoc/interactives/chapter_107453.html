<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Not surprisingly, Sarah wanted to go see Abby right away. While Mary Alice was interested in seeing Abigail as a horse, her mouth felt really dry. She didn&#39;t have nearly enough water to drink before the virus in it changed her. &quot;You go on ahead. I&#39;m going to get something to drink,&quot; she said to Sarah.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just don&#39;t drink any water,&quot; said Sarah before she headed off. Mary Alice just shrugged before walking towards the barn. There ought to be something to drink in there.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
After looking around in the barn, Mary Alice was rather annoyed to find that the only thing in there to drink was tap water. She wasn&#39;t just a dumb dog anymore. If she was going to drink water, it would be from a bottle. In retrospect, she should have gone to the house for a drink, but old habits were hard to kill, even with a vastly increased intellect.<br />
<br />
Just as M.A. was about to leave the barn, she heard some low female moaning. She paused as she also picked up a scent that was musky but not like anything she smelled before. She walked quietly towards one of the stalls and peeped inside. Standing inside the stall where two bovine women. They were larger than anyone M.A. had ever seen, easily standing heads over humans, not counting their horns. They were also incredibly muscular, built like tanks with incredibly large muscles. And yet, their female figures were not grossly overshadowed by their muscles. That was part of the reason they were moaning right now: both of them had their breasts, each easily as large as a human&#39;s head, exposed and there was a milk pump covering their nipples. Considering there were three sealed milk canisters near the machine and one that was at least halfway full connected, the two cows had been producing quite a lot of milk. M.A. watched with fascination as the milk was siphoned out and poured into the canister. It aggrevated her thirst quite a bit to hear the milk filling up.<br />
<br />
When the canister filled, one of the cows shut off the machine and said, &quot;I think that&#39;s enough for now. I wish we didn&#39;t have to be producing so much milk. We weren&#39;t even bred to be dairy cows.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, they can hardly make hamburgers out of us,&quot; said the other cow as she removed the milkers from her nipples and covered up her breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still, it seems like a waste to make all this milk and not have anyone drink it,&quot; said the first cow as she got her top on, &quot;We could probably make a fortune selling this milk if it weren&#39;t so heavily infested with the virus. We can&#39;t even let the young ones drink it or it&#39;d make them mature too fast.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The humans will figure out how to pasteurize it enough to be safe,&quot; said the second cow, &quot;There are worse viruses you can get from milk. This one just happens to be stronger than average.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At least it&#39;s easy for us to get rid of our milk,&quot; said the first cow, &quot;Those hens have a worse time finding uses for those big eggs they lay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think the Edict about not eating other uplifted animals counts for unfertilized eggs?&quot; asked the second cow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not sure, not that it&#39;s my business or interest. Who would want to eat eggs anyways?&quot; asked the first cow with disgust.<br />
<br />
&quot;The pigs certainly won&#39;t have to be made into bacon now,&quot; said the second cow, &quot;Now they&#39;ll have to find something productive to do with themselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary Alice listened with great attention as the bovine women talked before they eventually left their stalls. Mary Alice hid behind some hay bales and waited for the cows to leave the barn. Once they were gone, Mary Alice walked into the stall. The milk canisters were still there, waiting to either be taken to a refrigerator or to be dumped. She agreed with the cows that it was a shame for this milk to go to waste. So what if it had the virus in them? All it did was make animals healthier. In fact, Mary Alice wouldn&#39;t mind being as healthy as those muscular cattle herself.<br />
<br />
She carefully detached the canister that was attached to the milking machine. She sniffed the open top with interest. It just smelled so good to her, how could anyone pass this up. She licked her lips before lapping up some of the milk. It tasted amazing, not as sweet as the milk that was sometimes put in a bowl for her, but it had a bolder flavor that appealed to her thirst. Eventually, she tilted the canister forward a little, drinking up the milk the way a human would do.<br />
<br />
Mary Alice was so engrossed in drinking the milk that she barely paid attention as her body started to grow. The husky girl&#39;s height was the first notable change, her body stretching upwards. The clothes she had borrowed from Sarah soon started covering less than they ought to. They were strained even more as M.A. started racing to the other side of puberty. As a dog, she wasn&#39;t fully grown and it showed when she first changed by making her body like that of a young teenager. But now her body was blossoming rapidly, her hips and ass expanding widely and making her pants even tighter. M.A. drank more milk, some of it spilling over the sides of her mouth and splashing her shirt, which was getting awfully tight around her inflating breasts.<br />
<br />
Mary Alice struggled with the milk canister because of its weight. But as she drank more milk, it became lighter. It also became easier to hold because her muscles were also growing. The tone of her muscles became noticeable through her black and white fur before they really started expanding. The biceps and triceps of her arms became larger, allowing her to lift the canister higher. Her exposed belly hardened into a solid 6-pack while her legs became thick with muscles and yet still curvy and luscious. Her shirt strained even harder as her shoulders widened and her large pectorals pushed her ballooning breasts even further forward. Milk had drenched her top pretty thoroughly, allowing her nipples to be easily seen, even though she was wearing a bra which was obviously the wrong size now. With a grunt of frustration, Mary Alice reached up with one hand and grabbed the shirt before pulling. The wet fabric easily gave way, ripping apart to reveal her muscular body and and large breasts. She then focused on drinking the rest of the milk even as her pants started to rip apart. As soon as the canister was empty, M.A. dropped it before grabbing her pants and yanking hard. The pants split apart rather easily, leaving her naked as she was before she first drank the infected water.<br />
<br />
Mary Alice was now an anthropomorphic husky of very considerable stature. She had been the equivalent of a young teenager with a slight figure, but now she was clearly a woman with a strong amazonian build. She wasn&#39;t nearly as large as the cows were, in height, muscle mass, or breast size. Still, she was probably at least in the middle class of bodybuilder muscles, a few inches taller than most human women, and had breasts that were more than a respectable size for any woman. M.A. reached up and felt her enhanced breasts. She moaned as the nipples stiffened. No wonder the cows were moaning as they were being milked. M.A. fingered her nipples for quite a while before she took a hand down to stimulate her pussy. She groaned as her arousal rose even higher. She panted heavily as she tweaked and rubbed, driving herself to the edge. It took effort to quietly moan instead of howl when she finally reached an orgasm, her pussy gushing with juices. However, that wasn&#39;t the only wet spot on her. Her nipples had started dripping their own milk and tasting a little showed it was just as appealing as the cows&#39; milk.<br />
<br />
Mary Alice looked at her enhanced body with satisfaction. No, Mary Alice sounded too formal, too long. Malice seemed a better name for a large muscular husky woman. She used to be called that when she was being bad, but now it made her feel good. Speaking of feeling good, Malice wondered if perhaps Sarah would like to feel this invigorated as well. There were three other canisters of cow milk with enough Animalia Virus in them to easily make Sarah into a mighty bovine. Or perhaps Malice could see if her own milk was just as potent.</p>
