<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I was given permission to try on this $25,000 costume at home before making any final purchases. I merely had to pay a security deposit of $300. <br />
<br />
A $25,000 costume! It really WAS a wonderful work of art, and hand-constructed of the finest of materials. There had to be at least 75 lbs worth of material here! <br />
<br />
When I got home, I opened the package and started pulling the costume out. It kept coming. And coming. There was more and more material than I remembered! It was a lot bulkier, thicker, and more dense than it was at the shop! <br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell?&quot; I said aloud as I continued pulling the thing out from the hind legs, before finally the front legs came flopping out. The head piece flopping out after it as well. A white envelope was left inside the empty box.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy hell!&quot; I breathed, as I pulled the entire thing taut. <br />
<br />
There in the middle of my living room floor was this THING! A perfect replica of a very recently deceased and flattened animal! The head was the ugliest donkey mask you would ever see. It&#39;s big fat black lips curled back in a sneer, revealing huge blocky yellowed teeth outlined in black. The teeth were so disgusting and scuzzy looking, you could almost sense how they would smell! <br />
<br />
And the PENIS! Holy Christ, was the donkey dick the largest, scariest-looking floppy one-year alien monster in existence! The balls hanging low and very dense and heavy. I poked it with my tie, and how they wobbled! <br />
<br />
I was getting a hardon to try this thing on, but first I was curious as to what was in that envelope. I bent down, picked it, and opened it. Inside was a nicely folded piece of really nice stock. Opening it, was a letter with an embossed letterhead at the top, of the costume shop from which I purchased this ridiculously realistic costume. It contained a nicely printed letter in a clean and pleasant typeface. Fancy! <br />
<br />
The letter read:<br />
<br />
&quot;Congratulations on your new purchase, dear Michael.....&quot;<br />
<br />
They knew my name? <br />
<br />
&quot;You would do well to carefully heed these instructions,&quot; it continued. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is a very carefully crafted item that contains some powerful magic. Don this costume with careful consideration. It is highly recommended you try it on without clothing, and you do so outside. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is meant for a trial run only, unless you have made a purchase in full. <br />
<br />
&quot;The magic of this costume will turn your entire physiology inside the costume into that of the very donkey skin you try on. Plan accordingly, for you will be stuck for 24 hours as this very specific donkey. <br />
<br />
&quot;After your agreed-upon 24 hour trial, you will be asked to either make the $25,000 purchase in full, or return it to the shop. <br />
<br />
&quot;Should you purchase the costume outright, it becomes legally and rightfully your property. You may wear it as many times and as long as you wish with limit. <br />
<br />
&quot;However, if you violate the terms of agreement by putting it on a second time before returning the costume, purchasing it, or renewing a new agreement, harsh consequences will be imposed. Heed this warning!&quot;<br />
<br />
I chuckled. &quot;Magic costume,&quot; I said under my breath. As if magic were real. <br />
<br />
I laid the letter aside as I looked at the thing lying on my floor. God, it was so realistic! I felt the fur, which felt tougher, more like real actual animal fur, than it did yesterday! And.... Was there a warmth to it! <br />
<br />
I saw a seam down it&#39;s belly, and lifted from the heavy, bulky side. The seam separated as a flap, revealing the inside of this strange costume. That must be how you get inside. <br />
<br />
Well! I was getting excited and a little bit horny to try this thing on!<br />
<br />
&quot;Strip naked, huh?&quot; I said lightly under my breath, thinking about that letter. Which I did. <br />
<br />
The letter also said to try it on outside. Well. Fuck that! I wasn&#39;t stepping out my door fully nude! Although....what if this actually WAS magic...? I thought nervously. I wouldn&#39;t want to actually BE a donkey, despite my innermost yearnings to actually try it once. Sure, it was fun to fetishize about what it might be like. But in the end, I always knew it probably would be extremely unpleasant. Especially the parts about having hard hooves in place of hands, and being stuck to all fours! God, how limiting life would be! Unable to do even the most basic of tasks, such as scrubbing yourself clean, or even &quot;rubbing one out,&quot; as the polite way of saying &quot;masturbate &quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nah!&quot; I said with a little bit of a chuckle. &quot;Of course it can&#39;t actually turn you into a donkey! That letter was it just to set some kind of mood!&quot; <br />
<br />
Well, taking a deep breath, I bent over to open the flap. I had to go down on my knees to shove one foot inside. The damned thing was far too heavy and awkward to fully lift up over myself. I was just much easier to slide both legs in backwards from a kneeling position on all fours. <br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t hard to find the leg holes for each leg. Strangely enough, I felt almost like my legs &quot;attached&quot; to something once I felt my feet squeeze inside the restrictive hooves. <br />
<br />
Going down onto my elbows, I shoved my ass inside. Twisting and turning, I got more and more of my body inside this skin suit, until my shoulders were finally in. It was just a matter of slipping my arms and head, which I was able to readily do. I found the holes for the front legs, which were entirely too long for my arms. Until...I felt a weird sense of &quot;pulling&quot; of &quot;stretching&quot; sensation. Same with my dick! And my spinal column! <br />
<br />
I started to feel hot and sweaty! The cost.e started feeling.....WARM! And....HUMID! <br />
<br />
&quot;UH...&quot; I breathe heavily, feeling more and more confined. &quot;Uh, ok! I....I need out...&quot; <br />
<br />
I tried reaching from inside the costume to find the opening, but... I....I couldn&#39;t! I felt ... A....BLOATING! My head became entrapped inside the neck, which was rapidly closing all about my head! My....my HEAD! And my neck! Both stretching and pulling! My ARMS! And worse of all, I couldn&#39;t feel my HANDS! Like. At all! <br />
<br />
All of this happening simultaneously as my face FINALLY found the donkey&#39;s head mask, just as I finally found my footing. It was a strange sensation as the inside of the mask stuck to my face. And even worse, then it seemed to suck into my mouth, and somehow down my throat! I started gagging on a strange hoarse sort of way, just as my tongue entered the inside of the costume&#39;s tongue hole, and my teeth into the teeth holes! I felt my face stretch way out, impossibly far and impossibly wide! My vision seemed to shift in a strange and inexplicable manner. I felt my nose flare, followed by the most god awful rotten taste in my mouth, with an ear-splitting &quot;HAAAAAAAWWWWWW!!!&quot; <br />
<br />
Then the discomfort of being trapped suddenly stopped, and it no longer felt like I was stuck inside of a costume. But.... I still felt....WRONG! Bloated! With a god awful stench all-around me!<br />
<br />
I started to try to stand up, until I realized..... I WAS standing up! On.... My heart sinking.....on.....all fours!</p>
