<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Jeb&quot; stood there. Wheezing, as it began to sink into the former Mike&#39;s mind of what being stuck as a farm animal meant. He had no idea what was in store for him in the near future. He just pondered his inability to speak and being unable to do anything usefully humanlike with this body. The greatest restriction, of course, was having no hands. <br />
<br />
His ponderings were making him hard again, as his dick was really the most natural outlet for his frustrations.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haaaaaaaawwwww....&quot; He let out a long mournful bray that was meant as a sigh. His thoughts turned to the disgusting gag-inducing thought of being stuck with the snot and saliva of the donkey that had just vacated this body. <br />
<br />
&quot;Haaaww!&quot; He breathed out. &quot;heeee haaww. Heee hhaaww. Heee hhaaww!!&quot; He wanted to &quot;get away&quot; from his own mouth and nose. <br />
<br />
&quot;In not a donkey!&quot; He was thinking. Stomped his right front hoof in frustration, as he looked around the donkey body he was attached to and could feel. <br />
<br />
He got scared all over again, as his mind was crying that he wasn&#39;t a donkey! That he can&#39;t be a donkey! His dick growing and growing out of frustration. But all of his senses kept telling him that was exactly what he was now. A donkey! <br />
<br />
But still, he kept thinking to himself, closing his eyes. Trying to &quot;feel&quot; his human form again:<br />
<br />
&quot;I am not a donkey! I am not a donkey! I am not a donkey!&quot; Periodically letting out a donkey bray. <br />
<br />
Even with this repeated mantra, he couldn&#39;t convince himself entirely that he wasn&#39;t a donkey. In order to prove it to himself, he took a deep breath. He was gonna take a peak at the body he was occupying. He felt a butterfly nervous feeling creep up into his large round equine stomach, knowing full well what was going to greet his vision. Sure enough, all he saw was the very body he could feel entirely as his own now!<br />
<br />
&quot;Heeee hhhaawww!!&quot; He brayed, &quot; nooooo!!&quot; He thought. &quot;I can&#39;t....I can&#39;t be...!&quot; He looked down at his front legs and hooves. The reality was surreal. He slowly lifted a large heavy blocky hoof that he could never do anything with other than stand and walk upon it. He set it down with a heavy &quot;CLOP!&quot; <br />
<br />
Next, he saw and FELT his huge black hardening cock. A giant one-eyed monster with a giant hole on the end of the most alien, animalistic, flared cockhead he&#39;d ever seen. The huge black rubbery balls, the way they hovered and wobbled in an evil sort of way. That equipment was his now! And worse, he could FEEL it as his! <br />
<br />
Same with the tail whipping in and out of view. He could FEEL it back there! He could feel the big tall broad ears on the top of his head, swivelling back and forth mostly of their own accord! <br />
<br />
&quot;Heee hhhaawww, heee hhaaww hee hhaaww!&quot; He started braying again. Trying to talk! &quot;Heee hhaaww heee hhaaww heee hhaaww!!&quot; He went on. And on. And on. Trying to speak. Trying to deny his new species. Until he started to go hoarse as he stood there braying for quite a while.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eeerghh hhaaww errghh hhaaww!&quot; <br />
<br />
But it was no use. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn&#39;t talk! Even slamming his inherited hooves on the ground in frustration. His male member sticking out, as hard and as long as a metal flag pole. That became overwhelmingly distractive. . <br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t grab that thing. Not without hands, which only made things worse as it made his lack of hands even more frustrating. Which only drove him to grow his erection even harder yet. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hee hhaaww heee hhaaww heee hhaaww,&quot; he was breathing, as he kept making halfhearted attempts to grab that weiner. His giant black balls were churning. He could FEEL them tingling! Full of donkey DNA!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god, please!&quot; he was thinking. He realized it was useless. The only way to &quot;get off&quot; was either to mount another donkey....or a horse.....or any farm animal would do, really....or get down to the floor and just....kind of...hump it! <br />
<br />
He was resisting the idea of using that dick altogether, when he heard a door open up again. He fiercely looked up at it, and saw the man that had done this to him walk in. This time a new emotion came to him other than just fright and shock:<br />
<br />
Anger! He was about to charge his ass ...as an ass  himself, no less! But he brought in another donkey, and walked it between himself and the agitated male male donkey still stuck inside the greenhouse that needed to be broken. Again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Again,&quot; because to the farmer, this would be the second time he&#39;d have to break this particular animal. Dismissing the fact that the being stuck inside it&#39;s head was a human teenager just a little while ago. The farmer had already decided to treat this animal exactly as he&#39;s always treated it; as a donkey on his farm, regardless of the fact that it contained a brand new consciousness. So to the farmer, breaking him &quot;again&quot; was the word choice. <br />
<br />
Anyway, he brought in a female donkey already in heat to bring down the rutting male donkey to a more manageable level. He knew there was no stopping a jackass&#39;s iron-will to please that potent &quot;itch.&quot; A donkey&#39;s hormones were a thousand times stronger and more potent than a human&#39;s.</p>
