<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thinking about her decision, Janet decided she wanted to go back to her childhood days. Back when she could live a simple life...and maybe, just maybe, act like a princess! No matter what though, she&#39;d be a happy, kind, and energetic young girl with lots of friends!  Focusing on the amulet, she envisioned herself as a young and carefree princess.  As soon as she envisioned that, her amulet started to glow.<br />
<br />
At first, Janet was confused, and wasn&#39;t sure if, despite the shining light, anything happened.  “Why isn’t this working?” she asked in a confused look, “That old man did say that it would happen once I envision myself as a different person.  I hope this was no trick.”  As she thought about that, she didn’t notice her body starting to change.  She had become slightly shorter, and her hair became slightly brighter. Her stockings and skirt began to lighten up in color. Still, she wasn&#39;t sure if it had worked just yet...<br />
<br />
Suddenly, she noticed that the room was getting a little larger then before.  She could’ve sworn that the mirror looked bigger then before.  “Strange…” Janet said in curiosity, “I could’ve sworn that the mirror wasn’t that larger before.  I wonder if it’s actually working?”  While Janet was unsure earlier, now it was clear she was changing. She shrunk down significantly, and her hair began to brighten. Meanwhile, so did her clothes, as her red shirt became pink, and her stockings and skirt changed to gray. It felt weird being this young again...but it wasn&#39;t like it felt bad.<br />
<br />
Janet&#39;s changes continued, as she became even shorter than before. Upon opening her eyes, she saw they were now a brilliant (and adorable?) green. Her skirt changed shape, becoming frilly and pink rather than it&#39;s old plain form. Her stockings became red. She began to feel more...cheerful? Her knowledge from high school was fading away as well as her childhood memories were growing stronger in her mind.  Staring at herself, she said, “Wow!  It really is working!  I look younger, cuter, prettier.  This is perfect!”<br />
<br />
Janet became even shorter than before, now appearing quite young. Her stockings became pink, making her princess costume even prettier! Her hair became restyled into big curls. They were so pretty! Did her mother do this for her?  She doesn’t remember it.  But looking at herself, she could tell that it was natural to have curls on her hair.  It’s quite fitting for a princess her age.  Wait, was she really is a princess?  Her memories were getting jumbled up, it was confusing for her.<br />
<br />
She had grown even shorter and was now looking like a child as her womanly attributes nearly faded away completely.  Janet’s outfit was getting prettier as well and it look like she was a young princess.  All pink and beautiful.  She loved it!  Her hair became a brighter blonde, and more of those beautiful curls appeared in her hair. Mommy totally made them for her, and she loved looking so pretty! Meanwhile, her dress became more fancy and cute! All that was missing was her crown, and then she&#39;d be ready! It was gonna be so much fun!<br />
<br />
Janet became younger one last time. She now wore an adorable little crown on her head. She loved princesses so much! Mommy always helped her dress up as one, especially for parties and stuff. She was the happiest little girl in town! Everything was so much fun! Perhaps Janet would be happiest as this princess loving little girl?<br />
<br />
When her changes finished, the world around her began to alter around her as the modernize house started to go back to something more renaissance.  Looking around, she could see that her room changed into a princess quarters with a fancy bed, wooden elegant drawers, a fancy tapestry on the floor, and a lighted chandelier on the dome like ceiling.  Looking around, she wondered where she was.  Looking to the open hold window, she saw a small village in medieval times with big mountain ranges in the background.  With eyes in shock, she could tell that her vision of being a little princess took it to another level.  “Huh…  Guess I went a little overboard of my image as a childish princess.”<br />
<br />
Her memories finished altering and she remembers her new life.  She knows that she’s born from loyalty as her mom and dad are the king and queen of Dollwood and her brother is the prince.  She also realized that she has a new name as well, Princess Jennifer of Dolwood.  This princess was even going to rule the land and would be loved and worshiped when she grows up.  A perfect life for a pretty princess.  Janet, now Jennifer, realized that her life would be wonderful as a princess, even if it wasn’t what she had envisioned.  But now that she got her new life, what would she do now?</p>
