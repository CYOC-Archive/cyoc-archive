<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Of course such a creature as this man was nothing natural, he&#39;s simply to freakish and to sexy for anything other than the hands of man to create. Unknown to the public, the government had for decades been performing hundreds of secret experiments to create better, stronger humans. To give people greater strength, endurance, intelligence and skill in the hopes that improving the populace as a whole would in turn improve the country and make it better able to defend, and more importantly attack. Unfortunately, it never worked to the degree they had hoped.<br />
<br />
Make no mistake, the project had more than a few successes, but never to the degree the government wanted, and with more failures than the wished for either. With the project on its last legs the head researcher proposed an insane idea &quot;...but sir, we know nothing of this substances properties, if its safe, or...&quot; one of the scientists voiced his concerns but &quot;Yes we do know at least some of its properties, lest we forget my own body.&quot; the head researcher interrupted, flexing his muscle hard enough to tear his clothes.<br />
<br />
The strange substance they were talking about was a liquid found in the crash site of a meteor and indeed the head researchers own body was an example of the possible uses of it. Upon finding the crash site the scientists, researchers, and army men all wore hazmate suits, but a tear in one left one Gregory Jasp to be exposed to its vapors, causing him to rapidly grow, his muscles were obscenely large, his strength surpassed anything in recorded history and even his skin became bullet proof &quot;I-I won&#39;t deny that the rabid changes your body went through are every thing we have been working towards, but we don&#39;t enough data on the side-effects, well except for one at least.&quot; the researcher replied, blushing somewhat as an accidental look at Gregory&#39;s crotch reminded him of what was no longer there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I don&#39;t think the government wants a bunch of dickless super men, and even if they didn&#39;t care the soldiers probably would.&quot; another scientist stated, half jokingly half serious &quot;Well, I may have a vagina instead of a penis, but I am no less of a man as I used to be, in fact I am obviously much more of one.&quot; Gregory stated with another flex &quot;Besides that the project has only one shot left, and even ignoring that we can&#39;t pass up this opportunity. We could be on the verge of a breakthrough.&quot; &quot;But injecting it into a soldier, if this happened to you from just the vapors, than surely we could just do the same.&quot; Another responded &quot;It&#39;s going to happen regardless of what we do.&quot; Gregory replied &quot;What do you mean.&quot; &quot;Think of it this way, we do the vapor test it either fails and the project is disbanded, or it succeeds and they ask &quot;Why not inject into him, wouldn&#39;t that lead to better results?&quot; Then we either do what they say, or we don&#39;t the government disbands the project, and forms a new one and does it anyways, but this time without us, and possibly in a less safe environment. Truth is that I&#39;m really just saving us time, plus making sure we all get the credit we deserve.&quot;<br />
<br />
His speech finished Gregory flexed again and as everyone began talking it over with each other &quot;Okay Dr. Jasp&quot; one researcher replied &quot;But I do have to ask you one thing before we begin.&quot; &quot;And what would that be?&quot; Gregory asked with a flex &quot;Could you stop flexing your muscles all the time, its a bit unnecessary, not to mention unprofessional.&quot; the researcher finished. Gregory smiled and said &quot;Come on, if you had muscles like these, wouldn&#39;t you want to show them off.&quot;<br />
<br />
A few days latter various heads of state, generals, and other important figures were gathered in front of testing chamber, protected from any ill effects by ten inches of bullet proof glass. In the testing chamber, two men stood, the soldier Hank Remus and a researcher protected by a hazmat suit Nick Franz. Skipping to the good part, Nick to the syringe filled with a strange silver liquid, and injected into Hanks veins. For a few moments everyone held their breaths in anticipation, and that&#39;s all the time it took before Hanks changes commenced. Unlike Gregory, Hanks muscles actually shrank disappointing the gathered officials, that is until Hank broke out of his restraints as if they weren&#39;t even there. Though his muscles were gone, his strength had still grown immeasurably but it didn&#39;t stop there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amazing, he looks like a twig but he&#39;s stronger than an ox.&quot; one of the generals said, &quot;I just he doesn&#39;t end up a trany like this one.&quot; another stated, leaving the room in a mix of anger and second hand embaresment at the bigoted statement. It was then that Hank began moaning, as his body went through further changes, his butt grew larger, as did his cock, all the hair on his body save his head fell off, as his maleness tore through his pants. As the tattered remains of his trousers fell to the floor and he began to willingly take off his shirt and tease his engorged nipples, his ass hole grew massive and a noxious green fart escaped his rear end.<br />
<br />
Almost instantly the gas filled the test chamber, and as Hank began masturbaiting Nicks hazmat suit started melting and his own body changed. His cock grew massive ten feet and rigid filth fuck meat, attached to a hair muscled body, that shat out tree trunk sized logs of shit. Inside the observation booth a mixture of panic and disgust filled the views minds, all save Gregory whom smiled evily at the sight before him &quot;You-you knew this would happen&quot; someone proclaimed as he gripped Gregory&#39;s shirt &quot;you wanted this you freak.&quot; He finished.<br />
<br />
Before Gregory could even reply the gas entered the observation booth, not by cracking or breaking the glass, but by phasing through the now green tented pane as though it didn&#39;t exist in the first place. Everyone within immediately began to change, one woman moaned as a massive cock jutted out from her pussy, one of the generals gained massive breasts as his voice and face became more feminine, while one of the researchers who was secretly a furry found fur growing all over his body as slowly shifted into the horny shitting wolf man he always secretly wanted to be.<br />
<br />
It only took a few hours before the entire test facility was converted, not just people and animals, but even the objects computers. Every lamp was phalic, every toilet became fountains of filth, and every computer was choc full of porn of every type. From there we eventual get to the present day, with one Nick Franz watching as his farts convert a nursery into a brothel filled with little children flaunting their oversized assets in the hopes of hot sex. He and everyone else from the test sight were happy to convert the entire world into a perverse paradise.</p>
