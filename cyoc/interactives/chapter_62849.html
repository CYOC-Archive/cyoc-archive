<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Paul was twenty-one and lived in an apartment by himself. If Kat's parents had known about Paul they would not have approved but Kat had <br />
always been clever about keeping her parents in the dark, especially now that she had magic and had cast a spell making everyone believe that <br />
her dad and her brother Dan were dogs. Even her mother didn't think it strange that her husband and son disappeared about the same time as <br />
Kat got two dogs.<br />
<br />
Paul lived in a tiny apartment. He couldn't afford much. But he wanted the freedom to be away from his parents. He wasn't that attractive or <br />
popular either. He was selfish, a slob, and a jerk. So he appreciated that Kat seemed to like him although he knew that Kat was using him just a <br />
little.<br />
<br />
He walked to the local convenience store for some beer but as soon as he walked in the door, the guy behind the counter got upset and yelled. <br />
&quot;Hey, get out of here. Dogs aren't allowed in the store. Shoo. Get out of here you dumb dog.&quot; As the cashier continued yelling, he approached <br />
Paul in an aggressive manner as if he was shooing Paul out of the store.<br />
<br />
Paul asked, &quot;Who you talking to? I don't see a dog.&quot;<br />
<br />
The cashier said, &quot;Take it easy, puppy. I'm not trying to hurt you. Just trying to get you outside. Would someone help me.&quot;<br />
<br />
A girl came up and said, &quot;Aw, he's such a nice doggy.&quot; She sweet talked her way to Paul and began patting his head. She ran her fingers through <br />
his hair as she said, &quot;Come on, puppy. You don't want to be in here anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul let himself be lead outside by the girl and the girl stayed outside with him for a while petting him. He tried to kiss her but she said, &quot;Down <br />
boy. I like dogs but I don't like being licked.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul was beginning to think she liked him and was playing a game but then she went back into the store and closed the door. The cashier <br />
stood near the door barring him from entering.<br />
<br />
Paul barked, &quot;Well I guess I can get beer somewhere else.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul walked to the grocery store but had an even worse situation there. Several employees were called to chase Paul up and down the aisles <br />
until they caught him and dragged him out of the store. Paul wondered why none of them understood what he was saying. Then he <br />
remembered Kat's family. Paul went home and called Kat immediately.<br />
<br />
Paul asked, &quot;Did you make it so everyone thinks I'm a dog?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat said, &quot;Not everyone. I did something special for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul asked, &quot;Why are you angry at me? What did I do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat said, &quot;I'm not angry at you. I'm just having some fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul asked, &quot;But how am I going to live if I can't talk to anyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat said, &quot;Don't worry about it. I worked the spell so that your landlord, your boss and anyone who needs to will still think of you as human. <br />
You'll still be able to keep your job and your apartment. You'll just need to be careful when you go out in public.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul asked, &quot;What if I need to buy groceries?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat said, &quot;If you need anyone to think of you as human that I haven't already worked the spell for, just call and let me know and I'll arrange it. <br />
By the way, I'd strongly recommend that you go get yourself registered with a collar and license as your own dog. Buy yourself some pet <br />
supplies too. You might find them necessary so people will know that you are your own pet dog and not just some stray. You wouldn't want <br />
the dog catchers to catch you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul asked, &quot;How am I supposed to do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat explained, &quot;I've already arranged that you can go to the Daimler Dog Training Academy. They also sell pet supplies and handle all pet <br />
needs. I'll be over later to play with your new doggy. Does that sound like fun?&quot;<br />
<br />
So Paul went to the Daimler Dog Training Academy and said, &quot;I need to register a dog.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man said, &quot;Right this way.&quot; and led Paul into a veterinary clinic.<br />
<br />
Paul asked, &quot;I just need to register the dog. I don't need a veterinary bill.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man said, &quot;We don't register animals unless they've had their vaccinations and updated medical records. Now if you'll put your dog up on <br />
the table.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul quickly called Kat, &quot;He wants to vaccinate me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat said, &quot;Just go along with it. It's all prepared.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul said, &quot;But I don't want to receive any shots.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat asked, &quot;When was the last time you saw a doctor?&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul said, &quot;Four years ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat said, &quot;Then your overdue. Now get yourself up on the table and let the vet do his job.&quot;<br />
<br />
Feeling very scared, Paul hung up and got up on the table.<br />
<br />
The vet said, &quot;Please remove your dog's clothes. I don't want any clothing getting in the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul hesitantly undressed. He worried since there were windows and open spaces all around making it easy for anyone to see in. But Paul <br />
figured that anyone who saw would think they were seeing a dog so Paul undressed completely.<br />
<br />
The vet did all the usual. Paul braced himself for the vaccination shots in his butt. The vet said, &quot;Hold your dog steady. We don't want him <br />
jumping.&quot; Then the vet felt Paul's balls. &quot;Do you want us to neuter him while we're here? It's free with the check up and vaccinations.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul said, &quot;No thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The vet said, &quot;Suit yourself. If you change your mind later, you'll have to pay for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then the vet was all done. He went to the computer and started typing in information asking questions of Paul. &quot;So what do you want to name <br />
your dog?&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul said, &quot;Let's call him Rufus.&quot;<br />
<br />
The vet continued registering Rufus. &quot;All done. We can create his tags here while you go in the store and purchase a collar.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul said, &quot;I need to buy some other stuff too. I don't have any pet supplies.&quot;<br />
<br />
The vet said, &quot;Take your time. I'd recommend you get formula H dog food. Based on my examination, your dog should be in a lot better health <br />
than he is. You also should take him running more often or out to the park to play fetch. You don't want him growing old too fast.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul walked over to buy pet supplies. His mind was still coming to grips with the fact that he was naked in public and that it was okay because <br />
everyone saw him as a dog, and yet he could talk with the employees and they all still spoke with him as if he was human. Paul bought a collar <br />
and with recommendations from the employees, he also bought a leash, a dog bed, a dog house, dog food (formula H), and other supplies. <br />
With the games Kat was playing, he couldn't be sure that he wouldn't need this stuff. When he was done, the vet attached the tag to his collar <br />
and Paul put the collar on. Then he got dressed and went home.</p>
