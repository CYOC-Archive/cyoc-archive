<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amy pulled the car up to the iron gate and punched in the 6 digit code on the key pad and with the sound of a motor and banging of metal on metal the heavy gate rolled aside so  she could drive forward on the narrow lane.<br />
<br />
Stopping in front of what looked like a Beverly Hills mansion she sighed and turned off the car.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re here finally&quot; she said<br />
<br />
Eric looked in awe at the structure.  Two lion statues on either side of the paved brick walkway to a front door that had to be 12 feet tall.<br />
<br />
Amy opened her door, got out and opened the back hatch door.<br />
<br />
Eric followed, pausing to stretch before meeting his mother at the back of the car.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grab some bags, I&#39;ll go unlock the front door.&quot; Amy said, grabbing a tote to take with her.<br />
<br />
Eric leaned into the back of the SUV and grabbed the strap of a duffel bag.   It seemed stuck so he pulled harder and dragged it closer to the back bumper.  <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s yours, mine is the purple one over there&quot; she said pointing to another purple duffel near the back of the third seat.<br />
<br />
It was out of reach so Eric leaned in as far as he could.  On tip toes he was barely able to hook a finger around one of the handles.  He pulled but it wouldn&#39;t budge and caused him to lose his balance, crashing down hard on the rubber floor mat.  He let out a yelp and for a few moments lay there struggling to right himself in order to get his feet back onto the ground.<br />
<br />
Mia snickered as she watched Eric&#39;s stumpy legs flailing with his plump butt sticking up in the air.  She climbed back into the back seat and reached over and pushed the duffel further back so it would be easier to reach.<br />
<br />
Eric finally able to get his feet on the ground stood there angrily rubbing his sore chest and looked for a flip flop that had been flung off.<br />
<br />
Mia came back around to the back, picking up the flip flop and handed it to Eric.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks&quot; he said sarcastically and grabbed his bag.  He wasn&#39;t ready for the weight of it and fell downward, jerking itself from his grip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus, what did Mom pack?&quot; he said and hefted it up again and started walking quickly to the house.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about my bag?&quot; Mia asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get it yourself&quot; Eric yelled back, not stopping or looking around.  His heavy breasts wobbling madly.  He entered the foyer and dropped the heavy bag and stood there catching his breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Move!&quot; he heard a voice behind him say just before nearly being knocked over by Mia charging into the house.<br />
<br />
Mia dropped the duffel onto the cold tile floor and stood there catching her breath.  <br />
<br />
Amy came in from another room.  &quot;The guest rooms are down that hallway&quot;she said pointing to a massive corridor to the left.  &quot;Go ahead and take the first one on the right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean we have to share a room?&quot; Eric asked annoyed at having to share a room with his sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;The other guest rooms are full of furniture.  There are two beds and it has it&#39;s own bathroom.  You two can survive at little time together&quot;  Amy said.<br />
<br />
Mia hefted her bag and took off.  &quot;Dibs on the best bed&quot; she yelled.<br />
<br />
Eric rolled his eyes.  &quot;Nuh uh, I&#39;m the oldest I get first pick.&quot; he yelled at her but she was already gone.<br />
<br />
Amy walked over to Eric.  &quot;Just let her have it. Be the mature one.&quot; &quot;  She said and kissed him on the forehead.  <br />
<br />
Eric grunted as he lifted his bag and walked down the corridor to guest room.<br />
<br />
The room was quite large, with french door that opened out onto a deck that overlooked the lake.  Amy had claimed the bed nearest the outer door, so he hefted his bag up and onto the only other available bed near the inside door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure is a pretty cool view&quot; she said and walked out onto the deck with Mia.<br />
<br />
Eric rubbed his bicep and his forearm was burning.  &quot;What&#39;s in here?&quot; he thought and unzipped the bag expecting to find a lot more than he did.  &quot;It&#39;s just clothes...&quot; he muttered.  &quot;Am I that weak now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mia and Amy came back into the guest room.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to go into town and get some supplies.  Mia, you can go with me, there won&#39;t be a reason for both of you to go.  Eric, you can explore, don&#39;t break anything obviously.  There is some food in the kitchen, I&#39;ll get more and the TV is in the Great Room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do they have satellite?&quot; Eric asked  &quot; Want to watch the game&quot;.<br />
<br />
Amy shrugged her shoulders.  &quot;Good question, let us know what you find out.  Just stay inside till we get back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That won&#39;t be a problem&quot; Eric replied.  &quot;The fewer people that see me the better.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy and Mia walked out to the car.  &quot;Mia, go tell Eric to come and get this last bag.&quot;  Amy said.<br />
<br />
Mia ran back into the house, with her arm across her chest to stop the bouncing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eric...Mom needs you&quot; Mia yelled and ran back to the SUV.<br />
<br />
Eric walked out, clearly annoyed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take that last bag in...and please close the back hatch for me.&quot;  Amy said.<br />
<br />
Eric walked around the back and with some struggle was able to get the last bag, which thankfully wasn&#39;t too heavy.  Looking up he reached for the handle to pull down the door but it was several inches out of reach.  Stupidly he tried to jump and grab it.  Not only failing to do so but also causing considerable pain as the heavy breasts defied gravity for only a slight moment before crashing downward in a painful tug.<br />
<br />
Amy caught the struggle in her review mirror and felt guilty about putting Eric in that situation.  She got out of the car.  &quot;I&#39;ll get that Eric&quot;she said and reached up effortlessly and pulled it downward until it latched.<br />
<br />
Eric walked away red faced and got about 5 steps before he heard his Mom&#39;s voice.  &quot;Eric...the bag?&quot; she said calmly.<br />
<br />
Eric turned and stomped over to the grey bag and tried hoisting it up onto his shoulder, only to have it slip back down to the ground.<br />
<br />
Amy drove away, Mia still laughing at her bother&#39;s antics.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mia, you need to be kinder to Eric.&quot; Amy said sternly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry mommy.&quot; Mia said<br />
<br />
&quot;The main reason you are going with me is so I can buy some clothes for you two.  I brought some t shirts for you two to wear but, since you are both identical, you can try things on.  I&#39;m sure your brother wouldn&#39;t be very helpful I&#39;m afraid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s ok Mommy, I&#39;ll help you.&quot;  Mia said.<br />
<br />
&quot; I&#39;m thinking of shorts and sweats for Eric.  Would you like the same or would you like a dress to put on?&quot;  Amy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think sweats would be fine&quot; Mia said<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll also need to get you both some underwear&quot;  Amy said<br />
<br />
Mia started laughing again.  &quot;Do you think Eric will wear a bra?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy mused at the idea,  &quot;Probably, he would be more comfortable.  Just don&#39;t tease him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t&quot; Mia said &quot;You can get him a sports bra, you know because he&#39;s such a jock and all.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a really good idea Mia&quot;  Amy said and nodded.<br />
<br />
Mia sat there quietly, amusing her self with the thoughts of Eric in a bra.</p>
