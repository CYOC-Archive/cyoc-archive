<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Seattle’s police commissioner left the press conference, totally embarrassed. After Lionel’s arrest he is shortly murdered while recovering in the hospital. The press had a field day. While he did his best to deflect and obfuscate in his answers; he knew the conference was a complete boondoggle. Several reporters were demanding to see Lionel’s prosthetic tail. They refused to believe it got destroyed during his attempt to evade arrest. Some are even wondering if there was a cover-up regarding the true nature of the ‘rat pack gang’.<br />
<br />
He enters the gang task force squad room to see every officer on the phone. ‘More reporters,” he thinks. “Tell me there is something to go off of on the hospital footage,” he barks to no one in particular. The room falls silent save for the phones constantly ringing. “As of know no more answering question to the reporters! If they call, make them eat voicemail! He screams. “Now where is the captain?<br />
<br />
One officer points to a back room to afraid to speak. The commissioner walks towards a small room to see the captain reviewing the surveillance footage. “Tell me you have something,” He bellows while slamming the door.<br />
“Nothing,” the squad captain looks crestfallen “Whoever the killer is; he was smart.” The captain continues “Disguising himself as a doctor to get in undetected and not once did he let the security cameras see his face.”<br />
The commissioner looks like he swallowed a tack. “Fingerprints, DNA, a goddam manifesto, perhaps?”<br />
The captain shakes his head.<br />
“What about the nitwit assigned to guard Ulysses?” The commissioner demands. “Did he not get a look at the individuals face?”<br />
The captain snorts in disgust. “The officer in question was more concerned with the game on his smart phone.” Pointing to the security footage, the commissioners see the officer with his head buried to his phone as Lionel’s killer approaches. Waving him in without looking up; the commissioner is incensed.<br />
<br />
“The biggest embarrassment to this city since the Seahawks flubbed last year’s Super bowl, and all we got is footage of someone’s back and a beat cop playing a game!” The commissioner continues, “I want to speak to that officer right fucking now!” Leaving the room, “and I want to know what killed Ulysses! Give me a full autopsy!”<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Dymixious and Jade leave Moon Lake’s hospital. It was such a beautiful day and both where beaming with the joyous news. In roughly two months there would soon be twin boys that will call Dymixious father. He couldn’t be any happier. Just as he and Jade get to their vehicle, Dymixious receives a call. It was his father.<br />
“Don’t tell me you are chomping at the bit to find out now,“ Dymixious chuckles.<br />
“Out with it son,” Drake pleads. “Boy or girl.”<br />
Dymixious smiles, “Twin boys.” Pausing to let his father digest that bit of news he continues, “Got the ultrasound photo to prove it.”<br />
Drake laughs and screams with joy. Dymixious lets his father have his moment. “Look Father. I can’t be doing any more wet work. At least not until the babies are born.”<br />
Drake is silent for a moment. “Ok, Look I know you like your house. But it is quite a distant from civilization.” Drake continues, “I want you to take up residence at a house I have in Moon Lake.” Dymixious is about to interrupt, but his father continues. “At least until Jade gives birth and your sons and her are out of the hospital.”<br />
“Fine,” Dymixious responds. “But you better have BBC America. I’m not missing my favorite British comedy, save for Jade’s water breaking.”<br />
Drake just laughs. “You’re just like you mother. She had odd taste in entertainment.”<br />
“Whatever,”Dymixious responds dismissively. “Going shopping with Jade; bye,” with that he hangs up and looks at his wife. “Which store do you intend to buy out first?”<br />
Jade laughs, “Lets checkout what’s available downtown.”<br />
<br />
Dymixious starts the car and heads south. “Dad wants us to stay at a house he has here in Moon Lake,” He comments while driving. “Wants to make sure you get to the hospital in time.“<br />
“well, he only wants what’s best for his future grandchildren,” She answers. “And besides, It makes sense. Our house happens to be in the middle of no-where. It be nice to have neighbors for a change.”<br />
Dymixious, rolls his eyes. “Just as long as he doesn’t start suggesting baby names,” He shudders. “Bad enough he gave my my name.”<br />
“Just how did you father name you, Dymixious?” Jade asks.<br />
“He and mother where vacationing in Greece. Back when it was under the rule of The Ottoman Empire. Mom goes into labor, has me. Dad got drunk off of ouzo in celebrating my birth and in a drunken slur named my Dymixious.”<br />
Jade laughs, “That’s cruel.” She also continues, “did what you say to the doctor is true? You are one hundred and fifty years old?”<br />
“Yep,” Dymixious answers while arriving into Moon Lake’s downtown area. Born in Athens in the year eighteen sixty six. You will find that lots of weres can live to around a century or two. But none have a life expectancy of us. Three to four hundred years; plus or minus a decade.” Pulling into a parking spot he continues, “FYI my birthday is next week and my favorite cake is blueberry.”<br />
Jade looks at Dymixious. “Don’t expect a present. I’m already carrying two.” Cradling her belly for added emphasis; as they both get out of the vehicle. “oh! Where is your father’s Moon lake house?”<br />
Dymixious looks at his phone. Noticing the address and the security code his father sent. “It’s a ten minute drive from downtown,” Putting the phone away as they entered the first baby store they saw.<br />
<br />
“Welcome, how may I help you?” The proprietor beams as Jade and Dymixious enter. <br />
“Clothes for our future sons,” Jade responds.<br />
The proprietor notices Jade’s extremely pregnant belly and smiles. “Future sons you say. Twins?”<br />
“Yes,” Dymixious answers not sure where to begin. Dymixious notices the store owner smell as she approaches. ‘Were-badger,’ he thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
The store owner tries making a discreet sniff can’t detect a scent from either individual. Curious she asks, “Are you new to town?” <br />
“You could say that,” Dymixious responds all the while noticing the store owner trying to figure out what were he and his wife are. “We live an hour outside of town and came in to see Dr. Tora.”<br />
“Ooh these look nice!” Jade shouts. She grabs several cute onesies that have various designs and colors and show a few to Dymixious.<br />
“Those are fine; but not the pink one. And don’t get two of everything. Just because we are having twins doesn’t mean they have to look alike.” Chuckling, “We need to be able to tell them apart.”<br />
“Fine,” Jade pouts. “Let’s get these and checkout a few more stores before heading to your fathers place.”<br />
“Oh, you have family here?” The store owner asks.<br />
“My father has a house here,” Dymixious responds while paying for the baby clothes. “We are staying until my wife goes into labor.”<br />
“Honey, keys to the car so I can put these in the back?” Jade asks.<br />
<br />
Dymixious tosses the keys to Jade. “I’ll be with you in a second to help you out honey.” Turning to the store owner as Jade leaves; ”from one were to another. You need to do a better job in trying to smell someone without making it seem like you are smelling them.”<br />
“I-I have no idea what you are saying sir?” The store owner stammers.<br />
Dymixious just smiles. For a quick second his eyes shift from hazel to bright yellow with reptilian like slits for pupils. To drive home his point he flicks a long narrow forked tongue so the were-badger notices.<br />
“Wha-what were are you?” the owner stammers.<br />
“Dragon,” was all Dymixious says while leaving the store to help his wife back into the car.</p>
