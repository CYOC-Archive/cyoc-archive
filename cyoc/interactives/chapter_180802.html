<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff did his best to walk out of the stall, taking a few cautious steps before deciding he had a pretty good handle on this new body. The concept of controlling four legs, two of which were behind him and beyond his reach, was odd. Not just that, but this shouldn&#39;t be a thoughtless task. <br />
<br />
But it felt completely natural. Jeff felt quite energized at the moment, so intensely masculine and well-built. And he could sense that things were fine as they were. <br />
<br />
He trotted out to assess his surroundings. The horse stable looked pretty clean from outside his stall. In his stall was nothing more than a few pillows. The two horses on either side of him were similarly colored to his brown-and-white haired hide, and were watching him with silent curiosity. There looked to be at least three other stalls, and a wider area that maybe was a washing station. Looking at it gave Jeff a sudden shiver through the entirety of his body, of which the sensation felt like it lasted three times longer than normal. He shook one of his back legs to release some tension, and in doing so felt his new horse tail swish unconsciously across his behind. Each moment he could process the space his new body consumed, and how his center of balance kept his human half in check.<br />
<br />
In the other corner of the stable was what appeared to be a makeshift living space. It had some tools that were probably for keeping the stable clean, but also a large inflatable mattress, a couple cupboards with a sink, a small fridge, a television, and a computer station. They were all pretty tall, as if they were for someone his height. There was also a tall mirror leaning against the wall, and Jeff could see his gruffy visage and hairy chest in the reflection.<br />
<br />
On the computer&#39;s screen appeared to be the Chronivac&#39;s menu. So were these his things to use?<br />
<br />
His train of thought was interrupted by a loud pounding on one of the stable&#39;s doors. &quot;Jeff! Up and at &#39;em! It&#39;s 7:10!&quot;<br />
<br />
The horses in the stalls rustled a bit at the noise. Jeff turned around in the direction of the entrance. A rugged-looking man in overalls and with blond hair and suntanned skin walked into the stable. &quot;Morning. Sleep well?&quot; He propped the doors open with a kick of his steel-toed shoes, letting the light of the sun brighten the stable. It felt good as it warmed his horse hide.<br />
<br />
Jeff wasn&#39;t sure who this man was... but he definitely looked to be some kind of farmer. Maybe Jeff was living on a farm now. But then where was his family? Had he moved out completely, or was this stable in his backyard somehow? <br />
<br />
&quot;Beautiful day, my friend! &#39;Sposed to get pretty warm weather the next few days. So you should stretch those legs of yours for a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
He turned around to him fully, watching as he approached one of the mares to pet its head. The mare lovingly leaned into his hand and flicked its ears. Maybe he was a stablehand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stretch &#39;yer legs out, then come back in an hour and I&#39;ll help give &#39;ya a wash-down. How&#39;s that sound?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yeah, he could get used to this. Jeff rubbed his beard and smiled. <br />
<br />
But he also felt a tightness come from back between his hind legs. The feeling was growing in intensity... and he had a pretty good idea what it was. Suddenly he was hyper-aware of his horse junk. There was no sense in hiding it; no modesty at all. He was in the nude and this was natural for him now. If he weren&#39;t standing in front of the farmer, he&#39;d do a visual check, to make sure. But he was certain it was his cock sliding out of its sheath. <br />
<br />
The stable hand glanced over when Jeff didn&#39;t answer, and must have seen what was happening. He smiled too. <br />
<br />
&quot;Really, now?&quot; He stopped what he was doing with the mare, and turned to Jeff, smirking and chuckling a bit. &quot;Eager McBeaver. You gotta save some of that for later...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Jeff asked, trying to act oblivious. Hearing his voice for the first time, he sounded much more like an older adult. It had a rich but gentle tone to it.<br />
<br />
It was no use to distract himself from the sexual thoughts. The coordination of his legs seemed to be getting worse. And as he got a better look at the stable hand&#39;s... gorgeous face... <br />
<br />
&quot;Tch. Yeah, <i>what</i>. You&#39;re such a tease...&quot; The stable hand walked toward Jeff, throwing the gloves off into a hay bale. &quot;That&#39;s why I love working here with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The sensations continued to grow. His velvety black horse cock was most certainly dangling below him, now almost fully out of its sheath. Jeff grunted under his breath and he felt it thump against his horse body. Another full-body shiver... he wanted to be touched. His arms and hands were wrapped around his human chest, deliberately trying not to brush against his pecs or abs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess I get to help &#39;ya first,&quot; the stable hand said with a wink.</p>
