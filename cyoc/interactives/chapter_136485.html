<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You keep thinking in circles, you&#39;re new to this town, you don&#39;t know where you can hide. As you walk down the streets aimlessly you start noticing Irishmen are eyeing you. You&#39;ve gotta act fast and make your choice now, or they&#39;ll just approach you! You recognize one of the buildings and hurry inside, only to realize that you&#39;ve entered a room full of Irishmen who are laughing and drinking. In your haste, you entered the first building you recognized, the pub. You have sealed your fate.<br />
<br />
You turn to exit the room, but you can&#39;t get the door open. Looking next to the door you realize why, an Irish bloke has his hand holding the door closed. You have no choice but to turn to the crowd, you see the Irishmen are staring at you hungrily, they&#39;ve started stripping. &quot;Oi, we got a fresh wanker here.&quot; &quot;We just finished with Alroy, we having a second round?&quot; &quot;Nah, don&#39;t feel like a usual round, how about we get pissed?&quot; &quot;Get pissed? You saying we give him the beer treatment?&quot; &quot;Course I fooking am, let&#39;s give him the beer treatment!&quot;<br />
<br />
The crowd has finished undressing, they start moving around the furniture. The tables are moved to the side of the pub as they make a circle of chairs, with a single chair in the center. &quot;Oi Wanker, you daft or something? Strip and sit in that chair.&quot; You&#39;re not sure who shouted that, but you know they&#39;re all thinking the same thing. With no choice, you walk to that chair and strip to your underwear. You go to take a seat until you hear the same voice call out &quot;For fooks sake, take it all off. We&#39;re Irish, we aren&#39;t pissy little shits who hide their manhood.&quot;  You take off your underwear and sit down.<br />
<br />
The men around the room take seats as well, you&#39;re now encircled by naked, horny, Irishmen. You hear them all laugh as they yell out crude comments. &quot;You think this one&#39;ll prefer taking it or giving it?&quot; &quot;Hah, with how he currently is I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s capable of even giving it.&quot; &quot;Bah, remember, first one who cums has to help. He&#39;ll probably be a master of giving it after that.&quot; The men laugh and cheer, you spot two men who haven&#39;t taken a seat. One&#39;s the barkeeper and the other seems to be one of the patrons. <br />
<br />
The barkeeper grabs two huge kegs and holds them over his shoulders. They approach you, the barkeeper starts opening a keg as the other man holds your head, forcing you to look up and keep your mouth open. You stay in this position and wait, after a few moments you see the barkeeper lifts the keg and pours the beer over you. With your mouth forced open you have no choice but to drink, you nearly choke with this rush of beer, but after you taste it you begin to crave it. You drink as much as you can, loving the salty task of the brew. You feel the hands holding your head relax and let go of you, you&#39;re going to have to thank that man for &#39;convincing&#39; you to try this brew.<br />
<br />
Out of the corners of your eyes, you spot the nearby sitting men jerking off. The group all masturbating to the display of you drowning in this beer. The man who previously held you has one arm jerking himself off, and the other giving a handjob to the barkeeper. The barkeeper keeps a stoic look on his face as he continues to tip the alcohol. As it pours on you, you feel a surge of power. You can tell you&#39;re changing, you feel stronger, tougher. But you&#39;re unwilling to look at yourself as you turn, you need to keep drinking this stuff and check yourself out later. The only changes you confirm for yourself is that you know have long, ginger hair that blocks your sight for a second as it grows. You also feel a lot taller, as you shift in your chair to prevent yourself from falling off. You continue your drink and begin hearing loud moans from the crowd, one of the men yells as he shoots seed straight onto your left leg. Everyone starts laughing as the man who orgasmed stands up proudly and flexes &quot;Looks like good &#39;ol Garve gets to do the honors!&quot;<br />
<br />
The beer stops pouring on you as you now examine yourself. You&#39;re big, reaching to an impressive 7&#39;1, your body is coated in thick, orange hairs that stick to your wet skin. You&#39;re muscular, more so than anyone else you&#39;ve seen. While the other men around here have athletic six-packs, you&#39;re built for a bodybuilder. Even with your harier self, your muscles still shine through and are obviously visible and bulging. Your last examination is on your member, which has become 11 inches big, you stroke it happily. The man whose seed is still on your leg, Garve, approaches you. He&#39;s around 6&#39;5, a lot thinner than most of the men in this bar but still just as hairy. His hair is short and spiked, and he has a 5 o clock shadow. He kneels in front of you with a grin and begins kissing your shaft. You smile at this treatment, then feel more beer starting to pour on your head. You look up and have another drink. The men have started masturbating again, and you receive a special treatment from Garve.<br />
<br />
As the second round continues, you hear louder and louder moans as men continue to cum. The seed always impacting your body and sticking into your hairs. Garve begins to deepthroat you, the pleasure is intense. As the flow of beer begins to slow you end up loudly yelling in triumph as you cum, Garve happily drinking it all down. With you still drenched and now Garve off your cock, you stand up and help him off the ground. Garve approaches you close and begins to lick the excess beer off your pecs. &quot;Glad you&#39;re providing the beer now Oistin.&quot; The other men in the pub laugh as they approach you and begin to do the same...<br />
<br />
After a poorly made decision, you ended up in the worst location possible. You were drowned in beer and transformed into the Irish Bodybuilder Oistin. When the city was claimed by your people and everyone turned, you decided to set up a gym next to your favorite pub. You became the leader of the gym and a personal trainer of sorts. Many trained hard under you, but none could ever match your physique. Every time you went to the pub for drinks, you were always the center of attention, and the barkeeper&#39;s favorite customer.</p>
