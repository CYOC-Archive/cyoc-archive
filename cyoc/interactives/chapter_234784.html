<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hold it right there!&quot; A second magician yelled. He moved rather slowly, pulling a large cart behind him. As he approached huffing and puffing he called out to the man at the stage. &quot;You stole my act! That was my idea!&quot; There were a few groans and Amber wondered if people recognized him. Perhaps he was a reoccurring problem here. <br />
<br />
The magician stared at him from the stage. &quot;Are you jealous that I did it better, or because you have the wrong fruit to pull it off?&quot; He asked him.<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn&#39;t matter!&quot; The newcomer insisted. <br />
<br />
&quot;Feels like it does.&quot; The magician countered. &quot;Whats up with the cart?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s part of my new act!&quot; He declared. Turning the cart to the side, he unhooked the top half, letting the walls fall to the side revealing three large jugs of water. &quot;This cart&#39;s surface is custom made.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you afford that?&quot; The magician asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it.&quot; His competitor declared. &quot;Like a stove, it keeps the water warm like a relaxing portable hot tube. For this trick, I require three volunteers.&quot;<br />
<br />
There weren&#39;t many eager to volunteer. Amber thought it had to do with his whiney attitude. Who cares who came up with the trick? Wasn&#39;t the showman ship the important part?<br />
<br />
The newcomer finally started pointing at people in the crowd. &quot;How about you,&quot; he called on a brunette in a sundress. She was with a tour group, their guide identifying them as a group from London. She seemed hesitant, but her boyfriend nudged her forward and she went.<br />
<br />
The next girl he pointed at was of Asian decent. She  wore a crop to, and had her hair in twin tails on either side of her head. Her friends quickly encouraged her to step forward, and she seemed eager to go up once called on.<br />
<br />
Finally, he picked a blonde who wore a bikini top and Jean shorts, that barely had enough material to be worthy of the name. Amber glanced at her chest, jealous of her large size. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now, if my lovely volunteers would please introduce themselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cindy,&quot; the woman in a sundress said with a British accent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ayame.&quot; The Asian girl said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lucy.&quot; The blonde girl answered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for volunteering today.&quot; The whiney magician announced. &quot;I would like to start with Cindy. We all know Americans and Brits have a different opinions on tea. Typically we drink it cold.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You drink it wrong.&quot; She told him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you would say that. Would you please step into the first jug, which should be warm enough to be a proper cup of tea. Watch your step, the blue part is the safe part.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cindy hesitated until the guy who nudged her called from the audience. &quot;Go ahead Cindy. It&#39;s about tea time and we could all use a good cup.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it might just cost you a girlfriend,&quot; she grumbled as she made her way on top of the cart. The magician helped her step into the jug.<br />
<br />
Each just was large enough to fit one of the girls up to waist height, and clear so they could see inside. The water started to change, starting around her legs. Slowly turning into a light brown. Soon it began to darker and you couldn&#39;t see the inside. Cindy kept her hands on the edge, but started to have trouble standing up. She seemed confused, looking into the changing water around her. Leaning to one side she reached end and held up a pair of rather daring panties.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are these my knickers?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose they floated to the top since you no longer have legs to keep them on. They diluted and steeped into the water to make this tea. Though it afraid it will be a bit weak unless we steep the proper amount of ingredients, if you get my meaning.&quot; The newcomer told her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, fine.&quot; She tossed the soggy underwear at her boyfriend. &quot;You can keep that as a memento. An idea of what kind of night we could have had you weren&#39;t dead set on tea.&quot; There were some laughs, and a few guys gave whistles. &quot;Alright,&quot; Cindy smiled. &quot;Pretty sure everyone wants to see what happens next.&quot;<br />
<br />
The performer placed a hand on either shoulder and pulled her up. &quot;Say goodbye to Cindy everyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
There were waves and calls of goodbye. Cindy waved back and said, &quot;you yanks better not dump me in the harbor now.&quot; There were a few chuckles as she was pushed down into the tea.<br />
<br />
The new magician completely submerged her, pressing down until his elbows were below the service. When he pulled his hands back out, he held the empty, drenched sundress. &quot;We will have a chance for everyone to try a cup in a minute, but I wonder about people who don&#39;t like the traditional English tea. I like to have other flavors.&quot;<br />
<br />
He glanced at Ayame, who quickly joined him on the next cart without having to be asked anything. <br />
<br />
&quot;If we are talking tea, my ancestors had it way before the English.&quot; She declared. <br />
<br />
&quot;You seem eager.&quot; The magician commented. &quot;Are you just this enthusiastic about tea?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Ayame told him. &quot;I just wasn&#39;t planning on leaving Panama Beach human.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;An admirable aspiration.&quot; He told her. &quot;Now let&#39;s make your ancestors proud, and show some real tea.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ayame stepped in, but this time the water began to turn green. The tea was not as dark so this time the audience could see her legs become transparent, and her shorts float away from her body as her lower half dissolved. <br />
<br />
&quot;Any parting words?&quot; He asked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Green tea is much healthier, so make sure to get as much of me as you can.&quot; Ayame winked at the crowd, and without waiting for the magician, she pulled her arms off the side and crossed them over her chest. She quickly descended and dissolved. Her empty clothes floated to the top, where the magician pulled them out and dropped them to the side with a loud splat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, this gives us two lovely flavors, but I can&#39;t help but think about how not everyone likes tea. I notice we have one volunteer left. Could you help me prepare something for those who are used to a more robust flavor.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucy side as she went up on the cart. &quot;I live here, so might as well get changed somehow.&quot; Without waiting, she climbed into the final jug. &quot;This is actually pretty nice. Kind of relaxing. &quot;<br />
<br />
The new magician tapped her shoulder, and she began to dissolve in the water. She didn&#39;t bother to hold onto the sides and let herself sink into the liquid that was almost black.<br />
<br />
&quot;Coffee is probably more popular here.&quot; He explained. &quot;However so few people can drink it black.&quot;<br />
<br />
As he said this, Lucy&#39;s large breast were submerged and the color around them started to change, spearing to the rest of the concoction. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s why most of us take it with milk or cream.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OH, I&#39;m coffee because I gave big milkers.&quot; Lucy called. &quot;Hilarious.&quot; She yelled sarcastically before slipping below the service.<br />
<br />
The new magician jumped off the cart and opened the lower half that had Styrofoam cups, surger, and cream. &quot;Now if you please for a line, I can quench the thirst of anyone&#39;s here. Much better than boring cake. Right? Right, this is cooler.&quot;<br />
<br />
While there was applause, everyone awkwardly looked away when he demanded to be called better. That didn&#39;t stop anyone from getting a drink, it just stopped them from looking him in the eye.</p>
