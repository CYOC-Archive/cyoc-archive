<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jimmy and Allison wake up partially covered in leaves as they slept outside in the woodland park. They like many other furies decided to have a romantic romp outside; an innate desire to be with nature. It was a wondrous moment for the two as they had a passionate rut by themselves; hearing the sounds of other furies moan and howl in pleasure as they had their respective dalliances.<br />
<br />
“I bet we scared away all the wildlife,” Allison getting up; wiping the leaves off of her fur. She saunters to a nearby by tree and squats next to it. Relaxing her bladder she lets loose a stream of urine letting her mate Jimmy get a good view of her feline snatch.<br />
“You getting up,” Allison smiling as she finishes; picking up a nearby leave and using it as a make shift wipe to clean up.<br />
“You could always come back here and have a morning romp,” the anthro stag-deer smiling; his cervine rod peeking out of its sheath as he absently brushes off some of the leaves that landed on him through the night.<br />
“Tempting,” Allison cooing; “but let’s collect your brother and my friend first.”<br />
<br />
“Spoil sport,” Jimmy displaying mocked sadness as he gets up and lets loose a stream of urine from his prick; playfully aiming his stream near Allison’s foot paws as she rolls her eyes.<br />
“Careful,” Allison sauntering to her mate; her tawny furred tail twitching as she got closer. Placing a hand paw on his chiseled abs; leaning in for a kiss but whispering something instead, “stunts like that, and there will be no afternoon delight.”<br />
<br />
A few minutes later as the Anthro stag-deer furry and Anthro Cougar furry walked into a delightfully comical sight. On the ground was Jimmy’s twin brother Jake, mounted to his mate Brittany; an anthro wolf fury. Both passed out and sleeping very soundly.<br />
“Looks like they had some fun,” Allison grinning as she summoned her phone to take a picture of the site.<br />
“Shall we wake them,” Jimmy smiling; “or let them find their own way home?”<br />
“You get your brother,” Allison putting away her phone with her magic runes; “I’ll help rouse Brittany.”<br />
<br />
It took a moment to rouse the slumbering fury couple. Jimmy finding Jake’s grip on Brittany rather strong.<br />
“Wake up brother,” Jimmy prodding his brother; “we have a busy day at the restaurant and need to get ready.”<br />
“I’m taking a personal day,” Jake mumbling; “leave me and Brittany be.”<br />
“No can do,” Jimmy wrenching his brother off Brittany; the site of his brother’s penis sliding out of Brittany’s cum crusted entrance. His seed spilling out of her; barely hiding her scent that even floored Jimmy with lust. “Allison get Brittany awake now,” Jimmy’s own arousal showing; “she has a potent scent coming from her.”<br />
“I don’t smell anything off,” Allison commenting as Brittany begins to stir.<br />
“It’s my heat,” the Anthro Wolf Fury mumbling; “it came last night. I need more relief,” Brittany moaning as she struggles to stand.<br />
“Jake,” Jimmy slapping his brother back to his senses; “you need to snap out of your haze and help your mate.”<br />
<br />
“That is why I need to take a personal day,” Jake shaking his head as he stumbles on shaky hooves and hugs Brittany. “Need to attend to my mate,” Jake looking at the wolf fury with longingly lust filled eyes.<br />
“Dad is not going to be happy about this,” Jimmy shaking his head. Summoning his phone he sends off a text. “Saturdays are always busy at the restaurant.”<br />
“Let’s just walk to the car,” Allison helping Brittany to remain standing as she gently pulls her away from Jake; “Hopefully your dad will have responded by that time.”<br />
<br />
********************<br />
<br />
At the Heartpaw residence, the basement rec room looked like frat house after a pledge party. Empty cans, empty bottles and stains on the carpet best left not investigated. The six passed out  furies were sleeping after an intense evening of their sex lottery. Despite their best efforts, they only managed to last three rounds. The last round having Michael Proudhoof rutting with Racheal Soulfang; Edward Heartpaw pleasuring Denise Proudfoof, while Lucas Soulfang had a happy romp with Jullian Heartpaw. They soon passed out from exhaustion; still embracing the partners they enjoyed passionately. The three couples unwittingly, yet delightfully entering into a poly-amorous relationship thanks to their children becoming mates with each other.<br />
<br />
Edward was the first to stir from his slumber; finding himself staring at the fury sex of an anthro tigress fury. He smiles as he recalls eating her out after she sucked him dry.<br />
“She sure can handle her clitoris getting nibbled on,” Edward quickly disentangling himself from the orange and black striped fury legs. “Better get the coffee going,” As he rub the sleep from his vulpine eyes. The anthro red fox fury taking stock of the damage their passionate fun made. “Looks like everyone is going to need a strong cup or two,” Edward stumbling up the stairs and heading towards the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Twenty minutes later, everyone else slowly came up the stairs; still sleepy, yet all had a satisfied looks on them. The smiles on their muzzles and the fur matted with cum and vaginal juices on every fury showed they enjoyed their time with each other.<br />
“Coffee if anyone needs it,” Edward sipping on a cup as he sit on a stool by the island.<br />
“Oh thank you,” Lucas grabbing some cups and pouring one for himself and one for Rachael.<br />
“Is it strong,” Denise needing help standing; leaning on Michael as he was looking at his phone.<br />
“I made it strong enough to strip grease stains off of a garage floor,” Edward sipping his cup; “consider yourself warned.”<br />
<br />
“Stay home and be with Brittany,” Michael absently talking out load as he types; “we can handle a Saturday service without you. And congratulations,” Michael adding before putting his phone down and grabbing the cup Denise gave him.<br />
“Is something wrong,” Lucas looking at Anthro stag; “what happened?”<br />
“I think we are about to become grandparents,” Michael gagging at how strong the coffee is. Forcing himself to add some sugar to cut down on the bitterness; “Brittany went into heat last night.”<br />
This stunned both Lucas and Rachael as their runes glowed; phones appearing in their hand paws as they began to furiously text and call, effectively blowing up their daughter’s phone.<br />
<br />
***********<br />
<br />
“Oh make the noise stop,” Brittany wincing as her phone starts beeping and ringing. They only just managed to get back to Jimmy’s car that was still parked at the restaurant.<br />
“Give me the phone,” Allison helping Brittany into the vehicle; “I’ll figure it out.”<br />
“No,” Brittany waving off Allison’s offer; “it’s just my parents. I guess they just were told I’m in heat.”<br />
“Dad replied,” Jake looking at his phone; “said to not to worry about service.”<br />
“As soon as we get home,” Jimmy getting into the driver’s seat, while Jake sits next to Brittany; “you’re taking a shower. You stink of mad sex.”<br />
“We all stink of sex,” Allison remarking as she watches her mate work the pedals of his manual transmission car with his hooves.<br />
“Them first,” Jimmy trying to keep focused; the smell emanating from Brittany making it difficult to focus.<br />
<br />
Shortly after driving back to the Proudhoof house, Jake led Brittany upstairs to the bathroom as Allison and Jimmy sat in the living room.<br />
“You think Brittany is going to be alright,” Jimmy looking at the anthro cougar fury; “you know her best after all.”<br />
“You brother seems to care for her,” Allison sitting next to Jimmy; “she is just out of sorts. In fact I would be acting just like her if I was in her situation,” Allison sighing; “these urges after becoming a fury are new to me as well.”<br />
“Uncharted territory then,” Jimmy nodding; “let’s make some breakfast. Perhaps that will help them.”<br />
“Couldn’t hurt,” Allison nodding; she gets up and follows Jimmy to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Upstairs, Brittany was in the shower, the cold water soaking her grey fur and helping her temper the burning desire welling within. Without thinking, she grabs a bottle of shampoo; thinking she was at home. Opening the bottle she gags as the scent wafting from the bottle made her retch in disgust. Tossing it, she grabs another bottle, a body wash and she is disgusted with its scent as well. She did this with all the bottles in the shower stall until all that was left was a bar of unscented soap. Finding that tolerable she works up a lather and begins to soap up her furry body in an effort to be somewhat presentable for a fury walking around naked and without shame.<br />
“Do you need any help,” A male voice could be heard outside; “I heard some noise and got concerned.”<br />
“Just trying to find a bottle of shampoo that doesn’t smell awful to my new sensitive nose,” Brittany responding as she rinses off the soap on her fur. “Had to settle on an unscented bar of soap,” Brittany turning off the shower and stepping out. Using her runes to magically dry her fur off, not bothering to grab a towel as it would be useless to wet fur.<br />
<br />
Jake picks up one of the bottles on the shower floor and recoils as the scent he was familiar with when he was human, is now revolting to his new fury enhanced sense of smell. “I see what you mean,” As he puts the bottle back. “How are you feeling,” the stag fury looking at Brittany as she sits on the toilet; hearing a hissing sound as she begins to urinate.<br />
“Still feeling horny,” Brittany grabbing some toilet paper to wipe with; “can we just spend the day in bed together?”<br />
“Perhaps after breakfast,” Jake stepping into the shower to also clean up; “we can also sit on the coach and watch t.v if that will help.”<br />
“As long as it is with you,” Brittany answering as Jake turns on the shower; still sitting on the toilet she summons her phone and pulls up an e-market site to order a few supplies. Satisfied with her selection she confirms her order and gets off the toilet. Making sure to flush, Brittany giggles as Jake howls in pain as he gets hit with a blast of hot water thanks to the toilet flush.</p>
