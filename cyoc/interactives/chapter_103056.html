<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Lemmee see who&#39;s bigger,&quot; Chandler said as he jerked off his Chad manhood trophy.<br />
<br />
He put it next to Greg&#39;s boner, as Greg blushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Bill, I didn&#39;t think this was catch and release?&quot; Steven said.<br />
<br />
Greg felt Chad&#39;s plaque push into his side, and felt his velvety erection brush against his own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Longer by a finger&#39;s breadth, but Chad&#39;s got more girth,&quot; Chandler said smugly.<br />
<br />
&quot;We both have a couple nice trophies,&quot; Bill said, &quot;You know I think I&#39;ll put Greg on a pedestal posed running with his boner sticking straight out.  Be a great conversation piece for my birthday party next week, and Jeff will be nice in front of the fireplace on the floor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You might want to hang him on the wall,&quot; Chandler said looking at Jeff, &quot;I remember your last party, your wife said the drunks left cigarette burns and vomit all over your carpet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was New Year&#39;s, this will be different,&quot; Bill said.  He paused, and uncertainly added, &quot;I&#39;m sure it won&#39;t be that bad for my birthday.&quot;  Bill sounded distracted, and fiddled with his phone and remote relay app to Chronivac.  Suddenly, Greg was mounted on a pedestal with one foot attached to the base, the other trailing behind him in midair and his shaft a full erection. &quot;Be sure to take photos at different angles. Here let me drape Jeff on the edge of the pedestal in front of him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then he put his foot on Jeff&#39;s head with his gun in his hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great shot, but I&#39;d like one with Jeff slung over your shoulders, Bill,&quot; Steven said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, but remind me to take one at the party tonight, I think I&#39;ll wear Jeff like a toga.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Toga! Toga! Toga!&quot; Chandler shouted with a nod to Animal House.<br />
<br />
They resumed their hunt.  The other ten boys proved far too easy to take down, and they were back at the lodge before nightfall.  They cracked open the beers, and started the party earlier than planned.  Jeff&#39;s dad carried his skin into the bedroom with Greg walking behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I at least put some clothes on, dad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;After we get home, Greg, and at the party you&#39;re going to be in pedestal pose, but first I thought you could help me put Jeff on securely.  Do you think I should just tie him in place or use safety pins?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure tying will be sufficient,&quot; Greg said thinking of Jeff&#39;s humiliation at being worn, adding pins would be adding injury to insult.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, well, should I position his face over my crotch or on my shoulder.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Definitely on your shoulder, dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
After his dad was properly attired and he finished his beer, his father pushed the button on the Chronivac, and Greg spun around  on his heels and walked into the main room to assume his place with the other trophies on display.  He grimaced, but his face adjusted into the expression his father had saved in the Chronivac.  Then Bill stopped to admire himself in the mirror, and take a selfie.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
For the next two weeks, Chad&#39;s manhood hung on the boardroom wall.  Chandler had an intern &quot;polish&quot; Chad&#39;s until he was edged before every meeting, and he conducted all his meetings for the next two weeks in the board room.  He had as many as 7 meetings one day.  Chad had a foreskin, and the way the Chronivac did him in, he could only see when his foreskin retracted.  The first time Chandler told his intern Bryce that he would be in charge of Chad&#39;s cock and balls, and was tasked with getting him hard before each meeting, he was disgusted.  But after the fourth time edging Chad, he started to get it into it.  He hadn&#39;t been a big fan of Chad.  He wasn&#39;t a jock like Chad, so he fortunately had never been subjected to Jock Season.  He had known Chad at Summer Camp years ago.  Even though Chad was four years younger than Bryce, he had been a head taller, and he&#39;d made Bryce&#39;s camp experience hell.  Bryce had been a senior, but this middle school kid had bullied him, and pranked him leaving him naked tied to the flag pole and gagged with somebody&#39;s underwear.  So now that he could basically torture Chad&#39;s nuts, and dick to get it hard, he was enjoying his revenge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bryce, well, it&#39;s the end of the day, you wouldn&#39;t mind draining Chad&#39;s balls would you?  I had you edge him six times today, and I think he deserves to cum, don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; Bryce said, but then he added, &quot;I&#39;m not sure if I drain him that I&#39;ll be able to get him hard for your breakfast meeting in the board room tomorrow. It might be better to edge him tonight again, and then in the morning, he should be particularly horny and maybe stay up for the whole breakfast?  Perhaps I should inject him with some Edex or Caverject?  You know that stuff you sometimes have me help you inject?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm?  Yeah, I suppose having him at full staff for 2 hours would be most effective.  I have some Caverject in my bottom drawer with a syringe.  You have a key, so prep Chad about 7:00 am, when you let the caterers in. He should be hard as rock from 7:30-9:30 then,&quot; Chandler beamed broadly, &quot;Good thinking, Bryce.&quot;  He whistled as he left, and Bryce turned and twisted Chad&#39;s balls. <br />
<br />
He lifted the plaque with the hardening cock off the wall, and proceeded to lower his own trouser.  He jacked off and came all over Chad&#39;s cock and balls.  He whispered, &quot;Bet you wish that was your cum. Now I promised your father that I&#39;d edge you properly and with a load to lube you up, I don&#39;t have to be anywhere for a couple hours, and I&#39;ve got some Icy Hot from the first aid kit, and bucket of crushed ice. Mwhahahaha!&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad was in hell.  Officially, he was in hell, he said to himself.  It was only the first day of two weeks, and he felt hopeless.  The first few times, he vowed to pound Bryce into the floor when he was human again, but now he&#39;d happily give Bryce a blow job, a rim job, or even let him fuck Chad, if it meant the next time he was a wall trophy that Bryce would treat him better.  He knew that in four weeks, his father would mount him back on the wall, or maybe worse.   One of Chandler&#39;s meetings today had been with a plumbing supply company, and the man had suggested that Chad&#39;s manhood would make a great toilet flush handle using one of his adapters.  Chad cringed at the idea shrinking back into his foreskin, but his dad seemed intrigued, and asked the man to email him a catalog with the different options.</p>
