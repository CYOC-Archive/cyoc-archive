<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Anka Islet is the smallest of Mieni&#39;s archipelago. The small island was only 3/4ths of a mile at its widest and most of it was beach, though there were plenty of rock formations. There wasn&#39;t much room for building structures, maybe a few shacks. So when the idea for a &#39;clothing optional&#39; beach was suggested, Anka Islet was the obvious choice. It was far enough from the other islands so that bathers couldn&#39;t be spied on and considering there was little else but beach there, there would be little else to do there. Of course, the only people who could go there were adults, either because they were over the age of 21 or if they were double-dosed Animalians. Couples that wanted to mate would have to go behind one of the rock formations or inside the shacks that would be built there.<br />
<br />
Maggie thought spending an afternoon at Anka Islet might be a good idea for her students. Modeling agencies might want their models to be dressed in as little as possible for swimsuit issues, sometimes topless though with their nipples tastefully obscured. To Maggie&#39;s logic, if her students could get used to being on the beach wearing nothing at all, they could handle anything else.<br />
<br />
Of course, some of her students were a bit uneasy about being nude on the beach. Even with Animalians&#39; lower sense of modesty, human habits were hard to kick. Maggie brought her female students to the islet first so they wouldn&#39;t need to worry about the men looking at them. It took a bit of coaxing, but they eventually lightened up. They eventually started treating it like another day at the beach, just with less clothes to prevent contact with the sand. But it wasn&#39;t all just beach time fun. Maggie had her girls posing at various times as if they were at a photoshoot. No actual pictures were taken, but it would be very good practice for if they were in actual photoshoots. And being confident enough to pose in the buff would mean wearing a bikini would be a breeze.<br />
<br />
Zoe was lying on a large flat rock, allowing the sun to dry out her fur. She kinda wondered if this was how a true lioness would be basking. Of course, a lioness would be sitting on a kopje in the Serengeti, not on a rock on a tropical beach. Still, Zoe had no regrets about choosing the animal to be converted with. Lions were cool and it was certainly better than having polio. Her parents had been such avid participants in the anti-vaccination protests. Zoe could never figure out why some people were so against vaccinations. Personally, she thought that they were just looking for any excuse to complain. But Zoe certainly didn&#39;t miss the irony that her parents&#39; irresponsibility ended up causing her to get a disease she could have been protected from, nor that the cure for her would be a shot that&#39;ll change her species entirely. Her parents felt so guilty that not only did they allow her to choose any animal she wanted, they allowed her to double-dose as well.<br />
<br />
Zoe looked down at her body as she reflected. As a double-dosed lioness, she had a magnificent body. She was well-muscled and very curvy. Her breasts were almost the size of her head and her nipples were very visible, especially since her fur was still a little wet. The short fur allowed her to easily see her toned abs and the solid muscles of her arms and legs. Her rear was plush but firm and her hips were of an appealing girth. Her fur was still wet enough to see her vagina quite clearly, though it wasn&#39;t very hidden when it was dry. Since she became an Animalian, she had been allowing her hair to grow long enough to be like a lion&#39;s mane, or at the very least long enough to cover her breasts easily. She was making progress, but her black hair still only  went down to her collarbone.<br />
<br />
Zoe had wondered if she had jumped the gun when she went for the double-dose. Like all young teens, she had been anxious to grow up, especially to get some curves. While she wasn&#39;t overlooked in the curves department, Zoe kinda wondered if she skipped over too much of her childhood. Well, maybe not many years, but perhaps she could have taken things slower. And yet, being able to have an adult body now and getting to model it was a very hard thing to turn down.<br />
<br />
Just then, Karen came over to Zoe&#39;s rock and asked, &quot;How are you doing in this sun?&quot; Karen&#39;s body was just as curvy as Zoe&#39;s was, but Zoe was a bigger cat than Karen&#39;s snow leopard. Karen was slighter with thicker fur that did better to cover her nipples and pussy. The downside was that hot places like this tropical island made Karen overheat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Better than you are probably,&quot; said Zoe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, having less clothes on is keeping me from getting too hot,&quot; said Karen, &quot;Not by a lot, but enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Should have picked a more temperate template,&quot; said Zoe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Snow leopards are beautiful,&quot; said Karen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Karen, do you have a boyfriend?&quot; asked Zoe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet,&quot; said Karen, &quot;Snow leopards are still a bit of a rarity for now, but I don&#39;t think for much longer. Lions are a lot more common so how comes you haven&#39;t gotten a mate?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was wondering if it was too soon for me,&quot; said Zoe, &quot;I&#39;ve been thinking about it more lately.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think you might be coming into heat?&quot; asked Karen with concern.<br />
<br />
Zoe paused and said, &quot;Maybe, I don&#39;t know when mating season is for lions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most big cats don&#39;t have a particular time,&quot; said Karen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I know I&#39;m not ready to be a mother yet,&quot; said Zoe, &quot;My parents would completely flip if I did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn&#39;t mean you have to close yourself off completely,&quot; said Karen, &quot;You should try going out with a few lions, see if there&#39;s a special spark. You don&#39;t have to commit to the first lion that interests you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I might give a try,&quot; said Zoe as she ran a hand down one hip, &quot;I doubt there are many lions who would turn me down if I offered.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Girl, it&#39;s a wonder one hasn&#39;t made a serious move on you yet,&quot; said Karen. The two of them shared a laugh. Being at a beach with nothing to cover their bodies but their fur wasn&#39;t that hard, but it was even easier with a friend.</p>
