<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake replies with a big smile. &quot;Of course, my dear! We&#39;ll do what we have to do now and later we&#39;ll continue transforming each other if you want to.&quot; Alice leans in and gives him another kiss. &quot;Yes, I want to. And I can&#39;t wait to see what we can do with the Transform-O-Matic next. It&#39;s opened up a whole new world of possibilities for us, and I&#39;m excited to explore them together with you.&quot; She smiles. &quot;I love you, Jake.&quot;<br />
<br />
After dinner they sit in the living room again, sipping a glass of beer. Jake looks at the Transform-O-Matic, which is on the table. &quot;So, what&#39;s next, my dear? Do you have any ideas for our next transformation? Is it me or you?&quot; Alice thinks for a moment. &quot;Hmmm... I think it&#39;s your turn next. I want to see you as something different.&quot; She smiles. &quot;And I have an idea for what you could be. How about a set of tight spandex leggings? After all, you suggested that earlier.&quot; She looks at him, her eyes shining with excitement. &quot;You could be my favorite pair of leggings, the ones I wear almost every day. And I could wear you and feel you hugging my body, and I could touch you and feel your fabric against my skin.&quot; She giggles. &quot;And maybe you could even experience my orgasm when I wear you.&quot;<br />
&quot;That sounds great, my love! You mean the ones without the crotch seam? I would love to be your favorite pair of leggings. And I&#39;m sure I would enjoy being worn by you and feeling your body against my fabric.&quot; Jake smiles. &quot;Yes, those seamless leggings. I love how they fit my body. I think you would love to fit my body the same way,&quot; Alice explains.<br />
<br />
Jake thinks also about it again. &quot;Is that enough for you? I mean, it&#39;s nowhere near as extreme or erotically charged as your last transformations. Being a pair of leggings is a pretty normal, everyday object. I mean, we&#39;ve had a beach ball, a dildo, a pussy, a game console. Transforming me into a pair of leggings may count as a lot more tame than that.&quot; Alice laughs. &quot;Oh, don&#39;t sell yourself short, my love. I think being a pair of leggings would be amazing. I would love to wear you and feel you hugging my body, and I could touch you and feel your fabric against my skin.&quot; She smiles. &quot;And I think it would be a great experience for you too. You would be able to feel my body against your fabric, and you might be able to experience my orgasm when I wear you and have fun with myself.&quot; She giggles. &quot;Plus, it&#39;s not like we have to do something extreme or erotic every time. Sometimes it&#39;s nice to just enjoy a simple transformation and explore new sensations.&quot;<br />
<br />
He has to laugh. &quot;You sound like we&#39;ve been transforming each other for years and it hasn&#39;t even been a day yet since the Transform-O-Matic arrived.&quot; Alice laughs too. &quot;I know, right? It feels like we&#39;ve been doing this for years. But I think that&#39;s because we&#39;ve been so excited and curious to try new things. And I&#39;m glad we have the Transform-O-Matic to make it possible.&quot; She smiles. &quot;So, what do you say? Are you ready to become my favorite pair of leggings?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, why not? If you&#39;re so enthusiastic about it, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll enjoy it too.&quot; Jake smiles. &quot;And I&#39;m curious to see how it feels to be a pair of leggings. I mean, we&#39;ve had a beach ball, a dildo, a pussy, a game console. But being a piece of clothing? That&#39;s new for me.&quot; He laughs. &quot;Plus, it&#39;s not like we have to do something extreme or erotic every time. Sometimes it&#39;s nice to just enjoy a simple transformation and explore new sensations.&quot; He tries to say it as if transformations were something completely normal, but then he can&#39;t help laughing at his own words. Alice also laughs. &quot;You&#39;re right. Not even a day and I&#39;m already talking about it like it&#39;s the most normal thing in the world. But I guess it&#39;s because we&#39;re so excited and curious to try new things.&quot; She smiles. &quot;So, let&#39;s do this. I&#39;ll set everything up and you can lay down here on the sofa. I&#39;ll start your transformation and you&#39;ll become my favorite pair of leggings. And then I&#39;ll wear you and we&#39;ll see how it feels.&quot; She giggles. &quot;And would you like to have an orgasm yourself, together with my orgasm, when I wear you and have fun with myself through your fabric?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, that sounds wonderful. And I think it would be great if we could also have the option to communicate with each other via Mental Link while I&#39;m a pair of leggings and you&#39;re wearing me.&quot; Jake says. &quot;You know, I want to be able to tell you how it feels to be your leggings and for you to tell me how it feels to wear me. That way we can enjoy the experience even more and give each other feedback.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I like that idea,&quot; Alice replies. &quot;I would love to be able to hear the thoughts and feelings of my clothing while I&#39;m wearing it. It would make the experience even more intimate and special.&quot; She smiles. &quot;I&#39;ll make sure to set that up in the software. Now, shall we do as we did with our previous transformations? What do you want to keep of your mind when you are my leggings? Do you want to be yourself or should we completely adjust you to your form?&quot; Jake is surprised. &quot;Wait a minute, I have another idea. Do you think I could somehow cover your breasts? Like your sports top or sports bra?&quot; He looks at her questioningly. &quot;That would mean that I would be split into two pieces of clothing. Is that possible? Oh yes, and I think I would like to be like you last time, completely adapted to my form with my mind. Or rather, to my two forms.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice thinks for a moment. &quot;That&#39;s an interesting idea. I think it&#39;s possible. Let me check the software.&quot; She opens the software and starts typing. &quot;Yes, it seems to be possible. You can be transformed into two objects at once. As long as they&#39;re always within the range of the Transform-O-Matic. If one of the pieces is being put out of the Transform-O-Matics range all pieces will start to re-transform immediately. They have set up a real big blinking warning sign and an extra form you&#39;d have to consent to before doing such a transformation. But that&#39;s no problem for us. So, you want to be my sports bra and leggings? And you want to be completely adapted to your two forms with your mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
He&#39;s glad in some way. &quot;Exactly. I mean, I want to be two objects. Your bra and your leggings at the same time. And&quot; - he grins - &quot;I want you to touch yourself through me. I want you to be able to feel me against your skin, like you would feel your usual clothes. And I want to be able to feel you too. I want to feel your body inside me, your breasts against my bra part and your legs and hips against my leggings part. And I want to experience your orgasm through my fabric.&quot; Alice is excited. &quot;Wow, that sounds amazing! I would love to be able to feel you against my skin, like I would feel my usual clothes. And I love the idea of you being able to feel my body inside you and experience my orgasm through your fabric.&quot; She smiles. &quot;I&#39;ll make sure to set everything up in the software. And I&#39;ll also add the Mental Link so we can communicate with each other while you&#39;re my bra and leggings.&quot; She looks at him. &quot;Are you ready to start the transformation, my love?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake wants to know something first. &quot;Did you make all the settings to adjust my mind?&quot; Alice checks the software. &quot;Yes, I did. I&#39;ve set everything up so that your mind will be completely adapted to your two forms. You&#39;ll be nothing more than my sports bra and the leggings.&quot; She smiles. &quot;And I am curious to see how your personality and mind will change when you&#39;re in two different objects at once, being split into two parts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake nods and lies down on the sofa. &quot;OK, I&#39;m ready. Let&#39;s do this.&quot; He looks at Alice. &quot;I can&#39;t wait to feel your body inside me and experience your orgasm through my fabric.&quot; Alice smiles. &quot;I can&#39;t wait to wear you and feel you against my skin.&quot; She starts the transformation process.</p>
