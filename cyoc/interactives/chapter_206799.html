<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before you even had time to put the phone down, you heard a knock on the door. It was getting late, so you wondered who it was. All your friends knew you were &#39;away&#39;. Maybe it was the landlord, checking in on the person the apartment was being sublet to. You quickly put something on, still naked from inspecting yourself just prior. <br />
<br />
As you opened the door, Janelle, your neighbour, greeted you. &quot;Good evening, ma&#39;am&quot; you said. Hearing your new voice was still a bit weird, but you had gotten far more used to it than you thought you would have. You had only been Michael for something like 12 hours of actual conscious time, yet getting comfortable? Well, that was probably good news for the study, right? <br />
<br />
Janelle looked you up and down, just like in the stairway. &quot;Oh, ain&#39;t you a gentleman?&quot; she said with a clearly sexual tone. This time it did make you a bit uncomfortable. But if you were honest, it was also a bit fun. Flirting never hurt nobody. &quot;What can I help you with?&quot; You asked, as you scanned her the way she had scanned you. Janelle clearly noticed and gave you a coy smile. &quot;Oh, A sista&#39; could use someone like you to come help me with something. A faucet is leaking at my place. Ain&#39;t nothing big, just need to turn a knob. But I just couldn&#39;t get it to turn, you know? Figured someone with big strong arms like you could help me out?&quot; Janelle said, as she put her hand on your arm, giving you a smile. While you did find the flirting fun, you also felt a bit worried about following Janelle downstairs to help her out in her apartment. You weren&#39;t ready for anything real to happen and Janelle didn&#39;t seem like a stranger to getting herself some. Besides, if she did come on to you and you said no, would you blow your chance? Janelle wasn&#39;t bad looking, if a bit chubby and her age showing. Her large, fat ass was nothing to take lightly, at least in the tight pants she was wearing, helping it look a bit firmer than it probably was. So in some twisted sense, you didn&#39;t want to close that door and miss an opportunity. Even if that opportunity would be as Michael, not yourself. <br />
<br />
In the end, you decided to come with her. You quickly fixed the leaking faucet, while Janelle kept inspecting your backside. &quot;Well, that&#39;s that. Janelle... Is it fine if I call you Janelle?&quot; You asked. &quot;Oh, that&#39;s real fine, Michael&quot; she cooed at you. You could feel the sexual tension in the air. You hadn&#39;t been helping with the flirting upstairs, thought. So you decided to get ahead of the problem and hopefully keep Janelle as an option to explore, for later. &quot;Well, I&#39;ve had a long day moving house, so I&#39;m going to head back to my apartment and get myself a good nights rest. But...&quot; You stopped yourself and gave Janelle a smile. &quot;But for a fine woman like you, if you ever need me for something else.... physical... Don&#39;t be a stranger&quot; You continued. That should do it, you thought. Clearly an invite and yet a good reason as to why nothing was going to happen right now. Luckily, Janelle seemed to have accepted that. She walked over to you and stroked your arm as she said &quot;Oh, I&#39;ll keep that in mind&quot; before she leaned in and whispered &quot;I&#39;ll definitely keep that in mind, Michael&quot;. With that, she let you go and you were back upstairs, in your apartment. <br />
<br />
All that flirting and Janelle being so forward at the end had quite the effect on you. Your pants felt tight. Real tight. Damn, you had gotten yourself real horny thinking about what could happen. You quickly got undressed. You just felt like you had to do what you were about to do. To let off some steam. &quot;Fuck&quot; you said, as you grabbed your large, dark meat. You stroked it up and down, slowly. You were leaking precum and as you stroked your big black cock, it soon fully covered your shaft. You looked down on the sausage you were currently stroking. Your penis. Yet somebody else&#39;s. It felt both good and weird and bad at the same time. But you didn&#39;t stop. You wanted to cum. You wanted to use your borrowed dick and you wanted to cum with it. Maybe leaving Janelle was the wrong choice? You started to imagine using your new, black,  temporary, cock to fuck Janelle. How would she look as you fucked her from behind? Her big black ass bouncing on your big black dick? Her chubby stomach going back and forth? Her large tits as they bobbed? How would it feel to have Janelle pleasure you orally? Have Janelle gag as she tried to get your monster of a dick into her mouth? You again looked down at the swollen, dark meat in your hand. Damn, it felt weirdly sexy knowing it wasn&#39;t your dick. Yet it was. Knowing you had a large black dick right now. You came hard, really hard. Your cock spasming like mad as you ejaculated all over the apartment. <br />
<br />
As you came down from your pleasure high you couldn&#39;t help feel annoyed you just came all over the floor. But you also felt good, swinging your black dick around. You might be older - but it was only for a year. A year when you could live your life as a black man. You figured Michael must have had a wank already when you called him. Because just like him, you felt like you were going to put the thing between your legs to good use. Michael was probably going to go for young women. Use the fact he was young for a year to enjoy himself with women that wouldn&#39;t talk to him otherwise. Maybe that was the right angle. Get with women that didn&#39;t look your way prior? Women like Janelle. <br />
<br />
As you went to bed that night, you couldn&#39;t help feel this year would be pretty cool. The only thing you worried about was the long term. How would it feel being a black man, in society? But there was always the light at the end of the tunnel for you.</p>
