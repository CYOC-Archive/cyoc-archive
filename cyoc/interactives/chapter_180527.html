<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">James&#39;s bladder felt so full that he thought he might burst! Sleeping in so late really filled his tank, so to speak. He really wasn&#39;t ready for the sight that awaited him when he pulled down his boxers. For one thing, his dick was a lot bigger. For another thing, it was pointing straight up. And to top it all off, his member was altogether covered in light, cream-colored fuzz. Not black pubic hair like he usually had, but rather copious short hairs that looked almost identical to fur, even on his scrotum. Reaching down to grasp it, he was amazed that it felt real and he wasn&#39;t just seeing things. He was also surprised that it seemed he couldn&#39;t directly feel his penis on the other side of the fur. It was more like he was touching some kind of fuzzy bag of skin that had his real dick down inside it; he could feel a fleshy layer getting jostled around between his fingers and his penis. Finding a little opening at the top of the pouch, he probed a finger down inside and managed to make contact with his lubricated cock tip, sighing in relief as he did so. At least he might be able to make use of his organ from its new location. But how?<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t aim his penis at the toilet to any meaningful degree. His new sheath wasn&#39;t only wrapped around his penis--it was closely connected with the flesh of his lower belly and didn&#39;t separate until more than halfway up the shaft. The tip seemed fated to point up at his face no matter what! Trying to point his penis down was an exercise in futility. Maybe he could back up and hope the arc of his urine would shoot up and curve back down at the right angle into the bowel? It was worth a try. Standing as far from the toilet as his tiny bathroom would let him, he let himself relax his heavy bladder. Unfortunately, that didn&#39;t work so well, because he couldn&#39;t get anything to come out. After a strenuous effort, he managed to muster a few tiny driblets of urine at the top of his sheath and had to give up. There was some kind of resistance he couldn&#39;t identify.<br />
<br />
&#39;What is wrong with me?&#39; he thought. &#39;I wake up in the morning and my dick is deformed and now my pipes are stopped up? I&#39;d go straight to the emergency room if I didn&#39;t have to find a way to get this piss out NOW.&#39;<br />
<br />
Calming down after a few deep breaths, James realized he actually felt like he did have some idea about what he was supposed to do. He couldn&#39;t really explain how he knew, and he wasn&#39;t exactly sure what exactly it was that he knew, but it for some reason he just KNEW. It was like an inner voice, except it wasn&#39;t a voice. It was like a partially forgotten word that waits at the tip of one&#39;s tongue, but it wasn&#39;t a word. It was an action, a position, a routine.<br />
<br />
Clearing his mind and deliberately giving in to what you might call an instinct, James realized it was time to get down on all fours. Peeing standing up just wasn&#39;t going to be a good idea. There was something else he had to do, too: he quickly found himself sniffing around the floor and along the wall. He wasn&#39;t sure why it was important to do that, it just was. Satisfied that his chosen section of wall didn&#39;t really smell like anything and needed his help in the next step, he stepped forward on his hands and feet until he could feel he was positioned just right. Time to pee now? No, there was still something else he had to do, some body part he had to reposition--ah, that one! James raised one of his legs and sort of aimed it up and to the side. That&#39;s better! The dam suddenly broke and the torrent of urine flowed swiftly, as easy as the kind of piss he learned to take while potty training nearly three decades ago. Relief flushed through him, and the autograph-like scent of his excretion unexpectedly pacified his lingering anxiety by way of his sensitive nose.<br />
<br />
Finally finishing up and lowering his leg, he circled back around to take another whiff near the spot he had marked. It was gratifying--a smell only James could produce, even though everyone made their own version. &#39;This is MY wall now,&#39; he thought. Finally getting a decent look at what he did, he suddenly snapped out of it. He stood up and jumped back, looked down in that direction again and cringed. &#39;What&#39;s got into me? I peed on my own bathroom wall! It&#39;s spreading across the floor! It&#39;ll take forever to get that all cleaned up.&#39;</p>
