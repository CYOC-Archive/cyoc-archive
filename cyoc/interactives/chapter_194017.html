<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Upon exiting the room, you find yourself floating in a vast ocean.  Still inside the glass bottle, you remain seated and ponder the origin of your new surroundings.  <br />
&quot;I wonder if I was responsible for creating this whole ocean with my tears?  It would be rather unlikely, but I suppose anything&#39;s possible at this point.  Especially considering that I&#39;m literally sitting inside the very bottle I just drank out of a moment ago.  Imagine if Rusty was here right now and ... wait a sec- RUSTY!&quot;  You suddenly blurt out as you remember your life long friend, who was probably worried sick about you, and pull yourself together.  <br />
&quot;What the hell is wrong with me?  It&#39;s like I&#39;m turning into a completely different person here.  I need to find a way out of this dimension or whatever this place is before I forget who I-&quot;  Before you can finish talking, the bottle stops suddenly and you hit your head on the glass bottle&#39;s side, knocking you out.  <br />
<br />
You awoke sometime later to the sound of vibrating glass.  You sit up and find that your head buzzing wildly, causing you to become disoriented.  Eventually the vibrations subside and you regain your senses.  Looking around the now leaning bottle you&#39;ve been traveling in, you realize that you were now on a sandy beach.  <br />
&quot;Oh my, what a lovely beach.  Now to exit this bottle and find The White Rabbit.&quot;  You said, once again speaking like a young proper british lady.  <br />
With the bottle leaning forward towards the beach, you were able to climb up to the bottle&#39;s opening with limited difficulty.  But as you pull yourself out, a strong wave hits the bottle and causing it to point straight up.  You nearly fell back in from the impact, but you held on long enough to pull the rest of you out of the bottle.  Once that task is completed, you jump down from the bottle and, just like before, your dress&#39;s skirt turns into a parachute and you land softly onto the beach.  After the skirt returns to normal, you look down and comment on your clothing.  <br />
&quot;Wow, this outfit is truly amazing.  It can change sizes with me and keeps me from falling down great heights, all while looking quite lovely on me.  I am very grateful to be wearing such a perfect-&quot;  {SPLASH}  <br />
You&#39;re suddenly hit by a large wave and nearly pulled in the current.  You make it back on dry land, but now you were soaking wet.  <br />
&quot;Oh dear me, all that prasing and I let this happen.  What am I going to do?&quot;  <br />
&quot;Perhaps we can help my dear.&quot;  You hear someone say.  <br />
You look up and find yourself among a group of various animals, all of them soaking wet like yourself.  You find that they were all much bigger than you, like you were child-sized compared to them.  The one who spoke to you, the male dodo bird, approaches you.  <br />
&quot;We&#39;ll get you dry in no time at all Alice.&quot;  He said.  <br />
You stared at the dodo bird for a bit before responding.  <br />
&quot;Why thank you Mr. Dodo, but my name isn&#39;t Alice.&quot;  You said.  <br />
&quot;Oh really, then what is it.&quot;  Mr. Dodo asked.  <br />
&quot;Why it&#39;s ... uumm ... Marcia?  Yes, that&#39;s it!  My name is Marcia.&quot;  You tell Mr. Dodo.  <br />
&quot;Are you sure?&quot;  Mr. Dodo questions, leaving you uncertain for a few seconds before proclaiming:  <br />
&quot;I&#39;m pretty sure.  Now if I don&#39;t mind asking, how can you help me get dry?&quot;  <br />
&quot;Why with a caucus race of course.&quot;  Mr. Dodo said, confusing you for a bit.  <br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, but a what?&quot;  <br />
&quot;Come with us and you&#39;ll see.&quot;  <br />
You follow Mr. Dodo and the animals out of the beach and into an open field.  One-by-one, all the animals and yourself line up side-to-side in a straight line.  Mr. Dodo, whose standing next to you, explains:  <br />
&quot;Now when someone says &#39;go&#39;, the caucus race begins and whoever makes it to the end wins.  Good luck Miss Alice.&quot;  <br />
&quot;Um, thank you.  But I thought I already said my name-&quot;  <br />
&quot;GO!&quot;  You hear someone shout, causing everyone and yourself to start running.  <br />
As you ran straight forwards, you noticed the animals were running all over the place.  Some ran in zigzags, some in curves, while others ran in circles.  This made you question whether or not you were doing this right at all.  <br />
&quot;This is absolute chaos.  No one could possibly win this race.&quot;  you said to yourself.  <br />
Suddenly someone yells out &quot;STOP&quot; and everyone stops running, you as well.  You gasp for air and realize that you were completely dry, much to your relief.  After everyone catches their breathes, Mr. Dodo gets up and speaks.  <br />
&quot;Now that what I call a caucus race, well done everyone.  But I&#39;m afraid there can be only one winner in this game.  And that winner is ... ALICE!&quot;  <br />
All the animals cheer while you stand in disbelief and joy.  <br />
&quot;What?  You mean me?  I won?&quot;  <br />
&quot;But of course you did Alice, as you were the only one who ran straight.&quot;  The Dodo tells you.  <br />
&quot;Wow.  I actually won.  I can&#39;t believe it.  So what do I win?&quot;  <br />
&quot;Well, that all depends.&quot;  <br />
&quot;On what?&quot;  <br />
&quot;If your name really is Alice.  And if I recall, you claimed that you weren&#39;t Alice.  So technically, you don&#39;t win anything.&quot;  Mr. Dodo tells you, much to your disappointment and anger.  <br />
&quot;But that&#39;s not fair.  You&#39;ve been calling me Alice since we met and you said Alice won the race.  So that means I won the race.&quot;  <br />
&quot;Are you sure?&quot;  <br />
&quot; ...What?&quot;  <br />
&quot;Are you sure your really Alice?  Because if want to be the winner, you must admit that you truly are Alice.  Do you want to be Alice?&quot;  <br />
You stand in place for several seconds.  Part of you knew it was wrong to call yourself Alice, but you also really wanted to be the winner of the caucus race.  As you thought about this, your migraine returns and you hold your head in pain.  <br />
&quot;AAHHH!  ... My head ... can&#39;t ... think ...&quot;  You yell out.  <br />
&quot;Come on kid, say your name is Alice.  DO IT NOW OR ELSE!&quot;  Mr. Dodo yells at you.  <br />
&quot;... I&#39;M ... I&#39;M ... UUUGGGHHH!&quot;  <br />
You couldn&#39;t take the pain anymore and you pass out.  <br />
<br />
You wake up and find yourself in an empty field with no one else around, barely remembering who won the caucus race.  <br />
&quot;God my head, what the hell happened?&quot;  You said out loud.  <br />
As you scan the area, you see a white sigh with black letters spelling out: W. RABBIT HOUSE THIS WAY.  <br />
&quot;Oh right, The White Rabbit.  I need to find him and get back home.&quot;  <br />
So you pick yourself off the grass and follow the sign to The White Rabbit&#39;s house.  <br />
<br />
As Marcia walked off, Mr Dodo and a cloaked figure watched her with a magic mirror in an unknown location.  <br />
&quot;I don&#39;t understand what went wrong.  I thought I had gotten to her to the point where she would accept being Alice.  Hell, even that worthless doorknob got her to say it.  How could this girl have broken free from me like that?  Mr. Dodo said.  <br />
&quot;It would seem we may have underestimated the mental powers of this Marcia Caldwell.  Manipulating her will be far more difficult than we thought.  Still though, the cracks in her mind have already formed.  We just need to keep chipping away her mental barriers and she will be ours.&quot;  The cloaked figure said.  <br />
&quot;Indeed sir.  Perhaps if you can let me try again, I know I can break throu-&quot;  <br />
&quot;NO!  She has already proven to be a match for you.  You will instead head back to the castle with the others, while The White Rabbit set a trap for our would-be Alice.  Do I make myself clear?&quot;  <br />
&quot;... Yes sir.  It will be done.&quot;  <br />
&quot;Good, now get out of my sight.&quot;  <br />
And with that, Mr. Dodo ran off while the cloaked figure continued to watch Marcia.  <br />
&quot;Soon your majesty.  She will be ours.&quot;</p>
