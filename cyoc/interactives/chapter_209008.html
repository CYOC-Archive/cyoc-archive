<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike notices the elaborate  bottle shaped like an Oriental lamp, the lid on top acting as where the oil would be placed and the long tip where the flame would come out being just a dud to decorate. Stylish, though. Mike was about to replace the lamp ion the shelf, believing it had fallen off by accident, when he accidentally rubbed it. You come out, a bit bewildered by the transformation. You looked nothing you used to. Your skin is blue, your hair black and long and you are wearing white veils that leave very little to the imagination. And your body! You body! If you still had a penis and balls, you&#39;d masturbate to it in an instant! It&#39;s got the roundest butt cheeks and the most attracting big boobs and the fullest hips. When it jiggles, it&#39;s only in those three places and in a most hypnotizing way! Wow! Mike&#39;s eyes look like balls as he takes in your sexiness. But enough of that! You need to warn him! You didn&#39;t want to stay a girl, sexy or not!<br />
&quot;Mike! It&#39;s me!&quot; you say with despair.<br />
&quot;Me who? Who are you?&quot; he asks, dumfounded.<br />
Your voice! It&#39;s all sultry and sexy even when you&#39;re pleading!<br />
&quot;It&#39;s me! Troy! I accidentally rubbed the lamp, got sucked in and became... this! Help me!&quot;<br />
Mike looked concerned indeed but he then smiled and laughed out loud.<br />
&quot;Seriously? It&#39;s you? I&#39;ll help you but... But... It&#39;s just too funny! It really is you! You&#39;re a chick! A chick!&quot;<br />
&quot;Very funny,&quot; you growl. <br />
&quot;And a super hottie too! This ass and those hooters! Even the girls we fuck at parties and the frat parties we crash in aren&#39;t as sexy as you!&quot; he chortles, laughing so much he&#39;s got tears in his eyes.<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, it&#39;s not funny. You need to help me and find the manager of that store,&quot; you say, pissed off to the max.<br />
&quot;Let me see more first,&quot; he says.<br />
He then proceeds to lift your veils to look at your crotch, pinches your ass, fondles your boobs and weighs them expertly, all the while commenting on how hot you&#39;d be to fuck. You scream in indignation but he doesn&#39;t stop. He doesn&#39;t see the urgency of the situation. On the contrary, he takes delight in touching and fondling everything he can, your protests making him laugh all the more.<br />
&quot;Oh come on, have you gone as whinny and bitchy as a real chick?&quot; he says. &quot;You never minded when you did it to girls. You must understand how I feel! Relax and enjoy! You know you want it! Touch that and be impressed!&quot;<br />
He grabs your hand and puts it right on his package. You shout in disgust and tell him to stop but he presses your right boob with a vulgar honking horn sound and as you are further indignant, he forces your hand inside his pants and makes your thin beautiful fingers rub his penis through the tissue of his boxers. Yuck! <br />
&quot;Stop! It&#39;s disgusting!&quot;<br />
&quot;You stop! Stop acting like a stupid bitch! You know you want it!&quot; he grunts.<br />
His penis, thanks to your nom long fingernails and little fingers rubbing it, is getting bigger. And harder! So revolting! Was Mike always that much of a jerk? You couldn&#39;t have been as disgusting, right? With you, girls must have had a super fun time. You were different, without a doubt. <br />
&quot;No, I don&#39;t want it!&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure you do! Like all the chicks we fucked! They all said they did not want it but they all do! They&#39;re all liars and don&#39;t want to admit they&#39;re whores, that&#39;s all! In the end, we both knew they liked our dicks! You&#39;re the same now! You knew girls loved our dicks so now you&#39;ll like getting mine in the throat, like all the others! Here touch that and you&#39;ll beg to suck it! And since I&#39;m so nice I&#39;ll let you do it!&quot; he smirked. <br />
That jerk then proceeded to make you rub and touch by force his virile member. It was starting to throb a bit and the foul wetness you could feel was definitely pre-cum. Ewww!<br />
&quot;Stop that now!&quot; you scream, slapping him on the cheek as hard as you can and pulling away. <br />
Surprised by the violence, he backed off and the ensuing silence was deafening. Yet the minute or so that it lasted allowed for the magic to finish its job. It infiltrated itself massively into your mind, the tendrils it had prodded into your brain to get you to accept new thoughts making way for a much bigger influx. You were suddenly overwhelmed by new motives and new desires. You forgot that you were a male human and became a full immortal female genie, granting wishes and wielding very powerful magic, destined to punish the wicked and reward the good through your amazing talents. However, your last thoughts as wanting to punish Mike for being such a jerk, the last coherent thought that because of his horniness you would lose yourself forever, whereas if he had gotten help from the store owner there would have still been a chance for you, Troy, to remain, leave a massive impact upon your new desires as a genie. The idea that maybe you hadn&#39;t been very correct to girls thanks to your status as a football player, now that you were the victim of one, stays. Even if you overall still kept the deceitful notion that with you, it was the exception, that all girls must have been happy to be with you and feel your penis and hands, before or after the act and that they were very happy afterwards, especially if they had said no.The wish to punish someone as jerky as Mike and the start of the realization that you were as much a rapist, jerk and self-absorbed prick as your buddy means that you intend to be a genie bent on justice. On poetic justice, in fact. Humans are stupid and cannot properly ask for the things they wish for, leading to massive loopholes to exploit. Very amusing loopholes! And a genie can very well lie too! As long as the grantee doesn&#39;t wish for the genie to speak only the truth... Things are going to get fun and interesting! Oh yes, with bad boys and naughty people you are going to be quite the mischievous genie! <br />
As you mind and tastes get replaced with new ones, you are silent and your eyes glaze over. Mike stares at you, a bit confused. As he&#39;s an inconsiderate asshole, he continues stroking his penis. He stops when you blink and look around you. When you lay your eyes on Mike, you just remember that he&#39;s a jerk and that he needs to be taught a lesson. Your past history with him had been completely forgotten. You do remember he looked at you like you were a piece of meat and nothing else than a pice of eye candy. And that he fondled you. Well, that demands a fitting retribution! Luckily, that&#39;s your specialty.<br />
&quot;Hello, master, what can I do for you?&quot; you say in a whispered sultry voice.<br />
&quot;I... I... Troy?&quot; he stammers.<br />
&quot;You must have me confused with someone else, master. I am Tulip and I grant wishes. What would please you?&quot;<br />
Well! Not only he&#39;s a disgusting sex-maniac but he also takes you for a male friend of his! A moron AND a sexist jerk! All in one!<br />
&quot;You... You grant wishes?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes. Three to be exact. Now what would be your first? Think carefully!&quot;<br />
Mike just decided to ask for what he wished for the most and was not careful at all. Or else, he would have taken two seconds to think about it.<br />
&quot;I want to be rich and surrounded by hotties! Hotties that find me adorable!&quot;<br />
Naturally, the idea of wishing his friend Troy back did not even cross his mind. You, or now Tulip, for her part, is elated. A perfect wish to teach a great lesson.<br />
&quot;You got it!&quot; you say with as much enthusiasm as Mike wears on his face.      <br />
<br />
&quot;I swear, he&#39;s adorable!&quot;<br />
&quot;Ssshh! You&#39;ll wake him up.&quot;<br />
Mike moaned. Where was he? Upon something soft but where? Where were the hotties he had asked for? Why was everything so blurry? He quickly realized he was lying down. But in a bed. He tried to speak but only moans came out. And why were his movements so jerky and weak? He could only make out a white ceiling and some limited views of furniture.<br />
And suddenly, a face appeared above him. A gigantic face, of a handsome man with longuish light brown hair.<br />
&quot;Wakey Wakey, sleepyhead!&quot; the man chanted.<br />
Two impossibly large hands scooped Mike up and raised him. That man was enormous! And only in pyjama boxers! And... Did he shave his chest? Mike was delicately pressed against that giant&#39;s chest while he was kissed and cuddled. Who was that madman? Where were the hot chicks? <br />
&quot;Did you sleep well, baby? Papa is going to give you yummy food. Today&#39;s a big day!&quot;<br />
From his new position, Mike had a a better view and saw that he was clad in a footsie and dressed like a baby. What was the big idea? And then he finally caught sight of his hands. Crunched into fist with tiny fingers and try as he might, he couldn&#39;t unfurl them. <br />
A grunt caught his attention. On the other side of the double-bed, a huge guy was sitting, his feet on the ground, already getting ready for his day, his back large and just as muscular as the rest of his body. His hair was short, and as a result of bed hair spiking up in all directions. His  cheeks were scruffy too as he turned towards you and kissed you. Yuck! And his stubble hurt too! You. made your distaste known by whimpers, cries and flailing fists.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think he like your new stubble, love,&quot; chuckled the man holding him. <br />
&quot;He did last week, though. Loved ta touch it,&quot; pondered the big guy. &quot;Just like my chest hair.&quot;<br />
&quot;Babies can&#39;t make up their minds. Everyone knows that. Don&#39;t take offense,&quot; the slimmer man said philosophically and gave Mike yet another kiss on his cheek.<br />
Again? What was with the kisses? And why was he a baby? A baby to... two married gay guys? One sported a wedding ring around his neck and the slim guy on his finger! How was that possible? What did that damn genie do to him? That wasn&#39;t his wish! Where was she? He&#39;d have a few words to tell her!<br />
<br />
The rest of the day was a series of humiliations. Annoying at best, most shameful at worst. From what Mike gathered, he was now called Hernan, and his &quot;Papa&quot; worked as a super famous writer and the other, &quot;Daddy&quot; was a training coach for all sorts of movie stars. Their house was huge and he Papa could stay at home and work there, all the while watching him. He&#39;d had to take a shower with his Papa and watch him wax his hair and endure all the kisses and hugs and cuddles of that man. Then, in the evening, there had been some guests over and he was subjugated to even more pokes, kisses and tickles. The only good part was when some hot girls had gushed at his cuteness and taken to a couch where that had &quot;taken care of him.&quot; That was much better! They all said he was the most adorable thing they had ever seen and he had a great view of their cleavages. Wow!<br />
Alas, all too soon, he was put back in his crib in the man&#39;s room because apparently, normally he&#39;s quite affectionate towards them and the party had went on without him. Only a baby monitor was there and Mike was left to fume with a mobile and soft toys for sole company. <br />
&quot;Happy with you wish, cutie pie?&quot;<br />
The genie&#39;s face appeared above him. Where did she come from? But never mind that! Mike gurgled, attempting to ask for another wish and that this was all wrong.<br />
&quot;Sorry, I can&#39;t understand baby talk,&quot; she giggled. &quot;But I can guess what you want to know. You wished for loads of money and hotties to love you. It&#39;s the case. Only the money belongs to your two daddies so you&#39;re rich, but indirectly. Perhaps when you inherit, in a long, long time. And hotties do find you adorable, except it&#39;s two men, your daddies. Or women way too old for you. The wish is granted following your terms. You just should have been a bit more precise,&quot; she adds with a cheeky wink and smile.<br />
Mike grumbles unintelligible baby sounds but the genie is not impressed at all, of course. <br />
&quot;I&#39;m not overly cruel. Soon you&#39;ll regress in mind to how you were back when you were three months old. You&#39;ll be the same, you&#39;ll just live under different circumstances, that&#39;s all. Another life with the same mind. Hopefully, you&#39;ll be a better person and you&#39;ll be taught to be more respectful towards women. More tolerant towards others in general too, and not an obnoxious jock. Luckily, your daddies shall keep an eyes on you and impose some rules and directions with supervision for you.&quot;<br />
She left, leaving a mortified Mike behind. He knew that as soon as he fell asleep he&#39;d loose himself. But the need and desire to sleep for an infant like him was imperious and soon enough he was sleeping peacefully, dreaming of hugs, kisses and plushies. The genie left a big soft teddy bear in his usual room down the corridor and a box of toy dinosaurs too. She wondered who her next customer would be.<br />
<br />
Back in the store, the wizard in charge of it picked up the lamp. This had turned out better than he would have thought at first. The fact that the youngster named Troy had been himself absorbed by the lamp and not made it absorb someone else meant that anyone rubbing that lamp would get three wishes and no one an unlimited number. t would make a very good sale still. And that other young man had deserved his fate thanks to his hasty wish. Humans... Always the same... He set up the price of the lamp at 69.00$ and waited for other costumers. As for Tulip she made herself some mint tea inside her lamp and went back to slumbering. Dealing out justice with magical wishes was fun!</p>
