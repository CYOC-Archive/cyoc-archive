<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Oh by dod I can&#39;d liv dike dis! SNORT!&quot;<br />
Kyle remembered his words to this day. He still remembered the shock and humiliation at seeing his new two-legged sow form in the mirror. He figured his life was over. And, for the first two weeks or so, he acted that way. He sat in his room with the lights off, refusing to see anybody. He just prayed over and over again, &quot;Oh, blease, Dod, bage be DORBAL again!&quot; But nothing changed.<br />
Finally, one day his older brother Ralph came in and had a long talk with him. He basically told him he was sorry this happened, but there was nothing anybody could do about it. Their family wasn&#39;t rich, by any means, but they would do anything within their power to help Kyle adjust to this strange new life. Kyle, though, would have to stop feeling sorry for himself and just &quot;man up... okay, SOW up,&quot; and deal with the situation as it was.<br />
Kyle, after thinking long and hard, realized his brother was right. Why let that bastard Rich have the last laugh? He&#39;d just have to take his new life as it comes. <br />
So, because spells like this were becoming more and more common, a whole cottage industry had sprung up to deal with the inconveniences their victims experienced. Kyle and his family were very surprised that Playtex had dealt with this situation many times, and had developed a unique garment for multibreasted piggy girls. It consisted of four bras sewn one under the other, and custom fitted to each customer. It was pricey, but at least Kyle could now walk the streets without jiggling so much he was in danger of falling over.<br />
Next, they commissioned a custom seamstress whose specialty was the SSBBWs in our midst, who proceeded to make a whole wardrobe of comfortable and flattering outfits that Kyle could wear on any occasion. Any occasion that a pig might be invited to. <br />
Next, they got him speech therapy, and after many gruelling sessions he could speak plainly without sounding like a, ahhh... MENTALLY CHALLENGED pig girl. No reason to insult others with issues and challenges now that I&#39;m challenged myself, reasoned Kyle. He continued to oink, grunt, snort and squeal (he was still a pig, after all), but only when it was appropriate to the conversation.<br />
Finally, after much searching the web, they found someone to make him a sort of gripping glove to fit over the trotters on the ends of his arms, so he could feed himself and even pick up a pen to write.<br />
These, and other adaptations including an industrial-strength toilet/bidet, allowed him to live, if not a NORMAL life, to at least make his way through the world as well as he could.<br />
And then, one day, he realized he wasn&#39;t feeling sorry for himself anymore. Slowly, over the past couple of months he had embraced his new piggy identity, and was even beginning to have fun with it! He never would have imagined this, but he found he was even attracting quite the bevy of suitors. Some of them were just into really heavy girls, and the ears, snout and curly tail were just an added twist. So to speak. Others were just after a little &quot;strange&quot; (okay, a LOT strange), and still others... well... they had issues. You could tell now relieved they were that they could finally openly date one of their &quot;type&quot; because she could walk on two legs and give verbal consent.<br />
He was dating one of the latter type at the moment, because, outside of his piggy hangup, he was actually a sweet guy with a great sense of humor. You would have to develop as sense of humor, too, thought Kyle, if your parents had named you Kermit. Honestly, what were they thinking? No wonder their son had issues!<br />
So, anyway, one day Kyle took stock and decided, all things considered, his life wasn&#39;t all that bad.<br />
Now, he had two choices:<br />
One, he could&#39;ve embraced the old adage, living well is the best revenge.<br />
Or two, he could do what he did, which was to seek out Rich, show him how well he was doing, and rub his face in it. Not a wise choice, in hindsight.<br />
So it was that one day he dolled himself up in his best outfit, made himself up to the nines, and strutted his perky swinish self over to see Rich.<br />
Rich hadn&#39;t given Kyle much thought since the change, and figured he was still cowering in the basement or something. It was all the more shocking then, to see Kyle, looking for all the world like a vision from the Muppet Show, sashaying toward him in front of all of his friends.<br />
Rich just stood there, his jaw on the floor, as Kyle sidled right up to him.<br />
&quot;Ri-i-i-ch,&quot; cooed Kyle in his sweetest contralto.<br />
&quot;Ummm... Y-yess?&quot; stuttered Rich&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got something to TELL yo-o-ou-u-u!&quot; crooned Kyle.<br />
&quot;What... what is it?&quot; said Rich, now thoroughly baffled.<br />
A pause.<br />
&quot;OINK, OINK, MOTHERF***ERRRRR!&quot; screamed Kyle, as he kneed Rich in the nuts.<br />
Again, not the best move under the circumstances.<br />
That night, Kyle slept better than he had in months. And better than he would again in a good long while.<br />
As soon as he woke up the next morning, he knew something was very wrong.<br />
He tried to turn over in bed, and found his body was having trouble responding. Terrified, he opened his eyes.<br />
&quot;Oh by DOD! NOOOOOO!&quot;<br />
He was still a pig, all right. Pretty much an actual pig.<br />
He now had four stubby legs, a cylindrical body, no neck... he was pretty much an actual sow now. A real quadrupedal piggy girl!<br />
Amazingly, he could still talk, though again much more like a ahh... DEVLOPMENTALLY DELAYED pig girl, but that was small comfort.<br />
Then things began to happen very quickly.<br />
Kyle&#39;s whole family rushed to his bedroom, saw his new predicament, and hit compassion fatigue. <br />
A son who was a two-legged sow was one thing, but this was basically a barnyard animal. They knew the zoning laws would never allow them to keep Kyle, and they didn&#39;t much relish the prospect anyway.<br />
So it was that they made a deal with an organic farm upstate. Kyle would now be their new brood sow, and would spend the rest of his life birthing and suckling piglets.<br />
<br />
One day, a few months later, as he lay in dumb ecstasy while the kiddos nibbled and sucked on each one of his eight nipples, he finally realized his old prayer had been answered. He was no longer a freak. He was normal again.<br />
<br />
A perfectly normal brood sow.</p>
