<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Erin pulled out what almost looked like a high chair for adults, and set their meal.  &quot;I can tell you about myself while we eat,&quot; she says, as she serves the salad into his bowl. &quot;And if you like, I can give you a ride around a path some people don&#39;t take in the park,&quot; she adds, &quot;something I do enjoy.&quot; John wasn&#39;t just being polite, but was enjoying the salad, and was happy to keep listening as she talked.  As John eats his salad, she continued, &quot;sorry, I&#39;m just so used to being like this, I don&#39;t even stop to think anymore that I was ever different.&quot;<br />
<br />
John was curious, &quot;So, you weren&#39;t always a centauress, or was there some other change?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s like this.  I was in college.  A girl was rumored to be in a family of witches.  She was aloof, snotty, had a major attitude problem, and a temper to match.  The rumor was that a guy tried to attack her, and he disappeared the same night.  The other rumor was this wasn&#39;t the first time, and she was the youngest in a family of witches.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As stories go, it&#39;s different, but can&#39;t argue with you standing in front of me that something must have happened.  So, you did something to upset her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Intentionally. &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Intentionally?  Really?&#39;&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Intentionally.  Really.  She had been a total jerk to a couple of guys in my class, including friends.  Then some girlfriends I had at the school mentioned she was a bit tough to take and was making threats.  Really wacky stuff, none of it could be believed until you had that information about her being a witch and actually using it on people.  Until that point, I never had any idea I could get transformed.  It was always just fantasy, then suddenly it seemed possible, so I decided if she could be so bad in her way, I was perfectly within my rights to try to get her to use it for me.  And someone needed at least to confront her about her bad attitude.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And, obviously, it worked!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, no, it didn&#39;t.  I goaded her about how she treated others, and she called me a bitch.  Then turned me into one.  Not how I was expecting it would go.  No fun.  One second I was me, the next I was this dog.  She made a gesture, and it was done in an instant.  She didn&#39;t know her parents were using a camera to keep an eye on her after hearing some of the rumors themselves.  They saved me from literally living my life as a dog.  They&#39;re also very nice people, and they have no clue how their daughter turned out with that attitude of hers.  But, they basically apologized, told me I could choose to be anything I wanted, and I chose this.  Which is what I was after in the first place.  They told me any time I wanted to use their knowledge in the future, for anything, I only had to ask.  That even means taking lessons, even though I can&#39;t think I have their affinity for it.  But, they gladly gave me exactly what I wanted, and we&#39;ve become friends.  I just don&#39;t think anymore about it; this is just who I am and who I&#39;ve always wanted to be.&quot;  Erin noticed that John had stopped chewing, and was just listening and looking into her eyes.  &quot;As far as blind dates go, I hope this isn&#39;t just weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve had worse, even if you measure by the standards of others.  But, so far, I&#39;m amazed how well this is going.  I&#39;ve got someone open and honest who is starting things out by sharing things I wouldn&#39;t expect another person would even allow to be seen in public, and talking to me like a person, not just a sex object or an inferior or someone different.  I&#39;m also surprised you mention going out to eat...I mean, I&#39;d think you would be noticed more than a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, well, my friends have made it so outside my house, it&#39;s a little more difficult for people to wrap their heads around the whole situation, so people tend not to make a scene.  They&#39;re only aware if I make them aware, like what I&#39;m doing now.  I just don&#39;t think much about it.  And, I get around really well with this body.  It&#39;s one of a great many perks.&quot;<br />
<br />
John was silent for a moment, then said, &quot;you know, I&#39;m a bit jealous...a really gorgeous girl, offering to give me a ride, self-confident but just comfortable with herself and comforable to be with.  I&#39;m feeling lucky to be here.  I&#39;ve no idea why you&#39;d need a blind date when you should be turning dozens of heads and have anyone around you&#39;d want to be with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to be with someone.  I&#39;ve always been a bit clumsy about relationships.  A friend told me enough about you, and I thought I&#39;d like you.  So far, she&#39;s been right.  I&#39;d like to get to know you.&quot;  Erin took a token mouthful of the salad, trying to give John a chance to talk.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;d be more comfortable if I could run at your speed and take that jog with you.  Riding my date, well, that seems a bit intimate, in the context of a ride in the park.  And I have to admit you have attributes that are tempting, so it would probably be a bit stimulating as well.  I guess that&#39;s a hazard of me being a guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re flattering me just by telling me you think of me so much as a girl, not a horse, not a freak, not a mindless animal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a girl.  None of those other things.  Why should I treat you any other way?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our friend was right.  You make me feel good.&quot;</p>
