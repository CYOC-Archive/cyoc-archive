<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">*Cuckoo! Cuckoo!*<br />
<br />
*Cuckoo! Cuckoo!*<br />
<br />
Jennifer woke up to the sound of a Cuckoo clock. With a groggy moan, she fumbled around in the empty air for the source of the sound, which turned out to be a novelty alarm clock. She shut off the alarm, and pushed herself up into a sitting position. With a stretch and a yawn, she attempted to rouse herself from her drowsy state of mind. Her eyes were still trying to adjust, so everything looked a bit blurry. She rubbed the sleep out of her eyes and cleared her vision.<br />
<br />
What she saw next made her shoot out of bed. She ended up jumping so high into the air that her head hit the ceiling. Like, no, that literally happened. There was even an over-the-top *bonk* sound effect and everything. And when she fell to the ground, there were cartoon-y sound effects to accompany that too. What did she see that made her jump so high? Easy, a clown!<br />
<br />
A CLOWN!<br />
<br />
Jennifer had a prominent case of coulrophobia ever since she was young. Clowns were the most terrifying thing she could think of. She considered them evil, inhuman creatures who liked to devour the souls of little kids. It was for this reason that she distrusted Ronald McDonald, could not sit through It... like at ALL... and despised Red Nose Day. So here she was, trapped in her bedroom with a clown, her worst nightmare! She wanted to kill Kyle for this.<br />
<br />
She waited for the clown to approach her... for something to happen... but nothing did. Confused, she looked around the room again. There wasn&#39;t a clown anywhere in sight. Of course, her room was looking a bit more brightly colored than usual. The color scheme focused on pure white, electric green, highlighter yellow, and florescent pink. It was as if everything in here were centered around these colors. Even her pajamas matched the theme in here. The pink and green hues went well together, and it felt comfortable and natural on her pure white skin.<br />
<br />
Wait, pure white skin?<br />
<br />
Jen started to sweat and hyperventilate. She ran over to a mirror and saw the very thing she dreaded. She didn&#39;t just see a clown in her bedroom, she WAS the clown in her bedroom! She had wavy, bright, highlighter yellow hair that ran down her back, electric green blush circles on her powder white cheeks, and a big, round, bulbous florescent pink clown nose. Her eyes looked bigger than before, but instead were a natural pale blue. The rest of her body sported exaggerated proportions. For example, her boobs were each as big and round as basketballs, and they seemed to keep their gravity defying shape even without a bra. Her nipples were puffed up to the size of grapes, and they were poking tents in her top. Her waist pinched in like a wasp&#39;s, and her hips were about as wide as her shoulders. She also had a big, round fanny to match, with butt cheeks the size of ripe cantaloupes, and her thighs paired well with them. Her hands were nearly double their original size, and her feet were well over double in length.<br />
<br />
Jennifer&#39;s hyperventilation began to worsen, but then suddenly, she stopped. It was like a switch went off in her head that made her realize how unreasonably she was acting about this. She had always been a sexy clown, and she knew it too. Why, would anyone other than a clown have beautiful and funny gazongas like hers? Of course not! Clown tits ruled! Besides that, her eyes were never a pale blue. They were electric green, just like her cheek blushes, her nails, her lipstick, her left nipple (the right one was bright pink), and the inside of her mouth (except her tongue was also bright pink)! Why would they be any color other than green? She was being sillier than usual, that&#39;s all. Nothing to get worked up over, nothing to be scared about.<br />
<br />
Jennifer, certain that everything was as normal as abnormal could be, decided to change into her daytime clothes. Her outfit for today went as follows: yellow blouse that exposed her midriff, green and pink short-sleeved jacket that did the same, white gloves for her hands, a pair of green balloon pants that ended above her knees, a pink belt with a yellow buckle, pink knee-socks, and green tennis shoes. She didn&#39;t need to wear her panties today, and she never needed bras, so she was all ready to go!<br />
<br />
That would be the case, had it not been for the fact that the switch went off in her head again, as her eyes went from electric green to pale blue. She felt like she&#39;d suddenly blacked out for a couple minutes. Jennifer got a good look at her outfit, and was scared frozen. She wasn&#39;t wearing pajamas anymore. She was wearing clothes. They looked like a clown version of trendy fashion. Therefore they were a perversion of one of her favored pastimes, and all the more reason to be scared shittless right now.<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn&#39;t happening,&quot; she told herself. At least her voice sounded normal, so that was actually quite helpful. &quot;This isn&#39;t happening. This ISN&#39;T happening. This is all just one big bad dream and you&#39;re going to wake up any moment now. C&#39;mon, Jen! Wake up!&quot; She slapped herself in the face a couple times. Nope, still a clown. She pinched her arm as hard as she could. Nothing was changing. She banged her head into the wall, each time with a cartoony sound effect to accompany it. No dice.<br />
<br />
Then, the switch went off again, and her eyes turned electric green. What was silly old Jennifer doing, banging her noggin against the wall? Trying to make another door or expand her room a bit more? Besides, it&#39;s not like this were a bad dream or anything. Just silly old real life, nothing to worry about. Also, why would she be pinching her arm if her nose were the better option? She gave it a couple squeezes and the familiar *honk-honk* her nose made made her giggle. Her voice was higher pitched than it was a minute ago, which was strange because wasn&#39;t this supposed to be her regular voice? She&#39;d better give it a test, just to be sure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Testin&#39; one-two, one-two,&quot; she said aloud in an exaggerated New Jersey accent. Yup, just as silly and squeaky as usual. Of course, just to be sure, she said, &quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs. The five boxing wizards jump quickly.&quot; Yup, her voice was absolutely as normal as abnormal could be! She was worried about nothing after all!<br />
<br />
*But why would Jennifer&#39;s mind be switching back and forth like this? How did Kyle Perkins achieve this, and is there any way she can take him down so she can get back home? Is there even a point in me doing this hype up narration if the viewers will be able to write their own installment? Find out next time on another exciting episode of TRANSFORM OR DARE!*</p>
