<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Troy chatted with Clint as his body morphed and shifted, claws popping, hands widening, pads appearing on his palm. His back shifted and widened as muscles spread his shoulders apart, unfolding like wings. Rusty watched Troy stretch his arms and bounce on his toes as his legs shifted and bulked and his shoes changed to accommodate the new paws.<br />
<br />
Fur, striped on the back and cream on the front, spread across his body like a wildfire. Troy didn’t seem to notice, though his claws did scratch his side. More muscle came in, but less bulky. A far cry from the tigerman Troy had shifted into earlier. This build, the one Rusty had given him, was muscled, sure, but more defined, save for the potbelly that persisted despite all the changes. Less of an emphasis on bodybuilder and more…on someone looking fit. He had great pecs, the muscles bulging, but none of the muscles compared to Troy’s ass. It bubbled up and stuck out wide behind him.<br />
<br />
Even Clint would glance at it occasionally. It wasn’t freakishly large, but it was a clear focus in Troy’s workouts and obviously Troy’s best new feature, if Rusty said so himself. And he did. Usually while pinching it. Rusty smirked at the memory.<br />
<br />
The biggest change was the outfit. Troy clearly enjoyed showing off the goods-his gym clothes warped and shifted into a very tight tank-top and equally tight shorts. Rusty could see Troy’s pink jockstrap peeking out of his pants. A hole for his tail formed quickly followed by the aforementioned tiger tail slithering out.<br />
<br />
As the changes finished up, Rusty moved to go out and embrace his new boyfriend when a wave of dizziness engulfed him. He stumbled back onto the couch and plopped down, feeling oddly exhausted. Was this what the book meant by a little energy? He tossed the book onto the table.<br />
<br />
Troy entered the room and noticed him sprawled on the couch. His eyes shifted from him to the leather-bound book.<br />
<br />
“You use the book, babe?” Troy’s muzzle wrinkled in confusion.<br />
<br />
Rusty giggled. “So you can’t tell, huh?”<br />
<br />
Troy’s eyes widened. He realized Rusty must have changed him somehow. Reality shift. But how? He glanced down. Well-muscled, striped fur shaved back in a few places by the professional anthro salon he went to that emphasized his muscles and glorious ass. He ran a hand through his immaculate hair. Daddy Rusty kept him well-groomed and in return Troy kept his body maintained and the house cleaned for him. <br />
<br />
They’d been boyfriends since childhood, but hadn’t really exposed their true feelings until that beautiful night at the prom. Sure, Rusty was a few years older than him, but he was willing to wait for him to turn 18 and never dated another guy the whole time. Rusty was truly faithful, a quality in a lover that Troy understood few gays ever experienced. When anthrotherapy came out, he begged Rusty to let him become a tigerman. Rusty relented, but he was forced to apply at the police academy and undergo anthrotherapy himself to obtain the right contacts to let Troy get something so exotic.<br />
<br />
“Did you…change my species?” Troy giggled back. “If Daddy Rusty wants me to be a big, scary, pussy cat, then I guess that’s what I’ll be.”<br />
<br />
Troy gave a mock snarl and nuzzled Rusty. Rusty stroked his head. Troy felt himself rumble out a purr. No wonder it felt like this was the first time he’d ever purred. He could only wonder what he’d been before. A housecat anthro? No. Maybe another dog? He felt a pinch on his well-padded ass and gave a cute little mew.<br />
<br />
“Put your hand on the book and find out.” Rusty replied with a cocky smirk.<br />
<br />
“Oh, is that how it works? Did you get your memories…” Troy trailed off and cold horror roiled in his stomach as the full realization of what Rusty implied hit him. “Your memories of…of..”<br />
<br />
“Oh, so you can break through the reality change with the right memories, eh?” Rusty chuckled and forced the book into Troy hands.<br />
<br />
Troy reeled as soon as he touched the book, his old reality snapping back. He felt blood dribble out of his nose. Rusty dabbed at it, which Troy happily accepted. He loved being doted on by his sweet daddy-<br />
<br />
He shook his head. No! He was not some lovesick homo, he was straight, he’d kissed Amanda at the Prom, Rusty was Dustin and Rosco. And Rusty was a cheating dog, not the most perfect boyfriend with a sexy cop uniform he’d sometimes fuck him roughly in during roleplaying sessions. His overweight partner-a cute bear named Leonard-would sometimes join in and Troy would get to suck him off while Rusty fucked his ass. He was the luckiest kitty in the whole-worl-<br />
<br />
Troy shook his head and dropped the book. “It’s not real. This isn’t real.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, it&#39;s real alright. Did you really think you could alter reality without a price?” Rusty tisked. “If you’d released the command on me and then shifted me a few seconds later, not only wouldn’t I have been able to stop you, but I would never have become your boyfriend.”<br />
<br />
Troy sat down next to his boyf-his roommate, who promptly threw an arm around him and snuggled him close. He tried to escape, but another part of him-a strong part of him-enjoyed the closeness. The smell of his boyfriend. The light musk of his armpit, the smell of his breath-minty!-and further down, a hot musk wafted lightly from his groin. The last made his mouth water. Delicious hot cock-<br />
<br />
He pulled back and wrenched himself out of Rusty’s grasp, scrambling back to his feet. “Make it stop.”<br />
<br />
Rusty raised a furred brow. “How?”<br />
<br />
“Change me back!” Troy shouted.<br />
<br />
Rusty shook his head. “Damage is done, bae. I could change you back, change us both back, but we’d still be gay.”<br />
<br />
“Please. I’ll lift the command.” Troy begged, his tail whisking behind him. “I’ll do anything.”<br />
<br />
Rusty thought for a moment. “You need me to change you back without your knowledge so reality shifts. I need you to remove my command. That’s how you think things stand, right?”<br />
<br />
Troy nodded.<br />
<br />
“Except, Troy, I love you. I don’t want this to change. And the longer you stay like this, the more settled in you’ll get. It’s easy to forget the old reality. So I’ll make you a bet.”<br />
<br />
“I agree.” Troy said. “Anything.”<br />
<br />
Rusty smirked and his tail wagged. “I’m so happy to hear you say that! The terms, then. Let me fuck you. If you want me to change you back afterwards, I will. Done.”<br />
<br />
Troy felt his dick harden at the thought of Rusty fucking him but he forced the horniness away. “Ok…but Rusty, bro, I don’t care how thicc that dick is, it’s not going to change my mind.”<br />
<br />
“Wrong. Your mind can only choose one version of events. You think that only the old reality is valid. It’s not. They’re both valid, and you are in this reality. My bet is, by the time you cum, all you’ll be is my sexy tigerman boifriend.”<br />
<br />
“Why would I take that bet, then?” Troy asked.<br />
<br />
“You can win. All you have to do is pretend to enjoy it and let your mind go blank. Go with the flow. You can do that, right?”<br />
<br />
“So just…let you fuck me and think nothing of it? Is that possible?”<br />
<br />
“Women did it to me all the time. Believe me, it’s not only possible, it’s common. ” Rusty snorted. &quot;But I&#39;ll give you fair warning. If you fight back you&#39;ll lose yourself. Just deadfish me. Easy, right?&quot; <br />
<br />
Troy  nodded. “Deadfish. Got it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rusty extended a hand. &quot;So it&#39;s a deal then?”<br />
<br />
Troy considered the paw carefully. He had no choice. He couldn’t trust Rusty otherwise. He shook it.<br />
<br />
Rusty grinned and pulled Troy&#39;s shirt off. “Oh, kept the belly. Odd.”<br />
<br />
Troy grimaced. “Book of Beast, not Body.”<br />
<br />
Rusty clapped his ass. &quot;More cushion for the pushin’. I&#39;ll just make sure you hit the treadmills. Let’s go.”<br />
<br />
“W-wait-!” Troy stammered as Rusty pushed him into the bedroom, ripping off his own shirt in the process.<br />
<br />
“Goddamn those cheeks are clappable.” Rusty panted. “I’ve outdone myself.”<br />
<br />
“Rusty, come on, I’m not-” Troy protested but Rusty licked and nibbled at his ear and he swooned. “Oooh…”<br />
<br />
“Shh, it’s going to be alright,” Rusty unbuckled Troy’s belt and let his pants drop. The underwear dropped next, and left Troy’s prickly feline maleness bob in the air. “You’re a big, sexy tiger man. You&#39;ve got nothing to be worried about.”<br />
<br />
“It’s just that I-I don’t think it’s a good idea to get intimate right now. Like right this minute. We can wait until later. There’s a party-.”<br />
<br />
“Let’em listen,” Rusty smirked and dropped his own pants. <br />
<br />
The scent of musky dog filled the room. Troy’s nose twitched and he felt himself staring at the cock and drooling. He shook his head to clear the image of himself deep throating that luscious red cock. His memories said he’d choked that beer-can thick rocket down numerous times, but the old him recoiled at the thought.<br />
<br />
Rusty closed the distance and kissed Troy on the mouth.<br />
<br />
Troy pushed at Rusty’s shoulders to get him away, clenched his mouth shut, but Rusty leaned in, insistent. Troy could feel Rusty’s tongue probe his teeth but he refused to let it in. Then Rusty leaned down and kneaded Troy’s ass. Troy felt his cock grow strangely harder. Did he...enjoy this?<br />
<br />
And then Rusty slipped a finger in Troy’s ass. Troy gasped and Rusty took advantage to slip his tongue in. Troy tried to fight it off, but what began with a fight ended with him moaning. The digit was stroking something in him, something that made him melt into Rusty’s arms.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, there we go. You can try to fight me all you want, but at the end of the day you’re a needy bottom, huh?” <br />
<br />
Rusty broke the kiss long enough to rip his own shirt off and then slowly, gently, lowered Troy onto the bed. Troy felt his legs splay wide automatically, like he’d done this a thousand times and memories that danced at the edge of his consciousness said he had.<br />
<br />
“I’m going to take you now, Troy. You’re so lucky. It’ll be just like the first time to you.” Rusty murmured into Troy&#39;s ear.<br />
<br />
“W-wait, what about lube?” Troy sputtered.<br />
<br />
Rusty chuckled and reached over to the side table and activated a tall plastic barrel-shaped dispenser. Clear gel spooled into his padded palm. Troy blinked. He’d never owned a-<br />
<br />
He gasped as Rusty lathered the cool gel between his furry cheeks. Another spool of gel coated his fingers and he inserted them smoothly into Troy’s big furry ass. Troy felt his tail twitch to the side, as though to welcome a lover. He tried to relax, enjoy it. No! Not enjoy, just deadfish...he stifled a moan as Rusty&#39;s padded and well-lubed fingers rubbed a spot inside him. He...he was just supposed to enjoy it, right? He was sure there was something more to it than not fighting but every time he got close to remembering their conversation Rusty&#39;s fingers would light up his pleasure center and he&#39;d just feel more and more relaxed. Something about not fighting it.<br />
<br />
All he had to do was pretend nothing was wrong, go with the flow, say whatever Rusty wanted, and he’d keep his original-straight-personality. That was until he fully appreciated the true size of Rusty’s cock five seconds later. There had to be almost twelve inches of thick dog cock at his entrance, which Rusty rubbed up and down Troy’s hole <br />
<br />
Troy flinched and tried to close his legs. <br />
<br />
“No fighting, Troy. You don’t want to end up my needy butt slut, right?” Rusty chuckled.<br />
<br />
“M-maybe fucking was a bad idea.” Troy’s ears lay against his head, “Your dick is so big.”<br />
<br />
“We had a bet, buddy.” Rusty stroked his dick and rubbed a thumb along the tip. A big dollop of pre drooled from it and Rusty played with it, absent-mindedly rubbing it between his thumb and forefinger. “You’re right, though. This was a very bad idea. If you allowed those memories in, you would have known what this bet was.”<br />
<br />
Troy swallowed, his cock now flaccid. “What’s that?”<br />
<br />
“A trap.” Rusty kissed him again. <br />
<br />
Troy felt the tip of Rusty’s thick red cock circle his entrance. Instead of the uncomfortable tightness he expected, Troy felt his anus attempt to open every time that big beautiful cock got close to penetration. The cock would enter, slide in half an inch and his ring would try to suck it all the way.<br />
<br />
“Huuuuh,” Troy moaned, his eyes locked on Rusty’s.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, you want this cock in you, don’t you puss?” Rusty teased and gave his hips a buck.<br />
<br />
The big red rocket slid in a few glorious inches before it withdrew and left Troy gasping. He tried to resist, knowing full well he shouldn&#39;t. He tried to clench down, to stop it, but his ass just felt so empty. He needed that cock in him.<br />
<br />
“P-please…” Troy gasped as Rusty gave another little buck and bumped something deep inside him. His cock had become fully engorged and now it began to drool precum on his creamy furred belly. He knew he shouldn’t want it, that it should feel uncomfortable-and it did, but the feeling was a distant second to the fullness his body yearned for. There wasn’t any pain at all.<br />
<br />
“Please what?” Rusty smiled cockily, his sharp canines exposed.<br />
<br />
Troy gasped as Rusty slid in another inch, his ring stretching to accept its inhuman girth despite his attempts to clamp down on the intruder. Another hit on that strange organ inside him that made his cock twitch and spit. He tried to stop the words that tumbled from his mouth.<br />
<br />
“F-fuck me.” Troy begged. It&#39;s what Rusty wanted and he was supposed to go with the flow. It felt so good too.<br />
<br />
“My pleasure,” Rusty grinned and grabbed Troy’s head and pulled him forward, Troy&#39;s elastic feline spine giving him a perfect view of Rusty&#39;s cock and forced him to watch that cock slide in another inch with no resistance at all, “Look at what a little slut you are.”<br />
<br />
Troy’s eyes widened as Rusty’s huge red pole impale him. It felt unreal, no way he could take something of that length and girth. And yet, with deliberate slowness, Rusty shoved it further in. Each inch that easily-oh so easily-slid in had Troy’s cock twitching and spitting until the base of Rusty’s knot bumped his ring. Troy stared in shock and disbelief...and a blooming pleasure.<br />
<br />
“Your ass is mine. You want this knot, don’t you puss?&quot; Rusty rolled his hips and Troy gasped. “Look at your hole, Troy. It’s spasming. Bet you feel empty. You want this doggy knot? Want me to stretch that needy hole, dump a load in you, pretty kitty?”<br />
<br />
Troy clenched his jaw, he felt so full-the cock was so big-but he wanted more. Needed more. Needed to be absolutely filled. Going with the flow never felt so-gah! Good. He let out a breathy sigh and nodded. As he accepted his place as Rusty’s slut, a major piece of resistance in him crumbled. And then Rusty slammed his cock into him.<br />
<br />
Troy mewled like a kitten at the sensation. He felt so full, so breathless. His arms wrapped around Rusty’s hips and he bucked back. Rusty grinned, pulled back, left Troy to gasp and moan, then hilted him past the knot to the balls again.<br />
<br />
Precum spurted from Troy’s untouched cock. He moaned, tears of joy and pleasure trickled down his face. His anal ring was stretched so wide by Rusty&#39;s veiny girth. His boyfriend, he thought, and another spurt of pre dribbled from his cock.<br />
<br />
“I lov-” Troy cut himself off. He had to resist...but he couldn&#39;t, it was so good. Or wait, he was supposed to go with the flow?<br />
<br />
“It’s okay babe. Give in. When you cum, you aren’t going to be Troy the roommate, you’re going to be Troy, my needy tiger butt slut.” Rusty leaned forward and whispered in Troy’s ear, “Your name isn’t on the lease anymore in this reality, by the way. Just mine. You’re nothing but a thicc-assed trick, Troy.”<br />
<br />
Troy moaned and Rusty began to fuck him in earnest, his hips roiled and bucked and Troy’s pillowy bubble-butt rippled and clapped in response. He felt so dirty, so used, so full. He could feel every throb of that big red spire inside him and though he tried to resist even now his ass just seemed to open to accept it. He could feel the old Troy die within him. It felt almost physical, each thrust, each spurt of pre-cum made the old image of himself as a mildly successful straight man crumble and this new, needy bottom take his place. He could feel his memories slip away like a dream, the new reality’s version of events taking their place.<br />
<br />
Rusty’s cock pounded his prostate repeatedly, like he knew exactly where it was and hit every time. Troy’s toes curled, claws extended and retracted in. He could feel something build deep inside him. He desperately tried to hold on to the old him, to ignore the growing urge to surrender himself and be fucked into a blissful orgasm. H-he should, right? Go with the flow, let Daddy fuck him right.<br />
<br />
Troy shook the thought away. A part of him knew it was already over, but he clung to his last memory, his first kiss at prom with…with…what had been a pretty blonde human named Amanda was replaced with a handsome pre-anthro Rusty. Troy shook his head. No, that was, he never...Rusty slammed into his prostate again and again. That sad kiss he’d gotten from Amanda at the end of prom was forgotten, replaced with a years-long culmination of desire when Rusty had finally taken him home and fucked him properly. Troy broke. He couldn’t resist, there was nothing left. The pleasure wouldn’t stop until he…he…<br />
<br />
“Rusty, I-I’m, I’m gonna…” Troy panted and chuffed. He could taste their sex in the air and it drove him wild. Always had.<br />
<br />
“What are you?”<br />
<br />
“Y-your slutty tiger boyfriend,” Troy mewled and wondered why he’d ever thought otherwise.<br />
<br />
“And what am I?”<br />
<br />
Troy could feel his balls roil and tense against his thigh.”Y-you’re a…”<br />
<br />
“Yeah?”<br />
<br />
He felt waves of warmth radiate from his hole, “M-my-”<br />
<br />
Rusty wrapped him in his arms and with a squelch, slammed him down one last time onto his knot. There was a pop as it locked in. Troy’s claws gripped Rusty’s back and felt him as he thrust relentlessly at his prostate. Troy tried to hold back one last time, but he couldn&#39;t, Rusty was so hot, his muscles flexing under his grip. He felt his asshole clench and spasm as his orgasm hit.<br />
<br />
“You’re a g-good b-boyfriend, daddy.” Troy squealed and ropes of cum shot from his tip and coated Rusty’s chest fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re goddamn right.&quot; Rusty growled and then clutched Troy to his muscled chest as he shuddered in orgasm, filling Troy up with a thick load of cum like the needy slut he was.<br />
<br />
They panted and basked in the after glow. <br />
<br />
Troy felt Rusty pull out of him with a wet plop, knot and all, forcing another load out of Troy as it squeezed past his battered prostate. That would have been painful a few years ago, but his ass had been so thoroughly stretched by his handsome puppy dog that it didn’t bother him anymore. Rusty smiled and collapsed onto the bed next to him.<br />
<br />
“I love you, Rusty.” Troy purred, his paw on Rusty’s, rubbing it.<br />
<br />
Rusty leaned over and kissed him. “Love you too, Troy.”<br />
<br />
Troy cuddled next to Rusty and couldn’t imagine his life any other way.</p>
