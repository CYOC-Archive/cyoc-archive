<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Erica had trotted ahead of the slower girls, trying to catch up to the shape of Rachel before the petulant runner&#39;s form was lost in the mist. She quickened her pace, gliding over the narrow trail as the long shadows grew longer and longer. Erica was no match for Rachel when it came to running, but she didn&#39;t think it was a good idea for her friend to get separated from the group. It wasn&#39;t that Erica was especially out of shape, in fact her time dancing helped keep her in good form even after she had hit her growth spurt. Now at 18, she had shot up lately, encouraging her rather serious gymnastics teacher to drop her, gently encouraging her to find a new pathway. Erica had felt only a little betrayed, but she got over it quickly. Many of her friends admired this about her, but sometimes it seemed a little worrying. How easily she moved past disappointment, betrayal and abuse. It all just seemed to slide off of her.<br />
<br />
She stood out a bit at school, even if being a senior now afforded her some protection from those who would make fun of her. She had a strong jaw and a long nose. For a long time she had let people call her witch, letting it fall off of her. In her opinion, better they call her that than many of the other options. She had never really filled out much, with narrow hips and a chest that was nearly as flat as Jill&#39;s. Her hoody and jeans were a little warm in the late summer evening, sweat trickling down her back as she tried once more to lengthen her stride and catch up with Rachel.<br />
<br />
It made no difference. The longer the shadows around her, the further the distance between her and Rachel. At last, panting, curly brown hair held to her neck by sweat, she started to slow down to a jog, then a walk. A touch of anxiety and even fear as she looked back, but there was no sign of her other four friends. She was alone, excluded again. She let it not bother her, taking a deep breath and walking forward. The moon was just beginning to rise and the flashlight app on her phone filled out the rest. Her stomach growled loudly as she stepped over a low root and she grimaced. She&#39;d just eaten, hadn&#39;t she? <br />
<br />
As she considered rummaging around in her backpack the warm wind swept past, sending a shiver across her sweat soaked skin. She could feel the presence of something out there, something watching her. She slowly pivoted, phone&#39;s flashlight app sweeping over the bushes. The rattle of the leaves and branches seemed animated by the wind alone and Erica made herself relax, letting her shoulders drop. In that moment her gaze dipped down towards her hand, and she noticed it. <br />
<br />
Even as the sense of being watched, being seen deeply and truly intensified, Erica saw the large crack in the back of her hand, the dry skin peeling away. Her pale skin was splitting there and with the slightest tremble she reached out with her other hand and felt it. Her skin was hot and despite the sweat drenching it was splitting. It wasn&#39;t dry and flaky, rather it was stretching, splitting like rubber or latex pushed too far. With a nervous shiver she used her thumb and forefinger to pinch the edge and tugged gently. There was no pain.<br />
<br />
The skin strained and stretched,  and Erica let out a hiss of surprise as it pulled further away. Her hand beneath was swelling, growing, showing black and yellow beneath the splitting skin. Erica quivered, looking around to see if she could find her observer but only seeing the lovely and benevolent moon looming overhead, larger than she had ever seen. She felt warm, sweat dripping off of her, felt the straps of her backpack and the waist of her jeans digging into her body. She could feel something happening, feel the warmth building inside her, writhing in her belly and loins like a living thing. She stretched out, holding up a hand now several inches wider and draped with curtains of sweaty skin over smooth black and yellow scales. Erica turned her hand, marveling at the claw&#39;s now tipping her long fingers, feeling the strain of too-tight clothes and too-constraining skin over her whole body. She gasped and started to reach a claw towards the straps of her backpack, scrabbling to remove it.<br />
<br />
But now, with the eyes of Luna on her, blessed mother of all Werebeasts, Erica&#39;s change was coming too fast to avoid. The rush of growth, of twisting frame and changing soul, they left no room for the old self in this moment. Erica groaned, feeling her distant anxiety grow cold, feeling only the joy of the moon and the lust in her body. She quivered as the straps on her backpack, already digging into her broader shoulders and swelling frame, burst. The bag fell to the ground with a thump as Erica scrabbled at her clothes. Skin and fabric alike ripped and gave way. The muscles of her shoulder grew broader and broader even as she stretched up, reaching desperately for the moon. Skin and tattered clothing fell away from her body as it grew taller and taller, neck broad and long, sinuous. Her face began to push out into a blunt muzzle, canines growing longer and longer as she felt her breasts shrinking down to nothing, disappearing entirely. She could feel her arms and legs getting thicker and more powerful, spine curving forward and hunching her over even as it extended, a thick tail extending behind her. Covered in scales patterned in black and yellow chevrons that went all the way up muscled back to the broad hood around her neck, to the cobra-like face. <br />
<br />
Erica squirmed, feeling the heat building even as she leaned back on her tail. Her breasts might be gone but the heat building between her legs was intolerable. She slid a finger down her body and groaned to feel it enter an unfamiliar slit, feeling a fullness there. Shuddering, looking down Erica could see and feel for the first time the two serpentine hemipenes. Each covered in spines and protruding from her cloaca. She shuddered, feeling a dripping gash beneath them. Her change had given her much more than just a strange new body, it had changed her sex and her self. <br />
<br />
In this form, a hulking eight foot tall were-cobra, all worries seemed even more distant and far away, her mind focused, cold, logical, even as the burning lust asked more of her than she had ever felt. She fell to feeling herself, peeling away the last clinging bits of her skin, tossing them aside. Balanced on her thick powerful tail one hand played with both hemipenes, the other dipping into her cloaca to finger the passageway there. With the moon as eager observer Erica groaned and gasped and twitched and spasmed her way to orgasm. A spatter of thick cum painting the dark pathway - clear to the strange senses Erica now had - and then she slumped, tail coiling beneath her as she fell into sleep, exhausted by the power of her first change. <br />
<br />
When Erica awoke the next day, from what she thought a strange dream she was naked and human once more. Splayed out on a gravel pathway in the woods and surrounded by the remains of her backpack and clothes. Shivering she sat up and realized she was hardly the same Erica. Her chest had become completely flat and all of the hair on her body had disappeared. She had a slightly feminine form but her muscles had grown noticeably and draped over her bald pussy was a pair of large human cocks with no balls in sight. She was sweating slightly, despite the mild late summer morning, and looking around she found herself hungry. It only took a moment of scrounging in her bag to find some unappetizing granola bars. Though they tasted miserable Erica choked them down and did her best to take in her surroundings. <br />
<br />
Her best seemed greatly improved. She could seem to see smudges of heat on and through many of the bushes nearby, and could taste numerous wild animals and unfamiliar beast things on the air. Shivering she stood slowly and made up her mind on her next course of action...</p>
