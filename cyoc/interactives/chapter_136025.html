<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie nervously navigated her street as the others followed behind her. The girls were having a pleasant enough day at a local bar before all sorts of insanity broke out. A ripple had spread through the bar suddenly regressing everyone 20 years. While Katie and her friends were protected the group had to act quickly to keep Mike, Sebastian, Shiro, Ashley and Jennifer from changing. The magic of their pendants was offering them protection for the duration of the spell but Katie had an odd feeling it wouldn’t be so simple. As she and the others now pulled up to Lisa and Jason’s they gazed around the neighborhood.<br />
<br />
“Everyone doing okay,” Katie asked as the others exited their cars. The others nodded in response as they looked around.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Samantha said. “Still have a headache though. Any idea what that’s about?” Katie shook her head as she looked at the others. “Did you guys get in touch with your families,” Katie asked.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Claudia answered. “Talked with Julia while Mika talked with Kumiko. They’re younger too. Julia’s mad as hell, she wants to know why we made her 12.”<br />
<br />
“At least she’s still in double digits,” Mika said. “Kumiko is stuck with a 9 year old husband and an infant right now. She said that even though she’s a teenager again she’s not babysitting.”<br />
<br />
“What about Derrick and his girlfriend,” Mary Elise asked. Claudia grinned as she looked at her friend. “The major answered the phone, he says Derrick and Morgan are enjoying a play date right now. What’s weird is it seemed normal to him. He doesn’t remember those two being anything but five.”<br />
<br />
“Katie this is really strange,” Mary Elise stated. “It seems like everyone over twenty got younger but people younger than twenty didn’t seem to change. My sister called me, she said that mom and dad are in their twenties now but she’s still 16.”<br />
<br />
“Do you think Gloria did this,” Kellie asked. Katie rubbed her chin thoughtfully as she looked at her home. “Possibly,” she said. “This definitely has the Ring  of Age written all over it. What I can’t understand is why? This is incredibly dangerous, she could of erased people from existence performing magic like this.”<br />
<br />
“Well might as well ask her then,” Kellie said as she now walked towards the front door. Slowly the others followed behind Kellie and Katie, unsure of what they would see upon entering. Knocking on the door they waited silently, only to be shocked when a blond girl their age with purple streaks in her hair opened the door.<br />
<br />
“Katie good to see you,” Ann said cheerfully. Katie gave the young goth an odd look, trying to place her face. “Ann,” she asked. “Is that you?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah it’s me,” she said sheepishly. “Sorry forget I had an different look at this age. Come on in, I’ll fill you in on what’s going on.”<br />
<br />
“Where’s Gloria,” Katie asked quickly. Ann turned back to her niece a concerned look on her face. “Gloria is resting on the couch with dad and Jason. The ring did something similar to everyone like it did when I visited the last time. This though was much more powerful and it looks like it took a lot out of her.” Katie and the others quickly entered the home noticing a pale blond girl their age resting on the couch. “Gloria are you okay?”<br />
<br />
Gloria smiled weakly as she slowly began to make her way to her feet. “Just tired,” she said weakly. As she tried to walk she stumbled, only to be caught by Martin. “Easy their Gloria,” he said. Katie gaped at her 50 year old grandfather. “Grandpa,” she exclaimed. “Oh my god! You look so young, what happened?”<br />
<br />
“Well my granddaughter here appears to be quite the magician,” he smirked. “Looks like she’s changed things so that Lisa and your grandmother can patch things up.” Katie now glanced into the kitchen where she could see a 19 year old Lisa and her grandmother cooking. Unfortunately it seemed the two were more interested in critiquing one another.<br />
<br />
“Make sure you baits the turkey Lisa,” Marilyn said as she watched her daughter. Lisa sighed as she glanced back at her mom. “I know mom,” she sighed. “This isn’t the first turkey I’ve ever cooked.”<br />
<br />
“Perhaps,” Marilyn said. “But just remember this is my dinner to plan. The way this wacky magic is working this is my home and my dinner. I’m allowing you to assist for now, if you start with the back talk you’ll join the others in the living room.” Lisa grunted in disgust as she basted the turkey before closing the oven door. Looking over at the front door she grinned, walking towards her adopted daughter.<br />
<br />
“Wow am I glad to see you,” Lisa smiled. <br />
<br />
“Mom what happened,” Katie asked in concern.<br />
<br />
Lisa now explained how the ring had changed things so that she and her family were reliving Katie’s first Thanksgiving. Lisa was shocked that the ring had in essence made the entire world 20 years younger. Since the. Lisa and her mother were trying to patch things up but it was proving to be a difficult task.<br />
<br />
“Unfortunately grandma over there is a stubborn one,” Lisa sighed. “Probably didn’t help I brought up her mom.” Katie rubbed her chin thoughtfully as she tried to figure things out. “Maybe the ring wants grandma to know what it’s like to be a daughter again,” Katie mused.<br />
<br />
“No that’s not it,” Gloria said weakly. The others turned towards Gloria as she slowly made her way towards them. Katie frowned as she saw her younger sister approach. “Gloria,” she groaned. “You really messed up this time. The type of magic you performed could of had serious consequences. What if you erased your friends or Tommy from existence? Do you have an idea the awful consequences of erasing someone from existence?”<br />
<br />
“Katie just stop and listen,” Gloria groaned. “I used my magic to keep those people from being erased, why do you think I’m so tired now.” Katie gave her sister a critical look before sighing. “Okay fine,” she relented. “So tell me, why is this happening?”<br />
<br />
“Well,” Gloria said. “This particularly Thanksgiving broke Lisa’s family apart. Grandma had gotten into a fight with your mom before she died and blamed herself for that. She wanted to make amends for it by raising you. Mom wouldn’t have it though. Your mom gave you to her, she wanted to raise you and was determined to keep her promise no matter what. That resulted in grandma fighting with Lisa, and it’s why we rarely see them now.”<br />
<br />
“So the ring wants them to correct the mistakes of that day,” Katie said to which Gloria nodded.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Gloria said weakly. “The thing is though there’s a complication. You and your friends.”<br />
<br />
“Us?!?!”<br />
<br />
Gloria nodded as when looked Katie and her friends over. “Yes,” she said. “You see the ring intended to rewind everyone 20 years, including all of you. The necklaces though protected you from its magic, which is why the whole world is now affected.”<br />
<br />
“Well what would you have us do,” Kellie asked. Gloria weakly turned to them, knowing what needed to be done.<br />
<br />
“I think you guy said are going to have to become 20 years younger too,”<br />
<br />
The college age group gaped at Gloria as they took this information in. They were all 20 now, meaning they would be less than a year old at the completion of its magic. Only Sebastian and mike would be left a little over a year old when the Magic was done. Needless to say it wasn’t an appealing prospect.<br />
<br />
“That idea sucks,” Claudia said bluntly. While the others didn’t say anything Gloria could tell by the looks on their faces they didn’t want to go through with that. Lisa, sensing their reluctance stepped forward. “Katie,” she said quietly. “Listen I know it’s not a very appealing prospect but if it can end the spell it’s worth a shot. Besides I’m going to need the practice.”<br />
<br />
“What are you talking about mom,” Gloria and Katie said curiously.<br />
<br />
Lisa sighed as she looked back at her 20 year old husband. She had been planning on telling her family this news this evening but circumstances seemed to dictate she would have a far larger audience. Beckoning her husband over the college age couple now looked over their family and friends.<br />
<br />
“Well was going to save this for later,” Lisa sighed. “But I guess nothing ever goes according to plan,” Marilyn and Martin now approached their youngest daughter curiously. “What is it Lisa,” she asked. “What’s going on?”<br />
<br />
Lisa felt her face flush as she looked her friend and loved ones over. A tight squeeze on her hand and a warm smile from her husband seemed to give her the strength. “Go ahead Lisa,” Jason said warmly. “It’s good news after all.” Lisa smiled, turning to look at everyone.<br />
<br />
“I’m pregnant,” she smiled.<br />
<br />
Gloria, Katie and the others now gaped at their parents before erupting into joyous cheers. “Oh my god mom,” Katie and Gloria exclaimed. “When did you find out?”<br />
<br />
“Right after your first date Gloria,” Lisa said. “We wanted to wait til everyone was home to tell you the good news. Then this happened.”<br />
<br />
“So that’s why you invited us,” Marilyn asked. Lisa nodded as she looked at her astonished mother. “Yeah mom,” she said. “Listen I know things weren’t easy the last time I had a baby to take care of but I wanted things to be different this time. If it means we have to change how this Thanksgiving went down 20 years I’m willing to try.”<br />
<br />
Marilyn smiled, hugging her daughter tightly. “Okay Lisa let’s try,”<br />
<br />
“Well that just leaves one last person then,” Samantha said as she looked back towards Katie.<br />
<br />
“Does this mean we all have to become infants,” Mika whined as she looked at Gloria. Gloria glanced down at her ring before looking at Katie’s friends. “I think it will work if it’s just Katie,” Gloria said. “But I could be wrong. Guess it’s all in your hands. All I know is that Katie has to become an infant again if this spell is going to end. If the rest of you choose to change with her it would only help.”<br />
<br />
Katie now looked at her friends, all of whom looked as if they wanted to complain. Katie wasn’t thrilled with the idea of becoming so young but she was resigned to her fate. Now it was her friends who needed to decide if they would join their friend for the evening.</p>
