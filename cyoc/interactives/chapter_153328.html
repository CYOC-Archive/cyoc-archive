<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;It&#39;s kind of a hard decision,&quot; said Alice, &quot;but I think we should at least turn her mind back on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; asked Jessica. &quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, I can see being rid of her, but turning her mind off? If we&#39;re not going to turn it back on, isn&#39;t that basically killing her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; said Jessica. &quot;When you&#39;re dead, your mind can&#39;t be turned back on. We just won&#39;t turn hers back on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; said Alice. &quot;That distinction kind of rings hollow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Mary. &quot;Honestly, I&#39;m not sure I mind killing her at this point, but let&#39;s not kid ourselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re not killing her,&quot; said Jessica. With a gesture toward her underwear, she continued, &quot;I&#39;m never going to turn Steve back, and I like him a lot better than her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But can Steve still think and feel?&quot; asked Alice. Jessica had no reply to that - but of course he could. She&#39;d as much as said Katie was her first use of the sentience checkbox. &quot;As you said, we&#39;re not killing her, and we agree what you propose would be killing her. Now you&#39;re the one outvoted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine. But let&#39;s turn her back to human for a second, so that we can be sure we actually have turned her on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice shrugged. &quot;I don&#39;t see a problem with that.&quot; Mary winced, but said nothing.<br />
<br />
Soon the three of them watched the tampon turn from foam to flesh as it grew into a very naked Katherine, fake boobs and all. &quot;What?&quot; she asked as she looked around the room. &quot;What was that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were a tampon,&quot; said Jessica, a predatory grin firm on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t remember... just everything just went... trippy. Whoa. Dizzy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We turned off your mind. For a few minutes, you didn&#39;t exist.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... did anyone use me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica laughed. &quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
The doomed naked girl pouted. &quot;Aw... then why&#39;d you change me back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We wanted to turn your mind back on, and this way we could be sure we had.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katherine smiled and clapped, her breasts bouncing wildly. &quot;So I get to feel it after all? Yippee!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica&#39;s grin spread nearly to her ears. &quot;We also wanted to tell you we&#39;re not turning you back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katherine&#39;s excitement faded as she eyed, her friends, looking for signs that they were joking. &quot;Ha ha, guys. It&#39;s not cool to joke about that kind of thing when you could actually do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No joke,&quot; said Jessica, fiddling with some settings on the Chronivac. &quot;You were right, guys, it was a good idea to turn her back for a minute. That way she can know how tacky we all think she is, and just what&#39;s in store for her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I didn&#39;t suggest that so you could be mean about it,&quot; said Alice.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were happy enough to talk about how she deserved it when she couldn&#39;t hear you,&quot; Mary pointed out. &quot;Just own it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katherine was wide eyed with horror as she realized her so-called friends disliked her enough to be serious. She turned to run out of the room, but Jessica had guessed it was coming and activated the settings she had typed into the Chronivac: Mass transference; Source:arms,legs; Target:breasts. Katherine tumbled undignified to the ground as her arms and legs rapidly shrunk away, landing on her side and kept in that position by the weight of half her body mass in tits. Katherine groaned, not just at the impact on the ground, but because her breasts were so sore, and had just smacked into the floor. They were as painful as they&#39;d been when they&#39;d first grown, but the soreness went all through their mass.<br />
<br />
Mary and Alice giggled uncomfortably, but Jessica thought it was hysterical.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, let me go!&quot; Katherine pleaded. &quot;We&#39;re friends, we were just having a bit of fun!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica laid down next to Katherine, resting her elbows on one of her tits, pinning it to the floor with her full weight. Katherine yelled. Jessica gave her a look that was some combination of warm and maniacal that Katherine didn&#39;t understand. &quot;We *are* having fun, sweetie. We couldn&#39;t have fun at your expense without you.&quot; She sat up cross legged and started fiddling with the Chronivac controls again. &quot;So here&#39;s what we&#39;ve got: permanent, irreversible, sentient, senses intact, you&#39;ll be able to taste and smell with your whole body--see, I&#39;m nice, you wanted to experience it fully--indestructible, no-pleasure:physical, no-pleasure:emotional. You said you wanted to feel it, not that you wanted to enjoy it. And I&#39;m ragging right now, so unless you guys object I think I may as well use her.&quot; All Katherine could do is plead incoherently as she tried to wiggle away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, this is too far,&quot; protested Alice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Jessica, I actually agree with Alice. At least take off the permanent and no pleasure settings, it&#39;s not--&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica pushed the button. Katherine&#39;s pleading stopped and her facial expression froze. As she began to shrink, her enormous breasts smushed themselves against her body, wrapping themselves around her as they turned into a plastic applicator, while the rest of her body slowly turned to cotton. She giggled at the extra touch she&#39;d added: Katherine&#39;s clit elongated from the bottom of her legless torso and turned into the string. With the no-pleasure setting Jessica wondered what she&#39;d feel when it was handled. At the very end a wrapper appeared and sealed Katherine away.<br />
<br />
When the process was done, Jessica picked the object up. &quot;Now, I can see the point of you like this. Dumb bitch. You&#39;ve got a bit before I put you in, so think on that for a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jessica, that wasn&#39;t okay. I wanted to get rid of her, sure, but I didn&#39;t want to torture her,&quot; said Mary. &quot;Change her back!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica didn&#39;t respond for a moment, fiddling with some more settings on the Chronivac. Mary thought she might be doing as she&#39;d said, but when Jessica looked up again it was clear that she&#39;d only just now heard her. &quot;Weren&#39;t you listening? &#39;Irreversible.&#39; Not even God could change her back now. Besides, I&#39;m not torturing her. I just set it to no-pleasure, I could have set it to Painful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are unbelievable,&quot; said Alice. &quot;Give me the controls, let&#39;s see how you like being treated like that.&quot; She stormed over and tried to snatch the console from Jessica&#39;s hands, but Jessica kept it out of reach. After a few moments of flailing around, Jessica got some distance and hovered her finger over the console.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t try it, guys. I was worried you&#39;d get all bent out of shape when I was done with Katherine, and when I queued up that boob trick for her I also prepared it for both of you, so just don&#39;t try it.&quot; Jessica eyed them both cautiously. &quot;Come on, you two are actually my friends, I don&#39;t want to do anything mean to you, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you really hate Katherine that much,&quot; asked Mary.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not about hating her! But.. how do I put this... I would rather have an extra tampon around than Kat--we all agreed on that, remember? And if she&#39;s sentient all I could think is that if she enjoyed it she might get the idea that her wants and her happiness mattered, that life as a tampon served *her*. And if it she was miserable and was eventually damaged enough that she died, then the tampon&#39;s destruction would serve *her*. It doesn&#39;t though, it serves us, or if not us, it serves some other woman. Or it serves no one if we decide to throw her away. But the one person it doesn&#39;t serve is Kat.&quot; <br />
<br />
Alice and Mary watched her uncomfortably.<br />
<br />
Jessica continued, &quot;Thinking that existence as a tampon is serving her would be a delusion for Kat. What kind of life is that? Imagine yourself her her shoes, thinking that. Is there anything more pathetic? Now her life as a tampon has replaced her old life, and being put to use as a tampon fulfills the function of a tampon, not her happiness. I&#39;m helping her, okay? I&#39;m just helping her know what she is. Her life will never be fun now, but at least it won&#39;t be that pathetic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; said Alice, &quot;I think I see where you&#39;re coming from. And maybe this is on us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary looked at her. &quot;What? How so?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if we hadn&#39;t given her her sentience back, there&#39;d be no question of the tampon&#39;s use being good for Kat; Kat wouldn&#39;t be there. Right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica nodded emphatically; she hadn&#39;t been expecting someone to understand something she&#39;d only articulated for the first time.<br />
<br />
Alice continued, &quot;so fair is fair. I understand why you did that. If we do more permanent transformations, it&#39;s okay to either turn off sentience, or make it bad. But the three of us are friends, and we&#39;re just having fun, so no permanent transformations, okay?&quot; Mary nods, and so does Jessica as she finally moves her finger away from the console and runs over to hug Alice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I knew you&#39;d understand, Alice.&quot; Her eyes were watering up with tears of relief. She was worried they would think she was crazy. She half thought she was crazy after what came out of her mouth. She went and hugged Mary, too, who had an inscrutable look on her face. &quot;I&#39;ll be right back. I thought I&#39;d wait to use Kat, but I&#39;m excited and I need to pee anyway, so...&quot; She wiggled the tampon between her fingers excitedly, the wrapper making small krinkling sounds, and ran off to the bathroom, taking the Chronivac controls with her before either of the others could notice enough to stop her.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Kat could hear everything, of course. She despaired at the thought that her friends had never really liked her, and no matter how she tried---remembering happier times, her family, trying to be mad at her &quot;friends&#39;&quot; faults---nothing lifted her mood even a little. She felt worthless, and wanted more than anything to find a way back to her old human life and get as far away from these three as possible; the desire to have any fate but this was almost a physical ache. She would have sobbed if she could.<br />
<br />
She wasn&#39;t sure if it was a psychosomatic effect of being in the translucent blue wrapper, but the whole time those three were talking she felt as though she was on the verge of suffocating, like her breath was being held too long. She had no lungs now, so she couldn&#39;t even try to fix it. Maybe it was the wrapper and in her brief time between the wrapper and Jessica&#39;s vagina she&#39;d find some relief.<br />
<br />
She heard the bathroom door close, and a quick down-and-stop motion that she guessed was Jessica sitting. The wrapper was peeled away, and Katherine was frustrated to find her feeling of near suffocation did not go away. This is just what not having lungs was like for her now, she guessed. She saw Jessica from her vantage point in Jessica&#39;s hand, a giantess with her underwear/boyfriend around her ankles and skirt pulled up. She started peeing. &quot;Might as well give you the full visual.&quot; She finished peeing, spread her legs to wipe herself, and Katherine saw the dangling string of her old tampon.<br />
<br />
As Jessica pulled it out, blood dribbling into the toilet, Kat expected Jessica to taunt her. Instead all she said, almost with tenderness, was, &quot;I did this to help you, you know. I hope you never find comfort.&quot; With that she put the old tampon in the bin and carefully plunged Katherine into her vagina. At first it was only a little uncomfortable, but then the applicator was pushed, shoving her out of the plastic that had been her breasts, and deep enough into Jessica&#39;s vagina that she could see only darkness now. It was too warm, like standing under a heat lamp in the middle of summer. She had hoped against hope that maybe it would be like a long soak in a warm bath, but the blood and damp soaking into her felt more like an unpleasant violation. The applicator sliding along her string, and shortly Jessica&#39;s underwear and labia rubbing against it, still felt like sensations on her clit, but it wasn&#39;t pleasant. It was like too much stimulation when she wasn&#39;t turned on, just annoying and grating; and she could do nothing to get away from it. And the taste, of blood and pussy (what a disappointing way to taste the latter for the first time), was... Every fiber of cotton in her body could taste, and smell, and it was like having a tongue ten miles wide with the flavor of Jessica&#39;s insides gradually taking over more of its area.<br />
<br />
In a few hours Katherine knew she would be yanked out unpleasantly by her irritated clit, and... then what? She wondered if Jessica would keep her in a jar or something to watch her menstrual blood turn rancid, enjoying the knowledge of what Katherine was going through. But from Jessica&#39;s rant it sounded like she&#39;d just toss her in the bin without a second thought.<br />
<br />
There was heat and damp and dark and the shifting of Jessica&#39;s body. It was unbearable and seemed to go on for hours; maybe she&#39;d finally be pulled out soon. It was only when Jessica stopped walking that Katherine realized she&#39;d been walking constantly since the bathroom, and she could now hear the muffled voices of Alice and Mary through Jessica&#39;s flesh. Jessica had probably just walked down the hall back to her friends, but it was so suffocating and miserable that it had seemed intolerably long. She couldn&#39;t imagine bearing the amount of time until she was actually ready to be changed out. And even that was peanuts compared to the eternity that waited after that. Katherine&#39;s heart sank. It would never lift again.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Jessica pulled up Steve, and tried to understand her feelings. What she wanted to feel for Katherine now was indifference. That would be appropriate, right? But if she were forced to put a name to how she felt, she felt... *proud* of Katherine. She was where she should be, feeling what she should feel; it was a *good* fate she&#39;d been given. What did feeling like that mean? Her thoughts turned to Alice and Mary. She hadn&#39;t been lying when she said they were her friends, but when she thought about doing something similar to them it didn&#39;t feel like it was something wrong. They wouldn&#39;t want to be transformed into inanimate objects forever, but once transformed what they wanted wouldn&#39;t matter. And they wouldn&#39;t have to be disposable; she could keep her friends nearby while still making sure they were in the same right and proper state as Katherine. Would that be a bad thing?<br />
<br />
On the other hand, part of her worried she was getting a little too giddy on the power and possibilities of the Chronivac. What she&#39;d done to Katherine wasn&#39;t sexual for her, but it was seductive in a new way. She was getting carried away in the high; it can&#39;t really be okay to do that to people, to friends? She should probably go back, apologize again, and just have fun temporary  transformation time with her friends.  She didn&#39;t like the thought of her friends, as people, being miserable, and the thought that it was okay when they were inanimate was probably her being drunk on the feeling of control.<br />
<br />
She honestly couldn&#39;t say which was true, but...<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
&quot;So we&#39;re agreed. I&#39;ll bring it up when she gets back,&quot; said Mary.<br />
<br />
Alice fidgeted nervously. &quot;How do you think she&#39;ll take it? Are you sure she won&#39;t think we&#39;re trying to double cross her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jessica knows my word is good. She may be a little funny right now, but I think she still genuinely thinks of us as friends. She&#39;ll list--&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary was cut off as something was suddenly wrong with her feet, making it harder to stand. Before she lost her balance and collapsed to the floor, she noticed that Alice&#39;s hands were receding into stumps and she was teetering as well. Soon they were both on the floor, their arms and legs receding, much more slowly than Katherine&#39;s had, while their boobs grew bigger. Alice was a tall girl, 6&#39; and curvy, and by the time the process took her arms and legs down to smooth bumps, her breasts weighed over a hundred pounds by themselves, and they were so tender their own weight hurt them while Alice whimpered &quot;ow ow ow!&quot; She tried to roll over but simply couldn&#39;t. Mary was a smaller woman, but there was still not much she could do when her breasts weighed about as much as the rest of her; she yelped as she tried to move rolled part of her sore breasts under her.<br />
<br />
They were like this for just under a minute when Jessica walked back into the room, Chronivac console in hand. &quot;Suprise!&quot; She laughed. &quot;Sorry, this setting just doesn&#39;t get old. Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s temporary.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice looked fearful. &quot;Did you hear us? Oh god, what are you going to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hear you? Talking about what?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary tried to gather herself and seem calm. She was facing away from the door when she fell, and she worked on inching herself around her enormous tits so she could face Jessica. Jessica laughed at her the whole time, and Mary knew Jessica wasn&#39;t going to help. She was enjoying humiliating her friend too much. &quot;Jessica, we were talking, and we want ask you something.&quot; Jessica said nothing, just waiting for Mary to talk. &quot;What you did to Katherine was messed up. We understand what you were thinking, but it was disgusting, and you made us accomplices. If we&#39;d known you were going to make her suffer like that, and forever, we would have asked for her sentience to stay off. You need to make this right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica seemed hurt that they were still talking about this. &quot;But I can&#39;t! It&#39;s too late to do anything for her!&quot; She made a gesture where she spread her legs momentarily and gestured with both hands to her crotch. &quot;*This* is already done, we can&#39;t even save her from that much.&quot; She looked at Alice. &quot;You said you understood.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, can you change us back for this conversation?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, Jessica,&quot; pleaded Alice, &quot;my boobs hurt so much!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you can say it like this. Actually, I don&#39;t want to get interrupted.&quot; She tapped a couple of buttons, and Alice&#39;s entire face melted together and swelled into another breast, the Chronivac settings keeping her alive and comfortable, if confused. Jessica chuckled to herself.<br />
<br />
Mary looked angrier. &quot;We know you can&#39;t do anything for Kat,&quot; said Mary, &quot;and probably wouldn&#39;t anyway, but you can make it up to us, to the friends you&#39;ve hurt. Please give us back our arms, give us the console, and consent to a punishment. You will be miserable, but because we&#39;re friends it will only be temporary. And when it&#39;s done, the slate is clean, we&#39;re all good again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if I don&#39;t?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn&#39;t an ultimatim or a threat, Jessica, this is a request, a way to make amends. If you don&#39;t... well, either you leave with the Chronivac and leave us with some fun temporary transformations, or you give it to us and we leave, but it&#39;ll probably take some time before we can forgive you. Especially when you do shit like that,&quot; she nodded at the confused Alice, who was writhing and trying to figure out what had happened to her. &quot;I don&#39;t want that to happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How long?&quot; Jessica was taking it seriously.<br />
<br />
&quot;A year. It sounds like a long time, but that&#39;s not long compared to the thing in your pussy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I need some quiet to think.&quot; She tapped the controls again and Mary&#39;s face also turned into a tit. She walked over to Alice and lay down, resting her head and back against her giant boobs while playing absent-mindedly with her face nipple. Alice silently tried to inch away, but her nipple was pinched under Jessica and moving just made it worse.<br />
<br />
&quot;All right, fine.&quot;</p>
