<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Not too long ago, in the ladies&#39; showers, Shari had been cleaning up after her workout. The hot water that rained down on her was nothing compared to the heat she was feeling for Ric. She was grinning, knowing the two of them would soon be having another kind of workout. She gave one of her tits squeeze in anticipation of it. <br />
<br />
Across the way, the nubile gym goer was being watched by another woman, whose rather conspicuous muscles indicated she&#39;d been hitting the weights a lot. The 6&#39;2&quot; female bodybuilder, Janine, was enjoying the show, uncaring about whether that little hetero slut wanted her gaze or not. She&#39;d long ago stopped caring what the breeders thought about her or her butch lifestyle, embracing a hardcore heterophobic attitude along with an intense workout regime. And why not? The world was changing and pretty soon, the hets would be the minority. Then it would be their turn to be denied everything and to be shunned. Just the thought of that homonormative paradise got her all bothered.<br />
<br />
So it was that she was caught up in her hateful thoughts that Janine failed to notice that Shari had caught her watching. The blonde jogger had a definite frown on her face, and let fly with the insults. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my gawd, you dykey bitch, Did you enjoy the free show?&quot;<br />
<br />
The lesbian gymrat dismissed the outburst from the het bitch with a wave of her hand, rather enjoying the outrage. The ones who fought back always made her hot, but little did she know that her sudden flush of lust had just sealed her doom. The &#39;were-breeder&#39; curse had latched onto the most appropriate target it had since James had first been cursed, and it soon got to work on changing this hater into what she despised the most. <br />
<br />
Janine turned back to her locker, not even watching Shari leave. With a shudder, the muscle mass she&#39;d built with gay pride began to shrink away. Her biceps deflated like balloons, leaving her arms much more feminine. Even the tan she&#39;d gotten was starting to fade away. With several crunches as bones through out her body contracted, her height dropped down, leaving her at a much more ladylike 5&#39;5&quot;. Her swole calves also lost the extra muscles she&#39;d packed on, leaving behind only toned and long legs. Her squared and muscled buttocks grew more rounded as fat welled up in them, giving her some definite junk in the trunk.<br />
<br />
Still oblivious to loss of her amazonian physique, Janine looked in the round mirror that hung in her locker, which had forced itself into existence. The sight of the mostly masculine face in it seemed to disappoint her for some reason, as if she hadn&#39;t been proud of it only a little while ago. Then her close cropped black hair began to grow, lightening to a sandy blonde as its locks reached down to her shoulders. Reaching to touch the new lengths, her hands began to shrink and thin, growing more feminine as her nails grew longer with a coating of pink nail polish. As she continued to watch, her face began to alter as well. Her sallow cheeks grew fuller, as her cheekbones shifted. Her flat nose narrowed with a crunch, while her squared chin tapered to a gentle curve. Her narrow eyes became fuller, as they shifted color from dull brown to vibrant blue. Greasy skin cleared and paled as the first signs of make-up began to appear. Finally, her thin dry lips grew plumper and fuller.<br />
<br />
It was then that her alreay fogged mind registered something was wrong. Why had she become so girly? She wasn&#39;t some tiny femme, but proudly butch. Wasn&#39;t she? Just then, her whole torso crunched down to match the rest of her body. Her well-developed chest muscles began to recede as her breast reasserted themselves. Her wife-beater was pulled tight by the surge of tit flesh that shot forward in a natural set of c-cups. Again, some part of her old self reached out through the fluffiness filling her mind, getting her turn away from the mirror. This wasn&#39;t her, this frail form. What had happened to her?<br />
<br />
She tried to hold on to the anger that drove her hate of the heteros. But instead, she found herself wondering what kissing a man would be like. Her brownish-blonde hair fluttered as she tried to shake that idea out of her mind. But it only stayed, and was soon joined by other non-lesbian notions, like having sex with a man. Horrified, the still-changing Janine tried to run, to get away from here. However, she nearly tripped over her own feet, and looked down to see that her beloved Size 12 army boots had become a pair of dark grey pumps on size 8 feet. Dropping to sit on a bench, she tried to pull the offending shoes off, only to discover that her legs were being covered by a pair of sheer pantyhose, which seemed to emphasize her long legs. <br />
<br />
These changes to her clothes were soon joined by her white cotton boxers becoming a pair of black silk panties with her already streched wife-beater as a matching bra with frilly lace. Staggered and stunned by the latest changes, she allowed let her mental defenses waver for a moment, and the hertero tide washed over her remaining lesbianism. The fear that had been on her lovely face was replaced by a serenity that comes with knowing who she really was. Of course, not all of her old hate was gone. It had merely switched focus on the filthy and pervert homosexuals that lurked among the heteronormative. <br />
<br />
Reaching into her locker, she pulled out a grey knee length skirt that reminded one of the old poodle skirts, sans any kind of logo on. A white silk blouse joined it soon enough. The now nearly changed Janine took one last look in the mirror, as her mind filled a final few gaps. Her eyes lighted on the diamond ring that now rested on her left ring finger, the memories of her man proposing to her bubbling up. Her perfect smile of white teeth at the vision of the rough and tumble Army sergeant stammering out the words seemed to confirm she&#39;d chosen her future husband well. Setting her hair back with a wide black headband, Jane closed her locker and headed out to the gym&#39;s juice bar to wait.<br />
<br />
Her wait wasn&#39;t long as her beloved Marty came out of the men&#39;s locker room, engaging with his favorite nephew, Ric. Seeing her, the strong military man walked over and stood over. As he leaned down to kiss her,  sealing their love and new identities, her eyes caught sight of Shari nearly tackling Ric for her own kiss. It made her Southern heart so happy to see that yet another straight couple were in love...</p>
