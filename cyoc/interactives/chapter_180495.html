<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kendall slipped out of bed, Allison giving him an odd look. He waved her backdown with a hand. &quot;I just need to go retrieve a little refreshment and I&#39;ll be..&quot; His words stumbled. He had had something witty he was going to say but the words weren&#39;t forming in his mind. He must have been more tired from their romp than he thought. &quot;I&#39;ll be right as rain.&quot; He finished lamely, grabbing his glasses off the nightstand and returning them to perch on his ears and nose.<br />
<br />
He headed down to the kitchen, not even bothering to throw any clothes on. Why should he worry? His parents were gone for the week and he had the house all to himself for his and Allison&#39;s study sessions. Besides, it felt good to just let his ample manhood swing free, letting his hidden talent show proudly on display for once. He stepped up to the fridge, yanking the door open and sighing as the cool air flowed out and curled against his naked flesh.<br />
<br />
His hand first went for a water bottle, then changed course, grabbing one of his father&#39;s beers. Without even thinking about it he cracked it open and started gulping down the lager. He had never really been one for beer, finding it bitter and unpleasant, but at the moment it felt like the most refreshing beverage in the world. He emptied the can and grabbed a second, popping it open and eagerly drinking it down. His dad had always joked he&#39;d get a taste for beer when he was older, Kendall had doubted it, but at the moment he thought maybe his father wasn&#39;t as daft as he thought.<br />
<br />
He scratched his fingers along his chest that a moment ago had been smooth but now sported a few curling hairs. He didn&#39;t seem to notice the discrepancy, his cock simply twitching back to life, blood flowing back into the large organ, causing it to rise slightly as his mind drifted. &quot;Already?&quot; He said, looking down to his own manhood, talking to it as if it could understand him. &quot;Well, while your ebullience is unexpected it&#39;s certainly..&quot; His jaw worked. There was a word he wanted but it slipped from his mind, &quot;Welcome.&quot; He finished.<br />
<br />
He headed back upstairs and fell into bed next to Allison. She placed a hand on his cheek and kissed him, then wrinkled her nose. &quot;You need to shave, Kendall. You know I don&#39;t like stubble, it&#39;s irritating.&quot; Shave? He barely had to scrape the peach fuzz off his face once a week. Though he reached up and felt the coarse brush of stubble on his chin and along his jaw. Not much, but maybe his body decided it was finally time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Later? After all, my.. uh..&quot; He shook his head to clear it.  Even if his body seemed raring to go maybe he was still tired. He just didn&#39;t feel like he could think straight. But Allison got his meaning as she noticed his cock laying rigid and firm against his flat stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine. Just this once.&quot; And she wrapped her hand around it.<br />
<br />

<br />
Bryan laid in Wes&#39; bed, though not without Wes. The blond stud was above him, knees on either side of Bryan&#39;s hips as they made out. Wes&#39; tan cock lay warm and hard against Bryan&#39;s stomach as they worked their mouths against each other in eager need. When Wes pulled away he grinned. &quot;Alistate. I&#39;m going to ride that cock of yours until you pass out.&quot; Bryan nodded eagerly. Wes&#39; voice had a strange tone to it now, a bit of an accent that was familiar but he couldn&#39;t quite place.<br />
<br />
He noticed that Wes&#39; hair had black roots now, the blond color looking more dyed in than natural. His brows and eyelashes also black as Wes&#39; face hung just above his. One last kiss and Wes sat up, Bryan reached up and grabbed Wes&#39; meaty chest in his hands, massaging his pecs teasingly. It was also the first time Bryan was noticing how dark he had gotten. Against his skin tone Wes was looking practically pale. <br />
<br />
The thought only lasted a moment though as Wes guided Bryans pre slicked cock right towards his hole. Wes held his breath as he lowered himself slowly onto the thick cock, spreading his virgin hole open for the first time. Bryan could only moan softly as he felt that warm tightness engulfing him. It was better than any pussy, better even than Diego&#39;s mouth. Wes felt like he was made to fit Bryan&#39;s cock.<br />
<br />
Every inch that sunk into Wes caused Bryan&#39;s skin to darken just a little more. Two wishes to be more like Ross were taking effect. The curls in his hair, both on his head and across his body tightened. Bryan began to thrust and roll his hips, Wes bracing himself with one hand on the wall and one on Bryan&#39;s meaty pectoral, &quot;Cógeme más fuerte!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bryan had no idea what Wes had actually said, but he got the gist of it and started thrusting harder, his fingers digging into Wes&#39; hips as e pumped his cock eagerly into him. &quot;Aww fuck, man, here it comes.&quot; Bryan&#39;s voice was deeper, richer in tone even as he groaned in the throes of sex. He came inside Wes, holding his best friend in place as he filled him with his seed. Wes grabbed his own cock and gave it the last few pumps needed to tip him over the edge, his cum splattering on Bryan&#39;s chest, bright white on dark brown.<br />
<br />
The stayed tied together for a few moments, both catching their breaths. Bryan reached down next to the bed and grabbed something to wipe his chest off, it looked like it was Wes&#39; shirt. He didn&#39;t care. Wes finally rolled to the side, landing on the bed next to Bryan. &quot;Fuck man, we should have done that long since.&quot; Bryan mumbled as Wes lay panting next to him. &quot;But since when do you speak Spanish?&quot;<br />
<br />
Wes gave him a confused look. &quot;Spanish? I, um.. dunno.&quot; Wes was still speaking with a very subtle accent, it reminded Bryan of Diego. Almost.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was fucking hot.&quot; Bryan finally said, leaning in to kiss Wes. &quot;You should do it more.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever you say, hermano.&quot; Wes added cheerily as he returned the kiss, ready to start ramping up for round two.</p>
