<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your very first stop on the tour led you into a dungeon, however this was unlike any of the dungeons you saw before. There was no torches and everything was pitch black, but as kobolds it was just slightly dim down the hallway. The air around you wasn’t cold and damp, but actually comfortably warm and in some cases humid. Then you looked into the cells and paused, these weren’t prisoners like humans, orcs, or elves, but... kobolds?<br />
<br />
However each kobold had a large bulge in their stomach, and in each room there was a nest. You grew increasingly curious until you started to see eggs in a few of these cells, and those with eggs seemed to even have breasts, some up to sizes such as D, which were humongous for kobolds. However all of them still had dicks clearly and no wombs from the looks of it, which made you increasingly curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are we? Why are all of our brothers so bloated, and even some with feminine breasts?&quot; You asked and Trique smiled back at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;These are all traitors serving their sentences, and all stripped of every ounce of pride in their bodies except the very thing that makes them male. Finally, all viciously fucked and by master’s might now have wombs in their rectums and are cursed to give birth to more loyal subjects. Once they’ve birthed enough they’re free, but must keep their breasts as a reminder as well as the memories. Some never leave, some given special treatment to work while they’re holding their clutch. Some oddly enjoy the experience while most dread it to an excruciating extent, which is mostly the reason why some don’t leave.&quot; Trique explained and stopped in front of a cell of a kobold who was groaning and hissing in pain.<br />
<br />
You looked in the cell and watched this kobold growl, as he laid on his back and a large white object came into view from his asshole. Your eyes widened as you watched the konold&#39;s anus pucker and stretch as seven large eggs the size of grapefruits emerged from his asshole, and plopped onto the ground. Afterwards his chest bulged out and you watched as two breasts inflated and swelled up to C cups, and were so swollen that milk leaked out from their nipples.<br />
<br />
&quot;This one has three more eggs to go it seems, at least,&quot; Trique added and the kobold inside whimpered as another pregnant bulge in his stomach emerged without warning.<br />
<br />
Trique then looked to you and said,&quot;You get the idea, it ain’t pretty but it’s life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who’s in charge of them? I mean, this one’s asshole looks absolutely destroyed!&quot; You laughed and the kobold inside the cell whimpered,&quot;Oh... y-you don’t kn-know... the h-half of it...&quot;<br />
<br />
Trique then snarled,&quot;Shut up and start warming your eggs bitch!&quot;<br />
<br />
The kobold inside whined, then gathered his eggs up into the nest and curled around them the best he could, and Trique sighed and looked to you. &quot;There’s medical staff and guards, but mostly medical staff are stuck responding to births and there’s not enough claws to accommodate for everything right now,&quot; Trique explained then sighed,&quot;Especially for those sick freaks who enjoy what this poor fellow just went through. If you’re worried about security most of these guys are two weak and/or slow to do much even when armed, so don’t worry a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
You tilted your head confused and asked,&quot;Why are you telling me this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you’re now in charge of them, Warden,&quot; Trique said and your eyes widened and Trique sighed,&quot;The last old bastard died off, and we needed a new tail to fill in... not literally if you’re planning to cut off your tail and regrow it overnight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to him?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Natural causes, Master is considering a new law for one of your position to help with that, so feel happy,&quot; Trique said,&quot;I’ll take you to your quarters down the hall, and everything you need to know is in there. Mostly just calling in staff to clean out shedded skin, and scat, but anywho congratulations! You’ve helped me free up a few time slots in my day, so have fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trique began to guide you down the hall again and as he did you continued looking at a few of the kobolds, and a few actually seemed kind of sexy with a gravid belly and effeminate forms. You briefly tapped Trique on the shoulder and asked,&quot;Hey, crazy question, but... could I take one of these guys back to my quarters with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Trique paused and raised his brow upon hearing this and he nodded,&quot;Actually yes, but only one, and you have to pick from the political prisoner section, or one of those freaks who’s so into laying eggs they might as well be a female in heat. Basically those who are nonviolent, despite the conditions of how each inmate is.”<br />
<br />
You slowly nodded in response to this and Trique guided you into a small tunnel that branched off into a chamber of interconnected passages. One of those passages had weird symbols above it that spelled out &quot;WARDEN&quot; in the language of kobolds, and he guided you inside. <br />
<br />
Inside the cave there was a large nest, and a pit of lava with a metal grate over the top of it, along with cooking utensils surrounding this lava pit. There was a desk carved from stone and a small stone stool to your side with all kinds of information scattered about on top of it, there was a shortsword in a scabbard in the center of the room. There was a bucket beside the nest as well that you could just tell from the smell was what a kobold substitute for a toilet was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here’s your new home Xido, everything you need to know is on the desk, might as well mark the walls with your urine now before someone else does claiming their you. Feces can be disposed of in your pit for fuel, and there’s a map for you to use so you can guide yourself wherever you want to go for food, weapons, armor, sex, and pretty much anywhere you need to go in our underground home here,&quot; Trique said,&quot;I’ll inform everyone I see to spread the word of your arrival and to tell everyone else. Just get settled in tonight big guy, I’m sure the guards and doctors will be meeting you shortly.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded to Trique and bowed to him respectively and said,&quot;Thank you brother, I hope to cross paths with you again soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh,&quot; Trique chuckled and grinned at you with his sharp reptilian teeth,&quot;I’m sure we will, you’ll be giving blowjobs and receiving them in no time brother, check your hand.&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked down and saw a symbol appear, and in the kobold language was the symbol for &quot;Brood&quot;. Trique waved to you and said,&quot;Now, you’re officially the Warden of the breeding dungeons.&quot;<br />
<br />
You watched at Trique exited and the first thing on your To-Do list was to empty what bladder you had at the entrance to your home, and make yourself comfortable. After doing so and feeling much more relaxed in the smell of your own urine, you sat down at the desk and started examining all of the papers scattered about. Most of which were just the history of each prisoner, what they did, and schedules they needed to follow. Each prisoner had to attend classes and counseling on how to tend to their children. After the child teethed and said their first words was when they were sent to the kobold equivalent of an orphanage, or a loving family consisting of at least two loving partners, both kobolds, obviously. However there was an acception for the Warden, and children birthed by the partner would stay and get raised by him and his husband, or otherwise approved by the Warden in person.<br />
<br />
That’s when you found the policy for picking a prisoner, which stated that the Warden or anyone associated with the staff could free a prisoner into their custody with the restriction that they can’t leave the cave home, and those that did without approval by the Warden were sent to solitary. There was also a list of political prisoners and those prisoners who wanted to stay on it for selection, and there was a whole cell wing for those individuals.<br />
<br />
Time passed and eventually boredom drove you to actually stand up and do something, besides you had a map and could practically go anywhere you wanted to. So you took the map in hand and paused overlooking the areas where you could eat, relax, go to the surface, and even attend brothels or &quot;Gatherings&quot; as listed on the map. <br />
<br />
Eventually you made up your mind and you decided to...</p>
