<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Adam moved towards a game called Quest of Arcadia and beamed. “This even is for five players,” he said to the others. “It&#39;s perfect for us to play.”<br />
<br />
Austin glanced at the old employee who was still snoring. “Are you sure we should even be on here’” he muttered, but still joining his friends near the machine.<br />
<br />
Adam turned it on and put five quarters inside, for each person playing. The screen flickered on, revealing some actually decent graphics on the character select screen. The only problem was…<br />
<br />
“No male characters?” Christian asked, with a raised eyebrow.<br />
<br />
“I guess not,” Adam mumbled, scanning the characters. <br />
<br />
Christian scratched his head. “Some of these aren&#39;t even human,” he pointed out. <br />
<br />
Paul scratched his head. “This seems to be some sort of hentai game.” Justin just howled with laughter.<br />
<br />
Adam scowled and with a swipe of the joystick picked an option called random.<br />
<br />
“Hey!” Everyone protested as they each were given their characters, and it moved on to a character creator. “What the fuck was that for?” Christian growled.<br />
<br />
Adam just shrugged and glanced at his portion of the screen to see the character that he was playing as would be a scylla, some sort of female with the lower half of an octopus.<br />
<br />
Christian sighed. “Guess I&#39;m a centaur.”<br />
<br />
Paul frowned. “A drider? I&#39;m a mutant spider?”<br />
<br />
Justin blinked. “A harpy?” He snorted.<br />
<br />
Austin looked confused. “What&#39;s a lamia?”<br />
<br />
Justin tried to go back to the character select only to find that he couldn&#39;t. He rolled his eyes. “Well I guess I&#39;ll have to make do,” he said to himself, playing around with the character creator. The character selector seemed to be there to pick a race, while the creator allowed to change the look of the race the had been chosen. But they were still female.<br />
<br />
Still Justin couldn&#39;t help but laugh when he noticed an option. “Holy shit it is a hentai. You can make their tits huge!!” He tried to increase this character&#39;s chest as large as possible only to find out that he could only make them as large as C-cup.<br />
<br />
Paul and Christian laughed. “Well Adam?” Christian sneered as he changed his character&#39;s cup size to F and Paul&#39;s and Austin&#39;s characters’ cup size to DD. “Still think this isn&#39;t one of your stupid hentai games?”<br />
<br />
Adam scowled. “It’s not,” he snapped.<br />
<br />
They all just rolled their eyes and skipped over to the next screen without bothering to change how their characters even looked, instead focusing on picking their classes. “I’ll take Black Mage,” Paul said, flicking through the list of classes and picking the one he wanted. He raised his eyebrows, as his drider character changed her clothes. She was still a large spider monster with the upper half of a large chested woman where the spider’s head would’ve been. She had long straight black hair and while her arms and face looked somewhat normal, above her two normal eyes were four other smaller black pupiless eyes, with two above each of her normal ones. She wore the typical witch outfit with a black dress and a pointed black hat. There were any clothes on the spider part of her body but there was a small pattern of a flame on its back. <br />
<br />
Paul realized he could name his character and, after taking a second to think, he named her, “Palla.”<br />
<br />
“Paladin, then,” Christian said, since he often enjoyed using sword characters in fighting games. He glanced at his character, not surprised to find that clothes had appeared on her character model. The centauress was now wearing a suit of armor that covered most of her horse body, only with her beige hooves and blonde tail being visible. Her human part looked normal save for the ears that were more like horse ears above her head, blending in with her long curled blonde hair. She wore some armor that covered her arms and what looked like a metal bra supporting her breasts. Impressively to Christian, she had a six-pack.<br />
<br />
Christian didn’t take all that time to think and just named her Charlotte, the name of his ex-girlfriend.<br />
<br />
“Rogue,” Austin muttered, picking the class that he always did whenever he played a MMORPG. His character changed its clothes into something more conservative than the other characters. The lamia had a long pure black tail extending out of her waist, where her legs would be. She had brown skin and long black hair, with yellow eyes. She was wearing a skin tight dark suit that only went down to the upper portion of her tail. It covered the entirety of her human body up to her hands. She wore a hood and bandages were wrapped around her mouth.<br />
<br />
“Arya,” he muttered. Sure he liked Game of Thrones. Why not make a reference?<br />
<br />
Justin frowned. The harpy race didn’t really allow for a lot of classes so his options were limited. After mulling between martial artist and bard for a few moments, he instead turned his attention to the Dragoon class and picked it. Again the harpy changed its clothes, but didn’t put much on. Just a blue piece of armor over her chest and crotch area. Attached the bottom piece of armor on its back was a large double ended lance that would probably be her weapon. Similar to her armor the harpy’s feathers were blue and sheshort blue hair that was covered by a small helmet. Her feet were like a bird’s talon and instead of hands she had wings. How she wielded that lance, Justin didn’t know.<br />
<br />
“June,” Justin said typing in the name, just picking the month.<br />
<br />
Adam had finally finished creating his character. He glanced at the others and sighed. “I guess I’ll be the healer then,” he muttered, making his class as the Priestess. The scylla had tanned skin and brown curly hair. She was wearing a white and red saint’s uniform and on her head was a white mushroomed shaped hat. He named her “Ana,” after his D&D character.<br />
<br />
“Are we ready?” he asked the others and they all nodded, looking ready to just humor him and get this entire thing over with. He sighed and clicked the start button.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the machine began to shake and all of them took a step away from it. “Um… is it supposed to do that?” Justin asked. <br />
<br />
Adam opened his mouth to answer only to see the screen flash white and blind him. A sudden bout of drowsiness and, before he even hit the ground, he fell unconscious.</p>
