<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Now don't worry. This will be fun.&quot; Mitch grinned as he pushed Kirk back against the wall. His handsome rugby teammate had finally gotten the hint and accompanied him into the secluded alley lay alongside the bar.<br />
<br />
Kirk leaned back, enjoying the sun-warmed stones of the wall. &quot;I'm not worried about fun; I'm worried about you doing me harm!&quot; He could see the flanker stretched tight and incredibly hard inside his white, button-up shorts.<br />
<br />
Free from the constraints of training - and jockstraps - for the afternoon, they'd come to the Island just before 2:00. However, all Kirk's plans to stuff their faces and go on the biggest, fastest rides went out the window when they found this bar, had a few glasses of Donkey Punch, and Mitch started getting frisky.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi,&quot; said Kirk with a grin. He slid his hands up over Mitch's hips, grabbed hold of his muscled butt, and pulled him towards his own distended whites.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi yourself.&quot; Mitch grinned wickedly as their bulges met... Pressing even closer, he captured Kirk's lips in a hard, passionate kiss. His hands roamed up the fly half's shoulders to his short tawny hair.<br />
<br />
Kirk groaned at the intensity, and the contact of Mitch's body against his own. Fuck the burgers and the rides! He'd be happy spending the rest of the day doing just this.<br />
<br />
Mitch gently massaged Kirk's hair with his fingers as they continued to kiss. Slowly, they slid down the wall, a jumble of arms and legs, until they were both on the ground. Purposefully, Mitch pinned Kirk beneath him, his hips pushing downwards. Both men moaned as their hard, imprisoned cocks pressed together.<br />
<br />
Deftly removing Kirk's dark blue rugby shirt, Mitch began teasing his teammate's body. Long, slow strokes with his tongue down the side of Kirk's neck were followed by a combination of quick love bites and hot, slow, kisses to the fly half's chest and abdomen.<br />
<br />
Kirk's breath became shallow and his hands moved to Mitch's short dark hair, clutching the curls. As the foreplay continued, he grew harder and harder, and when Mitch's tongue found the fuzz on his lower stomach, he nearly burst through his shorts!<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck!&quot; he gasped. &quot;Stop!&quot;<br />
<br />
The flanker grinned mischievously. &quot;Are you 'sure' you want me to stop?&quot; Lowering his head, he kissed one side of his teammate's navel. &quot;Stop this?&quot; With no response other than a low moan, Mitch reciprocated the action on the other side. &quot;And this?&quot; Still more moaning as Kirk clawed the ground beside him. &quot;And what about this?&quot; Before Kirk could respond, Mitch lapped the skin around his navel. Back and forth.. circling.. as his hand closed round the fly half's big white bulge...<br />
<br />
Kirk writhed in ecstasy. His skin was ablaze and tingling everywhere; his cock throbbed in Mitch's grasp. Burgers could wait. Rides could wait. At this particular moment, there was only one thing on his mind, and it didn't involve either he or his companion wearing this many clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you say?&quot; Mitch continued, his voice rumbling against Kirk's stomach as his fingers continued their dexterous work. But his time for fun was short-lived, as he suddenly found himself rolled over and pinned to the ground by his flushed and half-naked teammate.<br />
<br />
&quot;What I say...&quot; rasped Kirk as he hurriedly yanked Mitch's rugby shirt off, &quot;is fuck me... Right here, right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mitch groaned at Kirk's aggressive behaviour and lust-filled words. The eyes of both men were dark and filled with passion. He moaned as Kirk straddled his straining erection and rocked against it.<br />
<br />
Shorts, sports socks and trainers soon joined their shirts on the ground, and the two rugby players lay embracing one another on the warm stones of the alley.<br />
<br />
Mitch lay on top of Kirk, whose legs wrapped tightly around his waist. He pushed forward slowly but steadily, his big cock filling Kirk completely. As they gazed at each other, something passed between them, something unspoken, louder than words. Mitch felt as though his blood was on fire.<br />
<br />
&quot;Move. Now,&quot; rumbled Kirk as he grasped the flanker's back with his strong hands and urged him on. Mitch got the hint and sped up the thrusts of his hips, his belly pressing tightly against Kirk's taut, throbbing shaft.<br />
<br />
Harder and faster Mitch moved, his mouth suckling Kirk's neck and the dip of his collarbone. Words had ceased to escape his companion's lips. His eyes were squeezed shut, and his breathing was ragged and shallow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gonna shoot... Soon...&quot; gasped Mitch against his teammate's skin. He slid his left arm beneath Kirk's shoulder, turning his palm so he could clasp it from underneath, while his right hand curved around the fly half's straining cock and began to jerk him off in time to the thrusts of his own hips. It didn't take long for Kirk to reach his end, crying out loudly as he spurted copiously all over Mitch's hand and both of their chests and stomachs.<br />
<br />
Kirk's clenching sphincter gripped Mitch's cock, and brought about his own reactive climax. He erupted deep inside his lover, clutching him tightly as they each rode the waves of release. Then he collapsed on top of Kirk's gasping chest. After a few minutes, when he could move again, Mitch gently pulled out and flopped to his side. Both men were still trying to regain and steady their breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;F-u-u-c-k! That was... incredible!&quot; Kirk sputtered.<br />
<br />
Mitch gathered Kirk in his arms, legs entwined. &quot;It certainly was.&quot; He smiled and planted a long wet kiss on the other's sweaty forehead. &quot;Now let's grab a burger. I'm as hungry as a horse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kirk nodded his agreement. &quot;I'm as hungry as two horses!&quot; Slowly, and without embarrassment, they cleaned themselves up and began dressing, Kirk watching the progress of Mitch's white cotton rugby shorts as they pulled tight round his firm, rounded buttocks. 'Phwoar!' he thought, 'That butt was made for shorts!'<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah!&quot; Mitch exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Having trouble?&quot; Kirk asked, seeing his friend struggling to button up his fly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a bit,&quot; the other said, staring down at his crotch. &quot;I'm still...&quot; He grinned sideways at his teammate. &quot;I'm still hard...&quot;<br />
<br />
Kirk laughed. &quot;After shooting your bolt for the whole squad?!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Abruptly, Mitch bent forward, a look of surprised pleasure flooding his face. Rubbing the cleft of his butt with one hand, he no longer seemed bothered that his erect cock stuck out from his shorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Kirk asked in bewilderment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno...&quot; Mitch gasped, his hand still working away. &quot;But it feels... good!!&quot;<br />
<br />
As he spoke, his ears twitched and stretched upwards, brown hairs erupting from their tips. At the same time, the flanker's balls ballooned inside his snug white shorts. &quot;Wow!&quot; he exclaimed, reaching down to cup and feel them.<br />
<br />
With another gasp, he bent forward again, gripping his knees - clenching and unclenching his butt. His dark blue shirt pulled tight across his widening shoulder-blades. His exposed cock trebled in size. Hard shiny hooves replaced the toes on each naked foot, and his heels and ankles pulled upwards and merged.<br />
<br />
As Kirk stared in amazement, the seat of Mitch's rugby shorts surged outwards... and then surged again... splitting noisily to release a fast-growing, naked tail... The flanker grasped it delightedly as his back and shoulders grew too big for his blue shirt, ripping it in two. His hands pressed to the floor as his fingers fused together leaving single, horny structures in their place. His stomach swelled, becoming big and rounded. His gigantic cock thrust forward like a lance. Hairs burst through the skin of his long, writhing tail, and a dark tassel grew from its tip. When his face pushed forward into a donkey's muzzle, he grunted and snorted happily.<br />
<br />
By now Kirk was pressed against the wall of the alleyway. His jaw dropped as he saw Mitch's shorts stretch...and finally burst! His teammate's mass was increasing dramatically, his arms and legs fast becoming muscular, equine limbs. His torso, too, was expanding, and his buttocks had bulked up enormously. His well-kept teeth became large, prominent slabs, and hundreds of coarse brown hairs erupted out of his straining skin, rapidly covering the rest of his hide.<br />
<br />
Finally, the transformation ended, and Mitch stood on all fours, all movement stilled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mitch? Is that still you?&quot; Kirk asked, running a hand through his hair. Slowly, the donkey turned to look at Kirk and stared at him through big brown eyes. With something like a grin, he began to buck and kick, braying loudly, then galloped off towards the street. Kirk stared after him, incredulous. What the fuck had just--?!<br />
<br />
Suddenly, he bent down. His white shorts pushed out behind him. Reaching back, he felt a taut, unmistakable bulge. Kirk groaned softly; a smile spread over his face. Dropping onto all fours, he shouted down the alley to his friend, &quot;Wait for me!&quot;</p>
