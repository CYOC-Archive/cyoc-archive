<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dave decided to table that for now, at least until he got a good lay of the land. He grabbed the pen and a notebook, just in case inspiration should strike, and got up to take a look.<br />
<br />
He didn’t need to look far as Jax was busy typing away at his desk right outside Dave’s door. Remembering the twinks talented mouth Dave smiled. He deserved a reward.<br />
<br />
He thought for a second before writing ‘Jax’s seat has a built in 10-inch vibrating dildo that’s always randomly changing patterns.’<br />
<br />
Immediately Jax’s demeanor changed. His fluid typing slowed considerably, and he seemed to be attempting to press himself further into the seat. He still had his pants on but now there was a hole in the back for the dildo and his erection was on display under the Lycra, with a growing dark patch at the head. If Dave listened closely, he could just make out the faint sound of the vibrations.<br />
<br />
“How’s it going Jax?”<br />
<br />
“Soooooo good Mr. Jones.” Jax practically purred as he felt the vibrations change.<br />
<br />
“Not overwhelmed currently?”<br />
<br />
“To be honest sir,” Jax bit his lip and eyed Dave hungrily. “I could always handle some more.”<br />
<br />
“Well I’m sure you can find someone to give you a hand, and if you still need some when I get back, I’ll see what I can do.” Dave winked and put his hand on Jax’s shoulder, firmly pushing him into the seat and producing a moan of pleasure from his secretary before heading out to the rest of the office.<br />
<br />
It truly was a sight to behold. Anyone who had been a woman was now a buff, sexy gay man. Some of the guys with offices like Dave were noticeably bigger, while some ran more to the leaner side, toned but more twunkish than hunkish, and a few were absolutely gigantic. All of them were clad in tight, form fitting Lycra, although some had elected to lose the top halves. There were even one or two guys who elected to go one step further and were just in jocks and ties.<br />
<br />
There was a simmering undercurrent of sex all throughout the office as Dave noticed several men making out or getting blown at their desks. Walking into the break room Dave found two guys fucking each other at one end of a table while another ate lunch at the other end lazily stroking his cock but otherwise unperturbed. It was kind of difficult to recognize anyone as they had all changed quite a bit, but Dave was pretty sure the hunk getting fucked was Kent from legal while the guy eating lunch had been Sophie, Kent’s wife.<br />
<br />
“Hey Dave.” A huge Asian man wave to him from over by the coffee pot. He wasn’t as big as Chris (god was anyone?) but he still looked like he would be a serious contender at any heavyweight bodybuilding competition. As Dave walked over to him (getting groped both by Probably Kent and his fucker in the process) he noted that the man had elected to go shirtless but his Lycra tights showed off his tree trunk legs and ample bulge nicely. It took Dave a second to place him as Glenn, the guy who’d had the cubical next to him before his promotion. “How’s the promotion treating you?”<br />
<br />
“So far I can honestly say it’s been life changing.” Dave response as he grabbed a cup and not at all subtly checked out his friend.<br />
<br />
“I can tell,” Glenn grinned and bounced his pecs before reaching out and swiping something out of Dave’s hair. Dave realized it was some of Chris’s cum and was about to say something, but Glenn just popped the finger in his mouth. “Yummy. I saw Mr. Reynolds coming out of your office. Lucky bastard.”<br />
<br />
“Me or him?”<br />
<br />
“Why can’t it be both?” Glenn laughed. “Maybe later I can swing by and you can show me the new office? Maybe even play around a little with your new secretary?” Glenn winked and cupped Dave’s bulge.<br />
<br />
“Absolutely.” He smirked and pulled his friend into a kiss before grabbing his coffee and departing, but not before he witnessed “Used to be Sophie” open his mouth and be showered in jizz as “Probably Kent” came hard.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t until he passed by one of the mirrors that now dotted the office that Dave finally got a good look at himself post Chris induced change. Fuck he was hot! He ran his hands over his new bulging pecs and down his abs, all well and truly on display under his new skintight Lycra work uniform. It was stained in places from the remnants of Chris’s epic fuckstick, but that just made it even sexier. Dave flexed his bicep and proceeded to lick and kiss the massive mound, he didn’t care who saw him. He’d wanted a body like this for years and now he had it and was going to appreciate it. Besides, in this office it barely constituted abnormal behavior.<br />
<br />
“Oh fuck yeah, that’s what I like to see.” Someone purred behind him. Dave turned to find himself face to face with Joe, his manager. Only in this reality he was very different. He used to be a slightly brow beaten, over stressed, tight ass who Dave always thought looked much older than his 49 years. Now though, all that remained was a very tight ass. The new Joe was one of the few men in nothing but a jock, his body was not as huge as Glenn or Dave, but it was big enough that even if he’d put clothes on, he’d stop traffic. Most of the men in the office were smooth but Joe let his dark body hair grow along with a thick pornstar mustache. Although his bulge was impressive, the real star of the show was Joe’s incredible ass, perky and oh so tight and a good deal larger than the others in the office. He was still 49, but now instead of looking older he looked roughly a decade younger and he loved it. Joe reached out and grabbed a hold of Dave’s other bicep. “I love it when you do that Davey, makes you so much hotter.”<br />
<br />
Dave quickly masked his shock with a smirk. “You like that sir?” Joe shivered.<br />
<br />
“You know I do big guy. It’s so much fun to watch guys like you appreciate their muscles.” Locking eyes with Dave he slowly stuck his tongue out and licked his way up a large vein on Dave’s arm. “Let’s take five and you can give me a more interactive show. The other guys are good but you’re my favorite.”<br />
<br />
Half of Dave’s brain was sputtering in shock. The changes to the office had turned his uptight manager into the office slut, and considering what he’d just left behind in the breakroom that was saying a lot. However the other half of his brain was too busy grabbing Joes ass and pulling him close. Apparently this new body came with one or two personality upgrades as well.<br />
<br />
“You say that to all the guys here.” Dave growled, squeezing the muscular booty. Joe out right squealed and began rutting against Dave’s thigh<br />
<br />
“So what? You’re my favorite right now. We can go into my office and open the blinds so everyone can see.”<br />
<br />
Dave spun Joe around and smacked him hard on the ass, loud enough to make a few guys look over and laugh. One even wolf whistled. “Gimme a minute sir, I’ve got a few things to take care of.<br />
<br />
Joe honest to god pouted and gave a little huff. “Fine, but you better come see me later. That’s an order.”<br />
<br />
Dave left and looked around the office. From here he could see Jax at his desk, still typing but now actively bouncing up and down in his seat. In the breakroom Glenn had shucked his tights and was busy holding “Used to be Sophie” on his shoulders, his cock in his mouth, while “Probably Kent” was busy tonguing his abs. Finally Joe was leaning over the desk of some guy in a cubical whose fingers were hard at work probing Joe’s asshole, yet caught Dave’s eye and winked. Dave looked down at the pen and the nearly empty notebook and considered his options.</p>
