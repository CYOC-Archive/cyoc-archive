<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>"...Lisa." So her new name was Lisa. She had to admit that she liked that name. She smiled as she thought of what her middle 
name might be. She was betting that it was Sue. Lisa Sue Plunkett just rolled off the tongue with ease or so she thought. She laid back 
on her bed and opened her diary to the last entry which was dated today.</p>
<p><I>March 5, 2011</p>
<p>Dear diary,</p>
<p>I can hardly believe that it's been a year since Adam and I have been going out. He's such a sweet and kind guy to me that I can 
hardly believe my luck. I love him so much and I wish that we'll always be together. That may not happen though if that bitch Gem has 
her way. She thinks she should have Adam instead of me. Can you believe that? You know that I'm not racist and would never think 
badly of some because of the color of their skin. I'm friends with Tara and she's as dark as an African-American comes. No, what rubs 
me the wrong way with Gem is that she's a manipulative bitch. I was almost arrested because of a rumor she started about me doing 
naughty things with Megan and Roger. They're four years old for god's sake. Luckily it was found to be a malicious rumor and I was 
cleared. Unfortunately I lost my babysitting job and haven't been able to find a new one since. All this because Gem wants Adam and 
she thought I would go to jail over it. I could see the hatred in her eyes as she saw Adam standing by me through it all. The police had 
been able to trace the rumor back to Gem but she had told them she had overheard a couple boys talking about it. And you know what? 
The police believed her even though she couldn't tell them who the boys were. Sorry for dumping this on you again diary but I needed to 
get it off my chest again because I'm a bit nervous about tonight.</p>
<p>Adam's parents are out of town for the weekend and he's going to come pick me up and take me to his house. I'm not sure what 
will happen but I think we'll end up having sex. I know Mom and Dad want me to wait but I love him and I've been having fantasies 
about us having sex. I'm nervous about doing it for real though. Will it feel as good as I imagined it would? What if it isn't that good? 
What if it's horrible? Will we break up if it's horrible? I don't want that to happen. Maybe I should wait until I get a little practice with 
something other than my fingers. But if I do that will I ever have the courage to try sex with Adam? Maybe we should try it tonight. 
Even though Mom and Dad want me to wait they know that teenagers experiment with sex so they have bought condoms for us to use if 
we do have sex. They also gave me a cream that they said was spermicide so if the condom broke I wouldn't get pregnant. I don't 
know how I feel about getting pregnant. I do want children but I don't think I want them while I'm still in school. There's so many girls 
who have had babies that it almost seems that it's expected that a girl my age would get pregnant. I guess it wouldn't be so bad if I did 
get pregnant. In health class we had to take care of a realistic baby doll. I got a girl and I was sad that I had to give her back at the end 
of the month even though I had to get up in the middle of the night to feed and change her. Even though I was tired during the day I 
was happy. I guess I might have gone a bit overboard on the assignment but I got the highest grade out of the class. Even though I 
knew she was a doll I couldn't help but see her as a real living baby. Maybe I should try to get pregnant since I miss having a baby. 
Maybe I'll talk it over with Mom and Dad. See what they think about me becoming pregnant.</p>
<p>Well I'll let you go for now diary. I promise to tell you what happens tonight.</I></p>
<p>So her boyfriend was named Adam and she was evidently madly in love with him. She was evidently worried about this Gem 
breaking them up. Looking at the picture she thought that Adam may be Mexican and she was glad that she wasn't racist.</p>
<p>She closed her diary just as her mom came back in and said, "I found your birth certificate and an adoption certificate."</p>
<p>"Adoption certificate?" Lisa asked sitting up.</p>
<p>"Apparently we adopted you a couple years ago," her mom said handing her the papers. "Your name is Lisa Sue Dickens and you 
were born on July 3, 1995.</p>
<p>"So I didn't take your last name?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Doesn't look like it and I don't know why," her mom said looking a little lost. "I don't know how we'll find out why without appearing 
to be crazy so we just may have to accept the fact that you're last name is Dickens instead of Plunkett. Now perhaps you should get 
your clothes back on before someone else sees you."</p>
<p>"I forgot I was naked," she said blushing. As her mom left she started getting dressed thinking about how awkward tonight could 
be.</p></p>
