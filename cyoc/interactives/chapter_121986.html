<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan got out of the shower after thoroughly enjoying his new body.  He explored every inch of it with his new fingers, his firm muscular arms and legs, his lean core, his big sensitive cock, even his tight new ass.  Ryan couldn’t ever remember feeling as confident or powerful in his whole life.  Ryan had always been bookish and anxious as a child.  He had been too afraid to play sports or workout.  He thought he’d be teased for not knowing how to do it right, not to mention his fear of others seeing his little penis. So instead he immersed himself in academics.  After a while Ryan almost prided himself on being a beta male.  He was sensitive and caring and his wife liked that about him, or at least he thought she did.  <br />
<br />
Ryan thought about all of this as he dried off and exited his bathroom.  There on his bed, someone had laid out football gear.  What was he suppose to do with this, Ryan thought to himself.  “Umm Mom?” he called down figuring that was how Jake would do it, “Why is football stuff out?” Ryan heard Jake’s mother yelled back from down the hall, “because you have practice tonight and your father thinks you should still go.”  Ryan picked up the shoulder pads and defaulted to his usual practice and started thinking of excuses to skip out.  He couldn’t play football. What if he embarrassed himself? What if he got hurt? What if...his thought process trailed off as he caught a glimps of his still naked body in the mirror holding the equipment.  It wouldn’t be Ryan playing football, it would be Jake.  Ryan was filled with an odd sense of confidence, even if he completely failed it, what would it matter Jake would be the face of that failure.  Hell Ryan thought, he might even try to ham it up just to knock peoples opinion of this little shit down a few pegs.  At the very least it would be a good way to get out of the house and hear what people had heard about Mr. Morris.<br />
<br />
After a few attempts, Ryan got all of the practice gear on in the right order.  He took great pleasure in stuffing himself into the cup.  Ryan went downstairs ate the sandwich that was waiting for him and got a ride from this mother back to the school for football practice.  Once again Jake’s mother talked incessantly not leaving any room for anyone else to get a word in elsewise.  Ryan was grateful to finally get out of the car and walk over to the football field.  There was an almost a palpable waive of testosterone and machismo that hit him as he approached.  Ryan recognized a number of the students from various classes. He could name about 10 of the 14 boys.  He’d have to bluff his way through any interactions with the others.  <br />
<br />
There wasn’t much time to chat with anyone, Ryan was a bit behind and practice started immediately on his arrival.  The coach started them off with some running and then catching.  Mr. Johnson the coach wasn’t one to ease into anything.  Ryan could keep up with the running and even managed to catch a majority of the balls that came his way.  He thought he was doing pretty well; maybe he’d pull this off.  It wasn’t until they started running plays that Ryan was completely out of his depth.  Ryan hadn’t heard of any these plays, he didn’t know what a statute of liberty, or flea flicker was.  Ryan struggled through the second half of practice.  He noticed the looks of disappointment on both his teammates and the couch’s faces.  Finally practice was over, Mr. Johnson called Jake over and told him that while he understood that he’d been through a lot today he expected Jake to bring it to the next practice and game this weekend. <br />
<br />
Ryan grabbed his gym bag, rejoined his teammates, and headed to the locker room.   When they got into the locker room, the boys started to strip down.  “What was up with you today, Jake?” asked Luke. Ryan almost forgot to respond, he’d have to get use to being called Jake. “Nothing man” he responded, “I’m still a little freaked out about Mr. Morris. Anyone hear anything else about that?” There was a chorus of answers from different people in different states of undress.  The general gist of it all was that Mr. Morris was at Memorial Hospital in a coma.  Ryan followed the lead of everyone else and stripped down before heading to the showers.  <br />
<br />
Ryan kept his eyes up and forward, terrified about being naked around so many other guys.  He would never have done this in his former body, but then again he wasn’t in his former body.  Luke took the shower next to his, “I heard that old fag coughed on you,” he stated, “you didn’t catch gay did you?” Ryan looked over at Luke shocked, not knowing how to respond. “Just kidding man” Luke said a little put off by Ryan’s response, “Whats up with you today?” Ryan tried to pull it together, “No, no gay. I’m just tired today.”  Ryan dropped his eyes, not use to holding the gaze of another more assertive male.  He took in a full view of Luke’s penis. It was smaller than Jake’s but bigger than Ryan’s old one.  “See something you like?” Luke asked snarkily. “Yea it looks like a penis,” Ryan said his voice quivering a bit, “but smaller.”  This made Luke and the rest of the boys showing crack up.  Ryan got a few slaps on the back.  “Well we can’t all have your king beast” Luke responded, through a forced laugh.  <br />
<br />
Ryan finished up, he tried to steal a few more glances at the penises around the locker room.  From what he could tell, Jake had the biggest.  This boosted his self confidence further.  Ryan got headed out and got into Jake’s mom’s waiting car feeling better about himself than he had in a long time.  They made it home just in time for dinner.</p>
