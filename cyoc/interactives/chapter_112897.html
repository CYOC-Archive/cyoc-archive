<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt’s head was swimming. The situation was just bizarre. Apparently, there was some kind of old lab down in the college basement that somehow everyone seemed to have forgotten about, even though it was obviously still functional. Then, over the course of just a few minutes, two different students stumbled upon it by accident, were forced to inhale some strange gas and released into a… waiting room? Well, it seemed that way.<br />
“This appears to be a waiting room”, he explained his thoughts, and “maybe the doors are designed to open after a specific amount of time has passed.”<br />
Luke was terrified. “H-how can you stay this calm? We need to get out of here now! I have a date with my girlfriend in two hours! What if we run out of air, or, or we just starve because you were wrong?!”<br />
“We’d die of thirst, first”, Matt stated drily, letting himself fall to the couch.<br />
Luke was more than a bit annoyed at Matt right now. He needed to do something! Sitting around never solved any problems! Normally, he would probably have agreed with Matt, but right now, he felt so full of energy, so angry at the situation, he just needed to act. Without thinking twice and only replying with a grumpy growl, Matt stormed to the door he came in through. That stupid thing just had to open again!<br />
He steadied himself as good as possible on the doorframe and began to push against the heavy metal door, trying to force it open. Being a history major, Luke wasn’t exactly well build and soon he needed a break, sweat dripping from his forehead and breathing heavily. He looked back to Matt on the couch, already opening his mouth to ask for some help. He didn’t though. Matt wasn’t much stronger than he was and what kind of men would he be if he didn’t manage to open a door alone. Instead, he just hit the door with his fist and switched to the third door, the one on the opposing wall. Maybe that would budge.<br />
Taking a deep breath, Luke pushed against the dull metal with all his might, teeth grit together. This time, he must have hit a better position, because he didn’t loose his breath so quickly. In fact, he only stopped pushing (although the door didn’t move an inch) when he heard an audible ripping sound.<br />
Luke turned around confused. Matt was still sitting on the couch, with a strange look on his face, staring at him. But no sign of the ripping sound there. However, as Luke looked down on himself, he saw the reason right there.  His shirt looked like it was painted on him, straining with every movement. In the middle, between his massive pecs, there was a huge rip across his chest. As he moved his right arm to touch it, the right sleeve followed with another ripping sound, as the fabric capitulated to his huge biceps. <br />
Luke was confused for a moment. That wasn’t his body, he was supposed to be much smaller. It wasn’t only his shirt, as well: His Jeans felt constricting around the waist and his shoes and socks seemed more than a size too small. <br />
He disregarded that thought quickly however. Of course that was his body. It’s how a proper guy is supposed to look like! That shirt however needed to go. With his massive right hand, he ripped the remains of the checkered fabric off his frame. After thinking for a short time, he decided to kick off his shoes and socks as well – the shoes were hurting him and he didn’t have a good grip wearing socks – and leaned in against the door again, huge mounds of muscle bulging on his upper body, glistening from sweat.<br />
Matt was concerned. Something very strange was happening here and he couldn’t quite explain. Maybe the gas was some kind of hallucinogenic chemical. There could hardly be another explanation for what he was seeing: Over the last few minutes, Luke had easily gained more than a hundred pounds of muscle and at least a foot in height. If he wasn’t mistaken, Luke’s hair also seemed longer and a bit lighter than before. Luke didn’t seem to notice or care though, until he ripped off his shirt and continued pushing.<br />
Matt on the other hand felt weak. He tried to call out to Luke, but his mouth was strangely dry, producing only a whisper that went by unheard. He wasn’t sure if he would be able to stand up, but he had to try. Slowly, he got to his feet, taking an unsure step towards the much bigger man. Everything seemed bigger, and his head was swimming. And there was something else. Luke was… incredibly attractive. Matt was very sure he was not gay – he kissed a guy once as part of a bet and he found it really disgusting – but Luke… He had some animalistic attraction that was just… Matt blushed, as he found his dick rising to attention, leaving him with a throbbing erection as he took another step towards Luke, almost closing the distance now.<br />
Just at that time, both men heard a loud PLING – and Luke found the growing constraining feeling on his waist subside. His jeans button had lost the fight to contain him and flew off against the metal door. Luke looked down on himself angrily. This pants were no good. They were straining all over his legs and now the button just flew off. Using both hands, he made short process of the denim (and his underwear as well), half shredding them to two, half pulling them off, leaving only a heap of shredded fabric. <br />
Luke was now standing in the nude in front of the door, grinning for a short moment as his 10 inch soft monster of a cock swung free. Just then, he noticed Matt, who was barely holding on his feet a step away from him. Luke felt a rush of disgust hit him. Weakling. City-dwellers like this guy were next to useless, except for serving him and being fucked by him. A voice in his mind was screaming at him loudly now, that he was straight, he had a girlfriend and this was all so very wrong, but Luke knew better. He was Luk, the barbarian warrior, the pinnacle of manliness and he knew for a fact the he loved to fuck guys. Weaklings like this one for example. Luk turned around and asked in his deep, booming voice “What you want?” and grinned dumbly as he felt blood rushing to his cock.<br />
Matt couldn’t believe his eyes. Just like that, Luke had completely disrobed in front of him and didn’t even feel ashamed. Not that there was anything to be ashamed of. He gulped drily and whispered an answer, but nothing was to be heard. He couldn’t help himself. He just had to touch that beast of a man.<br />
As he took the last step, his legs collapsed under him, leaving him too weak to stand and sending him to his knees. Being right in front of the massive and very much erected rod of Luke, Matt barely noticed his own cloths sliding down around his shoulders and to the ground on his much thinner frame, leaving him as naked as the man in front of him. <br />
Unable to answer in words and driven by his desire to touch him, Matt leaned forward, his mouth opening and engulfing the tip Luk’s massive cock. <br />
“Fuck yeah, come here now!” Luk shouted and grabbed Matt’s head with his right hand and onto his crotch. Matt was a bit taken aback, but soon he found it easiest just letting the larger man take the initiative and wrapped his arms around Luk’s massive waist. <br />
And that he did. Luk fucked Matts face roughly, while Matt’s whole body underwent the last changes. His bones and teeth were the first to go, followed by his skin turning to a dark brown. His whole body flattened and shortened, while his hands fused together behind Luk’s back. Soon, Matt found himself hanging from Luk’s waist, and what started as a blowjob became more and more jacking off through Matt’s head – which was now rather distorted, as he was wrapped around Luk’s pole.<br />
The only thing still protruding from his flat body was his own dick, standing erected and ridiculously large – not overall, but in comparison to the rest of his body. What was left of his legs was fused together and thrashing around wildly, as Luk worked his cock with ever louder moans. With all the rest of his strength, Matt swung his lower body up between Luk’s wide stance, his feet connecting and firmly attaching to his fused arms, that had become dark brown leather strips.  Luk’s moans doubled, as Matt’s perpetual erect leather dick entered his rear hole, becoming underwear and plug in one. That was all, Luk could take. With an echoing shout, he came into his new leather loincloth for the first, but certainly not the last time. Panting, Luk registered that, with a screeching sound, the exit door slid open.<br />
The enormous barbarian warrior, with his shoulder length blonde hair, a body made of slabs of pure muscle and a brown leather loincloth with an extension for an ass plug and a wet spot on the front exited the room where not long ago, two students entered.</p>
