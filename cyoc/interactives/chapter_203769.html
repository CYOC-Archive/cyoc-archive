<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You have an epiphany. This feeling is so glorious, so rapturous. It’s this little secret that all the women of the world have kept to themselves. This feels so good from the peaks of your soft breasts to the slippery shape of your hot pussy. And you have the ability to give it to anyone, at any time. It kind of makes you even wetter to consider. <br />
<br />
Returning to your room, you plop and jiggle down on your bed as you look over the tiny but amazing, life-changing little flashlight you bought for just a few bucks. <br />
<br />
Cautiously, you check the battery case to see what kind it takes. Your heart flutters in your heavy chest as it pops loose and you look inside. AA. Several of them but they look generic. The instructions included with the device didn’t tell you much except to say it was bound to the user. Squinting, you notice there’s a QR code printed inside with the batteries. <br />
<br />
With your phone, you carefully scan it and are taken to an online PDF file with a long URL. The company looks Chinese on the text and site information but the bulk of the document is readable. <br />
<br />
It explains that the user can pass permission to anyone holding the flashlight to prevent them from losing memory of the changes. But this only works if the user and the guest are holding the flashlight at the same time. You put that away in your memory for now.<br />
<br />
Down further, the document explains that a small section of the flashlight can be turned to enable different modes. A full turn to the right flashes a rough LED presentation of a globe. The instructions explain that this is a setting with global consequences. If you’re reading this right, you realize this means you can effectively rewrite any human attribute if you want. You can make it so men never existed. That’s intimidating and scary but a little sexy.<br />
<br />
Two full turns flash a human figure with what looks like Spidey sense above their head. This means your target is aware of what you have done. With a half turn, a figure holding the flashlight appears with dash lines of transparency. The document explains that people remember being changed with this setting but they won’t think you have done it. It’ll be like you’re invisible to them when holding the flashlight. That sounds like a good idea to you. <br />
<br />
With more turns, you find a specific setting for inanimate objects and clothing depicted with LEDs. There’s also a mental setting that doesn’t affect the outward body, labeled with a human brain. There’s even more stuff after that if you make combinations of turns to the left and right to program different presets but you feel you have a firm grasp on the main ones you want to have fun with.<br />
<br />
As a test, you aim bright, inanimate pink at your closet. The light washes over the area of the sliding door and the material of the walls seem to drink the illumination in like brilliant water. Smirking, you watch. You caught a little bit of the desk in the beam and your laptop is soon covered in a bright plethora of stickers with muscular men and fashionable ladies. Pink art and natural forms spread across the rest. <br />
<br />
Slipping to your feet, you just take a minute to survey the laptop before sliding open the closet. Inside, everything is organized as though a professional has done it. Jackets are arranged by sliding tone and size along with dresses, pants and skirts in separate sections and several deep ledges just bursting with heels that both tower and sit low with delicate sparkly straps. Your nipples are hard and vaguely achy in the cool room air, so you search quickly for a drawer with your brand new underwear.<br />
<br />
The first problem presents itself as you quickly slide on a cool roomy thong with a pale blue tone and fringes of lace. You like it and how it sits on your new body but your eye catches something else that might be just as fun to try. Indecision piles on your slim shoulders as you pose with one bra, then another, and then one that hikes your cleavage to delicious levels. So many options. Spinning in a teal skirt which bounces against your thighs as it suggests and reveals, you assure yourself that there will be plenty of time for trying on things later. Completing your ensemble with a blue, button-up blouse that can barely fight against your vast bosom, you leave the top a few buttons undone for presentation.<br />
<br />
Flashlight, once you set it to the mode you want next, rests comfortably inside a purse you grab. Tingles of exultation invade you as you make your way out. You’re going out as a girl, a beautiful lady. A quick glance in the mirror almost makes you swoon but also triggers your hesitancy. You could definitely fix your hair and probably find some makeup to touch up some of your skin. Not to mention there are probably better clothing combinations… But you stop yourself. Later.<br />
<br />
As you expected, none of your roommates are in right now. You wonder if you’ll find them out and about. The threshold of the door is exciting and terrifying. You are walking out with your petite, soft flesh so delicately exposed. Everyone who looks on you will see the cute busty girl that you are. A slippery feeling between your thighs is inescapable, as you shuffle your feet in a pair of flats. Butterflies spin in all directions through your body. You hope you can stay on your feet.<br />
<br />
Your arousal is private, soft, intimate, and yet still feels like it’s being broadcast to the entire world. Your immense, hard nipples are surely showing through the frail bra and blouse you selected. Of all the girls you have seen walking along in your life and spied covertly with a mixture of emotions ranging from lust to envy, you are now in the same sort of skin. <br />
<br />
The hallway is clear, to your relief and disappointment. Stepping towards the common room is a slow, heart-racing prospect. Some boys are milling about but they come and go through the sliding doors. Only when you reach the main common room next to the residents assistant office do you really start to see other people. <br />
<br />
The widescreen flat panel television next to the vending machines is showing some cowboy program from the 1990s. Four guys stand around the billiards table taking turns shooting. <br />
<br />
The first one you notice keeps returning to a black-and-white guitar set off to the side. His feathered hair seems somewhere between a dark yellow and messy brown. Clear-framed glasses adorn his face and he wears a generic, wrinkly tan shirt along with jeans. <br />
<br />
Leaning back with his pool cue wrapped in his arms like a exercise bar, the guy to his right has a lean, long face with a half finished brown beard. His messy hair rises like a pack of crumpled tissues. A gray Star Wars shirt with some spacecraft adorns his flat chest and black, matching shorts dangle to his bony knees. <br />
<br />
On the other side of the table from him, a small guy with pitch black hair levels a hundred yard stare at some position ahead of him. He’s small and his wildly askew locks look like he’s never brushed them in his life. He has bright pink, bow-like lips drawn into a practically pained expression. <br />
<br />
The last guy is setting up the next shot. He has on a red t-shirt with some math formula joke probably only ten people on campus will get. His movements appear antsy, as though he’s ready for a restroom run. His blonde hair looks good but also swept to the side unevenly, as though he just got it cut and forgot to trim that end. A swift hand brushes it out of his left eye as he slides his stick back-and-forth. A pair of loose black pants still can’t hide his prominent rear.<br />
<br />
You judge the four of them and feel a pang of conflict. A few of them are real cute in ways you hadn’t considered before. You might want them to wrap their firm arms around you as they walk you back to your room for a little private fun. The temptation tightens your nether regions until you take a single quiet breath and remember what you came out here to do.<br />
<br />
Turning on what you consider the stealth mode, while keeping that Spidey sense awareness, you aim for the dark-haired guy who appears so dismal. He could definitely use a light beam of girlness in his life. Carefully aiming the light so you just catch him, you lay a focused beam on his body. <br />
<br />
The first thing that happens is the narrow shape of his head compresses into a round full form with broad cheeks. His wild hair falls back, like a sleek, brushed curtain, spreading around his shoulder to his chest on one side. His immediate reaction is to bat at it, like some fallen bug or sliver of debris from the ceiling. He only has an instant to look up before the wave of all the other changes crash into him. His dark shirt spirals out like a short dress, dipping to his thighs while his whole body drops several inches of height. A tiny black leather skirt just pokes out of the bottom with a garter belt striking and merging with a pair of silken black thigh highs. A black velvet spiked choker laces around his tiny throat. <br />
<br />
A tiny girl squeak, loud enough to shatter glass if it had the energy, bursts out of his soft throat. By now, the other guys I have looked up and see that something is amiss, but all stand in frozen shock. The new girl‘s eyes are traced by Egyptian black eyeliner and her broad, pouty lips are matte obsidian. The pool cue slips from her black fingernails (and rolls around on the carpet) as she gasps in surprise. <br />
<br />
“Ohmygosh!” Her petite hands race around and also dart away from the shape of her body as she looks to her compatriots for an explanation. <br />
<br />
The only response is by the antsy dude, as he finally settles in place and can only offer, “Dude…what?”<br />
<br />
It doesn’t take long before the new girl desperately scampers towards the nearest hallway, while shifting her stride from loping frantic to restrained, as though discovering new sensations every few seconds to make her wary. <br />
<br />
You’re not deterred by her panic. You know she’ll find joy and beauty in this shape soon enough.</p>
