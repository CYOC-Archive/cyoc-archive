<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gloria scoffed at the Antonio, the trainee tailor.  &quot;I was told to expect quality, and this is what I get?  Some baggy sack on the third try?  If I wanted something like this, then I would&#39;ve just made it myself!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, I am terribly sorry for my lack of experience, but I believe your daughter will find my work very helpful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joanna scrunched her face in confusion.  Her mother didn&#39;t know the first thing about sewing, much less tailoring.  She also didn&#39;t have any material to work with at home.  It was around this time that she realized her mother was rapidly tapping on her phone with her sights set on Antonio.  &quot;Mom!  He did a fine job with what he had to work with.  I...Like it.  You don&#39;t have to-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t &#39;have to&#39; anything!&quot;  She paused, looking down at her phone for a few seconds before twisting her lips into a smile.  &quot;But if you like it, I suppose Antonio deserves a reward.&quot;  She accentuated her final word with a single press on the screen.<br />
<br />
Antonio&#39;s pants evaporated, leaving his lower body exposed for a few brief seconds.  His genitals were quickly covered by folds of fat as everything below his thighs blimped in size, packing on hundreds of pounds faster than Joanna could comprehend it.  His lower body quickly became the more significant half of his body as flesh continued to pile over itself until she couldn&#39;t even recognize his lower half.  Both legs had melded into a single mass.<br />
<br />
The flesh-colored mass continued to swell, pushing Antonio&#39;s upper body higher as it continued to expand outwards.  Joanna struggled to understand what her mother had done, as it looked like the tailor had just been fused to a giant half-circle of flesh.  It pulsed and contorted like there were massive muscles hidden beneath.  His lower body began to shudder and...sweat?<br />
<br />
Joanna took several steps away from Antonio to get a better look.  &quot;What did you do to him?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t do anything.  Ask him yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
The sweat was now congealing on the floor around Antonio.  His lower body was nearly the size of a car before it finally stopped growing.  It looked like a sweaty, flesh-colored tail of some sort.  &quot;Ah, there&#39;s no need to worry miss.  I&#39;m surprised you managed to go so long without asking me!&quot;  There was a weird smacking sound as Antonio lifted the front half of the mass off the ground and contorted himself to face Joanna.  &quot;I was born with a rare condition where my lower body is that of a slug.  Your mother most certainly did not do anything to cause this to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gloria smiled at her daughter.  &quot;See?  I asked for their slowest, and Antonio truly is that.&quot;<br />
<br />
The tailor waved a hand as his lower body started to ripple and slowly move forward, leaving behind a thick trail what Joanna now realized must be mucus.  He wasn&#39;t terribly slow due to the massive size, but he was most certainly doomed to a slow walking pace.  &quot;Hah, I never knew Mary had such a sense of humor!  Please put in a good word for me!  They do not like it when I walk where the customers walk, so I barely get to see her during the workday!&quot;<br />
<br />
She waved him away.  &quot;Yes, yes.  Come along, Joanna.  We need to pay for the tailor&#39;s work.  Then we can go home and you can get milked&quot;<br />
<br />
Joanna was in disbelief at her mother, but she knew what would happen if she opened her mouth.  Instead, she slowly lumbered her oversized body to the door, carefully weaved her udder through the doorway, and followed her mother to the front desk.  She turned back to see Antonio struggling to leave the room, as he was clearly taller than the opening and his lower half was squeezed by the door&#39;s frame.  She turned back to her mother.  &quot;Mom, you can&#39;t just keep changing people like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her mother cast a critical eye in her direction.  &quot;I can change anything I feel like in any way that I feel like.  In fact...&quot;  With a few taps, the cashier&#39;s chest ballooned outward as a second, third, and fourth set of breasts grew in beneath, forcing the woman to sit upright.  Each row strained her shirt severely, with the lowest pair being practically unconcealed entirely.  Her mother said in a half-whisper, &quot;See?&quot;<br />
<br />
The cashier absent-mindedly tucked her fourth row of tits back into her uniform.  &quot;Thank you for your patronage.&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;I didn&#39;t hear any &#39;have a nice days&#39; from you.&quot; Her mother tapped the phone, and the woman&#39;s shirt nearly burst as her breasts expanded again.  &quot;Oh, right.  Antonio asked that I put in a good word for him.  It took him a few tries, but he managed to make something passable eventually.  He at least understands different body well enough.&quot;  She paused and looked down at the cashier&#39;s chest.  &quot;I think that maybe you should contact Antonio about getting something done with your attire.  Different body type, and all.&quot;<br />
<br />
The cashier gave a nod as she also looked down.  &quot;Hmm, good point.  Maybe this one shrank in the wash, or my chest grew a little since I last checked.&quot;  She stood up, pulling her taut uniform down with one hand while using the other to brace and shove her bottom-most row of breasts back in.  She raised her voice as Antonio was about halfway through the doorway.  &quot;Antonio!  Before you get out of there, think you can do me a favor?&quot;<br />
<br />
Joanna was sick of what her mother was doing.  She felt her udder pulse once more, a grim reminder that it was only a matter of time before her latest accessory changes from a useful cover to a painful cage.  Worse yet, she noticed how tiring it was to move all this weight around.  She wasn&#39;t sure how much longer it&#39;d be until her mother&#39;s leg-altering change came into play, and she didn&#39;t want to find out.  She followed her mother out, but realized there was no way she&#39;d be able to fit in the front seat, or the back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, mom...?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her mother opened the driver&#39;s side door &quot;Yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think I can fit in the front seat?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her mother gave an exasperated sigh, then got out of the car.  Looking at her daughter and back to the seat, she measured the width of the doorway with her arms, then tried to do the same from the length of Joanna&#39;s butt to her udder at its widest point.  However, her arms could not stretch far enough for her daughter.  &quot;Oh my, if only you weren&#39;t such a porker.  Oh well!  Get in the back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How?  The door is-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Back your fat ass into the car, and sit yourself sideways across the seats!&quot;  Her mother calmed herself a bit, then pulled the passenger-side front seat forward to maximize space for her daughter.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry about seat belts, you&#39;re too big to go through the windshield.&quot;<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take long for Joanna to realize how much harder it was to move her udder around without her legs to distribute some of the weight.  She placed her posterior into the car, then strained her arms in futility to pull herself backwards.  She couldn&#39;t use one of her legs as it was already pinned between the seat and her udder, but she managed to angle her other leg in enough to get barely enough push to heave herself entirely in after a few minutes of hard work.  <br />
<br />
Her mother closed the passenger door, then got into the driver&#39;s seat.  She looked into the rearview mirror.  &quot;Oh no!  Joanna, you&#39;re too in the way.  Can you try shuffling a bit to the left?&quot;  Joanna started to push herself, but was interrupted.  &quot;No, your other left.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joanna was beginning to sweat from all effort it took, but her butt was against the door.  &quot;I can&#39;t go any further back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That won&#39;t do.  Get out and try the other way around.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Gloria got out of the car, then opened the door behind Joanna.  &quot;Get yourself out, turn around, and go back in the other way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Exasperated from both the conversation and her physical effort, she couldn&#39;t stop herself.  &quot;No, that won&#39;t do anything!&quot;  She felt some strange pressure in her head as she grew disoriented, causing her to snap back into reality.  She&#39;d argued with her mother!  That meant, she&#39;d lost more of her memories, but which ones?  She&#39;d told herself that anything that made her different from a completely normal person should be treated as abnormal, no matter how normal it seemed, but she was struggling with what was abnormal about her.  She had a bra for these breasts, meaning there had to be other people in the world with breasts as big as hers.  Same with her rear.  Sure, she had the biggest at school, but she still found pants for them.  The udder was definitely too big to be normal, but how big was her udder normally?  Wait, she&#39;d never seen anyone with udders before.  Maybe they were just small enough to conceal with a regular shirt?  She&#39;d never asked other people about their udders, right?<br />
<br />
She shook her head.  The udders were probably not supposed to exist.  The more she thought on it, the more certain she was that she should&#39;ve done some research or had some kind of memory about them, apart from just having always had them.  She turned back to look at her mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well?  I&#39;m waiting.  Get out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joanna took a deep breath, and began struggling to pull herself out of the car.  It didn&#39;t take as long as getting in had, but she felt the exercise taking its toll.  After turning around, she set about the arduous task of pulling her body back in.  The time it took her to fully lift herself back into the car was easily three times as long as the first attempt.<br />
<br />
Her mother closed the passenger door once more, got in the driver&#39;s seat, and sighed.  &quot;You&#39;re still in the way.  I guess I&#39;ll just have to drive extra-slow due to not having a full view.  Can&#39;t be too careful when driving blind, after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joanna struggled within the back row of seats.  One cheek and a leg hung over the edge of the seat, and her udder was wedged between the front and back seats as well.  She was seriously wondering how possible it&#39;d be to milk herself at this rate.</p>
