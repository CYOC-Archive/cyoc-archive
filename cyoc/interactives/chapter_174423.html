<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Current list of maids:<br />
<br />
1 Vicky nude vixen busty<br />
2 JESS Cow Maid busty<br />
3 Katty cat nude busty<br />
4 Francine sheep maid cute<br />
5 Dark blue vixen lithe nude (couple) <br />
6 Sky blue vixen lithe nude (couple)<br />
7 buxom tigress maid <br />
8 Aleksandra Smith polar bear maid busty<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You can start by telling me what the Hell that thing behind you is!&quot; Pointed Master behind me. Was this a joke or something? The other maids... my sister in domestic maintenance my mind told... looked equally confused at what he was pointing. But my mind told me that I should humor Master.<br />
<br />
I turned around, and gave out a girlie girl scream and might have peed a little.<br />
<br />
It was... black... with between 7 and 8 tentacles. I don&#39;t mean 7 or 8 tentacles, or 7 and a half tentacles, it had BETWEEN 7 and 8 tentacles, like a whole number existed between 7 and 8 my mind was trying to grasp the existence of! But that was nothing compared to the ring of glowing blue eyes around its body... and a mouth of pearly white fangs like a lamprey. And it was so close behind me that I should have been able to feel its breath on me!<br />
<br />
It ... didn&#39;t seem to be standing... or really floating... it seemed to &#39;stretch out&#39; from the corner of the room where the three straight lines met.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alek! What is it?!&quot; The naked feline maid shouted alarmed and confused. In fact, everyone in the food court was looking at me, not because I was a polar bear woman... but because I&#39;d screamed in terror... Some looked worried about me, some just looked annoyed. NOBODY was looking at, THAT THING... except Master.<br />
<br />
One of its tentacles reached out as I was paralyzed with terror... and... it... maybe sniffed me?<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my,&quot; it said in a voice like an English gentleman. &quot;Terribly sorry. You now belong in this timeline. Therefore, I am no longer legally obligated to eat you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;W-w-what?!&quot; I stammered utterly confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Madam, It&#39;s my job to eat to infections to this timeline... until a few moments ago, you were such an invasion presence. But you&#39;ve now been assimilated into this reality, and I therefore have no business with you. Again, sorry for the inconvenience.&quot; <br />
<br />
I felt so dizzy. Master looked as confused me.<br />
<br />
Then... <br />
<br />
&quot;CTG 174243!&quot; Barked from ... between my breasts?<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, allow me,&quot; THAT THING, reached with one of it tentacles and...pulled out an old walkie talkie... except it could see batteries were missing. <br />
<br />
&quot;CTG 174243! Cosmic Tough Guy 174243!&quot; Shouted a crackled voice that sounded like a drill instructor from Hell... it might have been. &quot;The Catalyst of your target timeline has not given into guilt and despair! Why have you not completed your function?! EXPLAIN YOURSELF WORM!&quot; <br />
<br />
And THAT THING... ate it. <br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
-Meanwhile within the Heart Of Despair-<br />
<br />
&quot;SIR! Contact with CTG 174243 has been completely lost, sir!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I KNEW THAT ALREADY YOU IDIOT! Signal the body to self-destruct!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sir! It won&#39;t respond Sir! No confirmation signal!... It seems CTG 174243 has...been absorbed by the timeline...&quot;<br />
<br />
His Master&#39;s response was unprintable. <br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
&quot;There we go. All nice and clean. Enjoy now being a completely assimilated entity without this universe with all rights and privileges that infers. I must be on my way! Curio!&quot; And THAT THING simply... looked like it was sucked back into the lines of darkness of where the corner of the wall and the ceiling met.<br />
<br />
I was proud of myself for not fainting dead away.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT THE F*CK?&quot; Master swore.<br />
<br />
&quot;MASTER! Children could be listening!&quot; The naked cat maid admonished. Master ignroed her. I realized I hadn&#39;t given Master an answer, how improper!<br />
<br />
&quot;I have no idea what that thing was! I hadn&#39;t seen it before in my life until I turned around Master!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just what game are you playing?&quot; The light and dark blue vixens asked leaning on each others. <br />
<br />
I wanted to scream &#39;didn&#39;t any of you see it?&#39; but they obviously hadn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn&#39;t any of you see that thing!&quot; Master snapped. <br />
<br />
&quot;So WHAT Master?&quot; The tigress exasperated.<br />
<br />
&quot;... Never mind.&quot; Master rubbed his temples, poor thing. &quot;The rest of you, please have lunch without me, I want to talk with... Alek in private.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you both feeling well Master?&quot; The naked cat asked. &quot;If you&#39;re ill and are seeing things, we should just head back home.&quot; She looked at me again in concern, I&#39;d seen that look before, on other people&#39;s faces for their friends. I can&#39;t remember the last time someone looked at me that way.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine! Go and eat. That&#39;s an order.&quot;<br />
<br />
She sighed. Then bow and said calmly. &quot;So you command, so I obey Master.&quot; And turned around, gesturing for the others to follow her.<br />
<br />
I&#39;d have told Master to be nicer to them... except I appreciated exactly how much overwhelming stress he was under, because I was feeling it as well!<br />
<br />
We sat down away from the others.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you really have no idea what that thing was?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NO! Never! I have no idea what that was about!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That radio said &#39;cosmic tough guy&#39;... I was warned that they might have a target on my back when I got this thingie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Being reminded about the ray-gun got my wits back a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;That! What did you do to me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I used this device to change reality so you were always a polar bear maid... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If... if you did... then why... why do I remember-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You noticed my maids... when reality is supposed to be changed so they&#39;re normal. I had the ray-gun set to &#39;aware&#39; so you&#39;d remember.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; Well, that&#39;s one mystery solved. Then I shivered. Paranoia gripping me. &quot;Are you going to force yourself on me?!&quot; I whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?! Hell no! I swear to God no! And the instructions I found with this thing said the ray gun explicably doesn&#39;t make someone have sex with me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What else did you find? And what right do you have Master?&quot; I honestly dizzy and confused just ASKING that last question.<br />
<br />
&quot;The answer to both is this. I showed this to Katty earlier, it appeared blank to her.&quot;<br />
<br />
He pulled out an ID card... it was a &#39;Reality Transformation License&#39; along with a legal notice saying he was &#39;The One True Master of This Reality&#39;s Transformation Ray Gun&#39;. &#39;This license has been certified and bless for including but not exceeding this universe by cosmic forces both micro and macro.&#39;<br />
<br />
Just LOOKING at the license, it was like a law of reality as fundamental as gravity, yes, the ray-gun was his to use as he saw fit... <br />
<br />
&quot;By the way... I tell this to all my maids, unless I tell you too, you ONLY use your money on essentials, okay? And give me your bank account info.&quot;<br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t even hesitate. &quot;Of course Master.&quot; I immediate took a napkin and jotted down the information. &quot;I&#39;ll be sure to gain your permission for any financial pursuits.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... how did you notice something was different about my maids?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... I was... looking at a reflection in a window... and I saw them... and then I wondered why I thought it was weird, but I wondered why I should be wondering... then, I saw you change... &quot; The tiger woman. &quot;My tiger sister maid... And well, you saw the rest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What I saw was that thing behind you... I was trying to zap that thing behind you... You got in my way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am sorry Master... maybe you should consider practicing your marksmanship.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I intend to believe me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, yes, more maids,&quot; instead of feeling scary, it felt, comforting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Speaking of which, we should test that about the windows. If its true, then that&#39;s really gonna screw me over. Well, the instructions said the reality distortion thing was in beta.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;THAT&#39;S encouraging,&quot; I rolled my eyes. &quot;Where did you find it Master?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;On my doorstep, in a plain brown bag.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you just opened it?! It could have been anything!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... And it was a ray-gun that&#39;s gonna be my ticket to dying of old age surrounded by luxury...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know we&#39;ll be happy to provide it,&quot; I nodded, and it was truthful, the idea of living in service to anther felt so...noble.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s do a little test now,&quot; he said, he got up and walked, I wordlessly followed three steps behind him.<br />
<br />
He tapped a woman by herself looking at some dresses wore by headless mannequins on the other side of some glass, the angle and lighting be just right to see us approaching... she never once looked at me in surprise or confusion even as I got close behind her for her to tell I was not wearing some Halloween costume.<br />
<br />
Finally after waiting for her to react at all my presence Master tapped her on the shuolder. &quot;Excuse me madam, do you see anything odd about my maid?&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman looked me up and down and said, &quot;No, she looks fine. What do you think is wrong with her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Never mind. Would you mind helping us with a little science experiment? All you need to do is keep looking at us in the reflection of the glass and say if you see anything out of the ordinary.&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman shrugged, looking bored, but keeping a hand on her purse. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine.&quot; <br />
<br />
She looked at us in the glass. Master turned and took out the toy ray gun. Her eyes did widen a little at THAT, but I could tell she was also thinking &#39;just a toy&#39; from how she didn&#39;t scream or run for it.<br />
<br />
Master aimed as a large woman came out of the very ice cream shop I&#39;d intended to go for a job interview. <br />
<br />
Master fired... in a flash of light, the large woman&#39;s clothes vanished, and she shrank down, but her mass didn&#39;t change as much as you think, her body was hidden under a mass of curly pink fur done up in puffs around her wrists, ankles, her chest... and at the end of a short tail. Her ears behind long and flopped even as her head was covered in fur... Her face pushed into a muzzle with a black nose, her teeth all becoming sharp. Her feet became paws, while her hands were similarly padded with an opposable thumb. She was short, but still round and with breasts to match.<br />
<br />
The short poodle woman bowed. &quot;How many I serve you Master?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go to the food court and wait with the others for me and Alec.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I obey,&quot; she smiled and scampered off.<br />
<br />
9 Poodle Busty Short Nude<br />
<br />
The woman in the mirror hadn&#39;t reacted at all.<br />
<br />
Master asked her. &quot;So did anything seem off about my poodle maid?&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked annoyed now and said. &quot;No, there was nothing odd about her either.&quot;<br />
<br />
Master zapped her as well.<br />
<br />
Her clothes vanished, and she was immediately covered in charcoal black fur... she form didn&#39;t change as much as the others. But her feet I saw become black leathery hands that also reflected what her original hands had now become. A long fur covered tail snaked out of her rear that curled a little around her. Her eyes became black marbles, and fur covered most of her head except for her nose and mouth also became dark gray and leathery... She&#39;d become a human shape and size spider-monkey.<br />
<br />
10 Spider Monkey Nude Lilith <br />
<br />
<br />
She gasped and looked at herself in surprise and looked herself up and down, and grabbed her tail. &quot;Amazing! She turned around looking herself in the mirror.&quot; She looked at Master. &quot;Did you do this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. I did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I never thought it was possible to become an anthro! I am but your humble servant from this day forth! Master!&quot; She bowed, her tail curled behind her.<br />
<br />
Master asked again. &quot;Was there anything wrong with my poodle maid? And has she always been a poodle maid?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not that I saw! And she was one when she went into and then came out of the shop at least!&quot;<br />
<br />
Master seemed to adjust something on the ray gun and fired again. The spider-monkey maid blinked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Have you ever been human?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, my baby pictures suggest I was born one Master!&quot; She laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go wait at the food court with the other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I obey Master,&quot; she said without missing a beat.<br />
<br />
He could change people after the first change! That... uh, was good to know.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that proves it, for now at least. The reflection thing was a red herring.&quot; His ray gun beeped. <br />
<br />
A hologram with text appeared.<br />
<br />
“Congratulations on successfully creating ten (10) total anthro maids! Your Transformation Ray Gun has been upgraded to version 1.3. This upgrade adds the “target’s favorite” option to the species selection menu! Want to help someone feel closer to their favorite animal, but don’t want to ask a lot of weird questions? Then choose this handy option! By reading the target’s conscious and unconscious desires, this setting can help make your maids the happiest they can be.”<br />
<br />
“An additional toggle, has also been added to let a target’s unconscious desires influence the Busty/Adorable and Nude/Maid toggles. This may be activated or deactivated independently from the “target’s favorite” species selection.”<br />
<br />
“The next upgrade will be activate at twenty (20) total anthro maids created. Have a nice day!”<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that&#39;ll keep things surprising, and keep me from having to think up new forms to keep things interesting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d say so Master,&quot; I added. <br />
<br />
There was a beeping... my cell phone... in a skirt pocket... Master looked at me.<br />
<br />
Not knowing what to do, I answered it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Alec,&quot; said a harsh feminine voice. My skin crawled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Eliza.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So did you get your stupid dream job of being one of Mr. Jones&#39; maids? Or did you fail another job interview? Maybe you should just move to Alaska already.<br />
<br />
I&#39;m proud of myself for not crushing the phone. I wish I could say whatever had happened had twisted my sister somehow... but no... she&#39;d always been a Shrew. <br />
<br />
I grinned, showing my sharp teeth even if she couldn&#39;t see them. &quot;As a matter of fact, MASTER has indeed hired me! I start work immediately! I&#39;ll be moving into his mansion! So I don&#39;t need to hear your put downs again big sister!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;ll fire you before the day is out! And you&#39;ll come crawling back to me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think so! Pzt!&quot; I hung up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... I don&#39;t have a mansion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... Oh crude... Can I crash there tonight anyway Master? I should be cleaning up your place now anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have two already on it, but I guess three will help... it kinda needs it.&quot;<br />
<br />
I asked without thinking and, I am forced to admit, I don&#39;t regret it in the slightest. &quot;Can you please zap my sister Master? She&#39;s unbearable!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Works for me.&quot; He shrugged. &quot;But I&#39;ve had enough weirdness for one day. We can deal with your dysfunctional family later... I can relate.&quot; <br />
<br />
Wait... my family... my friends... did I think about... well, ANYONE I knew before being blasted by Master? ... Did I... did I really exist before coming to this mall? The well-spoken squid thing suggested I hadn&#39;t... that I&#39;d been placed into existence just to guilt trip Master committing suicide or something... And I couldn&#39;t resist the feeling of disgust and revolution at the idea of used for such a horrid thing. <br />
<br />
... Had me having a family simply been, retconned in? Like me being a polar bear woman?<br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
Ash thought about it... he&#39;d gotten his answers, he should just turn off her memories of the old reality and be done with it... And it sounded like she&#39;d been an assassin or something...<br />
<br />
But... it felt good... to have someone to talk to about this whole business. When was the last time he&#39;d ever had anyone he could just... talk to?<br />
<br />
Ash&#39;s jaw dropped when he and his maids got to his home... or where his home had been... the space belonging to both him and his neighbors now existed as one property, with a single larger house at the center, and clearly had been that way for years...<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you said you said you didn&#39;t have a big house,&quot; Alec whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t, before. Okay... maybe I won&#39;t need to BUY a larger house after all,&quot; he said to himself.</p>
