<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen sat there looking at the leaf tip under her crotch and pondering how she ended up in the situation. Everytime she tried to stand up she felt extreme pain in her ass and throughout her abdomen, and began to tear up because what ever was in her was not coming out. There was no way to even to attempt to the plant because she could barely lift her ass off the ground. As more time passed she felt as if something was rooting inside her body but didn&#39;t illicit any pain, just a stance tingling sensation.<br />
<br />
 In the distance she heard some whistling and doors opening and closing. Jen began to panic because she was naked in a public place and if someone caught her there was no doubt she would get arrested. The whistling got louder and she could hear foot steps approaching. Her attention as drawn to the door as she peered through some foliage to see it swing open. In a panic she pulled her knees up and wrapped her arms around her legs hugging them tightly to hide herself as best she could. That&#39;s when the whistling stopped and looked right at her. &quot;Please help me I don&#39;t know what happened but I&#39;m stuck and can&#39;t  stand up!&quot; She cried. &quot;Oh look at you. You poor thing must be parched with the irrigation being out and all. Here you go.&quot; The gardener said in a sympathetic voice talking to no one and acting as if no one were around. Jen was puzzled, clearly she could see and hear her so why isn&#39;t she responding to me. Before she complete her thought the gardener raised the watering can and began to pour water over Jen&#39;s legs. The splash of cold water against her legs made her shiver and jump from the cold. As the water trickled down her legs and into the soil a new sensation hit her. She felt the cold water touching her in the soil, even though it had long since left her legs. Then with a sudden surprise she felt as if she was drinking and swallowing the liquid that was in the soil. She could feel it go up her ass and into her body. &quot;Feel better? Hopefully we will have the irrigation working before long.&quot; Gardener said distracting Jen from the watering as she watched her turn and walk away. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; Jen thought then it struck her &quot;she acted as though I were a PLANT! The curse IS REAL?! This can&#39;t be happening!&quot; Again she struggled to get up, felt pain in her abdomen still but didn&#39;t feel a thing in her ass. She still couldn&#39;t move from her position so she just sat there and began to weep. Eventually the lights went out and she fell fast asleep.<br />
<br />
Waking up she felt refreshed as she looked at her surroundings. &quot;What can I do to fix this?&quot; She thought as her memories came rushing back. Jen heard the doors open and close. She looked around and saw a different gardener that yesterday. Jen called out to her, but the gardener kept on walking paying no attention to her at all. As the day progressed she experienced the same thing with every person that walked by and came to the conclusion that she can&#39;t be heard by others because she part plant. Later that day she deduced that the irrigation system was not repaired as she was watered manually again. She felt the water splash against her legs and into the soil as she began drinking the water. Before long the lights went out and another day had passed.<br />
<br />
The next couple of days were a blur to her as she watched the various staff and visitors come and go. However even though they didn&#39;t see her as anything but a plant Jen felt otherwise as she notice changes gradually taking place. She felt her arms get stiffer each day as she lost feeling in her legs and began having an urge to climb. She couldn&#39;t see much around her that she could climb but for some reason she had to look.<br />
<br />
Days continued to pass and she could do nothing but watch and feel more changes happen. Her arms grew stiffer she couldn&#39;t help but hold them up above her head and even started to clasp her hands from time to time. She could still freely move her head to relax and move her torso to lay down if she wanted. Jen also lost complete feeling in her legs and ass however her vagina seemed to get more sensitive and plump slightly. Everyday she tried to communicate with the people that passed by but no one would notice. Despite all the changes she didn&#39;t give up on thinking how she could undo what has been happening to her.<br />
<br />
Then one particular day, she heard some of the staff mention that some lattice work needed to be installed behind her sooner rather than later. This thrilled her because she would finally be able to climb something since the desire had been building for weeks. Throughout the day a small crew was working quick as they installed the lattice, rerouted the irrigation system, and minor exhibit touch ups. The lattice work was completed and a gardener came by at closing time. &quot;Oh I bet you will love this. You will be able to climb as high or wide as you want because this is all yours.&quot; Said the gardener as Jen felt her completely stiff arms together then bound them to the lattice work. Feeling the structure Jen couldn&#39;t feel anything but excitement and pleasure as she was eager to get off the ground.<br />
<br />
Over the next week Jens fingers stretched and spouted into vines as they climbed up the lattice work. She watched as she her body gradually raised off the ground. At first there was a strong tugging sensation in her lower body as the plug was still rooted. It eventually came loose as the roots died and fell off where they were connected. She was now hanging free and loved the feeling of swaying from side to side as her heavy limp legs just hung on her body and rubbed against her very swollen labia what had grown the the size of a basketball. Something in her mind knew it wasn&#39;t long before she would be ready to blossom herself and she was eager to see how she looked despite fighting to hang on to the possibility to reverse the change.</p>
