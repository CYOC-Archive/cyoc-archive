<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jessica Smith was making breakfast in the kitchen when she felt a slight dizziness come over her, she felt like something was watching her intensely, a shiver went through her as she found herself remembering a certain person. The memory was vague in her head, an argument with a customer about her account, she had to be removed by security, she remembered something about calling her a big titted bimbo, and then as suddenly as those thoughts came back, they disappeared, as if they never happened. Jessica stood there in the kitchen, trying to remember what she was just thinking about and shrugged, if it was important she&#39;d remember it later.<br />
<br />
“And now, the woman you&#39;ve all been waiting for, the titillating Tanya Tiger!” The announcer shouted as the woman walked out on stage with a confident strut, her breasts bouncing with every step of her heels, clad only in a lacy bra and panties she strutted up to the pole, blowing kisses to the audience. She began her show, wrapping herself around the pole and spinning, licking it seductively, she slid down, spreading her legs and bending them, and began to twerk for the crowd. Dollar bills were thrown at the stage as the tan goddess gripped the pole, and pulled her body upside down, legs in the air and spun again. She continued her routine and after finishing she went down into the crowd.<br />
<br />
She found a balding man, dressed in a suit, thinking “This guy&#39;s probably loaded, I can get a haul tonight!” As she mounted him, lowering her self onto his crotch she was ripped from this reality. Tanya woke up with a start, cold sweat drenched her. She looked down at herself and breathed a sigh of relief, she was her normal teenage boy self. “What a nightmare.” She sighed. “I have to stop eating pizza before bed.” <br />
<br />
“Tanya! You&#39;d better be up young man!” <br />
<br />
“I&#39;m up mom! I&#39;m getting ready now!” Tanya yelled down the stairs of her family house.<br />
<br />
Kyle gasped, looking in the mirror as his eyes went wide, standing there before him was the naked body of a goddess, thin, with and hourglass figure and obviously enhanced breasts, he shuddered. <br />
<br />
“What kind of place does Jen&#39;s mom work at?” She gasped in her breathy voice. It was just then that the curse kicked in, and Kyle found himself unable to resist touching his new body. “No, you stoooohhh.” His new hand had reached down and started to play with his new pussy, he fell back on the bed cooing, his other hand reached up and messaged one of his tits, the movements of his fingers along his new womanhood giving him a new sensation. He&#39;d never felt anything like it, quietly moaning, he felt an alien heat and sensation fill his new body, his eyes crossed, he moaned and squealed to himself as the body finished the dare&#39;s command, bringing him to a shuddering orgasm. <br />
<br />
Kyle lay there, panting, starting at the ceiling as he passed out for a while, it was fortunate that his mom was home, she knocked on his door a little bit later. <br />
<br />
“Kyle, you better get moving young lady, you&#39;re going to be late.” <br />
<br />
“Young lady.” Kyle muttered in a sweet voice that wasn&#39;t his own, his eyes shot open and he looked down and whimpered. “Oh no. The curse is real.” <br />
<br />
Kyle sat up, the weight of the implants he now possessed making itself apparent. <br />
<br />
“Shit. How am I going to deal with this?” He muttered. <br />
<br />
“Kyle!”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m up mom, I&#39;m moving.”<br />
<br />
“You better be! Your breakfast is getting cold.”<br />
<br />
Kyle got up, his new center of gravity messing with him, he looked in the mirror again, his slim curvy body obviously built for sex, he turned, his pale teen head looking awkward on the slender neck of the tan body of this woman he now was, plump lips now adorned his face, a pair that looked to be made just for kissing. <br />
<br />
“Why this?&#39; He moaned, “And what do I wear?”<br />
<br />
Kyle walked over to the closet and opened it. “Oh no.” Kyle saw that where he kept the clothes he would wear to school was only occupied by several colors of lacy bras and panties, each pair a different color. “I can&#39;t go to school...” His hand reached in against his will and pulled out the blue pair. “You&#39;ve got to be kidding me.” His body slipped on the panties and did the bra, shaking his tits and making an exaggerated bounce. “I guess we have to make sure they don&#39;t get loose?” He then was forced to crouch down and grab a pair of shoes, he was hoping in vein for the body to grab the tennis shoes, but it instead grabbed the pair of open toed platform stilettos with the six inch heels. “Really, we&#39;re going to wear those? To school?” He slipped them on, lifting his heels and making his body posture to show his ass and tits off more. “Was she... a stripper?”<br />
<br />
He was given control again, and somehow walked over to try and change his clothes, but his body was forced to turn away. “I can&#39;t go to school like this!” His body took control again, walked over and grabbed his backpack, then opened his bedroom door. “Wait.” She walked him out to the kitchen and sat down, grabbing a fork and giving him control again. Kyle quietly blushed as he went ahead and ate his breakfast, it was obvious he was doomed, his mother turned around and smiled. <br />
<br />
“Looking lovely as always honey. I don&#39;t know why you worry, your a handsome young man.” Kyle pretended to accept these words, but ate flustered by what she said. She didn&#39;t notice anything at all? How? With tits like these? “I do like that shirt too, I didn&#39;t know you liked Nirvana!” Okay she definitely didn&#39;t notice at all, would anyone see it? Or was he just going to strut around in sexy underwear? <br />
<br />
Kyle finished his breakfast and went out the door, feeling exposed and embarrassed by his predicament he decided to try and fix this when he saw Jen next. He walked to the bus stop, his heels clicking on the pavement, feeling his new center of balance and his strutting stride, he waited for the bus and got on it, taller than before he felt the roof tickle his hair. “Must be the heels.” He thought and sat down in his usual spot, the bare flesh of his nearly naked body sticking to the bus seat as he sat there. The bus stopped at it&#39;s next stop and Jarred got on and sat down next to him.</p>
