<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">David shot a quick look over his shoulder. No one had noticed him leaving. David had to find a place to hide. Suddenly, a thought came to him. He could hide out along the overgrown areas of the beach. There were plenty of hiding places and he was sure to be safe for a little while at the least from Rob if he were to come looking for him.<br />
<br />
After a short run to the beach, David had tucked himself away in one of the bushes. The beach was a long stretch of sand with a smallish outcrop of trees, bushes and grass separating it from a nearby, mostly unused road. The beach up towards the end where David was hiding was generally empty due to the water being unsafe to swim in because of the rough waters. The calmer end was a lot more populated and even had its own Life Guard area for safety.<br />
<br />
David waited for about half an hour, occasionally glancing out from his little &quot;hidey-hole&quot; to survey the area. After nothing happened for an hour or so, David began to subconsciously rub himself through his shorts watching some of the beach-goers (mostly males) going by. The sun began to set after a full day of sitting around and David's legs were beginning to get sore, so he decided he probably should go for a short walk to loosen up his joints. After sitting still for so long, his clothes felt uncomfortable to even be in. His underwear was riding up his ass a little as well and making things beyond bearable.<br />
<br />
The sky darknened into night fast, the full moon rising peacefully up into the star less sky. David was walking along the water's edge, staring at the moon light cast across the dim ocean. David suddenly stopped. Something felt...wrong. He gazed down at himself. He was fully bathed in moon light, so his whole body was clear to the naked eye. His shorts appeared to be riding up his legs. His t-shirt had become skin tight and his chest was pushing out from between the shirt and the waist of his shorts. David felt his chest muscles contract, causing pain to ring throughout his body. He was about to scream out in pain when he heard voices echoing from the bushes from where he had been hiding. Panicking, David dashed to the bush closest to him. He sat in silent pain as his clothes became tighter against his still growing body. His biceps had forced apart the sleeves of his t-shirt; his shorts were growing tighter under the pressure of both the leg muscles and his stiffening penis and although he couldn't tell in the shadows, his skin was gradually tanning bronzed, despite the hour. Amidst the pain, David did not want to be found yet.<br />
<br />
From his new position hidden amongst the leaves of a thick bush, David spied a small group of teenagers running down the beach, some carrying bottles of beer whilst the others tore off their shirts and ran into the dark waters for a midnight swim. David longed to be near them...to be with them...to touch their chests...David shook his head at the last thought. Where had THAT come from? After waiting patiently for several minutes, David forgot his transformation and became immersed with the teenagers party. But, as soon as he had forgotten it completely, he heard a large rip that brought the reality back to him. David's chest had torn right down the middle of his shirt, leaving the tattered remains still on his back and shoulders. His shorts now couldn't be shifted up or down; they were tearing apart at the seams. Wincing, David squeezed his leg muscles together and then let go, causing his shorts to tear off in one almighty rip. To David's surprise, his white briefs had not torn; they were slightly tighter, but definately not intolerable. They were comfortable in the way they hugged his penis softly. He rubbed his underpants gently, feeling some precum against his finger tips as they danced excitedly across his crotch. The fabric had changed to a light pink colour and was steadily redening.<br />
&quot;Oh man...not me too...&quot; David moaned, realising it was too late for him. He stopped abruptly at the sound of his voice. He sounded like his dad; deep voiced and manly. What little hair he had below his arm pit had faded away into nothingness; upon a quick inspection of his penis, his pubic hair had all disappeared, but his penis was quite a bit bigger now as compensation. He let go of the waist of his briefs/Speedos and gasped as the material changed from a white/pink cotton to a red spandex instantaneously. David leaned his head up to the moon light in quiet joy, his shirt remains slipping over his shoulders onto the sandy floor of the beach; embracing his homosexual thoughts and dreams. All he wore now was his tight, red speedo. David had lost his fight and joined the ranks of the Speedo Fags.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the teenagers' party had gone on, not noticing the muscly figure of David hidden amongst the bushed, silently watching them.</p>
