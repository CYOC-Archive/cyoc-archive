<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once Saul pressed the button, he felt his clothes getting tighter on him, his shirt ripped and his pants too. It wasn’t Tim who was growing, it was him.<br />
<br />
Sauls clothes slowly started falling off. First his shirt, then his pants. The chair he was sitting on broke from his weight. He was now 10 ft tall and growing bigger.<br />
<br />
Then, his underwear started to rip, and Tim fell into his dickhole. He managed to grab on to the sides but he was slipping.<br />
<br />
Saul had an idea to get tim out. He started jacking off, he thought he could help tim out with his cum. But the moment he got harder, his growth sped up. His head hit the ceiling and he started getting cramped in Tims small office. He was so cramped he couldn’t jack off.<br />
<br />
Luckily for Tim, Sauls made it so that the gaps in his skin were larger and he was able to grab on and sit down. Tim was pretty far down, and it only kept getting higher and higher. <br />
<br />
Saul broke through the office and was now visible to everyone on the streets. They all ran away from him as he kept growing. Saul wanted to help Tim but decided against it as now he might drown in the cum instead. Saul semi jacked off until he was hard again and his growth sped up again. This would allow him to help Tim faster. <br />
<br />
But, even though not fully, cum rose up to Tims level, he was safe though. The space in the flesh got bigger and Tim could have even lived there if he had all the necessities. <br />
<br />
Saul was now as tall as the skyscrapers. He actually enjoyed being big. It aroused him so he was growing at a steady but fast speed. Soon he was taller than the Empire State Building. The people on the roof looked up at the giant man in awe.<br />
<br />
Saul decided to have some fun, he went to some buildings and stepped on them. This only made him harder, speeding up his growth and making his dick bigger. If it grew more it could reach his face and he could talk to Tim.<br />
<br />
Saul was still growing so he decided to find away to figure out when he’d stop. He picked up a random civilian, a woman, and brought her o his dick. She looked to be a few centimeters tall compared to him, so he still had a little more growth. The woman was scared as she was dangling above the gaping hole that was the giants dickhole.<br />
<br />
He finally stopped growing. The Empire State Building only reached his ankles. Saul felt so powerful but he could have his fun later. He went to the rubble of his old workplace and told the woman to grab the chest. She quickly did so, and Saul brought her to his face and explained.<br />
<br />
“Ok so I’m sending you to give this to my friend Tim, he should be 1 millimeter compared to you. He’ll know the rest.” Saul explained.<br />
<br />
The lady nodded as she had no other choice. She had no idea where she was going.<br />
<br />
Saul dropped the woman down his shaft, she screamed all the way down. She managed to also land on the sides on a large gap of flesh. She called out to Tim but she remembered he can’t call out to her. So she grabbed her phone and turned on her flashlight. She looked diagonally down and saw an extremely tiny dot. She climbed down to it’s level.<br />
<br />
It was an extremely tiny person. He was so tiny she could lose him in her hair forever. Good thing she has good vision. She gave him the chest after opening it. Tim was glad Saul remembered, now he could join him. <br />
He pressed the first button twice and started to grow very fast.<br />
<br />
So fast that he was already double the lady’s height. He quickly started outgrowing the gap and had to hang on from the sides. But soon he was stuck in the shaft and was pushing outward. The lad jumped on to his leg.<br />
<br />
Saul took this as his signal and started jacking off. He climaxed and cum poured all over the city. It looked as if it had snowed. Tim and the woman had flown out and destroyed a house. The woman immediately ran away leaving the box. Tim grabbed it and soon reach Sauls ankles, then knees, then dick, stomach, chest and finally faced to face.<br />
<br />
“Took you long enough” Saul said.<br />
<br />
“Sorry to keep you waiting”.<br />
<br />
Saul then pushed Tim to the ground and then lying on him. This destroyed multiple buildings. <br />
<br />
“So how did you like it in my dick?” Saul seductively asked<br />
<br />
“I loved it, it was so warm, I was hard the entire time.” He replied seductively. “Now, it’s its turn to be inside me.”<br />
<br />
Saul then slid his dick in Tims ass and started thrusting. Tim moaned from the pleasure. Saul came in him and pulled out. Tim was so horny still. He grabbed an entire skyscraper and shoved it downstairs his dickhole. The pleasure was amazing. Saul got hard watching and decided to help. <br />
<br />
He got more buildings and shoved them in Tims dick. Tims body couldn’t handle so much pleasure and he started growing again. He grew only a little, a foot when compared to Saul, he was now 7 ft tall. They both saw this and continued. Saul shoved more in him. He got bigger. This cycle continued until Saul was atleast half his height. <br />
<br />
Tim came and all the buildings came out too.<br />
<br />
“My turn” Saul said as he started shoving them in his dick. He grew to Tims height and more.<br />
<br />
“Mmmm your so big, but I want you bigger” Tim said as he started sucking Sauls dick. Saul continued to grow. Destroying all the buildings around him. Tim was now the size of his dick. Saul lied down, the buildings were like grass to him.<br />
<br />
“I’m gigantic, we don’t need the chest anymore. We can become gods on our own. And there’s no way I’m shrinking back.” Saul said.<br />
<br />
“Me neither, I want to stay huge with you. Now, it’s my turn. Tim said</p>
