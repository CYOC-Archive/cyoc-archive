<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Jeff, you need to stop eating so much ass,&quot; his mother said disdainfully as Jeff ate a mouthful of black bean chili.  &quot;You&#39;re going to get a disease.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff protested. &quot;But it&#39;s for a good cause,&quot; he said.  &quot;They&#39;re going to do better now in their careers because I gave them all rimjobs.  Any way I can help, I want to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s mother glared at him across the dinner table.  &quot;You don&#39;t have to do that, though,&quot; she replied. &quot;And as far as I can tell, you don&#39;t even check to see what any of them want to do with their careers.  I think you&#39;re just doing this with girls you find attractive.&quot;<br />
<br />
That much was true, but Jeff knew why his mom was mad, namely that he refused to lick her asshole to help her out with her career.  On the one hand, Jeff couldn&#39;t blame her, but on the other hand, he was her son! The very idea made him want to throw up.  &quot;I&#39;m doing the best I can,&quot; he said, and the family moved on to new subjects.<br />
<br />
Later that night, Jeff was lying on his bed, fucking around on his phone for a few minutes before going to sleep, when he heard a clinking sound near his window.  When he went over to check it out, he saw that someone was throwing rocks at it to get his attention. He opened the window to see a woman in her mid-40s.  She was not that attractive, and though Jeff could only see her from the front, she was clearly too pudgy to have a nice ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Jeff said.  &quot;We&#39;re all done for the day.  You can come back tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please,&quot; the woman said.  &quot;I&#39;m desperate.  I&#39;m a single mom with three kids.  My new job won&#39;t even pay the rent, much less cover any other expenses.&quot;  She started crying.  &quot;I need your help.  Please.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff felt a pit in his stomach. This is what his mom had been talking about.  He could help these people.  &quot;All right, come on in,&quot; he said, and he shut the window.<br />
<br />
The two of them talked for a few minutes after they arrived in his room.  Her name was Kathy Maresco and she lived a few towns over, where she was a lawyer or accountant or something, Jeff wasn&#39;t really paying attention.  She wasn&#39;t ugly per se, but she was a little dumpy and middle age was starting to catch up with her.  Well, let&#39;s get this over with, Jeff thought, though he knew it would be rude to admit how unattracted he was.  &quot;Let&#39;s eat your ass and hopefully we can improve your job prospects,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t that bad.  Kathy had a huge ass, but more cheek was pretty fun.  This single middle-aged woman had not done anything in a long time to keep her bush trimmed, so there was a lot of hair all around, very natural.  It wasn&#39;t Jeff&#39;s preference but he didn&#39;t mind the more natural aroma.  He set to work and, like most women, Kathy enjoyed the experience, and overall seemed very grateful that Jeff had taken the time to help her out.  <br />
<br />
Jeff stood up as she started getting dressed, and suddenly started feeling kind of woozy.  By the time Kathy seemed ready to go, Jeff was stumbling around.  Suddenly he fell down and passed out.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
He awoke what felt like much later, in a dark room.  He felt weak, and it took a while to remember what had happened before he passed out. Was he in the hospital?  Did he have a medical issue?  He wanted to get up but didn&#39;t have the strength.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the door opened, and with it came blinding light.  After his eyes adjusted, Jeff realized it was Kathy walking in.  He looked around and saw that he was in a bedroom that he had never seen before.  <br />
<br />
She sat down at the foot of the bed. &quot;You&#39;ll feel better soon,&quot; she said, putting her hand on his shin.  &quot;Which is good, because I&#39;m going to need you to get to work soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Jeff managed to get out.<br />
<br />
Kathy smiled.  &quot;I just need to help myself,&quot; she said.  &quot;There are no kids, I&#39;m not in private equity.  I just realized that my career was going nowhere with the physique I&#39;ve got, so I needed all those bonus points I&#39;d get from you licking my ass.  And since each time you eat my ass I get a bonus, well, I just had to figure out how to get you to eat my ass out as much as possible.  And here you are.  I am really sorry to do this, but we&#39;re talking about my future here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff was shocked and appalled, but he also realized that maybe he had trusted people too much.  There&#39;s always going to be someone who screws things up for everyone.<br />
<br />
Kathy stood up and began removing her pants and underwear.  &quot;So no time like the present,&quot; she said, walking towards the head of the bed.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry: this time I can just sit on your face.&quot;<br />
<br />
And she did. As he ate her ass, trying hard to keep breathing, Jeff wondered how much of this he would be in for.</p>
