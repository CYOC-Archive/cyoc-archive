<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer was too busy washing herself to notice the coat fall and the dice roll. She hardly noticed as new bones began to form under the skin on either side of her torso or the two new sensitive moles below her modest bust. Or the fact her bust was starting to push outwards again. As her hands grazed her nipples, she became aware of how much further they felt from her chest. She brushed them again, eliciting an electrifying feeling, and again felt them further away. She curiously opened her eyes and glanced down.<br />
Her jaw dropped when she saw her modest chest was again growing bigger. She had tried a bra earlier from her mom&#39;s drawer and had determined them to be DD-cups, but now she was seeing them increase in size again. Lost in the sight of her swelling breasts, she failed to notice two new limbs taking form about half a foot below her arms, while the two moles had reshaped into familiar nubs on rising hills of flesh.<br />
&quot;What the hell? Am I growing again? I didn&#39;t even roll the-&quot; She stopped talking, already thinking of the answer to her question. In a fit of panic, she threw open the glass door of the shower stall and looked about. She spotted the coat, now on the ground, and two feet from it was the D20. It read 18. &quot;Oh shit. Damn it, that shouldn&#39;t have counted. I mean, I did have it and it did roll, but that was when I didn&#39;t have it in my hand!&quot; <br />
It was then she turned to look in the mirror to see her newest features. And she let out a blood-curdling scream.<br />
On her chest sat two breasts, which were possibly in the H-cup range. But below them, like a duplicate of above, were two more breasts, equal in size to the first. On either side of these new developments were arms. They were near copies of the originals above, save for a beauty mark on Jen&#39;s right upper arm.<br />
&quot;AGH! What the fuck! Are those more tits? And are these arms? What the fuck!&quot; She panicked and accidentally flailed all four arms about, knocking over products and cases from the sink counter and stumbling about. &quot;I-I can&#39;t live like this! I&#39;m a freak... I can&#39;t...&quot; Tears began to well up in her eyes, raising a hand to wipe them away. She realized she had raised a lower arm to do so while her upper arms&#39; and other lower arm&#39;s hands held onto her breasts.<br />
She looked again at the mirror. She took in her form from across the bathroom. The mirror still had steam on it, but she could see her four breasts, their nipples pronounced and perked up. The two new arms, which were just as long and slender as their siblings above. And then the massive cocks. &#39;Wait. What?&#39; Her mind suddenly registered what she had just said. She looked to her crotch and gasped when she did indeed count them. There were two monstrous dicks sitting on her crotch, one next to the other. Equal in length and girth, they gently bumped each other, enough to send pleasure up them to Jen&#39;s brain. She felt below with a lower arm and gasped when she felt four testicles rather than two.<br />
&quot;Okay, calm down, Jen. You-you now have four arms, four tits, four balls and two cocks. And you shouldn&#39;t, but just...&quot; she attempted to calm herself, &quot;...just cool out. *Phew* Okay, I am good now. I think.&quot; Suddenly, she felt something else below her testicles as she moved her hand. &quot;Oh, fuck off. Not that, too...&quot; Sure enough, she felt two slits down there, meaning she also had two pussies. &quot;Alright, that&#39;s it. I gotta find Kyle and fucking reverse this. This is absurd and very... Oh... God, not again.&quot; Her blood had decided it was time to head south. Unfortunately, the blood went into two erections instead of one. It didn&#39;t take long for the heads of both to reach her chin, sitting between her twin busts. &quot;Okay, first, I got to deal with these. At least I can give myself a giant boobjob.&quot;<br />
Jen went at it for about ten minutes, and by the time she was done, the shower stall had been drenched in her fluids. Having four separate orgasms was mind-melting but not as bad as she would have thought. It just meant a bigger mess for her to clean up. She knew she would have to clean it all up but felt like saving it for the morning. As she made her way out, she picked up the die from the counter, trying to remember all of what Kyle had said. &quot;&#39;Should you exceed three rolls in a day, you may have a free attempt at a reset roll.&#39; I wonder, do I have to say it first, or just...?&quot; She tossed it around in her hand, thinking about the word &#39;reset&#39; before announcing, &quot;This is my reset roll.&quot; Nothing theatrical happened and no noises played, so she just tossed it, hoping for the best. It tossed and tumbled, spinning on one corner for a long while, before falling onto a seven.<br />
&quot;SHIT!&quot; Jen turned and cringed. &quot;Of course, it&#39;s a low number. Damn, thought I could at least reverse one of these things. Great, guess I&#39;m going to school tomorrow with two erections and more tits than a fucking cow.&quot; She considered her new body and how much of a chore getting dressed would be the next day. For now, she opted to just get some sleep and wake up in a better mood. Still bare naked, she hopped into her bed, feeling her four nipples press into the soft sheets. She groaned at the sensation, elated to at least have something of a chest now despite how freakish it was. She draped her cocks over her torso, wrapped her lower arms over them to hold them still, and slowly drifted off to sleep.</p>
