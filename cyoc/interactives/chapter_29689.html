<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>After Reverting back into human form and dressing as bear men would, Rob and David quickly jump in the car, heading toward where they were filming a portion of the movie. Thankfully, a portion of it had been filming near their house at a local park. Superman was to fight Lex Luthor, who had been seen hiding out at the park, but is unaware that Lex had a little bit of Kryptonite ground into a powder, mixed with his own blood and was injected into his body while he was plotting against superman. Lex hated losing, even though he knew that it was something bound to happen sometime or another.</br>
<br>As they pulled up, David and Rob sat there quiet and patiently waiting. They could feel stirring within their pants once more, their members wanting to come out and play. Sadly, they had to deny the fun, but only for a short while. Time seemed to pass by slowly for the two, having to readjust themselves every other minute, or so it seemed, just to remain comfortable.</br>
<br>“You know something David… whoever made clothes sure as hell wasn‘t thinking right. I know we have to wear them as humans so not to show everyone what they may or may not want to see, but these things are down right uncomfortable!”</br>
<br>Chuckling, David had a hard time speaking. “Yeah dad! I know, I just want to be naked and sucking your cock, right here and let all the humans watch!”</br>
<br>Rob growls, turned on by his son‘s words, wanting to take his mouth and force his cock down the hungry orifice, but he suppressed the want, knowing it would be even better with a third bear.</br>
<br>The two hear some yelling from all the crew members, something about meeting up later after lunch. That was David‘s cue to go and recruit them some new meat. As David got out of the car, he almost burst into a full-out run, wanting to get to him before he had the chance to get into his car. As David caught up to him, the actor was getting into his Ruby Red 330I Convertible and just as he was about to close the door, David grabbed a hold of it, keeping him from closing it. The man looked up at David in a bit of shock. He tried to hide the look of grimace under a fake smile, but David could see right through it. Although, the longer he was around this man, the less it would matter, so David was more than willing to wait him out. </br>
<br>“Hey there partner, you shooting a movie over there or something?”</br>
<br>“Yes I am? What is it to you?”</br>
<br>“There is no need for you to be rude about it, I was just curious, that‘s all! Really though, I thought I saw you on television earlier today and wanted to be sure it was you, ya know?”</br>
<br>“Ok… are you a fan of mine or something?”</br>
<br>“No sir, not really as I don‘t know what other movies you have been in. Heck… I didn‘t even catch your name when they showed you on television.”</br>
<br>“I see… well my name is Rich. I don‘t feel safe telling you any more than that, especially since we just met one another and you can’t really trust anyone anymore in this day and age.” </br>
<br>Throughout the conversation, David noticed Rich‘s facial expression had changed very slightly. At first he was disgusted being in David‘s presence, but now… it had seemed that he lightened up some. A bit upset though, David wanted to ask questions, even though it was against his better judgment.</br>
<br>David growled a bit, pulling his bearness out slightly, just enough to get his point across as well as to tell by his scent what he was really thinking but not saying. “You got something against me?”</br>
<br>The roughness in David‘s voice shocked Rich a bit. “Uh…. No… no sir… I don‘t!”</br>
<br>“Well that is a good thing now, ain‘t it? I thought you had something against me and I was ready to defend myself if I had to.”</br>
<br>For some reason, David‘s presence had made him a bit horny as his pole began to push against the fabric. Rich was not gay in the least, in fact he hated gay people. Rich thought they were a disease among the earth that needed to be wiped out. He even disliked it so much that he believed that being around them was enough to be infected by their contagion. Rich didn‘t know if he was gay or not, as all of the gay people he knew were very feminine, even the hairy fat ones, which he knew to be called bears. This guy, on the other hand, exuded masculinity and Rich didn‘t even think he needed to be worried.</br>
<br>“Sorry man… you just startled me is all! What‘s your name?”</br>
<br>“That is alright man, I am sure you have people coming up to you all the time and you have to be on your guard just incase. By the way, my name is David.”</br>
<br>Thankfully, from his nose, David could tell a couple things about the man without losing eye contact with Rich. The first thing was the fact that Rich had fear on him and David knew he was nothing but a homophobe. Also, David could smell arousal on him, slight as it was, but it was definitely there. David wanted to look down badly, the smell driving him crazy all the while it stirred his over active cock.</br>
<br>“So where are you headed to in this awesome ride?”</br>
<br>“Yeah, she is a beauty huh? I am headed to a restaurant somewhat far from here for lunch. You want to come with… that way you can check out how she rides and handles.”</br>
<br>“Yeah, that would be awesome, as long as you don‘t mind!”</br>
<br>“Well I am offering, so there is no big deal!”</br>
<br>David shrugged his shoulders, walked to the passenger side of the car and got in. As he sat down, the convertible top was still up, incasing any scents Rich might have been producing, and David could smell that Rich had become a bit more aroused since sitting in the car, next to him. Rich pulled off and David covertly signaled Rob that all was fine and for Rob to head home. David could see that there was a look of disappointment on his face, but it couldn‘t be helped for now.</br>
<br>As the two drove along the deserted street leading to the restaurant he intended on visiting, they came upon a straight away. Since the road was seldom traveled, entering a town that few have heard of, Rich stopped and placed the car in neutral. Rich looked over to David, winked and revved the engine several times, shifted the car into drive and held onto both pedals, making them spin while remaining stationary. </br>
<br>“Now you are going to see what this baby can do!”</br>
<br>David noticed that when he spoke, his eyes quickly focused on his package, with or without Rich knowing he did that.. Releasing the brakes, the car took off violently, speeding down the road, quickly reaching top speed of 156 miles an hour. David was somewhat impressed, noting they had reached the town quickly.</br>
<br>“So that was cool… are we there or do we further to go?”</br>
<br>“We are here and the restaurant is just great old fashioned cooking. It isn‘t expensive in the least and it is probably someplace you would never think a person like me would come to eat.”</br>
<br>“Well… I try not to stereotype people and I think it is pretty cool that you come to this town for some good old fashioned home-style cooking. I think I might want to come here if it is as good as you say, but what is the town called?”</br>
<br>“That is very humble of you and it is quite commendable. This town is called Ursanville. It‘s a funny name, I know, but the folk here are very nice… and they all look like you do. I haven‘t seen any women here before, but they may still cling to old world values.”</br>
<br>David licked his lips, only hoping that they were all exactly like him!</br>
<br>“So Rich… how long have you been coming here?”</br>
<br>“It has been a while, but I would have to say once a day for five years. It really is the town and the food, because it would seem that I can‘t get enough of either. It is quiet out here, there is no gossip or paparazzi which is one of the things I love about this place. The food has been exceptional, even through it’s simplicity. Ever since I found this place, I have wanted to share it with others, yet no one would get in the car with me. I guess it is because I am a real jerk to a lot of people, but I just cant seem to let myself to get close to people. I guess it’s just paranoia that someone will turn me into the paparazzi.” </br>
<br>“Yeah, I guess I can see how your life could produce that sort of issue, but hey… don‘t worry about it. Whatever happens will happen as no one can control every aspect of their lives.”</br>
<br>David and Rich looked at each other, smiling and David placed his left hand on Rich‘s right thigh. Normally, he would have jumped and attacked anyone, especially a guy who did that. However, he didn‘t feel like that, it felt ok and easing. Knowing that his pheromones were working perfectly, David had yet to try for another step and that would come while they were eating..</br>
<br>The two climbed out of the car, walking toward the front door of the restaurant as Rich armed the vehicles security system, even though there was little or no need to. As the pair walked up to the door, David could only smile and chuckle to himself at the name of the diner. David thought to himself<I>Ursan-diner… I wonder if Rich has any clue about the place he has been eating at for so long. The guy must not know anything about genus classifications, but no matter. He will be a new man after today and this trip to his favorite town.</i></br>
<br>As the two walked in, Rich holding the door for David, Rich was met by the familiar charm of both the restaurant and it‘s staff. David could tell that this was his kind of place already. The two were greeted by a large, muscular and hairy guy, with a full dark brown beard and short spiky brown hair at the top of his head. His K-9‘s were a bit sharper than most and he had a wonderful smile. David knew that he wasn‘t an ordinary bear man as he could smell his increased excitement when he looked at David.</br>
<br>When the man spoke, his voice sent chills down David‘s spine. It was deep and filled with lust. There was a gentleman‘s touch about him, increasing his appeal to David. “Howdy! How are ya‘ll doin‘ today? Name‘s Spike and I‘ll be helping‘ ya‘ll out today with your visit.”</br>
<br>Spike walked them over to a booth, sitting David and Rich across from each other. Spike looked directly at David and smiled. “I haven‘t seen you round‘ here… is this your first time to our fine town.”</br>
<br>“Yes sir, it is… nice place ya‘ll have around here.”</br>
<br>“Why thank you sir. Since you haven‘t been here before, we sit as many people together so we can all get acquainted with one another. Really it is how a town like ours can survive, so I hope you don‘t mind a couple of our staff sitting with you. That is all we got since there aren‘t any other customers here in the restaurant.”</br>
<br>“Sure that is fine… heck, I don’t mind at all! In fact, I think that idea is awesome. Ya‘ll are pretty friendly round‘ here“</br>
<br>Spike nodded his head, then motioned for others to come over to where they were seated. Two other bears walked over to the table that were equally impressive looking. Both of them looked like Spike in appearance, but the one who took his notepad was shaved bald, while the other who stood beside him had a military hair cut known as a high and tight. Spike introduced the two; the bald man was Terry and the man with the high and tight was Brad. Rich and David stood up and shook hands with everyone, then sat down again. This time though, David and Rich sat next to one another, while Brad and Spike sat together across from the pair. Terry took their orders quickly, then returning with the food a few moments later. Even though Spike and Brad had poised their sitting together to spawn conversation, they remained silent while eating.</br>
<br>After they finished, something seemed a bit different about Rich this time, something none of the staff ever seen out of him. While David and Rich walked out of the door, Rich had grasped David‘s hand without even realizing what he had done. As soon as they were out of the restaurant, David looked down, scrunching his face, wondering what Rich was doing. As soon as he realized that he was holding David‘s hand, he felt slightly disgusted, breaking the hold almost immediately.</br>
<br>“Dude, what is wrong Rich?”</br>
<br>“I can‘t believe I was holding your hand! I am not gay or anything and I stay completely clear of gay people. They are a disease and I don‘t want to be like any of them.”</br>
<br>“Well, you have done a very poor job of staying clear of people like me.”</br>
<br>“What do you mean, people like you? You aren‘t gay, there is no way that you could even be remotely gay!”</br>
<br>“I am sorry my new friend, but that is where you are wrong. I bet you didn‘t know this, but all the guys in there and probably the rest of the people that live in this town are gay. I know you think gay has a stereotype associated with it, but even guys who look like me can be gay. Now are you going to leave me here to figure a way out to get home, or are you going to be kind enough to give me a ride back to civilization?”</br>
<br>“Well, that is pretty shocking I must admit and I felt completely comfortable around everyone, especially you for some reason. I will give you a ride back, it will give us some time to get to know one another for a friendship, just as long as you don‘t play any gay stuff on me.</br>
<br>David smiled, looking at his estranged companion. “What kind of gay stuff? Do you mean something like this…?”</br>
<br>David grabbed Rich‘s arm, pulling him in closer and planted a bear kiss right on Rich‘s lips. Rich pulled away forcefully, spat in disgust while David just stood there and smiled. Suddenly, without even expecting to, Rich lunged forward and reciprocated David‘s kiss, but then he pulled away, and spat. At this point, Rich was confused with all the feelings he was having at that moment.</br>
<br>“Well, I think you like the thought of being gay. That forceful kiss was erotic! What do you say we just stay here and see if they have a room we could occupy for the night?</br>
<br>“Yeah, sure that sounds fine and all… I guess we will have time to talk about things. I have always been afraid of gay men and I don‘t know why. I have been curious as to what it is like for two men to have sex with each other.”</br>
<br>Rich and David walk back inside and find Spike, who was standing behind the restaurant bar. Spike looked up at the two smiling, knowing something was up.</br>
<br>“What‘s up you two?”</br>
<br>David and Rich pause for a moment and then…</br></p>
