<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alexis awoke the next morning as the sun was rising, awakened by the morning call of a rooster on a nearby farm. She lifted up her torso and stretched, yawning loudly. She leaned back, sinking her hands into her absolutely humongous ass behind her, both to prop herself up and to feel just how soft and sensitive her new hindquarters were. She looked at her phone while she absentmindedly rubbed at her gargantuan udder, seeing a litany of Facebook updates from the day before and that it was currently only 5.34 am. She felt her stomach rumble slightly, remembering that she hadn’t eaten at all after lunch yesterday, because of her changes. She wasn’t really sure what to eat; she craved eggs, but at the same time lettuce, sausage, and… grass and leaves? “I could eat anything right now!” she said, groggy but excited. She texted Ellie, seeing that she was online:<br />
<br />
A: gm whats for breakfast?<br />
E: im cooking eggs rn u want some?<br />
A: yes!!!<br />
E: ok ill bring u some brb<br />
<br />
Several minutes later, Ellie emerged from the backdoor of her house, still looking slightly shocked at Alexis’ new body. “Hell, she’s as tall as my house sitting down!” she thought to herself, her friend sitting perched atop a 20 foot tall ass spreading a little more than a fair distance away from her torso. Alexis looked over and waved. “How… how am I gonna… get up to her?” she thought, slightly panicked. And it looked like Alexis had the same thought, given she couldn’t just reach down and grab the plate from Ellie, not with her ass spreading out 20 feet from her body. Just then, she had an idea. She saw Alexis put one finger up, and then reach for her phone. Ellie’s cell buzzed in her pocket:<br />
<br />
A: i think u need to climb me??<br />
E: im afraid so. y didnt i take that rock climbing class again?<br />
A: haha <br />
<br />
Ellie put her phone back in her pocket and carried the large plastic box of scrambled eggs (with some sausage, bacon, and peppers mixed in) over to Alexis. She could tell Alexis was excited even before she lost sight of her head, for her ass was large enough to block it. She sat the box onto Alexis’ ass and hoped on, causing it to shake like a waterbed underneath her. She heard a slight “whoahhh” coming from the general direction of Alexis’ head, but she still couldn’t see it. Ellie crawled along her friend’s gigantic rear, feeling it squish beneath her. Soon she saw Alexis’ head again, the look of excitement on her face very evident. After about a minute, she finally reached her friends torso. She pushed over the box of eggs, placing it in front of Alexis’ torso. It sunk into her udder slightly. <br />
<br />
“Oh, thank you thank you thank you!” Alexis excitedly squealed, hugging her best friend as well as she could.<br />
“It’s nothing…” Ellie responded, positioning herself across from Alexis’ torso, sitting on her sensitive udder. The two sat there for about an hour, until Alexis finished the eggs, at which point Ellie slowly crawled back down Alexis&#39; mountainous rear to go clean the plastic box. Alexis watched her go back inside, browsing the internet on her phone as she felt her tail lazily swish behind her. She looked back at it, smiling, seeing for the first time just how long it was when it exited her tail bone. She flopped it back over to her torso; at its base, her tail was about twice as thick as a two liter bottle of soda, and it extended straight out all the way to her knees. It was covered in long hair at the end, like a mix between a cow’s and a horse’s tail, and the hair was same shade of blue as her long head hair was dyed, but also showed the same dark brown roots as the hair on her head. “Huh, strange,” she thought while petting it, when it suddenly whipped back to where it was. “Guess I don’t have that much control over it, do I?” Her thoughts were interrupted by another rumbling. <br />
<br />
“Uh oh… stilllll hungry…” She got out her phone<br />
<br />
A: heyyyy uh, still hungry???<br />
E: seriously dude? i cooked u fckin like a whole carton of eggs!<br />
A: yeahhh sorry. im just gonna wonder around for a bit ok?<br />
E: ok be safe. dont fall!! ;))<br />
A: c ya<br />
<br />
Alexis then realized she was in quite the predicament, realizing how poorly built her body was for the task of getting up.<br />
<br />
“Alriiight, what can I do to get up… uh…”<br />
<br />
She couldn’t tuck her legs under her from her current position: her udder was in the way and she couldn’t bend her legs the right way even if she wanted to. She decided to inch her way closer to Ellie’s house, to use her deck for support. She flopped violently over onto her side, causing her entire body to jiggle and almost pulling her all the way over, a position in which she’d surely crush herself. However, she managed to catch hold of the side of Ellie’s roof, and pull herself up by firmly planting her hooves in the ground. Eventually, after quite a bit of shaking, she was up!<br />
<br />
“Ahh, now to explore...” Alexis noted, turning herself towards the outstretching forest-surrounded plains that was Ellie’s farm. As she thundered slowly along, she found a particularly tasty looking tree, and proceeded to shove handfuls of leaves into her mouth until her stomach was sticking out. “Ohh… ohh man… those tasted SO GOOD!” she said, startling herself with her newly found taste for shrubbery. She wandered for a little bit longer realizing that she also hadn’t had any water after she left her water bottle by the stream.<br />
<br />
“How am I supposed to drink like this…” she thought. “I can’t so much just bend down like a giraffe and drink… oh, I know!” She pulled out her phone, texting Ellie again:<br />
<br />
A: v thirsty u got any water or coke or anything??<br />
E: yea sure one sec<br />
E: ok got some water where r u<br />
A: omw thx<br />
<br />
Alexis slowly made the trek back to Ellie’s house, arriving from the other side of the field almost 15 minutes later. She noticed Ellie had gotten out a ladder, and was standing at the top waiting for her with a one liter water bottle. She leaned down, just enough for Ellie to be able to give her the water, repeating “thank you so much” over and over again. She took the water and went back on her exploratory mission refreshed.<br />
<br />
Alexis waddled along for several more hours, partially to get away from it, partially to explore, and partially to get used to her new, highly sensitive body. She continued to eat mostly leaves, but basically anything she could find: she was ravenously hungry. However, she also felt something build up behind her. “Oh… oh no…” she thought, barely having the time to think about anything before an absolute torrent of shit exploded from her rear. She could even feel some of it fall onto her distended udder. “Oh… oh no gROSS GROSS GROSS GROSS!!!” she screamed, feeling her ass continue to explode for almost a minute. She turned around to see the most monumental pile of shit she had ever seen, only to vomit in disgust. <br />
<br />
“Bleugh…” she said, gagging, as she chugged the water Ellie gave her. Then she realized… she needed someone to clean up… her face went white. She knew she couldn’t hope to clean her udder, she couldn&#39;t even see it! She had… to have Ellie… “oh… god I’m so sorry…” she said, grabbing her phone<br />
<br />
A: SORRY EMERGENCY<br />
E: what is it???<br />
A: cleanup on aisle ass!! help im serious!!<br />
E: oh GOD no<br />
<br />
Soon enough, however, Ellie saw Alexis’ large hindquarters approach. Once she got to the house, she turned around. Ellie was assaulted with the view of her udder streaked by shit, as it bulged too far back to be free from the freefall of her ass. “Please help…” Alexis moaned, in clear embarrassment.<br />
<br />
Ellie rushed to the garage, grabbing her hose. She hooked the nozzle up, turned the water on, and rushed back to point it at her friend’s udder. Quickly the water shot out, soaking Alexis’ udder and causing her to yelp and almost jump, shaking everything, as she wasn’t expecting pressured, cold water on the back of her sensitive udder. As quick as it started, however, her udder was clean, and she turned around to talk with Ellie a little. <br />
<br />
“Sorry about that...” Alexis said, redder in the face than a bloody tomato.<br />
“Oh, no problem,” Ellie nervously laughed.<br />
“Oh, yeah, hey, while you’re down here,” Ellie added, “do you mind if I try to milk you? Your udder looks swollen.”<br />
“Oh yes, please! It definitely feels larger than yesterday!” she said, following up in her mind with “if that’s even possible….” “It’s starting to rub on the ground, too,” Alexis added.<br />
<br />
Ellie went back to get her ladder, instructing Alexis to go to where her above ground pool was. Alexis stood by it, carefully making sure she didn’t accidentally step on it, while Ellie went and hoisted the ladder up inside. <br />
<br />
“Alright, three, two, one!” she said, as she wrapped her arms around Alexis’ torso-sized teats and pulled with all her might, gallons of milk squirting out at once. She filled the pool in no time, having drained Alexis’ back two teats successfully, accompanied by the pleasured moans of her mutated friend.<br />
<br />
“Alright, Lexi, lemme drain this then we can get the front two, too.”<br />
“C-cool!!” she responded, once again very red.<br />
<br />
After Ellie had hosed the milk out, into an extra refrigerated tank she had from when there were cows on the farm, she instructed Alexis to turn back around to face the pool.<br />
<br />
From there, Alexis looked down while Ellie did her work on her udders, barely able to see her past the edge of her massive udders. After several more minutes of moaning, it was over. Her udders were only slightly lighter than they had been, and hadn’t really decreased in size, but Alexis felt great! She checked her phone, saying that it was already 5.30 pm!<br />
<br />
“Hey, what’s for dinner?” she asked Ellie. “Oh, I don’t know, what do you want?”<br />
“Is there any mac and cheese?” Alexis asked.<br />
“No, but I can go get some.”<br />
“Cool, thank you!”<br />
<br />
After Ellie had gotten back from the store about half an hour later, she cooked up the entire family-sized portion of mac and cheese for Alexis, this time setting a tray on the top of the ladder so she didn’t have to climb Mt. Alexis again just to feed her. This seemed like it would work, until Alexis said that it was hard to swallow like this, she had to either have it higher or sit down. Seeing as there was no way to raise the ladder, the other option had to suffice.<br />
<br />
“Alright, have it your way,” Ellie said as Alexis walked down towards the tree and sat. Well, flopped is more appropriate, as she couldn’t cushion her fall but by her own butt, causing the earth to shake beneath her and her body to jiggle for what seemed like eternity, much to her pleasure as she bounced up and down on her personal water bed.<br />
<br />
Ellie slowly repeated what she had earlier that day with the eggs, still amazed at how warm and soft her friend’s body was. They shared the mac and cheese together, watching funny videos on Alexis’ phone until well into the night, the two falling asleep on Alexis’ massive, soft, warm hindquarters.</p>
