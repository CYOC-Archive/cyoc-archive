<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenn didn´t stop the petting for another two minutes, and Rick still did nothing against it. Not even ask her to stop. Only when she finally stopped and took a step back, he finally spoke up: “Why couldn´t I stop you? I didn´t enjoy this, but still couldn´t stop you.”<br />
Jenn laughed at his confused expression. “No worries, my little pet, I just adjusted your behavior for the petting. Which you had to accept in silence, or, if you wanted, with enjoying yipes. But are you sure you didn´t enjoy being petted? I´m sure you loved it. Or, at least, your body did. You are all excited from how your cock presses up. Ah, I forgot, you can´t see it right now, my bad. Like little Chaddy, you are in a nice little “Cage”, to keep your worm hidden inside your new sheath.”<br />
Rick´s eyes bulged as with the command, not only was his cage visible and notable to him, it also made him realize his cock was straining against it painfully. He was suddenly aware of how horny he was, and realized that for the last month he hadn´t any desire to be with a girl to fuck or to masturbate, leaving his balls churning with his cum. Moaning in between lust and pain, Rick looked at Jenn, only for her to start scratching his ears like you would do for a dog. That made him only moaning louder, his need for release growing.<br />
Smiling, Jenn continued this for another minute, making Rick nearly go mad. After stopping and again taking a step back, she waited for him to do something. It took another minute or two for the moaning teen to be aware enough of his surroundings. He looked up at her, pleadingly. “Please, remove it. It´s too tight and too much to bear for me.”<br />
Laughing, Jenn took in the pathetic display in front of her. Rick looked like a big dog, and a few wet drops around the sheath of the suit showed his need. But you couldn´t see the cage from the outside. “No, it needs to stay. I can´t have my pet impregnate the next bitch he sees, right? Now, I have trained you before today, let´s make sure you act for it. After all, “Training” your dog is the base of a good boy, right? Now sit and beg, Rick.”<br />
Like with the petted command before, a cold shiver went through Rick´s body, as if his body was just rewired to something. To his immense shame, the second after the shiver was through, Jenn used two trained words, and he sat back like a dog would and raised his hands in front of him, like a dog begging for a treat. It was embarrassing.<br />
“Good boy, I see your training worked. Next one, lay down and roll over.” Jenn said with a grin, as Rick did as commanded. He couldn´t stop himself from obeying her like a loyal dog would. When Jenn gave him a few belly rubs, he again was sent into a moaning fit, as again it made his cock rise in its cage. It had just stopped aching a bit, dammit. <br />
Another minute or two in a state of a moaning mess, Rick had enough. He would need to get his key from her, and quickly. So, in an attempt to retake his control, he growled out: “Give me that key, right now, or else…”<br />
Jenn laughed at him trying to threaten her. When Rick started to approach her on all fours, she grinned evilly at him. “And I thought you were a bit more intelligent than the animal you are becoming. Well, the little “Puppy” will learn its place, don´t you think, “Rex”?”<br />
Rick shuddered two times with that sentence. He started to feel weak the second she mentioned the word puppy, as it, unbeknownst to him, sapped his strength away from him. It wouldn´t go as far as it had for Chad, but as a puppy, he wouldn´t attack anyone. It instead instilled a desire to play within him. A little thought went to a hope of playing fetch with Jenn soon.<br />
And then the second word affected him, his new name, Rex. Like a switch was pushed, his name, “Rick Peter Jones” was replaced with simply “Rex”, no longer a surname needed. He didn´t even remember being called by either of his old names. If someone would call either Rick or Peter now, he wouldn´t react, as that simply wasn´t his name, never had been. Even while he still was somewhat human mentally, he had ever only been called Rex.<br />
On the inside, however, Rick was still there. It was like he was in a passenger seat of the car that was his body. He had just been pushed out of any control, as Rex took over. Looking around wasn´t possible for him. He could see out of his eyes, but couldn´t move them, or anything form his body, really. What the hell was wrong with him? Why couldn´t he shake her off? It was really confusing to him right now.<br />
Jenn´s grin got wider, seeing the shudders. She had played with him before in the park, like she mentioned before, and after his “training” and hypnotic session, a simple command would return him to normal, without him remembering anything that happened while he was a puppy. It was within the puppy command that, should he return to normal, his memories would end half an hour before the “puppy”-command was given. Only this time, she didn´t plan on him returning any time soon.<br />
Rex looked up a bit more excited and less aggressive and fearful as before. With him being called Rex instead of Rick, his personality changed. He wasn´t any longer a cocky jock like before, who didn´t understand his situation. He wouldn´t react angry or aggressive as long as his mistress wasn´t attacked. Rex was kind, loyal and calm. And, most important, submissive to his mistress, Jenn. And why would he fear his loving mistress?</p>
