<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Guys, the box.” Harry pointed, seeing the engraving shifting. They all leaned in, spare for Betty, who was quite overwhelmed by all of this,<br />
‘New Player Must Select Two Change Cards’<br />
“Shit,” Judy said, “you really are starting at square one.”<br />
“I-is there… like a scoreboard? A board or something, like Jumanji?”<br />
“Not really,” Milo said, “it’s whoever draws the ‘Winner’ card.”<br />
“Oh.” Betty said, “so it’s totally random.”<br />
“Yeah…” Izzy said, “but that still means you could win. And we’ve all promised to use the final wish to benefit everyone, not for selfish gain.”<br />
Everyone agreed with Izzy’s point, no single one of them intending to use the final wish against anyone.<br />
<br />
Betty bit her lip, brushing her orange hair out of her face as she reached forward, grabbing two separate cards from the ‘Change’ pile.<br />
Her heart was pounding. She’d just been miraculously transformed back into an infant, and then progressed back through her ages in mere moments. It felt like anything could happen… anything would happen! She hesitated more and more before rapidly turning over one card. She read it to herself, everyone looking at her in anticipation,<br />
“F-four eyes… am I gonna get four eyes!!” She freaked, close to tears,<br />
“No no!” Izzy said, trying to calm her down, “the names are meant to be ‘clever’, I have a feeling I know what it means.”<br />
“M-my vision,” Betty said, looking around, “it’s getting worse.”<br />
“So she needs glasses now?” Milo asked,<br />
“Is the game seriously not going to give her glasses?” Harry complained, “that seems harsh.”<br />
“I think I know what it’s doing.” Judy said, getting herself out of her position and heading towards the bedroom.<br />
“It’s always not as bad as you think,” Izzy said, “trust me. I got turned into a giant blueberry… it was kinda cool!”<br />
“You should ask Harry about it.” Milo teased,<br />
“Shut up, dude.” Harry snapped back, looking a little embarrassed. He hadn’t really opened up about his kinks with anyone except Izzy. Milo knew because they’d grown up together, and Judy knew… from context. His reply wasn’t so soft either, and Milo noticed it. Something wasn’t okay between them still, especially after the whole Milo cumming all over him fiasco.<br />
“L-like from that one movie?” Betty asked, “Willy’s Chocolate Factory?”<br />
“Close enough.” Izzy chuckled.<br />
<br />
“Got it.” Judy walked back into the room, “from what I understand, these should be the closest pair of glasses in the house.”<br />
“You wear glasses?” Harry asked,<br />
“Rarely.” She admitted, “I wear contacts. And since the whole wish thing my eyes have kinda fixed themselves.”<br />
“Right.” Harry understood.<br />
“Here.” Judy leaned down, passing her specs to the new girl.<br />
Betty couldn’t help but stare directly into Judy’s cleavage as she leaned down. Despite her eyesight being terrible as of her last card, Judy’s giant orbs were mesmerising, and despite being explained that they were fake, they looked pretty real. Although maybe a little too round. She looked at the glasses with her poor vision before slipping them onto her nose. As expected, everything became perfectly clear.<br />
“Wow.” Betty said, blinking a couple times, adjusting, “how did you figure this out?”<br />
“We’ve played a round already. I made a guess, clearly I was right.” Judy shrugged. Milo looked at her, smirking,<br />
“Always were the smart one.”<br />
“And you always were the dumb one.” She quipped back, “at least you’re hot.” She said, sitting herself down.<br />
<br />
“Still got one more card, Betty.” Harry reminded her,<br />
“Oh.” Betty looked surprised, she’d completely forgotten, “right…” she said. She reached over, and idly flipped the card over, reading aloud before taking in what the card said; “genetic genital… wait… what?” She said, confused. Her eyes going wide, “is my… am I…” she turned bright red before looking down,<br />
“What’s the last word?” Izzy asked,<br />
“R-r-r-r….” Betty stuttered as she looked at her shorts in horror. Harry caught a glimpse. What he assumed to be her clit… it was bulging in her shorts. Through her underwear,<br />
“Oh…” Harry said, “I think it was—”<br />
“STOP!” Betty yelled, everyone went silent, looking right at her. She was still blushing. Hard. But her change seemed to have stopped, and she did not look interested in looking at it whatsoever.<br />
<br />
“Let’s just move on.” Judy said. The group averted the gaze, trying to figure out was going next. Judy leaned over to Betty, “you don’t have to talk about it. But just telling you, it’s okay to freak out. Last round… my clit disappeared.”<br />
“L-like… replaced by… y’know…”<br />
“Nope. Just straight up disappeared.” Judy admitted, “it’s not fun. I don’t wanna talk about it. And we’re moving on. We all go through changes we don’t want.”<br />
“Y-yeah… I guess.” Betty said, her head lowering in shame.<br />
“Hey. We’re in this together babe.” Judy smiled. She turned back to the group.<br />
Betty looked at herself. She was in this. No denying it. And it was real. She looked down at her bulge, tempted to touch it, but she didn’t. She just hoped that maybe she’d get lucky and it’s go away on it’s own. Maybe with her next card.<br />
<br />
“Isabella.” Judy said bluntly, “I believe it to be your turn?”<br />
“It would indeed.” Izzy said lightheartedly. She reached over, hesitating before grabbing both an Action Card and a Change card.<br />
She placed them in front of her, looking up to see the rest of the group. She turned over her action card, reading it aloud, “no action applies,” she said, then turned over her change card, “birthing hips.” She said, “whelp, that’s not gonna do much!” She chuckled. Everyone looked at her hips as they widened a little. Her hips were already very wide due to their wish, making the card not too impactful. Though, the slight change was still pretty sexy. At least Harry thought so.<br />
<br />
“Me next!” Harry said. He picked up his card, making brief eye contact with Milo before averting his gaze, their tension still there, even if it wasn’t so obvious.<br />
“No Action Applies, and… oooh!” He said with a look of excitement, “watermelon weights!”<br />
“Men.” Izzy said, looking at Judy, who nodded in agreement. Betty couldn’t help but chuckle a little.<br />
Everyone watched as Harry’s C cup chest began to swell. They weren’t just getting larger, but quite a lot heavier, and he could feel it. They swelled beyond D’s, going into DD’s within just a few moments. Before long, they were E’s, easily the size of ripe cantaloupes. They kept growing, getting rounder, heavier, but not any softer. They remained firm. His dress had managed to stay holding on this long, but here it simply let go, allowing Harry’s breasts to fall out freely. Their shape was immaculate, really giving off that Watermelon feel,<br />
“Those are magnificent! They look so natural,” Judy said,<br />
“They’re… pretty heavy,” Harry said,<br />
“Tell me about it,” Izzy said, placing her hands on her own breasts. They were large, but not quite as large as Harry’s. <br />
They continued swelling for a few more seconds before finally stopping. They were over the size of his head, looking if anything a similar size to Judy’s, but natural.<br />
“Baby,” Izzy started, “I have a few extra bra’s lets find out if they fit,” she said, excusing them both,<br />
“Here?” Harry asked,<br />
“Yeah. Me and Judy had the idea to get some extra support for when we play again. In case something like this ever happened,”<br />
“Don’t have too much fun, you two.” Judy said playfully. Izzy smirked at her, clearly not intending to get some alone time with her boyfriend.<br />
The two walked away, into the hallways and then into the bedroom to find the closet.<br />
<br />
“You next then, babe.” Milo said,<br />
“Yep.” She said smugly, she was feeling rather confident. As she reached over to grab the cards, she looked over at Betty, “how’re you doing?”<br />
“I-I’m… I’m okay. It’s a little weird, y’know. All this.”<br />
“Tell me about it.” Milo said, “actually, tell all of us about it. We’ve all been in your position. A little scared, confused. I mean, despite some really nasty cards, it’s all fun!”<br />
“But the game seems to know things…” Betty said,<br />
“What do you mean?” Judy asked,<br />
“W-well… you said it made you guys come back and play it again. And it made me and Isabella change in the stairwell! It… it seems like it’s alive or something.”<br />
Milo understood what she was saying, “the game is cursed, sure. I think it’s pretty clear. But it doesn’t seem to be possessed in any way. Just like… it has a spell on it or something.”<br />
“Had you ever seen something like this before?”<br />
“Of course!” Milo said, “I feel like everyone has a grandparent with an enchanted item of some kind. Passed down, generation through generation.”<br />
“N-not mine… they hated magic.”<br />
“I’d say that’s fair.” Judy said, “and my grandparents didn’t, either!” Judy said.<br />
“Well anyways,” Milo said, “I’ve seen what a spell-bound object can do, and it usually involves some kind of change to either the mind or body. That’s just the way it is, and this is no different. It’s just that this one seems pretty strong.”<br />
“Obviously.” Judy said. She looked at her action card idly, “Immediate Mastercard?” She said.<br />
“Wait… Mastercard?” Milo said, looking a little confused,<br />
“Oh shit… shit! That’s… it could be anything. I-is it on this card?”<br />
<br />
“GUYS!” Milo called out, Izzy and Harry luckily just on their way back in,<br />
“What?” Harry asked,<br />
“Judy pulled an ‘immediate Mastercard’,”<br />
“What is a Mastercard?” Betty asked,<br />
“It’s like… if you get a number of cards in a theme, you get a big all-around change. Pretty much dominates your other changes.” Izzy explained,<br />
“It’s fine.” Judy said with a smile on her face, “it’s just a card. It’s whatever,” she said nonchalantly, she turned over the card, “The Perfect… Nerd?” She said, looking confused.<br />
<br />
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Milo asked,<br />
“Maybe like a stereotypical nerd?” Betty suggested, everyone looking over at her, she felt a little overwhelmed, “I-I meant like… with braces and glasses and… y’know…”<br />
<br />
Judy could feel herself changing already. At first, it was her chest. Her breasts were getting a lot less round. The silicone was disappearing, replacing with regular fat. Her butt was doing the same. And yet, even though they were shrinking, they weren’t getting much smaller.<br />
Her gorgeous blonde hair started turning back into her usual brunette, and it was getting frizzier. A lot frizzier. It appeared that she was shrinking too, yet she remained just as wide. Her shoulders looked broad, and her hips looked quite thick. Cellulite replaced her perfectly smooth body. Her face began to change, gaining a little bit of a double chin, then developing quite a swarm of freckles all over her face.<br />
She found that her contact lenses were changing. They began to stop working as well, and very quickly found a pair of glasses forming on her face. They were huge, rectangular glasses that made her look insanely dorky. She found them funny, and accidentally snorted.<br />
Her nose had upturned, and her teeth were now full with braces, as well as gaining some buck-teeth,<br />
“Whoah… thith ith weird!” She said giddily, snorting once again.<br />
Her height returned to her usual height, then shrunk a few more inches, eventually finding herself at five foot five. Her midsection, once tight and sexy, now growing a large, flabby belly. Covered in freckles too.<br />
Her feet become bigger, growing out of her high heels.<br />
<br />
Everyone looked at Judy. She really did look like a nerd,<br />
“What do you guys think!” She said giddily, standing up and spinning herself around. Her dress replaced with a long frilly skirt, tights, and a big sweater that barely covered her huge boobs. She didn’t appear to be wearing a bra either, so her nipples poked pretty heavily through her top.<br />
<br />
“Judy, you really do look like a nerd…” Milo said, in awe.<br />
“Thankth!” Judy said with another snort, she leaned down and gave him a big wet kiss on the mouth. Sure, this was his girlfriend, but Milo did not feel too aroused right now.<br />
“You’re so cute right now!” Izzy said, a wide smile on her face,<br />
“Thankth girllll!” Judy said, rushing over to Izzy and hugging her in a dorky way,<br />
“I feel like I’m back in middle school,” Izzy chuckled, whispering to Harry.<br />
<br />
“Guess I’m last then.” Milo said,<br />
“Heck yes, babe!” Judy said, sitting back down, leaning against her boyfriend cutely. He smiled awkwardly and uncomfortably. He looked at Harry, who didn’t look impressed with his expression. Milo felt as if he could hardly catch a break.<br />
He just grabbed his cards to be on with the next round, “action card; Change is Decided By Player.”<br />
“What does that mean?” Betty asked,<br />
“So bathically, Milo gets to pick whatever change he wants! Isn’t that so so cool!”<br />
“I guess!” Betty replies, a smirk on her face. Judy is acting a little over the top, but she has a positive aura around her,<br />
“Uhm…” Milo starts, unsure of what to pick. Sure, he’s love a lot of things, but right now, he wants to be able to appreciate his girlfriend the change she’s received. He just hopes the next card allows him to be picked,<br />
“For my Change Card, I want ‘To Appreciate Judy’s Change in it’s entirety’.”<br />
“You’re so romantic!” Judy said, giggling to herself, snorting a couple times,<br />
“God I hope it lands on me…” he said. He reached for another action card, and quickly turned it over, “Card Applies to Player… thank god. A-and also ‘pick up extra change card’.” He shrugged.<br />
<br />
As Milo reached over, he looked at Judy. Suddenly a smirk appeared on his face. She looked… well she looked like everything! She looked fun! Knowledgeable, and like a real dork. He got excited at the prospect of watching nerdy movies with her, for her to talk over them and explain the plot to him. He felt just as in love with this version of Judy as he did with the normal version. Plus, he actually found her rather attractive with that body. He wasn’t sure why, but he found himself rather aroused.<br />
He pulled a change card, and showed it to Judy with a smirk, “you read it, babe.” He said. She looked excited, bumping her shoulder into his, “it sayssss…” it took her a moment to read it, “Chubby!” She says. She looked equally as exciting, looking right at his belly.<br />
<br />
Milo’s shirt tightened as his belly started bulging a little. From quite a buff looking guy after their wish, his body was slowly getting more and more flabby. His belly began, followed by his moobs, his legs, his arms as well, fat lightly covering his tight biceps. His face grew a little thicker too. As a whole, his body was definitely chubbier. But with such an extreme body already, there wasn’t much to notice.<br />
<br />
“So that’s it then?” Betty asked, “that’s the whole game? Just all of that, over and over.”<br />
“I-I guess…” Harry said. It can be pretty fun,”<br />
“It doesn’t get repetitive or anything?” She asked,<br />
“Not really,” Izzy replied, “I mean you haven’t been through the best stuff… plus we have been playing it without significant others.”<br />
“Oh yeah… right.” Betty said, looking a little shy,<br />
“Shit. Sorry, I didn’t mean to—”<br />
“No! It’s all okay,” Betty said, “just not really over… y’know.”<br />
“We know.” Harry chimed in, “but you’re ahead of him. And now, you can hang out with us!”<br />
“Yeah. I guess.”<br />
<br />
Harry and Izzy looked at each other, really not sure of any way to make Betty feel any better.<br />
<br />
Betty looked to her left, seeing Milo and Judy making out. She did seem happy considering all the tension she felt earlier, but after everything… she did feel a little left out.<br />
Maybe her next card could give her something new!</p>
