<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alice would have gone with the guardians and other pups to the study, however. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alice stay here.&quot; Jensen said, &quot;No one is better with semantics than you, if there was a <br />
glitch in the way Zackery's Transform was done, you're more likely to pick it out than I <br />
am.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As you wish my father.&quot; Alice curtsied and stood besides her mother. <br />
<br />
Kaylee looked at Jensen and touched his forehead.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Jensen asked in annoyance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just seeing if you have a fever master, you just admitted a little girl was better than you at <br />
something, I'm just making sure you're not sick.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jensen pushed her away, &quot;Get off!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Master.&quot; Kaylee bowed lowly, she motioned to sit down then remembered her 'chair' <br />
wasn't in the room. Irritated at her new convience not being available Kaylee merely stood <br />
besides Jesen, &quot;So what do we do while we wait for Hope to retrieve Balaxsandra.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The name of the she wolf Hope will bring back here is Alexandra Alpha Female.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Alice!&quot; Darla scolded Alice for correcting her elder. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh right.&quot; Kaylee said annoyed, &quot;Where's Pearl anyway? She should be the one running <br />
around for us, not my furniture.&quot;<br />
<br />
The twins said nothing about Kaylee's transparent condescending attitude. <br />
<br />
&quot;Pearl is likely with the other she-wolves Alpha Female.&quot; Alice pointed out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alice enough.&quot; Darla whispered.<br />
<br />
Kaylee sighed, &quot;I'm putting a collar on that girl so I can have her handy when I need her.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jensen said nothing. The twins just looked at each other. Alice kept her mouth shut this <br />
time. No one could tell if Kaylee was joking or not. <br />
<br />
++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The place that the light brown revision of Kaylee looked of course first for Alexandra was <br />
of course first the female's den. What she found was incredible. The new wolf titans that <br />
Roger and Lawrence had become were practically covered by she wolves, a rainbow of fur <br />
covering their bodies. Hope in spite of her mission stood back in awe and watched the <br />
spectacle.  At she watched the two now much more mighty males were at first nervous, <br />
then unsure, then confused, then happy, then excited, and finally returning all the touches <br />
the she wolves were giving them.<br />
<br />
Hope had the demented image of the she wolves covering them like a cocoon and splitting <br />
open to reveal two fairy she wolves with wings like butterflies. Hope shook her head of the <br />
absurd fantasy. <br />
<br />
'Why couldn't I have been the charcoal black one instead of Zackery?' Hope had enjoyed <br />
the goth style of dress (but not the glorified belly aching people dared called poetry). But <br />
now clothing wasn't even an issue anymore. Even her hair color and body shape had been <br />
completely remodeled to mark her as part of Alpha Female's clink. <br />
<br />
All her clothes were now ashes, and her personal items sold off on ebay, all she had kept <br />
were a couple pieces of jewelry as keep sakes rather to wear (they didn't look good on her <br />
fur anyway). <br />
<br />
Hope looked closer and saw Ashley and Maxine were apparently engaged in a mock sumo <br />
contest on top of the two males while Margot between the two big boys was enjoying the <br />
feeling of the two of them against her acting as a completely ineffective referee that no <br />
one minded in the least.   The entire match had the two she wolves bumping their heads <br />
into the ceiling more than once. <br />
<br />
Hope looked around for the she wolf she had been sent to find, she spotted who at first <br />
she thought was Alexandra, but when she saw the red ribbon she realized it was Nicole <br />
'What kind of color is gray for wolves who are supposed to be a bunch of anime colors <br />
anyway?' Hope thought, not that she cared much for anime, but she did have an artistic <br />
side that made a prick in her mind over inconsistencies in the pattern like Nicole and <br />
Alexandra.  <br />
<br />
Speaking of whom Hope scanned the she wolves not taking part in the 'game' Nicole <br />
sitting back just watching the show, while Millie cheered on Maxine like a kid sister (Robyn <br />
helping Maxine from falling off Roger), and Magen who looked at her brother but not in a <br />
lewd way like any other female present (Hope herself included, these updated males could <br />
never be mistaken for girls). <br />
<br />
Finally she spotted Alexandra, READING A BOOK, as she had her back against Lawrence. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alexandra!&quot; Hope called.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; The gray furred she wolf looked up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Master wants to speak with you about something now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As Master Commands.&quot; Alexandra said in a proper and calm voice and stepped away from <br />
Lawrence. Which caused an imbalance at once and caused the entire mess of Big Bad <br />
Wolves to come crashing down. Millie and Magen rushed to their friend and sibling as Hope <br />
lead Alexandra back to the estate's office.  <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Sarah figured Alpha Female wouldn't mind them using her Wii as long as they didn't spend <br />
any of her Wii Points or erase any of her save data popped in a copy of the Olympics. As <br />
they completed the hundred meter dash (Ulysses coming up ahead of both Sarah and <br />
Jasmine), the purple boy wolf sighed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I should be a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Both Jasmine and Sarah said causing their characters on screen to trip over <br />
themselves ending up in last place. <br />
<br />
&quot;Males are supposed to be for the pack to mate right? But I'm too young ... or maybe I <br />
should be aged into an adult... then I wouldn't be useless.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Now what did I tell you about there being more to it all than sex kiddo?&quot; Sarah asked <br />
calmly, &quot;Let the others have their walking sperm banks. I don't need anyone until the <br />
Master decides he needs me.&quot; the fact Jensen had pretty much ignored the lesser she <br />
wolves sexually she creating them focusing instead of Kaylee, her former friends and the <br />
twins hadn't been noticed or cared about by any of the she-wolves.  &quot;And there is no <br />
reason for you to have a turn used for the sole purpose of being made like them! <br />
Personally I think turning Lawrence and Roger into muscle hounds was a waste of time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You wouldn't say that if you saw them.&quot; Jasmine teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;The point is, that there's no REASON to use a turn to make you a girl wolf or make you <br />
until an adult male... I like you just the way you are.&quot; Sarah rubbed the back of Ulysses' <br />
ears. &quot;You got that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Madam.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Call me Sarah.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Sarah.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah then dropped her remote and began tickling Ulysses with zeal. &quot;Now I don't want to <br />
hear that talk never ever again you got it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jasmine just stared in utter amazement. <br />
<br />
Ulysses against his own will smiled, then grinned, then giggled and finally burst out <br />
laughing. &quot;I-hehehe-per-per-om-om-isssse!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That's good to hear!&quot; Sarah said tickling him a bit more just for good measure before <br />
hugging him. <br />
<br />
++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh excuse us.&quot; Said Isabelle then seeing it was the gray/silver wolf who had enjoyed <br />
Zackery with them. &quot;Is Zackery in the male's den?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do believe he is.&quot; June said calmly and perfectly in control to the dark brown furred <br />
version of the Alpha female in front of her. &quot;Don't worry, I'm pretty sure Zackery's stamina <br />
is infinite almost, he'll be more than welcoming to you both.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;All right, than you.&quot; Grace said taking 'Belle by the arm in case 'Belle said something she <br />
shouldn't. They were supposed to evaluate Zackery's behavior after all. <br />
<br />
June didn't ask where the new and improved males were, that would have gotten far too <br />
much attention if it was investigated in retrospect, and they DID have two cops as the <br />
pack's betas after all...<br />
<br />
June reasoned, that if Zack disapproved of the idea, and didn't know she was going to do <br />
it, then he wasn't technically connected. June decided she'd observe the two new and <br />
upgraded males in action, -then- she'd decide for herself if their existence made the she-<br />
wolves accepting Zack back into themselves an impossible goal or not.  If they didn't, then <br />
there was no need to proceed further and increase the risk if getting herself, Pearl or <br />
Zackery discovered. If they did, June would act for the good of the pack and introduce <br />
Lawrence to she-wolf hood via Margot. <br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Beatrice just sat across from the passed out Pearl in front of her able to hear Sarah, <br />
Jasmine and Ulysses a short while away. <br />
<br />
Beatrice sipped on a soda via a straw (the muzzle make drinking an entire new mechanic), <br />
'Why would she do it? How could she do it? We aren't supposed to be able to do it.'  If she <br />
wasn't able to do it, then the logical conclusion of course was supposed to be that of <br />
course Pearl hadn't done it. Pearl HAD been saying some pretty demented things before <br />
passing out so it was possible she was just spouting nonsense. <br />
<br />
&quot;But what if she wasn't?&quot; Beatrice thought, but why would Pearl help, nay, risk herself for <br />
Zackery just didn't make sense to her.  If Pearl really had used her turn then Beatrice was <br />
no real danger of just waiting until Pearl woke up and Beatrice could ask her directly about <br />
the whole mess. She didn't want to get Pearl turned into a glass fountain because Pearl's <br />
neurons had fired in the wrong direction after drinking herself stupid.  &quot;Pearl why? Why <br />
Zack?&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;I have returned.&quot; Hope said Alexandra following behind her. <br />
<br />
Kaylee snapped her claws and pointed behind herself. Hope sighed and calmly got into <br />
cheer leader position behind Kaylee as her Alpha Female proceeded to lay her rear on <br />
Hope's backside. This was her purpose and function as Alpha Female dictated. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alexandra.&quot; Jensen said, &quot;We have much to discussion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master.&quot; Alexandra said formally and properly bowing. Alice had to admit she liked <br />
this she-wolf even if she wasn't all that curious a color. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you recall the wording used for when you made Zackery part of the pack?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alexandra didn't even bring up the point that Jensen had been there as well.  &quot;I believe so <br />
yes Master.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And what was it?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot; 'You shall all become members of the Big Bad Wolf Pack, but first you must draw the <br />
straws Pearl holds. If you do not draw straws, you will all become glass statues of naked <br />
Japanese woman and know one will have any memory of your ever existing.  Whoever <br />
draws the shortest straw will become a male big bad wolf who will be impressively built, <br />
but will not surpass the Master in all things. He will have charcoal black/gray fur and <br />
golden eyes and will be eager to please those females that the master is to busy to mate <br />
with or shows no interest in. The rest will become she-wolves whose frames and build will <br />
equal the Alpha female's. One will have fur the color of milk chocolate and another the <br />
color of dark chocolate. The last will fur that resembles that of a normal wolf with browns, <br />
grays, whites, and blacks mixed together. All of you will love and be loyal the Master, <br />
Jensen and will respect Alpha Female Kaylee as your best friend and &quot;click leader&quot;... <br />
whatever she does, you will follow. And all those who knew you will not remember you <br />
unless you directly contact them, and you will not use your turns without meeting the the <br />
Master's approval and instructions regarding to your turn. ' &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have a very good memory.&quot; Hope said. <br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't hold my position at the estate for nothing.&quot; Alexandra said simply. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well Alice?&quot; Jensen asked. &quot;Can you see any errors in that?&quot; <br />
<br />
Alice sat down and thought.</p>
