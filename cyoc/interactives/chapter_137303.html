<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“So the only way for us to be together would be to give up my family, my 20s, my 30s and all of my friends,” Jackie sighed. “And I would have to betray Lisa after we lost our mom, give up my adult life, and find a place to live,” Ann added sadly. The two star crossed lovers looked at each other forlornly, sighing in defeat. <br />
<br />
“This really sucks,” they answered.<br />
<br />
“Perhaps I could be of assistance.”<br />
<br />
Ann and Jackie screamed in surprise as they turned towards the voice in the darkness. “Ugh Merlin,” Jackie sighed in relief. “Geez you scared the hell out of me.”<br />
<br />
The elderly wizard smiled as he straightened out his suit. “My apologies,” he said concritely. “It was not my intention to frighten you. I’ve been paying attention to your....blooming relationship. I had a feeling it would come to this eventually, especially after Thanksgiving.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah we’re at an impass,” Jackie frowned. “We both feel the same way about each other yet theirs nothing we can do. Without magically changing our ages I’m too young and she’s too old.”<br />
<br />
“So I’ve seen,” Merlin answered. “Quite a shame really, a friendship and love that you two have developed in so short a time is quite special.”<br />
<br />
“It is isn’t it,” Ann whispered. “It’s amazing I’ve never thought about a woman like this before until I met Jackie. I wish we could be together but the fates are just lined up against us.”<br />
<br />
As Merlin watched the two women stare sadly at achother a thought crossed his mind. “What if I told you I had a way for you two to be together.”<br />
<br />
“How,” Jackie asked.<br />
<br />
“I’m glad you asked,” Merlin smiled. As the two women gazed at him he waved his hand. Slowly they noticed a shimmering image begin to form. Ann frowned as she saw what appeared. “No Merlin,” she snorted. “We already talked about that option. I am not making a magical clone of myself. Lisa would find out and after everything that’s happened tonight I can’t put her through any more pain.”<br />
<br />
“This,” Merlin answered, gesturing to the image. “Is not a clone. It’s you, more specifically one of infinite yous spread throughout the various timelines.” Jackie and Ann gave the wizard an expression of confusion as he continued. “This image that I am showing you Ann is you,” he said. “That Ann exists in another timeline very similar to this one with one exception. The Ann in that timeline is not in love with Jackie, she’s her best friend.”<br />
<br />
“So why show us,” Ann asked. “What does she have to do with our timeline.”<br />
<br />
Merlin paused as he looked between the two Ann’s. “The reason I am showing you this version of Ann is because her timeline is dying,” he said solemnly. “Due to incidents beyond their control the timeline will so vanish along with everyone in it.”<br />
<br />
Ann and Jackie looked forlornly at the Still image of the other Ann. “That’s awful but I still don’t see how that can help us.” Jackie stated.<br />
<br />
“I shall explain then,” Merlin continued. “You see what is unique about this Ann is she has experienced everything that you have. She went through her first meeting with Jackie, the Thanksgiving with her family, even the unexpected magical interference of her unborn niece at her job. The ONLY difference between this timeline and ours is that she is not in love with Jackie, but you are”<br />
<br />
“Well that’s nice and all but how does that really help us,” Ann asked once more.<br />
<br />
“What I am proposing is this,” Merlin said thoughtfully. “This Jackie will soon be erased. Instead of that happening she can come here and take your place.”<br />
<br />
Ann gaZed at Merlin, unable to comprehend finding a replacement for herself. “But that would mean I wouldn’t be here anymore,” she exclaimed. “How is me not being here any good for me or anyone else?”<br />
<br />
“Oh that is the interesting part,” Merlin smirked. “You see Ann if that Ann exists here you can fulfill your desires and be with Jackie.”<br />
<br />
“But where would I stay,” she yelled. “Your talking about me becoming a teen but that would mean me becoming someone’s daughter, which is something Lisa would never forgive me for. I couldn’t live with this Ann, everyone would know.”<br />
<br />
“Your right,” he smiled. “Which is why you would live with me.”<br />
<br />
Ann and Jackie gaped at the wizard as he now began to pace. “Ann,” he said softly. “In another timeline a version of myself took a woman from her timeline and made her into his daughter. When he did that the woman was reborn. She is now just a girl of 16 body and soul with no connection to her previous family, other than the memories of a lifetime already lived. While it is not easy, she is happy and thriving as a daughter of Merlin. After seeing this I too wanted to have a child for myself.”<br />
<br />
“So,” Ann said slowly. “You would bring this Ann in to replace me while I became your kid. I would get a fresh start and be able to live the life I wish?”<br />
<br />
“Yes,” Merlin nodded. “You would no longer be Ann O’Toole you would become Ann Pendragon. The world would only know you as that, aside from Jackie and myself. Even magic would be unable to discern that you were once you. You would become a completely different person, you would look like you but you wouldn’t be you anymore.”<br />
<br />
“That’s nuts,” Ann whispered. “What would happen to my family, would they still know me? Would I remember them? Would they miss me?”<br />
<br />
A look of concern crossed Merlin’s face as he gazed at Ann. “Well,” he started. “The thing is the Ann that I would bring here would be part of your family now. No one would ever suspect that she was from a dead timeline because she has all of the experience and knowledge you have. You in turn would become a 14 year old girl that everyone would know as Jackie’s friend and eventually girlfriend when you two are ready to reveal it. Everyone would think this is natural because to them Ann O’Toole would have never left, she would still be present in this timeline.”<br />
<br />
“So what would I have to do for this to happen,” Ann asked, squeezing Jackie’s hand.<br />
<br />
“If you agree this Ann will be rescues from her timeline and become you,” he said thoughtfully, pointing at the image. “Once she is here I would cast my spell to make you my daughter. I would have to deage you to a newborn and then grow you back up to 14. Once that is done I would give you an magical item of your own so that you would be able to regain the memories you have now. For you it would be 14 years but for us, perhaps only a minute will pass between the time of year your rebirth and regaining your memories.”<br />
<br />
Ann paused as she considered her options, did she really want to do this? She was talking about becoming a whole other person. Jackie squeezed her hand causing her to gaze at her star crossed lover. “Hey it’s your choice,” she said softly. “I’ll be with you the whole time you dearest so you’ll never have anything to fear. And when you grow back up, I’ll make sure your taken care of. What ever you decide to do though I will love and support you.”<br />
<br />
Ann smiled and sighed happily. She was ready to make her decision.</p>
