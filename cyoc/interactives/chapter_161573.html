<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jellie&#39;s plan was simple, go (to Jamal&#39;s) home, and maybe unfuse... Jellie wanted to stay longer, knowing that she only exist because of the union of Jamal and Ellie, whose lives are equivalent to her has to go. &quot;No!!, I want to live! I want to be me. Jellie denied her bases&#39; freedom for hers.<br />
<br />
Soon, Jellie was reminded why she can&#39;t take their take their life and existence as hers.<br />
<br />
As Jellie crossed the street, a police car passed by and turned the lights on her. It was the offistripper still on her tail. Jellie ran into an ally. The offistripper was forced to chase her again on foot. Jellie hid the gloves in her yoga pants, not wanting the &quot;Offistrippar&quot; thing to happen again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop running girl!! You&#39;re under arrest!!...*pant**pant*, Stop running away!!&quot; the offistripper shouted, but Jellie ignored her yelling. <br />
Jellie kept knocking trashcans and random things to stop the offstripper on her tracks. turning left and right corners to lose her, but the the hoe cop is still on. Jellie was reminded that she&#39;s now the offistripper&#39;s target, because Jamal fused with Ellie. With Jamal&#39;s memory of the sex-torture and Ellie&#39;s female instinct, she was terrified of what were the consequences of her existence. <br />
<br />
Jellie looked back to see that the offistripper was gone. As she crossed another corner, she was slammed against the wall. The offistripper finally caught her. At that moment, Jellie&#39;s fear were knocked away and in it&#39;s place was pure hatred and anger.<br />
<br />
&quot;You really made a mess of me huh! Your not getting away this time!!&quot; as the offistripper was about to handcuff her, Jellie rams and was able to pinned her down. Jellie vented her frustration on the offistripper&#39;s face with punches and claws until the she left her incapacitated.<br />
<br />
Knocked out with bruised face, Jellie left the police on the ally and made her escape.<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Jellie was three blocks away from Jamal&#39;s home. Along the way, she contemplated. With her existence, she&#39;s putting Ellie in danger. her Jamal side felt it was wrong, it was his fault in the first place. Ellie was just a victim and Jamal involved her in this mess was what made her. She felt her resolve was wavering, but she has to do it. she doesn&#39;t want to destroy their lives.<br />
<br />
As Jellie approached the house, she resolved herself that it was for the better.<br />
With Jamal&#39;s know how, Jellie went around the house. Seeing from the window, Jamal&#39;s family was already eating dinner. She proceeded in sneaking pass by the window and took the ladder in the yard and prepared to climb.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile on the dining table...<br />
<br />
&quot;Deena, tell your brother to come down.&quot; her mom commanded Deena as she drank a glass of water.<br />
<br />
&quot;But, Jamal&#39;s sleeping in his room. I already knocked on his door twice!&quot; Deena protested, as she was eating her mushroom soup.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you telling me that you know more than I do young Lady!&quot; mom raised her voice as she thought that Deena was rebelling against her. This made Deena flinched.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-No...&quot; Deena shrunk in her seat as she was scolded again by her mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take the master keys in the drawer next to my bed and wake your brother up. It&#39;s bad to make graces wait on us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Deena took off and climbed the stairs to her mother&#39;s bedroom as she commanded her.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile in the backyard. Jellie climbed the ladder. now on the roof top, she scaled to see if someone could see what her doing. Knowing that it was clear, she walked carefully towards Jamal&#39;s window which he left open for situations like this. Entering through the window Jellie accomplished her mission.<br />
<br />
Now the only thing she needs to do was unfuse. She wore the gloves on, but she was trembling. in this moment, she recalled her short life. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll miss you, me. I hope in the future I can exist again...&quot; she smiled as tears flowed down on her face. She held her chest and pulled it apart, then the schwoop sound was heard...<br />
<br />
In her place appeared her predecessors falling on there butts. Jamal was the first to stand up of the two. Jamal lend his hand to Ellie who gladly took his hand. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about that, Ellie!! I was in a pinch and it was the only thing I can do.&quot; Jamal sincerely apologised to Ellie and was ready to be scolded and slapped by her or something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no please, you don&#39;t have to. I understand that it was an emergency. I mean, I knew you didn&#39;t intended it to happen. Since we shared memories.&quot; Ellie giggled as she made a gesture pointing at her head. <br />
<br />
Jamal was baffled by her reaction. He thought that Ellie will adjust along with this reality, but he was wrong. His face showed his confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;But first, isn&#39;t your butt getting cold?&quot; Ellie tells jokingly as she gestured to Jamal and his hanging partner. Jamal quickly ran towards his drawers and wore a pants.<br />
<br />
*knock* *knock* *knock*, someone was knocking on the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jamal! wake up!! dinners getting cold already. Stop sleeping or mom gonna get ya&#39;!!&quot; behind the door was Jamal&#39;s sister, Deena. As soon as she finished her sentence, Jamal hears the keys jingling as Deena was about to unlock the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not this one... no not this. Which key is it! Why can&#39;t mom label which keys which!?&quot; Deena&#39;s struggle to find the right key granted Jamal and Ellie a small window of time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quick! Ellie, you need to get out of here now!!&quot; Jamal whispered. He can&#39;t let her sister see Ellie. Deena&#39;s known to make convenient lies. If she finds out, he could get in big trouble.</p>
