<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John slept rather peacefully even as the pig he had been leaning against trotted off leaving him lying on his side in the mud. His dreams were pleasant and calm as he found himself exploring the island he and his family were vacationing on.<br />
<br />
In this fantasy world he found his nose drawing him along a dirt path to a field of blooming flowers. With a smile he took deep breaths to sniff lovely scented air. While in reality he snuffled and snorted as his nose pushed up then outwards into the beginnings of a snout.<br />
<br />
Walking through the field a breeze blew by and he marveled at the rustling the plants made as they swayed in response. Back in the mud pit his ears grew larger and pointed until they flopped forwards as they moved up his head.<br />
<br />
Reaching the edge of the field he found a dense screen of bushes and trees that his nose was pulling him into. John tried to push his way into it but found it too thick and some of the branches had thorns that scratched at his clothes and skin. Stepping back he looked at the wall of foliage for a way past it and spotted a small opening in the near the dirt.<br />
<br />
With a smile he crawled into it and found it was a veritable tunnel in the greenery. It was difficult at first as he went on his hands and knees  but soon enough he found it as easy as if he walking on two feet. In the waking world John&#39;s arms and legs twitched as they shortened and thickened while his hands and feet became hooves.<br />
<br />
With a happy grunt John exited the large hedgerow to find himself in a forest. He considered getting up as his nose urged him forward with hints of tantalizing smells but seeing the low hanging branches on the trees he decided to stay low to avoid hitting his head. And it certainly seemed like the way to go as he was setting the quite the pace and even avoiding tripping over the exposed tree roots. John grunted contently as he continued sleeping as his spine lengthened and, his shoulders and hips shifted so that he could no longer stand on two legs.<br />
<br />
With snort John&#39;s nose told he was at one of the promised smells a leafy bush covered in red berries. A gurgle from his stomach was all the prompting he needed as he set about devouring the berries. As he did he did not care as juice ran done his chin and onto his shirt and chest. Or that his shorts and knees were getting covered the rotting berries that carpeted the ground around the bush. In fact as a feeling of fullness washed over him John realized just how restricted and messy they were and took them off. In the real world John&#39;s face pushed out into a proper snout as his body swelled with fat, particularly around his belly that grew into a sizeable gut. And causing his mud and filth drenched clothes to burst apart at the seams as his body expanded and the remains quickly sunk into the mud.<br />
<br />
Then his nose was calling to him again and John continued through the forest. The gurgling sounds of a stream reached his ears and the smell increased so that he was able to identify it as a powerful musk. And passing around a tree as wide as a car he found the owner of the musk, a boar drinking from the stream.<br />
<br />
John knew he should have felt afraid of the beast as boars could be aggressive and dangerous with their tusks but for some reason he only felt excited. Indeed with every breath a warmth filled his veins and need building between his legs. Slowly these feelings brought him closer to the boar and with each step he took forward his eyes found another feature of the boar examine and appreciated. How he was large enough to be compared to a small horse. That he was fat enough that his stomach nearly brushed the ground. How thick his bristles and long his tusks were. Or that his testicles were as big a softballs. Meanwhile under the layer of mud that coated him more sets of nipples were forming down his flabby chest and in his crotch his dick and balls were dwindling in size until with a pop they vanished and a wide thick lipped vagina opened up. <br />
<br />
Then his breath caught as the boar turned towards him and came over. Slowly it sniffed and snorted at him until it made its way behind him. Once there John felt a warm soft tongue lick his privates and gave a sigh of pleasure that sounded more like a low squeal as the need he felt back there became a flood of desire. Several more licks later and John found himself squaring his hips and readying his legs just in time to catch the massive weight of the boar rearing up and landing on to his back.<br />
<br />
The boar grunted above him as John felt something poking about his hindquarters. Burning with lust John gave a small squeal when it touched close to his waiting pussy and another each time it got closer to his dripping nether lips. Then a loud one as it entered her sending tingles of pleasure through her mind.<br />
<br />
Both grunted and moaned as they went at it. Slowly their paces of thrusting theirs hips matched up so soon enough John&#39;s mind was filled with bliss as each movement sent that piggy dick deep inside her. Time was forgotten as she was fucked until she climaxed and her pussy muscles went to work on the boar&#39;s dick making him cum and filling her with his seed. And in the mud John finished her transformation into a pig as a curly tail grew above her butt.<br />
<br />
Yawning John woke from her pleasant dream and got to her hooves.</p>
