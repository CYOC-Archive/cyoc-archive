<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Class dispersed.  Elias was strutting down the hall with two girls on <br />
each arm. Ty grinned.  Then he heard a commotion around the corner. <br />
The side hall was deserted, as it led to the auditorium. There was <br />
Dexter pinned up against the wall by Gunther. His feet dangled 4 <br />
inches off the ground. Ty initially was going to grow Dexter into a <br />
muscle stud like Elias, but he listened to the bully and his victim's <br />
conversation, and decided on a different tack. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, pencil neck, give me my homework.  It had better be A grade <br />
material too,&quot; Gunther ordered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you. I wouldn't do your homework, and I didn't, Gunther,&quot; <br />
Dexter growled.<br />
<br />
Gunther snorted his laugh, and said, &quot;So you want to get pounded? You <br />
f-ing mascochist!&quot; He drew back his fist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gunther, I wish you were little. Then I'd teach you a thing or two,&quot; <br />
Dexter said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, right. The only way a wimp like you could deal with me would be <br />
if I fit in your stupid pocket protector. You could be a head taller <br />
than me and all muscle or I could have a wimp body like Cyrus has, and <br />
I'd still be your master.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pocket protector sized?&quot; murmured Ty. <br />
<br />
And it was so.<br />
<br />
Dexter dropped to his feet.  Gunther disappeared into his collapsing <br />
clothing. Dexter just stared, and gasped, &quot;Did I do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
A terrified tiny Gunther climbed out of his cavernous fabric and <br />
gasped.  He stared up at the skyscraper of a giant looming over him. <br />
That was Dexter?<br />
<br />
He stood up defiantly with his hands on his hips and shouted, &quot;Turn me <br />
back now, wimp!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dexter stooped down, and seemed to think for a moment.  He said, <br />
&quot;Um,...no!&quot; <br />
<br />
His hand shot out and grabbed the five inch tall bully. He stood, and <br />
reached into his pocket.  He always carried rubber bands in one pocket <br />
and paper clips in the other.  He started pulling out rubber bands and <br />
twisting them around his tiny captive.  Soon Gunther was mummified <br />
from his neck to his feet in rubber bands. Gunther was squeaking away <br />
like a rubber dog toy in helpless terror. Finally, Dexter tied a knot <br />
in a small rubber band and used it as a gag to silence Gunther.  Then <br />
he shoved his bound captive into his pocket protector.<br />
<br />
The tardy bell started to ring. Ty froze time. He started to run to <br />
his next class.  As he dashed by few scurrying classmates, he stopped <br />
and laughed.  He had stopped time. He had all the time in the world. <br />
He saw the unmoving vice principal Haskell, transfixed with his finger <br />
in mid-wag as he lectured the popular science teacher against wearing <br />
casual clothing. The scene reminded Ty of Gunther and Dexter. He had <br />
overheard the argument before. Mr. Haskell just liked berating his <br />
underlings. Mr. Cabot had explained that ties were dangerous around <br />
Bunsen burners, and moving machinery which he used in class, but that <br />
seemed to fall on deaf ears. <br />
<br />
He grinned. Mr. Cabot now wore a bow tie and was dressed like a GQ <br />
model. Haskell on the other hand was dressed in too short cut-offs <br />
with his boxers sticking out below the cut denim, and wearing a <br />
stained t-shirt, white socks and sandals. Ty would have liked to watch <br />
this tableau unfold and he would later. He willed a wireless tv camera <br />
into existence to record the confrontation and transmit it to the new <br />
laptop that was now in his locker.  It was great to have this power. <br />
He wasn't sure if he started time that he'd be able to freeze it <br />
again, and he was having to much fun to go straight to class and start <br />
time again. So he headed toward the gym.  There was one sadistic coach <br />
who might do with a little humiliation too, and there were gym bullies <br />
in other classes. This time he thought, he'd make their victims into <br />
muscle studs, but make them into total prepubescent geeks like Dustin. <br />
He grinned to himself and wondered what else he could do.<br />
<br />
He spotted smug Ethan frozen in mid-stride walking toward the office. <br />
The student body president was smart and athletic, but way to full of <br />
himself. Further up the hall, Ty could see Alvin dropping a banana <br />
peel into the trash.  Alvin had some sort of disorder where he needed <br />
to eat small snacks several times a day to keep his blood sugar level. <br />
Ty decided to fix him. Alvin not only was totally healthy, but Ty <br />
buffed him up and increased his height six inches.  He noticed the <br />
nearly non-existent bulge in Alvin's now very tight trousers, and <br />
fixed that too. <br />
<br />
Then he glanced at the banana peel frozen in mid fall into the trash <br />
can.  He snatched it and ran back to Ethan, and placed the banana peel <br />
under Ethan's descending foot. Instantly more wireless cameras mounted <br />
themselves to the ceiling and walls around the imminent pratfall. He <br />
glanced up at Ethan's ten inch cock outlined against his tight black <br />
crisply creased slacks, and his starched Oxford shirt. Then he decided <br />
to embarrass Ethan a bit more. Ethan's clothing vanished. He had <br />
expected to see Ethan in tighty whities or boxers, but Ethan <br />
apparently didn't wear underwear. Ty chuckled. Ethan had a good body, <br />
but that big cock probably contributed to his arrogance. He <br />
contemplated removing it entirely, and see how Ethan coped with being <br />
a dickless wonder. <br />
<br />
Something caught his attention from the corner of his eye. Through an <br />
open door, and out the window Ty saw someone being pushed on the hood <br />
of car. They were frozen in time too. Ty decided to investigate.  He <br />
was halfway out of the building when he remembered Ethan. He made up <br />
his mind and smiled.</p>
