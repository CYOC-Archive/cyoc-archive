<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Returning to Circes proved to be a blessing and a curse for Misery and the others. The mission to blow up the manor was a success, the group learning that they would receive a cash bonus for their actions. Unfortunately, due to the the passenger they picked up, they were now front and center for Liliths anger.<br />
<br />
&quot;You dare show yourself here,&quot; the demon queen bellowed.<br />
<br />
Abolith was unmoved, her eyes narrowed as she glared at Lilith, Circe, Baba Yaga, and Jack. What Bong-cha and the others did not know, aside from Misery, was the old animosity that existed between the elf assassin and the owners of the park. &quot;Wait she tried to kill them,&quot; Bong whispered to Misery. &quot;During the war,&quot; the auburn haired woman replied. &quot;Its been a few years though. Was hoping she would leave before we came in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thats got to be the dumbest thing I&#39;ve ever heard,&quot; Set hissed. &quot;And I thought Jolie was a dumb ass!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot;<br />
<br />
The whispering now quieted as Lilith continued to yell. The elf responsible for so much destruction now stood defiant before her. The demon queen was in an unusual position, during the war the amusement park was a war zone. Numerous followers of Circes were slain, the damage done to the park almost shuttering its doors forever. This paled in comparison to the damage done to Lilith.<br />
<br />
Fukushu, the vengeful kitsune and his elf lover. At the conclusion of the war, Lilith found herself face to face with the nine tail. At the time, she believed herself invincible. She had crushed numerous kitsune over the years, including Fukushu&#39;s sister Yomi, this was no different. Instead, she was defeated, her arm severed, crippling the witch forever. If three wizards from the future had not saved her, her life would have ended that day.  It infuriated the demon that she was forced to rely on mortals to save her. For eons since becoming the first to wield magic, she had relied on her wits and her strength to best those who opposed her. Fukushu changed that narrative,. For the first time in the eons she existed, Lilith had known fear.<br />
<br />
Gazing at the defiant elf before her, Lilith wanted vengeance against one of the parties she held responsible for this new feeling. She would destroy Abolith, banish her soul to the nether realm, and spend an eternity torturing her soul. Then, and only then, would she finally be rid of this nagging feeling of fear.<br />
<br />
The sound of the doors of the throne room being thrown open now drew everyone&#39;s attention. Gazing at the figure in the doorway, Lilith snarled, her eyes turning a solid blood red as bat like wings erupted from her back.<br />
<br />
YOU!!!!<br />
<br />
Lilith Kane now studied the figure carefully. She had never seen a kitsune but had heard what they looked like. Standing at six and a half feet tall, she could see his nine tails swaying lazily behind him, the anthro fox was adorned in black and red, looking like a samauri as his furry hand rested on the hilt of his katana. Glancing back she could see Bong, Set, and Jolies faces pale as the kitsune stepped forward. &quot;Holy shit,&quot; Bong gasped. &quot;Its him!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who,&quot; Lilith asked quietly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fukushu,&quot; Set stammered. &quot;You know the Death Fox, the Angel of Vengeance.&quot; Lilith shrugged, she had no idea about any of this much to Sets annoyance. &quot;Geez don&#39;t you know anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t know about any of this a month and a half ago,&quot; Lilith hissed. &quot;Well let this be your first lesson kid,&quot; Bong whispered. &quot;That guy right there is probably the deadliest warrior in existence. He&#39;s killed pretty much everything for centuries. Vampire old Bloods, kumiho, other kitsune, anything that&#39;s ever stood in his way!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I heard he&#39;s killed more people than the Black Death,&quot; Jolie added, her voice barely more than a whisper. &quot;When I was a kid, their was a game we played to summon the Dark Samauri. If you wanted revenge on someone you had to go into the woods and call his name nine times and leave a picture of the person who wronged you. If you didn&#39;t, Fukushu would come after you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilith simply rolled her eyes at Jolies story, chalking it up to a scary story in the vein of Bloody Mary. Still, gazing at the massive kitsune, there was something inherently intimidating about him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lilith,&quot; Fukushu growled, his voice calm yet menacing. &quot;Why is Abolith here?&quot; Lilith scowled, the demon witches attention now focused on Fukushu as she descended the stairs of her throne. &quot;Nice timing beloved,&quot; Abolith smirked. &quot;I was beginning to grow bored with this demon mewling like a scorned child. I was considering leaving after she threatened to consume my soul.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that so,&quot; Fukushu asked, the kitsunes eyes narrowing as he angrily glared at the demon witch. &quot;Tell me Lilith? Are you so anxious for me to separate more limbs from your body? I thought you would have learned from our last encounter.&quot; Lilith snarled, the demon witch taking an aggressive stance as Baba, Circe, and Jack now stood in front of her, trying to calm the mother of demons but ready for an attack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave,&quot; Jack growled, the young warlocks eyes glowing with anger. Fukushu simply chuckled,sensing Jack&#39;s power amassing within him. &quot;As impressive as you think you may be boy,&quot; he grinned. &quot;You are no threat to me. Do not make the same mistake your mother did or I will do worse to you.&quot; Misery and the others now looked between the group, a feeling of dread washing over them. Fukushu was serious. Even after watching Jack brutally kill a man with no effort they could sense that Fukushu somehow outclassed him.<br />
&quot;Come beloved,&quot; Fukushu said calmly. &quot;I think we have had enough of this...park.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren&#39;t you curious about who attacked your beloved elf Fukushu,&quot; Lilith called, trying to antagonize the kitsune. &quot;Aren&#39;t you just a little curious as to why a kitsune would try to kill her?&quot; At the mention of a kitsune, Fukushu paused. Slowly he now turned his head, narrowing his eyes as he stared at the demon.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see I have you attention kitsune,&quot; Lilith spat, a malicious smirk plastered across her face. &quot;You have no idea about a dark part of your peoples history. About the Civil War that saw the annihilation of the Tyssa clan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is no Tyssa clan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or so you think,&quot; Lilith chuckled. &quot;I know differently as does your father. Ask him and good luck considering what you did to his beloved wife.&quot; Lilith now burst into a maniacal laugh. She could have her revenge by not releasing a piece of kitsune history Fukushu had no knowledge of. Lilith and few others were aware of what occurred and considering Fukushu&#39;s actions against his people during the war, she believed he would forever be denied this knowledge. She may not be able to beat the fearsome kitsune but she could mentally and psychologically torture him.<br />
<br />
Without another word both Fukushu and Abolith departed, Bong-cha and the others letting out a collective sigh of relief. For the group of supernatural beings they had faced the boogeyman and lived to tell the tale.</p>
