<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Greg stood in the door, his back to me. I could feel him thinking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool.&quot; He said not looking back, walking away and letting the door swing closed.<br />
<br />
I sat on the edge of the nurse bed, suddenly realising I was naked. I heard my legs peel away from the rubbery blue surface, a little painfully, but other than a little of my own... juices... I&#39;d taken Greg&#39;s load admirably, and I felt my hunger fully subside for now.<br />
<br />
Getting myself dressed, thinking over how awesome that just was and how amazing Greg had been about it all I heard the bell go above me. Shit... next period! Rushing back to my maths room, Mr Petersen was just wiping down the board as I entered to grab my things.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah Danny, everything... OK?&quot; He asked tentatively with a wry smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir&quot; I responded cheerfully, beaming at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, good.&quot; He adjusted his chubbed up bulge as he spoke. My eyes wandered and I felt a thrill go through me. &quot;Anyway, off to your next lesson.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir&quot; I left and headed over to the biology labs.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
I got in and found myself among a few of my fellow maths students. I found the only free seat near the back next to Zayn, the transfer student. He nodded at me amiably, I smiled back. He was cute, so short though. I was about 5&#39;10&quot; and he was a head shorter than me, maybe 5&#39;4&quot;? But looking casually down... fuck he was packing a lot in those slacks! His prodigious bulge almost went to his knee! I gulped and made myself look elsewhere.<br />
<br />
At the front sat the class clown, P... P... who knows what his name is! Sat next to him was Mike, his thick glasses perched on his cute little nose. And at the head of the class was Mrs. Forton. A large, busty woman with a stern look, she did not like fun in her classroom. We&#39;d all been held back at the end of the day before due to people messing around with beakers, or test tubes or something.<br />
<br />
&quot;So class, today I want good behaviour! We&#39;re going to be discussing human biology, in particular we&#39;re going to be discussing the details of human sexuality and sex education.<br />
<br />
Pete... Paul.. whatever his name was wolf whistled which was met with laughter from the class.<br />
<br />
&quot;Preston! You get one warning!&quot; She responded loudly and firmly not even looking at him.<br />
<br />
Preston! That was it. He was funny to be honest. And kind of... nope concentrate Danny!<br />
<br />
&quot;OK turn to page 64, we&#39;ll be looking at the role of the brevis-male in society. For those that don&#39;t know the term, society refers to them as short-penes men.&quot; She paused, clearly awaiting more frivolity. This time though the class was calmly rapt. I couldn&#39;t help but find it comforting and alarming at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, as you can see from the diagram, the brevis-male is indeed smaller in length and girth than a standard male, known as a magna-male or commonly and large-penes male.&quot; Looking around the room everyone was reading the diagram with fascination.<br />
<br />
&quot;As you all know a brevis-male is very rare, only one in ten thousand men. That means that right now there are about 35 million short dick men in the world, obviously meaning that you are unlikely to meet one in you lifetime, if they let themselves be known anyway.&quot; I was fascinated, it was like hearing about my own people for the first time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Their genitals function the same as any male&#39;s however they produce a small quantity of semen, and most, if not all, are stimulated by being berated or teased about their... deficiencies in size.&quot; She clearly looked uncomfortable at the thought.<br />
<br />
A hand shot up, it was Mike&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Michael?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, can shor... I mean brevis-males... erm... procreate?&quot; He asked, his voice dropping off at the end.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually yes, they are as fertile... well based on equivalent volumes, as fertile as magna-males. They however find sexual activity more difficult due to the size differences between magna-males and brevis-males. A brevis-male may struggle to reach the necessary... depth... to deposit sperm inside a female.&quot; There were a few mutterings from the girls, mostly comments of shock, that anyone would dream of being with a short-dick.<br />
<br />
Mrs Forton, banged her hand on the desk a couple of times and the room was silent again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now... where was I... yes, the brevis-male is instinctively submissive to magna-males. He will submit to their needs and feed on their semen, which can actively be absorbed by them as nutrients. This makes then very desirable as mates for homosexual males, as they can be cared for easily and cheaply...&quot; I was appalled at the way she refered to me... well us like some kind of pets before she corrected herself. &quot;Sorry I apologise, I didn&#39;t mean to sound like they were less than... I will choose my words more carefully.&quot;<br />
<br />
Preston piped up &quot;It&#39;s OK Miss, not like we have any here! They&#39;re so rare!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Quite, yes but I should be more careful.&quot; I agreed, she should.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss... uh...&quot; Zayn next to me had his hand up. I was a little surpised as he&#39;d been quiet the whole time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, uh Zed?&quot; She inquired.<br />
<br />
&quot;Zayn.&quot; He corrected. &quot;Do they... have ... the work?&quot; His english could do with some work, still he was lovely to look at from this angle... stop Danny!<br />
<br />
&quot;Aha yes they are productive members of society, the same as anyone else. They in fact go to great lengths to hide their status so they can be. They will often wear a prothesis called a &#39;falsie&#39; that will give the impression of full sized male genitalia. There are physical difference other than their genitals however, they develop additional elasticity in their rectal walls and a secondary joint in the jaw to allow them to... well you get the idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
The class went on, a few questions here and there. Are they all gay? No, in fact 90% are hetrosexual. Do they like being short-dicks? From studies, yes they do, however they want to be treated equally at work, something that has been a problem for many years. And so on.<br />
<br />
At the end of the class the bell rang and I began to pack up my things when I felt Zayn&#39;s small hand grab my arm gently.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brevis?&quot; He whispered conspriatorially to me as people filed past.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; I asked confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are a nit-noi? A.. uhm brevis?&quot; He looked at me genuinely.<br />
<br />
Panic hit me like a ton of bricks.<br />
<br />
&quot;A short-dick? What? No?&quot; I whispered firmly at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;No? You seem it now... look?&quot; He pointed at my crotch. I looked down and noticed my falsie had separated from my waist a little. I must not have connected it up tightly enough and it must have slipped. I pulled my knee up sharply, the falsie moved back into place smacking me in the balls as it did. I groaned softly and coughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just the way I&#39;m sat Zayn.&quot; I stood up and grabbing my bag left without another word.<br />
<br />
In my head he would have heard me screaming.<br />
<br />
FUCKFUCKFUCKFUCK!!!</p>
