<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hey Matt... This was a gay bar right?&quot; Bryan asked<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what it said on google...&quot; Matt replied<br />
Bryan scoffed &quot;One more reason to be skeptical of the search engine.&quot; <br />
&quot;and yet you don&#39;t use bing or duck duck or whatever other search engines are available&quot; Matt muttered. Search engines aside looking out at the bar there was a lot of men and women drinking at tables, the bar table, and out on the dance floor. Neither of them were annoyed with women being at a gay bar... presuming they were also gay, but men and women were for sure mixing together and enjoying the straight experience. Matt said &quot;It might not be a gay bar, but it does look like a nice place and the reviews say the drinks are good and cheap.&quot; Bryan looked really annoyed but he wasn&#39;t walking out so this was probably going to be fine. They managed to track down a handsome Waiter who looked more like a butler with his uniform and lucky them they managed to get seats near the end of the bar where things were a little more quiet so they could hear each other without the music and bodies being deafening. <br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be bringing you two any food from the kitchen.&quot; He handed them each a menu and said &quot;Our food, and some of our specialties on the drink menu. That said our bartenders know how to make most things so don&#39;t be afraid to ask.&quot; <br />
Then a sweet high pitched voice said &quot;And I&#39;ll be your bartender.&quot; the two gay besties looked to their bartender and saw a bit of a somewhat short woman with an average sized chest. The two wouldn&#39;t have noticed her chest even if they were exposed considering her hair seemed to be cotton candy colored fluffy twintails. <br />
&quot;Hello there...&quot; Matt said wondering how her hair didn&#39;t get in the way of being a bartender, but Bryan was just annoyed wishing their waiter were their bartender instead. The bartender chuckled and then brought out some glasses and started mixing a drink. <br />
&quot;We didn&#39;t order anything yet!&quot; Bryan said annoyed that she might be trying to force a drink on them. <br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry~&quot; The bartender said &quot;It&#39;s a special party tonight, so we are offering our guests a special drink for free.&quot; <br />
Matt was looking at the mixing and asked &quot;What&#39;s in it?&quot; <br />
&quot;Gin, some Egg whites, bit of lemon, some grenadine, applejack, a few cherries, and a bit of magic.&quot; the bartender recited. <br />
&quot;Please hold any anime maid bullshit.&quot; Bryan said <br />
Matt panickily said &quot;Please excuse him. He just thought this was a gay bar.&quot; <br />
The bartender smiled and as she was almost finished making the drinks pulled out a small book from her Apron and said &quot;would you prefer a spell like...&quot; She flipped through the book a bit and then recited some guttural incantation you&#39;d expect to hear from some Lovecraftian cult. <br />
Bryan smirked and said &quot;Hey not bad.&quot; not seeing the invisible energies being infused into their drinks. The bartender pushed the pink cocktails to her customers and said &quot;We&#39;re having a special deal today. fifty bucks and you get all the cocktails or beer you want for the night.&quot; <br />
Matt asked &quot;Hey Bryan, think you have 6 or 7 drinks in you?&quot; <br />
&quot;Fuck yes, although you have to imagine its 8 with this little... It&#39;s essentially a Pink Lady right?&quot; Bryan asked<br />
The bartender giggled and said &quot;Yeah, but if you want I have some food color if you want to be a Blue Lady or maybe a Green lady...&quot; <br />
Matt said &quot;Got some yellow, that&#39;s my favorite color.&quot; <br />
Bryan was starting to get in the mood and said &quot;I&#39;ll take a Blue lady.&quot; <br />
The bartender smiled and got out some food coloring droplets and colored their cocktails and said &quot;Enjoy~&quot; They did enjoy. A Pink lady wasn&#39;t exactly their cup of tea, but it was well made. They both enjoyed the concoction as it entered their system and their digestive systems started to metabolize both the drinks and the magic cast on the alcohol.  <br />
<br />
In the middle of the second drinks two girls took a seat next to them who both looked kinda butch. Matt and Bryan were a little smaller in general as were their packages, but they didn&#39;t noticed that yet. The Bartender however said &quot;Ah, Melissa and Okasha! Welcome back. New theme tonight.&quot; and started to make them their complementary cocktails. The two presumably lesbians slammed down a fifty each along with a ten for tip and smiled. <br />
Melissa said &quot;Oh I heard. I think this&#39;ll be a nice experience to find some cuties.&quot; <br />
Bryan chuckled and said &quot;Sorry for ease dropping, but I think most people here are straight.&quot;  he wasn&#39;t exactly drunk, but he wasn&#39;t completely sober either and he was getting in the party mood. <br />
Melissa smirked and said &quot;Sure they are.&quot; as she knew the gimmick. The bartender had served them blue cocktails and had recited some other incantation. Melissa grabbed the glass and said &quot;Sucks to be those straight men. Still I bet you&#39;d look cute as a woman.&quot; <br />
Bryan chuckled a bit more and said &quot;What think your more manly than me?&quot; <br />
Melissa giggled a bit and asked &quot;And what if I thought I was?&quot; <br />
Bryan thought for a second and said &quot;Not much room for arm wrestling, but we&#39;ve got bottomless drinks. How about a drinking contest?&quot; <br />
Melissa smirked and completely downed her complementary cocktail in one long swig and said &quot;Shall we have a contest then?&quot; Bryan smirked downing the rest of his glass getting ready to have a drinking contest with a new drinking buddy.<br />
<br />
Matt stood up sipping his complementary drink and said &quot;Um... sorry about Bryan... Okasha was it?&quot;<br />
Okasha sighed and said &quot;Yeah... I can&#39;t believe Melissa is doing what she&#39;s doing myself...&quot; <br />
Matt took another sip and said &quot;Well I&#39;m Matt... I came with Bryan as a good friend going out drinking... what brings you here?&quot; <br />
Okasha sipped more of her cocktail and said &quot;Came here with my good friend Melissa to take adventure of both the special party here and the 50 buck bottomless drinks.&quot; Matt could see the bartender being less precise with mixing cocktails for Melissa and Bryan as they were downing them pretty fast, and watering them down a little bit. More for their sakes than the tab.<br />
&quot;Yeah... I can tell Melissa can take advantage of that deal.&quot; Matt then finished his cocktail and asked &quot;Is there any drinks here you  suggest?&quot;<br />
Okasha smiled and said &quot;Hey barkeep, one of your sparkling T-balls.&quot; then she looked back to Matt and said &quot;it&#39;s a highball but based around black tea. It&#39;s great I swear.&quot; The bartender smiled and made a few drinks and while their best friends were drinking as much as they could Okasha and Matt were actually enjoying their well crafted drinks.  As they were enjoying each other&#39;s company Matt started noticing there was some stubble on her chin and... was his arms getting thinner. <br />
Matt said &quot;Woah... either the drinks are stronger than I thought or I drank more than I thought... I&#39;m seeing things...&quot; <br />
Okasha feeling a growth in now his crotch straining smiled and said &quot;No you aren&#39;t. This is a gay bar and everyone here came gay. But this is the straight party. So the complementary drinks was here to change our sex, but not what we like to fuck.&quot; <br />
Matt said &quot;Well... You do look handsome...&quot; and then thought for a second and pulled some of his lengthening hair and saw that it was yellow. Not blonde, but more like the yellow of a notorious electric rat. Now that he was looking more around he saw their clothes were a little blurry, but pulling his shirt a bit... There was a bra forming and his chest was a bit swollen. &quot;Woah...&quot; <br />
Okasha chuckled and said &quot;You sure you&#39;re a gay man?&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey any man would feel weird that their growing tits. Bryan we&#39;re...&quot; and then Matt held her hand as Bryan was for sure a woman. She was just wearing a nice dress, her hair was up and done, and she seemed to be completely wasted. <br />
<br />
Bryan&#39;s head was so very cloudy as she was at her... somethingth drink... Low motor functions and low brain functions left her and her blueberry blue hair not realizing she had changed at all. She stared at her drinking buddy and laughed and said &quot;I outdrank that bitch didn&#39;t I!?!? She went running right dude?&quot; <br />
Melissa grinned at his new form being nice big and buff and playing around said &quot;Sure she did dude. You sure showed how manly you are, I&#39;d bring you back to my apartment for a one night stand in fact.&quot; Melissa was drunk, but having gained a bit of alcoholic resistance he had basically won the drinking competition and was now actually fully enjoying his drinks. Although he had to admit that Bryan turned out to be a cute and arousing woman. She had the sorta body type Melissa enjoyed and had no resistance as she didn&#39;t realize her top showed off a large amount of cleavage, and when she moved at the right angle Melissa wondered whether he could see Bryan&#39;s nipples inside her bra. Melissa was also thankful he was sitting down as he had no experience hiding or not getting boners. <br />
<br />
&quot;...&quot; Matt stared at their much more drink counterparts and looked at her chest. Her new blouse looking cute and... well her breasts looked big to her, but then again she never tried to figure out how big boobs were from your own point of view. &quot;Am I as big as her?&quot; <br />
Okasha in just jeans and a polo shirt at this point smirked and said &quot;Nah, you&#39;re actually pretty.&quot; <br />
Matt blushed a bit and said &quot;Ah... Umm... thanks?&quot; not sure if she was able to accept the complement wondering if the magic was responsible for most of her looks. &quot;Well you look nice and handsome.&quot; she took another sip of her... was it third T-ball? &quot;wonder if the magic gave you that stereotypical black man member.&quot; <br />
Okasha said &quot;Well I haven&#39;t been able to measure it, but would you like me to use it on you?&quot; <br />
Matt blushed a little redder as she said &quot;Um... I... don&#39;t think I&#39;m ready to get dicked in that new hole... especially with someone I just met.&quot; She thought a bit and asked &quot;Umm... Bartender? I&#39;m getting a little concerned will this magic wear off on it&#39;s own or do we need to get a new... magic drink?&quot; <br />
The bartender smiled and said &quot;It should be finished by tomorrow morning. If you want something more permanent it&#39;ll cost a bit more.&quot; <br />
Matt smiled a bit relieved, and then she saw a somewhat drunk Melissa carrying a very drunk Bryan in his arms. <br />
Melissa smiled and said &quot;Taking this... Piece of beefcake... and we&#39;ll be having a good time together.&quot; <br />
Okasha looked and said &quot;Think you had enough drinks Matt? Our apartment has thick walls, and since your bud is... going to be busy with my bud you&#39;ll be free to join us.&quot;<br />
Matt finished her drink and said &quot;I think that&#39;d be a good idea. Have a place to sober up and gotta make sure my best friend stays safe...&quot; Matt thought again and then took a picture of Bryan in Melissa&#39;s arms and said &quot;gotta show him what he looked like right?&quot; The four genderswapped and now technically straight friends went to Okasha and Melissa&#39;s apartment. It was very nice, and Melissa took Bryan to his bedroom to presumably fuck till they dropped. Meanwhile Matt was sipping some tea... It was nice tea... and then there was Okasha, a nice handsome looking man that she had to admit she was having a bit of a crush on. However she was hesitating was Okasha also hesitating?<br />
Okasha said &quot;So... you don&#39;t want me to put my dick in you, but... I kinda want to explore what it&#39;s like being a guy, don&#39;t you want to explore a bit of what it&#39;s like being a girl? If you don&#39;t want to... then that&#39;s that. I can just put up something on Netflix if you want and we&#39;ll just chill. But do you want to explore a bit?&quot;</p>
