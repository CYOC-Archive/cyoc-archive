<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hannah Connors awoke to her phone’s alarm much to her dismay. She looks at the clock and sees it’s 8:00 A.M., she turns off the alarm and feels a sense of anxiety come on to her. Hannah goes to the bathroom and goes through her morning routine and then makes her way to the kitchen and makes a smoothie consisting of protein powder, spinach, kale, banana, and a coffee. The 29-year-old takes sips while looking out the window of her Chicago penthouse. <br />
<br />
“Today is the day!” She says to herself <br />
<br />
Hannah is expecting a call today, a call she has been anxiously waiting for. Then at around 10:25 A.M., her phone goes off and it’s the number she has been waiting for. <br />
<br />
”Hello Ms. Connors, this is Levar, your liaison from Multiplicity Inc., how is your day going?”<br />
<br />
”Hi Levar, I am doing well thank you for asking! How are you doing?”<br />
<br />
”I am glad you are well Ms. Connors and I am doing good as well. I know you have been anxious these past three months but we are calling you to confirm that Bear’s conversion was a success.” <br />
<br />
”No way yes that is wonderful, when can I pick her up?” <br />
<br />
”As early as you want or when can send her to you at no cost.”<br />
<br />
”That’s nice but I will come over and pick her up.”<br />
<br />
”Okay gotcha Ms. Connors, we a Multiplicity Inc. would like to thank you for choosing us. We hope you and you&#39;re new clone have happy memories together!” <br />
<br />
”Oh we will Levar, thank you!”<br />
<br />
Hannah goes to her closet and gets dressed. She wears an orange off-the-shoulder blouse and high-waisted blue jeans. She wears minimal makeup and decides to let her long dark blonde hair down today. When Multiplicity Inc. announced that dogs and cats could be used as subjects for the Clone Machine, she was happy to hear this. Despite her enormous success as an app developer/ businesswoman, Hannah has been feeling alone for quite some time. Her parents died four years ago, and as an only child, she was all alone. She was sad for about a year and decided to adopt a German Shepherd three years ago, naming him Bear. He has been her best friend ever since, and it&#39;s been them against the world, especially after every breakup. Hannah realized the only person she truly loves is herself, and Bear would only be the acceptable subject to become her. While her best friend would be dead in a sense, he would be reborn as a clone of Hannah. Of course, Hannah was anxious, and while she did receive routine updates on his conversion process, she prayed Bear had a successful conversion process. It was terrifying yet amazing, to watch as Bear slowly turned into a human during three months. <br />
<br />
She parks her car in the facility and walks into the luxurious building. It looks like a futuristic medical clinic and Hannah reaches the front desk to check-in. She is then immediately brought to the recovery room and gasps. Everything from her long dark blonde hair, brown eyes, 5’6” frame, D cup breasts, hourglass figure, and shapely ass, all perfectly recreated. The new Hannah that used to be Bear is wearing a red midi floral sundress and her eyes light up at seeing her original/master. <br />
<br />
”Hi.... me!” Hannah says with some nervousness in her voice <br />
<br />
”Oh my gosh Hannah it&#39;s so nice to see you again, I have to say, thank you so much for making me a human, especially a copy of you!” <br />
<br />
”You&#39;re welcome Hannah, I&#39;m just curious how much of being Bear do you remember?”<br />
<br />
”To be honest, I have no memories of being a dog, but I have your memories of taking my old self to this clinic to have Bear turned into me. Once I recognized I was inside a large cylindrical tube, I realized I used to Bear. Although, I do feel this weird urge to obey you and please you just like Bear did.” Hannah-2 says fully displaying Hannah’s mannerisms <br />
<br />
”You&#39;re not mad right?”<br />
<br />
”Of course not, I love being a human, this smooth skin beats fur any day, trust me. Considering it&#39;s just us in here I have a confession, Hannah.” <br />
<br />
”That would be?” <br />
<br />
”I watched a time-lapse video of Bear’s transformation into me, it was so stimulating, watching Bear changed species and eventually become me... your clone!” <br />
<br />
”I’m glad you enjoyed it, Hannah! Would you like to come home?” <br />
<br />
”Yes, take me home right now!” <br />
<br />
With that the two Hannahs head home, the two enjoy singing their favorite songs and decide to stop at an upscale coffee shop. <br />
<br />
”Have you had anything to eat?” Hannah asks her clone <br />
<br />
”Nope, I haven&#39;t had anything at all!”<br />
<br />
”Well let&#39;s stop at Mikko’s for some coffee and scones before we head back home.”<br />
<br />
The two enter the establishment and order their favorite cinnamon vanilla ultra shot cold brew coffee and some banana bread. The two enjoy their time in Mikko’s and squeal when the barista says they are cute identical twin sisters, if only they knew. <br />
<br />
”So how&#39;s your first meal?” <br />
<br />
”It feels odd, I love the taste of this it&#39;s amazing don&#39;t get me wrong, but it&#39;s like I am experiencing this for the first time and that I have been having this forever.”<br />
<br />
”That’s interesting Hannah!”<br />
<br />
After finishing the two head back to the car and head back to their apartment building. This time Hannah-2 gets behind the wheel and Hannah-1 places a hand on her thigh. Hannah-2 feels like she&#39;s getting wet and she blows a kiss to herself. The two Hannahs make it back to their apartment building and park their car before heading to the elevator. The ride feels like it will never end as the sexual tension between the two Hannahs builds more. The elevator door opens to their penthouse on the 38th floor and the two pop off their shoes at the door. <br />
<br />
Hannah looks at her clone and without speaking a word, her clone takes off her clothes and spins. Hannah notices a serial number on Hannah-2’s ass cheek. Hannah-2 then gets down on her knees and waits patiently waiting for Hannah as she walks to their bedroom, getting something. Hannah smiles knowing that her best friend and loyal pet is now her loyal best friend and clone. She comes back to the living room where Hannah-2 is and Hannah-2 smiles. Hannah-2 gets up and gladly accepts the collar the original Hannah, her master is placing on her neck. Hannah then latches a leash to the collar and leads her clone to the couch. She then takes her clothes off and she is naked just like Hannah-2. Hannah-2 then places her head on Hannah-1’s lap. <br />
<br />
”I love you so much Hannah, I cannot thank you enough for making me your clone.” <br />
<br />
”I love you too Hannah, we have finally achieved true love!” <br />
<br />
Hannah-2 then goes down on her knees once more and Hannah-1 grabs that lovely long blonde of hers and yanks it hard. Hannah-2 enjoys the pain and only wants to pleasure the original Hannah. She takes a second to admire that fit-toned body of hers, the workouts can be grueling at times but the results are well worth it. Hannah-2 places her tongue on Hannah’s pussy and begins to lick that pussy. Hannah-1 lets out a big moan as she has never had someone know every spot of her pussy. Hannah has been fantasizing about having a submissive clone of herself for years, now that she has one it feels like she&#39;s complete. In no time she cums hard. Hannah takes a minute to recover but then she takes Hannah-2’s leash and yanks at it, then place her hand on Hannah-2’s ass and starts to spank it. <br />
<br />
”Yes Master spank our ass, beat our ass like a drum!” <br />
<br />
Hannah-1 obliges her clone and she gets turned on more. Hannah-1 then leads her to come to the bedroom and they sit close to each other, Hannah-2 reaches for something in the nightstand. It is a vibrator and they position it between their legs. It goes off and both Hannahs let out loud moans as they get closer to orgasm. They cum together and start to make out. They lay in bed, cuddling after the most amazing sex, and smile knowing that they will live life rich, sexy, and in love.</p>
