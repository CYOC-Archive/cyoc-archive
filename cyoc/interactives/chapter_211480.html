<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You raised your phone and snapped a photo of a 12-year-old boy playing ball with his equally-aged friends. He&#39;s your typical pre-pubescent teen. His hair is brown and short. He&#39;s got a little bit of tan to his thin and lithe body. And the skillful way he maneuvers the ball with his feet suggests that he plays for a soccer team in their school. Besides Finn, you&#39;re quite relieved that no one has seen you. You look back at Finn who gave you this confused look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really, a child?&quot; Finn mumbled. His cigarette is burnt to the butt. He didn&#39;t bother lighting up another one because they need to return to the office in about 15 minutes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot; You thought it long and decided a young body is the best one to swap with. &quot;You&#39;ve got no responsibilities other than school. The food and rent are free. And I can easily ace the guy&#39;s school grades.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever floats your boat, man,&quot; Finn said. &quot;If this really works, I&#39;m going to meet you here? Same time and the same place?&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded your head.<br />
<br />
For the rest of the day, you continued doing your work. But unlike before, you were working with a smile. You cannot contain the excitement inside of you. You know the app is real. Because when you snapped the boy&#39;s picture, you felt some sort of energy whizz inside of you. And that energy has remained throughout the day up until the moment you close your eyes before sleep.<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
You awoke the next day without the usual fatigue and parched throat. Nevertheless, you reached for the nightstand where you usually place a cup of water. Your hand reached something ceramic and long, and you nearly pushed it over the edge before you caught it. It&#39;s a lamp now that you&#39;ve looked at it. You don&#39;t realize owning such a lamp, especially when it&#39;s decorated with cartoonish depictions of cars and spaceships. Not only that, you don&#39;t recognize the other things in this rather spacious bedroom. The walls are littered with posters of soccer players. The floor is a maze of strewn automobile toys and building blocks. There&#39;s a corkboard that lists your school schedule. Then that&#39;s when it hit you.<br />
<br />
You looked at your hands. They are small and devoid of calluses. These fingers have never experienced labor. You turned your head and saw a mirror at the far side of the room. Still dressed in your blue-striped pajamas, you approached the mirror. You recognized the reflection as the brown-haired and maroon-eyed boy you took a picture with yesterday. All of his movements in the reflection mimicked yours. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m... I&#39;m Nathan,&quot; Somehow, you knew the boy&#39;s name as if it was something natural in your mind. Not only that, Nathan&#39;s entire life is laid upon you like an open book. He&#39;s lived a typical suburban life with his housewife of a mother, father who works overseas, and overachieving older brother. His study is fine but he could do a little more work regarding his mathematics. He excels in soccer, and his coach remembers to always commend his growth. He&#39;s a bit timid, often avoiding confrontations by shying away in a corner. That&#39;s the reason why he hasn&#39;t had a playground enemy his entire life. <br />
<br />
You picked up his phone decorated with a PocketGoblin cover. You wouldn&#39;t know what franchise the cover was if not for Nathan&#39;s memories. You opened the phone and saw the &#39;Swap Snap&#39; app, just as the instructions said. When you opened it, the mascot congratulated you for your first swap. Then another button appeared that will lead you to another window detailing the stats of your use of the app. Of course, it lists the number of swaps as &quot;1&quot;. There&#39;s also a list of people that I&#39;ve swapped with. The only listed name is &quot;Nathan Jacob Addams&quot;.<br />
<br />
You looked back at the mirror and a boy&#39;s reflection stared back. You still can&#39;t believe that this is happening. This is the plot of fantasies and sci-fi shows. And yet, here you are in the body of a 12-year-old boy. This is now your body. You could do whatever you want. You went back to your bed where you removed your pajamas and underwear. A penis with the shape and size of a peanut stares back at you. With trembling fingers, you pinched the shaft and promptly squeaked when you felt lightning dance on your spine. Fuck! This penis is sensitive. And judging by the purity of your memories, Nathan hasn&#39;t touched himself in his entire life. Too bad for him, because you&#39;d be taking his first time. You continued squeezing your dick and you&#39;ve begun to pull the foreskin. Each movement is enough to make you moan. Fuck, you haven&#39;t begun properly jerking off and you&#39;re already this wet. You bent over the bed and jerked off your miniature dick. With your breath foaming at your chest, you screamed on your bed as you came for the first time in this body. Your mind is dancing and your head is near to bursting. Lobs of cum emptied on your blankets. The more cum came out, the more you realize the mistake of soiling your favorite safety blanket. One part of you hated yourself, while another didn&#39;t care. You&#39;re a 35-year-old man in a 12-year-old&#39;s body, you have no need for safety blankets.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nathan! How long are you planning to sleep? You&#39;ll be running late if you don&#39;t eat your breakfast now.&quot; <br />
<br />
You flinched and you quickly hid your soiled blanket in the hamper before your mother could see it. <br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
It still feels kind of awkward. Just yesterday, you&#39;d be wearing a suit and tie. At this hour, you&#39;d be on a line photocopying the documents Janice put on your desk. But now? You&#39;re walking you&#39;re way to school with Nathan&#39;s friends. They&#39;re talking about the latest PocketGoblin anime episode. It seems the main character whom you originally watched back in your old identity is now being replaced by new protagonists. For once, you and Nathan&#39;s minds shared sadness about the fact. <br />
<br />
He&#39;s getting replaced too, huh...?<br />
<br />
It&#39;s strange talking to Nathan&#39;s friends. You speak to them as if you&#39;ve known them for years. You laugh at their childish jokes and get a little pissed at banters directed at you. You don&#39;t show your annoyed face, however. Nathan is too timid to do that. Little do they know, that they are talking to a man thrice older than them.<br />
<br />
School went fine today. It&#39;s just discussions about topics you already know as an adult. Too bad, you weren&#39;t given a chance to show your mature intelligence today. But you were given Algebraic assignments today, which you quickly finished before class has even finished. It&#39;s nothing a full-pledged accountant would worry about. <br />
<br />
Today is a Monday and your class ends at 2:00 PM. You can&#39;t remember how long it was since your responsibilities had ended at this hour. Hell, you don&#39;t even think your day ended this early. Although, Nathan&#39;s schedule goes a little beyond that. He&#39;s a part of the school&#39;s junior soccer team and they have an hour-long practice after class. Then you also remembered the promise you made with Finn. You&#39;d meet him during his break, which would be at 2:30 PM. There is a 15-minute walk to the park, a little shorter if he used these short legs to run. So, what will you choose?</p>
