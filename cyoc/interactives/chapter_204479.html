<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Thanks to Stormwolf for this chapter!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Within a few days of opening, business at Mag Mell Casino was booming. Despite the risks that were clear for all patrons to see when they entered, no one ever seemed to be deterred. <br />
<br />
Upon entering the casino, guests were greeted with a large, elegant fountain that was adorned with gold statues. Up a small set of stairs behind the fountain on a large rotating podium was the newest model of Hexla electric sports cars, available to anyone lucky enough to win the grand prize. Just behind the car podium was a large prize wheel that could reward anyone lucky enough to land on the right space with a variety of prizes ranging from more chips to gamble with all the way up to an all-expenses paid cruise. <br />
<br />
Beyond the entrance, the casino opened up and revealed a vast amount of slot machines, poker tables, roulette tables, blackjack tables, and other gambling activities. There was a five-star restaurant and bar, a movie theater, and even an entire roller coaster. There was no shortage of ways for people to spend their hard-earned money. However, in this casino, running out of money was only the least of people’s concerns…<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-==-<br />
<br />
“Okay, your hand has been dealt. Will you hit or stand?”<br />
<br />
James looked at his hand, sweating nervously. He had one Queen, a five, and a four. That added up to nineteen points. The dealer, meanwhile, had a two, a five, and a three, as well as the card that was face down. That added up to ten points. James was winning, and quite frankly, he really needed this win. He was on his last Soul Chip. If he lost this chip, it was game over. <br />
<br />
“I’ll stand,” James said. The dealer nodded, grabbed the face-down card, and flipped it over. As soon as James saw the card, his heart sank. <br />
<br />
Ace of spades. <br />
<br />
“Looks like I have twenty-one points,” the dealer said. “House wins.” The dealer reached out and took James’ Soul Chip. <br />
<br />
“I-Isn’t there any way I can get another Soul Chip?!” James begged, looking at the dealer with pleading eyes. The dealer just shrugged and shook his head. <br />
<br />
“Sorry kid, you read the rules when you walked in,” the dealer replied. “All games are binding, and the loser’s life is forfeit to the House or the opponent.” <br />
<br />
James lowered his head in defeat, unaware of the changes that his body was beginning to undergo. His body lost most of its muscle, giving him a slim, smooth body. His nipples grew a bit fatter as his hips widened, giving him a nice curvy frame. <br />
<br />
As his clothes began to become baggier and baggier, James found himself struggling to keep himself looking decent. His nipples began to push out, giving him nice D-cup breasts. His cock and balls pulsed painfully, shrinking rapidly. Beneath his balls, his skin parted and created a wet, warm slit.<br />
<br />
His cock was sucked into his body as a wave of heat washed over his body. James let out a slight whimper as he (she?) felt an overwhelming desire for someone to breed her new pussy. As her hair lengthened, she felt someone place a hand on her shoulder. <br />
<br />
“You know, my break is coming up,” the dealer said in a seductive tone. “You want me to help you out with that?” He pointed down to her crotch, a wet stain in her pants. <br />
<br />
Jamie blushed and nodded her head, making the dealer grin. He grabbed her hand and led her towards the private rooms in the back. <br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-==-<br />
<br />
Harry was determined to win this game. The stakes were high, and he was ready to win. He just needed a good roll, and this game was his. <br />
<br />
The man cupped the dice in his hands and shook them for three seconds. Three was his lucky number, and shaking his dice for exactly three seconds before rolling them had never let him down before. When three seconds were up, Harry tossed the dice onto the table and watched them roll. When they stopped, his heart dropped. <br />
<br />
“Ooh, snake eyes!” the dealer said, looking at the dice. “Looks like you’ve lost!” <br />
<br />
Harry suddenly began to feel itchy. Like…ridiculously itchy…<br />
<br />
He began to scratch his arms; slowly at first, but he sped up as the itching refused to go away. Harry was so preoccupied with scratching himself that he failed to notice the world around him getting bigger. It wasn’t until his clothes began to fall off of him that he realized how small he’d gotten. <br />
<br />
“H-Hey! What’s the big idea?!” the man shouted as brown fur spread over his body. “What the hell are you doing to me?!” <br />
<br />
The dealer looked down at him and smirked. “Didn’t you read the rules?” he asked. “The loser’s life is forfeit to the House. That means that I can change you into whatever the hell I want.” <br />
<br />
“You can’t just do that!” Harry shouted, his feet lengthening and turning into large rabbit feet. His thumbs disappeared from his hands as his nails lengthened into sharp claws, perfect for digging burrows in the ground. His tailbone extended into a short, fluffy tail that twitched in fear as the man continued to transform. <br />
The dealer knelt down to get closer to the transforming male. “There’s no law saying I can’t transform you,” he said, watching as Harry was forced down onto all fours, his body rounding out and taking on the shape of a rabbit’s body. The man’s mouth and nose extended out slightly, turning into a muzzle with a small, triangular nose. As his ears lengthened and moved to the top of his head, Harry’s front teeth grew a bit bigger, making them perfect for biting into delicious juicy vegetables like lettuce and carrots. <br />
<br />
“Why don’t you relax, little bunny?” the dealer asked, scooping the mostly transformed male up in his arms and scratching in between his ears. Harry’s eyelids fluttered slightly as a rush of euphoria flooded his body. Fuck, those scratches felt so…so good…<br />
<br />
As the dealer continued to scratch Harry’s head, the pleasurable feeling began to take hold of his body. He was content like this. He didn’t need anything else in life other than to be cared for and fed by a human. The human gives him food, water, love, and affection. What more could a rabbit ever want? <br />
<br />
The rabbit sighed peacefully as his human life was forgotten. <br />
<br />

<br />
Johnny sat back in his chair, looking at the hand he’d been dealt. It took him a bit to get into the feel of things, but he hadn’t lost a game of Poker before in his life. He knew how these casino dealers played, and he knew how to beat them at their own game. <br />
<br />
“Alright sir, will you hit or stand?” The dealer asked.<br />
<br />
Johnny smirked. “I’ll stand.”<br />
<br />
The dealer flipped over his cards. “Two pairs, eight and nine.”<br />
<br />
Johnny nodded before flipping over his cards, and he chuckled slightly as the dealer went bug-eyed for a split second. Three aces and a pair of fives. <br />
<br />
“Full House,” Johnny said triumphantly. “Guess that means I win again.” <br />
<br />
The dealer nodded in agreement, a look of complete disbelief on his face. How this man had managed to win so many games in a row was beyond him. <br />
<br />
“So, you want to go for another round?” Johnny asked, looking at the dealer’s shocked expression. “Or can I just take my winnings and leave now?”<br />
<br />
“Y-You can leave…” the dealer said, unsure of what else to do. Johnny nodded, scooped up his large pile of chips, and took them to collect his winnings.</p>
