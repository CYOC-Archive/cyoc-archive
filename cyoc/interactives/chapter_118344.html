<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">All three Jeffs were on the floor, panting as Jeff lay there in slight shock. He&#39;d just been penetrated and one of his clones had just cummed in his mouth using his own mouth. One smiled as he sat up. &quot;Dam, that was exciting.&quot; He said before he realized something was dribbling out of his mouth, wiping it away he blinked as he recognized the cum that had come out of his own mouth. &quot;You two are good, I&#39;ll give you that.&quot; Two suddenly said as he stood up, his cock still erect as both Jeff and One turned to him before blood rushed to their faces. They both felt so sensitive, and neither had a cock at the moment.<br />
&quot;So... who are the clones?&quot; Jeff asked. His own clone had said he was the real Jeff, but now there was three of him, and only one had a cock. &quot;Simple, I am.&quot; The third Jeff said, the one with the cock smiling as both Jeff and one stared at each other. &quot;I think the reality option made it so that whoever has a cock is the &#39;original&#39; Jeff.&quot; One said as he smirked. &quot;So I&#39;m a clone now, and so are you.&quot; He said, poking Jeff&#39;s sensitive chest as Jeff wondered how that even worked.<br />
&quot;Whatever, it&#39;ll all change back soon enough.&quot; Two said as he walked over and sat between Jeff and one before putting his hands to their bare crotches. Both Jeff and One felt a rush of pleasure as Jeff blushed as One moaned. &quot;But since I am the &#39;real&#39; Jeff here, you two are going to listen to me.&quot; Two said as One and Jeff nodded, playing along as Two went over to the chronovac.<br />
&quot;First off, no more clones, Three of us is enough... and second.&quot; He said with a smirk as he made a few minor changes. &quot;You two are going to be my bitches for the night.&quot; Two said as he hit enter, Jeff and one staring at each other as Two sat down between them again.<br />
Jeff noticed his nipples became erect, One&#39;s as well as their sensitivity grew extremely. One moaned as he put his hands to his bare chest, rubbing his nipples as Jeff crossed his arms over his sensitive chest, blushing as he felt flesh bubbling beneath his arms. He knew what Two had done to him and One, but he was going to enjoy it.<br />
Two watched with a smirk as Jeff and One grew nice matching sets of breasts, firm and round as he pointed at the floor. &quot;The next change is only gonna happen when both of you take a moment to...&quot; Two said as Jeff and One realized what he wanted them to do.<br />
Getting off the bed Jeff and One pushed their bare crotches against each other, the sensitivity and pleasure driving them mad as their breasts squished each other. Grinding their bare crotches against each other Jeff and One kissed as the skin on their crotches tore open to reveal moist vaginas even more sensitive then their bare crotches as Jeff and One felt something salty rise in their throats. As they were grinding and kissing Jeff suddenly lurched in sync with one as cum sprayed out of his own mouth and out of One&#39;s mouth, their cum mixing before they broke away from each other panting as drops of cum fell from the floor from their mouths.<br />
&quot;My god... That was amazing.&quot; One said as he held his hand to his head, his other hand cupping one of his breasts as Jeff shivered in shock. He&#39;d just came out of his own mouth, like he was one of the clones! Wait... at the moment reality said he was a clone. Shivering Jeff tried to get over the shock of that as he looked down at himself. His body was still mostly his own. The only changes that had happened were the nice, firm breasts he now had and his moist vagina.<br />
Two smiled as he spoke up. &quot;Alright ladies... who&#39;s ready for a good time.&quot; He said as Jeff and One looked at the bed, where Two was laying with his dick erect, both Jeff and One blushing as their vaginas became even more wet. This was going to be an interesting night.</p>
