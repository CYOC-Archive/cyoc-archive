<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Soon after, the break had ended and the contestants returned to their places. The only difference in them was that now Brian had zipped up his hooded jacket, which made him look slightly cleaner, and Eric changed into a dry polo. The blonde was still on a high from having his sudden win streak. He almost seemed more confident than Micheal or Brian as he walked onto the stage. Without his stage fright, he was sure he could do this. Nothing could get in the way of him winning the game.<br />
<br />
The theme song blared throughout the studio once again as the camera panned through the contestants and onto Nicky, who had removed his vest during the break and was now hanging from his pole upside down, his nipple rings on clear display for all. Gracefully, the green haired twink swung around the pole and landed right behind his podium, assuming his position.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome back! If you&#39;re just joining us, our three lucky men are totes well on their way to becoming the sexy sluts they never knew they wanted to be. Brian here has gone through two changes, making him, like, much happier and more honest. Next to him, Micheal still doesn&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with a straight man only owning jockstraps for underwear, and finally, Eric gained a totes hot confidence boost,&quot; Nicky explained. The three men had varying degrees of annoyance and disbelief on their faces. None of them believed they were becoming &#39;sluts&#39; and no one saw anything wrong with their changes yet.<br />
<br />
Nonetheless, Nicky continued. &quot;Now, we&#39;re gonna begin our second physical challenge. In this event, our contestants will have to use their balancing skills to either outlast their opponents or be the first get to the other side of the board appearing in front of you. As you can see, the board is a square with 81 tiles in play and the tiles in red are not your friends. If you lose your balance or land on a red square, you&#39;ll lose. So who&#39;s playing?&quot; In response, all three men immediately slapped their buzzers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great! I&#39;m glad to see such enthusiasm,&quot; Nicky stated. &quot;Now, take your places indicated on the floor.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric strode up to the place Nicky indicated, caution in the wind. The eyes staring at him plus his good luck was starting to make him overconfident and he somehow managed to convince himself that because he had good balance when he was younger, he&#39;d do fine here. Nevermind that that was more than two decades and two hundred pounds ago. Eric just didn&#39;t believe he could be stopped right now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, start the clock,&quot; Nicky ordered once the contestants had taken their places. &quot;Aaaaand BEGIN!&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric quickly realized why this would be so difficult. Each step only had space for one foot. Looking further down, he realized that the safe options were more scarce as the end neared. They&#39;d inevitably have to fight towards the end of the game. He couldn&#39;t focus on that right now though. He had to win. The blonde easily jumped past the first two rows due to the ample space for failure in them. Though the next two were tricky, Eric was surprisingly nimble in his actions and managed to keep his balance as he progressed. The blonde thought he was doing well until he looked to his right to see his competitors. Though for his figure Eric had progressed quickly, Brian and Micheal were already a row ahead of him. In fact, due to the lack of safe tiles in the last four rows, the two were already in a situation that should&#39;ve caused a fight. Luckily for Micheal, Brian wasn&#39;t really into fighting anymore, and by the time push came to shove, the bald man willingly let Micheal nudge him into a red spot, ending his run.<br />
<br />
Soon after, Eric was on the seventh row while Micheal was on the eighth. There was only one free spot on the last row. If Eric wanted to win, he had to make the jump. Using all his strength, he pushed forward in his Hail Mary. He could taste victory. It was so close! He could do--<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the blonde felt a force push him from his side. Eric quickly flew off track and onto the floor, hitting multiple red tiles with his face. &quot;Did you actually think that would work faggot?&quot; Micheal asked with a menacing laugh. &quot;I saw that shit a mile away.&quot;<br />
<br />
The brunette began laughing hysterically and Eric pulled himself to his feet. He looked to Nicky, who was looking at the scene with a disappointed pout. Noticing the eyes, the twink quickly changed that back to a sexy smile. &quot;Well I guess that means Micheal wins again. So Micheal, what do you wanna do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Make this fat fag&#39;s meter grow,&quot; Micheal answered evilly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then. Computer, it&#39;s time to twink!&quot; Nicky announced.<br />
<br />
The pink light shone on Eric once more as the blonde watched his meter grow well past the second tick and into the third. Before he could even complain about how unfair that was, the light grew intense and enveloped him once more. The same prickling feeling coursed through Eric&#39;s body again, changing him permenantly. Unlike last time, however, where the prickling feeling stopped all at once, this time it felt like it was gradually reducing within him. As that happened, a stronger prickling sensation burned in his head. Eric couldn&#39;t figure out what was happening, but it felt like something was being taken from him. When the light faded and the sensations abruptly ended, however, Eric couldn&#39;t figure out what he had lost.<br />
<br />
That was, of course, until he felt his khakis sagging. Eric looked down to see his that his clothes were much looser on his body. Tightening his belt, he realized he must&#39;ve lost almost a hundred pounds. While that still didn&#39;t mean he was necessarily skinny, he certainly wasn&#39;t in as bad a shape as before.<br />
<br />
But there had to be something else, right? Clearly, Eric&#39;s meter had passed the third tick. In fact, it was almost a quarter of the way to the fourth. So what had changed?<br />
<br />
Nicky brought Eric out of his thoughts with a hand on his shoulder. &quot;Hey hon, how do you feel?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Better. I feel like I just woke up from a thousand year nap!&quot; Eric replied. &quot;But I only see that I lost weight. Shouldn&#39;t I have gone through two changes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, maybe the other one&#39;s just more subtle,&quot; Nicky reasoned. &quot;Hey, by the way, since your shirt doesn&#39;t really fit you any longer, why don&#39;t you, like, take it off?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure!&quot; Eric responded happily. Without hesitation, the blonde removed his massive shirt from his body, letting the whole world see his nipples, which had hardened from the air vent above him. Sure, he wasn&#39;t in the best shape still, but the loss of weight left him much more toned, just a little chubby too. With a naughty smile he added, &quot;Maybe if I shrink any more I can get rid of these pants too.&quot;<br />
<br />
That would be fun, Eric thought. He could strut around the studio in just his boxers. Maybe even accidentally show off a bit more. &quot;Maybe, hon. Now, let&#39;s, like, get back to the questions, shall we?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric strode back to his podium. Being shirtless in front of millions of people would&#39;ve made him pass out just an hour ago. Now, he was smiling, glad to feel the breeze. After all, who wouldn&#39;t want to show off a little, Eric reasoned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, next question!&quot;</p>
