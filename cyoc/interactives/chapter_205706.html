<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Trevor could not believe he was the one of the targets of the senior prank, being a fellow senior no less, this was stuff meant for their underclassmen. Some things never change; Trevor&#39;s own gym locker had been cleaned out while he was showering after swimming. Trevor came back to an empty locker, he was annoyed but realized he had no choice but to find clothes in a random, open locker. Most of the lockers Trevor walked by had locks and the few without sadly came up empty. Rounding another row of lockers, Trevor found one a little beat up and clearly ajar, this might be the winner or even a chance where they might have hid his clothes, if he was lucky.<br />
<br />
Luck was on his side, but more than Trevor could ever have imagined, as he opened the locker and inside was a writhing mass of black ooze. Trevor could not help but smirk to himself and wondered if this is what the groundskeeper was mumbling about in passing as he crossed him in hallways, something about black ooze, made his arm muscular, and asking it to come back to him. There had to be no coincidence about what he had heard and what was writhing in front of Trevor at this moment, the selfsame black ooze. Trevor reached his hand out, the alien mass reacted in kind and reached out with wanting tendrils and laced their own body between his fingers and slithered up and around his forearm.<br />
<br />
Trevor gave out a low moan as he felt the weight of the black ooze completely take over his arm. Attempting to lift his arm, Trevor struggled to pull it into a flex, until the act became effortless, he felt what it was, the ooze was assisting him. The formless mass that was his arm started to take serious form, a muscular limb with twenty-five inch biceps covered in a lustrous, black, second skin. Trevor gave a ecstatic smile, he wanted to get a better look at his impressive arm. Walking over to the mirrors, Trevor had not even realized that his towel had dropped as he made his way. Trevor now if full view of the arm covered and molded into such a powerful and brawny appendage. As Trevor flexed, he never once dreamed in his eighteen years that he would have this kind of muscle. <br />
<br />
Losing all sense of time as he admired the arm, Trevor failed to notice as the mass slithered its way up from his arm, over his shoulder and made contact with his neck and the left side of his head. A voice ringed out into Trevor&#39;s mind, his muscular arm came down and clutched onto edge of the sink. The resounding voice made Trevor disoriented.<br />
<br />
&quot;My apologies...Trevor, is it?&quot; The voice within his mind spoke.<br />
<br />
Trevor looked around to see he was still alone in the locker room. Looking over at his watch he saw that no one should be filing in for the next class yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who said that? Where are you?&quot; Trevor called out, though he could imagine where exactly it came from.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me, right here on your arm and on the side of your head. I needed to make contact closer to your brain so that I can communicate with you.&quot; The black ooze calmly responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;re more than just some, body enhancing suit. You&#39;re alive and sentient. Wait, how do you know how to communicate with me?&quot; Trevor asked inquisitively.<br />
<br />
The alien ooze did a surface thought read on Trevor and knew exactly what he was pondering at that thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;The groundskeeper. He found me and I attempted to bond with him as I slithered inside of his body. His body was full of great potential and I was able to manifest it but, his age and in part his body&#39;s inability to retain me completely made us, incompatable.&quot; The alien sounded sad at remembering being rejected from his host.<br />
<br />
Trevor began to stroke the alien ooze on his left arm, in an attempt to console the being in the only way he could. It was then, Trevor felt he could do something to help and was more than willing to try.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take me. You said his age was an issue, right? I am younger than he is and I am willing to be your host. Not sure if my body can take you, I am not a specimen of prime fitness.&quot; Trevor looks his lanky body over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Neither was the groundskeeper. If you are willing to be my host I will make you into the man of your deepest desires. I can see what you like, what you, release to.&quot; The ooze spoke.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you can see my thoughts, even though you are not bonded with me?&quot; Trevor blushed at the alien&#39;s mention of release.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see what crosses your mind in the moment, not all of your thoughts, or emotions. For something like that, I need to get inside of your body, you have to want me, no, need me to bond with you. Do you...&quot; The ooze speaks and then halts themselves.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I need you. Whatever you can give me, I will take it. If you need my body, I will share it. Make me like them, like those bodybuilders on the magazines. Muscular and masculine, brimming with confidence, the kind of person everyone desires to be around.&quot; Trevor speaks out the truth, the need that has consumed him ever since he first laid his eyes on a muscle mag.<br />
<br />
The black ooze shifts Trevor&#39;s taken over arm to caress his face. &quot;Let me be your symbiote then, Trevor. Share your life with me and I will share mine with you. All of my power and capabilities, I will dedicate them to you. I ask this only once, will you bond with me?&quot;Yes</p>
