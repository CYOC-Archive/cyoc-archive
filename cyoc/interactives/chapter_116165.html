<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Needless to say, Curt was pretty surprised by this turn of events, but at the same time, he was pretty intrigued as well.   The 25 year-old programmer was something of an introvert; he wasn’t much for crowds or parties, and didn’t really care to be the center of attention.  Nor was he really the type to lead, or order people around.  He wasn’t sure why someone would send him something that would make anyone it shot loyal to him, if they were hoping it’d see much use.  He wasn’t sure he was ready to bear the responsibility of being the “master” of his local mailman (or mailvixen, now, he supposed), much less anyone else.<br />
<br />
But, on the other hand, he did have a secret interest in furries and transformation.  He’d written all sorts of stories of people, (including self-inserts) transforming into animals of all sorts, and had often fantasized about what it would be like to live in a world of walking, talking animals. Granted, he would have also wanted to be one himself; were it not for the fact that the gun apparently wouldn’t work on him, he would’ve tested it on himself, first.  But the idea of making most of that fantasy a reality almost tempted him to just go out on a little shooting spree. <br />
<br />
He set the gun on his kitchen table, contemplating what to do with it and his conflicting desires.  He looked over the bright-red painted raygun, touching a little button on the back.  He was taken aback as a holographic user interface suddenly came to life in front of him, a small handful of options appearing, such as the Maid/Nude and Adorable/Busty toggles mentioned in the note, as well as a few that hadn’t.<br />
<br />
“Hey Curt!  Did that Final Fantasy game you got for me come today?”<br />
<br />
Before Curt could continue his examination, he was interrupted by his “little” sister, Anna, entering the room.<br />
<br />
The 20 year old had been living with Curt for a about a year now.  Born with mild mental retardation, she had the mind of an eight year old in many respects, and as a result, had been unable to graduate high school, hold down a job, or truly take care of herself in the long term.  After their mother had become too sick to care for her, Curt had volunteered to take Anna in.  She was a handful at times, being far too trusting of strangers, and prone to not thinking through what she was doing, but at the same time, she was almost always eager to help her family out, and had a certain child-like innocence, as well.<br />
<br />
“Er- I’m afraid your game didn’t come today!”  Curt said, caught off guard.<br />
<br />
“Oh, this is new!  Looks pretty cool!  Where’d you get it?”  Anna said, looking intently at the gun.<br />
<br />
“This?  It came as a gift in the mail.  I don’t know who it’s from.”<br />
<br />
“That floating glowing part is pretty cool though!  Is it for a game?”<br />
<br />
“Well, no…  It…  Uh…”  Curt debated first if he should tell the truth,but figured that if the mailvixen ended up calling him master in front of Anna, the truth would be out anyway.  Next, he debated how he would explain said truth to her, given her lack of knowledge of furries.  “It’s turns anyone you zap with it into an animal girl.  You know, sort of like the ones in Zootopia.”<br />
<br />
Anna’s eyes went wide.  “Really?  Can you use it on me?  Make me into something really cute!”<br />
<br />
“I don’t really know if that’s a good idea…”  Curt muttered.  “You see, I don’t think there’s a way to turn you back once it’s happened, plus there’s other… side effects…”  Curt slowed down mid-sentence as he looked at the options, one in particular standing out; between the Adorable/Busty toggle and change-awareness check box, was a grayed-out checked box for “Autocorrect physical/mental health issues.”<br />
<br />
The wheels in Curt’s head began to turn.  Could he use this to help his sister finally be able to live a normal life?  But then again, it would also “make her greatest desire seeing his wants and need fulfilled.”  That wasn’t exactly a normal life, either.  Then again, in her current state, she was near-completely dependent on him anyway.  Would the “negative” aspect of the change really be that much different?  Then there was the potential awkwardness of having his sister always either be naked or dressed in a french maid outfit around him.  And the whole “Love you unconditionally” thing…  Then again, he remembered that the note said it didn’t include sexual favors…  Perhaps the unconditional love induced by the gun didn’t have to be sexual, or even romantic in nature, and if that was the case, then their relationship would be completely unchanged.<br />
<br />
“Curt?  Are you there?”  Anna’s voice snapped him back to reality.  “Are you gonna use that, or not?”<br />
<br />
Curt looked at the gun once more.  “You know what, Anna?  I think I will.”<br />
<br />
He started going through the settings.  First was species.  He pressed his finger to the holographic icon, prompting the message: “Think of the desired end-species, and the FTFRG will automatically adjust for it.”  And next to that was a checked box reading “Do not show me this message again.”  <br />
<br />
“Well that’s easy.”  Curt thought to himself.  “Now, let’s see, both of us like Pokemon…  Maybe I’ll make her into her favorite?”<br />
<br />
An error message promptly displayed.  “Even the otherworldly forces responsible for this item’s creation tremble at the sight of copyright lawyers.  Creatures with copyrights attached to them in this world may not be used.  We apologize for the inconvenience.”<br />
<br />
Curt frowned, and cleared the message, but kept going.  “Hey Anna, what kind of animal would you like to be?”<br />
<br />
“A cat.  They’re so soft and cute.”<br />
<br />
“What kind of cat?”<br />
<br />
She thought for a bit, then shrugged.  “Any kind of cat is good.”  <br />
<br />
Curt took a moment, trying to think of a good breed for her.  As he settled on Siamese, the option in the species blank was automatically filled by the words, “Siamese cat.” The Adorable/Busty toggle was set to “Adorable;” Anna had explicitly asked to look cute, after all.  Plus, giving his own sister a supermodel figure would’ve felt weird.  He flicked the “change awareness” out of its default “off” position, so she’d be able to appreciate her new form.  He left the autocorrect option checked.  While he was curious about the “reality distortion field,” the fact that it was apparently still in beta made him hesitant to try it on his sister.  Last was the nude/maid toggle.  Curt felt a bit awkward about applying either of these to his sister, but, thinking back to the mailvixen, her fur did seem to adequately hide anything naughty.  He settled on nude, and took aim.<br />
<br />
“Get ready Anna!”  He said, before pulling the trigger.  A streak of blue lightning flew from the tip of the ray gun, hitting Anna right in the chest.  She felt a strange warmth fill her, as cream-colored fur began to grow out all over her body, and her clothes seemed to slowly vanish.<br />
<br />
“It’s working!  I’m so fuzzy!”  Anna hugged herself, feeling the soft fur in her old fingers before they became a little thicker, and more paw like.  A brownish fur covered her hands, as retractable claws replaced her nails.  The fact that she was naked barely crossed her mind; she was a cute little kitty, there was nothing to be ashamed of.<br />
<br />
Her body mass shifted subtly, giving her a slender, lithe build.  She found herself standing tip-toe for a moment, before her feet began to shift, making digitigrade walking more natural for her.  Anna giddily lifted up a foot, wiggling her toes a little before they curled up into paws.  “Aww!  Just look at this!”  She rubbed the bottom of her foot as the soft, leathery pads formed on them.<br />
<br />
She shivered a little as she felt a tugging sensation behind her.  She turned her head back, watching as a long, brown-furred, feline tail grew out and gently swished behind her.  She reached back and stroked her new appendage with a grin.<br />
<br />
Finally, she felt her head being covered in fur, gradually turning from cream to brown as it approached her face and ears as well.  Sounds around her became more clear as hear ears stretched wider, and moved toward the top of her head.  With barely a thought, she could flick them one way or another to pick up on practically any sound.  There was a pressure in her jaws and nose as they pressed out into a small snout, her nose turning a dark color as it became more sensitive, and whiskers grew alongside it.  She felt her teeth sharpen, becoming cute little fangs, while her tongue became rough.  Her eyes grew a little larger to enhance the cute look, turning a deep blue, while her pupils became narrow.<br />
<br />
“This is amazing!”  Anna cheered, turning every which way to examine her new form.  “I’m so cute and fuzzy and, and-”  Curt nearly fell over as she suddenly, and effortlessly did a cartwheel, crouched to the floor, and pounced him to give him a big hug.  “Thank you so much!  I almost wanna call you my master now to pay you back, but I get the feeling you just want to keep being called ‘Curt,’ and maybe ‘big brother,’ every now and then, right?”<br />
<br />
“Y-yes!”  Curt nodded, hugging her back.  Even though it had worked before, Curt was still a little shocked to see it happen again, but he couldn’t say he disliked the results.  While he was initially worried about the awkwardness of his sister going around naked 24/7, after the change, he couldn’t really find himself bothered by it either.  If anything, it just seemed to highlight his sister’s carefree, innocent nature, now.  <br />
<br />
 As she finally let him go, Curt remembered the reason he had even considered using the ray gun on her in the first place.  He wanted to make sure that that part was working as well as the rest.  “Hey Anna, would you mind doing something for me?”<br />
<br />
“After this?  Anything!”<br />
<br />
Curt grabbed a pen and a nearby notepad, and wrote a few algebra problems on it.  “Could you try to solve these?”<br />
<br />
Anna looked down with a slight frown.  Curt almost felt sorry he asked, seeing the energy go out of her.  “You know I’m not that good at math…  But sure, it’s the least I could do.”  She sat down at the table and took the pen from Curt, biting the tip as she looked at it.  Curt watched intently as she hesitantly started writing out the solution to the first problem.  However, as she wrote it out, bit by bit, (with every step being correct, Curt noted mentally) her countenance slowly changed, her eyes widening as she suddenly realized how much simpler it all seemed now.  After a minute, she slipped the completed problems over to her brother.<br />
<br />
“How’d I do?”<br />
<br />
“They’re right.  Each and every one!  Congratulations!”  He hugged her as the energy returned to her eyes again.  “You’re better than you think you are!”<br />
<br />
He couldn’t believe it!  It really worked.  Anna was happier than Curt had ever remembered seeing her, and she was very much the upbeat type already.  Perhaps using the Furry Transformation Ray Gun wouldn’t really be that bad…  Though one more thing did come to mind he wanted to take care of quickly before using it more.<br />
<br />
“Oh, by the way, Anna, from here on out, any orders I give you can be considered suggestions, alright?  You can use your own judgement to decide if you think they’re a good idea, like any normal person would.”  He was a little hesitant to make a command like this.  If there was anything he knew from all the TF stories he read, it was that trying to undo one part of a change alone could sometimes have unintended consequences.  Plus, for all he knew, despite those transformed’s “greatest desire” being “to see his needs and wants fulfilled” they might still have the capacity to say no anyway, if they felt it would be harmful or otherwise wrong, and that would just make his command here redundant.<br />
<br />
Anna gave him a side-look, and smiled.  “Whatever you say, big brother.”  She got up and gave him another hug.  “Just let me know if you go using that again!  I wanna see what other kinds of animals you might make!”<br />
<br />
Curt looked down at the gun in his hands.  He definitely felt like using it again, after his sister had had such a positive result…  Plus, he had a few friends in the furry fandom who would practically beg for an opportunity like this (he knew he certainly would).  Maybe he could give them a little surprise gift…  Then again…  Changing a few strangers to make the world a more interesting place could be fun too…  Or he could do one along the way to doing the other…</p>
