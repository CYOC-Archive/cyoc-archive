<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sun began to set on the winter night as they arrived. A vast ice-glittering lake streached out before them, catching the last amber light of day. Far across the water rose a trio of small, but closely packed islands. Each was a tiny mountain silhuetted atop the frozen water.<br />
<br />
Matt parked the car near a dock and picked up his tightly bound, newly adoptert son. There was no worry that they&#39;d be seen here. Hardly anyone lived in these remote mountains, though tourists often traveled through them on road trips, taking the scenic rout. Though that was less common in winter.<br />
<br />
Kai moaned dreamily onto his penis gag, sucking on it contentedly as the ASMR ear licking track sent shivers down his spine, while his chastity cage forbade him even the slightest erection.<br />
<br />
The sound of a deep ear slurp made him thrust in vain as his buttplug hummed for a moment. Hours of bondage and edging and ASMR hypnosis tracks had melted away any rational thought in his brain. He&#39;d barely even registered that the car had stopped. And when his blindfold was finally removed, he felt completely disorientated for a few seconds.<br />
<br />
Kai felt a sense of loss as his gag was removed next, though his jaw was greatful for the relief. The audio fell to stillness as the earpods were removed next. Finally, the blanket wrapping him up so snug was pulled off. He&#39;d been really warm, and almost melting in that cocoon, and the fridges air felt almost pleasent to his cooked body. At least for now. <br />
<br />
Lastly his arms were untied, and he was pleased barefoot and naked onto the deep snow covered ground.<br />
<br />
It was hard to see exactly where the lake began, thanks to the snow, but then wind across the smooth surface had cleared away most of it further in.<br />
<br />
Matt took Kai by the hand and lead him across the docks and to a large boat. Once inside, Matt started up the engine and the thin ice that had formed on the lake surface crackled and snapped.<br />
<br />
Wind picked up as they drove into the open lake and picked up speed. Kai hugged his naked body and began to shiver.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um...&quot; He didn&#39;t know how his new father would want him to adress him. But there was one word he&#39;d long wanted to use. He took a chance and nervously tried, &quot;Daddy?&quot; Matt smiled warmly at him. Just that helped fill Kai with a warm feeling. Though it only stalled his shivering.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Kai?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um... I&#39;m g... getting really c... cold...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come here,&quot; Matt invited, opening up his own jacket and holding out his free arm for a hug. Kai hurriedly embrased his new father. Matt pulled up his own sweater, then lowered it over Kai that the boy was inside the garment. A bare, Harry chest pressed against Kai under the sweater. Matt scooped up his new son inside the sweater, letting Kai&#39;s head poke up from the turtle neck. At some point, Matt had changed out of the fine suit and into something warmer. He felt his boy shiver and cling to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you worry your sweet head about a thing. See those islands we&#39;re heading for? Those are your new home from now on. You see, they&#39;re connected to each other by bridge, and feature beautiful nature and naturally occurring hot springs that have some... Interesting properties. We&#39;ll have you warmed up in no time. In fact, these islands are a resort that I own. A resort catering to a specific clientele. Especially now that we have you here...&quot; Kai didn&#39;t understand what his daddy had meant with that criptic comment. Though he was more distracted with his daddy&#39;s muskulatur, warm body though. He hugged his daddy tight, though his arms could hardly even reach all the way around that barrel torsow.<br />
<br />
As the boat arrived, Kai was extracted from the warm sweater. Already he felt the bitting cold return. His daddy described to test his new son&#39;s obedience.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kai, sweete,&quot; he said soothingly, taking Kai ny the wrist and stopping him from running across the frozen beach to the warm looking reception ahead of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y...yes... Daddy...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know what you are?&quot; Kai wondered if this was a test. After hours of hypnosis drilling the answer into him again and again, he answered eagerly without hesitation, though his teeth chattered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m y...your s...slave s...son, Dad...dy!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy. But do you mean it? Or are those just empty words?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;N...no. I m...mean it! I&#39;m y...your slave...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what do slaves do?&quot;<br />
<br />
*T...they... I mean... W...we p....pleasure m....men and ob...bey w...without question.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly. You&#39;re a quick learner.&quot; He kissed the stunned boy on the lips and smiled at how red Kai because. His ears and cheeks were already flush from the cold, but now even more so. The next command though made his stomach drop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jump into the lake.&quot; Kai&#39;s eyes widened, and he nearly yelped a &quot;why!?&quot; Or a &quot; please!&quot; but stopped himself just in time. Slaves didn&#39;t question. He had to prove that he was a good slave. He was going to make his Daddy proud!<br />
<br />
Before he could think about it and chicken out, he jumped off the edge of the boat and plunged into the icy lake. Though the boat had just broken this ice, a fresh thin layer had already begun to form on the surface. Kai broke through it and fully submerged. He came up gasping for air, or trying to. He failed to breathe. His body was in shock from the cold.<br />
<br />
Matt grabbed him then and easily pulled him out of the water. He wore a proud smile as he watched the shivering boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so proud of you. Time to reward you with a nice warm hot spring bath.&quot; He carried the barely concious boy to the entrance of the private gay resort.</p>
