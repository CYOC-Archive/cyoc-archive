<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I think we should chance it and go back to my place” Michael said after he came to a decision. <br />
<br />
“You sure that’s a good idea?” Freddy asked. “Won’t your father be mad at us if I show up…and so late?”<br />
<br />
“He’ll deal with it. He needs to learn to deal with it. You’re my boyfriend and you’re not going anywhere.”<br />
<br />
Freddy smiled as Michael went in for a hug. The two embraced as Diya began to look impatiently at them.<br />
<br />
“I’d love to savor the tenderness between you” Diya interrupted “but it’s almost 1 AM and my parents are going to expect me to be asleep soon.”<br />
<br />
“Right, sorry Diya” Michael acknowledged as he gathered his things to leave. <br />
<br />
Michael made his way out the door before Freddy hesitated. <br />
<br />
“Diya?” Freddy asked quietly. <br />
<br />
“Yes, Freddy” she responded. <br />
<br />
“I…uh.”<br />
<br />
Freddy hesitated for a moment as Diya looked at him, unsure of what he wanted to say to her. <br />
<br />
“I….want to thank you for helping me out on Wednesday. I should have come out and said that earlier.”<br />
<br />
“You did, but you’re welcome, Freddy. I’m happy I was able to help. I’m even happier that I didn’t get in any trouble for what I did to help you guys out.”<br />
<br />
“And….”<br />
<br />
Freddy paused before he continued. <br />
<br />
“And I want to say that I’m sorry for not thinking it through before accusing you of sabotaging the fire alarm system so publicly.”<br />
<br />
Diya smiled as she appreciated Freddy’s sincerity in showing his remorse. <br />
<br />
“I mean…” Freddy went on to say “you did hack the fire alarm system after all, so I was right about that…”<br />
<br />
Diya began to frown. <br />
<br />
“But…” he further added “I shouldn’t have said it in the cafeteria at that time. And I shouldn’t have said it so loudly, knowing that people were listening in on our conversation. And for that, I’m sorry.”<br />
<br />
“Freddy….” Diya replied, hesitant of whether to embrace him or show some other way to express her appreciation. <br />
<br />
Freddy smiled as he nodded and then began to leave her room. Diya thought that, underneath his dopy exterior and severe lack of impulse control was a sweet and caring man who wasn’t like the other kids in his social circle. If it weren’t for the social divisions that separated them, she could even envision herself being friends with him. He was a good natured person, she determined, and Michael was lucky to have him. <br />
<br />
Freddy left Diya’s room as he looked down to see Michael standing at the bottom of the staircase. <br />
<br />
“They’re asleep” Michael quietly whispered. “Let’s get out of here quietly.”<br />
<br />
“Ok” Freddy replied, trying to mind his volume. <br />
<br />
Freddy started to run before Michael sushed him. Feeling embarrassed, Freddy quickly changed his movements to a mere crawl as he gently eased himself down the remainder of the steps. When he landed at the bottom of the stairs, Michael rubbed his back as the two of them quietly made their way out of Diya’s house, careful to close the door behind them gently. <br />
<br />
When they got onto the street, Michael began to walk in a rapid pace as Freddy sought to keep up with him. <br />
<br />
“Michael?” Freddy asked. <br />
<br />
“Yes, Freddy?” he responded, trying to keep a good pace as they made their way to his house. <br />
<br />
“Are you sure this is a good idea? I mean, leaving me alone in Sofya’s house? Are you sure there isn’t another way of getting this information from her father?”<br />
<br />
“I’m positive. Freddy.”<br />
<br />
Michael stopped and Freddy did too, unsure of why they paused their tracks.<br />
<br />
“Freddy, is this about having to see your friends in dog form tomorrow night?”<br />
<br />
Freddy looked down at the ground for a moment before he looked up to Michael again.<br />
<br />
“Yes” he confessed. <br />
<br />
“Freddy….”<br />
<br />
“I’m just really nervous, that’s all. I don’t want to admit it to myself, but I’m afraid, Michael. I’m afraid you might be right and I don’t know how I’m going to handle myself if I hear them talking badly about me when they think I’m not there.”<br />
<br />
“Freddy…”<br />
<br />
“I just don’t know if I can do this, Michael.”<br />
<br />
“You have to, Freddy. If you want to beat this curse, then this is the fastest and most sound way to do it.”<br />
<br />
Freddy sighed as he got closer to Michael. <br />
<br />
“I guess you’re right” he resigned himself to say. “But I’m not looking forward to this.”<br />
<br />
“It’s like going to the dentist, Freddy. No one wants to do it, but it’s important and then when it’s all over, you’ll feel better having gotten it out of the way.”<br />
<br />
Freddy smiled as he went to kiss Michael on the cheek. Michael rubbed Freddy’s head as they briefly cuddled before separating and continuing on to Michael’s house. When they arrived, they saw that a light was on in the living room.<br />
<br />
“Uh oh” Michael thought to himself as they approached the house. “That’s not good.”<br />
<br />
“Michael? Freddy asked. “Does the fact that the light is on in the living room mean that your father is up?”<br />
<br />
“Probably, Freddy” he responded.<br />
<br />
The two cautiously made their way to the door as Michael grabbed a key from his backpack. Before Michael could go to put it into the lock to turn it, the door opened as they looked up to see Michael’s father staring at them angrily.<br />
<br />
“Michael” his father said in a gruff tone. “Do you know what time it is?”<br />
<br />
“Uh” Michael responded nervously. “It’s a little after 1.”<br />
<br />
“Michael, where have you been?”<br />
<br />
“Uh”<br />
<br />
“I’ve been helping Michael out” Freddy responded, hoping to help his boyfriend out of the pickle he got himself into. “He called me this evening saying he was having a hard time getting rid of that dog and I came out to assist him. It was really difficult to get rid of it. It wouldn’t go away. We lost track of time trying to do get rid of it, so it seemed like no time had passed when, really, hours went by. We finally got it several miles away from here to leave the dog alone, so he shouldn’t be coming back here anytime soon.”<br />
<br />
“Wow Freddy” Michael thought to himself, proud that his boyfriend had come up with such a convincing lie on the spot. “Good going.”<br />
<br />
“Well” Michael’s father responded “I’m willing to let you off the hook on this, Michael, as it was important that that dog be put as far away as possible. But be warned, if that dog finds its way back into this house, you’re grounded for a week. Understand?”<br />
<br />
“Yes dad” he responded, looking down at his feet, embarrassed by the scolding. <br />
<br />
“Now get to bed. It’s way past your bedtime.”<br />
<br />
“Dad?” Michael asked cautiously. “Freddy’s having a hard time at home right now. Do you mind if he stays over tonight?”<br />
<br />
“Michael, I’d rather he not be here. I don’t want you two fooling around in my house.”<br />
<br />
“But dad, we’re not going to fool around. We just want to get to sleep.”<br />
<br />
“Michael, let’s reverse the situation here for a second.” <br />
<br />
His father paused before remembering that the door was still open and the boys were still standing outside. <br />
<br />
“Get in here” his father ordered sternly, grabbing Michael to pull him in as Freddy followed behind him. <br />
<br />
Michael’s father closed and locked the door before he turned to them. <br />
<br />
“Michael” he continued. “Let’s say that you weren’t a queer.”<br />
<br />
“Dad” Michael responded with audible hurt in his voice. “Please don’t say that word. It’s not very nice.”<br />
<br />
“Michael, I don’t want to get into a conversation about your fucking a dude right now. It’s too late for that. I just want to say that if Freddy were a girl like a Felicity or a Frederica, you think I would be ok with letting her sleep over here with you?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t see why not” Freddy replied. “If they were out late and she was tired, I don’t see why you wouldn’t let her sleep on the couch or something.”<br />
<br />
“Freddy” Michael’s father replied. “I want to talk to you about something. Can we have a seat, please?”<br />
<br />
“Shouldn’t we be going to bed now?” Michael asked. <br />
<br />
“Do you want to be grounded?” his father asked sternly. <br />
<br />
“No” he answered answered back quietly. <br />
<br />
“Then sit.”<br />
<br />
The boys made their way with Michael’s father to a couch in the living room as they sat. Michael and Freddy sat next to each other while Michael’s father sat across from them in a recliner.<br />
<br />
“Freddy” Michael’s father went on to say “I have to talk to you about something.”<br />
<br />
Freddy gulped, unsure of what Michael’s father wanted to say to him. Although a part of him felt angry about the way that he had been treating Michael, his boyfriend, especially after they came out as a couple, there was a stronger part that felt nervous over what seemed to be like a coming reprimand. He wasn’t looking forward to this. <br />
<br />
“Freddy. I have to admit to you…and Michael, that I am not really happy with your relationship. I admit it. I have been distant between the two of you because you are gay. I was raised Catholic and with my religious beliefs what they are, it’s been difficult for me to reconcile the fact that you are engaging in sodomy with the fact that you are my son’s boyfriend and that you seem to love him very much. It’s been hard for me to process all of this and, I admit, I’ve been colder to you than I should be.”<br />
<br />
Freddy looked on at Michael’s father with concern, while Michael put his head down in his lap, unable to handle this as he began to quietly sob. <br />
<br />
“But in my discomfort” Michael’s father continued “I forgot about the fact that, although my beliefs are what they are, it doesn’t change the fact that Michael is my son and that I love him very much.”<br />
<br />
Michael looked up to his father, red in the face and with tears rolling down his eyes. <br />
<br />
“I may not approve of what you’re doing, but I still love you. Everyone in this world sins, but that doesn’t mean that they aren’t entitled to love. You’re my son…my only son. I don’t want to drive you away from me. It would kill me if I lost you, Michael. I don’t know how I would handle myself if I lost you because of how I feel about your sexuality. So, I want to try to find a way to make this work.”<br />
<br />
Michael continued to cry as his father looked at him sympathetically. Freddy felt bad for his boyfriend, unsure of how sensitive Michael’s father was to his feelings. He also didn’t think they should be discussing this right now. <br />
<br />
“Michael” his father continued. “I want to try to get to know your boyfriend. He means so much to you, but it’s going to take me some time to work through my feelings about what you two are doing together. Your mother is right. I need to see a therapist and next week, I’m going to begin seeing one. I have issues that I need to work through, admittedly beyond just your sexual relationship, and I want to try to talk to someone about them. I want to be a good father to you again, Michael. You deserve that.”<br />
<br />
Michael continued to sob as his father got up and sat next to him on the other side of the couch. He placed a sympathetic hand on one shoulder, while Freddy placed a hand on the other. <br />
<br />
“Which is why it’s important that Freddy stop ogling me when he’s over here” his father continued. <br />
<br />
Michael stopped crying as he looked at his father, confused by this revelation. Freddy looked at him as well, confused by what he was suggesting. He did ogle at Michael’s father, but he didn’t think that he was being so obvious or that his father had noticed. This confirmed that Freddy wasn’t as discrete as he thought he was being. <br />
<br />
“Freddy” Michael’s father said as he addressed him. “I know you think that you’re being discrete when you stare at me when you’re over here, but you’re not. I notice you looking at me sexually and staring at my hairy chest when I’m wearing a crew cut tee shirt or if I walk around without a shirt on. It makes me very uncomfortable that, in my own home, I feel like I’m being eyed up like a piece of meat. It’s bad enough that I’m still dealing with my feelings about your relationship with my son. This makes it harder to do.”<br />
<br />
“Freddy” Michael said to him, unhappy with hearing about this.<br />
<br />
“So” his father continued “can you try to keep your staring under control, please? It would make me feel better and make it much easier for me to deal with all of this if you would promise me that you’ll do that from now on.”<br />
<br />
Freddy sat for a moment in silence. Although it would be difficult for him to control his staring, considering that Michael’s father was as sexy as he was, he knew that he wanted to help Michael repair his relationship with his father. If this would help, in any way, in working towards that, then he was happy, eager even, to oblige. <br />
<br />
“Yes, Mr. Scavolini” Freddy replied quietly, after taking a moment to think.<br />
<br />
“Thank you, Freddy” Michael’s father said as he got up to head up to bed. “Oh, and Michael?”<br />
<br />
Michael looked up to his father. <br />
<br />
“You’re not to sleep in the same bed with each other. Understand?”<br />
<br />
“But, dad….”<br />
<br />
“Michael!” his father hissed. “That’s an order.”<br />
<br />
“Yes dad” Michael replied as he looked down into his lap.<br />
<br />
“Good night, son. Try not to make too much noise coming upstairs. Good night, Freddy.”<br />
<br />
“Good night” Freddy replied. <br />
<br />
Michael’s father nodded as he quietly made his way up to his room. After a moment, Michael got up to head upstairs as Freddy followed him. Freddy could tell that Michael was still very upset about the conversation with his father. He wanted to broach the topic with him, but it was late and he wanted to go to sleep. He was sure that Michael did as well. <br />
<br />
When they made their way up to Michael’s room, Freddy looked down to the floor. <br />
<br />
“Guess I ought to get used to this, huh?” Freddy said quietly as Michael went to gather his own things for a quick shower. “I’ll be doing it a lot more if I can’t break this curse.”<br />
<br />
“Freddy” Michael said with concern in his voice, as he stripped off his shirt and put it in a basket. He shucked off his pants and underwear into it as well. He walked over to his boyfriend, butt naked, as he put a hand on his shoulder. <br />
<br />
“Do you boys need this? a voice asked as they looked up to see Michael’s mother standing in the doorway.<br />
<br />
Michael yelped as he moved behind Freddy’s back, uncomfortable being naked in her presence. Freddy could feel a semi erect penis poking at his butt. He liked it. He liked that Michael was still turned on by him.<br />
<br />
“Oh sorry” his mother continued. “I just thought Freddy might want this.”<br />
<br />
Freddy and Michael noticed an inflated air mattress in her hands, relieved that Freddy would have something to sleep on tonight besides a cold, hard floor. <br />
<br />
“Thanks, Irene” Freddy replied. <br />
<br />
Freddy was on an informal basis with Michael’s mother. Michael’s father insisted on a more formal relationship. <br />
<br />
“You’re welcome, Freddy. I’ll just leave this here for you, along with a blanket and some pillows.”<br />
<br />
Michael’s mother placed the items on the floor and then moved to leave. <br />
<br />
“Your father and I will be leaving early tomorrow and won’t be back until late. Try not to sleep in all day, ok Michael?”<br />
<br />
“Sure mom” he replied. “Good night.”<br />
<br />
Michael’s mother nodded as she walked out to head back into her room. Remembering his unclothed state, Michael left to head for the bathroom to take a shower as Freddy stood for a moment in silence. He wanted to get another outfit, but he knew that, since he’d be back to being on all fours again soon anyway, it wasn’t worth it to get one right now. Instead, he stripped off his dirty and smelly clothes and put them in a separate pile on the floor. He thought of putting them in Michael’s basket, but he’d wait to ask him about it in the morning. <br />
<br />
When Michael was done with his shower, he came back into the room and tossed Freddy a towel, indicating that he needed to take one as well. Freddy went to the bathroom to wash up, thankful that he was removing the horrible scent of dog that permeated all over his body. He thoroughly scrubbed over his naked body with a bar of soap, removing the dirt and debris that accumulated on his person. When he was done, he shut off the shower, dried off and then made his way back to Michael’s room with a towel clung around his waist. Michael was already under his covers fully dressed in pajamas when he turned on his side to look up at his boyfriend’s nearly naked appearance standing before him. This turned Michael on very much. He was looking forward to having sex with him again soon. Little did he know that it wouldn’t be that far from that moment.<br />
<br />
“Michael?” Freddy asked quietly after a minute of staring at him in his near nude condition.<br />
<br />
“Yes, Freddy?” he replied. <br />
<br />
“Do you have any PJ’s for me to wear?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, sure. Hold on.”<br />
<br />
Michael got up from bed to look through a drawer. After digging through to the bottom, he pulled up an old t-shirt and a baggy pair of boxers. <br />
<br />
“This is too big for me, but it should fit snug on you.”<br />
<br />
Michael tossed Freddy the clothes and he proceeded to put them on. Freddy made his way to the air mattress as Michael got back into his bed. The air mattress wasn’t so comfortable for Freddy, so he had a hard time going to sleep. About an hour later, still deep into the night, feeling a sense of restlessness, Freddy got up from the mattress on the floor to stand over Michael’s bed. He leaned into his sleeping boyfriend&#39;s ear and quietly whispered. <br />
<br />
“Michael.”<br />
<br />
“Huh, Freddy?” he responded, stirring in bed, sounding groggy due to his interrupted sleep. <br />
<br />
“Michael, I want to have sex with you tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
“What? Freddy, you’re going to be a dog tomorrow. We don’t have time for that.”<br />
<br />
“Michael, your parents said they won’t be back all day tomorrow. I’ve been dying to fuck you all week. Ever since you gave me…or rather, Fido, head a few days ago, it’s all I’ve been able to think about when we’re not working on breaking this curse.”<br />
<br />
“Freddy, I don’t think it’s such a good idea.”<br />
<br />
“Michael, this may be the only opportunity I’ll ever get to try fucking you as a dog. And it may be the only opportunity you’ll ever have to be fucked by a dog. Don’t you think we should take advantage of it before we miss it forever?”<br />
<br />
“I could live not having experienced it, Freddy.”<br />
<br />
“Michael…”<br />
<br />
“Freddy…”<br />
<br />
Michael got up from laid down position and sat at the edge of his bed. Freddy sat down next to him.<br />
<br />
“Freddy” he continued. “Being fucked by a dog is an incredibly painful experience. Sure, you’ll love having my tight asshole around that big thing swinging between your legs, but it’s going to hurt like hell for me. It&#39;s going to be incredibly painful, especially when that knot expands and you’re tied to me like a bitch in heat. I don’t know if I’ll be able to take all that pain.”<br />
<br />
“Come on, Michael. I know you’ve been feeling sour since you learned that I fucked those two dogs this week. Take it as me making it up to you. I really want to fuck you so bad.”<br />
<br />
Freddy paused before he continued. <br />
<br />
“And Fido does too.”<br />
<br />
“Freddy…”<br />
<br />
“It’s like ever since I came in your mouth, the part of me that’s still a dog has wanted to breed you and make you his bitch. It’s like this internal animalistic desire to mate with you. You give great head and great hand jobs. Your ass will probably feel amazing as well. Please, Michael. Please let me do it before I go over to Sofya’s tomorrow. You know I&#39;m already feeling on edge about it. It would make me feel a lot better if you let me have this release before I go.”<br />
<br />
Michael paused to think for a moment as Freddy stared at him, with a look of begging in his eyes. <br />
<br />
“Freddy” he finally responded. “I’ll have to think about it.”<br />
<br />
“Let me know in the morning what you decide. But just so we’re ready to go in case you say yes….”<br />
<br />
Freddy went to Michael’s desk drawer and pulled out a large, black dildo. He motioned Michael to scooch over to pull down his pants as his rear became exposed.<br />
<br />
“You’re going to want to keep this in overnight” Freddy continued. “Just so we can make this as comfortable and pain free for you as possible. And if you don’t want to do it, then it’ll just mean you’ll have a looser asshole for the next time I fuck you as a human.”<br />
<br />
“Ok, Freddy.”<br />
<br />
Freddy gently inserted the dildo into Michael’s asshole. Michael whimpered and moaned as it slowly made its way up his rear end. When it was firmly resting at his butt cheeks, Freddy pulled Michael’s underwear and pants back up and went over to give him a kiss on the lips. <br />
<br />
“Good night, Michael.”<br />
<br />
“Good night, Freddy.”<br />
<br />
Freddy went to go back down to the air mattress before Michael called to him again. He looked up to see a smile on Michael’s face. <br />
<br />
“I love you.”<br />
<br />
A tear rolled down Freddy’s face as he got up again to kiss Michael on the lips. <br />
<br />
“I love you, too” he replied. “I love you so much.”<br />
<br />
Michael nodded with a tear rolling down his cheek. Freddy made his way back down to the air mattress once more as they both drifted off to sleep; tired from the long day that the two of them had spent together. If they thought this day was action packed, the coming weekend would be one of the ages. <br />
<br />
The next morning…..</p>
