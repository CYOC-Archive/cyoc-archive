<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sunbathing with Terry, huh? For some reason, that was a tempting idea for Danny, but something just felt missing. &quot;Hmmm, I&#39;m not sure, but either way, I should probably refill my water.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, gotta stay hydrated. Come on, let me show you in.&quot; After he said that, Terry opened the front door of his house and led Danny in. Oh, nice house, modern but homely. Anyway, once they reached the kitchen, Danny decided it was a good idea to have some small talk.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, by the way, where&#39;s Gabe?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gabe? I don&#39;t know. Probably at home if I had to guess.&quot; Oh, duh! Gabe and Terry might have been best friends, but that doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re attached to the hip. Guess he either has to catch both of them at school or invite both of them somewhere. Hmmm, thinking back to Terry sunbathing got the wheels turning in his scheming head.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see. Well, I&#39;m interested in sunbathing, but I should probably get back to my jog. If you really want to show off how sexy we are, why don&#39;t we meet at the pool on Ranch Avenue?&quot; Terry looked a bit confused on why Danny suggested that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? The pool on Ranch Avenue? But why can&#39;t we use your pool?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, sunbathing in front of your house seems fun, but the amount of attention we&#39;ll get seems a bit random. That&#39;s why we&#39;ll go to the public pool so there will be lots of eyes on us and our hot bods. Besides, our pool party got canceled last time, so we can call Gabe and have our party there. So what do you say? Sounds like a good plan?&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;Oh totally, bro, that&#39;s sounds sick! I&#39;m in! I&#39;ll call Gabe and a few other people to join us. It will be a party of sexy, I&#39;m telling ya!&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny laughed, thankful that Terry didn&#39;t decline. Afterward, Danny thanked Terry for the refill and went off to continue his jog.<br />
<br />
-------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re going to the public pool tomorrow? Any reason why you&#39;re not using our pool?&quot; Jin asked as the two were cleaning up after dinner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh, it&#39;s just nice to get out of the house now and again. Plus, I get to show off my bod to the public.&quot; Danny flexed his arm as he responded. It caused Jin to sigh and shake his head, although he was playfully smiling while he did this. &quot;Anyway, you want to join? The more, the merrier.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, my friends are still sick so, it&#39;s not like I have anything else better to do. Oh! My show&#39;s about to start.&quot; Jin quickly finished cleaning up and ran past their Dad as he was walking into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you and Jin are going to the public pool tomorrow, huh? Is something wrong with our pool?&quot; Danny&#39;s Dad asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the third time someone asked me that, Dad.&quot; Danny was getting a bit annoyed, but he understood why everyone was asking that question. Heck, even he would ask. &quot;Just hanging out with a bunch of friends, and I didn&#39;t want to disturb you while you&#39;re at home. Unless you want to come to the pool and hang out with a bunch of loud and immature teenagers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hehe.&quot; Danny&#39;s father chuckled, &quot;Ah no, I&#39;m good, thanks. You don&#39;t need me ruining all your fun. Just make sure to do your homework, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, Dad.&quot; After Danny finished cleaning up, he went to his room and immediately went on to the Chonovic. He&#39;d noticed his father looked down at his gut when he invited him to the pool. It seems like he was a bit self-conscious of that. Well, nothing a few clicks on the Chronovic can&#39;t fix. Danny knew that he already had too many transformations to keep track up, but one smaller one wouldn&#39;t hurt. He was just going to lower his father&#39;s body fat percentage to, uh, let&#39;s go with 7%. As for duration, let&#39;s make it last for five days. If that was too fast, he could always pause it for a few days.<br />
<br />
Geez, by the time Danny is done, the Asian Adonis will have an Adonis family. Anyway, that was enough time transforming people now it was time to do his homework and get ready for tomorrow.<br />
<br />
-------------------<br />
<br />
The next day Danny and Jin arrived at the pool and were surprised to see the crowd there. Did Terry invite all of them, or did they just come to the pool because of the heat? Probably the latter if they had to guess.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it was time to give the people what they want. So, Danny ripped off his shirt to properly show off his body. Jin did the same, and Danny was pleasantly surprised to see that Jin now had some nice pecs and abs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looking good, bro!&quot; Danny said. Afterward, Danny left Jin to his own devices to find where Terry and Gabe were. It took a while because Danny almost didn&#39;t recognize them. They have yet again gotten thinner and now distinctly looked at least half Asian. Very nice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, guys. Whoa, did you invited all these people, Terry?&quot; Danny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, I only invited a handful of people, but as you said, the more, the merrier! Not to mention more guy-,er, people to see how hot we are,&quot; Terry blinked in surprise when he processed what he just said, but he quickly pretended that he didn&#39;t just say that. &quot;So, come on, let&#39;s jump on into the fun!&quot;<br />
<br />
After Terry said that, he literally jumped into the pool. Gabe just shrugged and joined his friend in jumping into the pool as well. Danny was about to take the plunge as well, but he suddenly heard a familiar voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, I didn&#39;t expect you to be here, Danny.&quot; Danny turned around and instantly grimaced when he saw who the voice belonged to.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing here, Sasha?&quot; Danny asked while trying to hold back his anger as to not make a scene.<br />
<br />
&quot;What. I can&#39;t go to the pool when I feel like? I just wanted to see how you were doing without me.&quot; Sasha&#39;s words may have been sweet, but her face clearly showed how snide they actually were.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was doing great until you showed up.&quot; Danny tried to pretend to smile, but it was obvious that he was seething underneath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, missed what we used to have? Well, I don&#39;t. I have someone way hotter than you now. Sayonara, Danny.&quot; After saying that, Sasha turned around and headed towards another man. Danny recognized it was Tristan, the bulky water polo player. Well, he won&#39;t be so bulky anymore once Sasha was done with him. Man, and here he thought the water polo team just had bad aim when he got hit with a ball the other day.<br />
<br />
Geez, Danny couldn&#39;t believe Sasha. She couldn&#39;t even remember or didn&#39;t care that he was Chinese, not Japanese. What did he even see in her... Oh wait, he dated her because she was hot. He really needed to choose who he dated more carefully. Danny took a deep breath in an attempt to calm down. Don&#39;t let her get in your head, Danny told himself. Soon she&#39;ll have to watch as all her boy-toys dwindle away and leave her. Then she&#39;ll come crawling back to you and can just laugh in her face when that happens. Ahh, but that&#39;s still was a while away. Right now, it was time to show off at the pool and do some more observing to unfolding transformations before him.</p>
