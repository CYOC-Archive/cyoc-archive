<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Darren&#39;s relationship issues would need to wait. After discovering Crustal was an awakened fairy, the Fae wished to meet the girl. Darren and his friends now found themselves preparing to venture into another world.<br />
<br />
&quot;So why are you staying behind Ms. Yuriko,&quot; Darren asked. Yuriko gave the teen a warm smile as she was finishing her preparation. &quot;This will be your first time venturing into the world of the Fae,&quot; Yuriko stated. &quot;It&#39;s probably the safest of the magical worlds. Therefore I want you to go yourself. As the Catalyst you will find that you will act as the ambassador to other worlds.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So Darren&#39;s not just changing this world hes changing other worlds as well,&quot; Steph asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sort of,&quot; Yuriko stated. &quot;You see Catalysts have a nasty habit of attracting enemies. In order to fulfill your vision, you&#39;ll need help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Two things,&quot; Hannah stated as she now eyed Yuriko. &quot;One what are the Fae like? And two, why not start with the Dragons or Kitsune? We&#39;ve already met them so why not visit?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is because we know the Dragons and Kitsune so well that we do not visit,&quot; Yuriko said. &quot;They are already strong allies. The Fae, well, we are friendly with them but our relationship could be closer. In all the years I&#39;ve dealt with Catalysts, the Fae always seemed to be on the back burner. Considering Crystal&#39;s friendship with Darren, I believe they will become a more prominent ally. Besides, I think they may have information on the Normal that might be useful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren nodded, preparing himself as Yuriko now began to open a portal. As the ancient wizard now wished them luck, the group of teens and their Soul Drive companion stepped through.<br />
<br />
Darren and his friends blinked, adjusting to the bright sun that illuminated the area. As he slowly scanned the area, he took in his surroundings. <br />
<br />
The group found themselves in a forest clearing, lush green trees stretching far into the sky, while flowers, mushrooms and other small plants spread out as far as the eye could see. As Darren looked closer, he could see small homes set into the various trees and bushes connected by small wooden walls ways.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its so pretty,&quot; Crystal whispered. &quot;And green! It...it looks like something out of a dream.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose,&quot; Steph shrugged. &quot;I&#39;ve never been one for the outdoors though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before anyone could answer Steph, a small figure darted in front of the group suspended by gossamer wings. &quot;Hi you must be Yuriko&#39;s students. I&#39;m Mina.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren and the others now introduced themselves, smiling politely at the fairy. &quot;This place is beautiful,&quot; Crystal said in awe. &quot;Are their other fairies like you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah theres tons of other fairies,&quot; Mina said excitedly. &quot;You&#39;ll get to meet all of them. Queen Thea though asked that I greet you and answer any questions you might have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When you say other fairies do you mean famous ones, like Tinkerbell?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mina groaned, running a hand through her short blond hair. &quot;Ugh why is she ALWAYS the first one every human asks about,&quot; she groaned. &quot;Shes such a DIVA! Sure she helped those kids stranded on that island but her story has been blown way out of proportion.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren and his friends have eachother uncomfortable looks as the tiny fairy continued to grumble. &quot;No one ever talks about the love fairy Kyu,&quot; Mina grumbled. &quot;I mean she helped this one guy lose his virginity before helping him engage in threesomes to defeat the Nympho jinn.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mina paused, blushing slightly at her story. &quot;On second though Yeah best not to talk about Kyu,&quot; she said sheepishly. &quot;Shes kind of a slut, plus she was selling Angel Dust to mortals.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Angel Dust,&quot; Hannah exclaimed. &quot;Do you mean like actual Angel Dust or the drug?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The drug of course,&quot; Mina replied. &quot;But your kind of right on both counts. Its actual dust from angels.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hannah looked ready to launch into a anti drug tirade as Darren tried to quiet her. &quot;There is a good story though,&quot; Mona continued. &quot;Queen Thea&#39;s grandmother Glitter. She actually helped a teenage music group that was sucked into another dimension by the Normals founder.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait the Normals founder,&quot; the group exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Mina nodded, rubbing her chin as she now recalled the legend. &quot;Well he wasnt so much the founder more like the father of the founder,&quot; she said. &quot;You see, the guy accidentally opened up a portal to one of the other realms accidentally. Got sucked in and decided to take over. Even gave himself a douchy nickname, Master Blaster. Seriously that&#39;s what he called himself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what happened,&quot; Misaki asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well he tried to take over and make slaves out of everyone,&quot; Mina said. &quot;Even tried to kidnap a teenage rock band. Then Glitter showed up, saved the teens and stopped Master Blaster.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So whatever happened to the guy,&quot; Robbie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well when he got sent back to Earth he started raving about fairies and all types of magical things,&quot; Mina said. &quot;His son listened to those stories and made it his life&#39;s mission to take revenge on the things that hurt his dad. Dumbass kid had no idea that his dad was a douche bag tyrant that wanted to enslave the magical world. By the way did you know they actually made a cartoon about Glitter? You should look it up, it was a cartoon in the 1980s.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren and the others shook their heads no, their heads spinning at possibly the oddest origin story they had ever heard. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well that&#39;s probably enough history,&quot; Mina said quickly. &quot;Queen Thea is just dying to meet you. But first, have to get you ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready,&quot; the group asked. Mina nodded, reaching into a pouch on her hip. &quot;Yeah you guys are a bit big. By the way, whose the one that&#39;s part fairy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Crystal raised her hand tentatively, causing Mina to smile. As she did that she threw a powder at the group, striking Steph in the face. &quot;Well you wont need this then,&quot; Mina stated. &quot;You just need to go fairy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that for,&quot; Steph exclaimed. The Soul Drive now brushed the powder from herself as Mina covered Misaki and Robbue with the powder. As Steph looked to yell at the fairy, she paused. &quot;Darren did you get taller?&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren&#39;s eyes went wide as he gazed at Steph. The usually taller Soul Drive now stood eye to eye with the teen. Darren now watched as Stephs head sank lower, the Soul Drive gasping as she realized what was happening.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m shrinking,&quot; she exclaimed in surprise. &quot;How is that even possible? I&#39;m inorganic!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fairy powder shrinks anything,&quot; Mina shrugged. Steph simply grumbled a response, crossing her arms over her chest as she continued to shrink. Darren smirked as he watched the gynoid grow smaller. &quot;Well if it helps you look adorable Steph,&quot; he grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not helping,&quot; Steph shouted, her voice rising in pitch as she now found herself waist high to Darren. Darren simply chuckled, watching as the gynoid continue growing smaller, the robots eyes growing wide in shock as the world grew around her.<br />
<br />
For Steph the feeling was surreal. Stephs plastic skin felt as if a mild static shock surrounded it. Although not programmed to actually feel anything, she would have to say that the feeling was, oddly soothing. The closest thing she could come to placing the sensation was when she had her skin buffed, waxed and cleaned. In only a moment the gynoid Soul Drive found herself 6 inches tall, surrounded by a much larger forest.<br />
<br />
Soon enough Darren and the others joined Steph in the land of the tiny. Darren useing his ring to make himself 6 inches tall, while Crystal transformed into a fairy. Now group followed Mina, the beginning of a surreal visit with the Fae already proving to be informative.</p>
