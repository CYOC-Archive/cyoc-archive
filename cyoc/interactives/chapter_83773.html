<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Calmly Ms Mahony, calmly!&quot;  <br />
<br />
James had his hands up making placating motions at a beet-red and nearly hyperventilating Jenny as Dave and Jodie walked up. The ubiquitous onlookers were whispering to eachother and all went silent as Dave cleared his throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, I thought Alice was going to meet us?&quot; He looked at James questioningly.  Jenny had a piece of paper crumpled in her fist and transferred her glare from James to Dave as he spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Joe called her into his office.&quot; James said quickly. &quot;Now Jenny, just take some deep breaths, center yourself and let your tension go--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My tension.&quot; She snapped, albeit in a conversational tone of voice. &quot;You want me to &#39;center myself&#39; when some misogynist old-boy network fuc-&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny&#39;s cursing was drowned out by loud laughter as Alice and Joe strolled up to the group. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Dave, this is perfect!  Here,&quot; Alice handed Dave a digital camera. &quot;Mr Cathcart has volunteered Ms Mahony to be the poster-girl for our &quot;inappropriate in the workplace&quot; awareness-raising campaign.  Part of your duties will be to gather pictorial examples of her in workplace attire and situations which are inappropriate for anyone NOT undergoing the Remedial Performance Corrective Discipline pilot program like Jenny is.  Just send me a fresh batch each morning and I&#39;ll get them up on the HR intranet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Remedial what now?&quot; Jodie asked bewildered.<br />
<br />
Alice answered in a loud clear voice, clearly intended to carry to the rubbernecks in nearby cubes.  &quot;RPCD is a groundbreaking new technique in addressing performance shortfalls.  The employee, who would otherwise be Terminated,&quot; Alice glanced over at Jenny and smiled, &quot;instead is offered a specialized set of wardrobe and conduct restrictions to force her to learn to behave appropriately in the workplace.  Since Jenny agreed to RPCD terms which ensure she&#39;ll be in violation of our normal dress code rules she&#39;s the perfect model for the campaign.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joe cleared his throat.  &quot;Ahem, now Dave, I know you and Ms Mahony will be busy with the Danverness project, but I&#39;ll expect to see new pictures every day to insure you&#39;re holding Ms Mahony to the letter of her agreement.  Am I clear?  For the ah...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;RPCD.&quot; Jodie supplied<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, thank you Jodie, for the R. P. C. D. to be proved successful we must all work together to ensure Jenny is complying at all times with the restrictions she agreed to.&quot;<br />
<br />
He turned and looked at Jenny, as if daring her to say anything to the contrary.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t have the appropriate clothing with me--&quot; Jenny began.<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem, we&#39;ve got some promotional T shirts left from the last job fair down in HR.  Five minutes with some scissors and you&#39;ll be compliant.&quot; Alice assured her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why, thank you Alice.&quot; Jenny said through gritted teeth.<br />
<br />
Jodie took the camera out of Dave&#39;s hands.  &quot;Why don&#39;t I go with them?  We can get the first pictures loaded before we all head home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah yes, Jodie,&quot; Dave swallowed to wet his suddenly dry throat before he continued.  &quot;Why don&#39;t you be in charge of taking the promotional photos from now on?  Take some in the morning when Jenny arrives, after I&#39;ve approved her, um, apparel, and, er, off and on throughout the day as situations present themselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Less than a day on the job and already delegating to his subordinates!&quot;  Joe announced to the office at large.  &quot;You all keep an eye on this boy, he&#39;s going places!&quot;  He clapped Dave on the shoulder and headed back to his office.  Alice, an icily furious Jenny, and a gleeful Jodie headed to the elevators, and Dave was left standing awkwardly in a small crowd of office gossips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, Da--I mean, Mr Bahner?  What exactly are Jenny&#39;s RPCD terms?&quot;  Asked one of Jenny&#39;s friends, Susan.  She&#39;d been part of the group laughing at Dave after Jenny&#39;s joke earlier, so Dave was a bit gratified to see her treating him respectfully now.<br />
<br />
&#39;Ample cleavage&#39; was the first thing to pop into Dave&#39;s head.  As he was trying to form a more coherent answer he spotted the crumpled wad of paper Jenny had dropped on the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, here we are!&quot;  He flattened it out and handed the agreement to Susan.  He watched her face as she read, first blushing furiously, then re-reading with a predatory smile. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, if she wears something not on this list, or wears it in a way that covers her up too much,&quot;  She looked at Dave with a gleam in her eye. &quot;She&#39;ll be fired?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yes, you heard Mr Cathcart.&quot;  Dave was taken aback how quickly everyone seemed to turn against Jenny.  It couldn&#39;t all be his pen could it?<br />
<br />
&quot;So if I catch her covering her,&quot; she paused to read lovingly from the paper, &quot;&#39;Ample cleavage&#39; I can report her and you&#39;ll see she gets fired?&quot;  Susan&#39;s eyes were alarmingly dilated and she seemed to be lightly sheened in sweat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;d have the final decision what&#39;s considered &#39;ample&#39;, but if you and the others,&quot; he glanced at the other employees following the conversation and trying to get a look at Jenny&#39;s RPCD agreement, &quot;will help keep an eye on Jenny when she&#39;s not with me I&#39;d appreciate it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll just make some copies of this to circulate then, shall I?&quot; Susan said and walked over to a copy machine. &quot;We can blow it up and post it on the sides of her cube, that&#39;ll help her remember, right?&quot; Susan smiled mischievously and started handing out copies as they came off the copier.<br />
<br />
Dave closed his eyes and gave serious thought to using the golden pen to try to undo a situation that was rapidly getting out of hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr Bahner?&quot; Dave felt someone touch his arm and smelled lilac perfume.  He opened his eyes to see Bethany, another of Jenny&#39;s cronies, was standing in front of him.  She was holding one of Jenny&#39;s lists and standing a bit closer than appropriate under normal office standards. &quot;I just wanted to say, I&#39;m sorry for what Jenny did this morning.  She&#39;s getting nothing more than she deserves.&quot;  Bethany leaned forward, lightly pressing her breasts against Dave&#39;s chest as she brushed a peck on his cheek. &quot;Congratulations on your promotion,&quot; she said softly in his ear before stepping back.  &quot;I hope I get a chance to work closely with you in the future.&quot; She said smiling before she turned and walked away.<br />
<br />
Dave glanced around wildly, noting how everyone was avoiding looking at him.  Some looked embarrassed, some, both men and women, looked almost...jealous?  He turned and started back to his office, then stopped at a water cooler.  Bethany was either a better cock-tease than Jenny ever was, Dave reflected, or she&#39;d entirely bought into Joe&#39;s public declaration in favor of him.  Either way she&#39;d packed a hell of an erotic charge into some fairly innocent actions.  Dave drank a cup of water waiting for the tightness in his pants to relax and his pulse to stop racing.<br />
<br />
He heard the elevator ding, followed by a wave of murmuring and some low whistles.<br />
<br />
Jenny stood frozen a couple steps outside the elevator. She was barefoot, bare legged, and wearing a short, raggedly cut sheath of white cotton slung low on her hips.  Already thin, the material was stretched to where Dave was amazed it didn&#39;t tear completely through, and it left no question whether Jenny had nothing on underneath it.  Her belly was bare and someone, Dave had bets on Jodie, had fashioned the top half of the t-shirt into a bikini-style halter tied in the middle.  Jenny&#39;s breasts were less covered than strategically augmented. Dave felt the tightness return to his pants.  Jenny did her best to ignore the whispers and catcalls as she took short, oddly graceful steps over to her cube, her breasts bouncing every step of the way.<br />
<br />
&quot;She can&#39;t walk fast or she&#39;ll split that &quot;skirt&quot; right up the back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave jumped, not having noticed Jodie approach him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You, ah, got the photos?&quot; Dave asked blushing furiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, I filled the card with her stripping out of her old clothes, swapped cards and kept right on clickin&#39;!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s, is that, uh...&quot; Dave was distracted by Susan and Bethany walking over to Jenny&#39;s cube holding a pair of poster-sized sheets of paper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alice asked if you want 8x10s or just a CD with HD copies?  She&#39;s going to have one of the photoshop guys touch them up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave sputtered and took a calming drink of water, giving Jodie a look of mingled alarm, awe, and trepidation.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing lurkin&#39; by the water cooler anyway?  She asked, &quot;executives have their assistants bring them water when they&#39;re thirsty.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave glanced at Jenny&#39;s cube in time to see Susan hand back Jenny&#39;s original RPCD agreement, which Jenny immediately crumpled again as Susan waved and strutted away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Sir, let&#39;s get you back safely into your office.&quot;  Jodie grabbed Dave by the elbow and turned him around. He stumbled slightly then fell into step along side her.  Even though it felt like his cock must be standing out like a flagpole, the pace she set wasn&#39;t one Dave felt he could argue with. As the poet said, the only way out was through.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now it&#39;s all worked out: Jenny will arrive in HR by 6:45 every morning, she&#39;ll leave any disallowed street clothing in a locker there and pose for some photos.  I told her you expect her to arrive at your office promptly by seven AM with coffee and a snack for you, where you&#39;ll make any final adjustments to her apparel and I&#39;ll take some more photos.  I told her you expect her to pose and stage some inappropriate activities so HR can use them in their awareness campaign.&quot; She paused to open his office door and pushed him inside, whispering &quot;Alice told me you&#39;ve got the green light to fool around with her, so I&#39;m going to send Jenny down to get you a bottle of Evian from the first floor canteen, if she&#39;s still wearing that skirt when she gets back I expect you to have it off her right after she hands you that bottle.&quot;  She glanced down at Dave&#39;s now raging erection. &quot;Hmm!&quot; She smiled and closed the door.</p>
