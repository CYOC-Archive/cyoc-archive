<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The blaring of the alarm clock roused Jeff from a rather nice dream about wide open fields.<br />
<br />
Groggily, he slapped the annoying thing, shutting it off. He rolled over, shoving his rather insistent morning wood away, and pulled himself out of bed. Stretching and looking around, he felt just a hair shorter than last night. He pulled up the Chronivac and looked at his profile.<br />
<br />
DNA:<br />
93% Human<br />
7% Stallion<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh&quot;, he said, &quot;guess it does wear off. Wonder what else I lost?&quot;<br />
<br />
He grabbed some clothes and walked towards the bathroom. Peering into the mirror, he could see that his neck had lost the extra inch he&#39;d gained last night, and his nose was back to normal. The slight mane remained, though he kind of liked the look. He certainly didn&#39;t mind the retained muscle tone.<br />
<br />
He hopped into the shower and cleaned up. He had to resist playing with himself under the comfortable massage of the water pressure, but his willpower won out. He wanted to wait before getting more horse-like. Shutting off the water, he got out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeeiiighhff!!&quot; his mother half yelled, half neighed from downstairs. &quot;Hurry up!&quot;<br />
<br />
Drying off, he threw his clothes on. A simple t-shirt and some stretchy joggers for his DNA-enhanced junk. He walked back to his room, throwing on some socks and sneakers before grabbing his backpack. He had almost gone downstairs before he remembered the Chronivac. Quickly, he shut the program and the PC off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t want Mom messing with that.&quot; He thought.<br />
<br />
He headed downstairs. <br />
<br />
His mother greeted him with a hug. She was slightly taller than him now that he&#39;d lost some neck.<br />
<br />
His sister waved from the table, too engrossed in a large bowl of oatmeal to speak.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s mouth watered at the sight of the oatmeal, but before he could grab a bowl, his mother cut in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Better hurry out front! The bus will be here at any moment!&quot; she said worriedly.<br />
<br />
Jeff snatched a piece of toast off the table and ran outside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Byeeighh!&quot; he shouted, his voice cracking slightly as a neigh tried to sneak in.<br />
<br />
He sprinted down the driveway just as the bus was pulling up. He jumped aboard as it stopped and doors opened. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks!&quot; he said to the driver.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever&quot; they responded, &quot;Just get in your seat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff frowned at this. Normally Miss Peters was quite nice to him, but now she wasn&#39;t even looking at him.<br />
<br />
He turned to walk down the center aisle, but paused again when he saw half the kids were staring at him. Some were avoiding looking at him, and others just ignored him altogether. A pair of freshmen were sitting together, one pointed at Jeff and then whispered to the other, who laughed. Jeff was pretty sure he&#39;d heard the word &quot;freak&quot; in there.<br />
<br />
Jeff caught the eye of his friend, Amy, who was sitting near the back. She smiled and waved at him like it was any other normal day. <br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, sit down boy&quot; repeated the bus driver.<br />
<br />
Jeff walked down the aisle, heading towards the empty spot near Amy. He tried ignore the people he shied away from him as he past, though he couldn&#39;t quite phase out the &quot;what a weirdo&quot; that followed him after passing one junior.<br />
<br />
Reaching his seat he plopped down next to Amy, taking a quick look at her. <br />
<br />
A bit of a tomboy, about 5&#39;4&quot;, with Asian features (courtesy of her mother) and chin length teal-dyed hair in a messy bob. She was fairly thin, but toned from lots of skateboarding. She had a cute face with a smattering of freckles across the bridge of her nose and under her eyes (courtesy of her father). She was wearing a worn olive hoodie over a gray tank top, a pair of black shorts, and some white high-tops, a pair of white crew socks sticking out of the tops.<br />
<br />
She lived a few streets over, and she and Jeff had been firm friends since early childhood.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looking pretty average,&quot; she said nudging him in the ribs playfully, &quot;farms stop paying you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha&quot; said Jeff, &quot;Why? Worried you&#39;re gonna run outta weed before I can buy us more?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;SSSHHHH!!!!&quot; Amy whispered at him, with an obviously fake look of concern, &quot;Want prissy-pants to turn us in?&quot; She pointed forward, and Jeff turned to see Katie, a preppy blonde girl who had always buddied up with teachers, huff indignantly before quickly turning away from them and staring towards the front of the bus.<br />
<br />
Jeff and Amy laughed. Katie may like to brown-nose, but she&#39;d been too scared of ratting them out after they&#39;d caught her peering at a teacher&#39;s upcoming test answer sheet after class one day.<br />
<br />
The two talked as they usually did, and after a few more stops, they arrived at school.<br />
<br />
Getting off the bus and entering the school, Jeff parted with Amy as they went to their respective lockers. He was dismayed to see the weird behavior wasn&#39;t limited to his ride. People kept giving him weird glances and a wide berth in the hall. <br />
<br />
He wondered where his other friends were, he hadn&#39;t seen them outside their buses.<br />
<br />
He saw Liz walking toward her locker and gave her a wave. She looked a bit more normal today, though Jeff had forgotten to check her percentage. Her running shoes looked a little tight, but they at least fit, and her nose, while larger, looked much more human. She had her red hair down, so her ears were hidden. He had to admit that her ass looked just as good today as it had yesterday. He didn&#39;t know if her light dusting of horse hair had reverted or if she had shaved, but her tanned runners legs were smooth. <br />
<br />
The sight of them caused a slight stirring in his pants, and Jeff forced himself to think of something else.<br />
<br />
Liz gave him a slight smile and furtive wave, but quickly turned away as her boyfriend, school quarterback Todd Rivers, came up to her. He threw Jeff a quick look before leaning in to kiss her. He was surrounded by his usual posse of other football players.<br />
<br />
Jeff turned away in annoyance, opening his locker to grab his books for his first class.<br />
<br />
Shutting his locker, her turned and started walking to class.<br />
<br />
Someone clapped him on the back and came ahead to face Jeff. Jeff stopped to see it was Todd.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sup, horse-boy!&quot; he said, &quot;I was wondering if you wanted to come to my party this weekend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha...?&quot; said Jeff in surprise. Todd was very popular, and had never given Jeff any attention before. His parties were legendary too. &quot;Really?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha NOPE!&quot; laughed Todd, causing Jeff&#39;s heart to sink in embarrassment. <br />
<br />
Todd cackled again, &quot;No freak, I just needed to stall you for a second!&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Jeff could react to this, one of the other football players came up behind Jeff, and stuck a damp cloth under his nose.<br />
<br />
The spicy, musky scent hit Jeff&#39;s nostrils like a brick wall. He barely had time to think &quot;Mare Scent&quot;, before his cock abruptly took over as head thinker. He pushed the football player away, involuntarily taking deep breaths as he struggled for control, but it was no good. His pupils were fully dilated, and the whole hallway seemed to become strangely surreal. His member, already large in its sheath, began engorging steadily, all his blood seemingly heading southward. <br />
<br />
His thoughts were out of his control. They seemed to jump between the girls he&#39;d seen this morning; Liz&#39;s substantial rear, Amy&#39;s toned skater&#39;s legs, Katie&#39;s blonde mane. He couldn&#39;t help but ogle the women in the hall too.<br />
<br />
Dimly he noticed that the cheerleader who he was currently eyeing was looking back in disgust at somewhere around his torso. <br />
<br />
Jeff summoned some willpower and looked down. His veiny junk had quickly grown above the edge of his joggers and had headed up the inside of his shirt. The outline was obscenely visible through his thin t-shirt.<br />
<br />
There was jeering and revolted cries in equal measure from onlookers. Todd and his friend were doubled up with laughter.<br />
<br />
Jeff saw Liz, she was laughing along with the others, but it seemed forced, and her eyes looked worried.<br />
<br />
Katie stood not too far away from Liz, her hand over her mouth in shock, her eyes fixed on his monstrous member.<br />
<br />
Jeff couldn&#39;t take it anymore, a small part of his mind seized control and he abruptly turned and ran into the nearest men&#39;s bathroom, his cock still throbbing madly on the edge of orgasm. He ducked into the handicap stall and sat on the toilet, pulling his horse cock from underneath his shirt. <br />
<br />
He heard the bell ring, and the general din of the jeering crowd outside slowly died away. He turned his attention back to the most pressing problem, taking labored breaths as he tried to work past the mare scent, but his erection just didn&#39;t want to go down. His muscles strained and he closed his eyes, he was right on the edge.<br />
<br />
His pointed ears registered the sound of the door opening, and someone entered the bathroom. He heard light footsteps making their way in front of the stall door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go aweeeiiighh!&quot; He neighed madly at whoever it was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff?&quot; said a female voice that his pheremone-addled mind couldn&#39;t place. <br />
<br />
His mind filled again with unbidden thoughts of juicy thighs, thick asses, and long faces. His cock throbbed with renewed vigor, gobs of pre leaked from it, and he could feel a building sensation in his swollen testicles.<br />
<br />
&quot;I saw what happened out there, are you okay?&quot; continued the mystery girl on the other side of the door, and she pushed it open.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s mind barely had time to register the vague form of a woman before his balls pulled tight against his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no&quot; he thought, before rational thought left him as waves of pleasure crashed over him while his tortured dick began spraying his cum all over the poor person.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh!&quot; said the voice as they were liberally drenched.<br />
<br />
Jeff started coming down from his high. His member still occasionally twitching and dropping smaller dollops of cum on the tile floor. The familiar tingling of transformation started to creep over him. Fighting the curiosity to check himself for changes, he focused on the person he had hosed down.</p>
