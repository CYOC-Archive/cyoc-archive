<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Annie passionately kissed Ralph as they&#39;d came home for the day. While many of the amenities weren&#39;t fully ready for many of the larger Dinotopians, for the two Maiasaura, things weren&#39;t too bad. They had each other and happily had a healthy Jake to raise. Though that afternoon, Annie had felt a strong pull in the back of her mind. Even with Jake around, the thing that seemed to be on her mind that hit her like a pressing need was Ralph. It was like she needed his strong muscular body and above all the large penis that was normally inside an internal slit between his legs, which she could feel opening as she pressed herself against her husband and kissed him.<br />
<br />
They&#39;d gotten Jake to the nursery, which was right next to their bedroom and set their infant son down for his late afternoon nap. It was only after just shutting the door that Ralph found Annie pressing herself against him and kissing him as passionately as she could manage with her beaklike muzzle. He also found that she was producing a very attractive scent that was seeming to arouse him as much as the gentle caresses of Annie&#39;s hands and the feeling of her large soft breasts pressing against his chest. In fact Ralph thought she was rather heavily aroused already as it felt like her scale like nipples were not only firm but were pressing through the material of her bra and the nursing uniform she wore.<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone&#39;s rather happy to see me,&quot; Ralph managed as Annie essentially pushed him back to their bed, with its springs squeaking a little bit as he found himself sitting down on it. Before him, Annie was already undoing the buttons on the front of her shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve been on my mind all day,&quot; Annie answered as she pulled off her shirt and climbed into Ralph&#39;s lap, and kissing at his muzzle and happily enjoying the kisses he returned and as his hands moved around to fiddle with the straps that held on her bra. &quot;It&#39;s like I need you... desperately...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Need me?&quot; Ralph smirked back as he got Annie&#39;s bra off and soon softly licked and &quot;nibbled&quot; at her nipples, &quot;For what? Surely... you aren&#39;t fearing that I&#39;d be going away...&quot;<br />
<br />
Annie gave a happy moan as she reached down to begin pulling down Ralph&#39;s pants, which she could already tell was being tented by his penis and that seemed to drive her need onward. Ralph responded in kind as well, and the two found themselves kicking their underwear off to different parts of the room and with Annie grinding her exposed and wet vaginal lips against the outside of her husband&#39;s aroused penis.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not going away...&quot; Annie said with a smile, &quot;I need you IN me... I...&quot;<br />
<br />
Her mind flashed for a moment with some of the classes that she and Ralph had taken with regard to dealing with animal instincts. While those converting to Project Mesozoic or Project Cenozoic were becoming animals that either had no close relatives living in the modern world or were so different from their evolutionary decedents that they were often seen as something very different from what was thought of with regard to instincts. Heather&#39;s attack on Sophie and Roland soon proved that otherwise in that instincts were big and could potentially be tough to handle. This soon brought about further instruction on the likely instincts they would feel as Dinotopians.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;m in heat,&quot; Annie managed after a moment. That need was the need to mate and procreate, which was something of a surprise. Annie didn&#39;t fully expect this, as they had Jake and she figured that her instincts would recognize Jake&#39;s presence and thus wouldn&#39;t feel that need, but still it was there. She felt a strong need to mate with her husband and fill her womb with his eggs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing we read said on when that was,&quot; Ralph said slowly as Annie pushed him onto his back and lifted herself up for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose that&#39;s what you get when you bring back animals that were never observed and studied by people,&quot; Annie mused as she then lowered herself onto her husband&#39;s penis and moaned huskily as he filled her and the two soon began thrusting their hips forward. &quot;But... it&#39;s a nice surprise...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ralph reached up to hold onto Annie&#39;s hips as she thrust forward and sexual moans soon rising from both of them, though Ralph&#39;s tone was deeper than Annie&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we&#39;ll have a baby brother or sister for Jake,&quot; Annie happily moaned as she felt Ralph actually suckle on one of her breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or maybe both,&quot; Ralph answered back.<br />
<br />
Annie only smiled as she felt the pleasure build within her.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Though not every Dinotopian that was feeling that mating drive kicking into high gear was actually going through with it. Polly found this out as she made a trip to visit Jeremy at Horizon and found him with Heather, Rex, and Tyra in his main lab/office area. Heather and Tyra looked a bit flustered and were almost waiving their hands at their faces. This had puzzled Polly a bit, as she&#39;d come for a visit that had become sort of routine and often involved her and Heather coloring before Jeremy and Heather took Polly back to the Whites.<br />
<br />
&quot;I never felt this when I first changed,&quot; Heather said to Rex as Jeremy stood by her and holding onto one of Heather&#39;s hands, &quot;the intensity... that is familiar... but it&#39;s a different sensations...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not a bad sensation,&quot; Tyra gave a smile as she looked to Rex who was presently looking at Jeremy&#39;s computer as some things came back in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... and one not observed in any field of paleontology,&quot; Rex managed with a small quip.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on!?&quot; Polly soon demanded as observed the flustered looks, hearing the conversation, and catching a rather odd scent that Polly couldn&#39;t truly identify.<br />
<br />
This turned heads and soon brought an apologetic frown to Heather and Jeremy&#39;s muzzles as they looked to Polly. This only served to puzzle her more and make her determined to get answers.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on!?&quot; Polly demanded with a slight huff, &quot;What&#39;s wrong with Jeremy and Heather?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think anything is wrong,&quot; Heather managed as she looked to her fiancé and then to his younger sister, &quot;this is more embarrassing than anything else...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Polly wondered as she tilted her head.<br />
<br />
Rex traded looks to the three Syntixisaurus Rexes and then to the Polar Bear Animalian that had come in to find the lab in its present state of confusion. While Polly was mentally only par with an elementary school student, and Heather and Jeremy had to remember that, it was something that could be difficult given how tall she was. The thing that Jeremy did find beneficial was that after his conversion, Polly&#39;s &quot;bear hugs&quot; weren&#39;t quite as crushing as they&#39;d been when they were human. However, that didn&#39;t make the explaining to Polly the &quot;birds and the bees,&quot; which might not be very easy, as Polar Bears had THEIR mating season in the coming months which could well put Marcy and her mother in a similar condition.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does she...?&quot; Rex asked to Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I never got around to the birds and the bees with Polly,&quot; Jeremy admitted, &quot;though... I don&#39;t know on what the Whites have explained to her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s this with birds and bees?&quot; Polly asked, &quot;is this some diet you&#39;re trying out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... it&#39;s more a reference to the meaning of life,&quot; Tyra spoke, &quot;and that right now... it seems that Heather and are ready to make more Syntixisaurus Rexes the old fashioned way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How is that?&quot; Polly wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know where babies come from?&quot; Rex asked, looking for some diplomatic means to explain this to Polly. In some ways, it was an interesting point for him to study, though the fact that Heather and Tyra were hybridized Theropods would make that study a bit more difficult as he couldn&#39;t be sure what would come from which specific theropod that made up the Syntixisaurus Rex genome with regard to breeding. And that could be difficult as while Theropods and birds shared a great many similarities and were more closely related to each other than even some other dinosaurs, there was a lot that for the moment would purely speculative until more could be observed. However, that wasn&#39;t quite the sort of discussion that Polly was looking for, and her response to the question soon made it tough for Rex to try and continue that answer.<br />
<br />
Polly leaped into a flying hug that pretty much tackled Heather out of her chair and sent both crashing onto the floor with a loud &quot;thud.&quot; It startled both Jeremy and Tyra, though the next exclamation soon made it clear that Polly wasn&#39;t attacking Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re going to have a baby!?&quot; Polly practically cheered and then nuzzled at Heather&#39;s head.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... I&#39;m not pregnant,&quot; Heather managed, &quot;though it would appear that the mating season for the Syntixisaurus Rex is in early march... In that my body is readying itself for that sort of thing...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want to have a baby?&quot; Polly asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d never thought on it,&quot; Heather admitted, &quot;right now... between probation and getting your brother to propose and other surprises, it&#39;s something that&#39;s never come to mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d be a good father,&quot; Jeremy admitted, &quot;I certainly could have done better by you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Tyra said slowly, &quot;but I&#39;d prefer you wait on trying until AFTER things with you and Heather are official.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we&#39;ll let you know when you become an aunt,&quot; Heather said to Polly and rubbed Polly&#39;s head for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a Polar Bear,&quot; Polly corrected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aunt as an a-u-n-t, which is what you will be to any child that Jeremy and I might have in the future as you are his sister,&quot; Heather explained.</p>
