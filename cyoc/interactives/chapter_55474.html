<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You said tested it on the neighborhood 'children' plural, so in other words--&quot; Maddex <br />
lead. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Glass Marie picked up, &quot;Those two boys weren't the second to last. Sadly. Or rather, <br />
tragically. Remember what I said. They wouldn't even TRY going after the lupmans or <br />
leomans at first, the leomans which ironically in the witchs' opinion had proven the most <br />
'worthy' of being granted their 'gift' of 'pure absolute freedom' due to being the most <br />
civilized.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Yes, I know that doesn't make sense when their grudge was against civilization in <br />
general. But remember, at this point their actions were more bad therefore meant civilized <br />
things in their minds, rather than civilized things therefore bad which was their thinking <br />
process.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice said in her ever articulate form of speech, &quot;You were not pretending before when you <br />
told myself, my half-sisters/cousins, and pack mates that by this point in time the three <br />
witches had gone quite mad as Hatters.&quot;   <br />
<br />
'Leave it to Alice to use that term,' Lawrence thought to the eldest of the three glass <br />
wolves. <br />
<br />
Marie looked like she was somewhere around Abbey's age... but at the same time, she <br />
acted like she was as old as Mr. P, and again like nothing more than a pup who had seen <br />
too much too soon too fast. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, I was not.&quot; The red and black dressed blond pup said. &quot;One powerful Geass around <br />
Joella later, the witches knew that the children of Glendale would accept candy from a little <br />
girl more readily than strange adults. And  soon after taking the candy they would leave, <br />
forget Joella had ever given them candy or had even seen her that day, and promptly went <br />
insane as their vulnerable naked minds were opened up to the full scale of the infinite <br />
chaos. <br />
<br />
 It was an epidemic, which that Joella  honestly felt sorry to see so many of her friends <br />
acting with all the reason of animals, other as empty as seemingly the many figurines she <br />
had that looked like her, -yes the failed experiments to create her though she didn't know <br />
that- and others now trapped in mental fantasy worlds only they could see, some <br />
beautiful, some awful, and some so alien that the poor children made no sense to anyone <br />
around them. <br />
<br />
She unwittingly threw suspicion off the witches for a time as she acted like a half century <br />
early version of Florence Nightingale. Helping in any way she could with the mad children. <br />
It was how she had been born, the witches saw themselves as heroes, and so this Joella <br />
was everything the best friend of heroes would be. She -wanted- to help them. So made <br />
friends easily. Just as I have the wisdom and understanding the witches THOUGHT they <br />
had, Joella too had the kindness and compassion the witches THOUGHT they had.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She had no idea it was the candy she had given all the friends was cause?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. She never found that out. She was with her 'grandfather' when the witches made their <br />
run with the leoman cubs, fearing for her safety in case things turned ugly.... Of course, <br />
the infinite chaos being what it is, of the many children the witches turned mad via Joella <br />
(who they saw simply as helping them save people rather than as a tool as you might <br />
think), a handful developed a tiny spark of the Gift rather than going -completely- insane <br />
and simply saw the world a legitimately different way rather than seeing one that only <br />
existed in their minds.&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;And that makes it better?&quot; Maddex asked insulted.<br />
<br />
Marie sighed, &quot;I wish you'd stop acting like I was trying to -defend- them.  Joella as I said <br />
easily made friends with boy the human children of Glendale and the many fairies created <br />
by the witches in their own childhood years. She was actually sad to see them go when they <br />
said their debt was paid and departed.<br />
<br />
 &quot;And when Solome died... she cried, of course her 'parents' -thought it was a term they'd <br />
loath and despise using despite it's logical application- didn't tell her the whole truth of <br />
what happened. Just that a mean dog that killed Solome, and Joella assumed it was a mad <br />
dog so the witches were doing the poor animal a favor by putting it out of it's misery.  Of <br />
course she visited the leoman cub who came down with the 'wandering demons' as some <br />
of the locals had begun to call it, others nicknamed it the 'shadow of despair' ... <br />
<br />
&quot;Did she learn the witches' true nature at that point?&quot; Betty asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. And even if she had, she'd have thought it was some -other- witches who had done <br />
so. She was a child after all, and wouldn't have wanted to accept her family (a term the <br />
witches were somewhat more accepting of since it didn't automatically imply adulthood). <br />
As it was, Mal'Akh was there to tell her tale to Joella, and she simply tried to help the mad <br />
cub in any way she could. Thank again to the geass around her, created by the witches for <br />
the precise purpose of -protecting- her, no one question how the adopted child of three <br />
husband-less women could possible afford such gifts to give or such dresses to wear ... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did the other witches lose their familiars before the final battle?&quot; Betty asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;No. Lilith and Herodias were part of the final conflict.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to ask.&quot; Lawrence asked, &quot;What was Joella told, or did she see it happen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She was told her foster parents came down with the same epidemic that had plagued <br />
Glendale's children, and died trying to bring happiness to Glendale, not technically a lie.&quot; <br />
<br />

<br />
Still in her wig and Kimono, Umeko pushed Penny's wheelchair along like the willing slave <br />
she was. None of her 'sister-wives' spoke to her, nor her husband, as far as the Japanese <br />
wolves were concerned, until either Yamato or Penny could walk, she was the legal <br />
property of the Pride, in particular Penny.  <br />
<br />
Gary asked, &quot;So are you going to tell my little cubs you plan to basically be their mentor <br />
from now on? Or am I going to have to?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I'd rather not.&quot; Penny said simply, &quot;THey're still grieving, and I'd rather wait until after the <br />
funeral to tell them so it doesn't look like I'm trying to replace their mother.&quot; <br />
<br />
'Replace their mother?' Gillie thought, cursing her new somewhat more sensitive ears (they <br />
were going to make sleeping torture, she was sure). 'Oh my God... don't tell me, Fox or <br />
Elise were ... were MARRIED TO GARY in this new reality!!! But how.. that's not the path of <br />
least resistance!!! Is it?'<br />
<br />
Gillie also finally notice the aliens-from-Mars-wolf-women with fur patterns like they <br />
were NPCs in a game to precisely show they were of the medical profession. Gillie just <br />
hoped more such moronic cliches didn't pop up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Chief.&quot; Said the tall blond wolf woman who had gotten cozy with Jensen when he had <br />
come in. He guessed this was either Frank or Daryl but he had no clue to which. &quot;I know <br />
you don't want to hear it but, I kinda think I'm out of commission too along with Darla until <br />
everyone is up and walking again. I don't think I can do my job with the Pack and my job <br />
with the police at the same time, sorry... I know Julie's our Pack's medic, but I can't just <br />
leave my sister to face all this alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gillie needed a drink. &quot;We, are going to be so short handed...&quot; It was going to be a <br />
headache to get her remaining office enough sleep and to keep law in Glendale. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I know, I know, I'm sorry but... they're my Pack, I just can't abandon them.&quot;<br />
<br />
The dirty blond said with the same tone Gillie would expect from any close nit family. <br />
<br />
&quot;............. I understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Time for he daily Mass, can you and Paul take over for me down here while I'm up there?&quot; <br />
Father Mike asked simply. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think we can manage, go take care of your business... And... good luck on explaining <br />
being mutated -twice- now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;After the first time, the second time isn't as bad...&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
1688 <br />
<br />
&quot;That isn't the spear we've been using.&quot; Armando noticed. <br />
<br />
Kathrine stood full and at attention, she had acquired more than a few scars since taking <br />
up her learning with Armando. It was actually kind of jarring to see such bright blue fur <br />
with his inner pink patches and green accents to have slash marks that showed off her <br />
mended flesh. <br />
<br />
She refused to wear trousers when learning from Armando, she was a woman after all.  She <br />
absolutely refused to go around naked. She and the church she had promised her life to <br />
considered the lupman warped enough for going around in the fur themeless, it wasn't like <br />
it would kill them to wear loin clothes. <br />
<br />
 &quot;I got the idea after I managed to pry a few of Marie's encounters out of her, she felt they <br />
might scare me out of following her... The man who forged it was told it was for the <br />
service of the Church, not a lie.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever.  Come on then, start running.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I'll stay right here thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Armando didn't look impressed, &quot;If you want to be in a split for six months...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;My choice.&quot; Kathrine said simply. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever.&quot; He repeated and charged. 'And there she goes. using the exact same trick as <br />
before. Stupid cat, she needs to learn that repeating yourself only gets you killed, she can <br />
reflect on that while her bones mend and -&quot;GUH! What? Uhhhhhhh...&quot; <br />
<br />
The spear had a hollow shaft. The butt of the spear had disconnected from the rest <br />
revealing a weapon with the cutting edge on the wrong side. The side where the cutting <br />
edge should have been had struck against Armando's side, causing him to hold his ribs. <br />
<br />
&quot;You...&quot; He gasped, deep breathing feeling painful. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just a trick I picked up from Marie...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent cat.&quot; The old lupman watching all of this using the slur like it was a proper and <br />
formal term of addressing someone, &quot;Just keep remembering the same trick doesn't work <br />
more than once on the average person...&quot;<br />
<br />
Kathrine only nodded.<br />
<br />
Armando grunted, &quot;That weapon is useless, the killing edge is on the wrong side.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's on the right side for me, I'm no killer!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You're going to have to be if you want to survive.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kathrine didn't dignify his words with an answer. <br />
<br />
Later that day, as Marie and Kathrine passed each other in the hallway.<br />
<br />
Both had taken their true vows. Both had sworn their lives to the Church and were married <br />
now only to God. <br />
<br />
Marie Cruz was now twenty-three, while Kathrine was twenty-two. <br />
<br />
The rigid but determined if nothing else Abigail had her sights set on one day becoming <br />
the new Abbess. <br />
<br />
Zoey and Alaba had become best of friends since both had nearly been used as sacrifices <br />
by the turk spy Abaza. <br />
<br />
Abaza, using the alias Abraham,  the one man who Marie had dared open her heart to <br />
since abandoning her identity as Marius. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder how Gillian is doing right now? Or Lobo for that matter... it's been so long... Do <br />
they even remember Marius by now? It was so long ago. <br />
<br />
'If I don't leave soon now, I KNOW I'm going to be too late. I'm simply out of time.' She <br />
looked at Kathrine. She stopped. She touched Kathrine's shoulder.<br />
<br />
Kathrine looked at her. &quot;Yes Marie?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kathrine startled when Marie actually blinked a tear away with her good eye. <br />
<br />
 &quot;Kathrine... I beg you, please... don't kill yourself over this, I don't think I could forgive <br />
myself if you did.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Marie shuffled off, clearly tired or she would have said more. <br />
<br />
Kathrine wondered what Marie meant. Well, not really. After all, Marie was certain that <br />
Kathrine just wasn't built for this sort of thing. <br />
<br />
Kathrine got to her room looked in the mirror, and cried out in shock at her reflection. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is that... is that really me?&quot; Kathrine thought her heart racing.<br />
<br />
The face looking back, wasn't the one Kathrine had known most of her life. It was like a <br />
limit had been reached, and had finally gone over the top. Kathrine saw a woman she <br />
didn't recognize. <br />
<br />
This woman had her fur coloring and eye coloring, was her species and age, but there was <br />
something about this woman that was not Kathrine, and that scared her. <br />
<br />
Kathrine began to suspect what Marie really meant by Kathrine killing her 'self' over this <br />
training. <br />
<br />
That was when another question struck her. 'Who is Kathrine? For seventeen year she was a <br />
happy face and a cheerful voice. But who is she? I liked the Kathrine who wanted to be <br />
friends with everyone, didn't I?'</p>
