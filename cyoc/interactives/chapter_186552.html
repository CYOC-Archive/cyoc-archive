<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before long, all three of the planned test subjects reported down to the labs to begin the test underway. Ethan was already down there after having bought some clothes for his boss - namely, a tank top, jeans, new shoes and socks, a pair of boxers, and a baseball cap. He figured Carl would want to be as trendy as possible, so Ethan made sure to pick out clothes to let his boss enjoy his renewed lease on life. He had them sent up to the executive office via an intern, who left looking remarkably confused by the reason why Ethan was sending these kinds of clothes up to the office of Carlyle Booth, who for all he knew was an eighty-something year old man.<br />
<br />
Ethan found himself feeling tempted yet again as he saw Nolan, Gus and David enter shortly after the intern left - David seemed to glance at the intern as the young man grumbled about how weird this job was. But ultimately David just shrugged his shoulders and walked along. Now, as for the persons of interest...<br />
<br />
What Gus London never really told anyone at work was that he was leaning bisexual, and he was very much into Ethan. Man if he could just get a good look at the doctor&#39;s body under that labcoat. Gus was svelte and thin, but he was hardly satisfied with that kind of physique. He yearned to be more like the doc. He had a girlfriend currently, but theirs was a somewhat open relationship - she let him pursue men he liked to look into his sexuality. In turn, they maintained a very passionate love life.  Gus had light brown almost blond hair and a somewhat patchy beard trimmed close to his face.<br />
<br />
Now David, Mr. Bruce was an ambitious corporate man always eager to climb another rung. Devastatingly handsome as he was now, David had a well muscled physique and black hair slicked back, his bright blue eyes accentuating his appealing features. He wore exclusively tuxes that he had tailored to be a little bit too small, all the better to draw attention to his body. David lived the life of a playboy - whenever he wasn&#39;t at work, he would crawl the bars and take a different woman home each night.<br />
<br />
Old Nolan was a rather dumpy and somewhat frail old man, hair mostly receded and gray where it still existed. He wore suspenders over a long sleeved shirt, another pair of pants, and a hat with the company logo on the front. Nolan had once upon a time been a dashingly handsome stud in the 60s or 70s, a real clean cut type. But those days were long since passed. At least for now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; David said, taking the lead, &quot;So going forward with this is gonna improve our standing with the corp, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That it will, Dave,&quot; Ethan answered from behind a desk as he prepared the Chronos virus. He bottled three doses of it for use on his three guests, and then bottled an additional three for later, &quot;just in case&quot;. He was very curious to see what effect the drug was going to have on these three. Two of his three subjects were already not exactly old, while the third was graying and old but not in as bad condition as Carl had been prior to regeneration.<br />
<br />
&quot;So this won&#39;t like...turn us into kids or anything, will it?&quot; Gus asked, somewhat nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, all the kinks in the formula have been dealt with,&quot; Ethan answered.<br />
<br />
Nolan was quiet however and admitted to himself that even if this stuff turned him into a 12 year old, he wouldn&#39;t mind it terribly much. He felt a sense of nostalgia for his earlier years, a yearning to return to them. Escape the aches and pains of life as it was now. Besides, regardless how young he got he would get to enjoy life again.<br />
<br />
Handing out the serum, Ethan stated, &quot;Apply either to the arm or neck, and wait until the entire serum is injected. Then withdraw the injector and set it on the table next to you.&quot; He just hoped that he didn&#39;t need to repeat such obvious good medical advice. As for the three of them, they nodded in agreement. David observing the Chronos Virus as he held it in his hand, thinking about the potential of this.<br />
<br />
Nolan was the first to inject, followed by David, and then Gus last. Once they were fully injected they indeed followed the advice, not yet feeling the tingling sensation - but keen to put the injector down before any potentially riotous transformation began. And indeed that may have been wise, as David almost seemed to repress a kick of his leg. He started pulling his tux open, groaning, &quot;Ohh...fuck, is the heat normal? Feels kinda nice...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot; Gus moaned, taking a seat on the floor and deciding to wait out the effects there.<br />
<br />
The effects would be most apparent on Nolan first - his thinning hair filling back in posthaste, his aged body starting to right itself, the slight curviture in his spine from extended physical labor righting with a crack as Nolan gasped. He looked left and right and saw Gus on the floor, his features looking slightly softer even as his muscles grew stronger and more toned, popping his collar outside his awareness and sending his button flying into the air.<br />
<br />
David was in full on heat from it, more or less. It was obvious the ambitious corporate man was trying to make it less obvious he was so incredibly turned on. It was like he was getting a blowjob from two hookers at once! &quot;Ahhh...fuck, fuck!&quot; David outright removed his jacket and tried to pry his shirt open more gently, but even still he ruined a few of his buttons. &quot;Nooo...my shirt...fuck...&quot; He moaned, not even seeing his body hair starting to withdraw, his muscled physique losing a little bit of size but more than making up for it in sheer tone. That shirt was fast getting uncomfortable. His face no longer had a rakish bit of stubble on there, his well coiffed hair growing longer and less well tamed.<br />
<br />
Nolan gasped as he felt the arousal hit him for the first time in years! His body was growing stronger again, regressing further, wrinkles and crow&#39;s feet smoothing out as he turned to the right side of forty, trying to adjust his shirt as he felt his pecs growing out against the shirt, his gut growing tighter and stronger, more well toned but not quite abs yet. His hips lightly moved as he tried to maintain his standing.<br />
<br />
Gus however by now was outright groaning on the floor, his hands roughly grasping at his body as his hips pistoned up against an invisible lover. Gus&#39; hair lightened a bit further, he bit his slightly thicker lip, and flexed his abs as they grew tighter and stronger. His pecs looking sweltering as he full on opened his shirt up...before tossing it away. &quot;I feel so...so GOOD! Ohh fuck!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan noted it seemed there was an occasional sexual component to this it seemed. All his current test subjects it seemed were enjoying the transformation quite a bit. Made it all the more tempting thus...<br />
<br />
Nolan by now was trending less toward 40 and more toward 30 and younger. His features were stunningly handsome, a strong jawline and steely colored eyes, thick dark brown hair on his head and his clean cut &quot;boy next door&quot; features returning - albeit distorted in sheer pleasure as he continued regressing. &quot;Ohh Ethan, this feels great! I-I can barely help myself! I know these two can&#39;t quite do it...&quot; Another pulse of growth brought muscle mass to Nolan&#39;s body, powerfully built pecs and a strong midsection slowly showing more abs on full display. His cock was visible in his pants, hard as can be - yet unlike the other two, Nolan had no intention of &quot;making a fool of himself&quot;.<br />
<br />
David, owing to the lack of more years to go, was already trending on his younger years - returning to eighteen and looking less like an experienced and ambitious corporate man and more like an eighteen year old. His body was tight, incredibly toned, a minimum amount of size lost in exchange for a huge amount of tone gained. The legs on him were insane - his glutes were almost tearing his pants, his quads and thighs almost seeming to fight for room in his now too small pants. He was pawing intently at his groin, enjoying the sensation as the change slowly halted for him.<br />
<br />
Gus likewise was in a state of bliss. His body was stronger, much more muscular than it had been before, and at 18, Gus had a lighter blond color to his hair, his shoulders and back making wearing those office shirts a much more difficult proposition. His arms while not incredibly large were sculpted and well toned.<br />
<br />
Nolan experienced the last burst of his change as he continued regressing, his features softening a bit though he didn&#39;t lose his lantern jawed look. His hair seemed matted with sweat, but fully thick and good looking. Nolan&#39;s body was astonishingly ripped and still very sizable - possibly 240 lbs and maybe 9 or 10% body fat. He gasped for air, his sweltering chest raising, his abs flexing and obliques looking clear. A &quot;v&quot; shape led toward his groin and his still quite hard manhood. &quot;Ahh...ahh! I&#39;m...I&#39;m really young again! Eighteen!&quot;<br />
<br />
David managed to pry his hands off of himself and commented wryly on Nolan, &quot;Not bad looking, old timer. You really got a lot out of this.&quot; David just hoped he&#39;d keep his job and be believable as well, himself. <br />
<br />
Gus got up and felt an groundswell of lust toward the astonishingly built Nolan and the buffed out David, both with their upper bodies on more or less full display. The shirts remaining didn&#39;t cover much of anything - and Gus bit his lip as he saw the two of them dispense with the shirts. &quot;You guys look...amazing. Sexy even.&quot;<br />
<br />
That seemed to ignite something in David, and he chuckled, &quot;Appreciate it, Gus, even though I don&#39;t really swing that way,&quot; his manhood pulsed, hard as can be, &quot;Though honestly, I&#39;d say I&#39;m still hotter than Nolan over here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Nolan thought he could handle the return to how testosterone driven the teen years were for men, but his maturity flagged at that moment due to his renewed sense of machismo, &quot;I&#39;d say I&#39;m a lot better looking now. You wanna test that, David?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know how competitive I am, Nole.&quot; David was already removing his pants, leaving him in a pair of boxers.<br />
<br />
Ethan looked at the two of them as Nolan likewise removed his pants, leaving him standing there in a pair of tighty whities hanging on for dear life. &quot;Guys? This...is probably not the place for that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Respectfully, Ethan,&quot; Nolan replied, &quot;I think I need to teach David here some respect for his elders. It&#39;s pretty obvious I&#39;m buffer, more handsome, and generally better in most ways. He&#39;s just being an immature little bitch about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bitch!?&quot; David responded explosively, hormones related to both sex and aggression interplaying extensively now. &quot;You think you could get on top of all this? Huh? You wanna wrestle me so you can feel how strong I am, isn&#39;t that it?&quot; <br />
<br />
Gus tried to calm it down, &quot;Guys...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You stay out of this!&quot; Both retorted at once, and they started clearing an area, moving anything with wheels out of the way and managing to get a sizable little arena put together there - Ethan watching somewhat mortified as he saw Nolan and David, both wearing their underwear and nothing else, getting ready to wrestle. Nolan had a size advantage, but he hadn&#39;t been young for a long while. David meanwhile seemed to be eagerly anticipating this, grinning like a fool. He had more experience - after all, he&#39;d been in wrestling back in high school!<br />
<br />
Both had full on erections showing in their underwear, and neither seemed to acknowledge how this all might end up...</p>
