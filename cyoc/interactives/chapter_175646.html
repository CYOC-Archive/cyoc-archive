<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">My vision blurred and faded to black. In my last moments I watched as the room expanded to an absolutely enormous size. I had shrunken myself out of existence!<br />
<br />
I felt like I was being squeezed and... stretched? I was tumbling and dizzy and felt very, very wide and then I was split in two! It didn&#39;t hurt, and I still couldn&#39;t see, but I was hearing sounds from two directions at once. As if there were two of me sharing a single mind.<br />
<br />
It made absolutely no sense until my vision sort of returned. And I really mean &#39;sort of.&#39; I could vaguely sense the view in front of me but it wasn&#39;t like I was seeing it with my own eyes. It was more like a vision being beamed into my brain. Make that two visions. I was simultaneously watching the bride and groom say their vows from a seat near the back of the church and ALSO watching the groom&#39;s face, inches in front of me.<br />
<br />
I was the bride? This made no sense. I should be younger than an unborn baby. Not a fully grown woman. But also it seemed like I wasn&#39;t her. I could see what she did and feel what she felt, but I had no control over anything. I was just a passenger. And the same for my other view.<br />
<br />
Just then, the bride turned her head and looked out at the church. Simultaneously, my other vision was blocked by a hand as my host scratched his forehead. The bride could see the man scratching his head and as he lowered his hand I could see the bride FROM the man, as she looked at me and he looked at her. It was the strangest experience ever, to be looking at myself from two different parts of a room!<br />
<br />
My mind spun. What did it all mean? The wish should have made me younger than the baby. Wait. Not just younger, but ONE YEAR younger. What&#39;s one year younger than 39 weeks? Samantha&#39;s mind raced as she realized that she was now a whopping negative-13 weeks old.<br />
<br />
&quot;How can I be negative weeks old?&quot; she thought. After a moment, it hit her. She must be waiting for her parents to conceive her and she was currently experiencing BOTH of their lives until that moment came to be!<br />
<br />
Ok, so half of herself was an egg inside the bride&#39;s ovaries. That means she&#39;ll be the child conceived from this marriage. That&#39;s kind of cool, she thought to herself. But wait. Why was the other half of her vision coming from the back row of the church?<br />
<br />
The answer hit Samantha like a ton of bricks. Her parents weren&#39;t the bride and groom. They were the bride and some random guest at the wedding! Her soon-to-be mother was about to have an affair! An affair that is going to START at her own wedding!<br />
<br />
Samantha was disgusted by the realization, but soon realized that being judgmental would get her nowhere. She needed these two cheating assholes to get together. Her life depended on it!<br />
<br />
She watched the rest of the wedding play out and even got to feel the man&#39;s attraction to the bride. She could also feel the bride&#39;s attraction to the man, whenever he caught her eye. Gross! She was experiencing her future-parents&#39; arousal. Both of them at the same time! She became slightly freaked out as she realized this means she&#39;ll eventually experience the sex act that would create her.<br />
<br />
 At one point in the reception, the bride and the man ended up alone in a coat room and they sloppily made out. Samantha was revulsed and also extremely turned on. She was making out with herself and loving it even as she hated it.<br />
<br />
That kiss would lead to a full blown sexting affair that cumulated in a motel visit 3 weeks later. The bride snuck away one night and met the man and they immediately began making out again. Samantha was once again revulsed and aroused, but mostly she was fearful. It was still too early! She couldn&#39;t be conceived for another 10 weeks. Was the ring getting the wish wrong? What if she missed her chance to get conceived on time and no longer existed?<br />
<br />
Her existential crisis didn&#39;t stop her hosts from having sex, but just before they joined, the man pulled out a condom and sheathed himself.<br />
<br />
As she watched the condom go on from both perspectives, Samantha finally realized what was going on. This was just one of many couplings these two humans would do. All Samantha has to do was wait for the inevitable accident they were going to have.<br />
<br />
Just then the man slid himself inside the woman and Samantha&#39;s eyes would have crossed if she had owned any. Never before had a human experienced the sensation of penetrating a vagina while ALSO being penetrated by the penis at the same time. Every single one of the adult&#39;s movements and pleasures synchronized in her two minds and the pleasure it brought Samantha was beyond explanation.<br />
<br />
Eventually the man exploded inside his condom and, sure enough, Samantha had no sensation of being expelled from his body. The ring was going to stay true to her wish and make sure everything worked out, time-wise.<br />
<br />
But forget that. Samantha just realized she had two and a half more months of fucking herself and she could not wait!</p>
