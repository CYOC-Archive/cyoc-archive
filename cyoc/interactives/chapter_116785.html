<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Peaches and Jen waddled out of Jens Bedroom, said goodbye to her parents and then walked outside and got in the green and red clown car from the circus. They often let their clowns use them. <br />
<br />
But when the were driving along back to the circus. Peaches became a bit sad, she was overjoyed with being a clown but was worried that he relationship with Jason would fail if it was long distance. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jen pull over for a minute, I need to make a phone call.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To who?&quot; Jen said as she chuckled impulsively. &quot;To Jason.&quot; Peaches said as she got out her phone and dialed her her boyfriend Jason. <br />
<br />
Jason Madison picked up his phone, when he saw the caller ID he laughed at it because it was a Peaches the clown, his girlfriend. Not to mention he felt his groin stiffen a little as well. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; Jason said as he wondered what he wondered why she was calling. He knew that she was traveling the country on a circus with her friend Jen the Clown, and he was planning on taking her out for a date later that night, but he couldn&#39;t think of why she was calling. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello baby, it&#39;s me, you sweet Peaches. Literally rally and figuratively.&quot; Jason chuckled a little at this. &quot;I was planning on coming to the show later tonight Peaches. What&#39;s up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well first I wanted to ask you if you could come a bit earlier to the circus, the other think I wanted to ask you is...well...Transform or Dare?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason&#39;s eyebrows arched for a moment, he knew about the curse, and he knew that Peaches was aware of it as well growing up in town until she left to travel with the circus. <br />
<br />
&quot;Umm...both?&quot; Jason asked hesitantly and confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then, we will start with your dare, I dare you to come to the circus as fast as you can, and call...how about...youre cute cousin Micheal an as him him as well to come to the circus with you... we will get to yours transforming when you both get there.&quot; The line then went dead as Peaches hung up on the other end. Jason hung up as well, and then with no control he called his cousing Micheal.<br />
<br />
Micheal and Jason had known one another since they were very young, the two of them were quite close. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its Jason, I&#39;m going to be by your house in a minute, Im going to the circus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Too see Peaches? I thouhgt you were doing that later tonight, our families bought tickets and everything.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I want to go and see Peaches earlier and catch up, but dont worry, Jen is with her.&quot; Jason said with a slight grin since he knew his cousin thought jen was cute and funny. not becasue she was a clown but becasue of her personality.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright I&#39;ll be waiting out front.&quot;<br />
<br />
Half and hour later Jason and Micheal were at the circus door and the two clown girls were there to greet them.<br />
<br />
Peaches practically skipped over to Jason, and gave him a peck on the check as the two for them hugged, to both of them it felt like months since they had seen one another but only Peaches and Jen knew that it had only been yesterday. <br />
<br />
Micheal said hello to Jen and her the same, even before Jen had become a clown she alwyas felt this light interest towards Micheal. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright now Jen just like we planned, go off and take Micheal somewhere for this.&quot; Micheal had a confused look but saw it as Peaches wanted some private time with Jason. &quot;Now, as I was saying before its time for youre transformation. You will become a clown mind body and soul like me, as far as anyone else but me, Jen, Micheal, and yourslef were concerned, you were always a clown. You&#39;ll be a silly zany Auguste like me.&quot; Peaches giggled, &quot;We travel with the circus together still in love as a teenage couple, and as an added bonus you are slightly on the chubby side, but not that much.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason couldn&#39;t move as the words of Peaches ingrained themsleves into his mind and the world around him. He first noticed his skin becoming a ruddy orange, darker than Peaches skin, and white makeup formed around his muzzle and his eyes. the white around his eyes went up to his forehead where his new black eyebrows were there giving him a comical suprised look all the time. He then felt his body begin to change as his feet grew from a size 12 to a size 20 and his shoes gre with them changing until they were a pair of black converse clown shoes. Jasons clothes then began to change into a pair of pants that were green onthe inner half and yellow on the outer half of each pant leg. The fit closely to his waist and his shirt grew until it reached his wrists, the shirt then changed into a blue and yellow striped shirt with cuffs and a bow tie of similiar colors. His hair then began to turn green and he went bald on the top of his head wih slightly curly hair on the edge topped a tiny bowler hat that was slanted to one side. Finally he flet himslef gain gain 40 pounds with his cothes growing to fit. As a final touch his nose turned dark red and swelled into a nose a little smaller than Peaches.<br />
<br />
Finally the knowledge of all his clown life came in, knowlegde of routines, how to iteract with the crowd, and memories of his performances with Peaches. <br />
<br />
Jason, or now Jazzy felt his body unfreeze, saw Peaches smiling, and then kissed her passionately. The clown couple then went inside to get ready for the show that night.<br />
<br />
Now back to Jen and Micheal.<br />
<br />
The Two of them walked inside and went into the supply area were other performers were getting ready, building props, checking supplies and costumes, one was even feeding the animals. Jen and Micheal made small talk while they were walking, the two of them had a connection, they couldn&#39;t explain it but they just had some chemistry.<br />
<br />
When they had gotten to a place where not many people could see them Jen pulled Micheal aside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright now Micheal, there is something I wanted to ask you.&quot; Jen said a little sheepishly but excited.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whats that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Transform of Dare?&quot; Micheal stopped dead in his tracks and looked at jen quizzically. <br />
<br />
&quot;Really?...well...transform I guess.&quot; Micheal didnt believe in the curse, but he thought he should play along because he wanted to impress Jen a little. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okie Dokie then,&quot; Jen said as she giggled and squealed, this was just the perfect opportunity. &quot;You will tranform into a whiteface clown like me. As far as anyone but me, you, Peaches, and Jason have known you were born an clown and the four of us have been traveling with the circus on tour. You still have your older memories of being human, but you love being a clown so much more. As a side bonus you are more silly and brave then you were before.&quot; Jen said as she took as step back and waited for the magic to happen.<br />
<br />
Micheal then watched in astonishment in a nearby mirror as his skin paled to a snow shite color like Jens skin and it went from his head to his toes. Next he saw makeup appear on his face. His lips plumped up into a grin and turned red. Orange and red makeup appeared on his face as his hair turn into a candy blue Afro. His feet grew from a size 11 to a size 24 and they were encased in green clown shoes that went well with his red checkered socks. His clothes were now a jumpsuit that was orange with blue and red polka dots and ruffles on the neck, sleeves, and pant legs. <br />
<br />
Knowledge then pounded into his head. Knowledge of clown gags, routines, jokes and memories of being a clown boy with his cousin Jazzy, and then meeting Peaches and Jen on their first day of touring and just becoming good friends on the spot. <br />
<br />
Micheal, or now Mickey the Clown watched as a final tough of his nose turning red and welling into a large red clown nose. The same size of Jazzy&#39;s. <br />
<br />
Jen and Mickey the locked arms and walked to the dressing room where they met up with Jazzy and Peaches. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is amazing. I&#39;ve always imagined what being a clown would be like but I never thought it would feel this wonderful.&quot; Jazzy said as he looked as his hands and hugged Jen and Peaches together. &quot;So what now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We go on tour with the girls as clown dumb dumb.&quot; Mickey said as he made a silly face at his cousin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet&quot; Jen said as she took a thoughtful and misheavious pose. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet? What else do we need to do?&quot; Peaches said with no idea what her friend was thinking. <br />
<br />
&quot;We now need to get some sweet revenge on Kyle, he started all of this.&quot; Jen Zak as she began planning. <br />
<br />
&quot;But I thought you liked being a clown.&quot; Mickey said a little confused and worried. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I do. And I want to stay this way. But Kyle is most likely going to be here tonight for the show and there we are going to have him join the fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know he&#39;s going to come?&quot; Jazzy said and the two others agreed. <br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t execute an elaborate plan and then come to gloat about it. Like how we broadcasted his embarrassment of panting him last week to the school.&quot; All four clowns chuckled at the thought of what they had done before. &quot;But now first things first, we need to go to rehearsal and get ready for tonight.&quot; The four teenagers all then locked arms and walked as one to the practice arena.</p>
