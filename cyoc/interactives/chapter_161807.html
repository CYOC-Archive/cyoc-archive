<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I was nervous about seeing Joe at breakfast. I didn’t know how we would move on from me seeing him empty his balls on the bed we shared. My mind was so distracted by Joe, the fact that I was meeting the entire family in the dining room completely slipped my mind as I opened those doors.<br />
<br />
The room was incredibly large, with beautifully decorated wallpaper, resembling the African plains, spread across the walls. The wooden floor was so polished, I could see my reflection in it, as the cold surface tickled my feet. Opposite from the entrance stood a breathtaking window, with its intricate frames diligently painted gold. It looked out onto a dense forest, which gathered right beside the front lawn. Quite a long distance away, I noticed a tree that stood much higher than the rest, its trunk glowing as if its roots were on fire. I don’t think I would ever get used to views like these if I lived here.<br />
<br />
In the centre of the dining room stood a table. It was longer than most roads, and it was crafted from what looked like a combination of birch and ebony wood. Two large benches ran alongside it, matching the table’s pattern. The basic craftsmanship of these pieces of furniture certainly looked out of place in such an elegant, and resplendent setting. Still, I approached it nonetheless, and was greeted warmly by Joe’s brothers, all of whom were still naked from their morning jog. They were all staring at the large array of food. Every breakfast food was on that table. A huge pile of eggs and bacon towered over the boys. Muffins. Omelettes. Toast. Sausages. Pancakes. You name it, it was all there, and the smell was irresistible. It was strange witnessing the boys show self-control, as they all waited eagerly for their dads to arrive before they could eat. In the meantime, most of them tried to distract from their hunger, by succumbing to their endless lust. <br />
<br />
When they saw me enter, I could see a few of them rubbing their cocks with anticipation. All of the boys tried to get my attention, flexing their giant frames, or grinding their hips into the table, causing it to shake. They all flirtatiously invited me to worship their bulging frames. I could see one couple fucking each other wildly in the corner of the room, their seed flying onto the cold floor. By this time, I had only just noticed Joe, who was squeezed between Pat and Jim. Their thighs rubbed against his, and their arms were around his shoulders. He looked slightly horrified at their throbbing manhoods, which spurted precum onto their laps like active volcanos. I could see him gag every-time his brothers’ seed landed on his large black hoodie and jeans, staining them. I’ve quickly grown used to the smell of musk and cum in this house. In fact, it turned me on. I could feel my cock stir in my cargo shorts. As I approached the table, Joe looked at me guiltily, his bright eyes still wide with embarrassment. Pat slammed his hand onto my shoulder, massaging it with his thick fingers. Jim gripped his shaft, pumping it slowly.<br />
<br />
“Welcome bro! Glad you could see us au-naturel.”<br />
“Not all of us. Someone here hates family traditions.”<br />
“I don’t care if it’s a tradition. I’m not getting naked just to have breakfast!”<br />
“Aren’t you gonna strip Jamie?”<br />
“Yeah, let me see that cute little ass of yours again.”<br />
<br />
I saw Joe look at me with a twinge of fear. I laughed nervously.<br />
<br />
“I don’t think Joe would want that. Could I just-“ <br />
“Sorry bro, you can’t sit here. Family tradition.”<br />
“You guys love your traditions.”<br />
“Browns here, whites there.”<br />
“Well when you put it like that Jim, it totally sounds like segregation.”<br />
“Why do you do that?”<br />
“I dunno. Father says our people have always done it.”<br />
“Sorry Jamie, can we talk later, in private?”<br />
“You guys gonna fuck or something?”<br />
“NO! For the last time, I’m straight!”<br />
“That’s what they all say.”<br />
“Jamie! You can sit with me!”<br />
<br />
I saw Steve pat the tiny space on the bench next to him. His thighs were spread wide apart, letting his aching balls breathe. That was when I noticed something odd. All of Joe’s blood relatives were huge, gay, and married to an equally large white guy. Even though their marriages are evidently open, not a single one of them was unmarried. Joe really is the exact opposite of them. After everything I’ve seen and heard on this trip, their seating arrangements didn’t shock me. As I walked to the other side of the table, Steve leaned back on the bench, pushing more of his crotch into my view. I squeezed my comparatively tiny frame between his and another giant, who had contorted his body so he could wrap his lips around his cock. He was too busy sucking himself off to notice me. In fact, most of the boys had already moved on, pre-occupied by their own throbbing manhoods. The sounds of their deep moans and grunts filled the air, and my ears. I tried to keep a level-head when in reality I could feel my hormones raging. Suddenly, Steve shoved his bicep into my face, flexing it as hard as he could.<br />
<br />
“I did promise you could feel ‘em. Go on, they’re hungry for it.”<br />
<br />
Without any hesitation, I cupped my hands around his bulging muscle. I could feel sweat trickle down his arm. With my tiny fingers, I explored every part of his bicep, and as he moaned I could see his cock harden. I began to give into my urges, as I moved my hands onto his powerful pecs, stroking the man’s thick chest hair. I shoved my face into his armpit, breathing deeply as I felt his musk flood my nose. It wasn’t long before I was like the rest of them. I stared hungrily at the man’s hardon. As my hands slowly travelled down the man’s thick abs, I looked over to see Joe staring at me. I froze as our eyes met. Except, his eyes weren’t filled with disgust, they were filled with lust. Was he getting turned on by this? Pat and Jim were also watching me worship their brother, as they gripped their meaty shafts and began to jerk off. My attention quickly turned back to Steve, who spoke softly between his pants.<br />
<br />
“Woah, you’re good. Ohhhh- I wish I could fuck you right now.”<br />
“Why can’t you?”<br />
“Because, Father-“<br />
<br />
The doors swung open, causing the room to fall silent. Even the couple fucking in the corner looked up from what they were doing, and as they saw their fathers they quickly joined the table. Aku stood in the doorway, alongside his partner, Dan. Like the rest, they were completely naked. As soon as we laid eyes on their huge, musclebound frames, I saw most of the boys continue to jerk off, only more wildly, and I could see why. Dan fixed his hair as he smiled at his sons, walking slowly to the other side of the table. As he walked past, he placed his hand on my shoulder, winking at me. I tried incredibly hard not at his cock, which dangled to his knees. Once he sat down at his armchair, Joe waved at him, whilst everyone else kept their eyes on Aku. Dan laughed silently, as if he knew that his husband was the main course everyone wanted.<br />
<br />
Aku’s towering 10ft frame stood confidently. As he walked to his chair, we all stared, hypnotised by the 2ft snake that swung between his thick, sweaty thighs. His ass bounced violently with every step. He seemed to relish in the lustful stares from his family. Joe, however, looked firmly at the table, refusing to see his father naked. I, on the other hand, was entranced by the giant as he sat down, causing his chair to creak loudly under the heavy weight of his body. Even though his legs were far apart, the man’s thighs were so wide they were still rubbing against each other, acting as a bed for his balls, which were larger than the muffins on the table in front of me. He rested his hands in his lap, his biceps pressing his mountainous pecs closer together. I thought it was interesting how his bulging frame was hairless, yet his offspring was covered in hair. He ran his fingers along his eight-pack, as he looked at me, smiling. I felt a rush of blood head straight for my cock. Just looking at the man and his incredible physique made me wild with lust. He picked up a large pitcher, and filled it with water. Holding it high into the air, he talked loudly, his booming voice echoing throughout the room.<br />
<br />
“Good morning my sons. Thank you for being with us on such a special time. At midnight tomorrow, our Joseph will turn 18. He is transforming into a man, and such an occasion should be vehemently celebrated. Therefore, it is our duty to make his, and Jamie’s, stay as comfortable and as memorable as possible-“<br />
“-Joe’s refusing to take his clothes off Father! He’s going against tradition!”<br />
<br />
Pat’s sudden interruption made Joe turn white as a sheet, as his brothers glared at him. Aku, sighing, turned his head to his smaller son. I saw the man’s pecs bounce as he spoke.<br />
<br />
“As much as I prioritise your comfort my son, I must insist you follow our tradition. That also applies to you too Jamie. I hope you understand.”<br />
<br />
I suddenly felt incredibly light-headed. My heart was pounding out of my chest. I was hesitant to strip naked in front of my friend, and I’m sure he was even more resistant to the idea. The brothers either side of him smiled menacingly. I felt Steve begin to playfully tug at my shirt. Joe stood up, his trembling voice was quiet, like a whisper.<br />
<br />
“Do I have to?”<br />
“I’m afraid so. You should not feel ashamed, only empowered. Our people do this to feel strong, not weak.”<br />
“Fine.”<br />
<br />
Joe reluctantly lifted his hoodie and shirt off his torso, revealing his torso. A layer of chest hair has sprouted on him, which I knew was not there earlier. His neck was thick, and veiny. A prominent Adam’s Apple poked out from it. His six-pack was a lot more defined. He looked like an amateur bodybuilder. I watched as Jim rubbed his traps encouragingly. Joe slowly unzipped his jeans, trying to get them off. They were incredibly tight, and it looked like they were stuck on his body, as Joe tried frantically to pull them down. Pat rolled his eyes.<br />
<br />
“This is taking too long. I wanna eat!”<br />
<br />
He grabbed Joe’s jeans, and tore them off, leaving the boy naked. Joe turned to Pat, punching him.<br />
<br />
“Dude! Those were my favourite jeans!”<br />
“Woah, Joe, when did your ass get so huge?”<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
He placed his hands on his cheeks, gasping loudly. His butt was a lot bigger. It felt rounder, and more solid under his palms. He couldn’t stop pressing his fingers into his ass. I also noticed his thighs had grown more hair. What was happening to him? I’m not crazy, he really was growing ever since we arrived! I looked on as Jim slapped the boy’s butt, causing Joe to moan. Jim laughed.<br />
<br />
“Bro! It’s huge!”<br />
“But I….I-“<br />
“Jamie? I am sorry but I must insist…”<br />
<br />
<br />
I saw Aku’s eyes shine in my direction. I began to feel sick. My cock throbbed in my shorts as I couldn’t help but glance at Joe’s naked body. Revealing my boner to Joe would be the worst thing to do. Still, I rose from the bench, and gradually unbuttoned my shirt. It was both completely humiliating, and slightly arousing, as I felt everyone’s lustful eyes on me. When I pulled my shorts down, I tried to hide my boner by turning around. I heard the boys mutter as I showed my ass to them, and to Joe, who couldn’t take his eyes off me for some reason. I briskly sat down, hiding my hardon from view as I breathed a sigh of relief. Joe did the same, and as we looked at each other, Aku finished his speech.<br />
<br />
“Thank you. I hope you feel as free as we do. Now then, before we begin, I must inform you that the forest is out of bounds today. No one is permitted to enter under any circumstances…”<br />
<br />
I heard a few boys snicker, as they glanced in my direction. I still looked at Joe, who had turned to look at his butt pressed against the bench.<br />
<br />
“…That is all. Enjoy your breakfast!”<br />
<br />
Almost instantly, the boys lunged for the food on the table, gobbling it up as if they haven’t eaten in years! I saw Joe do the same, picking up a huge pile of bacon and shoving it in his mouth. Slightly disgusted, I reached out to grab a muffin, only to have it snatched out of my hands. I turned to see the boy next to me, who had moved his mouth from his cock to eat.<br />
<br />
“Sorry bro. Gotta be faster next time.”<br />
<br />
I can see why Joe grabbed the bacon the way he did. If you’re not quick, then you go hungry. And that I did. I watched bitterly as the boys finished their plates. My mouth suddenly fell open when I saw Joe fit a whole pancake into his mouth. He was eating way more than he usually does. However, he looked incredibly energetic. I was just surprised he didn’t have indigestion. He certainly had gotten used to being naked, whereas I just felt incredibly exposed. As I sat there, my stomach rumbling, I looked over to see Aku give subtle nods to the brothers either side of Joe, who smiled as they slowly moved closer to the boy. Pat, while Joe was eating, lunged at him, grabbing his flaccid cock. Joe shouted angrily, accidentally spitting his food onto the table. He quickly swallowed his mouthful, still yelling.<br />
<br />
“Woah, what the fuck?!”<br />
“Don’t tell me you don’t want it.”<br />
“BUT I-mmm!”<br />
<br />
Jim had also pounced on the boy, covering his mouth with his lips. Joe’s voice was muffled as Jim aggressively made out with him. Meanwhile, Pat worked his long tongue around Joe’s crotch, licking his ballsack. Joe try to stifle a moan. His cock slowly began to harden from the sensation, as he tried to push Jim away. <br />
<br />
“GET OFF ME-ohhhh-“<br />
<br />
Joe moaned aloud as he felt Pat wrap his lips around the boy’s shaft. Jim moved in to continue the kiss, and this time was met with little resistance. Joe closed his eyes, instinctively put his hands on Pat’s head, thrusting his cock down his throat. In awe of this display, I began jerking off furiously. My mind was flooded with the primal urge to fuck. I felt my hands authoritatively pull Steve’s head into my lap, as he wrapped his lips around my throbbing member. I saw Aku looking at me, smiling wildly, as if he was cheering me on. His monstercock was still soft. I followed Joe’s steps, and pressed my hand firmly on Steve’s head, grabbing his hair. I was so driven by lust I lost control of my body, and my thoughts. I looked up to see Jim had thrusted his giant manhood into Joe’s face, forcing it into his mouth. Joe choked as he was forced to swallow his brother’s endless amount of precum. I felt my blood rush around my entire body, as my vision began to blur. I grabbed Steve’s hair, screaming at the top of my lungs.<br />
<br />
“FUCK! DEEPER, GO DEEPER! ARGHHHH!”<br />
<br />
I never thought I could yell so loudly. The voice that came out of my mouth wasn’t mine; it was much deeper. The walls shook as I let out a bestial roar. I could feel my cum launch down Steve’s throat, who swallowed every drop eagerly. Everyone turned to look at me in awe. I heard Jim moan too, as he blew a load into Joe’s face. Pat then sat up, licking his lips. Joe, amongst the chaos, had emptied his balls into his brother. I could hear the rest of the family cum too, spraying the floors and empty table with their seed. It was like my feral episode had made them all cum. However, whilst I was exhausted, leaning on Steve’s arm as he jacked off, Joe fell to the floor, coughing and spluttering, with Jim’s seed dripping from his chin. His boner had died down, and I could see him shake with anger. Jim reached out, putting his hand on the boy’s back.<br />
<br />
“Bro, are you OK?”<br />
“NO I’M NOT!”<br />
<br />
He stood up, wiping the semen off his ripped body. He glared at Jim and Pat, who was taken aback by his sudden outburst.<br />
<br />
“When will you idiots learn that I AM STRAIGHT! STOP FORCING ME TO BE GAY! It was a mistake to come here, me and Jamie are leaving, TONIGHT!”<br />
<br />
He stormed out of the dining room, as the air grew still. No one spoke. The boys looked at Aku, worried. He, however, didn’t shift his focus away from me, as he grinned, his eyes wide with excitement. Dan quickly got up from his chair, exiting the room.<br />
<br />
“I’ll check up on him. Pat, Jim, you’re coming too. You need to apologise.”<br />
<br />
The two boys sulkily followed Dan, who was talking sternly to Aku as the man leaned back in his chair.<br />
<br />
“I don’t care what your plan is, he is still our son! We shouldn’t try to force our mindset onto him!”<br />
<br />
The atmosphere was tense. I stared, wide-eyed, at Dan as he left. The room was noiseless. Aku was still smiling, as he soothed his pecs.<br />
<br />
“Well, that was certainly eventful. The rest of you, go and get changed. Breakfast is over.”<br />
<br />
We all briskly left the dining room. I felt Steve grab my ass as we walked. However, before I stepped through the large doorway, I heard Aku’s voice boom from behind me.<br />
<br />
“Jamie, stay. There is something I would like to show you.”<br />
<br />
I gulped. I then realised it was just me and him in the dining room, completely alone.</p>
