<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you followed Rowan deeper into the castle, you started to feel different.  With every step taken through the long corridors, it felt as if something was changing about you.  You proceeded along, keeping this in the back of your mind, when you eventually reached a large set of double doors.  &quot;Gannoth, this is my, or now our, bedroom.  Come inside.&quot;  Rowan insisted, filling every single word with power and dominance.  You felt that he could make entire kingdoms bow to him with just his voice.  There was something about it.  It was strong and powerful, yet had charm, eloquence and grace.  You followed him through the doors and came across a sight to behold.  A humongous room centered on a beautiful, dark purple, four-poster bed.  On each side were marble tables with books, candelabras, and places to put jewelry.  You never took a close look at Master Rowan&#39;s hands, but you noticed several rings.  One was pure gold, one was silver with a white band down the middle, one was pure black, and one was a ring with bronze on the top and brass on the bottom, separated by a white and blue band.  To the left of the bed, you noticed a large, empty space, and on the right was a large desk with many scrolls and books scattered on it.  You also noticed a quill, but no inkwells.  Near to the desk were more bookshelves, with comfortable chairs surrounding it.  Back over to the left, past the empty space, there was a door, leading to what you were assuming was the bathroom.  There was another door leading to a closet.  (The door was open, so you could see)  In it were many robes of different colors, all with the roaring dragon and a hint of the purple.  On the wall opposite the desk was a case full of objects that you could tell were magical.  In fact, there was something innately powerful and sinister about Rowan&#39;s rings.  There were also many works of art lining the walls.  &quot;Like what you see?&quot;  Rowan asked, breaking your concentration on looking around the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, very much Master.&quot;  You responded.  &quot;It is a beautiful room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know.  I designed everything myself.&quot;  Rowan chuckled with a sense of pride.<br />
<br />
&quot;But, I don&#39;t see where I will be sleeping.&quot;  You added.  &quot;You did say &#39;our bedroom&#39;, right Master?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is true.&quot;  Rowan smiled.  &quot;I&#39;m glad that you pay attention to every word I say.  It shows that you will be a truly invaluable familiar to me.  Anyway, see that space to the left of the bed?&quot;  Rowan asked, pointing to the empty space you saw before.  &quot;I never knew what to do with that space.  Now, it will be where you sleep.&quot;  Rowan smiled as he started to perform some magic.  The only magic you&#39;ve seen up to this point was the magic he used to turn you into a dragon, and you didn&#39;t really see him do that, as much as experience.  You watched eagerly as Rowan started to wave his hand in the air.  As he was doing this, his hand glowed a light shade of blue.  He continued moving his hand in the air for a couple of seconds, until you noticed something appear out of the corner of your eye.  Out of nowhere, a large dog bed appeared in the empty space.  You were amazed.  &quot;Go on Gannoth.  Try it!&quot;  Rowan smiled.  You walked over to the bed, noticing how it was the perfect size for you, and curled yourself into it.  It was extremely comfortable.  Perfect for you in every way.  &quot;Do you like it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love it Master!&quot;  You smiled toward your master, your newly sapphire eyes twinkling in the candlelight.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad you do.&quot;  Rowan smiled.  &quot;I want my familiar to be comfortable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Master?&quot;  You started.  After noticing the much more comforting atmosphere, you felt that this was the best time to ask about that weird feeling you were feeling.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it Gannoth?&quot;  Rowan asked, pointing his violet eyes in your direction.<br />
<br />
&quot;While we were walking here, I was feeling weird.&quot;  You explained.  &quot;I&#39;m not really sure how do describe it.  It was like I was changing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I know exactly what it is!&quot;  Rowan laughed.  &quot;Kevin is still adjusting to becoming Gannoth.  Within the day, you&#39;ll be used to having a dragon body, and will know how to use it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re saying I&#39;ll be able to fly today Master?&quot;  You perked up excitedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And understand Draconic, the language of dragons and magic.&quot;  Rowan continued.  &quot;It&#39;s already in your mind, it&#39;s a matter of reaching it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s like it&#39;s all hardwired into my brain!&quot;  You smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hardwired?&quot;  Rowan asked confusedly.  &quot;I&#39;m not familiar with that expression.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...  That&#39;s Kevin talking.&quot;  You chuckled.  &quot;It&#39;s a term from my old world.  It means built in.  Already existing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there anything else you would like to know Gannoth?&quot;  Rowan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master.  There is.&quot;  You started.  &quot;Two things actually.  One is simple.  What is with all of the purple?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You could have asked that in a more proper tone, but I understand that it&#39;s not a very easy question to do so with.&quot;  Rowan started, his expression changing from a more happy, playful one to a darker, more mysterious one.  &quot;It&#39;s not as simple as you think.  I was born with these eyes.&quot;  Rowan started, pointing to his violet, powerful eyes.  &quot;Before my 24th birthday, people described them as a rare beauty.  Nowadays, it&#39;s considered cursed to have these eyes.  And it&#39;s all because of me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened Master?&quot;  You asked curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;There was a legend that stated that many years ago, there was a powerful sorcerer.  One who wanted nothing but to spread chaos and terror.  He destroyed many kingdoms, slaughtering thousands.  After hundreds of years of terror, people rose up and defeated him.  They killed his body, but his spirit lived on.  Later on, someone prophesied that he would be reborn.  To make a long story short, I was the one who he was reborn in.  I almost killed my parents in childbirth, until an angel stopped it from happening.  He warned my parents, telling them that I would be the return of that man.  On my 24th birthday, June 6, 666, my magical power awoke inside of my, and was unleashed, killing my entire family, extended and married into.  He spoke to me, trained my magic, and disappeared one year later.  These eyes have been associated with this prophecy, and this power.  Rather than see it as a curse though, I embrace it.  Plus, my old family&#39;s color was this shade of purple.  That and I think it is a nice color.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow.&quot;  You said, amazed.  &quot;I had no idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well now you know.  I didn&#39;t choose to be evil, it was thrust onto me.  However, I find enjoyment in it.  Maybe that&#39;s the old sorcerer&#39;s soul in me, or just how things worked out in the end.  Anyway, you said there was something else?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master.  What are your rings?&quot;  You asked, looking at the four rings on Rowan&#39;s right hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;They are magical rings of power.  Each one represents something different.&quot;  Rowan started.  &quot;Usually, those who use magic specialize in certain types of magic.  I specialize in four, and these rings show that, and amplify them.  The gold represents creation and spacial rendering.  It allows me to create things out of thin air, or seemingly get rid of anything.  That is how I was able to create the bed you love.  It also allows me to &#39;store&#39;, for lack of a better term, things outside of this space.  The silver represents warping.  It&#39;s how I appeared invisible to you, transformed you, and even teleport.  This bronze and brass one represents elemental magic.  It allows me to use fire, cold, lightning, water, air, and many other types of elemental magics.  If you recall, when you transformed, you shot fire in my direction, yet caused no harm to me.  This was due to the ring&#39;s power.  This last one is special.  It represent dark magic.  It specializes in doom, destruction and death.  Complete annihilation.  Without these rings, I will still be quite powerful, but with them, I&#39;m different.  The longer I wear the rings, the more I absorb their essence.  Soon, they will be nothing but decoration.  In fact, this has already happened to one of my rings.  A ring of protection.  It protects me from attacks, making most weapons useless, and making me nearly invincible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow!  How long will the rest take?&quot;  You asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only one more year.&quot;  Rowan replied.  &quot;Their essence is far weaker than when I found them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what about me?&quot;  You asked curiously.  &quot;You said that I&#39;m full of magical energy, but have no idea how to use it.  What kind of magical energy Master?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Two types.&quot;  Rowan started.  &quot;Fire magic and dark magic.  That is what you will learn.&quot;  You gulped, realizing that you&#39;d be learning the darkest, most evil form of magic.  &quot;You also have an ability to sense magical presences in things and people.  That&#39;s how you could tell my rings were magical.  And yet, you did not sense mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s probably to strong for me to even realize.&quot;  You suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, it&#39;s not that.  It&#39;s my power of warping.&quot;  Rowan smiled.  &quot;I&#39;ve been hiding it from you Gannoth.  And the reason is simple.  It&#39;s overwhelming.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean Master?&quot;  You inquired.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll show you.&quot;  Rowan closed his eyes, and you started feeling a strong, powerful presence building in the room.  Everything about it felt dark and evil, and just continued to grow. Eventually, it got so strong that you started to feel uneasy.  &quot;As I said, overwhelming.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s amazing!&quot;  You gasped, feeling yourself regaining your composure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your own is not small either.  It&#39;s only a matter of learning to use it.&quot;  Rowan smiled.  After a few more minutes of sitting in your bed, Rowan sitting next to you petting your head, you perked up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Master.  Something seems wrong.&quot;  You said, looking towards the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.  There&#39;s someone by the castle.&quot;  Rowan&#39;s expression turned angry, his violet eyes burning with rage.  &quot;Gannoth, come with me.&quot;  Rowan started leaving the room.  You quickly got out of your little bed, trying not to damage it with your sharp claws, and followed closely behind your master.<br />
<br />
You made it to the front gate, where you noticed a small band of knights grouping on the other side.  &quot;Rowan Tyrell!  We know you&#39;re in there!&quot;  You heard them yell.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gannoth, let me on your back and fly me over the gate.&quot;  Rowan commanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Master, I&#39;ve never flown before.  I&#39;m not sure if I can.&quot;  You answered in a concerned manner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just try.&quot;  Rowan hissed.  You knew he meant business.  You let him climb up on your back like you were his horse, and noticed that he felt very light.  &quot;Like myself, you are much more physically strong than you look.  Now try to fly.&quot;  Rowan stated as you tried to flap your wings.  In an instant, you were airborne, flying around the grounds of the castle.  On top of that, it felt almost second nature to you.  You flew over the wall and saw the band of knights cowering in fear.  &#39;These guys call themselves knights, and their afraid of a dragon.&quot;  Rowan laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;As well they should be.&quot;  You added.  &quot;Where do you want me to land?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right next to them.&quot;  Rowan answered.  &quot;You&#39;ll be in for a show.&quot;  You were both excited and scared to see what Rowan was about to do.  You landed right where Rowan wanted you to, about 20 feet from the knights.  You could almost taste the fear these knights possessed.  They were shaking violently in their armor, making many clattering sounds.  As you let Rowan dismount, one of the knights tried to inch forward, but was petrified in fear.  &quot;What?  Never seen a dragon before?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;N-n-n-no.&quot;  One of the knights cried, cowering in fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Usually those who try to stop me give a meager fight.&quot;  Rowan chided.  &quot;You&#39;re not even moving.  This is no fun.&quot;  He was right.  You weren&#39;t enjoying this nearly as much as you thought you would.  Rowan, not amused, disappeared, reappearing directly in front of the knights.  &quot;Come on.  At least try.&quot;  One of the knights, after stopping his shaking, walked forward with his sword drawn.  Rowan stood there unfazed.  &quot;Gannoth, watch.&quot;  You heard in your mind.  It was Rowan&#39;s thoughts.  He telepathically sent the message to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rowan Tyrell, your reign of terror is over!&quot;  The knight yelled, raising his sword into the air.  &quot;You and your new pet need to die!&quot;  The knight swung his sword down to Rowan&#39;s head, but was shocked to see Rowan block it with his forearm.  The sword shattered when it hit his arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think so.&quot;  Rowan smiled, straightening the arm he used to block over his head.  You then watched as he waved it in a circle above his head.  Soon, you noticed a cloud form over Rowan.  &quot;You all can die.&quot;  Rowan lowered his hand as lightning poured from the sky, obliterating every knight, leaving you and Rowan completely unscathed.  As you looked at the 5 corpses, you couldn&#39;t help but feel bad for them.  &quot;That wasn&#39;t as good as it usually is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot;  You muttered, looking at the corpses.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gannoth.  You will get used to seeing death.&quot;  Rowan said, trying to comfort you.  &quot;Everyone out there wants to see me dead.  Now, they want to see you dead as well.  Picture that when looking at your victims.&quot;  Rowan patted your head.  &quot;There are more coming.  You can burn them if you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot;  You looked up to your master&#39;s face.  &quot;As you said, I just need to get used to it.&quot;  Sure enough, another knight approached.  Before he could even say a word or do anything, you unleashed your fire breath, completely vaporizing him and some of the ground.  After that though, another person appeared.  He wasn&#39;t a knight like the rest.  He was dressed in dark robes, with a hood covering his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rowan Tyrell.&quot;  The man spoke.  &quot;You must stop.&quot;  You tried to burn him with your fire breath, but when the fire reached him, it was directed up into the air, missing the man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just as I thought.  A wizard.&quot;  Rowan sneered.  &quot;Gannoth, this one will be interesting.&quot;  You noticed the black ring on Rowan&#39;s hand start to glow, gaining a black aura around it.  Meanwhile, in Rowan&#39;s hand, a ball of pure black energy formed.  The wizard looked at Rowan, and threw a bolt of lightning at him.  Rowan held the ball up to block, the ball absorbing the lightning.  The wizard kept trying to attack with lightning, each attempt failing.  After one minute, the wizard stopped, looking exhausted.  &quot;Done yet?&quot;  Rowan asked, laughing.  The wizard looked as though he was preparing a particularly strong spell, as Rowan made another small black ball in his other hand.  He then took the two orbs, and combined them.  It looked unstable, and shot a bolt of pure blackness at the wizard.  Not only did the wizard die, but a small, glowing orb seemed to rise from his corpse.  &quot;Gannoth, remember when I said that if you betray me, you&#39;ll suffer punishments worse than death?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master.&quot;  You replied obediently.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is what I was referring to.  This is that wizard&#39;s soul.&quot;  Rowan stated.  You stood there shocked.  The dark magic that Rowan used and infused you with ripped the soul out of someone.  &quot;When I kill someone with my dark magic, their soul becomes detached from their body, and becomes mine.  Rowan smiled as he grabbed the glowing orb.  You watched as the soul slowly started to disappear.  Rowan then walked over to you, and shoved the rest of the small orb into you.  You felt power rush into your body.  You realized what Rowan meant by &quot;mine&quot;.  He absorbed the soul.  &quot;Next time, Gannoth, I will not be as generous.  If I&#39;m in a good mood, then maybe I&#39;ll share.  Now, you need to learn how to use your magic.  Come with me.&quot;  You followed Rowan back into the castle, walking past the corpses.  &quot;Oh.  I forgot.&quot;  Rowan chuckled as he waved his hand, making the corpses disappear.<br />
<br />
As dusk fell onto the world, so too did a feeling of uneasiness.  Your master was pure evil, and you seemed to be becoming it too.  You witnessed, and participated in a massacre.  Yet, you knew this was nothing.  As you followed your master, you couldn&#39;t help but wonder why you ended up here.  Why you did this.  Why any of this was happening.  But, as Rowan suggested, everyone has their own fate, and you need to accept yours before you can truly understand your life and your purpose.  Rowan accepted his fate long ago.  It was time to accept yours too.<br />
