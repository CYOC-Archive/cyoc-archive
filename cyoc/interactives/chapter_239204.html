<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I know we were discussing the possibility of installing this ‘infinite house’ technology at my place, but honestly it might just be easier for me to move in. You certainly have plenty of space and I got the impression your family enjoys my presence.”<br />
Erika and Mary look at each other and nodded. <br />
“Of course you can stay here, feel free to bring your daughter as well! I know she and Susie have a bit of a rough history, but living here might even give them the chance to make up!”<br />
With Erika’s permission obtained you had one of your clones re-dress and make ready to leave. You did think about doing something about your exponential duplication, but with over a hundred-thousand bodies already you saw little point in stymieing the tide and had no plans on getting rid of any for the time being. It’s not like space or food were concerns anymore, and the app could almost certainly solve any unforeseen problems down the line.<br />
One such problem immediate struck as you were walking down the driveway when you multiplied again from some of your bodies back inside orgasming. The resulting hundred or so clones shredded your outfit as they poured out of your body, leaving you naked. While your were sure walking around naked wouldn&#39;t be to much of an issue in this new reality you’ve made, it was fairly cold out so you opted to see if you can fix this.<br />
“This mother just tore her clothes when she multiplied.”<br />
“This mother just duplicated her clothes when she multiplied.”<br />
Now all of the fresh clones were wearing the same blouse, jacket, sweatpants, and dress-condom combo you had before. You had all of these bodies go back inside however, as you were sure that it would only be a matter of time before you multiplied again and with what was now over a million bodies even having two or three extras could destroy the entire neighbourhood if enough of them came at once. Assured that you don’t need to worry about ruining your clothes anymore, you started making your way back home, both to pack up and to get your—now female apparently—child as well as Consuela.<br />
As you walk however, you are given a chance to see just how much more the world has changed. Most obviously is the fact that, as you expected, there are no men in sight. Every person you pass is a woman, though obviously many are hermaphrodites—their massive, condom-covered, cocks hanging out making it pretty easy to tell. You managed to spot basically every type of change you’ve made present, you even saw a woman with five clones that each had three dicknippled breasts and six arms.<br />
As you were closing in on your house however, you saw one of your neighbours—a woman your age named Lauren—in a threesome. Lauren was now a hermaphrodite, her cock thrusting into a woman on her hands and knees from behind. She had pale skin, long red hair, and blue eyes that were locked on the hermaphrodite opposite her. She sadly lacked any other special traits, unlike the other two women.<br />
The person Lauren was fucking also had pale skin, but she was a brunette with brown eyes. She was wearing the uniform of a postal worker, the shirt was unbuttoned to reveal her breasts and her pants were around her knees. Most notable of all was her three heads, each one sucking on one of the third woman’s trio of cocks. This woman was, as far as you could tell, was Lauren’s husband Trevor, though she probably had a different name now. Her skin and eyes were both a deep brown and her hair was short, black, and curly.<br />
Since you were so close to home anyways you decided to take a moment and improve these three, as a neighbourly gift. You targeted Lauren first, as she was the least interesting.<br />
“Lauren is fucking a woman with her sexy wife.”<br />
Unfortunately this one gave you no real way to change Lauren herself, but it was a good sentence for changing one the others. You think for a bit about what change you would want to make. You have already done quite a bit along the lines of multiplying body parts, and maybe it was time to try something else. After a moment of thought you think of an idea: the only part you really haven’t multiplied were legs so why not make an edit that does that while also changing things up a bit.<br />
“Lauren is fucking a woman with her centaur wife.”<br />
You watch as the woman that had been Trevor’s shoes fade away as her feet turn into hooves. Grey fur spreads up her legs as they morph into the thick hind legs of a horse. Her trio of cocks—alongside her massive ballsack—grow even more massive, possibly larger than your own three-foot monster, as they turn properly equine in shape. A second pair of hooves push out of her hips, attached to a set of tauric shoulders that shot outwards to create a horse body. With her mouth longer form, the centaur was able to make out with her wife as they fucked, the woman beneath her now struggling to take the giant horsecocks fucking her throats.<br />
“The woman Lauren is fucking is half conscious as she deep throats three horsecocks.”<br />
You tired targeting Lauren again but got another sentience better for changing the postal worker. Deciding to roll with it again you keep on with the theme of mythological creatures, making a change based on her three heads.<br />
“The cerberus Lauren is fucking is half conscious as she deep throats three horsecocks.”<br />
With the change confirmed, the postal worker’s heads began to transform into dog-like muzzles, a coat of pitch-black fur covering them. Once her heads were fully canine the fur cascaded down her body. As it reached her chest her breasts grew noticeably bigger and shifted forwards to just out in front of her. Her arms lengthened into animalistic forelegs, her back shifting to lock her in a quadrupedal stance. Her legs transformed as well, with three canine tail also forming above her behind. Her body also grew a larger, her back now pressing into the centaur’s underside.<br />
“A hermaphrodite is having sex with two mythical creatures.”<br />
With the other woman now transformed, you once again target Lauren. This time you get something you can use to transform your neighbour. Of course you can change “hermaphrodite” into whatever you want but, feeling a little spicy you make a different change.<br />
“A hermaphrodite is having sex with fellow mythical creatures.”<br />
With such a vague change, you’re eager to see what becomes of Lauren as she changes. Like her wife, her transformation begins with her feet becoming hooves. The fur that grows up her legs is more shaggy than the centaur however, more goat-like then horse-like. Her cock also becomes an equine shape, though it doesn&#39;t grow much bigger as it changes. The fur stops growing at her hips, but she doesn’t grow another set of legs. Instead her head sprouts a pair of curly horns, making it abundantly clear she is now a satyr.<br />
Ultimately Lauren is still the least interesting one, so you consider making another change to her. As your about to however, some of your clones back at Erica and Mary’s house orgasm and you suddenly multiply again. What must be several hundred copies of yourself are now standing in the street, a fact that draws the attention of your targets.<br />
“Oh hey! Seems like someone was having fun watching, huh?” Lauren, still pounding away at the cerberus calls out to you.<br />
“How about you come join us instead of standing there! I’m sure we have room for a few of you.” The centaur flicks her tail up, offering her equine pussy to you. <br />
No one to decline such an offer (at least not after today) thirty of your clones go up to join them while the others start the trip back to the house. The one still holding the phone slips away however, but not before doing one last change.<br />
“This satyr is imagining the impossible feat of her pleasuring all of your clone’s cocks”<br />
“This satyr is imagining the possible feat of her pleasuring all of your clone’s cocks”<br />
Now equipped with twelve sets of arms, ten rows of three vagina-nipple capped breasts on both her front and back, and two thick, prehensile tails that split into three heads each; Lauren monopolizes all of your clones to herself, causing her wife to stomp her hooves in jealousy. You have one of the clones going home turn back to triple-stuff the centaurs horse-pussy while the body with the phone jogs over to your house.</p>
