<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You allow yourself to be led up to your room and their you help Matty search through your now transformed clothes and suitcases. After about twenty minutes of searching, most of which includes putting your clothes away, Matty says that your mom probably forgot your swimsuit, something your not sure if you should be happy about or upset about.<br />
<br />
As you are hanging up a dress in the closet, Matty tells you, &quot;That's okay. I'm sure your Uncle can buy you a new one if you want. Or, this is Europe. I know a nice quiet beach where we can go skinny dipping. Hardly anyone ever shows up, except a couple of woman a little older then me.&quot;<br />
<br />
You look at her, wondering if she is serious about skinny dipping. Nodding slowly and telling her, &quot;I'll think about it,&quot; you decide she must be serious and instead head out of your room.<br />
<br />
Downstairs, you run into Uncle Jack, who is heading into the front of the shop. Looking at him, you tell him in a quiet sort of voice, &quot;Mom forgot to pack a swimsuit,&quot; to which he nods at this and withdraws his wallet and then hands you a bit of money to buy yourself a new swimsuit, something you are not sure about.<br />
<br />
Behind you Matty has come down the stairs and looking at her, you tell her, &quot;Always keep our options open,&quot; as you put the money into your pocket.<br />
<br />
Matty takes your hand and both you and her wave goodbye as you leave the house. Walking down the street, you notice that even the way you walk and hold yourself has changed. Wondering what you should tell your Uncle tonight at dinner, you instead look over at Matty and ask her, &quot;Can I do both? Buy a swimsuit and go skinny dipping? I've never down it before and I would like to have a go at it at least once.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matty smiles at you and then answers, &quot;Of course. Everyone should try it once in their lives,&quot; to which you giggle, but are kind of unsure why.<br />
<br />
Stopping at a store, Matty shows you the area with the bathing suits and then helps to pick out one that fits. In the end you purchase, in your opinion, a rather skimpy bikini that is rainbow coloured and fits a seven year old girl. Matty explained, as you tried it on, &quot;You've got a great body and you are in great shape. Why not show off your body,&quot; to which you replied that you're only nine and Matty said, &quot;So,&quot; but didn't say anything else.<br />
<br />
The beach Matty spoke of was indeed isolated and both you and her had to hike through a small woods before arriving at the beach. There Matty, who it turned out wasn't wearing any underclothes, took off her dress and dove right in.<br />
<br />
You hesitate at first, unsure if this is appropriate, but in the end you drop the bag holding the bikini and reaching behind, undo the button to your pants. Shucking off all your clothes, tail and whiskers twitching, you run to the water and dive in, surprised at how it feels against your body. Treading water, you ask, &quot;Are you sure no one will see us?&quot; Matty nods as way of answering and begins to slowly swim out doing a back stroke.<br />
<br />
A couple of hours later you are lying on the beach completely nude and enjoying the sun against you naked body. Every once and awhile you spread you legs, liking the heat from the sun on your privates. Matty is lying next to you, not saying a word. Looking at her, you ask quietly, &quot;If I have to grow up as a female, what do I have to look forward to?&quot;<br />
<br />
Matty remains silent for a moment and then she reaches over a picks up her dress and looking at it, tells you, &quot;I don't really now. I went from being a lizard, something I can barely remember, to being a twenty something year old woman and that was about six years ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
You sit up and reach over and grab your pants. Matty, who is still looking at her dress, continues. &quot;I now that girls begin puberty around nine, ten or eleven, somewhere in that age range. Your breasts will begin to develop, your body will begin to take on a more feminine appearance, notably in the butt, hips, waist and an hourglass figure. For you, if you continue the ballet, you'll probably be tall, but petite. Around eleven or twelve, hell maybe even as late as sixteen, you'll get your first menstrual and later you will have the option of having a baby. I read this after my transformation. This and more. If you like, I can show you the books.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod at this offer, wanting to know more about the life you have just been thrust into. Sliding your pants on, you stand and reaching behind, you fix the button on your pants that is just above your tail. Looking at Matty, you ask, &quot;Are all pants this tight or is just mine,&quot; to which Matty shakes her head, chuckling silently.<br />
<br />
After that, the two of you take in a movie and then wander about town, Matty showing you several different places and sights. Afterward, you return back to your Uncle Jack's place for dinner.<br />
<br />
It is during supper that Jack, as he said he would, asks you if you want the memories back of your female self or if you would rather try living as a girl with your original memories. You sit for a minute, chewing and then finally you ask, &quot;Can I sleep on it? I really don't have an answer right at the moment, because I think it might be such a big decision.&quot;<br />
<br />
Uncle Jack nods at this and tells you, &quot;I think that's reasonable. Matty, do you mind hanging around her some more while I take care of some things in the shop?&quot;<br />
<br />
Matty says she doesn't mind and secretly you are glad. After dinner, Matty shows you the books and the two of you spend the evening going through them, learning about life and how a girl sees and deals with it. Afterward, you say your going to take a shower and head for bed.<br />
<br />
Inside your room, you select from your suitcases your hygiene supplies, wonder about your answer and then head for the shower. Inside, you learn quickly that washing as a girl is a lot different then washing as a boy. First your hair; shampoo and then condition. Afterward, you wash your face using a specific washrag and a cleanser that both moisturizes and cleans. Your body is washed with a sponge and another cleanser that also moisturizes and cleans and the only thing you find disturbing is washing your privates, which are now between your legs instead of out front.<br />
<br />
Afterward, you dry your hair and then wrap it in a towel. Next you apply a cream to your face and then drying your body off, you wrap the second towel around your body. Back inside your room, you remove the towels, dropping them in hamper. Next you take a once piece pair of pajamas and slip into them, realizing as you do so that you like how soft they are against your naked skin.<br />
<br />
Climbing into bed, you lay there thinking, slowly drifting off to sleep, listening to the night sounds of Greece. Come morning you'll have your answer for Uncle Jack and it will be yes to him restoring your female memories and removing your current memories. &quot;It's just to much of a hassle to live as girl with the memories of growing up male,&quot; you tell yourself as you drift off to sleep.</p>
