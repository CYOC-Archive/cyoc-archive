<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan nickered, whinnied and stamped his hooves as he felt a warmth that he thought seemed to start in his nether regions and spread from there. Unable to stop himself, he shifted uncomfortably and neighed again loudly his need, his desire, in trying to call for a mate. Feeling these odd, alien sensations, he asked himself, &quot;Shit. Is this how a girl feels when she is turned on,&quot; as he neighed out his want for a hard horse cock to satisfy him, alarmed by how it felt like every nerve alone his vagina, and the surrounding area, seemed to buzz, to twitch, in a sensual way as his cunny flexed and his female juices flowed, making it slick and ready.<br />
<br />
In front of him, the three woman continued to smile and look at him, almost as if they were studying him. Hating them and what they did, Ryan wanted to attack them, but his body and mind had other ideas. Trying to move forward, he instead took several steps backward. Feeling the wooden wall of one the stalls pressed into his backside, he began to move his hips and tail in an attempt to masturbate as he pressed, rubbed and engaged in other motions in an attempt to sate his need. Watching this, the three woman giggled and as the brown haired one commented, &quot;She really is in heat. And need,&quot; they divided, with the blonde going to his left, the brown hair to his right and the redhead stepping forward.<br />
<br />
The two women on either side of him each started to pet and rub his side. Liking this, but still continuing to try and satisfy his new body&#39;s need, and not succeeding, Ryan listened as the redhead explained, &quot;Be still for a moment and know that this is a form you are deserving of,&quot; and as Ryan first stopped moving he tried to nicker out that he didn&#39;t deserve be turned into a mare. Unable to do that, as all he ended up doing was neighing out his need for a stallion, he watched the woman in front of him as she smiled and continued on.<br />
<br />
&quot;My sisters and I have heard the calls, the cries, the wishes, of those you have hurt with your behaviour. They cry out on how you act like your some hot stud, that just because you are of some importantance for your American football team, The Stallions, that it gives you the right to act like a colt who is able to have his pick of the herd. To love anyone and leave them, like they were some trophy to be acquired. We have heard these cries and when you came upon us here, we acted. You want to behave in such a manner, we granted it. But with a twist. We decided, as it were, to put horseshoe on the other hoof. We gave those that cried out against your behaviour exactly what they wanted, you, walking in the footsteps of someone who will learn the needs of the female and what it feels like to be loved and left by a male who only sees you as someone to sate a need.<br />
<br />
&quot;But do not fret. We aren&#39;t entirely cruel to leave you in such a way were your mind is still that of a human male, whilst your body is that of a mare. No. We have something better. We have many sisters and one trio&#39;s actions against a moose hunter gave us an idea. We will leave you with the mind of a horse, but deep inside that, you will still have you human mind. You will be aware that every action you perform will be guided by what seems and feels right. Those deeds that only a horse would know and do. Think of it as if your primary mind is that of the mare, whilst your secondary mind is that of a human male.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan, horrified by what he was being told, tried to scream out for someone to help him, but all that came out was a series of nickers and shrill whinnies. Still unable to move, he watched as the redhead ran a finger down his muzzle, crooning and purring a tune as she did. As a sort of fog began to settle over his mind he tried to fight it, and instead felt like he was slipping away until it seemed like he was caught between a sense of dozing, semi-conscious of the world around him, but unable to act. His high thoughts slowly lowered one by one until all that was left was the sense of wanting to eat, to sleep, to find a stallion to satisfy her need. Dimly, she was aware that she really wasn&#39;t a horse, but something else. What that was, it didn&#39;t seem very important and neighing out her need, she pricked her ears up and listened for an answering call.<br />
<br />
The blonde and the brown head, who could see this in Ryan&#39;s eyes, smiled some more as stepped away and headed back to the stall they had been sleeping in. The redhead the only one left, she continued for a moment to run a finger up and down the mare&#39;s muzzle, humming out the same tune. After a bit, she began to lead Ryan. The loud noises the horse kept making didn&#39;t really bother her, despite that they were right in her ear often and upon reaching the large stable door, she stopped and reached for it. Pushing and pulling, she slid it open, revealing not a rain-soaked driveway, but rather an open field lit up by a full moon. Off in the distance she could see a herd of horses and a string of ponies, some resting, some walking about, cropping at the grass. Nudging the mare, the redhead gave Ryan one final pat as the mare stepped over the threshold and out of the stable, neighing loudly, eagerly, as she did. Listening as a couple of the horses, and ponies, answered the call, the redhead slid the door the shut, sealing the Ryan in the mysterious world she&#39;d been transported to.<br />
<br />
Oblivious to the fact that she had been transported to another dimension, Ryan began to gallop over to the herd of horses. Her need for a strong stallion worse then ever, she neighed excitedly. Smelling the other horses, the ponies, she shook her head, neighed again and began to present herself when she got close enough. Dimly, far in the recesses of her mind, a teenage boy cried out this wasn&#39;t right, even as a part of him strongly insisted it was. And when Ryan felt first the heavy body of the horse come down on her back, then the probbing of the male&#39;s erect cock, she knew that she was truly good and lost as her body surrendered to its primal needs. Starting to thrust inward, Ryan had only a brief moment of alarm at how good it felt to have a dick pushed into his slick folds before the mare&#39;s instincts took completely over and she began enjoying this as her need was finally sated.</p>
