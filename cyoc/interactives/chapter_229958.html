<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She... rather, now he blinked a couple of times as he finally moved. S/he then screamed. “What the fuck?” The words came out so much higher pitched and incongruous to the young boy who shouted them that Jeff had to hold back his laughter. “Is this fucking funny to you?” Jeff’s girlfriend-turned-boyfriend continued, fists clenched into tiny balls of rage.<br />
<br />
“I mean, yeah, a bit,” Jeff laughed. He held a hand out above his head to show just how short the young man had become. “I mean, look at you, Erin.” The older man’s eyes roved over the young boy, taking no care to hide where his interests lay.<br />
<br />
Erin stepped back, hands instinctively covering a chest that he no longer had. “What the fuck,” he repeated, quieter this time. “This is what you wanted? THIS?” Suddenly realizing how exposed he was allowing himself, Erin shrunk down and covered his tiny genitalia as much as possible. “Are you sick? You could have anything and you made me look like this?” Tears welled up in the boy&#39;s eyes, quickly dribbling over to roll down his cheeks.<br />
<br />
“Oh, come on, there’s nothing wrong with this.” Jeff took a step toward Erin, causing the boy to backpedal, quickly feeling the wall against him. “It’s just… pure fantasy, y’know? You’re still you in there. You can consent. We’re not hurting anyone.”<br />
<br />
“It IS still me in here!” Erin shouted back, his voice already hoarse with emotion. “Consent? Not hurting anyone? How long have you-” He stopped suddenly and inclined his head up towards his boyfriend. “Change me back. I don’t want this. I don’t want to be a part of this.”<br />
<br />
Now it was Jeff’s turn to step back as his face shifted between emotions - confusion, fear, and finally anger. “But you said-”<br />
<br />
“Well I’m changing my mind! I didn’t sign up to be… to be… whatever the fuck this is for you.”<br />
<br />
Erin’s tiny chest heaved as tears continued to roll down his cheeks and his breath came in short gasps. The prepubescent boy dropped into a squat, trying to cover his body as much as possible. All the while, Jeff stared down at his former girlfriend and felt all of his excitement fleeing from him, replaced with resentment. “No.” Erin’s head whipped up to stare at Jeff in shock, but the older man kept speaking. “I’m not changing you back until I get what I want.” Jeff started to advance toward the young boy, causing Erin to press himself against the wall, his hands splaying out against the cool surface.<br />
<br />
“I’m not… I… I’m not…,” Erin’s eyes darted around the room before he quickly lunged up at Jeff, lighter than he’d felt in years and threw his head into the man. Unfortunately, the nearly 30 year-old man didn’t have only size on the young boy, but strength as well, and quickly caught Erin by the shoulders and spun him around towards the bed. Erin scrambled, all thoughts of decency fleeing his mind as he fell from the sheets and scrambled along the floor before seizing one of Jeff’s shirts and an old stick of deodorant. He flung it at Jeff with all the might his little arms could allow and tried to run for the door.<br />
<br />
Jeff covered the distance between them within two strides and grabbed up the squirming Erin before he could escape. Tears clouded the former woman’s eyes now as he thrashed, trying to get his tiny boy body to break free of Jeff’s grasp. His boyfriend, Jeff, smiled and kissed his cheek and Erin saw his chance - quickly whipping his head to the side and slamming into his attacker’s nose.<br />
<br />
With a shout, Jeff dropped his once lover, now child prey and Erin went tumbling to the ground, coming up quickly enough to throw open the door and dart out of what was once his home. In the dark of night outside, his little legs pumped while he threw on the shirt he had stolen in his escape and tried not to picture Jeff stalking behind him. The muscles in his legs burned and his lungs felt like they were going to burst. Everything was larger and the darkness did nothing to help Erin feel safe. Jeff’s shirt was oversized, but still felt like it did nothing to hide his naked body.<br />
<br />
He ran and ran until he collapsed under a park bench, shivering and crying and overexerted and betrayed and…<br />
<br />
Time passed with Erin huddled up and crying, trying to piece everything together before the preteen boy pushed himself to his feet and worked through his next steps. He still kept an apartment separate from Jeff - something his former boyfriend was always against, but now seemed to save his life. Head low, the little boy walked towards where he used to get ready for his dates, watch cheesy movies alone with a bottle of wine, and even jill-off his old female pussy when he had been fighting with Jeff. <br />
<br />
The walk was long, but Erin felt numb. The trip felt like no time at all. After getting his spare key from beneath the fake rock, he pushed open the door into a world that felt like it belonged to a stranger. Everything was just as he had left it, but felt so much larger and out of reach. The shadows in the building seemed to hide new terrors as he closed the door and slammed the lock into place. He looked up at the deadbolt and sighed. He dragged a chair out from the dining room and stood on it to reach the high-up lock.<br />
<br />
Broken and defeated, Erin went to his bed and - after pulling himself up - collapsed in a crying heap. Was he stuck like this? Could only Jeff turn him back? What the hell had just happened? How was he going to continue living like… like a little boy? Before long, sleep took hold of Erin’s exhausted boy body.</p>
