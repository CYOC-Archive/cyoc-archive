<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>There are many thoughts and emotions swirling within me. It brings me immense joy to witness others carry on my story and explore the expanded realm of possibilities that unfold within the skill panel. While their accomplishments and abilities are truly exhilarating and awesome, my story will remain centered around the unique power of Possession, the sole cheat I possess (pun not intended).<br/>
And I want to say that my mainstream of story will continue with meek and light-hearted tone. </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I had some decisions to make, but there was no urgency. So, I took my time thinking carefully about what to do next.<br />
<br />
Despite the agony had subsided, my new body still felt sore and unpleasant. I was sweating profusely, which suggested my immune system was working hard. Given this physical reaction, a disturbing thought crossed my mind - could this be a sign of a fever? While unsettling, I hoped that whatever was happening wouldn&#39;t cause any long-term issues.<br />
<br />
As I remained in thoughtful state, an increasingly intense warmth enveloped me, accompanied by a surging pulse and a rising sensation of restlessness. I couldn&#39;t stay still. I assumed my wolf-like body was retaining heat under the slicer fur, but it didn&#39;t make sense given that this body had been wearing a tunic for a long time, which itched on my flesh now, and I found myself struggling to get comfortable. The bizarre situation perplexed and unnerved me.<br />
<br />
The heat washed over me, causing my breath to become heavy and my mouth to feel parched. I found myself panting, mirroring the instinctive response of a canine, as I sought to cool myself down. My tongue hung out, lolling from my mouth. Each pant was accompanied by a desperate need for relief, a longing for a respite from the rising warmth that enveloped my being.<br />
<br />
If I had a fever, I should have felt hot and then cold, but instead I felt great warmth all over my body. It felt like my blood was rushing through me, and oddly enough, I felt strangely powerful, almost proud.<br />
<br />
As the fabric of my clothes clung tightly to my skin and fur, a sense of restriction and unease grew within me. The discomfort intensified, and I could feel myself becoming increasingly irritable. Unable to bear the constriction any longer, I hastily removed my garments, seeking relief and freedom.<br />
<br />
In my haste, while removing my trousers, a fortuitous accident occurred. My hand brushed across my groin, and in that fleeting moment, a rush of sensation coursed through me. My eyes dilated, captivated by the intoxicating feeling that emanated from that area. It was a moment of undeniable pleasure, almost overwhelming in its intensity.<br />
<br />
As if in response to the surge of delight, waves of heat and blood gathered at my crotch, creating a powerful and alluring warmth. It was as if the very essence of desire and passion had concentrated in that one spot, captivating my attention and igniting a primal yearning within me. <br />
<br />
I was overtaken by an intense wave of arousal. It felt as if my senses were heightened to an extraordinary degree, making it near impossible to consider the cause of this unusual state. The thought crossed my mind to question what my host might have drunk, or to check for any labels on those empty flasks lying nearby. However, my mind was too preoccupied to delve into such matters at that moment.<br />
<br />
My cock got hard rapidly, and I feel fluids dripping eagerly from the tip, soaking my loincloth with a large spot.<br />
<br />
My body reeked of ruts as my genitals continued to be engorged and my libido heightened. The air around me carried the unmistakable essence of my lupine nature, calling for a mate. Surprisingly, rather than being indifferent like before, I found myself inexplicably drawn to this rich wolfish musk that enveloped me.<br />
<br />
The surge of arousal flooded my consciousness, rendering it difficult to concentrate on anything else. Thoughts of sex consumed my mind, intertwining with my own desires and fantasies. The primal essence within this body stirred, beckoning with an intensity that surpassed anything I had ever experienced before.<br />
<br />
A profound longing arose, a yearning for the embrace of instincts, urging me to heed its call. The allure was irresistible, drawing me to take action. And I eagerly followed, tear off my loincloth, letting my fat lupine cock come out from its tight tent.<br />
<br />
I should feel weird, wrong, show off my cock and balls in public, even when no one is around. But it didn&#39;t bother me, and shame didn&#39;t cross my mind for having such extraordinary qualities.<br />
<br />
A voice echoed in my mind, reprimanding me with a mix of anger and embarrassment. However, driven by lust, I extended my padded paws and tentatively groped this beast. Which the voice ceased its scolding and transformed into a shared moan of pleasure.<br />
<br />
I gazed in awe at the sheer size and grandeur of the sheath that now graced my being. <br />
<br />
&quot;Massive, Majestic,&quot; I whispered. At the pinnacle, a crimson-red rocket extended proudly towards the sky, tinged with the hue of fresh blood. Below, nestled in the sheath&#39;s embrace, were two nuts that swirled an abundance of alpha cum, producing splashing sounds that resonated with the keen sensitivity of my wolf ears when I examine them.<br />
<br />
A profound sense of satisfaction washed over me as I idly playing with my cock and balls. The tactile experience of seeing, holding, and caressing them was nothing short of exhilarating, it would be such a waste if it wasn&#39;t used to fuck and spread my seed onto a mate. However, circumstances dictated that, for the time being, I had no choice but to revel in and appreciate these newfound genitals on my own.<br />
<br />
Use dripping pre-cum as lubricant, I started rubbing my pointy large cock with one paw, while the other paw caressed my larger wolfish body, trying arousing the sensitivity of every inch of my skin.<br />
<br />
I began by gently playing my nipples, hoping to evoke a pleasurable sensation, but to my surprise, they didn&#39;t seem to be a particularly sensitive area on this new body. Undeterred, I shifted my focus to the unique wolf-like features I now possessed. I lightly massaged my ears, feeling their delicate texture and noticing how they twitched in response. Moving down to my muzzle, I traced my fingers along its contours, savoring the unfamiliar sensation.<br />
<br />
As my hand continued its exploration, it eventually reached the connection point between my spine and tail. A surge of unprecedented excitement rippled through my body, causing a tingling sensation that sent shivers down my spine. The intensity of these newfound sensations was so overwhelming that my whole body trembled, teetering on the verge of losing balance and toppling onto my hips.<br />
<br />
That’s the spirit! I sat with my fluffy ass, both paws ignited the burning desire in their hearts. The paw that held my cock stroked it in a steady, rhythmic motion, gradually picking up speed. With each stroke, my ragged breaths mingled with a low, gurgling growl that emanated from my elongated muzzle. The stimulation commanded my body to respond, causing me to involuntarily buck forward, further intensifying the piston-like movement.<br />
<br />
My tongue playfully lolled from one side of my mouth, mirroring the growls and huffs that escaped my lips. I breathed in the intoxicating rush of my own sexual hormones, feeling them course through my veins, igniting a surge of lust within me, propelling me into a state of heightened awareness and hyperactivity.<br />
<br />
Despite the size of my new wolf-like paws, I soon realized that they were not sufficient to fully massage and attend to the entirety of my even bigger genitals. As a result, my ball-sack were left dangling, yearning for the same level of attention and care that the other parts were experiencing.<br />
<br />
A mix of frustration and desire welled up within me as I grappled with this limitation. Desperate to cum, I released my tail and used both my hands to stimulate and pleasure every aspect of my genitals.<br />
<br />
With a gentle touch, I began to massage my heavy balls, feeling their weight in the palm of my hand. I rolled them between my fingers and was amazed by their firmness and sensitivity, even within the soft fuzz that sheathed them. When I applied pressure, they obediently lifted up, proudly displaying their presence and offering an incredibly intense sensation. My enjoyment was heightened to an amazing level as the combo pleasure throughout the crotch.<br />
<br />
Inch by inch, my wolf cock expose more in my grasp. As I felt something massive pushing out, my sheath grew larger. The base begins to swell, and the growth, now visible because the sheath had been completely gone back was a knot. My wolfish bulbus glandis is three times the size of my cock.<br />
<br />
I gingerly cradled it in my paws, my touch tentative as I sought to find the perfect rhythm. The sensation that washed over me was beyond words—so good, so pleasurable, and so utterly incredible! Each stroke, each caress, sent waves of pure bliss coursing through my body, electrifying every nerve ending.<br />
<br />
My hips convulsed with wild abandon, moving in sync with the electric rhythm of pleasure that consumed me. My tail wagged uncontrollably, a physical manifestation of the sheer ecstasy coursing through my body. With a frenzy of movement, my hand stroked with fervor, matching the intensity of the sensations that overwhelmed me. <br />
<br />
In that moment, I surrendered to the blissful chaos, embracing the exhilarating pleasure that enveloped me, leaving me breathless and consumed by pure, unbridled ecstasy. The presence of another soul within my body resonated with the same ecstatic sensations, as if it were a harmonious symphony of pleasure. The shared experience intensified our desires, commanding an urgent release from the pulsating waves of pleasure that consumed every fiber of our being. <br />
<br />
I tensed my entire body, summoning all my strength for one final, strong tug on my edging wolf cock. Together, we unleashed a howl of pure bliss, an undeniable expression of the orgasm engulfed us, and thick ropes of essence erupted from within, shooting high into the air like vibrant tendrils. They spread out and gracefully showering the land and the tree with nourishment.<br />
<br />
As pleasure envelops my senses, my tongue lolls out in a blissful surrender, a visible sign of the euphoria that courses through my being. The sensations penetrate deep into my wolfish body, causing delightful shivers to ripple across my skin. Despite the intense ordeal that should have left me utterly drained, I am surprised to find myself still brimming with energy, a clear indication that my orgasms is far from over. The end of the first one just fuels my lust.<br />
<br />
I looked at my cock and balls, there is no sign of softening, my throbbing cock didn’t lose its vigor, it only got more sensitive. And I can already sense the anticipation building within me, a tingling awareness of an impending second round of ecstasy. The tingling sensation from my cock continued to reverberate through my body. My host and I shares the same hunger, craving for an intensified experience, resounding with a fervent desire for more. <br />
<br />
The collective longing to continue is insatiable, an unstoppable force propelling me forward. There will be no respite until I have completely emptied my balls, until every last drop of pleasure has been released, leaving me utterly spent and exhausted.</p>
