<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Molly wasn&#39;t happy being sent to a girls boarding school. She couldn&#39;t blame her parents though. Breaking into her Dad&#39;s liquor cabinet then substituting liquor for lemonade at her cousin Emma&#39;s birthday party had been the final straw. With 15 ten year old girls vomiting all over her aunts house then being caught with the vodka bottle in her handbag she couldn&#39;t deny that she was guilty.<br />
<br />
She had been sent here as punishment, with the promise that if she could behave herself for 1 year her Dad would reconsider. She had to get at least an average of &quot;B&quot; grade in her studies and not do anything that would warrant a suspension. The problem was Molly hated study and could not go a week without misbehaving. At her last school she had clocked up at least 1 suspension every semester.<br />
<br />
The rules here seemed draconian. She had to wear the compulsory school uniform at all times - a stupid pleated skirt over grey tights and a white blouse with a bow on it and wasn&#39;t even allowed out of the school grounds unless accompanied by &quot;someone responsible&quot;. <br />
<br />
She had only arrived at the school that morning. That was thanks to sabotaging Dad&#39;s car the previous day. They were meant to arrive yesterday for &quot;Orientation day&quot; but thanks to filling Dad&#39;s petrol tank with water he couldn&#39;t drive her the 100 miles to this school. Everything had been a bit of a rush this morning. Her fuming father had not said a word to her during the two hour drive in a hired car this morning. Mum had been talkative and kept telling Molly that this was for her own good. Evidently this school had a reputation for turning out young ladies of distinction and Molly should be grateful for the opportunity. Neither of her parents noticed that Molly had removed the cash from her Mum&#39;s purse but what did the stupid woman expect when she put her handbag on the back seat beside Molly.<br />
<br />
Anyway Molly and her parents had been escorted to her room by someone from the front office who thought herself important. Her Dad lugged Molly&#39;s suitcase, full of school uniforms and little else. In the dormitory they were introduced to Mrs Shaw, her boarding house mistress, who showed them the tiny room that was going to be Molly&#39;s home for the next year. At least she had a room to herself but was going to have to share a bathroom with 8 other girls. Her Dad dumped the suitcase in the room and reminded her that this was &quot;Your last chance&quot;. Her Mum started crying when she gave Molly a hug goodbye and blubbered something about missing her sweet little baby before being dragged away by her father.<br />
<br />
She had immediately taken a dislike to Mrs Shaw. The first thing the woman had told her once her parents had left was &quot;The dye job and the nose ring have to go. I&#39;ll make a booking at my hairdressers for this afternoon&quot;. Then she insisted Molly put on her school uniform and ran through the rules Molly was expected to abide by. Mrs Shaw had then walked her to her first class and left her to the care of a redheaded teacher. <br />
<br />
It was always confronting walking into a classroom at a new school for the first time. This time it was particularly so. At the last two schools she had immediately taken a vacant seat at the back of the class room and looked at her fellow students, trying to identify like minded rebels by their dress, or even how they sat. This time all the class were girls. They all wore identical school uniforms and all seemed to be giving Molly ridiculous welcoming smiles. <br />
<br />
The teacher introduced her to the class, who responded by chorusing &quot;Welcome Molly&quot;  then told her to sit at a vacant spot at a table at the front of the room. She was then introduced to a blonde girl whose name she didn&#39;t immediately recall but who was going to be her &quot;Buddy&quot; and show her around. Molly was taken aback when she looked at this girl - she had Molly&#39;s face!<br />
<br />
Molly couldn&#39;t even remember what that first lesson was about. It was something like history but she did recall that her &quot;Buddy&quot; appeared to be the teachers pet and was always sticking up her hand hoping to answer the questions the teacher was asking. Molly soon learned this girl was Jennifer and she had an irritating self satisfied smile every time she answered a question correctly.<br />
<br />
Morning tea finally came and not knowing what else to do Molly tagged along with Jennifer to the kitchen where boarders - and evidently Jennifer was a boarder as well, could get a drink and a healthy snack. Jennifer asked a lot of questions and Molly answered without giving too much away. She gave an abbreviated history of where she lived and her previous schools. She was surprised that Jennifer actually knew of her home town - it wasn&#39;t exactly an exciting place.<br />
<br />
Jennifer and some of the other boarders who were in the kitchen and who must have been Jennifer&#39;s friends asked her what sports she played. When Molly answered &quot;Hockey&quot; that created some excitement. She found out that Jennifer and one of her friends Sarah a girl with dark brown hair were both hockey players. At least she now had something more than a face in common. The two girls immediately tried to recruit Molly into the school team. As joining a sports team seemed to be the only way to get out of the school grounds Molly had no objections.<br />
<br />
Lunchtime was much the same. As a boarder they were provided a hot lunch. Molly had to undergo more questions from Jennifer and her friends. Evidently Sarah was in the same dormitory as Molly. Jennifer was in another boarding house. There were evidently 3 boarding houses each with their own boarding house mistress. After they had eaten the girls showed Molly around the school. They gave the tour that Molly had missed by not attending orientation day. <br />
<br />
When Molly asked the other girls about sneaking out of the school grounds and into the nearby town they looked at her with shocked expressions.</p>
