<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;...make you a balloon animal.&quot; Ty finished triumphantly.<br />
<br />
The diminished 16 year old Dustin with a 13 year old body stared in stunned disbelief. &quot;A... a what?&quot;<br />
<br />
It was too late, however, as Ty had already closed his eyes to concentrate on his desire. When he opened his eyes Dustin was speaking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude! Did you... did you just say a balloon animal? What the fu-&quot;<br />
<br />
POINK! With a sudden and violent jerk Dustin's body quite dramatically changed and shrank down into a little orange balloon giraffe. Just like you'd have found at a child's birthday party.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, Ty?&quot; Dustin spoke through his little puffed up lips, his voice high pitched like he had sucked in helium. &quot;What the hell just happened to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty stepped forward, knelt down, and carefully examined the living balloon animal. Two eyes drawn on cartoonishly with a sharpie stared back at him from an elongated face.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know those long balloons that magicians and clowns blow up at parties and make into animal shapes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yesss.&quot; Dustin replied rather testily.<br />
<br />
Ty smirked. &quot;Well, I've just made you one of those.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Great!&quot; Dustin squeaked, as he turned his long tubular neck to regard his body far below, complete with four little sausage legs and a puffed up circle of a tail. Apparently, he was complete with giraffe markings and little sharpied detail touches. Including hooves. When his gaze returned to Ty the little balloon animal was clearly freaked out. &quot;Ty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder...&quot; Ty stroked his chin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ty?&quot; Dustin gulped.<br />
<br />
Ty broke his train of thought and stared at the little giraffe. &quot;Yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn't this a little fucking weird?&quot; Dustin deadpanned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, you're so cute with that high pitched voice.&quot; Ty patted the little balloon's head, smiled as his 'horns' squeaked, and then returned promptly to his inner thoughts.<br />
<br />
The little sharpied on eyes grew wider. &quot;Ty! Dude! Come on! This is trippy. How am I even able to talk? And... like... why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted to try something different.&quot; Ty admitted. &quot;Now hush up, I'm trying to think of what to do now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously!&quot; Dustin stamped his front leg, which rasped as he moved. &quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because it's funny!&quot; Ty blurted out, and giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; Dustin hung his neck sadly and kicked at the carpet. &quot;I don't like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, fine.&quot; Ty raised his hands up and down. &quot;Just chill. We'll make you something else besides a balloon animal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kay.&quot; Dustin's little eyes expressed extreme bewilderment. &quot;Guess I'll... just wait. Stand here and be all... inflated. And stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, if you're gonna whine, here.&quot; With that, Ty closed his eyes again.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-W-Whoaaaa!&quot; Dustin cried, as he proceeded to enlarge rather quickly. As he reached Ty's waist the little balloon giraffe was swiftly turning back to skin and bone, only staying a giraffe. Real fur sprouted out at four feet tall, features defined at five feet tall, and as Dustin sprang up to six feet he momentarily blinked long dark eyelashes as he stared at Ty in more shock and then continued growing. Suddenly a full grown male giraffe was standing in Ty's bedroom, all 20 feet of him rather cramped, his long legs splayed out to all four corners of the room and his long neck hunched over against the ceiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...&quot; Dustin turned his long face around and stared down the bridge of his nose oddly, trying to determine what had happened. He saw the length of neck, the browny-tan liverspots, and the straw orange fur covering a body with four lanky cloven hooved legs. He saw a long furry tail flick behind him. It took a moment to process that he was staring at his own body, and his ears lowered. &quot;Um. Huh.&quot; Dustin said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Ty looked up, still thinking hard about something. &quot;You didn't want to be a balloon, so I made you a real giraffe instead. Problems?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's... it's awfully cramped in here.&quot; Dustin offered a weak grin. &quot;This is hurting my neck.&quot; He shook his head and sighed. &quot;What a messed day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Ty closed his eyes and opened them. &quot;Fair enough. Now, shut up and let me think! Geez!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin commenced shrinking at a steady pace, and soon found himself a little less cramped, though still unable to stand up to his full height. &quot;Hey, that's better.&quot; As he finished the words, his horns brushed the ceiling, and with relief he stood up. When he stood up, the ceiling was a few inches above his horns. He looked up and found his nose brushing the ceiling for a second before his gaze continued lowering downward. Realization sunk in and the giraffe looked around. &quot;Hey... I'm shrinking!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very perceptive. Now shhh.&quot; Ty admonished.<br />
<br />
Dustin stood beside Ty now, looking down on him for a bit, and then reached nine feet tall. Still a full giraffe, just a smaller one. &quot;Actually... this... this feels all tingly and neat. I think...&quot; Dustin glanced down and between his back legs, and blushed beneath his fur. &quot;Yeah... this feels good, Ty.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty glanced beside him and saw the blush under Dustin's eyes as well as his somewhat dreamy expression. &quot;Hmmm?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;T-This feels *really* good, Ty.&quot; The giraffe laughed stupidly, down to seven feet and breathing a little heavier as the tip of his pink penis slipped out of his sheath and started to grow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, dude!&quot; Ty saw the emerging pink and shook his head. &quot;No more shrinking for you! You pervert!&quot;<br />
<br />
Six feet tall and Dustin stopped shrinking, flushed with arousal and shaking his legs as his penis emerged to reveal it's weird S curve and started to blow up. &quot;N-No... don't stop it.&quot; Dustin whimpered. &quot;It's just getting good. Make me smaller!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty stared at Dustin the horny giraffe and shook his head. &quot;Huh. That nice, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Now at full mast, the hard cock of the giraffe was still as long as Ty's forearm even though the animal himself was much smaller than full size. &quot;Y-Yeah.&quot; Dustin groaned, grinding cock against his tummy. &quot;Oh man... I gotta get off. Keep shrinking me. Please!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, sure. Whatever.&quot; Ty had been considering different changes and at last was ready to make a decision. &quot;How about...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;UNNNH!&quot; Dustin grunted, a little over four feet tall, and proceeded to unload onto the floor and his front legs, splattering giraffe semen as he came from the stimulation against his stomach. He closed his eyes dreamily and his legs grew even more shaky at three feet tall. &quot;Whoa... dude. Being a giraffe ROCKS!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah. Okay.&quot; Ty went for the door. &quot;Just... enjoy this for a bit then. I've got to see mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sure, whatever.&quot; Dustin turned away, and proceeded to snake his long neck around to reach his cock, using a very long tongue to lap at it and taste his own juices. &quot;Mmmmm!&quot; Dustin smiled. &quot;Yeah! Can you slow it down before you go? So I don't, you know, vanish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gonna pretend this didn't just happen.&quot; Ty said solemnly, and unlocked the door and exited to leave two foot tall giraffe Dustin to his own devices as his shrinking slowed to a gradual rate of one inch every half hour. As he closed the door he shuddered as the little animal came a second time with a little groan of ecstasy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. That was fucked.&quot; Ty admitted, then headed downstairs to play with June.</p>
