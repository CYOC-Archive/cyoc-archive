<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Author’s Note: Misspelled Lurog’s name in the last chapter as Lorug. Sorry.<br />
——————————————————————-<br />
<br />
You feel on the verge of cumming, just a single stroke on your orc cock would result in a load of cum. A LARGE load of cum. <br />
<br />
You struggle to prevent yourself from releasing as you feel your body tense and freeze. Only feeling Kagan’s hands moving over your chest as you control your breaths. You let out slow and deep breaths, trying to calm yourself, while ignoring the sensations from your dick and Kagan’s scrubbing.<br />
<br />
You empty your mind from any obscene thoughts and relax your arms. Keeping them stuck by your side as to prevent any risk of jerking off.<br />
<br />
After a bit, you’ve calmed yourself enough for your cock to become flaccid. The arousal disappearing from your body.<br />
<br />
“There! Isn’t that better?” Kagan says as he lets go of your pecs and admires his handiwork. Your chest and stomach are now covered in a nice layer of soap. Although you felt as if you should be annoyed with the orc, you feel appreciative for his help and assume he hadn’t meant to aroused you. Besides, you felt like you really couldn’t get mad at him.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, thanks Kagan!” you tell him.<br />
<br />
You both rinse the soap off of your bodies and help wash the soap off each others backs. Thankfully, this time Kagan doesn’t touch anything else besides your back, as he scrubs the soap off with water.<br />
<br />
After you all finish and the upper half of your torsos are completely clean, you watch Lurog begin to leave the lake. Kagan follows behind, as you try to keep up with them. The three of you exit the lake and stand on the grass. Water dripping off your bodies.<br />
<br />
Did this constitute as a successful bath?<br />
<br />
You make your way to your towel before hearing a deep cough behind you.<br />
<br />
“Where are you going Boruk? We still have to wash our lower halves,” Lurog says. He’s watching you in disbelief, wondering why you weren’t properly finishing your bath.<br />
<br />
“Right… I only wanted to bring my towel closer,” you flimsy make an excuse and grab your towel. Draping it on a nearby boulder.<br />
<br />
You sigh internally. Not only was the bath not over but now you all would be washing in closer proximity. And washing your junk on top of that.<br />
<br />
Lurog and Kagan begin washing their legs. Kagan’s are thicker and longer while Lurog’s are thinner and stronger. Regardless, their legs are both muscular and wide, with large calves and broad thighs.<br />
<br />
Next, they lather their cocks and gently scrub them as the flop around. Their balls swinging from the motion. It’s at this point that you realize you needed to start washing yourself as well. <br />
<br />
Glancing away from their dicks, you wash your powerful long legs. They’re just as thick and muscular as the other two orcs. You feel their strength as you scrub your big calves and broad thighs. These were the legs of a warrior. Able to sustain your body and suited for physical activity. They were capable of running long distances, something you knew from first hand experience, and supporting you whenever completing arduous tasks. Carrying heavy items or defending yourself were a breeze with your new legs.<br />
<br />
You move to your own member and lather it gently. Moving to your balls, you’re surprised to feel their heavy weight as you caress them in your hand. They were full of seed and prepared at any moment for intercourse. Letting them go and feeling them swinging below, you move back to your cock. You feel your tool’s still sensitive as you rub it, clearly the result of your prior arousal, and make sure to be careful not to awaken it. It would be awkward explaining why you were suddenly sporting a boner in front of the others.<br />
<br />
You look up and see that Lurog and Kagan are both facing away from you. Their backs directly in front of you as they wash their backsides. You feel your dick give a small throb as you focus on them, never questioning the sudden reaction from your member.<br />
<br />
Kagan’s has a nice smooth bubble butt, full of muscle and fat, matching his physique. It was alluring watching the thick and juicy ass as it jiggled slightly when he washed it. It was more or less a perfect ass. <br />
<br />
You slowly move your eyes over to look at Lurog. His was also large but full of more muscle than fat. However, it didn’t mean his was any less enticing. Lurog’s butt was hairy and looked firm to the touch. Yet it retained a nice round shape with a thick ass that bulged out. It wasn’t a bubble butt but it was still a sexy hairy ass.<br />
<br />
Deciding to examine you own, you feel it before looking over your shoulder. Your own ass wasn’t a bubble butt but it wasn’t as full of muscle as Lurog’s. It was average. But that meant it had the best of both worlds. It felt soft and smooth to the touch but retained a tough and sturdy build underneath. A mixture of muscle and fat. Your ass protruded from your back at an acceptable size but was just as thick and large as the other two. You might have an average ass but it was just as hot.<br />
<br />
You generously wash it before moving on to your feet. They’ve grown to suit your body. Longer and wider. They also feel tougher and rougher, the result of constant contact with the environment. <br />
<br />
Most orcs walked around barefoot but wore footwear during battle, hunting, and any other activity that called for it. Over time their feet accustomed to this lifestyle, older warriors having feet as tough as leather boots.<br />
<br />
Once you finish, you wash the layer of soap off in the lake. Kagan and Lurog are already in the lake and scrubbing themselves completely. The three of you finish and make your way to your towels to dry off.<br />
<br />
Grabbing yours off the boulder, you dry yourself thoroughly and put your loincloth back on. The other two orcs dry themselves but take their time to put their loincloth on. Kagan had started another pointless argument with Lurog, and they were completely engrossed in it. Standing naked and unashamed in front of one another as they spoke.<br />
<br />
“They must be really comfortable with one another,” you think as you turn you head away from them. You didn’t want to scrutinize their attractive bodies and feel more odd feelings of lust and arousal. Back home you were straight. Well… technically you should still be straight here as well. But now you found yourself questioning it.<br />
<br />
They eventually dress themselves before you all pack up your belongings. The only things to take with you are the bags and towels. All soap bars had been worn down completely. <br />
<br />
The three of you had needed to wash your entire bodies and your large figures required the whole bar. You were three massive orcs after all.<br />
<br />
You check if your ring is still on your right hand and see the familiar white stone on the metal band. You would be meeting up with Oz later tonight and it was important you didn’t lose it. He was going to give you some valuable information on orcs.<br />
<br />
You had learned some on your own. But it still wasn’t much. Contrary to the stereotype of orcs being stupid, disgusting, and perpetually angry you’ve found that they were actually pretty intelligent, hygienic (at least the orcs that chose to be but humans were the same right?) and calm. Most orcs were often indifferent and neutral and only expressed emotions when the time or environment called for it. They weren’t emotionless but they chose when to display their emotions. This didn’t mean they didn’t have their own personalities and feelings though.<br />
<br />
In addition, orcs were comfortable being naked around one another although they still had the decency to wear clothing and even enforced it. But orcs of the same sex appeared to be WAY more comfortable around one another when naked. <br />
<br />
You remember the events from the bath and feel a slight blush form on your face.<br />
<br />
“What a refreshing bath,” Kagan happily states as he stretches his body. “I bet you never had a bath as calm as this in you life have you Boruk?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, it was amazing,” you respond. You had no experience bathing in this world or even in a lake in general, but the experience was tranquil for the most part.<br />
<br />
“Didn’t I tell you? The first day is always the best day to bathe. Usually lakes are overcrowded with orcs on any other given day. In fact, I bet that this whole place’ll be full tomorrow morning,” Kagan says.<br />
<br />
“It does feel nice not having to deal with any other orcs for a while,” you say, relieved at taking a break from the tribe.<br />
<br />
“Well hate to break it to you but we need to start heading back to the village,” Lurog tells you. His expression is serious and he’s holding his bag.<br />
<br />
“What are we doing now?” you ask them.<br />
<br />
Lurog takes a few seconds to respond. “We’re going to…”</p>
