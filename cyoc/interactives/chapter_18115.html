<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The jock was slumped in the chair twiddling his fingers. His feet were both on their sides <br />
pointing outwards. As Derek placed the boxes and knelt before the jock he couldn't help <br />
but touch one of them. Through the material he could feel their powerful and thick arch. <br />
Looking up to the jock Derek had half expected him to react to the touch, but instead the <br />
jock just looked down with the same beaming face. The fact that the jock didn't seem to <br />
care caused Derek to almost burst with glee. Peering up over the sofa Derek made sure <br />
that no-one else was in the shop or that Matt was back form the stock room.<br />
<br />
With a satisfactory smirk Derek wraps both hands around the huge foot and lifts it up. The <br />
weight of it was beyond Derek's belief and he practically nosed dived into something that <br />
he always wanted to do. His arousal was uncomfortably tenting his trousers as he pressed <br />
the sole of the foot against his face and breathed deeply. The faint musky scent of the <br />
jock tickled his nose where as the warmth from it only wanted Derek to snuggle his nose <br />
between the toes deeper. Event though it felt like hours to Derek the whole thing lasted <br />
moments, as Derek was afraid of Matt walking back into the room.<br />
<br />
Placing the foot back down with a quiet thud Derek turned back to the jock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Afraid there are no flip flops or sandals, but we do have some funky sneakers for you.&quot; <br />
Derek said with his heart racing as he reached for the 25 box, which was more like a small <br />
storage box. The jock seemed to snap back into the room,<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn dude, I was hoping to grab some new ones, but…&quot; the jock trailed off as he began <br />
to scratch his head, &quot;but… I think I came in for some cleats… or at least that's what I think <br />
I wanted.&quot;<br />
<br />
Derek placed both hands on either of the jocks feet and stared up into the jock's eyes. <br />
Transfixing the jock with his stare he said quietly and firmly, &quot;relax your mind.&quot; The jock's <br />
eyes instantly glazed over and his expression became blank. &quot;You do need some cleats but <br />
first you will find some new sneakers. On returning to your house you will put all your old <br />
shoes out into the trash. You will have always had the feet you had and if anyone tries to <br />
tell you otherwise you will either shrug it off or say to them that people change. Is that <br />
clear slave?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes master&quot; the jock mumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; replied Derek as he let go of the jock's feet, somewhat reluctantly. The jock <br />
slightly shook his head as if shaking off the haze of a dream.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's see what you have for these puppies then.&quot; The jock said as he picked his feet up <br />
and wiggled them in front of Derek, who could barely control his arousal and self from <br />
reaching out and grapping the two huge feet. What stopped him was the thought of giving <br />
the jock even bigger feet. Biting his lip he opened the box and heaved out both of the <br />
jock's new shoes and soon to be new shoe size.<br />
<br />
Carefully unlacing the shoes he assisted the jock's feet down into the boats. As each foot <br />
past his face Derek leant forward to catch a quick whiff. Sitting back on his knees Derek <br />
starred at the ankle tops in excited anticipation. A hand pressed down on the end of the <br />
shoe where as the other gently rubbed his groin. The jock's feet must have felt lost in the <br />
great shoes but Derek knew the socks would soon work their magic. Keeping a watchful <br />
eye Derek's heart raced again as he saw the neck of the sock creep down jock's ankle.<br />
<br />
Tugging down gently Derek watched with a smile as the leg hairs each leapt to attention <br />
as soon as the sock neck drifted past them. A light bump against his thumb confirmed <br />
that the jock's feet were filling their new abode nicely. Derek kept his thumb pressed down <br />
against the shoe but couldn't hold back the slow and relentless pushing of the jock's big <br />
toe. The feel and sight of the jock's growing feet almost made Derek pounce on the jock's <br />
newly acquired humongous feet but he knew that would be for later.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll take 'em. They look awesome.&quot; The jock said enthusiastically as he stood up and <br />
modeled the sneakers in front of a low-lying mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem,&quot; Derek said as his gaze lingered on the big sneakers twirling in front of him, <br />
&quot;but I'll need the socks back though.&quot;<br />
<br />
The jock sat back down and pulled each foot out of the sneaker, it almost took a good five <br />
seconds for the entirety of the foot to be revealed. With both enormous white clad feet <br />
before Derek, he could no longer resist himself. He placed a massive foot in his lap, heel <br />
pressing against his erection and slipped his fingers under the neck of the sock. Slowly <br />
and tenderly he slipped off the sock, keeping his thumbs pressed so the smooth sole. He <br />
looked up again as if to check that the jock wouldn't suddenly object. To see if he wasn't <br />
dreaming and that the jock was still actually there. With a final light tug the foot was <br />
revealed. Each mighty toe stood before Derek, he leant in so close he could practically <br />
taste them, but yet he didn't. It drove him wild but he knew that he would know their taste <br />
soon enough.<br />
<br />
With both socks in Derek's hand he picked up the box and headed to the till. Another <br />
quick look around the store revealed no one but his bare footed jock, and with that Derek <br />
plunged his face into the socks. The smell was divine, and as he closed his eyes he could <br />
imagine him there in front of the jock's soles once more. The 'beep' from the till's brought <br />
him back to reality. Through dreamy eyes he read the monstrous price tag, and down to a <br />
credit card that was placed on the table. The silver letters read Samuel Wood, and the hand <br />
that held on to it led to the jock. Looking up from the socks Derek smiled. 'Cute name, <br />
and so typical of a jock,' he thought.<br />
<br />
Slipping the socks back into his pocket he swiped the card and waited for the jock to sign <br />
for his new feet and life. Taking the receipt Derek reached out and grabbed a hold of <br />
Sam's hand. Catching his eye in his Derek said, &quot;What were you planning on doing today?&quot;</p>
