<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">14-year-old Zoran is sitting in his room playing DOOM on his laptop, the young teen with short black hair, a natural brown tan, brown eyes and an athletic built, is home alone. The boy received his drivers license a few hours ago and is celebrating the achievement by playing this game. Zoran is also excited, his parents have promised, that if he’d succeed in achieving the driving tests and present his license, they’d gift him with his first car. “I wonder what sort of car I’ll be getting,” the boy mumbles to himself, “hopefully it is not like the trash car my brother got.”<br />
<br />
Zoran suddenly hears the door bell ring, he pauses the game and goes to see who it is, he opens the door to find a delivery man from UPS. “Good day,” the man greets, “are you Nelson Johnson?”<br />
<br />
Zoran shakes his head, “nope, but I am his younger brother,” he says.<br />
<br />
“No problem,” the man replies, “would you take the parcel in his place?”<br />
<br />
“Sure,” Zoran says, the man holds out the form for Zoran to sign, after that he hands the boy the package and bids farewell. Zoran closes the door and heads back to his room, he sets the package on his desk and starts to play again. While playing, the boy can’t stop eyeing the package, soon his curiosity gets the better of him. Zoran pauses the game and opens the package, “my brother will kill me,” he mumbles. The boy looks inside to find a strange remote, “what the hell is this? It doesn’t look like a TV remote.” Zoran takes the strange device, which has a big screen and buttons, a big green one and some smaller white ones which are labeled with words such as: animal, age, object, memory, scan, confirm (big green button)…<br />
<br />
The boy puts the device on his desk and looks into the box, he finds the manual and starts to read. Zoran reads through the manual, the more he reads the more his confusion turns into excitement, as he finishes reading the manual the young boy has an evil grin on his face. “With this device I’ll be a god,” he mumbles, stroking the device, “first I got to make my brother forget that he ordered this, then the real fun can begin. But first things first: time to burn the manual, so that no one can use it against me.”<br />
<br />
A few hours later Zoran hears the front door open and the voice of his brother announcing his arrival. Smirking evilly, the young teen grabs the remote and heads to his door, Zoran opens his door a crack and peers out. He sees his brother coming up the stairs, the second Nelson turns to head to his room, which is located opposite from Zoran’s, the boy presses the memory button. Nelson suddenly stumbles, clutching his head and shaking it, then he blinks and shrugs, entering his room. ‘Let’s see if it worked,’ Zoran thinks to himself and walks up to his brother’s door and knocks.<br />
<br />
“Yes,” his brother says.<br />
<br />
Zoran opens the door, “hey bro,” he says, “had a great day at work?”<br />
<br />
“It was okay,” Nelson says, “nothing special.”<br />
<br />
“I see,” Zoran says, “are you awaiting a delivery?”<br />
<br />
Nelson looks at his younger brother, “no, I haven’t ordered anything in a while,” he says, “why are you asking?”<br />
<br />
Zoran grins inwardly, ‘it really works,’ he thinks to himself, “oh, just in case you aren’t here when something arrives, so that I know.”<br />
<br />
“I see,” Nelson says, “if that is all, I need to get some paperwork done for tomorrow,” he adds.<br />
<br />
“Sure, bro,” Zoran says and closes the door, walking back into his own room and sits down at his desk, grinning at the device.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That evening the whole family is sitting at the dining table eating their evening meal, “dad, mom, Nelson. I have something to announce,” Zoran says, looking at them.<br />
<br />
“Oh? What is it,” his father asks.<br />
<br />
Zoran grins, he takes out his wallet and hands his father a small plastic card, his grin widens as he sees his father’s eyes widen in amazement.<br />
<br />
“What is it, dear,” Susan asks.<br />
<br />
“Our 14 year old has got his drivers license,” Max breaths in disbelieve.<br />
<br />
Nelson’s and Susan’s eyes widen, then they all look at Zoran, “congratulations, little bro,” Nelson says, “it took me two years to get mine,” he adds.<br />
<br />
“We are proud of you,” his parents say, “but we never had thought, that you’d get yours straight away.”<br />
<br />
“Hehe, I am full of surprises,” Zoran says.<br />
<br />
“That you are,” his mother says.<br />
<br />
“So… um… wh-when will I get my car,” the boy asks, “you promised you’d give me one when I get my drivers license.”<br />
<br />
His parents look at each other, “um… when you are 16,” his dad says.<br />
<br />
Zoran’s eyes widen in shock, “WHY?!”<br />
<br />
“Well… we honestly thought you’d fail and secondly we don’t have enough money for a car,” his mother says.<br />
<br />
Zoran feels anger raise inside of him, ‘liars… I should have known,’ he thinks to himself, “b-but I want a car now,” he says.<br />
<br />
“I know sweety,” his mother says, “please be patient, your brother has gotten his car when he was 16.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah? BUT he got it a WEEK AFTER receiving his license,” Zoran says, his face altering in anger, “so, WHY do I HAVE to wait two damn years?!”<br />
<br />
“Because… well… we personally believe that 14 is to young,” his dad says, rubbing the back of his head.<br />
<br />
Zoran blinks, “then why the hell did you allow me to take driving lessons?”<br />
<br />
“Simple, to keep you off the street and away from your criminal friends,” his mother says, “we are proud that you managed it, but you need to wait for a car.”<br />
<br />
This was the last straw for Zoran, he jumps up from the table in rage and after snatching his license from his father, storms into his room, slamming the door.<br />
<br />
“He’ll be okay,” his dad says, “he’ll understand when he has cooled off.”<br />
<br />
Zoran sits down at his desk, he is fuming in rage and hatred, “how could they? How could they do this to me,” he asks himself. The boy looks to the right, his eyes land on the device, suddenly an idea pops into his head, an evil smirk appearing on his face, “I can just MAKE myself a car.” Zoran picks up the device, “I think my brother will make a fine car, but what to do with those liars who call themselves my “parents”?”</p>
