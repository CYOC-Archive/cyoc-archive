<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jack received one last slap on the bum from Jacob as he finally opened the door to Jacks unit. &#39;There you go darling. I&#39;m a man of my word. This is Jack&#39;s flat. Just call me if you require any more services honey’<br />
<br />
Jack shut the door and put the security chain in place. She did not like the idea of Jacob having a key to the unit any longer. She tried to breath calmly and take stock of her situation. How was she ever going  face Jacob when she was back in her own body once more?<br />
<br />
She was so embarrassed by how she had reacted. She had allowed Jacob to fuck her thinking that was the only way she could get into the flat. It had started out alright, purely a business transaction. Jack put out and in return Jacob would let her into the flat. Jack having disrobed and lay on his bed with her legs spread, willing Jacob to get the deed done as quickly as possible. <br />
<br />
Jacob had quickly removed his own clothes. He had a spare tyre on his stomach and his chest was very hairy. Jack purposely didn&#39;t look at Jacobs dick, only the light on the ceiling. She was determined to lay back and think of England.<br />
<br />
Jacob climbed between her legs and his hands found Jack&#39;s breasts. &#39;Real nice Honey&#39;. He brushed her nipples. They were stiff and a jolt of excitement flew through her body.<br />
<br />
&#39;Just get it over and done with please. I&#39;m in a hurry&#39;<br />
<br />
Jack continued to look at the light on the ceiling as she felt Jacob position his penis outside the lips of her vagina. Then with a firm thrust Jacob penetrated her. His fat tummy squashed over her and his onion breathe was in her face. She turned her head to the side so he couldn&#39;t kiss her. His dick began to push in and out of her. The dick wasn&#39;t particularly big and it went in readily. There was a tiny bit of resistance at first, then, well what could Jack say...it began to feel pleasant.<br />
<br />
Jack had expected Jacob to blow his load quickly but the man was showing a lot of restraint. After several minutes the trusts began to be associated with a squirting noise. Jack&#39;s immediate thought was &quot;She&#39;s getting excited&quot; then realised that she was the &quot;She&quot;. There was absolutely no doubt that her juices were flowing. She resisted the urge to tell Jacob to push harder.<br />
<br />
Jacob temporarily stopped thrusting and gave Jack a grin. He asked &#39;Enjoying yourself?&#39;<br />
<br />
All Jack could reply was &#39;Don&#39;t stop&#39; in a soft voice<br />
<br />
Jacob recommenced. He pushed in slowly and and pulled out even more slowly. Jack felt every inch of the dick as it pushed into her and the suction as he pulled out. She found herself willing the muscles of her vagina to hold the dick in there but she didn&#39;t have the strength and definitely didn&#39;t know how to operate those muscles. She became aware that she was breathing in time with his trusts. As he pushed in she breathed in.<br />
<br />
Jacks hands reached around and grasped Jacobs bum. She attempted to hold him &quot;in&quot; but once more found once more she didn&#39;t have the strength. The feel of his bum muscles working was unfortunately even more of a turn on.<br />
<br />
She found herself saying &quot;Yes!&quot; with each inward thrust. At first it was a soft whisper but as Jacob continued to thrust in and out Jack&#39;s vocalisation became louder. &#39;Yes!.................................Yes!.................................Yes!&#39;<br />
<br />
Jacob temporarily stopped once more &#39;Liking that Honey?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Fuck Yes! Harder! Faster!&#39; <br />
<br />
Jacob slowly to sped up. Jack &#39;s nether regions began to tingle. Then the tingling spread as Jack enjoyed an orgasm. She couldn&#39;t help but vocalise &#39;Yeeeeeeeeeeeeessssssssssss! &#39;Yeeeeeeeeeeeeesssssssss!  &#39;Yeeeeeeeeeeeeesssssssss!&#39;<br />
<br />
Jacks excitement also set Jacob over the edge. He grunted as she felt herself filled with his ejaculate. That also seemed to prompt Jacob to kiss the woman under him who happened to be Jack. She was too fatigued to object. She endured the onion breath and a tongue probing her mouth.<br />
<br />
Jacob&#39;s spent penis shrunk and eventually slipped out of Jack. He rolled off her and Jack took the opportunity to quickly get off the bed and locate her clothes. With semen dripping from her she visited Jacob&#39;s bathroom and used toilet paper to partially clean herself. She decided a shower could wait until she was back in her own unit.<br />
<br />
She dressed, hoping some toilet paper stashed in her panties would absorb the juices still dripping from her. Then had to wake the now sleeping Jacob and remind him of his part of the deal. She waited impatiently as he slowly dressed himself and while doing so proposed; &#39;How about we get together again? Maybe tomorrow?  I could take you out to dinner?&#39;<br />
<br />
Jack had no experience of turning down dates herself. She racked her brains to think of some of the excuses she had been given by females when she was the male. &#39;I&#39;m not sure my husband would be too impressed&#39; was what she settled on. Then Jacob took her up to her unit and opened the door.</p>
