<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">That night, jean had vary dark dream was on the borders of being a nightmare. In her dream, she was walking down an old road with only a few visible patches of asphalt. The rest of the road was covered in a gray snow that was falling all around her. The sky was black with a repeating pattern of light gray clouds that seemed to be flat. A forest of white birch trees with black stripes bordered both sides of the road. Forming a wall of stark white and crisscrossed black lines that seemed to hurt her head and eyes when she looked at them. <br />
   Suddenly, she started to run. She didn’t know why except that it was important. Eventually the landscape started to blur. The world turned and twisted and rose and fell. And then jean collapsed onto the imaginary soil. Her eyes hadn't completely closed when she fell they just blurred. <br />
   When she was able to see again the world had changed. She was on an island of white soil suspended in a swirling purple space.      <br />
   Jean’s gaze shifted to the center of the island again and she recoiled in shock. For laying there curled in the fetal position, was a girl. Naked. jean couldn’t see her front but she had the eeriest feeling the other girl could sense her presence. Slowly. Jean stepped over to the front of the girl and recoiled yet a second time. She knew this girl, it was her. Or at least, an older version of her self. Probably 18 or 20. Jean rushed over to the older woman and began to rouse her. Eventually the woman awoke. She tried to tell jean something but, the only silence came from her mouth. &quot;What?&quot; jean asked. Her older self suddenly became alarmed. She looked like she was about to try to speak again when suddenly she screamed and clutched her stomach. Horrified. Jean backed away from the woman until she felt compelled to stop. <br />
   Not having taken her eyes away. Jean saw that her older self was now on all fours, and her body was starting to grow. She saw her clone's hands and feet shift into large clawed paws while at the same time. Muscles started to grow. Both existing ones and new. The next thing the older jean did was run her paws across her body. Mainly focusing on her breasts, they grew larger while her body became covered in a coat of black fur. This seamed to bring even further pleasure to transforming clone. If jean was aroused by this at all it was overshadowed by the disgust and horror she felt from watching this. Eventually the jean clone grew its tail and Snout. She let out a loud howl, and looked over toward jean. <br />
   Before she could even react the jean-wolf jumped over and grabbed her, pinning her arms. The jean-wolf began to lick jeans face. In a short time she could barley feel her limbs. And the wolf monster's face contorted in an evil smile as she lowered her self down to jeans nethers. <br />
   As the creature tore off her pants jean began to yell at it to stop. Unfortunately her cries fell on def ears, and the creature began to pleasure jean. The sensations were vary dull since this was only a dream but, she could still feel her pussy moisten, and her body heating up. She wanted to cry but her body was betraying her. She was starting to get the feeling back in her limbs but she couldn’t bring herself to resist this creature. <br />
   The heat became more intense, jean could barley breathe. Suddenly a tingling started in lower body. All of this was going to drive her crazy if something didn’t happen soon. Sensing her frustration. The creature pulled up and looked and locked eyes with jean. <br />
   Right then she knew that it was waiting for her order, jean could just say no and it would all fade away. But, jeans mind had become clouded. And her body felt the need for some kind of release. &quot;please.&quot; she whispered despretly. That was all it needed. The creature resumed its task but with double the effort. <br />
   A mild shock ripped through jean as she was roused from sleep by her first orgasm. She sat up quick as a bolt. Her body still shacking. <br />
   Her I-phone's clock read 5:45. About 7 hours since she fell asleep. &quot;That felt, good.&quot; the thought formed slowly because she didn’t want to admit it to herself. Jean knew as much about sex as any girl her age should. But what scared her about this was that it was a werewolf that was pleasuring her. Jean knew she had to document the dream, and then come up with a hypothesis for what it could mean. The whole process would take until morning. So jean went to work. She manages to press one button before she fell back into a dark dreamless sleep.</p>
