<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Last chapter from me for now.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hey, Bro.&quot; Cole said knocking on Aidan&#39;s door. &quot;What happened to your toilet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not in the bathroom?&quot; Aidan replied dumbly, moving to brace against the door and lock it so Cole couldn&#39;t barge in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, it&#39;s really strange...&quot; Cole continued. &quot;Your toilet is missing. There was just this giant, toilet-shaped, novelty, diaper bag where it used to be. I think you guys got pranked... Your plumbing&#39;s gone and everything. Someone must have had some real dedication to pull that off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How strange...&quot; Aidan continued, sounding unconvincingly surprised and making secretly communicative faces in Nate&#39;s direction. &quot;Guess you&#39;re out of luck.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but... I really gotta go, man.&quot; Cole said, punctuating the remark with a nervous laugh. &quot;I&#39;ve had to go since I woke up... Is there a place nearby?...&quot;<br />
<br />
Aidan couldn&#39;t think of any place. He&#39;d have to go into town, or to the college campus at least... The park was hit or miss when it came to facilities and the apartment complex had nothing on offer...<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, it&#39;s perfect!&quot; Nate hissed. &quot;He was free for the weekend anyway; nobody&#39;s going to miss him. And he&#39;s gotta go REAL bad, you can&#39;t just turn him away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. We can&#39;t do this to him...&quot; Aidan shot back in a hushed tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;ll like it.&quot; Nate said, crinkling Aidan&#39;s rear seductively to emphasize the point. &quot;That&#39;s part of it... It MAKES you like it...&quot;<br />
<br />
Aidan shuddered and moaned at Nate&#39;s touch. He did like it, and he definitely hadn&#39;t before. Maybe it would be for the best... Another diapered guy in the house for the weekend. The thought was so alluring, it was overriding his better judgement.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK.&quot; Aidan relented quietly. &quot;Go ahead.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate&#39;s mouth spread into a giant smile as he excitedly brought up his phone&#39;s dialer app and eagerly pressed the number nine.<br />
<br />
&quot;I choose Cole.&quot; He thought silently to himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Might as well let him in.&quot; Nate said, raising his voice to a normal level. &quot;He&#39;s one of us now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, whats gong on in there?&quot; Cole asked with confusion at the strange delay in answering his question and the unusual whispering he could hear going on.<br />
<br />
Aidan reluctantly unlocked the door and swung it open, reveling the two diapered men in all their glory. <br />
<br />
Cole was standing there dressed in some beat-up, outdoorsy clothes, unshaven and effortlessly masculine. He was holding a toilet-shaped diaper bag at his side with a shocked, uncomfortable expression on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Jeez.&quot; Cole exclaimed at the sight of Nate and Aidan together, taking an uneasy step backwards... &quot;OH JEEZ. I didn&#39;t know you two were... I didn&#39;t realize... Hey I don&#39;t judge, man... I just...&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole stumbled backwards and looked down at the diaper bag in his hand. &quot;Oh, shit. This is yours, Isn&#39;t it? For your... UH.... your...Play... Uh... ¿pLAyTime?&quot; He said, burdened with uneasiness and discomfort, his voice cracking at the end.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not what you think!&quot; Aidan said reassuringly, holding his arms up to signal for Cole to calm down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s not NOT what you think.&quot; Nate said, grabbing Aidan&#39;s ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop that... Not now!&quot; Aidan chided, stifling a laugh and swatting Nate&#39;s hand away .<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey.&quot; Cole said, cutting in defensively. &quot;I don&#39;t even need to know. It&#39;s none of my business. I&#39;m all for everyone&#39;s rights, and consenting adults, and don&#39;t ask don&#39;t tell, and gay pride, and all that...&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole was feeling flush... He grabbed at his collar, trying to get some air. He was starting to breath heavily and his dick was starting to swell... He dropped the diaper bag at his side and doubled over, moaning uncontrollably. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is this turning me on? Why am I getting so hard?&quot; He wondered<br />
<br />
His penis grew more and more erect and began to feel very strange. It was incredibly sensitive and uncomfortably confined. The mixture of confinement and sensitivity were like opposing forces. He began discretely adjusting his legs from side to side, trying to work his dick into a more comfortable spot, but it wasn&#39;t helping. If anything it was getting him even more worked up.<br />
<br />
He let out a loud moan... Something was definitely not right... Worried thoughts raced through his mind... Maybe he had been drugged... Maybe their body-wash was laced with some kinky male-enhancement shit... Without thinking he ripped his pants off and pulled his underwear out at the waistband so he could get a look at himself. His penis was pale and shiny and it was growing and losing its usual features rapidly becoming what looked like a smooth, pale, clown dildo. As it continued to grow it began to point higher and higher breaching the rim of his stretched waistband. He looked up to see his friends eyeing his manhood greedily and turned around to face the wall in embarrassment and disgust.<br />
<br />
&quot;Awww.&quot; Nate groaned in disappointment.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fine, let him have his privacy.&quot; Aidan scolded.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I wanna see.&quot; Nate pouted.<br />
<br />
He let go of his waistband and allowed it to contract around him, coming to rest just below his balls. His penis was pure white and reflective. It was still pointing  higher and higher; finally it was pointing straight up toward the ceiling. Then it began pressing into his pelvis, gently at first then harder and harder, digging into his lower abdominal muscles uncomfortably. He reached down to pull it away, but it was oddly substantial and immovable. As it continued to press inwards it also began to flatten and expand invasively side to side.<br />
<br />
Suddenly his boxers fell down around his waist. He thoughtlessly bent down to pick them up, but found nothing there but a folded diaper. Meanwhile the men behind him were treated to a clear view of his growing plastic ball sack. It was purest white and growing and expanding between his legs, pressing firmly against his taint. It continued undeterred flowing up and around the base of his pert behind, cupping and sealing his manly muscles behind a tight, flowing, plastic coating that was reaching up higher and higher, relentlessly inching its way towards his sides and waist. His penis had all but vanished by now. His front was fully covered in a dense, tight plastic glaze that was starting to fluff and billow outwards with light, cottony volume. It grew puffier and puffier while little strips of tape extended back and away from his sides, reaching greedily to meet the growing plastic prison at his rear. Suddenly the tape made purchase on his back sides and pulled and contracted forward again, cinching tighter and tighter around his waist as the puffy plastic fabric pressed in around him from all directions and at the same time expanded outward farther and farther with more and more airy volume. The expansion was becoming so great his legs were forced apart. He tried to bring them back together but it was unnatural and unsustainable to stand normally with this unwieldy garment around him.<br />
<br />
He suddenly became aware of his shoes and socks shifting oddly beneath him, he looked down just in time to see his naked feet standing on top of a small stack of diapers. He jumped back in surprise, feeling even more exposed as he realized his shirt had vanished as well, leaving nothing more than another diaper for the pile.<br />
<br />
He had smelled it before so strongly when Aidan had opened the door to his room, but now the scent of plastic and baby powder was becoming overwhelming, and it seemed to be emanating from his own adult diaper! His mind reeled with the scent, he was shaking his head trying to get away from it but he was too close to the source. As he waved his arms in front of himself he noticed they looked different, paler, and pinker. His tan lines were gone! Years of working in the sun had been erased. His arm hairs were diminished as well, and his rough manly calluses and scars were nowhere to be seen. All over his body his skin was taking on a youthful, vibrant appearance. His muscles were shrinking and softening into adorable young limbs with soft perfect skin that smelled distinctly like baby powder. His rippling abdominal muscles flattened and softened  away to a thin, slightly defined flatness. His excessively active, manly sweat glands were shriveling away, leaving his skin well moisturized but always dry, never sweaty or moist. His complexion lost any hint of greasiness as his facial hair vanished completely, his skin picking up a warm, perky, soft-touch glow that made him indescribably cute. His feet softened and plumped with healthy youthful tone. Even his toenails looked perfectly manicured. His posture shifted slightly, becoming less domineering and strong. His feet tended inward slightly at rest as he mindlessly brushed his toes over one another, looking bashful and approachable.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to wear and use diapers&quot;<br />
<br />
The voice was his own and only in his mind, but it was true... He wouldn&#39;t admit it yet, not even to himself, but he knew it was true...<br />
<br />
Cole looked up at the other diapered men who stood in front of him wide-eyed, massaging the fronts of their diapers, looking like they were going to cream themselves. He looked back to his own diapered crotch and experimentally poked a couple fingers in as deep as they would go, the feeling was so unusual... good, but unusual. Most alarming was the fact that he couldn&#39;t feel his own equipment inside, it seemed to be fluff all the way down. He grabbed more and more of the crinkly fabric in his hands, desperately searching for signs of his dick, but it wasn&#39;t there anymore. Growing frustrated he tugged as hard as he could, trying to remove the diaper, but it wouldn&#39;t budge. He gripped it from the sides and from the back. He couldn&#39;t get his fingers behind any of the seams, it was sealed right to his skin!<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell is going on here?&quot; Cole demanded coming to his senses. &quot;Get this fucking thing off me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They don&#39;t come off.&quot; Aidan admitted sheepishly. He demonstrated the fact for emphasis by tugging at his own confined crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;But it&#39;s OK.&quot; Nate chimed in. &quot;It IS kind of weird at first, but you&#39;ll like it real soon, I promise... and it&#39;s going to be great! We can cuddle and crinkle each other&#39;s diapers all weekend. The feeling is incredible, trust me! Oh, and you&#39;re going to LOVE nap time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my GOD, yes!... NAP TIME!&quot; Aidan added in agreement, his eyes rolling back indulgently.<br />
<br />
&quot;Plus you can go ahead and use the bathroom now!&quot; Nate continued obliviously. &quot;No need to hold it in any longer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You guys are FREAKS!&quot; Cole shouted with disgust, continuing to pull angrily at the diaper. &quot;I&#39;m not staying here with you and I&#39;m certainly not taking a dump in this thing. How could you do this to me?.... This is sick!&quot;<br />
<br />
He fumbled backwards, and waddled over to his bag. He picked it up and rushed out the door, his hips twisting exaggeratedly as he walked forcing his butt to shake adorably behind him. He quickly slammed the door and made his way down the hall, ignoring their calls for him to stop. He paused briefly once he got to the stairwell to search his bag for some clothes to wear, but there weren&#39;t any. Everything had been replaced with diapers! He threw the bag into the corner and stomped out the door.<br />
<br />
He tried his best to avoid people, but it was Memorial Day weekend and &#39;outside&#39; was pretty much the place to be. He decided it would be best to take the shortest path possible which lead along the edge of the college campus; most students would be gone for the weekend anyway. The majority of people who saw him tended to keep their distance. He could only imagine what they thought of him. He couldn&#39;t get used to the funny way his diaper forced him to walk. He tried to straighten up and walk normally but the result was comically unnatural and even worse overall. He was SO embarrassed, but there was no way he was going to go back to the diaper brigade.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to wear diapers&quot; - the unsolicited thought came back to his mind...<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Pledge!&quot; Some guy called out to him from another sidewalk in the distance. &quot;If you need some shoes check the lost and found in building 208, they&#39;ve always got something and it&#39;s right there in the entryway. Good luck!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not a freaking student!&quot; He thought to himself with annoyance. &quot;And I&#39;m certainly not a freshmen frat pledge... I&#39;m nearly 36...&quot;<br />
<br />
On the other hand, his feet were hurting from walking on the hard pavement. They were just as soft and tender as they looked, so he figured he might as well give the lost and found a try... Ducking into the entryway he immediately spotted a pair of moccasins and a hoodie! He grabbed at the shoes and stowed them securely under his arm, but before he could pull the hoodie free from the jumbled up clothes bin, some office lady bounded angrily into the entryway and scolded him for indecency, calling him a &quot;filthy frat rat&quot;.<br />
<br />
He rushed out and ran away, happy to at least have gotten some shoes. He put his feet inside and started walking again... The shoes were making a huge difference in comfort, but suddenly they felt like they were shifting under him and all at once his feet were naked again. He looked back in confusion and saw a pair of folded diapers where he had just stepped. The shoes were GONE!<br />
<br />
&quot;What he hell!&quot; He said indignantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to wear and use diapers&quot; - came the mental voice<br />
<br />
He had worn the moccasins just long enough to dread going back to walking barefoot. He had a long way to go and his feet were already begging for a break. As a reluctant compromise he wrapped the stupid diapers around his feet and fastened the tape to secure them at the ankle. His makeshift diaper shoes were soft, but slippery; he had to be careful as he walked.<br />
<br />
As he finally neared his house, his anger was boiling over. He&#39;d been shouted at, ridiculed, teased, and mocked for the last half hour. Some asshole even pored his iced cofffee over his head. He was fed up with the entire world for hating on him and his diapers. He LIKED his diapers. NO. he didn&#39;t... He just appreciated them, that&#39;s all... No! He hated them and he wasn&#39;t going to use them, no matter how bad he had to crap!<br />
<br />
Storming into the small house he immediately ducked into his room, slamming every door along the way.<br />
<br />
His roommate peaked out from the kitchen, curious about all the unexpected noise. Cole was supposed to be away for the weekend...<br />
<br />
&quot;Cole?&quot; He yelled down the hallway<br />
<br />
&quot;LEAVE ME ALONE CHRISTIAN!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the heck?&quot; Christian thought to himself, whipping out his phone and dialing Aidan&#39;s number.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Aidan, It&#39;s Christian... Uh, do you know what&#39;s going on with Cole? He just got home and he&#39;s PISSED. He&#39;s going around slamming doors and everything... Weren&#39;t you guys going camping?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah... He&#39;s just going through some stuff right now. He&#39;ll be alright.&quot; Aidan replied calmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if there&#39;s anything I can do to help...&quot; Christian offered<br />
<br />
He could hear Aidan turning to engage in a quick, side discussion on his end of the line; the voices were quiet but still audible...<br />
<br />
&quot;no, it&#39;s christian he says he wants to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
He could hear the phone changing hands as it rustled in his ear, returning with a new voice that wasn&#39;t Aidan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Christian?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot;<br />
<br />
