<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Pyrus... There must be something else that can be done? Are you listening? Pyrus!&quot; A panicked female voice called out to someone. <br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think I&#39;ve been trying to do?!&quot; A deep raspy voice answered followed by the slamming of a large book on stone. &quot;There is no other way!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But our twins... We can&#39;t do that to them...&quot; The female began to weep. &quot;They deserve...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They deserve so much, my love...&quot; The male answered quickly. &quot;But at least this way... they can continue living...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Father...&quot; Blaze (Dan) felt his mouth call out, not under his control. &quot;Please mother...&quot; His eyes slowly opened on their own, but his vision was bleary, and the room was bright, too bright. His head pounded, and body felt like it was on fire, which was ironic considering he was a dragon of flames. <br />
<br />
&quot;Its... okay.&quot; He heard a voice, much like his own speak from somewhere near by. He knew the voice belonged to his brother, Frost.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, my brave twins...&quot; Their mother weeped. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am so sorry my children... please forgive what I am about to do...&quot; Their father pleaded. After a long silence fell over the room, he continued, &quot;Allow the binding to begin...&quot;<br />
****************<br />
<br />
Frost (Tom) awoke in a panic; his claws digging into the cave floor. &quot;Mother... Father...&quot; He called out at the same time as his brother. Slowly, he turned to face Blaze, realizing that it was just a dream. Strangely though, they seemed to have shared it.<br />
<br />
&quot;What just happened? Were we dreaming?&quot; Blaze asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I think so. I didn&#39;t know the game had included that; I&#39;m not even sure how it was included...&quot; Frost answered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Was that about our dragon characters&#39; past? I could not see much, only hear.&quot; Blaze replied.<br />
<br />
Frost nodded his head. &quot;Same. But it sounded like... felt like we were dying...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And then there was something about &#39;the binding&#39; beginning...&quot; Blaze finished, noting the final detail. After staring at each other for a few moments, both twins gazed downward at their half-and-half body. &quot;Holy shit...&quot; they said at the same time. Blaze continued, &quot;So... we really were a pair of separate dragon twins.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More than that...&quot; a feminine voice answered in their minds. &quot;You were the only children of the great Pyrus and Glacies... the dragon princes of legend.&quot; The emerald green dragon from before appeared from further back in the cave. <br />
<br />
&quot;You... you were at the clearing... you and those others were being chased by the knight...&quot; Blaze commented, suddenly remembering the events from before. <br />
<br />
&quot;We flew down to intervene, but... that knight had...&quot; Frost looked down and placed a claw over a mostly healed wound across his and Blaze&#39;s chest. The new scales that had grown over the wound appeared to have a purple tent. &quot;What kind of weapon was that? All it took was one hit, and we were helpless.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that barrier? He was armed to the teeth...&quot; Blaze commented. <br />
<br />
&quot;He was a Knight of Occidere Order.&quot; The dragonness answered. &quot;His name is Ficio, the orders most accomplished warrior, great at dragon slaying...&quot; her tone darkened. &quot;Armed to the teeth like you say, and yet the two of you rush in. I&#39;m not sure if you are brave or stupid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was his idea!&quot; Blaze and Frost mentally pointed a claw at each other. They turned to look at one another, glaring. &quot;No! it was yours!&quot; They bickered, speaking in tandem. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whosever idea it was doesn&#39;t really matter, especially in your case...&quot; She glared at them, though an outward smile betrayed her enjoyment of their arguing. &quot;At least you provided me enough time to prepare the rune so we could escape. So that is a positive.&quot; She then began to circle around twins, like a cat. &quot;On the other claw... I wasn&#39;t expecting the Dragon Princes to be...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So handsome.&quot; Blaze offered. <br />
<br />
A puff of green smoke escaped the other dragon. &quot;My brother does have a talent for getting under someone&#39;s scales.&quot; Frost quickly spoke up. &quot;Unfortunately as you have noticed, it is quite literal in my case.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Quite.&quot; The dragoness agreed. &quot;The name is Jade, and I am glad that you have awoken.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am assuming that it was you who healed us.&quot; Blaze spoke up. &quot;Thank you, but I thought I remember bane weapons not being able to be healed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are correct. Traditional draconic magic would not work, but as I am an emerald dragon, finding the necessary herbs to help with the healing process is not such a difficult task. But, it is a slow heal. It has been several weeks since the night of the ambush...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Weeks?!&quot; Blaze and Frost exclaimed as they looked at one another. &quot;We&#39;ve been out that long...&quot; Frost continued. <br />
<br />
&quot;Unfortunately, yes. That has drastically reduced the time we have left. Since you are awake, we will need to start moving. Give the recent activity of the knights, it would be better to walk in humanoid form.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait.. hold on. Where are we going, and what are you talking about humanoid forms...&quot; Blaze commented. <br />
<br />
&quot;Apparently, you are even less educated in the ways of dragons then I first thought... The green dragon glowed faintly before beginning to rapidly shrink. A moment later, a young woman, the same from before, stood before the brothers. &quot;All dragons can polymorph, even the two of you should be able to pull it off. And to answer your first question, we need to escape Occidere territory, or we will surely be killed. Hopefully, the elves of the north will still be willing to take us in.&quot; <br />
<br />
Blaze and Frost glanced at each other. &quot;That is a lot of information... but she seems truthful&quot; Blaze commented to his brother. <br />
<br />
&quot;She did save our lives... following he lead seems to be the best bet.&quot; Frost answered. He then spoke outwardly towards the woman. &quot;Okay, I guess you will lead the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jade nodded. &quot;I will make sure you princes survive yet, but first... you will need to transform. The people will be on high alert for any dragons, and two... joint ones will surely attract attention.&quot;</p>
