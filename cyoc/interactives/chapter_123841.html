<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With the rain also hitting the state capitol of Washington; Jack Crawford sat in his study staring at the laptop computer that his butler went out and acquired for him. Despite being out on bail, Jack Crawford was effectively a prisoner in his own home. Under house arrest, and under investigation for the attempted murder of Frederick “the Shark” Parker; a mobster from San Francisco that came to Moon lake to get his son Daniel Parker out of jail.<br />
<br />
Jack Crawford mulled over what happened in the past few days. His attempt to delay the opening of the new elementary school that Benton was building was only moderately successful; while pleased that it wouldn’t open on the first day of school, Jack’s mood soured when Benton managed discover he was behind the whole scheme. His Alias as Jack Ashford exposed first in private and then in a damming expose that also revealed Kenya as a former high priced escort agent. That news article scuttled whatever attempt Kenya had in winning the mayoral election; an election that doesn’t happen until November.<br />
<br />
These recent events were minor compared to what Jack just recently learned. While continuing to proclaim his innocence in regard to the failed assignation of Frederick Parker; Jack found out that Frances Twist discovered that her office was bugged by one of his men posing as a patient. While this took place on during the Labor day picnic, it was no less a worrying thought that gnawed on Jack. A criminal act of violating a patient’s right to privacy, Jack knew that this was one of the many “issues” Moon Lake’s Elder Council wanted to talk to him about. <br />
<br />
Going back to the laptop that was infront of him, Jack inspects it further. Almost paper thin and lacking a CD/DVD drive; Jack notice a couple of USB ports on the side, along with the port for a network cable and the power cable. Other than that, there was nothing else that stood out. With the standard QWERTY keyboard format and track pad for the mouse cursor, Jack was wondering if this was a simple basic laptop instead of the top of the line one that his Butler claimed it was.<br />
<br />
Sighing as he hits the power button, Jack was surprised as to how quickly it booted up. The operating system being completely opposite from his previous computer; a computer that was seized by the FBI as evidence, Jack began to explore the new O/S.<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Kenya was sitting in the dining room of the Condo she was sharing with her husband Jack Crawford. Poking at porterhouse steak the cook prepared. The were-panthress was not feeling hungry, despite the energy she expended earlier. Mostly still emotionally wrought over the feds busting into the condo as she made love with Jack. Witnessing one of the agents baiting Jack to attack him; hitting the man in the end as the agent was frustrated with Jack’s refusal to play along. Being separated from Jack as several agents tried to interrogate her as they processed Jack like a common criminal.<br />
<br />
Looking up, Kenya noticed the Butler putting plates and cutlery away. The same butler Kenya tried to seduce earlier as Jack was still in jail. Still in the throes of her heat cycle; Kenya made a desperate attempt to jump the man’s bones in the small apartment he resided in a few floors below.<br />
“Is Jack is not coming for supper,” Kenya bleakly speaking.<br />
“Your husband is not feeling hungry at the moment,” the butler answering; doing his best to remain professional despite, what happened earlier between him and Kenya.<br />
<br />
Kenya remained silent as the butler finished collecting the unused dinner ware and returned it to its proper place before leaving the room to perform his other duties. Pushing the plate with the porterhouse away, Kenya gets up and walks to the study that Jack hid himself into since coming back to the condo. Entering the study, Kenya sees Jack behind his desk looking at the silver laptop that Jefferies went out and purchased on his behalf.<br />
“Explain to me why this is a top of the line laptop,” Jack speaking as he tries to set up his email accounts and preferred websites.<br />
“Solid state two terabyte hard drive,” Kenya looking at the box and running down the list of other features; “built in wifi, network card…”<br />
“So the latest bells and whistles,” Jack interrupting; “designed to dazzle and impress the common person.”<br />
“It’s also from the same company that revolutionized smart phones,” Kenya putting the box down; “plus the O/S is far more secured and resistant to viruses and worms than the operating system your other computer had.”<br />
“I liked my other computer,” Jack grumbling as he closes the laptop; “I want it back.”<br />
“You going to eat supper,” Kenya watching Jack swivel his chair to look back out the window; “the cook prepared some porterhouse steaks.”<br />
“I’m not hungry at the moment,” Jack answering; “and I’d rather be alone at the moment.”<br />
<br />
“You want to be alone,” Kenya raising her voice; “what about me? Do you think I should be alone,” Kenya growling as she assumes he were-panthress fursona. “I have a nagging itch in need of scratching and I haven’t had any relief since this morning! I want you in me!”<br />
“This little device,” Jack wheeling around and pulling up his pant leg to show the ankle monitor; “is keeping me from giving what you want. If I shift, the strap will snap and the police will come assuming I’m trying to break my bail conditions. It is also keeping me confined to this condo. If I leave the front door for any reason other than work and court; an alarm blares and the police come running.”<br />
“But I need some relief;” Kenya pleading; “this heat has been driving me crazy.”<br />
“Nothing would give me greater pleasure than to bend you over this desk and take you right here and now,” Jack turning back around to stare out the window; “but right now I’m just not in the mood. If there is nothing else, than please leave the study.”<br />
<br />
Kenya just stares at her husband, growling at his refusal to help her out. Storming out of the room, she slams the door behind her. Moments later another door could be heard being slammed; Jack figuring that Kenya entered the bedroom and locking the door behind her in the process. Jack shakes his head as he turns around back to his desk; tired of the gloomy weather out his study window, Jack sees his butler quietly waiting for him.<br />
“I didn’t hear you enter,” Jack looking at the man; “and that is something considering what we are.”<br />
“Your wife made a lot of noise,” the butler answering; “it’s understandable if you didn’t hear me over her.”<br />
“You know I was surprised what you told me after you came back with this laptop,” Jack looking at the object he was tinkering with earlier; “telling me how Kenya tried to corner you and getting you to rut with her. A part of me didn’t believe it.”<br />
“Yet,” the butler looking at Jack as he looked up at him again; “something changed your mind.”<br />
“What she said just a few minutes ago,” Jack heading to a nearby cupboard; “not getting any relief since this morning. That and she was close enough for me to catch a lingering scent of another person on her.”<br />
“I wasn’t eager to give her what she desired,” the butler nervously responding; “the way she came on to me… It was unexpected. First in tears over what happened and then looking like a hungry fox that just spied a rabbit.”<br />
<br />
“Relax,” Jack pulling out two glasses and a crystal bottle; the liquid inside a dark brown and reminiscent of some kind of spirit. Seeing Jack lift the stopper, the telltale smell of whiskey could be detected from the contents of the container.<br />
“Trust but verify,” Jack speaks again as he pours the contents into the two glasses; “an old business axiom my father use to say. You know,” Jack passing one of the glasses to the butler; “I originally hired you to help me provide information in regards to Benton’s state of mind. Sharing business secrets you may have overheard when under his employ,” Jack taking a sip from his glass; “anything to give me a leg up on the asshole.”<br />
“What you mean,” the butler not taking a sip from the glass that was given to him; “is I would be eager to tell you everything I know after the whole incident of Benton punching me out was dealt with. While I have told you a few things in regards to the man, asking me for information about Frieda? That I won’t do.”<br />
“Why should you care about that whelp,” Jack slamming back his drink and putting his glass on the desk; “she is a thorn in my side. Denying me what is rightfully mine.”<br />
“Frieda is a kind and generous person,” the butler gripping the glass tightly; “which is in stark contrast to her parents. I will not betray her because you have a gripe with her, because she is a Knight.”<br />
“You better have that same kind of loyalty to my future child Jefferies,” Jack glaring at the butler; “in the meantime resume your duties and let me know if Kenya tries to make a move on you again or any of the staff. And keep this conversation between us.”<br />
&quot;Shall I have the cook warm up your diner or do you still want to be alone,&quot; Jefferies asking.<br />
&quot;Just bring it here cold,&quot; Jack responding; &quot;and remember, not a word to Kenya about what you told me.&quot;</p>
