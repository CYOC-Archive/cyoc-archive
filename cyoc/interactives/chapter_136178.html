<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You know,&quot; Mika mused. &quot;Homecoming could be alot of fun. I haven&#39;t been to a game in forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously,&quot; Claudia said flatly. &quot;This coming from the girl that screamed &#39;fuck this shit I&#39;m out&#39; after getting her diploma.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mika blushed as the others began to laugh. A trip to their old high school did sound like an entertaining idea. As soon as Kellie arrived, Katie and her friends relayed their plans to her before heading back to their old high school.<br />
<br />
Katie and her friends arrived at their old high school shortly after Kellies arrival. The school was packed for the annual North/West rivalry game. The girls alumni, West High, always was a decent football team with theie rival, North High, playing spoiler more often than not. Katie remembered a couple of times North had ruined the teams season. This year the two teams were fighting for a playoff spot in the state playoffs. The loser of the game would be eliminated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow the place is packed,&quot; Mary Elise commented. Katie nodded in agreement as she surveyed the school. Teachers, students and alumni were everywhere. As the girls scanned the parking lot they noticed a familiar teacher arm in arm with her husband.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mrs. Abbott Hi,&quot; Mary Elise exclaimed. Victoria Abbott and her husband turned, smiling at Katie and her friends. &quot;Girls,&quot; she exclaimed, rushing to hug them. &quot;So great to see you all. How have you been?&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie and her friends now talked of their college experience. Victoria listened intently, happy that some of her favorite students were doing so well.<br />
<br />
&quot;By the way Mrs. Abbott,&quot; Kellie asked. &quot;Where are Donna and Cassie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Those two decided to do some shopping,&quot; Victoria smiled. &quot;They love college though, amazingly enough the two of them want to follow in my footsteps and become teachers. Can you believe that?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie and Kellie smirked at eachother, remembering the wish that had transformed the former Donna Walters and Cassie Abbott from teachers into freshmen. Since then the two had become step sisters who were the best of friends and closer than some sisters.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who would of ever seen that coming,&quot; Kellie smirked. &quot;Anyway Mrs. Abbott take it easy, great seeing you again.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the girls now made their way towards the football field they began to reminisce about high school and the fun they had. Katie sighed hapoily as she leaned into her fiance, remembering all the adventures her and her friends had during their high school days.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Katie,&quot; Samantha called. &quot;Look, isnt that Glorias friend Felicia?&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie looked to see a shy blonde girl cheering from the sideline. &quot;Yeah,&quot; she said. &quot;Wonder why shes not with Gloria and the others?&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie now approached the young teen who was dreamily watching West Highs defense. &quot;Felicia,&quot; Katie called. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
A startled Felicia jumped before turning shyly towards Katie and her friends. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she said meekly. &quot;You startled me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Felicia and Katie now made small talk, Katie was curious as to why she wasnt with Gloria and the others. &quot;Oh,&quot; she blushed. &quot;I promised Adam I would watch him play today.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie and the others now turned to see the large freshman boy in the huddle. Adam could see Felicia waving to him, which he responded goofily to before a senior lineman pulled him back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hes really not supposed to say hi when hes playing,&quot; Felicia giggled. &quot;Still he always finds a way to acknowledge me when I come to the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie and her friends felt their hearts melt a little as they admired the innocent blooming love Felicia and Adam had for one another. &quot;So how we doing,&quot; Samantha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not good,&quot; Felicia frowned. &quot;The defense is keeping us in the game but our offense is just overmatched. North scored two touchdowns off of interceptions. We&#39;re down 14 nothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie watched as North tried to a running play. Much to her astinishment she watched as Adam read the play delivering a bone jarring hit on the runner and forcing a turnover. Felicia and all of Wests supporters erupted in cheers as Adam recovered the fumble. &quot;Way to go Adam,&quot; Felicia screamed.<br />
<br />
As Wests offense took the field Katie and the others frowned. Wests QB was a skinny kid who looked to be quite short. The other players also looked quite small in comparison to Norths defense, which all seemed to be over six feet tall. Mika and Claudia frowned before beckoning the others to join her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Mika whispered. &quot;I dont k ow about you but I didnt come all the way down here just to watch North kick our ass.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please tell me your not thinking what I think your thinking,&quot; Mary Elise sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cmon girls,&quot; Claudia said cheerfully. &quot;Whats the point of magic pendants if we cant have a little fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls anxiously looked at one another before glancing back at the field.  &quot;I dont know,&quot; Kellie said. &quot;Maybe we can come back.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Kellie said that West ran a running play in which the running back was immediatly crushed for a five yard loss. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Claudia said sarcastically. &quot;Im not like those odds.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie sighed as she looked at her friends. Shrugging she looked at her friends smiling. &quot;Well it was probably goimg to happen anyway,&quot; she smirked. Slowly the six friends gently touched their necklaces focusing on six  individual West players.<br />
<br />
Travis Rogers, the senior quarterback sighed as he received the play from rhe sidelines. &quot;Okay guys,&quot; he sighed. &quot;I kmow were getting our ass kicked but we can do this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude who you kidding were getting fucking stomped out here.&quot;<br />
<br />
A chill now ran over Travis body. Looking himself over he felt somewhat confused. The lineman in front of him seemed, larger and more muscular than before. As he glanced at himself he was surprised to see his arms seemd more muscular than he was used to. &quot;Huh guess all that time in the weight room paid off,&quot; he thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Halfback fly on two. Ready? BREAK!&quot;<br />
<br />
Travis approached the line surprised to find that he seemd taller than the North lineman. The lineman didnt seem smaller, he just felt...bigger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Set...HIKE,&quot; he yelled. Turning Travis faked a run before glancing up field. All day Travis was forced to rush his passes as North consistently broke through. Now his line was holding them at bay. Instead of the flabby linemen he had groqn accustomed to theoughout the year they now appeared monstrous, easily holding back Norths defense.<br />
<br />
Glancing up field he could see his running back, Dashaun Tyler racing into position. Dashuan was a undersized back who had decent speed but no size. As Ttavis looked at him he blinked. Dashuan now looked like Captain America as he ran. The formerly 5 and a half back now looked a foot taller with almost  60 lbs of additional muscle on his usually skinny frame.<br />
<br />
Rocketing a pass at a speed that even surprised him Travis connected with Dashuan who sprinted to the endzone. Travis draw dropped, he just connected on an 80 yard pass. <br />
<br />
&quot;TOUCHDOWN WEST!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
As Wests supporters screamed with joy Katie and her friends impishly smiled at one another. Surprised their body modification spell had worked so well.</p>
