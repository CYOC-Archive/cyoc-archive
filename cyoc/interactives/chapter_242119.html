<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You secretly loved thick and long cocks, and although you doubted your new dick was one, it didn’t fall short in titillating you. Enjoying the pleasure that was beginning to build up, you supposed that your weaker senses as a passenger were the reason why you did not perceive this a while ago. Within you, a primal desire has started to emerge as you want the same arousal from your previous experience. Of course, this time you didn’t have the opportunity to outright play with your member. However, the sensations you were currently feeling was similar to your time in the coach&#39;s body despite not directly masturbating.<br />
<br />
Wanting to indulge in this pleasure further, you placed more concentration on the abdominal area, and you felt the pressured feelings, both the arousal and the desire to micturate, increase. You had to admit that your senses began to feel very weird... as the majority of your body felt numb except the crotch. You noticed your legs have stopped twitching as the rest of your body seemed to have relaxed a bit. You could hear Evan whisper while looking down towards his legs, &quot;Huh, I swore I needed to use the bathroom just now, but I guess it was just a fluke. I don&#39;t feel anything now. Today is just so weird for me.&quot; At the end, you thought you heard him sigh a bit before uncrossing his legs and returning to grading, as if he had enjoyed the excuse to stimulate his dick; the boner hidden in his pants only further proved your belief.<br />
<br />
Inside, you were stunned by this revelation, as it seemed to show that you can also control certain body parts to perceive and move for yourself as well as your host. &quot;This...just...got...interesting,&quot; you thought. &quot;I wasn&#39;t really keen in staying in this body for too long, but I have learned quite a bit so far. Let&#39;s see how far I can push this power.&quot;<br />
<br />
Arousal still enveloped the crotch as the feeling to urinate diminished. In response, you decided to also focus your attention on Evan’s legs. Soon, the slight numbness dissipated from your lower half as you assumed control of his legs. You squeezed the legs closer together and began enjoying the feeling of Evan’s dick rubbing against his thighs. You then tried to contain your excitement as you realized you had just taken control of Evan’s entire lower half.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a group of three freshmen visited Evan’s desk to ask him to clarify a book passage. While he was doing so, you felt so close to cumming that you chose to spread the legs in an effort for the pleasure to dissipate. As the angle between your legs increased, you could feel your pants and underwear rise up as you pitched a tent. You were covertly ogling at the current scene. The top half of Evan, currently controlled by him, was actively conversing with the freshmen in a professional manner, while his bottom half was spread wide open with an obvious erection like a pervert. While his cheeks were slightly flushed, Evan continued like he was mostly unaware of what was happening to the rest of his body. You weren’t sure if your power made him subconsciously ignore it or if he was just trying to ignore it so that his students wouldn’t notice he had an erection. Luckily for him and the class, a partition below the desk surface blocked the view of his crotch, but your mind still found it erotic. Had the partition not existed, Evan would be displaying his boner to the entire class; the idea only arouses you more as you imagine yourself sitting right in front of the teacher&#39;s desk and seeing it at a front row view. As much as you wanted to take control of one of Evan’s arms to stroke his cock, you were afraid that it might make him cum, which would only interfere with his work. (Fortunately, you still intend on upholding general morality as a sign of &#39;being an adult&#39;.)<br />
<br />
As the feeling of arousal began to fade, the feeling of having to urinate returned with a vengeance. You weren’t sure how much tea you had drunk, but the need to piss was beginning to become too much, and you felt that you were losing grip on the perceptions of the legs as you slowly became worn out. Regardless of how bad you knew he had to go, you knew that Evan wasn’t going to go to the bathroom until the end of the period. Glancing at the time on the desktop from the corner of Evan’s eyes, you saw that there were only 5 more minutes until the end of the period. Unfortunately, you believe Evan was at his limit, as his bladder felt ready to release its contents. Despite doing your best to hold it, a few drops of piss still leaked from the tip of his penis. To make matters worse, the small damp spot that formed on his boxer briefs was beginning to show through his beige pants. On top of all that, your whole consciousness seemed to be fading fast as you realize that you might have pushed your luck too far. In a few seconds you would be returning to your original body, leaving Evan to suddenly regain control of his lower half; you doubt he was prepared to suddenly have to hold it in after you had been doing it for him. Noticing the impending disaster in your last moments, you could only feel sorry for Evan. Not only had you caused this entire situation, but it would be him who would have to clean up after the accident he was about to have, much to his shock. Your vision blackened to the sight of Evan cheerfully addressing his last couple of points to the freshmen&#39;s questions before the three students walked away.<br />
<br />
You gasped for air the moment your senses returned. As you opened your eyes, you realized that you were back in your own body within the bathroom. You had been away for so long that it almost seemed unusual to return. As you stood up and shook your legs to ease the numbness for sitting too long, the bell rung, signaling the end of the school day. You figured that you should head home for the day until you remembered that you were supposed to be excused from school this afternoon. So unless you were sure you won&#39;t be caught by your friends or the faculty, it might be best to not venture out during this time.</p>
