<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Their body's head dropped, 'Surprised she'd read something like that.' <br />
<br />
&quot;It's was a major symbol of the evolution of english poetry, nothing more, nothing less to <br />
me.&quot; Their body said. <br />
<br />
Their body made a small laugh, &quot;Thank you... for finally stopping being afraid to hear what <br />
I'm thinking, I think we're past the point of privacy-Janice. You know I never wanted to <br />
transmute your sisters, my biggest hope was that they'd all follow Charlene and Barbara's <br />
examples, this has never been about me being superior to any of them. And I told you why <br />
I didn't want to bring in those higher on the chain of command, because someone -like- <br />
Jasim would take interest, I don't mean someone part of another facet, I mean someone <br />
who doesn't mind taking... extreme measures to fix things that aren't at direct loss to <br />
themselves. If I had a living soulless body on hand I could just dive into the vacant <br />
apartment and allow you to live your life by the standard of your own choosing. Oh, and I <br />
apologize.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For having to force this truth on you. If I didn't consider it murder, and if I had another <br />
living body I could inhabit, I'd teleport you home, and erase anything related to the race of <br />
Messengers or Jehovah from your memory-You're kidding!- You'd go back to being a <br />
calm, rational, confident atheist who had a brush with the unknown they could pass off as <br />
hallucination or fever dream.... But why?.... -BECAUSE-, accepting that truth should have <br />
been -your choice-.... Tabra... as far as everything and everyone is concerned... I have <br />
accepted it by choice...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello. Still here.&quot; Julio reminded them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Can you give us some room?!&quot; The angel vixen barked. <br />
<br />
Julio in the name of good taste did exactly like that. <br />
<br />
Their body started, with a look of surprise on their face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tabra did we just... say the same thing at the same time? Yep. Don't worry, wasn't likely <br />
the merger, just us being on key with each other. Hopefully.&quot; The vixen continued to sit on <br />
the sandy floor before she spoke again talking to herself, &quot;You still haven't answered all of <br />
my questions Tabra. Why in the-please don't use that word- why in the Hades, would you <br />
not call on your teammates? Ashamed of your girlish figure?&quot; <br />
<br />
The fox grunted, &quot;How many times do I need to tell you those sort of things don't matter <br />
to me, to us. As for why ... that one is a little complicated. For starters the more angels <br />
involved in this greater the collateral damage could end up being. -Next excuse?- &quot; The <br />
vixen fell silent for a good minute. &quot;The civil war doesn't just happen on Earth, it happens <br />
on every world in the cosmos were life forms evolved enough to house souls. It's spread <br />
out. -And?- ...... I didn't want to make you uncomfortable by having more of ME around. <br />
Your sisters I figured you'd be able to convince yourself weren't really the same race as me <br />
now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why does my comfort matter that much to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
The vixen stood to her full hight and spread her wings, almost shaking as she shouted. <br />
&quot;Because you're this way because of -my- stupidity! You're inside my body with no safe <br />
way out because I couldn't see through one cheap stage illusion of Karther's fast enough, <br />
because I couldn't think of any way of freeing myself from Tammia's control other than <br />
using my True Power. You're possibly doomed to die all because of me! I'm an Angel of -<br />
Freewill- Janice, it's my job to remind people that others don't need to make their choices <br />
for them. And now you're trapped with no choice because of me. I came to save you and <br />
did just the opposite. At least with Karther you'd be a slave but still a person at the end of <br />
the day.&quot; <br />
<br />
The vixen wings, tail, and ears all drooped, &quot;I don't blame you, I never blamed you, I'm just <br />
saying we should take any advantage we can. And for the record, I blame Karther.&quot; The <br />
vixen her head, &quot;Karther almost doesn't exist anymore, he's little better than what you and <br />
your sisters were.&quot; The vixen crossed her arms, &quot;Poetic justice.&quot; The vixen spoke evenly, <br />
&quot;One of the point of a  carpenter turned religious reformist being executed by the state <br />
was to do away with 'eye for an eye.' It's never the easy choice to make, ever.&quot;<br />
<br />
The vixen rubbed her eyebrows, &quot;And if I was to ask you to request some of your own kind <br />
that you don't mind working with to help us before Jasim's deadline? I don't know if I'd get <br />
an answer. This is a nearly creation old civil war, everyone whose a soldier is in the <br />
trenches somewhere, weather grunt or officer, there are no desk jobs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It can't hurt to ask right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In theory. Remember, Project Return is a delicate matter, and people learning of, or <br />
seeing, and yes they will, a bunch of genies blowing stuff up will create the reaction those <br />
who want to keep the prohibition in place all the excuses they need. In particular after <br />
Karther's stunt. And some might look for justification of that point of view here. &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why does Project Return matter so much to you anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey... if some Harry Potter fans want to get a taste of what it actually MEANS to be a <br />
mage, who am I to stop them? It's about being aware of the decision at all. One of the <br />
parts of free will is about making informed decisions. Besides... many are just tired of <br />
being made to act like what they are is a crime they have to keep hidden.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I've got that. But seriously, why -don't- you just phone in for some <br />
reinforcements?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;......if that is what you wish Janice... I will... but you know Vicki and the others, no matter <br />
what now, as you've pointed out, won't accept not being a part of the battle anymore, <br />
they've made too many sacrifices as it is. You wouldn't like your species being perma-<br />
changed for nothing would you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose not...but my point still stands Tabra...what's the worst that could happen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We could attract the attention of a rebel because it's the same as saying 'Tabra is here <br />
and is vulnerable and needs help!' we're the same race after all, or we could get someone <br />
who -wants- Project Return to be terminated, or someone else whose like Jasim only from <br />
my neck of the woods.&quot;<br />
<br />
The vixen spoke carefully, folding her wings around her, &quot;Will it help, or hinder our <br />
chances of freeing Tammie and Lucy, and Natalie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It'll all depend on who answers the call, and that I can't tell, I'm not God.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;.....Give me a while to think that one over. So how bad is Jasim anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He'll treat us as intruders, including us, and your siblings as intruders letter better than <br />
Karther if he's anything like when I last met him. And don't leave him alone with Julio, <br />
EVER, in particular if Julio is unarmed and sleeping.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So why was Karther allowed to begin his kingdom here anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kitsune aren't just Japanese, many were and are desert foxes as well. Only they use sand <br />
and not leafs for a medium for their magic... Karther's ancestors had a HOME here. They <br />
weren't exactly allowed into even the 'myth' history books.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I see, but seriously Tabra, give me a second for me to decide weather or not to 'light the <br />
Angel signal' but you -should- talk to Jasim.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not sure if we have the time anymore if we're going to get your sisters in shape to live <br />
through this. Getting Jasim to help -us- rather than us help -him- is going to be a nasty <br />
trick of diplomacy... oh, and you're right, maybe it IS better you don't know the history <br />
between me and Jasim.&quot; <br />
<br />
 &quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you'll be able to see him as someone respectable, and honorable, and keep a <br />
cool and level head during a discussion with him, abilities I am sadly lacking in.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Still, if his genie army can help at all, we should accept it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm just worried what sheer amount of -chaos- an army of genies attacking a target like <br />
Karther, Tamanthis' kingdom would be. The cross fire, and 'fall out', and of course, the <br />
deadly deadly 'Mixing of Magics' could be, would be, not very pleasant for most of <br />
anyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I said, we don't need them to blow stuff up, maybe they have information we -don't- <br />
have that we can put to good use. Besides, even if they're too dangerous, there's still Jasim <br />
right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...I know. I also know you're not going to budge an inch on this, and you have a point... <br />
Come on, let's get Julio and wake up your siblings... we need to get them started on ... <br />
their 'super deluxe emergency hyper progressive training' right away. If you trust me <br />
Janice, even in the slightest, even for a moment, then trust me when I say you don't want <br />
Jasim to be the one to teach your sisters the 'art' of war.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... All right. Then we go to Jasim and learn whatever he can tell us about karther.... about <br />
Tammie's defenses and defenders and slaves?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd rather feel it would be my duty to watch them, my responsibility to. This <br />
transformation won't make them emotionless killing robots, but it WILL transform them <br />
into soldiers, -just- soldiers. It'll be their path.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then let's get it started, so it can be over with, and like you said, we're short on time, let's <br />
get it started, and go see your old buddy.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You know what I hate most?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... I wanted to give them all a chance to FLY first.&quot; <br />
<br />
-----------------------<br />
<br />
Tamthis beheld her, Karther's kingdom, and it was good. It was good she was building her <br />
kingdom for him. She wondered if she perhaps turn him into a male so she could enjoy his <br />
body like it was her duty to make sure he enjoyed hers. Maybe later if it occurred to her <br />
again. <br />
<br />
The domain of the desert foxes was now at it's former glory, and would continue to <br />
expand. Those people have lived in what was Karther's ancestral homeland after all, <br />
certainly they wouldn't have wanted to move, and it now was supposed to again belong to <br />
the kitesune, so clearly they becoming part of Karther's kingdom was the best solution. <br />
<br />
&quot;So what if I had to change their minds a little? It is for the greater good of Karther's vision <br />
after all.&quot; She said to herself. <br />
<br />
----------------------<br />
<br />
In another part of the world, -again- Keiko and Anna the five tailed kitesune, felt it. As <br />
Karther/Tamthis' kingdom grew, their senses picked it up again and again. And the taint <br />
of wolves, and so many new kitesune who were like clockwork oranges.. they shuddered. <br />
<br />
It was Keiko, the one who never wanted to fight, that came to Anna. They spoke in <br />
Japanese, much as their own thoughts used those words, this land was their HOME now <br />
after all. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's getting harder and harder to ignore isn't it?&quot; The currently female kitesune asked the <br />
currently male kitesune. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.. it is... like a bad oder of something good gone sour... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that I've had time to think about it, I'm sure they wouldn't mind the freedom of <br />
thought that comes from being one of us... if they weren't all nearly zombies following <br />
preprogrammed actions like robots.&quot; Indeed, Keiko and Anna were adapting fast their new <br />
roles in creation. <br />
<br />
&quot;Too bad their own experience being like us gonna have to be being zombie slaves, they'll <br />
never want to be kitesune -ever- after that!&quot; Anna yawned, laying on the big piece of rock <br />
near the settlement, HIS settlement in rural japan that now radiating a slight aura of <br />
spiritual power and would inspire people in a few years to start building a shrine out of it. <br />
<br />
Keiko honestly felt unease leaving the place of humans assigned to her effective, but they <br />
hadn't been with her that long anyway and didn't realize her presence yet anyway so she <br />
wasn't that worried. &quot;So.. have you decided on a name yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right now, I'm leaning towards Akira.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kekio tilted her fox head. &quot;Why do I suspect that's because that's the only male japanese <br />
name you know that starts with an 'A'?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not sure why, but you're right.&quot; Anna/Akira said without a hint of shame. <br />
<br />
 &quot;I became this way because I wanted to leave it all behind but... I feel like now that we're <br />
the same as Karther... he's our responsibility... he's the same race as us after all... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Meh, I say let Janice and the rest kick his small tailed butt. Ya know... letting humans <br />
become Kitesune like us isn't a bad thing in of itself... there are LOTS of furries on Second <br />
Life and on Yiff sites who I'm sure would jump at the chance to be upgraded with some <br />
fur and tails. Karther just wanted all of us to be his sex dolls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anna... Akira... whatever... are you sure that's smart?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As long as they actually -agree- to it, I don't see what's wrong with it. There are one or <br />
two dumb foxes around here too that I think wouldn't mind having more than one tail and <br />
having larger brains...&quot;<br />
<br />
Keiko sighed, &quot;I was thinking if we could learn something to help Janice and the rest... &quot;<br />
<br />
Anna/Akira laughed, &quot;If you think of anything that won't get us turned back into sex dolls <br />
let me know...&quot; <br />
<br />
Keiko, &quot;It's just ever since becoming this way... my mind's never felt so free.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna/Akira, &quot;Well, Kitesune are supposed to be slightly cracked in the head. Not that I <br />
really find myself complaining.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That aside... I feel it's wrong that those Karther's changed... have to get such a ... false <br />
impression of what it's like to be ... well, us.&quot; <br />
<br />
Anna/Akira said, &quot;If you come with any crazy schemes... you better NOT leave me out of <br />
them, you hear?&quot;<br />
<br />
Keiko nodded, &quot;Okay.&quot; <br />
<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
Alexandra meanwhile, as she tended to her master who acted almost catatonic when not <br />
being serviced by his queen, couldn't shake the dream she had last light. She dreamed of <br />
people who looked at small colored boxes, that she had been one of them, and had been <br />
like those before being blessed by their queen. She dreamed of wanting to become as she <br />
was now. She remembered many others she wrote letters to with the small colored boxes <br />
of both genders who desired the same thing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do such people exist? And wouldn't they be the ones who'd be the first who should be <br />
welcomed into our kingdom? Then why has our queen not brought them here? Where <br />
they'd belong? What you think master?&quot;<br />
<br />
Karther barely responded with a moan. Alexandra narrowed her brow, her programming <br />
was finding it harder and harder to create excuses for why her master was acting this <br />
way... &quot;Please my queen, find your second body so master can be made NORMAL again <br />
already!&quot; She said out load. She patted Karther on the head, &quot;But why... why doesn't she <br />
trust you to retrieve it for her? You are her king after all master.&quot; 'And why do you keep <br />
wearing that female form?' It clawed Alexandra apart inside to no end seeing him in such a <br />
body, it felt, it felt WRONG to her on every level. <br />
<br />
Alexandra looked back at Jennifer... the six armed shiva vixen merely standing at <br />
attention waiting for even the slightest threat to her king. But her actions, all seemed <br />
preset... she hadn't been like this when male, she or Gene... so why? A word popped up in <br />
Alexandra's head, one she barely understood 'robot.' <br />
<br />
The living shiva vixen just continued to stand there like a statue, her breath and moving <br />
eyes the only proof she was alive. Karther laying on the collection of giant pillows like a <br />
pillow herself. <br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Go.&quot; Lucy said to a family of wolfen and kitesune, as they were covered with sand, and <br />
creating a false human vestige, their true forms hidden underneath, the disguises bearing <br />
only a passing resemblance to their original human selves.  She stood on the top of one of <br />
the walls of the expanded, and expanded again, and expanded again city. Her wings <br />
spread to block out the sun. &quot;Go to the villages and cities not yet claimed as our own <br />
within our lands and outside it. To those inside our kingdom bring the news of our <br />
kingdom's return so they may know who is their monarch now and what destiny has in <br />
store for them. To those outside it, trade, exchange, buy and sell... so we may we <br />
recognized by other nations.&quot; <br />
<br />
The wolves and vixens underneath a disguise of sand, bowed their King's most blessed <br />
servant, and pulled their carts along the desert sands as commanded. A white flag sticking <br />
out from the wares in plain view. <br />
<br />
Yes, Tamanthis intended to expand her Karther's kingdom as far she could, as any good <br />
empire like the persians once had as example, but she her insanity still allowed her <br />
somehow to recognize that she needed to avoid fighting wars on all fronts.</p>
