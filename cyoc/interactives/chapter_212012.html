<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rick laughed throatily, smacked his lips again noisily and exaggeratedly, and ate Rico the banana in a few bites which he munched upon before swallowing them with glee. He exclaimed &quot;Yum!&quot; as he swallowed the banana down and patted his stomach as if it had been the best banana he&#39;d ever eaten. Just for show, though, because the white flesh of the fruit was nothing extraordinary or even unusual. <br />
As for Rico, he was relieved not to feel any sense of pain. Pressure from Rick&#39;s teeth, yes, sure, but no actual pain he could not voice because he was a simple piece of fruit. He felt reduced to a pulp, drenched in saliva that his new body absorbed and forced down a long tube, Rick&#39;s oesophagus. He landed into the soft, fleshy, humid and very dark prison of Rick&#39;s stomach. He even felt the wobbles of his eater&#39;s pats and the deep sound of his voice. He would have answered to Rick&#39;s taunts but he was incapable of doing so for lack of a voice and organs to make it heard. No, the only thing he could do was to wait and be slowly digest, passed through Rick&#39;s intestines, his nutrients passed to Rick&#39;s cells and organs and the remnants of who he was expelled from Rick&#39;s body through feces in great bowel movements. The mere notion of the last made Rico feel utter mortification. Ugh! Disgusting! Hopefully he&#39;d die before that happened and he&#39;d end his miserable life as a banana dissolved by Rick&#39;s gastric juices. But he needn&#39;t worry. Rick&#39;s body was changing and Rico would get his revenge, if indirectly.<br />
<br />
Rick laughed in a mean way but his cockiness didn&#39;t last. On the contrary, he started feeling uncomfortable and he started to itch himself increasingly. What was going on? He saw that under the red scratches his nails left, he saw thick, black and coarse hair sprouting. Sprouting and spreading. Then his bones elongated upon his arms and shorted sharply on his legs. His fingers altered their positions on his hands, slightly if not for his thumbs. But all his fingers became short and stubby. Hairy too. Made to grasp and pull things, not writing or delicate manoeuvres. His feet were no longer flat and long, more like hands with his big toes completely out of its proper place. Panicked, Rick realized he was turning into an ape. He screamed as he reached a bathroom and its mirror and saw that his face was next. His mouth became a muzzle with large lips, his eyebrow ridges sloped forward and his nose flattened drastically. His features transformed and soon he was incapable of speech as his vocal chords lost their humanity. He waddled a little but soon he was forced to stand on his knuckles and walk that way. A gorilla! He was now a gorilla! What was he going to do? But the worst transformation was not over yet. His bowels and lower tummy grumbled furiously and hurt as they rearranged themselves. And not just the bowels! Rick felt a powerful pinch on his groin. He started at his crotch and saw his penis and testicle retreat into his interior organs! He sensed hie testicles settling upwards and his penis separating into a set of plump labia, a sensitive clitoris and a full vagina with its birth canal and healthy anatomy. He had turned into a freshly nubile young female gorilla! And a very, very attractive one at that! Rick could sense it. He knew all male gorillas would battle and want him for their harms. And his privacy seemed to have a mind of its own, as it demanded its owner mate and settle and have a large family of sweet babies alongside a powerful male quick. Because in his vagina was an ovum. And egg that demanded nothing more that being fertilized. Yes... Yes, it was absolutely vital that it was! Rick wanted a mate and a little baby! A little baby so desperately! She was a hottie and she wanted to woo a male! Yes, she was so, so pretty! She&#39;d find a worthy strong male who could protect her in no time! She&#39;d have her pick for sure! And the idea of having intercourse for the first time... Well, if the new Rick could have blushed, she would have but... Well, it sounded...exciting... Enticing... Worthy of being a great time, to feel the virile member of a male gorilla thrusting with passion into that beautiful welcoming and willing vagina of hers... Oh!... It would be so passionate! She really needed to find that strong male at once and found a nice cozy family! No time to do what she wanted right now like grooming and eating her lice or picking leaves to eat. She went off searching for her awesome mate-to-be swiftly, her mind overridden by new thoughts and goals. Perhaps her human mind would resurface once the crucial mating had taken place.<br />
As for her egg, it did retain its human thoughts. For now, at least. The egg was Rico. He knew that Rick had become a female gorilla in heat. He would have laughed if he wasn&#39;t his very ovum!... An unfertilized egg, waiting for sperm to grant him a new body. A gorilla gamete, in his case. Which would offer him a gorilla&#39;s body. Even a female one, if he was unlucky. Better than a digested banana, for sure, but still... Would he disappear into TRick&#39;s menses if a sperm did not reach him? He hoped not... It sounded just as disgusting as the previous future he had envisioned... But Rico in his round prison started to snooze away into unconsciousness, his yet again new body expecting a sperm to arrive and start its crucial new development.</p>
