<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Still exhausted from their intense fuck session, the recently empowered superboys Will and Max discussed Todd joining their ranks. Of course, he would need to shed his grizzled middle aged body for an ideal preteen&#39;s but that was no problem for the boys who now possessed limitless transformation abilities. However, Todd interrupted, a demented idea forming in his mind. He didn&#39;t want to become any random kid like his two friends had turned themselves into. Instead, he had a specific target in mind. His son, Julian. Todd had always been resentful of the 11 year old&#39;s surprising athletic gifts and natural looks that he wasted by spending all day reading comics and playing computer games. Well now it was time to unlock his &quot;full&quot; potential...<br />
<br />
Julian woke up late the next morning. His father had not came home that night, which was quite normal for a cop, but it gave him plenty of freedom to do what he wanted at home. He had just spent the whole night reading comics and jacking off to hentai, but luckily it was a weekend. What he was not expecting, however, was a peculiar package sitting on his table. It had no wrapping or distinctive labels but definitely looked important. Opening it, he was confused when it turned out to be some sort of clothing. The fabric was extremely soft and stretchy and was colored bright yellow with some tinges of red. Was it an early Halloween gift from someone? he thought. Being a huge fan of superhero comics, Julian didn&#39;t hesitate to try it on. While he was by no means big for his age, the costume was extremely tight and barely managed to fit on his frame. He looked at himself in the mirror and could appreciate the excellent quality of the material while also noting how it made him look like a total queer.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, his whole body seemed to explode with sensation, like an immense bolt of energy had just entered him. He had seen enough superhero movies to know what this meant. Instantly, a great amount of power flooded his system, filling him with the ability to fly, transform, move with super speed and strength. Excited, he inadvertently shot a laser beam from his eyes directly through his bedroom door, forming a massive hole on it. &quot;Well shit, how will I explain that one to dad&quot;, he thought.<br />
<br />
...Julian spent the whole day playing games on his computer. Still in costume, he figured he had the whole weekend ahead of him to use his new powers, but the limited time event for the game he was playing could not wait. Still in costume, he played until it was well past dark, when his father came home. He had totally forgotten about the door he had wrecked, or the fact that he was still dressed in this ridiculous super costume. Before he could even react, his dad had seen the door, and Julian himself.<br />
<br />
Julian was confused when Todd shot him an angry look. &quot;Julian, you have all of this potential, but don&#39;t even want to try using it?&quot; Julian was confused. &quot;Dad, what are you saying?&quot;<br />
<br />
Todd continued. &quot;You got all of these special powers today, and didn&#39;t even want to try them out? You&#39;re pathetic&quot;. He got closer to Julian and used his hand to brush Julian&#39;s costumed torso. &quot;Luckily for you, I won&#39;t burden you with this power any longer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julian reacted defensively, &quot;Dad, I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re saying, but I don&#39;t like where this is going.&quot; Todd replied, still caressing him, &quot;Simple. You and I are going to swap places. I will take everything you took for granted.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julian knew something bad was up, but he still had all of his new abilities. He wound up his arm, preparing for a massive blow to his father&#39;s head, when suddenly, a blur of pink appeared out of nowhere to stop his arm dead in its tracks. It was another boy like him! Although this one was dressed even more provocatively and looked extremely confident with his abilities. As Julian prepared to fight, yet another boy, this time with a light blue lycra costume, stepped behind him. Despite being 2 vs 1 and having no training with his powers, Julian held the other superboys off valiantly, seeing as they had transferred the exact same powers into the third costume. That is, except for one crucial difference. <br />
<br />
As the boy heroes drew to a stalemate after a short brawl, Julian finally was confident in his new abilities. &quot;Try taking this away from me, you pricks! I will destroy all of you fags!&quot; Before he could land another blow on Will, who had taken quite a beating, Max gave a chuckle before making direct eye contact with Julian. Todd could only stare as Max&#39;s eyes made the classic spiral motion. Julian was stopped dead in his tracks. &quot;What are you doing to me!?&quot; he asked, desperate to control his own body. Max giggled, &quot;You&#39;re being hypnotized bro. It&#39;s the one power we didn&#39;t give you.&quot; Julian was totally panicked. &quot;please don&#39;t steal my powers and my body, dad.&quot; Will giggled again. &quot;You silly boy, he&#39;s not going to do that. You are. Now use your transformation powers to swap yourself and Todd&#39;s minds into eachother&#39;s bodies.&quot; <br />
<br />
Julian was forced to make his way to Todd, who had handcuffed himself and stripped on his son&#39;s bed. His sizable cock was rock hard in anticipation of the perfect body he was about to be given. Julian, still whimpering and begging to not be forced to do this, placed his gloved hand on his father&#39;s chest. This evil man who he had once trusted spoke out, &quot;Thank you, *daddy* &quot;. In a flash it was over. The boy once known as Julian gave a sinister grin while the middle aged man stared in fear at the three costumed kids surrounding him.</p>
