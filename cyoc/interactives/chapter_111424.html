<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brian was staring at the dour building that was the elder’s council. Hoping to see something a little more austere; he was soon disappointed that the building was a simple three story edifice that looks like it was at one time a government office building.<br />
“The building does look like shit,” Andrew seeing Brian reaction as they arrived; “but it’s by design. Wait until you see the inside.”<br />
<br />
As Brian got out of the car and followed Andrew to the main entrance; he goes over the conversation he with Andrew as they drove to here. Discussing the phone conversation he had with someone claiming to be his father George Walker; Brian pointed out that his mother told him after she called him on his cellular not to answer the house phone but to let the machine pick it up. Emily said she would deal with it when she got home from her shift at The Local Diner. With Andrew nodding as he understood and will talk with Emily and Rachael Gauldet the were-otter rep about the new development.<br />
<br />
Entering the building; Brian is blown away at the interior. Marble flooring looking freshly polished and showing a near mirror finish, exquisitely detailed crown molding bordering the walls and ceiling. The ceiling in the front foyer showing the town’s layout in beautiful detail and surprisingly up to date despite the nineteen zero eight date on the relief next to the artist signature.<br />
“The advantages of being long lived Brian, “Andrew chuckling; “the artist that painted the mural does touch ups and makes sure the painting is as accurate as the day the building was first built.”<br />
“The painter is a were,” Brian staring at the mural above him.<br />
“And on the elder council,” Andrew laughing; “Randolph our werewolf rep painted this when he was still a cub. Despite his grumpy nature, the grey wolf does have a deft paw for detail. You’ll meet him soon enough as well as the other council members.”<br />
<br />
Brian was escorted to a small alcove in which to remove his clothes and assume his fursona; coming out a few minutes later with his clothes in his paw as he walks to the front desk in his brown fur were-otter form. Seeing Andrew frog march out of an alcove; his feet now looking like flippers as they hit the ground making a distinctive slapping sound. Andrew was in his stage two form but wearing a white robe for modesty purposes.<br />
“The disadvantages of being a wer-mer kid,” Andrew watching Brian stare at him. “In my stage three form, my manhood is safely tucked away in my tail. The problem with that,” Andrew sighing; “I can’t walk about on dry land with a tail.”<br />
“Your legs turn into one,” Brian nodding; “I guess it makes sense. Do I have a uniform to wear?”<br />
“Only the custodial staff that are were-mers have uniforms,” Andrew answering; “not because they refuse to be in their fursonas; but because it’s hard for them to get about swiftly to do their task in their stage two form. I have a hell of a time walking about while in my stage two form, so the council made an exception for them to be clothed but in their stage one form. I however, as a council rep am not so lucky. How ever you will be assigned with a belt that will hold your keycard and other necessary equipment.”<br />
“So what will I be doing,” Brian asking as he enters the common area; Once again he is floored to see the large circular room, just as opulent as the front foyer. Only larger with a high ceiling and balconies from the second floor allowing those above to look down to see the large four toed animal paw set in the marble floor that Brian is walking on.<br />
“As a custodial staff member,” Andrew escorting Brian to a back area; “your duties will range from the mundane, as in cleaning up. To some of the more important tasks; acting as a runner handing messages to the various council elders and assisting helping to organize our archive room. It was pointed out,” Andrew sighing; “by Jean Talbot that most of the scrolls are in danger of being lost forever if not placed in the paws of a trusted conservator. Plus she suggested having the documents digitized in a computer archive. With your computer skills,” Andrew looking at Brian; “you might be tasked with helping that. But that won’t start until after the New Year.”<br />
<br />
Brian was led to a small office in which a large were-horse was busy filing some paper work. The stallion who smelled and heard Andrew approach, looked at the Brian the young were-otter.<br />
“The new helper you mentioned earlier Andrew?”<br />
“Yes Steve,” Andrew answering; “we’ll handle the paperwork later, but right now I would like to you to show young Brian here what some of his duties will be to start with. Oh remember Steve,” Andrew adding; “Brian is great with computers, so if the second floor card readers crap out again, let him look at the system. He might be able to figure why it keeps going down all the time.”<br />
“Okay,” The were-horse getting up; “I’ll have Brian help out the kitchen staff serve the meals to the prisoners. Plus along with some of the clean down they have to perform.”<br />
&quot;Oh and Brian,&quot; Andrew speaking on final time; &quot;Steve here is the husband to our were-mare rep. And while most reps are quite amorous with their rutting, as a custodial staff member you are bared for offering to scratch their itch as it were. So keep it in your sheathe.&quot;<br />
<br />
The eight foot were-horse approaches Brian as Andrew leaves the room. Brian hearing the hooves from Steve clop on the ground, Brian looks confused.<br />
“There are prisoners here?”<br />
“Several werewolves from the Seattle chapter of the Luna Brotherhood,” Steve leading Brian to the kitchens; “plus a certain wer-mermaid.”<br />
“Julie,” Brian grumbles; “I know why she is here, but the werewolves?”<br />
“They murdered Alyssa Cooper,” Steve quickly answers; “they will be made to account for their actions come Monday. Plus the Alpha will be made to realize that killing Alyssa was a huge mistake.”<br />
“Why is that,” Brian asking; knowing the wer-mer intimately through past encounters.<br />
“She had a son,” Steve answering; “Sheriff Cooper was floored when he heard the news this morning. Those werewolves made a five year old boy an orphan.”<br />
<br />
Brian’s eyes go wide as saucers upon hearing the horny wer-mer that enjoyed his cock was a mother. And not just any mother, a MILF. Brian sighs as he begins to feel sorry for his selfish desires at making easy money by being a gigolo. Knowing that a kid as young as he was when his father abandoned him, will know have to grow up without a mother. Brian wasn’t able to ask any questions in regards to Alyssa’s son when the were-horse escorting him ushers him into the kitchen to begin his first day at work at the elder council.</p>
