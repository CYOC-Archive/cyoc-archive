<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I needed to explain stuff to my mom. Though to do that she needed her old mind back since I didn't think she even remembered me as her son. I looked at her and said &quot;I wish that your mind is the same as it was before my last wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
My mom blinked and asked &quot;Jake, what's going on? How am I seventeen again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well this may be a little hard to believe but this ring I'm wearing actually grants my wishes&quot; I said holding up my hand so she could see the ring.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where did you get it?&quot; she asked with a glimmer in her eye. She evidently believed that the ring could grant my wishes.<br />
<br />
&quot;An old lady gave it to me for returning her purse to her when she forgot it&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you've always been such a good kid looking out for others before yourself&quot; my mom said positively glowing with pride. &quot;Could I try it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't see why not&quot; I said trying to take the ring off my finger. Unfortunately the ring wouldn't come off. I kept trying to pull it off and hurt my finger as a result. &quot;It won't come off&quot; I said in defeat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is that?&quot; my mom asked looking concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not sure&quot; I said starting to think back over my wishes. My last wish was for my mom's mind to return to normal then before that that she was seventeen. Then there was the wish that she was wearing clothes and before that that no one would think it was strange she was naked. I had wished her clothes off and before that... &quot;I think I know now&quot; I said remembering my first wish.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it honey?&quot; my mom asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My first wish was for no one to be able to take the ring off my finger&quot; I said deep in thought. &quot;That must also apply to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
My mom smiled and said &quot;Well then that's easy to fix. Just wish that you can take the ring off.&quot;<br />
<br />
I thought that over carefully. It would make sense but something told me that it wasn't that simple. &quot;Mom, I don't think I can do that&quot; I said thinking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well the old lady had this ring before me&quot; I said reasoning it out. &quot;This ring is valuable so why would she give it to me as a reward for taking her purse to her? I don't think she would unless it didn't work for her anymore. Maybe she had wished it off her finger at some point and after that it didn't work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you can give it to me then&quot; my mom said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think it works like that Mom&quot; I said thinking over the circumstances that led me coming into possession of the ring. &quot;I think that the power can only be passed on by an act of random kindness. Those kinds of acts only happen with total strangers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then you just keep it on your finger until you want to give up the power&quot; my mom said placing her hand on mine. &quot;Now what else are you going to wish for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I was thinking of becoming a girl myself&quot; I said blushing a bit. I had always wondered what it was like to be a girl. It was so bad that I had caught myself staring at girls wondering what they felt being a girl. Of course the girls thought I was staring at them in a sexual way which had caused a few problems with some of their boyfriends. When that happened I was too embarrassed to admit the true reason.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure about that honey?&quot; my mom asked breaking into my thoughts. &quot;Being a girl isn't all roses you know. Girls have to deal with a period and the bloating, cramps, and mood swings that go along with it. Then there's the fact that boys and men tend to see you as nothing more than an object to satisfy their sexual needs which could lead to rape.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that why you haven't married?&quot; I asked curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well after your father got me pregnant he ran off when I told him I was pregnant&quot; my mom said a note of bitterness in her voice. &quot;I don't want to go through that again which is why I've been very careful with the men I date. I want to find a nice one and maybe have another child. But since all the men I've dated ultimately had one thing on their mind the relationship doesn't get very far.&quot; She looked down and mumbled &quot;The last time I had sex was the day before I found out I was pregnant.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was shocked by this revelation and after a couple seconds I said &quot;Well I can fix that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't Jake&quot; my mom said with a pleading look in her eyes. &quot;I want it to happen on it's own. Using the rig to make it happen is going against someone's free will.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Mom, I won't use the ring to fix you up with a nice guy&quot; I said smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now if you still want to see what it's like to be a girl make your wish&quot; my mom said.<br />
<br />
I smiled and said &quot;I wish that I'm a girl though my mind is still the same.&quot;<br />
<br />
The wish was granted immediately as my clothes started rippling. Underneath I could feel the changes happening. There was a sucking sensation as my dick shrank and puled into my body along with my balls. I felt the same sucking and a splitting as I guessed my new female genitals formed between my legs. I felt a tugging sensation on my scalp as my hair grew out. My skin felt tight as my arms,hands, legs, and feet slimmed down to feminine proportions. I watched as my fingers grew a little longer accompanied by the tugging feeling on each of my fingers and fingernails as they grew out too. The tugging sensation was in my hips as they expanded out. A squeezing sensation accompanied my waist thinning giving me a slight hourglass shape. My shoulders were squeezed toward each other making them more narrow. It felt like my face and throat were being massaged as they changed to look more feminine. The massage continued on my ass with a gentle tugging as it grew out a bit. The same feeling was on my chest as I grew breasts. Finally I had the sensation of someone pushing gently down on me as I shrank.<br />
<br />
When my clothes stopped rippling I was wearing a light blue tee, a denim skirt, light blue ankle socks, and my shoes were gray and light blue. I ran to a full length mirror in the hall to get a look at myself. My hair hung down to about mid back and it was braided. My lips were fuller and cheeks a little higher. My nose was a little smaller I thought and my ears were pierced with little light blue studs in them. My mom came up behind me and I could tell I was half an inch shorter than her. That meant I went from five foot eleven to five foot five. I could also tell that her breasts were bigger than mine. I would guess that my breasts were a C cup. &quot;Well what do you want to do now Jane?&quot; she asked me with a big smile on her face.</p>
