<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gary was a nobody, a below average high school science teacher in a small town that he had never traveled more than 50 miles away from. He had no ambitions, no dreams, he was drifting aimlessly through life, expecting to go home to an empty apartment every night until he could retire with a small pension provided by the town, and live the last bit of his life in obscurity. It was by chance that he had met Darlene, and her two small daughters at the time. They were on the run, having escaped a similar backwater town in which she had been using her first few years as a police woman to cover for her drug dealing boyfriend.<br />
<br />
In many ways Gary was the exact opposite of Darlene&#39;s life, he was kind, stable, and with out any surprises. Everything that she had needed at the time, and just a few months later they had tied the knot and moved into a tiny home, so small that the two daughters had to share a tiny cramped room together that was more like a closet than an actual kids bedroom. <br />
<br />
The years that passed were not that much easier once Lacey and Lynn became rebellious teens, but the family seemed to make it through anything that could be thrown at them, Gary did his best to act like a surrogate father that the girls needed, and the Darlene&#39;s strength of will helped them push through what ever came their way. <br />
<br />
It was already dark by the time he had gotten home, upstairs he could see the light on to the twin&#39;s bedroom and every few minutes he could hear something that sounded like movement and scratching on the ground. He figured that they were busy watching a movie or doing some kind of occult ritual, or what ever it was that the young girls had gotten into. He swore that their interests seemed to change every few months. So he went to work preparing dinner, giving a short call up the stairs when he was finished, only for Lynn to yell that she was suffering from a headache and slammed the door. He shrugged, best not to disturb them and settled down to grade papers. <br />
<br />
A hour later headlights illuminated the living room as Darlene&#39;s patrol car pulled up. Gary dropped his red pen and walked to the door to meet her. &quot;You&#39;re home early.&quot; He smiled and gave her a soft kiss. &quot;I&#39;ll go reheat your plate.&quot; He pulled back, heading to the empty dinner table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is Lynn and Lacey home yet?&quot; Darlene asked as he picked up the plates and walked to the microwave. <br />
<br />
&quot;They both said they had headaches, I was just about to go upstairs to check on them..&quot; He dropped the plate from his hands as his wife had already started disrobing in the living room. &quot;What are you..&quot; His voice caught in his throat as his wife leapt ontop of him on all fours, pinning him to the cold tile of the kitchen floor, her rock hard nipples pressing into his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about the girls, they just want to watch.&quot; She turned his head to see his twin daughters standing at the foot of the stairs, completely nude and holding eachother. His mouth hung open in shock, his eyes lingering on their breasts as his dick shamefully grew hard in his pants. &quot;After I am done with you, you can have them as well.&quot; She nipped at his ear before using her unnatural strength to rip away the rest of her own police uniform.<br />
<br />
&quot;Darline what is happening, you... the girls..&quot; His mouth struggled to form the words that were leaving his brain but nothing but gibberish seemed to be coming out as Darlene massaged her breasts before moving down and squeezing the smaller nipples that seemed to be forming on her stomach. A line of fur quickly began to ring her neck and cascaded down between her breasts, forming a love trail all the way to her crotch. <br />
<br />
&quot;You are so lucky.&quot; Darline raised her ass into the air, one by one the bones clicked forward, forming a hairless tail that was soon engulfed with the same fur that had swarmed her crotch, ass, and was running down her thighs. &quot;Most of the men will be slaves or dead, but you, the Alpha said you were worthy.&quot; She closed her eyes as her mouth and nosed crunched, pushing forward centimeter after centimeter into a wolf&#39;s muzzle, her teeth cracking and reforming into fangs that could rip flesh from the bone. <br />
<br />
Darlene&#39;s claws ripped at his pants, shredding them into tatters until his penis rose from the the confines of his tidy white underwear. She gave a lick of her maw and moved to position her lupine crotch over the modest human dick. &quot;Darline we need to get you to a hos..&quot; The sentence only ended in a moan as his penis was enveloped in the hot wet folds of his wife&#39;s now canine pussy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just relax darling.&quot; Darline stroked her husband&#39;s head with the upmost amount of care that her new paw would allow before giving his licks a quick lap with her elongated tongue. &quot;You have been a good husband, a good father, now let the girls take care of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Girls?&quot; Gary tore his gaze from his wife&#39;s golden eyes to see two sandy blonde furred werewolves move from the foot of the staircase and began to pad over to him on all fours. &quot;Lynn.. Lacey..&quot; His head was swarming from the pharamones and that filled the room, he could feel his penis begin to expand inside of his wife, stretching and rubbing against places that he never touched before as a normal man. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, taste Lynn first.&quot; The first growled sitting to his left on her knees, he could only guess it was Lacey talking, in between the soft fur of her crotch he got a eye full of the black canine vagina that seemed to be dripping with excitement. &quot;She tastes the best.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No way! You taste so much better.&quot; A voice to his right made him look the other way only to get a even closer look at  his other step daughter&#39;s vagina, only inches away from his mouth. <br />
<br />
&quot;Girls!&quot; Darlene snapped, licking at Gary&#39;s chest before grabbing the back of his head and shoving it as deep as she could into Lacey&#39;s wet folds. &quot;Let your father decide who tastes best.&quot; She nuzzled them both as Lacey began to pant in ecstasy. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can feel him! I can feel his tongue! Dad is eating me out!&quot; She squealed as Darline smiled at the red fur that began to flourish on her husband&#39;s body. &quot;OH! His mouth is changing! I can feel his tongue getting longer!&quot; <br />
<br />
Darline moaned and pulled up on her husband&#39;s now red cock. &quot;That is not the only thing that is changing.&quot; She grinned angling herself to take him all in, knot in all. &quot;Watch and learn my darlings.&quot; <br />
<br />
Both lupine heads turned to her as in one hard push she took in every inch of his new canine cock, knot and all. &quot;Your mom has a lot to teach you.&quot;</p>
