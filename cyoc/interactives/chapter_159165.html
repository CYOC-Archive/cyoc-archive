<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle booked it to his first period class, coming in the door as the teacher was already lecturing. &quot;Kyle Perkins. You&#39;re late. Take your seat.&quot;<br />
<br />
He was already headed to his usual spot, taking off his backpack, though hearing his name hit him like a ton of bricks falling on him. He had heard Jen.. John after all. &quot;Sorry, I..&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Nolan held up his hand. &quot;No excuses, just sit down.&quot; Kyle stared at Mr. Nolan, he hadn&#39;t expected the curse to work on Jennifer, but it did, unless she paid off that dude to fake him out. And now, if it was going to work on him, he was staring at his future lover. Jen.. John had cheated though, right? He kept Kyle from answering, maybe that would..<br />
<br />
Kyle found himself staring at Mr. Nolan, his train of thought drifting away. His ass looked really, really good in those pants.<br />
<br />
Kyle shook his head. School rumor might have said Kyle was gay, but he wasn&#39;t. But here he was staring at his male teacher&#39;s ass and getting a hardon from it. Rumor also said Mr. Nolan might be gay, something about one of the seniors spotting him at a gay friendly gym. The rumor didn&#39;t hold much traction though. Most of the female students had the hots for him, and Kyle was beginning to see why.<br />
<br />
At twenty-five, he was certainly the youngest teacher at the school, but he was also super fit, supposedly having played baseball in college. As such he had a prominent chest and thick arms used to swinging a bat. His dress shirts always fit him a bit on the snug side, showing off some of his physique. Rumor also said he was pretty well hung. But he didn&#39;t wear his pants as tight as his shirt, but some student claim to have caught him tented. The usual high school bullshit. His black hair was cut short and styled up in the front, his jaw always sporting a couple days worth of designer stubble. The dark hair contrasted sharply with his bright blue eyes.<br />
<br />
Kyle didn&#39;t know how long he had been staring off at Ralph but his clothes were becoming uncomfortably tight. Mr. Nolan.. not Ralph. Without even asking Kyle grabbed his bag, got to his feet and rushed into the hallway. No one stopped him. He was trying to figure out where to go when he saw the door to one of the staff bathrooms. Single occupancy with a locking door. Students were forbidden from using it, but Kyle needed to figure out what was going on. He ducked inside and shut the door, locking it tight.<br />
<br />
Just in time, too. As the door shut, Kyle&#39;s clothes just vanished, leaving him standing in the bathroom naked. Kyle had never been the biggest guy, in fact he would usually be on the bottom of the pack. Scrawny nerd was usually a kind way of describing him. But he could instantly see why his clothes had been getting tight. He was bulking up. Not much yet, but he wasn&#39;t a skinny twig person anymore.<br />
<br />
Even in the mirror his features were changing. His lank, mousey brown hair which he &#39;styled&#39; by keeping it short enough to stay out of his eyes was starting to curl and develop a bit of a sheen, darkening to a darker, rich brown. The freckles spattered across his cheeks and nose were vanishing as his skin darkened slightly to a naturally tan color. He knew it was natural, there were no tan lines on him, and even his nipples and cock had darkened to a subtle brown. His eyes which were already brown actually paled a bit, brown, but a paler almost gold. He looked Latino, or maybe mixed? It was hard to pin down exactly.<br />
<br />
He was still growing, too. Kyle Perkins was small, the man he was becoming was definitely not. It felt like every bone in his body had turned to taffy and was being stretch out. First his feet and hands, then his legs and arms. He had to readjust the way he was leaning on the counter as he went from 5&#39;4&quot; to 6&#39;4&quot; in a matter of minutes. Ralph liked his men tall, he was no shorty at 6&#39;1&quot; but he liked even taller than him. Kyle&#39;s once mostly smooth body was also suddenly growing brown-black body hair, especially in his crotch and pits, though his arms and legs were darkening, too.<br />
<br />
His face was growing more mature. Losing that smooth roundness of youth, his features becoming sharp and angular. A dark goatee grew in around his mouth and on his chin, the rest of his jaw and cheeks darkening from a thick facial hair shadow except where his sideburns grew in.<br />
<br />
His muscles were growing in as well, lean and svelte. A hint of definition without being at all bulky, but he was definitely becoming someone who knew how to keep his body in good shape. He may be taller than Ralph, but his wolf was the bulkier between them.Kyle might even be a bit leaner than John, the man coming to mind. Him and Nate weren&#39;t bad looking, the bearish Nate looked like he could be fun, and John was pretty much a wolfish type, which Kyle absolutely loved. It&#39;s why he found Ralph so irresistible, and Ralph? Well, Ralph liked his tall lean otters. Which was Kyle to a tee.<br />
<br />
Curly brown hair was growing up his stomach in a neat treasure trail, and some spread out along his chest, thicker in the center and lightening at the sides. He wasn&#39;t the hairiest guy, but he was proud of what he had. Like everything else about him, his cock was long, 7&quot; flaccid and almost 9&quot; hard, but slim.  The changes were slowing, including his aging, seeming to leave him in his mid-twenties. Twenty six to be exact, of course he knew his own age.<br />
<br />
Clothes reappeared on his body, jeans, unlike the ratty ones that disappeared these were nicer, designer, appropriate for business casual wear. Teachers were allowed to wear jeans on Fridays. Wait. Teacher? A undershirt and button up appeared over his torso, the top button undone. No tie, but a nice vest appeared over the shirt, accentuating his trim waist. He pulled back his dark, curly hair, pinning it in a loose tail at the back of his head, a few strand escaping which he tucked behind his ear. He knew he was a popular crush among the students, not as much as Ralph was, but he had his following. Imagine if those students knew the two hottest male teachers in the school were an item. They were keeping it mostly mum for now, until they cold figure out if they could both teach at the same school and carry on their relationship.<br />
<br />
Kyle would happily change schools if he could stay with Ralph. He had never been so happy with someone. They had both started teaching at this school this year, and instantly fell for each other. The new memories were pushing the old ones down. He could still feel them there, but they were like an odd dream. Kyle Perkins was gone, he was Kyle Perez, a Spanish teacher, and Ralph Nolan&#39;s boyfriend.<br />
<br />
He grabbed his backpack, which no longer was full of his homework, but other student&#39;s homework and grading he had to do, and left the bathroom. He knew the way to his desk by heart. He had no first period class, and was glad for that, gave him time in the morning to prepare for the day. Pulling out his phone he noticed a text.<br />
<br />
&#39;Told my friend Nate I was dating, wants to meet you. Invited us over for dinner tonight, free?&#39; Kyle stared at the text, that would be dinner with Nate and the once Jennifer. It could be awkward but... he felt his hand typing almost as if on its own. &#39;Look forward to it. Lunch?&#39;<br />
<br />
He only got a smiley in response but he knew he&#39;d be seeing Ralph at lunch. Leaning back, he got to work on the papers in front of him.</p>
