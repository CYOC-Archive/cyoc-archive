<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen thought to herself for a few minutes as Kyle stood there, worry and panic washed over him, what would she do, make him an animal? Take his dick away? A thousand scenarios went through his head, all the while Jen concocted a plan.<br />
<br />
“So Kyle?” <br />
<br />
“Y...yeah?” Kyle was sweating at this point.<br />
<br />
“Tell me, do you think girls have it easier than boys?” <br />
<br />
“Yeah, I kinda do.” <br />
<br />
“And do you like you mom?” <br />
<br />
“Yeah...” Kyle twitched, where was she going with this? “Don&#39;t.. don&#39;t you do anything to my Mom!” He shouted.<br />
<br />
“Well, I figured since you like her, and she obviously loves her little boy, she&#39;d give you anything you wanted. So, tell me truthfully, do you think your mom is hot? Would you love for mommy to dominate you?”<br />
<br />
“What?” Kyle blushed, we as about to yell at her when the curse abducted his tongue, “YES, KYLE DOES THINK HIS MOTHER IS HOT, AND WOULD LOVE FOR HER TO RIDE HIS COCK.” A different voice came out of his mouth.<br />
<br />
“OH! Well thank you curse, so I was thinking, since your mother would give you anything, why not her body. For your transformation, you&#39;ll swap heads with your mom. Your new motherly body will keep it&#39;s features, but lose any of the health problems she currently has, if any at all. She won&#39;t notice this, thinking that the two of you have always been like this. Everyone around you, except myself will treat you as if your still the same teenage boy, and she&#39;s still the same middle age woman, your clothes will change to fit your new form, people will also think it&#39;s weird if you wear a bra, since they think your still a boy. Your hygiene however will change, I want to at least make this somewhat easy on you. You won&#39;t get periods, although you can get pregnant, and you won&#39;t have to worry about cleaning that new pussy of yours.”<br />
<br />
Kyle listened to this, wanting to reach through the phone and punch her. <br />
<br />
“As for your dare, you&#39;ll not use the curse on me or my family, and any new clothes you buy will be a size too small for your new womanly figure, so that it&#39;s all skin tight, so you can feel every inch of that new body of yours.” Jen laughed, “They say every boy wants to love his mother, and now you&#39;ll be closer to that body than ever. Enjoy!” <br />
<br />
Jen hung up the phone and Kyle stood there, stunned, but he didn&#39;t have any time to wait, his body forced him to hang up the phone, put on his shoes and walk out the door. Kyle whimpered as he realized what was about to happen. His mother was, definitively a milf, she stood at six feet tall, about six inches taller than him, but her curves made her a knockout. Her hips could only be described as child bearing, measuring at 56” wide, while up top her bust was an impressive 46”, making her a massive K cup, though they matched the thickness of the rest of her body, Kyle was always under the impression that they were implants, but was about to find out that his soon to be bust was all natural, pregnancy had increased an already big bust to gargantuan sizes. <br />
<br />
Kyle grabbed the door frame, trying to stop himself, but was pulled forcefully along by his legs as they marched. His mother was about to leave for work, dressed in a white blouse with a gray skirt, and sensible heels, she was about to turn open the door when Kyle practically ran up to her and lunged for her head. It pull off with a loud pop, and it was as if time had stopped, his head was removed, his mother&#39;s expression frozen in time as his body removed his head, placing them both on the table. His mother&#39;s body began to move, as both bodies stripped, exchanging clothes as they magically changed size as they exchanged them. His old body moved into the exact position that she was in, as his mother&#39;s body picked up her head and placed in on his body, it then grabbed his head, and tapped his nose with an index finger. Kyle “squirmed” as the body held him, she decided to do one last thing, shoving his face in his new massive bust, as if to gloat, then lifting him up and spinning his head around and pressing it down on her neck. <br />
<br />
Kyle shook, the new sensations hitting him were amazing and overwhelming, the massive sea of tit flesh jiggling as he shivered. Time moved forward, and his mom stopped.<br />
<br />
“Oh honey.” She said to him in his own voice. “You look pale, maybe you should stay home from school today.” She reached up and touched his forehead. “Yes, you&#39;re not going today. Go back to bed honey.” She smiled, and kissed him on the cheek. Kyle for his part tried to play the part of a sick son, still reeling from all the new sensations of his body. He shuffled back to his room as his mother closed the door, he waited to make sure that she was gone and screamed. Stomping and shaking violently, throwing things around, with every move the new, taller and curvier body he now possessed jiggling violently like jelly in an earthquake. He ran to his bedroom and jumped face first onto his bed, crushing his massive breasts, but he didn&#39;t care, he continued to scream into his pillow for over an hour, until he finally calmed down, rolling over and feeling the alien sensations that made themselves known, he tried to collect himself.<br />
<br />
He panted, looking down at the mountainous breasts that sat upon his chest, raising up and down again with every breath, Kyle would have to get used to having his mother&#39;s body, he now had no choice, although maybe he could use the curse.....</p>
