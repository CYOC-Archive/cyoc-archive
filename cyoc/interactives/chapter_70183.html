<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate slowly came to in a darkened room. He tried to move but failed. He realized that he was sitting on a <br />
chair and was bound tightly by rope across his abdomen to the chair with both his arms locked behind. Another <br />
thing that Nate realized was that he was naked, and had a fish tail. So it wasn’t a dream! Nate thought to <br />
himself with excitement as he flipped his green tailfins. But the excitement quickly changed to panic when he <br />
realized he had no idea where he was and how he got there. He tried to wriggle away from the rope but it was <br />
no use, he was stuck.<br />
Suddenly the lights went on and revealed the room. Nate was in some sort spacious, luxurious office with an <br />
indoor pool, wall-length glass windows and everything. In front of him was a large ornate wooden desk with a <br />
leather swirling chair behind it, the chair’s back was facing Nate. The chair quickly swirled around to reveal <br />
a middle-aged man in a formal suit. He had cropped chocolate hair and slight 5 o’clock stubble.<br />
 “Who are you? Where the hell am I?” Nate asked with alarm in his voice. He didn’t know what he was more <br />
worried about, not knowing his whereabouts and his identity or the fact that he doesn’t seem to mind there’s a <br />
tied up naked merman in his office. “Calm down Mr. Sanderson. All your questions will be answered,” The <br />
mysterious man said with a calm smile. Nate didn’t like where this was going but decided to keep quiet to hear <br />
what he had to say.<br />
“You see, we know about your little fantasy about being a stud merman. And by we I mean we the company that <br />
built that chroviac. There’s always that minor percentage of the Earth’s population that have fetishes about <br />
being mythical creatures; Centaurs, Nagas, Merfolk even. You would be surprise to know how many hundreds of <br />
men actually dream of being mermen. And you would be even more surprise to know that most of the rich half of <br />
the social world has sexual tendencies involving mythical creatures,”<br />
Nate was at shock to learn that there are more people like him who shared his dream of having a fish tail. But <br />
he was still angry “So what, you just deliver those devices to random peoples’ houses and turn them into these <br />
things? I mean how is the transformation even possible?” Nate argued but was secretly grateful towards him.<br />
“Like I said before, we know all about your little fantasy,” He said with a devilish smile as he got up from <br />
the chair and walked round the table. “We only send those to the people who really want it. If we sent them <br />
willy-nilly the world would go mad! And besides, don’t act like you’re all angry about this. I know you’re <br />
enjoying every bit of this, I mean you even ‘enjoyed’ yourself,” He said with a chuckle, referring to Nate <br />
pleasuring himself. Nate’s cheeks turned bright red and he hung his head low to avoid eye contact.<br />
“Now don’t be shy, everyone does that when they’re… happy. As for the possibility of the transformation… Well <br />
let’s just say the government isn’t telling the people all that they know. So after you passed out from <br />
exhaustion, our extraction team picked you up and, well, here you are,” He said as he leaned on the table, <br />
arms crossed.  Nate raised his head and spoke “I still don’t understand why I’m here,”<br />
“Remember when I said that our rich sponsors and funders like this kinda stuff. Well that’s where you come in. <br />
You’ll be placed in the aquariums and tanks floor of this building for display of interests to our clients. If <br />
they like you, then they’ll choose you for sexual stuff. You’ll be transported through a tube connected to the <br />
tanks to the secluded R&amp;R floor. Did I mention this place also doubles as a secret brothel?” The man explained <br />
much to Nate’s fear.<br />
“Wait, wait, wait! So you’re saying I’m just some kind of merman whore? That’s not fair I didn’t choose to be <br />
a merman for this! I do want this tail and fins and the buff bod but not for this price!” Nate yelled as he <br />
trashed around helplessly in the chair. Since he lacked any clothing and his cock was exposed the whole time <br />
he was flailing about, it became slightly erect involuntarily. <br />
“I see you’re not exactly being honest about how you feel,” The man said as he walked nearer to Nate. Nate <br />
looked at him in confusion then felt the blood racing and looked down and saw his dick harden. “This isn’t <br />
what it seems. I’m not gay!” He shouted but wanted some more sexual stimulation badly. “Oh don’t worry about <br />
being forced against your will. The mind frame of having your dream body will make you too ecstatic to bother <br />
about your sexuality. And besides when we changed your body, we added some hormones so you find dicks more…<br />
arousing,” He smirked as sat down on Nate’s scaly lap.<br />
Nate bit his lower lip and muffled a moan. He was resisting any impulses but was also lustful for more. “I <br />
should probably introduce myself before we get any closer, Nate. My name is Derek Thomas,” He smiled again as <br />
he grabbled Nate’s now hard dick. Nate let out a gasp as he felt Derek’s touch on his monster cock. Derek <br />
licked and played with Nate’s lips while his left hand was fondling Nate’s dick. Nate couldn’t resist closing <br />
his mouth anymore and let Derek’s exploring tongue in. They kissed passionately as their tongues explored one <br />
another, sampling their tastes. Nate’s chest heaved up and down for breath and his heart beat faster.<br />
Derek moved down to his throat and nibbled playfully. Nate craned his neck upwards, exposing more of himself <br />
to Derek. Nate let out a delicious moan and flicked his fins as he bit a sweet spot and gently stroked his <br />
dick. Now Derek was already at Nate’s left nipple. He traced little circles around it with his tongue and bit <br />
it softly while his other free hand pinched and squeezed his other nipple. Nate arched his body as much as he <br />
could. His lower tail was twitching and trashing around and he felt his muscles tightened from the pleasure <br />
and excitement building up. His dick was super hard and was throbbing with precum. As Derek played with him <br />
even more Nate felt himself climaxing “Ungh…I’m gonna…cum!” He managed to say before shooting off a huge load, <br />
screaming in pleasure as he did so. Some of the cum landed on Derek’s face.<br />
Nate was left gasping heavily as Derek stood up from him. His dick had become soft and flaccid again, part of <br />
his tail was stained with his seed. “I-I’ll do it…” He said between the gasping “I’ll be your… merman whore,” <br />
Derek brought Nate’s face up to meet his with his hand and smiled. He then gave Nate a sloppy kiss with some <br />
of his semen still on his face. It tasted sweet in their mouths. <br />
Derek pulled away from the kiss and pulled out something from his pocket. “Oh and you have to wear this from <br />
now on, at least until a customer wants to penetrate or suck you anyways,” In his hands was a black and pink <br />
jockstrap that had a large pink shell to hold his dick and the straps were made of black water-proof leather. <br />
“Uncomfy, I know,”</p>
