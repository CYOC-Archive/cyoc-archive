<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The cherry pie was delicious, and Melissa told Martha where the little bakery in town was.<br />
&quot;I admit, we&#39;re still trying to navigate our way around,&quot; confessed William.<br />
&quot;Julie is taking me on a walking tour of Moon Lake tomorrow after school,&quot; said Eric, to which everyone around the table smiled, including himself.<br />
&quot;Your first date?&quot; asked Martin Stovall.<br />
&quot;Yes sir,&quot; replied Julie.<br />
&quot;Have fun,&quot; was all her mother said.<br />
<br />
After dessert and a little small talk, it was mutually agreed upon that it was time to say goodnight.<br />
The Stovalls walked the Andersons to the front door, where they cordially parted company, with William saying that the Stovalls had to come over for dinner at their place some night, considering that they&#39;ve yet to meet their oldest son Nate.<br />
&quot;Our latest werewolf?&quot; asked Martin.<br />
&quot;Yes. He&#39;s taken to it as easily as... breathing,&quot; said William, catching himself before saying his usual comment about a fish to water.<br />
&quot;We look forward to it,&quot; agreed Melissa.<br />
As the Andersons left for the night, Julie couldn&#39;t help smiling as she heard Eric ask his mother, &quot;Can you help make me a Jacques Cousteau costume for Halloween?&quot;<br />
<br />
Martin helped Melissa clean up, and then excused himself to go over some paperwork for tomorrow in his study.<br />
Julie had gone upstairs to get ready for bed. If anyone noticed that she lingered a little longer than usual in the shower, they never commented on it.<br />
Then Melissa collected Martin and both went upstairs to tuck their daughter in for the night.<br />
&quot;That Eric seems to be quite a catch,&quot; her mother commented, as Martin adjusted the blanket on his daughter&#39;s bed.<br />
&quot;Yes, he is,&quot; Julie agreed with a big smile on her face.<br />
&quot;You think the two of you might...&quot; began Martin, wondering how to properly phrase what he wanted to ask.<br />
&quot;Someday, hopefully,&quot; admitted Julie. &quot;We&#39;re like you and Mom, but in reverse. Like Eric said, neither of us know what the future will bring, but if it is to be, I certainly hope it doesn&#39;t take us a whole ten years to get married.&quot;<br />
&quot;One day at a time, sweetheart,&quot; said her mother, before both parents kissed Julie goodnight and left her bedroom, closing the door behind him.<br />
As Julie fell asleep dreaming of Eric, Martin whispered to his wife, &quot;Our daughter is—&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes. Julie is on the were-mer birth control pill. Besides, she also promised me that she wouldn&#39;t... you know, until after high school graduation.&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know about that part,&quot; said her husband, as they entered their bedroom. &quot;You see the way Julie looks at that boy?&quot;<br />
&quot;Like you have always looked at me from the moment we first met?&quot; asked Melissa, before kissing him.<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Martin, after the kiss ended. &quot;Do you think I&#39;m worrying too much?&quot; he wondered, while removing his tie.<br />
&quot;You wouldn&#39;t be a parent, a good husband, or the man I love if you didn&#39;t,&quot; replied Melissa, while wrapping her arms around him. &quot;So, what would you like to do now?&quot; she asked, looking up at the slightly taller man.<br />
&quot;Part of me just wants to curl up in your arms and go to sleep,&quot; was his reply.<br />
&quot;And the other?&quot; she asked coyly.<br />
His answer was to grab her hand in his and move it down to feel the bulge in his pants.<br />
&quot;I think I can give you everything you want,&quot; she said with a smile.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
The Andersons walked back to their house, chattering away happily about the evening, post Yvette. With the capture of the rogue were-vixen, their future was looking bright. The new beginning everyone had hoped to find moving to Moon Lake was now on the horizon.<br />
Upon returning home, Eric went upstairs to get ready for bed, as his parents made sure everything downstairs was tidy and prepared for tomorrow.<br />
Monday was not only the start of a new week, but probably the true beginning of their new lives as well.<br />
As William went upstairs to check on the boys, Mrs. Anderson laid her purse down on the dining room table and, considering it was now almost midnight, paused to take her werecat birth control pill for Monday. <i>Someday we might try for a daughter, but not right now,</i> she promised herself, swallowing the pill with a little water from the kitchen sink.<br />
Then Martha went upstairs to find William coming out of their master bedroom&#39;s shower, drying off while sporting a nice hard cock.<br />
&quot;Is that for me?&quot; she asked, while hurriedly taking off her clothes.<br />
&quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; replied her husband, while laying down on the bed. His penis now looked like the Leaning Tower of Pisa as it wiggled in the air before her hungry eyes.<br />
&quot;How are the boys?&quot; she asked, while crawling naked into bed between her husband&#39;s legs to start licking his shaft.<br />
&quot;It may take a while before Eric falls to sleep, but Nate was already asleep when I checked on him,&quot; answered William. &quot;I could smell that he took a shower before crawling under the covers, but it still didn&#39;t hide the fact that our son is now sexually active.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; asked Martha, looking up from her position, rubbing William&#39;s cock between her breasts. &quot;I wonder who the lucky lady is?&quot; she wondered, before she started orally taking his hard penis.<br />
&quot;Couldn&#39;t detect enough of a scent to say,&quot; replied William, as he began thrusting to drive his cock deeper into his wife&#39;s mouth. As their dance continued, William began changing into his werefox form, as fur began to cover Martha&#39;s body, signalling the beginning of her change into a werecat.<br />
Neither one of them knew that their oldest son was actually gay, but was staying in the proverbial closet until he was sure their marriage could withstand the news, provided he could ever figure out when and how to tell them.<br />
<br />
The werecat licked her lips with her tongue, savoring the taste of human/werefox cum. &quot;Ready for a wild ride big boy?&quot; she asked, while eagerly mounting her husband. Her feline tail was swishing anxiously in the air behind her.<br />
&quot;You better believe it!&quot; he replied, reaching up with his paws to caress her furry breasts as his fox tail beat eagerly against the mattress in anticipation.<br />
Martha shuddered as the top knot of William&#39;s werefox penis penetrated her tight werecat vagina. The sensation of being so fulled felt wonderful as she began bouncing up and down on his hard shaft.<br />
Yet, even as she experienced the first of several orgasms, part of the werecat within her couldn&#39;t help wondering how sex with either Martin and/or Melissa Stovall would be? Not that she would ever do anything to endanger the budding relationship between her son and their daughter, <i>but cats do like fish, and I wouldn&#39;t mind enjoying either or both of them.</i></p>
