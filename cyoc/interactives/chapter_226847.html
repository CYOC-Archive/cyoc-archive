<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Andrew slowly roused, he found himself not on the bench in the VR cabin, but rather in a single bed situated in what appeared to be a rustic shed. A delicious aroma wafted through the air, the mouthwatering smell of breakfast rousing him fully from his sleep.<br />
<br />
Standing at the foot of his bed was an anthropomorphic vixen, her fur the colour of a fiery sunset. She stood tall, her svelte figure clothed in a faded blue blouse and a bottom-hugging brown skirt. Her eyes sparkled with intelligence and she carried an almost motherly aura. The sight was disorienting, to say the least.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, you&#39;re awake,&quot; she said in a voice that was smooth and rich, like polished glass. &quot;I hope you slept well.&quot;<br />
<br />
His eyes slowly trailed downwards, and his gaze fell upon a pair of gray furred paws. His heart raced, as he tentatively ran a paw across his face, the sensation sending a chill down his spine. In a daze, he stumbled up from the bed and moved towards a tall cabinet that stood against one wall. He opened it to reveal a full-sized mirror.<br />
<br />
What looked back at him was shocking.<br />
<br />
Andrew was no longer a human – he was an anthropomorphic raccoon. His body had taken on a muscular, yet nimble physique, clothed in a tan leather jacket that was worn and creased with years of use. The fur collar of his jacket hugged his neck, fluffy and warm. His beige pants hugged conforms to his lower body, ending in worn brown boots that enveloped his feet. On his head, he wore a leather pilot’s cap, complete with goggles resting lazily around his neck, their lenses gleaming in the soft light.<br />
<br />
His face bore the dark grey, almost black, mask-like patches around his eyes, typical of raccoons. A layer of soft, silver-grey fur covered him from head to toe, contrasting sharply with the black fur around his eyes and head. His raccoon ears perked up atop his head, twitching a little with every unusual sound. His tail was bushy and striped in a pattern of black and grey-like raccoons typically have.<br />
<br />
The vixen chuckled at his startled expression. &quot;You better get used to that face,&quot; she said, gesturing towards a breakfast table laden with fruits, eggs, toast and a pot of hot coffee. &quot;We&#39;ve got work to do, and I don&#39;t do tardiness. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day after all!&quot;<br />
<br />
His growling stomach pulled him from his state of confusion. It was time for breakfast.<br />
Practically inhaling his food, Andrew found himself eating much more energetically than normal. His non-human body seemed to require much more fuel. As he cleared his plate, the vixen waltzed out of the shed, beckoning him to follow her.<br />
<br />
Stepping out of the cozy confines of the shed, Andrew found himself standing on a remote island. Apart from this small building, a larger building, and a seemingly deserted runway, there were no other structures present. His eyes scanned the environment before he spotted the vixen from before entering the larger building.<br />
<br />
Following her, Andrew entered the structure to find an airplane inside. The plane’s appearance was vintage, closely resembling the likes of the P-51 Mustang and Supermarine Spitfire. Yet, the design was unique, carrying an exotic blend of the vintage aura and futuristic innovation. The paint job was the most striking feature – a blend of different shades of gray and brown, similar to his raccoon coloring. It gave it an air of mystery and familiarity all at once.<br />
<br />
Rebecca, who had been waiting at the front of the airplane, stared at him with impatient eyes. It seemed that she was waiting for Andrew to do something. Instinctively, Andrew walked to the plane and used the external control handle to open the canopy. As the canopy slid open, Andrew noticed that there were two seats inside the plane, placed back to back. It was obvious who they were for.<br />
<br />
Rebecca pushed off from the ground, her fox tail wagging in excitement as she picked up her clipboard and prepared to climb aboard the raccoon-themed vintage plane Andrew had opened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome aboard,&quot; he said, his voice now sounded different, deeper yet friendly.<br />
<br />
Rebecca hopped in, a sense of excitement in her eyes. She quickly adjusted herself in the second seat and buckled up. <br />
<br />
Andrew entered after her, sitting straight in the front seat where he pushed a button that slid the canopy closed, trapping them comfortably inside. He buckled up as he adjusted himself to the seat, putting his goggles on soon after.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve got to make a trip to Celestite Cliffs,&quot; Rebecca declared, her eyes skimming over the clipboard in her hands. &quot;They&#39;ve got a cargo of precious Bluestone jewels that need to be delivered to Silversand Harbour.&quot;<br />
<br />
As she dictated the details of their mission, Andrew pressed the proper switches and knobs to start the plane. Before long he had the plane rolled onto the runway, the large building providing a proper exit to it.<br />
<br />
The plane’s wheels beneath him rolled easily on the smooth tarmac. He could feel a powerful vibration starting to build, a tangible symbol of the horsepower latent within the plane. <br />
<br />
The vibrations in the plane grew in intensity until they were powerful enough to make Rebecca voice shake slightly as she relayed the final details; a familiar feeling propelling him to steer forward down the long stretch of the runway. With each passing second, his speed increased, the cool morning air rushing past the plane’s metallic skin, whistling over its wings, and streaming past its tail.<br />
<br />
Finally, reaching the adequate speed, Andrew could feel the primal urge of flight coursing through him. It was time. Flexing the wing flaps, he eased the nose skywards and started lifting off the ground. Like a massive bird, he spread the wings and ascended into the sky. <br />
<br />
The view was incredible. Andrew maneuvered the plane through the air, its engine&#39;s powerful hum a comforting score as they soared higher and higher, leaving the small island behind.<br />
<br />
Rebecca was silent, merely lightly stroking her clipboard as she marveled at his ability to pilot with such fluency and finesse. Finally, they were free of the ground and coasting through the open sky. The thrust of the engine vibrated through the plane’s entire frame, a sensation entirely foreign yet exciting as they embarked on their first mission.</p>
