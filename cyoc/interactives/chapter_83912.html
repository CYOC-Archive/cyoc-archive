<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie looked over the five elderly women sitting in front of her. The ring probably had the power to age all of the women at the same time but Katie was a little apprehensive. She had only tested it on herself and her mom so far. What if it didn&#39;t work on anyone else. Katie believed that her best bet was to regress the women on at a time. Now who should she test it on. She looked at Mary Elise.<br />
<br />
Mary Elise had expressed the greatest longing to be young again. From their brief conversation she seemed like a kind and gentle soul, it would only be fitting that she should be the first. Katie prepared herself and made her wish. &quot;I wish Mary Elise was really young again,&quot; she silently wished. The ring glowed softly and Katie now waited for the regression to begin.<br />
<br />
The first signs of regression began to appear as Mary Elise reentered her 50&#39;s. Strands of Auburn hair began to mix in with the gray and white. The deep lines in her face smoothed slightly as she reached 55. Katie was shocked by the transformation she was now 10 years younger than before the white in her hair had vanished replaced by a combination of gray and red. &quot;Never thought she was a redhead,&quot; Katie mused as Mary Elise went from 50 to 49. Mary Elise&#39;s auburn hair was quickly returning removing the gray from her head almost completely. Her hair also seemed to be growing as it cam loose from its bun and cascaded down to her shoulders. Slight wrinkles remained around her eyes and mouth but they were beginning to fade the younger she got. At 45 Mary Elise was a beautiful and mature looking woman but the regression was far from complete.<br />
<br />
Mary Elise&#39;s beauty began to shine as she re-entered her 30&#39;s. Her skin tone began to even as she hit 38. Only a few gray strands remained in her long auburn hair that now flowed past her shoulders. As Mary Elise hit 35 the gray vanished completely from her auburn locks a few small wrinkles around her eyes remained and her skin began to look brighter. She shown with the vigor of a woman entering her early 30&#39;s and still the regression continued. <br />
<br />
As Mary Elise became 29 the wrinkles around her eyes vanished leaving her skin smooth and flawless.Her auburn hair cascaded to the middle of her back almost containing of life of its own. It bounced with fullness and life as she laughed. Her eyes, a light shade of blue, seemed vivid and full of eagerness at the prospect of what was to come. Now 25, the same age as Kellie, Katie could see what Mary Elise was talking about. At this age she was a knockout. A trim figure with beautiful legs, full b cup breasts, long luxurious auburn hair and a beautiful face full of kindness. Katie sat back in her chair crossing her arms. The ring had worked perfectly transforming Mary Elise from an elderly woman to a beautiful young 25 year old woman. Katie was about to start regressing the others when she noticed her ring, it was still glowing. Panicking she looked up at Mary Elise.<br />
<br />
Mary Elise&#39;s regression wasn&#39;t complete. Now only 21 her face was smooth and radiated youth. Still a beautiful woman she now more closely resembled a college co-ed instead of a mature professional woman in her mid 20&#39;s. Her breasts remained full but seemed to be a little perkier than before her hips and waist also had slimmed slightly. Katie began to think what could have gone wrong. The ring had worked perfectly before why would make Mary Elise so young then it hit her. &quot;I wasn&#39;t specific,&quot; she yelled. The group of women stared at Katie curiously for a moment. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she apologized and began to think. &quot;I said i wanted her real young I never gave a specific age the ring works just fine I just messed up.&quot; Katie glanced over at Mary Elise and winced.<br />
<br />
Mary Elise had left her 20&#39;s behind and was now barely 18. Her auburn hair had taken on a more reddish tone and was straighter than before no longer possessing the volume of her 20&#39;s. She had also lost some of her curves, especially in her waist and hips. Finally her breasts, while they remained b cups were not as full as before but certainly perky. As Mary Elise went from 18 to 17 Katie noticed that Mary Elise was now shrinking as she went through puberty in reverse. &quot;I better think of something quick,&quot; Katie thought as Mary Elise shrank another inch becoming 16. &quot;If Mary Elise isn&#39;t Kellie&#39;s friend maybe she can be mine.&quot; Katie looked at the ring and wished for Mary Elise to be 10 years old. &quot;Hope that does it,&quot; Katie thought as she crossed her fingers and watched Mary Elise closely.<br />
<br />
As Mary Elise became 15 Katie could see that her curves continued to melt away. Gone was the beautiful and mature woman in her 20&#39;s, now a teenage beauty just entering high school. Mary Elise continued to shrink as she became 14. Her breasts were beginning to deflate and her hips were barely flared revealing a slender girl who was still pretty but only a child to anyone who saw her. She had also lost a total of 5 inches of height during her regression causing the peach flowered sundress to move from her knees to mid calf. As Mary Elise went from 14 to 13 she lost a couple of were now more the inches in height. The hem of her sundress now rested just above he ankles. Mary Elise&#39;s breasts were now the size of softballs and still deflating. Finally a small spattering of freckles dotted her nose and cheeks. At 12 Mary Elise shrank another inch her curves had completely vanished and the only sign of womanhood remaining were her baseball sized breasts. The sound of something hitting the floor directed Katie&#39;s attention to the floor.<br />
<br />
Mary Elise&#39;s beach sandals had fallen off her diminutive feet leaving the poor girl barefoot. The tips of her toes barely grazed the ground causing the young girl to begin swaying he legs slightly. As Mary Elise went from 12 to 11 her feet completely left the floor causing the girl to begin to swing her legs back and forth. Mary Elise&#39;s straight red hair had lost it volume and auburn tone, now bright red and falling to the middle of her back. Her sunhat began to ride lower on her head threatening to completely cover her head. Freckles dotted her face and cheeks leaving her an adorable child. Mary Elise finally reached her tenth year. She lost another inch in height, the hem of her sundress grazing the top of her feet. Her childish face, smooth skin and beautiful eyes conveyed a picture of innocence. Katie held her breath and looked at her ring. It finally had stopped glowing. Mary Elise shook her head as if in a daze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary Elise,&quot; Katie asked cautiously. &quot;Are you okay?&quot; &quot;Yeah I&#39;m fine,&quot; she said cheerfully. &quot;Just got lost in a daydream.&quot; Katie sighed, Mary Elise seemed no worse for wear. &quot;Thanks for inviting me out with you and your sister.&quot; Mary Elise said. &quot;You have no idea how excited I was when you invited me to the beach.&quot; &quot;No problem Mary Elise,&quot; Katie said with a smile. Katie glanced at the other women if she was going to make any of them younger she realized she need to be more careful with how she directed her wish. Now with that knowledge she thought about who should get younger next.</p>
