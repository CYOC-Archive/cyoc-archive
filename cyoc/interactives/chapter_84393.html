<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Two young girls, about the age of 18, walked through the forest on their day off from school. One was named Nina, a naive and easily excitable girl who loved to take risks and try new things all the time. The other girl was named Scarlet and she was the only person crazy enough to be Nina&#39;s friend. Scarlet was willing to try new things just like Nina was, though she was usually the more sensible one of the two and tried to get them both out of trouble while Nina was just ready to accept whatever was thrown her way.<br />
<br />
The two girls were now walking through a forest not two far from their neighborhood, wondering if their was anything interesting to do on their day off from school. They had been walking deep into the forest for about an hour now and did not manage to find anything interesting.&quot;Ugh, it&#39;s already been an hour and we still haven&#39;t found anything. I mean really, not even a skull or a treasure chest or anything like that.&quot; Nina whined in disappointment as her friend just kept on walking. &quot;There&#39;s gotta be something around here. My sister said she saw an abandoned house in this area.&quot; Scarlet replied  with an unsure tone in her voice. &quot;I really hope your sisters right because there aren&#39;t going to be any skulls or treasure chests on the way back and it&#39;s a really long walk.&quot; Nina stated. <br />
<br />
The girls walked on for another twenty minutes and failed to find any trace of a house or any similar structure. They decided too stop and rest for a bit since they had walked for quite a while without stopping. &quot;Alright, lets go back&quot; Scarlet said while unhappy that they couldn&#39;t find anything after almost an hour and a half of searching. &quot;But we need to find it first.&quot; Nina replied with a sudden change of mood. &quot;didn&#39;t you want to leave just a little while ago?&quot; Scarlet questioned. &quot;I do want to, but I don&#39;t want to leave knowing that this was a waste of time.&quot; Nina said trying explain her point. &quot;Fine, we&#39;ll keep looking, but only for another ten minutes, it&#39;s getting late.&quot; the girls friend stated with a slight frown on her face. <br />
<br />
They walked on for another ten minutes, deeper into the forest. It was now late in the afternoon and the sun was beginning to set, but the two friends decided to continue anyways hoping dearly to find the house they were told about. <br />
<br />
It had been another ten minutes and Scarlet decided for the both of them that it was time to head back. &quot;But it can&#39;t be that far away.&quot; Nina pleaded even though she didn&#39;t even believe her own words. &quot;Come on, we aren&#39;t going to find it and you already know that we won&#39;t.&quot; Scarlet said already walking back towards home. &quot;But...what if...&quot; Nina paused as she notices something about twenty yards away. It was light reflecting off of glass that caught her attention. It wasn&#39;t certain to be the right house, but it had to be a house. &quot;Scarlet! I think I see it.&quot; Nina yelled to her friend who was already a few yards away from her. Scarlet turned her head and walked closer to her friend. She was just about to grab her friends arm when she noticed it too. &quot;Alright, but this is the last place we&#39;re searching okay.&quot; The girls ventured into the direction of the reflecting light, Nina eager to find out what it was while her friend was less amused. <br />
<br />
They reached it and, sure enough, it was indeed a house. &quot;Yay! Lets raid it and see what&#39;s inside.&quot; Nina said mischievously. &quot;Nina we can&#39;t just go in, what if someone actually lives there?&quot; Scarlet remarked as the house did look like it was in good condition for being abandoned. &quot;Oh come on, who would live out thins far into the...&quot; Nina was interrupted as a figure opened the door. Both girls screamed as an older lady stood before them, dressed in robes that looked ancient. &quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to frighten you.&quot; the old lady replied to the two girls screams. Both girls said that it was alright and that they had heard that the house was abandoned. &quot;Of course it isn&#39;t, in fact it&#39;s a store&quot; The old lady stated while the girls looked at her in disbelief. &quot;What kind of store?&quot; Nina asked being very interested in what she could buy from a store so far into the forest. &quot;I sell things that I make and things that I find out here in the forest.&quot; the old lady stated with a small grin. &quot;Can we take a look?&quot; Scarlet asked being curious too at this point and also wondering what she could buy. &quot;of course, come in.&quot; the old lady motioned the two girls in so they followed her, waiting to see what interesting things there could be.<br />
<br />
The girls thoughts of buying interesting things soon turned to thoughts of what a waste of time this had all been. The old lady was selling furniture, flowers, and weirdly shaped rocks. The old lady soon noticed the girls disappointed expressions and decided to offer something sure to attract their attention. &quot;I do have a specialty item that I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be interested in.&quot; The girls decided to find out what it was before they left in a last minute attempt to amuse themselves. the old lady pulled out a bottle filled with green liquid. &quot;This is the &#39;nine lives&#39; potion. This will give you eight more to your already single life.&quot; the old lady stated seeming very confident. Nina couldn&#39;t help it and started laughing at what the lady had said. &quot;You actually think that a liquid could ever make that possible?&quot; Nina said still laughing slightly as she spoke. &quot;Oh don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m certain it&#39;s real, many have bought it before and have experienced it.&quot; the old lady seemed so certain at the idea and both girls felt pity for her. The lady must have been so poor from living out in the forest that she would try to find a way to sell a regular liquid in order to make money. She had to have been desperate and the girls felt sorry for her. &quot;Okay, how much is it?&quot; Scarlet asked wanting to help the old lady with her likely money problem. &quot;It&#39;s only five dollars.&quot; At this both Nina and Scarlet were shocked that the old lady would sell it so cheaply if she had troubles with money. The girls bought it anyways and headed out the door. &quot;Oh, I must worn you, each time you pass away, you may find that you&#39;re a bit more feline that you previously were.&quot; the old lady said quickly, but Scarlet and Nina were too busy thinking about how absurd the idea of the potion was to actually notice what the old lady had said. <br />
<br />
It was now getting dark and the girls needed to head home. &quot;Great, if we hurry we might make it back in time for dessert.&quot; Scarlet said unhappy that it was getting so late. &quot;Well hey, we at least have something to drink right?&quot; Nina said with a giggle. Scarlet was not as amused but was thirsty. &quot;this is probably just water with food coloring, I saw something that looked like food coloring on a counter in that lady&#39;s house.&quot; Scarlet reassured Nina and herself. &quot;Then drink some then&quot; Nina replied playfully. Scarlet was unsure if this was a good idea or not but knew that she was very thirsty. &quot;What could it hurt, we have a good hospital in our town anyways&quot; Scarlet stated while knowing that it was still a bad idea. Scarlet took of the cork on the bottle and began drinking. &quot;This is actually really good.&quot; Scarlet surprised her friend with her remark. &quot;Wow really...give me some then.&quot; Nina demanded and took it from her friends hand and began drinking. It tasted magnificent to both of them. &quot;Well this definitely isn&#39;t water. I wonder what&#39;s really in this?&quot; Nina said wondering what it could be made out of. The girls finished the bottle and continued walking back home, thirst quenched and ready to finish the days adventure.</p>
