<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
On this world there are twelve tribes based on the Zodiac and mythical races. Some of these tribes are hi-tech (H) with more advance technology then us, most are low tech (L) ranging from Dark Age to caveman level technology, and  a few are around our modern tech (M).  Gender also differs tribe to tribe, and humans who go there might find they don’t play for the same team as before, some races are born one only one gender but can change later in life if conditions are met [M2F][F2M], some races are hermaphroditic in one form or another[M&F], some tribes have only one intelligent gender that visiting humans can become and the other gender is made up of mindless drones [Mf][Fm] and a few tribes have a more or less normal male and female set up [M=F]. Most tribes produce something that the other tribes need, wool, milk eggs, honey, extra. Sometimes one tribe will keep members of other tribes as livestock (usually hi-techs do this to lower techs) but mostly they trade for stuff.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Aries (L) [F2M] Diurnal, Trade: Wool<br />
Satyr-like and mostly covered in black wool save their face and breasts. They stop ageing in their mid-teens to early 20s until age 50, at which point they turn male and their wool turns white and they resume normal aging, still not all live to 50 so there is a hi female to male ratio. The Aries tribe are nomadic hunter gatherers who mostly set up camp on the mountains and grass planes. Wild Aries tend to stay away from big cities and any ware Aries are keep as sheep. Visitors form earth will find they de-aged, those over 50 will become a 30 to 50 year younger male and those 20 or younger will find themselves a female the same age (maybe a year or two younger). Visitors between 20 and 50 will become a female between 20 and 1 year old at complete random.<br />
<br />
Taurus (M) [Mf] Diurnal, Trade: Milk<br />
Basically Minotaurs, but a bit more human in the face, sill have bull horns and ears thou. All true and visiting Taurus a male, despite being humanoid the females aren’t capable of human speech or complex thought and are treated as livestock even by their own mates, if Taurus tribe wasn’t completely herbivories they might even eat their females, other tribes do. The Taurus females are breed as dairy cow, the males need to ingest their milk daily to survive. Taurus society is a lot like modern day ranchers, this can vary depending who they trade will, Taurus who trade with low-techs will be a bit more old school and futuristic if they trade with hi-techs. <br />
<br />
Gemini (H) [M&F] Nocturnal, Trade: Tech<br />
By far one of the most human-like tribes on Zodiac, a little monkey-like around the ears, feet and tail remarkably human like in appearance. Gemini comes in twos, and by that I mean every male and female Gemini is conjoined together by the ends of their black and white striped tails, both are considered half of a whole Gemini, visitors will soddenly gain an opposite gender twin, added note, if a Gemini’s tail is cut both the male and the female half will die. The Gemini are the highest of the hi-tech tribes, they live in the biggest cities and leave growing food to lower tech tribes, trading gadgets for their needs. They don’t keep livestock themselves but sometimes Taurus and Sagittarius in their employ do.<br />
<br />
Cancer (L~H) [M2F] Aquatic, Trade: None<br />
The Cancer tribe are large gray lumpy amphibious four armed mutants that like to live in the sewers under cities or at the bottom of the sea. The Cancer tribe has the amazing ability to regenerate lost body parts, with the exception of male bits; if those are removed it triggers a change in the Cancer turning it female. In the wild, the Cancer tribe is violent and animalistic bottom feeders, bull males will “De-man” revile males and then claim them as new mate when they turn female. But a small number of Cancer wore cybernetic enchanted by the Gemini and Aquarius tribes. Cyber Cancers are mostly workers and servants in the cities, they consider themselves better off than wild Cancers. Most Visitors choose to be upgraded to cyber Cancers, they can choose to be turned female or remain male during the operation free of charge.<br />
<br />
Leo (L) [M=F] Nocturnal, Trade: None<br />
The Leo tribe are an anthro or Ware-beast like race that have components of several different predators, lion, hyena, bear, wolf, extra.  Visitors will be happy to know that you will retain your original gender with this race, unfortunately Leo gender characteristics are kind of the reverse of earth. Male Leo’s are submissive and less muscular, have longer manes longer leg higher singing voices and have lactating breasts; males still have balls and a dick. Female are the more aggressive gender, they are twice the size of the males and have reproductive organs not unlike female Hyenas, instead of a slit female Leo’s have a long fleshy tube they use to suck the baby juice out of there mates junk and a couple of balls of their own underneath; females still have breasts of their own. Both male and female Leo faces look pretty androgenic. The Leo tribe live in cave in the forest and hunt for their food; some cities keep Leos as pets.<br />
<br />
Virgo (H) [Fm] Diurnal, Trade: Honey<br />
The Virgo tribe is a fairy like all female race. Visitors be warned, if you have become a Virgo and are post pubescent you are already pregnant. Unfertilized egg sill develop in Virgos, the just develop as mindless male drone; sex is only needed to create another female. Drones look like smaller versions of the one that birthed it, the even look and sound female by human standers but has a retractile penis; drones also don’t have wills of their own and can only eat the honey their mothers lactate instead of milk. Every Virgo is a queen, and like to live as such, they are a hi-tech race that focused more on the arts then the others so their cities are the most beautiful. The Virgo tribe are also the most connected tribe and the only tribe that can safely trade with the Scorpio’s.<br />
<br />
Libra (L) [M=F] Diurnal, Trade: Eggs<br />
This tribe looks like Harpies with bright red hair. Libra’s start life genderless and gray feathered, we don’t know how it works but if the Libras good it will turn white feathered and female, but if it’s bad it will become black and male. Visitors, no matter how good or bad they wore on earth will start gray and will be judged male or female by their actions on Zodiac. The Libra tribe has a wild village in the tree in the forest but the vast majority of Libras are kept as live stock by other tribes, Libra eggs are a staple food on Zodiac, female Libras outnumber the males and females ley eggs twice or more a day. Don’t worry, most Libras farms are run by the Libras themselves now a days.<br />
<br />
Scorpio (L?) [M&F] Nocturnal, Trade: Silk<br />
Wild Scorpios are the scariest monsters on Zodiac, and with the exception of turned visitors all Scorpios are wild. Visitors beware, Scorpios will eat members of any tribe including their own and unlike the Leo or Cancer or Capricorn tribes Scorpios are not animalistic, they were pretty cloths they make from their own silk and can hold a civilised conversation, and still they will only see you as their next meal. Scorpios have four legs, four arms two of witch end in claws, an acid spraying tail and two web shooting breasts. Scorpios look 100% female but their tails double as male genital, but getting pregnant fatal for they give birth to a brood that eats them from the inside out. Visitors are recommended to get fixed. The Virgo are the only ones the regularly trade with the Scorpio. We don’t know how advance the Scorpio are, rumour has it there is a secret underground city, we do know that they hunt in the darkest depth of the forest.<br />
<br />
 Sagittarius (M) [M=F] Diurnal, Trade: None<br />
Centaurs, that is what the Sagittarius tribe look like, Visitors top halves tend to look the same as they did human, but the bottom halve isn’t garneted to match the top. White coat means you’re a stallion, black means mare, your tail will match your hair. The top halve has nothing to do with the gender of the centaur, only the horsy bits and those are assigned at random to visitors it would seem. The Sagittarius tribe are traditionally farmers, they tend to live in the farmlands owned by big cities, they are also quite fast, faster than earth horses, and are used as steads for other tribes.  <br />
<br />
Capricorn (L) [M2F] Aquatic, Trade: Oil<br />
Female Capricorns are huge wale sized seal mermaids that can swallow a man whole.  There young however look like adult sized male Aries. In exchange for looking after their young, the Aries nomads are given some of the valuable oils the Capricorns’ bodies produce.  The male Capricorns will grow up on land and return to the coast every mating season. Only the biggest male is allowed to mate, and he will mate with every female on the beach, but the act of mating will trigger the change from male to female, the male will leave with the females out to sea and by next mating season he will be fully female and mate with the next biggest male. Capricorns don’t have any real tech and are mostly thought of as predators by other aquatic races.<br />
<br />
Aquarius (H) [F2M] Aquatic, Trade: None<br />
To say the Aquarius start female and turns male is a bit misleading. They start life genderless but female looking mermaid, this mermaid has a womb without eggs, at the age twenty this mermaid will be taken by two ”fish-men”, they may both look male one of them is female and will lay eggs in the mermaid with her ovipositor and the other will fertilise.  After the mermaid gives birth to those two children she will change into a fish-man herself and gain a gender. Visitors will start as a mermaid and will become a fish-man of their former gender. The Aquarius tribe lives in a hi-tech under water city, they aren’t as advance as the Gemini but close.<br />
<br />
Pisces (L) [F&M] Aquatic, Trade: Ink<br />
The Pisces are octopus girls with tentacle legs and no arms, and if you think you see two kissing they are really doing something else. See what looks like a mouth tong are a pussy and dick, their mouth is down between their tentacles so if you see them shove a fish up there don’t worry they are just eating. Pisces also have two ink sacks that look like boobs. Pisces live in and around the underwater city, they are fishermen of a sort and supply the seafood market of Zodiac.</p>
