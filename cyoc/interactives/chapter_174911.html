<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tom actually volunteered this time, knowing that his best chance for a &quot;fun&quot; role was still 2/3. He did not want to be stuck as being Willa&#39;s maid at all. So he got up and walked over to Diana, and reached into her cleavage, only to receive a playful light slap on his face. &quot;Oh fine then, I&#39;ll forgive you because you volunteered so eagerly&quot; Diana continued to joke.<br />
<br />
Top found a paper and quickly withdrew his arm. He looked down and couldn&#39;t help but grin. <br />
<br />
&quot;Knight/Hero&quot;<br />
<br />
Again, Diana shot a magic orb that threw Tom into and through the wall. Under her breath Diana whispered to herself &quot;Honestly, I had the paper in my hand, and would have just let you pick. You did not have to do the same thing as the first boy, nor did I ever ask you to do so. But I guess you are not entirely at fault either, so I will split it 50/50 with you.&quot; <br />
<br />
Tom was eagerly waiting his change. He was to be the Knight/Hero! And everyone loves the Hero. Tom&#39;s smile shattered.  &quot;Fuck!!!&quot; He shouted, realizing he is now also engaged to his best friend Will, now Willa. &quot;God damn you Will and your pre-set romances!&quot; <br />
<br />
While Tom was carrying on, Willa was also taking it poorly. &quot;Oh my god, why? Why of all people in this world, does this stupid pervert have to be my future husband? Well, whatever. I can always just charm him or something if he is bothering me&quot; gripes Willa covering her forhead with her hand while she massages her temples. In the end, all she could do was continue to watch him though.<br />
<br />
Tom, who finally calmed down a slight bit, took a look at his body again. He definitely had gained a bunch of well toned muscles, although for some reason, he still felt like he had still gotten smaller overall. A full suit of light weight armor appeared on his body, as a helmet covered his entire head. He moved around a bit getting a feel for it. It felt like nothing, as if he wasn&#39;t even wearing it. Yet he could feel just how strong it truely was. &quot;Awesome&quot; Tom whispered to himself. <br />
<br />
However then something felt off. It was as if his body proportions were shifted a bit. Looking down, he thought that he still looked the same. And confirmed that to be the case with his hands, running them along the armor. But he still couldn&#39;t shake this weight off his chest that something was now a miss. <br />
<br />
Then it dawned on him. His excitement turned to panic, as he pulled his hand inside of the full body suit, through the arms, leaving a lifeless arm to dangle down his right side. Not that his arm was free, he quickly inspected his body. <br />
<br />
If you could see his face, it would have turned pale. His chest was way too swollen and soft for just normal pecks. While they were not big, they were 100% boobs. Inspecting his dick only confirmed that Tom was in fact the one who is a miss, in the literal sense. Tom was a girl. But qfter thinking about it quickly, she felt that that she could likely pass for man still. Her boobs while not flat, were not too big either to the point she couldn&#39;t hide them if she kept them inside her armor, compressed, or even taped down. And her hair was short-ish like usual, though now it did reach her shoulders. But she could pass it off as being part of her character. Men often had longer hair in fantasy games anyways. The real issue was her voice, but even that too could be made to sound deeper. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, I can do this.&quot; Tom said, testing out her &quot;manly&quot; voice. She felt that it sounded perfectly like her old self, and walked back into the main room. Her character info appeared on the big screen too.<br />

* indicates a title that was given by an immensely stronger being at the time<br />
<br />
-------<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck is that last title?!&quot; Laughed Rachel. &quot;Hey Willa, your offhanded comment apparently has given him a title.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Willa? You there?&quot; Asked Rachel again, this time tapping Willa&#39;s shoe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm? Sorry, I was just a little bit... distracted.&quot; Replies Willa, who has yet to look away from Tom. Something wasn&#39;t right. She knew Tom, and that was certainly still Tom, but there was something different. It was very subtle, but there was definitely a new feeling coming from him that apparently the others couldn&#39;t pick up on. Was it from the Holy part perhapse?<br />
<br />
The more she thought about it, the more she felt that it was something else besides his holy aspect. It was more like something about his body had changed somehow. Well, level wise, he certainly is now a lot weaker than Willa, and he looked just a bit shorter too. This would need further investigation. <br />
<br />
While, Willa was still concerned over Tom,  Diana continued by holding out her hands, which were balled up into fists, in front of Rachel and Christina. &quot;Go on and pick which ever hand you want&quot; she instructed. The two girls looked over both hands and both decided on taking the one closest to the other person.<br />
<br />
Rachel opened her paper and was content with her result.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorcerer&quot;<br />
<br />
That also meant that Christina&#39;s role was the one she herself created. An orb was directed towards both girls as the flew off in opposite directions.</p>
