<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff laid in bed staring at the ceiling.  He knew he had arms and legs again, but he hadn&#39;t moved a muscle in over a day and moving again under his own power felt strange somehow.<br />
After a few minutes there was a knock at his bedroom door, and Mike poked his head in.<br />
&quot;Hey Jeff, are you um... awake?&quot;<br />
Jeff turned over and for a moment just stared at the utterly sexy man standing in his door frame.<br />
&quot;Jeff?&quot;<br />
Mike&#39;s second inquiry shook him out of it enough to respond<br />
&quot;Yeah Dad, I&#39;m awake&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh good, you seem back to normal.  Mostly anyway, wow you look a lot older.  Fuck listen to me, is that weirder than you turning into clothing?  Forget that, can you move?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah&quot; Jeff waved his hands to prove he could.  <br />
&quot;Legs too?&quot; Mike gestured down to his feet and as Jeff lowered his gaze he got lost in the pleasurable memories flooding back to him.  A really big grin crept onto his face thinking how much he really wanted to be wrapped around his Dad&#39;s feet again.<br />
Mike put his foot back down, a look of concern furrowing his forehead.  &quot;I&#39;m worried about you, I don&#39;t think it put you back together right&quot;  Mike walked over to the chronivac &quot;Error, Recombinant DNA transference detected during transformation sequence.  Error Recovery 97%; Subject Jeff: Stable&quot;<br />
&quot;Something went wrong, but I don&#39;t have any idea what this means.  It says error recovery in progress and that you&#39;re stable so I guess that&#39;s good?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah dad, I feel fine, just taking a bit to get my bearings back&quot;<br />
&quot;Ok, well, please do me a favour and stay inside today until you do.  I need to run some errands... but maybe I should stay&quot;<br />
&quot;Dad, I&#39;m fine&quot;  Jeff forced himself to swing his legs over the edge of the bed and stand up, and promptly tripped over his feet and fell flat on the ground.<br />
Mike rushed over, his glorious foot just inches from Jeff&#39;s face, some loud buzzing sound &quot;... Jeff... Jeff... JEFF!&quot; Jeff recognized his dad calling out and somehow managed to push himself back up and dusted himself off like nothing had happened.<br />
&quot;I think my legs are a different length, maybe?  but it&#39;s like riding a bicycle or something, stop worrying&quot;<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; Mike pulled Jeff into a strong hug, Jeff found his head buried in between Mike’s pecs and was once again breathing in Mike&#39;s scent &quot;I&#39;ll be back in a couple hours&quot; Mike pulled himself away and headed for the door.<br />
Jeff didn&#39;t snap out of it until he heard the front door close, &quot;Oh, Bye dad&quot;.<br />
<br />
Something was definitely different, he had barely stopped fantasizing about his dad&#39;s body for a moment since he was back to human.  As far as he could recall he&#39;d never been interested in his dad before today.  Not like that anyway.  Jeff sat down and clicked &quot;show more details&quot;<br />
&quot;Recombinant DNA transference error; 8% original data lost due to high effusion of bodily excretions from subject Mike.  Merging algorithm with Temporal and Cognitive compensations applied to increase compatibility and restore subject viability.  Mental acuity diminished while background cognitive changes continue to run, ETA 5 minutes&quot;<br />
&quot;Dad&#39;s sweat got mixed up in my DNA?  That is so fucking hot.  It’s like he’s still all over me inside and out.  And I&#39;m still changing apparently?  What&#39;s the end result?&quot;<br />
beneath the message was a list of his new stats with 97% complete next to the top<br />
Age: 23 years old<br />
Gender: Male<br />
Sex: Male<br />
Height: 5&#39;4<br />
Weight: 130lbs<br />
Eye Color: Cyan<br />
Hair Color: Brown<br />
Hairiness: Slightly Hairy<br />
Sexuality: Gay<br />
Fetishes: Chronophilia:Daddies 100%, Olfactophilia 90%, Podophilia: 80%, Objectophilia 75%<br />
All listed Fetishes apply to Subject Mike 150% affinity<br />
Perception of Reality: partial<br />
<br />
&quot;That all looks normal to me... oh shit wait.  Partial Perception of reality?  So like, I know things have changed, but I have no idea what actually changed?&quot;<br />
Jeff clicked through some other menus trying to find backups or even a list of his previous stats, no such luck.<br />
He looked around the room and saw pictures of himself and his clothes lying about.  He picked up a picture and checked the date on the back.  &quot;I was a teenager just a couple days ago?  That&#39;s so weird, my teen years seem like years ago.  Oh my eyes are a different color now too.&quot;  He reached down and grabbed some of his old clothes off the floor and held them up for comparison, &quot;And I appear to have gotten shorter&quot;.  Jeff put on some track pants that were now way too big for him and sat back at the desk<br />
&quot;That list of fetishes is so hot.  Are they mine though, or did those come from Daddy.  Wait no. I haven&#39;t called him Daddy since I was a kid.  Hmm... Daddy.  Oh Daddy&quot;  Jeff closed his eyes and pictured Mike standing in his room hugging him.  &quot;Oh yeah Daddy &#39;&#39; Jeff opened his eyes and looked down his hand masturbating furiously inside the oversized track pants &quot;yup that&#39;s definitely a new feeling.  That must mean these things came from him?  or relate to him somehow?&quot;<br />
Jeff clicked back to the list of subjects.  Mike was listed in recent targets but with an &quot;Out of Range&quot; message.<br />
&quot;Guess I&#39;ll just have to wait until he gets back.&quot;  Jeff noticed the other sock in the hamper, picked it up and held it to his face &quot;Ahhh yeah there&#39;s that Daddy smell&quot;.  Jeff got up and went to his dad&#39;s room, dumped his dad&#39;s hamper onto the bed and rolled around in it, revelling in the smell.  &quot;This this is new too, but fuck Do I even care if I&#39;m not what I used to be, this is awesome&quot;.  Jeff piled a bunch of his dad&#39;s underwear into a makeshift pillow, inhaled deeply, then fell asleep, not waking up until a couple hours later when he heard Mike&#39;s car in the driveway, &quot;Yes! Daddy&#39;s home&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff ran to the door and practically threw himself around Mike in a big hug as soon as he stepped inside &quot;Hi Daddy, welcome back&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey Jeff, you feeling better now?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yup, I&#39;m feeling great&quot; Jeff breathed in his father&#39;s scent and sighed<br />
&quot;Clothes don&#39;t fit anymore?  I guess the recovery didn&#39;t fix your age?&quot;<br />
&quot;Naw, I&#39;m shorter and older than I was before&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s so strange.  You look like you&#39;re in your mid twenties now.  Maybe we can fix your age or height later, but not before double checking like absolutely everything&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure daddy, if that&#39;s what you want.  You can can double check me all over&quot;<br />
&quot;Jeff?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah Daddy?&quot;<br />
&quot;I get that you&#39;re glad to see me, but let me get in the door, eh?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sorry&quot; Jeff let go, and Mike moved over to the fridge to put some groceries inside.<br />
<br />
Jeff watched for a few moments, &quot;You know, you missed the game last night.  I&#39;m sure we could find a rerun or highlight reel&quot;<br />
&quot;Huh.  You know, with all the weird stuff that happened yesterday I totally forgot about it.  It wasn&#39;t even playing at the bar last night&quot;<br />
&quot;Well how about we watch it together?&quot; Jeff sat down on the couch and turned on the TV<br />
&quot;Well this is strange, I&#39;ve never known you to be this into the game?&quot;  Mike Grabbed a couple of drinks from the fridge and sat down on the couch<br />
&quot;Yeah but you like it and I&#39;m a lot older now, This way we can spend time together.  Stretch out, enjoy yourself&quot; <br />
Jeff wasn&#39;t sure where this newfound confidence was coming from but it seemed to work and Mike turned on the couch and stretched his legs across Jeff&#39;s lap.  &quot;Like this&quot; Mike asked jokingly.<br />
Jeff gently grabbed Mike’s closest foot and started gently rubbing it.  &quot;Exactly like that&quot;<br />
Mike seemed to be struggling a bit at first, but the massage felt really nice and he relaxed into it.  <br />
After a few minutes of Jeff&#39;s ministrations Mike&#39;s eyes were shut and he wasn&#39;t paying attention to the tv anymore.<br />
<br />
Jeff took more initiative and flicked his tongue over Mike&#39;s toes.  Mike giggled and pulled his feet back quickly.  &quot;Hey now kiddo, none of that.  I&#39;m still your dad.... even if you are older now and I did umm.. wear you for a day.  Sorry about that.  How did it feel?  Being my sock?&quot;<br />
&quot;Daddy you worry too much, it was fine, I&#39;m fine.&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just... Why are you calling me Daddy?  You haven&#39;t done that since you were a kid.  Did it make your body older and your mind younger?  And to be honest It&#39;s kinda weird you&#39;re being so physical towards me&quot;<br />
Jeff pulled back like he&#39;d been burned by fire.  Oh course his dad wouldn&#39;t be into him this way.  Jeff was the one affected by the transformation, not Mike. &quot;I dunno, I just feel really close to you right now&quot;  <br />
Mike&#39;s brow furrowed &quot;I&#39;m glad you feel close I guess.  I... I need to go to the washroom.  Mind if we pause the game for a few minutes?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure, no Problem dadd--dad&quot;<br />
&quot;Thanks&quot; Mike got up and headed to the bathroom<br />
Jeff cursed under his breath then quickly but quietly made his way to the chronivac.</p>
