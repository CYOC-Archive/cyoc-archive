<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Their body blushed as Janice listened to Tabra mentally curse again and again. Janice <br />
wondered if she should says something but honestly was worried -what- to say in a <br />
situation like this. Finally, Tabra manage to say in a civilized voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Then I guess I'm lucky, that it passed midnight just before you made your ultimatum <br />
Jasim.&quot; Tabra said. <br />
<br />
The angel on the white camel's eyes narrowed. &quot;Mere luck for you. But I shall honor what I <br />
said. You will either accept our aid in the destroying of the kitesune the next day, or we <br />
shall take matters into our own hands the day after.&quot; <br />
<br />
Janice could hear a lot of what Tabra was thinking, most of seemingly relation go how <br />
Jerusalem belonged to no one. She could feel Tabra's burning desire to say them to this <br />
being. However, Tabra also knew they were in a situation that could change from bad to <br />
worse very quickly and unreversable.   <br />
<br />
&quot;Very well, see you already.&quot; Tabra teleported their body back their underground safe <br />
house. <br />
<br />
&quot;Tabra... you were male before and... didn't you say that once that you altered your name <br />
just to fit the revisions to your body? How did that... Angel know to call you Tabra?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've had a female body before, one of our encounters was me wearing a female form, and <br />
before you ask, Angels normally don't -have- genders, we were created before the <br />
concept was even invented, one of the reasons we don't marry or reproduce the old <br />
fashioned way. And before you ask, ALL souls are gender less, you really think one tiny <br />
chromosome matters that much against an immortal spirit?&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
Their body sighed, 'Am I that predictable?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I just think I'm starting to know you that well. We have forty eight hours to rescue <br />
Tammie now Janice. Remember the collateral damage types I mentioned before? Jasim is <br />
one of them.&quot; <br />
<br />
Their body dry washed their furry hands, &quot;We were supposed to have a lot more time to <br />
prepare for this weren't we?&quot;<br />
<br />
Their body nodded, &quot;Yes. A lot more. I intended us to scout out the place before hand so <br />
we wouldn't be marching into their defenses blindly. I was planning on giving our recruits <br />
time to develop their own fighting styles, and ... possibly starve off us merging into one <br />
person.&quot;<br />
<br />
Their body shivered and had a scared look on her face, &quot;What are you saying?&quot;<br />
<br />
Their body had a look of guilt, &quot;If we had more time to put the rookies through enough <br />
training to enable them to better support us, and enables to fight smarter rather than <br />
harder, we wouldn't need to resort to extreme measures to save Tammie from herself. <br />
Karther is just a shadow of himself now, the person he was barely even exists anymore, <br />
Tammie is the real danger now, and the one the djinn will target when they make their <br />
attack. The kitesune desert kingdom is almost it's own force now, a chain of self spawning <br />
events ever cycling. Hopefully tough if we disable the heart of it then the djinn won't see a <br />
need for a full scale invasion.&quot; <br />
<br />
Their body clenched her fists she said intensely, &quot;Stop tip toeing around things Tabra! Tell <br />
me! What extreme measures! Spell it out for me!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You and I need to die. If not before the battle, then almost certainly during it. And then <br />
trust that our child manages to save Tammie in our place, and she manages to lead Vicki <br />
and the others to survival.&quot;<br />
<br />
Their body spoke with dismay and anger, &quot;You said when this whole stupid thing was over <br />
you'd ditch this body and leave it to me to work out!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That's what I said... before Jasim and his fellows decided that they weren't interested in <br />
waiting... I'm sorry Janice, I'm just so sorry...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...what are our chances if you and me doing it alone? With my sisters helping us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If we had seven more days, pretty good though one or two of us might still get killed. Just <br />
one day to finnish preparing? Laughable. Even with Julio and us putting them through the <br />
meat grinder, I had broken down EVERYTHING to the bare minimum of time needed for <br />
them to be fully ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Any chance of bargaining for more time?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Zero! Jasim and his teammates WON'T budge on this.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Why are they so fixated on striking now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Besides the innocent people still being targeted? Karther's kingdom is now expanding <br />
beyond it's agreed upon boundaries, that good enough for them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Karther kingdom, and the one Tamthis is building is stagnant, frozen, never changing, <br />
never evolving, just existing, like a city of lifeless statues. Tamthis' kingdom, will be like a <br />
domain of puppets. It's even worse than what Karther's little frozen kingdom would have <br />
been, at least his robots were showning signs of evolving into people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alexandra... his first 'covert' I saw your memories remember? She'd had the template <br />
applied to her so long ago she was beginning to learn how to be her own person again, <br />
wasn't the person she was, but at least she was learning to make her own choices outside <br />
of her programming.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And with Tamthis they're frozen the way they are?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who knows? Maybe in a couple centuries the slaves will begin to think again, but there's <br />
no way to know, and it doesn't matter anymore, we attack tomorrow just before dawn. And <br />
if we can't save Tammie in that time, the loss of life will be staggering.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are our chances of survival now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As we stand? We best hope is ONE of us living through this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;.....And if you and me... die... before... by being one person... what are our chances then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not sure, only she'll know for certain, but the chances our more of your siblings, her <br />
aunts, living through it will be much greater.. the whole is greater than the sum of it's <br />
parts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if we try to force it along?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She'll be born insane.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But, you said we needed that to happen, for... for the chance of saving Tammie OR more <br />
than one of us living through this...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I did, not to mention the endless number of slaves who will be caught in the crossfire.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;HOLY ****!&quot; Their body's ears flattened against their skull, Julio came running into their <br />
chamber, &quot;Please don't tell me I felt who I think I felt!!!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You did Julio, you did.&quot; Their body said cooly and melancholy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oooooooooooh, ****-****-****-****-****-Cr********p!&quot; Julio began randomly kicking <br />
and punching the walls. <br />
<br />
&quot;They've met?&quot; Janice asked idly.<br />
<br />
Julio glared at their body, &quot;If you can call 'Die Abomination!' Knowing someone!&quot; <br />
<br />
'Julio's rather bias on that subject.' Tabra thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's not here,so I assume you didn't mention me!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You just keep up your reality hacking and cheat sheet using and he won't, I don't think <br />
he'd violate my safe house... or at least I hope not. He gave us till the end of tomorrow to <br />
do the job, or the djinn will clean things up -there- way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julio cursed again. &quot;So now what?&quot;<br />
<br />
Their body shook her head, &quot;First, we'll need to skip socialization and rest. I can't get <br />
everything into their heads I hoped to get into their heads that I hoped to. But I might be <br />
able to hammer enough of the fundamentals into that they won't make any mistakes like <br />
the amateurs they are. The only thing really working for us is that Tamthis' army is made <br />
out of mostly 'robots' or 'mindless animals.' Also... I'm going to let you hack us-WHAT?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?!&quot; Julio exclaimed at the same time as Janice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, you get to test your tricks on a Angel's spirit and that of another mortal being... what <br />
you've never been allowed to do... I need you to hotwire my spirit and Janice's so the <br />
triggers that'll cause us to die will occur in a way that our child isn't born mad.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Now hold on! You've got another passenger in there remember? What about HER opinion?<br />
&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Janice?&quot; Their body spoke. &quot;You saw with this time limit our chances our winning are <br />
awful, but if we do this... the chances of saving Tammie, and Karther's slaves, and all my <br />
sisters, will go from absurd to possible?&quot; Their body nodded and said, &quot;Yes.&quot; The voice <br />
was grim yet stern, &quot;Then do it.&quot; <br />
<br />
Julio fell on his back side, in all the years he had lived, all the centuries, these eons. He <br />
never imagined, even once, that T' would ASK him to screw with his/her spiritual insides.<br />
<br />
Julio sounded hesitant and unsure, something that so unlike him that it made even T' feel <br />
uneasy, &quot;So uh, how do you want to do this? Do you guys want to spend one more day as <br />
separate people? I can jury rig it to happen next time you both fall asleep. Or do you er, <br />
your child to take care of training the newbies in their emergency panic combat crash <br />
course?&quot;<br />
<br />
Their body signed and sat down, even though time was no longer even in the slightest on <br />
their side, 'Janice......this training we're about to put your sisters through, it won't drive <br />
them mad or make them stop feeling for their loved ones (including you and their <br />
families), but they'll be soldiers, just soldiers, it'll be a PART of their mentality.' <br />
<br />
'You know they've already burned their bridges behind them. And it looks like I have too.'</p>
