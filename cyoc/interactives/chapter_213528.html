<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Okay everyone, I think it&#39;s time for this stream to end. It seems everyone enjoyed the Chronivac, and since we have a better idea of what it does now I&#39;ll plan for how we will use it for next week. I&#39;d like it if I could interview everyone who was apart of the show as well, and don&#39;t forget to send photos! I&#39;ll be uploading pictures later this week, but unless you want it to be just screen shots of tonight&#39;s stream then please send pics! I&#39;d love to have one of Raggedy Annie working the fields and of Hailey and Jake on a date.&quot; Allison held up the cat in her lap. Her hand slid down her back giving a long loving pet. &quot;I&#39;ll handle Ava&#39;s photos myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that she waved by and logged off. She held the cat up to her face, and it gave her nose and gentle lick. &quot;That was awesome! This was my best stream ever!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ava mewed in agreement. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, let&#39;s do an experiment. Mew once for yes, and twice for no. Can you understand me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mew.<br />
<br />
&quot;And now for a control question. Are you a dog?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mew, mew.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, do you remember being human?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mew.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you enjoying being a cat?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mew.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright. Well, how about we look at some post stream reviews?&quot; Ava mewed in agreement and the two continued to read what people were saying. Most of them was positive, some thought it was fake. A few pointed out it doesn&#39;t matter if it was fake, it was well edited and the actor&#39;s reactions were well done. Some of her old viewers didn&#39;t care for the direction of the stream but they were out voted in the comments.<br />
<br />
One private message was concerning. He identified himself as Zach, and said he was a friend of Ava&#39;s. Apparently her parents went to talk with her and were worried when they found her room empty, with the cloths she was wearing oddly left in a pile on the floor. They were calling all of her friends to see where she was. Zach had apparently been on the fence on whether or not his friend had really turned into a cat until he got the call.<br />
<br />
Allison realized that she may have gotten herself in trouble. She could see missing person&#39;s ads of Ava and Annie. Then there was Hailey. Allison wasn&#39;t sure if they were at Jake&#39;s place, hers or away at college, but whenever she went to talk to her parents she would have trouble convincing them that they had a daughter now. How would her own parent&#39;s react when her sister came home for that matter?<br />
<br />
They may have been in different cities but any cop would do a internet search history to see of anyone had contacted them and lured them away. Once they saw recordings of the stream, it was a quick check to see if any of her other viewers and volunteers went missing and her next stream would be from a jail cell.<br />
<br />
Did jails have wifi? Doesn&#39;t matter. She looked at Ava. &quot;We may have a problem. I should send you home.&quot; Ava mewed twice. &quot;Well then what? Am I just supposed to use the Chronivac to fix this?&quot; Ava mewed once. <br />
<br />
With a sudden epiphany, Allison remembered she could do just that. Opening up the options, she saw options to make reality changes. &quot;Well, where would a witch be without her familiar.&quot; Ava mewed in agreement. &quot;This can fix everything. Let&#39;s make a few alterations and smooth things over for you and the other volunteers.&quot; Allison though about it for a moment. &quot;Actually, we can use this to help make things more interesting for our next stream. What do you think?<br />
<br />
Ava&#39;s encouraging mew was the only confirmation Allison needed before she began furiously typing, designing a new reality for herself and her viewers.<br />
<br />
                                 Josie and Rachel <br />
Josie sat in the backseat of Rachel&#39;s car. They sat in the dark with the car in driveway of Josie&#39;s house. It was late enough that no one would be watching. Usually she drove, but Rachel had decided to take charge tonight. Her mouth was open as she breathed heavily and tried to suppress her moans. Rachel&#39;s hand was underneath her skirt and fiddling around the inside of her panties.<br />
<br />
Josie finally lost the battle to remain silent as she had her first female orgasm. Rachel smiled and leaned in to kiss her. She slid her tongue into her girlfriend&#39;s mouth, silencing the cry of pleasure. Pulling back Rachel whispered. &quot;I really enjoyed our date tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So did I.&quot; Josie gasped. <br />
<br />
&quot;We should stay like this. I have a lot more to show you about the female body.&quot; She continued. <br />
<br />
&quot;You could show me now.&quot; Josies said.<br />
<br />
Rachel put a finger to Jose&#39;s lips and shushed her. &quot;Patience. Learning techniques takes time. You don&#39;t want to rush your lessons.&quot; Rachel had originally intended to return to normal after the end of the date, but ever since being changed into a lesbian she began to feel differently. <br />
<br />
&quot;You make a compelling argument.&quot; Josie said, finally catching her breath. &quot;We should head inside and see how Allison&#39;s stream went. We can talk about how long to stay like this with her.&quot; Josie adjusted her panties back into place and straightened her skirt before exiting the car. <br />
<br />
The two quietly entered the house, hoping to sneak upstairs without waking her parents. Surprisingly both of them were there waiting. It was then that Josie realized that her parents wouldn&#39;t recognize her, and probably was wondering why Rachel had shown up with a strange girl.<br />
<br />
However, she was shocked by their response. &quot;There she is!&quot; Her mom said. She reached out and gave her a hug. &quot;You&#39;re so beautiful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her dad smiled. &quot;Takes a tough guy to jump the gender fence for a better understanding of women. I&#39;m proud of you son...er...daughter? That doesn&#39;t feel right. How does kiddo sound?&quot;<br />
<br />
Being released from the hug she looked at him. &quot;I&#39;m fine with kiddo. It&#39;s great.&quot; Josie briefly wondered why people would refer to boys as son instead of their names, but she had never heard of someone saying daughter in a similar way. Her dad was right, it oddly didn&#39;t sound like a good equivalent. &quot;So you saw the stream? &quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
Her mom responded. &quot;Not live but we caught the highlights afterwards. Allison came down to tell us about it when she was letting us know we needed cat food and kitty litter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josie filed that under questions for later. She shifted, feeling the breeze underneath her skirt. &quot;So you&#39;re okay with it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course.&quot; Her dad assured her. &quot;If I was still young I&#39;d try it myself. It&#39;s a great way to know what women want and how to be a better boyfriend or husband.&quot; He wrapped his arm around his wife. &quot;I however, am not looking for anyone new.&quot;<br />
<br />
His wife smiled. &quot;Maybe not, but I think we could still learn a thing or two. Maybe this summer we could return to our 20s and trade rolls for our second honeymoon.&quot;<br />
<br />
He smiled. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t mind playing your blushing bride for a week.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Make it two.&quot; She told him. &quot;I&#39;ve been wanting to go on a big trip for awhile. &quot;<br />
<br />
Returning his attention to his new daughter. &quot;What about you? How long do you think you will stay like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Josie looked at her girlfriend and remembered how her fingers felt inside her. She felt a dampness between her legs. &quot;I&#39;m considering on getting a thorough education.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel smiled at her sexy new girlfriend. <br />
<br />
                                   Ava&#39;s Parents<br />
The parent&#39;s of Ashley Brown had gotten a phone call from a lovely young lady who had directed them to a recording of a stream that explained where their daughter was. They had finally finished calling everyone and telling them that she was alright. <br />
<br />
Mr. Brown sighed. &quot;Our little girl is a cat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mrs. Brown gave a chargrin smile. &quot;We can&#39;t say it isn&#39;t a complete surprise. Remember how many magicians she asked to turn her into a cat when she was little?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I didn&#39;t know it was possible. Certainly didn&#39;t expect her to sell herself off as a pet either.&quot; He said exasperated. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well what did you expect her to do as a cat? Finish high-school? She doesn&#39;t even have thumbs, how is supposed to take the tests?&quot; Mrs. Brown put a comforting hand on her Husband. &quot;Allison seems like a great young lady. She even talked Ava into turning into a human to talk to us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Brown rolled his eyes. &quot;Her name is Ashley. I never really liked that Avarice name she called herself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mrs. Brown shrugged. &quot;She was Ashley when she was our little girl. Now she is a cat and her owner named her Ava. Personally, I&#39;m glad she found the owner she did. Allison has promised to bring Ava to visit, as a human even. Though we will be telling everyone that she is Ashley&#39;s boyfriend Adrian since Allison will be a boy when she visits.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her husband grunted. &quot;She&#39;s 18. She was bound to leave the nest soon anyways. What is important is she comes home to visit, and that she&#39;shappy.&quot; She assured him.<br />
<br />
Mr. Brown smiled. &quot;I guess you&#39;re right. This isn&#39;t what I imagined for our little girl but it&#39;s her life.&quot; He thought about it for a moment. &quot;You think Allison could make us younger? I&#39;d like to have some grandchildren that aren&#39;t kittens.&quot;<br />
<br />
His wife laughed. &quot;Are you volunteering to have the next kid? There&#39;s a reason I didn&#39;t want to give birth after the first one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Brown gave a cocky grin. &quot;Maybe I am. How did that old song go? I can do anything better than you can?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mrs. Brown sang one of the lines. &quot;I can wear a sweater.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will fill it better.&quot; Mr. Brown add libbed. The two kissed and laughed at their jokes. Though they may not remain jokes for long.<br />
<br />
                                  Jake and Hailey<br />
It was the day after Hailey had watched the stream with her new boyfriend Jake. Hailey remembered everything about being a boy and her hesitation at changing. She had only suggested the bet because she had been so awkward around girls, and she just wished she could date someone. Having Jake turn into a hot girl would have solved her problem.<br />
<br />
After his performance in bed after they had left the stream, she was glad she was the one who lost. Jake was packing some series heat below the belt, a lot more than Hailey ever had and he certainly knew how to use it.<br />
<br />
Walking around campus, Hailey found everyone she knew somehow recognized her. A lot of them congratulated her and told her they liked her new look. Since Hailey had taken to dressing very provocatively she was sure they enjoyed the view. <br />
<br />
Finding everyone&#39;s acceptance of her identity despite her extreme physical changes, Hailey had messaged her. Apparently the Chronivac had been used to make sure everyone could enjoy their changes by smoothing over people&#39;s perceptions and avoid certain awkward questions. Hailey had called home to see if they would recognize her.<br />
<br />
As Allison had promised, they did and were excited to meet their new daughter the next time she was home from college. Hailey had been the middle of three boys, and both of her brothers were looking forward to having a sister now.<br />
<br />
Hailey smiled as she practically glided across campus. While the Chronivac had overhauled her appearance and opened her mind to new interests, mostly in bed, she still had the same mind. She was still a genius, still a nerd at heart with her love of sci-fi and comics, which had already led her to plan out her new sexy cosplay at the next convention. Everything was coming up Hailey.<br />
<br />
                      Jamie and Raggedy Annie<br />
Jamie stood next to his father at the field the school&#39;s FFA used to grow crops. As promised, he was taking a photo of Raggedy Annie in its new workplace for Allison&#39;s photo album she was creating. His mother was home selecting a few other pictures of Annie as a human. She had picked photos of her on the school&#39;s softball team and dance team to show off the scarecrow&#39;s diverse interests outside of just protecting the fields. She now was looking through photos of Annie when she was younger to send along as well.<br />
<br />
Jamie personally thought the only photos from when she was younger that should be sent was of her in her Raggedy Ann Halloween costumes. While starring at his former sister, his father began to speak. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am proud of you Jamie.&quot; He said. His father was a large man, built with muscles from doing agriculture work with a thick mountain man beard that had begun to gray.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are?&quot; Jamie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you to find your own scarecrow for school, and you did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Allison was the one who turned Annie into a scarecrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And where ever you bought one from would have been the one to make it. Even if you made one yourself, someone else would have picked the straw you used, or sewn the cloths you put it in. Making it from scratch and going to class would have been impossible. It wasn&#39;t about not getting help to get a scarecrow. I just wanted you to arrange the help yourself. Besides, Annie only offered herself as material for the scarecrow because you&#39;ve been such a good big brother and she wanted to help you. Inspiring that kind of love in others is a sign of a good man.&quot; Jamie saw his father smile down at him.<br />
<br />
Jamie gave an embarrassed shrug. &quot;I&#39;m not so sure of that. I think Annie just wanted to be a doll of some kind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But she became a scarecrow for you.&quot; He looked up at Raggedy Annie where it hung on a post surveying the field that was now devoid of crows. &quot;I&#39;m proud of Annie too. Not everyone is willing to go threw such extremes to help family. She&#39;ll probably will have to repeat a grade for this, since the harvest is still a couple months away.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie hadn&#39;t thought of that. Everything had happened so quick when Annie had returned to his room all dressed up. He barely had time to volunteer her before Allison could chose someone else. He would make it up to her somehow. Maybe he could find a change she would enjoy to see on him. Annie had often said she wanted a sister, maybe she would like having an identical twin. Jamie briefly wondered if his father would still say he was a good man if he started spending weekends as a copy of his little sister.<br />
<br />
                                        Allison <br />
Allison smiled as she posted photos the volunteers had sent her. Hailey had sent a lot of photos in skimpy outfits and bikinis, as well as her on her knees in a Slave Leia cosplay. Jake held the other end of the chain around her neck. Hailey was starring at his pant&#39;s zipper and gave the caption that she was ready to &quot;Service Jabba&#39;s Hut.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jamie sent photos of his sister in various school teams, as well as what he called her time-line to becoming a scarecrow. It include her Halloween costumes from 5, 10, and this past Halloween that he had mentioned. <br />
<br />
Finally she added a screenshot of her sister kissing Rachel a fan sent her, as well as some photos the two had taken while going around town.<br />
<br />
Allison turned towards her cat, who had done her own photo shoot earlier, lounging around the house. Allison was still waiting for some pictures her friends and family were gathering of Ava as a human to post those. &quot;Well this is perfect. The Chronivac allowed me to set myself up to do a morning show Wednesday and a huge stadium for my next Saturday night stream. I get to announce the tickets for the next stream on the show, and I am also announcing that Josie has agreed to stay as a girl in proportion to the amount of donations we get for cancer research.&quot;<br />
<br />
She frowned at the device. &quot;I don&#39;t know why it doesn&#39;t let me just erase that but I can at least help out this way. I&#39;m surprised I didn&#39;t have to talk her into it either. She was game to staying a girl for however much they donate. You think Rachel had something to do with that?<br />
<br />
Ava mewed.<br />
<br />
Allison gave a contented sigh. &quot;Could life be any better?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ava gave two quick mews.</p>
