<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“What do you mean?  What's about to change?” Brianna asked.  Kelly, who had coughed once or twice while she was sitting in front of her wife, coughed again.<br />
<br />
“Take a look at your hair,” Tabitha smiled.<br />
<br />
Brianna shook her hair over her right shoulder.  She grabbed a few locks and craned her neck to look at it.  It was hard for her to do this since her hair only extended to her shoulders.  <br />
<br />
“Here,” Tabitha said, reaching into her purse.  She pulled out a hand mirror and tossed it to Kelly.  Kelly caught it and held it in front of Brianna’s face so that she could see the changes.  Her hair was changing in the same way that Tabitha’s hair had changed.  The dullness of her hair was being drowned out by brightness.  Her hair was regaining its youthfulness as the strands of her hair became full and rich.<br />
<br />
“It’s so…good looking,” Brianna marveled.  <br />
<br />
“That’s nothing,” Tabitha laughed.  <br />
<br />
“Yea,” agreed Ricki.  “Just wait a minute.”<br />
<br />
Brianna looked down at her body and was shocked by a difference she saw all over her body.  Her very pale, pallid skin was darkening.  The healthy tan color that her skin possessed in her 20s was returning in full force.  Her entire frame was being washed over by a magical, invisible sun.  She looked back into the mirror to see her face looking tanner and healthier, too.  The slight wrinkles in her face quickly disappeared, again, much like Tabitha’s.   <br />
<br />
“Oh, my God, I look like I’m 25,” she said.  “And I feel that way too.”<br />
<br />
“Stand up,” Tabitha said excitedly.  “You’re not done yet.”<br />
<br />
Brianna stood, and Kelly stood with her so that she could still see her face in the mirror.  Brianna would not need to look in it any longer, though, as the changes spread to her figure.  She gasped in sharp pain as her waistline lost a few inches.  “Ow,” she said.  Her hips spread outward, giving her the desired hourglass figure that the four other women displayed.  <br />
<br />
Her arms and legs expanded next.  They did not expand in size, really, but the muscles of her limbs started to show on them.  She was developing a finely toned body.  In a few brief seconds, her body resembled that of a fitness model.  “Wow,” she said.  “I look great!”  She could not help but sound overly excited about her changes.<br />
<br />
Brianna’s small, B cup breasts swelled.  “Oh, my God,” she said.  She started to breathe heavily as her expanding breasts produced pleasurable feelings throughout her body.  She placed her hands over them in order to feel them grow.  “This is unreal,” she said as she closed her eyes.  She moaned softly as her mammaries swelled to D cup size.  <br />
<br />
Kelly could not help but get turned on by the changes either.  Before Brianna’s breasts finished growing, Kelly buried her face into Brianna’s pussy.  Brianna screamed in wild excitement, totally surprised by Kelly’s penetration of her womanhood.  Her eyes remained closed as Kelly gave her another sexual tongue bathing.  <br />
<br />
The other three looked over the changes in Brianna’s body as she continued to be fucked by Kelly.  She looked so much better.  The years of worrying and sadness had totally vanished from her body.  Much like Tabitha, all of the problems she had been experiencing were washed away by the changes that occurred.  They did not know if her frame of mind had changed, but they fully expected that it had.  After all, it had for the three of them and Kelly.  Why would anything be different now?<br />
<br />
Brianna climaxed and Kelly withdrew from her.  She sat down on the chair where Brianna had been sitting a few minutes ago.  Brianna, smiling as wide as anyone had ever seen her smiling, sat on Kelly’s lap and sprawled herself over the chair.  She was in such a state of ecstasy that she felt she could do anything she wanted.  Kelly did not mind, though, as she loved the feeling of Brianna’s naked flesh against her own.<br />
<br />
“So,” Ricki said, breaking the silence.  “Do we even have to ask if you’re in on our plan?”<br />
<br />
Brianna laughed.  “No way.”  She was looking up at Kelly, love in both of their eyes.  “Kelly, if this is what you want to do, then we should probably wait before trying for a baby.”  Her face turned serious.<br />
<br />
“Are you sure?” Kelly asked.  She was surprised that Brianna’s attitude had changed so suddenly.<br />
<br />
“I am,” Brianna responded.  “I mean, we don’t know what might happen with this plan of yours.  We need to wait until we know everything’s OK.”<br />
<br />
Kelly understood what she said.  “It’s your decision,” she said.  “I do want to have a baby, but you’re the one who has to go through it.”<br />
<br />
Brianna laughed.  “We could both go through it now, silly.  But it is your, or Greg’s sperm, so it would make more sense for me to be the pregnant one.  We don’t want a clone of you running around, do we?”<br />
<br />
Kelly returned the laugh.  “I guess not,” she said.<br />
<br />
“We’re going to wait then,” Brianna said.  “But we are going to do it.”<br />
<br />
“Of course we are,” Kelly said.  Brianna leaned up and kissed her on the lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hate to break this up,&quot; Ricki said, &quot;But i just remembered that we left your car at the lab.  We better go pick it up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shoot, that's right,&quot; Kelly said.  &quot;Luckily it's parked far away enough from the building.  No one will see us.&quot;<br />
<br />
The five women left the house and climbed into Ricki's car.  Brianna was able to put her sweatshirt on, but her pajama bottoms didn't fit.  So she just went bottomless.  No one seemed to care.<br />
<br />
They got to the lab and Kelly and Brianna got into their car.  &quot;So we'll see you tomorrow at our house, OK?&quot; Ricki asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;At noon?&quot; Kelly asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good,&quot; Ricki said.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, we'll be there,&quot;  Kelly said.  They drove away.<br />
<br />
&quot;What a day,&quot; Ricki yawned.  &quot;Let's go home, there's something I need to do before I get some much needed sleep.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brenda was thinking the same thing.</p>
