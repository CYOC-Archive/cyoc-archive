<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Jacob finished reading through the letter, his heart raced with anticipation and a hint of anxiety. He couldn&#39;t believe what he was reading. The fact that he would become an anthro, and that his transformation had already begun, left him thinking this was some sort of sick joke the school was playing on him.<br />
<br />
He thought about his roommate, Pete, a coyote, making a quick glance with his stunned expression. “These guys are playing with me are they?” <br />
<br />
“Yeah, It’s real,” Pete confirmed. “Happens to every human who crosses into here.”<br />
<br />
It made sense that Jacob would become a species that was similar to his roommate in a way, but as he reached the bottom of the letter and saw the words <b>&quot;YOUR ASSIGNED SPECIES: GOLDEN JACKAL&quot;</b> his mind went blank.<br />
<br />
Jacob&#39;s heart was pounding as he read the words again and again, trying to make sense of them. He had just found out that he was going to turn into an anthropomorphic animal, a jackal, more specifically a golden jackal, and that he had already started changing. He felt a sudden surge of panic and uncertainty about what lay ahead. He was worried about how he would look, how he would act, and how his life would change.<br />
<br />
He sat there in shock and silence for a few moments. His mind was racing with questions. <br />
<br />
<I> Do his friends and family know what is happening to him? How would he cope with being of a different species? Why a Jackal out of anything?</I> <br />
<br />
 He couldn&#39;t complain about what he was assigned, as he had felt indifferent towards the species he was going to be for the next three months, possibly forever. After all, he never put that much thought into what animal he wanted to be.<br />
<br />
Pete noticed the look of shock on Jacob&#39;s face and spoke up, &quot;Hey, you alright there, buddy?&quot; Waving a paw over his roommate&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
Jacob looked up at his roommate, still feeling dazed. &quot;I... I don&#39;t know, man, dog, coyote, whatever you want to be called... This is all so... surreal. just… how?&quot;<br />
<br />
Pete nodded sympathetically. &quot;Jacob, I understand. I get this is a lot for you, but you might end up liking it and deciding to stay here, a lot of new students do. Anyways, what did you get for a species?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob answered “A Jackal, more specifically a Golden Jackal.” he said, as he put the piece of paper on his bed and crossed his arms, still in disbelief at what the letter had told him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, It&#39;s Nice to have another canine as a roommate, especially one that&#39;s similar to what I am.&quot; Pete’s tan and grey tail swished behind him.<br />
<br />
“Wait, How are Jackals like Coyotes?” Jacob looked up at his canine roommate.<br />
<br />
“Jackals, well Golden Jackals like what you’re becoming, kinda fit the same niche as we do in different parts of the world, though you guys are a little smaller than us, so don’t be surprised if your clothes start getting a little big on you. That being said, I think we will get along quite well, and probably even better once you finish changing.” He says with a smile glaring with his golden eyes.<br />
<br />
“Welp, at least you’re happy with what I’m becoming,” Jacob spoke softly, giving a weak smile.&quot;I&#39;m still trying to cope with all of this.&quot; He knew it was going to be a rough week or two of changes, with a long road ahead of him, but he felt a sense of excitement in spite of all of the shock that hit him after reading the note. Now, he just needed time to relax and get that bombshell out of his mind.<br />
<br />
Pete would scroll through his phone, while Jacob was baffled by his phone’s inability to work. His messages to his parents weren’t getting sent, and he found that his phone was acting up when he tried calling them. He would open up the internet to see that a lot has changed online. His recent sites and apps had changed to ones that he had never even heard of, the news headlines all seemed unfamiliar, and promotions for TV shows, music, and movies that he had never seen. Jacob could tell they weren&#39;t kidding when they said it was like moving to a new country. He looks up at Pete, slouched on his bed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, how&#39;s your phone working? My cell service doesn&#39;t work for shit here.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s because it&#39;s almost impossible to communicate between sides unless the callers are a few miles away from the boundary. I learned more about it in my radio class I took last semester.&quot; Pete explained. <br />
<br />
&quot;What are these? VidClick? Pawpage? Yapper? Is this some sort of Great Firewall?&quot; Jacob asked as he tapped on the icons of the unfamiliar sites.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, we have a different internet here. The sites you have over there don’t have servers on this side so we came up with our own sites for everything.”<br />
<br />
“Well, I guess I’ll be working with a blank slate, well I didn’t really have much of a slate, to begin with.” Jacob moped. &quot;I was a laughing stock in high school. Tried everything to get people’s attention and for them to like me and it fell flat on my face. Community College was a bit better because there was less pressure to fit in over there. Hell, there were people in their 30s in some of my classes over there. Back home isn&#39;t any better though. I&#39;m the resident punching bag for my younger sisters, and while my parents aren’t bad people, they don&#39;t do anything about them and let them have their way most of the time.”<br />
<br />
“Wow, looks like you had it rough back on the human side, good to be away from them then.” Pete consoled his new roommate. ”I think I just know just where we can start with this blank slate.” Pete walks over to their door and Jacob follows him out into the hallway, walking past a crowd of human students demanding answers after learning their furry fates as Stripes, Max, and Grayson scrambled to assure them.<br />
<br />
“Jeez, looks like they’re going to have a lot on their hands today,” Jacob remarked.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, the CAs deal with all that kinda stuff every year, but I gotta give it to them.” The coyote added, “So many people are being told that they’re going to have their lives change, and they&#39;re the ones who have to deal with a bunch of screaming and crying kids upfront.”<br />
<br />
“Say, You did pretty well trying to talk me down, I’ve gotta give you credit” the future jackal added, “Have you applied to be a CA yourself?” <br />
<br />
“Nah, always thought it would be a lot of stress to put up with. Reminds me too much of high school..” Pete answers. “Things got more relaxed when I got here, but that might just be me.” The coyotes’ eyes gazed off as they walked down the stairwell to the first floor.<br />
<br />
“I got some friends I wanted you to meet. You’ll like these guys, trust me.” The two walked out of the dorm and approached another building, walking through a similar scene from their dorm before reaching the door labeled with the Names “Miles” and “Patrick”. Pete would send a message to Miles on his phone, and the big mountain lion opened the door. <br />
<br />
“Petey!” he exclaimed as the buff feline hugged his boyfriend. He was probably about a few inches taller than the two roommates who each stood at roughly 6ft. “So, you must be the new cub he has for a roommate? You go by Jacob or Jake?” <br />
<br />
“Pup,” Jacob corrected, scratching his head, “And either Jacob or Jake works as a name. I’m becoming a Jackal.”<br />
<br />
“So are you gonna become like Anubis and turn into some god?” Teased Miles’ raccoon roommate, Patrick. Who was shorter than Jacob, for now at least.<br />
<br />
“Pfft, I wish these changes made me a god” Jacob chuckled.<br />
<br />
“A lot of jackals lean a lot into Egyptian mythology from those that I’ve met. Honestly Couldn&#39;t blame them, it&#39;s a good source of species pride.” Miles mentioned, “It is very common for them to have an Ankh tattooed on their fur somewhere.”<br />
<br />
“Maybe I’ll do that when this is all set and done. I wanna take advantage of every opportunity this place has to offer.&quot; Jacob remarked.<br />
<br />
“I might know a thing or two about mythology,” Pete adds, “Us ‘yotes are basically the same way but replace Egyptian with Native American.”<br />
<br />
“What kind of Jackal is he becoming?” asks Miles.<br />
<br />
“Golden Jackal” Jacob answers, “It’s larger than most of the other jackal species.” <br />
<br />
“Interesting,” Miles nods. “I’ve met a few black-backed and side-striped jackals myself, but you’re probably one of the first goldens I’ve met. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find a lot of interesting things to learn about your new species.”<br />
<br />
As they stepped inside, Jacob took a look around the room. It was cluttered, but not in a bad way. Posters of bands and movies Jacob had never seen or heard of adorned the walls, and there were books and comics scattered about on various surfaces.<br />
<br />
“Nice place you got here,” Jacob commented. “I-I’ve never heard of any of these bands or movies before.”<br />
<br />
“Ah, man,” Patrick said, “You guys really miss out on a lot of stuff we have to offer over here. Give &#39;em a shot and you’ll love ‘em!”<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s not much, but it&#39;s a home away from home. And we like to keep it that way.” Miles added.<br />
<br />
Jacob nodded, taking a seat on a chair. “So what do you guys like to do for fun?”<br />
<br />
“Well, I&#39;m a big gamer,” Patrick piped up. “I&#39;ve got a whole setup over there,” he pointed to a corner of the room where a TV and gaming console sat. “Have even made a few games myself, sure they’re a bit amateur, but that&#39;s why I enrolled here in the first place: to get better.”<br />
<br />
“I like to draw, being an art major and all,” Miles said. “I’ve even offered Pat here some character designs for his game.”<br />
<br />
“That sounds like fun, Hope the game works out for you two. I’ll definitely be back to visit you guys.” Jacob smiled,  “Call me if you’re looking for a playtester,”<br />
<br />
“You know where we are if you want to hang out! Catch you later Jake!” Miles said goodbye to the two as they stepped out of the room.<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Jake and Pete would then head out into the hallway and out of the dorm. Suddenly, the human would notice his first changes on his journey to jackal-hood… his ears.<br />
<br />
As they walked, Jacob couldn&#39;t help but feel a little self-conscious about his ears. They felt they were further up his head and were definitely longer and pointier than before, and he could feel fur growing thicker around them. He wondered how noticeable it was to others. Pete seemed to sense his discomfort. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it, pup. It&#39;s all part of the process. Soon enough, you&#39;ll have a whole new set of senses to explore the world with.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Wait, My Ears! They’ve changed!” Jacob yelped in surprise. Everything sounded crisper for the jackal-to-be, and the improvement in his hearing could be compared to as if Audio was 4K when it was only Standard Definition before, “So it begins...” Jacob muttered to himself as he walked with his roommate. They passed by other students on the campus, some of whom were also undergoing their own transformations. Jacob saw a couple of people with squirrel tails chattering excitedly about their new appendages. He also spotted a pair of students swimming in the lake, now with webbed feet and growing thick brown fur on themselves.<br />
<br />
Pete would then take Jacob to a large open area in the middle of campus and introduced him to his friends, a trio of other anthro canines who he had been hanging out with since his freshman year. &quot;I’ve got some more buds I’d like you to meet,&quot; Pete said, &quot;they&#39;re a great bunch of friends and they know how to have a good time.&quot; <br />
<br />
“Guys, I’d like you all to meet the new pup.” Pete would introduce the still mostly human Jacob, with a grin along his muzzle, to a German Shepherd named Mikey, a Husky named Bailey, and a Fox named Kody, who welcomed him warmly. They were a diverse trio, with different personalities and interests, but all of them got along well with the coyote. Mikey called for a game of Ultimate Frisbee, which they had agreed to play.<br />
<br />
 Jacob was hesitant at first not having played the game since high school gym class, but they reassured him that he didn&#39;t need to be an expert to have fun. Jacob figured once his changes were complete, he’d get better anyways.  They split into teams, with Jake being on Kody and Pete’s side as a handicap, and started playing, running and jumping, and chasing the frisbee like no tomorrow across the massive field.<br />
<br />
The teams were evenly matched, with Mikey, Bailey, and Kody each bringing their own unique skills and strategies to the field. Jacob started out a bit rusty, fumbling the frisbee a few times and struggling to keep up with the other players. But as the game went on, he started to get the hang of it. He made a spectacular diving catch, tumbling head-over-heels to snag the frisbee just inches from the ground. The other players cheered and high-fived him, impressed by his agility and determination.  Jacob found himself getting caught up in the excitement and before long he was laughing and shouting with the rest of them, quickly honing his skills at the sport feeling himself get lost in the thrill of it. Afterward, they would walk over to the cafeteria together for lunch and Jake would get to know Pete’s friends better. <br />
<br />
As they walked, Pete’s friends began to ask him some questions about how he was settling into the valley. Bailey asked, “Jake, what species are you becoming?”<br />
<br />
“Jackal, a Golden Jackal.” his golden brown ears perked up above his hair.<br />
<br />
“Do you like it so far?” the Husky added.<br />
<br />
“It sure wasn’t the first animal that came to mind, but it&#39;s a welcome surprise, I think I lucked out when it comes to species.” Jacob would reply, stroking his hair and feeling his canine ears.<br />
<br />
“I think so too, welcome to the pack,” he said as the two fist-bumped. <br />
<br />
Kody mentioned how he had read about jackals and their social behavior on the other side, and how they often lived in pairs or small groups. Mike chimed in, saying that coyotes were also known to be extroverts, so it was only fitting that Jake had already found a good friend in his roommate Pete.<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
As they arrived at the cafeteria, they all grabbed their trays and settled at a table in the corner. They continued chatting about their interests and hobbies, and Jacob learned that Mike was a musician who played as a drummer, Bailey was an aspiring gaming VidClicker, and Kody was an avid writer who met Pete when they worked at a grocery store together. Pete mentioned that Jake was really interested about how other Jackals lived on the other side, and Kody recommended some articles, including one in the Fox had written in his local paper as part of an internship last summer for his journalism degree. <br />
<br />
A younger student would walk up to the table and take a seat close to Jacob. “Mind if I sit with you?”<br />
<br />
“Sure, more the merrier I suppose,” Jacob answers.<br />
<br />
The brown-haired student sits down, placing his new massive claws on the table.”<br />
<br />
“What’s your name?” Pete asks,<br />
<br />
“My name’s Ryan, I’m a freshman and as you can see here I found out a few hours ago I was gonna end up turning into a wolverine.” he introduces himself showing his hands.<br />
<br />
“Where are you from?” Jacob asked.<br />
“I’m from Ohio, Ironically enough. Dad would be so pissed if he found out, he’s a  huge Buckeye fan.” Ryan would then answer.<br />
<br />
“Dude, I’m from Ohio as well! Anywhere near Cleveland?” Jacob answers, interested to know another Ohioan who came all the way here.<br />
<br />
“I’m over from Youngstown, not too far away, pup. Say, you’re becoming a..” <br />
<br />
“Jackal” Jacob finished, pointing to his ears, “Over here is Pete, my roommate, he is a coyote.”<br />
<br />
Ryan&#39;s eyes widened in amazement. “Wait, did he change completely already?” pointing to Pete.<br />
<br />
“We’re Actually Juniors,” Pete said. “Jake’s a transfer student.” <br />
<br />
“Wait, what school did you go to before Jake?” the would-be wolverine asked,<br />
<br />
“MCC” Jake replied simply. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you went to MCC? I&#39;ve only really been there for some community functions. Dad wanted me to go there before transferring here but I just felt too compelled to come here to think about it. How were the teachers?&quot;  Ryan added.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re fine, most of them either took their jobs way too seriously or they didn&#39;t give a shit. No in-between. By the way, I heard Wolverines are pretty badass despite being so associated with Michigan, So I bet you’ll be one tough cookie once you’re done.” Jake replied<br />
<br />
Ryan blushed at the compliment but then smiled shyly, “Thanks, I sure hope so. What room are you guys in?”<br />
<br />
“Jake and I are in room 306,”  Pete added.<br />
<br />
“I’m down the hall in 314 with Spencer,” Ryan replies.<br />
<br />
As Jacob and Ryan continued to talk, they exchanged stories about their hometowns and experiences. Jacob told Ryan about how he grew up in a working-class suburb where everyone was in everyone else&#39;s business, and how he struggled to be part of the “It” crowd in high school. Ryan nodded empathetically and told Jacob about his own difficulties feeling out of place back home. He mentioned that his dad worked a lot and his mom died giving birth to him, his grandparents were pretty much his parents growing up. Not wanting to darken the mood, Ryan suggested a different topic.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what kind of music are you into?&quot; Jacob asked, curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, all kinds of stuff, but lately I&#39;ve been really into bands like The Glory Years and The Story As Told,&quot; Ryan replied. “Hopefully I could find a place that sells their CDs here, these guys don’t even have Spotify here, just some weird-ass ripoff.”<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve heard of The Glory Years, they&#39;re pretty good. I&#39;m more into classic rock myself,&quot; Jacob said. “I’d imagine people probably brought CDs over here anyways to listen to.” <br />
<br />
&quot;Nice, my dad would probably like you. He&#39;s a big classic rock fan too,&quot; Ryan said.<br />
<br />
“Anything you plan to do for extracurriculars?” Jacob floated a question.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m thinking of joining one of the sports teams once my changes finish up. Maybe hockey or something,&quot; Ryan said, “but that&#39;s what I’m leaning towards.”<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh cool, I&#39;ve never been too much into sports myself,&quot; Jacob admitted. &quot;But I&#39;ve been told the sports teams are pretty good here. I hope you make the team.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I bought a Jersey at the school store yesterday. The Green and Gold go.. well on me.&quot; Ryan said, his eyes trailing off. “I– think It’ll look pretty cool on my brown fur.”<br />
<br />
Jacob smiled, happy to have made a new friend. &quot;Maybe I&#39;ll come watch some games once the season starts,&quot; he suggested. &quot;I&#39;m always up for trying new things.&quot;<br />
<br />
As they finished up their lunch and headed back to their dorm rooms, Jacob couldn&#39;t help feeling like he had found a new home. Was this the fresh start he had been looking for? The change of scenery that had been his goal for so long? He felt like he had a chance to be a part of a community where he could truly fit in, and it was even better now that he had friends on the other side…</p>
