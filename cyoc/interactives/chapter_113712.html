<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stephan takes Jesse to the shower. &quot;You must wash, sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jesse was nervous about everything happening but somehow Stephan was making him feel better. Jesse stripped down and didn&#39;t even try to hide his tiny penis. He just felt that Stephan wouldn&#39;t care or make him feel bad about it. He stepped into the shower.<br />
<br />
Jesse was surprised as Stephan started undressing. Jesse had been fooled into thinking Stephan was merely thin. The boy slowly took off his loose shirt to show lean muscle underneath. Jesse admired Stephan&#39;s defined abs and on down Jesse noticed that Stephan had defined muscle lines coming up from his pelvis. Stephan slowly lowered his pants and again Jesse marveled at Stephan&#39;s muscular legs on up to this thigh and then...<br />
<br />
Jesse noticed Stephans cock. It wasn&#39;t massive but it was perfect. It was longer than average and thick enough around that it would be good to give or receive with it.<br />
<br />
If I was a girl, I mean, thought Jesse. But Jesse was a guy and didn&#39;t think like that. He wasn&#39;t gay. He just admired men sometimes. And when he watched porn he liked for the guys to be hung, but that was normal. Right?<br />
<br />
Stephan stepped into the shower with him. Jesse felt his face flush. As he reached for up for the soap. Stephan grabbed Jesse&#39;s arm and pulled it back down.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. I will wash you. You must be cleaned properly. Just relax and I will do the work.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jesse tilted his head back and he loved the feeling of the warm water rushing over him. Than Stephan started soaping up Jesse&#39;s chest. Stephan&#39;s hands were gently to the touch. He swirled around and messaged Jesse&#39;s muscles as he went. Stephan worked his way down, kneeling as he went. Soon he was on his knees in front of Jesse. Jesse flushed and could feel blood rushing to his shrunken manhood.<br />
<br />
Stephan started at Jesse&#39;s feet and was working his way up. Messaging Jesse&#39;s calves with soap and warm water. Then up to Jesse&#39;s thigh; taking slow care as Stephan caressed the inner thigh and rubbed upward. Stephan got slower and more gentle as he took great care with Jesse&#39;s scrotum. Then he worked around Jesse&#39;s cock. Stephan slowly clean it from base to shaft to head. He took care to get around the base of the head. Jesse was fully erect which embarrassed him. A straight guy wasn&#39;t supposed to get hard like this.<br />
<br />
Stephan stood up. He noticed Jesse&#39;s embarrassment. &quot;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m erect too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jesse looked down to see Stephan&#39;s glorious shaft standing at attention. It was still the perfect thickness and the length was above average but not flashy. Jesse was tempted to play with it. To see what that would feel like. But he wasn&#39;t gay so he didn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
&quot;Turn around please. I need to wash your back.&quot; Stephan was lathering up soap in his hands again.<br />
<br />
Stephan&#39;s hands worked their way up the small of Jesse&#39;s back. Stephan messaged Jesse&#39;s shoulders. Than worked the knotts from Jesse&#39;s neck.<br />
<br />
Stephan cleared his throat. It was obvious that he was as nervous as Jesse. &quot;Do you trust me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; What was about to happen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please. Do you trust me, Jesse?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Jesse&#39;s voice broke as the word came out. &quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax. This is for the best.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jesse felt something rub his thigh as it moved toward his anus. Oh, god. It was Stephan&#39;s cock. His perfect cock. Jesse felt it touch his anus. But Stephan slowly work it in circular motions before sliding it slowly in. The foreign feel of the pressure caused Jesse to jump and tense up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax. Relax,&quot; Stephan whispered in Jesse&#39;s ear.<br />
<br />
Jesse relax and Stephan started pulling back out slowly and then back in. Going deeper with each thrust. Stephan built up a rhythm. He started to speed up his thrusts. Still pulling all the way to the tip of his cock and sliding all the way to the base. Whenever Stephan got to the base and stopped to start pulling out, his balls slapped against Jesse.<br />
<br />
Jesse wasn&#39;t thinking about much. Only how good it felt. How good the warm water was. How good the pressure in his ass feels as Stephan&#39;s perfect cock stroked in and out. The rhythm. The strong hands holding his hips. Stephan&#39;s pelvis bumping his ass. Their balls slapping together. Jesse felt pressure build behind his cock. Was he about to cum?<br />
<br />
Yes. &quot;YES. YES. I&#39;m cumming.&quot; Jesse grabbed a rail to keep his balance as cum dripped from the eye of his dick.<br />
<br />
Stephan never made a noise. No sound whatsoever. Stephan just tensed up and tightened his grip on Jesse&#39;s hips as though slipping from inside Jesse&#39;s body would be the worst thing that could ever happen to him. He thrusts forward awkwardly a few times and then stopped. Soon his flaccid penis slid out of Jesse.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Oh holy shit.&quot; Jesse was stunned. He had never dreamed anything could feel like that. It went beyond any sex he had had before.<br />
<br />
Stephan never said a word and was now getting dressed. Somehow this hurt Jesse&#39;s feelings. It had been a religious experience for him, why wasn&#39;t it the same for Stephan? Had it meant anything to him?<br />
<br />
&quot;We must go.&quot; A fully dressed Stephan motioned towards the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cheerleader tryouts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously. I am going to become a cheerleader?&quot;<br />
<br />
Stephan actually smiled. &quot;No. I did not prepare you to be a cheerleader. Just to be the sex of one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jesse almost fainted.</p>
