<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sabrina’s departure coincided with an influx of patrons.  It was easy for Matthew to forget she was now a female as she was run off her feet. She was kept busy preparing drinks, mostly just of the normal alcoholic variety but occasionally a swap scotch. It seemed many of the patrons were here just to gander. With the bar becoming quite crowded Jake returned and that helped. One of Sabrina’s duties was to collect empty glasses from around the room. She soon got used to walking in the platform boots. She observed that everyone seemed to gawk at her body. She wasn’t used to that. When she collected empty glasses from the lesbian couple. She was asked by the butch girl “Any luck?”<br />
<br />
“Not yet. I would suggest you come back tomorrow”<br />
<br />
“We can’t. We are from out of town and only here for one night. It’s tonight or never. Please keep asking”<br />
<br />
Later the woman came to the bar and ordered a couple of cocktails once more she asked “No body shown any interest?”<br />
<br />
Matthew had actually asked patrons when she had the opportunity but as Sabrina had told him/her earlier people were not disposed to swap with strangers. However Matthew was not a person who liked to disappoint. She replied something that she might come to regret. “The young man at the bar earlier might be interested. He had to run an errand. When he returns I’ll ask him again” That bought a grin to ‘Butch’s’ lips.<br />
<br />
After midnight things quietened down somewhat and Jake suggested. “Why don’t you take a break while you can. Say 15 minutes. But if things get busy again be prepared to return sooner”  <br />
<br />
Matthew was only too eager to take a break. Amongst other reasons her new bladder was bursting. Perhaps it had not been wise to take up the offer when one couple had shouted her a drink. She was also keen to check her body out a bit more.  Everything had been in such a rush when she and Sabrina had swapped.<br />
<br />
She was also curious about who she now was. She recalled Sabrina had mentioned a handbag in the cupboard. She would take the opportunity to check out its contents - surely Sabrina wasn’t her real name. Matthew opened the cupboard to see a black handbag. It could not belong to anyone else. She picked it out then before Jake changed his mind departed the bar and headed straight to the toilets. She almost entered the male but checked at the last minute and entered the female toilets. <br />
<br />
There didn’t appear to be anyone inside. She entered a cubicle then had to think about what to do next. No longer could she just whip out her penis and squirt. <br />
<br />
Matthew hitched up the dress she was wearing, Pulled down her stockings and panties and sat down. With her now ample bottom there was no fear of falling into the hole. She also didn’t need to worry about her penis brushing against the toilet bowl as she no longer had anything dangling out of her groin.<br />
<br />
She could feel her bladder was bursting but had difficulty selecting the correct muscles to squeeze. She was about to give up when suddenly she voided in a rush. She then grabbed some toilet paper and dabbed her rose dry. That was the red rose of which her vaginal lips looked like some of the petals. The tattoo artist must have enjoyed this creation. She also noticed her groin was completely hairless, not just shaven. Tentatively she touched within the lips. She located her clitoris. It seemed smaller than that of Angie, Matthew’s ex-girlfriend. Hers was the only vagina Matthew had ever closely examined before.<br />
<br />
Now feeling a bit guilty she pulled up her panties and the fishnets, straightened her dress and left the cubical. There she washed her hands and as she still had the bathroom to herself examined her reflection. Her eye make-up really was quite heavy. And the nose ring was real. She must have a hole between her nostrils. For a few seconds she tried to figure out how the nose ring might be removed but then gave up.<br />
She examined her tattoos. Her left arm was virtually covered from her shoulders to the back of her hands. Her right arm had a shoulder tattoo and a rose on the inside of her forearm. She guessed Sabrina was still working on that arm. She had another patterned tattoo across the top of her chest, it was like a wreath of rose branches, thorns included, connecting the two skull tattoos on each shoulder. <br />
<br />
She had noticed while swapping that her actual breasts were free of ink. Now she cupped them, each just slightly too large to be encased by her smaller hands. She decided they were a perfect size for her current body.<br />
<br />
Just then someone entered the toilet. Matthew had lowered her hands when she heard the door open and pretended to be fussing with Sabrina’s handbag. In the reflection she noticed it was one of the flat chested apparent women who had been with Sam. <br />
<br />
The girl smiled at Matthew and said “I wasn’t sure which toilets to use. Am I allowed to try stand up peeing in the ladies?”<br />
<br />
Matthew tried to think of something witty “The troughs are in the gents and that is what they are designed for, but I guess if you want to fix your make-up you are in the right place”<br />
<br />
“Yeah you are probably right. I guess you don’t want people making a mess in here. I remember what happened when my baby brother used to miss” The girl/boy giggled. She seemed drunk. “Do you want to see what I’m packing?” As she asked the girl had lifted her skirt and whipped out the penis she had. It was erect. “Look how big it is! It won’t go down!”<br />
<br />
“No thanks” Matthew replied. She tried to un-see the penis. It did seem big. “Better take that to the gents”<br />
<br />
That seemed to do the trick. The girl put her penis away and left the room.<br />
<br />
As Matthew had her hands in Sabrina’s handbag she decided to investigate its contents. She found Sabrina’s purse and inside that her identity. Sure enough her name actually was Sabrina, Sabrina Soloman to be precise. That seemed an apt name for a goth. Sabrina was 22 and lived in the neighbouring suburb. Interestingly her photo ID showed a blonde girl but the face was the same as what Matthew now had other than lacking a nose ring. <br />
<br />
There was barley any cash in the purse. Only a few coins. But there was a visa card and some shop discount cards. In the bag Matthew found a hair brush, a small mirror, make-up, a bunch of keys including one for a Toyota, a small torch, a fold up umbrella and embarrassingly a packet of sanitary pads and a pack of condoms. Matthew zipped up the bag, blew a kiss to her reflection then left the bathroom. <br />
<br />
As she passed the gents she heard hysterical female laughter from inside. Matthew decided she didn’t want to know what might be going on.<br />
<br />
Matthew walked back to the bar. She didn’t know what else she was meant to do on her break. If she had more than 15 minutes she might have tried going somewhere different as Sabrina Soloman, however she had probably already taken at least 10 minutes. Jake was just looking at the computer and there didn’t seem anybody waiting to be served. He didn’t seem too surprised when he noticed whom he thought to be Sabrina join him inside the bar.<br />
<br />
“I might just take a break myself” he told her. So Matthew found herself alone manning the bar once more.</p>
