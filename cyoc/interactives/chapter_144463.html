<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Magnus fiddled with the cootie catcher in disbelief. It didn&#39;t seem particularly special, let alone magical. <br />
<br />
The paper felt very smooth and sturdy, like the material of tear-proof envelopes, except it was deceptively heavy for something made entirely of paper.<br />
<br />
“What are you?” Magnus peered into the cootie catcher, alternating opening and closing with each syllable before opening the paper tan for his answer.<br />
<br />
>>> AN ORIGAMI COOTIE CATCHER<br />
<br />
Magnus furrowed his thick, platinum haired brow. Was this thing being sassy with him?<br />
<br />
“Were you always like this?”<br />
<br />
>>> YES AND NO. MY INTERFACE IS OPTIMIZED FOR INTUITIVE AND FUNCTIONAL USE BASED ON THE CURRENT USER BY ALTERING REALITY. MY INTERFACE CALIBRATED FOR YOUR UNIQUE NEEDS WHEN YOU PICKED ME UP. <br />
<br />
The memory was fleeting and dream like, but Magnus did recall a bizarre moment when he retrieved the device from professor Pascal&#39;s desk. <br />
<br />
His phone vibrated loudly, a message from his brother pup Marcus flashed on screen.<br />
<br />
----<br />
Marcus: hey! Master’s class is almost over. We&#39;ve got reservations tonight, try not to be late Mr Alpha Bear! &#128536;&#127825;&#128075;&#128165;<br />
----<br />
<br />
The combination of emoji made Magnus fearful he was in for another punishment dolled out by his brother pups. Redheads were natural born alphas, the two teased him regularly for his unlikely win. He only wanted to belong to Master Dan…the title of “campus alpha bear” was a burden his submissive heart could not handle.<br />
<br />
“I wish that Patrick and Marcus will always be bigger, stronger, and more hung than me, making them the campus alphas!” Magnus declared, quickly flipping through the cootie catcher until he finished his command.<br />
<br />
>>> DONE<br />
<br />
Satisfied with the change, Magnus left the hanger and headed towards the English department.<br />
<br />
….<br />
<br />
Despite his 22-foot-tall body and a package that reached the ground, Magnus was back to being the invisible wall flower from before the alpha bear competition. Students walked right through his tree trunk legs as if he wasn&#39;t even there.<br />
<br />
“It worked!” He gasped to himself. He kept his head down and avoided eye contact as best he could till he saw his Master Dan and two massive Redheads.<br />
<br />
It was Patrick and Marcus… Only super sized. As he got closer, Magnus estimated they were at least 25-feet-tall, and just as broad. So bloated with muscle they had trouble looking over their pecs.<br />
<br />
“MASTER!” Magnus bounded towards Dan, falling to his hands and knees to greet him as he had been trained. But before he could profess his love and share how painful the time apart was, Patrick blocked him.<br />
<br />
“Magnus! Back off!” the fiery redhead let out an aggressive alpha roar that both terrified and aroused Magnus. “You don&#39;t belong to Master Dan.”<br />
<br />
Reaching for his neck, Magnus was shocked to discover the collar Master Dan had given him was gone! His heart felt like it was tearing apart, tears burned his eyes… this was an unintended consequence of changing reality.<br />
<br />
Marcus crouched down, wrapping his massive arms around his Master like a protective shield of muscle. “Get outta here, Magnus. What you&#39;re doing is incredibly presumptuous. Only Master Dan can decide who is worthy of serving him.”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m so sorry! I will fix this--” Magnus cried out through tears hurriedly collecting himself before stumbling away.<br />
<br />
…<br />
<br />
As he turned the corner, Magnus sat back against the English building. Even sitting, his head reached the roof.<br />
<br />
“I have to fix this...I have to fix this…” Magnus was swaying back and forth, hyperventilating as he repeated his intent over and over.<br />
<br />
Magnus had had a taste of serving Dan. Living as his own man without Master Dan to serve seemed like a fate worse than death. Who would tell him how to dress? Who would give his life meaning? Free Will was a personal hell!<br />
<br />
Holding the chronivac cootie catcher in his hands he knew he had to be more careful.  He couldn&#39;t just undo his last command, else he would stuck as an “alpha.” Magnus wanted to be able to be just a slave, no pretense of being a natural born alpha like redheaded slaves.<br />
<br />
He needed to make it socially acceptable to be JUST a slave, and when he saw the light catching in his platinum blonde fur, he knew exactly how to do it: make it the Nordic birthright.<br />
<br />
It was so simple! Redheads had a genetic disposition to be total slaves when they fell in love, but were otherwise confident, swaggering alphas. That disposition was as inescapable as their genetically determined redhair or massive hulking bodies.<br />
<br />
“What percentage of the world is redheaded?” Magnus asked the chronivac.<br />
<br />
>>> ROUGHLY 2% OF THE WORLD POPULATION HAS RED HAIR<br />
<br />
“And what about Nordic platinum blonds like myself?”<br />
<br />
>>> LESS THAN 0.1% OF THE WORLD IS PLATINUM BLOND LIKE YOU<br />
<br />
That stat surprised Magnus. Although he didn&#39;t think of himself as exotic, he rarely encountered other men with platinum blond eyelashes and brows let alone platinum blond body fur. For this to work he would need more people to be like him.<br />
<br />
“Increase the population of Nordic platinum blonds from 0.1% to…” Magnus paused trying to think of a number that would be big enough to affect social norms. “...10%? No, make it 50%!”<br />
<br />
The air around Magnus shimmered and distorted briefly. Students that were walking by suddenly went platinum blond. Light fur that shone gold in the sun in stark contrast to their tan skin.<br />
<br />
“Okay. Step 1 complete.” Magnus returned to the chronivac.<br />
<br />
“Those with platinum blonde hair are natural born titans. Massively muscled, tall, overly endowed, hyper sexual… Bigger and more virile on average than their redheaded counter parts.” Magnus was perspiring with anticipation, the next part was critical.<br />
“However, unlike Redheads who are naturally very alpha and dominant, platinum blonds are born with the mentality of a total slave.” He paused… Fearful this might not be enough, Magnus decided he needed to elaborate and leave less to chance..<br />
“Submission is such an important need for platinum blonds that they are bonded for life to the one they serve. They are so loving and loyal, they will change and grow over time to be perfect slaves for their Master.” And for the coup de grace…<br />
“If they are unable to serve the one they&#39;ve bonded to, they will die. Because platinum blonds evolved into such emotionally dependent beings, it isn&#39;t just socially acceptable to be a total slave, it is required for those of Nordic descent.”<br />
<br />
>>> WOW. YOU&#39;RE QUITE THE ROMANTIC. I CAN TOTALLY DO THAT, BUT I THINK YOU ALSO WANT TO BELONG TO DAN, RIGHT? <br />
<br />
Magnus blinked, taken aback at the unexpected tone from the chronivac. “Yes. Yes of course...I need that… Please…” he whimpered.<br />
<br />
The air shimmered and Magnus watched from his vantage point as the changes rippled across campus.<br />
<br />
Now for every 1 alpha redhead Magnus could see 25 beta platinums. They were easy to spot, bigger than redheads, most were naked save for their oversized collars and branded flesh. Just below the massive Nordic bulls were their Dom&#39;s, some appeared to have multiple slaves… Master Dan owned a couple Redheads, but now that more than half the world population needed to serve, it would be quite common.<br />
<br />
As the air continued to shimmer, Magnus felt the changes reaching him, starting with the familiar weight of a collar around his neck.<br />
<br />
His height didn&#39;t increase too much, but his cock and balls inflated dramatically, unfurling several yards past his feet. Immediately following that he could feel his sex drive spike, balls churning with an intense need for release… He reached down to squeeze them and moaned… The pleasure was overwhelming! It seemed like they were filling with more and more cum by the second.<br />
<br />
Before Magnus could enjoy the swelling pleasure, a new sensation started growing inside him: his Nordic need to serve.<br />
<br />
This was the birthright of the Vikings; redheads and platinum blonds alike were born into this world to serve. While redheads were natural alphas, those with platinum hair were only capable of submissive thought and emotion.<br />
<br />
A sharp pang struck Magnus in the chest… Then another… And another. Each one making him cry out in pain.  It was his heartbeat, aching to be with Master Dan.  The longer they were apart, the more painful it would become. <br />
<br />
Magnus bolted upright, the new weight of his oversized Nordic cock making him sway forward. “Fuucckkk…” he let out a groan… The pent up sexual need combined with this painful need to serve was so overwhelming that he could only think of one thing: Master Dan.<br />
<br />
Intuition took over as generations of finely honed submission guided him like a homing pigeon to the man he was bonded in service.<br />
<br />
“M-MASTER!!!” Magnus cried out, staggering as the pain became so intense he lost his balance, falling before the smaller, dark haired Dan. “I missed you so much, Master! I&#39;m so sorry I left your side, thank you for allowing me to serve you!” Magnus kissed at Dan&#39;s feet with aggressive need, forgetting to breath and falling back, gasping for air.<br />
<br />
“Hey pup!” Dan smiled knowingly, familiar with the intensity of love that his slaves had for him. “Please stand.” He patted his thigh and gestured UP with his thumb, Magnus’ body reacting before he could even process the command.<br />
<br />
“Master, reservation in 10 minutes.” Patrick and Marcus wore collars that matched Magnus’ but it was clear from their demeanor they were the alphas. <br />
<br />
“Pup, we can afford to be a little late. You&#39;re with a Dom. Besides, tonight is special.” Dan grinned, basking in the power he had in this world. “Magnus, did you get my--” he paused, searching his memory “--huh. My cootie catcher?” Dan tilted his head pondering the correctness of that statement.<br />
<br />
“Yes, Master! Here you go, Master!” Magnus handed over the chronivac, and in a split moment it seemed to exist simultaneously as a cootie catcher, beige computer terminal, an iPad for the football team, and Dan&#39;s phone.<br />
<br />
“Phew, glad to have my phone back.” Dan paused, checked his memory, then shrugged it off.</p>
