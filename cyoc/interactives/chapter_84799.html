<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">One of the potions fell from the self, it broke open on Lina&#39;s head, cutting her scalp, the potion absorbed through her skin and blood stream, and spreading quickly through the rest of her body, and dosing her clothes while it was at it.<br />
<br />
Am&#39;raykaith giggled at her friend. There were so many possibilities! Maybe she&#39;d become a doll she could play with forever and ever. Maybe she&#39;d become a simple minded cat girl she could have as a pet. Or she&#39;d turn into a chicken and she&#39;d require a little trip through the make over machines to become a nice new imp for Am&#39;raykaith to have as her best friend (well, as close as fiends GOT to friends) forever!  No matter what it was, Am&#39;raykaith knew it was gonna be so cool!<br />
<br />
Am&#39;raykaith didn&#39;t care what her parents were going to think, or what Lina&#39;s parents were going to think. Imagining the shocked looks on their faces only made her giggle more! She was an imp, mischief was her reason for being! And she loved it! <br />
<br />
She might have been mistaken for some in dim light like a child in VERY inappropriate clothes, wearing a costume, but these were seemings, her heart, mind, body, and what used to be her soul were those of a little imp through and through. Am&#39;raykaith couldn&#39;t be happier, she knew this was gonna be fun, she just never imagined how liberated she&#39;d feel. <br />
<br />
Lina meanwhile, cries out as the container broke and cut her, she felt herself bleeding, but also felt the luminescent almost golden like liquid spread over her. <br />
<br />
Amy, or what Amy had become at least, were stood there grinning at her, eager to see what the potion would do to her. Like a child with a new toy. <br />
<br />
The potion soaked her clothes, and dripped off her skin. Lina had too much of a headache to stand up right away. Things got weird as she felt her injuries just, seal up, and the pains imply went away. She saw the potion of whatever it was absorbed right into her skin and into her dress. <br />
<br />
Why was everything getting bigger? <br />
<br />
Am&#39;raykaith grinned wider as she watched Lina get smaller. Maybe she&#39;d be a pet mouse, or a new imp friend right away! That was would so great! <br />
<br />
Lina continued to feel dizzy as she dimly became aware that it wasn&#39;t everything that was getting bigger, she was getting smaller. She watched as she fingers became more stubby, and she saw hints of baby fat returning to her body she had long ago lost. Her arms and legs became short as well, and saw her breasts also flattening. They were actually becoming even smaller than the two bumps Amy had.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, we don&#39;t really need those anyway,&quot; Amy said assuringly. <br />
<br />
Lina was going to respond when another change happened, and she saw her skin was changing. It was pure white, like polish marble, and felt harder and more durable than the skin of any mortal creature.<br />
<br />
As Amy&#39;s skin was smooth like rubber, Lina&#39;s was as smooth as polished marble. She wondered for a brief moment if she was turning into a statue, but her skin still moved and folded as she moved her arms and hands. <br />
<br />
But when she flexed her fingers and twisted her arm it bend just as easily, not impeding her movements at all. <br />
<br />
She wobbled to her feet, stepping out of shoes way too large for her now, her dress was more like a tent now it was so much bigger than her. She looked to be the same age as Amy now, if age meant anything to a being like she had become.<br />
<br />
She scrambled for her compact mirror in her way too big purse, and looked at herself. Her hair turned a bright red, and threaded itself into a braid behind her back. It ironically hadn&#39;t shrank that much, making it appear rather long on her. Her face had an innocence to it, calm, inviting, something that said everything was going to turn out okay. <br />
<br />
Amy looked more and more eager. But suddenly, Am&#39;raykaith felt like something was very wrong (or as she&#39;d seen it as wrong). <br />
<br />
Lina saw her eyes turn almost crystal like blue, the centers of her eyes now reminded her of the shape of a  cross. She didn&#39;t feel scared anymore. She didn&#39;t feel confused. She didn&#39;t feel angry at Amy for more or less causing this. She felt this strong sense of joy and inner peace. <br />
<br />
She gasped out loud and hugged herself, feeling like her entire back was cramping up. She knew that logically this should have been agony, but it was no worse than the burn after a long run. Out of the corner of her eye she saw large golden wings stretched out behind her, no, they grew OUT OF her, she felt the air breeze against them like she would any part of her body. Her wings were feathery, but they were almost metallic in their sheen like her skin was marble like (and Amy&#39;s new skin was like latex or rubber). <br />
<br />
Now Amy was looking a little scared of her, but why be scared? They were friends weren&#39;t they? <br />
<br />
She got to her feet, and pulled up on her tent of a dress, and saw that her belly button, as along with the openings between her legs and rear were all gone, and what little remained of her breasts were devoid of nipples, like Amy had lost hers. Like Amy, Lina felt the knowledge come uncalled for that she had no need or want of such things, and she felt no sense of loss at their passing anymore than you would flakes of skin.<br />
<br />
Her body was so smooth it was almost unbelievable, she felt no shame in herself, after all, she was what she was, and there was no shame in that. <br />
<br />
Then she felt like she could sense every life around her, from simple bacteria to simple insects to the old man at the counter, for a moment it threatened to overwhelm her, but she accept it, but she felt of the life she sensed only the old man had a flame within that humans called a soul.<br />
<br />
She rolled her eyes up, and saw a transparent ring of light floating above her head, moving as she did, as much as part of her as her eyes and legs she was sensing all life around her through it.<br />
<br />
Her dress then shrank down, breaking off and threading around her legs as well, becoming a similar color to her wings, while the rest shrank down into a simple one piece dress of a faded bronze color. Glowing runes around it that she recognized as hebrew script.<br />
<br />
Her clothes finished changing and her body doing the same, followed by her mind, soul, and spirit just as Amy had become Am&#39;raykaith.  <br />
<br />
Her pursed changed into a small hip pouch that complimented her dress. Like Amy there separate pieces of ID within, one showing a human version of what she had become, but what use she or Amy had for a driver&#39;s license was beyond her. <br />
<br />
The second ID listed what she was, Amy gasped it out shaking.<br />
<br />
&quot;C-ch-cherub?!&quot; The imp said to the class of angel. Naming her spiritual opposite number. <br />
<br />
The ID also included her new name, no last name, just Lilausdeo. Like Am&#39;raykaith, she felt Lina still worked for a nick name. There was also the parchment that included her terms and conditions for being on this plane of reality. <br />
<br />
She slipped them back and inside and smiled at Amy. No, she identified her real name now, Am&#39;raykaith. Still, Amy was what her friend wished to be called. <br />
<br />
She floated off the ground, barely even needing to move her wings, and came close to the imp, the cherub just smiling peacefully. &quot;Hey Amy, why do you look so freaked? You were right, don&#39;t I look inspiring?&quot; Lilausdeo did a short twirl in the air. &quot;Just imagine all the help we can do for humans!&quot; She giggled at the thought, easing the burdens of humanity just a tiny bit and reminding them that life was happiness.<br />
<br />
Lilausdeo came face to face to with Am&#39;raykaith floating on her belly almost as she kicked her legs in the air, putting her hands together, and took hold of Am&#39;raykaith&#39;s hands. It was like fire and ice touching, but neither of felt any pain or took any injury. &quot;After all, we&#39;re friends right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Am&#39;raykaith gritted her teeth at the sincerely and accepting KINDNESS radiating from the little celestial before her. There wasn&#39;t a hint of superiority or aloofness in her. <br />
<br />
Am&#39;raykaith pulled back, &quot;Are you nuts?! I&#39;m an imp! You&#39;re a cherub! We&#39;re supposed to be enemies!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And instead we&#39;re friends.&quot; Lilausdeo said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I see the both of you have made a new life for yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
The newborn fiend and newborn celestial turned her heads to the balding man in the brown robe. &quot;That potion was four hundred dollar by the way, you break it, you buy it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Am&#39;raykaith blanched, while she found mortal boring, and not all that fun by themselves, this old man WAS the reason she had become what she was, so she owed him. But she wasn&#39;t sure she had that kind of money, and didn&#39;t know what this old man would do to enact payment. <br />
<br />
Lilausdeo meanwhile had already pulled that wad of cash out of her bag and handed it to the old man. The shopping spree she had wanted to go on no longer felt so important, material goods, didn&#39;t feel as big on her want list. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please doing business with you.&quot; The old man said politely. <br />
<br />
Am&#39;raykaith glared at her in confusion. She looked back in confusion. &quot;What? You scared me, but I was the one who broke it.&quot;</p>
