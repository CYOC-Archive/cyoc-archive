<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Chad entered the kitchen he was now up to her nose in height, he normally only reached her chin.  She unknowingly went from 5&#39;4&quot; inches tall to 5&#39;3&quot;.  Chad rose from 4&#39;7&quot; to 4&#39;11&quot;.  When he approached she went to give him a hug and noticed the height.  &quot;Chad! you are getting so tall now my sweet.&quot;  she said.  Chads dad was a drunk and yelled a lot at him and his mom.  He had a big dislike for him.  He worked midnights and walked in from work already drinking.  &quot;Honey, I feel weird, something seemed off today at work.&quot;  he said.  He had unknowingly went from 5&#39;9&quot; to 5&#39;7&quot; inches tall.  Chad who normally reached his fathers chest in height now reached his chin.  Chad noticed but his father didn&#39;t.  His mother let him open his gift.  It was rollerblades.  He put them on right away to see how they felt.  He stood now nearly his mothers height and up to his dads nose.  &quot;Wow son, you sure are getting tall&quot;  he said.  Chad smiled when he saw how tall he was.  Chads parents talked about how he seemed really tall, they concluded he must be hitting his growth spurt.  Over the next month Chad slowly grew taller and his parents slightly smaller.  Chad hit puberty really quickly and suddenly.  He had so much energy he exercised and lifted weights to just burn energy.  He was turning into a muscular young man.  Conversely his father was getting really feeble and weaker.  He shrunk down to 5&#39;6&quot; and his mother was now 5&#39;2&quot;  they both felt they were shorter for some reason but could not explain it.  Chad had kept to himself the past month and went to school as his parents worked all the time.  One evening Chad&#39;s mom came to Chad&#39;s room as he was sitting on a chair doing one arm curls with a dumbbell.  She saw him and said.  &quot;Oh my Chad your muscle looks huge, when did you start working out.  I feel like I haven&#39;t seen you in forever, we are having family breakfast when you dad gets home.&quot;  She went downstairs and his father came home and started screaming drunk.  &quot;Where is that kid, I am going to kill him, he left his bike in the driveway again.&quot;  He slipped off his belt and Chad&#39;s mom grabbed his arm to stop him.  He pushed her down and Chad saw this while he was now at the top of the stairs.  Chad knew he was much taller since he grew to the tallest kid in his school, but was not expecting what happened when his father reached him.  Chad was dead even in height, and built much more solid with his large muscles.  &quot;Wow, boy, you are tall, you still think you are a tough guy, I&#39;ll show you.&quot;  said Chad&#39;s father as Chad stood his ground staring angrily at his dad.  Chad&#39;s mom could see the exchange as she walked up the stairs.  Chads father reached back with the belt in hand and Chad&#39;s mom yelled &quot;No!&quot;.  Chad grabbed his arm and flung him into the wall with ease.  Chad&#39;s father was stunned and pissed.  &quot;That&#39;s it, you are dead&quot;  his dad yelled.  Chad&#39;s father stood up and punched him in the stomach.  This did not even hurt Chad.  Chad returned the favor and slugged his father in the chest knocking him over in pain.  Chad stood over his father.  &quot;No more being a drunk bully&quot;  he said.  His mom was standing in awe next to her son who now stood 4 inches taller than her.  Chad&#39;s father broke two ribs in the punch and was off work for a while.  He laid on the couch and drank for two months.  He shrank more to 5&#39;4 inches tall now and Chad&#39;s mother to 5&#39;1.  Chad had avoided his parents but his mother saw him looking monstrously big atop the stairs a few times.  One night Chads father got really drunk and mad.  &quot;I want to show my tough guy son who is really boss.&quot;  He ran upstairs and opened the door.  &quot;Get up boy&quot;  yelled Chad&#39;s father to Chad lying on his bed.  Chad&#39;s mother stood in the doorway in horror.  Chad stood up and rose to an unreal height.  His head was only two inches lower than the door.  Chad bent over and flexed his massive bicep next to his father showing it was bigger than his dad&#39;s torso.  &quot;yes, puny dad&quot;  Chad said.  That was the end of that.</p>
