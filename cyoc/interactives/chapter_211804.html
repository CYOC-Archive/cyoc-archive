<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This should be the final edit before the next chapter.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As he stood around the employee area Jeff pondered his next steps while checking on the chronivac, as always it seemed to make the best possible choice for any of the changes typed into it, making it so that he could take traits from all his daddies, and not just Bull’s, and while this unintended change bothered him a bit, he had to admit it was convenient. “Darn it, why didn’t I think of that, thought Jeff “t’s something fun to do to every one of my daddies, not just Bull… I will have to think of something just for him later”. Mumbled Jeff to himself.<br />
<br />
While he was finishing up his cigar, Jeff stared curiously at it, deciding then and there to return the traits to his daddies, just to see if he really liked cigars, or if it was all Ed&#39;s influence, and to try and keep a clearer mind. And so, with but a thought, he returned most of the stolen traits to his daddies, *spluttering and coughing* from the suddenly bitter taste in his mouth, unaccustomed to the foreign smoke in his lungs, and feeling bloated after eating so much, *groaning* he held his stomach, dropping the cigar in the process, as he thought &quot;I need to be more careful with this sharing thing, I didn&#39;t even realize just how much I had eaten&quot;, all the while trying to remove the bitter taste in his mouth, left from the pipe sitting next to him, and the still lit cigar on the floor, suddenly realizing just how stained his clothes were.<br />
<br />
After looking at himself he decided on taking back a bit of Cliff traits to deal with the too-full feeling, just enough to feel full and not bloated. Also using the opportunity to take some of his and Ed&#39;s intelligence, since they both hardly used it anyways.<br />
Using the chronivac, he cleaned himself up a bit and decided to go back to playing with his daddies, having cleared his head a bit thanks to his brief walk (and returning the traits).<br />
<br />
For now, he would leave the janitors to their job, “they will probably get more done in a few hours than in the whole week prior” thought Jeff drily, “the chronivac really is a thing of beauty, it made them just as I want my daddy’s to be, hell even Cliff being a Janitor is ironic, considering he can’t even clean himself properly without me telling him how…” mumbled Jeff to himself as he typed away at the chronivac. “That just makes me wonder how he managed to stay in the army for so many years in this reality. Maybe there is more to him than meets the eye…” said Jeff with a renewed interest in his slobby daddy, realizing he was the one he had spent the least amount of time with, not counting his new memories. Regardless, it was time to test out all the changes, but first he had to deal with his zombified daddy in the classroom, since the other 2 were often ignored by the rest of the faculty due to how crude and crass they were, so they should -probably- be fine by themselves for a few minutes.<br />
<br />
As Jeff made his way to the classroom he heard a commotion inside, someone was talking in a flustered manner. It seemed his daddy wasn’t alone.<br />
<br />
“…” thought Bull as a younger man was trying to shake him while saying something to him. He wasn’t the important boy, and so it didn’t really matter to him. Thus, he just stood there waiting patiently for his boy, making sure he didn’t piss or shit himself for the next 2 hours and 30 minutes, staring at the spot the boy had disappeared into, while the man got increasingly more agitated.<br />
<br />
“…bell, Mr. Cowbell!!? Are you all right!? Do you want me to call an ambulance!?? Please answer me!!” heard Jeff from a flustered young man inside the classroom. As Jeff entered, he found a youngish security guard who couldn’t be older than 25 trying to shake an unresponsive old man over twice his girth.<br />
<br />
“Is he all right!?? Is he going to die!? Did he have a stroke or something!?” thought the man called Kris Dawson frantically, while feeling choked up thanks to the stupid tie he had to wear on his ill-fitting security guard uniform, too big on his rail-thin like body. “My boss won&#39;t die on me in my first week! This is the first decent job I got since I graduated college as an art mayor” Thought Kris, “even if it’s at my old school” he added self-deprecatingly as his mind jumped around in panic. Suddenly he heard a noise behind him, and while turning around he caught sight of a young man, seemingly a bit too old to still be in high school, with a sheepishly looking smile on his face, as if he got caught doing something naughty.<br />
<br />
“YOU! He whined loudly; did you do something to Mr. Cowbell!!? Why is he like this!??” Kris said frantically, “he doesn’t respond when I talk to him, and he is drooling so much! The janitors were of no help, they simply ignored me and left me here with him!” he said while frantically trying to shake Bull out of his stupor.<br />
<br />
Jeff caught up quickly to what was happening and decided to test out his abilities before things went out of hand. “Besides” he thought “He doesn’t look nor act the way a security guard is supposed to, I’m just helping him out really” he thought with a smile. “Calm down man” he said to Kris, “a 50-year-old guy like you shouldn’t get this flustered, did you even call for help? Or did you just stand around shouting at a near comatose man? haven’t you been the security guard here all your life? Where is your radio?” added Jeff while staring at the panicked man.<br />
<br />
For a second Kris stood still as if trying to comprehend whatever Jeff had just said, but after a moment he started calming down “You are right young man, I don’t know what came over me” Kris said to the handsome young man, in a calmer and deeper yet still whinny voice, not noticing the changes in his body as he rapidly doubled in age, nor the different way he thought of the nice young man in front of him. The years rapidly pilling on his unchanging rail-thin body, now standing at 5’7 feet tall in a still ill-fitting security guard garb, that he wore with an air of resignation, remembering how after finishing high school he didn’t went to college and instead got a job at the same high school, begging the then director to let him work there, despite not fulfilling the usual requirements for faculty, telling himself he would just be working there for a few months to save some money, and ending up staying there for decades to come.<br />
<br />
As the security guard stood there, no doubt reminiscing on his new memories, Jeff could finally take a good look at the guy. Not liking much of what he saw, he was balding heavily -which he liked- but didn&#39;t wear it well, trying to hide it with a comb-over, and while that was funny to Jeff, it just looked sad and pathetic on the guy. His ill-fitting uniform had his name and title -Security Guard Kris Dawson- embroidered on the upper right pocket -a theme for school personnel-. &quot;Even his name is lame&quot;, thought Jeff. &quot;That also has to go&quot;. The guy looked to weigh 100 pounds soaking wet and had too small feet, little to no body hair, and no muscles worth the name.<br />
<br />
&quot;-Sad and pathetic- seems to be the current theme of this daddy to be&quot; thought Jeff &quot;and that simply will not do&quot; he commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm? I&#39;m sorry did you say something?&quot; Said the security guard to Jeff, using a far calmer and respectful tone. &quot;Sorry I couldn&#39;t quite hear you; I was lost in thought for a second there he-he&quot; he said lamely. <br />
<br />
Seemingly having come to a decision, Jeff started using his ability on the security guard, &quot;Your name is Karl Sobaka, nicknamed &quot;Dog&quot; thought Jeff. &quot;You are a simple minded, confident and diligent security guard working your dream job at this School, you love it here and wouldn&#39;t change it for the world, you love protecting this place, it&#39;s students and it&#39;s faculty, you even chose to live in the basement, just so you can be here at all hours of the day,  every day&quot; thought Jeff while focusing intensely on the security guard. &quot;You have trained and abused your body with steroids to become what you think is the ultimate guardian for this School, but in reality, you just look freaky with that big roid gut of yours, your shaved head, 300-pound hairy body, handlebar mustache and big stinky feet -size 17-. You have a penchant for sniffing people, especially people you like, like a dog would. You are obsessed with male feet and love having your face stomped by them. You have the ability to sense where people are inside school grounds, yet you aren&#39;t and cannot be consciously aware of this ability and attribute it to your uncannily honed talents as a security guard. You wear a chastity cage on your small cock -induced by roids- just so you can always remain focused on what you deeply and unwaveringly believe is a very important job&quot;. Finished Jeff with a somewhat tired expression.<br />
<br />
The physical changes were as quick as always, in the blink of an eye the skeletal nerdy man in front of him was gone, replaced by a much better version - in Jeff&#39;s humble opinion-.<br />
<br />
Karl Sobaka is a 5,8 tall man, with a too wide nose, smallish, shaved head, and a handlebar mustache that framed a perpetually smirking mouth -the kind only stupid overconfidence can provide- while wearing a pair of sleek sunglasses, too trendy for an old man like him. He looks like the epitome of the roid abusing gym goer, with unnaturally big and bulbous muscles, especially on his upper torso, with arms so overtly developed that he practically cannot cross them over his protruding chest and ball gut, but has trained himself to do so, just so that he can pose properly while he attempts to look menacing, ending up looking ridiculous, like a too ripe fruit about to pop. <br />
The previously ill-fitting uniform is still ill-fitting but in a different way, where it once hung over his too-thin frame it now looked painted on, far too small and spread far too thin to cover the bulbous hulking form. Karl didn&#39;t look at all bothered by the too tight clothing, seemingly relishing the constricting feeling, wearing it with a pridefulness only meatheads can truly show. A chain tattoo could be seen through his shirt on his right arm, the basic gym-bro kind chosen by how “manly” it looked rather than for any deeper meaning. The too-tight white shirt unable to hide anything below it, also revealing a wife beater with the words “Top Dawg” emblazoned on it. The black uniform pants stretched over a wide behind, while seeming rather roomy in the front, it was a testament to its quality - or perhaps due to the chronivacs meddling - how the uniform didn&#39;t just tear into a thousand pieces every time Karl moved. The pants were held up by a black-brownish looking belt, joined to a utility belt with a gun-looking weapon holstered in it (probably a stun gun - thought Jeff), the thing was chock full of pouches, filled to the brim by who knows what, making him look even wider. His big odorous feet were booted on what looked like an army surplus boot, black, and shined to perfection. Even from this distance Jeff could smell the musk coming from the man in a mix of sweat, feet funk and cheap cologne -the kind a guy wears because he saw it in a commercial somewhere and thought it was cool-.<br />
<br />
The mental changes took a moment, as the now dazed security guard shook his head like a dog and looked at Jeff, seemingly for the very first time.<br />
<br />
As Karl Sobaka stood there, next to his dazed boss, he suddenly realized that the love of his life, his soulmate, had just stepped into the classroom and was staring at him. “He is the most handsome and manly young man I have ever seen” thought Karl in wonder, as he desperately tried to get a *whiff* of him even from this distance, afraid to get too close and frighten him with his big body and commanding presence. He racked his tiny brain trying to think about how to solve this situation, finding his security guard training failing him for the first time in his life, not preparing him for a situation such as this. Subconsciously he assumed a saluting pose -chin up, chest out, shoulders back, stomach in, eyes forwards and feet firmly on the ground, parallel to each other-, hands behind his back as far as his muscular arms and butt allowed, shown in many of the hundreds of hours of training videos he had seen over the years, meant to show respect for, what he suddenly felt like, was the most important person in his life. He had never felt like this before, him being a virgin, never having dated in all his decades of life, -too career focused to ever take a day off- much less to focus on a student he was supposed to protect, he felt such conflicting feelings, that they overwhelmed his tiny mind, short circuiting him and leaving him standing there in his -natural- guard pose as he tried to decide on the best course of action.<br />
<br />
Jeff stared amused at the ridiculous looking man in front of him, he was so top heavy -even more so than Bull- that he was amazed he didn&#39;t just topple over “the guy skipped leg day a lot” thought Jeff with a smile.  The uniform pants looked painted over, as they strained to contain the unnatural muscle beneath them, but they were nothing compared to those gigantic arms and gut, the guy was just too wide -from all sides-, to ever enter doors comfortably, and the way he stood made his bulbous chest look even bigger, bringing attention to it. And it only made his tiny bulge look even smaller by comparison, Jeff knew that it was even smaller than that, considering that what could be seen was most likely the cock cage jutting out uncomfortably, pushed out by his too wide legs. In short, physically the guy looked perfect, and the way his wide neck was squeezed by the immaculate looking black tie (Karl took care of his uniform almost as much as he abused his muscles) was just the icing on the big bulbous cake.<br />
<br />
Karl deemed himself a man of action, and so after a minute or so of indecision, he finally said the first thing that came to mind “SIR! I need to be reprimanded SIR!” He barked out loudly, in his now deeper and bovine sounding voice, feeling that he had failed, first by not helping his boss who was still just standing there drooling, and second by not knowing what to do about the important young man in front of him. And his training instilled on him the wisdom that a guard should be reprimanded by his superiors whenever they made a mistake, that way they would know better next time. And he couldn&#39;t think of someone more superior to him than the young man standing before him.<br />
Jeff&#39;s musings were cut short by the sudden barking, surprised by how deep his voice was. &quot;He sounds so much better now&quot; thought Jeff, &quot;A lot better than his formerly nasally and whiny voice&quot; in his opinion. As he stood there looking at Karl, he couldn’t help but notice him squirming under his gaze every now and then, like a puppy in training, not quite sure how to behave, finding Karl’s behavior to be incredibly cute.<br />
<br />
For his part, Bull thought &quot;...&quot;. While the important young man had entered the classroom once again. Feeling elated to see him, showing it by the dopey smile that now adorned his face, that made him drool even more. A line of it breaking down and falling on his loafers, giving Jeff the inspiration of what he should do about Karl&#39;s request for punishment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Karl&quot;, said Jeff commandingly, making the security guard jump and straighten up even more, &quot;I agree you have been lax in your duties. I have known you for years at this School, and this is the first time I have seen you fail like this. What do you have to say for yourself?&quot; Jeff asked Karl.<br />
<br />
Karl Sobaka stood at rapt attention at what the important young man was saying, intensely focused on his words as a good security guard should, feeling very disappointed at himself once -Jeff he now remembered- stopped speaking. For the first time in his life, he had failed as a security guard, letting something happen to a faculty member right under his nose. As he heard the question directed at him, he perked up and said &quot;SIR! This one has no excuse SIR! This one should have known better! SIR! This one didn&#39;t show you the proper respect! SIR! This one failed to protect the Director and is failing in aiding him even now! SIR!&quot;. All the while remembering all the times he had met the young man before him, realizing that he liked him from the very first time that he had seen him, having felt specially protective of him for years, but -being a career focused man and the boy being one of his many charges- he had had to make the hard choice to remain stoic, only paying Jeff special attention when his duties allowed him too, which wasn&#39;t much. Like nodding to him when he passed him by, in break of strict security guard protocol, and once or twice looking away as he saw Jeff cutting classes or being late to school, wracked with shame at ignoring his calling, but happy in knowing he had made Jeff&#39;s day a little better.<br />
<br />
Just now Jeff realized how extensive the mental changes had been, the guy had been completely transformed into the &quot;ideal&quot; security guard for the school, thinking first of his duties and then himself, and now his newly found feelings for Jeff were wrestling for his attention, shattering that compass.<br />
<br />
Jeff couldn&#39;t be happier about how his security daddy had turned out. Jeff couldn&#39;t wait to hang around with his other daddies and see just how much they had changed, just how ridiculous they now where. Deciding then and there he would keep this guy around as one of his official daddies, recognizing he probably would be making too many changes to too many people to keep them all around all the time. And, as he made his decision, a connection formed with Karl, Jeff now sensing he could take his traits, and having the feeling that Karl would now be affected by Ed’s injury sharing ability.<br />
<br />
“So, I have to consciously decide to make them my daddies, and not just simply change them” thought Jeff, realizing the implications. This way he could mess around with a ton of people, and they would just continue with their lives unaware of the changes, perhaps feeling slightly closer to the random young man they met for a moment, finding him constantly in their thoughts, but little else. “This is probably the best way it can be&#39;&#39;, thought Jeff, “since I do feel a slight sense of responsibility for my changed daddies, and things would get overwhelming If every guy I changed would join the ever-growing gang”.<br />
<br />
Shaking his head, &quot;KARL!&quot; barked Jeff at the security guard, imitating his tone in a mocking manner, making the guard flinch subconsciously, - causing Karl to feel even more upset at himself for his unusual poor control - &quot;you are absolutely correct, you have failed in your duties and must be punished for it,” said Jeff. “But don&#39;t fret about the Director, he is fine, just resting a bit, you know how he overworks himself. I will talk to him and wake him up, you just aren&#39;t the right guy for the job&quot; continued Jeff. “Now stand at attention to the side and keep guard, while I talk to the Director&quot; ordered Jeff to Karl as if it was the most natural thing in the world for a student to order around an older -scary looking- security guard.<br />
<br />
Karl saluted Jeff automatically, feeling relieved that he would be properly punished for his mistake, while immediately trusting that the Director was fine, not even considering the possibility that Jeff, a student, would lie to him. He simply trusted him too much for that, and so he obeyed as quickly as his bulky body would allow him, moving to the side so that Jeff could walk directly to the Director. Standing at attention with his arms crossed over as much as they could, over his wide chest and gut, while looking intensely at the door and windows, protecting both the director and Jeff from intruders,  all the while unconsciously stealing  glances to Jeff, feeling both happy and shameful every time he looked at him, trying to control himself to no avail, falling on his training to try and keep him focused on his duty, as he felt his small cock trying to get hard and burst through its cage for the first time in ages. Having forgotten about the thing entirely for who knows how long.<br />
<br />
As Jeff stared at the lumbering man moving to the side, he decided to test out the changes even more. &quot;Tell me Karl, is anyone else near us?&quot; Asked Jeff, hoping to avoid having to transform yet another guy before he finished dealing with the current ones.<br />
<br />
Karl looked at Jeff and instinctively answered before he could even think of what he was saying, -like a well-oiled machine- he thought pridefully while already answering. &quot;NO SIR!, only the Janitors as I told you moments ago, everyone else in the complex is inside the faculty annex, all the students, but you, have already evacuated the premises, and all the other security personnel is hanging out in the security annex, knowing that I want to do all the job myself, while the two of them check out the cameras or sleep through their shifts, the lazy bums&quot;. Barked a frowning Karl, un-amusedly sharing his feelings about the other &quot;security guards&quot; -unworthy of the title in his opinion-, while wondering why he shared his feelings at all, being something so unlike his ever-present professional behavior.<br />
<br />
Jeff had to fight not bursting out in laughter as the -too serious- security guard answered something he couldn&#39;t possibly have known with such certainty. All the while sharing something as personal as his feelings about the &quot;normal&quot; security guards who were probably all too happy to leave all the hard work to him, seemingly unfazed and unbothered in answering a stranger in such a manner. &quot;He probably can&#39;t help himself&quot; thought Jeff &quot;he seems either unwilling, or unable, to lie or hide things from me, all thanks to his dutiful new nature” thought Jeff trying hard to remain stoic &quot;I can&#39;t wait to mess with him some more&quot; thought Jeff evilly &quot;Such a simple guy is too funny to mess around with, he probably won&#39;t even realize I made him do something weird until hours after the fact, if ever&quot;. &quot;And as for the other security guys and teachers? I will get them in due time&quot; thought Jeff inwardly smiling.</p>
