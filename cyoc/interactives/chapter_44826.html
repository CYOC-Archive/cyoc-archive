<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Drake hadn't seen his friend Rob for a few days and was wondering where he had been.  The two boys were both on the football team and would usually meet both and training and out on the town looking for ladies.  It was unusual for Rob to be absent without warning, but having knocked on the door of his dorm room several times in the last couple of days, Drake was left wondering.  So when Rob finally showed up at his door one evening, Drake was ready to hear some tall tale or another relating his latest exploits.<br />
<br />
&quot;DUDE!  Where've you been?  And you're smiling like the cat that got the cream.  How so?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Rob just said nothing, but carried on grinning as he came into the room and sat on a chair.  &quot;Dude, you will not believe ...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, c'mon!  Out with it, spill!&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well dude, the thing is, you DID see me yesterday.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At the beach -- when you were playing catch with the guys?  Remember the group of chicks from the Catholic college that came down for the game?  Remember the blonde chick?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The homely chess nerd?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No dude!  The other blonde chick.  The cheerleader.  Well ... that was me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NO WAY.&quot;<br />
<br />
Drake advanced on Rob and put him in a deathlock position.<br />
<br />
&quot;C'mon, stop shitting me.  Where have you really been.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, get off me!  I'm telling the truth.  And I can prove it to you.  But first I'm gonna tell you how it happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rob looked at Drake with such an expression on his face that somehow, against all reason, Drake released him -- fully expecting to be made a fool of for it for years to come.  And yet, still once he was free, Drake continued with his story:<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember that Amazonian idol those geeks dug up in the hills last year?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sure, it was all over the papers.  Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the girl I been seeing -- Veronica.  Well, she's kind of superstitious, one of the reasons I ain't seeing her no more.  One night last week we were sharing a joint and she went crazy about that thing, saying no one should have disturbed it and it was dangerous to even touch it.  Well, obviously I couldn't leave it at that.  I promised then and there that I would break into the campus museum and steal the fucker to prove to her that she was paranoid and seriously had to chill out.<br />
<br />
Well, Friday night I sneaked in to the museum before closing and stole the spare keys the curator keeps under the coffee maker.  It was so easy dude!  Anyway, I took off my sneakers and left them outside in the parking lot and managed to sneak past the security guy in my socks.  I went inside and opened the cabinet.  I was a bit anxious about it, really; Dane told me they had no more security than the old guy outside, no alarms and shit, but I really didn't know what to expect.<br />
<br />
So, my heart was racing once the cabinet was open -- you can imagine.  I waited thirty seconds, that seemed like an hour.  Still nothing.  I steeled myself and grabbed the ugly little thing.  Then I heard it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heard what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A high-pitched noise.  More like a screaming than an alarm.  But still, I nearly shit myself.  I looked around and saw no one coming.  I quickly reinserted the troll in the cabinet and ran outside to put on my shoes.<br />
<br />
&quot;But once I was outside I was visited by an extreme attack of pain.  It was like nothing I'd ever experienced.  My whole body seemed to be on fire.  Dude, it was the weirdest shit.  Then I realised that there was more.<br />
<br />
My body was changing.  At first I thought I was hallucinating.  My hands seemed to be shrinking, but after I took a few deep breaths I realised it wasn't just my hands.  I had already lost inches from my whole body.  As I stuffed my feet into my sneakers I noticed that both shoes and socks were loose and no longer fitted properly.<br />
<br />
Well at that point I thought I'd had it.  The fucker was coated in some kind of poison that was doing its deadly work and I wasn't long for this world.  I closed my eyes and even started saying my prayers at one point.  But I was distracted by searing pain in my groin.  I looked down and saw I had a massive boner which gradually shrank away to nothing.  I mean my penis stayed erect and shrank in that state.<br />
<br />
I realised too that I had somehow already lost my balls without noticing.<br />
<br />
By this point I was at least five inches shorter and still shrinking.  And then, other changes.  First I felt my muscles shrink and soften, and then after all the pain the most indescribable feeling of smoothness.  The body hair was melting away from the surface of my skin at the same time as a wave of subcutaneous fat broke around my body.  My hips, my thighs, my ass, my chest -- all slowly developing feminine curves.<br />
<br />
It was only later when I found a mirror that I saw the changes to my face.  Well, at first I was totally freaked out.  The changes slowed down and I managed to walk, taking off my size 13 sneakers first of course as they no longer even stayed on my new size 6 feet.  I walked back to the dorm and then I realised it is male-only.  Not sure what to do, I went towards the girls' dorm.  I was sitting outside smoking a ciggie when Veronica's friend Joan found me and took me inside.<br />
<br />
She could see I was traumatized and though we never discussed it I think she assumed someone slipped me a mickey and that was how come I was sitting there, barefoot in an outsized guy's sport shirt and shorts in the middle of the night.</p>
