<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Vicky brings you to a halt.<br />
Samantha, Michelle and Christine are ahead of you single file.  Wafting through the air is musk, thick and heavy; that is not coming from these girls ahead of you.<br />
Beside you Vicky laughs, &quot;I never cease being amazed at how none of you all dry out!  Princess, when&#39;s the last time you had a drink of water?  Yet here you are, gushing from your big ol&#39; cave of wonder while you wait your turn...&quot;<br />
You try to think of when the last time you drank actually was...you have been trying to think of anything but that savory odor invading your nostrils.  It&#39;s not working so you attempt to concentrate on Vicky&#39;s words.<br />
&#39;wait your turn&#39;?  Yesterday all the ladies were in service to their stallion at the same time.  You did not want to &#39;wait your turn&#39;!<br />
You give a snort.  Vicky is able to immediately pick up on the reason, giggling she reminds, &quot;a mare doesn&#39;t set the schedule, not here and certainly not once she&#39;s in the pasture.&quot;  she looks directly at you with her smile, a smile that some recessed part of memory actually would have found attractive.  That tiny notice sparks a little wad of jealousy...envy too...that she is a human female and so can make choices as far as coupling with a male, but mostly you feel a competitive jealousy simply because she is an attractive female.  How odd...but there was something you were trying to figure out...<br />
&quot;When you&#39;re in season you&#39;ll be in demand and use for training...if you stay here; other places they may decide not to breed you a season or even never breed.  It&#39;s possible you could end up as the only horse, or maybe with a bunch of other mares only.&quot;<br />
That thought washes over you a moment, a moment of horror at the thought of the bottomless pit of want your sex has become when you enter heat.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s why all this has been important.  You think you&#39;ve just been enjoying yourselves here.  You&#39;ve been proving yourself.  Your group watched the lucky ones yesterday.  Each of those mares had something we saw that set them apart, made them special.  Well, you probably were already aware of that in your girlfriend Jessica,&quot; She looked directly at you with a smug smile, &quot;you did recognize her yesterday didn&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
A loud laugh, smile lighting up Vicky&#39;s face as she reads your thoughts.  &quot;No silly!  She was the gorgeous chestnut one...not the stallion!  Oh my gosh!  The women who come in don&#39;t really get to choose their gender like you got to...&quot; she paused for any sort of dissent from you.  Receiving none she smiled and stroked your head...for the first time ever you lowered it submissively to allow her to continue; she leant in and gave it a kiss, whispering an affectionate &quot;Awww...&quot; at your gesture.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so sorry you couldn&#39;t have shown me earlier Princess!&quot; Sincerity shown in her blue eyes, &quot;Even yesterday...I could have changed my rating still and gotten you a spot staying here.  You and Jessica could have become friends again.  It&#39;s so sad!&quot; You could see Vicky&#39;s eyes moisten.<br />
<br />
You whinnied in panic, pleading, begging this woman to reconsider your fate.  &quot;You&#39;re makin&#39; me cry Princess...&quot;  Your forelegs begin to bend, your massive equine head bows almost to the dust of the yard...you&#39;ve seen ponies kneel before, trained to perform, in shows...you manage to bring yourself almost to the ground before your balance starts to go.  You haven&#39;t been trained for this, lacking the knowledge and skill of the horses you&#39;d seen when human you start to topple.  Vickie is in the way!  You might land on her, crushing her, so you try to push up and leap clear of  your original landing spot, hitting into a wall and landing on your side heavily with a terrified, pained whinny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my goodness, Princess!&quot; Vicky rushes over.  You lie on the ground in pain.  Across from your resting spot you see Michelle being taken beneath the stallion.  Unlike yesterday&#39;s handsome males this is a smaller one.  A Mustang you assess with disappointment.  For the moment your heat has subsided, and you feel Vickie&#39;s wonderful hands soothing along your head and neck.<br />
Then she is angry, &quot;What on earth were you doing?  Not just any old horse can kneel, it takes intelligence and training...you have a good heart and I know you were trying to please me...&quot; she kisses your forehead, &quot;but you&#39;re not capable of something so graceful...it&#39;s too late anyway, no one can change those ratings now...silly girl!  You had so many times to do that...and I really really wanted it for you.  I&#39;m sorry Princess,&quot; she looked over at the fucking animals, Michelle was letting out an inhuman screech.<br />
&quot;You go Jerry!&quot; Vicky called out, laughing, to the little male atop Michelle.<br />
&quot;Jerry&#39;s small but he&#39;s mighty!&quot; she continues laughing as she turns back to you, &quot;and he can be nasty when he needs, he gets what he wants in the end.&quot; Looking back over at the two coupled and joined forever as animals now she muses, &quot;I remember when he came in.  We girls were laughing, all five foot seven or eight of him, acting like little big man...but he learned.&quot; she pointed out one of the female trainers with mousy brown hair and pinched face. &quot;Within a week Becky had him literally eating out of her hand.  She was like a Goddess to him once she set the rules.  We love him now; such a better stallion than he was a man.&quot;  Rubbing your neck and trying to get you back up with help from two big male attendants.<br />
&quot;His cock is OK sized...I mean none of the stallions we have are Shire horses...&quot; she laughed, &quot;but then none of our stallions will tear a girl up, Thank Goodness!&quot; she smiled as you struggled up.  &quot;You&#39;ll feel him, Jerry, once he&#39;s in good; you&#39;ll know something&#39;s inside you...though honestly I think a girl Michelle&#39;s size it&#39;s less the case of his physical prowess than the energy he puts into subordinating her.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
You both watched as Michelle was led past, head hanging, defeated with bloody marks from Jerry&#39;s teeth.<br />
&quot;Poor girl.&quot; Vicky was genuinely sad, &quot;I think she&#39;ll end up being a recipient...that&#39;s always sad; but she&#39;s made her choices too.&quot;<br />
You&#39;re puzzled, not knowing the term.  Vicky, as usual, picks up on your lack of knowledge and experience.  You wonder if you are particularly stupid for a mare...self consciously certain that Jessica is a much smarter mare, and realizing the levels of intelligence above you that Vicky possesses.  You look in awe at Vicky as the woman explains a recipient mare is one in whom embryos from a mare such as Jessica are implanted.  This spares the body of the Jessica mare from the burdens of pregnancy and transfers it to the Michelle animal.  You wonder if this could be your fate, are you a &#39;Michelle animal&#39;?  You know for certain you don&#39;t qualify as a Jessica...in fact, for a second you wonder how you ever managed to make your way to having been a boyfriend to her.<br />
Again, seemingly reading your mind Vicky offers. &quot;I hope you don&#39;t end up the same Princess.  You&#39;re such a good animal deep down...&quot;<br />
You whinny gratefully and try to nuzzle at Vicky.  She smiles and gives you another kiss, &quot;I think you&#39;ll make a wonderful momma, your little foal suckling your teats.  When you&#39;re back in estrus next time I can&#39;t imagine you being anything but eager to be taken by whatever stallion comes along...that&#39;s why I think you&#39;ll do fine by Jerry.&quot; She giggled, &quot;I guess you&#39;re kind of what I call a slut, we have a few at my school.  They&#39;re really not bad girls, just low self worth...kinda needy and then some guy comes along and they feel like they have to keep his attention however they can...which, for a girl like that...well, you understand I think.&quot; She patted you knowingly and you nuzzled back, thankful for her attention.  &quot;I can&#39;t wait to get to college, two more years!  Wonder what you&#39;ll be up to in two years, huh?&quot; she mused.  &quot;The owners here keep encouraging me to go to veterinary school...and I could, but...I dunno I think I want more, I feel like the whole world is open to me.  Speaking of open, let&#39;s not forget why we&#39;re here.&quot;<br />
<br />
As she takes hold to lead you back into line she notices you have a hesitancy to put weight on your front foot.<br />
&quot;Oh dear!  This can&#39;t be good.  Let&#39;s just hope it&#39;s not lethal, it would be a shame if they had to put you down...&quot; she motioned some attendants over, &quot;either way, we&#39;ve got to get moving.  If you don&#39;t get some horse cock inside you within a few hours you&#39;ll be sorry!&quot; she laughed and the attendants came and called for the vet.  Christine was spraying urine, Samantha was under mount and being attended to, so to speak and you began once again to find yourself focusing on stallions and their unique scent; barely registering that you only had a few hours to be covered by a male.  What you did know is that Vicky wanted you to be happy...if a horse could feel &#39;love&#39; you certainly felt it for Vicky.  Even the feeble human remnant in your mind was awestruck by such presence, beauty and poise; and only a high school Sophmore or Junior!</p>
