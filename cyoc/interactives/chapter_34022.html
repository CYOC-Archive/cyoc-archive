<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jill now had a small waist, but she wanted a real, womanly figure, so the next thing on her list was breasts. She knew that most women were very conscious of the bust size and would notice immediately if something changed, so she had to be careful. The easiest way, she realised, would be to take the breasts of a young girl who had just entered puberty, that way, the girl would think she was just a late bloomer. As she thought this through, Jill caught a bit of conversation from a table a few yards away.<br />
<br />
“I know you want a bra sweetie, but are you sure you really need one yet?”<br />
“Yes Mom!” a little girl’s voice replied angrily.<br />
“This isn’t just because your little friends are starting to get their breasts is it?”<br />
“No Mom! I really do have breasts, they just started growing a little while ago.” Jill looked over and saw the girl was right. She had obviously worn her tightest shirt to show off the fact that she had two small mounds on her chest, probably just big enough to fit an A cup, but her oblivious mother didn’t seem to see them. Perfect thought Jill as she turned the gun to Breasts and fired at the girl.<br />
<br />
As she watched, Jill saw nothing at all happening to the girl’s chest, and nothing at all happening to her own. But just as she was about to give up and try to work out what was wrong with the gun, the little mounds under the girl’s shirt deflated and Jill’s chest warmed and pushed out a bit. She had finally taken the girl’s boobs, but why had it taken so long? She thought back to when Sue had taken her assets. At the time, 18 year old Jill had lost a full set of C cups, while 5 year old Sue had gained nothing but slightly bigger nipples. But when their ages were changed again, 14 year old Sue had D cups and nine year old Jill had nothing. That gave Jill an idea.<br />
<br />
Seeing that the girl had just started on a large triple scoop ice cream, Jill knew they would be there for a while, so she headed to the women’s bathroom to test her theory. She went into an empty stall and pulled the door almost all the way shut, peering through the crack over the minus barrel of the gun, which she had pointed at the basins. A woman in her 50s came out of a nearby stall and Jill immediately started stealing age from her so that when it was done, the woman was in her early 40s and Jill was about 20. Jill looked down at herself. Sadly, not much had changed, although she was slightly taller. Her waist was just as tiny, since she had taken it from that woman earlier. Her hair had just gone 7 years without a trim and was nearly down to her knees. But it was her breasts which interested her. She was a C cup! Jill knew that since Sue had taken all her own breast growth, everything she had must have come from the little girl with the ice cream. But she had only taken one cup size, since that was all the girl had. It seemed Jill’s theory was right: she had taken the boobs the girl would have had when she grew up. The time when nothing had happened was the time it took to steal the two cup sizes the little girl hadn’t grown into yet. Her experiment over, Jill returned the 7 years she had stolen to the woman at the basin and watched her chest deflate back to an A cup and her hair recede back to her shoulders. <br />
<br />
She went back to her table in the food court and suddenly felt something she’d rarely felt in her life: guilt. Jill realised she had taken every ounce of breast flesh that little girl would ever have. She had doomed her to go through what Jill had just lived: years of watching her friends grow up and go through bra sizes while remaining completely flat herself, and unlike Jill, this girl hadn’t done a thing to deserve it. Feeling bad about it, Jill turned the gun around and waited as she transferred back the girl’s potential boobs and finally her budding A cups. She timed it this time, and worked out that a transfer of one cup size, real or potential, took about 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
Just because Jill had a weak moment where that particular girl was concerned, didn’t mean she had given up on stealing breasts altogether, just that she would leave that girl alone. She caught sight of two little girls about 9 years old coming out of a music store across from her table and quickly fired the gun at them. She held the trigger for 10 seconds each, taking one potential cup size from both girls. That would make her a B cup once she was done with puberty. It wasn’t enough though, Sue was a D cup and Jill had to be bigger than that, she wanted to be a DD girl. She scanned the food court, found another couple of likely targets and stole two more potential cup sizes from pre-teen girls at the mall. That would put her at a D cup, the same as Sue, but not enough for Jill. Plus it was extremely unsatisfying not to see any change in her body with all that she’d taken. She took a quick peek down her shirt when nobody was looking to make sure she really hadn’t changed and noticed that, the same as Sue, her nipples and areolae were a little bit bigger, as a sign of things to come. Still, she wanted something to show that she was finally growing a bit and decided to take some actual breast flesh from a woman. <br />
<br />
At that moment she heard a familiar voice from the table behind her and turned to see one of the cheerleaders from her school flirting with a good-looking guy. The girl had the first three buttons of her blouse undone and was showing off a few inches of cleavage to the lucky guy. Jill decided to have some revenge on the stuck-up cheerleader who was always taunting girls less developed than she was, which was just about everybody. She pointed the minus end of the gun at the flirting little witch and let rip, taking three cup sizes off her in half a minute. This left the cheerleader at an A cup, a fact the guy was quick to notice and he made his excuses and left. The cheerleader looked down, horrified, at her shrunken bust and ran crying out of the mall. Jill was now a well filled C cup and thought she looked good, but soon realised that if she started at a C, she’d soon grow into an F cup with all the potential cup sizes she’d already stolen. Jill wanted to be busty, but not that big. With that in mind she wandered around the shops in the area until she found a flat chested girl in her 20s working at a fast food outlet who seemed tired and downtrodden. Jill’s good deed of the day was to point the plus end of the gun at the girl at the counter and transfer two cup sizes over, making her a B cup and putting a huge smile on her face when she noticed the growth.</p>
