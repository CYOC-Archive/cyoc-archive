<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Back in Kyle’s apartment, Andy was still relaxing while cuddled up with Kyle and waiting for Jim to come back with something to eat. As he waited, he heard Kyle quietly muttering to himself in his half-asleep daze.<br />
<br />
“What’s the matter, buddy? Having a bad dream?” Andy said quietly, running a hand down the big man’s body and teasing his still-sensitive dick. “Or a really good one?”<br />
<br />
However, Andy felt something strange going on in his hand, and he looked down and saw Kyle’s cock getting bigger and bigger by the minute underneath his fingers. Not getting erect, just growing longer and thicker, until it was a mirror match to Andy and Jim&#39;s impressive packages. Andy pulled his hand back like it had been burnt and looked on in amazement as a hefty foreskin grew up around Kyle’s dick, and a considerable bush starting to grow around his whole crotch. Soon, it grew enough to link up with the hair on his stomach and chest in a fuzzy treasure trail across his whole torso.<br />
<br />
Andy heard the front door to Kyle’s apartment opening up quietly and his twin brother’s steps coming toward the bedroom, and he immediately had a feeling what was happening. Jim walked in with a grin on his face and tossed Andy a beer and protein bar.<br />
<br />
“Is it working?” Jim whispered, sitting down to get a good look at Kyle as he changed.<br />
<br />
“I thought you were talking a little long in there,” Andy said, popping the top on his beer and sipping it. “Y’know, I worked hard on him to get him the way I’d like him.”<br />
<br />
“Well, I think you’ll like this, too. Just watch,” Jim said, getting a serious look on his face.<br />
<br />
Kyle suddenly sat up in bed and stretched out his arms while yawning. As he did, his arms literally seemed to stretch longer while his biceps became leaner on his new longer limbs. His torso grew longer and leaner as well, until he was a couple inches taller than Jim and Andy at a respectable 6’3”. After stretching out and getting comfortable in bed, Kyle finally opened his eyes, making Andy’s jaw drop when he saw them.<br />
<br />
Big blue eyes, matching his and Jim’s. All the men in their family had those eyes, which he could remember seeing every day for his whole life. And now Kyle had them, too. Andy spun around in bed and looked at Jim, who was grinning as he continued to watch Kyle change.<br />
<br />
“Bro, you didn’t! H-he’s not gonna be-,” Andy started to say before Jim put a finger to his lips.<br />
<br />
“Shush. This is the important part, dude,” his twin said, and together the twin brothers kept watching their “test subject’s” final changes.<br />
<br />
With a quiet grinding sound, Kyle’s face started to shift around, his jaw squaring off and becoming clean-shaven as a couple of years were slowly whittled away from his appearance, leaving him a mere twenty years old. A heavy, dark pair of eyebrows started to grow in over his new blue eyes, standing out against his lightening hair. His hair finally settled in on a sandy brown, not quite the same as Jim and Andy’s, and growing down just past his ears in loose curls. After a bit of momentary discomfort for Kyle, his face ended up as a perfect replica of the young man in the photo that Jim had scanned, that of their brother Luke Young.<br />
<br />
Kyle (or was it Luke?) stood up from the bed, showing off his full naked body to the twins, who recognized every freckle on their brother’s body. Hell, Kyle even smelled like their brother, his musk filling the air as he crawled out from under the sweaty covers of the bed. The three young men had worked out together ever day since they were 13, and had never been ashamed of looking at each other’s bodies, after all. They were triplets, two identical and one non-identical, but still as thick as thieves. Luke had always been the ‘big bro’ in their group since he was a bit taller and more responsible than his horny, impulsive ‘little bros’ Jim and Andy. <br />
<br />
At least, that was the past as Jim and Andy remembered it. The question remained, however…<br />
<br />
“I-Is he really Luke? Or is he just Kyle with a new coat of paint?” Andy whispered. Kyle mumbled to himself tiredly and walked out of the bedroom, bumping his head on the doorframe on the way to the bathroom and swearing under his breath in Luke’s voice.<br />
<br />
“Not sure… I’m not as good with that program as you,” Jim admitted, wondering for himself if he’d really managed to bring their brother back from the dead so easily. The two young men waited silently, hoping for a sign that it really was Luke and not Kyle that was just a few feet away from them, looking over himself in the bathroom mirror…<br />
<br />
“…What the hell!?” they heard Luke’s voice shouting from the bathroom. “W-what happened to me!? ...M-my face... my dick!”<br />
<br />
Andy sighed in disappointment, having gotten his hopes up for a moment there. “Well, I guess that answers that question. Come on, let’s try to figure out how to deal with this before he passes out again.”<br />
<br />
Jim nodded and hopped up, running over toward the apartment’s bathroom with Andy right behind him…</p>
