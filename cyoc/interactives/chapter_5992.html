<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Somehow I was able to keep my mind at ease the rest of Saturday and Sunday.  I have to admit I was extremely anxious to make sure everything worked as planned.<br />
<br />
I went into school Monday like everything was normal.  Normal meeting with my friends, normal first two classes.  Everything was OK.  My third period was a free period that I usually spent in the library doing some help restocking books.  I went to my locker to put back the books I no longer needed.<br />
<br />
The halls were relatively empty.  Most everyone else was in their class.  I heard someone approaching me.  I had a feeling it was one of the girls.  I turned my head and saw Lindsey approaching me.  I played it cool and quickly turned back to my locker.  She came right up to me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, Joe,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
I turned to look at her and said, &quot;What's up, Lindsey?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Not much.  How are you?&quot; she said.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, I'm OK, I suppose.&quot;  I tried to make it seem like I was surprised she was talking to me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uuuuhhhhhh,&quot; she groaned.  &quot;I can't do this,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Joe, I need you,&quot; she said.  &quot;I don't know why but when I first saw you this morning something told me that I had to have you.  And it's driving me insane!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come here,&quot; I said and grabbed her roughly by the elbow.  I dragged her across the hall to the boys locker room.  It was empty because it wasn't time for gym periods yet.  I wished that no one would enter until after we had left.<br />
<br />
&quot;Joe, you're hurting me,&quot; she protested as I slung her up against the wall of the locker room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha!&quot; I said.  &quot;That wouldn't be any different from what you've done to any other person, now would it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, please,&quot; I scoffed at her.  &quot;You hurt people with your words, don't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Joe,&quot; she pleaded, &quot;I really don't have time for this.  I need your cock!&quot;  She grabbed at my pants, but I quickly backed away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,&quot; I said.  &quot;Calm yourself as best you can.  I know it's hard.&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked confused.  &quot;How do you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I made that happen,&quot; I said.  She didn't say anything.  The look on her face didn't change.  &quot;Friday night, your slumber party at Erika's.  I heard what you said.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you--&quot;  Before she could finish her thought I made myself and my clothes invisible.  &quot;Holy shit!&quot; she exclaimed.  I reappeared, as did my clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a special power,&quot; I told her.  &quot;Just take my word for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK,&quot; she said, stunned in place.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now as I was saying, I made you have this urge for me,&quot; I explained.  &quot;And so do all of your friends.  They just haven't gotten to me yet.&quot;  I saw her hand starting to slip under her skirt.  &quot;I wish you could resist doing anything sexual until I'm done explaining this to you.&quot;  She stopped and her hand returned to her side.  &quot;See how I have this power?&quot;  All she could do was nod.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are the first lucky 'victim,' shall I say?&quot; I continued.  &quot;The reason I did this was because of your comments about me and my friends.  Now, you never said anything about me.  Consequently, you're getting off, mmmm, 'relatively' easy.  But you're going to know what it feels like to be humiliated and embarassed.&quot;  The look on my face had turned stern, my voice softer and more threatening.<br />
<br />
&quot;How?&quot; she asked, still afraid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, actually, the people who will be in on the little joke are me, you, and your friends,&quot; I said.  &quot;Everyone else will think you're acting perfectly normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How will I not be acting normal?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
I paused for a moment, letting an aura of tension build.  &quot;Do you consider being naked 24/7 normal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; she asked, totally shocked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's your humiliation,&quot; I said.  &quot;And it's for your own good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How is that?&quot; she said, tears starting to form in her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have that urge for me,&quot; I said.  &quot;You can't deny it, nor can you control it.  So this will make it easier for me whenever you have to have sex with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
She started to calm down.  It appeared she knew how much she wanted and needed me.  &quot;Can we have sex now?&quot; she asked timidly.<br />
<br />
&quot;In a minute,&quot; I said.  &quot;I'm going to make it so that I can come and have sex with you anytime I want.  That way you can be kept under control.  I don't hate you, Lindsey, I don't want you to be in some kind of constant pain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you could like pull me out of class or something?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not going to do it all time time,&quot; I warned.  &quot;I also can't do it during a test or something like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll see where this goes.  But right now, strip,&quot; I said.  A look of happiness beamed over her face and she literally tore out of her clothes.  The thin blouse she wore was torn to shreds.  Not that she'd need it anymore.  Her bra was given the same treatment.  I wished my own clothes off while she took off her pants and thong.<br />
<br />
I grabbed her again and took her into the shower, admiring the way her breasts bounced as she moved.  I turned on the shower water and we did it in the locker room.  I entered her from the front, pinning her up against the wall of the stall.  She came within a matter of minutes.<br />
<br />
I turned the water off and wished we were both dry.  &quot;Can we do it again?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not right now,&quot; I said.  &quot;I'll make it so you can go at least 4 hours in between before the urge starts to hit you again.  That way you can function better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK,&quot; she said.  I made the wish.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now for the rest,&quot; I said.  &quot;I wish you could be naked all the time without anyone thinking it was wrong.  As such I wish you would never get in trouble for being naked.  I wish everyone would think you being naked was perfectly normal for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't feel any different,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not going to affect you like that,&quot; I said.  &quot;Hmm.  We have to make a few other changes.  I wish you would never feel hot or cold since you're always naked.  I wish you would always feel normal.  I wish that nothing could hurt your feet, if you were to step on something on the ground.  I'll have to remember to do that for the others too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds right,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Finally, I wish that I would be able to pull you out of any class, no matter what the teacher might think, at any time during the school day,&quot; I said.  &quot;That should take care of that,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
We walked back outside the shower room and into the regular locker room.  I wished my clothes back on.  I wished that the scraps of her clothes would disappear.  As I made that last wish I was curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm going to try something,&quot; I said.  &quot;I wish that your clothes were on you again, the way the were before you took them off.&quot;  <br />
<br />
They reappeared and immediately she started to tug at them.  &quot;Ewww, get them off,&quot; she said.  &quot;I don't feel right,&quot; she complained.  Then she started to hyperventilate, so I quickly wished her naked again.  She instantly breathed a sigh of relief.<br />
<br />
&quot;That answers that question,&quot; I said.  &quot;I won't do that again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please don't,&quot; she said.  &quot;I like it better this way.  Now I can just shove my tits in their face and they won't even think it's strange.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So long as you don't let them do anything to you,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you kidding?&quot; she asked.  &quot;I won't be giving it up for anyone but you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; I said.  &quot;Now run along back to class.  If by some chance someone notices you're naked, just come running to find me.  Oh, here we go.  I wish that if someone says you're naked, you'll run straight to where I am so we can fix it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK,&quot; she said, giving me a kiss.  &quot;I'll see you later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you don't see me by the end of the day,&quot; I warned.  &quot;Just go to Erika's house.  Trust me.&quot;<br />
<br />
She ran out of the locker room, her bare ass bounding away.  Her bare everything actually.  This was going to be fun, I thought.</p>
