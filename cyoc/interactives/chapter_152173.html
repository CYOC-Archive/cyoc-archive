<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A couple of days later the family of five was invited by Brian&#39;s coworker and friend Fred into a restaurant. Thanks to the changed reality Fred thought that Brian had helped him with a bigger project for the last weeks, them having finished it just before Tommy had changed Brian into his father. The only other person present in their group was Fred&#39;s partner Colin. It was common knowledge in the company that Fred was gay and nobody there had a problem with it. They planned to get official engaged in the summer.<br />
The evening at the restaurant was good, they all had fun until a group of three friends entered the restaurant around eight thirty. The had sat down on the table next to them, chatting about school and badmouthed almost everything. The food wasn´t as good as they wanted, the younger children were to loud, despite that they themselves were louder, and so on. That put a damper on the mood of Tommy and the others. But when Fred gave Colin a short kiss before heading to the bathroom, the trio started insulting the gay couple badly.<br />
Tommy had thought about using his laptop to make them a bit friendlier before, but now he had enough of them. He excused himself for a minute to check something on his laptop and moved outside with it. He scanned the trio and decided how to punish them. Seeing that all three were quiet similar to each other Tommy found something. At least one of them would fulfill the dream of Fred and Colin and become their adoptive son, but with a much better behavior. He would only need to decide who. When he finally decided on the oldest of the three, Alex, he used the chronivac to let him come out to him while writing down the changes.<br />
When Alex reached the bench Tommy was sitting on, he hit enter. Before his eyes Alex started to shrink down, regressing from being twenty-one to a three year old in half a minute. He knocked Alex consciousness back into a mere passenger in his own body, creating a well behaved and intelligent mind for the body that loved his parents and was Dany&#39;s best friend. With his clothes adjusted Alex new mind regained control over the body, looking at Tommy in a bit of confusion.<br />
“Do you want something from me, Alex?” Tommy asked friendly. “No, I just couldn´t stand that mean man there any longer. Is it okay if I stay with you for a bit?” Tommy nodded, inwardly grinning. On the laptop he could read how the older Alex was cursing badly, not really understanding what happened to him and how his body could call his friends mean.<br />
<br />
Tommy then let the other two man, Josh and Patrick, both twenty, pay their food before they started to come outside. He froze Alex again, not wanting the new mind to witness his plans for the two men, but also letting the old Alex see what happened to his friends.<br />
When they walked past the bench Tommy let them stop in their tracks. He then started their change process. First both started to remove their clothes, turning them red in embarrassment. Each piece of clothes that they removed and let go off after that vanished into thin air, much to their confusion. <br />
Finally naked they turned towards each other, growing erect against their protests of not being gay towards each other. Patrick, being the shorter one of them then moved towards Josh, who changed his stand, spreading his legs apart. Much to both men&#39;s horror Patrick slipped his legs between Josh&#39;s open stance before thrusting upwards, sinking his cock deep into Josh&#39;s butt. At the same time he took Josh&#39;s own cock into his mouth and started sucking on it.<br />
Hanging there Patrick&#39;s legs crossed behind Josh&#39;s back while his hands grabbed his own ass around Josh&#39;s legs. His legs then bend unnatural just about their cross-point until his feet were beside his head again, letting it seem as if his bones were not there. Then they fused together and also with his ears while his hands merged into his ass, locking him in place. After that he started shrinking in size while turning into white, tight, cotton boxers around Josh&#39;s lower body. But both Patrick&#39;s mouth and cock stayed intact inside his changed body, sucking on Josh while also fucking him. <br />
Josh himself started to change only slightly. He changed his stance into that of a posing Greek athlete when Patrick had grown thinner. His features slowly washed away, together with his skin color. It wasn´t long before instead of a young man there was only a white marble statue wearing nothing but a pair of boxers that also had turned into marble on the outside. <br />
“You will never again badmouth someone who is gay. You will be transported to a near museum and remain there forever as a statue of an Greek athlete. Feeling the boxers cock inside you and the mouth sucking on you. You will remain conscious inside, feeling both incredible horny, but unable to cum because of your changed, marble bodies. Your friend here will be the adoptive son of my friends, the gay couple you insulted before. But while his body remained in flesh he will have no control over it. But because I want that all three of you experience each side your consciousness will rotate from time to time. But you will be isolated, trapped in your own mind, I won´t connect you to talk mentally.”<br />
With that explained Tommy hit enter and the statue vanished. He hit enter a second time and Alex young mind returned to conscious. Nobody would remember the three young men and young Alex would be adopted from his family that mistreated his older brother and were now imprisoned, but he had no real memory of them, freely accepting his new parents.<br />
Tommy and Alex joined the group inside again, enjoying the rest of the evening.</p>
