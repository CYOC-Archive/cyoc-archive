<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Each step that Toby made he found himself thinking more and more about the loincloth. Why did it give him a feeling of confidence? Of athleticism? <br />
<br />
The more he thought, the more he started to believe that what he had in his backpack was like a gift, it was something special. He didn&#39;t know what it was, or where it came from, he just couldn&#39;t shake the thought that it meant something special.<br />
<br />
He turned backpack to the front of him and unzipped the pack. Sitting there on top was the loincloth. It looked soft, delicate, but when he touched it again a rush of confidence and endurance swept through him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck!&quot; Toby shouted. Careful to look around and see no one else could hear him in the forest. Toby looked back down at the loincloth. It sparked across the cloth and up onto his hand a gold electric shock. <br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit!&quot; Toby whispered. <br />
<br />
Toby grabbed the loincloth and dropped his backpack. It was a warm morning and his school was still about a half mile away. He started to get a most unusual thought into his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;If this thing is making me feel this great just by holding it, what would it feel like if I put it on?&quot; he asked himself.<br />
<br />
Toby looked around the forest again. No signs of anyone nearby. No sounds of footsteps in the distance.<br />
<br />
&quot;I better not regret this,&quot; his better half told himself, convincing himself that he shouldn&#39;t wait to try on the loincloth at a later time, and he needed to do it right then in the middle of the forest.<br />
<br />
Toby quickly pulled off his t-shirt and kicked off his shoes. The leaves immediately started sticking to his socks and becoming wet from the morning dew. &quot;What am I doing, what am I doing?&quot; Toby asked himself as he quickly pulled off and then tied together his socks. Standing now only in his jeans and underwear, Toby folded his tshirt and set them carefully over his shoes, and then set his socks on right over the shirt. He then unbuckled his jeans and also carefully folded them and setting them on top of his pile of clothing, making sure they didn&#39;t get mud-stained by the forest floor.<br />
<br />
Toby briefly examined his body and flexed his arms. &quot;I am a fucking dope,&quot; he thought to himself. &quot;I don&#39;t deserve to be on the football team, look at me! What a piece of shit!&quot; His body was skinny and though he had some defined muscle muscle, he had no bulk, and nothing of the sort compared to his jock friends, those who could run faster, throw the ball harder, kick better.<br />
<br />
Toby unfurled the loincloth and took another look at it. As he did, he saw another gold spark emanate out of the cloth and onto his right arm. &quot;What the fuck!&quot; he whispered, looking at his hand as it slowly started to grow and bulk, his fingers becoming thicker. Then, his hand started growing some small, brown hairs up to his wrist and lightly onto his forearm. He didn&#39;t have any body hair save for his loins and a thin covering on his legs, and this was something totally new to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What does this do?&quot; he asked himself. &quot;Fuck me, I gotta try it now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Gripping tightly the loincloth, Toby pushed down his boxers and kicked them off of his feet. He tossed it on top of his clothes pile. No time to set them neatly, now that he was naked. He looked around once more and again found himself alone. <br />
<br />
Toby quickly unfurled the loincloth and stepped his left, then his right foot into the holes. Immediately he started feeling more strength and endurance enter his legs. A warmth started moving up them and up through his body. &quot;Holy fuck this feels good&quot; Toby whispered. He started to pull them up and notice the loincloth change from an old, raggedy, dirty limp thing into a tan, poised, clean, and fresh loincloth with each inch going up his body.<br />
<br />
When the endurance his his cock and balls, he immediately felt stimulated. &quot;Oh fuck yeah,&quot; he whispered, convincing himself that this was a good idea and he needed to keep going. As it went up over his knees, more gold sparks of electricity started to swirl off the cloth and onto his body, Toby&#39;s eyes opening ever wider as he became mesmerized by the forces that were encircling his legs and his loins. His dick started filling with blood as it too rose, but Toby paid it no mind, he needed to know what would happen if he wore the loincloth, what would become of him, what he would transform into.<br />
<br />
The cloth started to tighten around his thighs and up onto his loins as he pulled it up. It was forming to his body. &quot;Oh fuck Yeah!&quot; he shouted as he lifted it over his butt and snapped it onto his now hard cock, locking it under the cloth. The moment he did, Toby snapped his upward and screamed, &quot;ARRRGGGGGHHHHH!&quot; he shouted as the maelstrom of power that was encircling the loincloth spread out and onto his body. A tornado of gold electricity and sandy smoke like nova began encircling him as the powers of the loincloth woke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;FUCK YEAH!&quot; He shouted as his body began to levitate, the maelstrom picking up speed and aggression as it forced his body 5 then 10 feet up into the air, the powers encircling him with ever greater force as he opened his mind and body to accepting it all.<br />
<br />
His thighs felt it first, they exploded with muscle, ever-increasing slabs of power growing outward like highly-refined footballs, veins poking out and snaking downward to his thighs and shins, light tanned brown hair growing like a forest over his legs. They pushed downward with increasing length, growing his stature from his measly 5&#39;7 upward.<br />
<br />
The powers then started to grow up from the loincloth, first bulking out his ass from flat and straight into a rock hard bubble, pushing outward and upward as the loincloth gave into the ever-increasing muscle mass. the glutes pulled upward to accommodate for new muscle building in his backside as his back began stretching upward and outward in strength and height. &quot;OH more! I NEED MORE!&quot; Toby shouted as his abs began crunching and realigning themselves. They pulled upward as 4, then 6, then 8 distinct rivets formed over his front side, and as his quads pulled up into his Adonis, creating a deep and revealing V. <br />
<br />
It was then this dick started growing, not an erection, but in sheer size. It pushed like a sausage hard against the cloth and he saw its outline protrude far and wide as it folded over his testicles. They too started dropping with extreme size, pushing his entire package outward as a new feeling of sexual virility overcame him. &quot;OH!&quot; Toby shouted, cupping his package as he felt it push ever harder against the cloth. &quot;Oh this is too much!&quot; He whispered, &quot;what a fucking gift! WHAT IS HAPPENING TO ME!&quot; he shouted in pure ecstasy. <br />
<br />
Toby moved his hand up across his left Adonis as he noticed the strength and power of the loincloth causing his forearms to bulk along with his biceps, ever-increasing rolls of muscle growing over his body as his shoulders started bulking upward, matching his expanding neck.<br />
<br />
His skin started turning into a golden tan as a treasure trail of dark brown hair sprouted from his pubic region up to his belly button, followed by a thin, evenly covered region over his flattening and pulsating pecs, stretching lengthwise to match his ever-growing shoulders. <br />
<br />
&quot;ARGH, OH FUCK YES GIVE ME MORE!&quot; Toby shouted as he felt stubble grow over his face and his hair turn golden brown. Toby stretched out his arms and admired the changes his body was encountering. He was becoming stronger, more beautiful, and better than he had ever known before. His proportions were in his eyes perfect, his body was a specimen to behold. <br />
<br />
He kept floating higher and higher now at the top of the treeline before he noticed that the loincloth was giving him more than the body of a god. No, he was gaining powers. &quot;Holy shit!&quot; he shouted as the electric bolts that had just turned his body into of the most perfect specimens now elevated him above mortality and humanity itself.<br />
<br />
Each spark of the gold electricity buried into his muscle-studded orifices, integrating into his flesh at the subatomic level before exploding them into pure containers of immortal power. <br />
<br />
Toby could feel his mind opening to the new powers he was gaining: the power to possess, to transform, to mold the will every creature to any purpose, or to any calling that he wanted. His mind opened up as his body gained true immortality, feeling his control over all matter existing in the plane that he was present, realizing that he held the very ability to shift physics and reality to his own will. Toby stretched out his body and let the powers of the loincloth completely own him, completely take him over. “Yes, I can feel it! MORE!! MOOOORERREEE!!! HAHAHAHAHA!!!”<br />
<br />
Toby&#39;s mind became flooded with the knowledge of an ancient god, transcending above mortality. He could feel that the cyclone of power surrounding him existed solely to funnel this power into his body, transforming him from the inside out. With another flash of power from the maelstrom, his flesh integrated into the powers and became only an illusion, only a human in perception, a way for him to exist on this plane. Toby felt his very being become unbound from the confines of humanity, and with it increases his own selfish and lustful desires.<br />
<br />
His body then straight exploded into becoming one with the powers that were surrounding him. A supernova, bright with cracking tan and white light formed through him, merging himself with the existence of the netherworld, that of the plane of the ancient gods as a wave of pure energy bridging from the netherworld into Toby, now one with the powers that had surrounded him. He formed into a new humanoid form of smoke and electricity now 100, then 200, then 1000 feet in the air as he saw his town around him.<br />
<br />
He realized he had phased out of the existence of the mortal plane, the mortals around him did not notice that a new god had been birthed right in their town. Toby was now so pent up with energy and power that he screamed with lust and excitement: &quot;AAAARRRGGGGGHHHH!&quot; he said as he flew at the speed of light off of earth and into space. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am a GOD!&quot;</p>
