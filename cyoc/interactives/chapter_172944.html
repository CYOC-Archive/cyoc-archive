<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Being plugged in never got old. It was not like being fucked where eventually friction, overstimulation, or just being exhausted would diminish the pleasure. The power surged into his asshole continuously, but Matt was still bored. Every time a customer would wander past him he would have a little entertainment and feel some of the same embarrassment at standing naked, hand on cock with the same &quot;O&quot; face he&#39;d had when he had been masturbating months ago. It was not exactly rare to see someone, but did not actually change anything so most of the time he was bored.<br />
<br />
Matt had eventually figured out how to create simple text files and at that point started keeping track of the days passing as well as writing other things to stave off some of the boredom. On day 72 after he started his robot diary a man stopped to stare intensely at Matt. Matt stared back because he could not do anything else with his eyes fixed at the same point in front of him. The man had a shaved head and a short beard. There had been other intense looks before and Matt would not have thought anything of this customer in particular if he had not returned. This time he bothered to notice that Mr shaved head was dressed in a plain black tee shirt, black jeans, and at the edge of Matt&#39;s field of vision he could just make out the tops shiny leather boots.<br />
<br />
&quot;So he wanted to be a sex toy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt was really annoyed when the assistant replied, &quot;Oh yes, he selected all his features and turned himself into this sexbot.&quot; Matt really wanted to contradict this sales pitch. He wanted to argue that it was just supposed to be to try out, not a permanent lifestyle. He had a list of objections that he had started 40 days ago when frustrated at his situation titled &#39;Reasons For Robot Revolution&#39;.<br />
<br />
The customer considered Matt for a little longer than then said, &quot;He is not exactly what I thought I was looking for, but he does look quite sexy. I&#39;ll take him.&quot;<br />
<br />
The assistant nodded and chuckled a little. &quot;Excellent choice. If you come with me we can discuss options for your new possession. Oh, and Unit #087,&quot; he said finally looking at Matt, &quot;head to engineering for reprogramming.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt did not even bother to make an attempt at objecting. He had satisfied himself that he was completely locked out of any self control 15 days ago. His body pulled itself from its plug with a soft pop and no input from him. It felt strange both to move at all and to have that movement be entirely outside his control like being a passenger in his own body. His new owner watched him as he walked by and then returned to talking with the clerk.<br />
<br />
Apparently whatever robot mode knew where engineering was because Matt found himself standing at attention next to a workstation for a few minutes. He felt someone slide open his neck covering and plug something into his USB port. Matt was really freaked out by this, was he about to get mind wiped? Please, not that, he didn&#39;t want to die.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just relax, I&#39;ve got to make a few adjustments to prepare you for your new owner. And look, this is going to happen no matter what, so if possible I&#39;d prefer it if we could do it quickly. Without you screaming at me. And to answer your next question, I&#39;ve got your thoughts as a readout on my computer here. So I&#39;d really prefer it if you didn&#39;t bitch and moan at me, I&#39;d like to just get this done so I can get back to listening to my podcast. Don&#39;t worry, by the way, your new owner did not ask to have you erased.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt wasn&#39;t particularly reassured by this guy&#39;s attitude but it was at least promising that he was not about to be deleted or something. This guy seemed like a jerk but he probably had the ability to make Matt&#39;s life hell so sure, he&#39;d stand here and take his reprogramming like a good robot if it&#39;d get him out of here.<br />
<br />
He felt a tingling sensation in his head as windows popped up in his line of sight, showing the programmer going through various files within his hard drive. The guy finally found a file he was looking for and set about editing it, though to what Matt wasn&#39;t sure as he was denied access to that privileged information. Once the guy was done Matt instantly felt what had changed. It was now written into his programming that Master Samuel was his owner.<br />
<br />
More tingling and a sensation like like being in a dream of speeding through a landscape. It was a rush of memories that confused Drone Unit 1. The thought of his designation really scared the unit. He still could could remember how he ended up as a robot on display, but he&#39;d lost some part of what had made him feel like a human in a robot body. It was angering and also weirdly fun. He was owned by some sort of kinky fetishist who could order him to do basically anything, and... alter his programming at will! Fuck.<br />
<br />
Drone Unit 1 was lost in thought until he felt the USB plug disconnect, he was now alone with his own mind again. Well, &#39;his&#39; mind - it had just been made perfectly clear to him how much ownership he had over himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, you&#39;re all ready now. Yeah, it&#39;s stupid but hey, your new owner is just the sort of customer we tend to attract at this place. The whole &#39;owning a sex bot&#39; thing isn&#39;t really my thing but hey, each to his own. And you&#39;re programed to enjoy it so at least what happens to you will be fun. Anyway, I&#39;ve gotta go so... have a nice life.&quot;<br />
<br />
The unit felt the man pat his shoulder. It was a cursory gesture, but Unit 1 was so starved for human contact after months and months on display that it felt incredibly intimate. Then he was alone again, waiting.<br />
<br />
He was left to nervously anticipate what would happen next for a few minutes before he detected footsteps again, then Master Samuel was standing before him, looking quite pleased.<br />
<br />
Drone Unit 1 did not enjoy the lustful smile on his face given the circumstances. &#39;At least one of us is enjoying himself&#39;, he thought as he was forced to stand naked in front of his new owner.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;m going to have a lot of fun with you and you&#39;ll love it too. I know just what to do with you first...”</p>
