<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>In order for the story to make sense (parties, drinking, more muscle mass) Zack is now 18 years old </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Maddie was worried, this has never happened before. After spending a week in her son&#39;s body, and the incident that happened with her husband earlier, she felt like Zack&#39;s punishment was enough. She enjoyed being in her son&#39;s young lean body, but she missed her own body more. She had to find a way to transform back.<br />
<br />
Zack was panicking, he didn&#39;t know how to take this anymore. He spent a week trapped in his own body, and even worse his mom was in control of that body. At least Maddie had some respect when possessing his body, compared to his sister that would walk around the house naked and masturbate until his dick was sore. Still, he had his dislikes with what his mother chose to do with his body, or to wear. His mother would always masturbate in the morning, he still remembers the first day when she said &#39;Taking care of your morning wood is part of being a healthy man&#39; ; however Maddie had her own reasons for doing it: it made Zack&#39;s body less horny. For Zack it always felt akward to wake up, and cum, knowing that he had no say in that. Maddie would follow the morning events with a morning shower, saying that &#39;Keeping your body clean should be a priority, especially for a growing man like yourself&#39;. Zack agreed, but he was always annoyed at how long Maddie took to soap up his muscles and wash his body, after all he wasn&#39;t a toy to be played with. Even worse, she would pick clothes that showed off his muscular body, saying that she did that to build up his confidence. She would also wear briefs, even around the house, which Zack hated (his usual choice would be a comfy pair of trunks, and at least some shorts around house). But Maddie made sure Zack had a clean pair of white briefs ready for when she would posses him, she thought it kept his privates more secure. <br />
Zhack also felt embarrassed when Maddie would hang out with his friends. They had no clue about the family possession powers, so they thought that Zack was just behaving strange. However, during soccer practice Maddie was doing surprisingly well, thanks to the muscle memory of Zack&#39;s body. But Maddie forgot Zacks soccer uniform at home, so coach had to give him an old one that was a bit too tight around his pecs, butt and croch area. Right near the end of the practice match, Maddie got a bit excited due to the adrenaline rush and after a big jump Zack&#39;s pants ripped oppen, letting everyone see a nice view of his jiggling behind. Zack was mortified and screaming in his head, but luckly his teammates started laughing and complementing his physique, saying that no colothes stand a chance against that body. All that is to say he hated not being in control of his body. He knew Maddie did her best to not embarrass him, but it hurt watching watching her pretend to be Zack this week.<br />
<br />
Maddie still remember how embarrassing that practice was. She quickly hurried to the locker rooms to change, but she had to shower first. Zack was used to showering with his teammates, but for Maddie it was a new experience, but a man has to keep his body clean. She entered the shower room and noticed that most of the other boys had similar builts like Zack. No one paid attention while she was approaching an empty shower head. She eyed some of the more well endowed team members,  but none of the compared to the beast that was her husband. She started showering, and as always got a bit carried away when soaping up Zack&#39;s muscles. Blake, one of Zack&#39;s closest friends noticed and started laughing saying &#39;Thanks for the free show bro, but you better keep it for the ladies&#39;. Maddie was quickly brought back to reality, and Zack&#39;s/her face got red from embarrassment. She also had a closer look at Blake, a blonde guy, more muscular than her current body and with a bigger equipment too. She blushed and put a towel around Zacks waist to go back to the lockers to get changed. While getting her underwear on, she felt a towel snapp Zacks behind. She jumped, making Zacks butt jiggle once again. She looked back and saw Blake standing there naked with a big grin on his face.<br />
&#39;Common bro that was funny. By the way there&#39;s a pool party this weekend, you in? Everyone is talking about it, you might even get lucky and get that small dick of yours wet for one of the cheerleaders. I saw you feeling yourself up in the showers, you must be really horny.&#39; <br />
<br />
&#39;Party? oh yeah, definitely, just gotta check in with my parents first. They&#39;ve been out for blood since I forgot to do my house chores, but I think they&#39;ll let me go. After all I deserve a break&#39; said Maddie thinking that will be something that Zack can look forward to after his punishment (she also felt guilty about what he did with Jeffrey the other night). <br />
&#39;Great, see you there bro!&#39; said Blake while putting a pair of blue briefs on.<br />
<br />
~~~Back to the present~~~<br />
<br />
&#39;Sorry Zack, I have no idea why I can&#39;t leave your body&#39; said Maddie with a disappointed look on Zack&#39;s face. Zack was very unhappy and demanding his body beack, but noone could hear his begging.<br />
<br />
Maddie reached for Zacks phone to check the time and noticed a bunch of missed texts from Blake, asking him if he&#39;s ready for the pool party. Maddie came to the realization that it&#39;s Saturday, the day of the most expected event on campus, the pool party. &#39;I&#39;m so sorry son, I really wanted give you back your body to go to this party, your punishment has truly been enough&#39;. Maddie realized that she can&#39;t make an excuse for Blake, Zack was already acting strange all week if he cancelled last minute on the pool party it could really affect Zack&#39;s friendships. &#39;Zack, I think I might have to go to this pool party, we wouldn&#39;t want anyone to be suspicious.&#39; Zack was pleading in his mind &#39;No, please No! Just say that you got grounded, or that you are feeling sick! Please don&#39;t go!&#39; but he knew noone could hear him. His mother tried to reach Zack, let him speak in her mind, but for some reason her powers have been acting strange lately. She took the phone and sent a quick reply to Blake &#39;I can&#39;t wait bro, this is gonna be EPIC!&#39;.<br />
<br />
&#39;Ok Zack you know the drill. A man should have a clean body!&#39; said Maddie out loud with her son&#39;s voice as she got out of bed, stretching Zack&#39;s young muscles. She went to take a shower, taking extra care in cleaning her son&#39;s muscles, as usual. She stood in Zacks room, with a towel wrapped around his waist. &#39;Hmm, let&#39;s see what to wear to the party&#39;. She searched Zack&#39;s closet for any bath suits, and she found a pair of red swimming shorts that Zack usually wore to the beach. She took off his towel and tried the swimming shorts, spinning in the mirror to check her behind. &#39;Sorry son, but these feel a bit loose, I can feel your dick dangling in between your legs and you know how much I hate that&#39;. She took them off, standing naked in his room. She looked more, and in the back of Zack&#39;s closet she found a pair of green speedos that Zack used for a swimming competition a few years ago before he started playing soccer. &#39;These might work, I&#39;m sure they are more secure, even if a bit on the small side.&#39; Zack was crying in his own head, knowing how embarrassing those small green speedos will look on him.<br />
Maddie put the speedo on &#39;Much better, now your privates won&#39;t be dangling all over the place!&#39;. She then put on a pair of slim jeans and a muscle t-shirt, knowing how to make Zack&#39;s assets shine. She went downstairs to have some quick lunch, Jeffrey being already there. <br />
<br />
Jeffrey noticed Zack&#39;s reavealing clothes, knowing that he would never pick those unless he was possessed: &#39;Hi sweety, I thought Zack&#39;s punishment was due to end today?&#39;. &#39;There&#39;s something wrong with my power, I tried to exit Zack but I&#39;m stuck. Now I have to go to a pool party with his friends so they won&#39;t get suspicious. It took me forever to find a comfortable pair of swimwear&#39;. Jeffrey laughed, knowing his wife&#39;s opinion of &quot;dangling male parts&quot;. <br />
After lunch, Jeffrey took Zack to the pool party. <br />
&#39;Have fun baby, call me when you are ready to go home&#39;. <br />
&#39;Will do&#39; said Maddie approaching for a kiss, before remembering that she&#39;s in the wrong body.<br />
<br />
She went into the house, one of the Zack&#39;s soccer teamates owned, and reached for the door. Blake opened the door, wearing a pair of short denim pants and an unbuttoned Hawaiian shirt.<br />
&#39;Finally reacher the party bro.. what took you so long!?&#39; said Blake with a dumb smile.<br />
&#39;Sorry, took me some time to find my swimming gear. I&#39;m here so let&#39;s go to that pool!&#39; <br />
Blake took me to the back garden, where the pool was. Maddie took notice of all the people there, some drinking what she suspected to be alcohol. Blake went to a table and took 2 cups, handing one over to Zack. &#39;What&#39;s this?&#39; asked Maddie confused.<br />
&#39;Just some vodka and cranberry juice, don&#39;t worry it&#39;s not very strong&#39; said Blake who looked like he had some already. <br />
<br />
Maddie knew that she would have to drink that in order to not raise suspicion, but she planned to have a serious talk with Zack about safe alcohol drinking after all of this is over.<br />
<br />
&#39;Let&#39;s go, get changed and go in the pool. It&#39;s what we&#39;re here for after all!&#39; said Blake pointing to the empty bathroom. Maddie went ahead and took of all of her clothes, adjusting Zack&#39;s penis in the small speedo. Zack&#39;s body was lean, muscular, with strong calves and an amazing ass due to all the years of soccer practice. She could have an enormous dick by possessing her husband, but nothing compares to the feeling of being young and agile. Maybe that time she took over Jeremy, Zack&#39;s 20 year old cousin who&#39;s a wrestling champion, now that was an agile young man with a big sausage. She started flexing Zack&#39;s body in the mirror, enjoying the view before she heard a knock from Blake saying that he&#39;s done changing. Meanwhile, Zack was tring to zone out, ignore the reality he was stuck in. But nothing worked, he was forced to see and feel everything his body was doing, out of his control.<br />
<br />
As Maddie exited the bathroom, she noticed Blake standing there in a blue pair of speedo. She was happy that someone else understood her feeling about security of the male equipment. Also, she didn&#39;t want to admit it, but she felt a small movement in Zack&#39;s privates, she was catching feelings for Blake. Blake similarly to Zack, was well built due to years of practicing sports, but while Zack was lean, Blake was more muscular. Maddie remembered that Blake was the first one to go to the gym out of Zack&#39;s friend group, he was the leder of the pack, the alpha everyone was following. <br />
<br />
&#39;Yoo bro, I didn&#39;t know you&#39;d also be wearing a speedo!&#39; said Blake as he was cupping and tugging on his own privates.  <br />
&#39;What can I say, I like giving the ladies something to look at&#39; said Maddie with a grin on Zack&#39;s face.<br />
&#39;Damm right, you&#39;re a total snack&#39; said Blake as he was liking his lips. &#39;Let&#39;s go in the pool&#39;. Maddie nodded, not overthinking what Blake just said. <br />
<br />
Maddie was having a lot of fun, everyone was staring in appreciation at Zack&#39;s body, girls and boys alike, and she felt intoxicated from the confidence. Or it might have been the booze. She was having fun and that&#39;s what matters. The alcohol was also affecting Zack, he started feeling dizzy in his own head, and finally relaxed a bit, until he saw his mom approach Blake. <br />
&#39;Hey there! Thanks for inviting me, this was awesome!&#39; said maddie as he was scratching Zack&#39;s abs. <br />
&#39;No problem bro, this party would have been dead boring without you! The ladies will dream of this for months&#39;. said blake as he was bouncing his pecs for dramatic effect. <br />
There it was again, the slight movement in <br />
Zacks privates. Was Zack gay, or was Maddie crushing over Zacks friend. She noticed she was staring at Blake&#39;s bulge. <br />
&#39;Like what you see?&#39; asked Blake with as he was cupping and tugging at his privates. &#39;I can&#39;t complain about the view either&#39;.<br />
He approached Zack for a kiss, and Maddie could feel her small friend wake up in the small green speedo. She was too horny to think about crossing boundaries so she started kissing Blake. <br />
&#39;I&#39;ve been dreaming about this for so long&#39; said Blake in between breaths. <br />
Zack new that Blake had a crush on him, and maybe he had some feelings for Blake, but he wasn&#39;t ready to admit it. But now he was screaming, his mom took away his chance to process those feelings. She might have ruined one of the best friendships he&#39;s ever had. But as Maddie was looking at Blake&#39;s bulge in his blue speedo, Zack didn&#39;t have a choice but do the same. However, a buzzing feeling from his privates moved towards his brain. Maddie felt that too, she was way to familiar with the tangling feeling of possession, meaning that Zack was finally awakening his powers. He thought that maybe the reason why she couldn&#39;t leave his body was exactly this, Zack has finally awakened his power, and Blake was right there for the taking, a body that could have rivaled Jeremy&#39;s.</p>
