<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She saw her skin start to lose its color all across her body, before becoming shiny. As it hardened, some of Kate&#39;s features changed. Her arms and legs slimmed down, and her waist shrank down a couple inches. Her breasts became one solid mass on her chest, giving the impression of them, but without actually being. As that happened, her nipples disappeared. Beneath her white underwear, her vagina smoothed over. She felt a tightness in her butt, as it became one mass, but still retaining a small valley between her butt cheeks.<br />
<br />
Kate&#39;s face also changed some. It became more rounded, and softer. Her nose shrank a little, and her nostrils sealed off before disappearing altogether. Kate felt herself breath out before her lips curled up into a smile, and sealed shut. It was then that she stopped needing to breath. Her eyes became glass doll-eyes becoming darker. Her lower eyelashes changed to match her upper ones, curling downwards an unnatural amount.<br />
<br />
Her skin had finally hardened into porcelain, and Kate found that she couldn&#39;t move. She started panicking, wondering if she was given the wrong pill. Then, she realized that she was going to be a true doll, one that didn&#39;t move. That calmed her down, and aroused her some. She knew that she was given the wrong pill when she started shrinking. <br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t care though. She froze in a cute pose, her legs together, and her hands crossed over the front of her skirt. Soon, she was only 6 inches tall, which was a whole foot shorter than she had originally wanted. However, she was okay with that. At this height, and in this pose, she felt and looked like a real doll. A heat started welling up inside of her, and spread all the way to her fingertips. <br />
<br />
The door opened, and Professor Juniper walked in. She towered over Kate as she stepped in. <br />
<br />
&quot;Kate? Kate, where are you?&quot; She called out. She closed the door, and saw her standing in front of the mirror, &quot;Oh no.&quot;<br />
<br />
She picked Kate up, which made the heat intensify. She looked Kate over, and sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like they mixed up my order form...&quot; Professor Juniper sounded angry, &quot;Well, I guess you aren&#39;t too unhappy. After all, you didn&#39;t completely rule out being inanimate.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kate&#39;s mind was getting foggy, and she found it increasingly harder and harder to think straight. She realized that she had been given a pill that would alter her mind. Surprisingly, she wasn&#39;t panicked, and felt very calmed and relaxed by Professor Juniper&#39;s touch. It was very comforting to be held.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I guess we could put you up for sale like all the other inanimate dolls,&quot; Professor Juniper sounded unsure, &quot;I mean, it&#39;s not like we have any use for you, and you can&#39;t move on your own.&quot;<br />
<br />
Being sold seemed like it wouldn&#39;t be too bad. The thought of being sold as a doll aroused Kate even further, and the heat intensified some more. She forgot a part of her life before her transformation. Professor Juniper took Kate out of the room. Her stride was quick as she took Kate over to the doll shop. Kate didn&#39;t know that this was a part of the facility. She was brought over to a cashier lady, who was a large-breasted cat-girl, and put down on the counter. She rocked back and forth before the cashier lady stabilized her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Brenda. A doll transformation pill got messed up again.&quot; Professor Juniper was sounding frantic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Again? Juniper, this is the third time.&quot; She remarked. Juniper looked down at Kate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, regardless, I have her for you to sell.&quot; Professor Juniper said. Brenda looked down at Kate, and picked her up.<br />
<br />
&quot;She certainly is beautiful, though,&quot; Brenda commented on Kate&#39;s appearance. This made the heat inside of Kate intensify even more, on top of being held and examined, &quot;Alright, I&#39;ll put her up for sale.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Brenda.&quot; Professor Juniper said before leaving. Brenda looked down at Kate, who had forgotten most of her human life.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;re really enjoying this, aren&#39;t you,&quot; She remarked, taking you over to a shelf with other dolls on it, &quot;You&#39;ll sell very quickly, you pretty little doll.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kate was in pure ecstasy right now. By now, she only remembered her human life up to a few hours before she transformed.<br />
<br />
An hour later, an elderly woman came by, and after conversing with Brenda some, she came over to Kate. The woman picked Kate up, and looked her over. This made Kate forget her entire life before her transformation. She forgot that she was ever once human, that she could once move and talk, and that she hadn&#39;t always been a 6-inch tall porcelain doll.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my, aren&#39;t you just adorable.&quot; The old lady complimented Kate as she turned her around in her hands. Kate soon forgot her own name, forgetting she even had one. She was now in that state of pure orgasmic bliss that Professor Juniper told her about, and she loved it.<br />
<br />
The old lady bought her, and took her home. She set Kate up on her fireplace, where she remained. Kate loved being a doll. All that she had to do was stay there and be pretty.</p>
