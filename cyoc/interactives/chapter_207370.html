<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Wendell was impatiently waiting for the puberthere he ordered from a guy on ebay. Since he heard about it in a subreddit where people share their kinky transformation fantasies, he had looked through all internet for an opportunity to put his hands on one of those miraculous devices.<br />
<br />
Despite he&#39;s only 15 years old, Wendell had managed to collect some hefty savings, he was expecting to use them to buy one of those expensive furry suits, but now the puberthere was way more appealing to him. He barely had enough money to buy the device but he was determined to get it, even though he&#39;ll be bankrupt after that.<br />
<br />
He was watching a movie with his 9 years old little brother, Anthony, when he heard the doorbell. He didn&#39;t want his brother to find out about his little gadget, so he didn&#39;t stopped the movie to distract him and opened the door. A mailman gave him the package he was so anxious to get and left. Wendell immediately hid the small box in his backpack that he deliberately left in the living room that morning.<br />
<br />
While he kept watching the movie with his little brother, in his mind he was recapping his plan to use the puberthere without his family knowing. He had convinced his parents to go to a distant relative&#39;s wedding in another state which would keep them out for the whole weekend. And for Anthony, the kid is going to an sleepover at his best friend&#39;s house that&#39;s very convenient to Wendell&#39;s intentions. Even though they shared the bedroom, that weekend it would be only for Wendell, the whole house, in fact.<br />
<br />
He had even planned how old he want to be. He had read all the information he could find online, manuals, experience from other people and videos online. Of course, mostly it was useless data but Wendell felt confident enough to try. He was 15 years old, so he was planning of becoming 12 years older. His uncle Jerry was 27 and Wendell thought he was the coolest guy on earth, every story he heard from his uncle had increased his desire to be as big as him and get some of those experiences.<br />
<br />
Wendell knew he won&#39;t have money to spend that weekend, so he planned to do some indoor activities in this occasion and then do some more grown-up stuff in the next opportunity he gets. Of course, one of his biggest interests is to explore the body of a full grown man, especially down there. Like any other guy his age, he had masturbated several times. More frequently when he was reading those transformation stories that people publish in the web.<br />
<br />
That evening, his parents departure to the wedding, they gave Wendell some money for food and emergencies, it wasn&#39;t too much but it would be helpful if the occasion demands it. An hour later, he was taking his little brother to the sleepover which was only a few blocks away from his house, very convenient in case of an emergency or so. When he was sure that he was safely alone, he took the puberthere out of his backpack and placed it near to the bunker bed he used to share with Anthony.<br />
<br />
He took some of his dad&#39;s clothes that he likes most and some of his shoes too. He hesitated a for a moment before he took some of his dad&#39;s underwear, but he prefers to wear them than going commando. He still wasn&#39;t sure if those clothes will fit his mature body, specially his dad&#39;s shoes but he wasn&#39;t going to buy clothes until the next time.<br />
<br />
Then, he changed his clothes but instead of his usual pajamas he wore a wife beater and basketball shorts, to be more comfy during his sleep. He turned the puberthere on and soon after that he was deeply asleep.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Anthony was waiting for his friends&#39; arrival at the sleepover but him and his best friend got several calls from them cancelling their joining. Despite Anthony wanted to stay for the rest of the night, his best friend suggested him to reprogram their sleepover for the next weekend. His best friend&#39;s parents took Anthony back to his home until they saw him coming inside.<br />
<br />
It was late and Anthony was very sad and tired, so he immediately went to his bed, completely ignoring that Wendell had a puberthere activated in their room. He changed into his red pajamas and climbed to his body. He felt a little tingling in his body, but he was sleeping in no time while the puberthere keep working according to Wendell&#39;s plan.</p>
