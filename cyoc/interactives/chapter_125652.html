<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Both Isaac and the lust demon Azaviel readied their makeshift swords for battle, despite the odds of Isaac being the bigger opponent.<br />
However, the bigger they are, the bigger the target.<br />
Isaac probed the link he had to his soul piece within Ilvir for any clue, but he could feel his soul shard deep within none other than Azaviel. <br />
Had Ilvir been subsumed?<br />
It can’t be.<br />
“Yes… He gave himself to me, I subsumed him into me and now I am in full control. Ilvir is gone, and only I remain.” The demon controlling Ilvir’s body pompously gloated.<br />
This however set Isaac on fire. Literally.<br />
Purple flames ignite over his body, as Isaac stewed in anger. His granite body began to shake as if an earthquake rippled underneath.<br />
Azaviel however in his need for Isaac’s body lunged first, slamming the crystal blade against Isaac’s.<br />
It cracked upon impact, sending purple shards of crystals everywhere, however upon touching Isaac it grew inert and had gone grey instead.<br />
Isaac took note of this however. Azaviel’s crystals die off when it enters his aura disconnected from its main source of power. Direct contact seems to be key for him to spread to him instead. However, Ice and Vines along with Fur is his barrier from the crystal ever touching his Granite core.<br />
Smirking, which is unseen, Isaac parried another desperate blow from Azaviel, purple turning to grey as it fell. Azaviel’s crystal sword regenerated within seconds for each shard gone.<br />
“You… I need your body!” Again he lunged forwards and did an aerial slash towards Isaac. Parrying the blow, or should have been, the sword grazed his side, chunking off his barrier and slightly touching his core. Crystals grew there, however the slight touch was not enough as it grew inert again.<br />
The feint was familiar however. Soon Azaviel began to slice chunks of his body to pieces as he was lither than Isaac is. The paladin training he did was more suited from human weight and size. <br />
Azaviel however seemed to use Ilvir’s fighting style as well. The paladin training aided Azaviel to chunk more of Isaac’s material barrier.<br />
Grunting in slight pain at the failed parry, Isaac double backed which slightly helped him as it only gave a small room for a breather. The demon was relentless in its assault, using what it had against Isaac as its advantage.<br />
Isaac knew he couldn’t kill Ilvir. To do so would be a stain on his name as a Paladin. He had to do something however, and fast.<br />
Maybe Ilvir not having a body would be best for him, for now.<br />
As Azaviel made a leap, Isaac readied his form.<br />
And let go of his sword.<br />
Azaviel smirked in victory, sword plunging deep into Isaac. Purple crystals grew where the sword met and Isaac grunted in pain as it touched his core.<br />
His heart heard whispers to give in…<br />
“You’re-“<br />
“MINE” Isaac roared in defiance.<br />
A metal blade from his armor extended, stabbing cleanly through the heart of Azaviel, and his vines ripped open, immediately pulling in the form stuck to his chest.<br />
Azaviel roared in anger, as his form sunk into Isaac.<br />
But it isn’t over as Isaac doubled over in pain, as his eyes turned purple.<br />
He screamed in agony as Azaviel began to leak into his mind.<br />
<br />
_---<br />
<br />
“RAARGH!” Isaac roared in pain, clutching his head as purple crystalline growths began to overtake his body. His second set of arms flailed as it was overtaken by another mind. Veins of purple energy began to grow from his eyes, leaking and cracking his face as it went. <br />
“Give in!”<br />
“NO!”<br />
His tail betrayed him as it stabbed forwards, going deep into his hole. Its thorny form going in deep, stretching open his stone pucker wide and it kept going in deeper.<br />
“AGGH!” Isaac screamed in pleasure. His second set of arms also betrayed him as it began to pull on his dicks, sending waves of pleasure to his head. His resolve was failing and he knew it. Azaviel had begun to creep into his head, replacing Isaac with itself.<br />
But he couldn’t lose.<br />
Not now.<br />
The Halo of Purity began to emit light at a brighter intensity, trying to purge the corruption within.<br />
“Ahhaaha! You’re a fool for trying to defeat me!” Azaviel chuckled, which actually left his maw. “Now I am going to rule over this world with your body!”<br />
“THERES NO WAY IN MY LIFE YOU WILL EVER WIN!” Isaac roared.<br />
A fire lit within Isaac and what was of Azaviel was taken from him, merging with Isaac. Azaviel, losing a chunk of itself was stunned. It was the time needed by Isaac to win.<br />
He forced the mind that was Azaviel down, down to his crotch area.<br />
The tail slipped out of his rump and his second set of arms go limp as its control was reestablished.<br />
And Isaac forced Azaviel somewhere he knew he would live forever.<br />
His cock and balls.<br />
The essence of Ilvir was forcefully separated from Azaviel and was immediately secured by Isaac, absorbing it in and keeping it in stasis, while Azaviel was deep rooted into his genitalia, forcing it there for the time and forever.<br />
His dick began to mutate and change, its granite form growing crystalline growths and making it studded. It twitched once, and twice, and gone silent.<br />
Isaac howled in pleasure at his victory as he came hard, the demon seed of Azaviel spurting onto the cloud ground and seeding it. Azaviel was howling in pleasure in his mind, a link forcefully made by Isaac to suppress Azaviel to a state of eternal orgasm.<br />
“I… Won”</p>
