<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Breakfast wasn&#39;t much more then some fruit and nuts, all of which looked like it&#39;d been chopped up and collected from various gardens and various bushes that grew wild in the park or in people&#39;s backyards. Some of it came as a bit of a surprise to you and as you and Kaylee ate quietly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You expected our food to be scaled down to fairy size?&quot; Kaylee gave a laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; you said slowly, &quot;everything else seems to be... our clothes are fairy sized, the furniture is fairy sized... and you said a lot of things are controlled by fairy magic...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So naturally fairies would have magical gardens?&quot; Kaylee laughed, &quot;I&#39;m afraid not. We can grow gardens, but they aren&#39;t to scale with us... meaning when we grow strawberries, they&#39;re the same size as strawberries would be to a human. It means we don&#39;t have to eat too much, but it does commonly mean that we have to go looking for food.&quot;<br />
<br />
You only shrugged and continued to eat from a bright red cherry that Kaylee had produced from what looked like a wooden refrigerator, which like many other things in the tree that you&#39;d likely be living in for the rest of your life, magic seemed to be part of it. It was very juicy and you did your best not to make a mess of yourself. Though eating wasn&#39;t the main focus on your mind. That was still on both the training that you had coming and all the things that you&#39;d lose by being a fairy. Getting Kaylee back was great, but you worried about your family. You and Kaylee&#39;s family had both been distraught after Kaylee disappeared. Now your parents would surely go through the same thing when it figured that you&#39;d vanished somewhere. Kaylee saw the frown and worried look on your face and figured that out.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be okay, Ada,&quot; Kaylee answered, &quot;It will be... trust me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about my folks though?&quot; you asked back, &quot;I&#39;ll never see them again...&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee&#39;s optimism faded a little and you watched her sigh heavily.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s tough... we can&#39;t tell them what we are now... but it&#39;s not impossible to see them again,&quot; Kaylee answered, &quot;If you get good enough with your magic, you might be able to take human form... but that&#39;d only be a disguise and you&#39;d only create the image of a human female.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I don&#39;t have a sister,&quot; you answered.<br />
<br />
Kaylee slowly reached out over her table and gently touched your hands. You looked to see that she looked very concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you really want to go through with something along those lines, you&#39;d need to at least say that you&#39;d had a sex change operation... which might not be too bad... but they&#39;d need to accept an image of you that such a story would tell,&quot; Kaylee said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;That I&#39;m a... a... a transgendered fairy,&quot; you said softly, not knowing what to fully say and unable to avoid coming off as homophobic with the comment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s what you are now,&quot; Kaylee spoke, &quot;you&#39;re a fairy... the most beautiful one I know... the one that I love dearly... and as a fairy, you are female now, so technically we&#39;re both lesbians now.&quot;<br />
<br />
You didn&#39;t immediately answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you certainly didn&#39;t complain last night,&quot; Kaylee finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m not really complaining now,&quot; you told her, &quot;last night was magical and made me very happy, and so long as you&#39;re here, I&#39;ll love being a fairy.&quot; You gave her a weak smile. &quot;What I&#39;m worried about is finding some way to tell this to my folks without telling them all this and that they aren&#39;t heartbroken.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee rubbed your hands again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Once you&#39;ve mastered your magic, we&#39;ll figure out what to say,&quot; Kaylee told you, &quot;I promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
You were about to say something when there was a knock at the door. Both you and Kaylee turned to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;That must be your dresses,&quot; Kaylee commented, &quot;That was fast.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will they fit?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;They should, I sent them your measurements,&quot; Kaylee replied.<br />
<br />
The two of you made your way to the door where fairy tailor fluttered there on wings that seemed to sparkle with multicolored light. In her arms were several dresses made from what looked like rose petals, like the one you were presently wearing. There were a few of them were purple, like the one that Kaylee had gave you yesterday, but most were golden so that they matched your hair and wing color.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have an order of dresses for a Miss Kaylee and Miss Ada,&quot; the tailor announced.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Kaylee and this is Ada,&quot; Kaylee answered, &quot;Thank you for being so prompt with my order.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was my pleasure,&quot; the tailor replied and passed the dresses to Kaylee. <br />
<br />
She then held out one of the golden colored dresses to you. You took it and held it out in front of you. It seemed to almost twinkle in the light that floated through the tree home that all the fairies lived it, be it sunlight that came in from the roof opening into the branches, or from periodic crystals like the ones in Kaylee&#39;s bedroom. Despite looking like it was made of rose petals, it felt soft and comfortable, like the finest fabric in the human world.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s beautiful,&quot; you spoke and turned with it and began to flutter on your wings back toward the bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are you going, Ada?&quot; Kaylee asked after you.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to get changed,&quot; you answered back, &quot;I want to look my best for Theory One-Oh-One.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss Kaylee?&quot; you heard the tailor ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ada is like me, former human,&quot; Kaylee answered, &quot;And in fact was my former boyfriend. I&#39;m going to be helping her get used to being a fairy and train her with her magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I hope the two of you get back together as fairy-friends,&quot; the tailor answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have,&quot; Kaylee replied, &quot;how much do I owe you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ten bits.&quot;<br />
<br />
You could only hear the exchange as you went back into the bedroom and began to slip out of the dress you were presently wearing. It wasn&#39;t a bad dress, but it was dirty from the day before an you would be going out. You couldn&#39;t just go out in dirty clothes. Once you had the old dress off, you laid it carefully on the bed and put the new one on. Once the two inside petals automatically moved to form your underwear, you looked down at yourself and twirled around a bit. You might be a bit uneasy with being female and worried about what would happen with regard to your family learning of your disappearance, but that didn&#39;t mean you didn&#39;t want to be dirty.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look good, Ada,&quot; came Kaylee&#39;s voice with a bit of a chuckle.<br />
<br />
You looked to see that Kaylee had arrived to see that you had changed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; you answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on,&quot; Kaylee spoke, &quot;Our first lesson will cover some magic theory and to tour the various fairy rings that are in the park.&quot;</p>
