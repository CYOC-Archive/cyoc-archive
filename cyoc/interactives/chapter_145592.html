<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With the ending of the Animalia Spring Carnival and Comic Convention came the preparations for the most important event in Animalia. The 2019 International Animalia Convention. With this big announcement, everyone was getting into training for the sporting events. Adi was one of the more well known of the &quot;Animalian Champs-in-training&quot;, due to her spending two hours after breakfast jogging while carrying 5-pound dumbbells before the rest of her day. <br />
<br />
But that didn&#39;t mean that there was other things going on in the other parts of Animalia.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
One really surprising story came from Louisiana. Jill, Beauregard, and his nephew Bart were air boating in the bayou near their home when the throttle inevitably gotten stuck. Bart thought that it was a good idea to use the anchor to try to get the airboat to stop. It did work, but only because said anchor got caught in the wheel well of an armored car. In the spirit of &quot;April Fools&quot; Beauregard and Jill decided to find out who was ultimately responsible for the armored car in the swamp.<br />
<br />
While Jill and Bart alerted the authorities after moving the armored car closer to land, Beauregard stayed close by as a kind of &quot;sting&quot; operation. When two seventy-year-old men showed up to begin salvaging the car, Beauregard lunged at them as a kind of swamp monster. This act managed to scare the two old men right into police custody. When it was revealed what it was, the police (with television cameras and all) revealed what had happened, and gave them the chance to laugh at themselves.<br />
<br />
As it turned out, Jill, Beauregard and Bart had accidently debunked a part of the JFK assassination. During said assassination, the two guys (who were 20-year-olds at the time) decided to use the &quot;chaos&quot; that resulted to hijack an armored car from a New Orleans Armored Car Company headquarters and sunk it in the swamp. They had intended to wait until things had cooled off with time before looking at it, but couldn&#39;t find it. So they created a bayou punt business as a cover while they searched for it with metal tipped poles. <br />
<br />
Conspiracy theorists had originally pointed at the armored car theft as proof that there was more to the JFK assassination than what everyone thought. They had thought that the money had been taking to pay off certain people who were involved in the JFK assassination alongside Lee Harvey Oswald. While the government didn&#39;t officially connect the theft to the assassination, they &quot;left the option open&quot;, but with it&#39;s discovery, it was officially ruled out as being part of the JFK assassination in it&#39;s records.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Another, somewhat funny thing, was from Lyre/Animalia. The man who accurately predicted that the mystery thing wrapped in towels was a car and decided to test his luck at the casino when it was confirmed only managed to break even, which was more than some who do similar things can say.<br />
<br />
There was also some coverage of the new dance hall/club that was being built. The story was that it was eventually given the green light, on the condition that it had a zero-proof bar, mainly because there were plenty of places with alcohol in Las Vegas. But because of the speed that the Animalia Construction Company could build things, it was taking a lot less time than other construction companies would on a similar building.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
The biggest surprise was when a news crew came to Animalia to meet with some people. Dan was a little more understandable because he was the first Animalian with Polymelia, as well as the first Animalian with four arms. While there was a plan to find a frog with Polymelia next, the number of inappropriate comments on men having a &quot;third leg&quot; (which I won&#39;t put here) had them put that part of the project on hold for the time being.<br />
<br />
There was also an interview with Madame Matryoshka, the so-called &quot;grandmistress&quot; of Homosexual Anonymous. The interview helped dispel many myths about it being a means to deprogram homosexuals, and especially about it being a &quot;homosexual gulag&quot;. But there were still those who were sufficiently convinced of their delusions that they didn&#39;t see this. <br />
<br />
There was also an interview with the two most well known members of Homosexual Anonymous, Herman Oceanroar and Jason Clearwake. While most of it was either censored out by the news studio that was hosting the interview or removed by request of the PR-MD, there was enough touched on to answer the major questions. Herman and Jason had double-dosed each other as &quot;celebration&quot; of being confirmed as herpes-free, but discovered their awakening heterosexuality when drinking at the Meat Market, much to their chagrin. While at first greatly embarrassed at admitting this to each other, they were able to sign up for Homosexual Anonymous without too much stigma, from Animalia in general or each other. Currently, they were skyping with two hardcore lesbians who also had similar yet separate STDs who also wanted to be a great white shark and orca, respectively. They were already helping each other open up to their new heterosexuality, and finding potential bondmate material in each other. But that would also mean some interesting positions later once everyone was converted, but that wasn&#39;t reported.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
The funniest thing that was reported, especially on April Fools day, was the story from Australia that the politicians there were very surprised that all the aboriginal tribes in Australia now knew about Animalia, but also treated many of the converted/uplifted as living gods. Like those reporters who play with their pen on camera for forty-five minutes until realizing it after the fact, Australian politicians started doubling down on finishing the Australian Animalian Colony, especially since it was the world&#39;s first two-part colony. But when Australian reporters investigate how every single Aboriginal tribe now knew about Animalia, the result of their investigation left people feeling rather underwhelmed. The report was that they had apparently used smoke signals that only they could understand to spread the news. One post, which also happened to be from a full-blooded native American seemed to validate it:<br />
<br />
&quot;My forefathers also used smoke signals to announce important events, even if white men couldn&#39;t understand it.&quot;<br />
<br />
But that comment didn&#39;t seem to slow down the Illuminati-believers comments, even though I don&#39;t know anything about the Illuminati.</p>
