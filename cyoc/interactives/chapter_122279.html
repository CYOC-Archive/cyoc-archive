<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A furry 17 year old, named Mike, is on summer break and lives with his 26 year old brother, Dave, who owns his own home and has to take care of Mike since their parents passed away yet Mike was adopted by them. As Mike walks close to his home he sees a package, he thought maybe Dave ordered something and he should bring inside since Dave wasn&#39;t home from work. Mike placed the package on the coffee table and at the corner of his eye he noticed it said &quot;To Mike&quot; he didn&#39;t remember ordering anything but if it&#39;s for him then he should probably see what it&#39;s about. He took it to his room and opened it up to find a USB port, a portable emitter, and a CD-ROM disk called &quot;Chronivac Version 4.0&quot; he put all these things into his computer and waited it to load. As the computer opened up the program, Mike couldn&#39;t believe what the program could do, he thought that this has to be a joke. The program said &quot;scanning, please wait&quot; and in no time, it finished with results<br />
<br />
Name: Mike Henderson<br />
<br />
Sex: Male<br />
<br />
Sexuality: Homosexual<br />
<br />
Mike stopped reading the results and was surprised that it scanned him and tells all this information so accurately, it&#39;s almost scary. At that moment Mike knew this wasn&#39;t a joke, this is serious. He then looked through the packages and being the furry he was, he looked at animals and anthropomorphic animals packs. &quot;Such variety of choices, I have no idea where to even start.&quot; Mike said to himself browsing through each files of different transformations. Mike could not decide which to go with, so he decided to go for something small, the body part changes. Mike instantly smiled at the changes he could make. &quot;I think I&#39;ll give myself a knot.&quot; Mike said as he browsed through the canine folder and selected wolf-penis, then there was 2 sliders for size and 2 options called &quot;custom&quot; and &quot;advanced&quot; he moved the slider to make the penis 10 inches long, and 3 inches wide, he then clicked on &quot;advanced&quot; and sees options to change his stamina (how long he&#39;ll last during sexual activity or masturebation), to change how much cum he has in his balls, how long it&#39;ll be before he can cum again and how much cum he&#39;ll release each time. He kept the stamina the same, changes the capacity of his balls to &quot;endless&quot; which means he has infinite cum, changes to 5 seconds in between orgasims, and finally changes how much cum he&#39;ll release into &quot;huge load&quot;. Mike finally finished and click &quot;Change&quot; and a small window opens saying &quot;save preset&quot; and clicked yes and he instantly felt the changes occurring, almost too quickly, before Mike could see the changes, it was already finished when he pulled down his pants. Mike&#39;s balls were big and his sheathe was too, it was half human, half canine, he sat on his bed started rubbing his balls, revealing his knot cock slowly, but very big, in moments, his cock almost reaches his chin. Mike felt so good, he began rubbing his giant cock and moaning and started getting a lot of dirty ideas, he got up and went to his closest to get out a horse dildo, he got on all fours on his bed and placed his dildo at the tip of his ass and rammed it in, back and forth. Mike kept it up and went on his back with his legs open, still pushing in and out his dildo while sucking himself, then suddenly he bursts, cum filled his mouth and squirted lots out, he tried to drink as much but then let go as he need to breathe, with cum still spewing out, getting it all over him, he bed, and his ceiling, after a couple of seconds he stops. Mike made a big mess but he loved it, he always dreamed of getting into a cum bath, Mike scooped up the cum on his chest and drank it and licked cum off his knot. Mike has never been so happy, his knot slowly went back into his sheathe and then Mike finally got up. Mike slowly took out the dildo in his ass and licked it then put it away, still naked, he got some towels and cleaned off the cum on his ceiling and got his blanket and took it to wash and took a shower. Afterwards, Mike then laid back down and watched some television, not too long until Mike looks at his feet and remembers about his feet paws fetish. &quot;Why didn&#39;t I do this yet, paws are my favorite thing.&quot; He went to his computer and made some modifications to not only his feet, but his entire appearance as well, thinking &quot;I might as well change myself into a complete anthro wolf.&quot; Right before Mike makes his changes, he sees &quot;Alter Reality&quot; clicks it and a box appears saying &quot;By click &quot;Alter Reality&quot; all the changes you make will alter history and change reality, basically making the world think the changes you make are normal, continue? You will be allowed to change this.&quot; Mike clicked yes and instantly felt drowsy, he didn&#39;t feel the changes but he felt like he could fall asleep on the floor, Mike just got on his bed and fell asleep. 2 hours later Mike woke up to his brother, Dave. &quot;Hey wake pup, did you have a long day or something?&quot; Mike sees his brother and gets up. &quot;Kinda, had a weird dream too, and did you just called me pup?&quot; Mike said as he looks up at Dave. &quot;Yeah I always call you pup, it&#39;s my nickname to you, remember? Jesus I hope your not getting amnesia, anyways I&#39;m gonna make some dinner, you want anything?&quot; Dave asks as he is about to leave, &quot;No thanks I&#39;m not hungry.&quot; Mike responds. Dave leaves and goes downstairs. Mike got up and looked into the mirror and sees that he is now an anthro wolf, Mike was so happy, he sat on his bed and took off his socks, and sniffs his feet paws. &quot;Oh fuck yeah, this is a dream come true.&quot; Mike says in his head. Suddenly Dave walks in and was about to tell Mike the blanket he put in the washer is done but catches Mike in the middle of him sniffing his paws. &quot;Woah, shit sorry bro, didn&#39;t mean to bother you in the middle of your little foot fetish thing.&quot; Mike just replied with &quot;Well... Technically a paw fetish but whatever, wanna sniff, maybe a lick?&quot; Dave chuckles and says &quot;Maybe later.&quot; then leaves with Mike a little disappointed and continues to sniff his paws. Mike then hears his phone buzz, he got a text from his friend, Felix, who is also a furry, saying &quot;Hey are you up for some games?&quot; Felix was Mike&#39;s close friend and he was like another brother to Mike, and Felix feels the same way, Mike wondered if he could actually make Felix and himself brothers with the chronivac, as well as change him to his fursona, which is a monkey. Mike looked at his computer and sees that there are files that can do this, and since he was adopted by Dave&#39;s parents, he alter reality to make him adopted as well. Took Mike about 5 minutes to make the changes and pressed clicked &quot;Confirm&quot; then a pop up appears with a countdown until midnight with the text &quot;Loading and extracting changes, the type of changes you made must occur at a specific time.&quot; Mike got a little upset that he had to wait before it could happen, he just couldn&#39;t wait, as he wait he though about changing Dave as well, maybe make some body modifications, maybe do some combinations, and by combinations he means giving he a horse cock and feet paws, and change his mental mind to allow any sexual activity at anytime, even from his brother or new brother, just something he could while he waited for Felix to become his and Dave&#39;s new brother. About an hour later Mike went into the kitchen and sits on a chair in the dinning room as Dave finishes cleaning the dishes. &quot;So now you wanna get a sniff at my paws?&quot; Mike says and without hesitation, Dave got on his knees and began to sniff Mike&#39;s paws and licking them and saying &quot;Anything for you bro.&quot; Dave then unbutton his pants and pulled them down revealing his erected horse dick. &quot;Can I get some of that Dave?&quot; Mike says pointing at Dave&#39;s dick, Dave got up and Mike got on his knees to suck his cock, getting all of it down his throat and feeling cum fill up, Mike let go and breathe heavily then continued to drink Dave&#39;s cum from his cock like a fountain. Eventually Dave stopped and pulled up his cock to lick cum off of the tip, Mike got up and Dave licked the cum off his muzzle and said, &quot;Go get cleaned up you slutty wolf.&quot; Mike then left to take a shower and they both continue with their day, Mike was exhausted and just went to bed. The next morning, Mike woke up to hands in front of his face &quot;Dave, why do your hands smell like dirty feet, not that I&#39;m complaining.&quot; Mike said in a tired tone, he then heard a giggle that sounded like his friend Felix, the hands move away and Mike moves up to see it was Felix, and he shoved his monkey feet in Mike&#39;s face. &quot;You know you like my feet, why are you resisting?&quot; Felix says as he continues to shove them in Mike&#39;s face. &quot;Who says I&#39;m resisting?&quot; Mike responds as he gets good sniff at Felix&#39;s feet. Felix then jumps off and crouches down like a monkey. &quot;So what do you wanna do today? Dave already left to work, we got the whole house to ourselves!&quot; Felix says in an exciting way, &quot;Well first I need to go to the bathroom.&quot; Mike says as he gets up, as Mike walks out his room, he sees Felix&#39;s room, exactly the way it was at his house before the change, just very small changes. Mike walks into the bathroom and flips up the toilet but before Mike could pee, Felix walks in. &quot;Why don&#39;t piss in here instead.&quot; Felix says as he points at his mouth, Mike is surprised but at the same time not, Felix&#39;s fursona has a lot of those monkey instincts and every now and then enjoys drinking piss and eating poop. &quot;Alright then.&quot; Mike said as he turns over to him and Felix kneels with his mouth open, Mike then pisses straight into Felix&#39;s mouth. &quot;Mmm tasty, thanks bro.&quot; Felix says as he gets up and walks out. &quot;No problem.&quot; Mike replies. Mike walks into the kitchen and sees Felix on the dinning table crouching again like a monkey with an apple in his tail then grabs it with his feet and takes a bite out of it. &quot;You want a bite?&quot; Felix offers as he gives it to Mike, he grabs the apple and smells the monkey feet off it but still takes a bite and hands it back to his feet. &quot;So what are your plans for today?&quot; Mike wondered what could he do for the day with Felix</p>
