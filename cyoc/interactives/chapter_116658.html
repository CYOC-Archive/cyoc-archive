<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Well it was a good idea,” Eric sighed as he watched Frieda and spencer struggle to press their furry breasts onto his feline member. The attempt to double titty fuck both girls was proving to be anatomically impossible as the two girls kept banging their heads onto each other.<br />
“Perhaps if you were lying on a raised platform and we were kneeling,” Frieda thinking.<br />
“Where are we going to find a platform,” Spencer getting up; “here in the forest.”<br />
“A fallen tree trunk perhaps,” Frieda shrugging her shoulders.<br />
“Not exactly a comfortable spot to lie down on,” Eric watching the two argue.<br />
“Eric is right,” Spencer gathering her clothes; “they are never flat and full of knots and burls.”<br />
“So that’s it then,” Eric watch Spencer defur as she gets dressed; “fun time is over.”<br />
“I guess so,” Frieda looking at her phone; “besides we need to be getting home soon.”<br />
<br />
Eric grumbled as he was denied a chance to plow either girl. Enjoying watching them eat each other out as he jacked off; spilling his load multiple times as Frieda and Spencer had fun trying be the first to orgasm. Now putting his clothes back on as he defurred; the white furred were-panther resumed his normal human form with brown hair. With Frieda also following suit; the three leave the secluded area of the forest and return to the picnic grounds.<br />
“Looks like the skulk are having a difficult time,” Frieda chuckling as she looks at the picnic grounds now filled with those in their fursona.<br />
“I guess with a mobster in jail,” Spencer responding; “everyone thinks the were-alert is over.”<br />
“We violated the alert,” Eric speaking up; “albeit we waited until we were alone and in the woods.”<br />
“If it was any other travelling carnival group,” Frieda observing; “we would be in trouble.”<br />
“Why is that,” Spencer asking; looking at Frieda as she smiled wryly.<br />
“Because this carnival group is entirely weres like us,” Frieda grinning; “they have a long standing tradition with Moon Lake. A little something my uncle told me recently,” Frieda sighing; “he wants me to be ready when I take over as were-panther rep so he has been briefing me with council reports as of late.”<br />
“I take it,” Eric responding; “that your father has also been privy to these chats?”<br />
“Of course,” Frieda answering as they reach Spencer’s truck; “dad was the were-panther rep before he assaulted those security men at Tachibana headquarters last year. He confirmed the whole carnival being comprised of weres, along with a few other things.”<br />
<br />
What other things,” Spencer climbing into her truck; “what else do you know?”<br />
“That I can’t share at this time,” Frieda looking glum; “part of being a council rep means having to keep secrets. Secrets that can put the town in harm’s way if shared.”<br />
“We won’t spill if that is what you are worried,” Eric responding; “you can confide in us.”<br />
“It’s not that,” Frieda smiling at the comforting words Eric just spoke; “we weres have excellent hearing. While we try not to overhear conversations held in private,“ Frieda sighing; “sometimes…”<br />
“It can be what is referred to as a party line,” Spencer finishing the sentence; “you can’t help but listen in, even if you are on the other side of the room.”<br />
“Or a wall separates you and those having the chat,” Frieda nodding.<br />
“That explains things,” Eric grunting; “many times I have heard Nate and Jean have a conversation despite them whispering and a wall separating mine and Nate’s room.”<br />
“You definitely hear them rutting,” Spencer chuckling; “being that close.”<br />
“That’s a given,” Frieda comment; all the while Eric chooses to remain silent as he watches Spencer turn onto the road heading towards the Knight estate.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
“So what should we make for dinner,” William asking Martha as he pulls into the driveway; oblivious to the sedan parked across the street and a man sitting in the driver’s seat observing silently.<br />
“Well it’s too late in the day to make a roast,” Martha answering; “we could BBQ up some chicken. Add a salad to it and few other sides.”<br />
“We could use that leftover macaroni to make a salad with,” William thinking; “make some mashed potatoes.”<br />
“As long as we have a proper salad to go along with it,” Martha responding; “lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers…”<br />
“I get it,” William getting out of the car; “I’ll fire up the grill and deal with the chicken.”<br />
<br />
The second man who was lurking in the backyard of the Anderson house hold silently swore as he overheard the conversation. Seeing the propane grill not far from the back door of the house, he knew he had to get out fast and soon. Unable to leave the way he came; via the gate separating the front and backyard, the lone man makes a mad dash to the wooded area behind the house just in time. Seeing the elder Anderson enter the back yard to fire up the grill; he watches as William pauses to sniff the air.<br />
‘He must be smelling my lingering scent,’ the henchman thinking to himself; ‘I better find a way to get back to the car before he decides to follow it.’<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Meanwhile the first henchman spied through the rearview mirror an approaching police cruiser. Thinking fast, he ducks down in the seat. Waiting for the cruiser to pass he spots his phone charger on the floor of the passenger seat.<br />
“I wondered where that went,” The henchman musing to himself; grabbing it just as the deputies walked by his car approaching the Anderson household.<br />
<br />
“I’m picking up a definite were-panther scent,” one deputy comments; as they head towards the household.<br />
“Perhaps the old man next door is telling the truth,” the other deputy responding; “yet we could be picking up the young Anderson kid. He is a were-panther.”<br />
“Well it looks like someone is home,” the deputy answering; “there is a car in the driveway and the side gate here is open.”<br />
<br />
Walking to the backyard the deputies notice a man at a BBQ. Seeing him turn around they explain why they are there; responding to reports of a prowler seen entering the backyard.<br />
“I only just got home,” William shaking his head; “but I did smell something off a few minutes ago.”<br />
“Was it a were-panther scent,” a deputy asking the were-fox in front of him.”<br />
“Now that you mention it,” William thinking; “it was and I didn’t recognize it.”<br />
“Well it looks like whoever it was,” the other deputy speaking; “they were scared off by your arrival.”<br />
“And the chicken you are grilling has killed any chance of picking up the person’s scent,” the other deputy sniffing the air.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Back at the car the henchman that was in the backyard of the Anderson household just got back; giving the other henchman a bit of a scare.<br />
“Get in the back seat and stay low,” the other henchman stating; “a police cruiser is here and the deputies are at the target’s house.”<br />
“Well that’s just fucking lovely,” the winded henchman swearing; “I just had to run through the forest to the house behind the one we are watching and circle around the block just to get back here.”<br />
“The parents arrived home first,” the first henchman responding; “we may have to abort.”<br />
“Like hell,” the other man answering; “Jack’s orders were clear. Make Nate miss school tomorrow; remember the last time the boss’s orders were not fulfilled?”<br />
<br />
“Get down,” the other henchman whispering; “the deputies are coming back.”<br />
Grumbling as his question was ignored; the second henchman complies as the deputies walk by the sedan, stunned that they didn’t look through the window as they walked back to the cruiser. Slowly getting up as the cruiser drives off, the henchmen breathe a sigh of relief.<br />
“That was close,” the first one speaking; “I’m saying we abort this.”<br />
“No chance in that,” the second man quickly getting out of the back seat and hoping into the front passenger seat; “Jack wants this done and I’m not interested in getting his fur up.”<br />
“Fine,” the first man pulling out some brass knuckles from his coat pocket; “but if another police cruiser comes by, we are driving off.”</p>
