<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff held onto the stone lightly hoping that what he had purchased actually worked. He started to feel dizzy and whilst he steadied himself he closed his eyes for a few seconds. When he opened his eyes again he found himself in unfamiliar surroundings. <br />
<br />
A disoriented Jeff looked around and found himself in a large hallway in what seemed like an extremely large house. He turned around and just saw a large front door being opened and a smartly dressed man bringing in two small bags and set them down just inside of the doorway  with a whole host of similar bags. There was also some designer brands giftbags that looked full to the brim with clothing and other accessories. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s all your bags Miss Sylph, I&#39;ll see you next time.&quot; The man said in an English accent.<br />
<br />
Jeff was thoroughly confused &quot;Miss?&quot; He muttered as the man shut the door behind him.<br />
<br />
He suddenly remembered that he was trying to get that magic stone to work and it must have transported him into someone else&#39;s life, someone very wealthy by the looks of things. He looked down at himself and saw he was wearing a loose hoodie and some tight tracksuit bottoms. He was feeling quite uncomfortable around his chest and around his groin and ass but apart from that he looked like himself just in unusual clothing.<br />
<br />
On the right wall leading into a hallway was a large mirror and realised maybe he could see his reflection or if it would be the persons life he had taken overs reflection, it was worth a shot because he wanted answers. Jeff walked over to the mirror and stood in front of it and the image that stared back left him in shock.<br />
<br />
Staring back at him was the face and body of Taylor Sylph one of the most popular popstars in the world. He had always had a crush on her as she was super attractive as well as talented, he even followed her on various social media platforms as he was a big fan. She was very tall and skinny but curvy in the right places. She was blonde and had an extremely nice personality. She must have been wearing the baggy hoodie for comfort whilst travelling. He realised the tight tracksuit bottoms where skin tight leggings which made Jeff feel a bit strange as he was effectively crossdressing from his perspective but something inside him brushed that away as it was super comfortable.<br />
<br />
Jeff also realised what that strange feeling was around his chest, it was a sports bra that felt very strange as he had no breasts for it to cup. He was holding the hoodie up around his neck looking at this bra that was bright red and loose around him. He glanced up as he was still in front of the mirror and saw that the bra in the reflection was holding Taylor&#39;s breasts perfectly. He was very turned on looking at his amazingly attractive reflection, after a few minutes of admiring her perfect breasts he let the hoodie drop back into place. Still very turned on Jeff turned around and looked back at her perfect butt being squeezed inside the leggings.<br />
<br />
He realised it was very late in the evening as she must have just gotten back from her big worldwide tour she had just completed. Jeff felt exhausted and decided to explore more of this house and this life in the morning. It took him some time to find Taylor&#39;s bedroom but once he did he collapsed into her amazingly comfy bed and wanted to go to sleep, but first the bra he was still wearing bothered him so he struggled to unclip the back but once he did he pulled it off and went to sleep. <br />
<br />
After an amazing night sleep Jeff awoke in the large bed well rested and ready to explore. He got up and made his way to go and find the kitchen of this place. After he whipped himself up some cereal and watched some tv on the awesome television system Taylor had in her living room Jeff gathered the bags that were left by the front door and took them to the bedroom.<br />
<br />
Jeff didn&#39;t know what else to do but try and put her tour clothes and her new clothes away, he did like the girl after all didn&#39;t want to leave her with trouble after he had returned to his old life besides he really liked some of her outfits she had worn whilst on tour and wanted to see them in person. <br />
<br />
Jeff opened the door to the huge walk in closet adjoining the master bedroom and started unpacking various suitcases, some of these clothes must have been washed on the tour so he put them in their respective places and draws. The unwashed clothes he threw into the washing bins that he had found. Most of the new clothing bags he left on the bed to look at once he was done, he found what must have been her handbag and her phone inside. Jeff thought he should have a look at her phone to see if she was missing any important messages not that he could do much if there was. It was mostly just messages from managers and producers thanking her for the amazing tour. He was relieved she must be having some time off from doing anything important.<br />
<br />
With that out of the way he started unbagging all of the new clothes and accessories onto the bed to examine. There was expensive clothing from many different brands and some came to his attention such as a selection of hosiery from Ariestre, a large selection of underwear including thongs and other attractive panties with some bras, also a nice knitted cardigan which would look lovely on Taylor&#39;s form and perfect for her current style and last but not least an all purpose expensive adult toy which made Jeff blush holding it. <br />
<br />
Jeff wondered what he could do with this life and the new clothing and eventually had an amazing idea he was going to try on some of these clothes and look at himself in the mirror. First he got undressed out of yesterdays clothing, he opened the pack of thongs and put one on as well as some expensive fitting pantyhose which were a struggle to put on but he got there in the end. His manly legs looked quite strange in this getup as well as his penis bulging out in Taylor&#39;s tight new panties. He didn&#39;t bother with a bra as he didn&#39;t see much point so he just zipped up the nice new cardigan and made his way to the mirror in the hallway.<br />
<br />
Her legs looked stunning encased in the pantyhose and the small thong fitted perfectly she also looked extremely cute in her new cardigan, this whole situation really turned him on so he ran to get her phone and snap some pictures of himself to send to his real life account on social media. He vowed to himself to not do anything unjust with the pictures they would be for his own personal use later. After taking many pictures on the phone he went to sit down in front of the tv and try to find his account that followed her. He thought that maybe he could post a picture of his outfit onto her main feed as a reminder of his time inhabiting her life, she was known for these kinds of outfits after all.<br />
<br />
After finding his account and sending through hundreds of saucy photographs of his idol and posting the best one onto her profile he realised the day was done, He got himself some food and sat down to eat whilst watching some tv. He had left the panties and pantyhose on as they were strangely comfortable but took off the cardigan in order to not ruin it whilst he was eating. That meant he was shirtless with only a nice pair of pantyhose on, he had them pulled all the way up past his belly button like he had seen her wearing that style before which he thought was very hot. He stayed up watching tv and eventually fell asleep after a few hours.<br />
<br />
When he woke up he realised that...</p>
