<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Here are the keys, Rico,&quot; Snake said tossing Erik the keys to Chad, &quot;Make him a beauty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean her?&quot; Erik said grabbing some plastic to cover Chad&#39;s seat and floor. He slid into  Chad&#39;s bucket seat, and ran his hands over the console before revving up the engine. He listened to the engine, and ran his hands under the dash. &quot;I&#39;ll put the nitro controls under here,&quot; he told Snake.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re the experto. I&#39;ll leave you to your work, and be back tomorrow to check on how it&#39;s coming.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erik drove Chad into the garage. He lowered the door after Snake left, and went back to admire his new toy.  He considered the cars he worked on his toys.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s see what I got to work with.  He unzipped his grease stained jumpsuit.  He was naked underneath as he stepped out, and kicked off his shoes. He moved the plastic off the seat and sat down with his bare ass and sweaty balls pressed against Chad.  &quot;Like butter,&quot; he commented on the luxurious leather against his skin. <br />
<br />
More like Chorizo? thought Chad nastily.  The guy reeked of garlic and sweat.  Please just turn me on, he thought. He was turned on but a guy, perhaps anyone in his driver&#39;s seat.  He needed to - ah, yes.  <br />
<br />
Erik turned the key to activate the power, but didn&#39;t start the engine. He turned on the computer screen, and groaned that it was the operating system only had the English version.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I guess I&#39;ll have to fix that before Raul goes to work on your engine, baby, he doesn&#39;t speak or read English. He shoved a USB cable into the console and Chad&#39;s mind reeled.  Schematics in Spanish and French and Japanese whirred through his brain.  He guessed the English version was already there, and he just hadn&#39;t noticed it, but he wasn&#39;t really sure. While the download was filling the car&#39;s computer, Erik unscrewed the shifter. Chad was only aware when it was removed that his dick was gone. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nice shifter, I think I&#39;ll put it in my car. He unwrapped the chrome and burled wood one that Snake wanted installed. It was designed to look like a cobra. He screwed it into Chad. <br />
<br />
Chad felt relieved that his dick was back, but it felt different somehow. He couldn&#39;t see, and he didn&#39;t understand yet.  It was almost like he had two dicks. One that was part of him, and the other one which seemed separated.  Snake wanted custom wheels and dual exhaust pipes, so Chad was going to feel separated about other body parts as well. <br />
<br />
Suddenly he heard a pneumatic blast. Then he felt the pain.  His skin was being sandblasted off. He had felt naked before, now even more so.  The computer files filling his brain telling him that he was a car, and the excruciating pain of the sandblaster.  He had barely noticed when Erik (dressed again) and Raul had taped his windows and chrome work before beginning the sanding. He felt awful.  He was blind with the paper taped over his headlamps. The primer felt like salve, as Raul and Erik applied it.  Then they left him alone in the dark to let the primer dry.  The next day, they applied the first coat of paint.  It felt cool and made Chad feel whole again.  Another coat was applied, and then they mapped out the detailed designs with an giant cobra on hood, and writhing brightly colored (yellow, red and orange) flame-like serpents running along the sides.  It took forever and Chad was going mad.  If Jason had stopped by, Chad hadn&#39;t heard him, but even if he had stopped by with the constantly blaring Mexican radio station, he probably wouldn&#39;t have heard Jason.<br />
<br />
At last the applied the sealant, and then the paper and tape came off.  Jason was alone with Chad.  Though the boom box was still blaring.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope you don&#39;t mind, Snake, but I re-set the computer&#39;s default to Spanish, so Raul can calibrate the nitro and emissions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s fine, Rico.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You do know my name really is Erik, not Rico?&quot; Erik said, &quot;My folks named me after some actor who was popular before I was born.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Erik Estrada?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, John-Erik Hexum,&quot; Erik said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So your first name is Juan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t even go there, man!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Erik.  Just having a bit of fun.  Mind if I spend some alone time with my car?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, go ahead.  We still have to make the engine mods you want and install the nitro system. Besides I gotta install something in my own car.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason waited until he was sure they were alone. Then he put the car key on Chad&#39;s hood, and muttered something. Chad trembled, and felt his metal and rubber parts pulling inward. He felt so strange as his body became flesh and bone again. He was standing naked in the middle of the auto bay, but he felt oddly different. But it was good to be human. He hoped Jason had had a change of heart about turning him into his car permanently. <br />
<br />
&quot;Gracias. Esta bueno ser humano de nuevo,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Then he looked down at his body. His dick hung down longer than before, and he was no longer circumcised.  His skin color was also much darker and he was covered with snake tattoos.<br />
<br />
&quot;Que Paso?!&quot; exclaimed Chad in horror.<br />
<br />
Snake howled with laughter. <br />
<br />
&quot;I just wanted to make sure you could still turn human.  I had no idea I&#39;d change Gringo Chad into a homey.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad looked confused, he couldn&#39;t understand what Snake was saying.  The language sounded foreign, maybe German?<br />
<br />
&quot;No, habla ingles, Chad?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad thought for a moment, and answered, &quot;Porque?  No, pienso en ingles?  Hablo espanol solamente?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;ll have to bone up on my Spanish or reset your default computer to English before we speak again, Chad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Que?&quot;<br />
<br />
Snake pushed the key into Chad&#39;s belly button, turning it, he muttered some strange words.  Chad changed back into the newly painted car with the key in his ignition.</p>
