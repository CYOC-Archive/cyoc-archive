<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nathan’s equine nostrils snorted hard as he fought with himself over what to do.  They were so close to their destination now, where they could spend hour after hour fulfilling their needs.  His problem was his own growing need, one that Suzanne was going out of her way to escalate with her teasing and licking of his pulsating shaft.  His eyes off the road for the moment, and locked onto her radiant form, the rich, long, wide, and thick mane that wafted and billowed when the wind from the open window caught it in just the right manner, the firm full breasts just begging for him to play with, the beautiful tail of her from under her torn skirt that she must have forgotten about as it still hung around her waist.  <br />
<br />
Eventually, the promise of many hours of ecstatic delight in a short time won out over the stop-start nature that Suzanne was pushing for, and with a little regret he slowly placed a large hand under her lengthy jaw and pushed her gently aside.  <br />
<br />
“Thorry theeer.”  He slurred slowly.  “Buth, ten minuthsh thenn we can reeaalllly geth tooo ith.”  As a means of placating her, he pushed down on the Gas Pedal hard with his right hoof, the RV picking up the pace with a slight lurch.  <br />
<br />
“Fffffiiiiiiinnnnneeee.”  Suzanne pouted, only tolerating the delay by Nathan’s act to cut the time as she squeezed her near-seven-foot-tall body back onto her own seat.  <br />
<br />
Pushing on in…relative…silence, save for the growing din of the engine being worked harder to take them to their planned stop-point before Nathan really did cave in to his want.  By now they were very much the spitting image of anthropomorphic horses, with the hard hooves and elevated ankles of their legs, with a covering of fur alongside long faces and tails of horses, yet retaining the dexterous hands and bipedal stance of a human, with high intellect and the capacity for speech, if rather slurred and garbled by their lack of experience with speaking through their changed mouths.  Very fortunate for them then, that their transformation had stopped given that Nathan was still driving.  <br />
<br />
With Nathan’s thoughts firmly planted on getting them there, the blood had receded from his thick penis resulting in it shrinking down and drooping to rest over his left thigh, if still impressively large by any measure.  As Suzanne squirmed and scooted about on her own seat impatiently for when they could finally get started.  <br />
<br />
“Tthheerre!”  Nathan called as one thick finger pointed ahead of them, the motel they’d selected for the night.  <br />
<br />
“Abouth thime!”  Suzanne declared as she had to grab the seat to avoid sliding off when Nathan had hit the brakes hard and spun the wheel to swing them into the parking lot, reaching a vacant spot in record time before putting it into Park and killing the engine.  <br />
<br />
“Leth’sh, pith uup, whath we needth.  Anth, geth a room.”  Nathan panted, his lust growing again with no further distractions.  <br />
<br />
Suzanne had already swung out of her seat and was running around the RV interior, having to keep herself stooped down to keep from banging her head against the ceiling.  <br />
<br />
“Walleth, keeth, camera, pursh, thoilethreesh, thath’sh ith I think.”  Suzanne mumbled as she tossed them into a bag, determined to get it done ASAP so they could have their ‘fun’.  <br />
<br />
Lethsh gggoooo theeeennnn.”  Nathan replied as he half-crawled to the only door in the RV, squeezing his bulky frame though it with some effort.  <br />
<br />
Now both out in the darkening sky, and with the RV locked for the night, they sometimes walked, sometimes stumbled around to the front.  It was now clear that Nathan had to be a good half-foot taller than Suzanne was, limbs, chest and abs thick with raw muscle that contrasted with Suzanne’s more athletic build.  <br />
<br />
Working their way into the reception, the sole attendant jumped back and off his seat when he caught the sight of them, a pair of bipedal horses heading his way.  <br />
<br />
“Neeth.  Room for, the, nighth.”  Nathan slurred to him, not understanding why he looked to be scared half-out of his mind.  “Two.  Double.  Bed.”  He added as Suzanne pulled out her purse to pay in cash.  <br />
<br />
“Yeeeees, we do, have one such room, number 18, down the hall, to the right is available, and recently cleaned.”  The receptionist, Joshua on his nametag, replied slowly, his fears melting away as he handed them the keys in question and pointed them down the hall on their left.  <br />
<br />
“Thanksh.”  Suzanne replied with a weird looking smile as she took the change from their payment for the room.  With the keys in hand, they turned and made for their room for the night, tails swishing behind them as they clopped along.  <br />
<br />
What neither of them noticed as they left, was that Joshua who had dealt with their request, was no looking a little off himself, his receding hairline slowly returning as his face slowly pushed out, while his uniform grew a little tighter around him.  <br />
<br />
“Ath lashth!”  Suzanne cried as she jumped into the room the moment it was unlocked, tossing the bag onto the couch as she sprawled on the queen-sized bed.  <br />
<br />
Nathan was slower in entering, making sure the door was locked with the ‘Do Not Disturb’ Sign set outside before he joined his wife at the bed, his hoofed feet dangling over the end of the firm-yet-comfortable bed and its thick sheets even with his head on the pillows.  With Suzanne leaning on her side, slowly stroking his mottled pink-and-black cock, the blood pumped back into it as it hardened and lengthened.  <br />
<br />
“Now, thath thime I promised you…”  Nathan coyly smirked as he shifted himself just enough to get the flared tip of it to her already wet labia.  <br />
<br />
[+]<br />
<br />
“What is taking them so long?”  One of the younger men demanded as the three from earlier waited at the fire.  <br />
<br />
“Who knows?”  The eldest of the three replied.  “After all, we only knew they were heading in this direction, not where they’d stop exactly.”  <br />
<br />
“So they’re up along there?”  The second queried, pointing to the road.  <br />
<br />
“Perhaps, and that could be a serious risk.”  <br />
<br />
“Why is that?”  The first one spoke up again.  <br />
<br />
“Because of the imperfect nature of your little stunt.”  The eldest cut in harshly.  “And as a result there is no telling just what might happen, it may even spread.”  <br />
<br />
“That’s a risk!?”  The second asked, shock clear on his face.  <br />
<br />
“Yes.  So if they’ve stopped near others, the situation could easily spread past our control.”  <br />
<br />
“So…what…do, we do, then?”  The first was now a little afraid.  <br />
<br />
“We wait ten more minutes, then, if there‘s no sign of them, we head up that road to look for them.”</p>
