<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">All superlative size comparisons aside, Nate was an absolute giant, there was no question about it.  He crouched there breathing in and out big thundering breaths.  Squatting in a baseball catcher&#39;s stance was growing uncomfortable for the mammoth-sized man, so he moved as slowly as he could in the fairly large-sized master bedroom, attempting to sit on the floor.  In the process, he knocked over several items on the dresser, and tipped the bedside table over with barely a brush of his trashcan lid sized palm.  Matt jumped out of the way as his gigantic younger brother&#39;s rippling legs slid toward him, still stuffed in overstretched socks and crammed into much-too-small lifting shorts.  Matt could see with some discomfort that Nate was proportionally endowed &quot;downstairs&quot; as well.  His monster member stuffed like a sausage into the shorts.<br />
<br />
As Nate eased back against the wall, cracking the drywall slightly he let out a sigh surveying his behemoth body.  His huge pecs hung healthily over his tight 8 pack abs, which were framed by very cut and veiny obliques that stretched up into soaring lats propping up horse-torso sized arms.  His waist was much larger but looked tight proportional to his size, before his legs blew outwards in all directions, pushing his shorts past their limit.  His glutes were obscene, and had become so large you could just see the top of his crack in the back.  The quads gave way to overly stuffed calves before tapering down to tight ankles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow...&quot; Matt whispered looking up at his gigantic little brother.  He looked ready for a contest, despite being 4 feet taller than even the tallest average competitive bodybuilder.<br />
Nate smirked as he looked down at his heavyset muscled big brother.  &quot;This is all thanks to you, Matty.  I guess my deepest desire was to be a giant.  I&#39;m curious, though.  What my measurements are.  Do you have a tape?&quot;<br />
Matt grinned up at his brother.  <br />
&quot;Sure do!  I&#39;ll grab it.&quot;  And he made for the door at a waddle.<br />
&quot;Damn, waddle any slower and it&#39;ll be next Christmas.&quot; Nate joked.<br />
&quot;Fuck you, Nate,&quot; Matt laughed, &quot;we don&#39;t all desire to be proportionate gods.&quot;<br />
Nate chuckled, watching his abs and pecs tense up and relax with the laugh as his brother left the room to get the measuring tape.  He would never be able to leave this room at this size, and he hoped he could control his desires to shrink back sooner or later.<br />
<br />
Matt returned with a 10 foot tape and held it up.<br />
&quot;Well, big man, what&#39;ll it be first?&quot; he said.<br />
Nate smiled and lifted his titanic arms in a double bicep flex.<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s do these hams first.&quot;<br />
&quot;Hams... ha, more like the whole damn pig.&quot; Matt retorted as he climbed up on a chair to wrap the tape around the monsterous right arm of his brother.  Given Matt&#39;s own large size and Nate&#39;s absolutely gigantic proportions, it was tough work throwing the tape around the upper arm, but he finally managed it and ogled at the number.<br />
&quot;71 inches! Unflexed!&quot; Matt cried, &quot;bodybuilders could only dream of having legs even close to this big!<br />
Nate laughed and replied, &quot;speaking of, see if that tape can reach around one of those bad boys,&quot; as he shook his right quad, jiggling the muscle around under the skin before flexing it into a rock hard pipe of overlapping tongues of muscles.<br />
&quot;On it.&quot; Matt shook his head as he climbed off the chair and walked over to the leg.  He jumped as best he could and flopped his big body over the top of Nate&#39;s thigh, feeling it shake and wiggle under his rock hard gut.<br />
Nate stifled a laugh as he felt his older brother&#39;s hard pecs and gut drape across his leg, his stubbled body hair from a week-old shave tickling his inner leg.<br />
Matt threw the end of the tape down over Nate&#39;s inner leg and leapt off backwards to the floor, &quot;alright big man, lift that leg so I can grab the end of the tape.&quot;<br />
Nate did so, and Matt carefully lowered his own large body down and under the leg to grab the tape.  After retrieving it, he came up and tried connecting the end to the other end of the tape, and balked, his eyes not believing what should have been unsurprising given the size of his brother&#39;s leviathan body.<br />
&quot;Dude.  The ends don&#39;t meet, Nate.  I&#39;m coming about 5 inches short!!&quot; Matt exclaimed trying to bring the two ends of the tape together.  <br />
Matt looked up as they both processed what this meant.  One of Nate&#39;s quads was bigger in circumference than he was tall.  Nate stood at about 10 feet, 3 inches, or 123 inches, tall, which they guessed based on knowing the ceiling height.  His quad looked to measure 125 inches.<br />
<br />
A car honking out on the street shook them both from their awe.  Matt realized then that Janet was nearing the end of her shift and would be home soon.  He said as much to the gigantic Nate and they realized quickly they needed to regain control of the situation, not wanting Janet to come home to a 10 foot brother-in-law sitting nearly naked in their bedroom.<br />
<br />
After discussing it quickly, Nate told Matt to pull up old video and images of his competition last year as inspiration for their subconsciouses to focus on in order to return to a more human size, with Nate being the primary offender in the inhuman category.<br />
<br />
Matt was learning quickly, and after focusing on his little brother&#39;s old posing routine, shed a huge portion of his gut and trimmed down to a heavyweight but more reasonable 280 pounds, still able to fill out his boxer shorts nicely.<br />
<br />
Nate took longer.  His height was obviously a huge thing to overcome, and it was his first time trying to override his subconscious.  He was a quick learner, however, and over the course of about 30 minutes, his body regained it&#39;s old height of 6 feet and, and after checking the bathroom scale, a larger than he was, but still more reasonable 300 pounds.  By the time he reached about 8 feet tall, down two feet from his max, and an unknown hundreds of pounds, Nate reached down quickly to grab his shorts which were slipping off him, due to their stretchiness reaching it&#39;s limit and then some, they could not return to their former size.  He gripped them tightly in one fist, but just barely having trouble getting his arm that low on his body due to his huge upper arms, pillow-like pecs, and winged traps.<br />
<br />
Once he was down to his 6 feet and 300 pounds, Matt passed him a pair of large basketball shorts which clung to his butt and thighs grotesquely, showing off his above average bulge to rival Matt&#39;s own obscene one in his boxers.<br />
<br />
Right about this time, they both heard the front door open and their eyes snapped onto each other.<br />
&quot;Janet.&quot; they both whispered to each other.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oooh, Maaaatt, I&#39;m home!!&quot; Janet called sing-song up the stairs.<br />
<br />
The brothers stared at each other as they heard the approaching footsteps.  They had each thought they had more time.  Matt had wished he could get Nate out of the house before Janet returned, and Nate didn&#39;t know what to think as he heard his sister-in-law approach while he only wore an overly tight pair of shorts in their destroyed bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t wait to see what you&#39;ve done with that hot bod of yours in the last few hours, Matt,&quot; Janet said as she entered the room.  Then she stopped short.  She saw her husband there, with a slightly rounded but firm and toned muscle belly standing in slightly too small boxer shorts, with quads exploding out the leg holds and ham-sized upper arms, veined and tanned hanging dumbly down at his sides, being propped up and away by swelled up lats.  He just stood there looking stupidly at her as she glanced at the other man standing 5 feet away wearing a pair of her husband&#39;s basketball shorts which were far too small on him as well, looking every bit the professional bodybuilder, with a tight core, thick pecs hanging over the ripped abs, veins running criss cross across every muscle group.  His hat backwards and socks stretched out loosely over his ankles for some reason.<br />
<br />
It took her a moment, but she recognized him.  He was quite a bit larger than she remembered, but she knew him.<br />
<br />
&quot;NATE???  What the hell are you doing here and why do you look like that??  Wait.  Can you do what Matt does too??&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate glanced at stupidly at his older brother, and back at her, looking just as if he was a kid that just broke the window with a baseball.<br />
&quot;Um.. Hi, Janet.  Short answer... Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janet stood there gaping at the two huge men in her room, her hormones uncontrollably raging at the site of the two of them showing off her ideal man&#39;s body.  She didn&#39;t need more explanation.  She couldn&#39;t help herself.<br />
&quot;So...&quot; she started, mouth watering and unconsciously removing her purse from her shoulder and peeling off her scrub shirt revealing a lacy bra, &quot;I heard Paris is lovely this time of year...&quot; she said suggestively.<br />
Nate turned bright red, only fueling Janet&#39;s desire as she giggled at his nervous embarrassment.  Matt stood their trying to process what Janet was saying while simultaneously getting turned on by his wife&#39;s alluring body and sultry voice.  Janet batted her eyes at the two brothers as she waited for them to catch her meaning and removed her scrub pants, now only in her panties and bra.  She made her way over to her husband and grabbed his hand, running her fingernail gently from his belly button up the gut and through his pec cleavage to his chin as she led him backwards toward Nate.<br />
&quot;Ummm, Janet, what are you doing?  What did you mean about Par...&quot; Matt stopped talking as it dawned on him.  Paris... Eiffel Tower... Janet wanted a threesome with him and his little brother Nate who were both currently sporting the enormous bodies of super heavyweight bodybuilders.  Janet reached Nate still standing in dumb fascination watching his sister-in-law walk suggestively backwards at him in her underwear pulling her large husband along toward him.  She stopped when her perky butt brushed against Nate&#39;s sweeping outer quad.  Nate tensed every muscle as Janet turned around and looked up at him, inadvertently fueling her lust as she saw every muscle flex and tighten.  She reached up and cupped his enormous pecs with her free hand.<br />
&quot;I think Matty has caught my drift, have you my Billy?&quot; Janet, using the nickname she had given Nate stemming from &quot;Brother-In-Law, or &quot;B.I.L.&quot;<br />
&quot;Uhhh,&quot; Nate said, his mind racing as he looked from her to Matt for answers.<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon sweetie, you can do it,&quot; Janet cooed as she ran hands over both Nate and Matt&#39;s abs staring up at them both as they stood shoulder to shoulder, a wall of rock hard muscle.<br />
<br />
The idea was growing on Matt for some reason.  Sharing his wife with his brother seemed vile at first, but he couldn&#39;t deny this was a very sexually appealing situation.  Two prime alpha males, somehow blown up to extremes, and his svelte little wife willing to please them both.  He slowly smiled at Nate to comfort his little brother in this odd situation.  Nate relaxed a bit and thought it out.  Recalling what Janet had said.  It slowly came to him as he remembered his college days with his frat brothers.  They had often satisfied hot little sorority girls together in return for threesomes with two girls.  He remembered the ongoing joke of calling a standing threesome with two guys and a girl an &#39;Eiffel Tower&#39; since the girl would make the bridge part, simultaneously sucking one guy off while getting plowed on the other end by the other guy.  As a joke, the two guys would high five, making the shape of the Eiffel Tower.  He was flabbergasted at first then as he saw both Janet and his brother Matt were clearly into it, he grinned slowly.<br />
&quot;I agree, I think Paris is nice this time of year.&quot; Nate said looking at the two of them.  Janet squealed in delight as she ripped off her underwear and tore at Matt&#39;s overly tight boxers, ripping them off.  Nate was a bit embarrassed at seeing his muscled older brother&#39;s naked form, but was quickly distracted by Janet&#39;s bouncing tits jumping around between the two of them.  Nate slowly turned to face them as Janet took her place between the two behemoth men.  Janet looked down expectantly at Nate&#39;s tight shorts as she felt Matt&#39;s rising member brush her bare ass and his pecs brush against the back of her head as he inched closer to her and gripped her waist.  Nate shyly looked down at her as he reached down and stuck his thumbs into his waistband and bent to pull them to his ankles.<br />
&quot;I always knew you were packing, but damn!&quot; Janet said looking down at Nate&#39;s slowly swelling pride and joy.  &quot;Obviously you&#39;re getting the top end, Nate,&quot; Janet continued, &quot;this is all weird enough without me getting plowed by my brother in law.&quot; Janet giggled, as she reached up and squeezed Nate&#39;s gargantuan biceps.<br />
<br />
Nate looked nervously up at Matt standing across from him and was put at a bit of ease when he saw Matt grinning at him with a look that said, &quot;can you believe this girl??&quot;<br />
Janet quietly said to the both of them, &quot;ready?&quot; in a sultry voice before going down on Nate and feeling Matt almost simultaneously enter her dripping lips.  All three adults groaned in pleasure as the men closed their eyes lost in immediate pleasure.  Janet was overcome with lust as she took as much in her mouth as she could while feeling her husband fill her perfectly.<br />
After a few moments of pleasure, Matt and Nate opened their eyes and grinned at each other.  They couldn&#39;t believe this was happening.  They high-fived in that moment knowing this was as unbelievable as it was absurd.<br />
<br />
In this moment of pleasure, Matt&#39;s subconscious got the better of him.  He began imagining deep down how much his wife loved a big, powerful man.  This tight and toned Mr. Olympia physique was hot to her, sure, but he knew she loved a power gut and bloated muscles to match, thinking back to what she had done to him earlier in the afternoon.  His body responded in kind as he closed his eyes and swelled larger with almost no knowledge of it happening.  His thighs pressed together as he thrusted, his ass growing outwards as his gut started to press outwards and his large lats and biceps and triceps made gripping his wife&#39;s waist a challenge.<br />
<br />
Nate, in his still slightly uncomfortable state of being sucked off by his brother&#39;s wife, kept his eyes open enjoying the pleasure.  As he looked across to his slightly shorter and smaller older brother he subconsciously saw him growing larger.  Having been the physically larger brother for so many years now, he was subconsciously off-put by seeing Matt rivaling his size.  His own body with the ointment pumping through him began swelling as well, only this time it was different.  His flat and ripped abs started to take on his brother&#39;s tortoise shell shape as it puffed outwards along with all his other muscle groups.  <br />
<br />
The growth enhanced the pleasure both brothers were feeling, and in turn Janet&#39;s as well.  They all three closed their eyes as they were overcome with the sensations.  Before long, all of them were nearing climax.  There was an issue, however.  Matt could no longer grip his wife&#39;s waist, so large had his body become.  His hands couldn&#39;t hope to reach around the enormous pecs and gut, let alone come down far enough with his monster lats in the way.  Janet was having a harder time taking Nate as his own gut was swelling larger and gravity began pulling it down slightly onto her head, each time she moved her forehead knocking into the lower sweep.  Her chin also kept brushing his mammoth thighs.  Still, all of them lost in pleasure, pushed these things aside as they kept at it.<br />
<br />
It was only when both Nate and Matt felt an odd brushing at their navels that they opened their eyes lost in pleasure and after a moment of confusion they both threw open their eyes as wide as possible as they looked across at each other&#39;s bulbous and swelling forms.<br />
<br />
Both brothers had ballooned outwards in every muscle group, but particularly the tortoise shell guts.  So much so, that their juicy pecs rested on top, with their nipples almost invisible folding underneath and stuck up against the top of the gut.  The brushing feeling they had felt was each other&#39;s distended abs touching each other.  Even from over three feet apart their guts touched.  They stood staring at each other still thrusting at Janet who was now lost somewhere below the two enormous guts.  She seemed to be completely unaware of what was happening above her.<br />
<br />
Seeing each other&#39;s huge forms, sent both brothers into a growth frenzy.  Matt due to seeing an inspiration in front of him of what he was trying to be, and Nate due to seeing his brother growing larger than him.  Their muscles continued to swell and their guts pressed harder and harder into each other as they stared, unable to control themselves.   They were slowly being tipped back as their bellies grew into each other.  Janet struggled to continue to pleasure the men but felt the climax ebbing away as she was finding it harder and hard to reach Nate&#39;s big prick while also taking her husbands large member at the south end.  She opened her eyes as the pleasurable feeling was ebbing and of course saw only flesh in her field of vision.  Hard, cut, and thick muscled legs and obliques surrounding Nate&#39;s crotch.  For some reason the room seemed darker than it should too.  She reached up to try and get a sense of what was going on, but her hands instantly ran into a rock hard ceiling that was warm to the touch.  It pumped steadily larger in her hands.  Suddenly Janet could no longer reach both men.  Nate slipped from her mouth, as her husband popped out of her dripping crotch.  Both men snapped out of their growth-fueled stupor to realize they were both falling backwards, their guts pressing so hard into each other that they lost balance and were toppling backwards.  Both cried out as they flailed enormous arms that crashed into their heads and pecs as they both fell backwards in opposite directions, great wrecking ball-sized bodies tumbling back.  They tried to step back almost mirror images of each other but both men&#39;s quads and hamstrings had swelled as well, crashing into their gigantic bubble butts and prevented the step back.  So, there was no where to go but straight down.<br />
<br />
They hit the floor almost simultaneously with a double loud crash and jiggling unflexed ballooned muscles everywhere.  Both men lay there like starfish, looking at the ceiling panting, dicks pointing straight up, both unable to see over their enormous chests, let alone the mountains of muscle that made up their guts.  The growth had subsided now that they were out of each other&#39;s field of vision.<br />
<br />
Janet clicked her tongue from somewhere beyond both their guts surveying the two mountains of meat on either side of her as she bent over and traced the veins running up each man&#39;s calves.<br />
&quot;Well, well, well, gentleman.  It seems your fantasies got the better of you... What&#39;s a girl to do now?&quot;</p>
