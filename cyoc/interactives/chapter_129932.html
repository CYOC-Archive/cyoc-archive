<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It took nearly a week before we got the chance to spring our plan into action. One day, Jeff left a note in my locker: Jessie had gotten permission to take a week off from school to take care of some personal problems. She didn&#39;t want anyone to know, so the nurse had not gotten around to notifying any of her teachers. We needed to move before that happened.<br />
<br />
Just as my mid-afternoon class ended, which was also my last class for the day, I went over to the bathroom by the cafeteria, which had been closed last month for repairs that were never going to be completed until the end of the year. So I knew no one would be inside.<br />
<br />
I had already dressed myself using pictures Jeff had obtained of Jessie&#39;s various outfits. I&#39;ll be honest, a skirt and jacket doesn&#39;t look half bad on me, even though I&#39;m not nearly as skinny as she is. Once I was sure my clothes looked flawless, I dug through my bag for a wrapped parcel. <br />
<br />
Once I had my face on, I took the time to run a brush through my tangled, bushy mop of a haircut. I also put a necklace around my throat to hide a thin line of wrinkles that were quite conspicuous. I waited for my body to mature and stretch out until it filled the curves of my clothes. Finally, I made sure that my voice sounded both slightly immature and bossy before stepping outside in my new heels.<br />
<br />
It then that a golden opportunity presented itself to my new identity. Walking down the hall, in a tight formation, were the Little Ones. Or as they were otherwise known, the elementary school kids who all still looked like they just got out of preschool. They were short, easily spooked, and all terrified of Jessie.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s because for months, she&#39;d enjoyed scaring the crap out of them for her own amusement. Just the sound of her clacking shoes was enough to make them wet themselves. <br />
<br />
And as I expected, when they saw what they thought was Jessie marching towards them like a hungry giant, they tried to run away. Too bad the hallway had a dead end.<br />
<br />
Panicking and sweating, they braced themselves for when I...patted them on the heads and gave what I&#39;m pretty sure Jessie thought was a smile. With her lips, it looked like she just had a psychotic break.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, their fear began to lessen, and curiosity took over. They started tugging on my skirt and hair, apparently thinking that once they annoyed me sufficiently, I would rip their heads clean off. But no. I just crouched down so they wouldn&#39;t have to stand on the balls of their feet. <br />
<br />
Just then, the bell rang, and they took off. But not in a furious dash for safety. Instead, they just walked away, looking rather happy and satisfied. I knew I had a long way to go, but for a first go? Not bad.<br />
<br />
As the week went on, things kept improving. The Little Ones actually started looking for me at the end of their classes, and I would always be waiting, beaming with joy at the first sight of their chubby faces. They went from tugging, to hugging my legs, to finally letting me hug one of them. I made sure to show interest in what they wanted to talk about, showed them kindness, and did a few small favors for them. I really need to ask my mother for a bigger budget so I can have some extra pocket change.<br />
<br />
Then the week ended, and the school closed. The kids were sad when I told them I wouldn&#39;t be around for a while, that I had to help out a friend. But they understood. I could see it in their eyes.<br />
<br />
Then one of them, a girl named Lois, did something I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever forget. She led the Little Ones into giving me a collective hug as I sat there on the floor explaining. I could feel tears coming out of my eyes and rolling down my face. I was going to miss being a big sister to them.<br />
<br />
As soon as I was sure the school and anyone who went there was far behind me, I went behind some bushes and felt the sides of my face before slowly peeling it off. Underneath, I was caked with sweat and exhaustion, but I made sure to do my best and mop out the inside before packing it away.<br />
<br />
I went back to see Jeff. He seemed quite excited. Now, when the real Jessie returned, she would have a whole pack of happy kids waiting for her. Would she get angry and chase them away? Not if I had anything to say. I would step in, defend those kids, and remind her that she didn&#39;t have to be a bully. These kids cared for her, saw her as something special in their lives. If she was truly redeemable, she would realize that.<br />
<br />
But then Jeff told me something I didn&#39;t expect. Jessie wasn&#39;t coming back to school any time. She had just fled to her father&#39;s house after her mother tried to hit her with a wrench. I didn&#39;t know how he knew that. But now it was all clear: Jessie was so mean because she was simply taking this abuse and inflicting it on others. Maybe if that could be corrected, if her home life was improved, she&#39;d be better. <br />
<br />
I found myself pulling the mask out again and putting it back on. If anyone was going to solve this, Jessie would.</p>
