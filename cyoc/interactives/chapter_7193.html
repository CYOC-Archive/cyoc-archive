<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Carl wiggled strongly against Dick’s grip but the Bear man was significantly stronger than him and Carl could not break his hold. Dick took cover behind a large oak and hunkered down slightly to hide the bulk of his form behind the bushes. Carl was held facing forward, the massive paw covering his mouth, all he could smell was hot bear fur. <br />
<br />
As the Bear was concentrating on the approaching Human he felt something odd; a rush of pleasure. The Human he held was still squiring around but he was pressing himself into Dick’s groin. A low moan escaped his lips as the man managed to catch his shaft just right. The Human was breathing deeply as Dick could smell he was getting off on this. Dick tried to move and stop the Human’s wiggling but it felt sooo good and he’d just got the speed just right. His concentration lapsed somewhat as the pleasure grew.<br />
<br />
Ralph reached the ripped open tent and stopped, it had been shredded by something big and clawed. Inside was a deactivated mobile and a wallet, obviously dropped. Ralph stepped back away from the tent and took a good look around the clearing he was in. He could smell nothing weird, just the forest, then he caught something else….he took several deep drafts and got a rough direction. The smell was almost familiar and certainly made him partially horny. He walked towards the source of the smell when he heard another twig snap, he wheeled round before realising it was in front of him. <br />
<br />
Carl was getting really worked up; he could feel the big thick Bear cock rising behind him. The Bears grip was looser, not that he wanted to escape now. He wanted that Bear cock, wanted it bad. He had a secret he kept from Darren and Tom- he liked Furries, liked them a lot, and liked them in sexual ways. He got off at night thinking about them, jacking off over the idea. Stag were his favourite, with a massive rack of antlers, a huge muscled body, and a cock to die for! Tom and Darren knew he was gay, even if they weren’t, and were cool about it, but this obsession went far beyond what they knew or understood. He pressed himself further back into the growing cock he wanted this Bears cum all up his back, he could at least pretend he’d just pulled out.<br />
<br />
Dick could not help himself the Human had got him horny, he put his hand on the mans body and began to lift him up and down on his cock. He could feel the mans own erection through his jeans and with a small tug of them Dick pushed them down to the floor and grabbed the mans hard cock in his other paw. They were both breathing heavy and moaning. <br />
<br />
Ralph knew there was something ahead of him now, he could hear moaning. Was it a survivor of the crash?<br />
“Hullo” he called. He got no response but deeper moans, so he went closer, whatever it was it was right in front of him. He switched on his torch. <br />
<br />
Carl was ready to blow, the Bears paw was getting soaked with his pre-cum, and his t-shirt was saturated, his back slopping with the Bear seed. He pushed back harder, using his legs to pump up and down harder helping the Bear use him as its toy. If this was a dream it was a good one!<br />
<br />
Ralph’s light sliced into the forest and illuminated the last thing he ever expected to see. There was a man with his pants round his ankles, he was covered in sweat and pumping himself up and down, his erect cock held in the hand-paw of a huge squatting Bear. The huge brown furred grizzly had his head leaning back and the moans were coming from him. Ralph could only blink in surprise as he realised that the Bear was getting off on what the Human was doing, he could see the thick tip of the Bear’s cock when the man was ‘down’ Ralph’s brain was having trouble processing what he was seeing when, with a deep echoing roar the Bear came, sending a huge stream of cum up the Humans back to explode over his shoulders, into his hair and onto his own fur. The Humans came as well sending a stream of white cum arching towards the shocked Ralph. <br />
<br />
Ralph could only stare as the cum flew from both the cocks. The Bear came longer and harder coating the Human, his own fur, and the forest floor. Ralph felt someone grab the torch and instinctively tightened his grip; he turned to see what had tried to take his light and looked straight into the deep eyes of a Wolf. For the second time in as many minutes his brain was overloaded. He felt his dick go hard, and then fainted away. <br />
<br />
Water slapped onto Ralph’s face and he felt a soft hand gently tapping his cheek <br />
“Wha happened?” he murmured “I had the strangest dream” He tried to push himself upwards<br />
“It was no dream” a deep voice said. Ralph looked right at the face of a Bear, who was lying next to him. A panic reaction grabbed him but he felt strong hands grab him and hold him in place, titling his head back he saw the Wolf again. <br />
“What the fuck!” he shouted. <br />
“Calm yourself” the Bear said in his gravely voice. Ralph stopped struggling at the command.<br />
“This has got to be a dream” he said. <br />
“Afraid not” the Bear rumbled “there was an accident at a genetics lab earlier today. It was been mutating the wildlife and Humans it found. What you have seen is very real”<br />
“Er…..ah…..urm….” <br />
“I am Rob” the Bear said and extended a paw. Ralph could see it was shaped more like a hand than Bear paw, the claws were shorter and the thumb more developed. He took the hand nervously and shook. Looking at the face Ralph realised this was not the same Bear he’d seen earlier. From somewhere he could hear splashing water. <br />
“Ralph” he said nervously. Satisfied he was not going to run Moonrun took his hands from Ralph’s shoulders. <br />
“This is Moonrun” Rob said indicating the Wolfman behind Ralph. Ralph turned himself round and looked again at the sliver furred form. He felt something as he looked at those grey eyes, but he could not place what. <br />
“Er….hi” he said dumbly. The Wolf grinned at him and stuck out a hand like Rob had done.<br />
“Moonrun” he said.  Ralph shook and with a slight start realised there were 2 more Wolf people standing behind Moonrun.<br />
“How many?” he said. <br />
“We don’t know. In this cleaning alone there are 17 of us we….” Rob was interrupted by a splash of water.<br />
“Oh my lord” Ralph sat up quickly. There was first Bear coming out of the stream, his huge, bulky body shedding water as he came out. He shook, sending water flying in all directions. A third Bear wandered over to him, Ralph could tell that one was female. Then out of the forest came a whole herd of Stag, a squirrel, and a pair of racoons. From another direction came a Boer and a sow, and the now slightly cleaner Human. <br />
“It’s a zoo” he murmured to himself. He turned back to face Rob and the pack. <br />
“It’s not a dream” he said, then something accorded to him “oh my God. Ted, Carl, and John are out there! We gotta to get them” he jumped to his feet.<br />
“Hold on” Rob commanded again, pulling himself up to a sitting position. Ralph realised he was nearly 6ft tall sitting down. “Was yours the camp with the 4 Eurohike tents? You left a single bloke there to look after it?”<br />
“Yeah we did, how did you?”<br />
“Well the bloke in the camp is Ted Roosevelt and he’s a not a camper?”<br />
“Defiantly! How?”<br />
“We came across him earlier. He was tangled in the ropes of a tent. We sorted him out and left him with Smokey while we came to investigate the explosion. He should be safe”<br />
“What about the others?”<br />
“Sorry mate, no idea. Where did they go?”<br />
“Carl was going to the Ranger station for help, and John was going the other way towards the town. They both are used to the woods you see. I’m kind new at this”<br />
“Seems a silly plan if you have no training to go running though the woods” Moonrun said with a small growl.<br />
“We wanted to help” Ralph said to him, almost a whine in his voice. Why did he want to please this wolf? <br />
<br />
Rob stood up to his full 8ft something height.<br />
“Maybe Kern can help” he said and started walking towards Dick and the Stags. Ralph and the wolves trailing him.<br />
“Kern did you see anyone at the Ranger station before you left?” The biggest, oldest Stag turned towards Rob<br />
Kern shook his horned head “No afraid not. I left it locked up” he said. <br />
“Sorry kid” Rob said to Ralph.<br />
“You lost someone kid?” Kern said, his ranger training kicking in.<br />
“Yeah, my camp mates. One was going to the Ranger station the other towards the edge of the forest. We wanted to help with the fire”<br />
“Nobel son, but I think your friends are either transformed or captured. Sorry”<br />
“Captured?” Ralph said in a small voice.<br />
“Yes. The virus was from a government facility, they will seek to contain it” Rob said. <br />
“They may do worse than that” Dick said coming over. <br />
“How do you mean?” Moonrun said<br />
“Well……” Dick was interrupted by a huge explosion from the far side of the ridge behind them that lit up the night sky. Dick turned to Moonrun “you’re the quickest, find out what that is” he commanded.<br />
The wolves did not question the order they turned and lopped off moving with amazing speed and silence, even on two legs. Ralph felt a pining that he was not running with them. <br />
“Everyone else, stay sharp and alert until we know what that is” There were answering calls from the assembled animorphs.</p>
