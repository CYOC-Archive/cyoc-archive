<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan presented the design he had created to the Barry the tattoo artist. It was<br />
simple but visually striking design – a shield of six inches in diameter<br />
bearing the words “Property of Master Dan” and the head of a longhorn. Like all<br />
of Dan’s submissives would wear his collar for the rest of their lives, so too<br />
would they be branded.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Marcus, Patrick, Angus. This is the tattoo that Barry<br />
here is going to tattoo onto your lower backs. Upon receiving your mark, you<br />
will be fully my property forever.  Consider<br />
this to be the final step of your initiation to being my submissives, you will<br />
be born again, leaving the rest of you behind. You won’t be going home to<br />
collect your things, you won’t be announcing your departure. Your entire life<br />
will be dedicating to service me. I will become your world.”<br />
<br />
<br />
He looked at his pups, each of them totally<br />
horned up, their respective clothes becoming wet with precum. They looked too<br />
eager to please, Dan could have done anything to them right now and they would<br />
have smiled gleefully and thanked him and asked for more. “Consider this your<br />
final opportunity to leave. Don’t get me wrong I would be extraordinarily disappointed<br />
if you chose to go, but I could understand why. It is a massive commitment, not<br />
any submissive could do it” said Dan.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The idea of doing anything that would disappoint their<br />
Master in any way shook the three pups in a way which was so profound and so<br />
sudden that the three had tears welling up in their eyes. They hadn’t even done<br />
anything wrong – Dan had only just suggested the possibility of disappointing him.<br />
Dan was moved by the outpouring of emotion, at that moment he felt a<br />
great sense of honour, responsibility and duty over his pups.<br />
<br />
<br />
The thought of going back to who they were seemed<br />
inconceivable. The idea of doing any life other than the one their Master had<br />
selected out for them was unfathomable. These pups needed their Master. They<br />
needed their Master’s mark on them as soon as they possibly could. <br />
<br />
Despite the fact they were all dressed (in respectively skimpy outfits) they all suddenly got a sense<br />
of just how naked they were. The only way to correct this exposure was to get<br />
Master’s mark on them immediately.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
“Excellent. I’m so glad you feel the way you do. You<br />
are all very welcome to be part of my family. You should all be very proud.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
With that his pups had a complete turnaround in<br />
their feeling, their eyes lighting up, their faces blushing and their cocks<br />
shifting about slightly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dan gestured for his pup’s to lean forward. He<br />
moved up to each of pups and gave them all a long and passionate kiss. Dan explored<br />
all their mouths, getting to understand their kissing styles, the feelings of<br />
their lips, the flavour of their saliva. Dan found this the sensation<br />
overwhelming, their tastes addictive. As Dan kissed each of his gingers their<br />
cocks rose to their full length. This didn't pose an issue for Patrick – he was wearing his<br />
kilt, not so much for Angus’, his jock strap was catapulting across the room with dangerous velocity. Marcus’ <br />
erection caused his cock to burst through his wrestling suit. Their red and throbbing<br />
cocks oozing precum immensely.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Dan could have easily made his pups erect just with<br />
an approving smile and a light touch, so sensitive they were their Master’s<br />
advances. As he kissed each one their breath deepened and they moaned with pleasure, their minds in<br />
complete sensory overload. Dan took each of them to the just before their threshold<br />
and would then whisper into each of their ears “Don’t Cum. Not yet”.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
With that utterance,  he would gesture for each of pups to<br />
turn their heads to the side. Dan bit down on their necks savouring the<br />
saltiness of their sweat and the musk arising from their sexual ecstasy.<br />
He sucked on their necks hard leaving richly deep purple marks.<br />
Dan felt deeply proud of the less permanent brands he<br />
had left on his property. They were to get their permanent marks all too soon.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Patrick and Marcus grimaced hard, focussing on<br />
everything they had on fulfilling their Master’s order. They successfully denied<br />
every natural feeling that was inside them, just as they had been taught to by their family.<br />
Their faces were red and flushed afterwards.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Angus however was not so disciplined. This was the<br />
most intense sensation he had ever known. It was also first time his Master had<br />
granted him pleasure such as this before. It was all too much for him, Angus<br />
scrunched his face unable to prevent what he knew was about to come next. He<br />
moaned loudly as he ejaculated sending gallon after gallon of his own cum<br />
across the room, across the floor and splattering onto Barry the tattoo artist. After eight<br />
powerful bursts cum continued to dribble out from the tip of his cock for another<br />
few minutes, returning to his regular enormous flaccid state, his balls<br />
refilling again for another load.<br />
<br />
<br />
Angus had such a look of disappointment upon his<br />
face. “I’m so sorry Master, I violated a direct order. I’m so sorry Master. I’m<br />
so sorry. I tried my best and I’ve failed you”.<br />
 <br />
He dropped down to his knees before his Master, his khakis completely soaked<br />
in his own mess, his cock and balls colliding with the ground with a wet<br />
*plop*. Angus had tears pouring down his cheeks, he was sniffiling and had<br />
mucus drooling down his nostrils. Angus attempted to hold back the wailing without<br />
and success.  He was truly a picture of anguish, a fallen giant.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He wrapped his tightly arms around his Master. He<br />
was unintentionally crushed his Master. He held his head against his Master’s<br />
chest, his shirt becoming soaked through with the young bull’s tears. “Please<br />
don’t leave me. I’m sorry I disobeyed you. I love you. I need you. Please don’t<br />
abandon me. Please don’t stop being my Master, I beg of you!” he cried between<br />
wails.        <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly, for Dan it had been one of the most erotic<br />
experiences he had experienced in his life. Angus was such a fusion of<br />
innocence, strength and sexual power. He wouldn’t allow his pup to know his real feelings though, <br />
instead he held his pup closer to him, running his hands through his thick red mane.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
“It’s okay. It’s okay – he reassured. “I know you<br />
didn’t mean to do it. You’re still my pup. Nothing is going stop that. Do you<br />
trust me to do what’s best for you as your Master?”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Angus nodded still holding his head against Dan’s<br />
chest, his grip around Dan softening. His wailing stopped but he continued sniffling.<br />
“As your Master it is my job to teach you. I have an idea. If you’re willing to<br />
learn I can help you.” Reassured Dan “Now compose yourself and stand at<br />
attention with your brothers” he continued.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He let go of Dan and picked himself up and stood<br />
with Marcus and Patrick. Angus was a mess of tears and his own semen.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
“Ahem!” coughed Barry to attract Dan’s attention.</p>
