<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Yuriko&#39;s thoughts raced as she sprinted towards Ben&#39;s apartment. The idea was so simple, it shocked her she had thought of it sooner. Rick Morgan, the dark wizard, was connected to the Moreland assault. Since he was dead, why not just ask his ghost?<br />
<br />
The idea seemed beautiful in its simplicity. Yuriko and wizards in general were aware of the afterlife, in fact some of the most prominent figures in the supernatural world had direct contact with the realm.<br />
<br />
Jack Martin and Annie Pendragon ruled various levels of the underworld. Tatsu, lord of the kitsune, spoke to the spirit realm, heck the embodiment of Life and Death owned a mortuary in her hometown. The only problem for Yuriko, she wasn&#39;t exactly sure how to ask. That&#39;s where Yuriko&#39;s trump card came into play.<br />
<br />
Akira.<br />
<br />
During the Timeline War, Akira made it his personal mission to rescue an infant Yuriko as well as Mia and Zack. When the war ended, the five tail kitsune became the guardian of the next generation of wizards. The title itself wasn&#39;t official, but the various supernatural realms recognized the kitsune as a protector, and it was a position Akira took very seriously.<br />
<br />
Throughout her life, Akira was a watchful guardian. He protected Magic High as it&#39;s head of security. Magic High in itself was a grand experiment for the supernatural realms, bringing together the children of the great rulers under one building. It helped usher in an era of peace. The prejudice attitudes and stereotypes that various supernatural realms had of one another gradually melting away. For this, all leaders viewed Akira as an interdimensional ambassador. He was respected by all leaders, helping to broker peace agreements that had kept major wars breaking out between realms.<br />
<br />
Still, Akira did have favorites, namely Zack, Mia, and Yuriko. For the kitsune, those three were the reason for his new life. When he first set out to rescue them, he was at his lowest. Defeated by wizards after attacking the hotel that Katie and Kellie Carlson were married at. Acting as Fukushu&#39;s second in command, he had been charged with attacking the wizards and their friends, eventually fighting Sgt. Cole Harris. The attack failed. Akira was stopped and Fukushu fled the area leaving most of his loyal troops behind. Those troops were shunned by the kitsune. After all, Fukushu attempted to murder his mother, Lady Shizen. If Fukushu was not there, then Akira and the others would feel their wrath.<br />
<br />
Finding Yuriko and the others became the second chance Akira needed. As the war neared it&#39;s crescendo, the kitsune found himself dueling Casseus with the lives of Yuriko and the others on the line. Despite nearly losing his life, Akira decapitated Casseus, saving the wizards and becoming the guardian.<br />
<br />
Since then, Akira always looked out for the trio. They gave him a second chance and in return he viewed Mia, Zack, and Yuriko as his adoptive nieces and nephew. Yuriko always found it humorous to some extent, referring to the six foot kitsune warrior as Piccolo sometimes. Unfortunately, Akira wasn&#39;t familiar with DragonBall, meaning the nickname went over his head. Still, if Yuriko needed something, she knew Akira would do his level best to help.<br />
<br />
Reaching Ben&#39;s apartment, Yuriko now tore through her jewelry box looking for a very special item. Years ago, as a gift for starting high school, Mia and Zack left Yuriko a small coin. The coin itself was enchanted, a spell Mia had learned from Rei MacGregor. Whenever Yuriko pressed it firmly, it would summon either Mia, Zack, or Akira based on the young woman&#39;s desire. Picking it up, Yuriko grinned as she pressed it firmly summoning Akira into Ben&#39;s apartment. Quickly explaining herself, Yuriko anxiously awaited Akira&#39;s response. Surely he could help.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry Yuriko but I do not think I can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?!&quot; Yuriko exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would not even know how to summon a ghost,&quot; Akira replied. &quot;There are only a few that can access the spirit realm. Have you tried speaking with Life or Death? They may be better equipped to handle this request.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yuriko shuddered, she knew who the couple were. Life and Death owned the mortuary in town, Yuriko having spoken to them on a few occasions. The problem though was, Yuriko was creeped out by the pair. After all, Life and Death weren&#39;t just gods, they were cosmic entities. Everytime she spoke with them, she felt as if they were gazing into her very soul.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;d rather not call on them,&quot; Yuriko stated. &quot;I don&#39;t know why, but...they just creep me out everytime I talk with them. It&#39;s like....they&#39;re reading me like a book or something. I don&#39;t know...its weird okay? Do I have to come up with an actual reason?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Akira said slowly. &quot;However, if you are to be responsible for training the next Catalyst you should know every significant being throughout the realms.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah see that&#39;s the other reason,&quot; Yuriko grumbled. &quot;That whole, &#39;Destiny&#39;, thing. Those two can see my entire life and my death. They probably know what I&#39;m going to say before I do. Last thing I want is to feel like an ass asking them questions they&#39;ve known I was going to ask since I was in freaking preschool.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Still fighting against destiny I see.&quot; Akira sighed. &quot;I understand, it is a burden, however, I have heard that destiny is not a matter of chance, it is a matter of choice, Yuriko. Perhaps one day you may come to terms with the responsibility. For now, we shall pursue other options.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yuriko thanked the kitsune, watching him rub his chin thoughtfully. The conversation about destiny was a sore spot for Yuriko, and a frequent topic. It was also a topic Akira understood. He had prepared himself to eventually become the Ninth wielder of the Dragon&#39;s Tongue, perhaps the highest honor amongst the kitsune. Instead, Akira found himself as the guardian, a title that while prestigious did not carry the weight of wielder of the Dragon&#39;s Tongue...at least for kitsune.<br />
<br />
Still, Akira accepted this position. He was destined to protect the next generation of magic, he just hadn&#39;t realized it until later. Despite the twist in his fate, he wholeheartedly embraced what he was meant to do. Hopefully, Yuriko would do the same...just not today.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe I have an idea.&quot; Akira stated.<br />
<br />
Yuriko sighed in relief. &quot;Okay I&#39;m all ears?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lord Tatsu is able to access the spirit realm using the Dragon&#39;s Tongue,&quot; Akira said. &quot;It is possible for him to take another within its borders. From there, you should be able to speak with whatever spirit you wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
****************************************<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely not.&quot; Tatsu said to Yuriko and Akira as he looked up from a scroll.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-Wh-....b-b-b-b....why?! Lord Tatsu this is of the utmost urgency and importance in solving a years long case between Yuriko&#39;s Harris family, the Moreland family, and the Tepes.&quot; Akira explained as Tatsu&#39;s ears perked up at that for a moment as he handed the scroll off to another kitsune who was standing by him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve heard what&#39;s been happening lately with the Tepes family, but from what I&#39;ve also been hearing they&#39;ve also come to a truce with each other, so as far as I&#39;m concerned there&#39;s no reason to take Yuriko to the spirit realm when I&#39;ve got other matters to attend to. Shizen and I are still helping those outside the capital recover from the recent civil war. Then on top of that, I have to choose new leaders to replace those who were killed during the war.&quot; Tatsu explained as the three walked through the halls of the capital.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I wish you would have summoned me my Lord,&quot; Akira added. &quot;I was a soldier in the Dragons Army for centuries. My skills could have prevented many needless deaths.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are far more valuable as an ambassador to the realms Akira,&quot; Tatsu countered, offering the five tail a soft smile. &quot;And while your skills are always welcome, what you do outside our kingdom is far more valuable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lord Tatsu, I&#39;m trying to help solve the long mystery of why a vampire attacked a young boy, and the person I need to ask, a former dark wizard is in the afterlife. He&#39;s the only one who could give me the answers I need.&quot; Yuriko said.<br />
<br />
&quot;He may have the answers, but he may not give you any answers. Those in the afterlife are not always helpful. You say he&#39;s a dark wizard? So why would a dark wizard ever help those he considered his enemies? I&#39;m sure he&#39;d rather you be left with more questions than answers and when you die, he&#39;d just torment you in your own afterlife. My answer still remains &#39;no&#39;.&quot; Tatsu said shaking his head.<br />
<br />
Yuriko and Akira were at a loss as to how to convince Tatsu at all, that was until they saw Shizen speaking with a few servants on where a painting could be hung up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, that&#39;s it, just a little higher, higher than that. No, that&#39;s a little too high. Lower, now, yes, that&#39;s perfect right there.&quot; Shizen nodded as the three came up on Shizen who was admiring the painting.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s this portraying?&quot; Yuriko asked looking at the familiar characters in the painting.<br />
<br />
&quot;This was made by one of the soldiers on the field. He&#39;s also an artist and he surprised me this morning when he brought this painting to our doorstep.&quot; Shizen explained.<br />
<br />
It showed a picture of Kari Harris, Haley Harris, and who Yuriko thought looked like Mason, but he looked also to have half a wolf&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s that?&quot; Yuriko asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, believe it or not, that&#39;s your cousin, Mason. It seemed he found and formed a bond with a magical dog of Norse origins. They also discovered they can fuse into a hybrid wolf. This painting shows the three of them showing mercy to Hinata at the end of the war. The soldier said to see the very sight was awe-inspiring.&quot; Shizen explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s Mason? I never thought I&#39;d see him being a war hero.&quot; Yuriko said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I never thought I&#39;d see the day either when my baby grandson was admired by our soldiers. But we never really know what our destinies are.&quot; Shizen said wiping a tear of joy from her eye.<br />
<br />
Yuriko and Tatsu looked at the painting with different with different thoughts racing through their minds. Yuriko was surprised one of her youngest cousins she had babysat would be regarded as a war hero, while Tatsu looked at the painting with pride and a little smile. He then took a deep breath and sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, I&#39;ll allow you to journey with me to the afterlife and find this Rick Morgan. But I want your agreement on something.&quot; Tatsu said looking at Yuriko.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, what is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The afterlife is not an easy place for mortals to tread through and it may be maddening for some. So if you are to do this, you must stay by my side at all times in case of any dangers you may find on the other side.&quot; Tatsu explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, I won&#39;t leave your side.&quot; Yuriko said nodding his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;One more thing. When I say we are leaving, we&#39;re leaving, we&#39;re not to say a moment longer.&quot; Tatsu said as he narrowed his eyes towards Yuriko.<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand.&quot; Yuriko said with a stern look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well. Come then, I need a moment to prepare.&quot; Tatsu said as he went to the Dragon&#39;s Tongue.</p>
