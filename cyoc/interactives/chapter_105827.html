<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After Melissa drops Julie off for school she drives around aimlessly around town for an hour. Suddenly her phone rings. Pulling over to see the caller I.D is A. Cooper. Melissa feelings from last night begin to bubble up. She had felt aroused when Alyssa offered to engage in some one on one time with her. But at the time Melissa could not conceive to give an answer. And after her bout of stress relieving sex with Martin this morning, seeing Alyssa calling her just confused her more. Letting the call go to voice mail Melissa thinks for a minute then decides to call the one person she thinks can help her.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Dr. Francis was just settling down in her office when her phone rings. Seeing Melissa Stovall as the caller she answers. Only to find on the other end a sobbing Melissa in need of some help.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Alyssa was lying in her hotel bed, naked and pleasuring herself with a vibrating dildo. Holding it in one hand and guiding it to her nether lips, she used her other free hand to call Melissa. The phone rings but all she gets is a voice mail message.<br />
“Hello you have reached Melissa Stovall. I am either away from my phone or on a call. Please leave your name number and a detailed message and I will try to get back to you as soon as possible.”<br />
“Melissa. It’s me, Aly.” Alyssa responds seductively. “I was thinking of you coming over here to my hotel. Or me; coming over to your place for a day of fun. Either works.” Alyssa continues. “We both were wronged by Martin. Why not get together and make those wrongs into one loving lesbian right. Call me.” Alyssa hangs up and goes back to pleasuring herself. Gasping in pleasure as she hits a g-spot, waiting for Melissa to call back.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Melissa is in tears. Blubbering and crying, Dr. Francis Twist can barely understand her. Yet being the professional physiatrist she is, she is able to calm Melissa down enough for her to drive to her office for an emergency session. Hanging up her phone, Dr. Twist informs her assistant to put on a strong pot of coffee and to hold all calls. She lets him know that as soon as Melissa Stovall arrives they are not to be disturbed.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Melissa spent a good 5 minutes sitting in her car before feeling well enough to drive. She arrives at Dr. Twist’s office building in a few minutes and heads inside. A short elevator ride later and a trip down the hall; Melissa arrives at Dr. Twist’s office. She enters and is promptly greeted by the assistant. Talking Melissa’s coat, the assistant escorts her to the doctor’s office and heads back to his duties.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
Back at Moon Lake high, Julie is just arriving to her second period class. By now the entire school has heard everything. That fact is made clear when the class goes silent as she enters. With a sullen and depressed look she quietly heads to her seat. No one raises their voices. Whispering about what they heard and agreeing that Julie had it coming. Hearing all this; Julie runs out of the classroom enraged and in tears, as the teacher enters. The class erupts into laughter. <br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Melissa is sitting down in Dr. Twist’s office. She already empty one box of tissues and is nearly cleared out her second, while explaining everything that has happened thus far. Julie’s bad behavior, Martin’s cheating. Her sudden arousal towards Alyssa. And lastly the morning shower session with Martin.<br />
“It sounds like you still love your Husband. Despite the mistakes he made.” Francis comments. “The rather detailed description of your love making can best describe that.”<br />
“Well of course I still love him.” Melissa interjects. “I’m just. I’m just… I don’t know how I am with him! One moment I want to cut both his heads off. And another moment I just want us to go back to the way things was before all this happened.” Melissa continues. “I don’t want to divorce him. But I just don’t know what to do!” Melissa breaks down into another fit of tears and Dr. Twist gets up to grab another box of tissue.<br />
“Have you considered couples counseling?” Dr. Twist comments.<br />
Calmed down some, Melissa answers. “That’s one reason why I called you.” She continues “You already know the other reason.”<br />
Dr. Twist was about to respond but thought best not to. Both her and Melissa being college friends, Francis knew better that, that door closed the minute Martin entered into their social group. <br />
<br />
Melissa looks at Francis and chuckles. “It’s not that. Sure we had fun in college but that was then.” Pausing to blow her nose. “I think I also have feeling towards Alyssa.” Melissa plays the voice mail she got for both of them to hear.<br />
<br />
“I got this shortly before I called you. This is the first time I’m listening to it as well.” Comments Melissa<br />
<br />
‘Melissa. It’s me, Aly. I was thinking of you coming over here to my hotel. Or me; coming over to your place for a day of fun. Either works. We both were wronged by Martin. Why not get together and make those wrongs into one loving lesbian right. Call me.’<br />
<br />
The message ends.<br />
<br />
“Sounds like, she is actively trying to end your marriage.” Dr. Twist remarks.<br />
“It’s all come to this ever since she came back to town on ‘business’.” Melissa responds using hand gestures to quote business. <br />
<br />
Dr. Twist is silent for the moment. Reviewing everything she heard. Then she speaks. “There are two things I want to ask.”<br />
“Ask away,” Answers Melissa.<br />
“First. Would you, Martin and Julie be willing to come back here for group therapy? It sounds like the ‘entire’ family may benefit from getting their feelings out in the open.” Francis continues. &quot;It doesn&#39;t sound like divorce would solve the problems your family is experiencing. It would only just morph them into larger unresolved issues.&quot; <br />
<br />
“I will talk to Martin about that later today. I’m pretty sure he will be receptive to this. Especially if it will save our marriage. Julie might be a hard sell.” Melissa continues. “Lately she has be belligerent, lying, scheming and up to no good. And a lot of that has to do with trying to break up Spence Lawson and Eric Anderson.”<br />
“I see.” Dr. Twist thinks to herself; reflecting on the events that involved those two families. “My second question. When was the last time you took your were birth control pills.”<br />
<br />
Melissa is taken aback by that question. “Why ask something personal like that?”<br />
“I only ask because you said yourself. You have been under a lot of stress the past few days. What with your daughter, your husband and Alyssa. And let’s not forget; the passionate act you had this morning in the shower. When under stress we have a tendency to forget little things. Such as birth control or appointments. And other tasks.” Dr. Twist responds. “Us weres’ have a high libido. We don’t have typical menstrual cycles like regular humans do. All it takes for us female weres’ to get pregnant is being penetrated by the male and being filled up by his seed. All the while, we are experiencing pleasure from our own orgasms. For us; Its one night, one shot. Mission accomplished.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa thinks for a few moments and then goes into her purse and pulls out her birth control pills. Looking at them she notices that the last time she took one was Friday. “Today is Tuesday right?” Shakily looking at Dr. Twist and handing her the pills.<br />
<br />
Dr. Twist looks at the package and sees Friday’s blister pack punctured but no other popped since. “I suggest you go and get yourself a pregnancy kit in a few days to confirm my suspicions.” Dr. Twist continues. “There is a good chance you might have conceived this morning and will soon be pregnant.”</p>
