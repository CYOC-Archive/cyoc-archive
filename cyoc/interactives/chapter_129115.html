<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Wild times and little sleep, he who was Mr. Jakes stirred awake on his fifth day of being at stud. He opened his eyes and yawned. He raised his head and looked around where he was lying. The surroundings he saw were not recognized to him as a hotel room, or any place he would pay good money to stay for a night. What he saw were rough cut or sawn board lumber, as all was unpainted and generally dirty with cobwebs and his bedding being dry straw.<br />
<br />
What Mr. Jakes did know was that his whole body ached as if he had gone on some crazy binge and got drunk. Everything seemed strange to him, as he moved more he felt the realization he was lying there naked as a jaybird. His being naked was to him an insulting situation he was not willing of or planning to ignore. He had to find his clothing, or any clothes, as the morning came with a damp feeling chill.<br />
<br />
He then sneezed and from his making such a noise he heard then what he knew were animals getting up from sleeping on a barn floor stall. Suddenly, he recognized where he laid, as he too was in a barn stall, a boxed stall with four walls and a rollback door. He then tried to sit up but found his body as not willing to do as he wished. He felt baffled for a long minute before his foggy mind cleared and he gained memories of him standing humped over the rump end of many mares, he screwing them!<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, I was drunk and out of my mind... mind, me, my name is Jakes, Ralph Jakes. I was born as the son of Carla and Frank Jakes. I never married, I wished to marry but never found a woman worthy. Why then did I go into bestiality and and have sex with horses?<br />
I got to get out of here before I am discovered and sent to jail.&quot; A sad Mr. Jakes still befuddled of mind and his memories struggled to rock his dull feeling self to then stand up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Up, stand up you stupid old man... ah-huh, what is this?&quot; Mr. Jakes thought as with some odd manner of struggling he rose up but stood then as on all fours; something he did not expect. He then snorted, and this woke his mind to remember Madame Illusia, the theater, the show and four mares he bought. He recalled more about his being shamed by the woman on stage, she magically undressed him to be naked on stage, and when he complained she cloaked his nakedness by magically changing his body to a black furred anthropic pony stallion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something more happened,&quot; Mr. Jakes thought as tried to recall. As he stood there concerned with his recent past and some fool reason for him being naked in a barn stall, he felt the urge to let go a fart. He farted, and loudly, as he thought so loud his fart it could awaken the dead. What he did not expect was the rank smell of his fart, and oddly the smelling on his own fart reckoned to him mind as if it were a pleasent, very personal odor.<br />
<br />
He became anxious to escape his place where he did not belong. Feeling nervous he took to flicking his tail and the coarse hairs of the tail trailing over his buttocks shocked him. <br />
<br />
&quot;What in Hell,&quot; he cursed, as giving a real look at what was his bodily self, he saw the body and legs of a black horse. <br />
<br />
&quot;I, I am a horse..., no, as on stage that magician woman changed me into an anthropic pony stallion!<br />
<br />
I have a horse tail, I am all black of body fur, I have four legs, four hoofs, still unshod are my hoofs, as is..., oh really!&quot; Jakes reasoning, taking a physical accounting of his body, he felt something stirring and as his pony stallion cock stirred and swelled, it moved into an erect state even he seemed to appreciate.<br />
<br />
&quot;She did this to me, changing me into a pony stallion, as it had to do with my leaving the Park. Did I agree to this? Four days, she said something about in four days after reaching the mainland I would change back..., but why would she do that for me. She took my check as payment for the for mares she created from four stupid, gulible girls. Some tricks, transforming people into horses, and those changed gain weight and body bulk, oh my, but my cock down there is feeling rampent for me to go find a mare and mate!&quot; Jakes thought, he had not dared to try and speak, as he expected to hear his voice as a whinny, and he was not looking forward to that being real.<br />
<br />
The banging sounds of metal pails, of someone talking to those in their stalls, wishing them a good morning and speaking as if the dumb beasts could understand human language.<br />
<br />
As the top half of the Dutch door was swung open, Jakes saw a pretty woman dressed more like a man in coveralls and wearing a T-shirt. She smiled up at him, he being the taller, and she said, &quot;Good morning there stud, you had quite the fun time these past five days. Here you go, this is a bucket of clean water and I will give you a scoop of raw grains in your food box. My wrangler and stables groom will be by to give you a quarter bale of fresh cut hay, and do a warm water washing to you cock.<br />
<br />
Oh hey there, you got an erection going already, quite differnet than when you were a human male. Yea, I know enough that the stock my father purchases from Pleasure Island were born as people, but shall never be human again. Don&#39;t know if it was magic as some suggest, or knowledge of science, but the livestock we get from there is intelligent when they arrive. Times being an animal, in animal form takes a toll on their intelligence, usually the males go dumb from mating often. The females seem to thrill having their pussy stretched, women like big cocks!<br />
<br />
Today you will get shod and the Vet will be by about midday to check you and the two mares who arrived here with you. Two of the mares, the Percherons my father sold to a horse farm servicing Mackinaw Island state park in up state Michigan. You and your two friends, those Quarter horse mares being the same heights, we shall put to use here. Oh here is our farm and we rent horses by the hour for people top get a horseback ride. I hope you like it living here, as here you will stay, unless you become as unrully and or injure someone, if that happens its off to the slaughterhouse and you know what goes there does not come out alive!&quot; She said, telling her new stallion where and of what Madame made of him.</p>
