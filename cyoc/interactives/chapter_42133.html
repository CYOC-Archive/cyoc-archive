<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rick was surprised by the blue glow surrounding the book. His surprise quickly turned to panic as he noticed that the glow was connected to him. He tried to brush it off but it spread over him. In his panic he tried to run but he tripped over a book that was still on the floor. He tried to regain his balance and at first he succeeded. He then started to walk backward away from the book and tripped over another book. This time he didn't recover and fell hitting his head hard. This caused him to lose consciousness. He didn't notice the light completely cover him and his clothes disappear. Nor did he feel the tingling as his hair grew down to his mid-back, his face shift, two breasts appear on his chest, shoulders slim, dick shrink, legs fuse into one appendage, and fingers lengthen.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------<br />
<br />
Dawn and Tanya both noticed the glow surround them in the nurses office. The glow surrounded them quickly and they didn't have time to let out a surprised yell. Within a second both of them were again unconscious.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------<br />
<br />
Dawn woke back up and looked around. She noticed that in one corner of the office there was a tank full of water and a mermaid. Her breasts were floating free. She saw that Tanya was awake and looking at the mermaid too. They looked at each other and Dawn could tell that neither of them knew who this mermaid was. Mrs. Morgan came in then and asked &quot;Did you girls have a nice nap?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I did&quot; Dawn replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;So did I&quot; Tanya said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good&quot; Mrs. Morgan said. &quot;It's almost lunch time. I'm sorry but you girls will have to eat in here. The principal is starting to think that it's not safe for you girls. Rachael was found in the library unconscious and at least her bikini top was taken. We'll have to wait until see regains consciousness to see if her bikini bottom was taken too before her legs morphed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Dawn asked without thinking.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what I mean Dawn&quot; Mrs. Morgan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah&quot; Dawn said trying not to arouse any suspicion. &quot;Guess I just forgot for a sec.&quot; She was surprised that Mrs. Morgan had used her name when before it was Mister Thomas before her transformation and Miss Thomas after. Something had obviously changed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've already called your parents as well as Tanya's&quot; Mrs. Morgan said. &quot;They agree that you girls should remain together until whoever it is that's taking your clothes is found. So you and Tanya are going to be coming and staying the weekend with us. Also, none of you are to go into the library at all since it has been happening in there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dawn was worried now. If they couldn't go into the library then they couldn't find the book. If the couldn't find the book then there would be no way that they could return to normal. The book could turn more people into mythics before they were allowed back into the library if they ever were. Suddenly, Rachael sat up and her eyes were wide in shock.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------<br />
<br />
Rick slowly swam back to consciousness. He noticed that there were somethings that were wrong. The first thing he noticed was that his legs weren't his legs anymore. Instead they felt like a tail. The next thing he noticed was that there was something on his chest. His nipples felt like they were farther out from his body than they should be. This was closely followed by the realization that he was underwater. He opened his eyes and saw that he was in some type of tank filled with water. There was brown hair floating around his face. He suddenly sat up in shock because he knew that he was female and he was underwater.<br />
<br />
His mother came over to him and putting her hands on his shoulders said &quot;Take it easy Rachael. You've been out for about a half hour. You suffered a nasty bump to the head. What happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I tripped over a book&quot; Rick said noticing his feminine voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rachael&quot; his mother said with concern in her eyes. &quot;You had put all the books back on the shelf. There were no books on on the floor. However they did find that the floor was wet. Your bikini top was taken while you were out so we think someone had poured something on the floor while your back was turned. Now, morph your tail into your legs so we can see if they also took your bikini bottom.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick didn't know what his mother was talking about but he decided that he should try. He found it easy to concentrate on human legs and he felt a tingling in his tail starting at his fins. He watched fascinated as they turned into feet and then his tail started to split and form legs. Soon the transformation had run it's course and Rick was sitting in the tank a completely nude teenage girl.<br />
<br />
His mother sighed and said &quot;Looks like you'll need another bikini. Which one would you like your father to bring you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm... it doesn't matter&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; his mother said. &quot;For now morph your legs back into your tail. I'll go call your father and have him bring you a bikini. Oh Dawn, Tanya, your mothers are bringing you some clothes for you to wear and your overnight bags.&quot; With that she walked out given them some privacy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Rachael&quot; Dawn said. &quot;Did you touch a book that glowed blue after you touched it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah&quot; Rick said a little stunned. &quot;How did you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The book got me and Tanya too&quot; Dawn said. &quot;I don't remember a Rachael Morgan in this school though I do remember a Rick Morgan. That wouldn't be you would it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's my name&quot; Rick said excited that someone might be able to give him some answers. &quot;What happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The book transformed you&quot; Dawn said. &quot;Do you remember anyone named Daryn or Tony?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; Rick said shacking his, or should say her head. &quot;Who are they?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Daryn was my name before the book transformed me&quot; Dawn said. &quot;Tony was Tanya's name before the book transformed her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just know you two as Dawn and Tanya&quot; Rachael said. &quot;You two have been the only mythics in school until now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I guess we've been dropped into a different reality&quot; Tanya said.<br />
<br />
&quot;If that's true then that book must be a portal&quot; Rachael said thinking. &quot;I wonder if we can get back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We won't find out soon though&quot; Dawn said. &quot;We can't go into the library until they find who's been taking our clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So we're stuck like this for who knows how long&quot; Tanya said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it so bad?&quot; Rachael asked who had morphed her legs back into a tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;You just had your gender and species changed&quot; Dawn said. &quot;Doesn't that bother you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really&quot; Rachael said. &quot;I've always been fascinated by Mermaids though I haven't met one. Now I'm a Mermaid and I figure I might as well enjoy it. I can stay underwater for however long I want and I'm a natural swimmer. I'll have to get used to being a girl but I will.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want to get used to being a girl&quot; Tanya said. &quot;I want to go back to being a Human male.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So do I&quot; Dawn said. &quot;Though I'm starting to think that we won't be able to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Tanya asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that the book may be only one way&quot; Dawn said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you think we're stuck like this?&quot; Tanya asked looking really freaked out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think she means that we can't get back to the realities we know&quot; Rachael said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right&quot; Dawn said. &quot;I don't know if we can return to being Human but maybe we can at least be male again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that would be an improvement&quot; Tanya said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I'll stay as a girl for awhile&quot; Rachael said. &quot;I've always been curious about what it was like to be a girl. Haven't you two been curious?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... maybe a little bit&quot; Tanya confessed. &quot;Though I didn't want to become a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I haven't been curious about what it was like to be a girl&quot; Dawn said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that your satchel Rachael?&quot; Tanya asked pointing to a satchel by the tank.<br />
<br />
&quot;It must be&quot; Rachael said. &quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I might see the book in there&quot; Tanya said.<br />
<br />
Rachael reached down and took out an unusual book that she didn't remember having before. She sat it on the corner of the tank and opened it.</p>
