<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“We need to move quickly,” Lilith stated. “Kitsune transform the children they kidnap into their own. Kellie and Jack maybe able to resist for sometime but eventually their essence will be absorbed.”<br />
<br />
“What about Mia,” Rexie exclaimed. Lilith turned her gaze towards the imp a stoic look on her face. “Considering the child is surrounded by magical beings it will take sometime before she too has her essence transformed. Therefore we must make haste.”<br />
<br />
Glancing at the large group Lilith began to formulate a plan. “Katherine,” she stated, looking at Kellies daughter. “I would suggest accompanying us along with Claudia, Mika and Merlin.”<br />
<br />
“What about me,” Kellie said, grasping her fiancés hand. “You need to stay here and look after that child of yours,” Lilith growled. “She is the reason we are in this situation. I will deal with Morgan later right now I need to find my son and destroy the Kitsune that would dare attack my child.”<br />
<br />
“We’re coming with you,” teen Katie exclaimed. Lilith narrowed her eyes as she gazed at the teenage girl. “I doubt your powers would help,” she spat. “Then I’m coming too,”Mary Elise said, stepping forward to join Katie. “Kellie is our friend. If the situation was reversed she would do the same for us.”<br />
<br />
“So Be It,” Lilith sighed. “But you do so at your own peril. Your welfare is not my concern. I only wish the return of Jack and the complete genocide of the Kitsune for this outrage.”<br />
<br />
Merlin, Lilith, and the others quickly began to journey towards the manor of the Kitsune leaving Marilyn, Morgan, Kellie, and Kellies friends behind. The group should be safe where they were, however, if the Kitsune made a move against them both Morgan and Kellie should be able to provide enough of a defense against the creatures. The journey itself seemed to only take minutes, despite the distance they had to traverse. Lilith and Merlin had magically increased the groups speed meaning they crossed miles of terrain in only moments. As they gazed at the manor Lilith now reached out with her magic, trying to determine what they were facing.<br />
<br />
“Can you feel it Merlin,” she whispered. Merlin nodded as he held out his hand. “Yes,” he stated. “They are several magical wards preventing entry to the grounds. Nothing we can’t handle though.”<br />
<br />
“Yes that is true,” Baba stated. “But can you feel the other magical presence around this manor. It appears she has foot soldiers. Quite a few in fact.”<br />
<br />
“Quite true,” Lilith whispered. “However dealing with them is mere child’s play. I will twist their bodies into mounds of flesh. The pain they feel befor oassing into oblivion will be excruciating.”<br />
<br />
“Yes but it will cost us time,” Merlin said flatly. “Time we don’t have.”<br />
<br />
“What do you propose then,” Circe asked. Merlin rubbed his chin thoughtfully as he studied the grounds. It had been quite sometime since he had to plan a siege of a stronghold. To be honest, he had given that responsibility to Kellie as part of her training. Now though his daughters life depended on his actions. He understood that he, Lilith and Katie would need to face the Kitsune but they would need a clear path to succeed. Smirking he now came up with an idea.<br />
<br />
“Lilith,” Merlin said quietly. “We need a distraction. I suggest Claudia, Mika, Rexie sweep around towards the left while Circe, Katie, Mary Elise sweep towards the right. They will draw the guards attention as you, me and Kat enter the manor. Once inside we will engage the Kitsune while Kat frees the children.”<br />
<br />
“If you think I’m srtaying outside while Mia is inside then you have another thing coming,” Rexie hissed. Lilith narrowed her eyes as she glared at the imp. “This is my son imp,” she growled. “We don’t have time for your personal grudges.”<br />
<br />
“And that’s my niece,” Rexie shot back. “Do with me as you will. I’m not standing idolly by while you go on a rescue mission.” Lilith stated into the imps eyes before a small smirk spread across her lips. Rexie was finally embracing her demonic side, she would not be controlled and would fight back when put under extreme stress. Still though Lilith could sense that the imp, despite her outburst, would remain loyal to her. “So Be It Rexie,” she said. “You shall accompany us inside the manor. Claudia, Mika, proceed on the left alone. Good luck to you all.”<br />
<br />
***************************************<br />
<br />
“How do we always end up in these situations,” Mika groaned as they quietly proceed around the side of the manor. Claudia could only shrug as she cautiously looked around the grounds. “Your Guess is as good as mine,” she whispered. “Guess it’s fate.”<br />
<br />
“Or a curse,” Mika grumbled. “You can sense it right? There’s at least five of them watching us right now. And more moving in.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah classic ambush,” Claudia mumbled. “Daddy would be proud. Now remember the plan. Wait for them to engage before we strike.” Mika could only nod as she grasped her fiancés hand, squeezing it tightly. As the two cautiously stepped forward they could hear a rustling in the nearby brush. Quickly turning the two college women observed movement. It appeared at least two of the creatures were now trying to draw their attention in anticipation for a sneak attack from behind or above. Claudia could only smirk as she now nodded towards Mika. <br />
<br />
“Now!”<br />
<br />
Claudia unleashed a fireball in the direction of the movement as Mika cast a spell, sending a series of icicles above and below their position. They two had planned for this eventuality and knew what they needed to do. Claudia’s flames struck true as one of the creatures now howled in pain, engulfed in flames as the smell of burnt hair wafted through the air. Mika’s spell also hit its mark, the Asian woman watched as a fox like creature crashed to the ground, impaled through the eyes and heart by Mika’s ice spell.<br />
<br />
“Take them,” a voice growled. Mika and Claudia turned as five more fox like creatures lept from the brush, quickly rushing Mika and Claudia. The two women’s eyes went wide as they gazed at the creatures. Needle like teeth gleamed in the sun, set in inhuman mouths. The fox like creatures moved with such speed that the two women had problems hitting their targets. Back peddling they tried desperately to bring them down, only to be tackled to the ground.<br />
<br />
“Your flesh shall make a fine feast for our new young,” The creature growled, saliva slowly dripping from his open maw. Claudia turned to Mika, seeing her fiancé struggle valiantly against the creatures. Looking at the creature she could only smile. “You would think so,” she said. “But we have a backup plan. Now Mika!”<br />
<br />
“Hey Scooby,” Mika yelled. The fox creatures stared at the two women in confusion, unaware of what was approaching.<br />
<br />
Claudia watched as the fox creature tried to speak before a large, hairy, claw pierced through the creatures chest, spraying her in thick blood. Wincing She watched as Fenrir now lifted the creature off of Claudia, blood and viscera dripping from the gaping wound in its chest.<br />
<br />
 “It’s clobbering time,” Fenrir roared as he lept at the creatures, sending their prone bodies crashing into a nearby tree. <br />
<br />
Mika had seen the wolf beasts vicious attack as it ripped the creatures limb from limb. Choking back bile she watched from underneath her attacker as Fenrir seemed to revel in rescueing the two women lives. Mika’s attacker was stunned as he watched his comrades torn to pieces before turning once more towards Mika. “It means nothing,” it growled. “He May have saved your friend but your death is certain.”<br />
<br />
“Think again,” Mika smirked.<br />
<br />
The creature had an unnatural look of confusion as it stared at Mika, unaware of the demon slowly approaching from above. Before it could strike Ayami landed on top of the creature, firmly grasping it as she hungrily stared at it.<br />
<br />
Mika watched as the creature shrieked in fear as Ayami began to feed on the creatures life force. Mika felt herself go pale as she watched the creature slowly shrivel under the succubus grasp. The creatures muscles seems to wither as it’s eyes slowly lost all color, going from Golden In color to milky white. As the last of its life left it’s body Mika watched as Ayami threw the withered husk of a creature to the ground.<br />
<br />
“Glad your on our side,” Claudia said as she tried to wipe the creatures blood from her face. Fenrir smiled eagerly as he now smiled at Ayami<br />
<br />
“Did you see that Ayami,” he growled happily. “I did it, I saved them, just like in the comics.”<br />
<br />
“You did great Fenrir,” the succubus said, placing a reassuring hand on the hulking wolf beast. “But the fight isn’t over. More are heading this way.” Fenrir could only nod, assuming a defensive position as he howled at the approaching creatures. Mika and Claudia could only shrug and smile as they prepared their spells. For the two women the last thing they expected was to fight alongside a giant wolf child and his succubus babysitter. Hopefully the distraction they were providing would give the others enough time to free Jack, Kellie, and Mia.</p>
