<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Ryan browesed through the endless rows of shoes, he came across a pair of cowboy boots. The tall kind that go all up over your calves. He looked at the bottom and saw they were size 13&#39;s. He always wanted to see how he would look in boots so he slipped them on. They were huge on him and he had tons of room to move in them. He stomped around like a toddler wearing his daddies boots. He started feeling a tingling in his feet. At that moment though, a bolt of lightning hit the store and traveled through the light in the dressing a struck him since the boots had some metal in the soles. <br />
<br />
The attendant was freaked out that he may had just killed a customer right when the transformation was beginning but when he peeked into the changing room, Ryan was still standing there. So he went about his business and let the transformation continue. <br />
<br />
Ryan however was feeling the effects of the Lightning. His feet were now tingling more and throbbing. The boots felt less and less roomy. Suddenly his feet started pressing against both the front, back, and sides of the monsterous boot. It was getting painful. He winced as his feet finally started ripping through the thick leather. His toes, heel, and sides just blew out the entire sole of the boot. He watched in horror as his feet were approaching flipper size. His socks were stretched so thin you could see skin through them. Finally those ripped as well and the growth slowed as his feet approached what looked like size 20&#39;s. <br />
<br />
Ryan didn&#39;t know what to do. His feet were now the size of a pro basketball players. He then felt a power course through his body like he had never felt before. It felt like an all over erection. He started hearing stretching sounds and something like running your hands over a balloon. He thought his feet were growing again, but as he looked down, his feet looked further away. He stood up straight and watched the top of the door approach his line of vision, match up with it, and then he was looking down at it. He looked in the mirror and only saw his torso which had elongated as well. His arms were approaching monkey length. If he had to guess, he had grown miraculously to about 7&#39;3&quot;. <br />
<br />
He started freaking out. Not only had he been hit by lightning, but he had grown into a giant of a man in minutes. His clothes were tight on his because of the body growth but still intact thank god. The boots that had come up to his knees were now at about calve height. But the growth had stopped. Or so he thought. <br />
<br />
He started hearing the sounds again, but this time it was deeper and thicker. The bottom of his legs started feeling constricted. He looked down and saw his calves inflating to the size of footballs. His jeans and the boots were getting so tight on them but they just kept growing. Slowly he started hearing stitches popping and realized his jeans were ripping, however the boots were basically welded to his skin. Not for long. With a long, deep rip, the leather split and he saw the biggest calves he had ever seen. Take Eric Fankhouser and Ben Pakulski and put them together and they might come close. He would never be able to wear high socks again. <br />
<br />
His thighs were now experiencing the same tightness. As he saw layers and layers of muscle building, he again heard the popping sound. With a loud crack, and a flurry of fabric his gigantic thighs just made the jeans explode. And yet they kept growing. He winced in pain as they started to touch and squeeze his balls. He cupped his less than average package and had to pull and put it on top of his thighs. He didn&#39;t know how he was ever going to find pants that fit again. The jeans he was wearing had been rendered into daisy Dukes in minutes. <br />
<br />
Next, his stomach started to flip and flex. He pulled up his shirt to see a rock hard group of abs appear. They started to push out a bit but still were ripped and solid. He counted 10 abs. A fucking 10 pack. He didn&#39;t think that was possible. <br />
<br />
His arms started to experience the same tightness and he saw his forearms start to grow with solid beef. Not to be overshadowed, his biceps and triceps started to growth wildly out of control. He wasn&#39;t even flexing and he heard his shirt slowly start to rip from wrist to shoulder. He feared cut off of circulation, but his arms were having none of that. Veins snaked up and down his trunks of arms. Huge veins. His arms had to be 26&quot; flexed of solid ripped muscle.<br />
<br />
He then started to feel like it was hard to breathe and it&#39;s because his shirt was starting to cut off everything due to his pecs, shoulders, and back and lats just exploding with size. At first there were sharp cracks of threads popping, like firecrackers. Then, his shirt just started ripping everywhere. It became ribbons and fluttered to the floor. Still he grew. His neck felt like he was being choked. He reached up and felt his neck triple in size. In fact, what neck. Everything was a column of muscle that went from one rock hard part to another. He felt like there was something stuck in his throat and reached and touched his throat. He felt a huge Adam&#39;s apple push out into his palm. &quot;I can&#39;t fucking believe this&quot; he said with such a deep voice it rumbled the mirror. <br />
<br />
Speaking of the mirror, he looked into it and saw a 7&#39;3&quot;, easily 450 pound God. Every muscle was cut and defined. Veins were snaking all over his body. <br />
<br />
He felt then like someone kicked him in the groin. He looked down to see the front of his left over pants start to swell with something. That something was him. Tight pinching and pain followed as his throbbing meat grew and grew. Finally it ripped it&#39;s way out of the zipper and underwear. His balls had grown to the size of apples and his cock had grew halfway to his knees, which was huge considering his height. It also swelled and thickened. He started to get hard and it inched forward, or more like foot forward and thickened even more. He had to be 12&quot; soft and 19&quot; hard and thick as a beer can. His balls started churning his newly transformed sperm with new levels of testosterone. <br />
<br />
All of a sudden, an intense itching gripped his whole body. He looked down and even though he couldn&#39;t see past his massive shelf of a pec chest, he could see thousands of hair growing out of them. He knew by the feeling that they were growing all over. His legs, cock, abs, chest, shoulders, even some on his back. It was growing so dark and thick it was hard to see skin through. However it did not hide the powerful size and strength of his now gargantuan muscles. His face started itching intensely as a thick but tightly groomed beard grew out all over his cheeks. His beard even joined up with his chest hair to make one carpeted pelt. <br />
<br />
Looking at the mirror, he could see himself now in full glory. He was massively huge, in both height and muscularity, hung like a porn star, and covered head to toe in the sexiest black body hair. It was enough he could grab it by the handful. <br />
<br />
Problem was he was completely naked as his clothes had been destroyed in the transformation. He yelled at the top of his lungs and with his foghorn like voice said &quot;I need help&quot;. <br />
<br />
The shopkeeper came running and as he approached the fitting room he saw the tops of the biggest and hairiest pecs he had ever seen. He went in and saw the giant that was now Ryan. <br />
<br />
Ryan said, in the deepest and sexiest voice the shopkeeper had ever heard, &quot;what the fuck happened and how am I supposed to leave since my clothes are shredded?&quot;  The shopkeeper had no answer nor explanation. This has never happened before where they shoes didn&#39;t transform to fit perfectly. It must had been the Lightning. However, words were not what he wanted to be in his mouth. He immediately dropped down and started sucking the massive cock. He felt it grow in his mouth, stretching his lips apart, inching down his throat. He could barely get half chugged down and he was an experienced cock sucker. Ryan bellowed &quot;I&#39;m not feeling your mouth. Let&#39;s try your ass&quot;. He flipped the shop keeper around and ripped off his pants and started pushing his massive tool into the shopkeepers ass. It was hard at first but someone he took it. After about 5 minutes, with the work up of the transformation and seeing himself, Ryan screamed and shot load after load into the ass. Mirrors rattled. Shoes fell off the walls. <br />
<br />
Afterwards, the shopkeeper found clothes that barely fit Ryan but did clothe him. A pair of size 23 EEE cowboy boots, tight wranglers, a XXXXL flannel shirt which looked like it had been painted on, a jockstrap that was a gag, but still hardly contained the cock, and a cowboy hat. Ryan said &quot;Thanks partner&quot; as he exited the store to become the next big porn star. The shopkeeper was left there wondering if this was fate or an accident, and started feeling pressure in his feet. He looked down just as his foot tore through the shoe and started spilling all over the floor.</p>
