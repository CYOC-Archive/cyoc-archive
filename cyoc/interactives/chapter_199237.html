<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a Sunday. It was fairly plain for a Sunday, and you were pretty happy with that. Something about nothing interesting going on was oddly relaxing.<br />
You’d just arrived at Skylar’s home, walking through the front door and into the house. You look to the left and spot Skylar’s younger sister, Mia.<br />
You and Mia didn’t have a great history, but since you and Skylar had started dating for real, you wanted to at least make a good impression on her,<br />
“Hey Mia,” you say, waving your hand gently. She looks back at you and smiles,<br />
“Hi!” Mia replies. You and Mia had somehow connected in a way, in a similar way that Skylar had a bond with her sister. Maybe it was something to do with you and Skylar’s connection (via the ring), but maybe you just got along with her pretty well, “can you do me a favour?” She asked you. You smirked,<br />
“Is this to do with the ring?” you asked,<br />
“Mhm!” Mia stated, “there’s a girl at my school who really likes ponies,”<br />
“Right,” you continued, making a few guesses as to where this was going,<br />
“Well… I want her to like me, so what if I was a pony!” You couldn’t help but snicker a little, “what!?” She replied, looking bummed out,<br />
“Mia, you have to remember that the ring doesn’t just make everyone like you,” you started, “you have to earn that. Why don’t you ask her about ponies instead of literally becoming one?”<br />
“W-well… I just thought she’d like me more if I…” she started stuttering. You picked up on this quite often, she always stutters when she realises something, “I-I guess so,”<br />
“I think you’re a really nice kid, I’d want to be friends with you,”<br />
“Really?” She said, looking at you with her eyes filled with wonder,<br />
“Actually, are we not already friends?” You ask her. She smiles sincerely,<br />
“Y-yeah… we’re friends,” she says, hugging you tightly.<br />
You were clearly the perfect boyfriend for Skylar. What kind of person manages to befriend their girlfriends difficult younger sister? The best boyfriends, that’s who.<br />
<br />
“You wanna be more modest?” Skylar asks you, poking her head around the corner,<br />
“What?” You question, standing up and offering Mia a high five as you walk away. She accents, slapping her hand into yours,<br />
“Your thoughts are super loud when you start worshipping yourself, ‘I’m the best boyfriend’, ‘I’m perfect!’” Skylar mocks,<br />
“Why do we have to share thoughts again?” You ask sassily,<br />
“Because it brings us closer, and we’re totally open… right?” She asks,<br />
“Yeah, obviously. Sky, I literally can’t keep any secrets from you if you’re always hearing my thoughts,”<br />
“Not always hearing them,” she said, “only when I want to. Same goes for you and my thoughts,”<br />
“Right… I do NOT want to hear what kind of things you’re thinking about,”<br />
“You don’t even need to read my thoughts to know what I’m thinking about,” she said, raising her eyebrows seductively, “but not right now. I wanna just relax,”<br />
“Me too,” you say.<br />
<br />
You and Skylar walk past the kitchen, seeing Skylar’s mother. As with your attempt at connecting with all of them (considering they can’t really get rid of you), you wanted to make an impression on Skylar’s mother… hopefully a positive one.<br />
“Hey Stephanie,” you say. You wouldn’t typically call her by her first name, but she actually insisted on it. She seemed much more open about everything. She seemed much calmer and less-occupied with maintaining her ‘perfect’ persona, now more focussed on doing things she enjoyed. She did seem to really enjoy baking, something she admitted she loved in her youth but gave up when she had Skylar and Mia,<br />
“Hello Yu,” she replied, “don’t mind me, I’m just baking some cupcakes with buttermilk icing,” she said, making the bowl and tray very obvious to see. Of course, she still loved the attention, but it was nice to see her work for it instead of expect it unconditionally,<br />
“They look good, I’ll have to see them when you’ve finished them,”<br />
“Oh, I‘ll make sure to save a few for you!” She says gleefully. You smile back and follow Skylar up the staircase.<br />
It was… odd seeing Stephanie in such a good mood all of the time. She seemed to have just accepted her reality, spending her unused time in much more important places that didn’t consist of reality shows and Facebook… although she still did find time for that. Her clothing changed from form-fitting and cleavage-showing to much more casual and comfortable. She would often be wearing a loose shirt and pyjama pants. She struggled to find much that really looked good on her as Skylar’s conditions stated that she’d never fit into any clothes properly, so clearly the more comfortable was the better. You could never help but look at her belly as it stuck out over her pants and under her shirt. As well as that, her breasts were so large sometimes that it was hard to focus on anything else. Alas, you were but a man.<br />
<br />
You looked at Skylar as she stood outside of her parents’ old room, now renovated (via magic) to you and Skylar’s likings. It was decorated nicely, with fine art over the walls and a great big bed in front of a very large television. Skylar waltzed into the room and jumped on the bed, snapping her fingers together, causing the TV to immediately switch on,<br />
“So just relaxing for now, right?” Skylar said,<br />
“Yep, sounds good to me,” you stated, you closed the door behind you.<br />
You hopped onto the bed beside Skylar and leant over to kiss her. You didn’t make out, but simply pecked her on the lips gently. <br />
<br />
You sat back and put your feet in front of you, allowing yourself to be absorbed into the TV…</p>
