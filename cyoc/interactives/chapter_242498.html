<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;How about we go for a quick jog? Help you get warmed up, &#39;Clara&#39;.&quot; She emphasized your mom&#39;s name. Your name. Both those thoughts were simultaneous, was this the mental change stuff your girlfriend was talking about? She changed demeanor a bit and you recognized it as your GF&#39;s normal kind.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll give you some tips on being transformed. But the short story is: It&#39;s VERY easy to be the person you appear to be. Including memories. Like put on an outfit you think your mom would be good for our jog!&quot; advised your GF. Noting is was still strange at times for your GF as Mrs Bradley to act as herself instead. &quot;Oh and first tip: Memories just &quot;come.&quot; It&#39;s not like an avalanche of info or a search, so don&#39;t worry about being overwhelmed. <br />
<br />
You nodded. You knew where to find the exercise clothes, and immediately went with a Sports Bra you switched out of your bra to, a matching set of gym shorts that flattered your butt over your panties. along with some docks and tennis shoes. You also went with a ponytail. This was so easy. <br />
<br />
The knowledge, the preferences of your mother, and even doing little things like adjusting your sports bra for a little more cleavage just came so naturally and with no need to pause and think. There was even a part of you being your Mom where you felt you should be more jealous of your GF&#39;s/Mrs Bradley&#39;s more fit body and you should exercise more, but even the decision to avoid exploring that thought, YOUR decision, took no time at all. <br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;s it feel, Clara? Like a glove?&quot; your GF said, obviously back to Mrs Bradley&#39;s demeanor. <br />
<br />
&quot;More like a skin, hun. Let&#39;s go jog!&quot; You responded just like your own Mom would.<br />
<br />
So you two went to jog around a route you both knew from your memories in a nearby park. Due to your Mom&#39;s body not being in quite as shape as Mrs Bradley&#39;s, nothing needed to be said about keeping to a slower speed. Even though your Mom&#39;s body was much different and curvier than your original, it was also effortless to jog like she would.<br />
<br />
Your GF had some discussions with you, having some mental exercises with experiencing your form. Talking like you would normally to each other, gossiping like your mom and Mrs Bradley would, and then talking like a filter, which was maintaining acting like your mom and mrs bradley would, but saying and doing what YOU actually wanted. That last part was a little hard for your GF to explain. She just referred to the example when she transformed to various women but still fucked the living daylights out of you. If she was completely acting like the women, they would be freaked out at being in your room and fucking a stranger. So of course she just used a filter and had fun with you, making it really feel like you were fucking the real Mrs Bradley earlier, although the real one obviously wouldn&#39;t fuck you. Or would she? You asked your GF and she said Mrs Bradley had some light attraction but nothing to follow up on. You decided to check out if your own Mom was interested in your GF, Mrs Bradley, and even yourself. Nothing lusty came up, although that didn&#39;t stop YOU from checking out Mrs Bradley&#39;s body and sometimes your own once in awhile.<br />
<br />
While going through the park, you saw some college guys playing Basketball. You thought about trying something perverted out, and gave your GF a heads up and she agreed to join in. You both stopped nearby and started the deed. <br />
<br />
You both performed stretches like you were preparing for another jog, and kept up a conversation like nothing was amiss. However, you were doing things like sticking your chests and butt out, never making direct eye contact with the guys as they were obviously enjoying the show you were putting on but not trying to &quot;catch&quot; them. Soon you finished with some juicy &quot;adjustments&quot; to your clothing, and you both continued your jog again.<br />
<br />
You finished your route and worked your way home, although knowledge of your own body or not, you were obviously getting very winded. Your GF seemed to notice and touched you on the shoulder, and suddenly felt like you hadn&#39;t just jogged and full of energy again, but still covered in sweat. &quot;I got you hun. Shapeshifting can do all sorts of things if I&#39;m creative enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
Soon you arrived back home, with you doing a very Mom thing with offering to drink some red wine you knew you had and both liked. You both settled into the living room to talk more about this whole shapeshifting and especially the mental changes. You decided to do a VERY not-Mom thing and take off your sports bra to talk casually, your GF cheering you on as obviously taking a transformation very well, even as weird as being your own Mom. <br />
<br />
As objectively hot as your own mom was, there was issues with being older. As young guy you knew you could do that past jog alot better, and going braless right now, you obviously noticed the sag in your boobs from age. Luckily your Mom knew her own body so your breasts weren&#39;t out of control while in the sports bra. Still, the whole thing ended up being a huge turn-on, and it helped your GF was completely on board for being super kinky. Speaking of which...<br />
<br />
You both went back to your room, and proceeded to start lezzing out. <br />
<br />
&quot;&#39;Clara&#39;, I suggest using the filter for this. It will blow your mind!&quot; said your GF, completely saying it as Mrs Bradley. <br />
<br />
You got the idea and as before, it came easy. &quot;Oh &#39;Jennifer&#39;. I can&#39;t believe you opened my mind to this. I feel so free!&quot; you said, channeling your Mom completely and even giving a vibe or nervousness with your body language. Acting like your mom and getting ready to get it on with your long-time neighbor just somehow mixed with the way you&#39;re talking with each other, even touching each other.<br />
<br />
You scissored, 69&#39;d, fingered, touched, licked, and anything else really. Your GF didn&#39;t try to use the energy burst again, so when you were both tired, you just laid together in the afterglow and cuddled. There was enough of &#39;yourself&#39; to experiencing being a woman for the first time in many ways today. It still never got old how neat it was to be yourself and your mom at the same time somehow..<br />
<br />
What came next...</p>
