<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After their intensive love-making, Jeff and Irae had both started to feel the pangs of sleep hit them both. It was strange considering how early in the day it still was, but Jeff figured thats how the life of a predator worked. Sleep, wake to hunt and feed, then sleep once more to conserve your energy, there really wasn’t any room for recreational activities. <br />
<br />
Of course, Jeff was quite content to sleep more with his mate Irae, who was already beginning to drift off, but then he heard it. A deep masculine roar off in the distance, one that unmistakably belonged to another tyrannosaurus, a male one at thay. Irae awoke instantly, and looked Jeff in the eye with a knowing look.<br />
<br />
“Different male.” She said, turning in the direction of the roar, her nostrils flaring up as she sought to pick up any scent of this new threat.<br />
<br />
Jeff instinctively let Jahff take the lead, and Jahff knew exactly what to do. Another male was a problem that had to be dealt with immediately. There would be no diplomacy in this, Jahff would confront the male, and either chase them off or demostrate the effectiveness of his claws and teeth.<br />
<br />
Jahff and Irae wordlessly set off in the direction of the roar, a roar Jahff recognized as belonging to a arrogant young whelp of a boy, who thought themselves strong enough to challenge anyone. It was an insult that this hotheaded youth would dare do this, and Jahff would discipline them soon enough.<br />
<br />
Upon reaching a grassy clearing, the sun now sinking into the afternoon, Jahff saw the upstart standing in the middle of the field. Immediately they could see why they had acted so brazen. The male was fit, impressively so for one so young. With deep green scales, and a naked powerful form that would’ve made any female salivate. The sapient dinosaur had the potential to grow into a prime example of the tyrannosaurus species. The whelp had likely grown amongst his siblings as the uncontested champion among them, which unfortunately created this false notion that they were unbeatable. Jahff sought to rectify this.<br />
<br />
With a snort of distaste, Jahff handed his spear to Irae who looked on towards the upstart male with a bemused look, she already knew who the victor of this challenge would be.<br />
<br />
Jahff strode onto the open field, stretching out his shoulders and he made his presence known to the upstart with his own roar, far deeper and more powerful than the younger dinosaur could pull off.<br />
<br />
He smirked as his roar had caused the whelp to flinch, if only for a mere second.<br />
<br />
The whelp turned to Jahff, already striking a pose to fight, growling as he watched the bigger male make his way towards him. <br />
<br />
“Name.” Jahff stated plainly. <br />
<br />
“I am Zark, I challenge you.” The younger male growled out.<br />
<br />
“You challenge bigger male. Leave now, or submit.” Jahff stated plainly. This younger male was of no threat to him. Even if he grew to rival him, by then Jahff would have already had several clutches of eggs with Irae. Zark would pose no danger to Jahff’s efforts to spread his brood. <br />
<br />
“Never, you smell of female. Your mate will be mine.” <br />
<br />
Dimly in the back of Jahff’s mind, Jeff noted that Zark was using language far more advanced than Irae. He was effectively speaking full sentences compared to his mate. Irae required a use of the Chronivac in order to reach her current intellect, yet Zark seemed to have surpassed her already. Had Jeff accidentally set the Chronivac to affect more than just Irae or was something else afoot here?<br />
<br />
Either way Jeff had no more time to ponder this mystery as he felt Jahff’s rage begin to boil. To so brazenly claim that they’d steal his new mate, that was unforgivable.<br />
<br />
“Fight me now Zark.” Jahff bellowed, and to Zark’s credit, this time he managed to steel himself and not flinch at Jahff’s overwhelmingly furious roar.<br />
<br />
Zark, either fearlessly or stupidly depending on who you asked, charged towards the older male, ready to prove himself.<br />
<br />
As expected, the fight barely lasted more than two seconds. Zark had leaped towards Jahff, claws aiming for his neck, when the wind was knocked out of him as Jahff turned, slamming his thick muscled tail into the dinosaur’s midsection and sending him sprawling onto the ground.<br />
<br />
In any other circumstances Jahff would have left the poor younger male as is, but a simple tail whip was not enough to satiate his rage, and lunged towards Zark. <br />
<br />
Jahff pounced, and before Zark could even process that he was on the ground, one of Jahff’s large claw was already wrapped around Zark’s neck.<br />
<br />
Zark roared out in fear and pain as he felt Jahff inflict his punishment, the older male wracking his claws across Zark’s chest, scales and muscle meaning nothing to Jahff’s strength. <br />
<br />
Three bloodied gash wounds were left as Zark cried out in pain once more.<br />
<br />
“Submit whelp.” Jahff growled to the Zark who laid below him in his shadow.<br />
<br />
“I submit…” whimpered Zark, the overconfident fire in his eyes having been immediately extinguished by Jahff. He closed his eyes and turned away from Jahff, <br />
<br />
Jahff felt Irae’s hand on his shoulder, and he felt him rage subside. Irae gently lifted Jahff’s faces, so that his eyes would meet her own. With a proud look on her face she lovingly gave her mate a tender lick on the snout. <br />
<br />
Jahff knew then that there would be more mating to do later. He grinned and released Zark, who stayed there on the ground, unmoving as the pain of his claw wounds left him nearly paralyzed.<br />
<br />
Jeff stood up, facing the afternoon sun as he pondered what to do with the upstart.<br />
<br />
The battle for dominance was much less a battle and more a reminder as Zark proved to be a trivial challenge.<br />
<br />
Should Jeff kill him? It was tempting, although Jeff was more level headed than Jahff, Zark had been too arrogant for Jeff’s liking. Killing him would be a quick and easy solution and would leave no loose ends for him to worry about. <br />
<br />
However… there was one possibility that upon thinking about it, made a certain part of him stir. He had won the battle had he not? Surely then he was in his rights to claim his prize? He looked over at Zark’s body. The dinosaur was certainly handsome. Young but still of breeding age. He certainly could make the dinosaur submit in two ways instead of just one. <br />
<br />
Although he wasn’t quite sure how Irae would feel about that. He knew it wasn’t uncommon for a tyrannosaurus to have more than one mate, but did that apply to males too?<br />
<br />
Of course Jeff could always wait for the Chronivac to recharge and make some… modifications to Zark’s body. <br />
<br />
After going over his options, Jeff decided to…</p>
