<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once they were outside again, Narissa took Ty&#39;s hand gently in hers and smiled warmly as they began walking together. Ty, for his part, was having difficulty with the kiss that had happened back inside. Forget that Narissa was able to project a three-dimensional trickery that made hid true lizard form. Forget that he could feel her human flesh in his as if it was real. Forget even the fact that he was really holding hands with an ancient 7&#39;2” lizard woman instead of a young girl around his age.<br />
<br />
“I liked it too,” Narissa whispered into his ear gently, giggling as Ty blushed a shade of red beyond embarrassment. His thoughts turned to the deeper questions. Like had he done well? Had he managed to arouse the lizard? Is that why she had looked flushed? Was she just messing with him? Was she interested in him? What would sex be like, anyway? Thousands of years of experience, she had said. He could never compete with that. And, of course, oh shit, she can read my thoughts.<br />
<br />
Narissa, for her part, only smiled wider as she offered no answers at all but clearly knew the questions. They continued walking in silence, as Ty actively tried to quiet his mind or at least conceal his thoughts. But he felt her constantly intruding. This was reinforced as she turned her head and raised an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
“Trying to keep me out?” She said quizzically.<br />
<br />
“A...A-Are we not going to talk about it?” Ty gulped finally, stopping at a bench on the sidewalk and sitting down. Narissa patiently stopped and sat next to him. “Don&#39;t pretend you don&#39;t know, either, you can see my mind as clearly as I can see you sitting there smirking.”<br />
<br />
“Well, we just met.” She said with an even bigger smirk, turning into a full-blown smile. Ty noticed her human face was uncannily weird to him. Though she was currently, outwardly, just pink flesh and a familiar human form, the angles of her face and the weird structure of her mouth just barely suggested what lurked inside. If you knew she was a reptile, you could almost see some hints of it. “You haven&#39;t even told me anything about yourself.”<br />
<br />
“Nor have you.” Ty sighed. “Look, this is all really confusing. I think we need to talk.”<br />
<br />
“In a moment.” She said, turning to regard the street they were on. Wordlessly, she pointed to a shirtless man in shorts and crocs mowing his front lawn, beer gut exposed and ear protection on his head. “Regard this gentleman here.”<br />
<br />
“What about him?” Ty said, confused, frustrated, but still willing to listen.<br />
<br />
“Do you think that he suspects his entire world is run by some elite Cabal of rich and powerful overlords?” She asked, leaning back against the bench and crossing her arms over a worn-in hoodie which wasn&#39;t really there.<br />
<br />
Ty stared at the man and blinked before turning to reply. “Uh. Maybe?”<br />
<br />
“Well, I&#39;m sure some people like you suspect these things. But how about this guy right here? Mowing his lawn on a Saturday morning and then going back inside to watch some brainless sports game on the idiot box? At least that&#39;s what he&#39;s planning to do.” She cocked her head and waited.<br />
<br />
“No. Definitely not,” Ty said sternly. &quot;I don&#39;t think he&#39;d be able to handle it.&quot;<br />
<br />
“So.” She pointed again emphatically. “Do you think I&#39;d let him kiss me?”<br />
<br />
Ty paused for a moment, stared at Narissa, and the very mental image of that happening was repulsive and hilarious at the same time.<br />
<br />
“Exactly.” She smiled, almost breaking into laughter. “So here lies the point. You are very likely to be the only human in about five thousand years who has kissed a reptilian woman.”<br />
<br />
Ty blinked in sudden shock and then felt a distinct wave of shame followed by a sense of strange pride.<br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t be impatient.” She winked. “I like you too.”<br />
<br />
Ty&#39;s eyes widened. He was rendered completely speechless.<br />
<br />
“Well, you don&#39;t think that I&#39;d let you break multidimensional barriers to bring me here if I didn&#39;t at least want to be here with you, right?” She emphasized this by placing a hand on Ty&#39;s shoulder and scrunching her face playfully before laying an awesome and sensual kiss on his young lips. The second of his life.<br />
<br />
Her “thousands of years of experience” suddenly made sense as even in this human disguise she expertly sucked his lips and slipped her long reptilian tongue across Ty&#39;s own and slurped the roof of his mouth with a movement so sinful and incredible that Ty couldn&#39;t help but pop wood right then and there.<br />
<br />
He clenched his hands and let himself imagine that long and powerful tongue licking his face, down his neck, his chest, and falling below to eagerly slurp his hard little cock. Somehow, this thought spurred Narissa on, and with passionate abandon, she grabbed both shoulders and pulled him in for more, tenderly and breathtakingly kissing his lips while she licked the inside of his mouth with a tongue that in no way resembled a young girl&#39;s at all and definitely didn&#39;t resemble a human anyway. Her mere embrace had incredible power behind it, and all pretense that she was, in fact, a human shattered as he realized she still possessed every bit of her reptile strength while in this outward body, which made him fully comprehend that despite her physical state, he was being owned by a giant reptile woman from another world. Oddly, that turned him on more, and at the same time, Narissa responded to his thought with a more sturdy embrace as she held him exactly where she wanted him to be in her arms.<br />
<br />
When at last it ended, Narissa broke away, softly rubbing Ty&#39;s face as she drew back, and she gingerly shut his hanging mouth with her palm, patting his cheek for good measure with a sly and egotistical grin. She looked around covertly, seeing nobody had noticed.<br />
<br />
Ty slurped up the drool that had formed at the corner of his mouth and his dazed expression turned to horror as he realized Narissa&#39;s palm was cupping the bulge in his pants rather possessively. “Another thing.” She said casually, as if she weren&#39;t holding his stiffened penis. “When I said we had bonded, I meant on a deeply spiritual level. As in we are naturally compatible souls. And souls like us feel like we&#39;ve known each other forever, that&#39;s how easy the relationship is. That&#39;s part of why I found you when I did. That&#39;s why this...” She gave his bulge a squeeze and grinned as he squirmed. &quot;Feels so right and natural. Imagine, you never felt right with people because you needed a lizard in your life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty nodded slowly, putting his hand on Narissa&#39;s shoulder. He so badly wanted to continue, his penis throbbing, especially as she gave it another gentle squeeze and it grew in her hand, but then suddenly realized they were outdoors in public on a bench on the sidewalk and at any moment somebody could walk by and see a young girl toying with a young boy&#39;s boner in public. To think a day ago he had been scared to leave the house.<br />
<br />
“Patience.” She said with an emphatic smile, feeling him start to dwindle under her palm. “I promise you can have my sweet scaly ass all to yourself later.”<br />
<br />
“Do you always torment the humans you meet like this?” Ty said with a straight face. He was beginning to understand something really truly weird and wonderful had happened to him with Narissa, and he stopped feeling sorry for it.<br />
<br />
“Only the ones I like.” She shrugged playfully, and energetically bounded off the bench. “I think I&#39;d like to go get lunch. Don&#39;t you think we should eat? I mean, you barely had breakfast because of me.”<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t have any money,” Ty said, his voice almost inaudible as he realized that Narissa was implying she had been attracted to him from the very start and this was entirely natural and right to happen anyway. It felt oddly okay to be turned on by a giant reptile lady. Nevermind she was impossibly older than him. It just felt right.<br />
<br />
“Ah!” She slapped his back as they began walking again. “So you get what I&#39;m saying! Good to know!” She also made a wallet appear in her hand, also an illusion of sorts, and produced one hundred dollars.<br />
<br />
“What the...” Ty gaped.<br />
<br />
“Here.” She handed the bill over to Ty and then laughed hysterically as it blinked away.<br />
<br />
He turned to her, still holding out his palms, and stared in confusion.<br />
<br />
“See how easy it is to make you think something is there when it isn&#39;t?” She laughed, seeing his bewildered expression. “I don&#39;t need money.”<br />
<br />
“Isn&#39;t that stealing?” Ty whispered, looking around as if somebody would hear them and send the police.<br />
<br />
“Can you do better?” Narissa asked, smirking.<br />
<br />
Ty blinked several times in succession and then turned his head to regard Narissa with sudden realization. He looked down at his empty hands and suddenly he was holding a stack of real cash in his hands, as he had desired. “Looks like I can.”<br />
<br />
“You forgot, didn&#39;t you?” She laughed, bumping him with her hip. “You honestly forgot!”<br />
<br />
“Shut up, shut up.” Ty blushed, stashing hundreds of dollars in his pocket.<br />
<br />
“All right.” Narissa slapped her hands together and rubbed them dramatically. “Now we&#39;re getting somewhere. If you can conjure money out of thin air, and unlike me, make it a real thing, then what do you think you can do to people?”<br />
<br />
“People?” Ty smiled slyly. “Well, whatever I want.”<br />
<br />
“Exactly.” Narissa whispered, poking his chest. Ty, in return, went to poke Narissa&#39;s chest and then realized he was about to poke breast. He stopped suddenly, catching her facepalming as she read his mind.<br />
<br />
“Hey...” He wondered aloud. “Do you...”<br />
<br />
“Yes!” She spat impatiently. “And they perform exactly the same function.”<br />
<br />
Ty looked back to the horizon as they walked past an old church and approached an intersection that led to fast food, shopping, and a mall.<br />
<br />
“Lizard titties.” Narissa chuckled suddenly, breaking into a giggle. “Did you just call them lizard titties? Did you seriously just call them lizard titties?”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m not even going to remark.” He said with a playful pout.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re not that big.&quot; She cupped her hands over her chest for emphasis, pronouncing a nearly flat chest and only the slightest hint of a feminine swell. &quot;You&#39;re going to be disappointed when you see them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll make them bigger.&quot; He shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t change me.&quot; She smiled. &quot;I don&#39;t obey your physical reality, and thus, am exempt to whatever you want to happen to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty stopped and raised an eyebrow as Narissa crossed her arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead.&quot; She nodded to her chest. &quot;See what happens.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty shrugged, winced, and willed Narissa&#39;s breasts to become bigger. They didn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t change me.&quot; She said as they continued walking. &quot;Or anything beyond the third dimension. That&#39;s also a lesson because if you ever find yourself facing an entity from another dimension, you won&#39;t be able to do anything about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you know we were going to have this conversation?&quot; He asked as they crossed the street to the business district. &quot;Did you use your boobs as a springboard to discuss deeper matters?&quot;<br />
<br />
Narissa almost snarled, letting her actual manner slip. &quot;Well, I got your attention, didn&#39;t I?&quot;</p>
