<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You continued to stare at the three despairing animals until, all of a sudden, Vicky quickly swooped down and grabbed Jemma and Fiona in one fluid motion. The snake and cockroach then started to cry out as they were brought back towards their glass terrarium. <br />
<br />
Vicky made sure Rianna had a good view as she first lowered Fiona back down into her side of the container. Cruelly, she then held the helpless cockroach in place while she waited patiently for one of the males to approach. This sadly didn’t take long, as five or six of the insects instantly swarmed around Fiona, making her chitter out in terror as the bugs of her nightmares surrounded her once again.<br />
<br />
Predictably though, Vicky showed no mercy as she waited eagerly for a dominant male to take charge of the situation. This duly happened as one of the male cockroaches clambered over Fiona’s back and then began humping her as she lay pinned beneath him. Soon, Vicky seemed happy to remove her hand and leave Fiona at the mercy of her enthusiastic mates; now that they were crowding around her in anticipation that they would all get a turn with her soon.<br />
<br />
With Fiona now dealt with, Vicky then turned her attention to Jemma as she looked away from what was now happening to her wife. However, Vicky didn’t let this bother her as she casually started to lower Jemma back down towards the mass of male garter snakes as they writhed around in excitement.<br />
<br />
Upon seeing this, Jemma started to thrash around in Vicky’s hands as she fought desperately to break free. Sadly though, Vicky managed to grip Jemma tightly, meaning she was able to continue her advance without issue.<br />
<br />
Jemma then hissed out in despair as Vicky forced her head-first into the centre of the writhing mass of snakes. Some of the males moved aside as Vicky forced her victim down deep amongst them, such that only the last few inches of her tail still remained visible from where you were standing. However, Vicky evidently wanted to make sure that Jemma was fully-buried, which was why she helped to fold the mass of males back together as they swallowed the lone female into their enormous ball. Then, Vicky put the cherry on top by positioning a few stray snakes on top of Jemma’s tail, thus ensuring that she was fully submerged amidst the mass of squirming, excited bodies.<br />
<br />
With both of her parents now back with their respective mates, Rianna now looked like she wanted to cry as she whimpered sadly to herself. However, Vicky seemed to revel in the dog’s misery as she walked back towards her. “Awww don’t be so upset dear, both of your parents will eventually learn to love their new bodies. But I don’t want you to worry about them too much; instead I want you to concentrate on your own development…”<br />
<br />
With that, Vicky started to unlock the breeding stand as she continued to talk down to the fearful pug beneath her. “To that end,” she resumed, “you too will now begin your own mental conditioning. By the end of the program you should be happy and comfortable living as an obedient breeding bitch. Then, perhaps, I might let you leave this place; if you behave like the good girl I know you really are!”<br />
<br />
The trembling pug clearly wasn’t amused by this as she continued to yap and growl in defiance. However, Vicky didn’t seem to care as she firmly grabbed Rianna by the base of her neck and promptly carried her over to a large, but currently empty cage. <br />
<br />
Sadly this wasn’t the case for long as Vicky threw the pug inside and locked the door. The pug snarled and clawed at the bars as an obvious mix of anger and panic settled over her canine features. However, Vicky simply chuckled as she moved away from the cage and headed over to some of the dogs she had introduced earlier.<br />
<br />
First, she came to Simon the lively rottweiler. The excited dog seemed more than eager to leave his cage as he sniffled deeply at the scents of the various bitches that were housed nearby. <br />
<br />
Following this, Vicky also removed Tony from his cage as he sat tenderly licking his mate’s ears. The siberian husky seemed reluctant to leave his mate at first, but when Vicky offered him a few tasty sausages and the promise of a new bitch to mate, she soon found that Tony was more than willing to cooperate as he said goodbye to his former-owner for good.<br />
<br />
With two dogs now being held by their leashes, Vicky promptly scooped Bob back off the table and introduced him to the other two males. Soon, Vicky was walking all three dogs back towards Rianna’s cage, with the familiar look of excitement in her eyes leaving you in little doubt as to why Vicky was doing this.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, Vicky promptly brought the dogs over to Rianna and started feeding them one-by-one into her cage. The terrified pug backed into a corner as she snarled at the three larger male dogs that now towered over her. Sadly, none of the males seemed phased by this as they approached the lone female together. <br />
<br />
Rianna was clearly horrified by what was happening as she swiped desperately at the advancing males. However, the trio were soon quick to bring her to heel as they used their much larger bodies to force her out of the corner she had been hiding in. And then, with the lone female now vulnerable to more than one direction of attack, it was only a matter of time before one of the horny males took advantage of the situation…<br />
<br />
Sure enough, Simon the rottweiler soon seized his chance when Rianna’s back was turned. With a clear plan in mind, Simon placed a heavy paw on the pug’s shoulder in an effort to steady her and prevent her from escaping. Rianna was clearly shocked by this development as she tried desperately to squirm and roll away. However, the bigger dog was easily able to overpower her, meaning that he was quickly able to take advantage of his position as he gave a long, slurping lick right up the length of Rianna’s vagina!<br />
<br />
Feeling the hot slobbery tongue gliding over her swollen bitch sex made Rianna shudder to a standstill. The absolute fear and shock was clearly etched on the little dog’s face as she realised the implications of what was happening. And yet, as Simon continued to sample her, it became obvious that she was starting to relax. Soon, her efforts to escape had fully ceased; while her previous snarls of anger were beginning to increasingly sound like long, lustful moans, as her body once again started to succumb to its primal urges.<br />
<br />
After a minute-or-so, the last of Rianna’s reluctance and shame finally died. Now she was left panting and frothing from her vagina, as she looked up at her mate with a desperate, wild hunger in her glossy eyes.<br />
<br />
Sadly, Simon was happy to take advantage of Rianna’s change of posture. To this end, the rottweiler promptly removed his tongue and began awkwardly crouching down like Bob had done as he started hunting eagerly for the fat, slick spade between the pug’s legs.<br />
<br />
Tragically for ‘Ryan,’ Simon was eventually able to find the mark as he kissed his mate’s vagina with the tip of his cock. Rianna then let out a loud howl of delight as she got to feel her pussy being stuffed full with a thick doggy cock for the second time that day. Sadly though, you suspected that this wouldn’t be the last time, since the husky and boxer now sat watching the action eagerly; each with large erections of their own peeking out from between their furry legs!<br />
<br />
And so, with Rianna now happily mating along with her two parents, Vicky finally drew your attention away from the wildly humping dogs as she brought forward another victim to show you.<br />
<br />
In reply, you could only stare at this new animal in stunned silence whilst also trying not to think about what you had just seen. Despite your best efforts though, the pug’s cries of joy made this impossible. <br />
<br />
Now, you simply had to watch Vicky begin her next story, all with the sounds of Rianna’s mating echoing in the background as she neared the fateful orgasm that would seal her fate forever...</p>
