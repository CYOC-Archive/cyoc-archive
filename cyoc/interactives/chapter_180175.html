<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cindy woke up elated. She didn&#39;t know how or why but she was sure that she gained a wish per day. Although it sounded unreal, she was certain it was true. And she was gonna try it out today, after school. <br />
The day passed by in a blur, until finally it was time for after school track practice. Cindy was always quite athletic, and although she liked to play basketball a lot when she was a kid, puberty wasn&#39;t very kind to her height-wise, so she just joined the track team to stay fit and de-stress. Although she was quite fit, her stride length was rather small, so she was still only about average in the team.<br />
&quot;Hey Cindy, it&#39;s that day again&quot; Abby said with a grin. Abby was 5&#39;2 and somewhat of a rival for Cindy. Although she wasn&#39;t as athletic, the big height difference made up for it. Abby was a bit envious of Cindy actually. A short stature might not work on some, but Cindy looked like a blonde, blue eyed doll. Not only that, Abby had AA cups, whereas the large B cups on Cindy chest looked all the more prominent due to her short stature. So every time it was their turn to pack up all the equipment afterwards, (batons and obstacle hurdles, mostly) they had a bet the loser would do it by herself. Abby could actually win against Cindy if she went all out, but she purposefully let Cindy win about 1 every 4 or 5 times so that she would keep accepting the bet.<br />
&#39;This bitch. She used to lose to me all the time when she joined, but now she really got used to putting on airs, didn&#39;t she? In a little while I probably wouldn&#39;t be able to win against her even the 1-4 that I could now. So how about evening things out a bit? I wish Abby was 4&#39;8 and wouldn&#39;t grow at all after that. Hmm. Instinctively, she knew that some changes will only be unlocked tomorrow, and height is one of them. Alright then, how about some extra weight instead then? I wish Abby had DD cup breasts.&#39; Cindy remembered the three main problems with big boobs and running; back pain, bouncing, and chafing. &#39;Well, since back pain is gonna follow her around everywhere, maybe I won&#39;t enhance that, but the others...I wish that even though the breasts Abby got would still look young, with healthy skin, the skin would be much more elastic than aver- what is even considered to be within the normal range, resulting in her boobs being really bouncy when she runs. The skin will also be very sensitive, with the nipples being incredibly sensitive, and about 1.25 inches in length when erect. We would still run today together, and the bet would be unchanged.&#39; <br />
&#39;Hmm. Chafing does happen with sensitive skin, but pronounced nipples and incredibly sensitive skin would cause her to bleed out of her nipples from running too much, even with a bra... Well, she didn&#39;t specify about chafing in her wish, so I&#39;ll just take it as sexually sensitive, and keep the skin irritation factor to normal levels&#39;<br />
Cindy looked towards Abby, who had a sour expression on, with glee, as she noticed the boobs in front of her. This was gonna be fun.<br />
&quot;So Abby, ready to run?&quot;<br />
&quot;Hmm, yeah, sure.&quot; Why did she even agree to this bet? She didn&#39;t really exercise that much, and only came to the track team this one time. Her boobs weren&#39;t too much of a problem in daily life, but they did make exercise more difficult. At 5&#39;2 she was still petite, and the boobs were really difficult to manage whilst running. A good sports bra was an absolute necessity, but even with a bra on, her boobs somehow still bounced almost as much as a regular DD cup woman that didn&#39;t have a bra on. For boobs the size of hers, this was half-debilitating. And even worse, she somehow got a bit turned on from running, even relatively shorter distances. This was because the bouncing caused her nipples to move just a bit against the fabric of her great bra (Bad ones would let them move way more), and her sensitive nipples reacted, and embarrassed her by popping their heads through the bra. Even if she wanted to get out of her comfort zone, the track team was an awful choice, and making a bet was even worse. Well, they didn&#39;t really bet anything important, and she could finish cleaning up in 15-20 minutes or so, but still.<br />
...<br />
Cindy stifled a laugh as she saw the nipples poking out of Abby&#39;s t-shirt. Even with a sports bra her boobs bounced to the point that she wondered how unnaturally they would bounce if she didn&#39;t have one on. It was no wonder that the extra weight the bouncing added to the already hefty weight of her chest made it so that Cindy won easily. The nipples poking through were just the icing on the cake. She thought to make it so that Abby wouldn&#39;t want to run because of chafing, but it seems like it got translated a bit differently. Moreover, she could almost swear that the part of the flash on Abby&#39;s face and heavy breathing wasn&#39;t just because of her exertion whilst running.<br />
Going back home, Cindy felt butterflies in her belly. This was great. She could live like a queen. Any teacher, or future employer who she didn&#39;t like could just be punished accordingly. With happy thoughts, the rest of the day flew by until she went to bed. Tomorrow was gonna be even better.</p>
