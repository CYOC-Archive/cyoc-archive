<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Emily having figured out some of the settings of the camera from her test on her neighbors decided she wanted to change her family up. Just like her, her older brother Gabriel was visiting for the summer. He works in another city, so their parents made them promise to visit every summer. Emily has an okay relationship with her brother so their mother Aiko made it clear to her to call him onii-chan when they were younger, since leaving she would still call him onii-chan only when they were at home. This of course gave her an idea on what to turn her brother into. <br />
<br />
She went downstairs and called out to her family, telling them she found an old camera at a garage sale and wanted to make a memorable photo with them. They gladly collected themselves on the sofa. <br />
<br />
Emily got the camera settings to how she liked and prepared the timer on the camera. She sat in between her brother and mother, her father Mike was next to Gabriel. She waited for the timer to go off and take the photo. Her heart was beating in excitement and worry, the seconds to the shot felt incredibly long to her. As the seconds count down, she was worried she got the settings wrong. <br />
<br />
Finally the camera blinded her in the flash. She could feel the changes to her body and clothes. She didn&#39;t bother to much with looking at herself or her family members besides her, she instead went straight to grab the photo on the floor. As she looked at the photo she felt her family lean in to see as well. <br />
<br />
Where was once where she was, was a completely different woman. Emily now had larger breasts then when Rick was a woman, her waist was thinner, her hips wider and her ass had more padding. She was significantly taller, around 6 feet from what she could tell. an even better way to describe her self would be calling herself a tall photoshopped bikini model. Speaking of bikini she was wearing a sexy sling bikini. <br />
<br />
Where her brother Gabriel was, was now a female red Oni. Gabriel was a solid 7 foot 2 inch tall and like Emily had a large bust, incredible curves, child bearing hips and large ass, the main difference besides being taller, having red skin and horns, was that Gabriel was incredibly ripped having no fat outside of her tits and ass. Gabriel was wearing a sexy sling bikini as well.<br />
<br />
Their mother Aiko was now no longer Japanese instead, she looked like a bimbo, her tits taking up most of her body, her ass being as large as her tits and broodmother sized hips. Her tits and pussy were barely hidden by her pink microkini. <br />
<br />
Their father was now the Japanese person of the family, he was a 9 foot tall red Oni. He was ridiculously muscular and he was wearing trunks that barely hid his clearly large cock. <br />
<br />
Emily and Gabriel both shared their father black hair, the two sisters hair reached down to their waist. <br />
<br />
Emily heard her new sister say &quot;The photo turned out nice sis. Look how hot we look in our bikinis. Now lets head to the beach, I&#39;m dying to entice some guys for some fun on the beach. You should invite Rick and have some fun at the beach to.&quot; Gabriel er Gabriella winking at the last part. <br />
<br />
Emily caught her drift and given that they were all in beach wear, she knew she had no choice but to head to the beach. She figured it would be a good opportunity to have more fun with the camera.<br />
<br />
They all headed out and got into the specially design car. Given how large Mike was their house and car were significantly larger. During the drive Emily decided to check her cellphone diary, while her Oni nii-san sat beside her. As she read she felt her mind slowly gain memories to suit her new family. While most things seem to not have changed to much, her mother and father changed &quot;places&quot;, her mother was now the lax one, while her father was now the strict one who now enforces the Japanese sibling thing. The more she felt her memories fit her body she then began to realize there were some large differences. <br />
<br />
One main difference was how lax they were when it came to sex or sexual stuff. Their mother real name was no longer Aiko it was now Jenny, Aiko was her stripper name, she also always dressed like a slut and would have sex with Mike in public. Another big difference was that apparently She and Gabriella would as sisters share a lot, from small stuff like toys all the way to boyfriends, and even each other, they would have sex with each other. What&#39;s worst, better, now she was a bit confused how she felt about it, but apparently she was usually the one to start it. <br />
<br />
Taking a peak from her cell to look at her sister, she found her body get hot with arousal. With her arousal came a strong urge to just masturbate, apparently this was usually what lead to sex with her sister, who she would either beg to help her masturbate or to just &quot;grow their bonds stronger together.&quot; Gods apparently she has a sister complex now. As she looked at her dairy more she also realized, she was a masturbation addict and even got turned on by herself, as in she found herself super sexy she would turn herself on.<br />
<br />
She sighed if that was the price for her killer, sexy body then so be it, she didn&#39;t want to risk screwing up and making herself ugly by accident. At least on the bright side her relationship with her sibling was at its best. Looking through her diary one more time she found, she was luckily still in college, her father was a business man, while Gabriella was now a gravure model/sexy model.<br />
<br />
With them now half way to the beach Emily called Rick, she was curios if he would react to her change or not. This meant she would have to be very careful to not reveal she used the camera and has/is using the camera on the beach. She knew she could use Gabriella as a distraction for when she uses the camera. <br />
<br />
They arrived on the beach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now what to do?&quot; she thought to herself.</p>
