<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
&quot;Ah, I&#39;d been afraid her cells would resist to the bonding. Perfect, the Apatosaurus DNA will surely make her larger. Prepare sedatives in case the simulations for this one don&#39;t go as planned...&quot; <br />
<br />
Ivan closely paid attention to Alina&#39;s change.<br />
<br />
Alina was screaming. Her eyes were shut as the light from the generator had burned them and they stung like hell. Her body was absorbing the radiation and her bones were snapping and creaking much like her friend&#39;s. Worse, Alina&#39;s tardiness in transforming had forced her to bear witness to Christy&#39;s change. She had called out her name several times but she figured the pain had been too great for her. Tears were streaming down her cheeks, broken by her pain and the shared pain from watching Christy.<br />
<br />
Somehow, however, Alina remained awake during the whole process. The pain had broken her emotionally, but she was entirely awake to everything that was going on in her body. She felt her arms and legs elongate as her bones became longer and thicker, her tail appearing sooner than it had on Christy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Gyaaaaah!&quot; <br />
<br />
She let out an ear-piercing scream as a whip-like appendage shot out of her back, the long tail draping down the operating table. Alina gasped and panted as the pain slowly subsided ... only for her convulse and twitch as the process of hypertrophic growth started.<br />
<br />
Her table had been specially modified so it would allow an impressive amount of extra weight to be applied unto it. Her bonds were elastic; they expanded along with her body. Alina couldn&#39;t see it, but her whole body was growing larger. In mere seconds her small frame had attained six extra inches in height and several pounds of extra weight. Her skin was hardening as well, mutating into a scaly hide which, much like Christy, acquired a soft chocolate brown color. Her underbelly remained a soft cream much like her friend&#39;s, but it was all scales now.<br />
<br />
Alina would&#39;ve been terrified if she had seen it - her hair was falling off, leaving her completely bald. But that would&#39;ve paled in comparison to seeing her face bloat and round into a cute snout. That change induced pain on her jaw and most of her face since her nose melded into her face. Only her nostrils remained as diagonal, almost invisible slits. <br />
<br />
That wasn&#39;t all however. <br />
<br />
Alina felt herself go mute for a brief moment as the bones in her neck snapped and began adding unto themselves, causing her head to be pushed upwards as her neck grew taller and taller, her snout-faced head growing apart from her body. <br />
<br />
Alina wanted to scream, somehow able to picture what exactly was going on. But she didn&#39;t want to believe it. She couldn&#39;t believe they were forcing her to go through this!<br />
<br />
As this process manifested, her body continued to expand. In mere minutes she had already ascended to a prodigious seven feet, not counting the neck, which topped at two and a half feet separating her head from her shoulders. <br />
<br />
Alina had transformed into an anthropomorphic brontosaurus and part of it didn&#39;t surprise her. <br />
<br />
Her voice returned to her. She cried out as her growth stopped. But the shouting quickly degenerated into moans of pleasure as she felt her hips flare out to accommodate her new weight, the mass of her thighs and rump increasing to support her size and keep her stable were she to stand.<br />
<br />
Her body was gigantic by human standards. Her clothes had literally exploded during her growth, her outward transformation not even having a hand in the wardrobe destruction. Alina was past mere things such as clothing. And soon enough the brown bronto woman was given another reason for that, as well as to moan out in pleasure.<br />
<br />
Alina&#39;s breasts had been affected in a similar manner to Christy&#39;s. Milk was being produced at a steady and fast rate, most of the nutrients supplied by the excess biomatter byproduct of the cellular melding. Her tits swelled like balloons, much more in kind than Christy&#39;s. Her usual B-cups jumped straight to double Ds and then flew past Christy&#39;s current bust line into impossibly large HHs. It was as if Alina was carrying twin basketballs on her chest, and to people of standard height they seemed like overinflated beach balls topped with cute pink nipples. Still unable to see and worn out by the forced changes, Alina finally was knocked unconscious by the ensuing orgasm caused by her mammary growth.<br />
<br />
The female assistant let out a small whistle, feeling slightly self-conscious about her own chest as she watched the monstrously sized woman on the operating table. She looked between the two anthropomorph reptilians and noticed their proportions seemed almost directly opposite. While Christy had incredibly round and shapely buttocks that complemented her child-bearing hips Alina had literally been blown up to super busty in an exaggerated fashion.<br />
<br />
&quot;This... wow,&quot; the male gasped, unable to contain himself as he watched the two god-like feminine bodies, well proportioned for freaks of science. &quot;Professor, no physical changes such as these were observed during Subject P&#39;s treatment. It appears as though different reactions happen in...&quot; <br />
<br />
The scientist&#39;s eyes were pulled over to Alina&#39;s impressive breasts again. <br />
<br />
&quot;...females.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, a minor consequence. We&#39;ll have buxom test subjects. I don&#39;t see what the problem is, do you?&quot; Ivan smirked. &quot;What is...?&quot; <br />
<br />
His eyes widened as he spotted a strange phenomenon manifesting over Alina&#39;s body. The brontosaurus began showing darkening spots of scales over certain parts of her body. Her shoulders, hips, wrists, neck and ankles were quickly identified to have developed dark patched patterns. <br />
<br />
Probably just a scale pigmentation irregularity, Ivan thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Professor, we ought to check if these irregularities will have any impact in the subjects&#39;...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. They are ready,&quot; Ivan declared, scoffing at the still running generator in the chamber.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you waiting for?!&quot; he snapped at the female researcher. &quot;Turn the equipment off and prepare for decontamination. I want them in their cell. NOW!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yes, immediately!&quot; <br />
<br />
The two researchers quickly began punching in more codes. The machine at the center of the chamber retracted into the ceiling, the curtain of radiation disappearing. Soon enough the system was ordered to clean the atmosphere inside the room before the extraction team was ordered to move the test subjects to their pertinent quarters. <br />
<br />
They were physically done. <br />
<br />
The next stage in Ivan&#39;s project was observation.</p>
