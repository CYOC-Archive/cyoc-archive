<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hell, yeah I remember. I'll start from when I left you guys to be as un-confusing as possible. When I left you guys I came straight here. They had just opened the doors when I got here. The man at the front said something to me but I didn't really hear him. Now Amy, I knew you had said something about a chair so I decided to look for that. After walking around a bit I came to this really weird food aisle. And I mean REALLY weird! I mean like this stuff was crazy! Lets see I think one of them was like &quot;Predigested Grass &amp; Roots&quot; or something. Ewww!&quot; explained Jessica looking at her two friends. If she hadn't known better she would have thought that Amy was  almost smiling at the thought of that nasty food. Dismissing the thought she continued,<br />
<br />
&quot;Then all of a sudden the old man pops up from like nowhere starts saying some chinatalk crap about some curious cat or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooo Ooo! Like &quot;Confucius say 'He who stand on toilet, high on pot.'&quot; That one always cracks me up!&quot; laughed Amy. &quot;And why is it always &quot;Confucius this&quot; or &quot;Confucius that&quot;? I mean was he the only smart Chinese guy ever or something?<br />
<br />
(Public Service Announcement: The Chinese have a very rich culture and have had many smart people come from their country. I mean the odds are pretty good that at least a few of the billions will be smart, right? But apparently Confucius is the only one they have ever cared about.)<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyways...&quot; Lina interrupted, shooting Amy a dirty look. &quot;Can we please get back on topic?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK. Anyways,&quot; Jessica continued, &quot;I heard him say something behind me but I didn't really hear him. So I just assumed he had followed me over and was blabbering about something or another trying to sell his crappy food. I though about asking him about chair, but I figured that he was to old and senile to really remember where it was anyways.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I got a few aisles over to some self-help book aisle when I heard him behind me again. He was really starting to creep me out so I tried to thank him politely and walked quickly away. I looked behind me to make sure he wasn't following me this time, and I made sure to walk faster than that old guy could ever dream of.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;After running past a few dozen aisle I came to this one. I needed a new necklace since you broke my favorite one Amy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey it wasn't my fault. It just snapped when I tried it on. Maybe you shouldn't have such a small neck.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well maybe you shouldn't touch my stuff!&quot; retorted Jessica pointing an accusing hoof at her friend, then quickly sticking it back under her armpit, embarrassed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever! Just finish your story Jessica!&quot; shouted Lina now irritated by their petty bantering.<br />
<br />
&quot;Humph, maybe I won't Ms. Pushy. Oh my gosh Lina, your always so demanding. I've just been through a traumatic experience and all you can do is yell at me!&quot; said Jessica, on the verge of crying again. &quot;I mean look at me! I'm some sort of crazy freak now! I have HOOVES!!!&quot; she yelled holding up what used to be her hands, but were now almost complete hooves, as she broke down into tears.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm... I'm sorry Jess. I didn't mean to snap at you like that. I just couldn't believe you would do something like this to yourself after seeing what happened to Amy. I mean, why did you even want to come here in the first place?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica slowed down her crying, trying to pull it together again. &quot;Well, I didn't want all this to happen. I had something beautiful in mind, not this mish-mash of parts. Besides, it wasn't me who made this happen. It was that crazy old shopkeeper. I got to this aisle trying to get away from the guy, but then this necklace caught my attention.&quot; Jessica motioned toward the medallion on the strap around her neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;I went over to pick it up and just as I was about to grab it the old man appeared next to me and snatched it...&quot;<br />
<br />
-------------------------------Flashback-------------------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhhh, good choice my friend.&quot; the old shopkeeper said, admiring the shimmering medallion. &quot;The Chimera is a noble creature known for its ferocity and courage.&quot; <br />
<br />
In one surprisingly swift motion for a man of his apparent age he looped the choker around Jessica's neck and fastened the buckle tightly. Jessica whipped around to try grab the old man, but he had disappeared. She reached behind her neck to remove the choker, but whatever buckle had been there before had disappeared leaving only a thick strip of leather around her neck. The medallion itself rested on her chest just below her neck, the metal cold against her warm skin. She idly scratched her stomach as she sidled over to a mirror for a closer look. Although she could see some sort of beast on the medallion she couldn't make out any details. The itching on her stomach grew more intense causing her to look down.<br />
<br />
Where her hand was was no longer skin. Underneath her hand was scales! White scales that seemed to be spreading across her stomach. She felt a twitch on her face and quickly looked back into the mirror. It looked like a small layer of fur was spreading on out from her nose which had become a light shade of pink and turned upwards. She brought a hand up to her mouth as she felt a tugging on her upper lip and was shocked to see her top lip begin splitting just below her nose. Her hands drew her attention next. The gray color of her arms in the mirror prompted her to look down and sure enough light gray hairs had begun to sprout all down her forearms. Her finger turned black and she yelped in pain as they began to cramp up and slowly merge together. Her thumbs receded up her wrists into useless nubs as her fingers melded into two pairs of fore-hooves. When she flexed her muscles she found she could almost manipulate them like fingers, but with very limited dexterity. By now the scales on her stomach had spread up her shirt and down her pants into some segmented reptilian underbelly. Jade colored scales appeared where the white left off at her sides and wrapped around her back. The soft fur on her much more feline face had progressed down her neck and into her shirt. Then she felt a very strange sensation underneath her her breasts! Two points of intense heat were radiating below her breasts. Unable to feel them with her hooves Jessica was restricted to watching the two mounds of flesh swell beneath her shirt. From the sensations Jessica deduced that these had to be another set of breasts. She could feel her shirt grow tighter as her original pair of breasts swelled out by a size and a half to DD cups while the new pair continued to grow to generous C cups. She could see the bottoms of her bottom pair of breasts and they seemed to be covered in the same scales as her stomach and below.<br />
<br />
The transformation felt like it was finally over as the sensations slowed to a halt. She looked over herself shocked by what had happened to her. This hadn't been what she had wanted at all! This wasn't even close to what she had in mind! The combination of features confused her. What was with fur, hooves, scales, and an extra set of breasts?! She was just some sort of mish-mash freak! Just some biological mess! And all because of that creepy shopkeeper. <br />
<br />
The strain became to much for her and she huddled on the floor and began to cry harder than she ever had before.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------Flashback-------------------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;... and thats where I was until you guys found me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See Amy, I knew that guy was up to something&quot;<br />
<br />
Lina proceeded to tell Jessica about the conversation the two of them had had with the old man when they entered the store.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is 'run its course' supposed to mean anyways?&quot; Jessica asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't know. All I can think is that Amy must have more changes on the way unless we can find something to stop it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There must be something in here,&quot; said Jess, &quot;I mean this place is huge, alot bigger then it looks from outside. I sure we can find something to help you out Amy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope so,&quot; Amy replied, &quot;Because This is getting uncomfortable enough as it is. I've had my fill of... UNGH!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;AMY!&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy doubled over as another change took place. The girls could see their friend grab her abdomen. Luckily they were there to catch her before she hit the floor. They laid her on her back as Amy began to grab furiously at her shorts button. Jessica watched helplessly as Lina moved to help undo Amy's shorts. After finally getting it undone, they could see why it had been so difficult. Just below her stomach a mound of pink flesh had swollen. Four teats dotted the bottom of what was now obviously an udder. The udder swelled outward until it reached the size of a small watermelon.<br />
<br />
Amy lay for a few minute recovering her bearings before her friends helped her back onto her two hooves.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa. That was really weird. But this has gone too far now. I never wanted to have to carry another giant boob between my legs!&quot; Amy said, now very serious. &quot;You were right Lina, I never should have even gotten the tattoo in the first place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well finally you're beginning to see reason.&quot; said Lina. &quot;Now are you girls ready to go find something to fix this mess?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely&quot; Amy replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I've had my fill of this place. It's nothing but bad news&quot; Jess chimed in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will be alright walking with that thing Amy?&quot; Lina asked.<br />
<br />
Amy tried a few tentative steps after disregarding her now useless shorts. The fur and udder were more than enough to cover herself from any prying eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I can manage. Its just a good thin the hooves came before the udder. I doubt my old feet could have handled all this extra weight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well lets get moving before anything else happens to you two.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing Lina. But just to let you know,&quot; Amy paused not sure how to say what she wanted to say. She leaned over to her friends and whispered, &quot;I think I might need to be milked!&quot;</p>
