<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Julia was a child of a lower middle class family so flying was not something she did often. She was a nervous wreck from the all-day stress. The bus had got stuck in traffic on the way to the airport and her group only barely made it in time to catch their airplane.<br />
<br />
During the flight, turbulences rocked the plane hard, causing many people around her to barf up their stomach contents into the small bags. Most of her team mates were richer and flew business class so she was stuck in economy class, sitting between a creepy fat guy and Samantha, the most annoying girl of her sport&#39;s team. Behind her, a 5 year old boy was permanently kicking her seat and to add insult to injury, the entertainment system on her seat was not working. This was not how she had imagined her first 6 hour flight to be.<br />
<br />
Once they arrived, some luggage had not been loaded on their plane and would only arrive the next day. Fortunately for Julia, she had all her important stuff in her hand luggage, but she was still annoyed that she would have to sleep in shorts instead of in her comfortable pyjamas.<br />
<br />
The local organiser had forgotten to send a bus to pick them up. The richer kids took taxis, not wanting to hang around at the airport while the poorer ones had to wait.<br />
<br />
Finally, just before midnight, they had all arrived in the establishment they would be staying for the next two weeks. The best rooms were already taken so Julia and Samantha had to take the room right next to the showers with four bunk beds. The four beds away from the showers were already occupied so only the other four were left.<br />
<br />
Julia picked the last free one on the bottom. There was less space but she liked to have her bag near to her head and she preferred the darkness.<br />
<br />
All the other girls had dropped off to sleep immediately.<br />
<br />
Above her lay Samantha, a chatterbox and a gymnast. She was very small, barely more than 5 feet tall, and petite.<br />
<br />
On the bunk bed to the left of her was Miranda, also a gymnast but a lovely girl. She was also quite small but had developed a rather large bust, which was not ideal for her sport career. Above Miranda was an empty bed.<br />
<br />
Across the passage on the right slept two sisters: Theresa and Maria, identical twin daughters of a deeply religious Mexican family. Both turned out to be very talented football (=soccer) players.<br />
<br />
On the bunk next to them lay Lizzie. Like Julia she was from the UK and like Julia she was on the swim team. She had a beautiful face with long curly auburn hair. However, her soft feminine head was planted on a 6 feet tall, V-shaped swimmer&#39;s body. The bed above Lizzie was not yet taken but reserved for her friend who would be coming the next day.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
2 o&#39;clock in the morning.<br />
The others were sound asleep but Julia&#39;s heart was still pounding from all the excitement of the day. Thoughts were racing through her head and she could not calm herself down to catch some sleep.<br />
<br />
Julia told herself that an orgasm may help her relax. Most of her friends had no idea that she was a very sexual person and she preferred to keep it that way.<br />
<br />
She sat up, tossed away her blanket and quietly rummaged through her hand luggage to find her tiny pocket vibrator. She switched it on, but instead of the buzzing sound there was nothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Crap, battery empty,&quot; she muttered to herself. Then she remembered the she had taken the torch too and wondered if it used the same batteries.<br />
<br />
She took the flashlight out of her bag and fiddled around. In the dark, she twisted the back all the way anti-clockwise but it did not unscrew. All she had done is turn it all the way to the highest pink setting.<br />
<br />
She then turned the flashlight on and shone the pretty pink light onto her small vibrator. What she saw next was surreal: in front of her eyes the item started transforming. At first she did not grasp what it was, but when the morphing was finished she saw that it looked like a vagina on a handle. This is when she realised that this must be a so-called &quot;fleshlight&quot;, a pussy-shaped object where men could stick their cocks in and stimulate themselves.<br />
<br />
Julia was not stupid and quickly put one and one together. She realised that the torch had to be the reason for this change. She twisted the back part of it clockwise and saw how the colour of the light changed from intense pink to light pink and then to light blue. She was still holding the sex toy in her other hand and watched how it had transformed back into a small vibrator.<br />
<br />
But she was not satisfied with just having her toy back and investigated further. She twisted it further to a more intense blue colour. The vibrator grew bigger and bigger and finally, when she had reached the most intense blue, it was a 12&quot; long and very thick dark brown shaft.<br />
<br />
Fascinated, she turned around the dildo to see the other sides and gasped when her hand was illuminated by the light. Within a few seconds her hand had turned into a large, strong, hairy, male hand.<br />
<br />
Shocked, she dropped both the sex toy and the magic flashlight…</p>
