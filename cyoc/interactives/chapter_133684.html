<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The days continued to go by, Philips mental will maintained as the days dwindled by to the final day, being used several times by people of all shapes and sizes and even a daily visit from the morbidly obese lady who had arrived just a few days prior, remembering to flush to his relief.. Over the days, Philip’s appearance became more shiny and welcoming to his users as he eased in to the repetitiveness of each transition. As his use increased with up to fourteen flushes in a single day, each one a overpowering sensation.<br />
 <br />
Having arrived and a little tired, Philip couldn’t help but close the stall door behind him as he entered, thinking back and wondering why today there was no tug, no pulling sensation, freely he made his way, “It is my final day”, thinking to himself.<br />
 <br />
“I want to see this” he thought closing the door to his stall just jar. As he assumed his position for the final time, looking into the mirror, thinking back to this last week he wanted to ensure he would never forget the week.<br />
 <br />
Philip moved and embraced the pipe below, “I might as well enjoy myself” speaking softly as he watch his reflection. “My butt looks so weird, was it always changing like this?” as he watched his rear in the reflection, it had become comical compared to the rest of him, watching as it merged with the piping, “Ahhh” aloud as his butt slid down the pipe, merging around it as his butt finally became the base of his form. “It looks and feels so strange so…, right” he couldn’t deny what he had felt over the past week, the embarrassment and humiliation, yet the perfect moment, each and everytime he was flushed.<br />
 <br />
As the changes spread upward watching as his hair fell out all over his body as they disintegrated into dust and then nothingness. He pulled in his legs once more, their form merging and distorting together as they became one with his torso, “It seems so intimate…” he gasped for breath as he felt a last need to breathe. Philip watched closely, purposely keeping a arm free, allowing one side of his bowl to form, “I must know how it feels…” reaching over with his other arm, feeling the exterior of his porcelain bowl for the first time, “So smooth, so sensitive…”.<br />
 <br />
Whilst he did this he watched, “I look so horrific, yet…” thinking about his present half like form that seemed to blend both human and toilet. Watching as his head and mouth shifted, merging with his bowl, he continued to feel around his form keeping his arm free from finalising along with the other parts of his bowl. Moaning to himself as he felt around the shape of his form with deep interest as his mouth enlarged merging into his legs as they formed the inner bowl while his throat sank to the bottom connecting completely with his piping once again.<br />
 <br />
Placing his head against the back wall, “I’ve got a square head” laughing to himself as it became plastic attaching itself to the wall behind him, growing as it removed the final traces of his humanity, with a sudden reflex as if he had blinked his eyes had merged once more with his tank as one relocated lengthening into a traditional handle. He felt his ear for what might be his final time, connect with the water piping in the wall.<br />
 <br />
As his water tank began to fill along with what was almost a bowl, all other changes in place outside of his arm, “I wonder if I could…” reaching over to his own handle, giving it a tug. “Ahhhhh” Philip moaned in bliss even without his arm, there was still enough of his bowl to ensure water didn’t escape. As he came down from the high he placed his arm where it should be, allowing it to shift becoming the right side of his rim, merging with his bowl as the final transition had taken place.<br />
 <br />
“I can’t help but look in the mirror today, I feel so horny……, so sensitive…….. I look as I’ve never looked so welcoming…, I feel good…, maybe…I” Philip pondered, this really might be his last chance to change his mind. “Perfect job, I don’t know…” he mused to himself<br />
 <br />
As the door unlocked once more, Philip heard foot steps, “Might as well hope they use me before my next job”, he continued to think as the footsteps drew closer. As his stall opened he remembered her, “Its the first one, she’s back!” looking towards her handbag beside her once more. As she made her way towards him with her hips brushing the doorway.<br />
“I can’t believed mom kicked me out, how did she find out, everything was fine but why did she confront me in the car on the way here of all things?. I found someone that likes me for who I am, once I’m done here I’m never coming back!” she said as she removed her bag and coat placing them beside her as she lowered her trousers and underwear placing her butt firmly on Philips seat.<br />
 <br />
“WOW, she might be a little heaver” he thought as he eyed her once more in the mirror.<br />
 <br />
With a loud wet fart, Philip was fazed he had gotten used to this action by all those who had come before her and since. He didn’t even flinch as his point of view moved to his bowl as she did her business, poohing and urinating in his bowl, “This is like tough love, maybe even a form BDSM..” trailing his thoughts as he wait. Yet his view switched back, then forth he could control his own view. “I don’t have to see!”, gleaming from luck he watched her jiggle as she adjusted her position on him.<br />
 <br />
Reaching to her side she reached into her bag “She must be getting treats again…” wondering to himself what she might stuff herself with. Suddenly Philip’s eyes narrowed directly on what appeared to be a large thick black dildo, grasping it with one hand while she pulled a plastic container housing two custard éclairs.<br />
 <br />
“Whaaaat look at the size of that thing it must be what twelve maybe thirteen inches, good god lady I thought you said you had a man” as he eyed it.<br />
 <br />
Lifting up her belly Philip knew what was coming yet didn’t really care, he was along for the ride as she heaved her belly to the side, watching as she inserted the thick long dildo into her vagina, while grasping a cake in the other, eating while she inserted it in and out in a fast motion, Philip felt sensations across his form, the tenderness of his seat and bowl as she pleasured herself, he felt as if he could feel her bliss as she ate away the first cake, her body jiggling and slapping against his form..<br />
 <br />
With her juices flowing Philip could taste nothing but her lust, as she greedily devoured her other cake, moaning to herself as she continued to thrust, with one final jerk she pulled the dildo out as she orgasmed into his bowl, Philip was blown away, he had thoughts for years about doing something like this with a girlfriend eating her out. “Too bad she’s so big, her jiggle across me that was teasing..” he said enjoying the moment.<br />
 <br />
Wiping her dildo down with some toilet paper she placed it in her bag as she began to unload into his bowl. Philip could feel it rain into his mouth, “I can’t taste it…, it tastes lightly of what she ate, for the past week the taste has gotten easier, maybe I should…do” Philip fell once again into deep thought as he watch her clean herself, failing once again to clear her bottom. “If your not careful miss I’ll be seeing you a lot more oft…” his voice trailing off.<br />
 <br />
“I love my body mom…, me and my man are gonna make me the biggest girl you’ll ever see”, telling a almost empty room as she got dressed, flushing Philip as she left his stall, giving her butt a smack on the way out.<br />
 <br />
The smack and flush pushed Philip over the edge, “The jiggling, the flush shit this is so good, I don’t care, fuck it.” he told himself, as his will finally began to wither.<br />
 <br />
Philip continued to be used, for the rest of the day the constant flushes and other jiggling from his patrons played with his mind removing almost all resistance yet at the back of his mind he knew. “This isn’t right, yet I can’t say no, I’m…. not sure” he said to himself with the sun setting once more.<br />
 <br />
As the final minutes ticked away the bathroom door locked, out of thin air Lohse began to reappear before him. “So, the weeks over do you want to continue?”</p>
