<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You're name is Rick and you were sitting in the park one summer day watching the children play with a smile on your face. You wished that you could be a kid again and be relatively carefree. At least you wouldn't be worrying about dying soon. You were thirty-six and somehow you just knew that you wouldn't reach forty.<br />
<br />
You look up in the sky just as one of the new superheroes flies overhead. You start thinking about how you would die. Maybe you would be caught up in the middle of a fight between a superhero and a supervillian. That would seem likely since both are learning of their powers and how to control them. They had started appearing two months ago. No one knew why they had started to appear but they did. Scientists were baffled by them since they seemed to defy the laws of physics. Of course the government was treating the superheroes as a threat along with the supervillians. You could understand a bit of caution but to class superheroes with supervillians was being a little paranoid.<br />
<br />
Suddenly you heard the kids scream and you looked back down to see Snakorn stalking them. He looked like a human sized snake with arms. He hunted little kids to eat, or so some kids who have seen him claim. You could understand the need to hunt but he didn't hunt animals for his food. The kids had scattered and most of them were out of his reach. One little girl however didn't get away and he was raising her to his mouth. You had gotten up and started running toward Snakorn when you had noticed him and now you ran faster. You had to save that girl. &quot;LET HER GO SNAKORN,&quot; you shouted trying to distract him and hoping that your shout would bring a superhero.<br />
<br />
Snakorn just smiled and stuffed the girl's head into his mouth. He was eating her alive and your heart began to pound harder. You didn't know how long someone survived once they were eaten by him but you guessed that it would be painful for as long as they did. You reached them and swung at him in an attempt to make him let go of the girl. He dodged it easily and coiled himself around you trapping your arms. You had a real close view of the struggling girl as she was swallowed and you were helpless to stop it. Well maybe not helpless. You could yell for help and you were about to when he started squeezing you. You could barely breathe now let alone yell for help. You wondered why no one was here yet to help the girl. There were plenty of people in the park and the screaming kids should have attracted attention. Not to mention your own scream. You watched with horror as the girl's legs and finally feet disappeared into his mouth and down his throat.<br />
<br />
Snakorn looked at you smiling. &quot;Your turn,&quot; he said with a slight hissing sound in his voice. He stuffed your head into his mouth and proceeded to eat you. You of course struggled even as you realized that your death was upon you. Your head traveled down his throat and into the tight confines of his stomach. The smell made you gag and you heard a whimper from the girl he had just swallowed. It wasn't long before your whole body was in his stomach. That's when his stomach started to churn and the acid came in. You were able to put your arms around the girl to try and comfort her.<br />
<br />
You don't know how long you were in Snakorn's stomach. All you knew was the acid was eating away at you and the girl turning your bodies into mush. You knew enough about snakes to know that there wouldn't be anything left of the two of you. You also knew that it would be a week or more for you to digest. At least you wouldn't be alive that long. But until you died or lost consciousness you had to endure the pain. Both you and the girl had screamed at times and of course the acid entered your mouth. It tasted vile and it burned. You felt like throwing up when it did then you remembered the small bottle of Ipecac Syrup you had in your pocket. With some difficulty you managed to get it out, opened, and poured into the stomach. You hoped that it would have the same effect on Snakorn that it did on humans. As it turns out it did as the stomach contracted and forced you and the girl up his throat and out his mouth.<br />
<br />
It was a hard landing but you took the brunt of it softening it for the girl. You looked up and saw through blurry eyes that Snakorn just slithered away. You turned your attention to the girl and were relieved that she was still breathing. But you knew that could change quickly. You cradled the girl and rolled to where you could stand. Looking around you noticed that you were in some woods. You picked a direction and started going that way. You had to be careful since you couldn't see well and probably wouldn't be able to for the rest of your life. It hurt to move but you needed to find help.<br />
<br />
After about a half hour you spot someone coming toward you. You stumbled and the figure came closer. &quot;I found two people,&quot; a male voice said.<br />
<br />
Another figure came into view and said, &quot;It's Katrina,&quot; in a definite female voice that sounded relieved and worried. &quot;I thought I had lost her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Both of them need medical attention,&quot; the man said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me hold my daughter,&quot; the woman said as she reached out.<br />
<br />
You weren't sure who this woman was and you weren't going to just give the girl over to her. Not after what you had both been through. The girl however spoke up her voice hoarse, &quot;Mommy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm here sweetie,&quot; the woman said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't see you Mommy,&quot; the girl said. &quot;Who's holding me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Rick,&quot; you said your voice just as hoarse as the girl's.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Rick I thank you for saving my daughter,&quot; the woman said. &quot;How did you do it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I made Snakorn throw us up,&quot; you said smiling a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I'd like to hold my daughter now,&quot; the woman said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You won't be able to Maggie,&quot; the man said. &quot;Katrina and Rick have started to fuse together. If we try to separate them now we would cause both of them pain.”<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you separate them Hank?&quot; Maggie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll have to run a few test to determine that,&quot; Hank said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then teleport us to base,&quot; Maggie all but commanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Hank said and placed a hand on you causing you to wince. You suddenly felt like you weighed nothing at all and then you felt your weight return. &quot;Lay down on this bed,&quot; Hank said as he gently helped you to lie down.<br />
<br />
After what seemed like hours you heard Maggie ask, &quot;So can you separate them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not without killing them,&quot; Hank said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do we do then?&quot; Maggie asked worry in her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;There's nothing we can do,&quot; Hank said. &quot;We'll just have to let the process run its course.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How long will that take?&quot; Maggie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; Hank said.<br />
<br />
It was then that you felt Katrina's mind intertwine with your own. She was confused, scared, and wanting her mommy. There was something else though. It was a strange hunger for... Blood.<br />
<br />
You were about to say something when you felt pain. Both you and Katrina screamed. You felt your body changing through the pain. You felt your dick, balls, and ball sack shrink until there was nothing left and then the area between your legs puff up a bit and split. You felt breasts grow on your chest. You felt your hair grow longer and your face rearrange. You felt Katrina sink into you. You felt your body slim some and wings grow out of your back. Finally the pain subsided and you lay their panting.<br />
<br />
You became aware of Maggie crying and saying, &quot;I've lost my little girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm still here Mommy,&quot; you said and turned your head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Katrina?&quot; Maggie asked with a shocked look on her face.<br />
<br />
You also got a shocked look on your face as you recognized Maggie. Katrina knows her as her mommy and you've seen a picture of her in the paper as Lady Shadow. &quot;It's me Mommy,&quot; you said after getting over your shock. &quot;I'm hungry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want?&quot; Maggie asked smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Blood,&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Blood?&quot; Maggie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes blood,&quot; you said. &quot;I can make do with the bagged variety I think. I just need blood.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Here,&quot; Hank said popping in and handing you a couple bags of blood.<br />
<br />
You bit into one bag and started drinking the blood through what you knew were fangs. As you drank you began to think. You and Katrina were in the same body. While your minds were intertwined it seemed like you were the dominate one for now. As you started on your second bag you heard Hank say, &quot;I want to test your strength. We also need to find something else for you to wear.”<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I have just the thing,&quot; Maggie said and wandered off. She came back a few moments later with a one-piece swimsuit. &quot;Could you leave so Katrina can change?&quot; she asked looking at Hank who you now recognize as Telnak. After he leaves Maggie said, &quot;Go ahead and put this on. It might not fit quite right in the chest since your breasts appear to be a bit smaller than my own. Other than that it looks like you're the same size as I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
You took off your clothes which were ill fitting now and put on the swimsuit. The back was open allowing your wings to move freely. Once you had it on you looked in the mirror. Your skin was very pale almost white, your eyes were a ruby red that seemed to glow, your hair was jet black and ended just above your wing joints, your canines had grown longer into fangs, and your wings were like those of a bat and jet black. &quot;This will take some getting used to,&quot; you said bringing a hand up to your face and noticing the long fingernails painted black.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it will,&quot; Maggie said smiling. &quot;I wish that I had my little girl back though.&quot;<br />
<br />
You decided to let Katrina be the dominate one for a bit and pulled back just a bit. At once another transformation happened. The swimsuit disappeared and you quickly grew younger the curves you had disappearing. Your breasts shrank down until you were flat chested. Your wings shrank and disappeared. Your pubic hair vanished and your slit resumed a prepubertal state. Your eyes turned green and your hair turned red. Your fingernails shortened. Your skin gained a normal healthy color for a Caucasian. Your fangs shrank down into regular canines. You looked at yourself after the transformation. You looked like what Katrina remembered looking like. You were a seven year old girl now. &quot;You got your wish Mommy,&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see that,&quot; Maggie said. &quot;How did I though?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not sure,&quot; you said thinking. It had to have something to do with which part of you was the dominate one. If Katrina was the dominate one then you would be a seven year old girl. If you were the dominate one then you would be older and looking like a vampire. &quot;I'm going to try something,&quot; you said. You felt Katrina draw back a bit and you become dominate. The changes happened again. Soon you were once again older and a vampire. The swimsuit had reappeared on you as your transformation finished. It seemed like what you were wearing went into some sort of pocket space when you transformed. That was good since you didn't have to worry about ill fitting clothes. You looked at yourself in the mirror and figured that you had to be twenty or twenty-one. You smiled and said, &quot;I'll need clothes Mommy. Oh and I think I'll need a new name for when I'm like this. I think I'll go with Vampora.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Maggie said with a smile. &quot;Why Vampora though?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it's a combination of vampire and Dora,&quot; you said. &quot;You know how much I like Dora.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Maggie said smiling. &quot;I'll go home and get you some clothes after I hand you over to Hank for tests. I'll make sure to ask him to run the tests on both your forms.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a good idea Mommy,&quot; you said as you followed her out of the room.<br />
<br />
Hank subjected you to quite a few tests. He discovered that you could lift ten tons, fly, you had tough skin which was nearly impenetrable, you were able to see in total darkness, and create some short term illusions. For your weaknesses he discovered that silver burned you, fire terrified you and he thought you'd catch fire quite easily if it touched you, sunlight would cut your strength down to five hundred pounds though that was it, and of course the fact that you needed blood or you would become weaker. When you were Katrina you were like a normal seven year old girl though you had better night vision, you were still terrified of fire, and you still had a hunger for blood. As to how you got this way Hank theorized that each part of you had part of the needed DNA and when you were both eaten by Snakorn it activated.<br />
<br />
As it turned out you were right about your clothes going into some kind of pocket dimension when you transformed. Your transformation was too fast for the vast majority of people to see happening within a nanosecond. So at least you didn't have to worry about anyone seeing you naked. Now you wanted to train to fight the supervillians to which your mommy objected to at first. However you were able to convince her that since you had these powers now you should use them for good. And of course you would need to hunt for blood. Hank took a sample of your saliva and found that if you controlled yourself you could possibly hunt humans without killing them. You figured that as long as you didn't go too long without blood you could hunt the criminal element in the city. That would help the police quite a bit.</p>
