<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Tom privately thought over his words for the big reveal and carried out the assignments he had for his paper, and Tad focused on welcoming an old friend to Moon Lake, Quintus Fives and Gustavus Amehr were busy with their own present mission, and after learning on what Tom Herald had planned for were kind, that mission was pretty clear. Silence him in any way possible. In a way they could respect some of Tom&#39;s idealism, but they&#39;d spent a lot of time working to protect the were secret and making sure that rogue weres, however rare they might be, were put down and that the outside world never knew of it. It was an intense game of cloak and dagger and had even evolved a fair number of hidden and secretive connections that had served them well. <br />
<br />
And even within the Luna Brotherhood, the two weren&#39;t completely sure on how that worked. They had some government contacts, but none of them had been met in person, and both had the sense that it was through those contacts that any evidence of their actions would come off as the covert actions of some intelligence operative or specialized law enforcement agency. They couldn&#39;t be fully sure how it worked, but they knew it DID work, and had essentially enabled them to put down rogue weres with near impunity. When there were conflicts with law enforcement, they would get back up from other Federal agencies that claimed jurisdiction and recognized them as agents. And since the phone numbers they had were all unlisted in any phone book, it was often difficult to track who they were or fully confirm what agency they actually worked for. Which had made it a long standing successful system and one that would take some strain as Tom Herald was testing them.<br />
<br />
&quot;And outright press release, you say,&quot; a female voice said over the signal and into Gustavus&#39;s cellphone as he paced the motel room that he and Quintus had.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Gustavus answered, &quot;we&#39;d hoped the planted tail would throw him off the conspiracy that Lionel Ulysses was a wererat, but that largely failed. I think he only quit that chase because his editor bought it, not him. And then he runs into a werefox and becomes one...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And then jumps to exposing weres as a result?&quot; the female voice asked, sounding curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, and an obvious case of a rogue were,&quot; Gustavus answered, &quot;perhaps not a criminal rogue that is likely to attack someone for some absurd reason and risk getting caught on camera... but based on the definitions of what qualifies as a rogue, still a rogue.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps... what did he say when you made contact with him?&quot; the female voice asked, again sounding curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s a smart man, ma&#39;am,&quot; Gustavus answered, &quot;mostly mentioned that while things could be tough... they aren&#39;t as bad as we think they could be. And technology in much of the world is rapidly changing... That weres might not be able to hide regardless.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was some frustration that was fairly clear in Gustavus&#39;s voice as he said that, as it was a point that he could recognize. Technology was getting better. Many of the hoops that the Luna Brotherhood went through in the present day was a result of that as communications and law enforcement practices changed. It was hard to shape a story and then simply vanish, as the reports would come in and spread while memories were fresh and this in a way required some measure of connection to the halls of power, even if they were indirect in a way. It was something that was fast becoming the only way the Luna Brotherhood could deal with rogue weres around the world and avoid serious scrutiny. Some other agencies often got nailed for corruption or some other action as a result, but it had at least kept the Luna Brotherhood out of trouble and removed the bigger threats to the were secret. And as technology advanced, things would likely become ever more complicated.<br />
<br />
&quot;And how did he sound when you talked to him?&quot; the female voice asked, &quot;did he sound energetic and enthused? Something that&#39;s pretty common with new ones. They want to show the world how wonderful they are and how wonderful they feel. Not necessarily a bad thing, if misguided. Did he sound calm and collected... which would mean he&#39;s really thought on this, and could warrant deeper investigation into his reasoning... and might even make him an ideal candidate for the Brotherhood. Or did he seem spiteful? Something that would be more worrisome.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He was calm but firm,&quot; Gustavus admitted, &quot;but it&#39;s unlikely that he&#39;d have any interest in joining us. In this, he won&#39;t budge from the mistake that he will inflict on ALL were kind with his plans.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But not aggressive or filled with spite?&quot; the female voice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Gustavus grumblingly admitted. &quot;Regardless... his argument is still one that will reveal our secrets to the world and will awaken old fears. He MUST be silenced before that happens.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Silencing him may be difficult,&quot; the female voice warned, &quot;if he hasn&#39;t engaged in open threats or some other criminal behavior... killing him could only lead into an investigation into you, which could also reveal the Brotherhood and expose us. It would be another of those things where the potential threat may have a point. In this more must be learned. Do what you can to make sure that any activities Mister Herald engages in at Moon Lake are censored... that the local population is openly and massively opposed to it and forcing either the police to keep Herald silent or until the city government abandons the plan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, ma&#39;am,&quot; Gustavus then hung up and looked to his partner.<br />
<br />
&quot;What does Control say?&quot; Fives asked referring to the woman that Gustavus had given his report to.<br />
<br />
&quot;For the moment outright threats are out,&quot; Gustavus said slowly, &quot;and that more information is needed... which means our primary assignment is to censor Herald. Get Moon Lake to turn on him. That might save his life and put an end to this...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if he&#39;s right, though?&quot; Fives wondered, &quot;we were only reacting with regard to what happened with Lionel Ulysses and we got lucky that the FBI gave the costume piece story and Herald&#39;s editor bought it. And we were never able to find Dymixious Drake... and the Moon Lake Police didn&#39;t want our help. Herald could be right that something... somewhere... COULD happen and we won&#39;t be on top of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But that day is not today,&quot; Gustavus answered, &quot;and still... better to wait until we know we will be accepted for who we are without any changes to were society in anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fives sighed, but eventually did nod.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
With their instructions in hand, Gustavus Amehr and Quintus Fives made their way to the Moon Lake Police Station. They remembered from their attempts to try and be involved in dealing with Dymixious Drake, and only finding that the Moon Lake Police would let them observe but not outright participate. It was something that both Gustavus and Quintus had minor frustration with, as in theory all of them had the same base mission, silencing Dymixious Drake before the FBI&#39;s hunt for the killer of Lionel Ulysses could lead to Moon Lake being discovered, but they weren&#39;t allowed anything more than &quot;observation&quot; status. But, if keeping Tom Herald&#39;s plans from coming to pass, they would need the cooperation of the Moon Lake Police Department and both men entered the building with the intent of securing it. They approached the front desk and were quick address the desk officer that was present.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Fives and Amehr,&quot; Quintus spoke to the desk officer, getting him to look up with a start, &quot;we&#39;re here to speak with your chief of police on matters important to the security of Moon Lake.&quot;<br />
<br />
The desk officer looked up at them with a raised eyebrow and possibly holding some degree of suspicion.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s important,&quot; Gustavus spoke and straitened the cuffs on his black suit jacket for the moment, &quot;Trust us.&quot;<br />
<br />
The suspicious look remained, but the desk officer did pick up the phone and dial an intercom number. The two Luna Brotherhood members stood by watching as the desk officer reported their presence and answered the questions that were returned with a series of questions with a simple &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no.&quot; Gustavus figured that some of it was lingering suspicion over the debates related to dealing with Dymixious Drake, but a wave of the hand to the chairs opposite the desk was enough to secure the hope that things would be quiet and easy. They sat down and waited quietly. After a few moments, the door opened to reveal Chief O&#39;Hara with two uniformed officers flanking him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come with us,&quot; Chief O&#39;Hara said firmly as he then turned while Gustavus and Quintus got up.<br />
<br />
Both nervously looked to the two officers who stood back and let the two Luna Brotherhood agents pass between them and then fell in behind the two agents, almost as though they were a sort of security detail. They followed along until they were lead into a conference room, which was for the moment empty.  Chief O&#39;Hara gave a directional wave that pointed to two chairs that were on one side of the long edge of the table. Gustavus and Quintus both took the seats while the two uniformed officers remained standing and focused on Gustavus and Quintus.<br />
<br />
&quot;I assure you, sir, the danger to your town is not from us,&quot; Gustavus spoke as he glanced over at the two uniformed officers.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is debatable,&quot; Chief O&#39;Hara answered, &quot;given your possible involvement in the death of Dymixious Drake... or at least in the battle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We stayed back, as requested and we did not shoot Dymixious Drake,&quot; Gustavus spoke, sounding semi-defensive, &quot;as you requested. It was your own officers that shot him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... I&#39;ve read the reports,&quot; Chief O&#39;Hara answered, &quot;but we have at least one stray bullet that went through the bedroom window of Samantha and Frances Twist on the house next door to the house that Dymixious had been in a the time. None of our body cam footage would suggest that the bullet came from one of our officers and Dymixious Drake was unarmed... at least with regard to a gun. And the only other people that could have taken that shot were you two.&quot;<br />
<br />
Neither Gustavus nor Quintus said anything to that.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;re also fortunate that your little stunt in Seattle threatening Tom Herald is outside my jurisdiction,&quot; Chief O&#39;Hara continued, &quot;otherwise, you&#39;d be under investigation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He IS the threat to your town!&quot; Gustavus said firmly, &quot;surely you do know how many weres have died for NO REASON other than what they were when normals have found out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve heard the stories, yes,&quot; Chief O&#39;Hara said calmly and with narrowed eyes, &quot;but that doesn&#39;t excuse threatening people who have not committed a crime.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exposing weres IS a crime,&quot; Gustavus pointed out, &quot;Your town&#39;s Mandatory Were Law reflects that. Make sure that at least one person becomes a were in order to make sure they don&#39;t betray the town.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It serves to protect the town&#39;s secret,&quot; Chief O&#39;Hara nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;And now Tom Herald plans to reveal it to the world in a press conference and somehow got your City Council to accept it,&quot; Quintus spoke up, &quot;he may have &quot;good intentions&quot; as it were... but the world isn&#39;t ready to know the truth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Once he blabs, the army will come here with tanks and flame throwers and they WILL KILL EVERY LAST ONE OF YOU!&quot; Gustavus added emphasizing the last few words in the Senate.<br />
<br />
&quot;From what I know of the City Council Meeting, all that would be revealed is the were secret, not that Moon Lake is a were sanctuary,&quot; Chief O&#39;Hara answered, &quot;and in some recent years... we&#39;ve had plenty of situations that would indicate that humanity might not be as anti-were as it was in the past. There are people who are fans of werewolf movies and are eager for it when they learn the truth that they wouldn&#39;t be mindless monsters. It could also be quite possible that there could be a fair number of people that would want to become weres. Which could well mean that some of Mr. Herald&#39;s arguments that things might not turn out as bad as some people think carry some merit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And where do you stand on this, sir?&quot; Fives asked, &quot;we really don&#39;t want to harm him... but the were secret is the most important thing to protect. It&#39;s the only thing that has kept humanity from going back to fire and pitchforks of the Middle Ages.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would agree that Mr. Herald&#39;s idea represents a great deal of risk,&quot; Chief O&#39;Hara spoke, &quot;and if I were in his shoes I wouldn&#39;t take that risk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you agree that the secret MUST be protected,&quot; Gustavus spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would agree that it is important,&quot; Chief O&#39;Hara countered, &quot;whether or not it could or should be protected is a different issue and beyond my role as Police Commissioner. Mr. Herald brought his proposal before the City Council and successfully persuaded them to agree to begin planning into handling revealing the existence of weres to the world. There is nothing more that I can do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is plenty you could do,&quot; Gustavus spoke, &quot;it says in your own town charter, &quot;should Moon Lake or its security be threatened, the Police Commissioner has the power to take any immediate action necessary to protect Moon Lake and its secrets, and can supersede the city government should it fail to respond.&quot; You have the raw power to declare Tom Herald a threat to Moon Lake and do what you please with him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chief O&#39;Hara sighed heavily at that, &quot;that line in the charter is in reference to rogue weres... using their strength and power to force what they want and regardless of the cost... and with some assumption that the city government was willing to tolerate it for a negative reason.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what do you think Tom Herald is?&quot; Gustavus asked back, &quot;he wants to expose weres, something that weres have long agreed should be avoided and has somehow convinced your city government to agree. And the consequences if not stopped will be massively negative.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But there is no negative aspect to what is intended,&quot; Chief O&#39;Hara answered, &quot;what has been reported to me... is that his goal is to fight for something that he sees as far more positive for weres. Neither is he wanting to force his opinion on anything, which will ultimately mean that he will have to convince those that do not agree.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But most weres wouldn&#39;t agree, wouldn&#39;t they?&quot; Fives asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My best guess is that is roughly fifty-fifty in how it could or would go,&quot; Chief O&#39;Hara answered, &quot;there are plenty that would reject this because it represents great potential change... but from the details of the actual meeting, Mr. Herald could well have a point. Humanity may find out one day regardless of our trying to hide it. Which would then mean that if it&#39;s negative... trying to hide didn&#39;t help. And if the accidental reveal is in relation to a crime... that might assure a negative response. In which case... Mr. Herald&#39;s idea could well make perfect sense. I do not personally agree with it, but that doesn&#39;t mean what he&#39;s doing actually merits invoking that clause in the city&#39;s charter to declare an emergency.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gustavus&#39;s eyes narrowed as he looked back at the weredog seated before him.<br />
<br />
&quot;And if I were to do so,&quot; Chief O&#39;Hara commented, &quot;what purpose would that serve? Sure... I&#39;d have the raw power to arrest him when he comes for the next meeting with the City Council to discuss the plan, but to what purpose do I manage that? Tom Herald has no outstanding warrants, a clean record with regard to the law, and while he may a bit focused on jumping onto tangents and hunches... he&#39;s not the sort that someone in Seattle would believe just up and committed a crime that would claim his life or justify life imprisonment. Which would only invite scrutiny of my Department from Seattle&#39;s press, their law enforcement agencies, and that could lead to someone with much higher authority than me with regards to the law and jurisdictional issues coming in and seeing as to whether or not I acted without grounds for action. And if that ends up leading to some clause in the city charter as the reasoning for it... that will only raise MORE questions. Meaning, the action to protect the secret could well reveal the secret.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you won&#39;t silence Tom Herald?&quot; Gustavus grumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, and I will tell you here and no, my officers will also make sure that you don&#39;t &quot;silence him&quot; either,&quot; Chief O&#39;Hara spoke, &quot;this isn&#39;t the Middle Ages and isn&#39;t a dictatorship.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what about the secret? Your town&#39;s Mandatory Were Law?&quot; Quintus asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Mandatory Were Law will likely stay,&quot; Chief O&#39;Hara commented, &quot;Since the reveal isn&#39;t supposed to reveal Moon Lake, it would likely be used to protect the town as a sanctuary. Some of the wording for it and how it would be implemented may change to make sure that the town is protected... but the law will likely still be there.&quot;</p>
