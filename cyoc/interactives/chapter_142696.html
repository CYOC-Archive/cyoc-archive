<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff finished up his homework with a yawn. He was exhausted, and was barely able to slump his way around getting ready for bed. So tired, Jeff didn&#39;t even manage to look himself in the mirror while he brushed his teeth. Shucking his clothes into the hamper, Jeff crawled into bed and was out almost immediately.<br />
When Jeff woke the next morning, he could help but feel even more tired than when he had went to bed last night. Walking to the bathroom, Jeff stood to pee and fished out his junk from his underwear. Not entirely awake yet, Jeff couldn&#39;t help but think about how his cock looked bigger than he remembered it, even after making adjustments yesterday with the chronivac. Finished doing his business, Jeff turned and faced himself in the mirror. What he saw shocked him.<br />
Jeff looked different. Very different. For starters, Jeff&#39;s beard had grown from the solid half inch beard he had grown yesterday to one that was three plus inches, and very thick and bushy. His moustahce, which yesterday had been present but was small was now full, and reached his beard. Jeff&#39;s face as a whole was different too. His brow was darker and more pronounced, and his jawline was firm and well defined. To sum it all up, Jeff felt like he looked more masculine.<br />
Looking further down, Jeff&#39;s torso was hairier, which was saying something considering he had a considerably hairy chest yesterday. Rather than the thick swirles which he had grown yesterday, Jeff now for certain had a &quot;pelt&quot; for chest hair, which reached out towards his arms and into his pits. His pit hair was so abundant that it more than just peeked out from under his arms, it showed blatently even with his arms at his sides. Lifting an arm, his inner bush exploded outwards, and Jeff got a massive wave of man stink. He didn&#39;t even need to stick his face up against his pit to smell it; despite the BO, Jeff didn&#39;t recoil or feel disgusted by himself, and he actually kind of liked his natural stink. <br />
Puttig his arm down and glancing to his waist, Jeff&#39;s weird suspicion from before was corret. Jeff&#39;s cock and ball definitely were bigger, as he could see his bulge was more pronounced in his briefs. It was actually so much bigger that the waistband was being pulled down from hits heft, and the legs were riding up as well. With the waistband furterdown, Jeff&#39;s pubes were more than just creeping over the top, they were straight up just exposed, and he felt like it would be indecent were he to show up in a locker room like this. <br />
Jeff&#39;s legs received a similar treatment to the rest of his body. Gone were the days of just &quot;hairy legs&quot;. Before, Jeff could still tell the difference between his leg and his leg hair. Now, his leg hair was so thick that it actually restricted his ability to see the the skin beneath. His leg hair came out from his crotch and stretched all the way to the tops of his feet. <br />
Stepping back from the mirror and surveying his body as a whole, Jeff noticed that, while not hugely so, he was bigger that yesterday. Maybe an inch taller and five pounds heavier that previously. He was definitely more cut that yesterday. Taking it all in, Jeff really had no words. <br />
Snapping out of his trance, he ran to his computer and opened the chronivac program. He first looked at his profile again, but more closely than yesterday, and recognized the changed values with what he saw in the mirror. The important values, such as sex and name were unchanged, which gave Jeff some relief that he didn&#39;t realize he needed. However, because Jeff had not adjusted anything since yesterday before going out with his brother, Jeff reopened the update page to see if he could determine the cause for his drastic change. A few bullest below what he read last night, Jeff found that certain changes would further alter the user in order to better suit the changes to reality that had occurred. <br />
Once more looking at his profile, Jeff scanned for something that stood out. What he found under a subsection titled &quot;Maturity (in years age)&quot; seemed to provide him with an answer. Under Maturity were a few different alterable values, such as &quot;age&quot;, &quot;mental maturity&quot;, &quot;emotional maturity&quot;, and &quot;social maturity&quot;. But without seeing any of these values yesterday, Jeff was certain of the extra alteration the chronivac had made to the user to better suit reality: Jeff&#39;s &quot;physiological maturity&quot; was now set to 30, while his &quot;age&quot; was still set to 16. <br />
Absentmindedly scratching his bare chest, the only thing Jeff could say was, &quot;Sweet.&quot;</p>
