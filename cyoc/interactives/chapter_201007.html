<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Emerald sighed, the Soul Drive gazing at the bustling lunch time traffic. The diner had done a good amount of business today, which made the green gynoid happy. Still, she had to admit, she enjoyed cooking more than waiting tables.<br />
<br />
Such was life though, the Soul Drive sisters rotated duties. Yes they all enjoyed serving humans but even they had to admit their were tasks they enjoyed more than others. Gazing at the front door, Emerald now watched as a young auburn haired man now entered with a blond woman who looked to be in her 50s. Part of Emerald found the scene to be quaint, a mother and son enjoying a late lunch. Quickly she now made her way to the pair, hoping to catch some of the conversation. &quot;Hi what can I get for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Coffee,&quot; Evan stated. &quot;What about you Aunt Morgan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How are your vanilla shakes,&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Best in town,&quot; Emerald replied cheerfully, quickly making one for the middle aged sorceress. Morgan now eagerly eyed it, taking a sip as her eyes went wide in astonishment. &quot;You certainly weren&#39;t lying this is fantastic,&quot; she exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Emerald now beamed at the two, unaware of who they were. &quot;Thanks Miss,&quot; she smiled. &quot;Haven&#39;t seen you around before? Are you and your nephew new in town?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just passing through,&quot; Evan stated. &quot;Can you give us a moment to decide?&quot; Emerald nodded, leaving a pair of menus as she now made her way towards another table.<br />
<br />
&quot;She seems nice,&quot; Morgan&#39;s said in between sips. &quot;What did you say they were? Soul Drives?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Evan said softly. &quot;Robots with souls. They wish to serve humans but they have desires, wishes, even hobbies.&quot; Morgan simply nodded, reaching out with her magic as she continued to enjoy her shake. &quot;Yep the magic is very familiar,&quot; she said softly. &quot;It feels like my moms.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aunt Katie,&quot; Evan sighed. &quot;The original Catalyst.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I only ever called her mom,&quot; Morgan smirked. &quot;In fact, we didn&#39;t even know about a Catalyst until I was around your age.&quot; Evan simply nodded, the dark wizard sporting a sullen expression as Morgan happily drank her milkshake. How could she seem so content after finding out she was at the mercy of the Normal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your stressed Evan,&quot; she said, gazing at the young wizard. Evan said nothing, continuing to stare off into nothing. &quot;I can tell. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I understand. Alot has changed since, well, we already know what happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry I wasn&#39;t there to help you Morgan,&quot; he replied sadly. &quot;It&#39;s just...things got so complicated after Uncle Calebs death.&quot;<br />
<br />
Morgan simply nodded, gazing at her nephew. According to everything she had learned since reviving from cryo sleep, it had been almost 30 years since she had gone to defend to Lycan kingdom. Since then, many things had changed. Most of the people she knew were gone and her favorite nephew had taken a dark turn.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can sense alot of darkness in you Evan,&quot; she said sadly. &quot;Your dark magic is practically overflowing. Plus, you always make that face whenever your sad about something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do not,&quot; Evan replied defensively, causing Morgan to giggle. &quot;Okay maybe,&quot; he relented. &quot;But Morgan you have to understand. I...I&#39;ve done some horrible things. Things in retrospect, well, maybe were a bit rash. In worried you&#39;ll hate me for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Morgan now paused, gently pushing her milkshake to the side as she took the dark wizards hand. &quot;Listen Evan,&quot; she stated. &quot;Look, I know were not exactly on the greatest situation right now. Working for this...Boss. Serving the Normal, a group that slaughtered my adopted family and many others but we have to find a silver lining.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Silver lining,&quot; Evan balked. &quot;Morgan, if we don&#39;t help these people they&#39;ll destroy us. Deapite our magic there&#39;s nothing we can do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you honestly think this is the first hopeless situation I&#39;ve been in,&quot; Morgan answered flatly. &quot;Do you have any idea the kind of things your mother and I used to do or what I did when I was Morgan Lefay? Nothing is ever hopeless.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wish I had your optimism,&quot; Evan grumbled. Morgan simply smiled, patting Evans hand as she gazed at the young man intently. &quot;So what is it that this Boss wants us to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This Catalyst,&quot; Evan spat. &quot;This punk kid named Darren. Reshaping the world in his ideal image. Making these Soul Drives. I&#39;m the one that should have been Catalyst.&quot; Morgan simply shook her head as she cast an almost motherly look at Evan. &quot;You know that&#39;s not how it works.&quot;<br />
<br />
Evan paused, sighing before giving his aunt a reluctant nod. &quot;I know. Mom said the same thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Morgan smirked, patting her nephews hand. While they may be stuck serving the Normal for now, she would do everything in her power to protect him. As long as her programming didn&#39;t interfere. &quot;Evan listen,&quot; Morgan said softly. &quot;I know were in a tough spot. Hell, I know that I may not even be able to control my own body sometimes but I promise you this. I won&#39;t let anything happen to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Evan smiled, feeling for the first time in ages as if someone had his best interests at heart. It was Morgan&#39;s next words though that scattered that illusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;I promised your mother I would always look out for you. We always believed you had a good heart.&quot;<br />
<br />
Evan sighed, his shoulders slumping. How would Morgan react to what he had done to not only his mother but to Morgan&#39;s mother as well. He was certain she would hate him, despise him, see him as nothing more than a monster. Still, he couldn&#39;t keep this secret from his favorite aunt. &quot;Morgan there&#39;s something I need to tell you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Morgan now listened carefully as Evan explained everything that had transpired after she vanished. How he had gone dark, killed Mika, killed his own father, killed Morgan&#39;s own mother Katie. How he had been resurrected by the Normal somehow, confronting and killing his own mother before attacking Yuriko and the new Catalyst. For Evan the experience was almost cathartic, tears now freely streaming down his cheeks. He had done so much evil, yet telling someone he trusted more than anyone made him feel just a little better. Glancing at Morgan though, he began to wonder if he had done the right thing.<br />
<br />
Morgan&#39;s face was ashen, tears streaming down her cheeks as she stared at her beloved nephew in horror. Evan, the boy she had loved unconditionally, the boy she viewed as almost an adopted son, had murder her own mother. It was shocking, heart breaking, she felt numb, nauseous, staring at the boy who had fallen so far.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morgan?&quot;<br />
<br />
Morgan glanced down, watching as Evan now reached out, trying to take her hand. Instinctively, she now withdrew it, still unable to comprehend the evil Evan had wrought.<br />
<br />
Evan&#39;s face fell, he should have known better than to think he could be forgiven. If Morgan hadn&#39;t been unfrozen he never would have experienced any of this. This was the Catalysts fault. He would destroy Darren for ruining his relationship with his aunt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Evan?&quot;<br />
<br />
Evan glanced up, seeing the Morgan&#39;s face was still ashen, yet she was now reaching for his hand. Thw boy eagerly reaching over, squeezing it tightly as he seemed to beg for her forgiveness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Evan,&quot; she repeated, her voice barely more than a whisper. &quot;My God, you&#39;ve fallen so far. How could you give into the darkness like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry Morgan.&quot;<br />
<br />
Morgan took a breath, still stunned by her nephews actions. &quot;I&#39;ll be honest,&quot; she started. &quot;I don&#39;t know if I will be able to forgive you.&quot; Evans heart sank, his darkness and anger seeming to build within him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You killed my mother,&quot; she said. &quot;Killed your father, killed Lynne. I&#39;m shocked at how dark you&#39;ve become.&quot;<br />
<br />
Evan said nothing, his face contorting in rage in despair. Morgan now squeezed his hand tighter as she lovingly looked into his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry I couldn&#39;t be there for you,&quot; she sighed. &quot;I&#39;m sorry the Normal took me away. If I had been there, maybe, just maybe I could have kept you from turning to darkness.&quot;<br />
<br />
Evan said nothing, his rage dissipating as Morgan gave him a sad look. &quot;I&#39;m going to help you Evan,&quot; she said. &quot;I know there&#39;s good in you. Deep down your still the same good person that I&#39;ve watched over there entire life. I don&#39;t want to hurt this new Catalyst or Yuriko but I promise I will protect you. And help you find the light once again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Evan said nothing, giving his aunt a small nod of acceptance. He wasn&#39;t sure what he expected to hear from his aunt but this did help. As the two now ate in silence, they both pondered where they could go from here.</p>
