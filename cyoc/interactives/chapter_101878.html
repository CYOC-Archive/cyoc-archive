<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">**Happy February 29th - bj88<br />
<br />
Hanson, buried under piles of dead leaves from the first floor and dirt, was too preoccupied setting up his gun to notice the werewolf creeping up a tree several feet away. <br />
<br />
Werewolves weren’t exactly built for climbing trees. So instead of climbing straight up like most felines did, they got a bit of a running start before leaping up, using their powerful legs to propel themselves up. Peter Russo grabbed the first stable branch he could see, and pulled himself up. There, he swung his gun around his chest, and aimed it squarely at the werebull hidden on the ground below. <br />
<br />
The bull wasn’t transformed, which made things a bit more difficult in terms of aiming. At least if he’d been in his fursona he’’d be a much bigger target, making it so much easier to hit him. <br />
<br />
“Position?” Evan Lawson’s voice buzzed in Peter’s ear piece. <br />
<br />
“I’ve got a lock on the target. He’s about twenty yards from your location. He’s got several weapons, but only one sniper rifle pointed in the direction of the house. Tread lightly Beta.” Peter said. <br />
<br />
“Copy. We’re moving in, stand by.” Evan said. He and the two werewolves from the MLPD Were Team sped forward and stopped once they could see the man’s boots sticking out from under the crude camouflage. Evan nodded to the Were Team leader, Jared Hardy, who pointed his gun and announced their arrival.<br />
<br />
“Moon Lake Police, put down your weapon and surrender!” Hardy shouted. <br />
<br />
Hanson’s body tensed. How had they found him so quickly? Could Bower have miscalculated the MLPD’s effectiveness. Or worse, had Evan Lawson spotted Bower and Bruce and finished them off. <br />
<br />
“No, there would be more noise then. Jere wouldn’t go down without a fight.” Hanson thought. <br />
<br />
“I’m only going to ask one more time. Put the gun down, and surrender!” <br />
<br />
“Fat chance buddy.” Hanson shouted. From underneath his well hidden body, he threw a smoke bomb. It collided with a tree, and burst, sending red smoke everywhere. Evan and the two Were Team members jumped backwards, while Hanson rose and fled towards the Lawson house. <br />
<br />
He needed to warn Bower and Bruce before they got caught too. But Hanson didn’t get very far. Peter Russo now had a clear shot, and easily took Hanson down with one clean shot to the leg. Hanson was quickly overwhelmed by the werewolves, and Evan slapped cuffs on the man’s wrists. <br />
<br />
“Any idea who this is?” Hardy asked as Evan yanked the werebull to an upright position. The other officer took away Hanson’s sniper rifle, and emptied the clip. <br />
<br />
“No clue. But we’ll find out one way or another.” Evan said with a malicious grin on his face. Hanson gulped, realizing what was going to happen to him. Evan threw Hanson back to the floor, and jammed his gun right into his face.<br />
<br />
“Either you talk, or I start blasting off body parts.” Evan growled. Hanson couldn’t meet the angry werewolf’s eyes. They were completely feral, and bright blue like his human eyes. It took every bit of willpower Hanson had not to knuckle under. <br />
<br />
“Go ahead, shoot me. You won’t get any information.” Hanson said. Evan smirked. Hardy took his gun, and shot Hanson’s knee cap to pieces. Hanson screamed in pain, but Evan smiled.<br />
<br />
“Want to amend that statement?” he asked. <br />
<br />
“Go to hell.” Hanson spit. <br />
<br />
“Suit yourself.” Evan said. This time, he took his combat knife, which was a good ten inches long, and rammed it into Hanson’s shoulder. He twisted the blade, severing the muscles. Hanson felt a burning pain spread as his body was torn apart.<br />
<br />
“How about now?” Evan asked, his voice barely a whisper. <br />
<br />
Hanson shuddered, but managed to say, “FUCK, YOU!” <br />
<br />
Evan kicked the man before him in the groin, and then ripped the knife from his shoulder. He stuck it back into the crook of Hanson’s arm. <br />
<br />
“We can do just fine without your information. So it’s up to you if you want to continue this, or let us end your life quickly.” Hardy said as Evan continued to mutilate Hanson. Hardy knew the man was being a bit excessive, but thought he had every right to be. After everything his family had been through, Hardy didn’t care how far Evan went. These sick bastards were going to get their “just desserts”. <br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Derek, Evan’s best man (a Beta’s beta) watched Bower and Bruce approaching his comrade’s house from afar. He picked a decent sized shrub to hide behind, and waited. <br />
<br />
Bruce shifted back to his human form, and stashed his own weapons in his duffel. He took a few deep breaths, waiting for Bower’s command, and steeling his nerves for what was to come. He waited and waited, but not command came. The family would think he was some kind of whacko, just standing on their front steps. <br />
<br />
“SON OF A BITCH!” Bower roared from behind the house. Bruce grabbed his bag and ran to see what was wrong. And once he got to the backyard he knew what the problem was. <br />
<br />
There was an obvious scent trail leading from the house, and back into the woods. It was a female’s, probably Spencer’s since it was a mix of a wolf’s and a panther’s. And then a normal boy’s. Evan Lawson’s scent followed. <br />
<br />
“They’re not here then.” Bruce sighed. Had they come here for nothing? The Lawson’s weren’t home, which they should have anticipated. It was close to the holidays, they might have gone out of town. But Bower said he’d confirmed they were staying in town for Thanksgiving. <br />
<br />
“Thank you for that enlightening fact Bruce! Damn it, what the fuck is going on?!” Bower snarled. He couldn’t contain himself anymore, and burst through his clothing as he assumed his were form. Bower was beyond livid. He hadn’t driven at 120 mph, and hiked through the woods NOT to kill someone. <br />
<br />
“Well, what do you want to do?” Bruce asked. <br />
<br />
“Follow the scent, see where it leads. If they aren’t home, they must be close. Lawson’s wife has family around here somewhere.” Bower grumbled.<br />
<br />
“What if it’s a trap?” <br />
<br />
“How the hell would they have known we were coming?” <br />
<br />
“I don’t know, but we can’t rule it out as a possibility.” <br />
<br />
“Can’t we? What, are you wimping out on me? Too scared to face Lawon?” <br />
<br />
“No, but I don’t want to waltz into someone’s death trap because you’re too blinded by your anger to see….”<br />
<br />
Bower growled viciously, and pressed a clawed paw to Bruce’s throat. Bruce transformed, and held out his own huge paw to catch his “friend’s”. His bear form was based on an American grizzly bear. Thick brown fur, and long claws gripped Bower’s arm, which was like a pencil compared to Bruce’s. <br />
<br />
“You lead me to my death, I’ll make sure we BOTH rot in Hell.” Bruce said. Bower maintained his cool, and told Bruce he was going whether he joined or not.</p>
