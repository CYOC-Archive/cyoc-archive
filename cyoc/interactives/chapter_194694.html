<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You shudder at the thought of what is to come and stand up. Your dress rides up just a bit and you struggle trying to pull the back side down below your ass cheeks again now that the addition of high heels has changed your posture. But you manage to get it just in time for the bus to stop in front of your house. <br />
<br />
You take a few nervous steps towards the bus, trying your hardest to not stumble or bend in a way that pops your back lower half out of the dress again. You get on the bus and the driver smiles and actually compliments you on your &quot;beautiful&quot; dress. You do your best to force out a polite smile and quickly take your seat. <br />
<br />
Quickly was the mistake though, as your fast movement pops your ass out from the bottom of your dress again and you spend the next minute or so struggling to pull it back down. You are so focused on your back side that you have completely forgotten about your front half and how weird you look while attempting to fix your dress. Let alone thinking about your tail.<br />
<br />
You finally manage it and sigh, feeling a bit tired already from just keeping yourself looking as decent as possible. You look down and nearly gasp as you quickly pull your muffin out from your cleavage. You don&#39;t even remember placing it in there. You spend the rest of your bus ride eating your muffin while trying in vain to keep a low profile.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, getting off the bus is a better experience then getting on it, and you are able to make it into the school problem free, relatively speaking. Ironically, many girls are complimenting either your dress, your heels, sometimes both even. Some of them give you weird looks too, as if for some reason they suddenly dislike you now. <br />
<br />
It really starts getting weird though when Rachel, a girl you wouldn&#39;t ever normally be able to speak with, approaches you and not only speaks to you, but throws herself at you and hugs you like you are her BFF since birth. She even gropes your ass mid hug. <br />
<br />
Rachel is basically know as the girl every guy loves to hang out with. She dresses provocatively where and whenever she can, always flirty with just about everyone, including teachers, guys, girls, even with some of the security guards. She just tends to stay away from certain people who she didn&#39;t consider &quot;fun&quot;. You, until apparently now, we&#39;re one of those people. <br />
<br />
&quot;See, I told you that you would look sexy as fuck in that dress&quot; boasts Rachel. Well, now you know understand the origins of this dumb dress at least. And as if on cue, your dress pops up again. &quot;Ha, here let me fix that for ya.&quot; Says Rachel who quickly digs in her purse and then reaches over you to fix your dress. You feel your breasts press into eachother, something Rachel clearly has intended on doing from the getgo. And though yours are by far larger, her pair isn&#39;t small either. And this would normally be quite a welcomed moment for you, if literally the reason behind it wasn&#39;t involving your ass fitting into a short, tight dress. <br />
<br />
Rachel sticks something to your ass, presses the dress on it, and then slaps it with a loud spank. &quot;There, you&#39;re all taped up now&quot; She says. You do find it is now much better and your dress is no longer able to slip over your ass as easily thanks to the tape. <br />
<br />
It&#39;s at this time that your actual best friend shows up. &quot;Morning ladies&quot; he says to the both of you. You are confused by this are are about to ask him why he called you a lady as well when he leans over and kisses Rachel, then you. &quot;Max!&quot; You say pushing away from him. &quot;What&#39;s wrong? Don&#39;t you like me kissing my two sexy girlfriend&#39;s in the morning?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you feeling alright girl? Usually he has to push himself off of you&quot; adds Rachel. You panic and open your bag and grab your ID. To your dismay, instead of the letter &quot;M&quot;, a big letter &quot;F&quot; is shown for your sex, though it appears to have been marked in with a pink colored ink pen, and not printed on the offficial card, as the letter &quot;M&quot; is just barely visible beneath it. The same style of editing has also crossed out your first name and replaced it with the name &quot;Ashley&quot;. Its the very name that your Mom once told you about, and how that if you had been born as her daughter, she would have named you that.<br />
<br />
You ID also showed a photo of you, now with you enormous boobs squeezed into a one size too small crop top. And had the frilly ridges of your pink bra poking out of the neckline too. The top wasn&#39;t even on you properly and the left strap was tucked under your left arm even.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyways, I got to get to class now, see you too later&quot; Says Max, kissing only Rachel goodbye. Your tail moved on its own and wrapped around his hand. Max smiled and kissed you on the cheek, surprising you again. You were so focused on your ID card that you didn&#39;t even notice that he had walked right up to you. But you don&#39;t push him away either as a new feeling inside of you was spontaniously turned on as if a switch had been flipped. You instead pull him around to your mouth and properly kiss him back, with tongue. <br />
<br />
In your head, you are horrified by what you are doing. But it also feels really good to be doing this too. Max pushes you off of him this time and grins. &quot;That&#39;s my girl.&quot; He says, grabbing a handful of your ass and then finally leaves for his class. You regain control and nearly slump to the ground. Rachel catches you and manages to just keep you standing, though she too is struggling in her own heels to lift you up. &quot;Ash, wife are you doing? Stand up girl&quot; she begs as you come back to your senses. You steady yourself and Rachel looks at you with even more concern. <br />
<br />
&quot;Somethings up with you. Come with me.&quot; Rachel grabs your wrist tightly and pulls you into the nearest girl&#39;s room and then into the back stall. She sits you on the toilet and looks down at you with a displeased pout. &quot;Alright spill it. What&#39;s up with you today?&quot;<br />
<br />
You try explaining things to her and Rachel shakes her head. &quot;The hell are you on about? Ash, you&#39;ve been a girl for 3 years now. We are literally so close of best friends that we are actually dating the same guy, at the same time, and are happy about it. You were born with a tail too. We even took each other&#39;s virginity. So when I say something is up with you, I think I would know. Now tell me what it is?&quot; Demands Rachel, not believing your story at all. <br />
<br />
You finally have enough and just break down from all of the pent up stress. Rachel switches gears really quickly at seeing you start crying and tries to calm you down. &quot;Its going to be alright Ash. Let&#39;s say that I believe your story, what can I even do about it? From what I can see, everything is working as it always has. I can&#39;t even begin to imagine a reality where I treat you essentially like an old ex. If you ask me, that me can go fuck herself and you should just accept and enjoy this version of your life instead. It sounds way more enjoyable, at least in my opinion.&quot;<br />
<br />
You calm down after a bit and Rachel helps to clean you up. &quot;Hey, as your BFF, I will believe your story. Even though it is completely ridiculous.&quot; She hugs you and you feel a bit of gooey wetness trickling down your inner leg.  You break off the hug and push your tits out of the way so that you can examine you inner thigh. Seeing your struggle, Rachel squats down and checks for you. She then giggles and you feel her fingernails scraping something off your inner legs. <br />
<br />
Rachel stands up with an almost clear, gooey substance oozing down her fingers and smiles widely. &quot;Someone&#39;s horny.&quot; She then sucks her index finger clean and flips you off with her still gooey middle finger. She then smudges it all over your lips, sticking her finger inside your mouth and everything. &quot;Hmm Hmm. So, how does your own bitch juice taste? Its good right?&quot; Says Rachel while you do your best to get her to stop cleaning off her middle finger with your mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, stop!&quot; You manage to say, cheering up a little bit as well. You lick your lips clean and ask her what that stuff actually was as it didn&#39;t taste all that bad actually. &quot;It&#39;s your own dick drool Ash.&quot; Explains Rachel while cleaning off the rest of her hand in the sink. You feel instant regret about giving her your assesment just now. You wipe up your inner thighs with a paper towel and adjust your dress and breasts in the mirror a bit before walking out of the bathroom. <br />
<br />
You take Rachel&#39;s words to heart and somehow end up having an alright rest of the day at school. You even start messing around with Max a bit more just for the hell of it. Durring lunch, you waited for him to sit down at the table, then you sat down right in his lap, much to Rachel&#39;s surprise and immediate enjoyment. <br />
<br />
You even manage to sleep well this night. Though finding the right sleeping position when you have a pair of pillowy watermelons and a tail to consider was a challenge itself. However, you are not prepared for the surprise you receive in the morning...</p>
