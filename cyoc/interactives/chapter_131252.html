<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sarah’s car was not in sight when I arrived home.<br />
<br />
Biddy was inside the house, he had heard me and was scratching at the front door. That’s strange I thought. I swear I had put him out this morning.<br />
<br />
I entered and gave Biddy a scratch. “Have you been locked in the house all day. Poor fella. I’ll get changed and we can go for a walk”<br />
I went to the bedroom and took off my work clothes. I was searching for a pair of shorts to put on when the en-suite door opened. <br />
Sarah was wearing her maroon dress, the same one I had worn to the engagement dinner. However I took a second look. It wasn’t Sarah it was Jenna. She had the medallion around her neck. I guessed Sarah had turned into Jenna as a surprise for me and I had walked in on her as she was finishing the change. “Sorry I should have knocked”<br />
<br />
“It’s your house Rod. What do you think? Do you like the look?”<br />
<br />
Jenna was a stunning looking woman. “Yeah you look great” I could feel my penis pressing hard in my boxers causing them to tent.<br />
<br />
“I see you are impressed, she came to me and gave my crotch a gentle squeeze”<br />
<br />
“Careful of the medallion……” She kissed me. She hugged me tight. I felt a zap of static electricity. Oh hell, Now I’m going to change too. We will end up as two Jenna’s for the night. <br />
<br />
“What was that Zap?” She seemed genuinely surprised. <br />
<br />
“You forgot you still had the medallion around your neck”<br />
<br />
“Oh this, I found it in that cupboard”<br />
<br />
Alarm bells started to ring. Could this be the real Jenna? “Ok Sarah, you got me”<br />
<br />
“Sarah? Do I look like Sarah?” She was genuinely bemused.<br />
<br />
“This is no longer funny”. I could feel my hair starting to grow. I looked at Sarah/Jenna her hair was getting shorter. “You should get out of that dress”<br />
<br />
“Now you’re talking” I pulled the medallion off her and placed it on the bed then helped her out of the dress. She gave me a kiss and placed one of my hands on her breast.  “I’ve been wanting to do this since Sarah first bought you home”… “What’s happening to your hair?”<br />
<br />
“Come to the bathroom and watch in the mirror” I pulled her into the bathroom and she was shocked to see her reflection. “What’s happening to my hair?”<br />
<br />
“You are really Jenna aren’t you?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, I’m Jenna”<br />
<br />
“It’s the medallion, let me explain”<br />
<br />
“I’m getting taller and you’re shrinking”<br />
<br />
“We are swapping bodies. The medallion is causing me to become you and you will become me”<br />
<br />
“How” ….. “My voice” It was becoming deeper.<br />
<br />
“Just watch, there is nothing we can do for 12 hours. You will want to take off that bra”<br />
<br />
I now had enlarged nipples and shoulder length hair. My face was smooth and my waist constricting. <br />
<br />
Jenna had shed her bra and watched as her breasts shrank. Her shoulders expanded and a nub began to appear in her panties. She quickly pulled the panties off and watched as what was once her clitoris pushed out and became a small penis.<br />
 <br />
We were now of equal height. My hair was longer than hers or should I say his. <br />
<br />
“You said the medallion caused this”<br />
<br />
“It’s called the medallion of Zulo. If two people touch it at the same time it will cause them to change into each other”<br />
<br />
“But how”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know. Genuine magic”<br />
<br />
We watched in silence until the changes were complete. I was looking at my reflection. It was that of Jenna. I was now 5 foot 7 with wavy blond hair and an hourglass figure. Jenna standing beside me was now 5 foot 11 with a muscular torso and short dark hair. <br />
<br />
“We should get dressed. I am surprised that Sarah is not already home” I reached for and put on the bra and panties that Jenna had previously worn. “What were you doing here by the way?”<br />
<br />
In his masculine voice Jenna said “I came around to play with Biddy. Then I saw a window partially open and decided to see if Sarah had any new clothes I could borrow” He didn’t sound the least bit guilty. <br />
<br />
“Where are the clothes you wore over? I don’t want to be wearing Sarah’s clothes when she gets here”<br />
<br />
“You have done this before haven’t you. How long have you had the medallion?”<br />
<br />
“Maybe… we can talk about that later. Fetch me what you were wearing. I’ll get you something”<br />
<br />
I went to the bedroom and found a pair of shorts and a tee-shirt. Jenna came and gave me a bundle of clothes. It was a pink singlet top, blue jeans and white sandals. We both dressed. Once I had managed to pull up the skin tight jeans, I looked at Jenna. He was dressed and had the medallion in his hands.<br />
<br />
“Ok tell me how this works” We moved into the lounge he sat on the couch. I sat on the chair by the computer.<br />
<br />
“It seems to have a 12 hour cooling off period. You cannot change twice within 12 hours. But it can work on someone else. If you touch it to some clothing it will change you into whoever last wore that clothing” <br />
<br />
“So you and Sarah have swapped?”<br />
<br />
“We have” <br />
<br />
“Did you have sex when you were swapped?” I felt myself blushing “No need to answer that. You must have enjoyed it” The blushing got worse. “I would like to try sex as a man”<br />
<br />
“Sarah will be home any minute” <br />
<br />
“I’ve got at least 12 hours” He said. For some reason that statement scared me.<br />
<br />
Biddy was barking at the door. We heard the key in the lock and Sarah entered. Biddy jumped with excitement welcoming her home. She saw me sitting there “Jenna what are you doing here?” <br />
<br />
“Hi Sarah, It’s me there has been ………”<br />
<br />
Jenna approached and reached for Biddy and picked him up.<br />
<br />
I continued “An accident we have swapped bodies” Sarah looked at Jenna in Rod’s body <br />
<br />
“Jenna?  Ouch” Jenna had pressed the medallion against Sarah’s face. In the same hand was Biddy’s collar. “What have you done?”<br />
<br />
Jenna put the medallion around his neck. I tried to snatch it off him but he pushed me to the floor with ease. I was helpless against his strength. “This medallion is mine”. He ran out the back door. I chased him but he got away from me by jumping the rear fence into the vacant block behind. In Jenna’s body I struggled to climb up on the fence. When I reached the top he was nowhere to be seen.  <br />
<br />
I went back inside. “He got away” I said to Sarah. She was sitting on the couch, looking at her hands. She was shrinking. The backs of her hands were turning furry. Her hair was turning white and getting shorter. <br />
<br />
“I’m turning into Biddy” She looked at me with desperation “Will it scramble my brain?” I held her tight while she was still mostly human. I held her as she changed into a duplicate of Biddy. After 15 minutes she started to lose her vocal cords her speech started to get incomprehensible. 5 minutes later all he/she could do was growl. <br />
<br />
“Do you still understand me?” I asked. <br />
<br />
“Rrrrrr”<br />
<br />
“Is that yes or no?”<br />
<br />
“Rrrrr”<br />
<br />
“This won’t work. Lick my hand for yes and growl for no. Do you understand?” She/he licked my hand.<br />
<br />
“Does it hurt?”<br />
<br />
“Rrrrr”<br />
<br />
By now he looked 100% puppy, a duplicate of Biddy. Still tangled in Sarah’s clothes. I disentangled him from the clothes and sat him on my knee. “I’ll have to find Jenna” he licked me. Do you want to stay here?” <br />
<br />
“Rrrrr”<br />
<br />
“Come with me then” he licked me.<br />
<br />
The real Biddy had been watching with curiosity and jumped up on the couch with us, smelling the new arrival. Sarah sniffed him back. I got up to retrieve the keys to Sarah’s car from her bag. The two dogs jumped off the couch and followed me. One sniffed the others bum. I was surprised when the other dog reciprocated. I had no idea which dog was which, they were identical. <br />
<br />
“Ok Sarah follow me” They both did. Bugger I thought. I grabbed Biddy’s collar and put it on one of the dogs. At least now I could see a difference. But I didn’t know which dog was Sarah. “Sarah if you understand me walk into the kitchen” The dog with the collar walked into the kitchen. Of course the other dog followed. “Sarah if you are wearing the collar go to the front door and growl” The dog with the collar went to the front door and growled. I was relieved that at least I knew which dog Sarah was. <br />
<br />
“Let’s see if we can find Jenna and that medallion” I went out to the car with both dogs following. We drove around the block and the nearby streets there was no sign of Jenna. <br />
<br />
In despair I gave up and returned to the house. We would have to wait until Jenna returned, if he returned.</p>
