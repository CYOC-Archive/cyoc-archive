<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brent looked as shi had the national guard to help. Shi had come a long way and was contemplating, perhaps shi should keep all hir eggs, you know, keep a family together. Sure they are a product of rape, but after what shi seen parents do to their own daughter after shi changed, how could shi trust anyone with hir babies. Shi was walking and seen that they were in Atlantic City. The swat teams had worked their way to Newark, to meet this head on, where Brent and the National Guard took Atlantic City. Shi loved Atlantic City, but this.... this isn&#39;t how shi imagined it. Shi looked and told the officer in charge that should he find any orphaned kats to have them taken to join the one shi choose to adopt. Shi&#39;ll see that they get taken to a new location and put up for adoption.<br />
<br />
Brent had a lot to think about. Shi will be a mother soon and shi would need to make as many preparations as shi could. But for now, shi needed to make sure the world is safer for hir babies. Regardless of how many their were. However, shi did freeze when shi saw a sign that read &quot;Expert on all kinds of Insects, Arachnids, Scorpions, etc.&quot; Shi walked in and looked around. &quot;He.... hello.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I&#39;ll be right down.&quot; As shi waited a girl, red hair, and blue eyes, she was holding a spider and then put it in. She had read the news about the outbreaks, and knew that Jersey had gotten hit, but didn&#39;t budge one bit from her spot. &quot;How can I help... you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I seen that you are an expert on insect related creatures.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am. And how can I help?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, as you can see, I&#39;m one of those creatures. And see, I was wondering if you know anything about breeding stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I certainly do. Come on in. I&#39;m Melly.&quot; She said sitting down as Brent followed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Brent, Brent Wise. And a victim of the Vatican Outbreak.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that&#39;s a shame really, but you certainly have that.... glimmer of beauty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what is it you need help with Brent?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you see, as you can tell, I&#39;m based on the black....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The king scorpion to be exact.&quot; She interupted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. Anyway, I ended up pregnant from a rape, and was wondering if you&#39;d know how many eggs a scorpion typically lays.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, normally they can lay in a range of twenty to two thousand eggs, but it&#39;s usually one every five that are fertilized successfully. The others act as duds for any egg theif out there.&quot; She said. &quot;So how many do you have in you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d say around twenty.&quot; Shi replied.<br />
<br />
Melly smiled. &quot;Well that means you&#39;ll have four young ones.&quot; She walked up and rubbed her on the belly.<br />
<br />
Brent loved the feeling on hir belly, but already had hir mind set on a girl. Though Shi was a Rapkat. Brent looks. &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, my pleasure, I do wish I could study you more though. You are a perfect specimen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brent thought. &quot;Actually you may be able to do just that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How so?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we got a headquarters in Janace, perhaps you can do some studies there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll keep that in mind, Brent.&quot; She grabbed her stuff and headed strait to the Airport.<br />
<br />
Brent however continued his journey through Atlantic City, vaccinating every kat shi could. They wrapped up in Jersey and got word that the spreading of this outbreak remained along the coast, so shi and hir team, with some orphaned kats, headed back to Long Island, where Brent was &quot;attacked&quot; by a small kat shi personally adopted.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Torrent, Aqua, and the lot of Sharkats and Dolphkats had made their way through Hartford, some headed to Providence and others to Boston to ensure there were no mess ups. Torrent and Aqua, formerly known as Chris and Christina, were great friends before this, and now were mates. Torrent and Aqua were the first of many bi pedal kats. They had found some of these kats were based on rodents and lapines. Which they had  vaccinated. Once they had finished they worked their way to the next town Torrent had very little to do in each small town, but the larger cities they had nothing. They found that the cities were blocked off. All in them, save for Hartford, Boston, and Providence where blocked off. It was the outskirts of the other communities that got hit. Once the three small states were taken care of they moved on to Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont which they found weren&#39;t hit by the outbreak, so they made their way back to Long Island.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------<br />
<br />
As for Danna, Mikkie and their teams, they made their ways to upstate New York and Buffalo, having made sure that it had not reached there. Once all the out break was done, they returned to search for clues, meeting up with the rest of the teams on Long Island. Having pretty much saved all of the east coast. Justin having met up with hir brother, and witnessing hir change, to Brent deciding to adopt a kat and keeping hir children, things went well. Sally was steamed when shi found hir little ones snuck home to help, but was happy they wanted to help fight this as much as they did. Charlie was also relaxed.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The only two not back were Nikole and Luna. They were searching the site where the missile went of. However when they found the parts, they were in shock to find, not only had it been one missile, but been three. One the facing from the ocean, the other inland to the west and one from the south west. Two with the North Korean flag the other with North Korea&#39;s only ally. Cuba. They gathered all the clues they could and made way to Long Island. This had turned to be one of the longest days of their lives, but knew what they did had to have been done. Just then, as they were nearing the ferry that would take them to Long Island, Luna spots someone, this wasn&#39;t a kat, but this person was trying to hide. Shi dropped her things and gave chase. Once to the alley, shi remembered the report on what happened to Charlie and entered with caution. Once shi approached shi looked in and spotted some children turned kats. One was playing a prank on hir, but shi knelt down. The kids were just having some fun, however it was short lived when a woman walked out. She looked on. &quot;Well, I see our partner&#39;s work on you, Wolfkat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna turned to spot one of the Leutinents. &quot;Well, we&#39;ve been looking for you and your friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, we know, but you won&#39;t catch us, not that easily. You see, we&#39;ve got plenty of hideouts.&quot; She smiled then looks. &quot;You were a fool to come in here alone, you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who said shi&#39;s alone.&quot; Nikole looked grabbing the woman on the shoulders, and before she could do anything, Nikole knocked her plum out, and hoisted her over hir shoulder. Shi smiled. &quot;Lucky I watch your back.&quot; Soon the two were on Long Island and all were ready to board the plane to head home. Raul was prepping to get some information from the scientist, and relieved that now there were only four to find. Especially after Maria confirmed she was one of them.<br />
<br />
But, what had concerned the vice president was the fact that not only did they have North Korea to worry about now, they had Cuba. North Korea had masked one of their own as the South Korean Ambassador to take their attention off Cuba. Now they knew of a potential location that housed one of the scientists.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Once back home, they had taken the scientist and removed any and all tracking devices, particularly ones they found imbedded in her skin, then tossed her in a cell. They were now four away from ending these outbreaks. However, Jess was upset to find Ryles had gone with Casey to find her mate&#39;s ex without so much a call. Now they had to wait for.... As shi finished the thought they spotted another aircraft. Jess rushed to greet her former pet, and Charlie and Brent got the shock of their lives. It was their father. They ran over to help him as he stepped off the plane and walked with his saughters to a medical facility to be treated for any and all wounds. Nikole only smiled, though the two divorced shi was still friends with him, even if shi was mad at him for cheating on hir. Somehow though she felt that now, their families were all finally becoming complete. It was all pleasant until Sally found her children nearly all gone.</p>
