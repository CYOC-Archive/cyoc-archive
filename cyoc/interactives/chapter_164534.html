<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The first half of the basketball game things were going well for the home (Drew&#39;s) team. It was currently 10-5... without Drew even existing or any players taking up his spot... However Dawn didn&#39;t have much time as the cheerleaders were stretching and going over routines. Memories of meetups and hard practice for sure helped with the routine. This wasn&#39;t one of the many competitions, but just more practice doing the choreography in front of an audience... and in front of an audience there was always the fear of messing up and then everyone knows you did it. Some stress management techniques and everyone on the team being proficient in the routine managed to get through a rather average cheer session. It was impressive enough for the crowd and while there was a kink or two to work out still it didn&#39;t seem like anyone really noticed. <br />
<br />
With the few minutes of cheering done the cheerleaders went to some chairs on the side of the court... and while Dawn managed to get a chair next to Alice she also got a seat next to Steve a talented sophomore who was one of the best members on the team, and when Dawn was Drew his best advice was &quot;Try a little harder.&quot; Thankfully for Steve Dawn had basically no memories of Steve outside of maybe a Hi in the halls. That said Steve had very short blonde hair, was rather tall, and for sure rather fit. Dawn had to admit he was a rather fetching lad, but Steve covered in sweat and Dawn sweating as well it wasn&#39;t that romantic of a scene. <br />
<br />
Steve stiffly said &quot;Um, you did pretty well out there Dawn.&quot; <br />
&quot;Oh, thank you... You scored plenty of baskets.&quot; Dawn replied<br />
Steve nodded and said &quot;Only thanks to my team helping out, but basketball is a sport that makes the efforts of guy with the ball more noticeable. You did great flinging some of your teammates, and doing those flips.&quot; <br />
Dawn chuckled a bit and said &quot;Thanks about the flips, but the flinging kinda uses the strength of both. Using momentum you know?&quot; A whistle was blown and the Coach called Steve out. <br />
Steve said &quot;Well I&#39;m off.&quot; then jogged off to play some ball. Meanwhile Alice who was listening into the conversation was grinning a little. It seemed that during the time Steve was out the Big Cats had lost their lead as it was now 16-18. Neck and neck the Big Cats were struggling as their opposition got a better idea of how to deal with the Big Cats. Not a lot of time left and 21-23 Steve had a ball, but tired couldn&#39;t run to the enemy basket fast enough. A few seconds left, one of the enemy team running up to pressure Steve, no time to really think. Steve jumped vertically and his mind blank of thought did some quick calculations and let the ball fly. The game was over, the ball was too high for anyone to intercept and the buzzer sounded just before the ball made it&#39;s way to the rim. It started to lean out, but miraculously it ended up spinning back into the rim and made the winning basket.<br />
Drew in Dawn wanted to make the team win so... Dawn ended up using the remote to push the ball into the basket. Where was the remote considering Dawn was resting from cheerleading? Well you see she used the remote to create a compartment in her breast that the remote was teleported into. All she&#39;d have to do is press her nipple kinda hard and the remote would activate. With all eyes on the ball a discrete boob press would be hard to notice by most. Dawn smiled looking at everyone on the team screaming with victory. Then she saw Steve take a deep breath and started walking towards Dawn. Dawn felt a little uneasy and she probably should&#39;ve as when Steve got to her he knelt on one leg and crouched down a bit to get to eye level with the seated girl. <br />
Steve was breathing heavy from physical exhaustion or maybe nervousness... potentially both then asked &quot;Dawn... Would you go out with me?&quot; Dawn blushed a bit as the Drew in her was trying to tug on her brain telling her not to date the guy he hated, but the more Dawn personality wasn&#39;t exactly sure what to think. Not all the crowd noticed, but enough of them did that there was extra pressure on the two. Steve probably would&#39;ve broken down crying if he was denied in front of the crowd, and Dawn wasn&#39;t sure what to say in general. While there was still talking and noise going on elsewhere, but the general area the confession took place in felt dead silent. <br />
Dawn felt some regret in pressing her boob, but she opened her mouth and let out a &quot;Yes&quot; to the guy she didn&#39;t really know in this reality as she felt really flushed. There was a lot of talking going on, but Steve and Dawn felt like statues feeling all sweaty and burning hot from not being sure what to do now. <br />
Thankfully for them Alice stepped in and said &quot;Well then, we&#39;re all hot and sweaty here aren&#39;t we? How about we head off to the showers, and maybe meet up at that pizza party?&quot; and then took Dawn&#39;s hand to evacuate her away from the situation. In the girl&#39;s locker room and alone for a second while the rest of the cheerleaders started walking and gossiping to the lockers.<br />
Dawn asked &quot;Was I supposed to say no?&quot; <br />
Alice answered &quot;Well... Maybe? I don&#39;t think that was the situation where you could talk a bit or ask, but there&#39;s going to be a pizza party to celebrate. After we shower up and get ready you could meet and talk. He seems like a nice guy, but if you aren&#39;t feeling it you may be able to let him down slowly.&quot; <br />
Dawn nodded thinking about what she was going to do now.</p>
