<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning a still worried husband and father of two sons, Roger got up out of his bed having to face a new day of uncertainties. He showered and got dressed, before venturing to the kitchen and having then to prepare his own breakfast, since his wife Mable was incapable of doing her wifely chores, she having hoofs replacing her hands. As with any farm the animals must be tended to, and on that day he had three new ones to care for. He exited the main house, greeting his two livestock wranglers before Roger entered the barn he where he was met by Elroy. <br />
<br />
Elroy, his eldest son was a change individualist, he like his younger brother and their mother Mable had changed, been transformed, Elroy becoming as one Andalusian Mammoth Donkey stud.  The charge into such a large animal form allowed Elroy to retain more of his knowledge and memories, he seemingly elated as happy for becoming a mature Donkey. Roger rebuked his aggressive and aroused son by taking a firm grip hold to the head halter worn by Elroy, and Roger led him back to his box stall. Elroy brayed loudly at his father for treating him like he was just another farm animal and not like he was the eldest son in their family.<br />
<br />
Roger ignored what Elroy thought or wanted as he brayed, the father turning to look down across from Elroy stood there Brian the younger son, he too had transformed, becoming a smaller breed of Donkey. Roger reached out an arm and hand to pet Brian, offering the youth a sense of comfort and love. Roger smiled at Brian, he thinking of what that kid thought he was going to get to do from becoming a horny donkey, but Roger had other plans today.<br />
<br />
 Nearby stood a snuffling Jenny Donkey, it being Mable his wife transformed as well. Mable stood quivering some due to her fear from changing of species, her body ravaged by estrus pangs and terse sexual desires. Roger ignored her noises and went straight to feeding the three plus his two trotter mares that paid for the farm from their winnings.  Not a word did Roger offer to his Wife, or the farmhands, he doing his barn caring chores then left the barn and walked back to the house. A little chuckle came from his lips as he entered the kitchen door, he thinking about Mable and her equine anguishes happening, she in the past preferring to ignore the cries of mare in estrus, and then she was feeling similar pangs. <br />
<br />
Their house and home was built 60 years back when the telephone held a place of special honor. In Roger&#39;s house there was a small encove built under the stairs leading to it&#39;s second story. Roger opened the tall narrow door which was as much like an oldtime phone booth one might imagine.  The phone was hung on the inside wall and two shelves built below. One was to hold the phone book while the other was as a small writing desk, very quaint!<br />
<br />
 Opening the phone book his fingers raced through the business blue section until he smiled reading there, &quot;Pleasure Island Amusement Park, it showing a local number!&quot;<br />
<br />
 Quickly his fingers danced the phone&#39;s keys as the ringing began inside the Park.  &quot;P.I.A.P. Information Desk!&quot; came a quick verbal response-answer.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Ah yes I&#39;m looking for the party.......&quot; Roger started to say.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Missing Persons, I&#39;ll connect you that extension, 2190!&quot; said the operator as she dialed Roger away from his question.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Missing, yawn..., ah Persons department, state name and date that subject came to the Park.&quot; spoke a rather tired sounding male voice.<br />
<br />
 &quot;No, no, I want to know who might have sold my Son some blue powdered mixture which turns people into Donkeys?&quot; asked Roger.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Huh, do what? Are you pulling my leg buddy? Your talking magic tricks and we have a bunch that do tricks but nobody, I repeat nobody really turns into a Donkey!&quot; says the person as they begin to laugh.<br />
<br />
 Roger felt dumbfounded as he remained resolute, because he had three donkeys who were his wife and two sons standing in the barn. As then the Missing Persons department man offered a suggestion. &quot;Well lets check our register of Magic acts and see if any might fill your bill!&quot; The man said, he chuckling at the absurd idea of people transformed.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Circe&#39;s House, or the Donkey Mill Bar, Madame&#39; Illusia&#39;s theater, any of these three might, or maybe the Pleasure Island Nightclub, it&#39;s a strip club with massage parlor. Well that&#39;s my list for magic acts, although there are several other places about the Park which offer similar fun or perverse zoophile fantasy situations!&quot; said the man.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Do they all boast of changing people into Donkeys?&quot; asked Roger being stunned to the great number of possiblities.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Our Park has many such places to aid customers find their own personal fantasies! The fantasy of being transformed into an animal is quite the rage about, and I&#39;ve heard the stories of those who went plum crazy and really believe they spent several years as different animals inside the Park. I can tell stories about those who believe their loved ones were changed into pigs, goats, or even cattle and sent for a time or eternity to one of our breeding farms. I can&#39;t say but maybe that blue powder you asked about does something to them, but really nobody ever gets changed into an animal, noway!&quot; replies the person.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Well I want to talk to one of those possible fantasy places anyway&quot; requested Roger.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Hold the line and I&#39;ll connect you!&quot; came the quick reply.<br />
<br />
 Clickity click, &quot;Good Morning Circe&#39;s House of Fantasy, who is calling?&quot; asked a pleasent and sweet sounding female voice.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Ah Roger N...nevermind the last name, I was calling to find out if your boss uses a blue powder to exicte your customers into be....believing their changed into animals?&quot; asked Roger holding back what he knew to be true.<br />
<br />
 Laughing, &quot;Excite, why my dear man we do far more than just excite those who enter here!&quot; came the quick reply.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Well is it really true, I mean have you seen some person changed?&quot; asked Roger, he gaining real interest.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Have I seen anybody changed, yes, Me!  I came here looking for a wonderful fantasy and was granted one which for the past, ah, ah, past nine years I&#39;ve enjoyed.&quot; said the young lady as Roger got a little antsey.<br />
<br />
 &quot;What was your... fantasy, if I might ask?&quot; asked Roger being a little hesitent.<br />
<br />
 A giggle, &quot;I saw here a girl made to look like a female Satyr. You know a half goat half human creature filled with lust for sexual pleasures, and willing to lead men to their doom, that&#39;s me, and I like it too!&quot; she said with  a rolling laugh.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Really!&quot; said Roger as his imagination began to get the best of him and he was siting up straighter, feeling his pant-front beginning to tent from a growing erection.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Well you called about a blue powder it is that does the trick, I&#39;ll ask the Misstress and get back to you, or do you wish to hold?&quot; she asked and offered.<br />
<br />
 &quot;I&#39;ll hold on!&quot; said Roger as he shivered inside his private phone booth.<br />
<br />
 A few minutes went by before the phone came alive once again.  &quot;Hello, Roger is it, I&#39;m Misstress Circe the owner and manager here, could I be of some service?&quot; offered the Queer of TF.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Yes I hope so, thank you, I have here three Donkeys which were two days ago being  people. I learned that they all three drank of some mixed blue powder in water becomes, I expect a potion of some sort. Anyway they drank it and began then changing, my elder son stands now being one Andalusian Mammoth donkey stud Jackass. She who was my wife of twenty years became similar a two year old  in season donkey jennet.  As well my youngest son, he  only a teenager became a yearling colt Donkey but is also very ah..., I would say sexually flamboyant!&quot; told Roger of his problems.<br />
<br />
 &quot;I don&#39;t use a blue powder or ever sell my potions out on the street. Instead, I offer men of all races their wildest sexual fantasy and when some have attained the absolute peak ill manners, they become enveloped into a very real non-fantasy transitioning of body form, do get my drift? My close friend Madame&#39; Illusia, as well does magical tricks, just  press &quot;o&quot; and ask for extension # 2322.&quot; explained Circe.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Thanks ever so much I might come and visit you someday!&quot; suggested a nervous Roger.<br />
<br />
 Circe laughed, &quot;Don&#39;t bother to pack a bag, I think someone like you will find our island a good place to stay on a permanent basis,&quot; said Circe.<br />
<br />
 Roger punched the &quot;0&quot; and asked the operator to connect him with extension #2322. &quot;Right, the beast maker Bitch!&quot; came a quick reply as the phone call was forwarded.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Good Morning I hope, Madame&#39; Illusia&#39;s Theater, Stephen speaking!&quot; said a clear but young sounding male voice.<br />
<br />
 Again Roger asked his question about a blue powder and it&#39;s ability to change those drinking it as potion. <br />
<br />
 A short pause, then Stephen asked, &quot;The three Donkeys, two males, one Jenny, correct? Well we do use the blue powder and charge for it too! What is you reason for calling, to buy more powder?&quot; asked Stephen.<br />
<br />
 &quot;No, no thanks, but I have three Donkeys I can&#39;t use, I breed and run Trotting horses on my farm!  I was wondering if you might like to take them, as your powder changed them to Donkeys?&quot; asked Roger feeling now ever so nervous.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Huh, a true heartless father figure, is ready to sell his own family being now Donkeys for dirty money!&quot; grumbled Stephen at Roger.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Sell, no I want to give them back to you for whatever service you deem proper!&quot; replied Roger quickly.<br />
<br />
 &quot;What, you will give them to us for work and a life inside the Park?&quot; asked Stephen.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Yes, yes, yes, I would if you would send here a truck and pick them up, as relieve me of having to look at my wife and two sons being now Donkeys!  My farm business is breeding and the racing of American Trotting horses here, and have not one use for, Donkeys!&quot; said Roger now sounding even more urgent to rid himself of Elroy, Brian, and his wife Mable.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Fine, I&#39;ll send a truck tomorrow and take them off your hands!&quot; replied Stephen. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh one important thing you need to be very sure about, and that the Jenny be not pregnant from either of her Jackass sons. As because if she is pregnant, my Madame will be very upset about being given &quot;USED&quot; merchandise, like dangerously upset!&quot; said Stephen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dangerously upset, would she put the jennet down, like kill or destroy her?&quot; Roger asked Stephen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dangerous to you, like you too becoming an animal and not necessarily a donkey to rejoin your family,&quot; replied Stephen.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will have her checked by my veterinarian, and if she was impregnated what then?&quot; Roger asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to keep her, sell her, or let her run free into the open countryside. You need to know though that the blue power has residual affects, causing her bodily fluids to be infectious. The worse infectious is her vaginal liquid discharges, she my spit-spew out her vulva, the juices can infect a human body simply from touching and quickly soaks into the skin. The betterment of males transformed and having then sex with such a jennet donkey tends to help them retain permanently their realization of self, they know of what they were and to then became and relish living the life of their animal embodiment.&quot; Stephen explained.<br />
<br />
Roger then set silent, he thinking of Elroy and how he seemed elated and happy from becoming his huge donkey stud new self. Roger wondered if Elroy had mated with Mable, and she re-infecting her son, gifted him his retained learned knowledge to help him feel joy from becoming a stud.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, hello, sir your silence tends to make me think you know more than you have said about your wife being a jennet donkey and maybe pregnant.&quot; Stephen remarked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will expect your truck here tomorrow and assure you of two male donkeys, and have the jennet tested, OK?&quot; Roger replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent, on the morrow then,&quot; Stephen replied.</p>
