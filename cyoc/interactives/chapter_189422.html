<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dave leaned against the bathroom sink looking blearily at his reflection. He was just not having a good week. His shirt was rumpled, his tie was skewed, his gray speckled black hair was a messy mop on his head, and his even more greyed stubble was rough on his cheeks and jaw. Even the fine wrinkles besides his eyes and mouth seemed deeper and more pronounced. He wetted his fingers and tried to run them through his hair to give it some semblance of normalcy, but he couldn&#39;t fault himself for looking this way. He had been living out of his car for the last week after his fiancée Cherise kicked him out of their apartment. Worse she froze all their joint cards and Dave simply didn&#39;t have enough in his personal savings account to afford a hotel. She had been the bread winner after all. Dave had been stuck in the same dead end job for fifteen years now.<br />
<br />
At forty, Cherise was probably his last chance to settle down and have a family. But as their relationship went on she began to see him as a drag on her life goals. Ten years younger than him, she still had ambition. Dave didn&#39;t fit her plans anymore. He was still surprised to see the middle aged man he had become in the mirror, his once lean physique given way to softness. He wasn&#39;t fat, but he was hardly the fit young man he had once been. Well, he did have a small gut he had to admit to himself.<br />
<br />
From one of the stalls in the bathroom a toilet flushed and out strode Todd to wash his hands at the sink next to Dave. He fixed Dave with a smile via the mirror. &quot;Hey, Dave, rough day?&quot;<br />
<br />
If someone in the office was his antithesis, it was Todd. Fifteen years his junior and they held relatively the same position. Where Dave was stuck in a rut, Todd was a shooting star, sure to make upper management by the time he was thirty. His blond hair was impeccable, in fact, Todd never looked ungroomed. His jaw and cleft chin where shaved clean, and his button-up shirt fit his torso perfectly, showing off a leanly muscled swimmer&#39;s body. Toss made Dave uncomfortable. It wasn&#39;t that Todd was better than him in every single way, well, not completely. Todd was also completely and unashamedly out of the closet. Not that Dave was homophobic, he thought to himself, he just didn&#39;t think that type of thing was appropriate to discuss in the workplace.  Toss never seemed to pick up on Dave&#39;s dislike of him, or if he did he didn&#39;t let it show. He was unfailingly polite and friendly with everyone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, rough few days.&quot; He found himself confiding in Todd. Normally he would have given a noncommittal answer and excused himself, but something made him want to talk. &quot;Cher kicked me out and I&#39;m still looking for a place to stay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rough.&quot; Todd said sympathetically. Shaking water off his hands before grabbing a couple paper towels to dry them. &quot;I know! I bet you could use a drink. How about it? You and me after work, we&#39;ll hit the bar and get your mind off things.&quot; Todd reached into his pocket and pulled out his phone, tapping something into it.<br />
<br />
Dave opened his mouth to refuse but suddenly his lips seemed to have a mind of their own. &quot;Sure. I&#39;d like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great! I&#39;ll swing by your desk at five.&quot; Todd clapped Dave on the shoulder and left the bathroom, whistling cheerfully.<br />
<br />
What the hell was that? Dave wondered to himself. He had no desire to go out drinking with Todd. What would they even talk about? Women? Todd was probably useless there. Men? Dave was just as bad with that. Maybe it would get his mind off things, and if it got awkward he could just make an excuse and bail. He didn&#39;t even think of trying to get out of the meet up. With a sigh he pushed off the sink and went back to his desk. Two more hours till weekend freedom.<br />
<br />
Dave lost himself in his work for those last few hours. Enough that he lost track of time, until a voice brought his attention back. &quot;Ready?&quot; Todd stood in the opening to Dave&#39;s cubical, grinning. His jacket was on now and that fit him perfectly as well, showing off broad shoulders and a trim waist. He had his phone in his hand.<br />
<br />
Dave pulled his eyes away from Todd to shut off his computer. He found it hard no to stare at the man a little. Any guy could tell you if another guy was good looking or not, at least in some sense, but he had never considered a guy to be attractive. Until his eyes had settled on Todd just those few moments ago. He found it unsettling. &quot;Yeah, just about.&quot; Dave saved a few files and grabbed his suit jacket off the back of his chair, slinging it on. When he looked back at Todd, the younger man stopped tapping on his phone and tucked it away in his pocket, falling into step with Dave.<br />
<br />
They existed in an awkward silence as they took the elevator down and walked a block to the bar. Todd must have been a regular as the bartender greeted him by name and he made his way to a specific table without even looking about. &quot;They have a good beer list here, wine, too, if that&#39;s your thing. Jimmy makes some killed cocktails though.&quot; Todd said with a nod towards the bartender.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you come here often?&quot; Dave asked as he settled in, eyes going to the menu over the bar.<br />
<br />
&quot;A couple times a week. My apartment is actually just upstairs.&quot; Todd shucked free of his jacket and hung it off the back of his chair, Dave followed suit after a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;You live that close to work?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What can I say, I like to walk places if I can. Bar, work, few good restaurants, and a gym all in walking distance. Decide?&quot; Todd hadn&#39;t sat down yet, obviously offering to get the first round. Dave spoke his choice and a few minutes later Todd wandered off to the bar. Dave found himself staring at Todd&#39;s backside as he leaned against the bar. If Dave could find that ass on a woman. It was plump and round and looked perfect for grabbing. Dave felt a stirring in his pants and tore his eyes away. Where had that thought even come from?<br />
<br />
Todd played on his phone while he waited for their drinks, but soon he was back with a beer for Dave and a cocktail for himself. &quot;Old fashioned. I like them. Probably the only old fashioned thing I like.&quot; Todd joked as he set his phone face down on the table.<br />
<br />
Dave felt himself smiling. &quot;Well, I hope I&#39;m not too much of a stick in the mud, then.&quot;<br />
<br />
Todd shook his head. &quot;No, I think you have potential.&quot; He said with a grin, sipping his cocktail as those blue eyes fixed on him. Pale, icy blue, but somehow still warm.<br />
<br />
&quot;No one else seems to think so. Besides, I think it might be to late to do anything about it. Just ride it out for another twenty years until retirement.&quot; Dave picked up his beer for a long, cooling gulp. He swore he could feel the alcohol seeping into him and unwinding his muscles, easing his stress.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you might surprise yourself.&quot; Todd tilted his head, peering at Dave like he knew some secret.<br />
<br />
A couple hours and more than a few drinks later the two were joking and talking like old friends. Moving between humorous stories and more intimate ones. &quot;Yeah, I guess Cher just thought I would be a drag on her career. She wants to be one of the most influential attorneys in the city. Have her kids go to the best private schools. Having an office drone for a husband doesn&#39;t work in that fantasy.&quot; Dave frowned into his mostly empty glass. His fifth? Sixth? Dave tugged at the collar of his shirt, it was rumpled, sure, but it normal fit. It just felt oddly uncomfortable at the moment. Like it was loose and tight in the wrong places.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what do you want?&quot; Despite being at least four cocktails in, Todd seemed sober, maybe a little more free and loose, but certainly not drunk.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought I wanted the whole family thing. A house in the suburbs, two kids, a dog.&quot; Dave&#39;s frown etched deeper. &quot;Or is that what I was expected to want? Truth be told, I don&#39;t think I ever thought about it beyond that. What about you? What do you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me?&quot; Todd asked, sounding surprised. &quot;A husband that cares about me and will grow old with me. Maybe a kid or two later on. Enough money to travel and see the world. And lots of sex.&quot; He added the last one on like an afterthought, laughing.<br />
<br />
Dave laughed, too. Part of him, deep down, was uncomfortable with the talk of sex from Todd, knowing he meant with other men, but he found his eyes lingering on Todd again.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know.&quot; Todd spoke up again, sipping his cocktail. &quot;I have a spare room, it&#39;s not much, just a closet big enough for a bed really, I can&#39;t afford a big place in this city, yet.&quot; The yet sounded like it was a definite eventuality as Todd spoke it. &quot;But big enough for you to crash in for a while. Better than sleeping in a car, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t I be in your way. I mean your young and probably.. dating. You don&#39;t want some old dude hanging around.&quot; Dave found himself wanting to take up the offer, but part of him was resisting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, I don&#39;t usually bring guys home, and it&#39;s only until you can get your feet under you.&quot; Todd drained the rest of his drink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure.&quot; That little bit of resistance gave in and Dave nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great! We&#39;ll grab your things out of your car and then head up.&quot; Todd picked his jacket off the back of his chair and slung it over his arm. Dave tried to put his on, but it felt uncomfortably tight in the shoulders. After a moment he shrugged back out of in and held it like Todd.<br />
<br />
After swinging by Dave&#39;s car in the parking lot under the office, they walked the block back to the bar, but hit a stairwell besides it instead, taking it up a few flights to a hallway. Todd led him to one of the wooden doors and unlocked it, letting them in. The apartment was indeed on the small side, maybe only a third of Dave&#39;s old place, but Cher had made good money. An apartment this size probably took most of Todd&#39;s finances if he made anything like what Dave did. Still it was neat, and well decorated. The furniture matches and pictures of famous landmarks covered the walls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quick tour.&quot; Todd chimed in cheerfully. &quot;Kitchen, living room.&quot; He pointed to both without having to move. Then to three doors one and a time. &quot;My room, bathroom, spare room.&quot; He headed to the third door and opened it. Indeed it was a closet of a bedroom, just big enough for a bed and a dresser, though there was also a curtained window that looked out on the fire escape.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, its better than my car.&quot; Dave smiled and Todd nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Settle in, I&#39;ll heat up a pizza. We need some real food in us.&quot; He walked towards the kitchen and Dave closed the bedroom door behind him. He did take a few moments to just sit on the bed, staring out the window. Maybe he had been wrong about Todd. Or.. no he wasn&#39;t wrong. Todd was just as friendly and outgoing as he always seemed. Dave just felt guilty thinking negatively about him. He took some time to put his clean clothes away and then peeled out of his work clothes. They had become more uncomfortable as the night wore on and he was glad to get out of them. Tossing his undershirt aside he got out some casual clothes. Peering down into the drawer he caught a glimpse of his own torso. Was his gut smaller? He ran a hand over it with a frown, the faint treasure trail that ran up his stomach tickling under his fingers. There was a sparse dusting of black hair along the middle of his chest, too. He had shaved smooth on Cher&#39;s insistence, and sure, some stubble had started growing back since he was kicked out, but this wasn&#39;t just one week&#39;s worth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably still drunk and seeing things.&quot; He muttered to himself as he pulled on his t-shirt. It felt tighter in the shoulders and chest, less son than it usually did around his gut. And when he pulled on his athletic shorts he found he had to pull the drawstring a bit tighter. &quot;Probably just lost weight from the stress, and shrunk my clothes in the laundromat. Maybe Todd has a better laundry room in the building.&quot; He scratched at his jaw then stretched. As he stepped out the smell of baking pizza greeted him.<br />
<br />
Todd had changed, too. He wore a tank top and shorts like Dave&#39;s. Though they fit him much better. He somehow didn&#39;t look slovenly even dressed down like that. The tank top showed off his leanly muscled arms and the tufts of dark hair below his pits. Curious. Dave always pegged Todd as someone who would shave his body. No, a little fur would look good on that lean body of his. Dave pushed that thought out of his head with a frown, but felt his eyes sliding back down to Todd&#39;s ass as he bent over to pull the pizza out of the oven.<br />
<br />
Dave had tried anal once before with one of his exes. He enjoyed it, she hated it. But guys liked that sort of thing, didn&#39;t they? Something about the prostrate? It wouldn&#39;t really be that different, fucking a guy. Not that he&#39;d let a guy fuck him, but if he was on top... Dave tore his eyes away and shoved down hard on that line of thought. He wasn&#39;t.. It was just the stress and not having had a good lay in the last few months as his relationship fell apart. He was just desperate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, sit down and make yourself comfortable. Feel free to find something on TV, I&#39;ll bring out the food.&quot; Todd set the pizza on the stove top and got out a knife for cutting.<br />
<br />
Dave was glad for the distraction, he sat on the couch and grabbed the remote, flipping through until he found football. But something about staring at the men in their uniforms, sweaty and panting made something uncomfortable stir up in him again and he quickly changed channels. He landed on a crime drama, nothing there to get his libido going. A moment later Todd was sitting down next to him and handing him a plate of pizza. They ate in silence, watching the show.<br />
<br />
Dave lost himself in just relaxing. After setting his plate down on the coffee table, pizza eaten he leaned back. He barely noticed when Todd leaned in against him, nor did he register himself reflexively putting an arm around the younger man&#39;s shoulders, or when he rested his cheek on top of that blond hair.<br />
<br />
He did notice as a hand started sliding up his shirt. &quot;What are you..?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shhhhh.&quot; Todd cut off the question, looking up to Dave with a grin. That hands continued to sneak its way up under his shirt, squeezing one side of his chest, then teasingly tugging at his nipple with thumb and forefinger. Dave let out a small gasp of pleasure as he felt something like a static shock flow through him.<br />
<br />
Todd pushed up Dave&#39;s shirt with his arm, then leaned over and took his other nipple between his lips, sucking on one as he teased the other. Dave felt his cock hardening in his short, tenting the flimsy mesh fabric. Something in the back of his mind screamed at him to push Todd off, to get away. Another part of him drowned that panic out with the waves of pleasure he was feeling.<br />
<br />
&quot;You like that?&quot; Todd whispered as he released the one nipple from his lips. Dave just nodded weakly. He looked down. His nipples looked a bit bigger, maybe a little swollen from the sucking and teasing. Except his chest looked a little bigger, too. Flat this morning, maybe a little mounded from weight he had gained, his chest was now two shallow mounds topped by those pert nipples. There should be something odd about that. It should bother him. But it didn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
Todd straightened and pulled off his own tank top, exposing his leanly muscled physique. A line of blond hair ran up the middle of his six pack abs, an almost perfect diamond of trimmed golden fuzz lightly coating the middle of his chest between two firm pecs. Dave had been right, Todd did look good with a little fur on that body.<br />
<br />
Todd slid off the couch to his knees in front of Dave, and pulled down his shorts. Dave&#39;s cock flopped free, harder than he had felt it since his was in his twenties. Stiff as a rock with a glistening drop of pre topping his swollen head. Dave was pretty average in that department, just a little shy of six inches, but it looked bigger as it bobbed in front of Todd&#39;s face. Maybe it was just so hard it was swollen more than usual. The blond man took the cock in his mouth and began to work.<br />
<br />
It was the best blow job Dave had ever had. Todd was like an artist. His tongue found every spot that sent waves of agonizing pleasure through Dave&#39;s body. He sucked Dave right to the edge and let him fade back, again and again he teased Dave to the point of climax and stopped just before he could release himself.  Todd finally took mercy on him and let him cum. He flooded the younger man&#39;s mouth with more spunk than he had produced in years, and Todd swallowed every last drop until Dave&#39;s cock softened slightly in his mouth.<br />
<br />
He slid back up onto the couch and shared a quick kiss with Dave, salty and musky. It was the first time he had tasted his own cum and it didn&#39;t gross him out like the thought of doing so would have even just this morning. &quot;Thanks, I&#39;m going to head to bed. Don&#39;t stay up too late.&quot; Todd slid off he couch and retreated to his room. Dave could only stare after him.<br />
<br />
He sat dazed and naked on the couch for a few long minutes. His cock had softened and now lay against his thigh, still glistening from Todd&#39;s saliva. Though the skin seemed to have pulled over the head a bit, just around the very base. Maybe it was just something from being so spent. Had that really just happened? It had. And he had just let it happen. Something was wrong with him.<br />
<br />
Dave slowly got to his feet. He picked up his discarded clothes but didn&#39;t put them back on. Instead he carried them naked to his new bedroom. He set his clothing aside and fell naked into the bed. He almost never slept naked, and definitely not in a strange bed but it felt right tonight. He drifted off almost as soon as his head hit the pillow.</p>
