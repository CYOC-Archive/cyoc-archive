<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Eric! Eric! I can see your other change. You&#39;ve lost weight. I guess you got Ted&#39;s wish to be slim. You look really skinny&quot; <br />
<br />
Eric groaned again in reply<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the matter darling? You said the changes only last until the next day&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not just my shirt that has been feminised&quot; Eric said very quietly <br />
<br />
&quot;What did you say Eric?&quot; asked Ted, who was still feeling his breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;This stupid game has done it to me again! Why did you have to wish to be feminine Mum?&quot; Eric was sobbing<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? What&#39;s the matter son?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My shirt has changed! ..... My jeans have changed! ..... And I no longer have anything down below..... I&#39;m no longer your son!&quot; Eric managed to finish her sentence between sniffles.<br />
<br />
Maureen at least understood what Eric was saying. She moved across and gave her &#39;daughter&#39; a hug. That prompted Eric&#39;s sobs to turn into full on wailing. Even Ted was now aware that Eric was majorly upset.<br />
<br />
It was a full 5 minutes before Eric got the tears under control. Maureen helped her daughter to the bathroom and for the first time got a view of Eric&#39;s feminine cut jeans and vacant crotch. She also observed that Eric&#39;s slippers had changed style as well. Maureen left Eric there to examine herself and said &quot;Take your time. A cup of tea would be waiting for you when you feel up to it&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric looked at the girl in the mirror. She recognised her mothers face on what looked to be a teenage girls undeveloped body. Her eyes were puffy from all the crying she had done but they were still recognisable as her own. Her arms were also her own but all her muscle definition had gone. Eric had been reasonable fit but it seemed the &quot;slimming&quot; that Ted had wished for had resulted in loss of muscle mass on her arms and torso. At least she didn&#39;t have breasts. She removed the &#39;Top&#39; she had been wearing. It had lace inserts on each shoulder and a lower neckline than the t-shirt it had formerly been wearing. <br />
<br />
Eric was not surprised to see she had enlarged nipples  she had felt them rubbing against her shirt. The coloured area around each nipple was also bigger than she remembered. Her chest was hairless as well, not that the former Eric had been particularly hirsute.<br />
<br />
Curious her eyes now turned to her lower body. She examined the now tight fitting jeans. She had a narrow boyish waist. But the crotch was no longer baggy. It was obvious there was nothing underneath. For the first time she noticed how her footwear had changed, she kicked off the fluffy slippers in disgust. <br />
<br />
She peeled off the jeans to reveal the black underwear she had put on so recently had turned into a pair of black satin panties. These were also removed and Eric examined her newly acquired pussy. No doubt this was a copy of her mothers pussy. She supposed she must be a virgin, that was assuming her mother had been a virgin when she had married Ted. What Eric found was a neatly trimmed thatch of blond pubic hairs. The colour must have come from Ted, Maureen was a brunette. Eric&#39;s legs and feet were recognisable as her own but like her arms had lost muscle definition. She looked like a tall lanky girl, an anorexic girl.<br />
<br />
She was awoken from her thoughts by her mothers voice calling out &quot;Cuppa&#39;s ready Eric. We are going to have our turns&quot; That prompted Eric to start getting dressed again. She had no choice but to put back on the clothes she had just taken off.<br />
<br />
Maureen knew Eric might be a while but she was eager to see if she could get another change for herself. She liked being young but was embarrassed about how fat she now was. She really wanted the &#39;slimming&#39; wish to come her way. Once the tea was made she returned to the table and picked up the dice. Ted was still there fondling his breasts. he didn&#39;t seem overly concerned that his son had just changed into a daughter.<br />
<br />
With an &quot;I&#39;m having my turn&quot; she tossed. Her dice came up with 5 and 6. She watched as her token moved to the second last square. Maureen was happy to see it was black. A card flipped out. She read the usual “Toss again and the number will result in a change requested by default. Do not worry it will fade when tomorrow’s sun casts some shade”<br />
<br />
She tossed once more then immediately looked to see if anything had changed. She was disappointed to see she was still fat. &quot;Can you see anything different about me Ted?&quot; she asked her husband.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. You have Eric&#39;s eyes&quot; Ted replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to see this&quot; said Maureen once more leaving her seat. However the only mirror available was in the bathroom where Eric remained. Maureen knocked on the door. &quot;Eric? Are you dressed? I need your mirror&quot; <br />
<br />
Eric was just putting her top back on.  &quot;You may as well come in&quot;<br />
<br />
Maureen opened the unlocked door. &quot;Feeling better?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really. But I suppose I&#39;ve just got to accept I&#39;ll be like this for the rest of the day&quot; Eric replied. &quot;What change did you get?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ted says I have your eyes&quot; Maureen confirmed this for herself by looking in the mirror. Sure enough she now had blue eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah you do. We are almost twins&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm. I like them. Well are you ready to come out. You can&#39;t hide here all day&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t suppose I have any choice&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on then, you&#39;re cuppa will be getting cold&quot; Maureen took her daughters hand and led her back to the table.<br />
<br />
Ted looked up at the two young women. He couldn&#39;t help himself. &#39;Looks like I now have two daughters; Skinny and Fatty&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not funny Ted. It&#39;s your turn we need to finish this game.<br />
<br />
Eric didn&#39;t say anything but just took her seat.<br />
<br />
Ted knew immediately he had said the wrong thing. He picked up the dice and tossed</p>
