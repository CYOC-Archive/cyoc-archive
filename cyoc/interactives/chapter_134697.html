<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marvin smiled as he drove home. The registration proved to be a lot easier than he thought, the school had glanced over Amanda’s paperwork without an issue before admitting her into the class. By this time next week she would be back in second grade.<br />
<br />
As Marvin pulled onto his street he now mulled over what life would be like with a child in the home. Early wake ups, school events, homework, this was about to become his life once more. At the age of 60 Marvin now worried if him and Deanna would have the energy to raise a young child once more. Before he could determine if he could he felt his heart drop.<br />
<br />
Marvin recognized the black SUV in his driveway, it belonged to TransDem security services. Marvin only knew a little bit about the secret security force at TransDem, mostly rumors. The security team was made up of former military, mercenaries and government agents. Marvin had seen them on sight before but had done his best to stay out of their way. These were the kind of people Marvin suspected killed for a living before taking a comfortable position working for a private companies security. Marvin quickly threw the car into park as he raced towards the front door.<br />
<br />
“Deanna! Amanda!”<br />
<br />
As Marvin frantically glanced around his home he paused, oddly he could here children’s laughter coming from the backyard. While Marvin had hoped Amanda would enjoy herself it sounded as if Deanna had invited several children over to play. “Why would Deanna invite a whole group of kids over,” he thought. “She has to know that things would be too dangerous for Amanda.” Slowly Marvin peered out into the backyard, his jaw dropping as he took in the sight.<br />
<br />
Marvin could see a dark haired boy and a young brunette girl swinging on the ancient swing set in the backyard. The two kids seemed to be wearing nothing except over sized dress shirts that would probably fall to their knees. Confused he continued to scan the backyard first noticing Amanda and then a young blond haired girl playing with her. Narrowing his eyes he now tried to place the face, gasping when he realized who it was.<br />
<br />
“D..Deanna,” he stammered as he stepped into the backyard. Deanna turned, smiling up at her husband before waving. “Hi Marvin,” she chirped. “Is everything all set with Amanda?”<br />
<br />
Marvin slowly approached, looking at the seven year old girl that was his wife when he left that morning. Clearing his throat he now gazed down at the adorable little girl. “Y..Yeah,” he mumbled. “She’s all set. What happened? How...how did you become a child?”<br />
<br />
Deanna giggled as she looked up at Marvin. “Well Amanda wanted a playmate and I figured who better than me.” Marvin stared at the little girl dumbfounded before looking back at the two children on the swing set. “And who are they?”<br />
<br />
“Their from TransDem,” Amanda stated. “They dropped by looking for you and found us. They were going to take us away so I had to use the chronovac.” Marvin stared numbly at the children, rubbing his eyes. “Okay tell me everything.”<br />
<br />
Amanda explained how Michelle and Frank arrived believing Deanna to be Dr. Katherine Morgan, who was one of the scientists that had originally taken the chronovac. The two security agents were going to take Amanda and Deanna back to TransDem before Amanda used the chronovac to transform the two adults into seven year old children physically and mentally. Marvin rubbed his chin thoughtfully before looking the group over. <br />
<br />
“Okay,” he sighed. “We need to get rid of the car first and foremost. Chances are TransDem has it tracked meaning that they’ll realize something is wrong if it stays here. I’ll drive but I’m going to need someone to follow in my car. That means you’re going to have to grow back up Deanna, playtimes over.”<br />
<br />
“Do I have too,” Deanna whined, causing Marvin to give her a disapproving look. “Ugh fine,” she sighed. Taking the chronovac from Amanda she inputed the directions into the device before pointing it a text herself.<br />
<br />
7...8...9<br />
<br />
Deanna quickly began to grow back up her height increasing while her face began to mature, leaving young childhood behind. As she grew she noticed her dress beginning to become tighter on her body. “Oops,” she blushed. “I better go change before I tear this dress. “ Amanda giggled as she saw the 9 year old Deanna bond into the house, her sundress slowly rising on her growing body. In a few moments 12 year old Deanna returned, wearing the no where I’ll fitting outfit from this morning.<br />
<br />
12...13...14..<br />
<br />
Deanna frowned as she began to grow back up. While her clothing was still loose on her waifish body she could see they were becoming a bit more comfortable as she grew older. Glancing at her body, she could see her small breasts slowly beginning to fill up her loose bra while her legs continued to lengthen, causing the hems to slowly uncool from around her feet. Marvin watched as the girls face began to become more mature in appearance as the small amount of freckles slowly vanished from her cheeks, while her hair grew out, cascading to the middle of her back.<br />
<br />
15...16...17..<br />
<br />
Deanna smiled as the progression stopped. The blond teen smiled at her husband as she smoothed her loose clothing out. While Deanna returned to her original height, she was much skinnier than her elderly self with a firm body and curves that were just beginning to appear. “Hope this is old enough,” she smirked. “I wasn’t ready ready to grow  all the way yet.”<br />
<br />
Marvin frowned as he looked at the teenage beauty in front of him. Deanna resembled the high school girl he had first met so many years ago. For Marvin at the time it had been love at first sight. Deanna was a knockout with a firm young body a beautiful face dotted with almost imperceptible freckles and shimmering dirty blond hair. Now though, considering the perceived age difference, Marvin couldn’t help but feel he was looking at someone who could be his grandchild. “Well as long as you can drive Deanna,” he said with a smirk. “I still don’t know what came over you to want to become a teeny bopper but I guess I can roll with it for now.”<br />
<br />
Deanna giggled, placing a small peck on Marvin’s cheek before grabbing the keys. Marvin now turned to Amanda, who had a sad look on her face. “You okay Amanda?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Amanda said sadly. “It’s just...I  was having a lot up with Deanna.”<br />
<br />
Marvin sighed as he looked down at the girl. “I suppose I can let you two finish your play date after we finish,” he said. “Let’s get rid of the car and figure out what to do with those two first Okay?”<br />
<br />
Amanda nodded as she now called for Michelle and Frank to join her. As the group piled into the two cars Marvin could only shake his head. Something told him these kind of events were about to become a regular part of his life.</p>
