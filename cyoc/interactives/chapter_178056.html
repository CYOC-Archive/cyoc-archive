<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ok, ok, calm down… m- maybe you just… went through the wrong entrance or something. You’re COMPLETELY sure that you didn’t, but maybe you… did?<br />
<br />
… Oh who are you kidding. You have no good explanation for this.<br />
<br />
First things first, you need to find someone else who might know where the hell you are. Trying to swallow your nervousness, you cautiously start to walk off in a random direction. There’s no particular reason why, there’s just… something in your gut that makes you feel like this is the right direction. However, even though you feel like you’re making progress, you’re basically completely lost in the trees. You don’t even know how to get back to the shop. Nevertheless, you continue to walk, only pausing briefly at the sight of what looks like some sort of structure next to a stone walkway.<br />
<br />
Approaching the path, you are only more bewildered by what you’re seeing. A large Japanese shrine gate adorns a pathway patterned by falling pink cherry blossom leaves from the trees adjacent to the walkway. What the hell? You’re not in Japan… even though that machine… did that machine do all of this? How is that even possible? You know that you should probably try to retrace your steps and get that machine to work again but… no, something is still telling you that you need to continue onwards. It’s like some sort of invisible force is tugging at your mind, pulling you along as you stumble your way through the gate. As you do, you could almost swear that the atmosphere seems… different somehow. Like you’re in a world not meant for you. Yet you still continue forwards, eventually reaching a small divergence in the path. A dirt walkway leading to a small cave.<br />
<br />
You need to go into the cave, you think. You don’t know why, but you’re certain that your goal is in there somewhere. Your mind feels a bit hazy, you can’t even remember what exactly it was that you were looking for in the first place, but you’re confident that it’s in there. Perhaps you’ll know it when you see it.<br />
<br />
You travel down into the darkness, a chill washing over you as the light behind you slowly starts to fade the further you go. This is wrong, you know that, you don’t know where you’re going. You can’t see anything. ...But no, this is the right direction. You know where you’re going, you know every turn to take. Two halves of your brain feel as if they’re fighting for dominance as your whole being is overcome by the uncomfortable feeling of coldness. You want to be warm. You want to be warmed up so bad. You need to get to where you’re going fast… is there warmth there? You don’t know. You do know. It doesn’t matter. Your brain feels as if it’s asleep, you’re barely able to hold a thought as you mindlessly keep wandering through the darkness for what feels like hours until you finally spot it. A speck of light. That’s it. This is what you were looking for. You don’t know why, but you’re sure of it. Your mind clearing a bit, you stagger towards the flickering light bouncing off of the walls. You turn the final corner, and you find it. You’ve found what you had to look for.<br />
<br />
As if by magic, you feel yourself snapping out of your trance. You can’t believe what you’re seeing. The chamber is circular and rather small compared to you, with many more openings into the darkness adorning the walls around. The light appears to be from the lanterns adorning the walls, illuminating the strange patterns on the floor and… the strangest thing you’ve ever seen in your life.<br />
<br />
It’s… a tanuki? It’s a bit hard to tell, honestly. It looks similar to the anthropomorphic figure you saw in that picture, with a short stature and stubby legs. It looks… almost cartoonish. Even more so than the picture somehow. However, the main reason why this… thing concerns you is the fact that it looks like it isn’t finished yet. It’s hard to summarize with just a word, but it looks like some sort of unfinished science experiment. The body floats in front of you, the limbs splayed out as it shifts before your eyes. It looks like it’s still growing, with one arm being slightly shorter than the other but gradually catching up to the other’s size. Parts of the fur seem shorter than the rest or are even missing entirely. The tail doesn’t even seem to be finished yet, a fleshy bony stub that is slowly beginning to grow longer. Perhaps most notably, though, is the lack of a ballsack beneath the body’s ever-lengthening cock.<br />
<br />
What… IS this? Was that machine some kind of weird… magic… grow-your-own-creature thingy? Is this thing forming from nothing? What the hell is it gonna do when it’s done? Will it wake up? Will it attack you? Why are the balls missing if that was apparently integral to… whatever the hell you did? You have so many questions and you’re not sure you want the answers to any of them. You feel the urge to run away, to find your way back out of this cave… but your body seems to be moving on its own. You don’t know why you’re walking closer to this thing. You’re afraid of what it could do to you, and yet your body refuses to listen. You try to pull yourself away from it, the tail now finally sprouting fur, doing your best not to move. Parts of your shirt and pants continue to be moved forwards, as if you’re being tugged by an unseen force. Could it be that the Tanuki itself is doing this? Panicking, you pull back even harder against the force of your clothes. A bit of a mistake on your part. You succeed in resisting the pull, but only due to the entire front ends of your clothes being entirely ripped off. You let out a yell and move to cover yourself, not expecting that at all, but it’s to no avail as you feel your hands get yanked closer to the Tanuki, almost completely formed. You struggle against the form one last time, before you suddenly feel a shove from behind, and land on your knees directly in front of the floating body. It slowly lowers to the ground, the force suddenly appearing to disappear. You’re terrified, as far as you can tell the Tanuki has finished forming. At least, you think. The ballsack still isn’t there, and the spot where it should be is still completely devoid of fur, as you can very plainly see considering the creature’s crotch is right in front of you.<br />
<br />
Your breath slows as nothing happens. The creature never opens its eyes, and as far as you can tell isn’t even alive. You don’t know what to anticipate, you’re completely naked, the balls aren’t there, this thing could come alive and eat you at any time, you don’t know where you are, the balls aren’t there, you’re having a hard time keeping your thoughts straight again, and… god, it REALLY bothers you that this thing doesn’t have testicles for some reason. You can’t tear your eyes away from its cock.<br />
<br />
This thing… needs to have balls. It NEEDS to have balls. A Tanuki needs balls. Your mind can’t focus on anything else. You can’t stop thinking about it. It’s distressing. It… it needs them! It needs them! Where are they?<br />
<br />
Y- You… you need to… find them…<br />
<br />
You can’t even process your own movements anymore. You lean in towards the Tanuki’s crotch. The base of its cock getting closer and closer. It’s… the most beautiful thing you’ve ever seen in your life… y- you need to… Mmmhh…<br />
<br />
…<br />
<br />
… You blink. You feel like you just blacked out for a second there. Almost immediately your mind clears once more as you become acutely aware that this has happened more than once now. Perhaps more prudent, though, is that you appear to be suckling on the base of this monster’s cock. Not even the penis itself, just the very base of it.</p>
