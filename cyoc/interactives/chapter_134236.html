<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Summer brought many good things to Animalia and those that had been willing to business with it. Particularly as the global tourist season picked up. However, there were plenty of issues that couldn&#39;t just be &quot;vacationed away,&quot; and for Animalia, that particularly related to what was being called &quot;Regressive Hypersexuality.&quot; It wasn&#39;t something that was fatal or physically unhealthy for the Animalian with the condition, but was something that had the potential to be troublesome, given that Animalians naturally had a rather high libido and even some of the smaller Animalians were physically strong enough that the only Human that could potentially overpower them in a physical contest would be an Olympic level athlete. <br />
<br />
Even with vaccinations against the infectiousness of the Animalia Virus, it was something that many people weren&#39;t always comfortable with. The condition raised the prospect of &quot;rape&quot; as an issue that would need to be confronted and one that created its own issues. Particularly in that those Animalians that tended to suffer from Regressive Hypersexuality were those who had been older and often had had some kind of trauma in there past. Congress was presently debating massive restrictions on the sale of the Animalia Virus, in which only someone between the ages of 20 and 39 could legally buy it and that was assuming they had had no diagnoses of any mental or medical trauma as a means of preventing further cases of Regressive Hypersexuality. The debate also included all loopholes with regard to minors converting under the claim that the hormone issues related to puberty were also a cause, even though none of the cases of Regressive Hypersexuality and made it clear that Project Phoenix also would no longer be allowed for minors.<br />
<br />
Horizon had representatives called before House hearings and committees to explain the problem, and it soon became clear that the bill was more political than anything that was in relation either health or safety. As every piece of scientific evidence that Horizon presented was flat ignored.  The bill was expected to pass the House in matter of days and the Senate by the end of the year, and the President had stated on Twitter that the bill was &quot;already signed. No more Animalians!!&quot; It represented a clear attack on Horizon, Animalia, and many of its projects, with its only real hope was that the Senate would end up being deadlocked on the issue as so many other anti-Animalia bills had before.<br />
<br />
And that whole debate was on Doctor Jones&#39;s mind as he sat with some of his latest clients with the condition. He had sent some notes to the House&#39;s hearings, but with confidentiality issues and the fact that the investigation wasn&#39;t into any actual criminal action that was reported, they didn&#39;t sway the House much, if at all. The Senate might be different, especially as the cases he&#39;d had so far had shown that while those suffering from Regressive Hypersexuality seemed to be even more open and flirtatious than other Animalians, he hadn&#39;t noted any cases where it would translate into aggression. It let him hold some group sessions, which at times he felt would help.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m still not sure why I have to be here,&quot; Julius commented with a small frown on his muzzle as he sat there with Blanca and Candida sitting beside him, though he did smile to the two white lionesses.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s mostly as a precaution,&quot; Doctor Jones spoke, &quot;particularly as some things that were told to Horizon with regards to your past behavior and reasons for your choice of Animalian to become gave those at Horizon the concern that with your age prior to conversion and past... that it was entirely possible. And with things as they are... neither Horizon nor Animalia wants to have an issue with regard to the law, and one that Regressive Hypersexuality threatens to force major changes and restrictions to. They want it so that if that condition does develop... that you&#39;re able to get it addressed and come to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can a psychiatrist cure some disease?&quot; Blanca asked raising an eyebrow to Doctor Jones.<br />
<br />
&quot;Regressive Hypersexuality is more of a atypical disease in that various mental factors and stresses are far more often the cause than anything genetic,&quot; Doctor Jones answered, &quot;and that when an older human who&#39;s had those stresses in the past is converted... the libido boost that comes along with the conversion seems to be escalated by those mental stresses. It&#39;s something that some of Horizon&#39;s scientists are actually curious on with regard to how the Animalia Virus effects the mind... which has been there since the beginning, since Animalia&#39;s start included the creation of its edicts as a moral code that in pure theory no mundane animal should be able to just create on their own. It would be like taking a newborn human child and raising it in conditions where it is given no access to anything beyond food and safety and expecting that child to then produce a work of philosophy that somehow explains the meaning of life in a way that no philosopher ever has... Though... Regressive Hypersexuality is more of a potential negative than a positive... but you get my point, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Blanca and Candida slowly nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thus we have these sessions to help you talk it out and keep things under control,&quot; Doctor Jones spoke, &quot;So that way no one is made to feel uncomfortable. And some people can feel that way with someone who straight up invites them to a sexual encounter out of the blue...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Though many of the people that go to the Meat Market...&quot; a male wolf Animalian said slowly, &quot;they aren&#39;t exactly on any moral high ground as it were...&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Jones nodded as he turned to the wolf Animalian who had spoken, &quot;That is true. But one must remember that the Meat Market is NOT a brothel and that prostitution is illegal. In that you need to remember that... and at the same time... just because someone goes to a strip club, that does not mean they actually want that open attention... As for some it may be a bit of guilty pleasure on their part and they don&#39;t want it to be something that draws attention to them. As people, despite claims to the contrary, DO judge others for ANY reason.&quot;<br />
<br />
The wolf Animalian sighed and nodded heavily before looking down. There was a small whimper that Doctor Jones heard, which gave him some indication of success in that he was helping the male wolf Animalian recognize the issues that directly related to his case and the issues that had raised the points of concern. The trauma of being hunted and pursued in the past would be something that would likely also need to be addressed, but that was part of a step at a time process.<br />
<br />
&quot;And in the end, helping control the urges you feel will help when you find a mate,&quot; Doctor Jones commented, &quot;even if she is also an Animalian, there will always be concern and communication issues. You can&#39;t expect to have a happy marriage on sex alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
The wolf Animalian again nodded and looked down. Doctor Jones privately guessed that a lot of his stresses related to being hunted and pursued and that as a Gray Wolf Animalian, he was able to play the role of &quot;hunter,&quot; though as had been typical of the Regressive Hypersexuality cases, what he was hunting was often something that everyone wanted and desired and that the condition was really only affecting how he went about it. As he turned back to Julius, he found the new Lion Animalian sitting quietly with a semi puzzled look. He had his arms around Blanca and Candida&#39;s shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can understand you wanting to make sure people who are more active than others control themselves,&quot; Julius spoke carefully, as he didn&#39;t want to offend the others there, &quot;but still... I haven&#39;t had that... urge... at least not beyond Blanca and Candida.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Doctor Jones asked carefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Julius answered, &quot;the pride is generally pretty comfortable with us being a threesome with regard to the whole &quot;friends with benefits&quot; thing... but when it comes to who my mate would be... I would need to choose ONE to commit to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is pretty normal for Animalians,&quot; Doctor Jones commented, &quot;and works with their edicts... Are you having any trouble with that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In principle, no,&quot; Julius gave a confident smile and then sighed, &quot;with other things yes... both Blanca and Candida are beautiful... and I&#39;ll admit I kinda expected them to sound more like the women in the Black Panther movie rather than having a Latin accent... but then, they were with that drug lord for a long time... so it would make sense.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Jones watched as Julius looked to both lionesses with a weak smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m sorry I entered into anything with bad assumptions,&quot; Julius said to both Blanca and Candida, &quot;as both of you have so many amazing qualities. Blanca... you&#39;re so spunky and brave. Ready to stand up for yourself and for those around you... It sounds more like what the nature books say is more the male Lion&#39;s role... but... I can&#39;t help be attracted to that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Blanca smiled back to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Candida,&quot; Julius continued, &quot;you&#39;re so kind and sweat... gentle and soft... Compassionate and caring. It&#39;s also a wonderful personality I can&#39;t get enough of. You&#39;re both such wonderful people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Candida and Blanca smiled back.<br />
<br />
Doctor Jones could only sit quietly for the moment as he listened to the exchange. While Julius&#39;s attention to the two physically gave some indication that he might develop into Regressive Hypersexuality, but by the same token, by what he just reported, he might be more of a candidate for some of his more standard couples counseling and with regard to making the choice in who to be with more than anything else. It was something Doctor Jones wished he could share more of, particularly with regards to the lunatics in Congress that seemed to respond more online trolls like &quot;ih8Ulibs&quot; than actual evidence... but confidentiality was confidentiality, and his patients wouldn&#39;t want their private concerns flashed across the news like dirty laundry.</p>
