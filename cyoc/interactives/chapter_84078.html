<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Okay, my Venus.&quot; Jeff stood gently, picking up his plant friend and placing her on the ground gently.<br />
<br />
Venus stood up on her roots, curling them and pushing herself off the soft carpet with ease, and bent her head on his direction. Standing like this, she was a little over four feet tall, though he wondered how you measured the height of an inhuman living plant creature.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why you not zap?&quot; Venus folded her arms in front of her in a hilarious approximation of impatience.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just looking you over.&quot; Jeff grinned. Her roots were amazingly strong, segmented much like worms though made of plant matter. Attached to her roots, that round bulb like circle had several details he hadn&#39;t noticed before. Including a very obvious opening situated right in front of her &#39;bulb&#39; trimmed with a thick vein of sorts. She seemed to follow his gaze downward and he caught himself and snapped his head up. Was that? Could it be? His mind was blown. How was that even... possible?<br />
<br />
&quot;See?&quot; Venus smiled with almost pride. &quot;Me girl. Now you tell.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How the hell can you see me, anyway?&quot; Jeff waved his hand in front of her and watched as she followed it perfectly. &quot;You don&#39;t have eyes!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me no need some eyes to see!&quot; She said with a slightly sarcastic tone. &quot;Me see different than master. See you heat. And sense shape.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhh!&quot; Jeff nodded. &quot;I guess that makes sense. So... you ready for more?&quot; He raised the emitter and aimed it expectantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me ready.&quot; Venus said sweetly.<br />
<br />
Again, Jeff zapped the former Venus fly trap, and again she began to grow rapidly. Far from just increasing in size, she was getting thicker and stronger by the second. Her roots seemed to lengthen and thicken immensely, becoming even more flexible and powerful, and the bulb of her &#39;base&#39; grew much larger. Her main stalk raised her head close to the ceiling as it thickened past the size of a human arm, and her long leafy arms grew much thicker, while the leafs of her four hands thickened powerfully and began to resemble the fans of a fern. Venus trembled all the while, her expression turned to pleasured shock, and Jeff could see her skin turning dark and veiny like the texture of a jungle vine. Still, she grew and grew, until she had to &#39;sit down&#39; on her base and let her tentacle-like roots relax around her, though they gripped onto things at their edges. All at once, she threw her head back and curled her stalk into an S again. He heard her moaning, now loudly, and was frightened somebody would come to investigate.<br />
<br />
He could see her &#39;pulse&#39; beating rapidly, her whole body seemingly throbbing, and almost reflexively he stared down to see that strange opening had swollen. The implications were both horrifying and kind of sexy at the same time. He new plant friend was *really* enjoying her change.<br />
<br />
&quot;Master...&quot; Venus said suddenly, catching Jeff off guard. She was now huge and powerful, nearly filling his bedroom with the length of her roots alone, and she had seemed to have developed much more than he had expected. Her voice was as clearly feminine as anything he could imagine, and had with it a slightly seductive edge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...&quot; Jeff stared in shock. Green liquid began to drip from her opening, further confirming what was going on with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Master...&quot; Venus repeated. &quot;I see you looking.&quot; She was now fully intelligent. That much was obvious, as her strange broken speech had resolved itself.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-Sorry...&quot; Jeff stared away in embarrassment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t mind.&quot; Venus leaned in closer, two of her arms touching her master&#39;s shoulders. The other two wrapping around his back. Her leaves were now as big most of his back, and she seemed to have incredible control over each strand of their strange fernlike structure as she massaged his back gently. Now her face was right in front of his, her toothy head equal in size to her own. He wondered if she could eat him up and gulped. She wouldn&#39;t do that, would she? If she was... horny. Was she hungry too? All that growth had to do something...<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...&quot; Jeff stammered, her rubbery lips so close to his. &quot;Venus... this is kind of weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know.&quot; She said with a smile. &quot;But you like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
He gulped, breaking into a sweat as he realized he was a little turned on himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;My pheromones aren&#39;t helping things, though.&quot; She chuckled gently. &quot;You are very susceptible to them, it seems, my handsome Master.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you&#39;re... making me like this?&quot; Jeff blinked in horror. &quot;Can you... can you stop?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you&#39;d like.&quot; Venus said with an even more sarcastic grin. &quot;I can... compose myself.&quot; Her face leaned in closer so that her lips were practically touching his. Her weird plant beak.<br />
<br />
Jeff said nothing, felt his resolve weakening as her big leafy hands closed around him tenderly and she pulled him closer to her in a warm embrace.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your breath feels very nice.&quot; She said gently. &quot;It tickles my skin.&quot; And then she pressed her lips to his, mimicking the gentle kisses he had given her earlier when she had been much, much smaller in size and power.<br />
<br />
When the giant plant broke away from him, Jeff was blushing deep red and felt a mixture of revulsion and arousal coursing through his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;You swell for me!&quot; Venus said excitedly, almost in shock.<br />
<br />
Jeff winced, touched his groin, and found that yes, he had sprouted a hard on under his pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Master...&quot; Venus finally said, releasing him from her gentle grasp of ferns. &quot;If you would like to stop, I can control myself. But... aren&#39;t you a little curious?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My parents are downstairs.&quot; He said suddenly, still blushing deep red.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can be quiet.&quot; Venus insisted, grinning maddeningly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-You&#39;re... not human.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Species is irrelevant.&quot; Venus insisted, now leaning in closer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I get you pregnant?&quot; He blinked.<br />
<br />
The plant drew full back as if offended with a rustling of her ferns and crossed them again, tapping one of her roots. &quot;Now that&#39;s just silly.&quot; She said.<br />
<br />
The moment passed with both of them breaking into muffled laughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhh... that killed the mood.&quot; Venus said with a final chuckle, and realized that with her loss of arousal she was no longer generating the human-seducing pheromones. Jeff must have realized too, because his own inexplicable horniness had quickly faded away.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was...&quot; Jeff considered, and blushed deeply.<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t like it, did you?&quot; The giant plant asked, snaking her roots close to her and soaking up her own apparent arousal fluids.<br />
<br />
Jeff watched what she was doing with curiosity and observed her slit close itself tight and lose its puffiness from before. &quot;Well... I wouldn&#39;t say that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no?&quot; Venus grinned. &quot;Well... think of the possibilities!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... okay.&quot; Jeff sat down on the edge of the bed and smiled as the plant lady pulled herself close to him, resting her closest set of fern hands next to him so they touched. &quot;What now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... we&#39;ll figure that out.&quot; She said. &quot;I could use some watering...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It won&#39;t make you horny, will it?&quot; Jeff asked in sudden alarm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nooo... it&#39;ll take more than that.&quot; She giggled. &quot;But, I&#39;m thirsty.&quot;</p>
