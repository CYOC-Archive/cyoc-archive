<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Everything following is thought out/written by myself; just two chapters later there will be a chapter again, partly taken from another one’s story [of cause marked as always] ;)</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;-When I say ‘transform’ you will change me into a special kind of shapeshifter called… Rose Nymphs. This way I will be able to turn into every human or animal I wish to be and also make any adjustments to my form if I want to. I will also be able to dress myself through my new powers with any pieces of clothes, accessories or make-up I want. And last… hmm…yes… I will have an additional ability. From now on whenever I touch someone or someone touches me and I say ‘obey’ they will be immediately mesmerized by me and fall into a trance like state. In this state I, and only I, can give them new memories or alter them, change their opinion about whatever or even instruct them new ways of behavior. When I snap my finger they will wake up aware again while consciously not remembering anything that happen a few seconds before they became mesmerized.- Yes, I think that should be it. Now, let’s do it. Transform.”<br />
<br />
Kyle already feared that he had to repeat everything his ex-girlfriend just said. It wouldn’t have been a real problem since the curse would easily repeat everything for him without a mistake, but all the necessary movement of his mouth would feel quite disconcertingly. Fortunately it seemed to be rather short and easy. “Jennifer, I want you to transform into a Rose Nymph with all of their powers.”<br />
<br />
A crazy itch ran through Jennifer’s entire body, but somehow it also felt very pleasant. When she opened her eyes again she thought of giving her new powers a little try. Looking at her hand she imagined to already wear her little rose-gold colored watch. In a blink of the eye it had shifted from her bare arm wrist skin into the watch. The watch was fully functional and showed the accurate time ‘7:50am’ “Wow that is amazing.”<br />
<br />
Nearly forgetting that Kyle was still on the phone she still held at her ear she spoke to him again.<br />
<br />
“Okay Kyle, see you in school. And if I were you I’d better show up. Because you want to be a good boy, don’t you?” she asked teasing and just added “Oh and I hope someone can drive you to school, because your bus must have past about five or ten minutes ago. Byeee.” With that she hung up.<br />
<br />
Happily Jennifer walked into the bathroom, of course she would come late as well but that didn’t bothered her too much regarding her new powers to make people, let’s say, a bit more ‘understanding’ towards her. Shapeshifter yes or no, she decided that a shower now would be just perfect to make an even better morning of an exciting day to come… especially for Kyle. Jennifer laughed and undressed herself going into the shower.<br />
<br />
***<br />
Kyle, a few blocks away hurried into the kitchen were fortunately his dad was still sitting, enjoying a little breakfast before going to work. “Kyle? Why are you still here? Don’t you have school at 8am as always?”<br />
<br />
Kyle was still a bit jumbled from the call, - okay, a lot jumbled but finally managed to answer “Yes, right. Unfortunately I missed the bus and tried to…ehm… yes, call Nigel whether they could drive along our street when his mom drives him to school and pick me up too. But I couldn’t reach him anymore. Could you like, please drive me to school?” he said more nervously than planned.<br />
<br />
His dad looked at him quite condemning but after a short look at his arm watch he nodded and stood up. “Seems my coffee once again becomes a coffee-to-go, but this time not due to my fault.”<br />
<br />
Kyle just nodded silently, feeling a bit awkward. But Kyle knew that this wouldn’t be even close to the most awkward things that probably would be happening today.<br />
***<br />
<br />
Back at the house of the Smith’s.- Jennifer had just come out of the shower. Unfortunately she had forgotten to place her new clothes in the bathroom to immediately put them on. She didn’t wanted to  run naked around the house, even as just her older sister was still at home, presumably still asleep since university just was going to start again in a few weeks’ time.<br />
<br />
Jennifer already had put on her panties and the pants of the pajama again when she remembered that she now had shapeshifting abilities. She hit her forehead lightly with her palm and stood before the mirror, thinking of a nice outfit that she wants to wear today. ‘Why not being a bit more of a eyeturner than usual?’ she thought as one or two seconds later her naked upper half was covered in a nice white bare midriff top with a generous V-cut and some delicate lace frills at the rims of the thin fabric. Her legs should now be (at least partly) covered by some denim hot pants but were still dressed in her pajama pants. When she walked a few steps something felt not quite right. A lift of the elastic band away from her body showed that underneath the pajama she wore the hot pants plus two layers of panties.<br />
<br />
“Looks like my own created clothes doesn’t overwrite my already worn one.” she said out loud a bit wondering. Quickly she got out of her ‘original’ clothes. The thought that she would run around naked in school if not her powers would exist made her feel a bit strange, but seemed to be the best way to really take the full advantage of her new shapeshifting powers at any time.<br />
<br />
Again looking into the mirror (now with her planned, hot outfit in place) she applied her make up via her thoughts- and it looked amazing. Exactly as she had in mind. It wasn’t discreet, but her outfit wasn’t as well, she thought. Her feet adorned with a pair of nice white 3 inch heeled sandals she left the bathroom and went down the stairs. She would buy food in school, so she just took her backpack and her stylish white purse, walking outside into the perfectly temperate sunlight.<br />
<br />
Just after a few steps on the street she realized that it made no sense to walk to the near bus stop, her bus was away nearly 20 minutes ago and was a school bus. So there wouldn’t come another one for the next hours. Shortly she felt a bit stranded, that was before from far there was a car to be heard. As loud as it was it had to be a roadster, and it was - a Mezertes OMG GT S to be exactly, with the fitting smug business man in his middle thirties at the wheel (must be the standard equipment), of course in a white shirt.<br />
<br />
Jennifer couldn’t help but grin as she stood in the middle of the road, on purpose not moving a step from the spot. So the car had to slow down entirely to a stop, and the man inside, of course in a hurry, honking a few times aggressively. Slowly Jennifer strut to the driver’s door; since the car roof was open she had no problem with eyeing the driver intensely all the time while coming nearer.<br />
<br />
While first looking silent and confused at her he found his voice back when Jennifer was right next to him and smiling. He lifted his finger pointing at her and wanting to semi-yell at her, however that was before Jennifer touched his handback and playfully spoke “Obey” what caused the drivers expression to freeze and his eyes to stare straight.<br />
<br />
‘Awesome’ Jennifer thought before confidently giving this man his new instructions.<br />
<br />
“When I snap my fingers the next time you will awake and think that I am a rich celebrity girl and you are my personal chauffeur; of course all the time being most politely towards me and doing everything to make the ride more pleasant for me.” *Snap*<br />
<br />
After a short blink and an even shorter look at his bosses face he sprung immediately up from his seat, opening his door, running around the car (of course along the rear) and opening the door for his beautiful young boss.<br />
<br />
Jennifer, not in a hurry at all, went around the front of the car and walked pass her humble chauffeur, who bowed lightly down when she entered the car. Then carefully closing the door and (again around the car’s rear) hurrying to the driver’s door the man two seconds later started the car. “Where shall I drive you to, Miss?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, my name is Jennifer, and you can drive me… you know what- before you drive to the East Hampton High you can take a short side trip to the highway to show me what this baby is made of.”<br />
<br />
“Of course Miss Jennifer, as you wish.”<br />
<br />
Jennifer smiled as the car started with a loud mutter and accelerated in a few seconds to the streets speed limit. With the wink of her eye a pair of stylish dark brown-black sunglasses appeared on her nose and made her comfortable turning her eyes up and whispering<br />
“Oh gosh, that is amazing.” Then turning on some radio pop music as loud as she wanted, her compliant chauffeur not minding it at all.</p>
