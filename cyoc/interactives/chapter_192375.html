<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It turned out Michael had parked his car virtually opposite the bar and Lily and Edward were waiting for their ride at the door. To continue the charade they had carried out all evening, Kerry slipped into the backseat alongside Tom and Kate sat in the front passenger seat. <br />
<br />
After her evening dancing with Michael, Kate was only too happy to get in the front seat alongside her hunky brother-in-law. She had really enjoyed her evening. Dancing with Tom had never given her such pleasure. Maybe she and Tom should also get dancing lessons? It had been such a pleasure to be led so well.<br />
<br />
Tom in the back seat was still stewing over missing out on the corporate box invitation. Michael the lucky sod, was going to enjoy the footy while he was stuck at another work function of Kate’s. Kerry beside him picked up on his deteriorating mood. “What’s the matter Tom?” she whispered quietly to him. <br />
<br />
Tom had temporarily forgotten that the woman had switched bodies. He had been dancing with ‘Kate’ all night pretending they were married. “I’ll tell you when we get home” he quietly replied.<br />
<br />
It was a shock to both gents when upon pulling into the driveway of Tom and Kate’s house. Both ladies jumped out. ‘Kerry’ gave her sister-in-law a hug then said “I’ll come around at about 10 tomorrow morning with the socks”  With that Tom watched his apparent wife get back into the car alongside his brother and drive off, while his sister-in-law took his hand and led him inside. <br />
<br />
Hormones took over rapidly once the front door was closed. The thought in the back of Tom’s mind that he was somehow cheating on Kate disappeared from his mind when the Kerry body pressed against him and began undoing his trousers. Kate was immediately back to where she had been hours earlier. She wanted sex and she wanted it now. She wasn’t going to let Tom know that she was kissing with her eyes closed so she could imagine it was Michael with her.<br />
<br />
Soon they were both naked but for ‘Kerry’s’ heels and Tom carried his very willing partner into the bedroom. He tried to prolong her pleasure but the second she appeared to be getting excited he exploded into her pussy. It was all just too overwhelming. His disappointment about the missed opportunity to experience a corporate box was forgotten.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile the sexual tension between Michael and Kerry was rapidly building up on the 20 minute drive back to their own house. Kerry had reached across and using Kate’s hands had unzipped Michael’s fly and released his monster. She gently massaged him on the trip home careful not to get him overexcited. She couldn’t wait to get his penis into her very moist borrowed pussy.<br />
<br />
To try and distract himself. Michael told Kerry about the invitation to attend the footy next weekend. “Actually I’m not giving you a choice we are going” <br />
<br />
Kerry replied “Oh but I was so hoping to go dancing again. I found tonight exhilarating. The sexual tension has been eye opening” <br />
<br />
“You were dancing with Tom, not me”<br />
<br />
“But I’ll soon be fucking you. Not Tom” She didn’t want to tell him that she was imagining it was Tom’s penis she was stroking.<br />
<br />
As soon as they got home they set to undressing each other. Michael enjoyed a good look at Kate’s body before ramming his penis into her. He had always found Kate attractive. And she was so tight. It was hard to believe that this was Kerry.<br />
<br />
Kerry found the fucking to be very satisfying even if a little painful. She guessed Kate had never accommodated such a large penis before. She had thought she was dripping wet but when Michael thrust into her it felt like she was being skewered. She hoped she hadn’t somehow been torn. <br />
<br />
Michael soon had her moaning. He had never known Kerry to moan before. Was this something peculiar to Kate’s body? It actually made him feel very virile and he prolonged her pleasure for as long as possible. It took Kerry to scream out “For god sake unload!” for him to finish the deed.<br />
<br />
Back in the other house, Tom had used his tongue to get Kate to orgasm. He didn’t particularly enjoy the taste of his own semen but he felt guilty that he had been premature. When she finally did come to orgasm he found himself rejuvenated and quickly reinserted himself for round 2. After that he quickly fell asleep.<br />
<br />
Kerry did the rejuvenating back in the other house. She did enjoy the taste of semen and was only too happy to clean Michael’s penis. Eventually they were able to enjoy a second round before both fell asleep.</p>
