<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dylan woke the next morning feeling more comfortable in his new body, but less so with his situation. Stuck in the body of a criminal, they hadn&#39;t been caught yet, but he knew he&#39;d be on the hook for more than one break in. He got up and dressed, a pair of scuffed up work boots, jeans that were ratty in places, a tee that was a bit faded and a leather jacket that had seen better days. At least none of it was black.<br />
<br />
He decided to just walk into town, waste time and think things through. If he was going to make this work he needed a job, an honest one. And he needed to clean up that trailer of his. He slowed down a bit, realizing he was making plans as if this was now his new life. But it was. Wasn&#39;t it. He had paused just outside a coffee shop and a man coming out almost ran right into him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Find a better place to doze off.&quot; The man said sharply, brushing some spilled coffee off the front of his jacket. Dylan met his blue eyes and his own went wide in shock. Those were the right eyes, once messy black hair was tamed into a neat crewcut, and he sported a short-trimmed black beard. Not to mention three more years of age, but that was his body!<br />
<br />
Jake had already started walking off, muttering to himself, and Dylan ran to catch up. &quot;Jake!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake stopped and turned to look at Dylan, brows furrowed in confusion. &quot;Do I know you?&quot; He looked Dylan up and down, frowning slightly.<br />
<br />
Dylan caught up and looked his old body up and down as well. He was taller in Dylan&#39;s, but Jake had quite a bit more muscle than him. He was good looking too. Dylan shoved his hands under his arms, trying not to drool over his old body. Since when was he attracted to men, anyway? Dylan had been straight, and Jake was sure as he could have been at 12 that he was, too. &quot;Yes.&quot; He finally answered when it looked like Jake was going to walk off again. &quot;We met in my, your grandparents&#39; attic. By a mirror.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit.&quot; Jake muttered. &quot;You got out quick, what? Three years? I was stuck in that damn thing for over two hundred. I don&#39;t recognize that body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some thief that broke in, he decided to try to just take the genie and leave the mirror behind.&quot; Dylan exclaimed, looking warily at others passing them on the street, but none seemed to stop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Clever. C&#39;mon, I have an apartment nearby where we can talk.&quot; Jake turned and walked, rebuffing any attempts at conversation until he turned to a door a block away, climbing a few steps and into a second floor apartment. The place was neat, and honestly to Jake&#39;s tastes, which might not be a surprise. It still had a bachelor pad air, but not like the mess of a trailer Dylan had. Jake shrugged out of his jacket and hung it on a hook by the door, inviting Dylan to do the same. Then he pointed at Dylan&#39;s messy boots. &quot;Off.&quot; Dylan complied with a roll of his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Worse than mom.&quot; That got a withering look out of Jake, but they both walked into the apartment, Jake flopping into the couch and motioning at the chair.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you obviously want something from me.&quot; Jake said as he sipped his coffee, watching Dylan like a hawk.<br />
<br />
Dylan&#39;s fingers itched to try to pocket some of the things around the apartment, but he held back. &quot;My body. This is a good one, you can have it. We just go to the mirror, ask it to swap..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Jake interrupted. &quot;I like this one. And if that&#39;s a good body, you can keep it. It is pretty good looking, a little scruffy and rough around the edges, but I bet it cleans up nice. Besides, I&#39;m not invoking another cost just to bounce to a new body. I&#39;ve put three years of hard work into this one.&quot; He lifted an arm and flexed it with a smile. &quot;Besides, it won&#39;t work. This body was part of your cost for freeing me, you can&#39;t get it back with a wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dylan wanted to touch that arm. Instead he sat on his hands in the chair. &quot;There has to be some..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So the cost did carry over.&quot; Jake interrupted with a grin, leaning forward to examine Dylan.<br />
<br />
&quot;What cost? The one for making me older?&quot; Dylan&#39;s eyes shot open. &quot;You made me like men!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Got it in one, you&#39;re smarter than you look.&quot; Jake set his coffee aside and stood up as if to usher Dylan out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait! Then help me get the mirror. You get me in the house, we get the mirror out. I take it, you go on your way.&quot; Dylan was almost begging, and Jake was looking down at him. That impressive physique, that cocky grin. Dylan pushed the thoughts aside.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you were smart, you want to mess with a mirror that has someone you trapped inside of it?&quot; Jake snorted. &quot;If that&#39;s what you want, but what do I get out of it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My body!&quot; Dylan snapped, standing up to be face to face with his old body.<br />
<br />
&quot;I already have that.&quot; Jake crossed his arms as he looked Dylan up and down once more then nodded. &quot;Hmm, yes. I know. We&#39;d need to get you into the house without any questions asked anyway. And I need a family holiday where mom and dad aren&#39;t riding my ass about meeting someone. You&#39;re going to be my date for the week.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?! Wait, no.. no way am I..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll need to clean you up. White trash isn&#39;t really my thing even if it does have a certain edge to it. But first I want to see how dedicated you are. Strip.&quot;  Jake&#39;s tone was clear, this was the only way.<br />
<br />
Dylan considered. He could just live out a life in this body, and he couldn&#39;t get his old body back, but he could still wish.. maybe to have his old family back, be a kid again. He&#39;d just put up with the costs. He did as told and pulled off his shirt, exposing his lean, lightly furred chest which had Jake smiling. Pants came off next and that got a nod of approval from his old body. &quot;Yikes, you&#39;re packing, aren&#39;t you? Yeah.. I think you&#39;ll do well.&quot; Jacob began to strip himself. Seeing his old body naked, it certainly had been bulked up since he wished for it. Large smooth pecs, a tight six pack, just the hint of a dark treasure trail up the middle. And his cock. Like their bodies, Dylan&#39;s was longer, but Jake&#39;s was thicker.  Dylan felt his cock swelling as he stood face to face with the other man, both bare naked, but saw Jake&#39;s swelling, too.<br />
<br />
Then his lips were on Dylan&#39;s, a hand on his cock guiding him with his superior strength back into another room. &quot;What.. what are you doing?&quot; Dylan asked when Jake broke the kiss. &quot;Getting payment.&quot; He shoved Dylan back, and he landed on a bed with an oomph, and sook Jake was on top of him. Dylan had never experienced anything like this before, well, Dylan&#39;s memories had this in reverse with him and women, but the part of Dylan that was once Jake was stunned. The new Jake on the other hand seemed very experienced.<br />
<br />
To Dylan it was just an awkward tangle of limbs, hands, and mouths until he was on his side with Jake behind him. He gasped as he felt himself being pushed apart by Jake&#39;s thick tool. Dylan kept trying to say no, to stop this, but he realized he didn&#39;t want to. More of him wanted this than didn&#39;t, and the part that didn&#39;t was quickly fading. He rode that cock, feeling his own twitching eagerly in response. He came first, but Jake wasn&#39;t far behind, flooding his gut with his cum.<br />
<br />
&quot;See. Not so bad is it?&quot; Jake teased from behind Dylan as he wrapped an arm around him almost protectively.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, we&#39;ll go with your plan.&quot; Dylan conceded, feeling oddly satisfied laying here in Jake&#39;s arms. Maybe he could just.. no. He needed that mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shopping then.&quot; Jake said after a moment. &quot;And a trip to a hair salon. We need to get you some better clothes, and while the long hair is cute, you need it trimmed a little. If I&#39;m bringing you home, you&#39;re looking my type.&quot;</p>
