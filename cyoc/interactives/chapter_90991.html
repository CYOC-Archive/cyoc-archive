<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eventually, Teresa arrived at her house. Heading into her garage, Teresa placed Jen&#39;s head back on the bike as said, &quot;I need my backpack.&quot; Jen felt her body reform into the earlier object, and winced at the textbook pushing her body outwards. Though definitely nowhere near the pain she experienced while being a bike, it was still pretty bad. Teresa carried Jen upstairs, then started taking stuff out. Jen sighs with relief as the textbooks are taken out. Without warning, Teresa stops and looks around, &quot;Hello? Anyone there?&quot; Jen immediately starts yelling for help and Teresa screams and jumps off her bed. &quot;Oh my god, oh my god, it talks, it talks, oh my god, it must have been that....&quot; Jen, meanwhile, was finding it hard to talk with the flap open most of the way, &quot;Peas coe a ap a it.&quot; she says. Teresa, to her credit, actually listens, &quot;What?&quot; she asks, cautiously edging back towards the bed. &quot;cose a fap!!&quot; Jen says. Teresa slowly zips Jen&#39;s mouth all the way closed, only to hear mumbling, &quot;mmmhmmm, mmm  hhhm!&quot; Opening Jen&#39;s mouth slightly, Teresa asks, &quot;Is that better?&quot; &quot;Yea thanks,&quot; says Jen, &quot;I&#39;m just glad you realized what&#39;s happened a bit.&quot; Teresa cocks her head slightly and says, &quot;I don&#39;t quite get what happened, but I think I have a guess, it was the transform or dare curse wasn&#39;t it?&quot; &quot;Yea!&quot; Jen said, &quot;how&#39;d you know?&quot; Shaking her head, Teresa sits down, &quot;I was cursed by to stay a kid forever, and to have no one remember me 3 years ago. It&#39;s really the only thing that I know of that could do this.&quot; &quot;Wait,&quot; Jen says, &quot;If you were cursed to be a kid, and to have no one remember you, how are you living like this, and you&#39;re a teen, not a kid!&quot; Teresa smiles, &quot;Loopholes. Little known fact about the curse, it has a nice side. From what I can tell, the curse checks the personality of each person and then tries to either make the curse worse, if it doesn&#39;t like you, or better, if it does. For example, I was super popular and I got harassed by someone who thought they were better than me, and was bitter because they weren&#39;t. My friends struck out at her, I wasn&#39;t particularly sympathetic, she cursed me.&quot; Jen smiles internally and replies, &quot;That&#39;s almost exactly what happened to me!&quot; Teresa smiles sadly and continues, &quot;Yea, some people never consider that people might be popular because they&#39;re nice to everyone unless antagonized. Anyway, for the first three days I was stuck as an 8 year old on the streets, no one remembered me. Then the curse shifted itself. I woke up on the third day holding a key and knowing where a house was. When I arrived, it was empty and stocked with food. As the days went on, everything I wanted appeared, eventually I noticed I was getting older. No one remembered me, and at some point, I just stopped getting older. At that point i woke up knowing I had an identity at school. The loophole that was used, as far as I can tell, is essentially that the curse was used to change people&#39;s memories, so while it was unable to change them back, it could modify them a bit to help me. The age is probably because while not what was intended, a teen is still technically a kid by the US&#39;s laws. Anyway, what&#39;s your story, how long have you been like this, I&#39;m guessing this is the first time someone heard you?&quot; &quot;I&#39;ve been like this for only today actually,&quot; Jen starts, &quot;I got curse in pretty much the same situation as you, someone decided that being popular meant I was a jerk, attacked me verbally, my friends pantsed him, he cursed me. The curse has two parts really. The first is that whenever someone sees me, they&#39;ll see me as whatever object they need at the moment, and my body will react as if it is actually that object almost. Thought you see a regular backpack, what I see currently is myself shrunken a bit with my mouth as the primary pocket and my, umm, groin area as the smaller one. My hands are linked to my feet to make the strap.&quot; Teresa winces, then says, &quot;wait one sec, I&#39;m going to see if I can see you as you really are, that should also have the benefit of untying you probably.&quot; Teresa stares at Jen for a minute, before Jen says, &quot;Umm, maybe you could say &#39;I need a regular person&#39; I think the curse adapted to let you actively decide the form I take.&quot; &quot;Sounds reasonable,&quot; she responds, &quot;I need a regular person.&quot; Jen returns to normal and Teresa sucks in a breath, &quot;I know you, or, I kind of do. I think the curse wiped everyone&#39;s mind of you, but is somehow letting me remember. I have all the information, but it feels like it didn&#39;t actually happen if that makes sense.&quot; Stretching a bit, Jen says, &quot;Yea, kind of.&quot; Teresa get&#39;s up and heads to her dresser, &quot;Here let&#39;s get you some clothes.&quot; she says as she throws a shirt at Jen. &quot;Ooof&quot; Jen says falling over as the shirt hits her. &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Asks Teresa, looking concerned. &quot;It&#39;s the other part of the curse.&quot; Jen replies, &quot;I literally have exactly enough strength to move my own body, not enough for anything else, including clothes.&quot; &quot;Hmm,&quot; Teresa says, pacing, &quot;We&#39;ll have to wait and see if the curse get&#39;s around that somehow.&quot; &quot;Yea,&quot; Jen replies, &quot;Umm, can I get a little help?&quot; Teresa rushes over, &quot;Oh, yea sorry... While we&#39;re on the topic, any other loopholes so far?&quot; Getting up, Jen starts listing them on her fingers, &quot;Umm, I don&#39;t think I feel cold, that was solved just before I met you for the first time, I don&#39;t feel pain anymore unless it would be damaging the type of object I am,&quot; at this, Teresa winces, &quot;Sorry...&quot; &quot;You didn&#39;t know,&quot; Jen responds, &quot;Umm, I don&#39;t think I need to express bodily needs like hunger or thirst of the bathroom of any sort as an object. Right now I probably would though. I think that&#39;s all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Teresa responds, &quot;Well I don&#39;t see much else to do right now, I&#39;m going to go do homework if you want to join me.&quot; As she says this, Teresa get&#39;s up and heads towards the door downstairs. &quot;Alright,&quot; Jen says.<br />
<br />
When they reach the living room, Teresa pulls out the paper and scavenges around for a pencil. She&#39;s distracted by a small shriek by Jen. Terresa turns to see Jen shrink down to the size of a pencil. Her legs melt into her body and her head pointing upwards, her mouth opening into a circular opening with her tongue emerging from the top, large and pure white. A small piece of black emerges from her groin. Turning her into a mechanical pencil. &quot;Whoa, I&#39;m so sorry Jen!&quot; Teresa says, &quot;I didn&#39;t even say anything.&quot; To her surprise, even though her mouth can&#39;t move, Teresa hears Jen&#39;s response, &quot;It&#39;s fine, not your fault.&quot; &quot;I just heard you in my head!&quot; Teresa shouts. &quot;I guess I can do that too then, I was just trying to talk...&quot; Jen says. Teresa steps closer and picks up Jen, &quot;Well, I think I can see you as you actually are, it looks uncomfortable.&quot; &quot;Not really,&quot; Jen projects, &quot;Actually, if you want to use me, you can.&quot; Teresa sits there for a moment, &quot;But, wouldn&#39;t that hurt you?&quot; &quot;I&#39;ve only ever been hurt when I was &quot;broken&quot; or being damaged, like the textbooks stretching inside of me. I don&#39;t think this will.&quot; Wincing again, Teresa replies, &quot;Sorry again about that, anyway, I guess I&#39;ll try.&quot; Teresa begins to use Jen to do her homework. Somehow, the eraser and lead on Jen never seems to decrease throughout the work. &quot;How does it feel?&quot; Teresa asks Jen, &quot;The writing itself is a bit... stimulating...&quot; Jen mumbles to Teresa, &quot;But don&#39;t stop.&quot; Pulling herself together while Teresa stretches her fingers, Jen asks, &quot;So, I have a weird question. I have the feeling I&#39;d be really bored staying here all day. I can&#39;t read, can&#39;t play games, and can&#39;t change the channel on TV assuming you leave it on for me, would you mind taking me to school and, well using me?&quot; Teresa doesn&#39;t answer for a bit, then says, &quot;Alright, I was originally a little scared that you&#39;d get seen, but I realized that the curse is really good at covering up it&#39;s own existence. That and the fact that I can override any changes anyone makes should make it ok.&quot; Jen smiles to herself as they finish Teresa&#39;s work.</p>
