<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Raine just sat there spread leg on the floor of her new room looking up at the spot where the genie Gaz used to be. Only a minute or two ago, she had been a normal college dude who had come across a magic genie and wished to become the perfect lover and partner to the girl of his dreams. Not knowing that the girl of his dreams, Kim was actually a lesbian Gaz had transformed him into a black-haired bombshell of a women who was now in a poly relationship with Kim and whomever Kim’s girlfriend had been before this all happened. <br />
He or rather she didn’t remember, Gaz had mixed the old and the new memories together so that she remember both her life as Ryan and what her life as Raine is. Slowly she pulled herself to her feet wincing a bit in pain as she grabbed her ankle. <br />
<br />
Her ankle, that was the ankle Ryan had hurt badly in a JV game of basketball when he was in 9th grade, hurt it so badly that it still hurt him to this day from time to time. When Raine touched it she remembered hurting that same ankle on her Varsity basketball team in the 9th grade on their way to winning state. The doctors recommended she never play again so she didn’t but was a bummer but that is when she got into computers and coding. <br />
<br />
“Looks like Gaz modified my history too.” Said Raine as she stood up, her ankle popping into place, hurting for a moment before the pain went away. She moved over to a mirror located by the desk, she was hot…beautiful dark eyes, long silky-smooth curls of black hair which framed her face. She wasn’t the tallest, but she was still taller then most. Her make up was running from her tears and with years of practice she never had as Ryan she reached over and going off memory picked up the make up supplies needed to fix them. Within minutes she was looking normal again.<br />
<br />
“Alright let’s figure some shit out.” Said Raine as she sat down at her laptop, the code to get in was the same as it has been when she had been a he. She found facebook to find she had a lot of more friends, lots of photos with her and Kim along with other women hanging out. She found a photo of herself in two cosplay outfits, instantly she recognized them even if she hadn’t seen them before. Ryan had had two cosplay outfits himself; one was his D&D character a powerful wizard, Raine’s D&D character cosplay was a female witch who looked like a sexy librarian. If Ryan had seen Raine out of context he would have been turned on by the look, the second was from an anime he had watched but instead of the main lead Raine was cosplaying as the sexy female led dressed in a Japanese school girl uniform with a bloody samurai sword in hand. <br />
<br />
“I always had a thing for the Japanese’s school girl and sexy librarian stuff maybe that is my kink?” said Raine as she closed out facebook and looked at her school records. Raine was much higher up in the class rankings then Ryan had ever dreamed to be, she wasn’t in the top 10 or even the top 25 but being in the top 50 in a class of a few thousands was very good.<br />
<br />
“Of course I would be up there, there is no way my lovers would take someone so low.” Said Raine as she flipped her long hair over her shoulders. She pulled up her class schedule it was the same as it was when she was Ryan, so she had no classes for the rest of the day and none tomorrow either (Friday). She went back to Facebook and checked her family to find that as least on social media everything looked the same. She shut down her laptop and went over to the closet. She pulled it open to find a few dresses, jeans, tops and the two cosplay outfits from earlier. One dress did jump out to her, it looked like a red and black cocktail dress but one inspired by Japanese kimono with the fabric pattern.<br />
<br />
Nothing seemed out of the ordinary until she reached up and found a rather large strap on. She pulled it down and looked at it in a mixture of horror and being turned on, she knew Raine must have used this in the past and given the look it had been used a lot but still to Ryan it was something horrifying. <br />
<br />
“Well…” said Raine as she put that back and reached for a different draw. She pulled it open to find a few pieces of sexy lingerie sitting there waiting for her. She lifted one up to see what they looked like. She was holding up a black set which was all but see through in a lot of places when the door to the house opened. <br />
<br />
She was so lost in trying to figure out everything she didn’t hear the knock at her door or even notice the door open. <br />
<br />
Raine almost jumped sky high as a pair of arms wrapped her from behind pulling her into a side hug as someone gently kissed her cheek. She could feel her arm had been trapped between a pair of breasts as one hand rested on her ass while another sat on the top of her skirt in the front ready to pull it down at a moments notice. <br />
<br />
“Getting ready a little early Raine? Well we could skip our plans and just wait for our third member or you and I could have some fun while we wait.” Said a soft Sexy voice as Raine’s face blushed as she felt herself get extremely turned on. <br />
<br />
Slowly she turned to see whom had come to her room, was it Kim or the 3rd member of their Poly lesbian relationship? The one she couldn’t remember who it was.</p>
