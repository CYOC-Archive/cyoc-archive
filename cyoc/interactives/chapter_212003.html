<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Moments after Ellie, Harper, Beck, Brianna, Kristi, and Joelle had vanished into the portal, six new people stepped out of it. Two of them appeared to be obese anthropomorphic raccoon dogs, three took the form of two-tailed humanoid foxes (one with white fur, one with black fur, and one with standard orange fur), and one was an amazonian girl with red skin, horns, and tusks. The two tanuki and one of the kitsune were herms, all of them were naked aside from their fur (or a tiger-skin loincloth, in the oni girl&#39;s case). The yokai had finally arrived!<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to America!&quot; Selena smiled brightly at the yokai. &quot;I&#39;m Selena Lyall, alpha of the Stokerville werehyena pack. I&#39;ll be your mentor in the American magical community while you&#39;re here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I am Morgana Faye,&quot; Morgana said. &quot;I am the proprietress of this shop and the one whose magic brought you here.&quot; She gestured at Vivi. &quot;And this is my daughter and apprentice, Vivienne Faye, though I believe her friends call her Vivi.&quot; She then gestured at Dani. &quot;And this is my other apprentice (and Vivienne&#39;s girlfriend), Daniela Romero-Marquez, or Dani for short.&quot;<br />
<br />
One of the tanuki bowed respectfully. &quot;We&#39;re honored to meet you, Ms. Lyall. Or may I say Selena-san. I took a Potion of Understanding, but I still feel more comfortable using Japanese honorifics.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Use whatever you want,&quot; Selena grinned. &quot;You&#39;re my guests here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Selena-san,&quot; said the tanuki. &quot;My name is Humiya Omoibushi, and I am a rikishi student at Kyodainayokai-beya, Ky&#363;ri-sensei&#39;s sumo heya.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I am Yuna Hayashida,&quot; the white-furred kitsune said with a polite bow. &quot;I&#39;m studying to be a musumeyaku at Takarazuka Music School in hopes of joining the Takarazuka Revue. I look forward to participating in Stokerville Public High School&#39;s performing arts programs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can tell my packmate Lily&#39;s going to love you,&quot; Selena said. &quot;She&#39;s in the drama club.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t wait!&quot; Yuna declared, an excited grin spreading over her white-furred muzzle.<br />
<br />
Rather than bowing, the black-furred herm kitsune practically danced over to Selena and kissed her hand. &quot;Greetings, Selena! I&#39;m the one and only Maiko Hiko! I am a yako, a mischief-maker, a shiy&#363;d&#333;tai, and a soon-to-be famous Takarazuka otokoyaku. Perhaps the lovely Yuna and I will have an opportunity to showcase our many talents to this little town?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I said, our school has a drama club that Lily&#39;s in,&quot; Selena said. &quot;I&#39;m sure she&#39;d be happy to help you two join.&quot; Selena flinched when she noticed that Maiko was beginning to grind hir dick against Selena&#39;s thigh. &quot;Please, could you cut that out? I barely know you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, so sorry,&quot; Maiko chuckled, not looking sorry at all. Shi <i>did</i> remove hir hard cock from Selena&#39;s thigh, though.<br />
<br />
The oni then bowed to Selena. &quot;Nice to meet you, Selena. I am H&#333;k&#333; Jigokumoto. I come from an oni clan in the mountains. I was studying sorcery in my village and I hope to continue my magical training here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll see what I can do,&quot; said Morgana. &quot;We can discuss the details after school lets out.&quot;<br />
<br />
The other kitsune then bowed. &quot;And I&#39;m Asuga Inn&#333;. Gorgeous, aren&#39;t I?&quot; Shi proudly jiggled hir pendulous belly and melon-like tits and patted hir enormous ballsack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Asuga, be modest,&quot; Humiya whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Asuga whispered back. &quot;Anyway, I come from the tanuki village of Toyoda, where I go to the local high school. No, we don&#39;t make cars there. That&#39;s <i>ToyoTA!</i>&quot; Asuga&#39;s belly shook wildly as shi laughed at hir own terrible pun.<br />
<br />
Humiya glanced back at the orange-furred kitsune girl, who was huddling near the portal. &quot;Tamiko, you should introduce yourself to our generous hosts. We don&#39;t want to be rude, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no, of course not,&quot; Tamiko said shyly. The slender, graceful kitsune girl slowly approached Selena. &quot;Uh, h-hi, Selena-san&quot; she said, her gentle eyes cast downward. &quot;I&#39;m Tamiko Inarimago, and I... I come from Inamura High School, my kitsune village&#39;s school. I... I guess I&#39;m excited to see America... but I&#39;m a little terrified, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Tamiko,&quot; Selena smiled encouragingly. &quot;We&#39;ll all do our best to make you feel welcome, and I&#39;m sure your host families will do the same.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now let&#39;s change into our human forms,&quot; Humiya said, taking charge of the situation. &quot;Once we&#39;re in public, there will be human eyes on us. The mortals must not know that we aren&#39;t human ourselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Humiya began to change. Hir fur receded, and her muzzle and tail sank into hir body. As hir claws blunted into fingernails, hir ballsack shrank down to a more normal (but still plump) size. Hir dick slightly changed shape into a human penis with a long, tight foreskin. Before Selena now stood a fat futanari human girl with long, black hair and Japanese features.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you need a leaf to do that?&quot; Dani asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only to assume additional forms beyond hir basic ones,&quot; Morgana explained. &quot;A tanuki may naturally assume the shape of a full raccoon dog and <i>one specific</i> human form. A leaf is needed for additional shapes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see she kept hir penis, too,&quot; Vivi added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tanuki always do,&quot; Morgana answered, &quot;as do kitsune who are shiy&#363;d&#333;tai like Maiko. They <i>could</i> turn them into clitorises if they wished to, but most shiy&#363;d&#333;tai yokai take great pride in their penises and instead pass themselves off as intersex humans.&quot;<br />
<br />
Asuga laughed, causing hir enormous belly to wobble like Jell-O. &quot;Please, Morgana-sama, &#39;shiy&#363;d&#333;tai&#39; is such a formal word! Ky&#363;ri-sensei may call us that, but we kids prefer the term &#39;futanari&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn&#39;t that term come from hentai?&quot; Vivi asked, blushing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t mind in the least!&quot; Asuga grinned impishly as shi shifted into hir (still very futanari) human form. Hir enormous tanuki belly was not diminished at all by hir human transformation. Shi merrily drummed on it, making the mountain of fat ripple.<br />
<br />
H&#333;k&#333; then noticed Dani and walked over to her, hastily casting a spell to assume human form as she did. &quot;Oh, I didn&#39;t realize that you weren&#39;t human,&quot; the oni girl said with fascination, flicking the witch apprentice&#39;s feline ears. &quot;Are you a nekomimi?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A what?&quot; Dani asked, perplexed. &quot;<i>¿Cuál fue esa palabra?</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a kind of yokai,&quot; H&#333;k&#333; explained, now in the shape of an unusually tall and muscular Japanese human girl. &quot;They&#39;re also called nekomusume, but that term&#39;s going out of fashion for overlooking the males of the breed. You in the West know them as catgirls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a <i>real</i> kind of yokai?!&quot; Dani said incredulously. &quot;I thought they were just an <i>imaginario</i> anime trope. I never found them in Morgana&#39;s book on yokai.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When was that book published?&quot; H&#333;k&#333; asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The front page said 1935,&quot; said Dani.<br />
<br />
&quot;That explains it,&quot; H&#333;k&#333; responded. &quot;The nekomimi was first sighted in 1924, but it was only formally recognized as a legitimate yokai breed in 1936. Their numbers have grown since then, and they&#39;ve been flourishing since the 1990s. They&#39;re probably the most plentiful yokai species by now. They evolved from the bakeneko in the early Twentieth Century, probably through bakeneko/human crossbreeding. Thankfully, they&#39;re <i>much</i> friendlier to humans than bakeneko are. In fact, they&#39;re known for their sweet and outgoing natures. Since they can magically hide their ears and tails, a lot of them live among the humans with no one being the wiser.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Yuna agreed as she transformed herself into a regal human girl with Japanese features and unnaturally white hair, &quot;there&#39;s almost as many nekomimi performing at the Takarazuka Review as there are kitsune or humans.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A lot of famous Japanese actresses, models, and idol singers are secretly nekomimi, too,&quot; Maiko added as shi shifted into a slinky Japanese girl with a thick, bratwurst-like, uncut cock hanging seductively from hir crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m not a nekomimi,&quot; Dani said. &quot;I&#39;m just an ordinary apprentice witch who whipped up an ointment to turn herself into a cat and couldn&#39;t make it go all the way. Thing is, I liked having ears, claws, and a nose like a <i>gato</i>, so I decided to keep it. I hope to add more kitty features like a tail and a proper fur coat later. Don&#39;t worry, I have a glamour that hides it all from normal people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s smart, Dani-san,&quot; Tamiko said as she willed away her two-tailed foxgirl form and turned herself into a tiny, willowy Japanese girl with glossy black hair flowing down to her naked buttcheeks. &quot;I&#39;d <i>die</i> if the humans found out that I was a kitsune!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d suffer a fate <i>worse</i> than death,&quot; Yuna said darkly. &quot;I&#39;d be expelled from Takarazuka Music School!&quot; She glared darkly at Maiko. &quot;On that note, no flirting or <i>especially</i> fucking with the locals, Maiko. You know as well as I do that Takarasiennes are expected to remain pure and chaste.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, lighten up, Yuna-chan!&quot; Maiko laughed, elbowing hir friend in the ribs. &quot;We&#39;re in America now! Our instructors back in Takarazuka won&#39;t have a fucking clue what we get up to. I say we make the most of it and have some fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
Selena chuckled. &quot;I bet you&#39;ll make a lot of friends in the werefox caravan camped just outside of town.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maiko grinned wickedly. &quot;This town just got a lot more interesting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll all look far <i>too</i> interesting yourselves if you go to school in that state of undress,&quot; Morgana remarked as she stooped over a box. &quot;You&#39;ll need these.&quot; She stood up, her arms full of shirts, jeans, skirts, shoes, and lingerie. &quot;I&#39;m loaning you some of Vivienne&#39;s clothes so you can get to school. I also purchased some extra clothing sized for tanuki. I advise you all get dressed now.&quot;<br />
<br />
The yokai exchange students all hastily donned some clothes, Asuga and Maiko dressing themselves in the most revealing pieces they could find, while Humiya, Tamiko, Yuna, and H&#333;k&#333; opted for more conservative looks. Unfortunately, Morgana hadn&#39;t had Humiya&#39;s and Asuga&#39;s measurements when she&#39;d bought clothes for them, so their outfits were just a little tight; nonetheless, it beat trying to squeeze into Vivi&#39;s old clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;ll need to buy something bigger after school...&quot; Humiya thought out loud.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I like this shirt,&quot; Asuga smiled. &quot;Look how much of my tummy it shows off!&quot; Shi gleefully shimmied to make hir thick rolls of blubber quiver. Shi ran hir chubby fingers over the bulge in hir shorts. &quot;I can&#39;t wait for all the girls to ask me about <i>this</i> baby... or for my chance to show it off to them in all its glory.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just don&#39;t flash your dick in public,&quot; Humiya frowned.<br />
<br />
Asuga stuck hir tongue out. &quot;Are you <i>sure</i> you&#39;re really a tanuki, Humiya-san? You seem much too responsible for one sometimes!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we&#39;d better be off to school if we don&#39;t wanna be late,&quot; Selena said. &quot;Follow me, everybody.&quot;</p>
