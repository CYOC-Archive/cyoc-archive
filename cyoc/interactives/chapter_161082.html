<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Henry awoke early and seeing want was lying tucked snuggly close to where he had slept, the thought of a woman becoming a doe goat made him to smile. She being a goat would if from Henry getting up off the bed, should have awakened her; but after all he had done, put her through, she was soundly asleep.<br />
<br />
Henry had all but forgotten his past and previous self, having discovered the lusty lifestyle of a satyr; he by desires was more a buck goat, than was his bodily form. He would when if asked by a victim, told them as to his joy he felt from having become in part as an animal. He marveled as to his physical strength and having the stamina of a young buck goat. He liked the physical assertion of running, treading the ground with cloven hoofs, and capable of speed as never before, he admired too his agility.<br />
<br />
In minutes while he prepared some munchies taken out of the kitchen, Betty awoke and seeing, she began looking for him, be was not beside her, she began to Maa...!<br />
<br />
Her maaing cries were loud and the shrill tone she broadcast bothered Henry, and he felt sure someone outside the home would hear as wonder. Henry ran to be by her side, to pet and fondle. “No, no, no, dearest, your buck stud is still here,” Henry called to Betty as he ran, and she rising, jumped from off the bed, as ran to meet her sensual lover.<br />
<br />
Betty ran at Henry and she leaped her forelegs as over his shoulders, she wishing to lick his face for the love she felt for him.<br />
<br />
“Whoa, whoa…, take it easy, as today is the first day of the new life I have given to you as my gift. As yes, I plan to leave, as my wife waits for her husband. Say though, as she most certainly is not expecting to see me being a satyr. As for you, well from becoming all a doe goat of bodily form, your brain is smaller, and the learned abilities such as reading, writing, mathematics and soon too your being appreciative of me, are concepts a doe goat will never understand. <br />
In short and plain language, as by noon today you should have degraded mentally to being a very intelligent goat, but mostly a goat, and very little remembrance of the woman you were yesterday.<br />
<br />
Oh stop your whining, being as all a goat is an easy, peaceful existence. My becoming a satyr leaves me not caring in the least what might happen to you; you being a quick bit of sexual pleasure and little more!”<br />
<br />
Betty bleated as though she were fearing her new self, and what Henry said about her becoming by noon of that day as is an ignorant doe goat horrified her. She knew her body felt wildly horny, and wanted the sensual feel of what Henry had, and was endowed with he as it when inserted, felt like heaven to a doe goat.<br />
<br />
“Tell you what I shall do for you, as we shall leave here together. I shall trek onward toward my home, and you dear dearest, if you give the wafting breeze a sniff, you should scent the Blair Goat farm, as knowing it as your best chance for a future and a home.<br />
<br />
It is either my goodbye Betty or you can follow along, and don’t think it was not fun for the both of us, but by all rights you need to accept your situation, seek out and find your future; a big doe goat like you could seduce equally big bucks to mate. Know this that from my loins I have gifted you with similar infections abilities, so a young man or lesbian girlfriend you could corral into your part of the herd.”<br />
<br />
That said, and Henry left there Betty to stand and think, she pondering the thought of finding a human playmate and infecting them with a lustier lifestyle. As Henry never looked back as doing that was a poor habit. He would tell many of his future victims, of looking behind held the mindset to caring, and being a satyr or a goat animal, caring for someone was a stupid waste of good semen.<br />
<br />
Leaving Betty behind, he ran along a gully and though deep underbrush until it became dusk, he coming into a dark woods. Giving a careful looking around, Henry felt quite at home. Stopping along a small creek he sat down on his shaggy furred butt. Adjusting his tail due to some discomfort he leaned to one elbow and contemplated his place in nature.<br />
<br />
Suddenly a sound of something moving he picked up by his keen ability to hear. As rustling through some Honeysuckle bushes strode a large Whitetail deer, a doe. She sniffed his scent and stepped forward with no apparent concern for her safety. Henry laid there and watched as the doe bowed her head and began to drink from the creek, her ears flicking away the pesky deer flies from her big round brown eyes.<br />
<br />
Henry rose to a seated position, as waiting a long minute before he stood up, but still the deer never flinched. As he stood there she crossed the creek and came close to Henry. She reaching her nose close, as did she sniff, sniffing, followed the scent she liked, stepped slowly to where she with ease did sniff, and then lick at his furry sheath! <br />
<br />
As her long pink tongue poked out her muzzle, she in a second gave a second affectionate lick to his sheath.<br />
<br />
The beastly desires worked to arouse Henry, his Satyr cock sprouted quickly, becoming as fully erect. The shaft was waving in the air stiff and hard, as the deer doe slurped her tongue along the rigid and pinkish length of his cock, to where with a curling of her tongue she wrapped the bulbous distal end, making Henry to enjoy a full body shiver.<br />
<br />
A shiver of sexual thrill roared down his body. He stroked her soft furry back. His hand moved down and with an index finger Henry traced around her anus, and then down to poke inside her dripping vagina. A half step from the deer brought her hindquarters to stand ready and waiting before the satyr. It took less than a second for Henry to gain his entrance into doe&#39;s slick sex. Her warmth welcomed his shaft, and he humped her with wild satyr delight.<br />
<br />
Henry groaned when he felt his balls churn, as doing it with a deer was special, and a new feeling in his chest. The force of this load surprised him, as he had so enjoyed sex with Betty. He found himself enjoying the wilder female relations. As her need calmed and his load spewed, he stepped back from his new desire. Now the strange feeling in his chest showed itself to the light of day. His having sex with both female and animal made the animal side of his form mature a little more. <br />
<br />
He looked down as along his chest and belly, to watch with some delight as his pelt of goat wool grew further north. In just a few minutes and Henry stood there as totally covered in shaggy goatish fur, he from the neck down to his waist. In fact he stood then covered in goat fur, and looked more as if a goat than of being a satyr.<br />
<br />
Ruffling the chest hair with his nimble fingers, he quickly lost any worry or fear. Sitting again he watched the doe deer begin to graze, and he too thought to try grazing, finding it to be a mindless desire to help pass the long day.</p>
