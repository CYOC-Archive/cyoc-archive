<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The morning sun filtered through the tall trees as Cam and Ryder loaded the last of their gear into the navy-blue SUV. The parking area was a familiar spot, surrounded by dense pines and birches that filled the air with the scent of pine resin and fresh earth. The crisp morning air was alive with the sounds of birds chirping, signaling the start of another hiking trip.<br />
Cam, in his early thirties, moved efficiently as he checked the straps on their backpacks. His athletic build was visible beneath his hiking jacket, and his dark hair was slightly tousled from his quick morning routine. He was in great shape, his movements confident and steady.<br />
Ryder, his nine-year-old son, bounced with energy. His blond hair caught the light as he adjusted his colorful cap, featuring a cartoon bear that matched his playful nature. He wore a bright, moisture-wicking shirt and a backpack covered in superhero patches, ready for the adventure ahead.<br />
<br />
They reached the trailhead, where the path was well-trodden and familiar. Ferns and wildflowers in shades of purple and yellow lined the way, and the ground was soft with pine needles and rich soil. Their hiking boots made soft sounds as they began their trek, the weight of their packs balanced and comfortable.<br />
<br />
Cam glanced at Ryder. &quot;Ready to hit the trail?&quot;<br />
Ryder nodded eagerly. &quot;Yeah! I brought extra snacks this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
They walked side by side, chatting about Ryder’s latest school project and Cam’s plans for the weekend. Ryder laughed at his dad’s stories from when he was a kid, enjoying the easy conversation that flowed between them.<br />
<br />
The trail went through thick brush and open clearings, with sunlight dappling through the leaves above. The smell of pine was strong, mixed with the sweet scent of blooming flowers. Occasionally, the sound of running water from a nearby brook added a peaceful background noise.<br />
<br />
As midday approached, the sun climbed higher, casting clear shadows on the ground. Cam adjusted his pack and glanced at Ryder, who was scanning the area with curiosity. They continued walking, their steps in sync as they made their way deeper into the forest.<br />
The trees stood tall around them, their branches forming a canopy that provided shade and shelter. Leaves rustled in the breeze, and birds flitted from branch to branch. The environment felt alive, each sound and scent adding to the experience of being immersed in nature.<br />
<br />
In the distance, they could see a clearing that would be their campsite for the next few days. The area was flat and covered in soft moss, with large oaks providing natural boundaries. A gentle breeze carried the familiar smells of pine and fresh air as they approached their destination.<br />
<br />
Cam and Ryder continued their trek down the familiar trail, the dense canopy above providing intermittent shade from the midday sun. Sweat began to bead on their foreheads as the temperature climbed, the air heavy with the scent of pine and warm earth. Ryder kicked a small stone along the path, watching it skip ahead before turning back with a grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Dad, think we&#39;ll find any cool bugs today?&quot; Ryder asked, his excitement evident.<br />
Cam laughed. &quot;Maybe. Or we might just end up walking in circles.&quot;<br />
After about an hour of hiking, Cam glanced at Ryder. &quot;Alright, time for a quick break.&quot;<br />
<br />
They found a small clearing beside a stream. The water was clear and cool, bubbling over smooth stones. Cam unzipped his backpack, pulling out water bottles and some fruit. Ryder grabbed a granola bar, tearing it open with enthusiasm.<br />
<br />
As Ryder finished his snack, Cam pointed to a discreet spot behind a bush. &quot;Nature calls, buddy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryder nodded and headed towards the spot, while Cam took a moment to wipe his hands on his shorts. The heat pressed down on them, making their shirts cling slightly to their backs. Cam caught his reflection in a nearby puddle, adjusting his straps before turning his attention back to Ryder.<br />
<br />
Once Ryder returned, they continued their hike, the trail gradually sloping downward towards the lake. The sun blazed overhead, making the air feel thick and heavy. By the time they reached the lakeside, the heat was almost unbearable. The lake stretched out before them, its surface shimmering under the intense sunlight, surrounded by dense trees that kept the area secluded.<br />
<br />
Cam sat his bag down under the shade of a large pine and began unloading their gear. <br />
&quot;Alright, we need to set up the tent before we can hit the water.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryder&#39;s eyes sparkled with excitement. &quot;Can we go swimming right now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cam started unpacking the tent poles, glancing at Ryder. &quot;Not just yet. Let&#39;s get the tent up first.&quot;<br />
<br />
They decided to change into their shorts and underwear to make setting up easier. Cam bent down to adjust Ryder’s straps, ensuring his son was comfortable. Ryder wore plain white briefs, typical for a nine-year-old, nothing fancy. Cam quickly changed, slipping into his own shorts, and handed Ryder his spare pair.<br />
<br />
As Cam worked on assembling the tent, his mind drifted back to the gym from the previous week. The memory surfaced unbidden, reminding him of a moment that still lingered. <br />
He had been finishing his workout, wiping sweat from his brow, when he noticed a man across the room. The man wore plain white briefs similar to Ryder’s, but what caught Cam’s attention was the noticeable bulge they created.<br />
<br />
 It was subtle yet unmistakable, enough to make Cam do a double-take. For a split second, jealousy flickered within him. He was in great shape—his pecs firm, his midsection trim, and his build strong—but seeing that bulge made him feel unexpectedly self-conscious.<br />
<br />
 It was hard to tell exactly what was there, but the sight had left Cam feeling a pang of insecurity.<br />
<br />
Shaking off the memory, Cam focused on the task at hand. He connected the tent poles with practiced ease, while Ryder helped by holding sections in place and passing items as needed. The tent material smelled faintly of fabric and pine resin, blending with the natural scents around them.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Almost done,&quot; Cam said, securing the last pole. He zipped up the tent, pulling it taut against the gentle breeze.<br />
<br />
Ryder couldn’t contain himself. &quot;Can we go now? I want to splash in the water!&quot;<br />
Cam glanced at the time, then nodded. &quot;Alright, but stay close.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryder wasted no time. He grabbed his water shoes and dashed towards the edge of the lake, the cool water lapping at his ankles as he splashed and laughed. Cam watched him for a moment, taking in the carefree joy on his son&#39;s face before heading toward the water to join him.<br />
<br />
The lake was refreshing, the water a perfect counter to the heat of the day. They spent the next hour swimming and exploring the shoreline, the secluded spot offering peace and privacy. Cam kept an eye on Ryder, ensuring he stayed safe as his son ventured further into the water.<br />
<br />
As they settled back on the shore, the sun still high but beginning its slow descent, Cam felt the earlier unease from the gym fade away. Here, with Ryder, the worries of everyday life seemed distant. They shared stories and laughed, the simplicity of the moment grounding Cam in the present.<br />
<br />
Ryder leaned against him, tired but happy. &quot;This is the best part, Dad.&quot;<br />
Cam smiled, watching the ripples on the lake’s surface. &quot;Yeah, it really is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cam and Ryder stepped out of the lake, shaking off excess water as the afternoon sun began to dip toward the horizon. They made their way back to the campsite, the secluded spot beside the lake offering a perfect setting for the evening. The air was still warm, carrying the lingering scent of fresh water and pine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, time to set up the fire,&quot; Cam said, pulling out a bundle of dry logs from their backpack.<br />
<br />
Ryder nodded eagerly, grabbing some smaller sticks to help build the fire. They worked together seamlessly, stacking the logs and kindling until flames began to lick the dry wood. The fire crackled and popped, sending sparks dancing into the cooling air.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pass me those marshmallows,&quot; Cam called over the flames, reaching for a stick.<br />
Ryder handed him a skewer, grinning. &quot;Got &#39;em! Ready to roast?&quot;<br />
&quot;Absolutely,&quot; Cam replied, threading a marshmallow onto the stick and holding it over the fire. <br />
<br />
The sweet aroma of toasting marshmallows filled the air as they prepared their s&#39;mores.<br />
As the marshmallows turned golden brown, Cam carefully placed them between graham crackers with a piece of chocolate, handing one to Ryder. They sat close to the fire, the warmth enveloping them as they enjoyed their treats.<br />
<br />
&quot;Think we&#39;ll see any shooting stars tonight?&quot; Ryder asked, his eyes reflecting the flickering flames.<br />
Cam handed him another s&#39;more, smiling. &quot;You never know. If you see one, make a wish.&quot;<br />
Ryder took a big bite, crumbs falling onto his lap. &quot;I hope for more adventures like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cam nodded, gazing up at the darkening sky. If only I could… he thought, his mind drifting back to the gym memory. Damn, how big was he? If only I had been that big… The envy of the locker room… I wish…<br />
<br />
He shook his head, trying to push the thoughts aside as Ryder started pointing out constellations. <br />
<br />
&quot;Look, there&#39;s Orion&#39;s Belt,&quot; Ryder said, tracing the stars with his finger.<br />
&quot;Nice one,&quot; Cam replied, returning his focus to the night sky. <br />
<br />
A big bulge like that guy’s… No, wait… I want my underwear filled out… No… Overflowing.<br />
<br />
A streak of light suddenly arced across the heavens—a shooting star. Ryder sat up, eyes wide with excitement. <br />
&quot;Wow! Make a wish, Dad!&quot;<br />
<br />
Cam took a deep breath, feeling the weight of his thoughts. Alright, he decided, closing his eyes for a moment. I wish…<br />
He opened his eyes, a small smile playing on his lips. &quot;Alright, I made my wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryder clapped his hands. &quot;Awesome! Mine too!&quot;<br />
<br />
They settled back into their chairs, the sounds of the night surrounding them—the gentle rustle of leaves, the distant hoot of an owl, and the soft crackling of the fire. Cam felt a sense of calm wash over him, the earlier jealousy fading as he focused on the present moment with Ryder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready to hit the sack?&quot; Cam asked, noticing Ryder starting to yawn.<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m beat,&quot; Ryder replied, stretching his arms. &quot;Goodnight, Dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Goodnight, Ryder,&quot; Cam said, watching his son crawl into his sleeping bag. The fire continued to burn softly, casting a warm glow around the campsite as the stars twinkled above them.<br />
<br />
Cam lay back on his sleeping pad, staring up at the sky.<br />
<br />
<br />
The firelight flickered as Cam drifted off, the soft crackle of the embers mixing with the sounds of the forest. His wish echoed faintly in his mind as he slipped into sleep, and soon, he was pulled into a vivid dream.<br />
<br />
He was back in the locker room, just like last week. The place had that familiar dampness, the faint smell of sweat and soap hanging in the air. Cam stood at his locker, wearing nothing but his old, worn-out boxers. Across from him, some dude was pulling on a pair of tight briefs—just like the ones Ryder wore. But these weren’t just any briefs. They were full—like, really full. The guy’s cock and balls filled every inch of the fabric, making the pouch bulge out in a way that was impossible to ignore.<br />
<br />
Cam glanced down at his own boxers, loose and hanging around his thighs. He’d seen guys like that in the locker room before, and every time, he’d felt that quiet pang of envy. But this time... something was different.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, he felt it—a slow, unmistakable pressure building down there. His boxers, which had felt roomy just a second ago, were starting to tighten. The waistband dug into his hips, and the fabric pulled snug around his crotch. Cam looked down, his breath catching in his throat. His cock—soft but growing—was stretching out, filling the space in his boxers like it had a mind of its own.<br />
<br />
The bulge swelled, pressing against the fabric. He could feel it—thicker, heavier, more than what should’ve been possible. His dick just kept growing, pushing the front of his boxers out farther and farther, the soft cotton straining to contain it.<br />
<br />
The guy in the briefs across from him had noticed too, his eyes locked on Cam’s expanding bulge. He looked... impressed. No, more than that—amazed.<br />
<br />
Cam’s cock wasn’t stopping. It stretched out, longer and fatter, pressing the fabric to its limit. His balls followed, swelling, filling out the pouch, forcing his legs apart with their weight. <br />
<br />
Cam glanced down again, and his jaw nearly dropped. His dick was huge—way past normal. His boxers looked like they were trying to hold a damn baseball bat, not to mention his nuts, which were now the size of jumbo eggs, pulling his sack down between his legs.<br />
<br />
The guy in the briefs couldn’t take his eyes off it. He was staring, mouth slightly open, as Cam’s cock kept pushing forward, now feet instead of inches, the weight of it pulling the front of his boxers downward. Cam couldn’t help but feel a rush of pride—and something else, something primal. He was big. Bigger than he’d ever imagined.<br />
<br />
His balls swelled even more, now so heavy they hung low between his legs, stretching the sack tight. The guy across the room was still staring, eyes wide with disbelief as Cam’s dick pushed the front of his boxers to the breaking point. The cotton was so tight, it looked like it might rip at any second, but the feeling—God, the feeling—was insane.<br />
<br />
Just as Cam thought his boxers couldn’t hold any more, the waistband gave way, snapping under the pressure. His cock spilled out, free and massive, swinging heavily in front of him. His nuts, big and round, settled between his legs, and all he could think was, Damn.<br />
<br />
The guy in the briefs was still staring, and now, there was nothing left to hide.<br />
<br />
Cam stood there, his massive cock swinging in front of him, the weight of it pulling heavily at his hips. His balls were huge now, hanging low between his legs like soccer balls, making him spread his stance wide just to balance himself. The guy in the briefs hadn’t moved, still staring at Cam’s ridiculous size, eyes wide with amazement—and something else, something that made Cam’s heart race even faster.<br />
<br />
The heat in the locker room seemed to intensify, the air thick and humid. Sweat was dripping down Cam’s back, but all he could focus on was the growing pressure down below. His cock was getting harder—slowly, but steadily—rising up from where it hung, thick and heavy, until it was pointing straight ahead. The sheer size of it was overwhelming, almost three feet now, extending right toward the guy in the briefs. Cam could hardly believe it himself.<br />
<br />
The weight of his cock was something else—thick, throbbing, pulsing with heat. The veins along its length stood out, tight against the skin, the head fat and swollen. It felt hot, so damn heavy, like every inch of him was filled with an impossible amount of pressure. He had to spread his legs even wider, his balls hanging so low and heavy that they pulled at the base, making him feel rooted to the spot.<br />
<br />
It was insane. Cam could barely comprehend the size of his cock now, stiff and straight, reaching almost three feet out in front of him, close enough that the guy in the briefs could practically touch it. The dude hadn’t moved—he was just staring, mesmerized by the sheer size, the way Cam’s cock seemed to fill the entire space between them.<br />
<br />
Cam&#39;s heart was pounding, his body drenched in sweat. The air was thick, heavy with the scent of sweat and heat, and all he could think about was how big he felt, how wide he had to stand just to keep his balance with his massive nuts dangling so low. He could feel the weight of them swinging with every tiny movement he made, each one like a boulder between his legs.<br />
<br />
And then, just as the guy in the briefs started to reach out, his hand moving toward Cam’s impossibly huge cock, the world seemed to blur around the edges. Everything slowed down, the heat and the tension almost unbearable. he guy stepped closer, eyes locked on Cam’s enormous, swollen length, his hand slowly reaching out, fingertips about to graze—<br />
And then, without any jolt or break, Cam’s eyes fluttered open. The soft light of morning was spilling into the tent, the sound of the nearby lake gently lapping against the shore. For a second, he just lay there, staring up at the tent ceiling, his body still warm from the dream, heart pounding in his chest.<br />
<br />
It had felt so real.<br />
<br />
Instinctively, his eyes drifted down to the tent his boxers were making. He was hard as a rock—so hard it hurt—but as he stared, a mix of emotions hit him. Relief, yes, but also a deep twinge of disappointment. There was no massive, three-foot cock stretching his boxers to the breaking point. Just his normal six-incher, stiff and proud, tenting the fabric but not anything close to the size he’d just experienced in the dream.<br />
<br />
Cam exhaled, running a hand over his face as he tried to shake off the lingering heat of the dream. It had been so vivid—too vivid. His heart still pounded as if his body hadn’t quite caught up to the fact that it wasn’t real. He gave a small, almost defeated smile, staring down at his perfectly normal hard-on.<br />
<br />
“Well,” he muttered to himself, “at least it was a good dream.”</p>
