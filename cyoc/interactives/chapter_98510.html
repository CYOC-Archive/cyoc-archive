<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dustin groggily rose from his bed.  He turned off the beeping alarm clock and started looking for some clothes to wear.  He could hear the shower running from the bathroom next door, and he could hear Di moaning softly from within.  He didn&#39;t have enough time to wait for her, so he&#39;d have to skip the shower this morning.  After pulling on some jeans and a decent shirt he sat on the bed.<br />
<br />
Dustin reached under the bed and pulled out the Playgirl magazine he&#39;d been looking at.  Staring at the men within, Dustin&#39;s dick started hardening.  With grim acceptance, Dustin replaced the magazine back under his bed.  Nothing had changed overnight, and he was still feeling attracted to men.  He pulled on his shoes and socks and headed out to the hall.  He was hoping to slip out unnoticed.  He really didn&#39;t want to talk to anyone; he just wanted to think.<br />
<br />
His hope was not realized, as June had just reached the top of the stairs.  She turned to him and smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was just coming to make sure you were up,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Dustin grunted quietly.<br />
<br />
He looked her over.  June was wearing a tiny mini-dress with black fishnet thigh-highs and black stilettos.  Her long black hair waved down her back.  In the past June&#39;s good looks and provocative style of dress usually made Dustin hard, despite being his own mother.  Today, however, he felt nothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you want some breakfast?  I can give you a ride to school so it won&#39;t make you late,&quot; June asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I&#39;m not hungry.  I&#39;ll just walk,&quot; Dustin responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dustin, you&#39;ve really been distant lately.  I want you to know that I love you and I&#39;ll be here whenever you&#39;d like to talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin contemplated telling his mother right then, but thought better of it.  He knew that if he said anything it would get around to Mark, and then his life would be over.  He remembered after Di came out Mark threw her out of the house.  Di stayed with friends for a month until June finally got Mark to accept her back on the condition she never talk about it again.  Dustin knew that Di had gotten off lucky.  He didn&#39;t think he would be as lucky.<br />
<br />
So instead he said &quot;It&#39;s nothing, mom.  Don&#39;t worry about it,&quot; and pushed past her, heading down the stairs and out the door.<br />
<br />
He walked down the street toward the bus stop, still thinking.  &quot;Am I really gay?  I can&#39;t get these thoughts out of my head....  If I&#39;m gay, can I keep it a secret?  Maybe Di will help me....  Would I like sex with a man...?  Would I like playing with a man&#39;s cock...?  Sucking on it...?  Having it enter me...?&quot;  Dustin&#39;s boner returned en force, confirming his desire.<br />
<br />
He reached the bus stop.  Dustin was still trying to relax his hard-on.  He kept thinking about how he really didn&#39;t want to go to school... while thinking these thoughts.  He was feeling terribly uncomfortable.  Dustin&#39;s mind was struggling.  He was trying to tell himself the truth... that he was gay, but he just couldn&#39;t bring himself to accept it.  He knew, he&#39;d either have to force his acceptance, or live uncomfortably in the grim hope that the thoughts would one day pass.  Dustin wasn&#39;t the patient type, and Di&#39;s ringing words of acceptance was helping ease his anxiety.<br />
<br />
Finally steeling himself, Dustin walked away from the bus stop, toward the commercial district.  He was skipping school today, and he would prove to himself either that he was gay, or that he was not.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
30 minutes later Dustin walked through the door of Zoey&#39;s Grounds.  He waited in line and when he reached the cashier--a border collie girl--he said &quot;I&#39;d like a single-shot latte, please.&quot;<br />
<br />
The cashier waited expectantly for a moment, then asked &quot;What animal, sir?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...&quot; Dustin hadn&#39;t actually done this before.  &quot;Can you just make it random...?&quot; and then hurriedly added &quot;Mammal! ....random mammal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, coming right up!&quot; the cashier responded enthusiastically.  As Dustin paid for the drink she asked &quot;What name can I put on the drink?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin really didn&#39;t want anyone to know who he was or why he was here.  That was the reason he was getting a morph in the first place.  He made up a name on the spot and uttered clumsily &quot;uh... Shawn... uh...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, thank you!&quot; said the cashier.<br />
<br />
Dustin went and sat at a table.  He looked around.  It was morning at a coffee shop, so it was relatively busy.  Animal morphs of various kinds, as well as regular humans sat around drinking coffee and looking generally horny.  A pair of cat girls began kissing and licking each other and got up to head through a large door on the side.  The sign on the door said &quot;private rooms&quot;.  A seagull man went and sat down at a table near Dustin where a frog girl was sitting and began striking up a conversation.  It was apparent to Dustin that the two had never met before now, but they laughed and flirted on like they were meeting in a night-club for singles.<br />
<br />
Before long, Dustin&#39;s order was called.  It took him a minute to realize it was his because the barista was shouting &quot;Ashauna!  Random latte!&quot;  Dustin realized the fake name he&#39;d been given was written exactly as he had said it.  He went to the counter to claim his drink.  As he returned to his table he saw the seagull-man and frog-girl already heading toward the private rooms, with looks of lust in their eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Geez, this place is as much a brothel as a coffee shop!&quot; thought Dustin.  Well at least that would make things easier...<br />
<br />
Dustin drank his coffee slowly, noticing changes throughout his body as he did.  The changes didn&#39;t hurt.  In fact they were kind of pleasurable.  It felt like being stroked or massaged.  Slowly his arms, legs, and body began growing white fur...  Well, not fur, he realized soon enough, but wool.  His hands changed to resemble cloven hooves, though he could still grip things with them, including his coffee.  His face pushed out into a snout.  His dick grew, but only a little.  And a small tail grew at the base of his spine.  Dustin had become a sheep-man.<br />
<br />
Dustin was trying to be aware of his mindset as well.  He knew there was a chance that the drink could change his sexual orientation.  If it made him purely heterosexual than he wouldn&#39;t be able to try out being gay, as was his intended experiment.  He didn&#39;t know that Di&#39;s wish had made it so that wasn&#39;t going to be a possibility.  In short, Dustin&#39;s orientation seemed exactly the same.  He still lusted after men, but felt nothing for women.  What did change was his desire.  He felt intensely horny.  He really wanted to find a man and try out gay sex for the first time.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d barely thought that, when a parrot girl sat at his table.  &quot;Hey, cutie, my name&#39;s Lisette!  What&#39;s your name?&quot; she said enthusiastically.  She looked at his cup before Dustin could speak and said &quot;Oh, Ashauna?  That&#39;s a fun and feminine name for a cute guy like you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin stammered... &quot;Yeah, it&#39;s Ashauna... but hey, look... uh, Lisette, I&#39;m really sorry.  You&#39;re really pretty, but... I swing the other way...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, no problem!&quot; said Lisette.  &quot;You should have no trouble picking up a good guy around here, with a morph like that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, thanks,&quot; said Dustin.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll just be on my way, then!&quot; the parrot girl moved on to another table.<br />
<br />
Almost immediately, another person sat at Dustin&#39;s table.  It was a rabbit-man.  Dustin could see he had an unusually small cock.  &quot;This is perfect!&quot; thought Dustin.  &quot;I want to start small, after all.  Don&#39;t want to get in over my head.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello there!&quot; the rabbit man said.  &quot;I couldn&#39;t help but overhear, Mr. Ashauna, sir, that you might be interested in some company this morning?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s true,&quot; replied Dustin.  &quot;But I must admit I&#39;ve never done this before.  I do think you look fantastic, though.  I wouldn&#39;t mind getting to know you better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, deary me!&quot; said the rabbit man happily.  &quot;I am a lucky man today indeed!  My name is Lawrence!  I usually have such trouble finding a good man because I&#39;m a bit undersized, as you can see!  But I daresay there&#39;s always a few such as yourself who enjoy a smaller man, much to my delight!  Fret not about this being your inaugoratory experience, however!  We&#39;ve all been there, to be sure your morphed body knows what to do, better than any human virgin, no doubt!&quot;  The rabbit man spoke quickly and excitedly.  Dustin could barely keep up.<br />
<br />
For the next few minutes, Dustin and Lawrence spoke and got to know each other a bit.  It wasn&#39;t long before Dustin began accepting Ashauna as his own name.  He decided he liked it, and it was good to have an alias while in  morph.  Before long, Lawrence said &quot;Well Ashauna, sir, shall we retire to the back rooms?  I indubitably wish to enjoy your company all the more intimately!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin was very nervous, but his body continued to respond to the beautiful man before him, and it was now or never.  &quot;Okay,&quot; Dustin said.  &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two headed through the side door into the back hall.  They selected a vacant room and went inside.  The room was decorated simply, with a thick, soft rug, enormous bed, and several soft couches and love seats.  Cabinets along the walls held all manner of items to help spice up one&#39;s experience.  &quot;Ashauna&quot; and Lawrence, had no need of them, however.  They each stripped of their clothes, their dicks standing at attention.<br />
<br />
Ashauna the sheep-man and Lawrence the rabbit-man embraced and began making out.  As they did their dicks touched.  They rubbed up and down against each other as they made out.  Ashauna&#39;s dick glistened with pre-cum, and Lawrence noticed.  &quot;Please sit, my lover, and let good old Lawrence help you with that!&quot; said the rabbit man.<br />
<br />
Ashauna sat in the love seat, cock standing tall.  Lawrence reached and began stroking it with his soft hands.  Ashauna moaned with delight.  Lawrence was an expert, and brought Ashauna enormous pleasure in his throbbing dick.  After a few moments, Ashauna couldn&#39;t take it any longer, and he came violently, spraying cum all over himself and Lawrence.  The two set about licking it up, enjoying the salty taste.<br />
<br />
Ashauna then picked up Lawrence, who was very light, and brought him to the bed.  Lawrence laid back and Ashauna started licking and suckling on Lawrence&#39;s small cock.  It sprang to life quickly.  Ashauna&#39;s longer snout and the small size of the member made it easy for him to take the entire shaft into his mouth.  He sucked and licked and Lawrence cooed with pleasure.  Not long after Lawrence came as well, shooting warm cum into the back of Ashauna&#39;s throat.  Ashauna squeezed and sucked out every last drop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn&#39;t save any for Lawrence, you naughty boy!&quot; said the rabbit man, who jumped on top of Ashauna, puching him back onto his back.  Lawrence then got to work sucking Ashauna&#39;s cock.  Despite having cum not long before, the sheep cock rose to life once again, as did Lawrence&#39;s small member as he got into it.  Ashauna found himself grinding into it and with eager thrusts began fucking Lawrence&#39;s face.  Lawrence was captured by bliss, and as Ashauna was starting to near climax, the rabbit man pulled his face off Ashauna&#39;s dick.<br />
<br />
Ashauna looked at the rabbit man quizzically, but realization came quickly as Lawrence turned around, pointing his ass at Ashauna.  &quot;Fuck me, sir!  Take me, my darling Ashauna!  I want to feel you in my ass, I beg you!&quot;  Ashauna found himself enraptured by the cute rabbit man.  He leaned his snout to the waiting asshole and began licking it vigorously.  Lawrence moaned.  Ashauna stuck his long tongue deep into the rabbit-man&#39;s ass as far as it would go and slurped it around, enjoying the taste immensely.  The rabbit-man&#39;s tiny cock was throbbing to the point of bursting.<br />
<br />
Then Ashauna pushed his hard sheep-cock into Lawrence&#39;s waiting asshole.  He thrust once, and the tight ass enveloped his cock in unimaginable pleasure.  Lawrence shouted in delight, and so did Ashauna.  He thrusted repeatedly, and Lawrence pushed his ass backwards into each thrust.  They built a rhythm and the pleasure of the cock and ass grew to a climax.  Ashauna, at last, couldn&#39;t hold out any longer.  His cock stuffing the rabbit-man&#39;s ass burst forth like a fire hydrant, shooting streams of cum deep inside.  At the same time, Lawrence came as well, spraying more cum than one would ever think could come from such a small cock.  Puddles of cum formed on the bed as Lawrence&#39;s dick kept pulsing, and as Ashauna finally withdrew from the rabbit-man, cum seeped out from his asshole.<br />
<br />
The two collapsed into the puddles of come, exhilarated and exhausted.  They fed each other cum and rubbed it all over each other.  Their cocks were spent for the moment, however, and though they enjoyed the sensuality of the cum bath, the amorous activities ended as they both fell asleep in their cum-sodden embrace.</p>
