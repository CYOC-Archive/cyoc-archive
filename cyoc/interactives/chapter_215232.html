<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In many ways, Rachel felt strangely relieved by the answers that she&#39;d gotten from Julia and Linus. There were some questions that she had on how they had knowledge of Leslie&#39;s actions, even if they didn&#39;t name Leslie by name. She&#39;d given the short version of how she became a werecat to Isabelle on the way over, but not many people in Moon Lake had all that information. Most of them were in the city government and the college&#39;s administration and teaching staff, largely to make sure that Rachel wouldn&#39;t get too much trouble from them. Beyond that, about the only ones that knew the full story were those that would be working with her on a regular basis. Thus, there weren&#39;t that many that knew about it. Though, she figured that Isabelle had shared the short version with not just her mother but with the rest of the pride, and that had allowed for the time Rachel had had to talk with Jessica in the house, so Rachel didn&#39;t dwell on it too much.<br />
<br />
Particularly as those answers from Linus and Julia, particularly regarding whether or not she might find herself becoming like Leslie, too eager for something that she would act without thinking or caring, put Rachel at ease. They seemed to provide some sense of comfort that things would be okay in the long run and that she would remain who she was, and the thought of that made her smile a bit as she felt some of that relief. It felt nice and some of that showed. It soon earned a hand on the back of Rachel&#39;s shoulder, and she looked over her shoulder to see Angela there. As she turned her head, she noted Isabelle waling over to sit with her girlfriend, Sarah.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry... I didn&#39;t mean to interrupt your meeting&#39;s schedule,&quot; Rachel found herself apologizing.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s no need to apologize,&quot; Angela gave a warm smile, that wasn&#39;t too different from ones that Rachel remembered her own mother giving her or her own sisters when they&#39;d done something well, &quot;a lot of our meetings are often just social get togethers and things like that. We share stories on what&#39;s gone on and catch up on some things that might be going on in town. In a way, every were group operates like some book or social clubs do outside Moon Lake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some of us are also in some book clubs here as well,&quot; Sadie chimed in.<br />
<br />
&quot;But not political...?&quot; Rachel wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god no,&quot; Angela answered, &quot;the town&#39;s government operates like any town government would. We elect representatives based on the part of town were in to serve on a city council and we elect a mayor and so on. Sometimes, even Moon Lake normals win elections as well, so being a were isn&#39;t required. And that&#39;s easier for everyone than just having every pride or pack be part of the town&#39;s &quot;government.&quot; That&#39;d make things way too confusing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not to mention that some, like the weretigers, wereleopards, werepumas, and werebears tend to be more solitary than most other weres,&quot; Maggie added, &quot;that&#39;s why all prides, packs, and even the werefoxes and their skulk are more of a social club than anything else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Rachel said slowly, figuring a lot of that made sense.<br />
<br />
&quot;And anyway, a lot of this meeting is just a hello to you and to provide some help in any and all ways that we can,&quot; Angela spoke, &quot;and if you didn&#39;t want to come... it would have been discussing some ways that we could offer help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see... well, I&#39;m not quite ready to JOIN a pride yet,&quot; Rachel spoke, &quot;though... it has been nice to meet all of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we feel the same way about meeting you,&quot; Martha said from her seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;And in the meantime, we can get started with something to eat,&quot; Angela offered, &quot;why don&#39;t you sit down with Linus and Julia, and I&#39;ll set to delivering everyone&#39;s food. We have a wide variety provided.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel looked to the main table, and the longest one that was there. Isabelle had sat down on the opposite side of the table with Sarah to her left and her mother, Martha, on the other side of Sarah. There was then the long row of serving dishes that had the various dishes that were there, and the food that Rachel could smell when she first came out. She also noted that some of the serving dishes that they had were different with one looking like it had a floral print painted onto the sides, while another looked more like the dish had raised sections that looked like a rabbit. It let Rachel guess that Angela wasn&#39;t the only one to cook things for this meeting.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that sounds good,&quot; Rachel gave a small smile, &quot;and thank you. I&#39;ll let your pride members choose first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Angela nodded and she went about then turning to the other pride members to get things started and doing so by offering out food and drinks. Rachel then took another step to the smaller picnic table where Julia and Linus were sitting when she felt a small hand catch her tail. She stopped and looked over her shoulder to see that it was Jessica.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I sit with you?&quot; Jessica asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;If it&#39;s okay with your mom... I suppose I don&#39;t mind,&quot; Rachel answered slowly, though a bit lost as to why Jessica would have such interest in her. Perhaps it was because Rachel was new to Moon Lake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I, mom?&quot; Jessica asked to her mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, dear,&quot; Angela spoke, &quot;just be polite.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, mommy,&quot; Jessica nodded and she then walked alongside Rachel and took Rachel&#39;s hand, &quot;you&#39;re pretty... and you&#39;ll be safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel gave an understanding smile to that. She still had her worries over things that related to what Leslie did to her, but from the answers she&#39;d gotten so far, and even from the conversations with Isabelle on the way over and with Jessica in the house, it was like a lot of those worries were lessened. The welcome felt good in a way, and Rachel found it a lot easier to give Jessica a small smile and sit down. She quietly watched as Angela then went from table to table and bring food from the main table to the others. The food often varied. The side dishes were often the same, but there was a bit of everything that could picked from for the main dish. There was some beef, pork, chicken, and fish, and Angela checked with each person before putting the dishes onto plastic plates and then serving them to each person, like a proper hostess.<br />
<br />
&quot;And will you want your favorite, Jessica?&quot; Angela asked as she got to the table Rachel was at.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, mom,&quot; Jessica said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll have some of the beef, that smells good,&quot; Linus added his request.<br />
<br />
&quot;It all smells good,&quot; Julia chuckled, &quot;but I&#39;ll go with the chicken.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel sat quietly while looking on and noting that Angela had not yet gone back to the main table.<br />
<br />
&quot;It all smells good... could I start with some pork and then get a second helping from the fish?&quot; Rachel asked, &quot;and I don&#39;t mind on the side dish.&quot;<br />
<br />
Angela chuckled, &quot;everything should be fine. Everything will be right up, and then we can get going.&quot;</p>
