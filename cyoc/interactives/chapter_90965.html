<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Anna stepped outside, letting the warm sunlight slide over her tight trim belly and athletic arms, I made two more wishes.<br />
First, I wished Anna wouldn&#39;t notice our mother sleeping peacefully at the bottom of the pool.<br />
Second, I wished Anna would think anything I did for the next two hours would seem perfectly normal.<br />
<br />
I felt power rushing from my ring as I completed my wishes, and I knew what I asked would be done. With that, I stepped up beside my sister, reached out, and slipped one arm around her waist.<br />
We stood looking out over the pool and our remarkable view. After a moment, Anna reached out her own arm and hooked it around my waist, too.<br />
Anna was a few years my senior, but a girl, so we were almost exactly the same height. We stood there, shoulder to shoulder, holding each other like boyfriend and girlfriend. Her hand on my body almost (ALMOST) felt better than my hand on her naked skin.<br />
<br />
We stood that way for several moments. &quot;What do you think, Sis,&quot; I asked.<br />
&quot;This is posh,&quot; she said, slightly breathless. &quot;You say Mom just inherited this place?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yep, just like that. I mostly run the house, though. Mom&#39;s, um, going through some personal changes right now.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, she&#39;s raised two kids alone while working. She&#39;s earned the right to her own... um...&quot;<br />
&quot;Her own pleasures,&quot; I finished for her. &quot;She certainly has, and I&#39;m making sure she&#39;s having all the pleasure she can stand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you are.&quot; Anna patted me on the hip, then extricated herself from my grasp and strode toward the edge of the pool. I took the opportunity to watch her ass moving smoothly beneath her yoga pants.<br />
<br />
Anna stuck her toes in the water. Right under her, Mom lay snoozing, occasional bubbles rising from her lips. Anna didn&#39;t notice.<br />
<br />
Again, I walked up to my sister. This time I stopped behind her. I wrapped both arms around her waist and hugged her back into my body. Her ass was pressed right into my crotch, her shoulder blades into my pecs.<br />
Just as I wished, Anna completely failed to think anything unusual about my raging erection pulsing against her butt cheeks, my breath becoming ragged with arousal, or my arms around her, trembling with anticipation.<br />
<br />
&quot;How was your flight?&quot; I asked. &quot;Anything unusual?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, nothing much. I had a talky Mormon try to evangelize me, but I put my ear buds in and tuned him out.&quot;<br />
&quot;Hell with him,&quot; I said. &quot;We don&#39;t need his kind of religion in this house.&quot;<br />
&quot;Certainly not.&quot; As I hugged my sister&#39;s body into mine, she leaned back, seeming to take unconscious pleasure in the touch.<br />
<br />
I grabbed Anna by the hips and turned her around, then hugged her back into me again. Now my sister&#39;s full, firm breasts were pressed into my chest, and nothing stood between my penetrating her pussy but our trousers.<br />
She seemed unsure at first what to do with her arms. After a moment she reached up and draped them around my neck. Our lips were just inches apart. Of course, this seemed perfectly normal to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how long ago did you and Mom move into this place?&quot; Anna asked.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure. It doesn&#39;t feel like very long,&quot; I said.<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve certainly made yourself at home.&quot;<br />
<br />
I leaned in so close to my sister&#39;s face that when I talked, my lips brushed hers.<br />
&quot;Anna,&quot; I said. &quot;Can I tell you a secret?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; she replied.<br />
&quot;I had sex with Mom.&quot;<br />
Anna smiled, and ruffled my hair with her long fingers. &quot;We all thought you would, eventually.&quot;<br />
<br />
This took me by surprise. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, come on,&quot; Anna said with a playful laugh. &quot;You two are completely devoted to each other. And a handsome young fella like you who&#39;s never even had a girlfriend? People thought you and Mom were made for each other.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah. I hope you make her happy. She deserves some happiness in her life, with what she&#39;s been through.&quot;<br />
<br />
I paused. I knew I&#39;d wished Anna to think everything I said was normal, but there was a difference between &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;nonchalant.&quot;<br />
I decided to push things. &quot;I think I may have made her pregnant.&quot;<br />
Anna dropped one hand down and slapped me on the butt. &quot;Good for you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Would you like it if you had a sister or brother who was also your niece or nephew?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, I don&#39;t think what I like matters much. But sharing a baby would be good for the two of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded for a moment, then decided to press my advantage.<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like to have sex with you, too, Anna,&quot; I said, as I slid my hands up and began unclasping her sports bra.<br />
&quot;Well, duh,&quot; she replied, grinning, as she buckled her knees and ground her body against mine seductively. &quot;Who wouldn&#39;t?&quot;<br />
I completely unhooked her bra, then lifted her arms to slide it off her; I tossed it behind her, into the pool. She didn&#39;t seem to notice.<br />
&quot;Would you like to have sex with me, Anna?&quot;<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her clipped one-word answer took me by surprise.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re okay with your mother and brother having sex, but you&#39;re not okay having sex with your own brother?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, well, I&#39;d be OKAY with it,&quot; she said, returning her arms to draping around my shoulder. &quot;But you asked if I&#39;d like to, which is completely different.&quot;<br />
&quot;How so?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the brother-sister thing, I guess other people have a problem with that. Not me.&quot;<br />
She frowned slightly, her forehead creasing as if a thought had crossed her mind. &quot;I don&#39;t know why.&quot;<br />
But just as quickly, the frown was gone again, replaced by her familiar playful smile.<br />
&quot;Anyway, it&#39;s not the incest that bothers me. It&#39;s that I prefer guys at my own level. Guys my own age or older. You&#39;re a cute kid, Jake but that&#39;s all you are. A kid.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re just not my type.&quot;<br />
<br />
Through all this, she made no effort to break my embrace. My sister was now topless in my arms, and perfectly okay with that.<br />
And I realized what I had done. I&#39;d wished for Anna to find everything I did *normal.* I&#39;d never wished for her to find any of it *desirable.*<br />
<br />
&quot;So let me put it this way,&quot; I said. &quot;If I bent you backward right here poolside and took you, you&#39;d be okay with that.&quot;<br />
&quot;I suppose so,&quot; Anna replied.<br />
&quot;You&#39;d consent to having sex with me, your own brother, right now, if I took the initiative.&quot;<br />
My sister shrugged. &quot;I guess so.&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;d just never initiate it.&quot;<br />
Anna tapped me playfully on the nose. &quot;There you go, baby brother. You&#39;re getting it.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded. Then I looked her in the eyes.<br />
My sister&#39;s eyes were vibrant emerald green. She had a fleck of gold in the lower outside corner of her left eye.<br />
I lightly brushed my lips against hers. She smiled.<br />
<br />
Taking my time felt so good. The torture was so lovely.<br />
<br />
I cupped one hand over my sister&#39;s naked breast. I gently squeezed and massaged. Her nipple got hard under my hand.<br />
&quot;Does my touch feel good to you, Anna?&quot;<br />
&quot;Of course it does. Why wouldn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Even though I&#39;m your brother? Even though this is incest?&quot;<br />
&quot;I love a man&#39;s touch, Jake. You may be my jerky baby brother, but you&#39;re still a man.&quot;<br />
<br />
I took a moment to suck the tip of Anna&#39;s nose, then dropped my forehead so it rested against hers.<br />
&quot;I want to have sex with you, Anna. I want to break all the rules and have sex with my own sister.&quot;<br />
&quot;Just say the word, Jake.&quot;<br />
&quot;I would like to have a baby with you, Anna.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;d let me make love to you bareback, Anna? You&#39;d let me make a baby with you?&quot;<br />
My sister shrugged. &quot;Hey, sometimes that happens.&quot;<br />
&quot;Do you think you could ever fall in love with me, Anna?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m not right now, but never say never.&quot;<br />
<br />
I grasped my sister to myself and eased her down onto the pavement next to the pool.<br />
I wanted to take her right now. But stretching it out felt so good, too.<br />
Guess I had a choice to make.</p>
