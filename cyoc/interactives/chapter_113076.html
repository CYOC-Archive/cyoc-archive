<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In a small city named Fort Bridgewater, which coincidentally was secretly home to many supernatural events in its two-hundred year history,  The Great Change affected the residents there just as it had throughout the rest of the world. In this tale, we will be looking at how the planet-wide transformation changed the lives of one family, specifically the oldest boy of the family, Bill.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Bill Hanson and his best friend Matt Young were chatting among themselves in the back of class, not paying attention to the history lecture by their boring old teacher Ms. Nessabell. Both boys were pretty much average in every way. Neither were academically gifted, but they weren&#39;t idiots either. Neither were jocks, but both could run pretty far whenever the school bully, Rob Bolstrum, was after them. Both were handsome enough young lads, but neither had girlfriends. Matt used to have one, Gloria Xanthopoulos, until the lovely couple had broken up in tears the week before. Gloria sat a couple of rows up, not really paying attention to Ms. Nessabell&#39;s ranting about ancient Macedonia either. Matt saw her twirling her long, black hair with her finger while drawing pictures in her notebook. Matt  had taken the breakup particularly hard, but he couldn&#39;t bring himself to speak to her. There was a letter on his desk right now that he had written to Gloria sitting on his desk, begging her to take him back. He could make a paper airplane of it right now and send it her way, but not without the teacher noticing.<br />
<br />
Bill, meanwhile, was lusting after another girl, Alexandra Xiang-Bell. She was sitting adjacent to Gloria, though they weren&#39;t friends. Bill daydreamed about asking her out on a date. Alex was a drop dead gorgeous Chinese-American girl with a fantastic figure and probably the biggest boobs of any girl in school, and was the head cheerleader of the school&#39;s cheerleader team to boot. Bill knew that he had zero shot with her, but he daydreamed about it anyway. About sweeping the tall girl off her feet at some dance, and making out with her in some hot rod car he could never afford. But she only went out with football jocks or people from her social circle, which Bill and Matt(And Gloria, for that matter) were decidedly not a part of. <br />
<br />
&quot;Can you imagine what I&#39;d have to do to get her attention?&quot; asked Bill to Matt, both sweaty since it was still August. <br />
<br />
Before Matt could answer, Jean Doudna&#39;s wish from a city far away from Fort Bridgewater came to pass, and everyone began transforming.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
In the chaos of the transformation, barely anyone could pay attention to other people&#39;s bodily changes as they themselves shifted and morphed like so much water. The spell seemed to pin everyone to their seats as well. All either boy could notice was a bizarre, unearthly haze that indicated the presence of magic. When it was all over, Bill looked down at himself...or rather, herself, as the newly formed girl could no longer even refer to herself with male pronouns.<br />
<br />
The first thing that she had noticed was that her boobs were huge, even bigger than Alexandra&#39;s.  The second was that her clothing had shifted. Bill had been wearing a black t-shirt and blue jeans. Now, she was wearing a low cut, sky blue halter top and a white skater skirt. She noticed her nipples poking through her top, which indicated that she wasn&#39;t wearing a bra. Her feet, previously adorned with sneakers, now had strappy white sandals with a five inch heel adorned to them. As Bill stared in disbelief, her now super long and full bodied, straw blonde hair got in her face. She stood up, noticing once more, and with an eyeroll, that she had shrunk several inches. Poor Bill couldn&#39;t be any taller than 5&#39;2 now, if that. She turned around to look for her friend, and received a shock. <br />
<br />
Standing in Matt&#39;s place was an identical copy of Gloria Xanthopoulos. Bill, in a panic, looked around for Gloria and still saw Matt&#39;s ex-girlfriend in her seat, stunned, right next to an equally stunned Alex. The rest of the class, meanwhile, had all transformed like Bill himself into super hot teenage girls in the case of all the boys, or yet more attractive versions of themselves in case of the girls. Bill even noticed the overweight, middle-aged Ms. Nessabell was now cuter than any actress that he saw on television or movies. But none of this compared to the weirdness of seeing Matt, his best friend, look back at him with Gloria&#39;s doe eyes, Gloria&#39;s eye shadow adorned face, surrounded by her luxurious hair.<br />
<br />
Bill than noticed that the fire drill was ringing.</p>
