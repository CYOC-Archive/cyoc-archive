<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff took a moment to consider his options, if he became twins with his Dad as an adult, he wouldn't really be able to spend time with him that much as most adult twins that he knew lived separate lives like any adult siblings, so immediately being an adult twin with his father was out of the question. <br />
<br />
Making John his own age was a fine idea, but Jeff recalled that the quiet distance that twins he knew in his school had and thought better of it.<br />
<br />
Jeff immediately ruled out joining John at age three, because he didn't want to live through arguing over toys and the trials and tribulations of being a toddler once again (potty training especially wasn't something to &quot;look forward to&quot;). Looking after one as a teenager was fine, but being one again, no thanks.<br />
<br />
No there only seemed one age group where one could really benefit and enjoy having a twin, and that was being a prepubescent and post-toddler kid. Young enough to want the playmate and confidant, but old enough to know that he's more a benefit than a curse. So Jeff selected for their respective ages to &quot;average out&quot; to nine years old. He then adjusted the transformation to take place over the course of an hour like the previous transformation so that Jeff could once again marvel at the changes being made to his father-turned brother as well as himself. He kept the transformation length as lasting a week, figuring that if he liked it that much he could always make it last longer later. He also made it that the world would adapt to the changes made, so that his family wouldn't freak out at the prospect of their age change and that John would continue to adjust mentally and emotionally along with the physical changes, Jeff also made sure to click that he'd maintain an awareness of what was going on. Double checking his selections, Jeff pressed enter and a rush of energy seemed to sweep through Jeff.<br />
<br />
'Damn, if this is what it feels like to transform, I've gotta try this out more often!' thought Jeff, and he got up from the computer to go back into the Living Room so he could compare and contrast his transformation's with John's. When he came back into the Living Room he arrived to find that John had changed the channel from football to Nick Junior, where Blues Clues was playing. John looked on enraptured by the show. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm back and ready to spend some time with you, little bro,&quot; casually mentioned Jeff with a playful tussle of John's hair, which did not disturb how transfixed John had become with Blue's Clues.<br />
<br />
John was still three years old and his body was very small with baby fat on his arms and legs. His stomach protruded slightly in a baby gut, and there was a little chubbiness to his face. His hair was incredibly short and was completely wispy. His shirt was a baby blue T with a picture of Blue’s Clue on it. His shorts were filled up around his around his flabby toddler legs. It was obvious that he still was wearing training pants. That was because he was still potty-trained back when he was three and stopped doing that when he was four. He wore no shoes but instead had small white anklet socks. John was also clutching his soft dark blue toddler blanket. To think that in a mere hour he'd be six years older, Jeff could hardly wait.<br />
<br />
It was also in these few moments that Jeff took stock of himself as a sixteen year old for the &quot;last time&quot; so to speak. He wore white basketball sneakers with no-show socks. He had a pair of blue jeans on and a plain red t-shirt with a plain flanel shirt on over it. His hair was slightly unruly and cut a little shaggy, but nothing so long it got in his eyes or covered his ears. He was athletically lean, but by no means well or under developed in terms of musculature. Over all he was pretty average. <br />
<br />
For the first ten minutes or so Jeff hardly noticed a difference, but soon he began to feel rather funny as he &quot;regressed&quot; down to fifteen. His clothes remained unchanged, but he could feel what little muscles he had losing their definition as he became more &quot;lean&quot; than athletic--he also could feel that he had lost a few inches in height though that was only noticeable from the slightly altered perspective he had now in viewing the TV. Jeff pondered what TV show they would settle on watching as twins, or if they would break out the Playstation for them to play once they had nearly averaged out.<br />
<br />
John's transformation from three to four was more dramatic. The first thing to note was that he gained a few inches in height and some of the baby fat evened itself out to more proportionate levels as he did. His clothes as well largely remained unchanged, though Jeff could tell that John's underwear lost its bulk and crinkle as he went from &quot;training pants&quot; to &quot;big boy briefs&quot;, thus causing his shorts to become a little looser.<br />
<br />
Reality for the large part shifted slightly but it was hardly noticeable. Jeff knew however he didn't have a driver's permit in this reality and beyond that very little was different, and it especially didn't change the relationship between John and Jeff. John had put down the toddler blanket--though it still remained in arm's reach and had started to be able to answer the pauses in the show more easily and readily Jeff noticed than he had when he was three.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want to play something John?&quot; asked Jeff, feeling bored of watching the show.<br />
<br />
&quot;After Blue's Clues&quot; insisted John, and Jeff let him go. <br />
<br />
Around ten minutes later Jeff felt the next wave of the transformation hitting him once again. This time Jeff felt himself losing a few more inches in height, though, and he though he was probably closer to 5'3&quot; than his starting height of 5'11&quot;. His clothes remained the same, though now adjusted to fit his smaller body and Jeff now remembered that he was a freshman.<br />
<br />
John's transformation however still was more dramatic. His body grew consistently bigger and there was now only a little baby fat on his arms and legs. His face, while still cute, was larger with puffy cheeks and a small button nose that wasn't so upturned as it had been as a toddler. His hair was slightly longer and started to thicken. His clothes changed to match his age and looked less for toddlers and more like what a kindergartner would wear on his first day of kindergarten. His shirt grew bright red and had a picture of Bob the Builder on it. The shorts grew longer into a small pair of jeans, and he suddenly acquired shoes which were simple plain Nikes while his socks grew into bigger anklet shocks. His emptied tipi cup transformed into a plain empty cup once again. John now looked less interested in Blues Clues.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not this show! This is for babies!&quot; whined John, and Jeff chuckled and obliged him switching to PBS which had Sesame Street on, and this seemed to be more appropriate to John.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, you're the bestest older brother ever! Sissy would never let me watch Sesame Street, she'd just change it to a dumb girl's show.&quot; added John.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, she's a bit annoying, isn't she?&quot; added Jeff, whose fourteen year old memories recalled how annoying their ten year-old sister had been to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;The worst&quot; said John, and there the conversation ended--which was more than they'd had at earlier ages, Jeff thought.<br />
<br />
Another ten minutes brought drastic changes for the first time to Jeff as he hit thirteen and had the largest &quot;shrink spurt&quot; of his life as he shrank to a few inches below five feet tall, his feet now feeling slightly raised from the floor for the first time and the sofa feeling larger than he remembered. Jeff no longer was in High School, but now was a middle schooler, and stuck in the midst of puberty as Jeff thought if he spoke his voice would crack. His clothes changed as the plaid flannel shirt vanished and a simple red t-shirt was all that he was wearing--only instead of being plain it now shifted to having the numbers of his favorite player for his favorite football team, and he felt printing on the back be added to reflect this change further. His basketball shoes became regular sneakers, and his hair became slightly shorter and less of a mess. Overall he was a very skinny kid with larger hands, feet, and head than normal and had returned to that awkward ugly duckling stage of puberty.<br />
<br />
John's transformation for the first time was less dramatic than the previous ones, he simply grew a bit larger and his clothes did as well--though Jeff noticed that John's shoes had acquired lights in their heels. His toddler blanket vanished.<br />
<br />
A few minutes passed by and Jeff felt another wave hit him as he felt himself leave puberty all together as he hit age twelve. His feet now dangled a few inches more off the floor, and he felt swallowed by the couch, causing him to sit forward more in his seat. His clothes shrank with him, though largely remained unchanged.<br />
<br />
John's transformation into a seven year old caused another mini growth-spurt to occur, and the design on his shirt to change to look like the front of the Red Ranger's uniform from Power Rangers. John once again complained about the channel, this time reaching for the remote instead of simply expecting Jeff to change it, but Jeff being only slightly older managed to swipe it away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I was gonna change the channel!&quot; whined John<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it my fault that you're just too slow?&quot; teased Jeff<br />
<br />
&quot;Just choose something good&quot; was John's concession, John may have been bigger, but Jeff still was larger yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya know, why don't we play a game?&quot; suggested Jeff, remembering his earlier plan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah! But I get to choose which one!&quot; called John<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; conceded Jeff.<br />
<br />
And with that Jeff changed the channel to the Auxiliary channel and they pulled out the Playstation system they had. They eventually settled on the Simpson's racing game and started up the game, just as Jeff felt their ages grow even closer. Now, Jeff felt even closer to his brother than he had in earlier ages, considering him an annoying, but still occasionally fun pal to have around. The rest of the transformation went by largely unnoticed as the two brothers became absorbed in the game. They eventually evened out in height and age until by the end of the hour they had both become twin nine year old brothers. Jeff was already having a lot of fun with John and was looking forward to all the fun he could have with him in the coming days.</p>
