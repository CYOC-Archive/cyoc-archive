<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Days before Ryan and Jason was captured, two guys in another part of Oregon was called by one of the Genetilabs Reasearch, a somewhat top secret, but public human conversion company for people who doesn&#39;t have jobs and would have a choice of turning into a human garbage dump, telling about missing people and they think a Genetilab facility in a small town in Oregon. &quot;Okay, I see. We&#39;ll look at it in the matter. Thank you.&quot; Kevin says as Kayne came out from the bathroom finished showering and drying his dark brown long hair w/ a towel wrapped around his waist to not be naked. &quot;Who was that?&quot; Kayne asked as he walks to the closet, passing by Kevin&#39;s office/bedroom desk.<br />
&quot;What the hell were you doing in my bathroom, Kayne?!&quot; he asks unamused.<br />
&quot;Your bathroom is nice! You know the answer already Kev.&quot; Kayne replies as he hums and goes into the closet getting his clothes and a black zentai suit. Kevin puts it aside and tells Kayne.<br />
&quot;It was Genetilabs Research&#39;s CEO,&quot; he continues as he gestures a zentai drone with a smirk to give the papers that were faxed to him by Genetilabs to Kayne in the closet as he puts on the suit first and the clothes leaving the hood down underneath his shirt. Kayne then recoils back as he was startled by a blue zentai drone, &quot;Jesus, Kevin! Let me know for sending Steve to me with the paper!&quot; Kayne then grabs the paper that shows the missing people and a report of increase of employees of human modified garbage bins.<br />
<br />
He looks through them and tells Steve the drone that he can go back to his position for the next few hours as the drone acknowledges the order and leaves.<br />
&quot;Huh, I was hearing about this in the news for awhile now. Police are having a hard time finding out the missing people?&quot;<br />
Kevin pulls out a lighter and a cigarette. He then puts the it in the mouth and lights the end of the cigar, and inhales the nicotine and tobacco and other drug chemicals inside the cigar about a second and puffs out smoke and goes through the files in his computer. &quot;Yeah, there were investigations going on there in Michel, Oregon&#39;s Genetilabs facility, but the case was dismissed as many investigators went missing. Even the best ones they have in Oregon.&quot; Kayne went to Kevin&#39;s desk and puts down the papers on his desk. &quot;He says that there is something suspicious going on there and are probably doing illegal experimentation that he is unaware of and has something to do with the people&#39;s disappearance along with the sudden increase of human garbage bin jobs.&quot; Kevin says as he gives him his camera and 9mm pistol. &quot;And you want me to go in there and find out what the hell is going on and make it out alive, the usual huh?&quot; Kayne asks with a smug. Kevin nods, &quot;I&#39;ve made arrangements with my friend there for your stay and supply you with stuff you need to make it in and out alive and well.&quot;<br />
&quot;And if there are people I want to try and save?&quot; Kayne cocks a brow. &quot;By all means as long as you get the job done.&quot;<br />
&quot;Fine by me!&quot; He then walks off and out the door without notice, no need to say good bye.<br />
<br />
At the time when Jason and Ryan was about to be kidnapped, and already met with Kevin&#39;s friend, Kayne was walking at the street that Jeff&#39;s family live and saw two guys, Jason and Ryan go inside one of the human garbage bin, that Jeff is and noticed they aren&#39;t coming out as Jeff&#39;s brother came by and stuffed garbage inside him. Kayne wanted to save both Ryan and Jason, but this is his chance to get to the facility and went to an empty house&#39;s backyard and strip off his clothes only leaving his black zentai suit on, and wears a bandoleer belt around his chest holding a series of devices to keep him undercover and not found, and left his stuff in a bush and waited for the garbage truck to track down and out of sight.<br />
<br />
Soon, he reached the facility as the truck went to the back to drop off its load. Kayne then infiltrates through the ventilation and passes through room after room until he reaches the room where Jason and Ryan is at. &quot;I may need help with the unprogrammed one.&quot; the orderly person said with a frown. Kayne then followed the voice despite the suit having no openings, he can see just fine and sees them take Ryan away to another location and Jason as well to lab 23. &quot;Lab 23?&quot; Kayne thinks to himself, he remembers a video of the CEO giving a public video tour about their lab 23 that they all have in their facilities in Japan and in the States and can help (somewhat) people get a job as a human garbage bin. Of course, genetilab is not only for turning people in to living garbage bins, they turn them into other living furniture or objects since and they called these people &quot;inani&quot;. He then finds his way through the ducts to lab 23 and was about to start the experimentation soon.<br />
<br />
As the scientists checks their equipment and other devices to use on Jason, Ryan, still awake and aware sees a duct slowly opening as a man in a zentai clad suit and stares at him as he gestures to not look at him or make a sound. Ryan nods silently as the scientists saw him nod and looked to where he was looking as Kayne quietly closed the duct, and back at him. &quot;Thinking that someone is going to come in and save you?&quot; the scientist ask with a scoff. Ryan shook his head. &quot;Good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once it was clear and no guards around, Kayne came out and stealthily came up at the scientists already starting their experiment on Jason, but were soon interrupted by Kayne as he tosses one of the scientists to the ground unconscious, the other was about to turn his head to find a black gloved hand over his head and bang his head (non killingly) on a table, now unconscious. Once they were knocked out, he went to Ryan, &quot;What happened to your friend?&quot; Kayne asks.<br />
&quot;Reprogrammed, we were just dumpster diving, and then-&quot; Ryan was interrupted as Kayne spoke, &quot;Save it for later, right now, I&#39;m going to get you guys out of here.&quot;<br />
<br />
One of the orderly man flanked by some guards came up to lab 23 wondering what is the hold up and opened the door. He then made a face of anger as he wondered what happened to both Jason and Ryan and what happened to the scientists.<br />
<br />
Where did Kayne take them?<br />
<br />
