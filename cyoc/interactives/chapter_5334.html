<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well anyways, what did she do?  As you can see I can't get her to confess.&quot; Sarah finnally admited in half irritation and half delight as she smiled at your fresh face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry it was nothing big.  I seem to have forgoten why I stopped by anyways,&quot; you lied and gulped.<br />
<br />
You just kind of stood there for awhile on the porch as a tumbleweed passed.  Wait a minute, tumbleweeds shouldn't exist in urban areas.   Then again you didn't know that people could turn each other into animals and let alone know that a park in your own neighborhood existed.  I mean come on what else weird could happen today.  But you supposed it was only a minor surprise, that didn't really catch your attention until you later realized you'd just been standing on a strangers porch, a powerful magical stranger might I say, for about 10 minutes staring at her lucious lips and long red hair and beautiful deep green eyes of Sarah.  The Sarah, you don't know her last name but you wish you did, Sarah.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose I better get going, then.&quot; You say with low tones of despair, not knowing how to make up something to stay.  You always thought yourself uncreative but it must have been the ever so slightly tingling reminder in the back of your head that her sister turned you into a pig not only 9 and a half hours ago.<br />
<br />
But to your surprise the sister didn't seem to mind your uninvited visit and smiled at your words with pity.  &quot;Well, I will be seeing you again.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was like honey on your tounge to hear her say that to you as you quickly stepped back on her porch with a smile and a nod, &quot;Most defeinetly,&quot; you respond quickly.   &quot;I could meet you in the park tommorow at say, five?  I might have more time to,&quot; time to think about what to say considering you were speachless, &quot;Time to get to know you maybe,&quot; You smiled slyly at your words but it didn't seem to dance on her ears as much as you hoped.  She shook her head in acknowledgement and agreed to meet you but she seemed very neutral now to your appearence.  It was probably because you were leaving, and didn't want to make your attraction to her to obvious.  Though, if I had my own saying, it was quite obvious.  I mean you could write, 'You like Sarah Don'tknowherlastname' on your forehead it was so apparently obvious.  But you tried anyways.<br />
<br />
&quot;Five then?&quot; You say once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Five is delightful,&quot; She answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Five...fine...&quot; You smiled and hid your glory.<br />
<br />
She closed her door and you jumped off the steps in glee and gladness.  That was when you had forgoten about the arrangement with Billy and Tom.  But you figured that you could avoid them.  After all, you could simply say that Red wouldn't talk to you either.  And that is exactly what you did.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Billy asked with crossed eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;She wouldn't answer.  Her sister even threatened to call the cops,&quot; you lied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damnit, and all are planning gone to waste,&quot; Tom cursed and slamed his fists into the trees.<br />
<br />
And thats when a thought had entered your head, &quot;You know,  Red is angry with us.  Maybe if we give her a week to sort this out on her own, her anger might deminish.  Maybe if we just left her alone and then later confronted her we could attempt to change her then, when she least expects it?&quot; You said cleverly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what if this potion spoils.&quot; Billy said.<br />
<br />
You were amazed at the question.  It didn't occur to you that potions did spoil.  &quot;Do potions spoil?&quot; You asked.<br />
<br />
Billy frowned and acted very much his age...  &quot;They might...&quot; his voice very hoarse and desperate.  You read this quickly.  He wanted to get it over and done with.  He was scared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Billy, if it does spoil that simply means we'll get caught and she'll curse us again.  And then we'll simply think of something else.  Possibly unmagical.  I mean I am the one that said we shouldn't do this.&quot; You say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you know.  I don't think you went to Red's.  All I've heard is 'I don't want to do this and that' From you all day!&quot; Billy said.  <br />
<br />
Tom rushed to your side and guarded you from Billy. &quot;Now hold on there, Billy.  Why should we doubt him?&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Because we don't know who he is!?  We only met him last night!&quot; Billy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;He was changed into a pig just like me and you.  And he understands how we feel right?&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded suddenly to Tom.  Your feelings toward Sarah rose at that momment to your attention.  Instead of feeling angry at what a little girl has done to you and wanting revenge as your two companions want.  You only want to score with this young girl you've met.  Truly age should become a matter of how people handle things.  You smiled at your relative forgiveness and a thought of betraying Tom and Billy began to unravel.  But you thought better of it.  Truly you did want to see revenge.  But you wondered if such revenge might effect your chances with Sarah.  You thought this ever so carefully and came to a possible solution.</p>
