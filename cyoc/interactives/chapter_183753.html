<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Perhaps it was curiosity or amusement, but Melissa didn&#39;t want to wait until the end of class to cause another change and decided to pull out her phone. As she opened the app up though, she found that it had generated a new sentence already and the timer had already counted down to zero. A little perplexed, and admittedly slightly worried, Melissa brushed it off however.<br />
<br />
Her worry vanished slightly when she saw the details of the sentence, seeing an opportunity within it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jessica&#39;s relationship of mutual hatred with Melissa stems from many factors, with one reason being that Melissa is too plain.&quot;<br />
<br />
Perhaps the thing that intrigued Melissa was a bit of curiosity and desire to be higher up in the hierarchy and how about making Jessica hate her for a different reason. It was obvious Jessica took pride in being the hottest in the school, so if someone was hotter then her, it would truly affect her emotionally and Melissa wanted that. It would affect her though, and there was still the hesitation affect, but things will change.<br />
<br />
Altering Plain to sexy and clicking save, Melissa knew that her body would change but for now, that was find. What she did not expect was that the phone would ultimately decide to change hatred, to friendship and despite her original goal, it now felt stupid to do that to her best friend.<br />
<br />
Looking down to her body, Melissa easily could tell that she had a body to die for which easily put her as one of the two queen&#39;s of the school, the other obviously being her friend Jessica. Two E cup breasts on her chest, held to her with a lacy bra and crop top. Below her waist were very tight fitted jeans that showed off her thighs and outline of her legs. While she usually wore things to accentuate her body, her best friend wore to be colourful and cute. Melissa knew that if the school were to compare herself to Jessica, Jessica would be known as the cute Princess while she would be knows as the sexy queen. When prom came and prom Queen got announced, it would become a war for the title between her and Jess.<br />
<br />
Leaning back in her chair, Melissa let out a soft yawn. Despite before being mildly interested in whoever the psychotic prostitute, whatever her name was, Melissa could only care about going to the mall with her boyfriend Kyle, who was also good friends with Jessica&#39;s boyfriend Chad. Though a realisation hit Melissa that she wasn&#39;t dating anyone before she altered things, but like, she can&#39;t complain when she&#39;s got a boy toy for herself.<br />
<br />
Desperately waiting for the class to end, it felt like it was going on forever. She thought of how to occupy the lesson until she pulled out the app on her phone.<br />
<br />
Pulling out her phone, which was now a much more expensive one in a shiny pink case, she opened up the app and to her pleasure, a sentence generated on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr Fritz is teaching a history lesson on Jackie the Ripper.&quot; Waisting no time as she used her phone one hand, which she was now more able to do due to now spending most of her time on it in this new reality, she decided to mess Mr to Miss before the time ran out on the app.<br />
<br />
Looking up to the teacher, Mr Fritz was now replaced by a slightly overweight woman. Amusing, but Melissa wanted something more then just that to happen.<br />
<br />
Answering to her prayers, the app generated a new sentence on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss Fritz wishes that she didn&#39;t look so fat.&quot; <br />
<br />
Although accurate to how Melissa thought about how this new Fritz was, she decided to help this poor woman out by making her worry about being too ideal and so Melissa replaced Fat to Curvaceous. Looking at the results, a bit of Jealousy rose to her mind as the new Miss Fritz was just as much of a bombshell as Melissa was. Despite Melissa hating this, it did mean that there was someone else to ogle then just her and Jess, which was an issue they both had. Perhaps in due time they could form and friendship with newly sexified Miss Fritz, formerly Mr Fritz.<br />
<br />
Happy to have been amused by the results, a thought did cross Melissa&#39;s mind. Although she remembers her former life, a part of her began thinking that with this app, she was beginning to lose her old self, her old ugly disgusting self that existed at the bottom of the hierarchy.<br />
<br />
Actually, why would she miss it. She was the ideal for everyone so why should she regret becoming this. No way on hell does she want to go back to being a perverted boy who is bullied by all. She doesn&#39;t want to go back to bring a nobody.<br />
<br />
After that inner monologue though, she found the lesson to be over and began walking over to Jessica, passing Mia who now was back to her original goth appearance. <br />
<br />
&quot;Like hey little Princess. Are you coming to the mall after school?&quot; Melissa asked with a new country girl tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know I have Cheer practice today. Of course I can&#39;t. And besides, I don&#39;t want to get in the way of you and Kyle inevitably fucking in the back of the mall.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, that was just one time!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure it was Mel. Sure it was. Though why is it that you don&#39;t come with me to cheer practice. We both know that you&#39;d easily would have become cheer captain if you joined.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They don&#39;t have any uniform in my size. And even if they did, I&#39;d end up flashing the crowd with how tall I am when doing the performance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah. Being 7ft must suck at times. Oh well, I might join you after school tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great. Though before we like gossip anymore then we did. Like what do we have now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gym with that creep of a coach.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like fuck, with have Tanaka now don&#39;t we.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That pervy old geezer who I&#39;m certain has a camera in the girls locker room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we will different like need luck.&quot; Or, as Melissa was thinking at the time, she coukd use the app to mess with him. Which became more of an idea as she walked to gym.</p>
