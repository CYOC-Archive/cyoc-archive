<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andrea arrived at her class, still a bit confused and very horny from before. Putting these thoughts aside, she turned her eyes to Dakota. Dakota’s fake tits were at least an E cup now, and she was wearing a t-shirt with no bra - not to mention Dakota’s athletic rear hugged by a pair of hot pants. Andrea licked her lips. Even through Dakota’s new enhancements, Andrea could still appreciate the natural beauty she’d already enjoyed. Dakota’s blonde, shoulder length hair. Her big green eyes. The many piercings she had in her ears. All of that was still there - Dakota was just “improved” now.<br />
<br />
As Andrea sat there, sneaking glances at Dakota, she felt a headache come on. It seemed to get stronger the more directly she looked at Dakota. Andrea tested this theory… and heard a voice. Not clear enough to make out, but enough to scare her.<br />
<br />
“Am I going insane?” Andrea thought to herself. She looked back at Dakota. Suddenly, her headache went away.<br />
<br />
“I’m so horny. I wish I was home masturbating.”<br />
<br />
Andrea realized that she was reading Dakota’s thoughts - and if she focused hard enough, she could change them.<br />
<br />
After a few seconds, Dakota was now thinking “I’m so horny. I wonder if there are any cute girls around.” Andrea noted that Dakota was now looking around the room - and felt Dakota’s eyes on her tits.<br />
<br />
“Oh, this is so weird. I’m gonna have to check the Chronivac… later. I can do that later.” Andrea thought to herself. For now, she could play around with this.<br />
<br />
Andrea walked out into the hallway, focusing on Dakota the whole time.<br />
<br />
“Class is so boring. I wonder if I should skip…” Dakota was currently thinking.<br />
<br />
That made it easy. “Class is so boring. I’m gonna skip.”<br />
<br />
Soon, Dakota was in the hallway.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Dakota, right?” Andrea said.<br />
<br />
“Oh, uh… yeah… Andrea?” Dakota said, with a smile.<br />
<br />
Andrea read her mind again. “I totally fucked her mom! This is awkward. She’s kinda cute though…”<br />
<br />
Andrea changed it to “I totally fucked her mom! This is kinda hot. She’s hot too…”<br />
<br />
Andrea looked over at Dakota - she was blushing a bit.<br />
<br />
“You’re cute. Wanna make out?” Andrea asked confidently.<br />
<br />
“I… yeah, I’d like that. I think I saw a supply closet over there.” Dakota said, blushing.<br />
<br />
Andrea and Dakota snuck in and started kissing. <br />
<br />
Andrea began feeling Dakota up, relishing her plastic tits. Andrea pulled Dakota’s top up a bit to expose her breasts. Andrea felt Dakota’s hands grip her rear as she enjoyed her first make out session as a girl.<br />
<br />
After about twenty minutes, Dakota finally pulled away.<br />
<br />
“Shit! I have to go. Give me your phone really quick.” Dakota said.<br />
<br />
Dakota punched in her number and then took a quick topless selfie, making it her own contact photo on Andrea’s phone.<br />
<br />
“Call me!” She said, pulling her top back on and rushing out.<br />
<br />
Andrea slumped over. She was so horny, and that felt so good… it felt like all of her concerns were melting away.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, back the coffee shop, Danni and Anna were getting ready to close up. Danni glanced over at Anna. She was cute; she was pale, skinny, relatively short, and had brunette hair. She didn’t have much of an ass, but her C cup breasts looked nice on her otherwise skinny frame.<br />
<br />
Anna had been inhaling plenty of Danni’s pheromones and was flushed, trying to distract herself from her arousal.<br />
<br />
“Hey Anna…” Danni said.<br />
<br />
“Um… uh… yes, Danni?” Anna muttered out.<br />
<br />
“You ok there?” Danni asked.<br />
<br />
“Doing fine! Just fine! Let’s… I wanna finish cleaning up.” Anna said.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later, the shop swept clean, Anna sighed. She didn’t know why she was so horny, she never felt horny at work. There weren’t any cute guys that came in. What was it?<br />
<br />
Anna glanced over and saw Danni. Her huge ass was high in the air as she bent over, trying to grab something.<br />
<br />
“Woah… I… no, I… mmmmm” Anna said, arguing with herself as she bit her lip. She knew Danni liked women, but something was telling her that she didn’t and this was wrong and…<br />
<br />
Danni had gotten up, her big breasts jiggling as she did so. No bra.<br />
<br />
Anna decided to ignore those thoughts.<br />
<br />
“Hey Danni…” Anna said, seductively.<br />
<br />
“Yeah Anna?” Danni asked.<br />
<br />
Anna walked up and kissed Danni.<br />
<br />
Danni happily reciprocated. “Mmm, I didn’t know you were interested in me like that. I would’ve done this before.” She said, pulling Anna’s top off with one hand, the other going into Anna’s pants.<br />
<br />
“I… I didn’t… I don’t…” Anna moaned out, feeling Danni’s fingers enter her soaking wet vagina. Danni kissed Anna, cutting her off.<br />
<br />
Soon, the two were on the ground, Danni licking Anna’s pussy as Anna grabbed the back of Danni’s head. Danni was fingering herself as she did so, knowing Anna’s inexperience and just trying to make her feel good.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Anna orgasmed.<br />
<br />
“DANNI!!” She shouted out as she sprayed cum everywhere. Danni came at the same time, and the two girls crawled up next to each other.<br />
<br />
Anna’s body changed next, her unimpressive rear becoming firmer and more athletic, slightly bigger and more defined. What had been unremarkable was now a nice ass. Her breasts didn’t grow any, but they firmed up and became perfectly shaped. Anna’s body hair thinned out a bit and the hair on her head became an ever so slightly lighter brunette color. Her makeup became much heavier, as Anna used a mostly natural look, and her lips expanded.<br />
<br />
However, the biggest change happened to the coffee shop. What had just been a respectable, normal coffee shop transformed into a bikini coffee shop. Truthfully, much didn’t change - but Danni and Anna’s uniforms now consisted of tight thongs, high heels, aprons - and nothing else.<br />
<br />
Anna moaned.<br />
<br />
“That was great. And your ass looked wonderful today. I just wanted to shove my face in between those beautiful cheeks.” She said, kissing Danni.<br />
<br />
“Mmm, this job is gonna be way more fun now. I didn’t know you felt like this. I’ve been sneaking peeks at your tight ass since you started here.” Danni said.<br />
<br />
Anna blushed a bit. “I’ve been sneaking peeks at you. Your body’s beautiful. I wish I had tits like that.” <br />
<br />
“You’re such a sweetheart! Come on, let’s get dinner. Then we can go back to my place.” Danni said with a wink.<br />
<br />
Anna happily obliged, the two getting dressed in their “outside” clothes.</p>
