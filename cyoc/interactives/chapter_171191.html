<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Viper arrived home a while later, he felt a familiar bulging sensation in his pants. Pulling them down, he discovered a new set of cock and balls growing at a visible pace, quickly reaching the size they should be. Miraculously, his manhood was back. He could still feel the sensations of the separated original if he focused on it, being jerked off by some demon somewhere, but the current flaccid one was more default and important.<br />
<br />
Wondering if this was any more real than the past incident, Viper felt around his massive junk just to be sure it was back to normal. At a certain angle on his taint, he discovered that he could pop off his genitals much as the demons had, and with a hurried attempt at putting it back found he could reattach it without issue. Remembering what Zechariah had done to him, Viper sat on a couch and instinctively started to masturbate.  Quickly rubbing until he was hard, Viper detached his dick and gently eased it into his mouth, sucking greedily. Playing with the balls in front of his face with one hand, he rubbed the blank space between pubic hairs where his cock should have been with the other hand and found it oddly sensitive. Soon, the fantasy situation of sucking his own dick with this much ease overcame reality, and an orgasm ensued, Viper swallowing every drop. It was a particularly large load, perhaps because he had a second set of balls somewhere else sending in extra cum.<br />
<br />
Some playful aftermath licking later, Viper released his manhood and examined it from various angles, noting the strangely rounded smooth skin on the back. There was a strange and convoluted shifting sigil resembling a soft birthmark, faintly extending between roughly where the urethra and spermatic cords should&#39;ve connected to the body. Viper thought it looked oddly like the logo he used for skateboarding videos, and that it was some sort of personal magical brand to identify who a detached part belonged to. He wasn&#39;t sure how he knew what it was, beyond that it was almost certainly magic. Then, more information about that magic hit him. A sixth sense of magical energy connections seemed to overlay various other senses briefly before fading back into the background (particularly, the connection to his original cock and balls in another dimension entirely, currently penetrating the behind of some suitably large demon), but Viper found he could recall and reproject it at will, like some sort of super-senses. The magic-sense itself told him all sorts of random exposition about magic, a flurry of suddenly-known facts stimulating his mind the way it stimulated his body. Chiefly, that he was now a wizard. Specifically, a dick wizard.<br />
<br />
It seemed that the demons taking something from him bestowed a replacement, unlocking his own magical potential to do so...and right now, that magical potential was concentrated in his dick. Using his dick as a magic wand, he could affect the world around him. Masturbation would act as a sort of nudging influence, guiding others&#39; thoughts, telekinetically moving things, or shifting the finer details of proximity gently if he concentrated on doing something. Pissing acted as brute force conjuration, materializing desired things in slightly larger quantity than made sense for the volume, or transmuting and transforming things at will. Precum and cum (or for female-bodied witches, female ejaculate also) were used to cast more complex or specific spells, with pleasure and pain both enhancing them (especially the force of orgasm). Fucking oneself was apparently useful for becoming a more powerful wizard quickly, with the mightiest casting world-rewriting spells and opening supposedly-unbreakable seals simply by plowing themselves repeatedly in ritual circles and such. That&#39;s right, sigil-based spellcasting and such was possible by drawing symbols and imbuing them with energy and meaning (magical or otherwise), though it was hard to actually imbue that energy without special tools or using a magically unleashed part. As a neat bonus, Viper could control his dick (technically, both of his dicks in tandem) remotely, able to change size and shape at will and direct it telekinetically. Since genital-based wands were kind of embarrassing to be using in public, as was spraying fluid all over the place or constantly jacking off, most people who interacted with demons had something like their hands or heads replaced and regrown instead for different casting methods (or at least heavily disguised their implements of choice with surprisingly easy spells that prevented others from seeing what they were doing, or at least caring about it). Even so, apparently magic wasn&#39;t that popular or kept in relative secrecy despite its power. Unlocking potential in new parts was strenuous without demons, prolonged ritual, or excessive self-love, and only the latter was pretty much guaranteed to be safe.<br />
<br />
Awestruck by this sudden transition from powerless to mighty, Viper plugged his genitalia back into place and thought about what to do next. His magic-sense informed him that he had been initially affected by a Theft and Modification rune. It gave the user the ability to steal any body parts they desired, the ability to attach the stolen parts on anyone they liked (including themselves), to directly transfer traits between people, force their regrowth should they have been taken (read: copy body parts and traits), negate issues related to missing traits, and cancel excessive copies. And given that his original cock had plenty of time under the effects of that rune, it had automatically figured it out and relayed it back to the main body. His cock and balls would&#39;ve been grown a replacement in a few hours anyway, as if no replacement is provided a stolen body part would grow back automatically unless a replacement (or lack thereof) was approvingly integrated into the person&#39;s intended identity, or caused in tandem with mundane physical trauma. Apparently, the demons who had stolen his original dick had a habit of doing this to a lot of other people and passing it off as hallucinations or dreams, given that his original cock was currently being frotted against a collection of several other detached dicks, balls touching. Telepathic confusion apparent, an image of Zechariah sticking his tongue out traveled up Viper&#39;s magic-sense, followed by Zech licking Viper&#39;s original cockhead. Fuck, that was good, and apparently they were aware he was a wizard now, but they weren&#39;t going to use his original dick to cast spells or anything (at least for a while). Maybe he&#39;d be seeing them again soon, or maybe not. With his dick grown back and apparently better than ever, Viper felt that he had little reason to interfere with a constant supply of free sex he could tune in to or out of whenever he felt like it. No harm no foul, right?<br />
<br />
The new normal a better normal, Viper thought about what to do next.</p>
