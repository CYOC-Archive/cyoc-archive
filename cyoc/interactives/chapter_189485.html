<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Continuing the outlined story that AlabastorScone and I worked on months ago, this chapter was written by me. Hope you enjoy!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">By the time Seth left, the next class had already come in, changed, and had filtered out, leaving Max alone in the locker room. Since he had lunch next period, he wasn’t in too much of a hurry to rush out, but his stomach loudly growled, reminding him that he hadn’t eaten anything at all that day. He knew he needed to shower, but the lunch lines would probably be really long already, and he wanted to make sure he got what he wanted…He sniffed himself. He supposed he could skip his post-PE shower. Besides, he knew how much Seth loved his natural body scent…<br />
<br />
Max shook his head. *What am I thinking?!” he asked himself. *This day has been so weird…* Yet a huge excitement filled his mind as he thought about the school’s future lacrosse team and his status as team captain. He started to leave the bathroom, but as he passed the mirror, he realized he was still in his underwear with his towel over his shoulder. “Doofus!” he said out loud to himself. “No reason to give everyone a show…” He ran back to his locker and quickly threw on the tight t-shirt and soft athletic pants that he had worn to school that morning. Satisfied that he looked presentable enough, he ran back out of the locker room and down the halls, heading in the direction of the cafeteria.<br />
<br />
As he entered the cafeteria, he groaned at the huge line that waited their turn for food. He didn’t recognize most of the kids at the back. As he took his place at the end of the line, he heard a voice calling his name. He looked ahead and saw two of his teammates, Derek Walker and Bryce Crowthers. They stood about 15 to 20 people ahead of him in line. <br />
<br />
“Yo, Warner! Join us, Bro!” Derek called out. Max smiled at seeing Derek. Memories in the back of his mind reminded him that Derek was bi and really cool with him and Seth. Most of the football team identified as straight, so those who were part of the LGBTQ+ community found camaraderie in their differing orientations. <br />
<br />
Max left his place at the end of the line, feeling a little sheepish about cutting in front of all the people in front of him. Those thoughts quickly left his mind when the smell of the food as they neared the cafeteria workers filled his nostrils. It smelled so good! Max’s stomach rumbled again loudly.<br />
<br />
“Bro, you should have seen Warner!” Bryce was telling Derek. “He was killing it today in PE. He’s going to smoke all of us in lacrosse for the next couple of weeks.”<br />
<br />
“That’s awesome,” Derek said with a cocky smile. “Seth’s lucky to have a total hottie as his boyfriend.” Derek winked at Max, which caused Max’s cheeks to turn red in embarrassment. He felt his dick harden a bit in his boxers.<br />
<br />
“Well, I may not be just showing off in PE,” Max said, trying to get his mind off of his growing erection. “Coach wants me to recruit people for a lacrosse team that the school’s starting in January. You bros interested?”<br />
<br />
“Hell yeah!” Bryce responded, giving Max a fist bump.<br />
<br />
Derek though for a moment. “I don’t know if I’d have time in my schedule to throw in another sport,” he said, shrugging. “But I’ll totally mention it to a few guys on the soccer team. I bet you’d get a lot of interest.”<br />
<br />
“Hey, thanks, man!” Max said with a smile. By this point they had reached the cafeteria stalls and started piling up on food. Max looked around, thinking that he normally would just get vegetables or a salad. He started to walk towards the vegetarian selections when Derek called at him.<br />
<br />
“Hey bro! Don’t tell me you’re skipping out on sloppy joes!” Derek waved at him back to the line where the meat options were.<br />
<br />
Max paused for a moment; his memories torn. Part of him strongly seemed to be insisting that he would NEVER eat something as messy and disgusting as a sloppy joe, but the smell wafting from the lunch trays was heavily enticing. A distant memory of eating sloppy joes with his dad played in the back of his mind. “I was thinking I was just going to get a salad or something,” he responded, a bit unsure.<br />
<br />
“A salad?! Bro, you need to be bulking up for the season, not trying to slim down,” Bryce told him.<br />
<br />
“I’ll bet I can eat my sloppy joe faster than you can, Warner,” Derek said with a wink.<br />
<br />
The challenge made something in Max rise, squashing his doubts about eating the messy meal option before him. “You’re on, Walker!” he replied, smiling at his friend.<br />
<br />
The football players got the rest of their food and drinks and made their way towards a table in the center of the cafeteria. Again, Max felt a bit odd, as if there was something unusual about this. His eyes gazed over to a table in the corner, where something in him told him that he usually sat alone. No, that wasn’t right. He sat here, in the center of attention with his bros. <br />
<br />
The three guys sat down at the table where a few other guys were sitting. He knew all of their names, what sports and positions they played, and even had several memories with them stretching all the way back to middle school. These were his friends; he felt comfortable in this group. <br />
<br />
“You ready, Warner?” Derek asked next to him, hands already on his sloppy joe. He had tucked a napkin into his shirt to keep it from getting messy from anything that fell out of the sandwich. <br />
<br />
Max tucked his own napkin into his shirt and grabbed his sandwich as well, a smile on his face. “Ready!”<br />
<br />
“Go!” Bryce called out. The two boys dug into their sandwiches. For Max, the experience was incredible. It was like biting into a brand-new flavor combination. His tastebuds found the mix of ground beef, ketchup, onions, and other spices exciting, and the sensation caused him to lose his focus for a moment as he was slightly overwhelmed by the taste of the food. The school’s cafeteria actually had pretty decent food, and Max found himself greatly enjoying the sandwich. But his mind was quickly drawn back to the fact that he was in a race, and he was losing.<br />
<br />
He tried to catch up by stuffing more of the sandwich in his face, but his delay at the beginning of the race due to the taste had set him back far enough that Derek was able to finish a couple of bites before him, slamming his fists on the table and whooping loudly in excitement. Max quickly finished moments later, frustrated that he had lost, but in the end, knew that it was just for fun.<br />
<br />
Bryce paused the video he had been recording on his phone. “Bros, that was AWESOME!” he shouted with a smile. “I’m totally uploading this to TikTok.”<br />
<br />
Derek wiped his messy face with the napkin, bumping his elbow with Max. “Nice try, Warner! But you can’t compete with the Meat Master!” <br />
<br />
Max wiped his own face, smiling in response. “Well, I guess I just don’t have as big of a mouth as you.”<br />
<br />
“Hey!” Derek responded. “None of my partners have ever been disappointed!”<br />
<br />
The guys laughed and continued on with their lunch, discussing the upcoming football game, the new members to the team, and the possibilities for the future lacrosse team. Eventually, the bell rang, and they all got up to go to their respective classes. Max dumped his garbage into the trash can and put his tray on the rack to be cleaned, waving goodbye to his teammates as he headed to the library.<br />
<br />
Something in the back of his mind reminded him that he and Seth had a presentation on David Copperfield that they were way behind on, as they were supposed to work on it the night before, but had ended up making out instead…Wait, that wasn’t right. Hadn’t he been doing all of the work because Seth was too lazy to read the book? But he knew he had read the book and felt pretty confident that he could handle any presentation that they would have to do for class. Plus, Seth had said that he would help handle things also. Although Max wasn&#39;t sure that Seth had read the book, he seemed to recall Seth had watched the movie... Max shrugged. He had more important things to worry about. He needed to find more people to recruit for the lacrosse team. He didn’t want to let coach down.<br />
<br />
Max spent the next hour scouring the school, looking for different people to recruit for lacrosse. He talked to some guys in the gym, the lunchroom, and the locker room, and eventually made his way to the weight room. He had intended to just chat it up with a few of the other guys who were lifting weights in their free period, but he soon found himself doing his own sets of reps, burning off some of the calories from the heavy lunch he had eaten. He felt full of energy as he lifted weights with his bros, discussing football and lacrosse. He had just finished a set of dead weight lift reps when he felt arms from behind him start to massage his shoulders. <br />
<br />
Max turned around and found Seth grinning at him from behind. Max instantly got hard at the sight of his boyfriend. “I see you saved yourself for me…” Seth said, pulling Max off of the weight bench. “How about you and I have a little…’chat’ in the bathroom?”<br />
<br />
Seth didn’t wait for Max to reply, pulling him out of the weight room and down the hall towards one of the boys’ restrooms. Max followed, intertwining his fingers with his boyfriend. The two made it into the restroom, and after a quick glance to confirm that they were alone, Seth started making out with Max, pushing him in the direction of the larger handicap stall. The two barely broke their kiss to close and lock the stall before Seth was on Max again, their faces locked together in what was registering to Max as his first makeout session, even though another part of him felt that this was totally normal and routine for the two of them.<br />
<br />
Seth pulled away from Max’s lips, slowly kissing him down his neck, causing Max to groan in response as his dick got even harder, a wet spot starting to appear on his pants through his boxers. Seth lifted Max’s arms and inhaled his strong body odor, his own erection pressing lewdly into Max’s side as he sniffed his boyfriend’s stinky pits.<br />
<br />
“Bae, your smell turns me on so much! Ugh!!! You’re so sexy!” Seth said as he pulled away from Max’s armpits. “But I think I’ve been ignoring Maxie for too long, and you’ve been so patient all day…”<br />
<br />
Seth lifted Max’s shirt off and hung it on one of the handrails. He started kissing Max’s abs as he pulled down Max’s pants and boxers. Max’s boner sprung out of its confines, drooling precum as it snapped to attention against his thick pubic hairs. Seth paused for a moment, taking in the scent of Max’s groin area before taking his tongue and slowly licking up the length of Max’s dick. Max trembled in response. This was the greatest experience he could imagine. Seth soon wrapped his lips around the tip of Max’s dick and started rubbing his tongue over the head.<br />
<br />
Max’s mind was in overload. The feeling was greater than anything he had ever imagined before. Memories of similar situations between him and Seth flooded his mind, but another part of him like this was incredibly new and different, unlike anything he had ever experienced before. He couldn’t help but give in to his raging hormones, closing his eyes while he reached out and ran his hands through Seth’s hair. <br />
<br />
As Seth continued to pleasure Max, Max was unaware as his body started bulking out a bit, filling in with more muscle, growing a bit more hair on his chest while his pits started filling out with a significantly larger number of hairs. The memories of the asexual, aromantic nerd who collected bugs and did well in school were almost completely gone, filled with growing up in Canada, playing lacrosse, moving to America, meeting Seth, playing football, struggling in school due to severe dyslexia and ADHD even while he exceled at sports…And of course, masturbating or having sex with his boyfriend on a regular basis. The memories overwhelmed him as the most mind-blowing orgasm rocked his body. The ropes of semen seemed to never stop as his boyfriend did his best to swallow Max’s massive load that had been pent-up all day so far. He felt the spurts finally slow down as he basked in the post-orgasmic bliss that swept over his body.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit, that was amazing…” he said, opening his eyes and looking down at his boyfriend as Seth slowly pulled himself off of Max’s softening pole. “Thank you so much, Babe! I needed that so badly…”<br />
<br />
Seth wiped his chin and stuck his fingers in his mouth, sucking off some cum that had dribbled out from Max’s incredible load. “Anything for you, stud,” he replied, standing up and bringing Max in for another French kiss.<br />
<br />
Max returned the kiss, marveling at the fact that he was tasting some of his own semen that had transferred from Seth’s mouth. They pulled away as they heard the bell ring. Seth knew that people would be making their way into the bathroom soon, and he didn’t want to get caught. “Love you, Bae!” Seth said as he opened the door to the stall and stepped out. “I’ll see you in Brit Lit!”<br />
<br />
Max quickly closed and locked the stall door pulling up his pants and putting his shirt back on. He flushed the toilet in case anyone had come in the bathroom, but upon exiting, he found that it was empty. He felt different about himself. A stronger confidence than anything that he had felt that day so far. Looking into the mirror, it seemed something was off. His shirt seemed to hug his chest a bit tighter. His chest felt a bit hairier, his face a little more chiseled. He shook it off. It was just his imagination. He headed to his locker to get his books for his next class. Even though he had just cum, his hormones were already excited about getting to Brit Lit and spending it with Seth. His David Copperfield project was completely out of his mind. All he cared about now was playing sports and spending time with his hot boyfriend.</p>
