<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
Gathering up all of the articles he was going to purchase, Kyle headed over the the cashier. She was tall, but next to Kyle she looked tiny. Having not been paying attention, the cashier was shocked when see finally looked up at Kyle.<br />
	<br />
“Did you find everything that you were looking for, sir?” She asked after a moment, then flirtatiously added, “I’d been more than willing to help you makes some further selections.”<br />
	<br />
This caused Kyle to blush, with red appearing in both of his cheeks and even his ears. “Ah, no, no thank you. I think I got everything that I wanted.”<br />
	<br />
“Are you sure? Because I have a few suggestions that I think you will like.”<br />
	<br />
Not knowing what to say, Kyle blushed even harder. He could not believe that a woman would be flirting with him, because while the jacket enhanced a guys development, it did not change Kyle’s age. He was still the sixteen-year-old who was a sophomore in high school. And still being a sixteen-year-old, Kyle could not resist the simplest of temptations when it came from members of the opposite sex.<br />
	<br />
“Um, well, sure.” Kyle managed to stammer out. “I think I would like that.”<br />
	<br />
“Great. Follow me. I have a few ideas I think you will like.”<br />
	<br />
Over the course of the next hour, the cashier changed out all of the bagging shirts that Kyle had picked out, for t-shirts which were form fitting. She let Kyle keep the jeans he had chosen, but she then took him over to the racks that had button down shirts.<br />
	<br />
Kyle had still been wearing his old shirt that was tearing at the seams, but had put on some new jeans he was planning to wear out of the store. So when she was looking through the button down shirts, she said, “Take that old t-shirt off and try on this.” In her hand was a very nice solid black shirt with white buttons.<br />
	<br />
Lifting his arms up, both of them heard the sound of cloth tearing. Kyle could only blush and shrug his shoulders before taking of the damage garment. Yet from the way that the cashier was eyeing Kyle like a piece of chocolate, Kyle realized she loved the scene in front of her. She was almost reluctant to hand over the button down shirt.<br />
	<br />
Unfortunately for Kyle, the shirt ended up being a little too small, meaning the cashier had to look for a larger size. This really annoyed Kyle, especially because she was constantly stealing glances at him shirtless. Finally she found a few button down shirts that would fit him. Kyle thought that that was all, but she then pulled some slacks and a jacket off other racks.<br />
	<br />
Handing him black slacks, a white button down shirt and a black blazer, she said, “Go and see what this looks like on you.”<br />
	<br />
The cashier followed Kyle into the dressing room. He finally had to ask her to step out. This caused disappointment to appear on her face, but she took a few steps back, allowing Kyle to close the door for some privacy.<br />
	<br />
 Putting on the black slacks, white button down and the black blazer, Kyle couldn’t help but agree that he really did look good. However, this is when Kyle noticed the shadow that had appeared on his face. Kyle reached up and felt the hairs that were just starting to grow out of his face. While he liked how it made him look, Kyle also realized he could pass for someone in college.<br />
	<br />
“Finding everything to your liking?” The cashier called in.<br />
	<br />
“Yeah, everything is great.”<br />
	<br />
“Well don’t keep me waiting. Come on out.” Thinking Kyle couldn’t hear her, she then more quietly added, “This guy would look really sexy in a suit.” Stepping out of the dressing room, Kyle was greeted by the very enthused cashier.<br />
	<br />
Liking the way the slacks and blazer made him look, Kyle decided to wear the outfit out of the store. This meant that the cashier got a little handsy when she took the tag from off the pants. Putting everything into bags, the cashier took the recipe and said, “My name is Cicil and this is my number.” She then slipped it into one of the bags. <br />
	<br />
Kyle was very relieved and excited as he walked away. Relieved because he thought that Cicil would suddenly realize he was at least five years her junior, and excited that he actually might have a chance at getting laid, as was shown by the large bulge in his pants. Of course, this second thought was the most prevalent and caused a massive bulge to form in his pants. Kyle could not help but smirk as people noticed his large friend.<br />
	<br />
With t-shirts, pants, jeans, button down shirts, and even a large amount of athletic gear in his bags. Kyle headed out to look for Eric and Hank. Kyle guessed  that Eric and Hank would be in the adult section because of Hank’s new size. And they did not disappoint.<br />
	<br />
Walking up to the pair, the first thing Eric asked was, “Did you put the jacket on again?”<br />
	<br />
“Yeah. I didn’t mean to, but I did it without thinking. It was not for long though.” The showing off his new outfit, “I chose to wear this blazer and put the jacket in one of the bags for now. But Eric?”<br />
	<br />
“What?” Eric replied seeing concern displayed on his friends face.<br />
	<br />
“I don’t think it is a good idea for us to continue to wear the jacket.”<br />
	<br />
This surprised rich, because he knew how good it felt to see that improvements on their physique. “Why, did something happen?”<br />
	<br />
“You could say that. I now have stubble.” Kyle answered rubbing his right hand along his jaw line.<br />
	<br />
“Dude, you really do have stubble. That’s awesome!” Eric exclaimed upon taking a closer look at his friend.<br />
	<br />
Rolling his eyes, Kyle said, “Dude, focus and think for a second. I’m sixteen, almost seven feet tall, heavily muscled and have a beard growing in. What seems out of place in that in that list.”<br />
	<br />
“I don’t know. That you’re sixteen?”<br />
	<br />
“Exactly. Eric, I’ve never heard of anyone being this developed at the age of sixteen. Something is really wrong.”<br />
	<br />
“What do you mean?”<br />
<br />
Sighing, Kyle looked right in Eric’s eyes and asked, “How old does Hank look?” Seeing realization start to appear on Eric’s face, Kyle continued, “He looks like he could be in high school, yet he is still in middle school. Do you want Hank to look like he could be in college and still be in the seventh grade? Hell, I already look like I’m about to graduate from college. I think we need to really think about whether you and Hank are going to continue to wear it, because I’m fucking done.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I don’t think I’m going to let Hank wear it anymore, but I still want a bit more development.”<br />
<br />
“Why?”<br />
<br />
“Well, I want to join the football team as a lineman, so I figured I could use a little more mass.”<br />
<br />
“Eric. You don’t need the jacket for that. All you need to do is increase the size of your lunches.” Seeing the quizzical expression on Eric’s face, Kyle added, “Linemen are not well known for abs. They are better known for their bellies.”<br />
<br />
Looking down, Eric grinned, “True. I hadn’t really thought of that, but I also want a little bit for height, could I put it on for a pit?”<br />
<br />
Reluctantly, Kyle pulled the jacket out of one of the bags and handed it over to Eric. When Eric grabbed hold, Kyle held on for a few more moments before letting go and said, “Just be careful not to wear it for too long, bro.”</p>
