<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Even though he was lost in a sea of pleasure, Scott knew that he couldn't stand it much longer.  With every quick beat of his heart, the same refrain echoed inside him...&quot;Change, change, change.&quot;  He forced his eyes open and looking down, he could see that his arms no longer even looked human, his brown arm hair now a thick and dark brown fur, his swollen fingers capped with inhuman claws.  His tee-shirt felt unbearably tight. Having very little control over his twitching muscles, he grasped the elastic neck with a shaking hand, stretching it as far down as it would go and revealing the thick tuft of light mocha chest fur between his pecs.  <br />
<br />
He turned his head and there was Nick still bent over the stool, his nose now turned up into an delicate yet animalistic muzzle, short wiry whiskers protruding from his cheeks.  &quot;But what is Nick?&quot; Scott asked himself.  What kind of creature was literally working its way out of his friend's skin thanks to the strange 'Animal Revealer' drink served to them by the bartender?<br />
<br />
------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The bartender noticed that Nick was desperately groaning now.  The kid wanted a tail so badly but it just wasn't coming.  What creature inside his psyche was so timid that it wouldn't come out even with the help of Pleasure Island's special drink?  Finally deciding to help, the bearish bartender walked around the bar to the changing boy.  Coming behind Nick, who was oblivious to his ursine helper in his transformational daze, the bartender took his enormous clawed paws and gently peeled back the top of Nick's jeans.  <br />
<br />
-------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Scott, trying to keep an eye on his friend even while he felt like his changing feet were going to explode.  Immediately after the bartender began to work down the back of Nick's jeans, Scott heard a sudden &quot;CRACK.&quot;  A small tail appeared out Nick's backside in a puff of golden yellow and white fur, while his shoes exploded in a storm of torn leather and rubber revealing two huge, lapine feet, their tops covered in yellow fur.  But it was the sight of Nick's ears, tips suddenly extending upward by about two feet in a mere two seconds, that made Scott realize that cowering inside Nick had been a handsome buck rabbit, with golden fur that matched his still human head of hair and a twitching rabbity tail.  <br />
<br />
-------------------------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Well done son!&quot; exclaimed the bartender, clapping Nick on the back as the bar cheered.  Nick was still in shock, sprawled out over the stool with his tail in the air, staring at the pink puffy rabbit pads on the palms of his handpaws.  &quot;How about you, son?  Need a hand there?&quot; asked the bartender, who Scott noticed had now turned into a full bear man.  &quot;I think I can do it&quot; groaned Scott, now determined to form his tail on his own and without the bartender's help.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on buddy, you can do it!&quot; cheered the rhino kid in a deep baritone voice.  &quot;That's right, sprout that tail&quot; encouraged the bartender.  Scott, now leaning against the bar, his fingers digging into the wooden railing, felt the pressure on his feet suddenly release.  Looking underneath him and past his brown-furred shins, he saw that the toe of his athletic shoe had separated from the sole, his feet having pushed their way through.  And while he knew he was becoming an animal boy, he didn't realize how bizarre the sight of something as common as his foot would seem to him in its changed state.  While not as long as Nick's powerful rabbit feet, Scott could see that his own feet had grown by at least six inches.  They were covered in the same brown fur as his arms, except for the very extremities of his toes.  <br />
<br />
Scott admired his toes, adorned with short but sharp claws firmly planted into the wide oak planks of the pub's floor.  Scott chittered happily to himself.  He liked the changes to hands and feet.  &quot;They'll be so useful for climbing trees&quot; he thought.  &quot;I'll be able sink my claws into the bark and climb and climb, and Nick can hop&quot; he mumbled, letting loose another slightly unhinged chittering giggle.  &quot;I'll be able to get at all those tasty fruit and nuts, and maybe even find a mate with a big sexy tail just like me&quot; he imagined.  But, with a glance back, Scott realized that he didn't have a tail yet.  Desperate, he bent over and grasped his rodent-like toes, putting as much pressure as he could on the throbbing lump in his khaki shorts.<br />
<br />
With a satisfying &quot;RIP&quot;, the seam in Scott's shorts separated as an enormous, fluffy squirrel tail sprouted above his furry brown butt cheeks.  The crowd of animals around the two boys cheered, as Scott felt the aftershocks of the change sweep over him, wave after diminishing wave causing his tail to move even higher and become even furrier, his front teeth to become even larger.  Finally, when the last surge caused the tip of his tail to reach as high as his head, and his two front rodent teeth had pushed well below his lower lip, Scott felt complete<br />
<br />
--------------------------<br />
<br />
Scott was human no longer.  Pleasure Island and the strange &quot;Animal Revealer&quot; drink had changed him.  He was now a lanky young squirrel boy with chestnut brown fur that matched the color of his shaggy human hair, and a huge fluffy tail that the crowd was already petting in admiration.  The &quot;Animal Revealer&quot; hadn't changed his body completely.  Rather, he still had the high cheekbones, long arms and legs, and generally lanky frame he'd always had.  Instead, it had simply brought out the feral power inside of him.  <br />
<br />
Likewise, his friend Nick was still recognizable as Nick, with his trademark messy blond hair and piercing blue eyes, although his lapine features lent him a certain silly cuteness.    <br />
<br />
As for the bartender, he was proud of his handiwork.  He had helped a handsome young bunny lad and an equally attractive squirrel lad to come to grips with their inner animal.  He licked his black lips, imagining the sensitive pink rodent cocks that both probably had nested between their furry legs.</p>
