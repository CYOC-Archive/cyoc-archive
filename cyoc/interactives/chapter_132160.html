<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nolan decided it was best to he go to work. Dan had pulled a lot of strings to get him this job and if Nolan didn&#39;t show, it&#39;d surely tarnish Dan&#39;s reputation in the company.<br />
<br />
Nolan made his way down the stairs and out to his car on the curb. He&#39;d bought the car from his father, it was a respectable car and still looked good, but Nolan and his artist&#39;s eye for detail could pick out every scratch and bump. He didn&#39;t like the car to be honest, but now with the watch he could have anything he wanted. He selected the car and scrolled through the options. &quot;Hmm, should I go with a Porsche, maybe a Mercedes?&quot; He whispered to himself, &quot;I&#39;ve always wanted a BMW, lets make it an i8!&quot;<br />
<br />
He was about to apply the change when he froze dead in his tracks. Across the street at Maggie&#39;s door stood two suits questioning her through the screen door. Nolan slowly lowered the watch and entered his old car and drove down the street. As he did he spotted two more suits searching the surrounding houses. It seemed they were looking for something but apparently they didn&#39;t know what. <br />
<br />
Nolan was nervous now, but the further he got from them the better he felt. He passed the market district and the still closed coffee shop owned by Nicole. He wondered briefly how she was doing as a griffon. <br />
<br />
Nolan had gotten lost very easily yesterday but the city was much more navigable with a GPS. He was led straight to the office building, it stretched into the skyline covered in crystal clear glass. Nolan parked his car in a connected parking garage on the top level, the only space available.<br />
<br />
He walked into the lobby and was greeted by a secretary between the elevators. She looked young, late twenties maybe. She was Indian with a beautiful shade of brown skin and black hair, her bangs braided reaching behind her head into the waterfall of curly brown hair. In short she was a lovely looking woman. &quot;Can I help you sir?&quot; She asked in a polite and kind tone. <br />
&quot;Y-yeah I&#39;m looking for Trending Trends, could you tell me what floor?&quot;<br />
She glanced at a paper on her desk, with a little bit of surprise. &quot;Would you by chance happen to be Nolan?&quot;<br />
&quot;Um, yeah. Why do you ask?&quot;<br />
&quot;I was told to call the office when you arrived, please wait over there.&quot; She asked, pointing to a cluster of leather seats. <br />
<br />
Nolan&#39;s nervousness returned as he sat down. Was it the suits? How could they have found him, it&#39;d been hours since he&#39;d used the watch and was far away from any hot spots. If anything happened he could defend himself with the watch but it&#39;d only make him easier to track. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey man! Long time no see!&quot; Called out a booming voice from behind him. Nolan turned to see Dan, waving him over to the elevator, he got up and jogged to his friend.<br />
<br />
Daniel was a large man, African American, his hair in tight thick curls hugging his scalp. He wore an untucked striped shirt, making him look taller than he was wide.<br />
<br />
&quot;Long time, Dan.&quot; He and Nolan exchanged high-fives. &quot;Oh dude, you had me scared, for a moment there I thought I was in trouble.&quot; Nolan sighed in relief. <br />
&quot;Trouble? Why would you be in trouble?&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a long story, you got someplace private? I gotta show you something!&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, we can talk in my office after I show you around.&quot;<br />
<br />
The firm was located on the 85th floor, total of 90. The decor was very modern, light wood tones, black and chrome. Past the front desk the style continued, into the main floor of cubicles. Dan introduced him to coworkers and a general pecking order of the staff before showing him to his office. Which as it turned out wasn&#39;t an office at all, just a double cubicle in the back corner of the floor, it was secluded though.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Noel, what&#39;s so important that you have to show me?&quot; Dan asked reclining in his chair, arms crossed. Nolan pulled back his cuff to show Dan the watch. &quot;Nice watch?&quot; He smirked<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not just a watch, it can control reality!&quot;<br />
&quot;Dude, You can&#39;t expect me to believe something like that&quot;<br />
<br />
Nolan knew where this was going, so he decided to cut to the chase, punching in the commands on the watch. Daniel cocked a brow at Nolan fiddling with the watch, thinking he was trying to convince him of the claim. Nolan finished his command making the change almost instant and hit apply. <br />
<br />
Daniel continued to watch from his chair unaware that his bulk had slimmed, becoming thin in the waist. His excess flab becoming taut and shapely, defined female curves. He didn&#39;t notice until he felt his shoes loosen and looked down. He was greeted by the sight of two large orbs inflating beneath his shirt. In a panic Dan ripped his shirt open flinging the buttons across the floor.<br />
<br />
The soft breasts bounced about his chest an oddly arousing sensation for Daniel. He grabbed them to stop it only to begin groping his breasts in amazement, his cheeks flushed with color. Dan&#39;s groping stopped when he felt a twinge from his crotch. He looked up to Nolan in shock &quot;you did...&quot;. Nolan gave him a grin and nodded his head &#39;yes&#39;<br />
<br />
Dan spun around in his chair turning his back to Nolan. He could hear the zipper of Dan&#39;s pants go down. He sat there frozen for a moment in his chair before his arm moved slightly, followed by a gasp and heavy breathing. As Dan caught his breath Nolan heard his fly again before he spun back around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, so... The watch checks out&quot;<br />
Dan sighed, the blush draining from his cheeks, his mouth still agape from wonder. Nolan was about to fill him in on his adventures so far with the watch when Dan cut in &quot;What else can it do?&quot; <br />
&quot;Just about anything I guess, I haven&#39;t played with all the functions but transformation I&#39;ve gotten pretty good at. Do you want me to change you back?&quot;<br />
&quot;Nono, but, well... um...&quot;<br />
&quot;Out with it Dan.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, you know how I have that thing for large women?&quot;<br />
&quot;Say no more.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nolan set the changes and applied them. Instantly Dan began to inflate with mass, his baggy clothes filling out. Pudge built up on his arms, small rolls at his elbows and wrists. His ballooning stomach matched only by his (still growing) G-cup breasts, staring the few remaining buttons he had left on his shirt. Dan&#39;s neck swelled like a frog as his cheeks softened into round mounds. His thighs bulked up straining the arms of the chair not to mention the height spring. The growing mass strained his pants, small seams giving way and his shoes began to fit again. <br />
<br />
Daniel now sat in the chair, firmly wedged between its arms as a +++ sized beauty, for extra measure Nolan gave him some longer hair, the curls swirling in thick locks. He brought his hands to his enormous breasts, sinking his fingers into the soft skin, bringing his blush back. Dan was quickly becoming distracted with his new body, it would have gotten lewd if Nolan hadn&#39;t cut in. &quot;So what do you wanna do next?&quot;</p>
