<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For Annie, becoming a zebra Animalian wasn&#39;t so hard. Yes, she had to learn how to walk properly on her new hooves, her fingers weren&#39;t as dexterous as before, and her diet was more restricted. But Annie was able to tackle those problems easily. The hard part was getting used to a zebra mare&#39;s mating instincts. As a human, she could offhandedly tell the cute guys from the not-cute guys, though it was more of an objective feeling. But as an Animalian, her instincts were telling her that the guys were hot. Having identified herself as a lesbian all of her life gave conflicted feelings.<br />
<br />
And no one was arousing her conflicted feelings more than Stuart. He wasn&#39;t just a zebra stallion, he was a heavily-muscled, sculpted stallion. He was a bit too forward with their first meeting, though that was mostly the fault of his Regressive Hypersexuality Syndrome. But he was able to rein himself in and act more like a gentleman. Their first official date was nice, mostly dinner and a chance to get to know each other better. Annie had seen Stuart a few times after that, though they were mostly for brief chats. However, each meeting, no matter brief, made it harder for her to suppress her body&#39;s mating instincts.<br />
<br />
When they were discussing where they could go for their second date, Stuart noticed that she seemed more distracted. &quot;Is there something wrong?&quot; asked Stuart.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, nothing&#39;s wrong,&quot; said Annie, &quot;I mean, yes, there is something, but it&#39;s not wrong as in &#39;unnatural&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not going into heat, are you?&quot; asked Stuart.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m not,&quot; said Annie, &quot;But I have been feeling...more attracted to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that bothers you?&quot; asked Stuart.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I mean, I&#39;ve seen myself as a strong, independent woman who doesn&#39;t need a man to make her happy. I&#39;ve helped other women who have no inclination towards men. I just feel that if I give in, it would betray everything I stood for,&quot; said Annie.<br />
<br />
Stuart scratched his nose and said, &quot;I&#39;m not really sure what all that means.&quot;<br />
<br />
Annie sighed and said, &quot;I suppose you wouldn&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I do know someone who would,&quot; said Stuart.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who?&quot; asked Annie.<br />
<br />
&quot;What say we make our date a double date?&quot; asked Stuart.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Annie had heard of Ella and Simone before she came to Animalia. Those two had drawn quite a lot of attention to themselves, especially with Simone relaunching her musical career. Annie had met them briefly, but hadn&#39;t had the time to really get to know them with her acclimation classes. Now she wished she had sought them out sooner as the three women had quite a lot in common.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what this town really needs?&quot; asked Simone.<br />
<br />
&quot;What doesn&#39;t it have?&quot; asked Annie.<br />
<br />
&quot;A disco, a place where people can really groove out,&quot; said Simone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Simone, honey, I don&#39;t think discos are as well-remembered as you think,&quot; said Ella.<br />
<br />
&quot;But Annie, here, remembers, don&#39;t you child?&quot; asked Simone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was a kid during the 70&#39;s,&quot; said Annie. It was a little surreal to be called &#39;child&#39; by these two ladies, especially since they looked younger than herself. But they were double-dosed and she maintained her body to stay in shape so the age gap didn&#39;t seem quite so distant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe we could have the Meat Market do a disco night,&quot; said Ella, &quot;There oughta be different themes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ladies, I need to go to the bathroom,&quot; said Stuart, getting up from the table. Of course, that was Ella and Simone&#39;s cue to start talking about something that was more in their field of expertise.<br />
<br />
As soon as Stuart was gone, Ella asked, &quot;So, how far have you gotten with Stuart?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not that far,&quot; said Annie, &quot;I mean, we&#39;re just dating because Dr. Jones says I should.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t need to hold back,&quot; said Simone, &quot;We can tell you&#39;re hot for him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I shouldn&#39;t be,&quot; said Annie quietly, &quot;If the friends I&#39;ve helped with their...private problems learn I&#39;m sexually attracted to a man, they&#39;d think I was a hypocrite.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what was it you said? Something like &#39;you don&#39;t have to choose to be with a man&#39;?&quot; asked Ella.<br />
<br />
&quot;To that effect, yes,&quot; said Annie.<br />
<br />
&quot;That argument also says that you don&#39;t have to choose to be with a woman,&quot; said Ella, &quot;Being with Stuart doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re turning your back on everything you were. You&#39;re just open to another choice. There&#39;s no shame in being bi.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose you two are still dealing with that,&quot; said Annie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, we&#39;ve accepted it for some time,&quot; said Simone, &quot;As much as me and Ella love each other, we sometimes get Tom and Frank to come over and really give us a good time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Annie blinked and said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I was under the impression you two were married.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We may as well be married,&quot; said Ella, &quot;I suppose eventually we&#39;ll get around to getting a license and whatever. Perhaps someday we&#39;ll let Tom and Frank knock one of us up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;ll have to be you, girlfriend,&quot; said Simone, &quot;I&#39;m the career girl in this relationship.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I never would have imagined a relationship like that,&quot; said Annie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Animalia allows us to be a lot more open than humans,&quot; said Ella, &quot;You&#39;re not so much losing yourself as becoming more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What you really need is another woman,&quot; said Simone, &quot;Someone to share your bisexuality with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, there ought to be plenty of them around,&quot; said Annie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, since other countries have been shipping them in, that&#39;s not quite so hard to find,&quot; said Ella.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not to mention any of your old friends might want to convert too,&quot; said Simone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there is that,&quot; admitted Annie.<br />
<br />
&quot;But until then, perhaps we can fill in,&quot; said Ella suggestively.<br />
<br />
&quot;Share some of that hunky zebra with you,&quot; said Simone, less than subtlety.<br />
<br />
Looking between the two, Annie had a hard time thinking of a reason to say &#39;no&#39;. They were both gorgeous and sexy. A part of her was more reluctant, most likely the herbivore reacting to two predators. But the thrill of danger made it more enticing.<br />
<br />
Then Stuart came back and said, &quot;Well, ladies, have you had a good talk?&quot;<br />
<br />
Annie looked at him with appreciative eyes. Stuart knew what he was doing with inviting Ella and Simone and he knew what this would lead to. And she was finding herself welcoming the offering. &quot;We did,&quot; said Annie, &quot;And I think I know what I want for dessert.&quot;<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
After dinner, the two couples adjourned to Ella and Simone&#39;s penthouse, which boasted a large bed big enough for the four of them. As worked up as they were, it didn&#39;t take long for the four of them to get out of their clothes. Ella and Simone moved in on Annie first. Annie&#39;s instincts made her nervous at first, being between two predators. But those instincts were overruled with pleasure as they started sucking on her nipples, the lioness on the right breast and the panthress on the left. Stuart wasn&#39;t being left out on the action either. He was lying on the bed with Annie sitting right in front of him, Ella and Simone rubbing his mighty shaft.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Ella pulled away from Annie&#39;s breast and said, &quot;I think she&#39;s ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
Simone left her tit and said, &quot;I know he&#39;s ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
Together, they guided Annie&#39;s hips and Stuart&#39;s cock towards each other. Annie wasn&#39;t a virgin, though she&#39;s only had dildos put inside of her. To have an actual penis... She gasped as she felt Stuart enter her. He was a lot thicker than any of the toys she had used before. And he was definitely a lot longer as he was still pushing into her. But it felt good, it felt very good. She moaned as she allowed herself to sink along his shaft. She only got so far before Ella and Simone pulled her back and allowed her to sink again. Annie was being overcome with sensations as the cats returned to her nipples as they continued to slide her up and down.<br />
<br />
Soon enough, Stuart&#39;s pre was starting to have an affect on her. She felt a burning in her muscles as they became stronger. She was never out of shape, but she was building up more muscle than she ever had, becoming more toned than ever. The small aches that age had caused were melting away. Ella and Simone could testify to Annie&#39;s breasts firming up and growing bigger, producing more milk than before. What grey hair was in her mane was returning to a youthful black. Annie&#39;s moans of desire got louder as she felt herself clenching harder and harder around Stuart. Finally, she let out a loud barking cry as she hit her climax. Stuart let out a barking cry himself as he fired a huge blast of seed into Annie.<br />
<br />
Annie snorted as she slowly came down off her high. She had never felt this good before. Not just the pleasure, but the vigor in her body. She now had the tone of a bodybuilder, but her breasts were bigger than she ever had. &quot;I could get used to this kind of sex,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope you&#39;re not excluding girls,&quot; purred Ella.<br />
<br />
Annie looked at Ella. She wasn&#39;t completely depleted just yet. In fact, she had more energy to burn. And this sexy lioness was turning her on no less than the zebra stud between her legs. &quot;Not by a long shot,&quot; said Annie in a husky tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you don&#39;t mind if I give this pony a ride,&quot; said Simone, maneuvering Annie off of Stuart&#39;s cock.<br />
<br />
Stuart lifted his head up and asked, &quot;Pony?&quot; in an indignant tone.<br />
<br />
Simone put a finger to his lips and said, &quot;Don&#39;t mind the pet names. Actions speak louder than words.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking at the panther&#39;s impressive rack, Stuart was inclined to agree. &quot;I&#39;ll stretch you out more than your tomcat,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I like a good stretch,&quot; purred Simone, moving herself onto Stuart.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Annie and Ella were making out, grinding their bodies against each other. Normally, an encounter between a zebra and a lioness would end badly for the zebra. But Annie was feeling nothing but pleasure tonight. Life as a bisexual just became a lot more favorable.</p>
