<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mary was livid all day and bitching at everyone, Patrick made sure she did not see him smile at her misfortune. Patrick thought back to this morning and how the changes took so long to wear off. Did the more times he used the clown nose make the changes longer to wear off? Did that mean one time he would be able to change back? He shuddered at the thought and that the idea appealed to him. Or did the longer he wore the nose mean that it took longer to wear off? He talked himself into believing it was the later because he desperately wanted to continue, the feelings it gave him were too good. He decided to do it again right after his mom went to bed that way he had plenty of time to change back. With that knowledge he actually was able to pay attention in class and join his friends at lunch. He talked with his friends about video games, TV and even what a bitch Mary was and how she deserved what she got. They all laughed and had a good time and Patrick felt as he were a part of the group. When Patrick got home he plopped onto the couch and stayed away from the clown nose because he knew he wouldn&#39;t be able to resist putting it on. As he was watching cartoons a short came on about a clown at a circus. The clown had a red muzzle, hair and nose and had four fingers covered by oversize gloves. He was walking up vertical pole, falling from great heights and just bouncing off the ground, pieing and seltzering everyone he could get n range of. Patrick Laughed and giggled at the antics of the clown. &#39;Now that is the type of clown I want to be, my own type.&#39; His mom comes home and he yells hello to her as she walks through the door.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re feeling better.&quot;<br />
&quot;I told you I was fine.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ok, but I better not catch you trying to dye your hair again.&quot;<br />
&quot;I wasn&#39;t trying to dye my hair. I told you I don&#39;t know how that happened.&quot; Patrick said with as much convection as he could manage.<br />
They had a good dinner and watched TV that night. Patrick kept glancing at the clock willing it to move faster but it just seemed to go slower instead. Finally after someone was voted off survivor it was time for bed, he tried to seem like he was not hurrying and gave a half heart fight to stay up longer. He went to his room undressed to his boxers, jumped into bed and listened and waited. He laid there and stared at the box and listen to his mom getting ready for bed before silence. Still he waited till he was literally pacing glancing at the clock it was 10:45 and he decided it had been long enough. He quickly got out the clown nose and stood in front of the mirror, time to become the clown he wanted to be. He put of the clown nose which went onto his nose with a suction sound and his eyes rolled back as the tingle danced over his body. Blinking and looking at himself he saw his skin was already snow white and as the tingles raced up to the top of his head he saw his hair slowly turn blue from the roots and curl into an afro. He absently stroked his clown nose, admiring as it felt like a real nose now, in euphoric bliss as he watched the changes happen faster. Red developed into a muzzle around his mouth, his lips grew larger and curled into a smile. Green and orange diamonds appeared above his eyes as his eyebrows disappeared and three black freckles formed on his cheeks. He looked down and saw his nipples were tiny red balls and the &#39;hair down there&#39; was blue too. His stomach expanded till it looked like he was just a beach ball with arms, legs and a head. He held up his hands and observed with excitement as his pinky and ring finger merged giving him four fingers on each hand before white gloves encased his hands. He laughed and fell backwards only to bounce back and forth around his room. He grabbed his large feet and rolled to stop himself and the kept rolling and laughing till he was to dizzy and stopped. He had never been so happy in his entire life and felt so much like himself than now. He grabbed a yellow shirt, green pants, wide blue tie and large red shoes from the closet and got dressed. Opening the window he started to make his exit put found he could no longer fir through. He sat there half out of the window till an idea came to him. He took a deep breath and sucked everything in till he was as thin as a toothpick and slipped out before exhaling back to his normal size. Laughing he jumped up and grab his feet before landing on his bum and bouncing over the fence. He bounced his way around the neighborhood vaguely aware of where he was going before he landed in front of Mary&#39;s house again. They had cleaned up as best they could but there was still toilet paper stuck here and there. He looked up to Mary&#39;s window and saw the light was out. He went over to the tree and began to walk up it vertically and continue till he was walking upside down above the roof. Dropping down to the second floor and walked over to her window. Peeking in he saw no one, a little disappointed, she was probably over at one of her friends’ houses. Bouncing down he walked around the house.<br />
&quot;HA, caught you.&quot; A voice calls out from the darkness and Patrick froze in fright.<br />
&quot;Thought you could come back and do it again? Wait till I call the police.&quot; A female voice says as a flashlight is switched on and blinds him.<br />
&quot;What the.......&quot; Patrick blinks and looking past the flashlight he sees Mary standing there with her mouth open in shock.<br />
&quot;Patrick?&quot; &#39;Oh fuck, she recognized me.&#39; thought Patrick as he unconsciously reaches behind his back.<br />
SPLAT. The flashlight falls to the ground as well as Mary. Patrick rushes forward and realizes that he threw a pie at her.<br />
&quot;You little......Ha, ha, ha.&quot; Mary dissolved into laughter as she wipes away the cream. Patrick stands there unsure if to run or stay and try to explain. But then he notices something odd, as she wiped away the white cream it seems to stay on her skin. In fact all of her skin seems to be turning white and the pink cherry on her nose seems to be getting bigger. She continues to laugh no doubled over on the ground. Patrick watches in horror and excitement as her hair starts to turn purple from the roots falling down her back. Panic finally overwhelms him at what he did and he takes off down the alley. Thoughts ran through his mind &#39;What happens when it wears off and she tells everyone?&#39; The humiliation of having to explain being dressed as a clown and running around the neighborhood. &#39;Why is this happening?&#39; &#39;Why did she turn into a clown?&#39; &#39;How do I turn into a clown?&#39; None of this he could explain, at least in any way that would make sense. Patrick jumped over his fence and bolts though his window. He reaches up and tries to pull of the clown nose but finds it stuck. With both hands he puts more force behind it and watches as his nose comically stretches before the clown nose comes lose and his nose snaps back knocking him down. He looks at the clown nose in his hand as his heart races before throwing it into the trash. He tears off his clothes and tosses them into the closet. Standing there naked with the blood pounding in his ears he wonders again about what to do as a cold sense of dread washes over him. Glancing into the mirror he sees his clown body and is excited that he is a clown but horrified at what he has done. Not coming up with a solution he crawls into bed and waits for himself to return to normal. He watches in disappointment as his stomach shrinks down and his fingers start to separate. He could stay as a clown and run away and join the circus or something and the idea excites him but sends fear through him too. To give up his life and have to live the rest of it as a clown was unthinkable, right? His fingers return to five and he grips his knees to his chest, his hair falling out of the curls around his head. Patrick closed his eyes and sleep overtook him till the rays of the sun hit him through his open window and he heard sounds from his mom&#39;s room. He jerks his eyes open as everything that happened last night comes back to him. Jumping out of bed he races over to the mirror to examine himself. To his horror he had not completely changed back. Running his eyes down his body he found that his skin was still pale more so on his chest which was almost white. His nipples stood out as red balls on the white as well as his pubic hair was still blue. He examined his face and found thankfully that is was back to normal but pale but there were spots in his hair that were still blue. His heart pounding again he thought of what to do as he looked at his hand he found himself holding the clown nose he threw away last night. <br />
He could run away but almost immediately he dismissed the idea of leaving his mom and his life. He tossed the troublesome clown nose back in the trash. Peeking out of his room to check for his mom he found the coast clear and ran to the bathroom. Turning on the shower he got in and tried in vain to wash the color from his hair. His mom knocked on the door. &quot;You ok honey. You&#39;re up early.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not feeling well and couldn&#39;t sleep.&quot;<br />
&quot;Do you need to stay home?&quot; Patrick thought about it but wanted to find out about Mary. &quot;No, I think I can go to school&quot;<br />
Getting out of the shower he stood in front of the mirror debating what to do about his hair. His eyes fall to the counter and he sees the clown nose there. Jumping back he was sure he threw it away in his room, He picked it up and threw it in the toilet before flushing it down. Turning back to the mirror he grabbed some scissors and started to cut the blue spots from his hair and flushed them down the toilet too. Deciding he did not look to bad he ran to his room and choose a long sleeve high collar shirt and long pants. Turning to leave he finds the clown nose waiting for him on his desk. Picking it up in anger he runs to the kitchen and throws it into the garbage disposal and turns it on and hears a satisfying crunch. He grabs a hat and yells at his mom that he was going to meet his friends before school he runs out the door.<br />
<br />
Kristy dashes out of her room as she hears her son leave the house. Wondering what was going on with him she turns to go back to her room to finish getting ready she spots something odd on the kitchen counter. Picking up she discovers it to be a clown nose.</p>
