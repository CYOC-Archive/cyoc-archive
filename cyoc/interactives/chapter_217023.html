<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Meanwhile the real Ruby Donaldson was feeling victimised as she walked from English class to her next class - Social studies - down the corridor. At lunchtime she had been called to the vice principals office and once more given the lecture about dressing appropriately. So what if the skirt of her uniform was shorter than the regulations demanded? And she couldn&#39;t help that her her breasts were larger than average - they didn&#39;t make uniforms that fit her very well - of course she had to alter it. Why couldn&#39;t that bitch of a deputy get a life. Just because she was a frumpy old spinster who couldn&#39;t get a second look from a man, it didn&#39;t mean everybody wanted the same fate. <br />
<br />
Ruby was so self absorbed that she didn&#39;t at first notice how the other students quietened as she walked the corridor and stared at her. Little did she know that a rumour had spread like wildfire among the students. Ruby Donaldson had suffered some sort of breakdown and had been found naked in the boys shower in the gymnasium and been paraded down the hall in nothing but a towel.<br />
<br />
Ruby went into the classroom and was immediately disappointed to see Gareth Jones wasn&#39;t in his usual seat. He had become her next target. She had quickly tired of Rupert, sure he was smart and good looking and his family were wealthy, but he was so possessive. He didn&#39;t like Ruby flirting with other boys. Well suck it up Rupert, you were now in the long line of ex&#39;s. Ruby had had her eyes on Gareth since the start of the new year. The boy had really matured over the break and his muscles were certainly something that caught Ruby&#39;s eye. She wondered what they felt like.<br />
<br />
With no Gareth around, Ruby took a seat beside Maddy and Stacey. They were wannabe&#39;s. If Ruby said jump they would say &quot;How high?&quot;. She was also curious to know whether Stacey had been told yet that she was on the cheerleading team.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see you found another uniform. Do you have my outfit?&quot; asked Stacy.<br />
<br />
Ruby had no idea what the girl was talking about. &quot;What do you mean?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My cheerleading uniform that I lent you. What did you do with it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;So you know that you are in the team? Good. I knew you were in as soon as I gave my recommendations&quot;<br />
<br />
Now it was Stacey&#39;s turn to look bemused. <br />
<br />
&quot;The whole school knows about your incident in the boys shower&quot; Maddy informed Ruby.<br />
<br />
Ruby once more was puzzled &quot;Boy&#39;s shower?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what everyone is saying. That you were found naked in the boys shower in the gym. Mr Cotter had to wrap you in a towel and took you to his office. Evidently you gave him an eye-full&quot;<br />
<br />
Ruby had been in the boys shower earlier in the week. She and Rupert had enjoyed a quickie. She regretted that now, especially as she had lost a bra as she had quickly redressed. Rupert had childishly refused to give it back to her and she had to dress without it. Another reason that Rupert was now an ex. But Ruby had no recollection of Mr Cotter catching her. &quot;When was this supposed to have happened? It&#39;s a lie&quot; Was Rupert spreading malicious gossip about her? He had no reason to. She hadn&#39;t yet told him they were breaking up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well what happened then? How did you end up wearing Mr Jacobs&#39;s suit?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Ruby had raised her voice. The whole room was now listening<br />
<br />
&quot;In the toilets. You were hiding there. You were wearing a suit of Mr Jacobs and Stacey gave you her cheerleader dress. Did you bump your head or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your lying!&quot;<br />
<br />
A boy chimed in. He must have been listening to the conversation &quot;I was a witness! I was in the gym when Mr Cotter bought her out of the change rooms. She was just in a towel and we all got a flash. I just wish I had my phone and had snapped a picture&quot; The whole room laughed. <br />
<br />
Ruby looked in horror around the room. Everyone was looking at her and laughing. Someone was telling a lie at her expense. Her eyes bored into Harry Goater, the boy who had spoken. He was a geek and had never ever dared to speak to her before today. Who had put him up to this lie? Ruby could feel herself blushing. This was too much. She had to get out of here. She picked up her books and fled the room, brushing past the teacher as she walked in.</p>
