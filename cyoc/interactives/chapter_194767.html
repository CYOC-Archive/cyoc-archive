<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Once you&#39;ve added the mixture to the dish, just press your fingers lightly into the top to make the indentations and put it into the oven for about fifty minutes. You&#39;ll know it&#39;s done when the top turns a nice caramel orange,&quot; Marjatta explained excitedly across the table to Theresa, Bix, Otso, and Michael, who had joined Clyde&#39;s Parents for a &#39;small&#39; dinner. This was, of course, a misnomer as she had clearly spent most of the day preparing the assortment of dishes set before them. She was currently describing her Porkkanalaatikko--a carrot-based dish that had been a favorite at the table. Or at least for those in attendance who could eat it. She had also prepared a respectable pair of lamb shanks, which Otso and Michael were in the process of picking clean.<br />
<br />
Theresa found her thoughts drifting as the doe prattled on. Clyde&#39;s mother was delightful because <i>of course she would be</i>. A twinge of jealousy gnawed at the back of her mind as she nodded along, pretending to listen while she judged her competition. <i>No wonder Eric and Clyde would spend so many evenings at her house after Practice.</i> Her ear flicked as she narrowed her eyes. <i>What was so great about this Reindeer woman that Eric would prefer to spend time with her over his own mother?</i> She realized she was sneering subconsciously as the conversation came back into focus when Bix patted her hooved hand and gave her a look, which Michael mirrored from across the table.<br />
<br />
She blinked and improvised quickly, &quot;I&#39;m sure I&#39;d find a way to mess it up, but I&#39;d love to try making it! Would you be willing to write it down so I can try?&quot; <i>She couldn&#39;t even pronounce the damn dish.</i> As a nurse, her bedside manner had improved her soft skills and the awkward moment passed, seemingly unnoticed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course! And you <i>must</i> share some of your recipes with me in return, sisar! I want to know what Eric likes to eat. He&#39;s still so <i>laiha</i>.&quot; She laughed lightly as she smiled at Rudolph, who sat beside her.<br />
<br />
The rest of the dinner passed uneventfully as they discussed recent events and made potential plans for the future. &quot;You make a very handsome wolf, Michael. Your coat is gorgeous.&quot; and &quot;I have a beautiful piece that would go wonderfully with your dress, Theresa. Don&#39;t leave without reminding me. I&#39;d love it if you took it off my hooves.&quot; Eric and Clyde were a favored topic, of course, as they discussed the new reindeer&#39;s relationship and inevitable mating ceremony. The boys were to make things official on New Years Day, which everyone agreed was fitting and adorably romantic. Marjatta mused idly about her hope for grandfoals in the not-too-distant future, which she found strange.<br />
<br />
They also discussed the recent power outages, which were increasing in frequency and severity. &quot;I&#39;ve never seen anything like it before. I wonder if it&#39;s due to the new resort?&quot; &quot;No, can&#39;t be. Santa just must be overworked. I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll sort it all out soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before they left, Marjatta had insisted on giving her a delicate broach, which featured rubies surrounded by green glass leaves resembling sprigs of holly. It did, in fact, look beautiful when paired with the velvet red dress she wore, which Bix had surprised her with earlier in the day; he&#39;d stopped by Johann&#39;s on the way home. They also found themselves laden with bundles of leftovers, which the hosts insisted they take home with them. <i>Ugh. Clyde&#39;s parents were the WORST!</i><br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
The flight back to the cabin at the resort was turbulent. Despite his best efforts that week, Bix had been unable to teach Theresa to fly much beyond a clumsy hover, and instead carried her in his arms. (Theresa actually preferred it that way, to be honest, though she was starting to see the appeal of being able to fly. Commuting would be very different if and when she figured it out.) However, on the way back, Bix had apparently lost control as they began to tumble through the air. He quickly recovered, but it was enough to put them both on edge as they finally landed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god! Are you feeling OK? What happened back there?&quot; She asked, heart still hammering in her chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. It felt like the air gave out from under me. I&#39;ve never felt that before.&quot; Tess found Bix easy to read despite his tough exterior, and his genuine bafflement concerned her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you should stay here tonight. We should have Otso check you out just to be safe and I don&#39;t want anything happening to you on your way back. We can call him in the morning.&quot; She gave him a look, and he nodded before following inside as he shifted to his human form. They&#39;d made a previous compromise: reindeer form at Bix&#39;s house and human form at Tess&#39;s cabin, where she still spent most of her nights. She likewise took off the transformation collar as the fur sucked back into her body and she shrunk, the dress straps barely staying on her shoulders.<br />
<br />
Bix returned from putting the leftovers in the fridge and started towards the couch, intending to get comfortable, but stopped in his tracks as she put her hand on his chest, which was exposed under the harness he wore. His size between forms was relatively similar, and the garment still fit him in a very flattering way. Her fingers traced through the thick brown and grey hair on his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;You should sleep in the bed with me tonight.&quot; He looked at her in surprise and she laughed at his cute expression. Despite their growing familiarity and obvious attraction, they had refrained from doing anything aside from some light kissing since she had first changed into a reindeer. Having been a direct witness to the trademark Laine willpower, or lack thereof, she wanted to take things slow instead of just jumping into bed. Bix had even attended a Christmas Cookie class with her, though he was even worse at it than Lars had been.<br />
<br />
Tess stepped forward and pressed her lips to Bix&#39;s as she pressed herself into his body. His arms surrounded her and they breathed into each other as their tongues met. She pulled back and winked at him before she took his hand and led him to the bedroom. He followed obediently and stood as she turned around before making a show of pushing the straps off of her shoulders as the dress dropped to the floor leaving her naked. Reindeer didn&#39;t wear underwear.<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Säteilevä</i>,&quot; Bix whispered in a low voice as his eyes traced along her buxom breasts before he brought up a hand to caress one, dragging his thumb across her erect nipple as he pulled her into another kiss. Tess moaned as she busied herself with freeing the monster from his pants, which while smaller than in reindeer form was still quite girthy. She took it into her hand as she used her other to work at his harness, which soon joined her dress on the floor. He grunted and thrust into her palm as he pulled her tighter, pinching at her nipple.<br />
<br />
They fell onto the bed together, Tess on top, as Bix began to nibble at her neck--his thick beard tickling her and sending pleasurable tingles straight to her pussy, which moistened with need as she worked his cock in her hands, their legs entwining. He had both hands on her breasts now, massaging them as they ground into each other.<br />
<br />
For all his machismo, Bix was a gentle lover and seemed to follow Tess&#39;s lead. This suited her naturally assertive nature, however, and she was soon straddling his legs. Tess smiled down at him, enjoying seeing the man worked up so, as she lowered herself onto his cock, glistening and ready, before rocking back and forth as he stretched her open. He was <i>thick</i>, but she could feel each throbbing vein as she bounced up and down, his hands still on her chest.<br />
<br />
Tess was getting close when suddenly Bix grunted and she felt his already sizeable cock grow inside of her. The shock in his eyes and the sudden increased ache inside of her sent her into space as she cried loudly in her first of what would be several intense orgasms that night.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
They lay naked on the bed hours later, sweaty and content as they lazily alternated between talking and light kissing. Bix&#39;s reindeer shaft lay half-erect across his leg, spent but still aroused as Theresa felt a calm satisfaction wash over her. She couldn&#39;t remember the last time she&#39;d been fucked like that, and she wanted to do it again. She loved how happy Bix looked to be with her in this moment, and she very nearly climbed on top of him again for another go.<br />
<br />
Theresa was relieved to find that she was still completely herself after their passionate sex--a good omen. She couldn&#39;t wait to ride him again in the morning as they drifted off in each other&#39;s arms as the power went out again.</p>
