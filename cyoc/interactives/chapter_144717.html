<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake changed his measurement back to the whopping 11 inches that Katie had grown accustomed to. This size was almost farcical; he couldn&#39;t wear most shorts, underwear was a hassle, and walking around was still a chore of its own. But dammit if it wasn&#39;t worth it. He&#39;d turned his size queen of a girlfriend into a bit of a cuckquean. He had started testing the limits of his new-found dominance in the relationship by first signing &quot;them&quot; up on dating apps and bringing women home for threesomes. Then, on nights when she was too tired to go out, he would go out alone and bring a woman back. He quickly trained her to accept that his larger size just meant that he had a larger-than-average libido to go with it. It wasn&#39;t that he loved her any less; he was simply fulfilling a base need. Somewhere between being awestruck over his size and genuinely concerned for his happiness and well-being, Katie started to rationalize this behavior. By the end of a month of this, Katie was actively recruiting women for Jake, and would often watch and wait to &quot;clean up&quot; her man.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, Katie needed very little convincing to go along with the measuring contest.<br />
<br />
Liz, on the other hand, was a little hesitant. She didn&#39;t mind the thought of having sex with the biggest man in the room, even if it turned out that it wasn&#39;t her boyfriend; rather, Liz was worried about Josh. She&#39;d measured him herself last time, and he just wasn&#39;t big enough. And it clearly had gotten to him-- they hadn&#39;t had sex since that night. In fact, Josh was actively avoiding all her advances. One time, when things were heating up, he jumped up from the couch and ran out the door as he started muttering &quot;I am more than my inch. I am more than my inch...&quot; Liz couldn&#39;t put Josh through that again. She knew it would just crush him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Josh, I&#39;m just worried: what if you lose again?&quot; Liz texted him in response. Their relationship had hit a bit of a rough patch, and Josh suggested that they &quot;spend some time apart&quot; a few weeks back.<br />
<br />
Almost instantly, she got a picture message response. It was the biggest dick Liz had ever seen in real life. The thing had to be at least nine inches. And, with that, Liz was in. Unfortunately for Josh, her next series of picture messages made him throw his phone across the room before he came and suffered the fate of a deflated penis. <br />
<br />
On the Big Day, the room was overflowing with hyperconfidence and lust. Josh was the worst off: he&#39;d never been bigger than he was tonight (he measured himself in the morning at 9.5&quot;) and he was holding back a month&#39;s worth of cum. He couldn&#39;t wait to stick his fat dick between Katie&#39;s tits and explode all over her face. He also couldn&#39;t wait to see the look of dismay on Jake&#39;s face when he saw the monster cock that he helped make.<br />
<br />
Dinner was more of a formality than anything else. They hardly talked, their knives scraped into the plates as they carved their meat with too much force. They practically inhaled the food, and they all drank way too much wine way too quickly, trying and failing to feed the deep hunger they all felt. Katie kept eyeing Liz with looks shifting between smug superiority and lustful desire. Tonight, Katie decided, she wouldn&#39;t let Liz have her man to herself. Tonight, she was going to show Jake that she was more than enough. She&#39;d run him ragged, make him so tired and sore that he&#39;d pass out way before she was finished. She&#39;d show him that HE would have to keep up with her. She was tired of sharing him, and she was going to use Liz to prove her point.<br />
<br />
Liz, on the other hand, was tired of Katie&#39;s new attitude. Ever since that first measurement, Katie was constantly treating Liz like a lesser person in small, subtle ways. And, at least for tonight, Katie&#39;s improper sense of superiority was going to get smacked down into the ground when Josh whipped out his new monster cock. Liz started unconsciously rubbing Josh&#39;s thigh under the table. Then, her hand found its way around his large shaft. When she made contact, she realized what she was doing, and just before she tore herself away and regained her composure, she gave it a quick squeeze. Josh let out a quick breath and shuddered.<br />
<br />
Katie, not to be outdone, spent the desert course with her foot in Jake&#39;s crotch, playing with the head of his dick through his trousers. After only a few moments of this, Jake slammed down his fork and stood up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s just cut to the chase.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;About fucking time,&quot; Katie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck yes.&quot; Josh and Liz said simultaneously. The two, even with a month apart, were still so in sync with one another. Jake almost regretted how much he was going to humiliate his friend. He targeted Josh&#39;s dick with the watch, and adjusted the size to &quot;3.74 inches&quot;. He knew changing the size this drastically was a bit of a risk, but on the other hand, who in the world would believe that there was a magical watch that could change the size of a man&#39;s dick?<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, losers first,&quot; Jake smugly said as he pressed &quot;confirm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh scowled at Jake, and in that moment of rage, his brain ignored very important messages from his lower body about some vital changes. Liz practically clawed at Josh&#39;s pants, wanting nothing more than to release that monster cock in the photo Jake sent to her last night. As Liz pulled down Josh&#39;s boxers, he stared lustfully at Katie, confident in his all-too-certain victory tonight. Liz&#39;s thumbs hooked around his waistband and began moving downward. He couldn&#39;t wait to see what those huge tits looked like when they weren&#39;t trapped under all those clothes. He felt his waistband clear the last inch of his erection, freeing his cock and sending it springing upward, a little sooner than he expected. Liz must be working fast tonight. He was going to make Katie&#39;s phat ass jiggle as he grabbed her tiny waist and--<br />
<br />
Katie burst into laughter. Josh instinctively looked behind him, confused by her reaction. When he looked back, Katie was doubled over, one hand pointing at his crotch and the other with her index finger and thumb pinched very close together. Jake was also looking at him, filled with the biggest grin in his life. Terrified that he was missing something huge (and he was), Josh followed their gaze downward. He saw Liz&#39;s face: horror-stricken, and it looked like she was on the verge of tears. What was she so afraid of? Was he too huge for her to comprehend? Then, he felt her hand grab his fully-erect penis. He felt it wrap around his dick. That wasn&#39;t right. At this size he should-- oh. Oh no. He could feel his entire dick covered in one hand. How could this be? What happened to his massive dick? It was right here just a moment ago, wasn&#39;t it? Didn&#39;t he feel it rising up along his thigh as Liz&#39;s fingertips traced their way along his shaft? Didn&#39;t she squeeze a handful and still have more spilling out of her hand? Or was that something he imagined?<br />
<br />
Katie, seizing her moment, came over to Josh with the measuring tape.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooone... twooo.... threeee... oh. The wittle guy couldn&#39;t make it to fowr, could he?&quot;<br />
<br />
Liz, not thinking it through, reactively looked down at the tape measure and blurted, &quot;Hey! It&#39;s almost four! It&#39;s three-and-three-quarters!&quot; Only after the words tumbled artlessly out of her mouth that she had done nothing to help her man&#39;s ego; in fact, she&#39;d made a bad situation worse.<br />
<br />
Katie simply laughed and said, &quot;ummm, well, actually, it&#39;s *almost* at the three-quarter mark. He didn&#39;t quite make it there. But I tell you what, for wittle Joshy&#39;s sake, let&#39;s go ahead and round up to a whole four inches. I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll matter much.&quot; Liz looked up at Josh, mouthing &quot;I&#39;m so sorry&quot; but Josh was lost in a cloud of rage and sadness. She tried to console him by putting his little dick in her mouth, trying to maybe push out an extra quarter of an inch and get him to four inches, but he pushed her away. He didn&#39;t mean to, but his current mental state and his roided-up body pushed Liz a little too hard, sending her across the room and busting up her lip as her face hit the ground. How had she missed this side of him? Maybe all this time apart was letting her see the real Josh, in more ways than one.<br />
<br />
Katie grabbed her man by the bulge and pulled him closer to the action. Jake, deciding that there&#39;s no kill quite like overkill, made a last minute adjustment to his own cock, pushing it to a full foot-long.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, let&#39;s see if Jake can compete with big Joshy over there.&quot; Jake&#39;s full twelve inches sprung out, slapping the recently-recovered Liz in the back of the head. Liz turned around to see what had hit her and practically shrieked at the massive beast right in front of her nose. Katie placed the tape in Liz&#39;s hands and guided them towards Jake&#39;s cock. &quot;It&#39;s only fair for you to measure my Jake, since I measured little Joshy over there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Liz was practically hypnotized. She&#39;d never seen a dick this big before. She wasn&#39;t even certain if she could take even half of it, or any of it at all-- it was so thick. Jake looked down at her, and then up at Josh, staring Josh right in the eyes until Josh looked away. This was the final nail in the coffin. Josh broke down and started quietly sobbing as he shuffled his way over to the couch and hid his face in his hands.<br />
<br />
Liz counted out the inches in a dream-like state:<br />
<br />
&quot;One...&quot;<br />
<br />
It felt like a lifetime between every announced inch to Josh. Liz was definitely taking her time, admiring and holding Jake&#39;s huge cock. Unconsciously licking her lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Twoo...&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh looked up at his girlfriend practically drooling over another man&#39;s cock, measuring out just how much more of a man he was.<br />
<br />
&quot;three... &quot;<br />
<br />
Jake snapped his fingers at Katie and then pointed at Liz. A moment later, Katie was kneeling next to Liz, slowly moving her hands around Liz&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
&quot;fooour...&quot;<br />
<br />
This was it. The game was already over, but nobody was stopping it. Josh wanted more than anything to make it stop, but he couldn&#39;t find the willpower to stand up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fiiiive....&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie&#39;s soft hands felt so good to Liz. When the hands started unfastening her bra and removing her clothes, Liz unconsciously moved around  to help get the clothes off a little easier. Her little B-cups jiggled as she moved.<br />
<br />
&quot;Siiix... Seven...&quot;<br />
<br />
Liz started picking up the pace, eager to find out just how big this thing was. But she didn&#39;t want to rush any of this. She wanted to savor every second with this beast. There was a faint memory of coming to this dinner with some other guy, but that was hardly an important thought right now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eight... Nine... Ten...&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie had moved from just massaging to now kissing and licking her way down Liz&#39;s body. One of her hands found its way to Liz&#39;s wet opening.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eleven... Twelve... Twelve?!&quot; Liz exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Twelve?!&quot; Katie echoed. She couldn&#39;t believe it. She&#39;d measured Jake a hundred times already. He wasn&#39;t a full foot, was he?<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit!&quot; Katie exclaimed as she double-checked Liz&#39;s work. &quot;Josh, you aren&#39;t even half the man Jake is--- hell, you&#39;re barely a third the man he is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Liz was still hypnotized by the titanic beast in front of her. Josh was fighting back tears as he stared helplessly at the scene. Katie simply looked up at Jake-- at HER man.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe,&quot; Jake said, &quot;we all agreed upon a prize for the winner?&quot;</p>
