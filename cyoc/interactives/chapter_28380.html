<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While the frightened diners scrambled for the exit, overturning the tables in their haste to <br />
reach the door, I watched Kelly prowl around the now empty restaurant, an idea forming in <br />
my mind. Her change had clearly been intoxicating for her, and I wanted to experience <br />
something similar. But I didn't want to become a werewolf - and nor, if I was honest, did I <br />
particularly wish to become a full animal, as she had.<br />
<br />
As Kelly began to nose around amongst the spilled food and broken crockery, I realised <br />
what I wanted to become. After all, we were in a restaurant, and restaurant kitchens are <br />
notorious for attracting one particular type of animal. Quietly, I whispered to myself, &quot;I <br />
wish that every time Kelly growls, I would transform partially into a wererat. By the time <br />
she growls for the tenth time, I will have transformed completely into my humanoid rat <br />
form.&quot;<br />
<br />
When I finished speaking, I felt the ring tingle slightly upon my finger. Uncertain if the <br />
wish was working, but keen to try it out, I looked over to my date. She had found a half-<br />
eaten steak amongs the spilled food and was... well, wolfing it down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Kelly!&quot; I called to her. At the sound of my voice, she raised her head and growled <br />
quizzically at me.<br />
<br />
Almost immediately, I felt my wish take effect. A strange tingling sensation washed over <br />
me, and my face began to itch. Running my tongue around my mouth, I found that my <br />
front teeth had grown in size. My vision blurred for a second, and when I turned to look at <br />
my reflection in the window, and found that my eyes had changed in colour, becoming a <br />
very dark brown, almost black.<br />
<br />
I turned back to Kelly, who was looking at me uncertainly. &quot;That's great. Do it again!&quot; I <br />
called. WIth a puzzled air, she growled again, and I felt the second change take place.<br />
<br />
This time, I felt my front teeth lengthening further, and my remaining teeth becoming <br />
sharper. My fingernails extended into short claws, and I could feel my toenails changing in <br />
the same way. &quot;And again,&quot; I shouted, my voice sounding harsher.<br />
<br />
Still puzzled, Kelly growled again. As she did so, my claws lengthened, and my upper lip <br />
began to prickle as whiskers forced their way through the skin. I could feel my ears <br />
stretching and moving up the sides of my head, as if someone were pulling on the tips.<br />
<br />
This time, my transformation must have been visible to Kelly, as she raised her hackles, <br />
and barked twice sharply in surprise.<br />
<br />
Almost immediately, I felt the fourth and fifth changes hit me. Coarse brown hairs began <br />
to sprout on the backs of my hands, then across my chest, and my face swelled into a <br />
short muzzle. There was a pause of a second or so, and then I felt the hair begin to grow <br />
again, this time across my entire body. My forehead retreated and my upper lip split in two <br />
as my front teeth began to protrude from my mouth. <br />
<br />
Turning again to look at my reflection in the window, I saw that I now had a pair of long, <br />
yellowish incisors, exactly like a rat's, jutting down over my bottom lip, which had receded <br />
to expose them. My eyes were almost completely black, with very little of the whites <br />
showing. The rest of my face was a mixture of human and animal features, with a <br />
medium-sized muzzle, and longish, pointed ears, covered in fine brown hairs.<br />
<br />
I turned back to Kelly. She must have guessed what I had wished for, because she growled <br />
again, experimentally.<br />
<br />
With the sixth change, my body began to reshape itself. New muscles swelled beneath my <br />
skin, although I did not change in stature. If anything, I could feel myself becoming <br />
thinner, as every spare ounce of fat was burned away. Tearing open my shirt with a long <br />
clawed hand, I saw that the contours of my ribs were clearly visible beneath the coat of <br />
brown fur that now covered my entire body.<br />
<br />
I glanced back at Kelly. She had lowered her hackles, and was wagging her tail slowly from <br />
side to side. Looking directly into my eyes, she growled again, softly.<br />
<br />
Instantly, I felt my feet beginning to lengthen, bursting open my sneakers and forcing me <br />
to alter my balance, as if I were standing on tiptoe. My thighs swelled, stretching the fabric <br />
of my jeans. Kelly growled again, with increasing excitement.<br />
<br />
This time, I could feel the changes sweeping up my spine. My back arched, forcing me into <br />
a half-hunched posture. As the remnants of my shirt fell away from me, I realised that I <br />
was no longer able to stand upright. Strangest of all, I felt the waistband of my jeans <br />
tighten uncomfortably, and I realised that the base of my spine was beginning to bulge <br />
outwards, straining the rear seam.<br />
<br />
Kelly must have realised what was happening, because I saw her looking at me strangely. If <br />
wolves could grin, I could swear she was grinning now. &quot;Hey, not yet!&quot; I tried to say, <br />
tugging at my belt. But my new front teeth made it difficult to shape the words, and in any <br />
case, my voice must have changed more than I had realised, because all that came out was <br />
an inarticulate screeching noise. Kelly growled, seductively.<br />
<br />
Immediately, I felt my spine lengthen again, forcing me to hunch over still further, my <br />
hands dangling beside my knees. I screeched again, this time in pain, as the bulge in the <br />
back of my jeans swelled outwards, before the seam came apart under the pressure. I <br />
could feel something slithering through the hole, then a strange weight on my back, as I <br />
felt the sensation of the cool air hitting a part of my body I hadn't had before. <br />
<br />
Turning around, I found that a thick, muscular tail, like that of a rat, had sprouted from <br />
the base of my spine. The skin there was naked and pink, apart from a few sparse white <br />
hairs. Experimentally, I twitched it from side to side.<br />
<br />
I turned back. Kelly was still grinning at me. Focusing my attention on my new lips and <br />
teeth, I summoned all of my concentration and, in a voice more animal than human, <br />
managed to ask, &quot;Grrrrrowl again. Last time now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kelly obliged, and with the tenth change, my transformation completed itself. My face <br />
extended into a long rat's snout, and the fur on my head grew out to meet my hair, which <br />
was now no more than a spiky mane running down the back of my neck. The fur on my <br />
back and thighs also coarsened and thickened, and my tail grew to its full length, swelling <br />
out behind me. By now, it must have been nearly six feet long.<br />
<br />
Kicking off what remained of my shoes, I stepped forwards to face Kelly, feeling the tip of <br />
my tail slither across the floor as I did so. If anyone had looked into the restaurant at that <br />
minute, they would have seen a wiry, semi-humanoid ratman, who looked equally capable <br />
of walking on all fours as standing upright, dressed only in the tattered remants of a pair <br />
of jeans. <br />
<br />
A large female wolf was looking at him from across the room, wagging her tail excitedly. I <br />
turned to Kelly and grinned, further exposing my long front teeth.</p>
