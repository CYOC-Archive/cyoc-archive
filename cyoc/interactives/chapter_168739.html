<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Archie awoke to sunlight streaming in his window. He felt odd, not to mention incredibly horny. He rolled over and immediately regretted it. His jeans were tight around his legs and his underwear was that sticky consistency that made it clear he&#39;d had a wet dream. Bleary-eyed, he struggled to get out of bed, managing to escape the sheets despite his jeans&#39; attempt to stop him. How the hell had they gotten so tight? He certainly regretted leaving them on when he went to bed... <br />
<br />
He stumbled out of his room and into the hallway, heading for the bathroom. He passed Patrick&#39;s room, and heard soft grunting from within. He paused. It didn&#39;t sound quite like Pat&#39;s usual voice--it was still a touch nasal, but deeper too. Archie shook his head and continued heading for the bathroom. <br />
<br />
When he passed Liu Wei&#39;s room, a different sound reached Archie&#39;s ears: the distinct slap-slap-slap of energetic cock-jerking. He nearly stumbled at that sound--Liu was usually so quiet and shy. But he couldn&#39;t help but grin, too. At least the guy was getting some relief! Man, was everybody as horny as he was that morning? <br />
<br />
Archie finally reached the bathroom, with its wide-open door. The lock was busted and since they were generally a pretty considerate group of students, everyone understood that a closed door mean the bathroom was occupied and to of course leave it open when you were finished. Archie closed the door behind him and began washing his hands and face in the sink. As he looked up at the mirror though, he paused. <br />
<br />
That... wasn&#39;t his reflection looking back...<br />
<br />
It sort of looked like him. Only a bigger, sexier version of himself. One who exercised. One who hadn&#39;t stopped growing at five-foot-six. Archie ran his fingers along his jaw, feeling the unfamiliar sensation of rough morning growth. The mirror showed the same. He stood still for a long moment, pondering the familiar-yet-foreign version of himself in the mirror. He stepped back, so that he could see more of his reflected dream--surely it was a dream, right? His tee shirt was tight around his upper body, hugging a strong, leanly-muscled torso and capable arms and shoulders. He looked down, and ran his hands down his chest, feeling firm muscle that he&#39;d never felt before. The hem of his shirt barely reached his waistband; he pulled it up, and saw that a six-pack had replaced his old flat-but-unremarkable middle. <br />
<br />
An old medical scale stood in the corner. Curious, Archie stepped on it, after extending the arm that measured height. He was six feet tall. He could hardly believe it--that was a full six inches more than before! Curious, he moved the weights on the scale as well. 175. He hadn&#39;t been an ounce over 125, before. It was unreal. It was unbelievable. His head was spinning...<br />
<br />
&quot;Five-ten. And two-twenty-five,&quot; came a deep, rough voice. <br />
<br />
Archie stumbled off of the scale and whirled to see who had intruded. The man who stood there... the man who stood there... well, he was something else! Clad only in a pair of skintight boxers that left nothing to the imagination, he seemed carved from stone, muscle bulging under the skin. Slightly shorter than Archie but definitely not smaller, the only thing that could possibly detract from his powerful body was the enormous bulge that jutted lewdly in his boxers. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m five-foot-ten. And two hundred and twenty-five pounds,&quot; the man repeated. He looked up at Archie as if in challenge. Those red-framed glasses were so familiar...<br />
<br />
&quot;Jamie?&quot; Archie gasped, finally matching the manly face and body to the guy that yesterday had been the smallest in a group of rather small guys. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; Jamie replied, his voice deep and rich, as he stepped in, not bothering to close the door behind him. &quot;You look good, Archie. Real good. I must say, you&#39;ve managed to find a good balance between jock and lean twink. A regular &#39;twunk,&#39; I think is what they say. Me? I just went for, ahem, &#39;mass.&#39;&quot; Jamie&#39;s pecs rose for a moment, striations appearing across the slabs of muscle, only to disappear as each plummeted back into place. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wha- what are you talking about?&quot; Archie asked, taking a step backwards. None of this made sense. His head was spinning. <br />
<br />
Jamie snorted in amusement. &quot;Your point last night, Arch. Remember? How Zeta Epsilon Chi was the better frat, and always would be? Well, I decided you were right, cutting their power wouldn&#39;t fix our problem. I had to think outside the box.&quot; He reached down and patted his protruding bulge. &quot;So last night, at midnight, I took some steps to fix our problem.&quot; <br />
<br />
Archie&#39;s head span even faster. &quot;No. Jamie, I--. No! I don&#39;t understand...&quot; He took a step back, bumping into the shower door. <br />
<br />
Jamie smirked, then slowly removed his red-framed glasses, and set them aside. &quot;You&#39;re looking at an anthropology major who&#39;s been on archaeological digs and is writing his honors thesis on ancient ritual. I was bound to dig something up eventually.&quot; He laughed at his own joke. His pecs bounced again. <br />
<br />
The blank expression on Archie&#39;s face revealed his utter confusion. Jamie sighed. &quot;Guess I&#39;ll have to show you, then...&quot; <br />
<br />
Archie gasped as he watched Jamie tear off his tight boxers, eyes widening at the sight of the hefty cock and balls that bounced free. Archie&#39;s mouth went dry at the sight of Jamie&#39;s big rod, which slowly swelled and extended, hardening, rising up, throbbing. It was huge, nine inches long at least, and deep red from blood. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hand jobs have gotten me this far,&quot; Jamie explained, &quot;But I bet a full on fucking would be even better!&quot; He strode forward, reaching out and grabbing Archie&#39;s shirt, tearing off his buddy&#39;s body. Archie&#39;s pants and underwear weren&#39;t far behind, and Archie was shocked to see that his own cock was fully hard and eight inches long. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nice,&quot; Jamie purred, running his fingers along Archie&#39;s shaft, &quot;But that&#39;s not what I want right now.&quot; He pulled his friend aside, opened the shower door, then pushed him in. Jamie followed a moment later, joining Archie in the small space. He reached around Archie&#39;s naked body and gripped his friend&#39;s rounded buttocks, squeezing them admiringly for a moment. &quot;Oh yeah, Arch, you turned out really nice...&quot; Jamie&#39;s voice was a low, breathy grow. <br />
<br />
As turned on as he was, Archie felt the need to protest. He opened his mouth, only to have it filled with Jamie&#39;s lips and tongue. After recovering from the shock, Archie felt himself reciprocating, kissing his shorter-yet-larger buddy back, running his hands over Jamie&#39;s powerful shoulders and arms. He didn&#39;t stop when Jamie reached for a tube of lubricant and slathered up his nine incher, nor did he stop when Jamie picked him up and pushed him against the tiled wall. Only when he felt Jamie&#39;s big dick enter him did Archie stop kissing the man who was filling the shower with him, and then it was only to let out a long, low moan of ecstasy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Jamie grunted, as he thrust his big dick into Archie&#39;s tight hole, &quot;I can feel it in me... fuck this is intense!&quot; <br />
<br />
Archie just groaned, feeling his virgin ass get spread apart by this muscular man&#39;s big tool. Yet as Archie&#39;s hands roamed Jamie&#39;s big shoulders and neck and traps, he slowly began to realize what was happening--Jamie was growing!  Not only were the man&#39;s muscles getting bigger, but he was growing taller too, pushing Archie&#39;s back further and further up the tiles. And the way Archie&#39;s ass was getting more and more stretched made one thing clear--Jamie&#39;s cock was growing as well! <br />
<br />
&quot;What... what&#39;s going on?&quot; Archie croaked, hardly able to form words due to the intense feelings of ecstasy that were racing through him. <br />
<br />
Jamie laughed, then provided a brief explanation, although it was interspersed with thrusts of his mighty dick into Archie. &quot;The right... artifacts! The right... ritual! The right... ancient language! The right... sacrifice!&quot; He paused, breathing heavily, his dick rammed deep into Archie. &quot;And if you do it all right,&quot; he continued, &quot;You get the kind of magic power that changes you and those nearby!&quot;<br />
<br />
With that Jamie resumed thrusting, slamming his big dick deep into Archie, growling like a beast as he fucked the fraternity&#39;s leader. Jamie grew larger and larger, his muscles blossoming, until he was bigger than Zach, the previous object of Zach&#39;s lust. With a mighty roar Jamie came, his giant dick violently spasming inside Archie&#39;s ass, pumping the smaller man full of his musclefreak seed. Jamie panted heavily, his giant body pressed against Archie&#39;s smaller one. Archie&#39;s own dick was pressed against the larger man&#39;s brick-wall abs, having shot its load half-way through. <br />
<br />
Jamie chuckled softly, his voice deep and rich, sexier than Zach&#39;s even. &quot;Fuck, that was incredible,&quot; he rumbled, before slowly stepping backwards out of the shower, holding Archie in place, impaled on his big dick. The two of them thus turned together, and they both saw half a dozen sets of eyes, peering through the open door, eyes wide and cocks in hand. &quot;You see how this works, boys,&quot; Jamie rumbled. &quot;You fuck, you grow!&quot; <br />
<br />
The peering eyes blinked, then vanished after a moment, as the owners fled to nearby bedrooms, eager to relieve their horniness with each other. <br />
<br />
Jamie chuckled again, watching them go. &quot;The magic won&#39;t last forever--just until midnight. And I already have a big head start on them, so they probably won&#39;t grow like I did. Especially since I&#39;m the one who performed the ritual--extra juice, you know? Still, things are changing, Arch. Zeta Epsilon Chi won&#39;t know what hit them!&quot;</p>
