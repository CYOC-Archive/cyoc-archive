<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ben and Kenya spent the next hour laughing at bad jokes and awkward flirting techniques.  They both felt relaxed and quite happy to be in each other&#39;s company.<br />
<br />
&quot;So tell me Ben, &quot;  Kenya said as she got her laughter under control, &quot;did you and your family move out here to Moon Lake or were you born here?&quot;  She looked up at him and noticed a wistful look on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I was actually born here in Moon Lake.   Both my mom and dad were werewolves and so I was born one too.&quot;  He sighs softly and a sad look crosses his face.  &quot;When I was very young,  I lost both my parents in a car accident.  I remember being scared and alone for a long time.&quot;  Ben felt Kenya&#39;s paw on his bicep.  She gave him a comforting squeeze.  He turned and gave her a warm smile before continuing. <br />
<br />
&quot;I ended up in foster care for a little while.  I didn&#39;t have any other family in Moon Lake.  Then a friend of my parents took me in and later adopted me.  Samantha Twist.  Samantha and her wife,  Frances,  became my new moms.&quot;  Kenya watched his face as it softened and a small smile graced his lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Both of you moms are werecats?&quot;  Ben nodded and Kenya got a thoughtful look on her face.  &quot;I thought  I picked up the scent of werecats on you.  It&#39;s faint but it&#39;s there.  I just didn&#39;t know it came from your folks.&quot;  She leans in close and rubs her cheek against his arm.  &quot;I can tell you love them both very much and they did a good job of raising you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben began to blush at her words.  It&#39;s true.  He loved his moms very much.  There were some days when he wondered where he would be if they hadn&#39;t taken him in.  He shook his head of those negative thoughts before clearing his throat and asking Kenya the same question.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was actually born in New York City.  My mom and dad are both wereleopards.  It was only by chance I was born a werepanther.&quot;  She smiled at the shocked look on Ben&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I knew there were other weres outside of Moon Lake,  but to have them is such a busy city like New York.   That&#39;s incredible. &quot;<br />
<br />
Kenya shrugged.  &quot;It&#39;s a challenge to be sure.  Everyone has a cellphone,  ATMs have cameras,  traffic lights have cameras,  and most buildings have security cameras.  There are a lot of ways for a werebeast to get caught.  We had to be careful all the time.  Luckily there is a network set up in the city so that weres can look out for one another.  It makes things a little easier.  Wererats and wereraccoons are the best when it comes to getting things you need or finding spots in the city where a werebeast can stretch  their legs and not have to worry about cameras.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Kenya leans against Ben&#39;s side and she recalls her first run through Central Park as a werepanther.  She was caught by a patrolling officer.  Lucky for her he was a weredog and he let her go with a warning to be more careful.  Ever since then she learned to be really quiet and to blend into the shadows.  It was at this point that Ben realizes just how much he takes living in Moon Lake for granted.   Living in a city were people didn&#39;t know you existed must have been stressful.<br />
<br />
&quot;High school was very stressful for me.  I had just hit puberty,  went through my first change,  and was worried about my grades.  There were only a handful of other weres that went to the same school I did.  Sticking with them helped greatly.&quot;  Kenya curled into Ben&#39;s side more and he wrapped his arm around her.<br />
<br />
&quot;It took a lot of work on my part but I graduated from high school with decent grades.  My parents saw what a toll it all had on me so they suggested I stay with my aunt and uncle in Moon Lake for awhile.  I could attend college there in a more relaxed environment and I can concentrate on my classes better.&quot;  Ben looked down at her abit surprised.<br />
<br />
&quot;How long have you been here in Moon Lake? &quot;<br />
<br />
Kenya gave him a warm smile.  &quot;Oh,  just this past summer.  I haven&#39;t been here long but I really like it here.  I&#39;ve spent so much time applying for college,  taking entrance exams,  making sure I  had my finances in order,  and helping my aunt and uncle at their shot that I haven&#39;t had a chance to look around this town.&quot;  She laughs at the baffled look Ben was giving her.  She was starting to blush under her dark fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well maybe I can show you around sometime.&quot;  Ben graced Kenya with a toothy grin that made her giggle softly.<br />
<br />
Kenya nodded and squeezed his arm.  &quot;I&#39;d like that a lot.  Maybe you can show me a few places where I can have fun or just relax.&quot;<br />
<br />
They both sat on the fallen log in silence just enjoying each other&#39;s warmth when Ben&#39;s phone began to beep.  Kenya didn&#39;t even notice he had it hanging around his neck.  She hoped it wasn&#39;t damaged from their little dip in the river.  He took it off from around his neck and checked the time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shoot!  It&#39;s getting late.  I promised my moms I wouldn&#39;t be out too late.  It&#39;s a school night. &quot;  he gave her a sheepish grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah!  You&#39;re right.  I have classes too.  I should be heading home as well.&quot;  She pulled away from Ben slowly and frowned at the loss of warmth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,  could I get your cellphone number?  I really like talking with you and we can get together to hang out sometime.&quot;  Kenya smiled and happily gave him her number.  She stood up and leaned in close to kiss Ben on the cheek.  She giggled at the dopey grin on his face.  He stood up and engulfed her into another warm hug.  They stayed like that for a few minutes before slowly drifting apart.<br />
<br />
Kenya began to walk off towards her home.  She was keenly aware of Ben watching her butt.  She giggled and put an extra sway in her hips.  She looked over her shoulder and gave him a mischievous grin before wishing him a good night and disappearing into the forest.<br />
<br />
Ben was left standing there with the same goofy grin on his muzzle.  He really did have a nice time tonight and hoped to have more.  He turned in the opposite direction and bounded off towards home.</p>
