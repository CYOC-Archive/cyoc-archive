<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The door bell dinged as Trevor Hatton stepped inside the antique shop. He was a brown haired white man in his early twenties of average height who was there to see about a certain watch he heard was there. You see four years ago Trevor through a stroke of luck won the lottery and after taxes recieved over seven million dollars. Because he wasn&#39;t greedy and also hired a good financial advisor he was basically set for life. And thanks to newfound wealth and the endless free time it afforded him it allowed him to pursue a certain venture his, a way to make himself young. But Trevor didn&#39;t want to become young for the typical vain reason. No, he wanted to become young because of his secret fetish. You see another thing to know about Trevor was that he was an abdl. Although he was one of those who wished they could regress and return to their diaper days for real. So to that end he set out to find an actual fountain of youth, paying for information leading to anything be it science or magic that would take him back. After years of dead ends and false leads Trevor had begun to lose hope...that is until a paid contact told him about an old stopwatch that could control time. It wasn&#39;t until he heard that it could alter the phyiscal age of the user that he demanded to know its location. To his surprise the watch was collecting dust in an antique shop not far from where he lived.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, how can I help you today?&quot; the store owner, a middle aged man asked his latest customer as he entered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I&#39;m looking for an antique watch&quot; Trevor replied without missing a beat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh in that case have yourself a look. They&#39;re all right here&quot; he said tapping the glass display counter.<br />
<br />
Trevor walked over and browsed the selection of miniature clocks. Though he saw which one it was right away thanks to his contact&#39;s description of the time piece, he pretended to take his time for a couple of minutes to avoid suspicion.<br />
<br />
&quot;That one there. I&#39;ll take that one&quot; Trevor said pointing to the master stopwatch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure? You should know it doesn&#39;t even work, can&#39;t wind it up for some reason. Mainly an antique I keep around for display purposes. Also it&#39;s pretty pricey&quot; the man replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn&#39;t matter, how much for it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Five hundred&quot; came his reply.<br />
<br />
No wonder the thing hadn&#39;t sold yet as there was no way anyone coming through would fork over that kind of money for an outdated relic that didn&#39;t even work. Thankfully Trevor had the foresight to bring along five thousand in cash with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here you go&quot; he said fishing out five hundred dollar bills along with two twenties, &quot;Keep the change.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man smiled at the generosity, &quot;Thank you for that.&quot; He then printed up a receipt before removing the stop watch from the display case. &quot;Would you like a bag?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No thanks&quot; Trevor smiled as the time piece and slip of paper were handed over to him, stuffing both in his pocket.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you happen to have a bathroom I can use by anything chance?&quot;<br />
<br />
He was hoping that they did as he needed to find out if his purchase was genuine. Even if it wasn&#39;t Trevor planned on keeping it as it looked cool. Plus he didn&#39;t want to rob the owner of such a big paying sale.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, it&#39;s in the back. Here&#39;s the key.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thanking the man Trevor moved as quickly as was normal to the restroom, opening the door and locking himself inside. Once certain he was safe from prying eyes did he pull out the stopwatch. There was a reason the watch appeared broken and that was because it had to be wound a specific way, almost like a combination lock. And thanks once again to his contact he knew how to activate it. Following the instructions he memorized beforehand Trevor smiled as the watch whirred to life in his palm, the hands moving to 22, his current age. Looking over the device and its buttons he found the plus and minus buttons along with the directional buttons.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here goes nothing&quot; Trevor said with hope as he pushed on the minus while facing the mirror above the sink. His mouth dropped open in shock as he visibly grew younger right before his eyes. The regression was just like he imagined it would be, his facial hair disappeared and he lost a bit of height and his clothes became looser on his body. Trevor was so stunned by the transformation that he held the button for longer than he intended. Letting go he found himself staring at a 17 year old him. He had turned himself back into a teenager when only planned to save off two or three years. Regardless it proved the watch really had the power to control time. The only test left was to see if it could reverse the regression, otherwise leaving the shop would became alot more complicated. Pressing down on the plus button Trevor was relieved but also slightly disappointed when he grew back up to his original age as he was more interested in heading in the opposite direction age wise. But he knew had to wait until he got back home before using the stopwatch for it&#39;s intended purpose.<br />
<br />
Excitement welling up inside him Trevor exited the bathroom after flushing the toilet to sell the ruse that he had been in there to use it. Handing back the key and the thanking the owner once again Trevor hopped in his car and jumped on the interstate. Though he wanted to head straight home he made a detour to the nearest Target to pick up some supplies, namely baby powder, wipes and a 168 count box of Pampers crusiers size 4 disposable diapers. While a tad excessive Trevor wanted to be absolutely sure he didn&#39;t run out of his soon to be wearable bathroom. Already thoughts of being in the baby-sized crinkly padding and making peepee and poopoo in them flooded his mind. It was all he could do to keep it under the speed limit as a ticket would just delay him.<br />
<br />
Forty minutes later Trevor pulled into the suburban neighborhood he lived in. Though with the money he had he could be living it up in a mansion on an estate, Trevor preferred a simpler lifestyle. However that didn&#39;t mean he didn&#39;t treat himself as his was one of the best houses on the block, a lovely well furnished two story with a large walled in backyard complete with a covered patio and swimming pool. As soon as the car was parked in the garage Trevor threw open the door, pausing long enough to grab the bags of his purchases before high tailing it up to his bedroom. Not even bothering to close the door he threw down the supplies in the floor, hands automatically reaching for the box of Pampers. With a mad fury he ripped open the top flaps, inhaling the sweet perfumed scent and gazing longingly at the stacks of folded padding.<br />
<br />
Grabbing the rectangular mirror hanging above his dresser Trevor propped it up long ways against the wall so he could have a view of his descent back into babyhood. Standing in front of it he removed the master stopwatch from his pocket, his fingers itching to use it. But first he needed to know what age he was going to regress to. It had to be an age where it wouldn&#39;t be usual for him to still be in diapers. 5 and above were much too old in his opinion to still not be potty trained. So logically any below that would be a perfect diaper age. The only question was how young he wanted to get.<br />
<br />
Trevor thought long and hard, or at least as long as his already stretched patience would allow before using the stopwatch to make himself...</p>
