<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“…that wassss a conccccern which issss why their venom glandssss were removed.”  Brock finished answering.  <br />
<br />
“In other words, even if they were to bite someone, it wouldn’t be dangerous?”  The reporter asked, visibly calmer now.  <br />
<br />
“Well they won’t inject venom into anyone, but that’sss only if they were to do sssso.”  Haley answered.  “And we have been making effortssss to teach them not to.”  <br />
<br />
“Efforts?”  <br />
<br />
“Assss in showing them how to behave, the baby-proofing you ssssee to make sure they ssstay out of placccessss they shouldn’t be, and of coursssse making ssssure we’re alwayssss with them.”  Brock explained.  <br />
<br />
“Though you’ve already said they’re independent.”  <br />
<br />
“In a manner of sssspeaking.”  Haley tried to clarify.  “What the doctor’ssss believe isss that mentally ssspeaking, they’re already quite developed, but not completely.”  <br />
<br />
“You ssssee, for a normal mundane sssnake, they’re born mentally mature at the outssssset, but given that the Animatrixxx Ssserum ressssultsss in mixing two genetic codessss together, what they believe issss that they’re quite young mentally, and ssstill need a few yearssss to mature.”  Brock added.  <br />
<br />
“So still very child-like then?”  <br />
<br />
“That would be correct.”  Brock answered.  “Which isss why they ssseem calm around ussss, and recognise usss.”  <br />
<br />
“I see.”  The reporter replied much more calmly.  “So where might they be?”  <br />
<br />
“In the playroom we sset up for them.”  Haley answered.  “Thisss way.”  They led him to an adjacent room that had a barrier set on the doorframe and past it, three very small children whose gender could only be identified by what they were wearing.  <br />
<br />
“So how can you tell who’s who?”  He asked them.  <br />
<br />
“If you look clossssely, you’ll noticcce that the coloursss and patternssss are ssslightly different.”  Brock replied.  “And myssself and Haley can sssee the differencccesssss.”  <br />
<br />
“I see, and it is rather warm in here.”  <br />
<br />
“That would be on account of our being more cold-blooded than we ussssed to be, and essspecially for their sssakessss.”  Haley gave the reason.  “Sssincce ssnakesss and other reptilesss are not warm-blooded and need the sssurrounding environment for temperature regulation.”  <br />
<br />
“They think that with our sssize, me and Haley can moderate our body temperature to a degree, but for Linda, Ruth, and Paul.”  He pointed to each of them in turn.  “They need the environment to remain active and healthy until they‘re older, and larger.”  <br />
<br />
“Clearly quite different to how a human is raised then.”  <br />
<br />
“In many wayssss, yesss.  But sssome ssimilaritiessss remain.”  Haley replied.  <br />
<br />
The rest of the segment was taken up by Brock and Haley showing their children to the reporter, highlighting the differences in their markings and patterns that allowed them to tell who was who.  The fact that they reacted to their names being a noted detail.  The children themselves looked to be very inquisitive, almost looking like they had at the very least a vague idea as to what was happening around them.  The last small portion was used to show how they’d adapted to life as Vipers, such as adapted clothing and their meat-heavy diet.  It seemed that like Clemens, they too could handle small quantities of herbs and spices to keep some variety to their meals.  <br />
<br />
“Well that was certainly more suited to us.”  Jenny remarked once the news was finished and the TV was off.  <br />
<br />
“Yesss.  In termsss of what to exxpect if it comesss to that.”  Clemens added.  <br />
<br />
“So if we did, we could expect them to be born or hatched with an already elevated maturity, and to develop faster in that regard.”  <br />
<br />
“It sseemsss that way.”  He agreed.  “Though that doesss depend on one thing.”  <br />
<br />
“I know, and still haven’t decided yet.”  <br />
<br />
“That’sss okay, jussst take your time with it, remember, whatever you decccide, I’ll be perfectly fine with it.”  He reassured her as he pulled her closer, her arms running over his smooth, bare scales.  <br />
<br />
“I know you will, but I have to say, it was odd seeing her without any breasts, would that be a result of the Serum?&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Mossst likely.  Sssnakes usually crawl on their belliesss, ssso they&#39;d be an intrussion.  If I had to guessss though, I&#39;d sssay that the milk glandssss are gone, with the fatty tissssue remaining.&quot;  Clemens&#39; explained, recalling the first Animal Tales episode from the year before.  <br />
<br />
&quot;But not any kids they have.&quot;  Jenny concluded.  <br />
<br />
&quot;That would be the mossst likely thing to happen.&quot;  Clemens agreed.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, I see.&quot;  Jenny pondered before moving the topic.  &quot;Now, there’s dirty pots that require your attention.”  She half-ordered, half-joked to him.  <br />
<br />
“Yes ma’am.”  Clemens chuckled as he rose to comply.  <br />
<br />
[+]<br />
<br />
“That was interesting.”  Joseph Patten remarked to himself as he turned off the TV.  <br />
<br />
He’d been busy the last few days, first needing to secure the permission needed to head to Florida for the week when Clemens and Jenny would wed.  Then there was the travel and accommodation arrangements, given that it really didn’t feel right to be with them as they got ready for their special day.  And finally making sure that his classes would be covered for the duration.  The Summer School Programmes were still on so he did need to make sure that there’d be no issues there.  <br />
<br />
He knew that Molly’s Maternity Leave still had a very few weeks remaining, which had been one area of concern.  From what he’d been told, it seemed that Molly and George were working with their cousins to help get their cubs used to them so they could look after them while Molly and George were at work.  <br />
<br />
For him though, he needed to make sure that he had everything ready before he set out to see his cousin.</p>
