<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Theo becomes the knight he dreamed of and Derry becomes the betrothed for a fitting knight</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The calm before the storm took longer than expected. A huge storm swept before the battlefield and luckily, it took about a third of the Malekith horde with it. While the horde is recuperating its losses, the Alabaster knights prepared for the siege. As for Theo, who is now Derry Crownshield, took this time to train the ways of the sword. Lucky for him, the real Derry’s knowledge and skill remained his body in the form of muscle memory. Derry is skilled, better in fact than the best of the Crownshield rookies. The only problem is his apprehensiveness when it came to hurting his enemy. With Theor on the reins, he was brutal with the sword. His cuts are swift, precise - every slash is calculated to deal the most damage. Yet, there were times that he was lost to anger - especially when it’s he who took the damage. Derry’s body is already hulking but when he activates the skill [Power Buff Up] in the heat of the moment, his muscles bulk up beyond the threshold of his armor. His strength grows two-fold but his focus is lost to the skill. He would become a monster in the training grounds, hunting his training buddies indiscriminately and hurling them with his blunted training sword. <br />
<br />
The elders of the Crownshield family quickly took notice of Derry’s change. It was as if, a blessing from heaven washed over the boy and cubed him to the right destiny. They shall watch his career with great interest, especially so when the encroaching horde of Malekith is just a week away.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Derry, now as Theo Decrux, was eating one day when a cousin of his bumped and made him spill his wine. His cousin kneeled on the ground and asked for forgiveness, for Theo is known to beat anyone who wasted his wine. The Decrux was surprised to see that Theo apologized and insisted that it was his fault that the wine had spilled. He asked the handmaidens for a rag and helped in cleaning the spill. It’s unheard of for the rambunctious problematic acolyte of the Decrux’s. They thought it was a one-time event but over the past few weeks, Theo became more hushed. His temper has grown and he did not resort to violence anymore. And for the first time, he helped in the kitchen and did his scholarly duties when he submitted praises and songs for the Goddess Hestia. Theo’s father joyed at the blessing that has somehow befallen upon their son. He was back at his destiny, and by that, the Decrux were happy.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
The day of the battle took one day earlier than expected. The horde of Malekith was still weak from the anger of the heavens and while they were asleep, their crude defenses were broken by a retaliatory strike from the army of Alabaster. Theo wasn’t supposed to lead the charge but when a single arrow grazed him by the knee, he activated his [Power Buff Up] skill as a knee-jerk reaction. His muscles ballooned to massive proportions that his chest plate couldn’t handle all the pressure that it popped out and sent flying to an orc’s head. A fellow hedge knight recounted that the breastplate flew so fast that it sliced the orc’s head into two.<br />
<br />
Theo burst into the battlefield devoid of his sword, instead, he picked up a war ax and jumped above their enemy’s walls. He sliced the orcs by the walls and beheaded those that got near him. In his anger, he didn’t realize that he’s cutting more orcs than the best knights in his platoon. This display of power was seen by the head knight of Alabaster.<br />
<br />
The night raged on. The smell and sound of iron filled the air. The fires bloomed and mages from Alabaster set Malekith’s orcs in an array of elemental damage. There were massive losses, more so on Malekith’s side. As for Theo, he was covered in blood. It’s a good thing that it’s not his.<br />
<br />
The battle ended with the Orcs retreating back into the forest. Malekith was nowhere to be seen, probably fled when he saw a hulking beast crashing through the inner walls of his rudimentary encampment. It was a win for the human forces of Alabaster and for Theo, he was decorated with a medal of valor after killing 126 orcs on a single night.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
It is Derry’s 21st birthday. It is not his real birthday but it’s Theo’s. Nevertheless, he celebrated it well as this would be his turning point as a major Acolyte of the church of Hestia. There was a celebration but he is not allowed to participate. He could smell the feast but he is not allowed to eat until he is wed before midnight. He does not know who he’ll wed but his family assured that it’s a well-known person in the kingdoms. There’s a lot of great people in the kingdom and more people that want to wed with him ever since his prominence grew after becoming an associate priest of the church. If someone wed him, they would get the blessings of the church - which ensures fame, money, and power. And the people of Alabaster are hungry for such recognition.<br />
<br />
The party outside hushed and deep rhythmic throngs of the drum signified the coming of his betrothed. Derry expected a highborn woman, probably from the indirect line of the royal family. When the curtains of the palanquin opened, Derry was surprised to see a familiar face he hasn’t seen for months. It was Theo using his face and by his smell, he’s back from his campaign in the Alpine Mountains. The years are kind to both of them, Derry grew more pristine and delicate while Theo became more of an indomitable bear. <br />
<br />
“Theo?”<br />
<br />
“Derry?”<br />
<br />
For the first time in years, they heard their real names spoken by another. They are more surprised by that than seeing each other’s faces. Theo went deeper into the palanquin and met face to face with the face they had since birth. It’s a familiar face that they long for but does not seek to return to. They hated their old faces but loved it because their friend was using it. And now, they are not friends anymore, rather, they are something better - betrothed. <br />
<br />
With his hands calloused by countless swords, Theo flipped Derry on his back ripped the thin fabric separating him and his skin. The old lashes were still there but they healed quite nicely thanks to the healing salves of the church. But when you trace your hands to where they were, Theo could still feel the small remnants that no salve will truly dissolve. Theo lowered his head and smelled the skin that was previously his own. It smelled like the Lilac Blossoms of the river. Theo guessed that Derry never changed his perfume collections. It’s not bad. Quite the opposite as it reminded Theo of home.<br />
<br />
“I’m putting it in,” Theo said, not wanting to surprise Derry of how his dick has grown over the years. Derry looked back and nodded. Slowly, Theo placed his uncut tip by the whole and inserted it. It’s nice that he has not taken a bath ever since he came back late from his campaign. He’s sweaty and musky but it provided the necessary lubricant to push himself deeper into Derry’s ass.<br />
<br />
It’s warm inside and Derry is writhing from the pinprick pain that’s opening up his virgin hole. He grabbed the pillow and braced as Theo plunged deeper and deeper. Sometimes, Theo would stop and Derry would think that it would be the end of it. But surprise, there’s another inch ripping him open - each time wider than the last. He wanted to scream, whether from pain or from pleasure, but Derry kept it all in like what he always did. When Theo reaches his end, the tip of his dick is nearly touching the end of Derry&#39;s intestine. It was hell and heaven inside at the same time. The heat made it feel like their dick and ass are one and the same. They are melting together but none are complaining, rather, they are begging for more. <br />
<br />
Theo rammed his dick, in and out, of Derry’s ass. Slow then faster and faster. There was no time to get used to it, just brace it all in - pleasure and pain. Their bodies strung like high pitch strings made of lightning. The palanquin rocked as if there’s an earthquake. Derry held his head high and screamed silently in the air. The force kept coming and coming. Derry thought Theo’s dick wouldn’t get anymore bigger but it did. His asshole is probably the size of a coin by now but he is not complaining. The bigger it is, the more he could take in.<br />
<br />
Theo grit his teeth and held in the pressure building in his groin. He’s fucked a hundred men and women before but by the heavens, Derry is unexpectedly one of the best. His tight ass squeezed his dick as if it was begging for every last drop. He pounded deeper, harder, their skin smacking together in a repeated kiss. He could feel it. The rush. The deep rush of pressure exploding all at once. He closed his eyes whilst his seed spurted from his dick, filling Derry from the inside.<br />
<br />
They lied down on the bed thinking nothing but the men beside them. They faced each other simultaneously, seeing the twinkle in Derry’s eyes and battle-hardened fury in Theo’s.<br />
<br />
“I love you, Theo.” <br />
<br />
“I love you too, Derry.”</p>
