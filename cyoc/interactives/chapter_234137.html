<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Joey then finds that the was a girl and that it hadn&#39;t went through the normal channel and that the adaption had been through their mother&#39;s private lawyer she uses for her business and that she had received $45,000. <br />
<br />
Joey asked what she wants to do? She says she wants to see how her baby is doing and seeing what her parents are like. Joey makes the wish and they are now at the place where her baby is and they see that the couple are good and that her baby seems happy. Joey then suggest that they disguise themselves and then talk to the parents saying that they are just doing adaption interview  to see what they plan on when they get older.<br />
<br />
Joey makes them look like they are middle-age but that they are now the opposite sexes. They then talk with the parents and find that Becky&#39;s baby won&#39;t have a need for anything and that when the child is older that we do plan on telling them that they were adopted.<br />
<br />
They leave and then Joey wishes they were back to Brad&#39;s house. Becky said she wanted to reward Joey up in her room. They then walk in to the house and find that Brad&#39;s mom is asleep in a make-sift crib and that Brad and his girlfriend are not were they when they left and it was when you go to Becky&#39;s room that you hear Brad and his girlfriend going at it. <br />
<br />
Becky and Joey goes in her room and Becky tells Joey that she wants to have sex with him.  Joey and her had sex and then Joey tells her that he has always had a crush on her and that if I could I would want to have you be my girlfriend if not my wife.<br />
<br />
Becky says that she would be willing to marry you but that with you being underage that we will have to wait until your old enough. Joey then said that he has a solution for that and wishes that he was 18 and that they are ready for the wedding.<br />
<br />
Joey was now the same age as Becky and they then go to Brad&#39;s door and knock and tell them that your sister and I are getting married and that we want you and your girlfriend to be in the wedding.<br />
<br />
Brad then says that he and his girlfriend are happy for you and are surprised when he tells you that he wishes that they can stay this way but that it was always our mother that would always break me and my girlfriends up.<br />
<br />
It was shortly after the talk that there father (John) comes home and Becky tells her father that she fell in love with joey and that we want to get married. He father asked where her mother is and Becky said that they found a letter from her saying that she was going to go for a trip and that she would be back later, he then says that he&#39;s happy to get some private time for himself. he then tells us that Julie had made his life a living hell. He then explained that she had told him that if he tried to divorce her that she would take everything from him. He then says that he wishes that she would have a extended trip.<br />
<br />
He then explained that he had at one time had friends not business aquatints and that we seemed to be happier before I became rich. He then noticed that there was a baby and asked who it is. You  tell him that you will explain later. You then wish that Brad&#39;s dad would find a life-insurance policy for Julie and that they will find that her name will be on one of the airplane passenger list that had crashed with no survivors and that she will be declared dead and then you wish Julie would switch places with Becky&#39;s baby but that it will have it where Becky had twins.<br />
<br />
Just after making the list you hear the phone ring and that they tell Brad&#39;s dad that his wife was on a list of passenger&#39;s that had crashed and that from what we see is nobody has survived. They then say that they are sorry but that they will give updates when we have some, they then said that where the plane crashed is over the ocean and that it is over a deep trench.     <br />
<br />
You then said that your wife Julie had been having Becky hide from you your granddaughter and that she had Becky going to so but that she had your granddaughter being in daycare. You then said that I found out that your wife was going to take off so I decided that it was time for Brad and you to meet finally. I then said that Julie was actually  taking and transferring almost everything into her name that Monique you maid had been a true friend to your son and daughter.<br />
<br />
Brad&#39;s dad said that he is glad to have people that can be trusted and then he says that he remembered that it is Brad&#39;s birthday and that he wants to treat everyone to a nice dinner he tells everyone to get dressed up including Monique .<br />
<br />
Becky changes the baby and noticed that the identifying birth mark has changed and that it looks like a heart. Becky asked Joey what he did? He says that he had given your mother a new lease on life that you had twin and the one the parents now have is your mother. I had also changed it so the woman is able to breastfeed her and that when she grows up that she will have a strict up-bringing but a loving one. You then asked what the baby&#39;s names are ? She says that the one that gotten adopted is Julie but the other Rachel after my great grandmother. Becky tells her father that she has fed Rachel and that we will get a sitter for her.<br />
<br />
They all go to the restaurant and they had the dinner and they all except Brad and his girlfriend had gotten very drunk and that Brad had to drive everyone home, we see that John and Monique had went to her room and see that John had told Monique that is was so sexy that he want to do her now, Joey and Becky had went back to her room and had sex again, Brad had asked his girlfriend if she wanted another sex romp. <br />
<br />
What will happen is that</p>
