<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In a mansion practically taking up a block within the city, a young woman laid down on a couch before the impressive flatscreen, playing out the news with the anchorman finishing before the break.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still on about the virus.&quot; Jodie sighed as the break played an ad for some new plus-size clothing, showing one of the &#39;mega-bears&#39; wearing a t-shirt that barely stretched over his moobs and belly, despite enough fabric being used to make a tent. At the start of the outbreak, Jodie was among those women who locked themselves away to avoid getting infected. But now watching how the world seemed to have accepted the virus&#39;s effects, how the infected themselves even embraced their new bodies, well, Jodie had to admit she was jealous. <br />
<br />
She was jealous of how everyone seemed to have decided the newly grown bears were more than okay, if the various magazines and videos that have been cropping up. <br />
<br />
With a final sigh, Jodie sat up from where she laid and pulled out her phone, ignoring the tv playing an ad promoting some eating competition, showing huge men laying on their bellies and chest to eat from troughs like pigs. Looking at her phone, Jodie ignored the poor algorithm targeting bear stuff ads for her and opened her social media. <br />
<br />
&quot;Seems Cassie got infected.&quot; The slim woman commented, looking at the photo shared by one of her closest friends, instead of the slim former cheerleader, the photo posted showed a massive hair covered man flexing proudly, clothing that matched what Cassie usually wore was in tatters with scraps clung to the huge man&#39;s hairy form, stuck on by sweat that dripped off the hulking behemoth that filled the frame. Jodie had to admit, he looked handsome, especially as she spotted the slim form of Cassie&#39;s boyfriend Luke pinned under one of the huge man&#39;s arms, practically stuffed into his armpit. <br />
<br />
Jodie was at least happy for Cassie, seeing the broad smile on the bearded man&#39;s face, though the little good mood the slim woman had soured as she came across a photo set shared by her ex-boyfriend Mark. The man she had been in a relationship for over a year had suddenly broken it off before claiming he wasn&#39;t ready for a serious relationship. Not a week later and the photo set showed him having been on a date, though instead of a woman like Jodie, Mark&#39;s date was one of the transformed men, a immense morbidly obese man. <br />
<br />
&quot;That ass.&quot; Jodie couldn&#39;t help but yell, seeing the image of her ex laying atop an immense belly that was easily bigger than her own king-sized bed, a pair of moobs being used as pillows with the  beard covered jaw of the man just in frame, mouth open in mid belch. Jodie couldn&#39;t fully blame Mark since so many &#39;normal&#39; men admitted they found themselves attracted to the huge growing bears, but the fact he lied to her and seemed to immediately jumped onto a huge blob of a man. <br />
<br />
This feeling of anger, compiled with how seeming everyone and everything was reminding her of the transforming virus. Seeming to push her further and further. The straw being a sudden pop up for some super-stretchy jockstraps.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it.&quot; The slim woman slammed her phone on the coffee table before getting up, storming out of the room and leaving the tv on playing the interview with the mega sized infected. Going through the expansive mansion, Jodie&#39;s steps echoed as she looked for a specific shelf, remembering a &#39;gift&#39; one of her friends sent to her after they grew into a truck crushing behemoth. It wasn&#39;t long before the slim woman caught sight of the offending item before standing on her toes and lifting it up, then making her way back to the tv room. Taking her seat back on the couch, Jodie placed the item on the coffee table before just staring at it, said item was an airtight jar containing a clearly damp piece of clothing, the inside of the jar with condensation from the sweat that had evaporated and returned back to a liquid. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do I really want to do this?&quot; Jodie asked herself as she looked at the sweat soaked scrap, knowing if she exposed herself to it, she&#39;d join so many others as hairy gassy men who weigh so much they&#39;d need industrial scales to weigh themselves. Even with the knowledge that her expansive inheritance would see her not needing to worry about finances as a mega-bear, Jodie found herself a bit hesitant. Looking back up to the interview playing, Jodie listened to the huge men on screen talk about the change and how it&#39;s affected their lives with some anecdotes spread throughout. The question on whether they&#39;d want to be changed back if given the offer was met with disagreements, both expressing just how much they were enjoying their new gender and sizes. <br />
<br />
With the interview ending, Jodie turned off the tv and stared at the blank screen, seeing her slim body along with the expanse of the furniture she barely took much space on. The young woman ran a hand through her long hair before coming to a decision, she grabbed her phone and opened a take out app, making an order from multiple restaurants to get plenty of food. <br />
<br />
“In for a penny, in for a pound.” Jodie said to herself, unable to keep the hollow laugh from the minor pun as she completed and paid for her order that could easily be a feast for a party with leftovers after. Of course, she knew it would all be gone once she was done. Putting her phone away on a side table against the couch, Jodie crawled back and took her seat in the middle of the couch before lifting the jar off the coffee table. Taking a deep breath to prepare herself, Jodie cracked open the vessel and turned the lid around before taking it off. The rank stench coming out of it made the slim woman flinch back, reminded of the smell of a high school locker room but concentrated. Stealing her nerves, Jodie reached into the jar and pulled the damp scrap out, trying not to retch as she rubbed the soiled garment against her body, feeling the sweat seep through her own clothing before a warmth began to spread. <br />
<br />
Jodie groaned, his voice getting deeper as she looked up to her reflection in the flatscreen. Her slim features started to broaden out as her bones seemed to adjust, growing outwards with her clothing stretching against her shifting body. Her face in the reflection showing her jaw starting to shift to a lantern jaw line, hair starting to sprout forming a 5 o’clock shadow, a look down as her chest shifted from a decent C-Cup to a flat but broad look, further down a prominent bulge filled the front of her pants. <br />
<br />
“Oooh, this feels… ugh… so good.” Jodie moaned deeply, feeling his body growing out before the heat seemed to intensify as his body swelled even further. The shifting man looking to his reflection with pleasure as his body stretched longer, his limbs starting to get gangly before filling out with fat. Watching on, Jodie grunted and shifted his legs up onto the coffee table, witnessing them thicken out further and start to tear through his pants. The stylish fabric straining and tearing apart as his legs swelled and lengthened with mass, stretching over the creaking coffee table as he grew bigger. Jodie could feel the couch beneath him starting to struggle under his swelling mass as he looked down. Seeing his firm chest starting to swell back into a pair of breasts before dropping into two slabs of moobs, his trim stomach filling out into a wide dome of fat, stretching his t-shirt as it rose up into a makeshift bra along with the already snapped off remains of Jodies old bra that now struggled to contain his chest.<br />
<br />
“More…” Jodie moaned out as he kept growing bigger and fatter, feeling his clothing start to tear off, leaving scraps across his body as he cleared the seven hundred pound mark, his swollen belly spreading over his thighs that were thicker than his old bod used to be. His fat feet now further over the coffee table as he swelled with added height too. His smooth blubbery flesh covered in a thickening layer of hair and dripping with sweat. Reaching a thick, fat fingered hand up to his fat face, Jodie felt some resistance against his wide chest as his arm fat pressed against each other and his thick moobs. Touching his face, Jodie felt the swollen cheeks he now had sported, moving down to feel the ring of fat and rows of chins that were now hidden under his growing beard. Jodie’s widening ass spread over the couch as it started to struggle to contain the huge growing man, feeling his swollen fat rolls, his thick cock pressing against his underbelly as he spread further, now forcing his legs apart.<br />
<br />
**CREEAAK**<br />
<br />
Jodie was pulled from his thoughts by the deep creaking sound before a loud crack echoed out when the couch and coffee table collapsed under him. The still swelling man fell down to the ground, shaking the entire mansion as his gargantuan body spread out on the ground. For a moment, Jodie laid there, his huge body jiggling from the force whilst still spreading out further as he grew. The only thing the enormous sweating man could do was moan as he felt up his expanding body, lost in the feeling as he closed his eyes.</p>
