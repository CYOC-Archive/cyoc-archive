<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a whirlwind evening for the mysterious stranger. Flitting from dream to dream, helping those dispelling troubling thoughts. For Brian Walker, a were-otter and his were-beaver girlfriend Patricia; he gave them a pleasant dream of them swimming in the town’s lake on a moon lit night. With the were-alert going on, both aquatic were’s were chomping at the bit to let their fur out and feel the cooling effects of the water as they glide through the substance. Smiling as he knew those two will wake up in the morning in each other’s furry arms; the mysterious stranger moves on to his next stop.<br />
<br />
Sensing a need to visit two fresh faces, the mysterious stranger heads over to the Cooper household. Seeing both Darrell and Joan sleeping; Darrell snuggled into Joan as she was in her were-tiger fursona. The mysterious stranger could sense a longing.<br />
“No it’s not a longing;” the draconic man speaking as he stares at Joan; “it’s a need.”<br />
“Come home Douglas,” Joan mumbles in her sleep; “take me into your furry arms.”<br />
“You two had a were-wedding,” the draconic man looking at Joan intently; “yet haven’t consummated it yet.”<br />
“I want to run my paws all over your fur,” Joan still talking in her sleep.<br />
“Yep,” the draconic man nodding; “definitely an unconsummated were-wedding.”<br />
<br />
Doing what he can to help ease the were-tigresses worrying thoughts; giving Joan a pleasant dream of her and Douglas fishing by a stream in their fursona. Douglas a were-grizzly wading in the stream and catching salmon; Joan licking her lips in eager anticipation of devouring the freshly caught fish from her mate. It made Joan start to purr in the waking world as soundly slept.<br />
<br />
For Darrell, the mysterious stranger sighed. Despite the kid’s boundless energy; Darrell’s dreams were about his mother he still wants to come home.<br />
“I cannot bring the dead back to life,” the draconic man shaking his head; “but I can bring them back for a short visit.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Darrell was quietly playing with a train set Douglas got for him on his last birthday. It was the first birthday Darrell had without his mother. Despite being spoiled with presents and cake; Darrell was looking sad that Alyssa was not there.<br />
<br />
“Why do you look so sad Darrell?”<br />
Looking up, Darrell sees Alyssa and looks completely surprised. Jumping up from sitting on the floor, Darrell bounds to his mother and gives her a mighty hug.<br />
“Mommy Fish,” Darrell happily shouting; “your back!”<br />
“Only for a short time,” Alyssa picking up her son; “my you have grown since I last saw you.”<br />
“Are you going away again,” Darrell looking at his mother.<br />
“Let’s not dwell on that,” Alyssa smiling as she puts down her son; “I see you were playing with some trains. Who got them for you?”<br />
“Uncle Yogi,” Darrell sitting back down; “furry mom got me some clothes.”<br />
“Joan’s the practical one,” Alyssa chuckling; “I imagine when you met my cousin, he would be an insufferable boar to you.”<br />
“He is a bear,” Darrell looking at his mother; “what’s insufferable?”<br />
“Oh son,” Alyssa smiling; “I miss you so much.”<br />
“Why can’t you come back,” Darrell asking.<br />
“I’m dead,” Alyssa looking sad; “I can’t come back. Any more than you can come with me.”<br />
“I don’t want to be alone,” Darrell starting to cry.<br />
“You’re not alone,” Alyssa embracing her son; “you have Joan and Douglas. And from what I’m told by someone,” Alyssa rubbing her son’s head; “those two are madly in love with each other.”<br />
“Who told you,” Darrell speaking in his simplistic nature.<br />
<br />
“The man who brought me back so we could have a talk,” Alyssa motioning her head towards the kitchen. Darrell seeing the mysterious stranger for the first time smiling as he sips coffee.<br />
“Is he a furry like Joan and Uncle Yogi,” Darrell asking.<br />
“Not quite,” Alyssa smiling; “but he a kindred spirit of a sort. Look son,” Alyssa  letting Darrell go and looking at him intently; “what happen to me, was horrible. The werewolves taking my life, denying you your mother; it can’t be undone.”<br />
“But I want you back,” Darrell starting to cry.<br />
“You still have Joan and Douglas my son,” Alyssa doing what she can to dry her son’s tears. Despite my cousin’s gruff nature,” Alyssa sighing; “he is a good man.”<br />
“He is not here,” Darrell looking at her mother.<br />
“He is the sheriff,” Alyssa sighing; “as such, he is pretty much on call at all hours.”<br />
<br />
“I hate to interrupt this touching moment,” the mysterious man speaking; “but your time is nearly up here Alyssa.”<br />
“Don’t remind me,” Alyssa giving the draconic man an ugly look. “Darrell,” Alyssa looking back at her son; “I have to go soon, but that doesn’t mean we can’t have fun playing with your trains.”<br />
“All right,” the mysterious man sighing; “I’ll let you have a few more minutes with your son.”<br />
“Yeah,” Darrell beaming.<br />
<br />
Staring at the two from his spot in the kitchen, the mysterious stranger sips his coffee.<br />
‘were’s Darrell’s age are always difficult to help out,’ the man sighs as he watches Darrell play with his mother; ‘sometimes they have a hard time grasping the issues.’<br />
<br />
It was a few minutes later when Alyssa gets up after playing with her son; tears coming down her eyes as she knows her time is up. Alyssa shakes her head as Darrell gets up trying to chase after her; wanting Alyssa to stay. Darrell sobs as he watches her mother leave through the front door without even opening it; trying to follow, he was stopped as the mysterious stranger places a strong hand on the kids shoulder.<br />
“NO,” the man firmly states; “it’s not your time Darrell, you cannot follow where your mother is going.”<br />
“Let me go,” Darrell crying; “I want mommy fish!”<br />
“Darrell,” the mysterious stranger speaking softly; “you’ll meet up with her again one day. But until then,” the man turning the kid around; “you need to live your life.”<br />
“Will I see mommy again,” Darrell looking misty eyed.<br />
“In your dreams,” the man is smiling; “yes you will. Like you just did now; but never when you are awake unfortunately.” The mysterious stranger looks at Darrell as he helps to dry the kids tears; “you want to see something neat?”<br />
Darrell just nods as he looks as the smiling man.<br />
“Not many get a chance to see my true form,” the mysterious stranger starting to shift; “most often they are blinded by bright lights or their own emotional distress to look at me closely.”<br />
<br />
Darrell’s eyes go wide as he watches the man slowly shift from his immaculately dressed form to something he only seen in a book. Watching as the man’s hands turn into wicked looking talons, scales covering his skin as he rapidly grows and bulks up in mass. Scales of green and white covering him as a large tail rapidly forms between a set of legs more used to a quadrupedal stance. The mysterious stranger’s neck stretch out and face turning into a draconic muzzle, just as large wings burst from his back.<br />
“Pretty cool huh,” the now large dragon speaking to a surprised kid.<br />
Darrell could only stare in disbelief as he nodded his head.<br />
“Douglas is busy ensuring that the bad who are coming,” the dragon shifting to mist and smoke; “don’t harm the town.”<br />
“Will he be back,” Darrell wanting to place a hand on the dragon; but he is unable to move from where he stood.<br />
“Yes,” the dragon doing his best to reassure the young wer-mer kid; “but until the danger passes, it would be best that you and Joan stay home for the day.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
The mysterious stranger sighs as he finally ends his time dealing with Joan and Darrell. Sensing he spent too much time with Darrell; letting the child have a dream with his deceased mother. Seeing that the night is nearly over; he heads off to help one more person in need of his guidance.</p>
