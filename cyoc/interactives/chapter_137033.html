<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eliza spent most of her afternoon staring blankly at the notebook. Or when she was with students or teaching classes she was thinking about it. What else would it change? Could she use it to improve her life? Should she use it at all?<br />
<br />
Her deepest thoughts on the subject occurred during the afternoon just before one of her worst students, Kaito came to see her. Kaito was a grizzled looking student with bright red pimples randomly stuck to his face and greasy hair that was a little too long. His facial hair had grown outwards into unnimpressive stubble and peach fuzz that wasn’t nice to look at and he constantly looked like he hadn’t had enough sleep. He had skipped about seventy five percent of her classes that semester and the look of carelessness in his eyes was beyond unsatisfactory.<br />
<br />
His English was rather poor as well, he still had trouble delivering the proper stresses on letters and came across as intelligible half the time. The meeting wasn’t much better. He didn’t care about his missing assignments, nearly failing grade, or her disappointment. He just wanted to leave and leave he did. Eliza watched him go with pursed lips and spent the rest of the afternoon with good students until evening came. She then bagged her things and walked to the train station. It wasn’t until she sat down on her train that she remembered the notebook and pulled it out. She stared at it for a few minutes before she opened it and scrawled our a short sentence.<br />
<br />
“I wish I knew what up with Kaito.”<br />
<br />
As she stared at the sentence it began to fade and in the speed of a blink she knew about Kaito’s home life. His pushy parents forcing him into the university, his habit of watching anime until dawn and sometimes forgetting to eat, and his sexual obsession with an anime girl. Images of Kaito masturbating, talking to a body pillow, and daydreaming about being with a drawing filled Eliza’s head and she blinked rather disturbed and grossed out by the whole situation. She felt a frown grow on her lips and immidiately pressed the pen to the blank page. Her finger loitered over it as she tried to decipher who was at fault for Kaito’s state. His parents were exceptionally pushy and had shot down a lot of his career ideas so she needed to start with them.<br />
<br />
Mr. Motohan was a strict, no nonsense man with a highly held sense of pride in his job. However there were inklings of laziness in his body. He hadn’t pushed himself to work hard in twenty years and had watched all his friends advance in the work world. Mrs. Motohan on the other hand had been a rule follower her entire life and when she married her husband he had begun to emotionally and verbally abuse her. She did everything he asked and their relationship was more like that of a servant and master than a happy couple. Eliza decided to change that and then turned her attention to Kaito, he needed a reality check. She exhaled deeply and began to write.<br />
<br />
Kaito just happened to be visiting his parents for dinner that evening and as his silent mother put food down on the table Mr. Motohana glared at his pudgy son with pursed lips. He hadn’t called and his demeaner had slacked off even more than normal.<br />
<br />
Mr. Motohana began eating wordlessly and his wife sat down and stared at the food she’d cooked almost like she was about to burst out crying. Kaito just tried to ignore them. Mrs. Motohana gave out a sigh and picked up the bowl of rice and brought a bit up to her mouth. The bland flavour touched her tongue and she was reminded of her mother’s cooking, extremely flavourful western meats experimented with and brought to life. She hadn’t exactly been very creative or rebellious. But in that moment she put the food down with a small click and felt her gaze harden. Almost immediately the entire spread of food shifted. Mr. Motohana bit into some fish prepared in garlic and soy sauce and gagged as the flavour changed. Salted sauce hit his tongue, spicy flavours wracking his mouth as he coughed. Sauces changed on the table and soon the rice was saturated in a buttery sauce while the rice became purposefully undercooked. Mrs. Motohana blinked and brought some of the food to her mouth. Her taste buds exploded as the normal dishes her husband requested faded from her memory and new flavourful dishes filled her brain. She began to eat with a smile and her husband picked some pepper from his maw and turned to her.<br />
<br />
“This isn’t what I asked for,” he muttered and his wife paused and turned to him. He watched as his traditionally dressed wife began to change. Her clothes melted into a flavourful top and comfortable pair of pants while her hair became unbound and styled itself rather uniquely. A tattoo crawled up her right arm and onto her chest becoming a full sleeve while the house itself began to change. Decorations changed into modernistic designs and vacation photos on the wall became more elaborate. Places Mr. Motohana wouldn’t dream of visiting. Then with a startling change his wife’s eyes widened and her hair turned red. Her Japanese complexion faded and her husband stared at her in shock.<br />
<br />
“Eat your food,” She ordered in fluent Japanese and Mr. Motohana felt a quiver pass through his body before he took another bite of the fish his wife had prepared. Flavours wracked his tongue and suddenly she seemed less strange. The type of woman who would say no to him and take charge from time to time. She had led them into sex a lot now and they’d done it in dozens of positions. He felt a smile cross his face as his employment faded and a new job she had pushed him into following filled his mind. His suit became nicer and instead of working as a lawyer’s assistant he was now a politician, an elected one too. A successful career built up before him and he felt a smile cross his face and leaned over to kiss his wife.<br />
<br />
Kaito’s entire DNA sequence immidiately scrambled and the day his parents originally convieved him became a business trip day. However his mom had gotten pregnant two weeks later. The only catch was it had used a different sperm. Kaito immediately grew four inches, now more akin to his mother in height while his features rearranged to become of mixed heritage. His hair grew a natural wave to it while his eyes turned a deeper brown colour. Then with a spark his waist caved inwards and his hips popped outwards to childbearing proportions. His ass inflated while his penis jolted back into his pelvis taking his balls with it. She yelled when this happened and her thighs expanded while her shoulders skimmed down. Body hair reverted back into her body while her hands and feet grew smaller and slenderer. Her chest then bloated out into solid B-Cups and her face rearranged becoming feminine. Then her hair cascaded down her back and blemishes cleared up over her body. She panted and opened her eyes finding her parents hadn’t even noticed. But what exactly they hadn’t  noticed was beyond her grasp.<br />
<br />
Much to her shock her father turned towards her and asked how her animation classes were going. She just blinked and realized she’d forgotten English alltogether. But she hadn’t ever learned any so that was fine. Skills as an artist filled her mind and lead collected on her right palm where her hand had been brushing drawings all morning. She smiled as her body pillow vanished though her enjoyment of anime remained. She began to talk about a class to her parents as the seat next to her blurred and in a few seconds a fourteen year old girl looking very similar to her appeared. The table expanded and a ten year old girl appeared next to her. Then she watched her own mother’s belly grow in size until she was a good seven months along in a pregnancy. Kairi stared at her mother for a few seconds before an arm fell around her shoulder and she looked to her right to find a Japanese guy, a really handsome one grinning at her. He didn’t resemble the family and Kairi felt the desire to lean in and kiss him. She held off however, at least in front of her parents who were smiling and eating while her little sisters pestered her boyfriend about random details. He’d share most of them on the spot.<br />
<br />
Eliza knew this was happening and with a blink she stopped writing right there. The ink faded and she stared at the blank page with wide eyes. Her stop was called and she stood up exiting the car with a bunch of people. She had a thousand yard stare and was unsure if what she had just done was good or bad.</p>
