<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I wrote the last two chapters, but for some reason it logged me out as soon as I posted. ¯\_(&#12484;)_/¯<br />
<br />
Jeff had just witnessed the true power of the Chronivac. All remnants of his sister’s existence were gone. Jeff felt a rush of adrenaline through his veins, he could do anything he wanted. However, though he had seen the effect of the reality alteration function, he still had not tried to input a custom scenario for a transformation. So, he opened a new transformation form.<br />
<br />
Maybe it was the power high, or maybe Jeff was just truly sadistic, but he immediately though to change his mother. His mother was in her forties but could pass for someone in their late twenties. He knew that she was considered easy on the eyes, but she was always out working or resting. She didn’t even really need to work, especially now that he no longer had a sister.<br />
<br />
That would settle it. Jeff decided to turn his mother into something that could be around the house all the time, so he and his father could see her. A simple pinup poster would do nicely, with the added bonus of being able to create a custom transformation so that everyone would know she was transformed and treat it as normal. He also didn’t want to test the reality change for one of his parents, or he might accidentally erase himself.<br />
<br />
F Human (Martha) -> Pinup poster<br />
Senses: seeing, hearing<br />
Reality change: on<br />
Delay: 5 minutes<br />
Custom:<br />
<br />
For the custom box, he knew that the transformation needed to be something that she had planned for, so a special delivery seemed like the best option. He also wanted to witness the changes for himself, so he set up the scenario so that his mother would change when she opened the package. As for the rest of the finer details, he left ambiguous for Chronivac to decide. Once he was satisfied, he pressed enter and walked downstairs.<br />
<br />
His mother was in the kitchen still, sitting on his former sister while she ate a sandwich, one that would be her last. Jeff was rather disturbed by how giddy she was at the moment, so he asked her why she was so bubbly. “Any second now it will arrive. And then I will get to watch over you and your father from the best place in the house.” Jeff was shocked. The Chronivac had certainly gotten the scenario right, but he couldn’t believe how excited his mother was to be turned into a poster. His mother was practically glowing with joy. After only a few minutes the doorbell rang, and Jeff knew that it was time for the transformation to begin.<br />
<br />
His mother peered out the front door but saw no delivery driver. On the ground was a tube package, for mailing posters and important documents, however the cap had been left open. Jeff watched her pick up the tube wondering what would start the change. <br />
<br />
There before him, his mother’s skin warped into silky smooth paper, growing flatter and flatter. Her texture became glossy as her clothes dropped to the floor. Then with one final swoop, his mother was pulled into the tube, and it dropped at the doorstep as though it had been just delivered.<br />
<br />
The door had been left askew, so Jeff went to retrieve his new package, and stop the cool draft. He walked over to the table where his sister-chair was located and opened his package. As he unrolled his new pinup poster, he could see all that his mother had. In the image He saw the naked image of his mother, save for some thigh-highs that had been pulled in with her. She sat on her knees with one hand propped between her legs, while the other she was biting the nail of. She stared straight forward as though she saw something she wanted; her humongous G-cup tits were on full display for him to see. Then his eyes traced further down, until he saw her groomed vagina, cleanly shaved and ready for use. He had not seen his mother in all her naked glory since he was a kid, but now he knew he was missing out.<br />
<br />
Because of the settings he put in, his father would still remember his mother, so Jeff decided to not to hang his mother just yet, but instead to just beat his meat in the chair that was once his sister. Jeff now had a choice to make. He could wait and see how his father reacts to this new reality, or he could move forward with starting another transformation.</p>
