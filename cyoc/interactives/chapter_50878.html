<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The curse was disgusted. Instead of feeling the hubris sense of superiority and sadistic <br />
dominance Jensen had at first at his 'children' and his pack of she-wolves; he was feeling <br />
the weight of the mantle of leadership, and openly and sincerely CARED about his new <br />
family the way any decent patriarch would. At least it could sate itself on the flavor of <br />
Jensen dark desire to show Madam Serenity just what the 'Big' and 'Bad' in Big Bad Wolf <br />
really meant.<br />
<br />
The curse could eat up the wonderful moment of misery and delightful loss as the wolves <br />
were robbed from their families and their families were robbed of the memories of their <br />
loved ones... but the wolves were all so damn HAPPY and tolerant with each other!  <br />
Happiness had the same flavor as battery acid to the curse.<br />
<br />
Jack and Marcine were now but intelligent and sapient animals and steadily become <br />
detached to ideas like 'good and evil', like the overwhelming majority of animals were. So it <br />
could not even drink in them being depraved in their impartial sex with simply beasts <br />
because they were but simple beasts themselves now! They were giving the dumb animals <br />
some value to themselves by giving them all -names!-<br />
<br />
Kaylee like Jensen was becoming increasingly sour to the palate of the curse, she still had <br />
some sweet sugary sadism at the former clink using them as her personal chair, but this <br />
was mixed in with the foul tasting gunk of her realization now that she truly did love her <br />
pups and would die for them rather than see them harmed.<br />
<br />
The shadows were totally tasteless, they simply did as Bart and Jenny would ask of them if <br />
they would have asked. And the gargoyles, while they had some delicious savagery in <br />
them, and the pain the victims had suffered was tasty, their absolute and pure desire to <br />
protect with no profit to themselves left a disgusting taste at it's core.<br />
<br />
Mr. P... while he now had some meaty savagery in him that wasn't there before, and the <br />
death of the cat Queen had giving it a FEAST of suffering and self-loathing in Trevor, Mr. <br />
P too had that terrible smelling matter of selfless desire to protect those who under his <br />
charge could not protect themselves.<br />
<br />
And Martha... ugh, she certainly smelled appetizing, and that lovely first course meal of <br />
her misery and pain at her transformation encouraged this idea, but the sweet smell of as <br />
being treated as inferior by the rest of the pack was off set again by the pack she had for <br />
the pack's pups and they had for her.<br />
<br />
The triplets, there was the honey coating of the loss of a good deal of their individuality, <br />
but it just hid the rotten taste of total sisterhood and total love for each other and the <br />
three glass pups that left the curse practically gagging.<br />
<br />
Those wretch, happy, cheerful, innocent, pure, disgusting glass brats! And Alice, the curse <br />
was not used to experiencing emotion in any form towards it's victims beyond what a <br />
snake feels towards a mouse before it enters the snake's belly, but oh oh oh! How the <br />
curse now -hated- her!  She using the very power it had given her and could not be taken <br />
back, now could place the curse itself in a verbal straight jacket! Yes. The curse hated her <br />
utterly!<br />
<br />
If it was a dijinn, it would have used the next use of the game in a completely absurd and <br />
mindlessly illogical way to deal with her, but there was no way on Earth, in Hades or the <br />
Heavens that even possible! For that would be a violation of the very foundations of it's <br />
nature that would cause it to self-destruct if violated: while the witches had released the <br />
curse into the world to for revenge, they left behind irrefutable safety measures want it <br />
getting any schemes or ambitions of it's own that would make it deviate from -how- it <br />
was to spread misery (what was revenge without a person touch?).<br />
<br />
No, the power was a PART of Alice now, as much as her ability to slip into the mirrorverse <br />
and convert non-wolves pack agents to her own kind. But now Jensen's attention had <br />
been brought about by Caroline's mutation, and now Alice would oversee all uses of the <br />
game by the pack... Yes. The curse hated Alice fully and completely.<br />
<br />
And the curse was silent, for it could do nothing beyond it's function, it could now think <br />
and feel in a crude manner, but it was still a prisoner of it's very nature (like anything in <br />
existence) and could nothing. And the worst part was, this only applied to the parts of <br />
itself that were with the pack and it's servants, the rest of itself in Glendale still simply <br />
was.<br />
<br />
The best way to think of this was that each time the game was used, the game would <br />
transfer to a new victim, and when the game was used on multiple victims, like an amoeba <br />
the curse split into identical clones with recent experiences of the original. Each 'clone' <br />
was away of the existence of other parts of itself, and all indeed did feel it when two parts <br />
of itself were spontaneous were destroyed, but they could not directly speak to each other <br />
though 'feelings' got through, like in the Glendale art gallery, one particular statue gave a <br />
constant stream of tasty loneliness.  Thus while the rest of the curse was aware of a large <br />
part of itself being 'ann-gree' at something, it could not tell what.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Mr. P stared mindlessly at the TV during the virtual tennis tournament, it was all just <br />
glorified game tokens to him. The monition sensitive controllers were a nice touch, but Mr. <br />
P as patrick always saw such games as glorified Ping-Pong.<br />
<br />
"One regretful thing about the wii-characters, we can't make them look like wolves." <br />
Kaylee said and she didn't care to look at the character she had fashioned as Kyle to look <br />
like himself.<br />
<br />
"Actually mommy, we have a present for you." Marcy said happily and dramatically.<br />
<br />
They went to the wii's character creation channel and showed Kaylee the gift from her <br />
children to her.<br />
<br />
Marcy and Kevin had surprisingly, after playing with the options for an hour, would <br />
actually manage to get a fairly convincing wolf face on the cute little human wii-character.<br />
<br />
"Do you like it mommy?" Kevin asked.<br />
<br />
"Like it? I love it!" Kaylee cheered, "I absolutely love it!"<br />
<br />
Nintendo's proof of quality held true when Kaylee used it to do a virtual dance-step game, <br />
the motion sensitive board holding under her weight. The children then spent the next few <br />
hours tweaking and editing more virtual characters in the vague iconic images of <br />
themselves and the rest of the pack. Kaylee provided tips where she could as her children <br />
stole the show, and her enjoying every minute of it!<br />
<br />
As she danced, an idle thought crossed her mind, 'If they are my pups through and <br />
through, does that mean my body is now the age it would have to be so they could have <br />
been birthed by me nine years ago?' Bart and Lisa were nine, and Kevin and Marcy were <br />
seven. 'If that's the case, I'm sorry I didn't get to be pregnant with them, feel the pain of <br />
giving birth to them, and the trials of having them grow up to this point.' The ideas of <br />
losing a few years of her life meant absolutely nothing to her. Kaylee realized if there was <br />
a single thing she regreted about this new life, it was that.  But she had them now, and she <br />
felt sunlight on her soul whenever she thought of that.<br />
<br />
She realized her children were clapping. She looked at the screen realizing the virtual <br />
dance routine had ended.  <br />
<br />
Kaylee started... for the first time since getting the game... ever... she had gotten a one <br />
hundred percent. <br />
<br />
"I know where I got my gift from." The only black furred pup Jenny said proudly. <br />
<br />
"Congratulations Alpha Female!" <br />
<br />
The reddish brown wolf woman Kaylee started and turned around to see the plain green <br />
Beatrice. "Don't sneak up on me like that!"<br />
<br />
"I am sorry Alpha Female! You were doing so well that I couldn't bring myself to intervene.  <br />
I have a message from Master to everyone.  Ahem. You are only to use a turn when you <br />
have Master's permission, and you've gone over the wording with Alice. The only time you <br />
can use the game otherwise would be if you have a gun to your head or it would be the <br />
only way to save lives of Pack members.  This order remains standing until otherwise." <br />
<br />
"I see." Kaylee said, though wondering why Master felt this relatively minor change in <br />
policy.  Things had been changing so hard, so fast that Kaylee had completely lost track of <br />
how many days it had been since she had called Jennifer as Kyle and had set off the chain <br />
of events that had been their destinies. <br />
<br />
Jensen, herself, the twins, and her pups had all been transformed on the same day. Then <br />
on the following they had transformed Martha, the shadows, the deer, Alice, and the <br />
twenty plus one wolf pack members. Then was it the next day that the clink were <br />
transformed? Then Mr. P. And yesterday Julie had finally been added to their family along <br />
with Abbey and Samantha. Had there been a day where they had all just relaxed without <br />
transforming someone yet? Kaylee wasn't sure anything, everything had become such a <br />
blur, and their pack had gotten so large, so so large.  And she knew it was only destine to <br />
get larger. <br />
<br />
"Also Alpha Female." Beatrice said, "I think lunch is about to be served."<br />
<br />
"Thank you Green."<br />
<br />
"Beatrice Alpha Female."<br />
<br />
"Beatrice, right."<br />
<br />
Kaylee then looked at her offspring and clapped her hands together, "Okay kids! Food <br />
break!" <br />
<br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
With Alice taking one hand, and Abbey and Samantha taking two more, (and Martha of <br />
course carrying their dresses from New York under one arm) the girls had stepped 'one, <br />
two, three' and were back in Smith Manor. <br />
<br />
Samantha still wearing the golden kimono looked at her sister and exclaimed. <br />
<br />
"Abbey you didn't!" Samantha exclaimed.<br />
<br />
'What? I think it looks cute!" Abbey said now wearing the child sized version of the fuku <br />
they had seen hanging on the store wall. And on her, it did look rather pretty. Having <br />
been out of view of the mirrors, it side stepped a rule of reality, in this case it looked <br />
almost like 3D ink and paint, it looked nice on Abbey all the same somehow, though it <br />
still needed alterations for her tail. <br />
<br />
Martha had to admit, she had been surprised at the composition of the blond pups' world. <br />
She had expected some void full of floating mirror, or a faux winter wonderland where <br />
everything was made out of glass.  The only real difference Martha really spotted at first <br />
was how there were no people or animals outside of the view of the mirrors in the real <br />
world. Martha wondered how this applied to moving machines like train cars and 'naturally' <br />
moving objects like rivers.<br />
<br />
 Then again it seemed to be four am in the twenty four hour opened store, so if the <br />
mirrored doubles of the sun and moon were moving, why not others?  Martha did notice <br />
how nothing felt really hot or cold, everything seemed to be the same even temperature <br />
everywhere. But the mirror doubles of the cloth she felt were decidedly cloth, as was the <br />
maid uniform that had popped into being when the girls had brought her in.  Though Alice <br />
warned Martha not to eat or drink anything while in the mirror universe least she end up <br />
with glass in her stomach when she came out.<br />
<br />
'But what about the air I'm breathing? Wouldn't glass in the lungs be even worse?!' Martha <br />
thought through her brain wired to her two heads, 'AM I really breathing air or is it just the <br />
natural instinct?'<br />
<br />
Martha wondered if this was how the Alice in Lewis Carol's original book felt about the <br />
fantastically illogical peoples and things in the underground.<br />
<br />
Alice in contrast to the pretty golden kimono Samantha was wearing with her hair down: <br />
Alice had her hair done up in a pair of chopsticks and was wearing a kimono showing off <br />
wolves depicted within the four seasons in a flowing style. This held a particular nostalgic <br />
feelings for Martha when Martha remembered wolves were extinct in Japan.<br />
<br />
"Hey," Abbey asked flaying with the scarf that came with the fuku, "Do you think we'll still <br />
have all our new dresses if we're wearing them when we stepped out of the mirror and <br />
then stepped back in?"<br />
<br />
Alice, always the brave one as well as the curious one, said simply, "Only one way to find <br />
out." Alice calmly stepped out of the dinning room mirror, turning into bald naked glass <br />
as she silently stepped down. Alice then stepped right back in. She was in her normal <br />
attire, but in her arms suddenly was the kimono she had been wearing along with the <br />
chop sticks. <br />
<br />
"That settles that." Samantha said as the pups then exited the mirror with their nanny. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Zack had very carefully text messaged his parents where 'she' was so they would come <br />
straight to the manor. Their car was destine to be sliced up as the Perkins had been. This <br />
would keep things clean. On the plus side, given their previous behavior, Zackery's <br />
parents were more than likely to come straight here. So that was one less thing to worry <br />
about.<br />
<br />
And then Beatrice had begun to run through with a new message about it being lunch <br />
time. With Roger out of the game, and Zack and Lawrence having the world fairly divided <br />
between them, the males got up and headed for the dinning area, Pearl and June hanging <br />
on Zackery's arms. <br />
<br />
Sarah and Ulysses came in from the backyard where they had been playing -tag-! At <br />
Sarah's insistence. She knew Ulysses wasn't an eight year old, but she felt it was better to <br />
let go of some things sometimes.  <br />
<br />
Chester had been doing what he had been doing mostly since arriving at the estate when <br />
not in the company of the girls, hiding in Mr. P's shadow. <br />
<br />
Anne managed to 'sneak' back into the mansion with none of the she wolves paying her <br />
mind or thinking what she had done was somehow in violation of anything Master had told <br />
them. She also didn't she why she needed to tell anyone about Serena, after all, it had <br />
been just a friendly Sunday chat with a fellow church goer, it wasn't like she had blabbed <br />
to the enemy or anything. <br />
<br />
Nicole entered the dinning room riding on Nick's back, enjoying him giving her a piggy <br />
back ride her trademark ribbon streaming behind her. Alexandra calmly and dignified <br />
walking behind her. <br />
<br />
Sandi did her beset not to look anyone in the eye, Terri just hugged her. <br />
<br />
Jasmine this time was the one elected to drag out their feeding. Technically speaking, <br />
having the same meat diet at each meal almost should have been becoming monotone by <br />
now, but somehow the wolves just didn't care. <br />
<br />
Kaylee of course was sitting next to Jensen, with the pups behind them each of the glass <br />
wolves in the laps of their respective mother, each mother with the same smile and <br />
twinkle in their eye. <br />
<br />
Jensen stood up, giving all the she wolves a good view of his wolf hood which all the she <br />
wolves very much enjoyed. <br />
<br />
"Hey, where's Caroline?" Megan asked sitting next (if somewhat distant) to her brother. <br />
<br />
Ashley looked at her, "You can pick her out missing out of our entire pack?"<br />
<br />
"She is our fore-wolf."<br />
<br />
 "Ah, right." Ashley nodded.<br />
<br />
"My family and my pack." Jensen said stopping all discussions at once. "Caroline as I'm <br />
sure some of you saw have brought the day workers who have upgraded the estate's gate <br />
into our pack as a reward for their services. And you shall be introduced to your new pack <br />
mates quickly. But first, I wish to show you Caroline, or as she wishes s to now call her, <br />
Cobalt."<br />
<br />
The cobalt colored she wolf stepped out of where she had been waiting in the kitchen area <br />
for all of the pack to see her. There were a number of gasps, some just blinked. Nick <br />
actually commented 'Cool!' (A sentiment shared by Kevin and Bart.) <br />
<br />
"Curiouser, and curiouser." Alice said to herself. "Though I fear things may become too <br />
curious for us." <br />
 <br />
"As you see, a unknown choice of words in Caroline's Transform resulted in Caroline's <br />
mutation into Cobalt. This is why Alice shall now oversee the wording of all T.O.Ds save in <br />
life and death situations."<br />
<br />
All the wolves nodded, "Caroline, or Cobalt as she wishes now to be called, now resembled <br />
the rest of your thirteen new pack members. This now puts our numbers at fifty-one. <br />
Enough to insure our short term survival. However due to a glitch in Zackery's bringing in <br />
of the pack, his parent too must by necessary be brought into the pack as well this <br />
evening. I do this with great hesitation, for Zackery's glitch and Caroline's alterations <br />
prove the game is infallible in it's interpretations of our Transforms and by logic our Dares <br />
as well.  Thus why Alice must look over everything, for she understands language better <br />
than any of us and thus why she was the one to phrase the Transform that insured we <br />
would never have our wolf hood stolen from us."<br />
<br />
There were some cheered at Alice for them, the glass wolf would have blushed if she <br />
could. <br />
<br />
"All of you have heard by now our retreat in case living in Glendale becomes impossible <br />
for us. Caroline and the new additions to our pack shall be acting as it's care takers, with <br />
help with Alice and her cousins/half-sisters they will be able to work on preparing and <br />
maintaining the retreat without putting any new pressure on the estate.  Only after the <br />
shadows establish themselves in the world of business within and around Glendale, and <br />
the detective Madam Serenity is dealt with, can we ever hope to move onto creating <br />
enough of our species for us to survive long term opposed to short term. And at that <br />
time, we will expand beyond the manor. But that day is not today, tomorrow, the day <br />
after, next week, next month, or next year. <br />
<br />
"Only once the six shadows have legally and economically become an unquestioned factor <br />
of Glendale's life, can we hope to be legally and economically shielded from any <br />
unforeseen happenstance that might occur. Which is why tomorrow the six shadows will <br />
be sent out into Glendale with the Smith's business and financial resources in their arsenal <br />
to begin their purpose in full scale. And during the time that the shadows are establishing <br />
themselves, we will be adding to the pack's numbers the old fashioned way."<br />
<br />
Everyone blushed, giggled, laughed, clapped or sniggered at this.<br />
<br />
"Now let me introduce the gem wolves who shall be the care takers of our safety measure <br />
to insure the pack shall have a future long after the rest of us are gone."<br />
<br />
So one by one the gem colored wolves entered. It took a moment for them to realize <br />
Jasper was male, but unlike Roger or Lawrence, Jasper just seemed to grin at this. It also <br />
took a moment for the pack to realize Amber was a female and no a girlie male like Jasper <br />
given how maternal material had been handed out among the pack, but she stuck out her <br />
flat chest with pride.  <br />
<br />
Lazuli turned some heads.  With Coral and Touramline, Maxine suddenly didn't feel so <br />
lonely anymore.  Emerald, Ruby, Topaz, Goldie, Carnelian, and Garnet all made their <br />
entrances, all with the same solid color eyes as Caroline now had. <br />
<br />
Martha having six eyes of the same motif herself, could appreciate these new women. <br />
<br />
Opal was more quickly identified as male than Jasper (both having the same long full hair <br />
as the she wolves and that cute daisy in their hair) but again he didn't seem to mind in the <br />
least. <br />
<br />
 And of course there was Amethyst. How her back muscles were able to support the <br />
weights on her chest was super human in of itself. When she turned one way she actually <br />
gently smacked Garnet with them (Garnet being the shortest of the lot). Yet she seemed to <br />
smile and beam even more than the rest, seeming totally oblivious to all the males staring <br />
at her glorified milk factories acting as if in a pleasant day dream. Some began to wonder <br />
what had been in that Transform Caroline had used on HER. <br />
<br />
When thought about, the size of the size wolves' maternal materials as a whole wasn't all <br />
that illogical. They were all six feet tall at the least, and the triplets and Kaylee were all <br />
seven feet tall. Quite taller than the average human and human female in particular. And <br />
given the logical appetite of what those things would be eventually feeding, it could <br />
almost be considered justified. <br />
<br />
"Alice."<br />
<br />
"Yes Father?" Alice curtsied. <br />
<br />
"I want you to examine how Zackery will speak the Transform to his parents, close any <br />
loopholes. After that, you are to take Cobalt and the rest of the gem wolves to the retreat <br />
at where you were told before, the reflective water's surface should provide you with an <br />
entrance and exit, feel free to bring along a mundane mirror with you. The gem wolves will <br />
know what to do when they arrive. You will leave them there to do as they will until they <br />
are to return to the manor which will be done by you or one of your cousins. You or one of <br />
them will be needed in this task perpetually from on as they migrate from the estate to <br />
the island as need be."<br />
<br />
Alice curtsied one more time, "As you wish father."<br />
<br />
Beatrice asked of Cobalt, "So did it hurt at all?"<br />
<br />
"No, I didn't even notice it had happened until I looked in a window. I was quite freaked <br />
out let me tell you, but now I completely fit in with the rest, we're a complete team of <br />
fourteen to create and safeguard our home away from home."<br />
<br />
"That nice." Beatrice replied calmly. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
"Hello brother, I'm surprised to see you out and about..." Said a black cat looking a little <br />
smaller than Judas. "You know what everyone thinks of you."<br />
<br />
"Yes I know. But this is more important than that." Judas replied speaking to the other cat <br />
on a room top. Unlike Judas, this cat didn't have a collar. <br />
<br />
"It had better be if it's going to convince big brother. He still refuses to accept you're living <br />
with a human in the house of a human god and have abandoned Bast."<br />
<br />
Judas chose not to bring up his reasons again for converting to Christianity. "Little brother. <br />
A new breed of dog has appeared in Glendale. They walk on two legs and are larger than <br />
humans and are treated more or less as equals by humans."<br />
<br />
"You have GOT to be joking! Or you're now as crazy as everyone else thinks you are." <br />
<br />
"I am neither little brother. And there's more, they seriously injured a tom and killed a <br />
queen."<br />
<br />
"... isn't this taking this sort of thing a little bit far, if big brother-"<br />
<br />
"It is NOT a sick joke little brother! I swear it! These wild dogs are very real. They were <br />
created by The Game..."<br />
<br />
".... ... " The small black cat stared and back away a bit, "No."<br />
<br />
"Yes."<br />
<br />
"... Big brother please..."<br />
<br />
"There are now over thirty of these dogs now little brother. Possibly more. But the tom <br />
and his human have a possibly solution in mind, but they need something very important <br />
first."<br />
<br />
"Big brother no! Please no!"<br />
<br />
"Yes little brother. We need to find a human in Glendale not loyal to these two legged wild <br />
dogs that currently has a turn of The Game."<br />
<br />
".... Most cats besides our line don't know about the game... do you really want to tell <br />
them this?"<br />
<br />
"They'll believe you and big brother. And don't forget I still have friends AND family. <br />
They'll be asking around too one way or the other, so it's a moot point."<br />
<br />
"Okay big brother, okay, I will, I'll begin to spread the word. For the sake of Bast's perfect <br />
creations I will. But you better speak with your secret friends and get home before Bigger <br />
Big Brother tries to tear off your parts again."<br />
<br />
"I'm sure he's not going to try that again after last time."<br />
<br />
".... on that big brother we agree on."<br />
<br />
The two black cat parted ways. Lewis making sure his scent wasn't followed visited a slew <br />
of cats brother named and stray to begin listening around for a human who had a turn of <br />
the game who could be used in the neutralization of the giant two legged wild dogs.<br />
<br />
Mary looked up at the roof and said to herself, "I wonder what is they talk about. Likely <br />
just mice and fish..." <br />
<br />
++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
"So," Alice said looking over the piece of paper, "So you wish to have their genders <br />
switched,  the boy to have pale pink fur, the girl to have white fur with red highlights. For <br />
them to be both eight years old. And to keep their adult IQ Scores so they'll be more <br />
useful to the pack?"<br />
<br />
"Yes, and the rest."<br />
<br />
"I don't think we can safely erase the memory of their existences from history and <br />
everyone's minds not of the pack. Or people will start looking for a orphan Zylphia or the <br />
game might accidently erase of memories of you or you might lose your own memories <br />
since you logically wouldn't be able to exist without parents. That will most decidedly have <br />
to be left out."<br />
<br />
"Ah I see. And the last part."<br />
<br />
"I must admit I am surprised, but I am also intrigued."<br />
<br />
"I figured it's a logical step, given that the game is beginning to prove rather unruly lately. <br />
They'll keep us from needing to use it for the most mundane of things."<br />
<br />
"Any human either of them touch who is not subservient and loyal to the pack unlike the <br />
shadows, and whom either of them call a 'Big Bad Wolf' will become such with their gender <br />
altering to sustain our gender ratio with memories of their human life erased from <br />
everyone else, and the new wolves themselves loyal to the pack without question and <br />
loving utterly and unconditionally the Master, my father? With the normal contact memory <br />
revival sub-clause?"<br />
<br />
"I'm also considering them able to alter humans into pups with different phrasing but I'm <br />
worried it might trip them up if they get scared and panic."<br />
<br />
 "I see... there is one important thing you forgot to add?"<br />
<br />
"What?"<br />
<br />
"The clause I wrote for the pack that will make their wolf selves impossible to be undone."<br />
<br />
"Oh... yeah... right..."<br />
<br />
"Though I will admit the idea of wolves who can create new wolves for us without the limit <br />
Martha has of it being on the full moon is practical. And keep us from having to use the <br />
game is very practical. And since it is on a trigger that means accidents can be avoided."<br />
<br />
"Master did say I had freedom to transform them however I pleased. I am not violating his <br />
will."<br />
<br />
"Yes... he did..."Alice said thinking it over.  "Very well, let me write out the Transform, if it <br />
meet with your approval I shall be on my way with the new gemstone colored wolves."<br />
<br />
"Thank you Alice."<br />
<br />
"Welcome Mister Zackery..."</p>
