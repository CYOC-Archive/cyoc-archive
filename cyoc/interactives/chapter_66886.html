<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jon was running back towards his house with his softening dick painfully bouncing. He didn't understand what happened to his clothes or why <br />
he just humiliated himself in front of his neighbours but he knew he had to get away.<br />
<br />
Ty stopped laughing for long enough to catch his breath and waived a finger at his fleeing naked neighbour. Jon stopped in his tracks, seemed <br />
to loose his balance then dropped onto all fours. He looked behind him at the 2 boys who started laughing again and he tried to stand up. To <br />
his horror he couldn't keep his balance and fell back down onto all fours. <br />
<br />
He turned back to the laughing boys and the stunned looking June. &quot;You're doing this somehow aren't you?! You fuckers! stop it!&quot;, he called <br />
out. June's expression changed to one perfectly relaxed as she turned to the boys, &quot;Boys&quot;, she said, &quot;leave that poor dog alone and come back <br />
into the house&quot;. She then turned and walked back inside.<br />
<br />
Just then, Jon's girlfriend walked out of their house and look down at the naked Jon on all fours on the lawn. &quot;I don't know whats happening&quot;, <br />
Jon tried to explain, he looked totally embarrassed. &quot;Oh there you are.&quot; his Girlfriend said totally unfazed, &quot;thats a good doggy&quot;. She then <br />
started petting Jon's head. &quot;What the fuck are you doing?&quot;, Jon yelled at her. &quot;Help me up!&quot; His Girlfriend didn't seem to understand him. &quot;Don't <br />
you bark at me!, Bad doggy! she said.  &quot;It's me, Jon; you stupid bitch!&quot; Jon screamed. &quot;That's it!&quot; she replied, &quot;I'm putting your collar back on&quot;. <br />
Then to Jon's dismay, she put a collar on him and and tied the leash to the porch stairs. She walked back into the house. &quot;What the fuck?!&quot; Jon <br />
screamed. He reached up to untie the collar from his neck but somehow no matter how hard he concentrated, he couldn't seem to move his <br />
fingers the right way. He started yanking at the collar and screaming then he started biting at the leash in frustration.  He finally tired of this <br />
and looked up at the 2 boys who were still laughing at him. &quot;What the fuck have you done?&quot; He asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well since you acted like such a jerk as a man&quot;, Ty responded, &quot;I decided you are going to have to live like a dog for a while&quot;. Jon was <br />
dumbfounded. &quot;You will find that no one but us can see you or understand you as a man, and you will only be able to do things that dog's can <br />
do&quot;. &quot;You cant be serious!&quot; Jon said, now sounding quite afraid. He tried to stand up again unsuccessfully. &quot;Cut this shit out!&quot;, Jon screamed as <br />
fell back down. Ty continued, &quot;You should be thankful. I left your body the same instead of actually turning you into a dog. I did that because I <br />
enjoy seeing your hot body naked. Especially seeing you helpless like this&quot;.  &quot;I knew it!&quot; Jon shouted, &quot;I knew you were a fagot! &quot; As soon as he <br />
said it, he regretted it; It was beginning to sink in that his life was actually in the hands of this little fagot.  &quot;You actually got quite a nice dick <br />
and low hanging balls there&quot;, Ty teased; &quot;You are a little on the hairy side for my taste but yore still really attractive. Maybe we should get you <br />
to Jerk off for us again, only I guess as a dog your going to have to do it by licking yourself&quot;. &quot;That will be fun to watch&quot;, Dustin  added. <br />
<br />
Jon turned more red and he crouched up trying to hide his package. &quot;Look guys&quot;, he said changing his tone to one more friendly, &quot;you cant <br />
leave me like this. I have a life to live, I have a girlfriend and a job&quot;. &quot;Well not anymore&quot;, Ty interrupted, &quot;for now you have a dog's life so you <br />
might as well get use to it until I decide you deserve your human life back&quot;.<br />
<br />
Just then Jon's girlfriend came back outside, &quot;Ok little Jonny, time for walkie to the dog park&quot;, &quot;Dog park?!&quot;, Jon exclaimed, &quot;like this? I cant go <br />
in public like this!&quot;.  &quot;Oh whats the matter?&quot; she answered petting his head. All she could hear were pathetic dog wines. &quot;You have to go poop? <br />
&quot;Just wait till we get to the park, I don't want that mess on the lawn&quot;. She then untied the leash and started trying to lead the naked man <br />
towards the street. Jon resisted and fought back. &quot;Whats your problem today?&quot; his Girlfriend said, &quot;I'm going to have to get you neutered&quot;. &quot;No!&quot; <br />
Jon yelled and then let her drag him across the lawn. &quot;Jenni baby&quot;, he implored, &quot;don't you recognize me?&quot; &quot;Come on doggy&quot;, she said as she <br />
yanked his leash. &quot;Please please, I'm sorry&quot; he turned and called to the Ty and Dustin. He was having trouble keeping up with Jenni walking on <br />
his hands and knees.  The collar being pulled faster than he could crawl, kept choking him causing him to gasp and cough. &quot;I promise to never <br />
to be mean to you again.. really!&quot; He tried shouting back but by now he was out on the side-walk being led away. <br />
<br />
'I feel a bit sorry for him&quot;, Dustin commented. &quot;OK, lets make it a bit easier for him&quot;. Suddenly Jon was able to stand more easily on his hands <br />
and feet and didn't have to crawl on his knees. With some relief Jon got up into this new comfortable but humiliating position. His ass was now <br />
high in the air as he easily bounded on all fours after his master. This gave a great view of Jon's furry crack and of his balls swinging between <br />
his legs. Ty called after him, now be a good dogie so you don't get neutered and we will talk later. Poor humiliated Jon kept on trying to talk to <br />
his girlfriend but to no avail as she led him away to his new dog life.</p>
