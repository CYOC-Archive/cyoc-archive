<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For the rest of the school day, Mr. Huff enjoyed his new body, especially being naked, only covered in fur, his privates exposed to the world. Mr. Huff did not care in the slightest, he had always been somewhat of a “nudist”, he loved running around naked as a kid and teenager, even in as an adult, when he was by himself in his apartment, he took no time to get out of his clothes and enjoy a nice meal in front of the TV in the nude. Though the main reason for his enjoyment is the look of nervousness on the faces of the students, which have a hard time to not stare at the anthropomorphic Wolf, Mr. Huff smirks the whole time at their tomato red faces. ‘This is awesome,’ he thinks to himself, ‘if I had known back when I was a child or teenager, that there is a device which can transform people, I’d have so much fun with it.’ Back as a teenager and even as a kid, Mr. Huff was pretty mean, especially towards the “weak”, his mean persona is caused by his dad, who was a sergeant in the Army and who treated his men with no respect. Mr. Huff’s dad had always told him, that the only way for people to do as told is to put them in their place, even though they might suffer under some kind of trauma or physical wounds. Because of this Mr. Huff is feared, now as a human-wolf hybrid he is even more feared, which fills Mr. Huff with huge pleasure.<br />
<br />
After his last class ends and the last student left, Mr. Huff stretches and strokes through his fur, “hehe, I just love my new form,” he says to himself, “thanks to my new legs I am so much taller, which makes me look much more intimidating, and I LOVE it!” The former human then looks at the clock above the door, “time to meet Jeffy-boy,” he says with a grin, he grabs his stuff and Jeff’s phone and starts to head for the door, but he stops as he remembers that everyone thinks he had always been a hybrid, that means Jeff does too. Mr. Huff smirks, he opens the App and pulls up Jeff’s file and turns the boy’s awareness of the transformation he had done to himself on, ‘let’s see how he’ll react,’ the wolf thinks to himself, grinning as he makes his way to the meeting spot behind the school’s building.<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff walks out of the building and turns left, he walks around the school and pauses as he reaches the far corner. The Hybrid carefully peeks around the corner and grins when he sees Jeff standing with his back turned to him, ‘let’s give the weakling a nice scare,’ he thinks to himself. Mr. Huff slowly starts to creep up towards Jeff and stops a foot behind the boy, he then grins and lets out an animalistic growl, his grin widens, showing his sharp pointy white teeth, when Jeff’s body tenses.<br />
<br />
Already nervous and tensed, Jeff does not notice Mr. Huff creep up on him, he then suddenly hears a growl, which sounds like a huge dog or wolf, right behind him. The teen tenses and grows pale, he gulps as he slowly turns around, then he lets out a terrified scream and jumps back a few feet when he spots the huge human-wolf standing behind him, “WAAAAAAH! WHA-WHAT THE F…,” the boy shouts.<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff bursts out laughing, “hello there, Jeffy-boy,” he says, grinning, “do you recognize me?”<br />
<br />
Jeff’s eyes widen, he knows that there is only one person who calls him that, “n-no way… no freaking way,” he mumbles, “M-Mr. Huff!?”<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff grins wide, showing off his new teeth, his yellow eyes seeming to glow with domination. “Before my transformation, I thought you were a squirt,” he says, as he towers over the boy, “now you look even smaller and weaker.”<br />
<br />
Jeff can’t believe it, his bully of a teacher just went ahead and used the App on himself, turning himself into a huge and intimidating wolf-man. Being just a 5’7’’ teenager, Jeff has to strain his neck to be able to look up at Mr. Huff, who, thanks to his digitigrade legs, now seems to be at least 8’ tall.<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff can’t stop grinning as he stares down at the teen, who is at least two heads shorter, this situation just fills Mr. Huff with an even stronger feeling of dominance and power. Even under his fur his muscles are noticeable. As a human Mr. Huff took pride in his body, the years of training in the Gym really paid off, he always had been taller than others, even as a kid and teen. Mr. Huff did never want to over do it, he never wanted to end up just muscles, he always has been careful to keep his muscle-mass at a normal percent, not to little and not to much, just right for his height. Now as a grown up, now wolf-man, Mr. Huff only goes once or twice a week to the Gym to work out, just to keep his muscle level constant.<br />
<br />
Jeff finally breaks the silence by asking, “wh-why… why did you do th-that?”<br />
<br />
The former human chuckles, “you made me curious,” he says, “I know, I said that I want a demonstration after school… but I guess I couldn’t wait,” he adds with a grin.<br />
<br />
Jeff gulps hard when he is again confronted by those sharp teeth, “bu-but why… a W-Wolf?”<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff looks down at himself, then he shrugs, “it just suits me,” he says, “not only because of my last name, but also because of my dominant and alpha-like personality.” The wolf-man looks down at the boy, grinning, “what do you think? I am curious to know your opinion, did I make the right choice?”<br />
<br />
Jeff is silent, ‘I got to watch out, I really don’t want him to get mad,’ he thinks to himself, “it… it honestly does suit you,” he then says, looking up and down his teacher, blushing when his eyes land on the huge sheath.<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff smirks when he notices Jeff’s eyes on his crotch, “tell me, Jeffy-boy,” he says, “do you think, with my new body, that I will have a chance with women? I really never were lucky when I was still human.”<br />
<br />
Again Jeff is silent, ‘great, now he wants to know if he can nail a woman looking like a Wolf, or if the women will flea at the first sight of him,’ he thinks to himself. “Um… I…,” he starts to say, “I… I would th-think so… .”<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff tilts his head, which actually makes him look kind of cute, “you don’t very convinced,” he says.<br />
<br />
“I… mean… I really d-don’t know,” Jeff says, “I… I am not a woman… and I am n-not into m-men… s-so I can’t say if w-women would f-find you attractive. Th-They might fl-flea out of fear.”<br />
<br />
“Maybe,” Mr. Huff says, “but let that be my problem. I’d just like to know if I look more handsome as a Wolf-Man than when I was human.”<br />
<br />
“I…,” Jeff starts, then hesitates, Mr. Huff senses that Jeff is nervous.<br />
<br />
The Teacher-turned-Wolf-Man rolls his eyes, “Jesus Jeffy-boy,” he says, “it can’t be that hard to answer the question: Do you think I look more handsome as a Wolf-Man than a Human? Why so nervous? Scared I’d jump you and have some “fun” with you?”<br />
<br />
Jeff says no word, he simply nods his head, to nervous and afraid to speak.<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff chuckles, “I my be a dominant bastard, but I am no pedophile nor gay,” he says, “so, just answer my question.”<br />
<br />
“If… If I t-tell you, sir,” Jeff asks carefully, “w-would you g-give me back my ph-phone and… let me go ho-home? I… I am already l-late and I d-don’t want my m-mom scream at me.”<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff sighs, “just tell her, that I held you up because you needed to do something for me.”<br />
<br />
Jeff lets out a snort, “she won’t believe me,” he says with a frown.<br />
<br />
“Then tell her to call me,” Mr. Huff replies, “here, let me give you my number,” before Jeff could respond, Mr. Huff already brings up Jeff’s phone and types into it. He then looks back at the boy, “and to answer your question: yes, I’ll give back your phone and let you go, IF you answer MY question, NOW,” growling the last word.<br />
<br />
Jeff gulps hard at the growl, “o-okay… f-fine,” he says, he then takes a deep breath and lets out a sigh, “yes, you do look a lot more handsome than before.”<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff grins, “there, that wasn’t to hard now was it,” he asks.<br />
<br />
“I guess… n-not,” Jeff replies, “s-so may I have my phone back now and go home, pl-please?”<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff nods, he hands Jeff the phone, “I keep what I promise,” he says, “I will see you tomorrow in class, don’t be late… pup,” he says with a grin.<br />
<br />
Jeff takes his phone, happy to have it back, “I… I will, sir,” he says, “th-thank you, sir. Ha-Have a n-nice evening.”<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff grins, “oh, I most certainly WILL,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jeff knows exactly what Mr. Huff meant by that, so without another word, the boy turns and starts to walk away at a fast pace, which soon turns into a jog and then a full on run.<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff watches Jeff leave and laughs, “what a little scaredy-cat. Watching him run like that, makes him look like some prey running from a predator,” he says, then his eyes widen and he grins, “now, THERE is an idea! I’ll have to get my hands... I mean PAWS on that App, I hope I&#39;ll find it in the App-store on my phone. I’ll have so much fun with it,” with that the Wolf-Man starts to walk to the teacher’s car park, grinning all the way at the thought of what he’ll do with “Jeffy-boy”, the other students and his colleagues… and BOSS.</p>
