<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Paul and Lilah two looked at each other in immense concern as they grabbed their things and followed Ben out of the room. They walked at a brisk pace, but the boy was practically running. Ben doubled over in pain and the two caught up with him, crying into Paul’s arms as he went in for a hug. Paul taken aback, looks at Lilah in concern, to which she doesn’t respond.<br />
<br />
<br />
When Ben releases the hug, Paul gets a good look at his face. It had pushed out into some sort of prototype muzzle, and his shoulder was sprouting hairs right before his eyes!<br />
<br />
<br />
“Jesus Ben, what the hell is going on here?” He asked his brother.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ben just shook his head, sniffling and letting out an occasional grunt of pain.<br />
<br />
<br />
“We should get him back to his dorm before anyone sees.”<br />
<br />
<br />
The twins looked over to Lilah, who motioned for them to follow her towards the building entrance. Paul & Lilah helped guide the changing boy back to the male dormitories, Lilah entering with them despite the rule against different sexes in each of the dorms on campus. They made their way to the Skurts’ room and sat Ben down on the bed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lilah stood up and walked to the door. “I better get going, I can’t be seen in the male dorms. You have my number if you need me. Update me on what the hell is happening when you find out.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Paul was surprised at Lilah’s departure despite the absolute insanity of his brother’s condition, but didn’t question it. He turned his attention to his brother, who was holding his arm in pain.<br />
<br />
<br />
“I need you to tell me what happened last night.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Ben shut his eyes tight while grimacing in pain, and Paul heard a series of cracks come from somewhere within his body. The brown hairs were still sprouting on Ben’s upper arm, and were swiftly spreading to any surrounding flesh that hadn’t yet been affected.<br />
<br />
<br />
“I… was walking home when I hea- when I heard a noise in the woods. I- I went to investigate like a moron… and something swiped at me. It was definitely a wolf… or something like one. It wa- it walked on two feet, and I swear to God it had to have been over seven feet tall. I fuckin- I fucking ran my ass off until I reached our window.” <br />
<br />
<br />
Paul watched in horror as his twin bent over in pain, and noticed that Ben’s shoulder was growing in size. The muscles began to pulse and slowly inflate, before it was disproportionate to the rest of his body.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Ben, we’re going to have to get someone to check you out. I know this looks bad, but there’s a possibility that whatever this is can be stopped.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Paul turned to leave, but his brother grabbed his shoulder and stopped him.<br />
<br />
<br />
“There is nothing to help with this. I think I’m becoming something similar to what attacked me. That creature. One of the students at the science department went missing last night, never showed up to his dorms. I- ack- I think he’s what attacked me.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Paul looked at his brother in concern. He knew he was most likely right, but he didn’t know what to say. Suddenly, his brother screamed out in extreme anguish, his back arching forwards and being locked into place. Ben’s wounded arm began to transform before Paul’s eyes, gaining mass as it went down towards his hand. Claws burst from his nails, and Paul knew he needed to find help. Badly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Paul rounded over his shoulder and reached out for the door handle when he heard his brother yell at him from behind as he ran out of the room and down the hall. Suddenly, he felt a heavy impact on the back of his head, and everything went dark.<br />
<br />
<br />
———————————————————————————————————<br />
<br />
<br />
When Paul came to, he was in a bed. By the time his vision cleared, he realized a figure was standing over him.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Hey buddy, you doing alright?”<br />
<br />
<br />
The blurred figure came to, and Arty was soon standing over him. Paul rubbed his eyes, realizing his head was still throbbing in pain from his brother’s sudden attack.<br />
<br />
<br />
“I found you sprawled out in the hall, figured you tripped and hit your head pretty hard. You doing alright?”<br />
<br />
<br />
Paul looked up at his friend, who had a genuine look of concern on his face. Paul stood up and rubbed his head, realizing he was in Arty’s dorm.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Hey, where are you going? You’ve got a nasty bump on the back of your head, man!”<br />
<br />
<br />
“I have to find my brother. Something’s happening to him, and I need to be there for him.”<br />
<br />
<br />
It was that he looked out the window and saw that it was night.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Arty,” he began slowly, “how long have I been out for?”<br />
<br />
<br />
His friend paused. “Well, it’s about nine right now. I found you around noon.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Paul’s mind raced. He and his brother returned to the dorms at 10 that morning. It had been a full eleven hours since he was knocked out. He turned and began making his way down his hall.<br />
<br />
<br />
On the way, he passed by a room with its door partially open, easily hearing two people having intercourse from within the room.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Jesus Christ, who the hell would do it with the door open, let alone so loudly? They are going at it hard,” he thought to himself. He could even hear the muffled grunting and moaning as he continued down the hall, disgusted with his fellow students.<br />
<br />
<br />
When he reached his room, he was concerned to see his door not shut the whole way. He slowly creaked open the door and was shocked at the sight.<br />
<br />
<br />
The room was a complete disaster, and it smelled horrible. Ben’s bed was dislodged and his sheets partially torn apart. The window was cracked, broken glass littering the floor and windowsill. Ripped clothing lay in threads around the room, and a questionable murky substance lied in a puddle in the middle of the room.<br />
<br />
<br />
Disturbed at the sight, he shined his phone’s flashlight at it, and it was obvious what the abnormally large puddle consisted of. Suddenly, he heard a short yell and a thump down the hall where he came from. Startled, he turned and had another realization. There were claw marks along the walls near the door, which his eyes followed up until they were at head level.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Holy shit,” he thought. Whatever his brother had become, it was tall as hell. He glanced back at the puddle. “And I don’t want to know what that’s about.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Taking a step into the hall, he looked down the way he came and saw that the room that he had previously questioned about their open intercourse was now open. He slowly and silently crept down the hall and peeked in, disturbed at the state of this room, which was nearly as bad as his.<br />
<br />
<br />
The beds in this room were also out of place, and deep scratch marks covered the floor and one of the walls. With his flashlight, he was able to see that there were more splatters of a white, murky substance across the floor, as well as tattered clothing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Continuing down the hall, more carefully than before, he approached Arty’s room. To his surprise, his friend’s door was now open as well, and a feeling of dread came over him as he heard questionable sounds from the lounge just ahead.<br />
<br />
<br />
Walking past Arty’s room, failing to see a large scratch across the side of the door, the sounds of grunting, shuffling, and muffled yelling could be heard from around the corner. Paul prepared himself for the worst and peeked around the corner, but nothing could prepare him for what he saw next.<br />
<br />
<br />
Right in the middle of the room was a massive wolf. It had to be nearly twice Paul’s size, and it was positioned over something. Its fur was brown and disheveled, and Paul could see a bloody scar just over its right shoulder.<br />
<br />
<br />
“No… it… Ben?” He thought. His thoughts went frantic. Was that thing truly his brother? If it was, would it remember him? What could have caused this?<br />
<br />
<br />
He stealthily approached his brother, slowly moving along the wall until he could see what he was doing, hearing the muffled yelling from below the beast.<br />
<br />
<br />
Paul’s eyes went wide open when he saw the scene unfolding before him. Below the dire wolf was none other than Arty, tears streaming down his face. He was being held down to the ground by Ben, who was happily panting and grunting above the poor boy. Arty’s mouth was wrapped around the wolf’s member, which was being forced deep into his mouth. <br />
<br />
<br />
Arty saw Paul out of the corner of his eyes, and his frantic yelling soon became gurgling as the beast ejaculated into his mouth. Arty’s body was also suffering changes similar to those Ben was. His hands were growing outwards and developing claws, and his face had begun pushing out into some sort of muzzle. However, rather than growing fur similar to Ben’s, his came in orange with black stripes.<br />
<br />
<br />
“A tiger?” Paul asked himself, frozen in shock. Then, he put two and two together, realizing what was happening in that one room earlier, with the loud sex.<br />
<br />
<br />
Paul didn’t stick around to see what would happen next. He didn’t even try to get his former brother’s attention. He turned and began running down the hallway, noticing that there was similar sounds of forced sex all around him.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Holy shit, how many people did Ben manage to get while I was out? How many are infected?!”<br />
<br />
<br />
Making it to the entrance of the building, Paul didn’t stop running until he reached his car. Jumping inside, he locked the doors and looked around. To his horror, there were beasts everywhere, running around the campus. He spotted at least two students being forced into sex at different places in the courtyard. He counted at least thirteen other beasts making their way around, mainly around the forest and the science facility.<br />
<br />
<br />
Using the number she gave him, Paul called Lilah. As his phone continued to ring, he began to break down into tears. He knew she had to be gone too. Turning the keys in the ignition, Paul was ready to drive off-campus when there was banging on his side window. To his surprise, a student had made it to his car, another creature not far behind. He quickly opened the door for him, but the animal managed to grab the boy and pull him away from the car, the guy screaming as he was thrown back like he weighed nothing. Paul shifted into drive and sped out of the area, hoping he could reach the city before the beasts did.</p>
