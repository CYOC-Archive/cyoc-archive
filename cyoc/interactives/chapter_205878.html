<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your first day as &#39;Steve&#39; had come to a close. You had done pretty well, a few slip ups and some trouble with a few names. But nothing major that nobody chalked up to anything but you just coming back from a medical operation. Obviously it hadn&#39;t been disclosed that the operation you&#39;ve been at had been one to swap bodies. Rather, people had been told it had been a benign growth you had opted to have removed. But with that came some &#39;temporary&#39; memory problems. <br />
<br />
You had done okay in sales. Luckily for you, it mostly involved checking in on clients you already had at the company. Your company sold security, so when you checked in, you mostly talked about how things were working out and if they had any other needs or were expanding to other sites etc. You had even done a sale by just asking these things. Your father had been right when he said you&#39;d do fine at his job. <br />
<br />
As you got through the door, everyone else was already home. Your mother was in the kitchen. Probably prepping for dinner. Your father was in the living room. He had brought your friends over. His friends now thought. The anger you felt towards him was swelling back up. <br />
&quot;Hey dad!&quot; He said, quickly returning to the game on the TV he was playing with his new buddies. &quot;Oh, Hi honey&quot; your mother shouted from the kitchen, not to break character. But you could tell as you looked at her that she looked uncomfortable saying it. &quot;Hi Hon&quot; You answered, equally uncomfortable. This was your new reality as soon as somebody came over. You went into the kitchen to help your mother with dinner prep. As you stood in silence you could overhear your father and your old friends talking. They were chatting about girls. You could bet good money your father had initialized that conversation. They talked about who was hot and who was not. You heard your father talk about a girl named Susie who he apparently found to be a &quot;total babe&quot;. Your friends agreed but then proceeded to poke fun at your father for liking her. Asking if he was going to ask her out etc. It felt terribly weird hearing your father talk about some 16 year old girl as a &quot;total babe&quot; but it got even weirder when he answered his new group of friends with a &quot;Well, what if I will?&quot;. Your father was already thinking about asking girls out? You looked over at your mother who had also heard the conversation. She looked upset. No wonder. Her husband of 20 years was now her son. Her husband of 20 years was 16 and talking about teenage girls he found hot loudly in her vicinity. Her husband was clearly enjoying being &#39;David&#39; and was already giving no damns about twenty years of love. Her husband was looking for new, greener pastures. She then looked over at you and said &quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot;. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m getting upset when you&#39;ve got an even worse deal then me&quot; Your mother added. She was upset but still looking out for you. You couldn&#39;t help thinking your father was being a major jerk. He was too busy enjoying being young again that he just couldn&#39;t see how anyone else was feeling in this situation. <br />
<br />
As you finished making dinner together in silence, your father sent &#39;his&#39; friends home. As he came into the kitchen he asked &quot;Mom, Dad... What&#39;s for dinner?&quot;. You gave him an annoyed look. &quot;Dad... My friends have left, you don&#39;t have to call us mom and dad anymore&quot; you said. &quot;Actually, I think you need to look in the mirror DAD, because they&#39;re MY friends and I don&#39;t think you should call me dad. Call me David. or Son. But I ain&#39;t your father anymore. We&#39;ve traded places, time to accept that. I think it&#39;s good if we start calling each other the &#39;correct&#39; names and whatnot even at home. It will help us get more accustomed to our new life&#39;s and that will be good for both of us.&quot; Your father replied with a stern tone. You looked over at your mother for backup but she said &quot;I&#39;m with your fathe.... Sorry, I&#39;m with &#39;David&#39; on this one. We talked it over during the day by phone. I think it&#39;s better if we accept reality and I think we&#39;re less likely to slip up Infront of others if we stick with the names associated with the body. So, You&#39;re going to be &#39;Steve&#39; from now on, even at home. My husband. David is our son. I know it sucks.. but, things are what they are right now.&quot; At least she didn&#39;t look happy with the idea.<br />
<br />
But, you felt ambushed. Your parents had agreed upon this without you. Even if you pushed back, they&#39;d just keep calling you &#39;Steve&#39;. Your dad would keep calling you &#39;Dad&#39;. &quot;But mom, dad!&quot; You whined. &quot;Sorry, DAD, no buts. It&#39;s better this way. Trust me. Besides, you should probably start thinking about your body as yours. It really helps me to think this is my body and that I&#39;m David.&quot; Your father said with a smile on his face. He was clearly looking forward to assuming your identity to its fullest. &quot;Well, I&#39;ll be in my room if you need me, mom, dad.&quot; the new &#39;David&#39; said as he left you alone with your &#39;wife&#39;. &quot;Mom, I don&#39;t agree to this one bit&quot; you said. &quot;I&#39;m not your mother anymore. I&#39;m your wife now, remember? Call me honey or Cathy. You&#39;ll get used to it, Steve. Also, we&#39;ll move the bed back together tonight. So people don&#39;t ask questions if they come over. You&#39;re my husband after all, sharing a bed is normal&quot;. your mother... or wife, said, with a sad look on her face. You weren&#39;t sure, but it felt like she had agreed to this to try and accept the twisted reality you now inhabited. You weren&#39;t thrilled about it, but you figured there was no point fighting it. &#39;David&#39; your former-father-now-son had clearly already decided this and he&#39;d been acting out the idea he was David since the experiment. Thinking about the woman next to you not as your mother anymore was going to be hard, but it was only for appearances. You both knew the harsh reality of the situation, so that made it less weird to be calling each other pet names. <br />
<br />
As you went to bed that night you pushed the beds together again. You didn&#39;t feel as angry as before. The anger had been replaced with a feeling more akin to that of being defeated.  &quot;Well, good night, Honey&quot; your now wife whispered. &quot;Yeah... Good night, Hon&quot; you said with your mind elsewhere. Your now son&#39;s word was nagging on your mind. &quot;You should probably start thinking about your body as yours.&quot; on a loop. </p>
