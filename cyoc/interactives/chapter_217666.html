<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Yes, I&#39;ve switched to third person. I want to continue this path but writing in second person drives me nuts. Sorry if that causes a bit of disjointedness for anyone, but I just find it easier.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jack wasn&#39;t happy. Sure, he was glad enough to be out of those sparkly blue shorts which had apparently been &#39;gift wrapping&#39; and into a more ordinary pair of shorts and a tank top borrowed from Zane. While the muscular bunny had clothes big enough they technically fit, both were on the short side showing off more of his legs than he liked, and a good few inches of his abs. Zane was just amused by it and said he might just keep dressing him this way. No, Jack wasn&#39;t happy that out in public he apparently had to be on a leash. At least in the city.<br />
<br />
They had taken a car to get here, he was surprised they even had those since most of the technology here seemed to still be a century in the past. Probably something else they took from the humans. Now they walked down the streets of the city, Zane keeping a firm grip on his leash as Jack walked behind him. Other humans were off leash, and when he asked he was just told they had to pas a training test for a license to be off leash. Jack grumbled. Its not like he had been able to act against orders anyway.<br />
<br />
The other thing he noticed worried him. Some of the humans still looked human, others had changes. He walked by one that was completely human other than having a bull&#39;s head. Another looked more like a satyr though with cat legs instead of goat. He walked by another androgynous human in filmy clothing that made it obvious without completely seeing it that they had both breasts and a cock.<br />
<br />
Zane must have caught him staring. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I wouldn&#39;t do that. I like you being very much male and obviously so.&quot; A furry paw reached out to squeeze on of Jack&#39;s pecs through the thin fabric of his shirt. &quot;Maybe some jewelry for your nipples though. Something with a little sparkle.&quot; Jack couldn&#39;t tell if Zane was joking or not, he had begun to figure out the rabbit had a weird sense of humor. His expression must have been expected because Zane just laughed and led him on to a familiar building. Where he had been sold.<br />
<br />
Walking in, he saw a bunch of the animal people milling about, though Zane went right up to one of the counters, where a doubly familiar lion was standing and writing something in a book. He looked up, looked at Zane, looked at Jack, and grinned. &quot;Well, if it isn&#39;t yesterday&#39;s most expensive auction, what can I do for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m here to look at the modifications available. Jack, go sit over there.&quot; Zane waved to a few chairs sitting off against one wall. Two other humans sat there leashes hanging from pegs on the wall. One was a young woman a few years older than Jack, the other was a man, maybe in his thirties, but with fox ears and a muzzle. &quot;Hang your leash on the peg.&quot; Zane ordered, handing it over. Jack did exactly as ordered and sat down, he could still hear the pair talking though.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s following orders that well already?&quot; The lion seemed surprised.<br />
<br />
Zane nodded. &quot;He&#39;s a good boy. Does just as he&#39;s told.&quot; The rabbit leaned in to whisper, but not softly enough that Jack couldn&#39;t hear and blush at the comment. &quot;He even serviced me without being ordered to.&quot;<br />
<br />
The lion barked a quick laugh. &quot;I let him go way too cheaply then. Well, anyway. The free mods are listed in here. You get two, any more and you have to pay the listed price.&quot; He picked up a thin book and laid it on the counter. &quot;The more expensive ones are in here.&quot; A thicker book landed on the counter. &quot;If you have a particular one in mind..&quot;<br />
<br />
Zane was already flipping though the smaller book. &quot;I do, but I know it&#39;s going to cost me a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we do have payment plans. One and five year monthly payments, what are you looking for?&quot; Zane finally moved to more of a whispered conversation after a look over to Jack. Zane was straining his ears when a gruff voice interrupted his attempted eavesdropping.<br />
<br />
&quot;First time?&quot; Came a gruff voice from next to him.<br />
<br />
Jack looked over to see the fox faced man looking at him. &quot;Uh, yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry. It doesn&#39;t hurt, sometimes it even feels good. I got tail massages from my master for a week when that was growing in.&quot; He said, lifting his hand to rub at his nose. Sure enough, Jack looked to see a fluffy fox tail behind the man. &quot;I know my face looks weird at the moment, I&#39;m just half way right now. My master brought me here for my second dose. Call me Finn.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jack.&quot; He looked back over to Zane, frowning. &quot;I wonder what he&#39;s looking at?&quot;<br />
<br />
Finn shrugged. &quot;No use wondering. You&#39;ll find out soon enough. My advice? Don&#39;t fight it and just go with the flow. You&#39;ll enjoy it more and hate yourself less.&quot; He stopped talking though as an older fox with a greying muzzle and a bit of a pot belly came over and took his leash. He went along happily, tail swishing behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t listen to him.&quot; The unaltered woman said, still staring forward. &quot;Fight it to the end.&quot; She didn&#39;t say any more after that, or even look at him. Jack&#39;s attention was soon pulled away as he heard Zane calling his name.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jack, come here.&quot; Jack stood and started walking, almost forgetting his leash on the peg, before grabbing it to walk over and hand it to Zane who took it before reaching up to pet him on the head. Jack was annoyed by how much that gesture pleased him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here you are.&quot; The lion said, placing three vials on the counter. &quot;And I&#39;ll submit your application for that payment plan for the more expensive one, we&#39;ll let you know if you&#39;re approved, then you can come get it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack looked down at the vials. &quot;Three?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I decided to spend a little on you today, as a birthday present for myself. Drink up.&quot; Zane said, giving his cheek another stroke.<br />
<br />
Jack picked up the vials, uncorking them and downing the contents one by one as the lion spoke. &quot;You&#39;ll notice some changes by tonight, but they&#39;ll take about three or four days to completely finish. You&#39;ll want to massage some of the changing spots, helps wake the nerve endings up.&quot;  The lion laughed softly. &quot;And he&#39;s fine to play with during his changes. Some owners particularly enjoy it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zane just grinned and after a brief farewell tugged on Jack&#39;s leash to get him to follow. The trip home was as uneventful as the trip into town, but Zane rebuffed any effort by Jack to figure out what was going to happen to him and only got a, &quot;You&#39;ll see.&quot;<br />
<br />
Walking back into the farm house, he was hit by the smells of cooking and baking, Sammy was bustling around in the kitchen but popped out when he heard Zane and Jack come in. &quot;So? How is your human?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s great. Do you mind if I spend some more time with him upstairs before dinner?&quot; Zane asked, looking over at a clock on the wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, we have a few hours before your uncle and cousin get here. Have fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack was feeling at the top of his ears. Did they feel.. pointier? Maybe it was just his imagination, though he was dragged out of his thoughts by a tug on his collar. &quot;C&#39;mon, Jack. Stop playing with your ears and come upstairs.&quot;</p>
