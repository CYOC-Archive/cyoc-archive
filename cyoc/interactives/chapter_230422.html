<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You know... I miss being a teenager at your age. Hanging out in the school and the mall, being with friends, getting into trouble with my parents. Ah... those were the days. I would love to relive it. And besides, I would make a great twin sister for you.&quot; said Jamie after some thought.<br />
<br />
Jeff listened to his mother&#39;s favor and decided to give her that feeling. &quot;Okay...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff entered in 16 for Jamie&#39;s new age and a pop-up appeared.<br />
<br />
 &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; asked Jamie.<br />
<br />
 &quot;It&#39;s a message saying that to make you that age the Chronivac will have to edit your relationship with the family and alter reality.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Edit my relationship with the family?&quot; asked Jamie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, from father to twin sister. Maybe this isn&#39;t a good idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fine. I don&#39;t mind being your twin if you don&#39;t mind having one for a little while.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Define little while,&quot; said Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like a week or so. I do need to re-experience high school all over again. I would be so much fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff sighed. &quot;Okay, but just so long as you don&#39;t get too comfortable in the high school life.&quot; joked Jeff as he pulled up Jamie&#39;s profile.<br />
<br />
&quot;No promises there, Jeff, though it might help if you keep my adult memories in tact so I can have some possibility of restraining myself,&quot; suggested Jamie with a rather impish grin.<br />
<br />
Jeff accepted the suggestion and the prompt disappeared and Jeff was allowed to select for Jamie to keep her memories and for reality to alter to make her his twin sister. Jeff also made sure that his memory of this reality would be preserved as well, and then he hit accept.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa...&quot; said Jamie a few seconds after Jeff had hit the accept button.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just felt a warm... pleasurable... pulse through my body... d-damn... there it is again...&quot; said Jamie, grabbing onto the back of Jeff&#39;s chair. Jeff rose and looked at Jamie. For a woman in her late thirties, she wasn&#39;t half bad looking. She was clearly a plumper woman who&#39;d clearly let herself go a few years ago and was now a bit husky in addition to her hulk. However as Jeff stared, his mother&#39;s slight pouch of a belly seemed to be shrinking, and the thickness to his body seemed to slowly be decreasing, like a balloon slowly deflating all at once. The pulses seemed to gain in intensity and were likely waves of youth returning to Jamie. Already, his mom (Jeff estimated) looked closer to her early thirties now than she had a few moments ago. With a third waves of pleasure, gone was the pouch, and the shorts that had been on the tighter side now looked a little loose, if not sliding down a bit. Her shirt seemed to be filled out a bit more, as Jeff&#39;s memories of his younger, thinner, mom from about a decade ago seemed to resonate with the younger woman standing before him.<br />
<br />
However the transformation was far from over, and the waves of pleasure seemed to intensify as she re-entered her twenties and started looking more and more like a young adult rather than a mother of three. Her hair lost any gray hair that she had gained over the years, and any extra body hair was beginning to thin a bit as second puberty undid itself, not leaving her without any hair, but far less than she had had moments ago. Muscles bulged while her body&#39;s thickness thinned out, soon a rather athletic looking young college vixen was standing in Jeff&#39;s room. And it was about now that Jeff found he couldn&#39;t rightly think of the woman standing in front of him as his Mom anymore, but instead was starting to think of him as his older cousin Mikayla.<br />
<br />
&quot;My head&#39;s starting to ache a bit...&quot; complained Jamie as she placed her hands up on her temples.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it&#39;s reality changing... you&#39;re more Jamie to me now than Mom,&quot; said Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right... but I also feel like I&#39;m forgetting things... like col---I mean High School,&quot; said Jamie as her muscles deflated even more dramatically now and she dropped an inch or two as she left her twenties, her breasts perked up back to becoming firm and not drooping. Soon Jeff could only see his sister, not a cousin, but his twin sister, Jamie.<br />
<br />
Jamie&#39;s clothes soon started to make the change as they were altering to match her teenage body. Her white shirt grew dark and looses the buttons while darkening to created a black T-shirt as a Taylor Swift logo appeared on it. Her black best changed texture and became leather with a few patches appearing on it. His dress pants lightened and changed to demin, turning into blue jeans as there was ripping on the knees to make her look cool. And her brown slippers whitened and had extra patches, with laces appearing and tying themselves up, forming a pair of Nike sneakers. On hind sight, Jamie looked like an actual teenager that&#39;s going through a...unique phase.<br />
<br />
Reality was soon altering as everyone, except Jeff and Jamie, would believe that Jamie was Jeff&#39;s twin sister while pictures altered to make everyone think she is an actual twin.<br />
<br />
Once it was all over, the Chronivac ended the process and a new timer appeared claiming that there is a week before the changes are reverted. Jeff looked to his former mother, now twin, and wondered if she is okay.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jamie? Are you okay? How are you feeling?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie looked to her now twin brother and started to smile. &quot;Better then okay, bro. I feel great! I mean look at me. I am officially a teenager! No more stupid job or marriage. Just a kid with a lot of opportunities ahead. And wow! I have so much energy now! I can do whatever I want!&quot; She soon ran around the room and jumped and dance around, happy that she can go through with her teens again.<br />
<br />
Jeff could see that he must&#39;ve been a hands full and try to calm her down. &quot;Okay, okay. Calm down Jamie. I can tell you are excited. But don&#39;t get to crazy. Remember, you have only a week before you are back to normal. Meaning on Saturday, you will be back to being my mom again. Okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie stopped celebrating and agreed with her now brother. &quot;Okay... You really like to ruin the mood for me, Jeff. You know that right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff smirked and nodded, &quot;I know. So... Now that you are a teenager and my twin. What do you want to do to celebrate?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie heard that and gave it some thought. &quot;Hmm... Let&#39;s see...&quot;</p>
