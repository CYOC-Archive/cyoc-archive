<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chase Moreland and Aaron Harris now found themselves sitting back in the Tepes dungeon of the manor. Chase looked like he was thinking while Aaron sat there a little frustrated with his best friend and cousin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Chase, this is certainly another fine mess you got us into. We&#39;re back in our favorite room of Tepes manor, the dungeon. Did you not think maybe we should have gotten disguises? Or maybe consider that they were watching the portal?&quot; Aaron sarcastically asked Chase. Chase now thought back to them sneaking into S.P.E.A.R again earlier to see Tammy.<br />
<br />
****************************************<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, no, no, no. God damn it, a thousand times no. Chase, do you know I almost got caught the last time you tried this bullshit stunt. Lucky for me Aoloa was drunk when she found me. But unfortunately as there&#39;s no one retiring and the portal will probably be watched, I can&#39;t do jack to help you.&quot; Tammy apologized to her cousins. Turning she went back to checking a clipboard she had with her tasks to do as Chase and Aaron followed her.<br />
<br />
&quot;But Tammy, it&#39;s really important to us. It may...it may help us solve a years long feud that&#39;s been going on for years now. Look, I can&#39;t give you the entire details, but there are two...very special girls over there for us. We&#39;ve talked with them, they love us and....we love them.&quot; Chase said trying to pour his heart out as Tammy listened to Chase speak.<br />
<br />
Tammy raised an eyebrow, looking at Aaron now to see if he would say something similar.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s true, these girls are very special to us and we want to do what we think is best for them and make both of them happy. Tammy, this girl, I&#39;ve really connected with her. The more time I&#39;ve spent with her, the more time I&#39;ve been making her happy and more than any other girl I&#39;ve met, I want to make her the happiest.&quot; Aaron explained as Tammy let out a long sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, if shit hits the fan, I can&#39;t promise I can help either of you with this.&quot; Tammy warned them as she guided them to the portal and set it to the vampire realm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks again Tammy, we owe you for this one.&quot; Chase said smiling at Tammy as she waved them off to go. As they went through the portal, Chase and Aaron could hear Tammy shout out &#39;mom&#39;, which meant that her mother must have arrived not long after they went into the portal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, we&#39;ve finally made it back to.....hi there.&quot; Chase said as he and Aaron held up their hands as a blind man with a sword and the woman they had met before were pointing their swords at them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh....hi there, remember us? The potato peelers.&quot; Aaron said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Potato peelers?&quot; The blind swordsman asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ignore him. What are you two doing here? Why did you come through the portal? You&#39;re obviously not S.P.E.A.R. so you better have a good reason for coming here and you better explain yourselves, now.&quot; Hanako demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; Aaron began to say before Chase stopped him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll handle this this time buddy. We....are Princess Andromeda and Princess Nyx&#39;s boyfriends.&quot; Chase said triumphantly while standing. It wasn&#39;t long before Chase and Aaron found themselves chained back in the dungeon.<br />
<br />
****************************************<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe you went the fucking direct route. You never go the direct route.&quot; Aaron said shaking his head. &quot;Especially to one of the Five! Did you not pay attention to ANY of the lessons Caleb taught us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well lying before didn&#39;t really help, did it? Plus that woman knew us....from before.&quot; Chase whispered still seeing Ken, the blind swordsman, guarding the door. As a long time member of the Five, he was one of Wyatt&#39;s elite warriors. Aaron groaned and put his palm on his forehead.<br />
<br />
&quot;I could be back home with my mothers celebrating Thanksgiving, but I came back here with you. Damn it, if this weren&#39;t for Nyx, I&#39;d be a hell of a lot madder at you.&quot; Aaron said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, we&#39;ve found ourselves in worse spots. Like....oh, remember when we turned 18 and Caleb and Connor made us think that there was an illegal operation happening at a succubi strip club?&quot; Chase remembered as Aaron chuckled at that memory.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah. But it was more or less a funny birthday surprise. I can&#39;t believe those succubi women went along with it. Why do they appreciate the Morelands so much again?&quot; Aaron asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I forget exactly how it goes, but it has something to do with ghosts and Ezekiel Kane.&quot; Chase tried to remember. Aaron now looked towards the door and had a thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, do you think your girlfriend&#39;s puppy eye thing would work on him?&quot; Aaron asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do I think that her eye thing would work on a blind guy? No, I definitely don&#39;t think so.&quot; Chase reminded him as Aaron forgot that their jailer was blind.<br />
<br />
They suddenly heard talking at the door and the cell door opened as the woman and blind swordsman came over to the boys.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s go boys, you&#39;re going before Lord Wyatt and Lady Kyra.&quot; Hanako said as she and Ken picked up both Chase and Aaron and made the two walk ahead of them with hand restraints on them.<br />
<br />
Chase and Aaron weren&#39;t exactly sure what to expect when they were led to the throne room, but their imaginations made them think that Wyatt and Kyra would look threatening and cruel, but the two looked much different than they assumed. The boys could definitely see where Andromeda and Nyx got their beauty from as Lady Kyra looked stunning in her regal attire. While the boys looked at Wyatt and the were definitely intimidated by him. He didn&#39;t look as old as they thought, but that didn&#39;t mean they weren&#39;t nervous about speaking in front of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You two come into my home unannounced and claim yourselves to be the boyfriends of my daughters? You&#39;re both either very brave, or very stupid. Just who do either of you think you are to be doing this?&quot; Chase nudged Aaron to go first as he was a little worried of what Wyatt might say.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m....I&#39;m Aaron Harris, your lord and ladyship. I&#39;m the one who&#39;s dating Nyx.&quot; Aaron stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aaron? I&#39;m familiar with that name, are you also a kitsune?&quot; Lady Kyra asked as Aaron nodded and shifted into his kintaro form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sort of,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you were the boy dancing with Nyx at the ball.&quot; Kyra surmised as Aaron nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-Yes, and I have to warn you, my grandfather is Tatsu, so I think it best you both keep me alive.&quot; Aaron warned them.<br />
<br />
&quot;And as his grandchild you should know better than to enter our realm without permission,&quot; Wyatt countered. &quot;Especially with a human.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron shifted nervously as Wyatt and Kyra now spoke privately between them before they addressed the two again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what about you boy? You look awfully familiar to me, and it&#39;s hard for me to forget a face.&quot; Wyatt asked as Chase took in a deep inhale and exhale.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Chase Moreland and I&#39;m in love with and dating your daughter Andromeda.&quot; Chase proclaimed as he and Aaron now watched as Wyatt&#39;s eyes went wide and he practically jumped out of his throne over to Chase and look him in the eye. Internally, Aaron could feel his stomach churn. Judging by Wyatt&#39;s face, mentioning he was a Moreland was a bad idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, now I recognize that face. You have the same stupid brash look in your eye as your brother. Tell me, do either of you know what happened the last time a Moreland came into my home?&quot; Wyatt asked as Chase spoke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Caleb came over here and warned you to leave our family alone because he thought you sent that vampire after my brother Connor.&quot; Chase replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes and I swore on my children that I had nothing to do with it. But that&#39;s not the whole story, did he tell you what else happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He said he left you with your face beaten in on the floor, that&#39;s about it.&quot; Aaron commented as Wyatt continued on.<br />
<br />
&quot;As Caleb was pummeling my face into the ground, my son, Andrew, saw what he was doing and was horrified. He rushed over to his father&#39;s side and used what little muscles he had to hit Caleb calling him a &#39;monster&#39; and a &#39;bad guy&#39;. Well, you both look pretty shocked, I&#39;m sure he did keep that secret from his family.&quot; Wyatt said as Chase and Aaron looked surprised at this revelation.<br />
<br />
&quot;I should kill you. I promised myself that if a Moreland entered my realm again their would be blood. Releasing you is also an impossibility however...&quot; Wyatt began to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;DADDY!&quot; Everyone heard both Andromeda and Nyx call out as they both rushed in wearing their princess attire and were shocked to see both Aaron and Chase there and rushed over to their side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Girls, you both know these boys?&quot; Wyatt asked surprised as was Kyra who stood up and stood next to her husband.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, mother, father. This is Chase Moreland, my boyfriend.&quot; Andromeda said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mother, Daddy, this is Aaron Harris, my....my boyfriend.&quot; Nyx said holding Aaron&#39;s arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Girls, you know I can&#39;t just let either of these boys go free. They&#39;ve not only entered our home without permission, but they&#39;re also part of the Moreland family, and you both know how I feel about the Morelands.&quot; Wyatt reminded them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but...daddy, Chase is different from his brothers. He&#39;s a good man, he&#39;s a kind man.&quot; Andromeda said holding her arm around Chase&#39;s arm.<br />
<br />
Wyatt and Kyra then looked at all four of them and Kyra whispered something into Wyatt&#39;s ears as Wyatt whispered back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, we&#39;ll just see how far you both are willing to go to prove your love for our daughters.&quot; Wyatt said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So....what do we have to do?&quot; Aaron asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Vampire gladiator arena.&quot; Wyatt smirked as Andromeda and Nyx both gasped. &quot;Win and you gain your freedom. Lose...well no outsider ever has, but its not pretty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But...but daddy, that&#39;s meant for some of your strongest vampires!&quot; Andromeda said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daddy, please, reconsider doing this.&quot; Nyx begged.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! It&#39;s either this or the dungeon or death.&quot; Wyatt said as Chase and Aaron both now stepped forward towards Wyatt and Kyra.<br />
<br />
&quot;We accept.&quot; Chase said.<br />
<br />
Wyatt chuckled, a murderous glint in his eye as he glared at the two young men. &quot;I thought you would Moreland,&quot; he growled. &quot;That has always been your families way, but be careful what you wish for. I guarantee after 5 minutes in the arena you will beg for death.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a wave of his arm, the guards now roughly pushed the boys away. Andromeda and Nyx pleading with their father as Aaron and Chase exchanged a stoic glance. If they had any chance at freedom, they would have to fight for it.</p>
