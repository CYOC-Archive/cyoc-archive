<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The blue light had change him. He was pregnant and greatly pregnant but how could he be pregnant and still be a man.<br />
<br />
But at least he was 8 months pregnant and it should be over soon.<br />
<br />
Michael called up his friend Brian. He was pre-med and maybe he could help him out.<br />
<br />
As he waited for Brian to come over he hoisted himself up out of the bed. Throwing his shoulders back and maneuvering that mass to the kitchen. He was hungry. So hungry.<br />
<br />
having been a muscle man he ate a lot but this was different. He was ravenous. He was eating for two now.<br />
<br />
When Brian knocked on the door it took Michael a good couple minutes before he was able to lift himself out of the chair. He waddled to the door and opened it.<br />
<br />
Woa dude you got fat.<br />
<br />
I&#39;m not fat there is something in there. I think I am pregnant.<br />
<br />
You can&#39;t be pregnant. You&#39;re a man.<br />
<br />
Brian began to check him out.<br />
<br />
And he determined that Michael was pregnant. But he wasn&#39;t 8 months pregnant he was 3 months pregnant. And it was 5 babies in there.<br />
<br />
Dude you are going to get huge.<br />
<br />
But how are they going to get out? Michael asked. I need them out now.<br />
<br />
I wouldn&#39;t try that I would let them take their course.<br />
<br />
You aren&#39;t one of those prolifers are you.<br />
<br />
Oh no. But we don&#39;t know what would happen you need to take them to term.<br />
<br />
6 more months? Oh god.<br />
<br />
I would think you would want to know who the father is.<br />
<br />
Father? I&#39;m not gay.<br />
<br />
Well someone put those babies in you.<br />
<br />
Michael thought back three months. He had just gotten here and went to a party that was posted on a street light. It had been an interesting night but the morning he woke up in bed with a man. He had gotten his name and phone number on a napkin but damned if he knew where that was.<br />
<br />
All Michael could remember was that he was a big bear of a man. Not fat but he was fairly beefy, bearded and he remembered some leather.<br />
<br />
He searched around for napkin and a couple months later he ran into it on top of the fridge.<br />
<br />
Now 5 months pregnant he was having issues moving around but he made the call anyway.<br />
<br />
When the knocked came at the door he finally made it to the door and opened it. There stood a muscular man that looked like he was off training having a roundish belly.<br />
<br />
Damn he said looking at Michael in a leering way. I like my boys big.<br />
<br />
Come on in Michael said and he took it as an invitation and put his arms partly around the rotund Michael. Michael trying to push away from him but unable to do so.<br />
<br />
Come sit down I want to tell you something.<br />
<br />
Ok. The two of them sat down on the sofa there was an audible groan from the frame.<br />
<br />
Look this isn&#39;t fat.<br />
<br />
Well it isn&#39;t muscle.<br />
<br />
No no it isn&#39;t that either.<br />
<br />
The muscle man took a gip of some of the love handles and said this is fat.<br />
<br />
Well most of it isn&#39;t fat.<br />
<br />
The man looked confused.<br />
<br />
Look what&#39;s your real name. <br />
<br />
Bruno.<br />
<br />
No I mean your real name.<br />
<br />
Look you want to see my drivers licence. It&#39;s Bruno.<br />
<br />
Damn Michael thought how could this be.<br />
<br />
Do you remember meeting me about 5 months ago?<br />
<br />
No<br />
<br />
Well I would have been a lot skinnier. Actually fairly muscled.<br />
<br />
Na. I only go with fatties. More cushion for the pushin.<br />
<br />
Well we ended up in bed together and you put your name on this napkin and the phone number that is how I got in touch with you. It was a party downtown and I got so drunk and we had sex.<br />
<br />
What are you saying? Your pregnant?<br />
<br />
Michael didn&#39;t say a word and Bruno looked down and put his hand on Michael&#39;s belly.<br />
<br />
Damn.<br />
<br />
They have to be yours. I am not gay I have never had sex with another man in my life.<br />
<br />
Now Michael didn&#39;t realize that Bruno wanted kids and this was perfect for him but he wanted to know they were his.<br />
<br />
How can we do a paternity test on these.<br />
<br />
I don&#39;t know but I have a friend he might be able to help.<br />
<br />
Brian met with the two and the did a test and with a fairly strong certainty they said they were Bruno&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Michael was needing more and more help and he wasn&#39;t able to work so Bruno moved in.<br />
<br />
This made Michael uncomfortable but he needed the help. It made him most uncomfortable when Bruno would come up behind him and press his body into Michael&#39;s and rub his belly and play with his man boobs.<br />
<br />
But Bruno liked Michael getting fatter and he fed that growth eagerly.<br />
<br />
When the babies came Brian was there as midwife because no one would have believed that a man was pregnant.<br />
<br />
Michael had become immobile by that time and even with the babies out of his belly he wasn&#39;t able to get around too fast.<br />
<br />
He had grown to love Bruno he had been very solicitous or maybe it was his hormones racing when he decided to accept Bruno&#39;s offer of marriage.<br />
<br />
He had never had sex with another man before but being pregnant he was very horny and he let Bruno fuck him often and masturbate him since he could no longer find his own penis.<br />
<br />
As his hormones began to level off and he was beginning to feel like he needed to get out of the relationship he found out he was once again pregnant and Bruno was once again ready to be there for Michael.</p>
