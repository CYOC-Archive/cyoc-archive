<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Despite the massive cum geyser Will released earlier in the day, toonification was not really spreading much in Hawaii. This was due to the fact that most of the people that transformed into toons already had partners to have sex with or were transformed into PG toons that were a lot less horny than their R/X rated counterparts. One thing that did change was that Hawaii was now a vacation hotspot for toons. Some beaches became nude friendly and even a local beach bar had transformed into a toon focused strip club. But the biggest change of all was that Hawaii was now the main filming location for Belinda Bunslut’s matchmaking game show “Love Hurts” and it wasn’t just toons that enjoyed watching it.<br />
<br />
In a small neighborhood located in New Jersey, a blonde human adult male named Eric was getting ready to tune in. He locked the door to his room, turned off the lights and made sure that his phone was in incognito mode and his VPN was on before putting in his earbuds and lying down on his bed near his anime figures. Eric was very much what people would call a weeb, and having a toon fetish did not help his case. <br />
<br />
After a few minutes the show started. On stage, sitting in contestant chairs were 4 toons. The first was the only male one, Will Wolf, the only thing he was wearing was a black speedo with a blue colored version of the show’s logo. You didn’t even need to see the bugle forming to know that he was very much excited to be on the show. The other 3 were female from left to right, an orange deer toon, a bright green fox toon and finally, a yellow Hyena toon. All of them also wearing show branded clothing that also did a bad job covering their privates, the only difference was that the show’s logo was pink.<br />
<br />
“And here’s your hostess, Belinda Bunslut!” The announcer cried out as the busty purple rabbit toon came out on stage wearing a gold version of the female contestants outfit. “Hello to all the toons out there watching, and a bigger hello to the humans with secrets.” Belinda said while winking at the camera as the crowd cheers died down. Eric’s face blushed red realizing she was talking about viewers such as him. The bunny then introduced the contests, revealing the ladies names to be Diana Doe, Vickie Vixen and Helen Hyena. “For the new viewers, here are the rules.” The bunny announced while giant tv screens appeared behind the lady contestants. “Our three ladies will enter the TV’s and then present themselves on screen living in their ideal sexual fantasies. When it’s their turn, Will’s going to enter the contestants tv and have a sexual session with them. If the love monitor reads 100% during the session, it means we have a perfect couple and the game’s over. If the meter doesn’t reach 100% after all three women are done with Will. Then the highest percentage will be the winner, and Will’s new partner. So with that said and done, ladies, show the world your kinks!” The 3 female toons entered their respective TV’s and after some static, they reappeared in their dream sex scenarios. <br />
<br />
Diana Doe’s screen featured her locked up in a royal castle lying down on a bed wearing sexual clothing that looked what royalty would wear, and a tiara. She was sexually coo’ing and moaning calling Will her prince and begging her to rescue her from her own lust. On Vickie’s monitor was a giant pie tray filled with whipped cream. The fox toon popped out from inside showing her to be completely naked with splotches of whipped cream conveniently covering her nipples and pussy. Still bathing in the giant cream pie, the vixen leaned on the side of the tray and began to seductively signal Will to come inside. Helen Hyenas was without a doubt the most extreme. She appeared dressed up as a dominatrix holding a whip and several sexual torture devices behind her. “Get in here and whine like the pup you are, Willy.” The hyena commanded. <br />
<br />
“Hold your whip steady Helen.” Belinda responded. “In order to see who goes first, Will has to spin the love wheel!” A large game wheel appeared with 6 spaces on it. 3 large spaces each one featuring the face of the female contestants, and 3 smaller spaces, each one showing an anvil, a lightning bolt and a toon hand. Will took a deep breath as his body expanded to appear muscular and gave the wheel a nice hard spin. Audience cheered in excitement when they saw what space the wheel landed on, the anvil. Several mechanical cartoon arms quickly popped out and grabbed Will by the arms and legs holding him in place. A fifth arm then pulled down his speedo revealing his ginormous toon wolf cock which was immediately clamped down onto a table. “Don’t worry Willy, the hornier you are, the less painful it will be.” Belinda said as the whistling sound of an item falling began to progressively get louder. <br />
<br />
After a few seconds, a large anvil came down and landed right on top of Will’s penis. The wolf toon let out a shriek filled with both pain and pleasure as his cum squeezed out of his cock and blasted right into the audience and the cameras. To Eric’s shock, the toon cum managed to blast right through his phone screen and right into his face, infecting him with the reality warping toon virus. After about a minute of body warping and cartoon drum sounds, what was now in Eric’s place was an adult femboy looking pink mouse toon. “Mmm, Belinda-Chan sure knows how to make them squirt.” He said in response. The reality warping had taken reference to Eric’s personality and double up’d on him being a weeb. His room was now covered with figures of adult toons dressed as slutty magical girls,he was now holding a horny toon body pillow next to him while watching the show and he can now only talk as if he was a character in a Japanese role playing game.<br />
<br />
“Well Will, since you landed on a torture space, you now get to pick which lady you’d like to fuck first instead of spinning again.” Belinda said as Will put his speedo back on and turned to face the toon’s TV’s in excitement. He already knew who to pick.</p>
