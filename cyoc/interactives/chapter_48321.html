<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There in the rainy darkness loomed sinister the Ligonier Estate, an old mansion rumored by some to be haunted by those old man Ligonier lured there with suggestions of riches buried somewhere on the grounds. Lured by greed of easy money, those who went were never heard from again, no bodies found, the authorities could not bring charges, imprisoning the man for what they said he had done. <br />
<br />
Although much of what Casey ever heard was rumors at best, the old mansion remained yet, for someone held the tile to it and kept paying the yearly taxes. <br />
<br />
A begrudging look to his car, motor running, doors locked, and he having a horrible feeling that there were others with the young woman he just sat there and watched as she became changed into being a black cow.<br />
<br />
Standing up, Casey looked back up and down the country road, his short cut he thought would save him time, but seemed to capture him in some weird situation. He could not deny the miracle transformation he had just witnessed, but felt his going to the mansion to try and help or keep someone else from making the mistake done by the cow, was for him as dangerous as it was for any fool going there.<br />
<br />
Slowly he walked through the cold rain, striding along up the curving cobblestone driveway, it leading up to the front porch of the aged civil war era mansion.<br />
<br />
Casey was not yet on the great porch when from the north side of the mansion he heard a blood curdling scream. It was the voice of a man that screamed. Even before Casey could begin to run toward where he heard someone scream, a dark figure staggered from behind the mansion, walking to the driveway where it collapsed to the ground.<br />
<br />
Rushing urgently to give what aid he could, Casey knelt on one knee and rolled the very strong, manly figure to face up, and then see if the man could talk. It was with rolling the manly figure face up that Casey met another person on a fast track to becoming another black furry bovine.<br />
<br />
Bullish was the head, and the ears protruding from the sides of the head, but quite human was his face. Human enough for Casey to pose the question of what happened, he got a similar answer, something about a drawer and a book. Yet the man said more, of his watching Ruth speak a rude remark about her friend there in the room, saying she was as dumb as a black Angus breed of cow. No sooner spoken, the breed stated, and not the friend did change, but Ruth changed, she grabbing at her groin feeling as she grew an udder.<br />
<br />
The man changing to become an Angus bull seemed at his saying that about Ruth changing, it was funny, because he began to laugh. He laughed, and taking ever deeper inhaled breaths he caused his suit coat to tear, shirt to ripe, and his bovine muscular chest to protrude, it bestial and seemingly making him elated with pride. <br />
<br />
The laughing faded to common sounds only a bull can make, as with his elation of self, his face changed, and in just twenty more minutes he sauntered off as a bull looking for his cow friend.<br />
<br />
Casey stood up, and by chance happened to see there in a rainy puddle the man had dropped his wallet. Casey picked up the wallet, checking primarily for I.D. he found there money, hundreds of dollars the bull then had not need to own. Greed took the heart, mind, and soul of Casey, for if this guy had so much money, maybe those who came there to the mansion and fell prey to some similar perverse fate, their need for any money would make Casey all the richer. So like those led there for finding easy money, Casey went forward, retracing the path of the bull-man, he walking through the patio and some French-glass doors.<br />
<br />
Once inside and out of the rain, the mansion had inside it an eerie greenish glow, something like St. El-mos fire that clung to the mast of sailing ship in a storm. Walking from one room to another, trying his best to be as quiet as was possible, the oak plank floor giving off an occasional creaking due to the weight of a man walking.<br />
<br />
A moan, then another, a giggle and then another giggle, a womanly voice, it coming from what was in olden days called a water closet, (Bathroom).<br />
<br />
Casey stepped slowly and coming close to the door, he opened it, and stood then nose to nose with a wildly lovely and lust passionate creature.<br />
<br />
Even in the greenish glow emanating from the damp walls of the mansion, Casey found himself standing before a naked figure. Quite a female figure, as one sleek sexy woman, she naked, but her body covered in a sheen of silky smooth fur. She remained much the womanly of form, her breasts a perfection beyond any ever seen by Casey, other than say in some Playboy movie loaned from his elder brother.<br />
<br />
Taking a step backing away from being so close to her, Casey had then the chance to give her a wary eye, she seemed delighted he was there, as if his coming were for her what she wanted most. Furry of body, sleek and large chest, slim waist, but her thighs, legs, and all below the waist were likened to being a small horse, as is a muscular pony.<br />
<br />
She eyed Casey, here eyes gawking at him, as her tail swished and swayed, the thick coarseness of the tail hairs accentuating the movement of her tail. Acting as if she had in her some thought of him and her getting together for a night of wild wonderment. She plucked with her fingers at the two teats to her pony mare udder. She twisting them, and her tail flicking harsher, she smiling with a very nice looking human face, her other hand reaching to take hold of Casey by his belt buckle.</p>
