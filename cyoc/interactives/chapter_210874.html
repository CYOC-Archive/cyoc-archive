<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He was slowly turning into a dragon, but the scales spreading upon his body were just the beginning. Matt shouted in horror as he saw his skin drastically change in nature. He attempted futilely to rub them off but to no avail. They were anchored firmly and and a full part of his anatomy. The scales traveled down his backside after spreading across his chest and up his shoulders. When the waves of the scaly rash met between his eyes, it was their time to drastically change. His pupils became slit ones and their blue color shifted to yellow. Then his face elongated into a slim muzzle. Matt touched and felt his new face in panicky movements while bulges started to show themselves on his shoulders and backside. You watched on with complete horror. They were similar to monstrous tumors. And when they burst, they let out wings and a tail that lashed out, happy to be free in this new world. You noticed webbing  was spreading on the paws of Matt, as well as on his front legs, snout and spine. Matt was turning into a slender marine dragon, built for speed underwater and skilled at snatching the fastest prey in the seas or large schools of fish. However, the changes did not stop there. Oh, no. Matt uttered a high-pitched cry as he clutched his groin. <br />
&quot;My privates! They&#39;re being absorbed into my me! Help!&quot;<br />
And so it was. You watched on with again a morbid fascination at the testes of your former lover sunk into his own body and his penis did the same.<br />
&quot;They&#39;re inside! Inside! I can feel them moving! Settling! Becoming something else!&quot; he screamed.<br />
He then stared at his groin.<br />
&quot;Gone! They&#39;re gone! Where are you, guys? They&#39;re gone!&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, wait, what&#39;s...&quot; you stare.<br />
Matt saw it too. A sort of hole. A slit. Remarkably similar to yours, as you both thought simultaneously. Matt tentative fondled, inspected and pressed the newfound labia and vagina but it was only to exclaim in horror and terror:<br />
&quot;I have a cunt! A cunt! I&#39;m a girl! I don&#39;t want to be a female! It&#39;s too horrible! It&#39;s too disgusting! A cunt! I don&#39;t want to have a cunt!&quot;<br />
Stung, you&#39;re about to answer that you&#39;re a female right now and he had sex with you, as disgusting as he might think you are when Matt starts shrinking, his features and body becoming rounder. More immature. Quickly, he had become minuscule, covered in a stretchy sort of pouch from which he cannot escape, as he is not strong enough. And his distraught eyes get closed as the pouch hardened into a white and blue shell. An egg. A white and blue egg. That&#39;s what&#39;s left of Matt and the egg... starts rolling. Amazing! Entranced by what it might do next, you look at it . That is why you don’t see it coming at all when in thrusts into you vagina and slowly pushes itself upwards, until it settles itself into your uterus. You&#39;ve got an egg now. An egg in your womb. You&#39;re pregnant. Pregnant! Pregnant with your lover of an hour that is now a female dragon!<br />
&quot;Enjoying motherhood?&quot; says a voice next to you.<br />
You turn around. The witch! She&#39;s there!<br />
&quot;What have you done? Undo it! Now!&quot; you shout out in utter rage.<br />
&quot;Part of the curse. The first man you&#39;d have intercourse with would be changed into a female dragon, then regressed to an egg inside your womb. Did I omit to specify that?&quot;<br />
Her last sentence has her smirking and her twinkling. You shout in complete anger.<br />
&quot;How am I supposed to live? Like this? How do you think it will be even possible?&quot;<br />
&quot;You prefer being a pregnant woman?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes! At least I wouldn&#39;t be a freak!&quot; you say, outraged.<br />
&quot;If you lived among dragons, you wouldn&#39;t be a freak, quite the contrary,&quot; she says calmly and in a professorial manner.<br />
&quot;Dragons? And where do you want me to find other dragons?&quot; you scream.<br />
&quot;Why, in the Draconic Realm, of course. The world where dragons live. Over there, you should fit in, proved you look more dragon-like and less human. But your features are already a good start to be considered a dragon hottie. I can send you there. In fact, let&#39;s!&quot; she exclaims, beaming widely.<br />
&quot;What? No! Please! I want to be human! I prefer being human! I...&quot;<br />
&quot;No, this spell is much more amusing! And I&#39;ll stop pestering you after that one, promise! I&#39;ll cast you into the Draconic Realm. You should lay your baby&#39;s egg in a few weeks and it&#39;ll hatch about a year afterwards. You&#39;ll lose your memories of being human completely after a few moons, just as your former lover has already said goodbye to his. Also, you can raise a decent daughter, not a human male with misogynist ideas. But hey, you human boys want girls fawning over you. With your new body, you&#39;ll have dragon males besotted with you! Be happy about that! You new dragon thoughts and reflexes will kick in fast, rest assured,&quot; she explained as she gathered light and energy into her hands.<br />
She thrust it at you before you could move or escape and you went hurtling through a blur of wind and flashes of light.<br />
<br />
When you woke up, you were lying on hot sand. You checked your lower stomach at once, anxious. So very anxious. You baby. The one left by your dear, dear dead mate, was it all right? Your only reminder of your dearest love. You check your womb anxiously but you feel most relieved. No blood, no cracked pieces of a shell, no internal damages, it seemed. You couldn&#39;t live if anything happened to that egg developing in your womb. The final gift of your mate. His name was... It was... You then shake your head vigorously. No! There is no dearest love or mate! You&#39;re a human and this egg is a guy named Matt who has already lost all notion that he was once human. A guy you had intercourse with because a witch cursed you with an uncontrollable libido! A witch that has changed again you appearance, you realize as you stand in your new natural stance, on all fours. You have a tail and a pair of wings now and your scales have the colour of yellow sand. Actually, you are in a desert, but the and of waves indicate that the sea is very, very near. And indeed it is. You think it is beautiful. You&#39;re not much of a fisher, not at all, even, but you think of the prey the land holds. There are a few rivers nearby. It was your mate that brought you good fish back from the sea. You shake your head again. No! Don’t let those false memories worm themselves into your brain! You drink a bit at a tiny gurgling source of water and find a dry cave in the rocky landscape to rest a bit. You&#39;re very tired. First, a nap, then survival and seeing what should be done. You roll into a ball in the cool freshness of the cave and the sand covering its floor. Sleeping on it is really comfortable and you find you do not need pillows or blankets anymore. It all feels so... natural. You drift off to sleep, unaware that this same sleep makes your new dragon mind more powerful at invading your human side and at erasing it while you are unconscious.</p>
