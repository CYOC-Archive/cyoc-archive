<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Time passed in the cabin. <br />
<br />
James awoke the next morning to a rattle on his door before it slowly began to peer open. In a mild panic he pulled the sheets up over his newly formed breasts. The warm caring face of his mother peaked between the crack, an almost welcome sight after an evening of unsettling dreams. James relaxed his grip on the sheets as she came to rest at the end of his bed, gently running her hand across the young man&#39;s foot before breaking to him the new living arrangements. She stressed that it didn’t bother her, and that he should accept the decision that the two of them had made. Something about them being more biologically compatible, it just made sense. James sat bewildered, his mother&#39;s speech falling on deaf ears as that term rattled around in his mind ‘Biologically Compatible.’ Would that make him and Dakota... Compatible? He blushed at the thought before pushing it away, focusing his attention again on his mother. James nodded that he understood, before Joan spoke once more. “Oh, don’t worry. I didn’t tell them about your latest change. That’s our little secret.” She said with a wink, before standing and taking her leave.<br />
<br />
James sat up in bed, letting the events of the last day sink in. Surprisingly, his parents&#39; de facto separation weighed least on his mind. He had changed a lot overnight, even coming to question everything that he thought he knew about himself. He waited for his mother&#39;s door to close before he relaxed, letting his full guard down only now that he was alone. He pulled his hands up to his chest, tracing his fingers down his new figure. He cupped the side of his breasts, letting out a long sigh as he let them go, feeling the new mass jiggle under their own weight. They felt even bigger than melissas... His exploratory touch continued further down his body, pulling his pants down to free his sizable penis. It’s flared tip protruded from it’s furry sheath, staring up at him as a constant reminder of Dakota. But that wasn’t what he was interested in. His fingers brushed passed his ballsack, slipping down to his taint until he found it. James gasped at the sensation, it felt just like Melissa&#39;s did, those familiar lips. He pushed further, feeling his fingers sink deeper inside before he retracted completely, not wanting to lose himself further. He pulled his pants back up, launching himself off of his bed as he made his way to the window, basking himself in the brisk morning breeze. He stared out at the woods that surrounded them while he began to wonder when he might next see Dakota.<br />
<br />
When James next saw the family they were quick to notice his new changes and he was even quicker to put an end to the discussion. &quot;Yes, I changed. I couldn&#39;t help myself...&quot; He announced with a crimson blush, before turning away and retreating to his room once more. Joan made sure to hide her changes until after James had announced his, not wanting Henry to think they were related.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Jess and Henry adapted quickly to their new lifestyle, the new couple found themselves cradling one another as they awoke. Henry quickly separated the two, both stifling a blush; and early morning arousal. Henry cleared his throat, pulling the blankets up over his chest. “Hm Hmmm, uh, baby steps huh?” he mumbled. The two were quick to rise, dressing themselves and making for the false wall that they had discovered.<br />
<br />
They had managed to find an old hammer, which Henry had wrenced between the wooden frame and the crack. He looked back at Jess and gave her a hopeful shrug, as she nodded back in approval. ‘Go for it’. Henry pulled against the loose wood, and quickly a loud snap echoed down the hall. A large plank snapped off, rattling on the ground before it was accompanied by several large thuds, heavy tomes which Jess quickly gathered up. Henry peered into the crack in the wall, but nothing else was there. <br />
<br />
“Well?” He asked with a hopeful tone, but already he could see the look of confusion growing on Jess’ face.<br />
<br />
“It could be something… Or the ramblings of a madman. It’s not in english, I don’t think it’s in any language. Just shapes and symbols…” She mumbles, holding the book against her breasts while flicking furiously through the pages with the other. With a heavy sigh she closed the book, collecting the other into her hands. Her ears dropped a little as she turned for their Barn, her tail swishing as she spun. Henry quickly closed the gap between them, putting his hand on her shoulder in an effort to cheer her up. “Hey, it’s better than nothing, and if I know you, you’ll have the puzzle solved in no time. You’ve always been my smart little girl.” <br />
<br />
Jess smiled at the touch, straightening her back and holding her chin high. “Yeah! I can do this. We can do this.” She took off again with pace, heading straight to study.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Joan looked over her shoulder as she left the cabin. The sun was long set, and she hadn’t heard a noise in quite some time. Satisfied that the coast was clear, she headed for the forest clearing. James’ words had hung in her mind, his confession about his Donkey friend, the one he moaned about. She had decided that any outside distractions would be bad for James, and therefore bad for her. James was her’s after all, Henry got Jess. It wouldn’t be fair to lose him to a stupid mule. She found herself standing amongst the clearing before long and made one last look back towards the house. Comfortable that she hadn’t been followed she bent her knees, pulling down her pants and underwear, freeing her stubby cock and balls to the cool evening air. “Ahhhh…” She smiled, the evening air on her naked flesh felt relieving, almost a little too comfortable. “Stupid donkey stay away” She muttered. “James is mine!” <br />
<br />
With a full bladder Joan squatted down, letting out a stream of goat piss from her pussy, while some shot from her cock.”Mhmmm” She cooed, taking in the stench as she stopped her torrent, moving further around the glade, marking her scent, her territory and her girl. This would become a new pastime for Joan.</p>
