<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Quyresee certainly knew a lot about these two students.  She explained that they had become Tommy's new Joe <br />
and George.  That is to say, they were the two students that Tommy had taken under his wing and was giving <br />
extra help and guidance to so that they would succeed.  But Tommy knew a lot more about them as people than he <br />
did about Joe and George.  This was mostly due to two reasons.  One, Aaron and Nicole were a couple.  Two, as <br />
a couple, they had a tendency to talk openly about their relationship quite often.  Quyresee insisted that <br />
Tommy never really asked for such information, but they just talked about it.  She believed it was because <br />
they felt comfortable around Tommy, for whatever reason.<br />
<br />
After hearing Quyresee's story about them, I had to admit that they sounded like they'd fit right in with us.  <br />
But I remained a bit skeptical.  &quot;I believe you, of course,&quot; I said to Quyresee.  &quot;I need to hear this from <br />
them.  I don’t want to force something on them.  They have to agree.”<br />
<br />
“I understand,” said Quyresee.  “If I know them, they won’t need a lot of convincing.”<br />
<br />
“OK, let’s see,” I said.  I wished for them to unfreeze.  They regained their ability to move.  We were in <br />
slightly different positions than when I froze them and they noticed this.<br />
<br />
“What just happened?” demanded Nicole.  She looked around the room.  “Is Tommy here or not?  I’m getting a <br />
little mad.”<br />
<br />
“I’ve already told you that I am Tommy,” said Quyresee.  “Or at least I was Tommy.”<br />
<br />
Nicole threw up her arms and said, “Oh, this is just fucking ridiculous.”<br />
<br />
Aaron softly said, “I’m sorry, miss, but that’s impossible.  We have a lab session with him right now, so we’d <br />
really like to know where he is.”<br />
<br />
I looked at Quyresee and she looked back at me.  “You’ll just have to prove it,” I told her.<br />
<br />
Quyresee looked back at Aaron and Nicole and said, “OK, let’s see.  How can I prove this?  What are some <br />
things that you two have told Tommy that you haven’t told anyone else?”  Aaron and Nicole looked at each <br />
other.  Aaron appeared nervous while Nicole just appeared annoyed.  “Well, you two are a couple, but that’s <br />
not really a secret,” she said.<br />
<br />
“Yea, no shit,” snapped Nicole.<br />
<br />
“Yes, but what you’ve never told anyone else, except for Tommy, is the exact nature of your coupling,” <br />
continued Quyresee.  “Nicole, you’re the dominant and forceful one and, Aaron, you’re the weaker and <br />
submissive one.”<br />
<br />
“That, uh, doesn’t mean anything,” said Aaron slowly and nervously.<br />
<br />
“Really?  OK, how about this?” Quyresee continued.  “Aaron, you’re more or less a transvestite.  You wear <br />
women’s clothes in private and you’re probably wearing women’s underwear right now.  Nicole, you strap on a <br />
dildo and fuck Aaron with it as often as he fucks you normally.  Now you both know you’ve said that to Tommy <br />
and he’s not one to talk about others.  Are you telling me that you’ve mentioned those things to other <br />
people?”<br />
<br />
Now Nicole appeared shocked.  Aaron, meanwhile, appeared like he was ready to cry.  “How could you say that…in <br />
front of these other people?” Aaron managed to say.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry,” I said.  “We don’t judge people.  We’re kind of strange ourselves.”<br />
<br />
Nicole, still with a shocked look on her face, said, “So what?  Who the hell are you anyway?”  Her voice was <br />
not as strong as it was previously.  <br />
<br />
“Does that mean you believe I am…or was Tommy?” asked Quyresee.<br />
<br />
“No,” said Nicole defiantly.<br />
<br />
“You?” Quyresee asked Aaron.<br />
<br />
“Maybe,” was all he could muster for an answer.<br />
<br />
“I guess it’s your turn,” Quyresee said to me.<br />
<br />
I shrugged.  “We figured it would come to this,” I said.  “This woman you see was most certainly Tommy.  But I <br />
changed Tommy into this woman.  Because I have the power to do that.  I have the power to do anything I want.  <br />
Since you’re having such a hard time believing us, I will have to demonstrate my power to you.”<br />
<br />
Everything Quyresee said to Aaron and Nicole was what she told me and Myrintha about them while they were <br />
frozen.  She also gave me the idea for how to best demonstrate my power to them.  On her advice, I wished that <br />
they would strip down to their underwear.  As soon as I made the wish they both took off their backpacks and <br />
removed their clothes.  They looked quite confused as they did what I wished.<br />
<br />
Nicole looked at Aaron and asked, “What the hell are you doing?”<br />
<br />
“What are you doing?” he asked right back.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know,” she said as she pulled her shirt over her head.  “I’m not doing this!”<br />
<br />
“Neither am I!” Aaron insisted as he finished unbuttoning his shirt.  “Oh, please stop,” he said, seemingly at <br />
his hands.  He took off his shirt to reveal that he was indeed wearing a lacy red bra.<br />
<br />
Nicole, who wore a turquoise bra that nicely accentuated her large breasts, looked angry when she saw Aaron.  <br />
“You promised me you wouldn’t wear that one anymore!” she shouted.  At this point I decided to wish for the <br />
lab to be soundproof for the rest of the time we occupied it, and for no one else to enter the lab while we <br />
were still here.<br />
<br />
“Shut up!” Aaron said back to her.<br />
<br />
“You are going to get it,” she promised as she unbuttoned her skirt.  She slid her knee-length skirt off her <br />
hips.  I was a little surprised to see that the matching turquoise panties she had on were actually crotch <br />
less.  They had connections down to the stockings she wore, which she also removed.  Once she finished <br />
undressing, she immediately put her hands over her exposed pussy.<br />
<br />
I laughed at her.  “What’s so funny?” she asked.<br />
<br />
“We’re all girls here, except for him, and he’s seen it before, too, right?” I asked her.  She shot me a dirty <br />
look and put her hands on her hips.  By now Aaron removed his pants to show he wore a red thong underneath his <br />
pants.  “So it appears that what my friend Quyresee here told me is true,” I said.  “Care to deny it now?  <br />
Still think what we’re saying isn’t true?”<br />
<br />
Aaron looked like he was ready to cry.  He just shook his head.  Nicole remained fiery.  “So?  What now?  Are <br />
you going to humiliate the two of us?” she demanded.</p>
