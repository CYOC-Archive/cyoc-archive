<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty was sitting in his room when he heard the sound of the front door opening and closing. June was home. It had been a few hours since he&#39;d made Mark 75 pounds heavier. He could hear his foster parents talking downstairs, but the words were muffled. He wished to hear the conversation and could hear them clearly.<br />
&quot;Mark, did you eat the whole time I was gone?&quot; June asked her husband, sounding annoyed.<br />
&quot;No, I just had a big breakfast. I was hungry. Dustin had a big one, too.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, you could have cooked him something and left some for me. I&#39;m starving. I don&#39;t understand why you would eat so much in the first place. It&#39;s not healthy.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, come on. You&#39;re just being mean. It&#39;s not like I&#39;m a fat pig or something.&quot; Mark said, getting defensive.<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t say you were, I just think that you should consider your health and cut back a little bit. All that food will go straight to your waist. And it looks like it&#39;s already happening.&quot; June replied.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll work it off.&quot;<br />
&quot;How are you going to do that, Mark?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, may be I join Ty and Dustin at the gym.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not a bad idea, but the boys work out separately. I can&#39;t imagine Dustin would want to work out with his older brother. It would be too embarassing.&quot;<br />
&quot;What do you mean? I&#39;m sure Dustin wouldn&#39;t mind, besides, they are both into the same sports.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, but Dustin is only 13, and Ty is 17. Dustin is so worried about it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Boys should work together. I&#39;ll have a talk with the boys.&quot;<br />
&quot;Please, Mark, don&#39;t say anything. I&#39;m sure that will only upset Dustin even more.&quot;<br />
Ty thought that it is actually a good idea, he wanted Dustin to workout with him. It is honey to his ears to here Dustin complaining. When Ty was flying in his mind he suddenly heard knocking on the door.<br />
&quot;Ty, it is me. Would you mind if Dustin and I will join you this evening for a gym session? I think that it will help me get in shape and will teach Dustin some life lessons. You will be his mentor and role model.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure dad, it is no problem. I will be happy to have you guys at the gym. Maybe I can show you how to properly workout.&quot; Ty responded with a smile.<br />
&quot;Thank you, son. See you at 7.&quot;<br />
----<br />
At 7 o&#39;clock sharp Ty was ready for the workout session with his father and brother. He decided to take the car with his parents. As they were heading towards the gym he could see how his dad was trying hard to adjust his belt and to sit comfortable in the car. When they entred the gym he saw a huge guy lifting weights.<br />
&quot;Damn, he is huge. Look at him, he is lifting 450 lbs. I want to be like him. He looks so strong and muscular.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ty, you are still young, and you will have many years to be strong and muscular. Just concentrate on getting healthy, not on building a huge body. It will take a lot of time and effort to build a body like that.&quot; Mark responded.<br />
&quot;Dad, are you afraid that you will not be able to keep up with me?&quot;<br />
&quot;What are you talking about, I will have no problems keeping up with you. Let&#39;s just focus on the workout. It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve been to the gym. Show me what you can do.&quot;<br />
Dustin was standing there watching. Ty noticed that the trainer was observing them as well. He was a huge black man.<br />
So, lets change the clothes, put on the gym uniforms and hit the weights. Ty was wearing shorts and tank top, and his father and brother had sweat pants and t-shirts. Ty could see that Mark was having a hard time pulling the pants over his huge butt and belly. He wished Mark a 30 pound weight gain, and a moment later he saw Mark&#39;s belly was getting bigger. His ass was growing in his pants and his legs were expanding. He also wished that for Dustin, making him a small version of Mark.<br />
They started with treadmills. Mark and Dustin were struggling. It was obvious to Ty that they had a hard time keeping up. But the main workout was just about to start. They moved towards the weightlifting area. When Ty was showing how to do squats and deadlifts the trainer came over and started observing him.<br />
&quot;Hey, little guy, let me help you. It looks like you have no idea how to properly lift weights.&quot; said the black trainer. &quot;I&#39;m Darius.&quot;<br />
Ty was emberrrased. He saw that Dustin was grinning. &quot;Ok, let&#39;s do it.&quot; he said.<br />
&quot;First, put the barbell on your back, then slowly squat down and hold the position.&quot;<br />
Ty did what the trainer told him.<br />
&quot;You have very good form. Now, push the barbell up and hold it.<br />
Ty did that.<br />
&quot;No, no, no. You are doing it wrong. Let me show how to do it&quot; said Darius. He also took off his T-shirt, showing his huge muscular arms. <br />
It was enough for Ty. He wished himself to grow a feet and add 100 pounds of pure muscle. Also, he wished to know everything about training, workout and lifting. He felt that his body started to expand. Darius and Mark didn&#39;t notice anything, but Dustin was the only one who was able to see the Ty&#39;s magic, so he was standing with widely opened eyes. His brother slowly grow with every heart bit. His muscles were getting bigger and his legs were spreading his pants apart. His back was expanding. He looked at Dustin and could see how his eyes are glued to Ty&#39;s chest and arms. Ty wished his T-shirt to fell apart, so his meaty juicy pecs, covered with a good thick layer of hair revieled. Ty adjusted his pose because his dick and balls were expanding and pushing his shorts. His balls were swelling and his dick was growing and throbbing, tenting his shorts. His ass cheeks were expanding and pushing the shorts, ripping the material.<br />
Ty was now a foot taller and had a big thick body. His was towering everyone in the gym, including Darius. When the trainer looked at Ty again, his eyes were somewhere on the lower part of Ty&#39;s neck.<br />
&quot;Are you ok, kid? Are you taking some steroids?&quot;<br />
&quot;No, I&#39;m doing nothing, but now I can see what you are saying about the right form. Thanks.&quot;<br />
&quot;Anytime.&quot; Darius responded. He looked a bit confused. He could not believed that 17 years boy can weight 390 lbs of pure muscle, but he just decided to ignore the whole situation and moved towards other people.<br />
Ty was feeling his new body. He approach the weights to lift them, but now it was too easy to his conditions.</p>
