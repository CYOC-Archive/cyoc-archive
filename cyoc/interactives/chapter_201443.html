<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Miles woke up to a familiar sensation as he slowly realized that he was back in his original form. He put his hands up to see a familiar set of hairy tanned thick forearms leading to likewise hairy big hands. Miles glanced at James who was still fast asleep next to him. Lifting himself out of bed. Miles looked down to see his old body below. <br />
<br />
Miles grinned.<br />
<br />
He was back! And now he was able to go back to his life. He felt comfortable back in his old figure. He swayed his large cock playfully, content with its size. The room even appeared to be back to normal, now that he viewed it from his original height.<br />
Putting on his bathrobe, Miles woke up James and had him get dressed before escorting him out. In the rush, James never said anything or objected. <br />
He only obeyed.<br />
Miles watched James drive away and walked back into his house.<br />
Back into his life.<br />
<br />
<br />
It had been a few days since the swapped bodies. And Miles was bored. He had been unable to transfer James after what had occurred and Abby was a bit confused at the choice.<br />
Since his interns never lasted more than a week.<br />
Miles didn&#39;t think she would believe him even if he told the truth. <br />
Besides he felt liked he owed James something for agreeing to swap back with him.<br />
Most of his old interns or most men would have refused.<br />
So as days turned to weeks, Miles felt himself get pent-up as his cock became erect when watching James. <br />
James was a typical intern: An errand boy.<br />
He was a hard worker, clearly better than the other interns he had recently, and didn&#39;t make too many mistakes.<br />
But he only visited Miles to deliver coffee or documents. And every visit never lead to any real conversation.<br />
<br />
Miles felt himself become agitated as he had no sex for weeks. And his business meeting wasn&#39;t any better. According to his directors, an employee were committing fraud and leaking valuable intel. However, due to the size of the company it was impossible to track. Even more so, the employee was using secretive software.<br />
Hard to detect unless spotted on the computer personally.<br />
Miles entered his office annoyed laying on his desk chair letting out an exasperated sigh.<br />
Struck between his companies real problems and his lacking sex life he wished for some sort of answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Coffee sir?&quot; a voice said.<br />
Miles turned to see James delivering his daily coffee. James placed it on his desk before leaving quickly.<br />
In that moment, Miles gained the perfect idea.<br />
He turned to his computer and got to work.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, James heard himself called back to Miles office.<br />
Confused he made his way there. Was he about to be fired? it made sense. The ring swap was a huge liability.<br />
But James had agreed to keep the whole thing a secret not like anyone would belive him.<br />
He entered the office and sat in front of Miles.<br />
Worried about the state of his job and a future problem in supporting his family. James felt sweat trickle down his head.<br />
Miles turned to him and pulled out a legal document.<br />
“Lets try being each other for a week” Miles said leaving James in shock.<br />
<br />
Miles chuckled internally at James expression. &quot;Let me explain. I want to see how the life of an employee is&quot;<br />
James stayed quiet before responding.<br />
“I’m not sure…” James said &quot;if it&#39;s a good idea&quot;. Miles groaned internally. No matter whose body he was in. James was always a submissive bottom deep down. &quot;Listen James, the real reason is I have to find someone an employee committing fraud and to keep it on the down low I want to infiltrate my company as you&quot;<br />
Jame stayed silent.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re perfect! You practically visit the entire office every day. I&#39;ll spot the asshole and we&#39;ll swap back&quot; Miles explained before throwing in he was also going to raise his wage triple. At this James ears perked up. He could use the money.<br />
<br />
Finally after reading the terms, James agreed and signed the document. Miles made sure to store it somewhere secret within his home. <br />
It didn&#39;t hurt to be too careful. <br />
In case James double-crossed him, Miles had plenty funds prepared and access to so he would be able to find a way to get James back. He didnt expect it of course considering the weak will of James but just in case.<br />
Miles heard Phillip letting James enter and after leading him back to the special sex room. Miles placed the ring on his finger before starting to fuck James. Since they would have to swap back, Miles made sure to let James ride his cock. He didn&#39;t want to be placed in any submissive positions again. Although he missed James blowjobs and the rough sex he was accustomed to this worked better in the long term. Besides the weeks without sex make any sexual intercourse feel good to Miles.<br />
After riding his cock for a few minutes James erupted ropes of cum onto his stomach before Miles filled him up. Tired from the sex they both fell asleep.<br />
The next morning they found...</p>
