<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A familiar voice asked &quot;Canade? Are you playing games this early?&quot; at which point Canade stopped slouching, turned off the game, and stood up straight John looked and saw Yumi... who didn&#39;t look a day older and was in a cosplay maid outfit... Yumi sighed and said &quot;Canade, you can&#39;t fool my eyes. I get playing games first thing in the morning is- Oh good morning Jane this is a pleasant- and  you&#39;re not our Jane are you?&quot;<br />
John asked &quot;How di-&quot; <br />
&quot;The way your eyes see the world I guess. A certain amount of uncertainty about everything.&quot; Yumi responded. <br />
Then John asked &quot;so since we&#39;re... in the future... what are you doing here and why are you still young.&quot; John asked. <br />
Yumi said &quot;Simple. Your future self kept me this young and I work as a homeschool teacher and it&#39;s my pleasure helping out Canade... and when you can&#39;t be around I do a few things for her an Merica... have you met her?.. Either way- Wait a momment... your eyes are bloodshot and... CANADE! I may have expected a young Jane to do something like this but you went along with it?!? I expected more from you! You are so mature, you shoud&#39;ve known when to go to bed so you would be rested for our lesson today! Really, young Mavis! Merica may have became a Priestess yesterday, but that doesn&#39;t mean you can just expect to do no work today! I suppose I can be a little lenient since we&#39;re ahead in our lesson plan but still. Today you&#39;ll write a 5 page, single spaced paper on the ethics between Priestesses and humans.&quot; Canade then grabbed her tablet and started on the essay as Yumi went to the blinds and opened them up to let in the sunshine. &quot;Canade, go finish in your room while... one adult and one soon to be adult talk and make breakfast alone.&quot; Canade scampered off, &quot;Great, now shall we have some breakfast and chat?&quot; <br />
John said &quot;I have some questions, but... that seemed a little harsh?&quot;<br />
Yumi sighed and said &quot;She&#39;s a bright girl, but she really has to learn she can&#39;t let sentimentality cloud her judgment that badly.&quot; then Yumi opened the fridge and started getting out ingredients. John tried assisting and was a small help. <br />
John asked &quot;So... why do you teacher Canade and not Merica? Like what&#39;s up with Canade?&quot;<br />
Yumi sliced some onions and said &quot;Merica sometimes asked for tips on learning, but yeah I mostly am here for Canade.  Merica was always smart and independent, but Canade was unlucky with her birth. Mass media knew about Merica and how much of a prodigy she was and when they found out you were pregnant they had high hopes for your second child... and then she was an Albino. Sure it doesn&#39;t actually mean anything, but with the gods involved people wondered if she was blessed or cursed... Eventually though when she was in pre-school and kindergarten it was obvious she was mute. More people thought she was cursed and was shunned. Most of the classmates picking on her. So she refused to go outside and started being home schooled.&quot; <br />
John sighed as she prepared some pancakes and asked &quot;And how did I mess up Merica?&quot; Yumi was contemplating something and John continued &quot;I have met her, and while she seems very capable... there&#39;s something off about her-&quot;<br />
Yumi said &quot;I could only guess what bugs her... maybe though... It&#39;s how you see the world? I could only guess how your future you sees the world, but... it feels like she&#39;s never seeing the now, but what was or will be. It only ever really seems like she&#39;s ever in the present with Canade.&quot;<br />
John thought and then asked &quot;Wait, I can look in the past?&quot; <br />
Yumi said &quot;I&#39;m not-&quot; but John was curious what was going on in her past... Dolly was... What happened to her she should&#39;ve been not too far away. Maybe- And suddenly her vision was thrown back farther and farther in time focused on Dolly.... There was a lot of crying... <br />
&quot;And then even though he was SCREAMING, YELLING IN AGONY.... I...I-I Just did NOTHING! Mom just ran out trying to find him and maybe... maybe if I had bothered at all to check... then maybe if I was out looking as well he&#39;d still be with us!&quot; John was seeing Dolly scream her heart out in a therapist&#39;s office... <br />
&quot;Jane, are you there?&quot; John felt a tap on her shoulder and snapped out of her time peeking and saw Yumi.<br />
&quot;Umm... what happened?&quot; John asked<br />
Yumi looked a little disappointed &quot;You had the same look like you do when you&#39;re... well no here...&quot; <br />
&quot;Yeah... I wasn&#39;t. I could see how I would lean on this... If I learn that time travel thing with this I co-&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;d suggest you stop thinking about doing things like that. You are a Priestess, not a goddess. You make yourself several rules for yourself so you don&#39;t appear like a god. You&#39;ve even explained to me that it&#39;s important that mistakes shouldn&#39;t be undone. Time travel is to get people where they need to be and not to correct mistakes.&quot; <br />
John held up her hands and said &quot;Ok, I&#39;ll limit my time peeping.&quot;<br />
Yumi  sighed while cooking and said &quot;Just be sure to give your children as much love as you can when they come around ok?&quot; <br />
&quot;I&#39;ll try, but... I feel new to this whole female thing. I&#39;m not sure when I&#39;ll even be able to get my head around everything.&quot;<br />
&quot;Must not have been a Priestess for even a year right? Just give it some time.&quot;<br />
&quot;...I hope so. Merica was interesting, but I like Canade. I would hate it if she were to cease to exist.&quot; Breakfast was about finished being cooked and Canade&#39;s bedroom door opened and she ran out holding a stapled report.<br />
Yumi smiled and said &quot;The pancakes are about ready, so right on time.&quot; Yumi set down a plate which had a few pancakes on it &quot;Let&#39;s trade.&quot; and thus Yumi got Canade&#39;s papers and Canade got some sweet fluffy discs of heaven.<br />
John took her own pancakes and eating near Canade &quot;So, what do you want to do today Canade?&quot; <br />
Yui said &quot;Jane, don&#39;t speak with your mouth full! you&#39;ll set a bad example for...&quot; she sighed and then said &quot;It&#39;s just something you shouldn&#39;t do.&quot; John swallowed than apologized. Canade however looked out the door and thought... she got her tablet and started scribbling an idea then deleting it.<br />
She ended up writing and showing &quot;...---... Wait for Merica?&quot; <br />
John said &quot;But who knows how-&quot; The front door was broken down with a swift strong kick as Merica walked through. <br />
Yumi glared and said &quot;Merica! How many times have we been through this. No breaking down doors!&quot; <br />
Meria sighed and said &quot;Just been a bit on edge from that original debut... Besides I already rewound the door from before I knocked it down.&quot; <br />
John continued &quot;Or she can immediately get here.&quot; Although John looked Merica in the eyes and saw that while she didn&#39;t even seem to have a scratch on her body... There was a weariness in her soul. &quot;So Merica, Since I&#39;ll be here for a little while Canade and I were thinking about what we should do. have any ideas?<br />
Merica let out an unenthusiastic &quot;...can&#39;t... I think I have school today? Now that I&#39;m a Priestess I cannot afford to miss a single day of class.&quot; Merica started time manipulating what she was wearing into a school uniform and said &quot;I just came to check on Canade and Yumi... I mean i&#39;d like to do something but... maybe after class?&quot; <br />
Yumi said &quot;Ok, say hi to Ms. Abet for me.&quot; then she went outside by fastforwarding the door broken and then rewinding it fixed. <br />
John said &quot;So... no Merica for awhile. We could just play some games. We did have Lights Live Once Three on pause right? <br />
Yumi was silent for a second but smiled and said &quot;Kids need to be kids. There&#39;s not much for the two of you to do together so go ahead and play.&quot; Yumi left as the mother and child started to get engulfed in the world of video games that not so secretly hate you.</p>
