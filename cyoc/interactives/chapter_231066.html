<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tyronius was amazed at the room they arrived in seconds later. It looked like the world&#39;s coolest and largest nursery houses in a giant room. There were so many fun things divided into different areas, one for playing with a miniature castle like structure, one with a big flat screen tv and couch for movies and video games complete with said items, one had a indoor racetrack with different kinds of pedal bikes, and one even had a kiddie sized swimming pool. And there were toys piled everywhere with the various kinds ranging from toddler to young children, some he recognized from the humans world and other he didn&#39;t, that were new and strange.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa&quot; Tyronius breathed out in awe at the little kids paradise before him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You like it?&quot; Nazara smiled at her hatchling&#39;s reaction, knowing he was clearly impressed.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s incredible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This would have been where you spent your hatchling days had you grown up with us. Then once you matured to adolescence you would have been given the choice to make your own room elsewhere in the palace to create and furnish as you see fit&quot; Nazara explained. &quot;But given your preference to remain young and your reaction just now I believe you&#39;ll enjoy staying here. I think Anacal will be thrilled to share it with you like he wanted to all those years ago. I must admit I&#39;m glad I&#39;m going to experience it as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where is father?&quot; Tyronius asked his desire to meet the other growing stronger with each passing second.<br />
<br />
&quot;Last I check he was taking his afternoon nap. Come let&#39;s go and see if we can wake him&quot; Nazara replied as she carried him to a set of doors separating one room from the rest of the nursery. Passing through them Tyronius felt like he stepped into a planetarium as the large room they just entered had a spherical dome ceiling lit up with starry nighttime constellations. From the center hung a large model of a foreign solar system, with the sun and planets lit up and guessed it also acted like the room lighting. The apparatus also appeared to be emitting the gentle looped tune of &quot;twinkle twinkle little star&quot;. His assumption proved to be true as his mother spoke and clapped her claws, &quot;Lights on.&quot;<br />
<br />
The solar system grew brighter as it illuminated the whole room, turning night to day as the dome&#39;s dark starry sky was replaced with a cloudy blue one. Now that the room was no longer shrouded in darkness Tyronius could now see the solar system for what it really was, a giant spinning mobile hanging an equally large crib. Out of the corner of his eye he noticed other aspects of the room, like the rocking chair, pile of stuffed animals and the changing table with shelves stacked with diapers. That last one reminded Tyronius of the padding taped around his own bottom and that he would be paying a visit to the furniture in the near future. But for the moment his vision was focused on the crib and the figure lying inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ready to meet your father?&quot; Nazara whispered.<br />
<br />
Gulping Tyronius nodded his head while resisting the urge to start sucking his thumb.<br />
<br />
The dragoness then walked over to the side of the crib, allowing her son to look inside. Tyronius&#39;s eyes widened as he beheld a sleeping black scaled baby dragon hatchling splayed out on his back. It had all the same features as he did; a tail, wings, horns, claws and a snout that was nursing on a pacifier. The little one just like him, in nothing but a white disposable diaper that had cute little flame designs on the outside. The only other things in the crib was a couple of plushies, an empty baby bottle, a few pillows and a blanket that was only covering one of the hatchling&#39;s legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s dad!&quot; Tyronius exclaimed loudly only to be hushed by his mother.<br />
<br />
Hearing the loud voice the baby dragon rolled onto his side, instinctively curling up and tucking his arms, legs and tail in close.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep it down. Your father tends to get very cranky if he&#39;s not woken properly, and there&#39;s nothing worse than a cranky dragon god&quot; Nazara warned before reaching down and gently shaking the snoozing hatchling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Time to get up Anacal. There someone very important here to see you&quot; she said softly but loud enough to rouse the other.<br />
<br />
Anacal whined as he slowly woke up, the hatchling pulling himself into a sitting position and rubbing his eyes. &quot;Nazura, wats going on&quot; he lisped due to the pacifier still in his mouth. He then noticed the green scaled diapered hatchling nestled in his wife&#39;s arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s dat? A playmate yoo got for me...he wooks sorta familiar.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He should look familiar&quot; Nazara huffed angrily holding Tyronius up for him to see. &quot;This is our son Tyronius, come back to us after all these years.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anacal&#39;s eyes grew wide as the pacifier fell from his maw allowing the toddler to talk normally. &quot;Tyronius? Is that really you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Becoming excited the hatchling eagerly crawled over and used the bars of the crib to pull himself into a standing position. Looking up at his flesh and blood Anacal&#39;s tail began wagging happily, causing his padding to crinkle.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can believe it&#39;s really you. Welcome home my son&quot; he greeted overcome with excitement and joy. Once the shock wore off did he notice his son&#39;s young age. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on a minute. Why is Tyronius a baby?&quot; Anacal then looked at his wife with suspicion. &quot;You didn&#39;t put him up to this for me did you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would never!&quot; Nazara growled in response. &quot;I&#39;ll have you know Tyronius made himself this younger. It seems your regressive tendencies run in the family and he would much rather return to his hatchling days.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this true Tyronius?&quot; he asked his son in disbelief.<br />
<br />
Tyronius shyly nodded, mustering a few words. &quot;Yes dad...it is. I want to experience  being a baby again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is incredible, not only do I have my son back but he even shares my interests too. I so happy right now I could just...&quot;<br />
<br />
Cutting off mid sentence a weird look crossed the hatchling&#39;s face. Tightening his grip on the bars Anacal lowered himself into a squatting position, his tail hiking up behind him as he grunted. A muffled fart followed along with some crinkling Tyronius watching as the back of the padding pushed out suddenly. Surprised by the fact his baby father just messed his diaper right in front of him he was rendered speechless. His mother however wasn&#39;t and quickly reprimanded her husband for his actions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really dear? Of all the times to poop yourself you do it minutes after meeting your son?&quot;<br />
<br />
Straightening up the hatchling regarded the bulging seat of his filled garment with a grin before answering.  &quot;Sorry dear, I must have gotten a little too excited. And if you think about it that boom-boom technically was supposed to happen during the nap you woke me early from. Anyway since me and Tyronius are so alike I&#39;m sure he doesn&#39;t mind me being in a dirty diaper. Right Tyronius?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyronius responded by...</p>
