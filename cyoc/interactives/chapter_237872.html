<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">First things first, Rachel would like to get dressed in clothes that actually fit her, even if they were giant clothes made for babies. She leaned further into the box, still in awe at how much bigger it was inside; the more she looked at it, the more she was questioning her perception. Reaching for the clothes, she realized they weren&#39;t just folded on top of each other, but were all connected to a metal bar with hangers. She inquisitively grabbed the hooks at the top and moved them, and suddenly all the clothes fell into place on a rack like a clothing store. How big WAS this box? She huffed, turning to look for the other paper that supposedly had instructions on it. She grabbed it and pulled it close, squinting as she realized the print was incredibly small.<br />
&quot;What the- how am I supposed to read this?&quot;<br />
Her question was answered as the sheet shook in her hands. Alarmed, she released her grip and watched as the paper flitted into the air, ripping and reshaping itself. It took on a cartoonish shade, and formed a crude mouth.<br />
&quot;Welcome to your second childhood!&quot; The posh, feminine voice sounded slightly distorted, like an old recording. Rachel raised an eyebrow, memories of a certain wizarding school book series coming to mind.<br />
&quot;Uh, hi?&quot;<br />
&quot;Hello, Rachel. I am your personal guide and interface for your Big Baby Starter kit. If you have questions or requests, simply ask.&quot;<br />
Rachel paused as the cartoonish paper lips smiled down at her; when the note said magic, it really meant actual world bending magic. An uneasy grin spreads across her lips.<br />
&quot;O-okay, cool. I was trying to get an outfit, but it looks like all the clothes are attached to, like, a rack in here? How-&quot;<br />
Without finishing her sentence, something exploded out of the box and wrapped around the room, making Rachel jump with a short *frrt*. Within seconds, Rachel was surrounded by several racks of clothing, all shifting and moving around her like a conveyer belt; it almost looked like she was no longer in her room, and teleported into some rich person&#39;s absurdly large closet. <br />
&quot;Clothing Selection has been activated. Since this is your first time, would you like me to explain the magical properties of the outfits?&quot;<br />
Rachel was still in a static pose from jumping, looking like a scared cat as she scanned the room.<br />
&quot;This is a beginner&#39;s kit?&quot; She whispered to herself as she continued to let out little *frrts* and *braaps*. All around her, she saw outfits of almost every design and style she knew of...if they were made for babies.<br />
&quot;Umm, you said something about magic?&quot; She said, trying and failing to find at least one adult outfit.<br />
&quot;Of course. Clothes are an expression of yourself to the world around you, and as the Baby world is one of perception, so too are the clothes. Each outfit changes how the world perceives you. With your new status as a baby, you have left behind many things, one of which is age. As such, there is no limitation on what age you can present as. Different outfits will make the world treat you like a different age. There are outfits for babies, toddlers, kindergarteners, teenagers, and so on.&quot;<br />
&quot;Huh.&quot; Rachel responded, a little offput by such drastic changes in her understanding of reality, especially to the sound of her farts; she&#39;s going to have trouble making people not grossed out by her constant gas already, why would she also want the world to see her as an actual baby? &quot;Is there anything I can wear that, I don&#39;t know...makes me just appear as myself? Or, uh, the age I used to be?&quot; <br />
&quot;But of course!&quot; The clothes suddenly sped up and stopped on the outfit Rachel saw before, the onesie dress that looked strangely adult.<br />
&quot;There are a few options. For the babies who want to keep playing grown up - and maintain their previous lives - this outfit will completely hide any and all traces of baby magic; any alterations you had before your transition will be hidden, in addition to your diapers and everything you do in them.&quot;<br />
&quot;Wait, really?&quot; Rachel&#39;s eyes widen as she eyes the dress, &quot;So I could use a diaper right in front of someone, and they&#39;d have no clue? Wouldn&#39;t even smell it?&quot;<br />
&quot;That is correct.&quot; <br />
&quot;Holy shit, that&#39;s amazing!&quot; Rachel shouted in excitement, pausing only as a long *PHrRRrrrRrt* ripped through her, &quot;Uh, does it hide my farts too?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
&quot;Kick ass!&quot; She grabbed the dress and held it up to her chest; if that was true, her biggest worries were no longer a problem. Now, she could be a little pants filler without any social consequences. If she wanted, that was. <br />
&quot;You mentioned other options?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; The rack sped up once more, and another unusual outfit hung in front of her. It was a bright pink shirt with a pair of shorttails attached. <br />
&quot;This outfit would alter people&#39;s perception to acknowledge you are a big baby, while interacting as if it were normal.&quot;<br />
Rachel quirked her head, &quot;So...if my mom walks through that door and I&#39;m wearing that, she&#39;ll see I&#39;m fat and in a diaper, but will act like it&#39;s normal?&quot;<br />
&quot;That scenario is possible.&quot;<br />
&quot;So how&#39;s it much different from the dress?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, additional interactions are possible. Adding to your previous scenario, your mother might ask if you need a change or offer to fed you.&quot;<br />
Rachel&#39;s eyes bulge. So not only could she act like a baby without consequence, but everyone else would be in on the act? Treating her like a baby, but still thinking she&#39;s an adult without it seeming weird. Numerous scenarios ran through Rachel&#39;s mind: talking about college applications with her mom while she&#39;s fed from a highchair, seeing a movie with friends who both laugh with her at dirty jokes and cover her eyes during scary parts, a roommate teasing her after messing herself and offering a change, a one-night-stand with a guy who&#39;ll fuck her followed by reading her a bed time story to put her to sleep. Rachel had no idea she wanted to be a baby that badly - just an hour ago she thought she was just into messing herself - but there&#39;s no denying the flush of excitement at the idea. <br />
It also scared her a little; having such a big change might be a little much for her right now, especially given how new this &#39;big baby&#39; business is.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll...keep that in consideration.&quot; Rachel deadpans, &quot;Anything else?&quot;<br />
&quot;There is one.&quot;<br />
Once again, the belt shifts until what looked like a simple white t-shirt.<br />
&quot;The only enchantment on this one is to reshape any clothes you try to put on to match your size. Otherwise, it hides nothing. The world will see you as you are.&quot;<br />
Rachel frowned. While seemingly the worst (and most humiliating) choice, it was also the plan she originally had before finding out magic was involved. While the &#39;baby magic&#39; appeared to be fun and convenient, it was new and unpredictable; in every story Rachel&#39;s read, magic like this always came with a catch. It honestly might be safest to avoid it entirely, and just live her life with what changes she&#39;s already been through. Yeah, it&#39;d be rough at first, but she&#39;s sure down the line her support network will get her through.<br />
&quot;So that&#39;s it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Those are the current options, yes.&quot;<br />
&quot;Good to know. For now, I&#39;ll go with...&quot;</p>
