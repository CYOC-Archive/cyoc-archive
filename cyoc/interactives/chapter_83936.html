<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">   &quot;But before we leave...one more thing to show you, boy.&quot; the blond man said to him, his voice heavy with amusement.<br />
<br />
   The teenage boy (whose name was Franklin Pryce) flicked his eyes at the groveling, simpering &#39;Jambo&#39; who James Jamal had become. It was facinating and more than a little frightening to see his once brilliant class president had been reduced to...this. He wondered how he was going to get away from these psychos, when the blond-haired fellow said &quot;If you thought that was impressive, young man...wait till you see the collars second effect. Now then Jambo...you know what you are, don&#39;t you? You can see the real you in your mind, can&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
   James Jamal (or rather, &#39;Jambo&#39;) bobbed his head submissively, smiling and babbled &quot;Yass, Massa. Jambo know whut he be.&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;Envision that image, Jambo. Remember what I said? That you belong to your Master? That You&#39;re nothing but a monkey? A filthy, horny, dumb animal for your masters amusement?&quot;<br />
<br />
   The black boy shuddered and started to sweat. Frank thought he was having some kind of attack...when he saw that &#39;Jambo&#39; was both shrinking...and growing larger.<br />
<br />
   Muscle thickened the black boys limbs, neck and torso. He grew brawny...impossibly so, yet his body bowed forward and stooped him, giving him a naturally ape-like posture. His features shifted, his nose growing wider and larger...his lips thicker and fuller...ears flared and spread...his brow beetled and grew neanderthalish, and between his legs...his balls swelled and his penis thickened, lengthened like a horse cock. In the end...<br />
<br />
   &quot;Jambo? How do do you feel, Jambo?&quot; asked the blond man with a smile.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Lawsy mercy, Massa...&quot; the ape-like boy bellowed in a voice that held none of James Jamals personality or identity. &quot;...Jambo jus&#39; be&#39;s whut he a&#39;ways wuz, Massa. Jambo be&#39;s Jambo.&quot;<br />
<br />
   That blond man patted the former James Jamal on the head, and &#39;Jambo&#39; groveled and wrung his large, work-hardened hands in delight. He was so happy that his massive cock stiffened and dripped pre-cum on the floor. The blond man laughed and removed the strangely high-tech collar from his thick, bullish neck, replacing it with a sturdy leather collar with a tag that read &#39;Jambo&#39; in large block letters.   <br />
<br />
   &quot;That&#39;s...amazing.&quot; Franklin Pryce said, meaning it...but also wanting to get out of here. He&#39;d recognized the blond man now, from some internet show he&#39;d seen once. He was Alexander Jaeger - a self-described &#39;Neo-Aryan&#39; weirdo who had been the darling of several hate groups until he&#39;d broken ties with them, saying that their posturing was mere &#39;smoke and mirrors&#39;, and that he was working towards a vision for a &#39;new tomorrow&#39;...<br />
<br />
   Or something like that. Honestly, Frank wasn&#39;t too interested in the subject. He&#39;d remembered that Jaeger had come to his fathers office once, trying to borrow money from his father to build...something. <br />
<br />
   The Collar? Was it the collar he&#39;d been talking about. Frank couldn&#39;t remember...<br />
<br />
   (snap)<br />
<br />
   Frank gasped, and reached up. Alaxander Jaegar...had just snapped the collar around his own neck.<br />
<br />
   He tried to remove it, struggling and twisting the latch when Jaegar said &quot;Stop struggling, boy. Stop struggling, calm down...and bend forward.&quot;<br />
<br />
   He stopped, though he tried his best not to. Just like James, he calmed down...though his mind was all screams and begging (had James Jamal fought like this?) he just stopped...and leaned forward.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Jambo, remove Franklins clothes. There&#39;s a good fellow...&quot;<br />
<br />
   Franklin&#39;s eyes bulged in terror and Jambos huge, powerful hands stripped him of his pants, shirt, socks and underwear. All he could do was beg Jaegar &quot;Why? You need money? My dad&#39;s got lots of money! He&#39;ll give you anything you want!&quot;<br />
<br />
   Jaegar smirked and stroked Franks forehead, saying &quot;I don&#39;t need your fathers money. I&#39;ve finished my machine without his help, and now...I&#39;ll punish him for turning me away empty handed. Punish him...through you. Now them...you know what Jambo is, don&#39;t you? You know what he&#39;s become? I know Jambo&#39;s behind you, but...you know what he looks like...thinks like?&quot;<br />
<br />
   Tears of panic were rolling down his cheeks, but Franklin answered &quot;Y-y-yes. I know.&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;Good. Now...Jambo is about to have sex with you, boy. You know that?&quot;<br />
<br />
   He tried to resist, but...he had to answer him. &quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;Does Jambo seem &#39;gay&#39; to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;He&#39;s a very manly brute, isn&#39;t he?&quot;<br />
<br />
   He struggled again, but still answered &quot;Yes. Very manly.&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;So, that must mean...that you have a vagina.&quot;<br />
<br />
   Franklin gasped at that, but suddenly...it was true. He could feel something in both his head AND his loins shifting...warping...and he knew he had a vagina. &quot;Yes.&quot; he said in a quavering voice. Franklin was so embarrassed at having his vagina exposed to Jambo.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Not a vagina so much, as a big, sloppy pussy, right? With thick, dark lips and a smell of wet fish.&quot;<br />
<br />
   Franklin tried to fight it, but the truth was obvious. He had a pussy. It was wide and gaping from years (wait...years?) of use, and he could smell the fishy scent of his own over-active juices. He shuddered in shame and disgust as the juices trickled down his inner thighs.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Yes, my dear...a big, sloppy pussy...but spread those legs wider...wider...show Jambo that you like him...like him so very much...&quot;<br />
<br />
   Franklin&#39;s heart skipped a beat, as he imagined the hulking, apeish &#39;Jambo&#39; looking at his big, sloppy pussy. He moaned with desire as a heat built-up between his legs...a heat that only Jambo could cool...<br />
<br />
   Inside...he was screaming in rage and shame...but outside, he shook his pert buttocks and waited for Jambo to mount him.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Do you want to fuck Franklin, Jambo?&quot;<br />
<br />
   The answer of &quot;No suh, Massa suh.&quot; both crushed and soothed Franklin Pryce. Part of him wanted to run as far as he could, but another part of him...wanted to beg Jambo to take him...to make him his.<br />
<br />
   &quot;And why not, Jambo?&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;Cause he gots a nice pussy, but he be&#39;s a white boy, Massa. Jambo knows his place, Massa.&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;And just what sort of woman would you like to have, Jambo? Picture her in your tiny, stupid mind. What sort of woman would you want to fuck? Picture her, Jambo. Isn&#39;t that dream woman a lot like you? Just a big, stupid, horny animal?&quot;<br />
<br />
   Franklin Pryce could feel it...as his skin darkened and darkened...his limbs grew thicker and more muscled...breasts formed and swelled like udders...then drooped down and flopped against his stomach...shot glass-sized nipples aching...he could feel his face shifting, and in the reflective surface of a mirror...he saw his Caucasian features inflating and spreading...his lips so thick that he could hardly form intelligible words anymore. His hair grew woolly, nappy and black.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Yes, Jambo. That&#39;s closer to what you want...but she should be larger...thicker...fatter, if you will. Built like a barrel...thicker legs...a bigger butt and fuller belly...no, fuller, Jambo...heavier upper-arms...yes, just like that. A nice, big, fat Aunt Jemimah Mammy is what you want to mate with. A little bigger than that, Jambo. Just...like...that...<br />
<br />
   (some time later)<br />
<br />
   &quot;Jambo. Mammy Frankee. Attend to our guests, will you?&quot;<br />
<br />
   I rose from my wifely duties, the taste of my wonderful Jambos spunk fresh in my mouth. Though we were just animals, Master (or &#39;Massa&#39; as I said it aloud) had given Jambo and I clothes. For him, a suit like an old-timey butler out of &#39;Gone with the Wind&#39;, and for me...a big, black dress with white lace at the neck and cuffs and a lacey white apron, to match the lace cap. I waddled along, happy to please...yet always with some doubts. I knew I was just big, fat, buffoonish &#39;Mammy Frankee&#39;, and that &#39;massa&#39; had mated me with Jambo...but I also knew I wasn&#39;t this woman. I was...someone else.<br />
<br />
   Who?<br />
<br />
   No time to worry about that. Jambo and I stopped and simpered before &#39;Massa&#39; Jaegar, happy to serve...but...who were these other men? Several white men stood around, watching Jambo and me with amused interest, and massa told them something about a device that he&#39;d invented...and I noticed that one of the men...was my...father?<br />
<br />
   Could that be true? I knew he was my father. Knew it deep inside my soul. But I also that as big, fat Mammy Frankee...it wasn&#39;t possible. It simply wasn&#39;t possible. I was a Mammy. A servile, simpering animal. A simple brute who was kept as a pet and who worked for Massa.<br />
<br />
   But...some how...<br />
<br />
   The man who I knew was my father suddenly blurted out &quot;Yes, your invention is fascinating, Mister Jaegar...but what about my son? You said you knew where he was. He&#39;s been missing for weeks!&quot;<br />
<br />
   Weeks? Had it been weeks? I could hardly remember...</p>
