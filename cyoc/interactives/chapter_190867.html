<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff had his face shoved into the nasty, yellowed fabric of Skunky&#39;s smelly white briefs. The nasty janitors impressive cock was rapidly swelling in the sweaty gross pouch. Jeff moaned as he sniffed in each lungful of rank, unwashed crotch musk. It was so nasty that he wanted to throw up, but it was also one of the most heavenly scents he had ever smelled, and it was turning him on immensely. Jeff&#39;s newly grown jock member was rock hard, an 11 inch steel pole sticking out from his twisted hairy bush. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hehehe, look at you&quot;, Skunky says, looking at the degraded, musk obsessed jock. &quot;You are pathetic, begging to sniff and lick the grime off another man&#39;s body... Here how about this!&quot;. With that, Skunky lifts up an arm and displays his big thatch of brown armpit hair, glistening with sweat. Jeff gulped as he saw it, his mouth watering and his cock leaking more precum and obscenely tenting his jockstrap. Jeff felt drawn to it like a magnet, and within seconds, he had his face shoved into the bush, sniffing and huffing and licking. &quot;Oh, fuuuck....&quot; he moaned into Skunky&#39;s pit. &quot;Oh, it smells so bad&quot;. Jeff had already licked and sniffed a half dozen different footballer pits today, all of them had reeked, but Skunky was by far the worst. It made his eyes water, and his dick hard as a steel pipe, even if Jeff did want to gag and throw up.<br />
<br />
&quot;What a loser you are. You actually thought you could escape? Look at you know, licking up my dirty armpit. Face it Jeff, Simon got you! All you now are is a locker room cum dumpster, here to serve and lick up and clean Simon and his friends, and occasionally me hehe&quot;, Skunky said. Jeff continued sniffing and licking the dirty armpit as he began to cry at his cruel fate. Unable to stop, Jeff&#39;s massive jock cock was throbbing, practically begging for attention!<br />
<br />
Suddenly, skunky pulled away. Jeff saw the armpit he had just been huffing pull away from his face. He practically whimpered, he wanted that pit back, he needed it. Skunky saw the desperation in Jeff&#39;s eyes and just laughed at him. Skunky was still chuckling as he pulled down his pants, letting his fat member flop out into the open. Jeff saw the cock right in front of him was glistening with sweat, and it was hanging mere inches from his face. Within mere moments, the wave of crotch stink rose from the cock and assaulted Jeff&#39;s nostrils. He gagged at the powerful odor of ball sweat and crotch musk. It was so gross, but his dick thought differently. He should be disgusted by the smell, and part of him is! But another, much stronger part, thinks the smell is truly divine, and one of the sexiest things he had ever smelled. <br />
<br />
Jeff whimpered and began to cry as he opened his mouth and took Skunkys rancid member into his mouth. Jeff couldn&#39;t help himself, and he was mortified and disgusted! The thick cock in his mouth tasted absolutely awful, it was salty and dirty, and likely hadn&#39;t been washed in ages. Despite this fact, Jeff began sucking with all the effort he could muster. Jeff was also licking and sniffing the fat hairy ball sac that hung below, too. <br />
<br />
Skunky grabbed the back of Jeff&#39;s head and began to roughly face fuck him. &quot;Mmm yeah, that&#39;s it you pig, take that nasty cock of mine!&quot;. Jeff wanted to scream, to run away, anything but this! But, Jeff knew, there was so getting away from this! <br />
<br />
Skunky began to increase the speed and force of his thrusts, practically choking Jeff. Skunky began to moan and sweat heavily, making Skunkys BO even worse. Within a few minutes, Skunky moaned loudly and closed his eyes. Jeff felt the janitors balls pull up towards his body and Jeff braced himself. Skunky shot rope after rope of rancid semen in Jeff&#39;s mouth. It tasted just awful! Skunky pulled his cock out and aimed the rest of the loads at Jeff&#39;s face and body. A sticky rope got caught in Jeff&#39;s beard, across his forehead and hair, and another patch got caught in his chest hair. After the orgasm was done, Skunky took a step back. He looked down at Jeff, humiliated, covered in cum and sweat, obviously horrified by the whole experience. Skunky began to laugh at Jeff; &quot;Fucking pathetic. Better get used to this, kid, this is your life now. Just a useless locker room cum dumpster&quot;. Jeff was on the verge of tears, absolutely disgusted with himself; but, at the same time, he found his eyes wandering to Skunkys crotch, his armpits. Jeff didn&#39;t want to admit it, but he wanted more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take a rest, pig, you&#39;ve got a good 10 or 15 minutes before the lacrosse team is done with practice. And I got a feeling they are going to be pretty pent up!&quot;, Skunky said with a malicious chuckle as he left Jeff behind in the locker room, lying In a pile of dirty clothes. <br />
<br />
&quot;The whole lacrosse team?&quot;, Jeff thought with panic! He began to openly cry as he picked up a dirty jockstrap from next to him, unable to stop himself. He began to take deep sniffs from it. The unwashed ball scent comforted Jeff as he began to think of a way out of this horrible situation.</p>
