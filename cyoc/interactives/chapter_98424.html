<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Declan walked into the changing rooms at Forever 21, into the stall, and closed the door. Declan realized that he forgot buy makeup to change his face, but then thought his face feminine enough to pass for now. He had also been growing out his brown wavy hair as an outlet for not buying a wig.<br />
<br />
He reached into the Victoria&#39;s secret bag and pulled out the pair of lace, black and pink panties and placed them on the hook. He undressed completely, reached into reached into his pants pocket, and pulled out the amulet. He slipped the necklace over his head wear it rested in the middle of his chest. Declan then pulled the panties up his legs and to his crotch and semi-erect penis. He took a deep breath and waited. After a few seconds, he felt a slight burning sensation and looked down. The bulge in his panties then shrank as he felt his penis retract into his body. Declan moaned in one part pleasure and one part pain. <br />
<br />
After the sensation stopped, Declan slowly pulled down his new panties whilst looking into the changing room mirror and gawked at his newly formed vagina. He touched the outer edge of his new pussy and quivered with pleasure. He quickly pulled up the panties and decided to move on with his transformation.<br />
<br />
Declan took a deep breath and tried to contain his excitement. He had been dreaming of this for such a long time. He exhaled deeply and continued. He pulled the matching bra out of the bag. He had put on his older, 18 year old sister&#39;s bra all the time when she was out of the house, so he was well experienced. He hooked the back of the bra on the front of his chest and began to twist it to his back. He then pulled both straps onto his shoulders and looked down at the empty cups. Noticing the pads at the bottom of the cups he realized that he had inadvertently bought a push-up bra, which he wasn&#39;t too worried about; he was rather glad, actually. Quickly after this realization, he felt a sharp pain in his chest causing him to collapse to the floor on his hands and knees. He started hyperventilating and with each inhale, his cup size grew very slightly. This continued for a few seconds before Declan felt his new assets touch the inside of the bra. <br />
<br />
Breathing heavily, Declan struggled to stand up as if he was recovering from dehydration. He turned to look in the mirror and gasped at the new form of his chest and as he did his boobs bounced. &quot;My...god...&quot; he whispered to himself, &quot;i can&#39;t believe this!&quot; he shouted with extreme giddiness. He poked his D-cup breast and investigated his booming cleavage. &quot;This is so amazing,&quot; he said, now with no regard for what other&#39;s in the neighboring stalls would think. He started to jump  to watch his boobs bounce up and down and he laughed as they did. He held the medallion up to his face, &quot;You actually work,&quot; he loudly wispered. He then kissed the amulet in excitement. <br />
<br />
After thoroughly enjoying his new breasts, Declan looked in the mirror and realized that all of his body except for his chest and genitals were still male. In a rush to change this, he quickly reached inside the Forever 21 bag and pulled out the top he&#39;d just bought. He pulled his head head through the shirt and poked both of his arms through it next. He then struggled slightly to pull the shirt over the new mounds on his chest. After pulling the shirt down, His entire torso tingled as his arm hair and whatever chest hair he had fell off. His hands then shrank and became petit as his nails grew out leaving him with feminine arms. His waist then shrunk in circumference which began to give Declan a girlish figure. He checked in the mirror to see his feminized upper body and he looked at his now womanly hands. He then admired how the top showed abundant cleavage as well as his midriff.<br />
<br />
Declan continued to pull out the denim, high-waisted hot pants he bought and smiled at them with excitement. He slipped one leg through the bottom and as the leg passed through, all the hair on it fell off and the other leg followed suit. As he pulled the pants up his legs, his thighs began to thicken becoming curvaceous. Once pulled the pants all the way up his legs, his hips began to widen which gave him a perfect hourglass figure. Once Declan buttoned the pants, he collapsed again in pain in the same position as before&quot; on his hands and knees. He began to hiss in pain. He yelled in pain and his back arched. His butt then exploded to form a beautiful, shapely ass. <br />
<br />
Declan stood and turned around in the mirror to look at his new ass. &quot;Wow...&quot; he said in amazement. He slapped his ass and it jiggled. He giggled slightly. He, finally, pulled the heels out his bag and slipped them on. They were easy to put on after the hot pants had changed his feet. The heels perfectly commented Declan&#39;s new feminine legs and round butt. The amulet started to glow a green, fluorescent light. As Declan reached toward it, the medallion flew to his throat. He couldn&#39;t breathe. He struggled to take off the medallion, but it would not move. After a few seconds, the medallion let go and placed itself back on his chest, right above his boobs. &quot;What the fuck was tha-&quot; Declan covered his mouth after he spoke. His voice had become softer and higher- that of a woman&#39;s. He smiled and wanted to test some words with his new voice. &quot;Fuck...dick...pussy,&quot; he giggled at the purposeful vulgarity of his test words. He smiled at his reflection in the mirror and continued.<br />
<br />
Declan stuffed all of his male clothes into the Forever 21 bag and went to exit the changing room. He put his hand on the door, but hesitated to open it. This would be the first time stepping out into the world as this woman had become. He, rather she, needed a name. Declan chose Lillinana, or Lilly for short, as it was the name he&#39;d given his female persona online. Declan (now Lilliana) unlocked the changing room door and entered the store. Most of the people in the store had rushed out at the sound of your painful screams of transformation. A woman that worked there approached you, &quot;S-...Miss?. Are you alright? We heard screams coming from your stall.&quot; Declan rushed to come up with something, &quot;Umm ya, it was...epilepsy. I&#39;m fine now though&quot;. &quot;Oh, okay, are you sure? I could call an ambulance,&quot; the woman responded. &quot;No no, really, it&#39;s fine...i&#39;m fine, now,&quot; Declan rushed out of the store to avoid further questioning and he couldn&#39;t help but notice that his hips swayed when he walked- a feature that he loved.<br />
<br />
Declan, or Lilly, was faced with a decision to either feminize her face more than it already was with a makeover or just walk around getting some attention.</p>
