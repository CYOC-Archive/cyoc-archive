<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Go talk to Allan and he will help you,” said Victoria.  “I will be there in a minute.”<br />
<br />
I happily skipped back over to the computer things where Allan and Julie still stood.  “Bambi Buxom, huh?” said Julie.<br />
<br />
“Don’t you like it?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“I think it fits,” she said.  “If you like it, that’s all that matters.”<br />
<br />
I gave here a quick kiss on the cheek.  “Thanks, love,” I said.  She appeared startled at me having done that.  “Sorry, I’m just expressive, I s’pose.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry about it,” said Julie with a laugh.<br />
<br />
“OK, Bambi,” said Allan.  “While you and Victoria figured out your name, I was coming up with some costume ideas.  Now there is an issue with any costume we pick out for you.  Your power are very specific and…well, frankly, a problem for most costumes.  In order for your powers to work effectively, those parts of you can’t really be covered.”<br />
<br />
I think I knew what he meant.  “You mean me titties and me bum?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Exactly,” he said.  “If we covered them with a costume, it could restrict their ability to work…like they should…for your powers, I mean.”  I thought it was cute that he kept tripping over his words.  ‘But I don’t think we can let you run around naked, either.”<br />
<br />
“Oy, that’s a toughie,” I said.  I thought going naked might actually be fun, but I saw his point.  “Gonna have to be a bit skimpy, right?”<br />
<br />
“Yes,” he said.  “I have a few things we can try.”  He turned around.  He had a pile of what looked like clothes one of the computer things and he seemed to be sorting through them.  He turned ‘round to me again and said, “Here, try this.”  He had a real worried look on his face.  I think that was because he held out what looked like a very tiny thong.<br />
<br />
“Oh, what the ‘ell?” I said.  I took them from him.  I stepped into the thong and slid it up me legs.  They fit nice and snug.  Me bum cheeks were left pretty much exposed.  “Feels alright,” I said.<br />
<br />
“Now let’s test it,” said Allan.  He picked up the gun again and pointed it far to me left.  I didn’t have a chance to see if anyone was behind me as he fired it pretty much right away.  Me left cheek did its job as it threw itself out there and blocked the bullet.  Then he pointed the gun far to me right and fired again.  This time me right cheek got to do its job and blocked the bullet.  I turned around and was relieved to see he wasn’t firing at anything in particular.  “Sorry,” he said.  “I needed the instinct reaction again.  But as you saw, no one was in danger.  How did it feel…what with the…thing and all?”<br />
<br />
“I didn’t feel a thing,” I said.  “The part that’s between ‘em didn’t get jostled at all.”<br />
<br />
Julie chuckled at that line.  Allan asked, “But did you feel OK with them?”<br />
<br />
“Yea, let’s go for these,” I said.  “I just hope we don’t have to go nowhere that’s cold.”<br />
<br />
“We go where we are needed, no questions asked,” I heard a stern, strong, male voice say from behind me.  I twirled ‘round to see Commander Victory walk up to me.  “Is that a problem, Miss Buxom?”<br />
<br />
I couldn’t help but giggle.  He did not look amused.  “Sorry there, Commander.  No, that isn’t a problem,” I said.<br />
<br />
“Very good,” he said.  “We have non time for buffoonery in the critical moment.”  That took the smile off me face.  Already I didn’t much like him.<br />
<br />
Allan got me focus back on him.  “Now your upper body is a bit more complicated,” he said.  “Anything that would wrap around your back or your neck in any way would be restrictive.  So would any one garment that would cover both of your breasts.  Therefore, this is our best option.”  A small, metal can with a top like a squirt gun appeared in his hand.  “This may tickle or it may feel cold.”  He walked up to me and pulled the trigger on the squirt gun looking thing.  I did feel a cold, wet tickle on me titties.  I looked to see that Allan was covering me up in some kind of paint.  He kept going back and forth over me titties until they were completely covered.  The paint was so thick that it really didn’t look like I was topless.  “There.  Let’s test it,” he said.  This time we tested me titties and it worked like a charm.  They did their job to block the bullets.  The paint stayed on them, kept them covered totally, and didn’t crack or anything.  I didn’t feel restricted at all, either.  “I think we’ve got a solution,” said Allan.<br />
<br />
“Maybe,” I said.  “I think I got a better idea.”  I remembered I could wish for things meself with me own ring, so I wished for a pair of high-heeled, knee-high boots.  They appeared, but I didn’t like that they came out bright red.  I wished for them to be white.  I put them on and zipped them up.  Once they were secure, I took off the thong.  “I got an idea, I said,” I assured Allan when he looked confused.  Then I wished for me body to be covered in the paint Allan just sprayed on me.  Only I wished for the paint to go from the top of me boots to just above the top of me bum in the back, and to go from the top of the boots to just over the top of me titties in the front.  I wished for the paint to be thick enough so it wouldn’t look like I was naked, but light enough so that it couldn’t restrict me from moving as I would need to.  I also wished that none of the paint could…well, ya know…get inside me.  Lastly I wished for the paint to be white match me boots.<br />
<br />
A second later and I was covered just the way I wanted to be.  Me back, me shoulders and me arms were bare, but the rest of me above me boots was glistening white.  “Whatcha think?” I asked as I twirled around.<br />
<br />
“Very bright and shiny,” said Julie.  “Almost like you’re wearing a strapless, backless dress.”<br />
<br />
“Well, maybe I’ll change the colors up or something,” I said.<br />
<br />
“As long as you can do your job that way, I have no objections,” said Commander Victory.<br />
<br />
“Uh…wow,” said Allan.<br />
<br />
“Kitty got your tongue?” I teased him.<br />
<br />
He shook his head.  “OK, now that you are ‘costumed,’ so to speak, there’s another wish you need to make,” he said.<br />
<br />
I listened to instructions and said, “I wish that this will be my permanent costume as a member of P.H.A.N.T.O.M. and that whenever Joe transforms into me, this is the costume that I will wear.”<br />
<br />
“Very good,” said Commander Victory.  “Let us reconvene at the table.”  I almost felt like making fun of the way he walked, since it was that stiff, macho, army-man style, but something told me that wasn’t a good idea.  He’d probably know I was doing it even if he wasn’t looking at me.<br />
<br />
The rest of us followed him.  Bradley looked like he was asleep at the table.  He noticed me, however, and said, “Are you trying to blind people?”<br />
<br />
“Only you,” I said.<br />
<br />
“Enough chatter,” said Commander Victory.  “Further business awaits us.  Miss Buxom, you know me, you know Victoria, and you know these three members.  Now you need to meet their alter-egos.”  He turned to the other three.  “Which one of you shall go first?”<br />
<br />
Julie stood up and said, “I’ll go first.  I think it’s a good idea right now.”</p>
