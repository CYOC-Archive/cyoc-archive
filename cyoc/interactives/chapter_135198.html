<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So... coming out into the open is something you&#39;ve always wanted?&quot; Amy asked to Tad as they left Moon Lake&#39;s City Hall building.<br />
<br />
&quot;In a way... yeah,&quot; Tad answered softly, &quot;the world outside Moon Lake... it&#39;s not really that bad. Sure there can be plenty of things that look scary and so forth... between how partisan some politicians can be and how petty they can be, but at the same time, they aren&#39;t all bad. In this, just because there are bad things doesn&#39;t expressly mean everyone or everything is bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy slowly nodded as they walked along. Tad made sense there. Moon Lake had long feared exposure, but in most conversations with her parents on that issue, much of the reasoning ended up playing to stories of old were hunts the fact that werewolf movies rarely made the werewolf the hero, and the ones that did generally made the werewolf to be more comedic than anything else. The movies that made the &quot;werewolf&quot; the hero of the film and were more &quot;serious&quot; generally tended to go out of their way to make the hero&#39;s problem to solve being &quot;curing&quot; himself or herself of the curse. Some of the stories weren&#39;t too bad with regard to their plot points, but to those in Moon Lake, who&#39;d long known that werewolves were the monsters of legend or cinema, that sort of thing fell flat.<br />
<br />
&quot;And seeing Moon Lake... meeting you... it&#39;s shown me a world that is quite nice,&quot; Tad commented, &quot;where I don&#39;t have to hide who I am and even the normals living in Moon Lake are welcoming and friendly to weres. It would be nice if that sort of thing could go around the world... not just Moon Lake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be nice... but it probably won&#39;t be easy,&quot; Amy commented, &quot;even if things go well, they won&#39;t be easy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A lot of things in life probably aren&#39;t,&quot; Tad commented, &quot;it&#39;d be like that assignment we got for government after Lionel Ulysses was arrested... the one about what to do if weres were exposed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re always full of surprises, Tad Decker,&quot; Amy gave a small chuckle as they walked along, &quot;so... what&#39;s the dinner plan? We can get some pizza while we&#39;re in the general area of Moon Lake&#39;s downtown, my dad has some leftovers that he&#39;s been saving, but he won&#39;t mind if we eat them. Or we could always catch something to eat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tad got the sense that she was referring to hunting there. It was another thing that made Moon Lake so different in that it seemed like people were raising deer like they were ranch animals in Moon Lake and would release them to suit predatory were&#39;s hunting needs and keep the state&#39;s scientists thinking that the deer population was stable. And it probably was, even without the added management that Amy had told Tad about, but then he wasn&#39;t all that great with science, or at least with regard to the sciences that directly related to the study of animals. Though, for the moment, he wasn&#39;t entirely opposed to the idea. It was something that worked for Moon Lake and hunting would mean seeing Amy in her white furred werewolf form. He found her beautiful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe do a little of the last two,&quot; Tad offered as they crossed the street to head back toward where the Howlers lived, &quot;get a little to eat from the leftovers while waiting for the sun to go down and then go out for a bite.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy glanced over to see him smile to her. It only made her smile as there was some implication as to what else he wanted, which wasn&#39;t that bad an idea. It was a Friday night, neither of them had to be up early the next day and the night was still young. The smile she returned was playful and they walked along, for while things in the bigger picture might be moving toward a whole new world, that didn&#39;t mean that life just stopped. And for weres, that meant that life and love moved on.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... what do you suppose your family&#39;s up to?&quot; Tad wondered, &quot;You said your folks were having a night out and your brothers were staying with friends...&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy nodded as she opened the front door to the Howler home and ushered Tad in. The two entered into the front living room with Tad looking to the stairs that lead up to second floor and then to the hallway that would lead out toward the backdoor. It was small talk for the moment, as if there were some leftovers to share,  it might take a little while to heat them up before transforming and going out for local venison.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... by now my folks should be just getting into Seattle,&quot; Amy answered, &quot;and my brothers are probably showing their friends their new fursonas.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In some excitement, I suppose,&quot; Tad commented with a smile as he followed Amy into the kitchen while remembering the help that the Howlers had asked for with regards to their fears and worries in relation to her brothers transforming a year early, as Amy had. Thankfully that all turned out well and he and Amy were able to get them to enjoy some activities and games that would be good for them and didn&#39;t require sex. Privately, it was something Tad still found most amusing on how lessons that his parents had taught him when it came time for his first transformation lived on, even in  a place that was very open with regard to the existence of weres and the hormonal urges that went along with it.<br />
<br />
Amy chuckled and nodded as she set about going through the fridge and locating the leftovers that she&#39;d referred to earlier. It wasn&#39;t anything much, but it did look good and Tad was eager to help. What followed were directions on partitioning the leftovers, with the point of making sure that they saved room for venison later. Tad nodded as he divided the fried potatoes that was in one of the dishes that Amy had retrieved and then did the same with the sliced ham that had been placed beside it. While Tad handled that, Amy found a pair of glasses and filled them with water.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re sure your folks won&#39;t mind?&quot; Tad asked finished dividing up the leftovers.<br />
<br />
&quot;They won&#39;t,&quot; Amy gave a laugh, &quot;Dad might grumble a little at not being able to be the one to eat the leftovers... but he won&#39;t complain that they&#39;ve been eaten. Don&#39;t worry.&quot;<br />
<br />
They then quietly went about warming up their light dinners in the microwave and then settling down on the couch to watch a bit of television while they were waiting. They didn&#39;t watch anything too serious as they ate the warmed food and noticed night fully settling on Moon Lake outside. As once they were done, there was the plan to go out and hunt, likely with some implication of there also being some fun after that as well.  And for Tad, that did seem like a fun prospect. The world might be getting ready for major changes... but life went on.</p>
