<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The illusion hiding Nikea&#39;s demonic appearance began melting away and pooling in an inky darkness on her the floor of her sex-dungeon-come-apartment before evaporating. Indulging herself, she brought a hand up to her mouth and yawned. Then Nikea smiled faintly, her fingers lightly running over a hermaphroditic statuette on her way to the kitchen. So much of her life had changed. All of it for the better. She retrieved a wine glass and a bottle of red. The label alone was enough to wet her appetite. <br />
<br />
“Midnight,” nothing happened as she called out for her kitten. The succubus could sense her pet, however, and after pouring herself half a glass, set out to find her little stray. It didn&#39;t take long. Arching her spine in a slow and sensual motions she bent down and Nikea peered into one of the hollowed out chambers of her pet&#39;s tower. She saw a small black-furred cat curled up in a ball, sleeping soundly. <br />
<br />
Gently grasping her, Nikea allowed the stirring cat a moment to nuzzle herself inside the nook she made between her arm and bountiful chest. “uNnmrrow.” The mewling didn&#39;t amount to much of complaint before Midnight fell back into a drowsy sleep. Had she been another of her toys, this act of defiance may have irked her. But, Midnight was nothing more than a pet – and a cat at that, who had their own mind and ideas about their owners&#39; commands. You couldn&#39;t get angry at them any more than a raccoon going through your trash in a search for dinner. <br />
<br />
After swirling the glass in her hand, watching the liquid paint the walls a faint shade of red, she brought it up for a sip. With a pleasant shiver going through her spine as she took another, Nikea sunk into her lavish sofa. Cat resting on her lap. Expensive wine. And... a blue flame appeared over one the succubus&#39; fingers that she used to set a alight a thin cigarette. Nikea let the smoke linger in her mouth and throat, its taste mixing with that of the fruity flavor of the wine, before releasing in a long breath. <br />
<br />
The scent of nicotine was apparently enough to wake Midnight. Her eyes followed the cigarette with something approaching envy reflected in the irises&#39; emerald surfaces. It didn&#39;t surprise the succubus. Smoking had been one of that odious Sullivan&#39;s many delightful vices. Now they were hers. Nikea scratched her kitten behind her ears. “No need to be coy, my darling pet.” <br />
<br />
Given permission, Midnight shifted into her hybrid form. She pressed her body against her owner, throwing her paws thrown around her neck. Mewling, she rubbed her silken fur needily against Nikea&#39;s scarlet skin while she waited for her to take a deep lungful of smoke. Though instead of releasing it, Nikea cupped the slight nuzzle and guided her pet to her mouth. Small tendrils escaped from the edges in the moment between parting her lips and kissing her. “Mreewrow.” Midnight eagerly accepted her owner&#39;s gift with a throaty, reverberating purr. Her padded paw brushed against the length of Nikea&#39;s arm before snatching the cigarette while her owner was distracted.  <br />
<br />
Nikea arched her spine, joining in with a husky moan of her own. “Not...,” Midnight returned for her smokey kiss, interrupting her owner who didn&#39;t mind that at all. All those hours spent alone in the apartment had to be difficult. The seconds stretched before they liberated themselves from each other&#39;s eager tongues, “mhmm... too far. I am entertaining a pair of my slaves tonight.” Nikea paused as she brought out a new cigarette for herself and watched the wispy coiling smoke rise. It didn&#39;t last long as her own need returned her to her pet&#39;s hungry mouth. <br />
<br />
But Midnight was taking things slower, following her owner&#39;s command. They explored each other while they smoked, breathing it out against their sensitive parts as fingertips and paws sensually touched and roamed the other&#39;s body. It was gradually building until Nikea wrapped her slender digits around her pet&#39;s cock that had risen from its sheath. “Mrnayh-” The succubus silenced her pet with a sloppy kiss, her hand pumping the humanoid, nine inch shaft. <br />
<br />
Midnight was pinned against the sofa as her owner pushed her down. Then, Nikea moved with the same feline grace she was capable of along her lithe and limber body until she reached her crotch. As the succubus released her breath, Midnight could feel the smoke caress her gland like a lover before it was swallowed, its length pushing into her owner&#39;s throat. <br />
<br />
Nikea&#39;s eyes fluttered with the pure pleasure she felt her pet&#39;s filling her mouth. There was no struggle as she pushed her pet&#39;s member further and buried her face against Midnight&#39;s crotch. Spending an entire workday among a throng of humans and their chaotic lust was almost overwhelming. Nikea bobbed, sliding the cock half-way out before pushing it back into her gagging and contracting gullet. Nothing like the ordered, focused and delicious desire of her pet&#39;s single-minded obsession to please her owner. She rewarded Midnight, slipping the length fully out to run her tongue and wrap it around the cock&#39;s throbbing circumference. And then didn&#39;t relent when her attention turned toward her furred testicles and the dripping folds of her pussy. <br />
<br />
She continually brought her to the edge, inflicting the same pleasurable torture on Midnight as she had to endure. Her laughter filled the apartment, mingling with Midnight&#39;s mewling and gasps; enjoying herself as she toyed and played with her pet in ways only a succubus could. Nikea kept returning to her feline pet&#39;s cock, nosily sucking up the bubbling pre-cum emerging from her urethra. When she felt Midnight was close, Nikea returned to where she begun, taking her swelling member into her throat. <br />
<br />
Her cumming seemed to last for over a minute, a constant release of sticky white effluence into her owner&#39;s mouth. Only when Midnight felt as her balls had shrunken back into her body, did Nikea head rise. The succubus brushed away a stray lock. Her mouth was open, and inside a last mouthful of cum swirled with movement of her long tongue. Midnight swallowed to drown in the saliva her glands excreted when she noticed it. Her owner seemed ready to swallow too, she could see the thought playing on her features. <br />
<br />
Nikea crawled over her pet&#39;s body, mouth still partially open let the cum drip and create a trail. Without a word, the succubus kissed her and pushed the cum into Midnight with her tongue. Midnight could feel a burning in her lungs when they separated, her chest heaving as she gasped for air. Nikea meanwhile, looked radiant and rejuvenated after consuming her lust alongside her cum.<br />
<br />
“You did well, pet.” The succubus praised her kitten before taking another of drag of her cigarette. <br />
<br />
Midnight couldn&#39;t resist the sheer joy thrumming through her being. She followed her owner&#39;s example, needing a second to calm herself. “Mrreeeoow.” <br />
<br />
Not bothering to clothe herself, the succubus moved over to the door. She could overhear a hushed conversation on the other side. Or an attempt at one. The apprehension one of them felt was palpable. As was her lust.<br />
<br />
Nikea opened the door in the middle of a sentence of an animated Yu-Mi. <br />
<br />
She had changed further from their tryst in the changing room. The Asian&#39;s cleavage was still as deep as valley, with her breasts straining against a slutty and witchy Halloween costume. But her legs were longer, following the exaggerated curve of her voluptuous body. And her face and confident stance belonged on a model walking the stage of the Paris Fashion Week with full and kissable lips, long lashes framing an exotic and sultry grace and perfectly contoured face. The gothic makeup she wore was expertly applied, almost as if a natural part of the eighteen-year-old. And the same applied to Yu-Mi&#39;s silver spun hair which had lost any hint of a bleached artificiality. It was no surprise that the pendant resting against her neck was entirely drained of its corruptive energies. <br />
<br />
But surprise did first play in her slave&#39;s eyes when Yu-Mi laid eyes on her mistress&#39; true form before they widened in understanding and immediately turned into smoldering and burning coals. Despite the argument that Nikea had interrupted, a manicured, long-nailed hand was lovingly holding that of her lover. She tightened her grip further, offering her strength as Nikea&#39;s attention shifted to her little friend.<br />
<br />
The succubus&#39; lips quirked in an amused smirk as she saw who it was, her head tilting slightly to the side.</p>
