<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Three-fifteen in the Morning, September 26. Robert’s Forest.<br />
<br />
Wendy had lost sight of Lisa, but Debra was still in front of her. There was a clearing up ahead, and Debra had slowed her pace. Wendy runs up along side Debra at the clearing’s edge. It was so dark, Wendy could only see Lisa’s shape, but Debra’s keen eyes saw far greater.<br />
<br />
Lisa stood at the center of the field, her clothes lying beneath her feet, the wind gently gliding her vibrant hair over her sculpted body.  Her majestic ashen eyes entrancing all that gazed upon her.<br />
<br />
Debra slowly steps forward, undressing herself as she locked eyes on her alpha. There was no resisting the call. Lisa needed her, the coven needed her, Sharon needed her.<br />
<br />
Wendy could only watch as her coven sisters appeared around her, following the same suit as Debra. They were going to change here, the same place where Sharon was fully inducted into the coven. Only this time there will be no celebration or fantasizing. They will change for Sharon, and bring her back to those she loved.<br />
<br />
Wendy remembered when she accepted the gift from Lisa. <br />
“You'll be strong and powerful, with a sleek, sexy body. You'll change in the moonlight. You'll grow thick rich fur, a long tail, and sharp claws and fangs.” <br />
She closed her eyes, feeling the sensual pleasures under her, triggered by the memory, her hands slowly moving down to meet those desires. <br />
<br />
“Wendy…” the wind echoed her name. Her eyes moved up. The grass, the field, she saw everything with resounding clarity. The darkness parted as the moonlight illuminated her view. Her sisters, they were ready, and soon she will be with them.<br />
<br />
They lined up, forming an open crescent facing Wendy, their clothes discarded in the same manner as Lisa’s. Each and every one stunning her in their own unique ways:<br />
<br />
Brenda’s figure was a match to any major female athlete. Her muscles blended in smoothly across her body, giving her shapely curves and flexible shapes. She was the only one amongst the pack with blue eyes that seemed to glow vividly in the low light. Her dirty brown hair had a slight reddish hue that hinted of her Irish decent. With these attributes, she was the pack’s symbol of unwavering strength.<br />
<br />
Anaya. To say she had the body of a super model would have been an understatement. Her appearance was a striking resemblance to well known actress, Angelina Jolie, which she modestly down plays. Her long black hair stopping above her shoulders only intensified the look of her seductive stare. It was without a doubt that Anaya was their view of undeniable beauty.<br />
<br />
Ebony’s dark skin and deep complexion only further enhanced her profound look. Her rich obsidian hair slightly curled toward the ends, giving them bounce. Her brown colored eyes were the only source of simplicity throughout her marveled, detailed body. Most would be amazed how well she kept herself with her behind the desk job. To the others, she holds their belief of intrinsic virtue.<br />
<br />
Solange’s dark brown eyes betrayed little of the intelligence that entailed her. There’s no wonder how she would sway the eyes and minds of jurors into her favor, for what they saw was what all other French women envy. Blemishes, lines, winkles dared not mar her smooth, elegant face. Her body contoured evenly down to her wide hips. Solange was the coven’s source of invaluable knowledge.<br />
<br />
Debra was the shortest member, but she had a heart that matched her grandeur. Her green eyes did not display of envy or jealousy toward her coven members. They were the caring eyes of a mother, a caretaker. Her frame was much like her daughter’s, petite yet gorgeous. Her dark brown hair draped over her chest, barely covering the nipples on her twin mounds.  Being the heart and soul of the coven, Debra’s was the embodiment of everlasting compassion.<br />
<br />
Lisa stood brilliantly in the night. Her physique was the combination of Brenda’s strength, Anaya’s beauty, and Ebony’s complexion. Although her eyes glimmered of intelligence and compassion, her look was that of authority. She demanded herself to be the best to lead her coven sisters of which she was proud of. It is as if she commanded the winds themselves that brushed ever so lightly over her body. She was their leader, she was their Alpha.<br />
<br />
They started their changes in unison. Patches of fur sprouted all over their bodies, fangs and faces extended forming a muzzle, bones popped as they realigned themselves for their new forms. Amidst their physical transformation, the changes in their eyes were the most stunning. Some retained their same color, only more luminescent than before. Debra was now emerald green, Brenda sapphire blue, Lisa silvery gray; while Solange, Ebony, and Anaya were a predatory orange-yellow. <br />
<br />
Wendy didn’t notice the small subtle changes over her as well, although dismissing most of them. She had figured her eyes had adjusted to the darkness, the silence allowed her to hear the slight rustle of the wind on the leaves, and that the grass smelled from the dew, but her senses were heightened on Lisa’s behalf. It was as close to completion that Wendy can go. <br />
<br />
All but one turned into their full wolf form, Debra. She was still standing on her two legs as a hybrid. She beckoned Wendy to follow as Lisa led her sisters into the woods. Dashing with renewed vigor, Wendy and Debra reentered the forest.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Elsewhere,<br />
<br />
Blackhorn rummaged through the paper work he requested. A pang of guilt haunted him for what he had done. He wanted to protect Wendy from Vix even if it meant lying to her. Vix was bad news and he knew she wouldn’t hesitate to kill in order to get her way.<br />
<br />
In reality, there was no file on Vix. The information he had told Wendy was made up on spot. He knew it was wrong, but felt justified. Vix had left him in the dark ever since he denied her request for back up. Shortly afterwards, he lost command of Ranger team. Everything was away from his grasp and control, barred by this mysterious department Vix worked for.<br />
<br />
This hasn’t stopped him from searching for answers. He continued to press on to find out more about Vix and her department. He hoped that what he had done will keep Wendy safe until he finds out more.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Meanwhile,<br />
<br />
Vix pulled off the main road into a dirt worn path, slowing to retain control while she pondered on previous matters.<br />
<br />
She had been experiencing more flashbacks and dreams within this week than any given month in her life. It was giving her a headache and it confused her.<br />
<br />
The nightmares she had of being a lycanthrope stopped after that last one where she was able to wake herself. Lisa, a werewolf alpha, kept her word in respecting Vix’s humanity. Vix didn’t take her crossbow, which she always carries, to the meeting with the pack. She had a conversation with Debra on how lycanthropes lead normal lives. Wendy, who she felt so closely toward, helped her in retaking the Ranger team.<br />
<br />
“Wendy…” Vix whispered. She couldn’t get her out of her mind, every thought lead to her predicament with Wendy. It wasn’t fair. For once, she had someone who been through the same place she had. They both graduated from the same Air Force ROTC academy, they’re both federal agents, they’re both doing their duty, if not for the FBI then for themselves. Vix had her vengeance, Wendy had her sisterhood. To Vix, she felt like she herself was getting the short end of the stick. The loving warmth of how the coven members treated each other had affected her. For far too long she had coldly remained to her duties.<br />
<br />
Vix shook her head. “No, I have to stay focused,” she reminded herself. “Wendy will never forgive me for what I have to do.” She calmly repeated that statement several more times, trying to distance herself from the matters ahead.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Back at Robert’s Forest,<br />
<br />
Wendy was easily keeping up with Debra. They both moved swiftly by the trees and branches, trying to keep up with the rapid movement of the pack. Debra wasn’t worried about losing sight of her sisters; their scent was all she needed to follow.<br />
<br />
Wendy readjusted the wrist band Vix gave her. She wanted to make sure Vix would be able to follow in hope that she will arrive with the Ranger team in time. She understood the risk she placed her pack in, but she believed in Vix. There was something she remembered that made Vix dependable to her. A memory she’s still trying to pin point. <br />
<br />
Lisa, followed closely by her coven sisters, bounded over a shrub and spotted a small glade up ahead. She carefully padded over hiding in the bushes as she peered onward. What she saw next, left her wide-eyed.</p>
