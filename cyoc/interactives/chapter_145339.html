<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff was right that it was going to be a long night as he sat in the closet his smooth lower body collapsing as his torso sat on his muscle less coat body. Trying to find a position to lay down Jeff thankfully found one as he set he&#39;d himself back out enough so that he wasn&#39;t uncomfortable.<br />
During the night Jeff played with his smooth and empty nether regions, pushing them down to see feel how long it would take them to push back up. It was rather awkward considering that his nether regions were shunted to Alice&#39;s size, rather then his own. However as the night dragged on his navel lost its muscle slowly, joining with his body cavity as part of the coat as his legs slowly, mere millimeters at a time. &#39;That&#39;s coat’s don&#39;t have legs, though they have arms.&#39; Jeff thought, wondering if he would lose his arms alongside his legs. During the night something uncomfortable happened as Jeff&#39;s feet started cramping up, Jeff sitting up on his elbows and watching in the darkness as his toes started to deform, ever so slowly mushing together as his toenails dissapeared.<br />
Laying back down Jeff resolved himself to a long night as he contiuned playing with himself, the white slowly moving up his body as his cavity expanded slowly. Over the long hours the white had made it about two centimeters past where his belly button had used to be as his toes continued to deform. When light started peeking through the closet again Jeff got a clear view of his feet and legs.<br />
His legs had shrunk about a foot, and his toes has serverly deformed, to the point it was hard to even identify them as toes rather then just a mushy mash of flesh. But Jeff didn&#39;t care as he contiued waiting and watching wriggling his feet and playing with his smooth coat parts as time past by.<br />
Eventually Alice woke up and got ready for the day, opening her closest and looking down at Jeff. &quot;Morning my coat, I told you last night that I was going to the pool right?&quot; Alice asked as Jeff nodded, noticing she was no longer calling him Jeff. &quot;Good, you can stay in my room all you want today, but once I get back, it&#39;s back in the closet with you, understand?&quot; Alice asked as Jeff nodded and slowly got up, Alice allowing him to walk past her as she got her clothes for the day.<br />
Jeff&#39;s leg movements were sluggish as he looked over at the mirror, at this point he looked like he was wearing the bottom half of a girl&#39;s coat, but he knew better as he pushed his former stomach inward, waiting for it to come back as Alice started undressing in front of him.<br />
Jeff remained silent for a few minutes as Alice undressed and then redressed before leaving, waving him goodbye as Jeff stretched his arms and went to sit on the bed.<br />
Doing so quickly proved uncomfortable as his body squished in even further then last night, his stomach gone as he choose to check just how large his body cavity was at this point. Going down to his crotch he started pushing inward, shivering in slight pleasure as his smooth part collapsed until his hand was all the way to just below his lungs odds were by the night he would be unable to breath.<br />
And so began his daily wait for Alice to return, Jeff laying on the bed stretched out in all his naked coat glory, rubbing his smooth lower body just for the heck of it as his feet contiued to deform and his legs contiued to shrink. To his surprise the white material didn&#39;t advance any further up his navel, but given that his legs were still shrinking that meant something much different, that by the end of the night he wouldn&#39;t be able to walk, and he would probobly have hole befitting a fur hood coat for girls.<br />
Hours passed as Jeff watched the mirror for his changes, at this point he straight up no longer had feet, but two holes in the bottom&#39;s on his legs that would soon be his  hole as his legs contiued to shrink. Odds were if he even tried to walk he would be unable to, as the lack of feeling in his former legs demonstrated to him as he grabbed them with his hands and made them flop about like empty sacks of flesh.<br />
When Alice returned Jeff had almost nothing left of his legs, just two five inch long sacks of flesh with holes in them that led to his body cavity. &quot;What&#39;s my coat doing out here? You should be in the closet.&quot; Alice said when she saw Jeff on the bed, picking him up by his shoulders with ease as Alice opened her closest and set Jeff inside, his remaining torso causing him to fold in on himself uncomfortable as Alice sat him down and closed the closet. Jeff simply sighed as he sat their, his arms by his sides as the hours contiuned to pass, Alice doing her own thing as Jeff&#39;s legs completely shrunk away, leaving him with a hole on him, his first actual opening of his coat like body.<br />
The forth day had passed, and tomorrow would bring new changes to him as Jeff sat in the closet, currently half coat.</p>
