<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Thank God you still seem to be working, which is more than I can say for my mom.&quot; Jeff was still talking to himself - a habit of spending a lot of his time alone with computers.  &quot;I thought for sure I would be left as Kyle&#39;s new fuck toy and never see you again.  Okay, computer booted.  Chronivac synching.&quot;  Jeff sighed with relief. &quot;Now all I have to do is figure out why you&#39;re not working properly.&quot;  The documentation that came with it was next to nonexistant, but Jeff had a knack for computers.  &quot;Man, next time I think about turning myself into a cheerleader, I definitely need to ask myself if I want to end up being at the wrong end of some hot dude&#39;s dick.&quot;<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t seem to hit Jeff what he just said, he never referred to guys as &quot;hot&quot;.  He was so engrossed in trying to find his way into the Chronivac&#39;s code that he didn&#39;t even notice the person coming up behind him... until the floor creaked.<br />
<br />
Jeff spun.  &quot;Shit!&quot;  He jumped, startled and nearly knocking his desk over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, it&#39;s just me, I came in the back, I just wanted to talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was Kyle Reed.  He spoke quietly and quickly.  He held his hands up, trying to calm Jeff down.  &quot;Please,&quot; he said with a worried expression, hoping no one else heard Jeff.  &quot;Something happened, something I don&#39;t understand...&quot;  He took a deep breath, continuing more slowly, calmly. &quot;I just want to talk.&quot;  He took a step back to give Jeff some space, opening his hands wide, showing him that he had nothing to fear, his eyes big with sincerity.  &quot;Just talk, I promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle,&quot; Jeff spoke in hushed tones, putting a finger to his own lips.  They listened for several seconds, neither of them moving.  Silence.  Save for the hum of Jeff&#39;s computer, and the sound of the air conditioner downstairs (Jeff could hear it through the closed door to his room).  Thankfully, his mother apparently hadn&#39;t heard them.  &quot;Okay... dude, seriously, you can&#39;t just walk into people&#39;s houses and sneak up on them like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Kyle said, looking like he was about ready to cry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, never mind,&quot; Jeff dismissed it.  He wonderd now just how much - if anything - Kyle remembered.  Jeff himself, could remember all of it, of course.  He hated seeing Kyle like this, his big blue eyes looked so sad.  They were so electric - so pretty - when he smiled.  Wait, what?  Jeff thought to himself.  The transformation back to himself - his real self - was complete; he had gained the two years he had lost, his room was his old room again.  There weren&#39;t any frilly pillows or stuffed animals or boyband posters or any pink paint on the walls... no big dildos filling his ass (why am I suddenly missing it?) or cock rings in his browser history.  So why was he suddenly feeling a strong magnetic pull toward Kyle now?<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I have to tell you a secret...&quot; Kyle started nervously.<br />
<br />
My God he&#39;s sexy, Jeff thought, and simply couldn&#39;t help himself.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Kyle found himself being kissed by Jeff, their tongues doing the liplock tango.  Both boys were lost in the moment.  Concerns, thoughts, worries all wiped away with a single kiss.  They both moaned, holding each other.  Finally, Jeff came up for air.  The boys just smiled at each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know.  You&#39;re gay.&quot;  Jeff got lost in Kyle&#39;s dimples, and this time Kyle kissed him.  It must have been at least 10 minutes before the boys could pull themselves from one another.  They lay back on Jeff&#39;s bed, in each other&#39;s arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t understand what happened today,&quot; Kyle said, then grinned at Jeff, &quot;But I don&#39;t care.  I&#39;ve liked you for so long, and always wanted to tell you, but could never get up the nerve.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff couldn&#39;t believe what he was hearing.  &quot;But you&#39;re the captain of the football team.  Why would you want a computer nerd when you could have someone like Brad Davis - he&#39;s gay isn&#39;t he?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Kyle answered, &quot;But he&#39;s not my type.  And you are... but I always thought you were straight and I just couldn&#39;t bear hearing you say you&#39;re not gay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that&#39;s just the thing...&quot; Jeff thought for a moment.  &quot;I mean, I don&#39;t think I am...&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle just grinned and Jeff felt his heart melting.  &quot;You could have fooled me.&quot;  Kiss<br />
<br />
Jeff moaned, it felt so good to be in his boyfriend&#39;s arms.  Wait, boyfriend?  He reluctantly pulled away from Kyle, getting up and going to the computer.  He picked up the Chronivac emitter.  &quot;It&#39;s this thing... it made me gay, but then it changed me back... but that was after I made myself a girl, so I could be a cheerleader, but then Coach Feminist Nazi caught me.  I changed back but she thought I was just being a pervert and was going to call the police, so see I had to be gay or else I&#39;d go to prison...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay....&quot; Kyle got up to join him, looking at him questioningly.<br />
<br />
Jeff realized he wasn&#39;t making much sense to Kyle, and stopped.  He took a deep breath, holding up the remote emitter, then started over.  &quot;The Chronivac.  It&#39;s a device that can alter reality, and... well, I did some altering.  But then things got out of hand.  The short version is, I ended up gay and the next thing I knew we were an item.  But see, I&#39;m not really gay.  And you - well, I don&#39;t know if you were before or not, to be honest.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle looked hurt.  &quot;So... you don&#39;t want to be with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I, no you don&#39;t understand...&quot;  Jeff just looked at Kyle... then realized he did want to be with him.  It was probably just whatever was going on with the Chronivac, but it felt real.  So very real.  &quot;Yes.  I DO want to be with you, Kyle.&quot;  He took his hand, looking into his eyes (it feels strange not looking up into his eyes).  &quot;I... I just feel like I made a mess of reality today, and I don&#39;t want to do any more damage.  Wouldn&#39;t it be better to put everything back to normal, and just keep it that way?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle put Jeff&#39;s hand on his chest, looking soulfully at Jeff.  &quot;I have memories of you.  I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re a dream, or real any more.  But I do know you&#39;re the best thing that ever happened to me, Jeffery, and if putting things back means losing my best friend, my boyfriend, and my lover... the guy I&#39;d give my life for in a heartbeat... then how could I be okay with that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff looked at Kyle quietly.  Being called Jeffery made him feel like he was looking up at this big strong hunk even though he wasn&#39;t.   Made him feel so cared for and safe.  So happy.  So gay.  And grateful to be gay.  His voice seemed so small.  &quot;I don&#39;t know what to say.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Say we&#39;ll be boyfriends, Jeffery,&quot; Kyle said simply.  &quot;Say you&#39;ll be mine forever.  Say you&#39;ll fix it so that this is reality... because right now, to me, this is the only reality I care about.&quot;  Kyle pulled Jeff close, hugging him, tears running down his face.  &quot;I love you, Jeffery.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff closed his eyes, hugging Kyle back.  He didn&#39;t know when he had stared crying, but he felt the tears running down his own cheeks now.  &quot;I love you too, Kyle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please tell me you&#39;ll do it, that we can stay like this.&quot;</p>
