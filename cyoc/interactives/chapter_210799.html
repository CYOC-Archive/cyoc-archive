<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff&#39;s deeply-asleep mind was a swirl of intense and inexplicable dreams. Various vivid  kaleidoscope of colors and images rapidly moved through his brain. It was a confusing mess, and lasted only 45 minutes or so in real time. It was an intensely drowsy sleep, like after eating a turkey dinner at Thanksgiving, or during a car ride. A sleep so deep and drowsy and so full of confusing and random images and colors, that it&#39;s almost like taking a giant deuce for your brain in that moment.<br />
<br />
When you first begin to wake from such an intense nap, you begin to wake up confused and groggy for a few minutes. Afterwards, you slowly become more and more aware of your surroundings, until you are fully awake with such focused clarity, that it felt like your brain finally let go of a gigantic deuce that was weighing you down. <br />
<br />
Well, that&#39;s what it was like for poor Jeff. He was so completely dead to the world in such a deeply unconscious state, that a 45 minute nap was all his brain needed. He began to stir from his post-sexual sleep. At first, he could have sworn he was safe and at home in his bed. That was his entire expectation that he was taking totally for granted like he always had while waking up in bed at home. <br />
<br />
&quot;Haaaawwww!&quot; he yawned while stretching his four legs and his entire body at once. Even his tail, which felt oddly really satisfying to his lower back in a way he had never stretched before. <br />
<br />
He also began to taste a very thick and sour morning breath. (&quot;Shit! I gotta brush my teeth!&quot;) &quot;Haaaww he hhaaww heee hhaaww-&quot; <br />
<br />
He stopped in mid speech as an irritating familiar noise exited from his mouth!<br />
<br />
He opened his eyes, and was extremely disoriented. He was in a field! A field that was from another crazy dream he had! And his body-<br />
<br />
&quot;Heee hhaaww-!&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff stopped again in mid-bray. That&#39;s when it first began to register in his mind, even as he entered into denial-mode. Like a deer in headlights, all Jeff could do is just stand there in shocking silence and drink in at what he was seeing....<br />
<br />
Legs instead of arms and hands! A large bulbouse gray-fur-clad body extending back behind his vision. And....a....tail randomly whipping in and out of view!<br />
<br />
(&quot;No! No, no, no!&quot;) &quot;Haaww! Heee, haaww, hhee hhaaww!!&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff began to sob in deslaration. He had been stuck continuously as a donkey for a full day now. Since yesterday! He hasn&#39;t felt the satisfying separation of fingers for a day. He hasn&#39;t been able to say an actual single word. He&#39;s just been here, in this field, stuck on all four legs! He hasn&#39;t showered, bathed, or brushed his teeth! <br />
<br />
All hes done, all he&#39;s been able to do, was just stand around in some field, eat grass, be fucked,  swat biting flies with his tail, and shit and piss! That&#39;s it! <br />
<br />
Jeff began to panic, as he saw his entire life stretch out just doing those six things! It&#39;s only been a single day, and he was already sick of being forced to walk around on four legs and not have fingers he could stretch and wiggle! <br />
<br />
&quot;,Heee hhaaww heeee hhaaww heee hhaaww!&quot; Jeff began braying, trying to eke out a word. Any word would do! But no! Words would never be allowed to escape his big thick rubbery donkey lips! <br />
<br />
Jeff began to work himself up in a bit of a frenzy, not realizing he was getting close to the electric fence. His sharp hearing picked up the sound of electrical crackling, which automatically made his gray fur stand up on end in fright. His body instinctually back away, as he began to angrily bray at it. <br />
<br />
After a while, he began to tire himself out as he started feeling hungry. The grass beneath his hooves began to smell appetizing to his instincts, but his human brain was beginning to focus on another panic session. He knew he couldn&#39;t resist grazing like last time, like the jackass he still was. His second meal since switching places with this donkey will have to yet again, be grass! <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, fuck!&quot; Jeff thought, as he bent his muzzle of an equine face attached to his  long neck towards the grass. &quot;I don&#39;t want to end up eating grass again!&quot; But there was no arguing with his body&#39;s survival instincts. Eating grass he did. Like all the other grazing farm animals, he wound up spending most of his second day continually biting off, chewing, and swallowing grass. His body periodically letting large donkey turds behind to refertilize the very grazing field he was eating from. A torrential pour hot of piss had sped out of his dick as well, which splattered all over his hooves and wet down his furry lower legs. <br />
<br />
Jeff minded being pissed on by this donkey&#39;s body he was forced to inhabit. But the body itself didn&#39;t mind. Jeff was forced to go along continually grazing. Forced to experience feeding himself as a fucking donkey. <br />
<br />
About mid day or so, Jeff couldn&#39;t tell exactly what time it was, but the sun was becoming warm on his thick fur and hide. He had FINALLY stopped grazing after who knows how many hours. It was like coming out of a trance to Jeff&#39;s mind. He suddenly found himself able to lift his own head and get his own bearings. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hee haaww-&quot; he brayed momentarily, then stopped himself. He was sick of that stupid noise he has to make anytime he tries to speak. He was sick of being constantly forced to see his own flanks and sides anytime he even looks the slightest bit in any direction other than straight forward. Well. As straight forward as his wide-eyed equine vision would allow anyway. He was mostly sick of constantly being stuck with these damned hooves that he can&#39;t do anything with except to stand and walk on! <br />
<br />
But this was his life now. Whether he liked it not, he was stuck as a donkey. Every little moment of his life from now on will be like this. Jeff was trying to reconcile this in his mind, when he had a little flash as boredom began to creep inand he realized yet another day was passing by and the only he&#39;s done was what was already listed above:<br />
<br />
Eat, piss, shit, sleep, and fuck. And that&#39;s all he ever could do in this condition. And he&#39;ll be be doing that forever, as all farm animals do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck this! No I won&#39;t! I WILL get out of this!&quot;<br />
<br />
With a bray, he decided to march on all fours as the angry farm animal he was, right up to the electric fence. Then. He stopped! He felt the fur along his back stand up on end, and Jeff suddenly felt a wave of dizzying nauseous irrational fear spike up in his heart! It was like how he felt with heights! He got that weird tingling on the bottoms of all four of his hooves, exactly like that weird tingling on the bottoms of his feet as a human when he was up high! <br />
<br />
He found himself backing away from that crackling fence. His huge sensitive ears picked up the snapping and crackling in intense high volume. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heee hhaaww!&quot; He brayed, unable to speak his mind. <br />
<br />
Jeff tried to will his body forward. It was just a little fence and a little bit of electricity. But his fear level of that sound and past experience of his inherited body touching it when it was occupied by the mind of a dumb beast, kept Jeff from approaching within ten feet of that fence. He did manage to take one more hoof step towards it, but he immediately reacted out of fear, like taking one more step towards the edge of a big drop. Jeff had to take several more steps backwards into an arbitrary &quot;safe zone&quot; from that fence.<br />
<br />
From there, with his heart still racing, Jeff just stood still, contemplating while checking out his own body once again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heee hhaaww!&quot; he brayed yet again out of frustration. &quot;Well, this is no good,&quot; he thought. &quot;I can&#39;t even go near that damn fence! And I can&#39;t live like this with this god damn fucking body! I gotta find a way out!&quot;<br />
<br />
Where there&#39;s electricity, there&#39;s a source. Jeff decided to go and try to find the source for this electrified fence. He lifted his head as high as he could and used what poor and weirdly distorted vision he had to look around the field he was stuck in. What he was looking for, were buildings. He couldn&#39;t see any anywhere. Just a low hill of field grass behind him, and a sloping  hill to some trees before him just on the other side of that damned fence. <br />
<br />
Well, there&#39;s gotta be something that leads to this field from somewhere. Electricity isn&#39;t just magically supplied to a fence.  He hadn&#39;t yet seen a barn or a stable or anything, as he&#39;s spent his entire time as a donkey in this field. Surely there was SOMETHING. As much as Jeff hated walking with his four legs, he decided he should trace the outline of the fence until he found something interesting.<br />
<br />
The thing about Jeff&#39;s hangup in walking, is the fact that he&#39;s forced to do so on all fours. He has no choice to walk any other way. He can&#39;t stand upon two legs like humans do. His physiology disallows him that more dignified stance. To him, walking is another way that signifies his demeaning situation. <br />
<br />
But walk, he did. He had to do SOMETHING in the attempt to escape this damned field! He can&#39;t spend his entire life here, in this one plot of land. He had places to go and people to see! He needed to switch back into his own human body. How he was going to do that, he hadn&#39;t even thought of yet. His first obstacle was escaping this field.</p>
