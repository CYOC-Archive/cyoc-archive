<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Harrison family who lived in Minnesota was your average upper-middle class family. Cindy an attractive woman and a mother of 4 was always close to her children, except for Joe since he hit puberty. Unlike Kate, Cindy had a very difficult time raising Joe when he started high school. His rebellious attitude was always an issue considering she was working full-time as a secretary in an insurance company. This probably had a lot to do with Joe being in the football team and being very socially active she thought. Her husband Bob always responded Cindy&#39;s concerns by telling her it&#39;s just a phase and he will turn out fine once he starts college next fall. She just wished, she could understand him better.<br />
<br />
Cindy heard her alarm going off for work. She slapped at her nightstand trying to locate her alarm clock without opening her eyes. She rolled towards the other side of the bed to wake up Bob but he had already left for work before her. She remembered he had a business meeting very early in the morning.<br />
<br />
Cindy sat up and opened her eyes mumbling to herself &quot;I might aswell get up&quot;. She slung her covers off and swing her legs off the bed. Her feet hit the floor and she headed to the bathroom to get ready for another day.<br />
<br />
After flushing the toilet she starting knocking on the kids doors to wake them up for school. After everyone was up she went back to her bathroom and turned on the shower. Cindy was 5&#39;4 and 115 lbs with lovely light brown hair and large brown eyes. After her shower she got ready. She did her hair and make-up before getting dressed in a grey blouse, black skirt, black tights and black heels.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Going downstairs to the kitchen she noticed everyone except Joe was already ready for school and eating their breakfast cereals.<br />
<br />
&quot;Joe! Hurry up you&#39;re going to be late!&quot; Cindy shouted from downstairs. There was no response so she tried again &quot;Joe! Are you up? Come on!&quot;. Still no response so she tried one last time &quot;Don&#39;t make me come upstairs young man!&quot;.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Fuck mom, I&#39;ve heard it the first time! You dont have to repeat yourself like a million times!&quot; was heard loudly from upstairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Language Joe! You dont really want to start this early in the morning!&quot; Cindy shouted back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or what?&quot; Joe asked.<br />
<br />
Cindy had nothing to say at this point. She knew she couldnt control him. She sighed &quot;I really wish he matured up a little&quot; turning back to make her morning coffee.<br />
<br />
Joe finally got out of bed to get ready. Standing 6&#39;4 and weighing 205 lbs just like when his father used to be when Cindy met him, Joe headed to the bathroom to pee.<br />
<br />
Cindy picked up her cup of coffee once it was finished. She turned to go and knocked over another cup on the counter with her hand. “Shit” she said as it tumbled off and hit the ground. Luckily it didn’t shatter and Cindy knelt down to pick it up. <br />
<br />
As she bent at the knees and picked up the cup, she heard a soft tearing noise. A quiet yet noticeable ripping noise caught Cindy’s attention and she looked down at her leg. There, running up her black tights was an unmistakable run. <br />
<br />
“Mommy has a run on her tights!&quot; Lucy said pointing her finger at her as she laughed. God Damn it” Cindy whispered to herself. “I can’t go out of here with that…great, now I have to change”<br />
<br />
As she stood up, a wave of dizziness washed over her and she closed her eyes tightly as her head swam. “Whoa” she said as she steadied herself but she slowly opened her eyes because she could tell that something wasn’t right.<br />
<br />
She looked down and saw that the runner on her tights had multiplied many times over. There were now several runs working their way up her thighs. Her tights were very tight on her; painfully so.<br />
<br />
“Ow…what’s going on” she said as she felt herself moving. She sensed that she was rising up taller, she seemed to be lifting up; she could feel her leg muscles stretch out and tense up. Her shoes were feeling tight across her toes and even the waistline of her skirt now felt constricted. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ok, Mom?&quot; asked Kate as she was observing the runs going up her mothers legs.<br />
<br />
“Something’s not right” Cindy said as she began to move quickly upstairs to her bedroom. “Something is seriously not right” with each step, her shoes grew more uncomfortable on her feet. She stopped and tried to remove them. She tried to kick them off, but they wouldn’t budge. She finally reached down and had to yank them off, really twisting them to get them to move and free her feet. As she wrangled her shoes, she heard a new rip. The back of her right sleeve gave way and her shirt burst open exposing her right shoulder and back. “What the hell? Am I growing? What’s going on?” she asked.<br />
<br />
She looked down and saw how thin the material had gotten across her toes. It had stretched out so she could see through it and Cindy could tell that something was very wrong with her body.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
With a tear, the seam at the end of her tights gave way and her toes popped out “AH” she yelped at the way the tights peeled back. Then, as she looked closer, she really felt an urge to scream but she found no noise would come out. She watched as her feet began to change before her eyes.<br />
<br />
Cindy stood there open mouthed and wide eyed as her toe nails rearranged followed by the toes themselves. Her right foot widened and spread out; her toes became knobby and long and her nails turned pale as the tights crept out of the way of her changing foot. <br />
<br />
There was nothing she could do to stop it and her left foot soon began to rearrange itself to match the right.<br />
<br />
Her tights bulged at the ankles then the calves as her legs continued changing. The tears became wider and longer as her thighs grew longer and more muscular and changed shape away from what she had always known.<br />
<br />
“What’s happening to me…somebody help me!&quot; She shouted which was heard from downstairs.<br />
<br />
She pitched forward before standing up straight as her center of gravity shifted. Her ass deflated and flattened while still retaining a sense of muscle there. Her legs felt powerful to her, but yet wrong. The bottom of her skirt was tight against her thighs and several inches higher up than before.<br />
<br />
Her increased height showed in just how far away the floor looked to her now as she felt the zipper in the back of her skirt give way and start to descend as her waist began to expand out. <br />
<br />
It was then that Cindy felt an odd stirring in her abdomen. Her stomach churned and flipped and her hands flew there and pressed down. Her ovaries were on the move and her internal organs rearranged and changed purpose. Her uterus disappeared in a move that sent a jolt through her body.<br />
<br />
In a panic, Cindy grabbed the sides of her skirt and yanked it down. She fumbled with her tights and panties that had been stretched super tight trying to get those free too. There was a faint smell as her skin began to shift and slide and bunch up. Cindy gasped as testicles descended from her body and dropped into the newly formed sack of skin and drift downward. “Oh shit” she managed to say.<br />
<br />
More and more flesh began to gather as her clitoris repurposed itself into the head of her penis. It doubled in size, then doubled again and again as flesh and mass built up behind it and pushed it forward tenting out the tights and the panties.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit! I’ve got a dick!” she yelled in a voice that was growing deeper and deeper while looking up and down.<br />
<br />
With testosterone rushing to her body she started to feel aroused. Unintentionally she slipped her feminine hands under her tights to touch herself.  As Cindy moved her hands frantically up and down on her new appendage, her sleeves began to rise higher and higher up her arms and grow tight against her upper arms. Her back began to spread out and her white blouse could no longer handle it.<br />
<br />
The seams tore loose around her left shoulder before a split ran down from her neck down the center. Her bra pulled tight across the back and the hooks began to bend before simply giving way and popping loose. <br />
<br />
“Oh!” she said in surprise at the feeling of air on her back. Her back muscles grew strong and wide and her shoulders began to rise up and broaden.<br />
<br />
Loose strings fell away as her back and chest changed. Weight and muscle built up on her frame. Her stomach hardened and her abdominal muscles popped out in definition as she tore away at her tattered blouse.<br />
<br />
Cindy’s bra hung over her breasts though no longer hooked across her back. She looked down as she felt them rise up slightly and firm up before they began to pull inward dropping her bra flatter as they retreated.<br />
<br />
She pulled the bra down and watched as her nipples shrank, her areolas turned pink and circled down and her breasts turned into strong pectoral muscle.<br />
<br />
Cindy crossed her arms and felt the muscles working in her shoulders and neck. Her biceps were growing on her longer arms and she was grabbing at her detached sleeves to get them off and free up her arms. It took some effort to get the sleeves off over her thicker wrists but she managed it as her hands began to grow larger.<br />
<br />
Her red nail polish disappeared from her nails as her fingers thickened and her hands grew wider and stronger, helping grip her new dick much better. Her body was now distinctly male.<br />
<br />
Cindy started moaning loudly with her slighlty lower female voice as she had her first male orgasm. Cum starting leaking from her panties creating stains on her black tights.<br />
<br />
She finally took the few remaining steps into her bedroom in long strides; her tattered tights and skirt were still on but now simply a nuisance to her. She made her way to the mirror above her dresser and she looked on in shock and wonder as her face changed. <br />
<br />
Her jaw set tight and strong as her chin rounded off. Her hands came up and felt the roughness of stubble beginning to poke through her chin and cheeks.<br />
<br />
Her cheeks squared and her mouth changed in that while getting longer, her lips thinned and tightened. More hair appeared above her upper lip as her nose broadened and lengthened. Her eyes narrowed and changed from brown to green as her forehead widened and her ears grew and dropped. <br />
<br />
Her long light brown hair began to race upward off her shoulders and neck. It pulled in and set in style as a face she knew and recognized all too well.<br />
<br />
She passed out as she saw her sons face in the mirror.</p>
