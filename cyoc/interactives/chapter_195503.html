<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Curtis stared at his reflection in the bathroom mirror. Instead of his usual cruel self-appraisal, however, he breathed in and out as he tried to steady his building heartrate. His eyes traced his transformed features: his differently colored eyes gazed back at him with a friendly warmth and his naked muzzle had completely formed, tipped with the black nose of a dog. He tested a smile and noted the sharpened teeth lining his black lips as he tapped them with the black paw-pads that had formed on his fingers. <br />
<br />
The black and white fur of his ears had completely overtaken his hair. It trailed down past where his hairline used to end onto the nape of his neck and onto the top of his shoulders--a pure white with splotches of black and touches of tan at the edges. He still wasn&#39;t sure exactly what type of dog he was becoming, but he was quite proud of how soft the freshly dried fur felt, especially after his recent shower.<br />
<br />
Further down, his bushy tail hung below the towel he had wrapped around his waist--the white and black patterned fur was interspersed with the occasional touch of tan. He picked up and flexed each foot, one at a time as he marveled at the way his newly formed digitigrade stance adjusted his posture. These were his newest changes as he had been forced to kick off his shoes during the Ultimate Frisbee game. He felt strangely comfortable standing on the balls of his feet, his blunted claws clicking on the tile as he shifted his weight.<br />
<br />
He was looking forward to his fur growing in. Despite most of his contemporaries looking like they had been ripped straight from the cover of a novel written by K.A. Applegate, he was tired of looking like he&#39;d come out on the bad end of an unfortunate encounter with a lawnmower. <i>What type of dog was he?</i> The other dogs had accepted him fully and he admired their beautiful coats. His identity was changing and he felt incomplete.<br />
<br />
Curtis sighed nervously. Ollie was waiting and it was time to face the music. He&#39;d already kept his sheep waiting longer than intended as he&#39;d tried to figure out the strange nozzle that was included in his provided hygiene kit. The college clearly anticipated what he was about to do and fur dryers weren&#39;t the only novel addition to the men&#39;s shower room. He collected himself and walked down the hall. Instead of turning left towards his room, however, he lightly knocked on Ollie&#39;s door and stepped inside.<br />
<br />
Ollie reclined on the bed naked but quickly scrambled to adjust his position. He looked just as nervous as Curtis felt, though displayed clear signs of excitement beyond his obvious erection. The sheep&#39;s transformation mirrored Curtis&#39; with some small variations: his horns were still stubs, but his head was well on the way to what would likely be its final form. During work his muzzle had grown and his eyes had adjusted their positioning, though they looked adorable as they sparkled with excitement. Sheep didn&#39;t have dimples, but the way he smiled still made Curtis&#39; heart flutter, even with the distinct lack of teeth on the sides of Ollie&#39;s mouth.<br />
<br />
They had evidently misunderstood Ollie&#39;s eventual fur, which was coming in along his back and sides--dark grey but lightening as it crept towards his front. His buzzed head still had a wooly quality, as did the tops of his shoulders and the scruff of his back as well as the changed pubic hair, but otherwise the fur maintained a texture more closely resembling that of a deer, and Curtis loved his short floppy dark grey tail. Otherwise, Ollie&#39;s only real changes were his hand-hooves which had finished forming; his feet remained human and fully plantigrade.<br />
<br />
They embraced and Curtis licked Ollie&#39;s triangular caprine nose. Ollie&#39;s hooved hands surrounded the dog and caressed his ass, pulling their pelvises together. Curtis could feel Ollie&#39;s dick through the towel and his nervousness began to give way to arousal, his heart still pounding in his chest. Ollie made him feel safe. They kissed and Ollie smirked as he casually undid the towel, letting it drop to the floor as their cocks brushed against each other.<br />
<br />
<i>You make me feel like I&#39;m losin&#39; my virginity<br />
The first time, every time when you&#39;re touchin&#39; me</i><br />
<br />
&quot;How are you feelin, Puppy? We can just jerk each other off again if yer not ready.&quot; Ollie pet lightly behind Curtis&#39; ears. The pet-name went straight to his dick and the dog knew.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m ready. I want to do this with you. Just take it slow, OK?&quot; Curtis had felt a little embarrassed to admit his virginity to Ollie, but the sheep took it in stride. He promised to be gentle.<br />
<br />
Ollie responded with another kiss, pulling Curtis into his arms and spinning so the dog was against the bed. He then leaned forward as Curtis sat then laid back and the sheep climbed on top with a bleating growl. Their kisses grew wetter and more amorous as they moaned into each other, thrusting their hard shafts together. Curtis&#39; paw-pads danced across Ollie&#39;s dick and he was certain he felt it lengthen and shift, its tip flaring out. Ollie bleated fully and pulled Curtis&#39; legs around his waist and he shifted their position in preparation of his next move.<br />
<br />
<i>This evolution with you comes naturally<br />
Some call it science (science), we call it chemistry<br />
This is the story of the birds and the bees</i><br />
<br />
The sheep kissed Curtis&#39; nose and leaned over to grab a small bottle as he worked his changed shaft before pouring the liquid into his palm. &quot;Relax, Puppy. Tell me to stop and I will. Yer in control.&quot; Curtis nodded and tensed as he felt the hard hoof at his entrance. It swirled around and began to push inside of him, slick from the lube. His heart pounded in his chest, but he did his best to relax as the sheep probed him with one of his thick fingers.<br />
<br />
Curtis had experimented before, but this was an entirely new level. He breathed slowly as the sheep began to pump his finger in and out before deeming it to be properly prepared. The dog whined as the sheep withdrew his fingers to slick his shaft, but soon felt a thickness probing in their stead after Ollie pulled his legs over his shoulders.<br />
<br />
Ollie leaned forward to kiss Curtis once more then grinned, his eyes sparkling in the dim light. &quot;Are you ready?&quot; Curtis could only nod desperately as his pulse pounded in his ears.<br />
<br />
<i>Always on the brink of a heart attack<br />
You give me life and keep me comin&#39; back<br />
I see the sunrise in your eyes, your eyes</i><br />
<br />
The thick shaft burrowed inside of Curtis and he whined at the fullness. Nothing compared to this feeling! The total intimate domination from the one person he trusted the most in the world. He gulped and looked up into Ollie&#39;s beautiful yellow eyes as he grasped at his boyfriend&#39;s hips in a needy attempt to pull him further and deeper in.<br />
<br />
<i>Spread my wings and make me fly</i><br />
<br />
Ollie chuckled breathily and continued to push. Curtis was in heaven as he threw his head back. Soon the sheep&#39;s large balls were up against the dog and he was finally able to take a breath. That was, at least, until Ollie withdrew leaving Curtis feeling desperate for the fullness to return. He whined loudly and looked pleadingly up at his sheep, begging him to return and the sheep began to slowly thrust. Curtis saw stars as his entire body tingled, though he barely noticed as fur began to blossom across his skin.<br />
<br />
They became lost together, their breathing ragged in their animalistic passion. Ollie seemed to be just as enraptured with the sensations and they moved as one, grunting and moaning as Curtis continued to pull at Ollie&#39;s hips, spurring him deeper and deeper between the pounding thrusts with a growl.<br />
<br />
Ollie pulled back and held onto Curtis&#39; legs as he pumped with abandon as the dog took the opportunity to jack his own throbbing shaft, now slick with lube and precum. The ram&#39;s horns extended a couple of inches, curling as he bleated, and it was obvious he was getting close. The sight was too much for Curtis, however, as thick ropes of cum shot through the air, the first nearly clearing his head before several others landed on his chest, which was still only sparsely furred. He howled and rode his orgasm past its crest and was more than content to lay, tongue panting, as Ollie quickened his pace before slamming forward and bleating loudly as he filled Curtis with his hot seed.<br />
<br />
They panted together for a moment and Ollie fell forward onto Curtis as they caught their breath. No words would be enough for the moment so they just nuzzled each other and chuckled in their bliss as their hearts beat in their chests.<br />
