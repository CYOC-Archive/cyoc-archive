<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tamthis rose up from his bed (located in a newly magic-formed castle), currently in his male wolven form. He stretched his arms and looked over to his transformed darling Karther, who was sleeping deeply and peacefully. Understandable, considering their actions the night before. Tamthis wills on some clothes from nothing and walks out onto his berch and looked down on the new courtyard. Around the sides were what remained of his sand-wolf crew. In the middle, cowering in fear as they are blocked by the sand-wolves from escaping, were the citizens from a nearby village. Tamthis frowned. He needed more people to start up Karther's original plan, but knew from what he had &quot;inherited&quot; from Karther that too much rulebreaking would result in annihilation that even he could not stop with his power. He had to figure out some way to bypass these rules, but how...?<br />
<br />
He snapped his fingers. Why should HE have to convert everyone? Sure, the rules stated that he, the leader of the fox/wolves, was restricted from transforming people (and by this point he realized that he had already abused his transformation powers far too often), but it said nothing about his subordinates! He grinned maniacally and transformed his balcony into a stairwell down to the courtyard. As he came down, the sand-wolves got kneed down in respect while the villagers ran to the other side of the courtyard. &quot;Ladies and gentleman,&quot; the king of the fox-wolves said in a loud regal tone, &quot;do not be afraid. I am only here to both make my lover's dreams come true as well as make the world a better place. However, I will need some help, and right now I will need your children to do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the ground beneath the villagers moved and snagged any child that was old enough to walk. Before the parents could cry out in anguish, they were quickly dragged to the feet of Tamthis. As they came, Tamthis shifted into her 8-tailed female wolf form in order to not be as intimidating to the children. &quot;Don't worry, this won't hurt a bit.&quot; She waved her right hand at the children, and in a shifting even quicker than when Karther was changed into a female, the children were transformed into wolven beings similar to Tamthis. Their fear had turned into wonder, they examined their new forms, enjoying the new health and power that came with it but unaware at the alterations to their minds. &quot;Now children,&quot; Tamthis gently said, &quot;Let us play a little game. In this game, I would like you to go all around the country and change people into our form. That way, they too can enjoy the things you are having fun with now. In fact....&quot; she pointed to the villagers, &quot;Why not transform them? That way you will be a big happy family again!&quot;<br />
<br />
The wolf-children grinned mischievously (while also having a hint of Tamthis' maniacal smile) and jumped towards their first prey: Their families.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no! Janice, you're doing it all wrong!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if you actually tried doing some of it yourself, maybe we'd get this stuff done faster!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not going to help you. This is part of your training!&quot;<br />
<br />
The reforging of the angelic armor was not going according to Tabra's plan. She was hoping that, since they shared the same body, Janice would pick up on how to forge the armor quickly and thus at the same time improve her own control over the powers of the body they inhabited. That would at least let them work more in sync with each other, but....<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I told you! I am not some friggin angel who would learn stuff like this in five seconds flat!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If we have any chance of properly fusing without going insane, you have to learn how to control these powers yourself! How will you help in battle if anytime you try to do something it will malfunction on you? To avoid that we need to....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah yeah, I get it already! But couldn't you FIX THE ARMOR first and THEN we could train in a different way? This isn't that easy...&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna looked on perplexed as she saw the fox-angel shout at herself again and again. She sighed; that armor was definitely not being improved, and the longer it took, the longer that the fox-bastard would....<br />
<br />
She shook her head. This was no time to think those thoughts. She needed to tend to her sisters, as many of them just wanted to live as normal lives as possible, even if it was as humanoid foxes. Many just wanted to go home, as impossible as that might be currently. She turned around and walked back to her &quot;living quarters...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Luna! Help!&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna dashed towards the cry. Barbera ran towards her in hysterics. &quot;What's going on?!&quot; Luna shouted to the crying fox.<br />
<br />
&quot;There's a man! A man has somehow found us! We've been found by Karther!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Karther?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Before the two vixens could move, they felt a breeze as the fox-angel dashed past them to the source of the panic. They drew out their sword, went into a battle pose, and...<br />
<br />
....stopped as they gaped in shock at the panicking stranger in the middle of the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please stop running around!&quot; the man was shouting, his voice almost as high as the ladies from panic, &quot;I didn't mean any harm! Please don't get scared!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;J....Julio!?&quot; Tabra shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Julio?&quot; Janice shouted inside the fox-angel's head, &quot;Who the heck is Julio?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's you isn't it?&quot; Tabra continued, ignoring Janice. &quot;What...how....?&quot;<br />
<br />
Julio turned towards Tabra. &quot;Ah, so that's your new form is it?&quot; Julio said cheerfully, &quot;Well,  considering how I've only seen you in a human male form, I have to admit this new shape of yours is..... rather unnerving actually. How've ya been 'T'?&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice gaped mentally.<br />
<br />
-------<br />
<br />
A few hours later, everyone had calmed down and had gone back to their regular routines, while Tabra and Julio went back to the area where the angel was forging the armor. &quot;Wow Tabra... you said it's currently &quot;Tabra&quot;, right? Well anyways, you've lived longer than I have so why is it that your forging is so, well, sucky?&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice listened on silently, shocked at how casually and friendly this human was talking to a fox-angel as if they had been friends for years. &quot;I'll explain everything soon,&quot; Tabra said to her mentally&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you can blame the 'other' me in here,&quot; the fox-angel said. She explained what had happened in the castle with Janice, Tammia, Karther and Tamthis' suddenly taking over. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I see, so now you have two people inside there eh?&quot; Julio laughed, &quot;God, so now I have to talk to you as if you had split personalities now? This is too funny!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is not funny!&quot; Tabra shouted, &quot;Do you think I would willingly force someone in the same body as me? This has been just as hard for Janice as it has been for me, if not even harder!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy there T&quot; Julio said, calming down from his laughing, &quot;I was only kidding. You angels never did have any sense of humor.&quot; Janice stifled a mental laugh at the jab. &quot;Anyways, I am surprised at the lack of fusion between your souls. By now there should have been at least a hint of you guys merging but it seems as if you are still two seperate beings in there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I've kinda been an atheist all my life,&quot; Janice said out loud, &quot;I can't really take everything Tabra says for granted, even after... ESPECIALLY after everything that has happened. I mean, he claims he is an angel of God, but where the heck in the bible does it mentions a psycho fox bent on transforming the world to his whim?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, that must be Janice, correct? Nice to finally talk to you and not Tabra. Anyways Janice, I see the problem now. It's a case where you two are just so different in your beliefs its hard to see eye to eye. Well Tabra,&quot; his face became serious, &quot;it seems that I will have to talk to your &quot;co-soul&quot; about the truth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you insane? Humans aren't ready for the....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I can understand the truth about God, then I am quite sure that a lady who has been through as much as Janice and is living in the body of an ACTUAL ANGEL will at least get some of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What truth are you talking about?&quot; Janice asked Julio, &quot;If you are just going to spout how the bible is some all-knowing book then -&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;On the contrary,&quot; Julio interrupted, &quot;While the book has some accurate stories, it WAS written by us faulty humans. There are quite a few stories and events left out. Some of these were covered by other religions and some of them were simply not seen by humans or lost to the stream of time. I have been all around the world trying to understand this truth, and while I haven't gotten a complete grasp about it, I know enough that I can at least help you see eye-to-eye with Tabra....somewhat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, you sound like one of those elderly librarians I had back in school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, compared to you, I guess I AM rather elderly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on! You can't be more than thirty tops!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, I'm over two thousand years old for your information.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...&quot; Janice's mind locked as she heard that information, &quot;Is that true?&quot; She asked Tabra mentally, &quot;So this guy's an angel...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I'm not an angel,&quot; Julio said, guessing what Janice was thinking. &quot;I've had that question asked by enough people that I can guess what you are thinking right now, but no, I'm no angel. I'm human just like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;....I think I need to sit down. My head hurts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julio laughed. &quot;All right then. Let's take a break, and then I'll explain to you about the world, the truth and myself.&quot;</p>
