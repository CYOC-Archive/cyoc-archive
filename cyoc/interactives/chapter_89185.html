<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I wanted you two to meet Randy because we’ve been going steady for a while,” said Kelsey.  “I know you’ve been on my case about not being serious, Samantha.  But this time I am.  Randy is a really sweet guy and we have a lot in common.”<br />
<br />
“Like what?” Samantha asked Kelsey.<br />
<br />
“Skating,” she said.  Samantha laughed.  “I’m serious!  I really do like skating.  But it’s more than that.  We have similar taste in movies and music and a lot of other things, too.”<br />
<br />
“She’s gotten me out of a lot of jams,” said Randy.  <br />
<br />
Samantha folded her arms.  “Do I want to know what kind?  Or how?” she asked.<br />
<br />
“Oh, ew,” said Kelsey.  “Nothing perverted.  Why do you assume the worst?”<br />
<br />
“You know why,” Samantha answered.  “Does he?” she said as she gestured her head towards Randy.<br />
<br />
“Yea, totally,” said Randy.  “We don’t have any secrets between us.  Totally open.”<br />
<br />
Kelsey nodded.  “There is one big secret we have.  Not from each other, but from everyone else.  We’re too afraid to share it with people we know.  But all of a sudden…I think maybe we can share it with you,” she said.  She looked over to Randy.  “Don’t you think so?”<br />
<br />
“Hell yea,” he said.  <br />
<br />
“So what is this big secret?” asked Samantha.<br />
<br />
Kelsey said, “Even with everything that’s happened today, you might find this weird.  But deep down inside, the two of us have always wanted to be both sexes.”<br />
<br />
I practically fell on the floor out of shock.  Samantha just kept looking at them with her mouth agape.  For what seemed an eternity, no one said anything.  Finally Samantha said, “Both sexes?  You want to be hermaphrodites?”<br />
<br />
“Yes,” Kelsey said resolutely.<br />
<br />
“How?” asked Samantha.<br />
<br />
Randy answered her, “We want to look like girls, but have…well, you know.”<br />
<br />
“Cocks?” Samantha yelled.  I was taken aback by her use of the word.  <br />
<br />
“Yea,” said Kelsey.  “And pussies.  We want to be both sexes and we both want to be able to get pregnant”<br />
<br />
I was more than a little surprised.  This was something certainly out there.  Not that everything so far today hadn’t been out there.  “So you have a fantasy that you share that can’t come true?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Well can’t it come true now?” asked Kelsey.  <br />
<br />
I shrugged my shoulders and said, “I suppose…”<br />
<br />
“You’re not seriously thinking about this, are you?” Samantha interrupted me as she punched me in the arm.<br />
<br />
“Why not?” I replied.<br />
<br />
“Because…they’re just kids,” she answered.<br />
<br />
“Excuse me for saying,” said Randy, “but that sounds like, you know, you don’t have a good reason to be upset, man.”<br />
<br />
“He’s got a point,” I said.<br />
<br />
Samantha groaned loudly and muttered to herself.  “Fine,” she said.  “Indulge them, go ahead.  You can figure out the consequences yourself.”<br />
<br />
I was surprised she gave in so quickly.  Usually when it came to things involving Kelsey, she would argue until she was blue in the face.  I thought maybe she was expecting me to suddenly see her point, but I didn’t think she had one.  After all, I didn’t see any reason that one wish couldn’t be undone with another.<br />
<br />
“OK, then,” I said.<br />
<br />
“What?” Samantha exploded at me.  So I had been right after all.<br />
<br />
“Samantha, they’re not kids,” I said.  “And I have a pretty good feeling that any wish I make can be changed later on.  So they can have some fun.”<br />
<br />
Randy stood up and started to shake my hand.  “Oh, dude, that’s excellent,” he said in his stereotypical skater tone of voice.  <br />
<br />
“Yea, yea, OK,” I said.  “Before I do anything, are you both absolutely sure this is what you want?”<br />
<br />
“Most definitely,” said Randy.<br />
<br />
“Absolutely,” agreed Kelsey.<br />
<br />
Randy sat down next to Kelsey again.  “Let’s make this easy,” I said.  “I wish you were both naked.”<br />
<br />
Instantly their clothes vanished.  Kelsey let out a quick shriek and instinctively tried to cover herself with her arms.  Randy didn’t seem to care.  “Where’s your carefree spirit now?” teased Samantha.  “Maybe you forget everyone’s naked now?”<br />
<br />
“Shut up,” Kelsey shot back as she lowered her arms.  <br />
<br />
I said, “Trust me.  It’ll be more comfortable this way.  How big do you want yours?” I asked Kelsey.<br />
<br />
“Oh, well, uh…” she started.  She looked at the size of my cock and of Samantha’s cock and appeared a little intimidated.  Then she glanced over at her boyfriend.  Randy had a fairly normal looking cock that was about half the size of my own enormous manhood.  I thought back to when I sucked Samantha’s cock and remembered I couldn’t fit it all in my mouth.  I thought I could easily fit all of Randy’s cock…and then I realized I was starting to fantasize about Randy.  He wasn’t bad looking at all.  He was a bit scrawny and didn’t have any muscle definition, but he had a nice face and no real physical drawbacks.  I had to quickly stop thinking about him as I realized I was becoming aroused and didn’t want that to be seen.  I glanced over at Samantha and swore that I saw her cock stiffen ever so slightly.  Kelsey finally spoke again, “I guess somewhere in between Randy’s and yours.”<br />
<br />
I took a deep breath.  I wanted to be very careful in my wording to give her exactly what she wanted.  I said, “I wish for Kelsey to grow a cock eight inches in length and testicles, but I wish she would still have her female reproductive organs and her physical appearance would otherwise remain unchanged.”<br />
<br />
Immediately we all looked at Kelsey’s groin.  Something was clearly happening already.  The changes occurred in a slightly different area than Samantha’s.  They were focused just above her pussy.  A new appendage slowly but surely pushed its way out from her body.  It formed the shape of a cock and quickly grew out to a full, thick eight inches.  A scrotum dropped underneath it and two testicles swelled inside of it.  Kelsey’s mouth hung open in amazement at her changes.  Randy just looked intrigued.<br />
<br />
With her new cock fully grown, Kelsey stood up.  She slowly reached to it with her hand.  She gently touched her new organs to see what sensations they produced.  She took a couple sharp breaths when she apparently felt something good.  Her cock began to stiffen as it responded favorably to her touching it.  She removed her hands from it and began to lift it up and down on her own.  “Oh, wow,” she said.  “It’s so incredible.”<br />
<br />
“Wait till you use it,” I said.  I sensed Samantha giving me a bad look, but I didn’t care.  Kelsey looked happy at the thought.<br />
<br />
Kelsey reached back to her new organs but she lifted them up.  Sure enough, her pussy was still there.  “Oh, wild,” she said.  “I’ve got both parts, just like I wanted!”<br />
<br />
“That’s too sweet,” said Randy.<br />
<br />
“Your turn,” I said to him.</p>
