<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You felt relieved that you were back to normal, or well what you thought was normal. Even after looking at your new abnormal body that was a glitch in the app you couldn&#39;t shake the thought of believing in a world where you had frog legs. You still had memories of the times playing in the pond, leaping onto two story buildings like it was nothing, and even reaching high places that you couldn&#39;t otherwise. It was a life that never was which made your hearts feel a bit heavy pumping more rapidly than normal. Your memories began to feel distant as you began to be more prideful of being yourself. Of course you were an unusual creature being the only hermaphrodite spidertaur in existence, however you never felt out of place. Never once did you question your own existence of being born of human parents or spinning your own webs at four or needing four bras for eight breasts when your mom only needed one or the fact that you were the only person you knew of to eat insects. Other than your huge spider body that took up lots of space and being eight feet tall, you were treated like anyone else, even getting discounts because of your body portions as well as people accepting your preferred pronouns which are they/them. Not everyone could tell, especially seeing your breasts and penis out, it was always amusing to you seeing them not want to misgender you. Even if they were wrong, you tried to assure them that you were perfectly understanding. You were very popular in school because of your unique appearence. Because of all that, never once did you feel ashamed of having a body of a giant spider with two sexes and wondering if it was better being like everyone else, you were happy being you. Though there were still people that treated you like shit, like the hippo who told you to feed the birds. Then again you <br />
probably need to get back to doing your duties, which was a wonderful opportunity to go check out your newest conversion.<br />
<br />
You placed your phone back into your trusty fanny pack which was wrapped around your human waist and just above your exposed penis. The conversions will continue after you did your job. You picked up the bucket full of bird seed and walked over to the bird and the woman. You didn&#39;t pay attention to your new body parts as you walked like you have all your life which would be weird if anyone weren&#39;t used to it. You had 24 years practice of course. After a minute you came back to the avian section greeting you with plenty of squacks and chirps from all around. You made your way being careful not to trip or run into people as they spend time looking at the birds. Having big, long legs that were half the width of your human wrists, you had to watch out constantly of your surroundings. With many awkward missteps, you couldn&#39;t look back without wincing at some terrible accidents, of course none harmful, just pain in your mind. Though you were more worried for kids which you&#39;ve noted most any of them wouldn&#39;t be too afraid to climb your long hairy legs which you noticed way back in primary school. With much caution you came back to the parrot cages. There still in the front was the boob lady and her bird. They took notice of the bucket of seeds you were holding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh look Perky, Penny brought some food for you.&quot; The woman in the boob said looking up at her bird friend. &quot;It&#39;s about time you came, Perky was about to have one of his moods!&quot; She playfully shouted at you with Perky squacking back in agreement. You came up to their cage and plucked a hand full of seeds and threw them into the cage. Perky leaped to the ground real quick where he started pecking the seeds, as the other birds with normal human breasts bobbing around followed suit. You looked at them finding the birds all bunched together eating their meal. You threw as few more handfuls in and eventually the seeds were all gone. Perky went back to his branch in front and squacked back to you with great thanks.<br />
<br />
&quot;You greedy bird, you&#39;re always the first to go and the last to leave.&quot; You say to Perky who was plucking his feathers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Penny. I shouldn&#39;t say this, but Perky told me that you&#39;re his favorite.&quot; The boob spoke out before the bird could interrupt her. Penny chuckled at their small debacle. &quot;Why thanks, I like you too Perky.&quot;<br />
<br />
You put out your index finger and put it through a hole in the cage beckoning for Perky to accept your thankfulness. He stopped squacking and began to gently nuzzle you outstretched finger. You started to pet his little head and he calmed down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Penny. I hate it when he gets angry at me, but I still love him anyway. I&#39;m glad someone like you can help settle him down. I too have to say you&#39;re my favorite zookeeper. We were born here and we&#39;ve seen many come and go, but I knew when I first saw you that you&#39;d be something special.&quot; You withdrew your finger and thanked BOOBara, which you now realized was the bird&#39;s boob&#39;s name. You was the only one who knew the truth about who she actually was, though you didn&#39;t feel any guilt since it seemed pretty normal to her. Even though you knew the truth you seemed to feel more forward thinking, like as if you had interacted to them before. It seems the world makes you know what to do, feel or say as if you would&#39;ve done without knowing of the conversion.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad I know I&#39;m loved even though HIPPOlly hates me for some reason.&quot; You admit. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t let that bother you, she hates everyone, even me, Perky and every animal in the zoo.&quot; BOOBara gave you a stern look. &quot;If she had her way she wouldn&#39;t be working here. Me and Perky hate her too, but you don&#39;t have a choice. We&#39;ve seen many people like her and we just deal with it because of people like you Penny. People like you make more joyful being here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks BOOBara. That&#39;s actually great advice.&quot; You said being gracious of her kindness again even though you were also thanking a bird&#39;s breast who was talking to you, but not disbelieving that you weren&#39;t also a freak of nature. You were fondling your fanny pack and thought of using it on them, but for something more lovely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I want to get a picture of you two.&quot; You said opening up your fanny pack and grabbing your phone out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you have enough pictures of us?&quot; She says a bit agitated. Sure enough the pictures that you took of Perky specifically had been modified to also include BOOBara which was just as cute as she was now.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t have enough pictures of you guys.&quot; You hold up the phone bringing up the app.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey wait a minute! Do I have any milk on my face?&quot; Which she always did, which after every bird bath, she would still manage to leak milk which usually dried. Though she never noticed. That was weird that you knew that.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fine you&#39;re not that bad.&quot; You promised her. &quot;Alright ready?&quot; You asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine. We&#39;re ready.&quot; BOOBara huffed. She started to smile and you then produced a sentence. After you quickly took a picture before she asked if they&#39;re done. They looked perfect.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright done. Wanna see?&quot; Which she accepted. She hated the picture of her and was jealous of Perky&#39;s other breast which she found herself comparing to a lot. Then you said Perky looked handsome. Perky seemed to look bashful. You excused yourself where you would continue your zookeeper duties by feeding the other animals and such. As you walked away from the cage you looked back at the app and what sentence it generated. It said &quot;The bird and his breast are happy inside their cage.&quot; Lots of opportunities with this sentence, but what could be a nice change for them?</p>
