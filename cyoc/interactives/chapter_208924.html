<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Ugh what the hell kid,&quot; Rick groaned. As the Senior now tried to stand, he could see the Freshman now step in front of the Soul Drive.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stay down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick grunted, finding himself flattened to the floor. It felt like their was a lineman sitting in his chest. Try as he might, he couldn&#39;t stand. Frowning he now glanced up at the younger boy, finding his calm talk and demeanor unnerving. &quot;Who the hell are you kid?&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren said nothing, impressed with his own abilities. He had successfully cast a spell to keep the older and larger teen at bay. Quickly he now glanced at Hannah, the monkey Soul Drive at a loss for words. &quot;Hannah you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Hannah said softly, still stunned she had almost been attacked. &quot;Yeah I&#39;m fine. Who is this guy and how did you get here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No idea,&quot; Darren shrugged. &quot;But I know he was trying to change you.&quot; Hannah shuddered at the statement before glowering at Rick. A string of profanities now left the Soul Drives mouth as she began to berate Rick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shut up you damn Arty,&quot; Rick groaned. <br />
<br />
&quot;Quiet,&quot; Darren said firmly. Rick now tried to respond, his eyes going wide in shock as no words left his mouth. How was this kid doing that?<br />
<br />
&quot;Hannah get the others,&quot; Darren said quickly. &quot;We need to take this guy to Ms. Yuriko. Maybe she can help us find a way to stop him.&quot; Rick now watched nervously as Hannah sped off, the senior nervously looking at Darren as the freshman narrowed his eyes. What was this kid going to do?<br />
<br />
Rick groaned, his eyes blurry as they tried to focus. Somehow he had fallen unconscious. As his eyes now took in his surroundings, he gasped in fright as he beheld two large fox men glaring at him. Rick tried to scream, no sound escaping his lips. He recognized these two, the one with nine tails had attacked him this past summer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that,&quot; Akira whispered, before being shushed by Fukushu. The nine tailed kitsune recognized the teen as well.  Slowly he now leaned close to Rick as he whispered in his ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you say that we know eachother child know I will end you,&quot; he threatened. &quot;No one needs to know of our encounter. Answer the questions put to you and you may make it out of this alive. Failure to do so and I will take great pleasure in killing you slowly. You have no friends here boy and you most certainly will not be missed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick nodded, the teen nervously looking between the two kitsune. He had little doubt this guy wouldn&#39;t follow through on his threat. Anxiously he now looked around the room, realizing someone had tied him to a chair. As he studied his surroundings he was certainly puzzled by what he saw.<br />
<br />
He was in a living room. Rick noticing old photos decorating the mantle and walls of the room. Memories filtered into his head of his own grandmother. The place certainly seemed to have an elderly taste. Old photos, antiques, even an old time candy dish with candy only the elderly would find enjoyable. Rick now wondered what he was doing in some random grandma&#39;s living room. Was this whole operation run by some old lady?<br />
<br />
&quot;This him?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick now watched as the young teen that had stopped him entered the room with an elderly Asian woman. He had been right about this being an old womans house but she certainly didn&#39;t look like she was related to this kid. The woman looked Japanese while the teen was definitely white. Rick now watched as the elderly woman approached, the two kitsune parting like the Red Sea to let her pass.<br />
<br />
Yuriko now held up her hand, a bemused smile cracking across her wrinkled face. You cast a silencing spell on him,&quot; she smiled. &quot;Nicely done.&quot; Rick watched as the teen blushed, offeringa meek thank you as the elderly woman closed her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Fukushu asked. &quot;Is this the one Morgan has taken as an apprentice?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is,&quot; Yuriko replied. The elderly wizard now leaning closer, looking over Ricks bonds before staring the older teen in the eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am going to have my apprentice lift the silencing spell,&quot; she said. &quot;However, if you try to act I will silence you myself. I can tell that Morgan has given you a Ring if Change but you powers pale in comparison to mine. Any tricks and you will find yourself in serious trouble. Is that understood?&quot; Rick nodded, despite the sour look on his face he needed to maintain his composure. With a wave of her hand, Rick let out a gasp as if he were coming up for air. He could tell that he could speak once again. &quot;Thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now,&quot; Yuriko stated, her eyes narrowing as she looked him over. &quot;Tell me your name and how you know Morgan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rick,&quot; he stated. &quot;And that lady you call Morgan came to me a few weeks ago. Said this ring on my finger could change stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yuriko nodded, rubbing her chin as she gazed at Rick. &quot;Tell me Nick,&quot; she asked. &quot;Why have you been transforming Soul Drives?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Those fucking Artys ain&#39;t normal,&quot; he spat. As the words left his mouth, he could see the younger teen and Hannah both scowl at him. Rick saw this as a badge of honor, especially after seeing a second Soul Drive move behind the two teens. This second Soul Drive appeared to be a wolf model. She, unlike Hannah, appeared frightened of Rick. For her Rick was a boogeyman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Language,&quot; Yuriko said softly. &quot;We don&#39;t speak like that in my home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look lady I don&#39;t know what you want,&quot; Rick spat. &quot;Let me go okay. You want the Soul Drives left alone fine but you holding me here is only going to bring the cops. You really want to spend your last few years rotting in jail?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Insolent bastatd,&quot; Fukushu growled. The kitsune now withdrew his sword, pressing it firmly against Ricks throat. &quot;That woman is the only reason you still draw breath. If it were my choice I would have gutted you like a pig.&quot; Rick whimpered, feeling the cold steel press against his throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not killing the boy Fukushu,&quot; Yuriko said firmly. &quot;Morgan is most likely manipulating him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All the more reason to kill him and be done with it Yuriko,&quot; Fukushu countered. &quot;That has always been your weakness. Believing you can redeem your enemies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fukushu,&quot; Akira stated. &quot;I have told you before that we air on the side of caution. Especially with mortals. Besides, if we had followed your reasoning would you be standing here today?&quot; Fukushu paused, sighing in acceptance. Rick now felt the pressure of the blade lessen against his throat. &quot;Point taken my old apprentice,&quot; he sighed. &quot;However this boy has already interfered in the Catalysts work. How do you propose turning him against Morgan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t even know what a Catalyst is,&quot; Rick exclaimed. &quot;All I know is that Morgan lady has been teaching me to use this ring.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll have to excuse my apprentice Yuriko. I haven&#39;t had a chance to teach him on the history of magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren, Yuriko, and the others now shuddered at the voice. Slowly all now turned towards the front door.  Standing in the door may, Darren could see Morgan, the raven haired Lycan sorceress sporting a serene smile upon her face as she gazed at the group.<br />
<br />
&quot;It appears your wards of protection prevent me from entering your home,&quot; she answered, a sad look forming on her face. &quot;Do you truly see me as your enemy Yuriko after all we have been through.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are not the same Morgan Carlson,&quot; Yuriko replied. &quot;You&#39;ve let a darkness fall over you. You wishing to harm Darren prevents you from entering.&quot; Morgan sighed, nodding her head before giving a venomous stare to everyone in Yurikos living room.<br />
<br />
&quot;You do realize though that of any harm comes to my apprentice than no wards will be able to stop me,&quot; she sated, her voice animalistic in its tone. &quot;Mind you I do hope someone is foolish enough to do that. I&#39;d love nothing more than to tear Darren and Fukushu to pieces for what they&#39;ve done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Than it appears we&#39;re at an impasse Morgan,&quot; Yuriko replied. &quot;Perhaps its time we talked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps it is Yuriko,&quot; Morgan replied. &quot;Say your peace than release my apprentice. I doubt our differences can be hashed out this day.&quot;</p>
