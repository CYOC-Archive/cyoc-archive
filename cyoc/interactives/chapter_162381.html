<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ashley could barely contain herself as she trailed behind Claudia. &quot;I cant believe Mika is actually working on an actual fashion show,&quot; she exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Part of her internship,&quot; Claudia smirked. &quot;Personally I&#39;m surprised you wanted to come.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley raised an eyebrow, giving Claudia a critical look. &quot;If I didnt pretty sure the girls would of kicked me out if the house.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claudia chuckled softly as the two young women made their way. This wasnt the first show Claudia had attended, but it would most likely be the last one she would go to while they were in college. The girls would be graduating in the spring and considering Mika already had a job waiting for her with her aunt, Claudia realized she probably wouldnt be seeing New York again anytime soon. <br />
<br />
Showing their VIP pass, Claudia and Ashley filtered into the back. As always it was a jumble of activity. Models and designers were scrambling, making last minute adjustments before the show started. Scanning the crowd, Claudia smiled and waved as she saw her fiance finish dressing one of the models. <br />
<br />
&quot;Claud,&quot; Mika smiled, putting the finishing touches on one of the models outfits. &quot;Great to see you and I see Ashley made it too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldnt of missed it,&quot; Claudia smiled, placing a gentle kiss on Mikas cheek. As the trio began to chat, they found themselves interrupted by a leggy and gorgeous model Claudia had never seen before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mika will you hurry up,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I need you to put the finishing touches on my outfit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a sec Marissa,&quot; Mika stated. &quot;Want to introduce you to Claudia and Ashley.&quot; The leggy raven haired woman narrowed her eyes as she leaned down to look Claudia in the eyes. &quot;Ugh what is with that outfit,&quot; she groaned. &quot;And why are you back here?  Can&#39;t you see we&#39;re busy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mika and Ashley are friends of mine Marissa,&quot; Mika sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever,&quot; Marissa sighed, rolling her eyes. &quot;Just finish saying hi to the midget  with bad fashion sense. Some of us have jobs to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Marissa spun back haughtily, Claudia couldnt help but glare at her. &quot;Cunt,&quot; she grumbled, perhaps a bit louder than she anticipated as Marissa spun back around. &quot;What did you say!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mika and Ashley buried their faces in their hands as the model now stomped towards her. They both knew what was coming.<br />
<br />
&quot;I said you&#39;re a cunt,&quot; Ckaudia exclaimed. &quot;What? You couldnt hear me up there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who the hell do you think you are skank,&quot; Marissa spat, not noticing Claudia&#39;s necklace beginning to glow softly. <br />
<br />
Claudia just smirked watching her magic do its work. Marissa was now growing smaller, the formerly form fitting dress now beginning to sag on her. Claudia had dimmed her awareness so she wouldnt notice the loss of height. As Marissa continued to berate the smaller woman she failed to notice her bustline riding lower, it that she no longer needed to lean over quite as much.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bitch I make six figures a year as a model,&quot; Marissa exclaimed. &quot;Just who in the hell do you....EEP!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Claudia couldnt help but smile as Marissas dress fell away from her much smaller breasts. Claudia had shrank the woman at least a foot in height leaving her five feet tall exactly. The models hands now flew to her nude breasts, trying to cover her nipples that stood stiff in the slightly chilly backstage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Didnt quite catch that,&quot; Claudia smirked. &quot;Not with your tits hanging out.&quot; Marissa simply stammered, blushing crimson as she now bolted away from the scene, stumbling in her overly large heels. &quot;Damn it Claudia,&quot; Mika whispered. &quot;Can you not shrink the models I&#39;ve got work to do!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She started it,&quot; Claudia grumbled as she now restored Marissas statuesque physique. Marissa now tried adjusting her clothes, wondering how her skin tight dress could have possibly slipped.<br />
<br />
After Claudia&#39;s little outburst the trio settled down to watch. Mika may have been busy but Claudia and Ashley could enjoy the show. As Ashley watched, hemming and hawing at the outfits, Claudia had made her way towards catering grabbing a drink and something to eat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cant believe your enjoying this Ash,&quot; Claudia sighed. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s not to love,&quot; Ashley said excitedly. &quot;Were at an actual New York fashion show.&quot; Claudia could only shrug, she may love Mika but she could really care less about fashion.<br />
<br />
***************************<br />
<br />
Abolith narrowed her eyes as she gazed out at the show from her position in the rafters. They had remained hidden from view as they scanned the crowd. She knew that as soon as she struck, panic would ensue. She had studied the wizards and the crowd, biding her time as she waited for the wizards to be separated. Noticing the distance between the three she now motioned for the Voids to attack.<br />
<br />
Claudia had made her way backstage after Ashley had gone to the front of the runway. She hoped this would be over soon, she wanted sometime with Mika before they picked up Kari from her dad. The sound of screaming and an explosion jolted Claudia from her musings as she now raced towards the front.<br />
<br />
Peaking out Ckaudia gasped. Models and fans were fleeing in terror as a large group of Voids now began attacking anything that moved. Lookingvtiwards the front of the runway she could see Ashley fighting a group of Voids. While she was okay for now if Claudia didnt step in her friend would be overwhelmed. Concentrating she released a blast of fire, knocking one of the attacking Voids away much to Ashley&#39;s relief.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mika,&quot; Claudia called as models ran past. On the run again, Claudia frantically scanned the show looking for her fiance. <br />
<br />
Mika found herself confronted now by a pair of Voids. She had safely gotten most of the staff out and now found herself fighting the Voids. Summoning her watery chains she ensnared one of the Voids around the neck, tossing it through a nearby wall. Taking a deep breath she now looked for other attackers, noticing a masked woman dressed in blue exit the shadows. &quot;Who are you,&quot; Mika asked.<br />
<br />
Claudia sprinted towards the back, growing nervous as she searched for Mika. Flying around the corner she gasped as Mika crashed to the ground in front of her. &quot;Mika,&quot; she yelled. Checking on her fiance she could see Mika was alive, a deep slash across her chest. &quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; she winced as she puahed herself into a sitting position pointing at her attacker.<br />
<br />
Claudia growled, spinning to face her opponent as she launched a ball of flame at the masked woman in blue. Abolith saw the attack, deftly cleaving the ball in half with her mystical blade.<br />
<br />
&quot;You must be Claudia and Mika,&quot; Abolith said softly. <br />
<br />
&quot;And who would you be,&quot; Claudia asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Abolith,&quot; she said. &quot;A creature your superior in every way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claudia smirked, focusing her magic into a blade of solid flames. &quot;Bitch,&quot; she grinned. &quot;Your about to find out how dead wrong you are.&quot; With a yell Claudia used her magic to propel herself forward, bringing her flame sword down with explosive force. Abolith flipped out of the way, her eyes narrowing as she gazed intently at the fire mage in front of her as Claudia now launched herself into a furious attack.</p>
