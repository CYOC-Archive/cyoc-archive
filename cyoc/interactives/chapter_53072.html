<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before Kathryn could go anywhere though she saw a car drive past and someone shoot a man that was walking on the sidewalk. Unfortunately this startled her so much that she froze for a moment during which the car sped out of sight. Cursing her lack of action she went out to check on the man. She found that he was still alive but just barely. She waved her hand at him saying a quick incantation and he started to float. She moved him into her house and set him down on a table. She quickly stripped him using another incantation and gathered several ingredients together. Fortunately the healing potion didn't take long to prepare. She just hoped that it would be enough to save him. In her haste though she got the ingredients mixed up and wrong and a drop of her own blood from a cut she didn't even notice fell into the potion making it a different potion. The potion was ready in just a few minutes and she poured it over the man who by some miracle was still alive even with all the bullet wounds he had. Whoever had done this was either a bad shot or cruel since there were wounds in his arms and legs as well as his torso.<br />
<br />
Kathryn waited with baited breath for the potion to work. At first she thought she had been too late but then one bullet was forced out of the man's leg and the wound healed. Soon the other bullets rose to the surface being forced out by the healing wounds. Kathryn let out a sigh of relief that the man would live. However that relief was short lived as the man began to change. First almost all his body hair and the stubble on his face retracted into his body leaving him mostly hairless. He had a little pubic hair left but it wasn't much. Next his dick, balls, and ball sack shrank down until there was nothing left of them. His Adam's Apple shrank until it too was gone. By this time Kathryn was worried that she had accidentally turned him into a golem. It wasn't her intention to do that as golems were bound to their creator. Anything that happened to a golem she created she would feel.<br />
<br />
Kathryn didn't need to worry about the man being a golem however as the changes continued. He grew shorter until he was about 4'6&quot;. His body slimmed down just a bit leaving his body looking like a little girl's. His brown hair grew out becoming longer until it was about mid back and changed to the same shade of brown as Kathryn's. His face shifted until it was like Kathryn was looking at a younger version of herself with some minor differences. His areolas and nipples were next to change becoming larger and raising up a bit. The last thing to change was the area between his legs puffed up a bit and then split forming a girl's slit.<br />
<br />
Kathryn groaned and sat down with a hand to her face. She had just changed a grown man into a girl who looked about ten when all she wanted to do was heal him. &quot;Mom's going to kill me,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now why would I do that?&quot; Kathryn's mom said from behind her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom,&quot; Kathryn said as she jumped up and turned around to face her mom. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I figured I'd drop in and see your new home,&quot; Kathryn's mom said. &quot;Now tell me why I would kill you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I changed an adult man into a ten year old girl,&quot; Kathryn said.<br />
<br />
Kathryn's mom went to the table to look at the girl laying there and said, &quot;You did a good job too though you didn't have to make her look so much like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't understand Mom,&quot; Kathryn said cringing a bit. &quot;I wasn't trying to make him into a girl. I was just trying to heal him after he was shot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kathryn's mom looked around and saw the ingredients Kathryn had used. She went over and examined them then said, &quot;It's plain to see that you were in a hurry. It's an understandable mistake and you did heal her. Though she shouldn't look like you unless...&quot; She went over and picked up the bowl Kathryn had mixed the potion in and sniffed it. &quot;Just as I thought,&quot; she said after a few moments. &quot;You mixed a drop of your blood into it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't though,&quot; Kathryn said her eyes going wide.<br />
<br />
&quot;I smell your blood in here,&quot; Kathryn's mom said. &quot;You must have gotten a drop in and not noticed it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What does this mean?&quot; Kathryn asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You now have a daughter,&quot; Kathryn's mom said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But... but I can't have a daughter,&quot; Kathryn said her eyes getting big. &quot;I'm just twenty-one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be difficult to explain,&quot; Kathryn's mom said. She seemed to think for a bit then said, &quot;When you were eleven you were raped and since you had already started getting your periods you got pregnant. Instead of getting an abortion you decided to have the baby. You had to deliver your daughter via c-section. I've helped you take care of her. As for the man who raped you he hasn't been seen since. That will be the story to explain why you have a daughter that's ten while you're twenty-one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kathryn sighed and looked at the girl on the table. She was awake and had evidently been listening. Now she asked, &quot;What you talking about?&quot; She evidently heard her voice and grasped her throat then looked down at her body. &quot;What happened to me?&quot; she asked panic creeping into her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down,&quot; Kathryn's mom said in a soothing voice. &quot;My daughter saved your life though she was in such a hurry to do so that she accidentally made you her daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well change me back,&quot; the girl said putting as much authority in her voice as she could.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can't,&quot; Kathryn's mom said sighing. &quot;You see some of her blood got into the potion. When she poured the potion on you the blood combined with your body changing you at a fundamental level. In essence who you were is dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I'm stuck like this?&quot; the girl asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm afraid that you are,&quot; Kathryn's mom said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; Kathryn said then broke down and cried.<br />
<br />
Kathryn's mom went and hugged her and so did the girl. &quot;It was an accident that you made me your daughter right?&quot; the girl asked. After Kathryn nodded she continued, &quot;Then please don't cry. It was an accident. I'll just have to learn to live like this. Who knows? It might not be so bad and I might like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me guess,&quot; Kathryn's mom said. &quot;You've felt that you should have been born a girl in your old life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... yes,&quot; the girl said blushing a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why did you want to be turned back?&quot; Kathryn asked in a shocked tone done crying for now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I was used to being me,&quot; the girl said. &quot;I guess it was only natural that I would want to be changed back. Especially when I wasn't given the choice. Not that I'm blaming you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you're not mad at me?&quot; Kathryn asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; the girl said. &quot;You're mother said that I can't be changed back so there's no point in being mad. Besides you did save my life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll call me Grandma Agnes,&quot; Kathryn's mom said looking right at the girl. &quot;I'll also need to know what to call my newest granddaughter. What are you going to name her Kathryn?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kathryn thought for awhile then said, &quot;I think I'll name you Andromeda Star. We'll just call you Star most of the time though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds like a good name,&quot; Agnes said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then it's settled,&quot; Kathryn said with a nod. &quot;You are Andromeda Star. Welcome to the family Star.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know you'll have to teach Star about being a witch,&quot; Agnes said. &quot;She has a lot of catching up to do. First though lets get some clothes on her.&quot; With and incantation and a wave of her hand she made white panties, a white little girl's bra, a white dress, white socks, and black Mary Janes appear on Star.<br />
<br />
Star looked at herself and ran her hands over her new clothes. &quot;These are more comfortable than I thought they would be. But why do I have a bra on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have some breast buds,&quot; Agnes said. &quot;The bra will help to keep them from being irritated.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Star said. &quot;I guess I have a lot to learn about being a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And a witch,&quot; Kathryn said hugging her daughter. &quot;Will you help me catch her up Mom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I will,&quot; Agnes said. &quot;We'll have to arrange a family get together so we can introduce Star to them. You'll love your cousins. They're about the same age as you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When can I meet them?&quot; Star asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;As soon as it's arranged,&quot; Agnes said. &quot;First though we need to get the documentation for you sorted out. Dr. Thomas can arrange for a birth certificate and give Kathryn a c-section scar. Harold should be able to provide school papers. As for other documentation I'll have to see who I can ask. After all that's taken care of your mother will need to enroll you in school here. You'll need to get a job Kathryn.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I'll get a teaching job,&quot; Kathryn said with a grin. &quot;It would be fun to play with the mortals.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember to cast memory charms,&quot; Agnes said. &quot;You don't want to be burned at the stake like my cousin Trinity was. Even though she didn't have much power and most wouldn't have considered her a witch.&quot; Her voice had taken on a menacing tone by the end and one could only guess what she would have done to the mortals had she been old enough to use her magic then.<br />
<br />
Kathryn shuddered and said, &quot;I really don't want to end up like that. To be stripped naked and tied to the stake with a rope around my neck just about choking me. Then having to endure the fire slowly moving up the pyre until it reached me and then have it slowly move up my body. To endure that for over two hours I couldn't handle it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Star had gone pale at the description and she shuddered too. &quot;Then don't forget,&quot; Agnes said. &quot;If the modern witch hunters burn you at the stake they'll likely burn Star too.&quot;<br />
<br />
No one seemed to like that idea. &quot;Should we go out?&quot; Kathryn asked. &quot;I need to take my mind off that now.&quot;</p>
