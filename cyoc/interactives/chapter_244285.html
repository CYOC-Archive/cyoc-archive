<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">None of the kids raise their hands, Rick looks at each of them before his eyes settle on Max in his Malinois “costume”, unaware that the costume is in reality Max’s 16-year-old brother Jeff.<br />
<br />
A grin appears on Rick’s face, “say, Max,” he says, “I really do like your costume, it looks like the real thing. It looks like a German Shepherd, however the fur looks much shorter, why is that so?”<br />
<br />
“Well, it’s supposed to represent a Belgian Shepherd known as a Malinois,” Max says.<br />
<br />
Rick walks around Max, “it looks pretty tight fitting,” the 13-year-old says, grinning, “I doubt you are wearing any kind of clothes underneath, hm?”<br />
<br />
“I… I… um… well… no, I am not,” Max stammers, feeling a little embarassed.<br />
<br />
Rick pats Max, who is a head shorter than the 13-year-old, “there, there, no need to feel embarrassed, Max,” he says.<br />
<br />
Max is taken by surprise when Rick pats his head, for some reason it feels kind of good, the 10-year-old looks up at the taller boy.<br />
<br />
Rick smiles at the boy in a dog costume, “you know, Max,” he says, “you look darn cute in that costume. Tell me, why have you decided to dress up as a Malinois?”<br />
<br />
“Be-because… I dunno…,” Max says, “I… I guess I just like dogs… and… well… this is so embarrassing… I kinda always wondered what… what it would be like… being a dog”.<br />
<br />
Rick grins, “well… why don’t you simply act like a dog,” he asks, “I mean, you already have the appearance of a dog, all you’d need to do is act like one and no one would assume you are a human wearing a costume”.<br />
<br />
“B-but… if I’d do that,” Max says, sounding nervous, “y-you’d have more… reason to… bully and be mean to me”.<br />
<br />
Rick shakes his head, “I promise, Max,” he says, “I’ll not bully or be mean to you. To be honest, the more I look at you in that costume, the more I wish you were MY dog. I promise… I’d take good care of you, train you to be the best guard dog in the world and I’d treat you with all the respect and love you deserve”.<br />
<br />
“B-but… I couldn’t be your dog,” Max says, “I mean… what would my family say?”<br />
<br />
Rick grins, “it would be our little secret,” he says, “you will act as your normal self most of the time, but when I want my “dog”, you’d just put on that costume and be my dog until I send you back home. You could come and spend the weekends or holidays with me and be a dog until you have to return home”.<br />
<br />
Max is silent for a while, “y-you know, Rick,” he then says, “th-that does sound… nice”.<br />
<br />
Rick smiles wide, “so, do you accept becoming my dog?”<br />
<br />
Max slowly nods his head, “well… I don’t want to fully commit myself to the role,” he says, “but… I’d be willing to give it a try at least”.<br />
<br />
Rick smiles, “works fine with me,” he says, “but what if you enjoy it?”<br />
<br />
“Then… then I’d most likely would commit to my role as your dog fully,” Max says.<br />
<br />
“Sounds good to me,” Rick says, “but we’d need to make some adjustments, so it’ll be easier for you to play the part”.<br />
<br />
“L-like what,” Max asks.<br />
<br />
“First, we’ll make the costume much more realistic,” Rick says, “starting with a sheath and ball sack which house your human genitals, your human penis will simply slide out of the sheath whenever you get an erection. You will also be able to pee from the sheath, as for “number two”, a hole will appear in the costume, which will be perfectly in line with your butt hole, allowing you to poop without any issues”.<br />
<br />
Max gasps when he feels the changes happen,  Jeff shouts, but Max just ignores it.<br />
<br />
Rick smiles, “better,” he says, “now, the tail of costume has sensors built in, which are synced to your brain, whenever you’re happy, the tail will wag!”<br />
<br />
Max then feels a tingling in his mind and his eyes widen when he is suddenly aware of the costume’s tail, making it feel as though its attached to his real body, “w-whoa, I can actually “feel” the tail, as if it’s really a part of my body,” the 10-year-old exclaims.<br />
<br />
Rick grins, “that is the point,” he says, “you might feel something… “missing” whenever you are not wearing the costume, and a longing for having a tail, so you might not want to take the costume off. However you HAVE to in order to go to school, just remind yourself that, whenever you are at home, or with me, you can immediately put the costume on and be your TRUE SELF!”<br />
<br />
Max feels his tail move between his legs at the thought of having to take off the costume, but when he is aware that he is able to wear the costume whenever he is alone or with Rick, he feels extremely happy and his “tail” starts to wag,  “whoa… it… it really works,” he says, “this… this is so cool!”<br />
<br />
Rick grins, “we aren’t done yet, Max,” he says, “now, dogs don’t talk, they bark, growl, yip, whine, whimper and pant to express their emotions,” he then says, “so, I want you to give your best impression of a bark and continue to bark, as you do so, your vocal cords will adjust to make it sound accurate, but you will keep your ability to speak like a human. Start barking… now!”<br />
<br />
Max does as told and each time he lets out a bark, the bark slowly begins to sound less and less like a human TRYING to bark like a dog and start to sound like the real thing.<br />
<br />
“Perfect,” Rick says, “now try a growl, let’s see how that sounds”.<br />
<br />
Max lets out a accurate growl, his eyes widen, “w-whoa… that sounded so real!”<br />
<br />
Rick chuckles, “and pretty intimidating,” he says, “hehe… no one will dare mess with you, Max!”<br />
<br />
Max, when hearing this, can’t help but grin under the head of the “costume”, “this is so darn cool,” he says.<br />
<br />
Rick chuckles, “well, let’s continue,” he says, “this will be the most… fun,” the 13-year-old smirks, “dogs do not stand or walk on two legs, they walk on all fours, so… get down onto your hands, as you do so, your arms and legs will become the same length to make it easier and moe comfortable for you to walk on all fours”.<br />
<br />
Without really thinking, Max does as told and lowers himself onto his hands, his feet stay flat on the ground as his legs shrink.<br />
<br />
Rick smiles down at the “Malinois”, “good boy,” he says, then chuckles when he watches Max’s “tail” wag, “now, your body is flexible enough to allow you to use your hind legs to scratch behind your ears and… hehe… clean yourself”.<br />
<br />
Max shivers as a tingling runs through his body.<br />
<br />
Rick smiles, “now, your sense of smell and your hearing will increase to that of a dog’s,” he then says.<br />
<br />
Max senses are suddenly bombarded by scents and noises he hadn’t noticed before.<br />
<br />
Rick grins, “now, one final adjustment,” he says, rubbing his hands, “normally, you’d be an eight month old pup, since you’re 10. However, since you are not trained yet and since I have just gotten you, I think you should look more like an eight WEEK old puppy, so your body will shrink down to the accurate size while staying human under the costume. The costume will adjust to your new size and no one will question why you are such a tiny human. Hehe! You will grow like a normal dog, until you have reached the normal size of a full grown Malinois, which will be when you reach the mental age of 12 months, however your lifespan will remain that of a human and the costume will automatically adjust as you “grow up” and even “age” with you until it looks exactly like and adult Malinois”.<br />
<br />
Rick watches as Max shrinks, until a little Malinois puppy is standing before him, he then kneels down, stretching out his arms, “Max, come here and show your master how much you love him!”<br />
<br />
Max finds himself letting out a happy bark, his tail wagging as he jumps into Rick’s arms and begins licking the 13-year-old’s face, causing Rick to laugh.<br />
<br />
Rick strokes his “dog’s” body, holding him close, “haha… such a good boy you are, Max. You look so real, no one will ever guess that you are just a tiny human wearing a costume, haha… everyone will think you are a normal pup,” he says. The 13-year-old grins at the “dog”, “once we are done here, we’ll head to the vets, you need to get chipped and vaccinated”.<br />
<br />
Max lets out a whimper, his tail moves between his legs.<br />
<br />
“Aaaw… don’t worry, it won’t be so bad,” Rick says, scratching behind one of Max’s “ears”, “I promise to reward you with something special, but you have to be a good boy, okay?”<br />
<br />
Max lets out a bark and wags his tail.<br />
<br />
Rick chuckles, &quot;good boy, oh, I just remembered: the ears of the costume, like the tail, have sensors which are synced to your brain. This will allow you to &quot;feel&quot; the ears, as if they were your real ears, just like you are able to feel the tail. Whenever someone scratches your &quot;ears&quot; you will immediatly slip into a relaxed state,&quot; the teen smirks when he feels the tiny &quot;pup&quot; shiver as the command takes affect. Rick gets to his feet, “alright, who want’s to be next,” he asks, looking around at the remaining children.</p>
