<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">        After much begging and promises to wear clothes if asked Max was sitting in the car next to Sam on his way over. He looked at Sam and stuck his tongue out, Jeff long and slobbery stuck out of Max&#39;s mouth and he giggled before Sam noticed. Jeff could see him sitting there and watched him stick his tongue out in return. <br />
       It didn&#39;t take long to get to Sam&#39;s house and the boys ran in and immediately went to Sam&#39;s bedroom and stripped down.&quot; That&#39;s so much better, I was so hot&quot; yeah me too I hate wearing clothes&#39;&#39; the boys flopped down on the bed.&quot; What time is Michael coming over?&quot; &quot;Really soon I think and don&#39;t worry he&#39;s totally cool with us being naked around him, he might even get naked himself&quot;. Sam&#39;s mom came to the door and sighed&quot; naked already? Well Michael is almost here, why don&#39;t you two get dressed and meet him at the door&quot; Sam and Max slowly got dressed but left their underwear on the floor. They ran to the front door just as Michael and his dad arrived. <br />
	Max and Sam stood in the door wagging their tails excitedly as Michale walked in” hi!! I&#39;m so excited for tonight. I love sleepovers”. The boys went upstairs Jeff felt Max running excitedly and felt himself slip out of the boys mouth as he started panting lightly. Michael giggled at him&quot; that&#39;s silly but cool I wish my tongue was that long&quot; Max stuck Jeff out further and wiggled his head causing Jeff to flop around wildly sending drop of saliva everywhere&quot; your silly* Michael sat down on the floor and took off his shoes and socks&quot; are we going to be naked? Like last time&quot;. <br />
      Sam and Max quickly began undressing and soon all three boys were naked. &quot;What should we do first?&quot; &quot; Let&#39;s play video games!&quot; The boys flopped down on the floor and grabbed the controllers. After playing for a while Sam stood up and stretched&quot; I&#39;m thirsty let&#39;s go get some coke&quot; The trio left the bedroom and went to the kitchen without getting dressed, Max was panting slightly giving Jeff a view of the two naked boys in front of Max. He could see Sam&#39;s tail wagging as he led them to the kitchen and when they turned around he finally saw everything that the boys had to offer, he had of course seen Sam before but Michael was a wonderful surprise. He was uncut and decently equipped for a boy his age completely free of hair and adorable, Jeff felt himself becoming wetter as Max started drooling slightly.<br />
      Sam handed out cups of coke and the boys quickly finished them and refilled them a few times before Sam&#39;s mom put a stop to it.&quot; Boys that&#39;s enough for now or you&#39;ll be up all night peeing&quot; Max winked at Sam and set his empty cup on the table. &quot; Dinner will be ready in a few minutes. Why don&#39;t you wash your hands and get ready. The boys left the kitchen and went to the bathroom to wash up. &quot;Do we have to wear clothes for dinner? &quot; Michael asked Sam shook his head&quot; I almost never do unless we have company and mom makes me but she&#39;s ok with us being naked as long as we don&#39;t make a mess. Michael smiled and washed his hands &quot; your pee pees look really weird compared to mine but they&#39;re really cool&quot; Max smiled and stuck his tongue out&quot; not as weird as yours, we should see who can pee the furthest later I can totally beat you two&quot;. &quot; Your on dog breath&quot; Michael said with a smile as he grabbed his penis and aimed it around the room.<br />
        During dinner the boys drank plenty of water to prepare themselves for the contest. After helping clean up the boys went to the bathroom again to get ready for bed&quot; alright you three I want you to get cleaned up for bed that means a shower with soap, you can take a shower together or by yourselves as long as you&#39;re clean&quot;. &#39;&#39; Yes mom we will&quot; Sam answered dully rolling his eyes. The boys walked quickly into the bathroom and locked the door behind them. &quot; I really need to pee&quot; Sam muttered as he rubbed his sheath coxing his cock out &quot; yeah me to&quot; &quot; same here &quot; Max said as he also started playing with himself getting his cock ready. <br />
       Michael went first standing about half a tile from the lip of the toilet he released a stream of clear pee directly into the bowl he quickly pinched his penis to stop the flow&quot; anyone can do that my turn &quot; Max pushed him aside and stood slightly further back just about a foot holding his penis steady he released his own golden flow also directly into the bowl. &quot; Nice aim but you two should really leave this to the professionals&quot; Sam stood against the wall over 3 feet from the toilet, arching his slender hips forward he released his pee arching through the air a golden arch splashing loudly into the bowl. Michael stood next to him still firmly gripping his penis&quot; show off &quot; he loosened his grip and started peeing again falling short and peeing on the floor &quot; crap&quot; he waddled closer while still peeing until he was peeing into the again. Max stood by Sam and joined him in peeing into the bowl grinning and wagging his tail. &quot; Looks like it&#39;s dog breath for the win looser has to pee like a girl for the rest of the night&quot; Michael stopped peeing and shook his penis off&quot; I&#39;m not sitting down like a girl you two cheated yours are longer&quot; Sam and Max finished up and let their penises retract into their sheaths&quot; fine you don&#39;t have to sit down, now let&#39;s get cleaned up so mom doesn&#39;t freak out.<br />
      After showering and cleaning up the pee in the bathroom floor the boys went back to Sams room to play more games. &quot;Okay you three don&#39;t stay up too late I know it&#39;s not a school night but I don&#39;t want you up past midnight&quot; . The boys nodded absent mindedly to distracted by the video games. Jeff was hanging out of Max&#39;s mouth and dripping wet. Jeff had noticed that he was becoming less and less self aware, he knew he wasn&#39;t always a tongue but it felt weird thinking about being a human. He was becoming more and more just part of his brothers body he already knew everything his brother was thinking about and right now he was thinking about how cool it would be if his tongue was alive. Jeff suddenly realized what was happening he was being absorbed by his brothers mind and soon he would sease to exist as a separate mind he would just be a separate part of Max&#39;s mind and he was okay with it especially if Max kept doing what he was doing. <br />
          It was after midnight when the boys got ready for bed. They rolled out their sleeping bags and went across the hall to go pee before going to bed. &quot; Let&#39;s hold each other&#39;s penis this time Max suggested as he grabbed Sam&#39;s penis allowing Michael to hold his. Michael eagerly grabbed Maxs penis while Sam held Michaels, giggling softly as the boys peed together crossing the streams and enjoying holding another boy&#39;s penis. It didn&#39;t take long to empty their bladders and wash up. Yawning and stumbling sleepily the boys went to bed.<br />
       The boys slept in the next day until Sam&#39;s mom came up and knocked on the door. &quot; Sam, Max, Michael it&#39;s 11:30 time to get up, I want you boys downstairs&quot;. The boys woke up and slowly got up and went downstairs.&quot; About time you join us I&#39;ll make an early lunch for you guys. After that I want you outside. If you want to stay naked you have to stay in the backyard&quot; The boys nodded and sat down at the table helping themselves to some juice. After eating lunch the boys went upstairs to brush their teeth. Max and Sam stood over the sink together brushing their long mouths while Michael stood off to the side watching them while he brushed his own teeth. Sam finished up and spit into the sink letting his tongue hang out while he stuck it under the faucet, Michael stared at him in awe. Wow I wish I had a long tongue like that, Max stuck his tongue out its entire length and rinsed his mouth out. &quot; Mines about 6 inches Max bragged I measured it&quot; &quot; That&#39;s so unfair everything about you guys is longer than me. The boys went downstairs and out the door to the backyard.<br />
       Squirting in the bright sunlight the boys sat down on the grass.&quot; So what should we do? We could go ride our bikes but we have to get dressed if we do that &quot; &quot; might as well ride our bikes to the playground we can always get naked again in the woods&quot; &quot; yeah let&#39;s do that&quot; The boys went back inside and got dressed before grabbing their bikes and riding off.</p>
