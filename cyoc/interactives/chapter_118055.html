<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Huck watched as his parents and Betty both looked to each other with some looks of realization. He really didn&#39;t think that things like stairs would be a problem, but he supposed that the advise of the doctors was to be followed. He&#39;d do that, but that still left him in a rather tough situation, particularly as he had to stay somewhere. He was quite pleased to have the fact that both his parents and Betty were there for him, but their living situation would be one that wasn&#39;t very easy as his old room at home was on a second floor and next to the side door that would lead into the sort of apartment that his parents wanted to build for Harry and Jenny above the Jenkins garage. With his doctor&#39;s advice, that wouldn&#39;t work. At the same time though, it appeared that Betty&#39;s upstairs apartment wouldn&#39;t work for the same reason.<br />
<br />
It was a tough position to really figure out, and as Huck watched, it was clear that his parents and his fiance were caught by surprise and were trying to think of something. They were caught by surprise, and Huck watched back and forth between his parents and Betty. A part of him hoped that it wouldn&#39;t turn into a fight into who would care for him in his convalescence. After a few moments, there was a voice that came up that actually broke the silence between the two camps.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about our couch?&quot; Henry spoke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm?&quot; Lisa and Betty both said together.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about our couch?&quot; Henry asked again, &quot;It isn&#39;t the most comfortable of beds... but it isn&#39;t bad, it does fold out, and it&#39;s on the first floor. Huck could get to it easily enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I suppose that&#39;d be easier than stressing things with stairs,&quot; Betty commented as she looked over to Huck.<br />
<br />
Huck noted a bit of depression in Betty&#39;s voice. In a way he felt it as well, given how he had failed to notice that Betty had loved him. He&#39;d liked her, but thought it was something more akin to friendship and after he became a were, he didn&#39;t want to take any choices away from her. Though Huck also had come to realize that he&#39;d at times made decisions that actually reflected love for her that he&#39;d never realized it at the time. That was something Huck wanted to make up for, and he would make up for it if it weren&#39;t for the fact that he was recovering from a collapsed lung after being shot.<br />
<br />
Regardless of their feelings, however, Huck knew that neither his old room nor Betty&#39;s apartment would work well until he healed from the wound and surgery. It would be quicker than a normal human&#39;s ability to heal and recover, but that didn&#39;t mean that recovery wouldn&#39;t take time. It would still take some time and would derail any other private plans. Huck didn&#39;t want to rush anything with Betty, but if he wasn&#39;t recovering from injury, a good part of him wanted to show Betty just how much he loved her almost as soon as Harry and Jenny&#39;s wedding was over. Now, he was likely having to wait until the next weekend, and he couldn&#39;t go up stairs or ladders until he was given a clean bill of health. That made Betty&#39;s apartment against the doctor&#39;s orders.<br />
<br />
Now, elevators could make things easier in that regard, but Moon Lake was a small enough town that there weren&#39;t that many multi-floor buildings that often required there to be elevators to be there. Some of the buildings that had been built at a time when adding elevators would be difficult, and that required major construction projects for certain buildings to make sure they were accessible but that didn&#39;t go to every building and the apartment building she lived in wasn&#39;t one that had an elevator in it. In theory, there were plans to upgrade the building so that it could have an elevator and be wheelchair accessible, but that would take time. <br />
<br />
Betty knew that and voiced her depression because of it. Huck wanted to to say something to comfort her when his mother spoke up, which surprised him.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a great idea!&quot; Lisa Jenkins said with a great smile, &quot;we could have Huck at home and Betty could come and help and be close to him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Betty gasped and Huck&#39;s own eyes widened as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Lisa said with a smile, &quot;You&#39;re every bit a member of the family as Harry and Huck are. We&#39;ll have some family fun to congratulate Harry with his wedding and we can include Huck&#39;s release and you joining the family as well. You can directly look after Huck. We can all share stories, and the couch would be big enough once folded out that you could be with him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Betty&#39;s eyes widened in surprise or happiness at the idea of being with Huck in a way she&#39;d only dreamed of.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom... I can&#39;t do anything like that... the doctors want me to take it easy,&quot; Huck spoke, sounding just as surprised.<br />
<br />
&quot;It doesn&#39;t have to be like that,&quot; Lisa answered, &quot;not everyone has sex when they get in bed...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And Betty would thus be close enough to you that if you need something in the night... she would be there to help you,&quot; Henry said to him, &quot;It&#39;s not a sexual thing. It&#39;s a care giving thing, and as one big family, we should be able to do that together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A big family?&quot; Betty asked, a smile forming as she looked between Huck and his parents. Huck actually looked a bit more at ease. Likely as the proposed solution wouldn&#39;t mean an obvious fight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Henry smiled to her, &quot;and we can all talk... you, Huck, your future mother-in-law and I, and Harry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about miss Jenny?&quot; Betty wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;ll probably be back at the college for tonight,&quot; Huck commented, &quot;If she&#39;s getting married tomorrow... it&#39;d be bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Betty answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we can then go to the wedding together,&quot; Lisa spoke, &quot;You, too, Betty.&quot;<br />
<br />
Betty gave a weak smile, feeling quite welcome. She didn&#39;t know why she felt so proud at the acceptance. She&#39;d been friends with Huck since High School. It wasn&#39;t like she had just met Lisa and Henry Jenkins Sr. for the first time, but yet she did she welcomed and accepted by the Jenkins and that felt great to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Betty answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do you think about the idea?&quot;  Henry asked Betty, &quot;You bring Huck to our home and stay by his side?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Betty smiled, &quot;To help.. my family.&quot;</p>
