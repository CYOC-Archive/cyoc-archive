<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With newfound confidence and pride, Samantha went downstairs once again.<br />
Her body felt weird with a different center of gravity, but at the same time, it didn’t. It was more like she was fairly used to it, but not fully so due to growing so quickly up and out.<br />
<br />
Due to her wish that she didn’t come down earlier, no one else remembered what happened, meaning that to most of the women downstairs, it would be the first time they saw her.<br />
<br />
Once again, Samantha saw that a lot of the bridesmaids have arrived. The difference is that they looked at her differently. This time, it was mostly in surprise to see that unknown beautiful woman come in, with a bit of envy for some.<br />
<br />
Diana gestured to Samantha as she entered the room.<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s my little cousin, Samantha.&quot;<br />
<br />
“What do you mean in ‘little’? Replied one of the bridesmaids. “Isn’t she an adult?”<br />
<br />
“No” replied Diana. “She isn’t”<br />
<br />
“Just how old are you then?” The bridesmaid turned to Samantha. “Eighteen? Seventeen?”<br />
<br />
“I’m twelve” the overgrown girl replied with a smile.<br />
<br />
That statement shocked all the bridesmaids that didn’t know her prior. The beautiful woman in front of them, taller and bustier than any of them, was a kid? How is that possible?<br />
<br />
Samantha loved the shock of everyone around.<br />
Her cousin Diana was filled with envy. Her little cousin, younger than her by a year, looks like she’s older than her by years. It just wasn’t fair.<br />
Due to Samantha’s wish to enjoy her looks, she was filled with absolute pride and joy from the reactions.<br />
<br />
For the following minutes, Samantha got a lot of compliments about her looks, in addition to stares of shock and envy.<br />
“You look so beautiful”<br />
“I can’t believe you’re only twelve”<br />
“Do you think about modeling once you get to the right age?”<br />
“Do you consider basketball?”<br />
“Imagine what the rest of puberty has in mind for her...”<br />
<br />
And she absolutely loved it.<br />
<br />
Then, there was a knock on the door, and another bridesmaid came in.<br />
“Beth! So great to see you!” Diana said.<br />
<br />
Samantha looked at Beth. She was fairly fat, with big boobs.<br />
And then she felt pain on her chest. Due to her wish, she had to have the biggest breasts around.<br />
And since fat women have larger breasts for the same cup size, that meant that in order to pass her while still keeping the skinny figure from another wish, she had to have a cup size far greater.<br />
<br />
Once the pain stopped, Samantha opened her eyes again.<br />
“Samantha, are you alright?” Diana and Chelsea went to their cousin in worry.<br />
“Yes, I think I am. Not sure what happened” she lied<br />
She then looked down and saw a huge pair of breasts below. Her own breasts.<br />
She couldn’t make a big deal out of them at the moment, or else she’ll cause more problem. At least not in noises.<br />
<br />
These breasts were a sight to behold, with a deep cleavage shown to the world with a revealing top.<br />
Her wish to know her bra size still applied, and it showed her an insane measurement.<br />
30I<br />
“My boobs are huge” she thought to herself silently.<br />
Her wish to enjoy her breast size still applied, so despite how wrong it was for a 12 year old to have such a chest, she loved it.<br />
Her memories told her about outgrowing a bra every month, with her parents and doctors worried, while she was absolutely living her life with joy.<br />
<br />
A few more minutes have passed, during which Samantha noticed the stares at her chest being more common than just beforehand, and another knock was at the door.<br />
<br />
“I’ll open it” Samantha said while standing up, wanting to feel her new breasts in movement.<br />
They were heavy, about two pounds each, and she felt their movements up and down with her strides.<br />
<br />
And as she opened the door, she looked up at the new woman.<br />
“Tina! I thought you wouldn’t come at this point” Diana said from behind Samantha.<br />
“Sorry, there was traffic from where I came.” Replied Tina. “Did you really think I’ll miss your bachelorette party?”<br />
Tina appeared to be a tall woman at 6 feet even.<br />
And Samantha knew what this meant.<br />
<br />
She felt a sense of vertigo as she inched upwards, stumbling a bit while using the doorframe to keep herself up.<br />
“Hey there, are you alright girl?” Samantha suddenly heard a voice from in front of her.<br />
“Yes, I think I am” she replied, standing straight and looking down at the source of that voice, the 6 foot tall Tina.<br />
She looked down at a 6 foot woman.<br />
<br />
“Well, it’s difficult getting used to your height when you constantly grow taller. Said Diana. “You probably know it yourself, don’t you Tina”<br />
<br />
“Wait, growing? Is that woman...”<br />
“Yes Tina, this is my 12 year old cousin Samantha. She grew some more since I told you about her”<br />
<br />
Tina was shocked. She was used to being taller than every other woman around, and with the rare exceptions that happened, they were always with fully grown adults or older teens. Not by a child. Especially not a child with huge breasts that looks like an adult...<br />
<br />
“Hello, my name is Samantha” said the towering child with a smirk.<br />
<br />
Both Tina and Samantha went to sit down, with the latter admiring how long her strides were.<br />
<br />
Tina then began to ask the tall little girl questions.<br />
“Just tall are you?”<br />
“I’m 6’3” replied Samantha, using the knowledge her wish to know her height.<br />
“I really hope you aren’t bullied like I was in middle school when I grew up, it was horrible...”<br />
“Not really. Some people try, but I don’t mind it. I love my height.” She said with the new memories that came in. “I also became so tall recently that they started to fear bullying me, even though I never harmed them.”<br />
“I wish I could have said that...”<br />
<br />
“Wait a moment, you’re still growing?” Tina asked surprised<br />
“Yes, the doctors say that I have a lot of puberty left” replied Samantha<br />
“The growth pains must me horrible...”<br />
“They can be annoying, but I like them, because they show I’ll just become even taller afterwards”<br />
<br />
“But isn’t growing so tall and so fast dangerous? Shouldn’t you be treated to stop the growth so you won’t have health problems?”<br />
“The doctors didn’t find any health problems with my growth. They still told me I can be treated if I wanted to, but I don’t want to.” Said Samantha.<br />
<br />
Samantha loved the talk, seeing how different her experience (according to her new memories) is compared to what Tina told her happened to her.<br />
She then realized her enjoyment was due to her wish to enjoy her body, which still took place after she became taller and bustier.</p>
