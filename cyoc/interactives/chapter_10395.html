The Teenage Engineer<br />
<br />
“Hey guys, I’m off to the gym. Anybody wants to come along with me?” Dustin shouted out loud, as he stood in the doorway by the front door. They had enjoyed a rich Thanksgiving dinner the night before and Dustin felt the strong need to go to the gym, the day after they enjoyed the feast.<br />
<br />
“No, I’m going to the park with Ryan!” Ty shouted back. <br />
<br />
“What about you, Peter?” Dustin shouted back.<br />
<br />
“No, I got computer work to do!” Peter shouted from his room.<br />
<br />
“Alright, I’m gone! Watch the house while I’m away!” Dustin said, while he closed and locked the front door.<br />
<br />
Peter had a pile of CD’s on his desk. His laptop was getting slow and it had begun to crash often. Being that he always wanted it to be perfect, Peter decided to format his hard disk and reinstall all his software all over again! It was very time-consuming. He hated doing it, and it had been a year since the last format, so now was the best time to do it. He had no school because of the Thanksgiving holiday, and he took advantage of the extra free time to clean up his laptop computer.<br />
<br />
“What on earth are you doing, Peter?” a deep voice said out loud. Peter looked up, and was shocked when he saw Prince standing right in front of him, next to his desk.<br />
<br />
“Hi Master! What a surprise! I didn’t expect you to come over tonight!” Peter replied, showing his surprise.<br />
<br />
“Why not? Can’t I come over and see how my young wizard is doing?” Prince replied with a smile on his face.<br />
<br />
“Of course you can, Master! I was busy reinstalling all the programs on my laptop…” Peter began to explain to his instructor, while inserting another CD into the drive in the front of the slim laptop.<br />
<br />
“Why didn’t you go to the gym with Dustin?” Prince asked him, in a little more serious tone.<br />
<br />
“Well, I wanted to finish this, I guess…” Peter answered slowly, thinking about every word. He realized that Prince’s tone had changed and had become more serious. “Is there something wrong?” he asked cautiously.<br />
<br />
“Well, I want to challenge you to go out more. Trust me, you are spending too much time at home behind the computer; while your cousin’s foster brother is at the gym. What if I told you that you were missing the opportunity to make a difference in someone’s life right now?” Prince said, explaining why he wanted Peter to go out more.<br />
<br />
“I don’t understand…” Peter said quietly. <br />
<br />
“Peter, you are my best student. You’ve been blessed with incredible powers. I want you to go out more. You need to be using your powers all the time! There are many people out there who have needs, but there is only one of you! You can work on the computer any time, but you won’t meet a lot of new people and you’ll miss a lot of opportunities to help people. That is your responsibility, since you got these powers and others don’t!”<br />
<br />
“Do you think I should have gone to the gym with Dustin?” Peter wondered out loud.<br />
<br />
“Yes!” Prince replied. “For you to stay home all the time and to just keep to yourself shows a character flaw of yours… You tend to be selfish sometimes. I would like you to work on this and to really make more of an effort to go out. When you get out more, you will meet new people and you will realize what their needs are. You can meet those needs! I don’t want you to grow up and regretting not having much of a social life. In fact, I want you to go to the gym because you’ll meet someone who has been through this, and who now regrets it!”<br />
<br />
“Oh wow! Gosh, thanks for telling me that. I’ve never thought about it that way.” Peter said, as he briefly turned towards the computer screen. “You think I should go now?” he said. When he heard no reply, he turned around and noticed that Prince had disappeared.<br />
<br />
Peter then shut down the laptop and walked down the stairs where he saw that Ty and Ryan had already left to go to the park. Peter grabbed a notepad on the kitchen counter and scribbled a note to Ty, telling him that he had decided to join Dustin in the gym. He posted the note on the refrigerator door with a magnet. He grabbed a soft bag and placed a tank top and a pair of shorts in it, along with a towel and pair of socks and clean underwear.<br />
<br />
Peter walked out the door and locked it. He then looked if there was anyone watching from the street. When the coast was clear, he closed his eyes and wished to be standing in front of the entrance to Dustin’s gym. He immediately vanished in thin air, appearing in front of the glass doors by the entrance to the gym.<br />
<br />
Peter walked in and walked down the aisle in between all the machines, when he spotted Dustin lifting weights on one of the benches. He quietly walked up to him and smiled. He decided to wait for Dustin to finish his set, when Dustin looked up and noticed him standing next to the bench.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Peter! What are you doing here?” Dustin asked, showing that he was rather surprised to see Peter there after all.<br />
<br />
 “I had a change of heart… Can I be your partner?” Peter asked him.<br />
<br />
“Sure, go ahead and change first!” Dustin replied.<br />
<br />
Peter walked to the locker room, where he set his bag down. He pulled the zipper open and placed the clothes on the bench on the floor. Since there was no other person in the room, he silently used his power and was dressed in a second! He placed the soft bag in the locker and walked out to meet Dustin.<br />
<br />
Peter and Dustin had just walked on over to the bench when Alex, a friend of Dustin from school, walked up to him. <br />
<br />
“Hey, Dustin! How’s going?” Alex said to Dustin. Alex was a big muscular guy, wearing only shorts and a tank top, with muscles bulging everywhere. “Hey I want you to meet a colleague of mine. He is in the computer software business and I figured you would probably want to talk to him, since you’re still job hunting…”<br />
<br />
“Hey Alex! Sure, I would love to meet him…” Dustin replied.<br />
<br />
Dustin then turned around and faced Peter, who was wondering what he was going to do. <br />
<br />
“Peter, Alex wants me to meet a friend of his about a job offer. This is kind of important to me. I’m sorry, but let’s work out together tomorrow, okay?” Dustin said.<br />
<br />
Peter was saddened at first, but he understood the importance of this meeting to Dustin, and decided to work out by himself. <br />
<br />
Peter decided to walk on the treadmill; since it was something he could safely do, without the need of a partner or a spotter.  There were only two machines not in use.  He walked up to the first treadmill, but it had an “Out of order” sign taped to the handlebars, so he continued on to the next. The other was next to a middle-aged gentleman that had been walking for some time.  <br />
<br />
He got on the treadmill and set the speed and inclination settings. He then started walking, bringing the wheels and gears in motion, causing the machine to come alive with a humming sound. Peter noticed that he was the only person walking on the treadmills, other then the middle aged man who on the machine next to him.<br />
<br />
At first Peter didn’t pay much attention to the man next to him. He just looked straight ahead, minding his own business. His thoughts went back to the conversation he had with Prince, and replayed the things his instructor had said to him in his own mind. Then he turned towards his neighbor, and noticed how the man had a rather sad look on his face.<br />
<br />
Peter remembered the part about “meeting needs of others” and began to wonder why the man had a sad look on his face.<br />
<br />
He noticed that occasionally the man would scan the room from time to time and he would show a brief smile for anyone he made eye contact with, but the smile would quickly disappear when the man looked straight ahead. Peter put his strong psychic powers to work and picked up on the other walker’s thoughts; the man’s name was Rob. <br />
<br />
Peter learned that Rob had been depressed for quite some time. He was stressed out, unhappy, and feeling very much disappointed about how things have been going in his life. Rob was lonely and hurt, and he was longing to meet someone to talk to. Peter realized all this and carefully thought about what to say to this man, who was about 35 years his senior, without making either of them look silly or stupid.<br />
<br />
“Wow, you’ve already walked quite a distance on your machine!” Peter said out loud, trying to strike up a conversation and starting it out on a positive, encouraging note. He glanced over at the monitor on Rob’s treadmill, and he realized that Rob has walked a greater distance than he.<br />
<br />
“Well, this is all I could do today. I don’t have a partner, so I can only do machines for a lifting workout for now. You know, when you have a workout partner, your workout ends up being a lot more productive than when you have to work out all by yourself!” Rob was surprised that this teenager was willing to strike up a conversation with him. Rob realized that he was at least thirty years older than the teen.  But despite feeling a bit awkward about talking to a kid of Peter’s age, Rob replied that he had the same problem.<br />
<br />
“I had a partner. His name was Dustin. But he had to go with a friend to meet with someone about a job offer, so I’m stuck without a workout partner too. Can I be your partner, instead?” Peter asked Rob carefully and politely. Peter had hoped that Rob would say yes, because he sensed that Rob was beginning to feel uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
“No, I would rather not. I don’t want you to get the feeling that I’m hitting up on you.” Rob replied, much to Peter’s disappointment.<br />
<br />
“Oh don’t worry about that! Besides, I’m the person who asked you and who brought it up in the first place! Don’t worry!” Peter said, with a smile on his face. Peter quietly scanned Rob’s thoughts, and ordered Rob to gain more trust in Peter.<br />
<br />
Peter finished his walk on the treadmill at the same time as Rob. They both walked off the treadmills and shook hands.<br />
<br />
“Hi, my name is Rob.” Rob said, extending his hand towards Peter.<br />
<br />
“My name is Peter! Nice to meet you, Rob!” Peter replied, shaking Rob’s hand. “Do you come here often?”<br />
<br />
“I come here every day!” Rob replied. “How about you?”<br />
<br />
“I come here with Dustin. It really depends on how much homework I got…” Peter replied. This brought a smile to Rob’s face.<br />
<br />
Rob led Peter to the weight bench where Dustin had been working out earlier.<br />
<br />
“Gosh, must be nice. Your only concern is getting your homework done. It must be nice to be a teenager like you! I would just love to be at your age again, let me tell you!” Rob replied, as he got on the bench.<br />
<br />
Peter stood behind the stand with the bar on it, watching Rob as he wrapped his fingers around the bar as he slowly attempted to lift the bar straight up and over his chest, with his arms fully extended. Rob was lifting 120 pounds, which didn’t seem that hard for him. While Rob did his repetitions, Peter scanned his thoughts and learned that Rob was an engineer who was working for a firm that was close to declaring bankruptcy, and that Rob had not been paid in over six months. This was a deep concern to Rob, who had a longing desire to be a teenager just like Peter. Rob was barely making ends meet and was longing for a way out of his current situation.<br />
<br />
They took turns lifting about the same weights, while they watched one another. Rob was rather surprised that Peter was able to match him with the same weights he lifted. Little did Rob know that Peter had made himself a little stronger and muscular, so that he was able to lift the same weights as Rob.<br />
<br />
“So why are you hitting the gym so hard? Are you getting ready for some kind of competition?” Peter asked Rob at one point during the workout.<br />
<br />
“Only with myself, and I’m losing at that. I want to look lean and cut, a lot like you. I always wanted to be a jock, but I never was one in school and I got picked on a lot. I kind of want to make up for it now, although it seems like I’m thirty years too late I guess…” Rob replied sadly.<br />
<br />
Peter heard what Rob was saying, but he also picked up on the deeper thoughts and feelings that were going through Rob’s mind. Rob was filled with negative thoughts like great loneliness, many regrets and missed opportunities, lack of self worth and confidence, and a negative image of himself. Peter realized that Rob had been hurt a lot in the past, and that he was in desperate need of a good friend to talk to. Rob was a nice guy who simply deserved a break, and Peter realized that this was the reason why Prince had encouraged him to go to the gym. <br />
<br />
“Thank you for working out with me. Could we do it again tomorrow evening?” Peter asked Rob, after the workout at the weight bench. Peter again picked up on Rob’s desire to become a teenager again, but he didn’t want to do anything rash to freak out his new workout partner. Peter knew that he had the power to make Rob younger, but he decided to get to know Rob a little better before he would use his powers on him and make him younger. Rob agreed to meet with Peter again, and they exchanged phone numbers in the locker room. They then decided to meet again the following evening at the gym.<br />
<br />
That evening, Peter talked about his experience in the gym at the dinner table. He told Dustin about Rob, and wondered what Dustin thought of it. He told Dustin that he had planned on making Rob into a 16 year-old teenager, and that he would probably need a place to stay. He would look different, and he would no longer be able to go to his work as a teenager. Dustin agreed, for he didn’t mind having another normal person in the house, which was close to his own age as well. <br />
<br />
“I’ll take you to the gym so I can get to meet Rob myself. Let me bring up the idea of him staying here at our house. All you need to do is take care of his growth, okay?” Dustin replied, much to Peter’s delight.<br />
<br />
Dustin especially liked the idea that Rob was an engineer. He was at his own level, and it was nice to have a new friend like that. They agreed to be at the gym on time so that Peter could introduce Rob to Dustin.<br />
<br />
Dustin and Peter showed up at the gym at 7 o’clock sharp. Rob was already there and he smiled when he saw his teenage partner walking in. Peter and Dustin walked on to the locker room, and Peter had already picked up on Rob’s presence. <br />
<br />
Dustin took his time to get changed in the locker room, but Peter did it in three seconds, using his power to magically place his workout clothes on his body. Then he walked out to the workout area when he noticed that Rob had already made his way to the weight bench. <br />
<br />
“Hey Rob! Are you ready to lift some weight today?” Peter asked his older partner with a smile. Rob just smiled back.<br />
<br />
“I bet I can lift more than you, buddy!” Peter laughed and Rob smiled back.  Peter had decided to start using a little magic and to see how Rob would react.  <br />
<br />
“How about this: If I can lift more than you, then you owe me a drink from the snack bar. Is that alright? The loser has to buy a drink for the winner!” Peter said, offering Rob a cool challenge.<br />
<br />
Rob then placed 130 pounds of weight on the bar and got on the bench. He lifted it twice, before setting it down on the stand.<br />
<br />
“Your turn!” Rob said, expecting Peter to be able to lift it. Rob did not realize it but Peter had analyzed Rob’s strength and made himself strong enough to lift about 50 pounds more than Rob.<br />
<br />
Peter got on the bench and easily lifted the bar, and he did three reps just to show off. Then Rob added another 20 pounds to the bar, increasing the weight to 150 pounds. He knew that it would slightly heavier, but he would be able to lift the bar at least two or three times easily. He got on the bench and lifted it three times before setting it back down on the stand. To his surprise, Peter easily matched his effort, and managed to even perform an additional repetition, before setting the bar back on the stand.<br />
<br />
Rob decided to get serious and to add 30 pounds to the bar, increasing the weight to 180 pounds. He then got on the bar and was able to lift it twice, before setting it back down on the stand. It was now Peter’s turn, and Peter was able to raise the bar four times in a row. Rob slowly became very surprised that this sixteen-year-old kid had that kind of strength.<br />
<br />
He finally decided to add 30 pounds more and he figured this would be his final attempt, since he knew he was fast approaching his limit. With 210 pounds on the bar, he laid back down on the bench, clenching his fingers around the iron bar. He took a deep breath, and lifted the bar up once, before resting it back on the stand. He got up and smiled at Peter. There was no way this kid could lift over two hundred pounds, and he knew that at this point, he had won the bet.<br />
<br />
Peter got on the bench and managed to lift the bar twice, much to Rob’s great surprise! How could this teenager be that strong? Rob’s mouth dropped wide open, as he noticed that Peter was able to lift the weight without putting in any effort.  When Peter got up, he grabbed 20 pounds more and then invited Rob to try it.<br />
<br />
Not wanting to give up so easily, Rob got on the bench and grabbed hold of the bar. He took two deep breaths, before he slowly but surely managed to lift the bar. But he couldn’t do much more, and had to lower the bar back on the stand. He was exhausted, and he didn’t want to hurt himself for a silly bet.<br />
<br />
“I can’t do it. It’s too heavy…” Rob said, while taking several deep breaths. <br />
<br />
“Let me try it!” Peter said, as he got on the bench and grabbed the bar. Peter lifted the bar off the stand and managed to put out two reps before placing the bar back on the stand. Rob gasped as the reality hit him that this teenage boy was far stronger than him. Then Peter got up, and motioned to Rob to get back on the bench to try it again.<br />
<br />
“No, Peter. I can’t lift that! You win…” Rob said, sensing his defeat.<br />
<br />
“Come on, Rob! If I can do it, then so can you!” Peter said, cheering him on and encouraging the older partner to try it anyway. Peter quietly decided to put his plan into action and used his power to make Rob grow stronger, more muscular, while regressing his age back to the time when the 50 year-old Rob was a 16 year-old teenager. He made sure that Rob would not notice the change yet. He wanted the age regression to take about 30 minutes to complete.<br />
<br />
Rob got on the bench and reluctantly grabbed hold of the bar. He lifted the bar off the stand and was able to do two reps, before resting the bar back on the stand. In the meantime, his body had regressed five years. His gray hair had disappeared, and he had lost some fat, in exchange for the new abdominal muscles, which began to form on his torso. Rob got up and looked puzzled.<br />
<br />
“I don’t understand it. I wasn’t able to lift the bar ten minutes ago and now I did two reps. Isn’t that weird?” he wondered out loud, while Peter began to chuckle over the visible changes that were starting to become apparent. <br />
<br />
Rob and Peter then walked over to the leg extension machine where they decided to take turns. Rob went first, doing a dozen reps, before allowing Peter to next. Five minutes have passed, and Rob now looked like a 40 year-old man. His face was younger, he chest was slightly bigger, and his torso now looked lean and muscular, showing off an awesome pair of abdominals.<br />
<br />
Dustin finally joined Peter and Rob, and Peter introduced Dustin to his partner. Peter sent a silent message to Dustin, alerting him that he had used his power on Rob and that he was slowly growing back into a sixteen year-old teenager. Being extremely psychic anyway, Peter allowed nobody else in the gym to notice the changed except himself and Dustin. <br />
<br />
The three men then went to the lat pull-down machine, where they each took turns pulling down on the bar while standing straight in front of the machine. Dustin went first, then Rob, and finally Peter. Another ten minutes had gone by, and Rob now resembled a young man in his late twenties. He was even leaner and cut, his hair was dirty blond, his face seemed much younger as hair and wrinkles were replaced by his smooth skin of his youth. His pectorals were even bigger, his biceps began to show, and his calves and quads began to show signs of growth.<br />
<br />
Rob noticed how Dustin and Peter were intently staring at him while he did his reps, wondering why they were looking at him like that. Peter occasionally whispered something in Dustin’s ear, followed by a chuckle or a laugh from Dustin. Rob began to feel like they were making some kind of joke about him, for they were constantly staring at him as he was finishing his exercise. Of course Rob was not aware of the fact that he was now looking like a 20 year-old young man.<br />
<br />
The threesome decided to try one more exercise, which was at the abdominal machine. Dustin went first, followed by Peter, and finally by Rob. When Rob was doing his set, he noticed that once again Peter and Dustin were laughing and giggling, as Rob regressed through the final part of Peter’s magical spell. He was approaching the age of sixteen years old, with his face looking young and clean. He didn’t have much hair, he was lean and cut, and he was muscular but not freakishly big. He resembled a high school athlete, probably a wrestler or a gymnast, even though he was not aware of it yet. <br />
<br />
By now, the teenage Rob was feeling sore and tired. He had not had such an intense workout it ages, and he wondered why it was possible for him to come up with the strength and the endurance to last so long in the gym. He felt young, filled with energy, and light. But he had not realized that his body had regressed, for Peter had taken care of that. However, when he had finished his set, he noticed the looks on Peter and Dustin’s faces, and he decided to confront the two teenagers and to find out why they were making fun of a lonely, middle-aged man like himself.<br />
<br />
“Alright, you two… What’s so funny? Why are you guys making fun of a middle-aged man like me?” Rob asked the two teens, which were now both laughing as they admired Rob’s new look.<br />
<br />
“What are you talking about? You’re no middle-aged man! Not anymore!” Peter said, with a wide grin on his face. Peter scanned Rob from head to toe, admiring his handiwork and approving the results, while Rob looked at him with wonder and confusion.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Why don’t you take a look at yourself in the mirror?” Peter said, with a big smile on his face. Rob then turned around and walked towards the large mirror that was hanging from the gym’s wall.<br />
<br />
Peter and Dustin walked up to him and stood next to Rob. Peter stood on his left, Dustin on his right. Instead of seeing two teens and a middle-aged man, he saw three sweaty teenagers admiring their reflection in the mirror. But Rob gasped and dropped his jaw wide open when he recognized the face of the third teen… familiar but different!  Leaner and more chiseled, but without question him 30 years younger!  <br />
<br />
“So what do you think?” Peter asked him calmly. “Is this what you had in mind, Rob?”<br />
<br />
As Rob raised his arm and touched his cheek, he saw the teenager in the mirror do the same. He was lean and cut, with short, spiky highlighted dirty blond hair, an athletic figure, slightly tanned complexion, and smooth skin. He realized now that he was no longer 50 years old; rather he was now a sixteen year-old teenager in the flesh!<br />
<br />
Dustin and Peter both practically double over laughing, as they noted the astonishment on Rob’s face. Rob began to chuckle himself, although he still had to work through the shock. It had not begun to sink in that he had become a teenager, and he could not understand how it was possible for it to happen in the first place. Peter picked up on Rob’s confusion and decided that it was time to give Rob an explanation for this strange and unusual occurrence.<br />
<br />
“But… Who… How is this possible? Why me? Who did this? What happened?” Rob stammered, not knowing what to think or say as he was completely in awe over the sudden transformation that his body had gone through.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry Rob, it was me! I did this to you!” Peter admitted, with a big smile on his face.<br />
<br />
“But… Why me? How… How did you do this? This is amazing! No, this is impossible! Nobody is able to make someone else grow back in age! This can’t be happening!” Rob said, while he was pleased with his new body but confused about how his body had changed so sudden.<br />
<br />
“You had better tell him who you are, Peter!” Dustin said, realizing that Peter had to reveal his secret to Rob.  <br />
<br />
Peter looked him straight in the eye, since he was now three inches taller than Rob, who was about 5 foot 8 inches tall.<br />
<br />
“Rob, I’m a Transformation Wizard. I have inherited the powers of a great sorcerer, which allows me to not only read your mind, but to alter your body as well,” Peter explained to the wide-eyed teenager. Rob gasped when he heard it, although he could not understand what a teenage boy was doing walking around with such an incredible gift.<br />
<br />
“Rob, I can make you taller or shorter, I can grow or shrink your muscles on your body, and I can make you grow younger or older. I can read your mind, see your dreams,” Peter began to explain to Rob, who stared at him with wonder and amazement. <br />
<br />
“I’m a wizard, Rob. I picked up on your thought while we were on the treadmill yesterday and I realized that you had the desire to become a sixteen year-old teenager again. And since I had the ability to grant you your wish, I decided to use my powers on you because you deserved a break. You wanted a second chance in life, and I was able to grant you your wish!” Peter explained, feeling relieved that he could tell Rob everything without having to worry about keeping it a secret any longer.<br />
<br />
“You can stay with us, if you want” Dustin offered the teenage Rob, “I own a big house in a suburb not far from here, and you can be our guest if you need a few days to decide whether you would like to remain a teenager or if you want Peter to grow you back again! You can’t go back to your old job like this because nobody will recognize you!”<br />
<br />
Rob turned towards the mirror and started to like his new, young and muscular body. Peter had made him into something he had always wanted, to be a young teenage athlete in school and to be popular and liked around his friends and fellow athletes.<br />
<br />
“Thank you, Dustin and Peter… It’s an offer I cannot refuse. Golly, I just love this new body of mine! Look at these muscles!” he said as he pulled his shirt and flexing his arms in the mirror and admiring his bulging biceps, pecs and ripped abs. “I would kill to have a body like this! This is amazing!”  <br />
<br />
Rob then turned towards Peter and placed his hands on Peter’s shoulders while he was looking straight at Peter’s face. <br />
<br />
“Peter, I have never known anyone who had the kind of powers you do. But, from the bottom of my heart, I want to thank you for fulfilling a dream I have had for the past thirty years. How could I ever repay you?” Rob asked the young wizard.<br />
<br />
“Well, you’re an engineer. Could you help me with math homework?” Peter asked him cautiously.<br />
<br />
“Of course! Why, I would just love to be back in high school again. I could go to the same classes as you, and to take tests and do homework. I’ll help you any way I can!” Rob responded happily.<br />
<br />
“I can arrange that the administrators accept you at school and I’ll make them put you in my class, okay? We’ll be in all classes together and you’ll just attend class with us, until you decide what you want to do!” Peter explained, while Dustin was checking the time on the clock that was hanging on the wall in the gym.<br />
<br />
“Guys, how about we head on back home so that Rob can meet Ty and Ryan? Then we’ll help him move his stuff out of his old house, if he wants to. We’ll have dinner at home, so we can officially welcome Rob to the family!” Dustin responded. “Is there anything else you would like us to do for you, Rob?”<br />
<br />
“Gosh…” Rob answered, while pausing long enough to think about his answer. “I would love to be on the high school wrestling team or on the gymnastics team. That would really be like a dream come true!”<br />
<br />
“I can take care of all that!” Peter said out loud. “I can get you on whichever team you want!”<br />
<br />
“Thank you so much! You guys are awesome!” Rob answered, as he was completely filled with joy. The three teens walked into the locker room and showered. Of course, Peter was the first one to be showered, dried off, and dressed. He patiently waited for Rob and Dustin to get done. <br />
<br />
“I just don’t know what to say…” Rob said, while the three teens walked to the car on the parking lot. “I was always a short, chubby bookwork in school. I was a misfit and I had no friends at all. Even as an adult, all I ever did was eat, sleep, work, play on the computer, and go to the gym. Now look at me! I’m an athlete, I’m a jock and I got the best friends I could ever ask for! You have not only made my dreams come true, but you’ve given me the opportunity to do things I never had the chance to, like be on the gymnastics team or the wrestling team. Thank you so much!” <br />
<br />
Rob suddenly started to cry of overwhelming joy, and he embraced Dustin and Peter before getting into the car.<br />
<br />
Then the three teens got into Dustin’s car as they headed home as three teen buddies. For Rob, it was his first time to be a teen in over 30 years, and he loved every minute of it.<br />
<br />
On the way home, Rob couldn’t think of anything but what all the things were that he wanted to do, as he began to live his life as a teenage engineer.</p>
