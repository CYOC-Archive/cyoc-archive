<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;What have you done to me?&quot; exclaimed Dan.<br />
His voice! It was so different! High-pitched and so feminine! So... sultry!  <br />
&quot;I&#39;ve given you the body of a sexy Barbie,&quot; laughed Kat. &quot;I&#39;d have thought that much was obvious. You were such a macho and so interested in hot girl, I would have thought you&#39;d want to be one.&quot;<br />
&quot;No! Change me back!&quot;<br />
&quot;Certainly not. You&#39;re your own fantasy, now. Maybe you can understand how annoying you were now that you&#39;re on the receiving end.&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to be a stupid Barbie! Change me back!&quot; demanded Dan, stomping his foot in a ridiculous girly way. <br />
Kat smiled. The real fun was about to begin. She&#39;d hypnotise Dan to think in a ditz-like fashion, but not for now. She had other plans. <br />
&quot;I can&#39;t. Someone would be so disappointed,&quot; she said in a falsely sad tone of voice.<br />
&quot;What? Who?&quot;<br />
&quot;Why, your husband of course!&quot;<br />
At these words, a toy robot, easily a few (Barbie) heads taller than Dan, entered the room. It was blue and black with still well-defined facial features and it grinned widely when it laid its eyes on Dan.<br />
&quot;Honey! There you are! How is my dearest?&quot;<br />
&quot;What?&quot; spluttered Dan. &quot;What is that thing?&quot;<br />
&quot;A little feisty in front of your hubby?&quot; chuckled the robot. &quot;Women! I know you are just shy and a little scared of me. But you&#39;ll learn to be a good wife.&quot;<br />
He then approached to pat her cheek affectionately and pecked it affectionately. While the robot picked Dan up bridal-style, Kat wasted no time in making a lavish doll house appear. A doll house mimicking the typical home of the 1950s. She also made very sexy bridal clothes appear on Dan, in fact just sexy undergarments with lots of lace. The robot trotted enthusiastically to the house, lavishing Dan with compliments and words of affection and anticipation for his new darling wife. She was a little nervous but she&#39;d learn soon enough what a caring husband he was! Nothing to be worried about! She kept saying that her name was Dan and not Danielle as he thought at first, so he called her Liz. It was simple and pretty and he was already thinking of all the other names he wished to call her, such as &#39;dearest&#39;, &#39;darling&#39;, &#39;sweetie&#39;, &#39;love&#39; or &#39;sexy&#39;. And speaking of the last, his crotch was pressurizing already... How could it not, with such a hottie as his wife? He was so lucky! So he kissed her again on the cheek snd placed him on the double-bed expecting them both in the parental bedroom. Yes, because this house clearly had quite a few nurseries and he couldn&#39;t wait to get Liz pregnant! The thought of her with a rounded belly, smiling peacefully as little ones played on the rug... A dream come true! This robot loved domesticity and he was getting started right now! As for Dan, he continued protesting but it was no use. That stupid robot was just too strong. But as he was placed upon the horrid pink bed, his only relief that they both had no junk was completely dashed. The robot let a penis grow out of its crotch and as for him... His hairless plastic crotch, once the robot removed his new spouse&#39;s panties with hungry eyes, was more than a simple molded slit. It really led somewhere! It was terrifying! And the robot who kept telling him he was gorgeous and sexy ands not to worry because he was a good husband and would be gentle... He screamed for help but Kat was too busy enjoying the show. The robot pinned his Barbie wife to the bed and proceeded to kiss her fully on the lips first, and then caress and touch her everywhere. Before the great finale, he wanted to savor every moment of his nuptial night. He whispered sweet words in Liz&#39;s ear, told her about their future life together and strived to discover all the erogenous zones of her delightfully curved and sculpted body. It was a dream come true for all, except for Dan, who just saw it as a nightmare, both ludicrous and horrifying. <br />
<br />
The next few days had been just as bad, if not worse for Liz, formerly Dan. The robot had brought back all of his stupid sexy clothes and he had to wear them! Worse, the robot brought him housewife clothes from the 50s every evening as &#39;presents&#39; and he was reduced to wearing them or going around naked around the house. The robot left every morning to &#39;go to work&#39;, even though Dan never knew what he did. The robot just said it was too complicated for his &#39;cute little head&#39;. And the robot could leave the dollhouse! Dan could not because of a spell from Kat that locked him in. The robot just said he had to adjust being a housewife but that later he would take her to a fancy restaurant and shopping and romantic outings. And later, they would stroll in parks with a pram and children and won&#39;t that be just adorable? Dan thought the idea revolting. His new &#39;husband&#39; was greedy for sex. He slapped his butt, kissed him without pause and he insisted they had sex once a day, at least. He insisted that once she was pregnant, her mind would clear up and her homing instincts would kick in fast. Dan was appalled. What would come out of his vagina in the first place? And that robot was good at sex, as awful as it was to admit it. He rubbed his labia and clit just so and he knew how to use his junk. And to Dan&#39;s horror, while wrestling with him to escape his clutches, the robot had playfully asked his wife if she was ticklish and indeed Dan was, to his intense surprise. Quickly the robot, Will his name was, had developed a kink. If Dan did not perform his housewife duties, he spanked her, and he &#39;broke her in&#39; or &#39;tamed her&#39; by attaching Dan to the bed and mercilessly tickling him. He twirled a feather in front of his eyes before gliding it and using it on his entire Barbie body. And oh, how tickling with a feathers his crotch made Liz cum! Light caresses and brushes of the lips made Dan moan in spite of himself. And these moans and giggles really turned Will on! Was he that horny when he&#39;d been a guy? Probably and the fact that Will adored selecting her clothes for the day and dressing her up did nothing to alleviate his plight. Worse, that stupid robot made him bounce on his knees, eat from his hand or cutlery and whispered sweet little nothings in his ears, always reassuring him that he&#39;d be patient and that she&#39;d be a great mother and wife with time. He did spank her at first and as his ass stung, Dan had had to cook and clean until Will retuned &#39;home&#39;. He hated cleaning the future nurseries, though. Those reminded him of the worst things to come. <br />
<br />
One day, unbeknownst to Dan, Will came back elated. A kind witch had given him a pendulum! A magical pendulum that would set his gorgeous wife&#39;s ideas straight! Hooray! He could no wait to use it! Finally his dearest would see reason and be happy! So after dinner, as Will hummed a merry tune and removed his tie, excited at the thought of performing his marital duties and very  much enthralled at the sight of his delicious hottie cowering on the bed like a bashful bride still, he knew this was the right time. It was high time she saw nothing shameful in her pleasures with him! So he approached her and waved the pendulum in front of her eyes. The effect was instantaneous. Her gaze went blank. The witch that he had thanked profusely was right. No, he just had to speak and order her in soothing tones and soft words. Something quite natural for him, he didn&#39;t mind saying so. <br />
&quot;You are my wife,&quot; he whispered softly.<br />
&quot;I am your wife,&quot; she repeated, her eyes empty but incapable of doing anything else than watching the swaying pendulum.<br />
Already she was relaxing. Excellent.<br />
&quot;You are my dearest wife. You love being my wife. You adore looking after our home and me. I am your husband. Your sweet, loving husband. I am kind and caring and loving to you and you know that. You thank me by tending to my needs and by making the house cozy and comfortable and a delight to live in. Do you understand?&quot;<br />
Liz nodded.<br />
&quot;You are sexy and you love our love-making. You just love my showering you with compliments. You do love sex, don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
Liz nodded again, but blushing a bit too. Will noticed that.<br />
&quot;But no need to be abashed! It is perfectly normal! I love you to the recesses of my heart. And I will love our children just as much. Because you know I will make a great father. And a great mother, right?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes...,&quot; whispered Liz.<br />
&quot;Yes, yes! Because you want children. Lots of them! You can&#39;t wait! You dream about their cuteness and adorable things to do with them and dress them, don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
Suddenly, Liz&#39;s head was filled with gurgles, tiny feet, enchanting buttocks toddling around and all the cute toys and clothes that went with having adorable little babies. It was all so fluffy and cute! She nodded again and smiled, followed but an enchanting little giggle that made Will want to smother her with kisses and love. But not right now. <br />
&quot;You love being my wife because you are so very feminine. You giggle a lot and you&#39;re quite silly, but that&#39;s how I love you. You are a ditz, a little, but you are so beautiful, no one cares. I don&#39;t, at any rate, and that the most important thing because I am the man of your life. You love being feminine and pretty and enchanting for me.&quot;<br />
Liz slurred an affirmative answer. Yes... It all made sense. She had a Barbie doll so logically she&#39;d act and be like a Barbie. She was so pretty, it must be for Will, her husband. Like any Barbie, she had lots of clothes and a nice smile. She was there to clean, cook and please her hubby because, well... That&#39;s what she did and loved. That was normal and she loved other things, girly girl things like... Clothes, tea parties, smooches, having little children to fuss at, looking after her strong, wonderful husband,... She loved all those things. Of course she did. How could it not be? And when the soothing voice of her hubby told her that at the snap of his fingers, she&#39;d fall asleep, she knew she would obey. She WAS tired after all. A little nap would set her ideas straight. And Will was so attentive and sweet and caring... He would ensure that she rested well and woke up refreshed and happy. <br />
<br />
Will could not be happier. The pendulum had worked to a tee! Liz was now fully accepting of her role. She greeted him every evening with mouth-watering food and a clean house. They had even indulged in the bathtub more than once! Will had decorated it with flower petals and candles and it had been a pure soapy bliss. They had sex regularly and it was just a question of time until she had the telling bulge of a sweet little one. She kissed and hugged him often. She loved all of his ministrations and her giggles greeted his ears delightfully. She was the perfect wife he always knew she was. As for Liz, Dan&#39;s voice sometimes screamed out in her brain but it was quickly smothered. Liz had just thought about the girly silly activities his former macho mind had assumed girls stupidly liked and then the hypnosis had made him learn to love these new things, all assumptions as they might have been. He had become a perfect picture and victim of his own sexism. Indeed, the idea of having a baby from Will repulsed her none, now. Will could ravish her with her full consent now and the tickles he gave her were a real turn-on! Yes, life was good, she had an adorable hubby that she loved to no end and soon she&#39;d add a little bundle of joy to their perfect little family. Will did not have to tickle her into submission anymore and now the feathers served as a spectacular form of foreplay, just as  <br />
 <br />
Kat clapped her hands in joyful anticipation. So many possibilities! She could transform some bullies or mean girls into toys and have them be adopted, or insert their soul into Liz&#39;s pregnant belly! Now that would be fun to watch! This was more riveting than any sitcom! And she knew that there were many mean girls and bullies to punish in her high school. After watching them squirm for a while, Will would hypnotise them into obedience. In the meantime, it would be fun to see them have to adjust to a new body and new parents, just like Dan had had to do. It was poetic justice if the toy they became resembled the people they had tormented. Yes, it would be great fun indeed and her eyes sparkled and her grin widened.</p>
