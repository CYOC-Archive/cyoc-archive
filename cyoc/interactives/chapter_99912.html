<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nevin had been expecting the dreamy lightheadedness that washed over him all at once, having grown accustomed to it since his first experiments with the ring mere days after Ollie had joined the family. The difference this time was that he had an audience. Though he had his eyes clothes he could sense Ollie and Justin&#39;s giddy gazes fixed on him, feeling almost like a conduit for their excitement and wonder as the warmth of his regression rippled through his shrinking body. The dark had its own unique sense of vertigo, a weightlessness, a feeling of falling freely and yet knowing without a doubt that you were completely safe. Nevin couldn&#39;t help but grin as the sensation combined with that of his shirt sliding against his smoothing skin, his arms pulling themselves back into roomy sleeves that were growing roomier with each passing second. Grinning turned to giggling as his pants and underwear gave up the ghost and lost their hold on his slimming hips, the man turned boy squirming just so at the sudden draft between his skinny, hairless legs.<br />
<br />
If Ollie and Justin were aware of how much Nevin appeared to be enjoying his regression, neither of them made comment on it. Neither, in fact, seemed able to speak at all, or really do much of anything besides stare wide-eyed and open-mouthed as he was pulled back through his adulthood, his adolescence...and then, impossibly, his childhood, the boy&#39;s already-innocent features becoming positively angelic as he became even smaller than the pair of seven-year-olds watching his transformation in silent awe. Nevin&#39;s cheeks grew plump and rosy and his grin showed off an increasing amount of baby teeth as his hair grew finer and lighter, with every passing second becoming less a child and more a toddler...a <i>baby</i>. <br />
<br />
Nevin waited a long moment before opening his eyes, savoring the afterglow of his regression. When he did, he automatically squeaked in surprise at the way Ollie and Justin - still gaping at him with undiminished awe - towered over him. The boy had gotten <i>some</i> sense of how small he was when he did this by himself, but nothing drove home just how thoroughly he had regained his youth than seeing that the seven-year-olds he had dwarfed a moment prior had practically become giants. His cheeks burned in a sudden fit of self-consciousness as the two-year-old squirmed where he stood...which was just enough for his shoulders, already nearly too narrow to hold it up, to slip through the collar of his shirt. The garment pooled at Nevin&#39;s ankles with the rest of his grown-up clothes as he squealed and clamped his pudgy hands over his sudden shame, the fire in his cheeks roaring when Justin&#39;s giggling let him know that he had moved too slowly to deny the seven-year-old a glimpse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Awwww, is da widdle baybee embarrassed &#39;cause he&#39;s all nakie? Guess we&#39;ll hafta get <i>him</i> in a diaper right away, won&#39;t we?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Justin, don&#39;t...&quot; Ollie spoke as though coming out of a daze as he frowned at his friend. &quot;Don&#39;t tease Nevin like that. It was really nice of him to make himself that little for us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not teasing him.&quot; Justin rolled his eyes. &quot;You gotta talk to babies that way &#39;cause it&#39;s easier for them to understand. That&#39;s what my Aunt Rebecca told me when she brought my little cousin over. She showed me how to change his diaper, too, so now I&#39;m gonna put one on widdle Nevy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Justin moved towards the toddler. Ollie put a hand on his shoulder. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nevin?&quot; A sympathetic smile came over the boy&#39;s face as he looked down at the toddler. &quot;Do you want a diaper? We won&#39;t put you in one if you don&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
Justin, though indignant at having to wait for a baby&#39;s permission, nonetheless sighed dramatically and crossed his arms while waiting for Nevin to respond. Nevin, blushing from head to toe (as both boys could clearly see), merely stared up at Ollie for a second...before taking on the tiniest of smiles and nodding at his adoptive son.<br />
<br />
&quot;You see?&quot; Justin shrugged off Ollie&#39;s hand. &quot;He wouldn&#39;t have them if he didn&#39;t like them. I won&#39;t hurt him or anything like that, Aunt Rebecca showed me how to do it nice and gentle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Left with no reason to object, Ollie stared at Nevin for another second - before, in sudden realization, plopping down into a cross-legged seat so he wouldn&#39;t be towering over the boy. Adoptive father and son shared a sheepish smile as Justin gathered together the necessary supplies. Strangely, Nevin appreciated Ollie&#39;s kindness every bit as much as he did Justin&#39;s condescension - the half of him that needed reassurance was utterly thankful that his adoptive son was being so nice, while the half that wanted nothing more than to drown in the fantasy relished each mocking word out of Justin&#39;s mouth. It was that half that was fed when Justin - tenderly though with authority - laid Nevin onto his back, the toddler gulping and grateful that he&#39;d had the basement refinished earlier that year.<br />
<br />
&quot;First you gotta lift up their legs so you can put the diaper beneath their butt, like this...&quot; Ollie scooted close as Justin, while instructing, took up both of Nevin&#39;s ankles, lifting his chubby bottom just enough to slide the Pampers beneath. Nevin tried to suppress the litte coo that came out when his tush touched the pillow-soft interior, but, thankfully, neither boy seemed to notice it. &quot;Then you gotta use <i>lotsa</i> baby powder...&quot;<br />
<br />
Justin practically drowned Nevin&#39;s nether regions in the stuff, not the toddler minded - the smell that filled his nostrils made him feel positively infantile.<br />
<br />
&quot;...and then rub it in super gentle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nevin had to admit that the kid&#39;s aunt had done a good job of teaching him - he might&#39;ve been a brat, but damn if he didn&#39;t change a good diaper. The toddler slowly allowed himself to relax and soak in the pleasure of the realized fantasy, only to snap back to attention when he realized that that pleasure was concentrating itself in a very particular place. Mortified, Nevin raised his head to see the boys peering curiously at his infantile erection...and was at once relieved and humiliated when they merely giggled innocently at it.<br />
<br />
&quot;That happened with my cousin too.&quot; Justin grinned at Ollie as he brought up the front of Nevin&#39;s diaper and taped him in. &quot;She says it&#39;s &#39;cause babies like having their diaper changed. Is that it, widdle Nevy? Does da widdle bay-bee wike his dipee?&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>God yes</i>, Nevin inwardly moaned as he was reacquainted with the leg-spreading thickness of his Pampers. He reveled in the way it hugged his bottom and pee-pee in a soft cloud, in the way each crinkling movement reminded him of how young he&#39;d become. His hand, as though moving of its own accord, came to his lips...and before he knew it his thumb was in his mouth, the heat in his cheeks intensifying as his sucking set the boys off on a fresh round of giggles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Boy, he <i>really</i> likes it.&quot; Ollie beamed as he took hold of little Nevin&#39;s free hand and helped the toddler to his feet. Then - to the toddler&#39;s squeaking surprise - the boy used all of his seven-year-old strength to pick him up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oof,&quot; Ollie giggled as he readjusted his grip the toddler, hands linked beneath Nevin&#39;s padded bottom. &quot;Is it okay if I carry you upstairs, baby Nevy? You wanna join our sleepover?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nevin hesitated for but a moment before smiling shyly around his thumb and nodding at his adoptive son. Ollie grinned and, with a mighty effort, started hauling Nevin up the stairs, Justin trailing right behind with his hands full of everything they might need to care for their new playmate.</p>
