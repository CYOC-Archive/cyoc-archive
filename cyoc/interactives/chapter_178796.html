<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Greg looked around the room, seeing the statues of the four animal men, and how three of them matched the animals that surrounded him. “They… they took the same form of the statues,” Greg understood immediately. “My friends… You’re Ken, Mark, and Richard!”<br />
<br />
The three others nodded, trying to soothe their friend’s nerves and help him accept his gift. Richard rumbled out some kind yet incomprehensible words in his deep voice about how amazing it felt to become such a powerful beast of a man, while Mark seductively licked his muzzle and gave his hefty bulge a pat. Kenneth, the Hunter, reached into a pouch and pulled out a piece of fruit that he had foraged while searching earlier, as if to say, “We’ll be fine here on this island. We can have anything we need to be happy.”<br />
<br />
Greg was still stunned by how incredibly attractive each of his friends were in their new forms. For certain, Richard was immensely muscular, Kenneth unbelievable fit, and Mark amazingly beautiful (and hung, for that matter). But each of them were still the pinnacle of male beauty, and if he understood things correctly, he could be too. All he had to do was…<br />
<br />
“…I… I’ll do it,” Greg said quietly slipping off his clothes and feeling the cool and damp air of the jungle night wash over him. His dick stuck straight out and throbbing, still drooling precum, and he slowly walked over toward the statue of the tiger, the Sage of the islands. His three friends watched in silence, excitedly awaiting Greg to join them as the final exemplar of the islands.<br />
<br />
Greg stared into the statue’s eyes, amber gems set into stone that held deep wisdom. Every muscle was carved into the stone with care, and even the stripes of the tiger’s fur stood out clearly in the dim light of the chamber. Greg knelt at the altar, gripping his cock and beginning to pump himself, feeling a tingle run through his body as he accepted his new gift.<br />
<br />
He felt himself dripping with sweat as his cock dripped precum all over the altar, and the moment the first drop touched the stone his changes began. Thick, soft, orange fur began to sprout across his balls, which grew heavy and large as they began to cum out every last drop of Greg’s human essence onto the ground. His cock, likewise, began to thicken and grow even harder as tiny nubs grew up and down its length. He felt his orgasm getting close as his precum began to ooze out in a thick stream, but knew full satisfaction would only truly come once his changes were complete.<br />
<br />
With his dick fully feline, his new fur surged across his body, orange with broad black stripes and a dusting of white on his chest and thighs. Greg’s legs inflated with powerful muscles beneath his silky fur, thickening until he could never hope to fit his puny human hands around them. His arms and chest exploded with power as well, pumping up with layer after layer of toned muscle, giving him the body truly befitting the beast of a man he was becoming. His hands and feet shifted into immense paws, with deadly retractable claws ready to be unsheathed at a moments notice.<br />
<br />
The fur finally reached his neck, which thickened to accommodate his powerful new torso and left him with a deep and commanding voice. He growled in pleasure as the fur slipped over his face, pushing his skull into a muzzle tipped with a pink nose, with whiskers growing from the sides in the form of a handsome moustache. His eyes began to glow in the dim light, becoming a bright amber, as all the skills and competencies needed to be a wise leader filled his mind. By the time his ears had pulled themselves to the top of his head and narrowed into the tufted ears of a tiger, he was the leader he knew he was destined to be. A rumble began to rise up in his throat, turning into a powerful roar of pleasure as he finally came for the first time in his new form, soaking the stones with a torrent of cum as he rid himself of the weak and foolish human being he had been before. The three men behind them groaned as they came as well, aroused beyond words as Greg the Sage completed his transformation.<br />
<br />
His changes completed, Mark smiled and walked over on his soft jaguar paws and carefully braided the fur on Greg’s neck, entwining beads and colorful bands into the short beard of fur around his chin. Kenneth placed a golden band around the tiger’s forehead, while Richard placed a staff that was the symbol of the Sage’s authority into his paws.<br />
<br />
Silence hung over the temple chamber along with the musky smell of the four men’s spilled cum as they waited for a sign that they had pleased the voice that had led them here.<br />
<br />
Finally, the stones of the temple vibrated as the voice spoke to the four of them.<br />
<br />
“The four exemplars have been born again. You shall lead your people and rebuild this land into a new golden age,” the voice intoned. <br />
<br />
The glowing light of the temple began to warp and shift, showing them a vision of the past: thriving villages across all of the islands, populated by beautiful animal people of all different species, farming, hunting, crafting elegant art, and making love to one another. A true paradise in every sense of the world. But, in time, the outside world tempted them, and one-by-one the animal people abandoned the islands and became mere humans, until one day there were none left and the islands were left to ruin.<br />
<br />
“However, you shall take up what they left behind, and create a new civilization that will be the envy of the world. In time, ancient wisdom shall be brought into the modern world, melding together the best of both to create a paradise on earth, with you as its leaders.”<br />
<br />
Mark’s tail was whipping around, excited by the idea he was hearing but still having one little problem in the back of his head. “Umm… That sounds great an all, but how exactly are we supposed to… ‘repopulate’?” he said as he cuddled up in Richard’s big lap. “Four men isn’t exactly conducive to baby-making, right? Plus, none of us really like women to begin with…”<br />
<br />
There was a pause. “Any human who comes to these islands will begin to take their new animal form, though it may take some time. You must convince them to stay and finish their change,” the voice said, sounding unsure of itself for the first time. “In time, I hope that enough people will live here that nature will take its course and life will be returned to the islands. But whether it does or does not is up to you. Use your new abilities to lead and rebuilt my civilization. That is all that I ask.”<br />
<br />
The vibrating voice seemed to fade away, and the four men were left alone for the time being. Greg, stepping into his new role as the Sage, took charge and began to speak.<br />
<br />
“Well, it sounds like we have our task. I like the idea of helping rebuild this civilization, especially if it comes with getting a body like this,” he said, flexing his powerful muscles and purring in satisfaction. “But, it won’t be easy. We’ll have to think of a way to get more people to come to these islands and keep them here… Any ideas?”</p>
