<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Daniel, and he really was starting to think of himself as Daniel, had his problem solved when his phone went off. Cameron his best friend and teammate texting him about plans for tonight. A few people over wouldn&#39;t be a party, so he invited Cam, who asked about bringing his girlfriend Jenny, which he okayed of course.<br />
<br />
Shortly after his father left to catch his plane, Cam and Jenny showed with a third person in tow. &quot;This is Naomi.&quot; Cam said, waving to the third. &quot;Jenny&#39;s cousin. New in town, you don&#39;t mind right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all.&quot; Daniel motioned for the group to enter. Cameron was just as tall as Daniel, though a leaner build. He was one of the fastest guys on the team though, their best running back, heavily tanned with loose black hair. Jenny was slim and tall, her hair was a rich auburn. They had actually slept together once before she dated Cam and while Daniel was still confused over his own preferences. Or so the memories told him. Her cousin Naomi could have looked like a sister, though she was a bit shorter and blond. He recalled from his implanted memories seeing her around the school, a transfer student newly arrived.<br />
<br />
This was probably his friends&#39; attempt at hooking him up. Cameron had been his best friend since elementary school, and Jenny had always been friendly with him but entered his inner circle when she and Cam started dating and getting on so well. He himself hadn&#39;t dated since he figure out his sexuality at the beginning of Junior year, so about a year of no dates. Which meant they kept trying to hook him up. Though he had kept his preference for men to himself.<br />
<br />
A couple hours later and the whole group was pleasantly buzzed off of pilfered beers, taking turns playing video games and just chatting away in Daniel&#39;s furnished basement. Naomi was definitely trying to flirt with him, and Daniel was humoring her without trying to lead her on. It was a delicate line to walk. She was pretty cool, laid back, loved games and apparently surfed. If she had been a guy he would be all over her. And that was definitely an option, but it would also out him. While the part of him that was Luke didn&#39;t care, Daniel did, and those memories were getting fuzzy with his own, now.<br />
<br />
So while Cam and Jenny took their turns pummeling each other on the screen Naomi scooted in closer to Daniel. &quot;So, are the rumors true?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rumors?&quot; Daniel asked, arching a brow. &quot;What rumors?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I overheard Meghan calling you donkey dick.&quot; Naomi said with a laugh. Meghan was one of Dan&#39;s exes, and not a friendly break up either. &quot;Few of the other girls said you were more horse than donkey. So?&quot;<br />
<br />
From where he sat, Cameron let out a laugh. &quot;Donkey dick. I gotta use that one now.&quot; Jenny elbowed him. Daniel rolled his eyes but Cameron went on. &quot;You have no idea, Naomi, if football doesn&#39;t work for Daniel he could always go right into porn. Dude is fucking hung.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we stop talking about my dick?&quot; Daniel said, though he laughed a little. &quot;So what if it&#39;s a little big?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A little?!&quot; Cameron started laughing again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m getting another beer.&quot; Daniel said as he extricated himself from the sofa and wandered upstairs to the kitchen, the sound of the game and the other three fading behind him. He reached into the fridge and grabbed a six pack to bring back downstairs, but when he turned around he saw Naomi had followed him. She was standing close enough that she put a hand on his broad shoulder. He tried to back away, but there was a counter top behind him, which trapped him as she pressed her lips against his.<br />
<br />
His thought from earlier came back to him. He deposited the beers on the counter next to him as his hands went to her hips. He could feel her changing, even if he couldn&#39;t see anything. The way his neck angled differently as she gained height. The two soft mounds pressed against his chest shrinking, then replaced by hard planes of muscle.<br />
<br />
He felt the way her grip on his shoulders changed, her hands getting larger, more strength flowing into her arms as she held on to him more firmly. Even under his own hands as her hips lost some of the roundness, though her ass stayed nice and curvy. Even the weight of the kiss changed, less delicate and teasing to something stronger and needy, a bit of stubble rubbing at his chin. Daniel got into the kiss a bit more, especially as he felt a hand slip down to grope him through his jeans.<br />
<br />
He could almost feel the shock through the kiss as the hand felt at the semi-hard cock below the denim. &quot;Holy shit..&quot; The voice was deeper, laced with a little bit of surfer dude. Naomi, or not, pulled back. Daniel had to admit she was good looking as a guy. Definite beach bum or surfer vibes. His blond hair was shorter, but still hung down to around his jaw, slightly wavy, he had a nice summer tan still going. Taller than Naomi had been he was still a couple inches shorter than Daniel, with a leanly muscled build that the sleeveless tank he was now wearing showed off. Jeans had become cargo shorts, and he wore sandals on larger feet at the end of blond furred legs. &quot;How fucking big is that thing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Daniel? Noah?&quot; Came another male voice as Cam popped around the corner, wondering what was taking the two so long. &quot;Ha!&quot; There wasn&#39;t enough time to move apart, and Cameron on spotting them looked... pleased? He shouted back. &quot;Jenny, you owe me fifty bucks!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; Her voice came from downstairs, surprised but soon she joined them in the kitchen. Daniel and Noah had separated a little but there it was still obvious they had been close, and there was no hiding what was going on in Daniel&#39;s pants. &quot;Damn. I do, don&#39;t I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell are you two talking about?&quot; Daniel finally asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We had a bet.&quot; Cameron shrugged as he walked over to grab a beer. &quot;I said you were gay, Jenny didn&#39;t believe me. I said we should try to hook you up with Noah here.&quot; Everyone but Cameron looked embarrassed. &quot;Oh come on, I know my boy.&quot; He clapped Daniel on the shoulder. &quot;I bet I figured it out before you did. And for the record.&quot; Cameron lowered his voice to a mock whisper. &quot;If I was gay I&#39;d totally be all over you.&quot; He laughed and headed back to the stairs. &quot;Anyway, these beers aren&#39;t going to drink themselves.&quot; Jenny trailed after him, shaking her head slightly.<br />
<br />
Not how Daniel had ever pictured it going, but it did go better for him than it did when Luke had come out. Naomi, or Noah as he was being called after the change looked at Daniel. &quot;I didn&#39;t know they were doing that. I thought..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it.&quot; Daniel said with a shake of his head, grabbing the rest of the beers. &quot;I&#39;m used to Cameron&#39;s antics.&quot; Noah looked awkward, so before he went downstairs with the rest of his friends he leaned in and pressed another long, eager kiss against Noah&#39;s lips, grabbing his ass in his free hand with a teasing squeeze.  &quot;C&#39;mon..&quot; Noah followed Daniel back down to the basement, though he had to wonder just how much the world had changed, including Cameron&#39;s suspicions when he made the change. But it started to hurt his head and thought better of thinking on it too hard.</p>
