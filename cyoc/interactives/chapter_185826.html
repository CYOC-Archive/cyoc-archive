<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For the next year, the kid dedicated himself to one thing and one thing only: becoming as massive and powerful as he could. Of course, &quot;kid&quot; was a terrible description for him; there was nothing childlike about the hung, hulking beast of a man he had become. He studied regular academic subjects from time to time, at his mother&#39;s insistence. But mainly he ate, slept, lifted, and pleasured himself. His father was his prime enabler--buying him new equipment, more weight plates, more supplements, more protein. His mother&#39;s assistance was more reluctant, although she kept a steady stream of food headed in her growing son&#39;s direction. <br />
<br />
Halfway through the year, he outgrew the basement. Oh, there was still plenty of room down there for ordinary folk. But given his greater height and mass, it was impossible to perform a full squat without shoving his head through the ceiling and into the room above. In general he was bumping into things more and more, and in particular hitting his head on the ceiling beams. <br />
<br />
The answer to this dilemma, as it turned out, was a prefabricated metal structure, assembled behind the main house. Nearly as big as the house itself, it had space for living and lifting, not to mention an extra-large shower, a sturdy sink and toilet, and a very good internet connection. Just as importantly, there was space for plenty of mirrors and a very robust drainage system for all the cum he produced. Insulation was unnecessary; his huge body produced plenty of heat to keep him warm, even on the coldest nights. Cooling on hot days was more of an issue, but easily solved with naked workouts and a large ice maker to keep him hydrated and provide cooling buckets of ice water to douse himself with. He was naked much of the time, owning only a few articles of clothing, all of them custom sewn by his mother; off-the-shelf simply did not exist for him. <br />
<br />
The kid--no, man--became obsessed with Jake. It wasn&#39;t enough to be a little bigger than the cocky collegian. No, the growing young man intended to utterly destroy Jake. To completely overwhelm him. To be so much BIGGER, so much BETTER... <br />
<br />
He regularly watched Jake&#39;s videos. Watched Jake preen and prance about, boasting about his size, giving the hungry audience his stats, reeling them off with practiced ease. He scoffed at Jake. Sneered at him. Chuckled heartily, secure in the knowledge that Jake&#39;s boasts were nothing compared to his ever-expanding reality. <br />
<br />
It gave him a boner every time. He would play with his huge balls, watching Jake on the little screen, mocking him. It always led to an incredible orgasm, an incredible mess from the resulting cum, and an incredible workout afterwards. His cum seemed to enhance his workouts even more. His dick was so big that he could sometimes wrestle it into position, shooting his load straight into his own mouth as he came. Other times he used a bucket or whatever was at hand, guzzling down his own seed, loving the feeling of power that spread inside him shortly after ingestion. Loving how amazing his pumps felt when he was thusly fueled. <br />
<br />
His sixteenth birthday was special. There were all the usual trappings, of course: cake and ice cream and parents and the rest. But when the singing, the candles, the cake, and the general birthday feasting were over, he went back to his metal structure. He had already worked out that morning and afternoon, but he did it again that evening.<br />
<br />
After he&#39;d finished working out, he lay back in his bed and logged on to the camsite where Jake performed. Normally, the young man contented himself with videos of Jake that he found elsewhere. But it was his birthday and he decided to treat himself, paying for access. His huge dick stiffening in anticipation, his big balls churning.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s right, guys,&quot; Jake boasted to the camera, &quot;It&#39;s your favorite musclefreak, showing you the biggest, strongest, most hung man on the planet!&quot; He wore jeans that would have been impossibly loose on anyone else, but that hugged his giant thighs, showing off his thick quadriceps. He had on a huge jacket, the Greek letters of his fraternity stretched over his massive chest. He slowly opened it, revealing the shirtless glory beneath: the cleft between two thick, meaty pecs, sitting above an eight-pack that managed to be perfectly defined yet bloated with power at the same time. <br />
<br />
Jake turned around, showing the audience his broad back, the jacket stretching across it. Slowly he removed the garment, teasing his viewers with his huge arms and massive back as they were gradually revealed. &quot;Get a look at it, guys,&quot; he boasted cockily, &quot;My lats are fucking wings, man!&quot; He put his fists on his hips, flared out his huge arms, and spread his lats wide, showing off the incredible taper to the muscles. He held the pose for a minute, giving his fans the opportunity to admire him, before turning back to face the camera, lats still spread, his thick chest and strong stomach now on full display. He raised his arms and flexed them hard. &quot;Thirty-five inches, fuckers!&quot; he roared, &quot;Six-foot-six, 530 pounds, and guns that have more girth than the average little club twink&#39;s waist!&quot; <br />
<br />
Again Jake held the pose, letting his admirers gawk at his huge arms. Then he brought them down, and hooked his thumbs in the waistband of his jeans. &quot;But I know what some of you are really here for...&quot; he purred. He unbuttoned and unzipped himself slowly, then lowered his jeans down over his giant thighs. A large, protruding bulge of underwear-clad cock and balls emerged. It throbbed visibly, the big dick within hardening, growing, the root beginning to show as the elastic waistband was pulled down its increasing length. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right, boys,&quot; Jake crowed, &quot;Two full feet of meat here! Twenty-four fucking inches of hole-destroying manhood!&quot; He pulled down his underwear, letting his mighty pole free, the softball-sized nuts below it coming into view as well. &quot;Get a good look at it!&quot; he continued to rant, &quot;Imagine it splitting you apart!&quot; He grabbed his huge cock and waved it back and forth, making sure the camera got every veiny inch of it. <br />
<br />
Jake began to double-fist his mighty dick, his huge muscles bulging spectacularly as he beat off for his admirers, the timing of his deep grunts matching the sound of his meat being vigorously pumped. When he came, his body tensed up all over, every muscle suddenly very defined as he sent ropes of cum arcing through the air. &quot;Be back here tomorrow night,&quot; he grunted, as his cock sent out its last few volleys of seed, &quot;I&#39;ve got something special planned for you guys. A couple of little twinks who&#39;ve been practicing taking some very big dildos, who are about to learn how much better the real thing is!&quot; <br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that&#39;s a birthday present!&quot; the big man growled as Jake finished his show. He was rock hard, his giant dick gushing pre excitedly. He stood up, strutting over to the mirrors that dominated the walls of his room. He repeated Jake&#39;s routine, grinning the whole time, knowing that he was the larger, more powerful, more potent man. &quot;Eight-foot-four,&quot; he said, announcing his most recent height measurement to the empty room. &quot;Twelve hundred pounds,&quot; he added, noting his approximate weight. He brought his arms up into a mighty flex. &quot;Forty-eight inches, fucker...&quot; he hissed, watching with glee as his biceps rose to insane proportions in his reflection. &quot;And then there&#39;s this...&quot; he finished, reaching down to grope his rock-hard cock, &quot;Six feet long, Jake. Three times as much as you have!&quot; He began to roughly work over his huge pole, watching his muscles move in the mirror. He was bigger than Jake in every way. BETTER than Jake in every way! And tomorrow... tomorrow he would go to Jake&#39;s University, find his frat house, and finally show everyone just how true that was! The thought of it sent him over the edge, his mighty pole sending a geyser of cum rocketing up to hit the high ceiling up above. Tomorrow, it would all come to a head.</p>
