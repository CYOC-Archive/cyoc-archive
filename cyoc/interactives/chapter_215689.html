<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bill didn&#39;t know what to do. He was trapped, on one of the rusty, in dire need of replacement swings in the small park that surrounded the statue of Josiah Shermer. On the swing next to him was the greasy haired loser, Matt Harris, and the strange pressure that was swelling up in his newly acquired bosom. Bill knew Matt, at least well enough to give the troubled youth a wide berth and at best, tell him to go away, but he couldn&#39;t leave, not with Eve in route, and he apparently couldn&#39;t do much more than just mumble a response in his tiny new voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;So yeah I just can&#39;t STAND those fuckers that walk around the school and act like they own the place. Like where the hell do THEY get off telling me what to do!?&quot; Matt swore as he rocketed back and forth, shaking the creaking metal structure each time.<br />
<br />
&quot;They, umm, they are the teachers. That&#39;s their...that&#39;s their jobs&quot; Bill muttered as he sucked in a tiny breath as he stared down at his poorly illuminated feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re over-qualified babysitters. I know fucking everything I need to know for life. We just go to school because the government has to justify making people pay taxes&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;That&#39;s not how that works at all, you dickhead Matt&#39; Bill&#39;s brain muttered, but the feminized, two years younger eighteen year old male&#39;s mouth said nothing as Matt&#39;s momentum on the swing&#39;s frame moved his own swing back and forth. Why was he acting so weird, and where the fuck was Eve!? Bill gazed out into the darkness, searching for a pair of headlights.<br />
<br />
The Josiah Shermer memorial park was little more than a decorative pocket of grass wedged between the new city hall building, the post office and the DMV, and a couple of apartment buildings. Outside of the swings and the small playground (which now just included the swings and a plastic slide, the merry-go-round, sandbox and the spring mounted horses having been carted off years ago for being &#39;unsafe&#39;), the rest of the park was just a walking path and a couple of benches and some decorative street lights that did little more than emit a dim glow.<br />
<br />
That had been where Bill had started. He&#39;d sneaked down the streets of late-night Shermer with little difficulty, only dodging one police car as it had slowly rolled down the street. She&#39;d...He&#39;d been remarkably lucky to not encounter any weirdos or assholes the entire trip and had plopped his plump rear down on a park bench to wait for Eve to show up and let him get out of this madness. He&#39;d felt a sense of pride and achievement for making it this whole way, as well as a thrill of excitement at doing something so risky...But that had been, of course, when hubris had walked up and slapped his newly adorkable face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Willow!&quot; A voice had called out from the darkness, and before Bill could even respond, the gangly form of Matt plopping himself down uninvited next to him. &quot;Wow, you&#39;re NEVER out this late! Is it because of what happened at the gym?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy crackers!&quot; Bill had squeaked in alarm, jumping up from the bench and his hands fumbling against his pockets for the small pocket knife, but suddenly his coordination just wasn&#39;t there. His heart began pounding against the backside of his boobs and the heat of his breath created a small cloud of vapor as he stood there, little more than a shaking mess.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah, it&#39;s just me, Wills! It&#39;s just your Matt!&quot; The black haired teen laughed back, his eyes locked squarely on the bumps pushing through the fabric of Bill&#39;s sweater. &quot;Heh, &#39;holy crackers&#39;? You kiss your mom with that mouth?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Who is Matt? Wait...Oh hell, that&#39;s Matt Harris!&#39; Bill&#39;s brain responded as it flipped through the mental notes he&#39;d compiled from Willow&#39;s Facebook and phone. This was that loser that was in several pictures of Willow and Paige, and was clearly who the earlier text conversation was about. Bill knew enough about the younger kid (who he was now the same age) to stay away from him. He wasn&#39;t a threat like Rob was or Big Jon had been before becoming Joanna...Or like any of the other scum at Shermer High, but Matt was just an annoying little prick that was clearly struggling with puberty even this many years on, swore like a sailor in every conversation and seemed to just leak body oil. Matt was whiny and angry and was seeing some kind of a shrink and those that didn&#39;t hate his guts were scared that he&#39;d turn into some school shooter if provoked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, um...hi, Matt?&quot; Bill had responded meekly, giving a tiny wave with a tiny, shaking hand, &quot;What...What are you doing out here? It&#39;s, like, really late!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Says the girl that keeps turning me down for dates because she &#39;has to get home for curfew&#39;, heh. I&#39;m just out walking. So what happened at the gym? I saw you leave a couple minutes after you got there, those fucking bitches tell you to fuck off?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bill&#39;s cheeks flushed with heat and he pushed a strand of curly brown hair behind an ear, &quot;I...They said that, um...I...&quot; Bill&#39;s brain struggled to pull up the response he&#39;d told Paige earlier, his act of sobbing Polly-Anna hysterics failing to summon on command.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah whatever. You don&#39;t need those bitches anyway. Buncha shitheads, even if they are all really hot. Like Joanna Ingerman. I&#39;d love to just motorboat her&quot;<br />
<br />
Bill felt a confusing rush of emotions. Two of which he knew right away, anger and sadness, but the third one...felt weird and he couldn&#39;t place it. So instead he just nodded and looked at his feet and tried to make himself stop shaking. And...Wait, why did this greasy haired loser know about what happened at the gym?<br />
<br />
&quot;Matt y-you&#39;re not...&quot; Bill tried to force out, his Willow voice shaking and uneven, torn between his teeth chattering and a odd sniffle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh man, you look really cold! Well I, uh, you&#39;re really hot but I mean you&#39;re hot but cold y&#39;know? Here let&#39;s go swing! That&#39;ll help!&quot; Matt had lurched up from the bench and grabbed Bill&#39;s hand, causing another surge or emotions, mostly alarm, as the unwanted chaperone pulled him towards the rusty swings on the far side of the memorial park. Bill squeaked in pain but Matt didn&#39;t seem to notice, the boy already talking a mile a minute about something involving getting in trouble at school earlier in the day.<br />
<br />
Before Bill had realized it, he and Matt were on the swings. Boy and girl. Sitting next to each other in the misty late-night illuminated by the nearby lights.<br />
<br />
If Bill hadn&#39;t known better, he could have sworn part of his brain was trying to convince him that it was &#39;romantic&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;-then I had to tell my mom and dad, who then got on my case. And then I had to tell Doc Gold about it and HE started rambling about &#39;misplaced aggression&#39; like he always does and its like you know I&#39;ve been doing better its just small steps you know?&quot; Matt rambled as he suddenly launched himself out of the swing with a laugh, causing Bill to gasp in surprise as the teen went sailing into the dim-darkness and skidding to a stop on the wet grass, his guffaw having trouble deciding if it wanted to be deep or high pitched.<br />
<br />
&quot;SHHH! Matt, you&#39;ll make us get caught!&quot; Bill hissed as Matt made his way back to the swing. This wasn&#39;t ideal but the LAST thing he needed was for this...this...this butthead to bring a cop down on them and then Bill would NEVER get to change back and be stuck like this forever.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, like there&#39;s anyone around, Wills! The piggies don&#39;t fucking care, they just leave me alone anyway. They think I&#39;m part of that Rob fucker&#39;s gang!&quot; Matt said as he slung himself back into the empty swing&#39;s seat, &quot;It&#39;s &#39;cuz they&#39;re always fucking picking on me though. Another bunch of fuckers I&#39;d make pay if I ever could. Make them see what it&#39;s like to...to just...ARGH I HATE HOW WRONG THIS FEELS!&quot; Matt growled.<br />
<br />
Bill just blinked and stared at the other teen, who bent over and put his head in his hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y&#39;just don&#39;t know, Wills. I hate being me&quot; Matt&#39;s voice was low and muffled, &quot;My parents hate me. The teachers hate me. Paige hates me. You&#39;re the only...The only person in my life that makes things feel okay. Like when I&#39;m around you It&#39;s just easier. Like we&#39;re...You know, destined, maybe?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your parents don&#39;t hate yo-&quot; Bill said, reaching out and putting a hand on Matt&#39;s shoulder without realizing it, before recoiling back as Matt shot upright once more, facing him with eyes that looked...dark. Even with the shadows and low light conditions Bill could see that Matt was crying.<br />
<br />
&quot;They DO. They only take care of me because they feel like they&#39;re required to. Like right now, you think any caring parent would let their only child wander around town in the middle of the night? They LIKE it when I&#39;m not at home. They HATE paying for Doc Gold. They wanna send me off to some boarding school but can&#39;t afford it. They wish I was like Tom Ackerton and was good at sports. The list just goes on and on. And I KNOW that this isn&#39;t the life I was supposed to have, I have these...these dreams! Like where everything is perfect and I&#39;m the star player at school and you&#39;re my hot cheerleader girlfriend and we&#39;re not these pathetic losers! I just...I just want to be happy. Happy with you. You&#39;re...You&#39;re my dream, Willow&quot;<br />
<br />
Bill felt his heart pounding behind his chest and a lot of really...weird feelings clogging up his already weird mental state. There was a flash of light that washed over them from the edge of Bill&#39;s periphery vision, and before Bill knew what was happening...<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
Eugene sat in the warm confines of Eve&#39;s car as he pulled into one of the handful of parking spaces that ringed the memorial park, staring at the scene in front of him, his full lips parted in surprise as he&#39;d arrived just in time to see Willow, or rather, Bill who was equally trapped as a high school girl like he was, lean in to kiss some dark-haired boy on the park swings.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw&quot; He muttered after a moment. He decided he wouldn&#39;t interrupt the two, momentarily forgetting that a driving force of this plan was Eugene&#39;s guilt at having accidentally changed Bill and robbing him of his girlfriend.</p>
