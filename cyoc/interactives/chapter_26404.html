<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">One thing that had always separated Jennifer from her friends was her appreciation for steak. She love any type of steak, but her favorite was just straight-up unflavored steak. She even preferred it without any type of sauce. This is what she finally settled on.<br />
<br />
After a filling half-pound steak Jennifer decided to sit on the couch and watch some TV as she digested. She had cheer-leading practice in a few hours and she didn't want to feel so full during her mid-air flips! Yuck!<br />
<br />
After a few minutes of flipping through the channels her skirt began to feel tight. She unbuttoned the clasp to relieve the pressure. After a few more minute the pressure returned and this time it began to get more painful. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ooo, that steak was more filling than I expected!&quot; But when she looked down she was greeted with a horrifying sight!<br />
<br />
It wasn't her stomach that had been pushing against her skirt but there was now a fleshy mound swelling out beneath her abdomen. She watched in absolute shock as it continued to grow. Soon it had reached the size of a soccer ball and it was beginning to strain against her skirt and thong. But the new tender flesh soon ripped these as it continued to balloon out between her legs.<br />
<br />
Jennifer then remembered the curse from this mourning and then she put two and two together as she remembered the steak and she could see teats forming at the end of her new... &quot;UDDER!!! I don't want and udder!!!&quot; But just as her new udder neared completion she began to feel a similar sensation in her hands and chest.<br />
<br />
She could feel her breasts begin to slowly get bigger. &quot;What the heck is happening to me! As her top began to get tighter and tighter she decided to forgo modesty to avoid losing her top and bra as she had her skirt. But when she reached up she was shocked by her hands.<br />
<br />
Her thumbs had completely disappeared! Not only that, but her remaining fingers had begun to fuse together. Her fingernails were also turning black and by now had engulfed the entire tips of her fingers. Soon she was left with only two large digits at the end of each hand tipped by black hoof-like material.<br />
<br />
She clawed at her top trying to relieve the pressure but she couldn't get ahold of the material without her thumbs! Soon the pressure was too much and the top burst open! What feel out of her top could no longer be called human breasts. Her once enviable assets had swollen grotesquely and had grown four teats at the end of each. She could feel large amounts of liquid sloshing around inside them as she felt them with her hoof-hands. Then she was shocked when her fingers felt two more mounds beneath the top two. Craning her neck to the side she was able to see that she had grown two more udders beneath the ones on her chest but these were only about 2/3's the size of the ones above them.<br />
<br />
She was tired from her changes and was hoping that they were finally over, only to be greeted by a pain now in her face and head causing her to sweat profusely. She began to gag and drool uncontrollably down her front and the pain in her face grew. Her nose flattened and grew dark and moist as she licked it with her elongating tongue. Her thickening tongue soon took up her entire mouth as she gaged forcing her to take large huffing breaths through her larger nose. Her ears felt like someone was trying to pull them off her head as they stretched and became covered in a light white fur. Her jaw pushed out ever-so-slightly ans her teeth flattened a bit just enough to form a cute half muzzle and to accommodate her thicker tongue. <br />
<br />
During this ordeal a long white and brown tail had snaked out of her spine and her toenails turned black. Her legs also became a bit more muscular to accomidate the anticipated increase in her weight. As a final touch a light coating of white fuzz covered her body leaving a few light brown patches here and there.<br />
<br />
She fell to the floor onto her hands and knees as the change finally halted. She coughed up a large quantity of phlegm as her body adjusted to her new muzzle and she continued to pant through her nose and mouth, huffing with each breath like some huge animal as her body tried to cool itself down. Slowly but surely the panting abated and she began to take in her situation. The first thing that she noticed was the full felling in her five udders. There babies had grown in primed and ready to produce milk which was precisely what they were trying to do. However, the milk was being produced, but it had nowhere to go. Jennifer could strangely feel the milk in her udders welling up and she knew she was going to have to do something about it soon.<br />
<br />
But currently she had something else in mind! Kyle! She would get revenge on that freak if it was the last thing she did!</p>
