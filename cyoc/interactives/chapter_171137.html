<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In the end, Alina was sent to the facility. Nothing her father said would ever have convince the envoys, who were trained that their job wasn&#39;t to negotiate whether or not the girl would be taken, but to just take her by any means, although it was heavily stressed to be done peacefully if possible. But in the end, they were not leaving without their target, even if that meant someone ending up in a hospital bed. So, her father caved in the moment they threatened that if he didn&#39;t hand her over, they would start to get violent. However he did try and slip a few bucks to one of the envoys in order to try and bribe them to send her back to his home, or to at least set her up with a partner from the neighborhood. The envoy just accepted the cash and grinned, saying only that he will be sure to &quot;pass on the message&quot;, and went with the rest to get Alina.<br />
<br />
When the envoys grabbed her, they locked her hands in a special cuff which went up past her wrists. The cuff pushed her forearms together and ended above her fists in a 3 inch diameter metal ring, which was used to secure her to the truck. The cuffs didnt hurt to wear, nor were they that heavy, but there was no escaping them once locked inside unless you had the key. Even if you smuggled a lock pick, it would be no use because the hole was between your forearms, inside a 3&quot; deep hole. Only with a special tool could you unlock the cuffs. <br />
<br />
This was the first stage if her &quot;training&quot;. It was not an official part of the so-called &quot;process&quot;, but was nicknamed &quot;stage 0&quot;. The cuffs really hammered in the first of many nails. Women were dependent on men. If a woman needed something, then she would need to rely on her male partner for assistance. Of course the cuffs were only for transport,  and would be removed after they entered the facility, but the message was clear enough. &quot;Try your best to become likeable to at least one of the men in the facility, or you will not last long.&quot;<br />
<br />
Only after they entered the facility&#39;s property through a double layered, barb wire topped, ring of concrete walls, did Alina see the building she would be calling home for some time. But unlike the hospital-like structure she saw commonly displayed in pamphlets and advertising, in actuality, the building more closely resembled a large warehouse complex. Actually upon further inspection, it almost looked like one of those personal storage sites where people can rent a space to keep their excess items, only with a single massive building in the center. <br />
<br />
As the truck made its way to the center, she passed by a massive open field, where it looked like cows horses, and other various farm animals were grazing. Alina guessed that was where a lot of their food would come from. She had learned that when the facility was created, they had a goal to become entirely self sustaining so as to minimize any chance of interference from the outside world. <br />
<br />
Inside the truck, there were around 30 or so other girls, however not a single one was speaking. It was an eerie silence, but Alina didn&#39;t mind it that much because at least had a window seat to distract her. Plus since her cuffs were secured between her legs, she had been slowly rubbing herself up and down against the metal ring for the last 20 minutes, enjoying the subtle pleasure it brought her, while trying to not draw any unnecessary attention to herself. <br />
<br />
When the truck stopped next to a large bay door, the back opened up and a man pulled down on a switch, which unlocked all of the cuffs from the truck&#39;s seats. Well, all of the but Alina&#39;s. Her cuff was still tightly secured to her seat. As the other girls filed out of the truck, not a dingle person said a word, or even acknowledged the lone girl left behind. Alina wasn&#39;t sure what was going on, but was now too nervous to speak up and ask anyone about it. <br />
<br />
When the truck was empty of all other girls, did 1 of the envoys hop back in and walk up to her with a grin. He pulled out the money her father had bribed him with and began counting. &quot;$3,500 for a single bitch? Damn you Daddy must have been an idiot. But I guess he has paid more than enough for you to be part of our special cases group. It really is a shame though, you would have become quite an amazing housewife too. I may have even taken you for myself. Your are just my type too. Ah well, the money is just as good. Hey, maybe I will still buy you after your conversion therapy. I did just come by some extra cash recently and all&quot; said the envoy while he flashed the money to Alina. <br />
<br />
&quot;Name&#39;s Ethan by the way, and I am to be your handler from here on. Now lets get a good look at cha&#39;. Hmm, kinda small up top, but still thicc as all hell with an nice ass to boot. What, were you some kind of gymnast or somethin&#39;? No wait, it was soccar player right? I remember now that your Dad had been sayin&#39; something&#39; about it; how you would become some kind of super star soccar player. Well, would be isn&#39;t really applicable anymore. More like could have been, as the only balls you will likely be handlin&#39; are your mate&#39;s. Anyways you check out, so lets get you to your new home. Don&#39;t worry though, it is a nice place. Warm, cozy, and you are actually taken care of as a priority. For the men who work here, your own comfort is actually above their own in a sense. Well, you get what I mean in a bit. Now then, let&#39;s introduce you to your personal team of conversion therapy experts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan unlocked her cuffs and lead her out of the truck, where a team of 5 were standing in wait. 4 men and to Alina&#39;s surprise, 1 women. However there was something off about the women, but Alina couldn&#39;t quite determine what it was. She was a massive beast of a human though. Fat would be an understatement. Her back was arched to the extreme, creating almost a &quot;C&quot; shape, with her ass actually sticking up higher than the small of her back. She wore clothing which somehow managed to cover every inch of her body too. A feat which seemed impossible for normal clothing, but it woukd seem her&#39;s were all custom made. The moment Alina stepped out, the men began introducing themselves one by one, but only gave their first names. <br />
<br />
-Dr. Jim, would be her physical therapist and care taker.<br />
-Dr. Matt, would be her nutritionist and trainer.<br />
-Dr. Kyle, was her neurologist and tutor.<br />
-Dr. Lee, would be her surgeon, physician, and gynecologist.<br />
-Ethan, would be both her, and her team&#39;s handler, and likely her future husband from what it sounded like a few moments ago. At least he was slightly handsom, although no where near the &quot;makes her want to drop her panties and fuck him on the spot&quot; level. But he was still fairly good looking, and seemed to be somewhat friendly with her, almost as if he was actually being nice to her.<br />
<br />
The girl said nothing though. She just stood there. And while she was still shorter than any of the men, she was a few inches taller than Alina, which made her sonehow feel more imposing. It was Ethan who spoke up first after the men finished their introductions, seeming to ignore the point that neither girl had been introduced yet. &quot;Now then, this is your team, and here is your home. Building code ID# R4-NC-H, though we all just call this place &quot;The Ranch&quot;. This here is the buildin&#39; that handles all of the agricultural work, as well as one of 5 research centers, where girls who are given the &quot;special cases&quot; monicur get sent to. I.E. all of the girls whose parents tried to bribe the envoys, wnd up in one of these centers&quot; Ethan said, distributing $700 dollars to each of the 4 doctors while also keeping an equal portion of it for himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, if it is this much, then I am afraid we have prepared the wrong girl to showcase to our newest addition&quot; said Dr. Matt. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, Alina here is actually a smart girl. She should be able to figure it out. That being said, she is actually going to be a special case, as she is going to become mine. So treat this as a more personal case if you will. I would appreciate it if she wasn&#39;t damaged or mentally broken like some of the others end up&quot; continued Ethan,  which seemed to have an effect on the others. &quot;If it is for you Ethan, then we will be extra careful&quot;. Said Dr. Jim. &quot;Can&#39;t believe Ethan finally was able to find his replacement. Its been what? 2 years?&quot; Added Dr. Kyle.<br />
<br />
It was Dr. Lee who finally addressed Alina. &quot;So then, Alina was it? Let me show you something. See this woman next to me? While she isn&#39;t anything like whay we have planned for you, maybe you at least can get an idea from what you see&quot; he said. And to Alina&#39;s surprize, he rips off all of the woman&#39;s clothing with a single tug on a strap Alina hadn&#39;t seen before until now. But she couldn&#39;t even ponder about it for a second because of what she saw next. The fat woman was not fat at all. Or rather, she only looked fat because her entire body from below her neck was covered in chicken feathers. Even her arms and hands resembled wings more so than their normal human shape. The reason her ass was bent upwards like that was because this woman had a chicken&#39;s tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;This here is Amanda. One of our best girls here. She can lay anywhere between 40 to 60 normal, chicken egg sized eggs in a day, or 7-8 fairly larger ones, which are about the size of a football, depending on what fucked her last. Now, say hello to the new girl, Amanda&quot;. Amanda turned towards Alina and in a voice that was way more cuter than Alina anticipated, gave a cheerful greeting. &quot;Hello, a d welcome to the Ranch! As you can see, I am one of the hens here, and it is a pleasure to meet you!&quot; She said as she strutted herself over to hug Alina, pushing the girl into her feathery body. &quot;I dont get it? Everyone here seems to be really nice. It isn&#39;t at all like how it is rumored to be&quot; said Alina, who was so confused by what was going on. It was Dr. Matt&#39;s turn to speak now. &quot;Well of course it wouldn&#39;t be like the rumors. You girls are to meant to be livestock, in other words, animals. And as animals, all of you have a lot of rights and protections. So of course we would treat you all kindly. Who would want to watch animal cruelty happen right in front of them after all?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait I am going to become livestock? Like actually turned into an animal like Amanda is?&quot; Asked Alina. &quot;Well not exactly like her, but yes you will. We will make you somewhere between 51%-90% animal, always leaving your face untouched, though that is not necessarily true about the rest of your head, like ears and such. How much you turn is not in our hands, it is how susceptible you are to the initial drug and following treatments. But on the fun side, since your father so generously donated several thousand to the cause, you actually get to become the farm animal of your own choosing&quot; explained Ethan, placing his hands on Alina&#39;s shoulders to try and comfort her. &quot;We currently have only a few options to pick from, and all of which are the usual farm animals so far, so the selection is a bit limited, but there should be somethin&#39; that you like. Obviously, you could choose to become a hen (chicken), just like Amanda here. In this case you would become her room mate and share a rooster too. But fair warning, this option doesn&#39;t get out much for long periods of time. So if you do not like being nest bound, and when not, just limited to the area inside of your room, for months on end while you are laying your eggs, then you could choose to become our newest...&quot;</p>
