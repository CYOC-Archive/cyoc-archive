<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">           Just like how Master Harauphar said at the crack of dawn he returned. You had been waiting patiently on the rooftop, with Mrs. Harauphar and Sara getting to the points of exhaustion. <br />
<br />
         By the time your Master had returned Sara had already been in a deep sleep with her mother being close behind. Then coming out of the forest was Master Harauphar. Unlike when he had left, he wore a dark robe unfit for traveling and carried a large satchel that you noticed seemed to have a strange aura around it.<br />
<br />
         As he approached the gate, you jumped down to meet him.<br />
<br />
     &quot;Hello Master Harauphar, welcome back from your trip, I trust everything went alright?&quot; You ask<br />
<br />
    &quot;Yes, I see my family has arrived and you followed your orders to not let them in.&quot; He said motioning to the now waking Mrs Harauphar and Sara as they heard his voice.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Yes, your Lady Lyaa was a bit... confused shall we say about not being allowed in but other than that, there have been no other visitors.&quot;<br />
<br />
     &quot;Very well, thank you Wraith, you may go inside now, I will speak with my briefly family and we will be able to properly introduce you inside as well.&quot; Master Harauphar said before turning to his approaching wife.<br />
<br />
    You head inside, going through a small rabbit hole leading inside than actually opening the door  and lay down by the warm fireplace, waiting for you Master&#39;s family to enter.<br />
<br />
      When they do enter, you see that they were already in a small argument themselves. <br />
<br />
    &quot;I don&#39;t understand, I know you dabble in the more.... misunderstood magics and you work for a local Lord, yet you&#39;ve never been so secretive about your projects before. Every time I ask you about your life you shrug it off!&quot; Mrs. Harauphar said quietly, not wanting to stir the still sleeping Sara being carried by her mother.<br />
<br />
      &quot;Lyaa, like you said before, the magic I specialize in is not for the faint of heart,  I simply do not wish to expose you to things such as this. Especially not now, when I&#39;m currently expending all of my resources in what could be the greatest project in my life.&quot; Master Harauphar said.<br />
<br />
          You didn&#39;t wish to eavesdrop but your ears perked up at your Master&#39;s mention of his &quot;project&quot;. He hadn&#39;t mentioned one before but you did want to ask him it&#39;s details later. A small part of your mind even wondered if this project was the reason he wanted another familiar?<br />
<br />
      &quot;The greatest project in your life? See? I never even heard about that until now! Just tell me when all this secrecy will end won&#39;t you?&quot; Lyaa said, unable to stop her voice from getting louder.<br />
<br />
      &quot;Alright Lyaa, I will, just bear with me. Let us not spoil the mood now. I still haven&#39;t properly introduced you and Sara to my new familiar.&quot;<br />
Master Harauphar said.<br />
<br />
<br />
     At his words you rise up, making sure your fur is properly brushed before moving up to your Master&#39;s wife.<br />
<br />
       &quot;Hello, Lady Lyaa, once again I apologize for not allowing you to enter this residence, I do hope that our relationship will be able to become more cooperative in the near future.&quot; You say<br />
<br />
   Lyaa nods &quot;Yes, I myself apologize as well for being rude when we first met. I am Lyaa Harauphar of Bettsworth and seventyfifth in line for the throne.&quot; She says, a slight hint of arrogance in her voice as she literally looks down on you.<br />
<br />
        &quot;In line for the throne? You are royalty?&quot; You ask, curiousity in your voice.<br />
<br />
     &quot;Well yes, I am actually related to Lord Hugenstore, the same Lord who my husband works for.&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;Well then, It is a pleasure to meet you then.&quot; <br />
<br />
      &quot;Likewise, however you still haven&#39;t properly  met my daughter. Though she seems asleep so I will put her to bed before anything.&quot; She says, nodding to her husband and going to another room. <br />
<br />
      Looking to your master you ask &quot;Master Harauphar, I do not wish to pry, but what is this &quot;project&quot; you mentioned to Lady Lyaa?&quot;<br />
<br />
       Master Harauphar sits down on a chair, sighing in relief, resting his satchel on a table causing a large thud in the process.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Yes, I do not mind your eavesdropping since it shows if your curiousity, but be sure to be polite about it.&quot; He says, causing you to nod respectfully as he continues. &quot;My project is actually the reason I acquired you in the first place, a sorcerer can greatly increase his power through the use of a familiar and My project will require everything I can give it.&quot;<br />
<br />
     &quot;What is this project itself my Master?&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;You are not from this world but, you see, over three hundred and seventy five years ago, a powerful Necromancer had come into power, and was able to conquer over half of the western side of the continent using his undead army. He did so by making use of a powerful artifact called the Grim Codex. Said to be infused with the power of seven demonlords, it was a very valueable artifact indeed. However after his defeat, the Codex was lost.&quot;<br />
<br />
      &quot;Fascinating, this Grim Codex sounds amazing, however surely there is a drawback to it&#39;s power?&quot; You ask.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Correct, the drawback was that for every page opened within the Codex, there would be a chance that the reader would utterly corrupted by it&#39;s demonic energy and turn into a foul mindless monster. Mutated and distorted beyond belief, to be powerful and yet also in extreme agony for the rest of their life.&quot;<br />
<br />
      &quot;I see, but what does this Codex have to do with your project? Do you truly wish to find it?&quot;<br />
<br />
     &quot;Yes, however I do not wish to find it because of it&#39;s knowledge, the souls of a Demonlord are rare and few, and having seven who&#39;s virtually impossible. Using a magical ritual I have just recently aquired I will be able to extract the souls bound to the Grim Codex and use them for my own goals.&quot; Master Harauphar said, almost yelling it as he spoke. <br />
<br />
<br />
      Usually from your knowledge Master Harauphar wasn&#39;t much of a passionate person, yet here, he was clearly excited. His hands trembled in anticipation and you could see a strange expression that you couldn&#39;t quite tell whether it was happiness or pure insanity.<br />
<br />
       &quot;Where did you learn this ritual?&quot; <br />
<br />
    &quot;Ah.&quot; Master Harauphar says, this time more calmly and in his usual tone. Unbuttoning his satchel, he pulls out a strange old leather tone. With a symbol of a red pentagram on it&#39;s front, you felt a large amount of dark energy being omitted by it. <br />
<br />
  &quot;Do you feel it&#39;s potent energy? I had acquired this book from a archeological dog site north of Lord Hugenstore&#39;s castle, several of my colleagues had found out it contained several magical rituals previously thought to be forgotten, however I specifically requested for it and after a harsh argument was able to obtain it.&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;Interesting. Have you already studied it&#39;s contents?&quot; <br />
<br />
     &quot;No, as of now I have not acquired the chance, but tomorrow after my family leaves, we will be able to properly study it together.&quot;<br />
<br />
     &quot;Very well my Master, I will do my best in order to help you achieve your goal.&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;Alright then Wraith, we will also be able to start your magical lessons soon as well.&quot; Master Harauphar says, standing up from his chair.<br />
&quot;I have already enlisted my servant Wortox to prepare your own quarters in the attic. I will be in my room now, I have already had a long day of travel and I must rest.&quot; <br />
<br />
   With that, Master Harauphar exits the room and heads to his private bedroom. Now you are left alone in the living room. What do you do now?</p>
