<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The twins turn, looking at Ty with matching smirks, with a question seemingly on their lips. &quot;Okay... what is it, guys?&quot; Ty asks, knowing the twins wanted something else from him. <br />
<br />
Thatcher glanced at his twin, and the two seemed to share a knowing look, though Ty did not understand the meaning. &quot;I guess to answer your original question, Dalton and I would like to spend the day as conjoined twins...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But...&quot; Dalton began speaking, finishing his brother&#39;s thought. &quot;Its not quite right...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty brows knitted in confusion. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thatcher and I seem to share the body completely which is fine, I guess, but of all the research we have done...&quot; Dalton spoke, sounding surprisingly professor-like. From his tone, Ty suspected the twins had done a lot of research on the subject, which surprised him. &quot;Conjoined twins like us typically have half... split control.&quot; Dalton looked up at the ceiling, as if trying to find the right word to describe what he wanted to say. <br />
<br />
&quot;What he means...&quot; Thatcher tried explaining. He seemed to raise both arms in front of them while attempting to explain. &quot;I can move, feel, control both arms now. Of twins we are like now, I should only be able to control this arm.&quot; Demonstrating his point, the right arm dropped to Dalton&#39;s side, and Thatcher only moved the left hand. &quot;It would be kind of like we have 50/50 custody, except for the important parts...&quot; He pointed towards their waist area. &quot;It would be cool if we could share everything completely down there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... I think I can do that, but why?&quot; Ty asked, confused as two why they would request that. &quot;Wouldn&#39;t playing football, really anything, be extremely difficult?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot; Both of them spoke at once. Dalton continued, &quot;But, it is more realistic... If we are going to be conjoined twins for the day, we might as well have all of the good and the bad that goes with it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And if anything, it will really boost our teamwork.&quot; Thatcher smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... if you guys both want that.&quot; Ty said, but he was already focusing on his power. He imagined the twins as they explained it to him, that familiar sensation returning, though it peculiarly seemed to take longer to draw from within himself. Ty did not think anything of it though.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow!&quot; The twins spoke in unison again. Ty watched the twins suddenly stumble back onto the bench beside him. He reacted quick enough to catch their back, before they tumbled completely over. <br />
<br />
&quot;You could have given us a warning Ty.&quot; Dalton complained. &quot;We would have sat down or something...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Quite complaining, Dalton. He gave us exactly what we asked for.&quot; Thatcher spoke.<br />
<br />
Dalton glanced past his brother to look at Ty. &quot;Sorry, Ty.&quot; He then turned to look back his twin. &quot;Well, lets get out of here then. On three...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;One... two... three...&quot; The two spoke together as they lifted themselves off of the bench, through it was noticeably not as fluid. <br />
<br />
Ty marveled as the twins took as few, disjointed steps forward. He could not fathom why they wanted to split their body in half as it clearly seemed much more difficult to move around. A phone then buzzed on the far side of the locker room, attracting Ty&#39;s attention. He realized that it was from the locker Thatcher had been using. A second later, a buzz could be heard from the locker directly behind him. Ty turned, realizing that the second sound came from Dalton&#39;s locker. He turned back to the twins, who seemed to be equally confused. <br />
<br />
&quot;If we&#39;re conjoined twins... why do we have separate lockers, especially on different sides of the room?&quot; Thatcher asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;And would we really need two phones?&quot; Dalton added.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot; Ty was just as confused. &quot;You guys are closer to Dalton&#39;s locker. Check what is in it, and I&#39;ll check Thatcher&#39;s.&quot; Ty did not wait for either of them to reply. He walked over to the open locker, and pulled out a buzzing phone. It noted a missing call from Hazel, whom Ty recognized immediately. It was Thatcher&#39;s girlfriend. A moment later, a text popped up, &#39;We still on for mini golf?&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maeve is asking if we, me and her, are on for the movie still.&quot; Dalton spoke.<br />
<br />
Ty turned to see the twins looking over what must have been Dalton&#39;s phone. &quot;What a lame choice for a date...&quot; Thatcher commented. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up...&quot; Dalton pocketed his phone. &quot;She wanted to see a romantic comedy, so I promised a dinner and movie date.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That going to be kind of hard if Thatcher is supposed to be going mini golfing with Hazel.&quot; Ty commented as he crossed the room and handed the phone to Thatcher. Hazel and Maeve were twins, like Thatcher and Dalton were. It was always funny to see the two couples running around the campus, confusing people. Though, he was not sure how that worked out now, given Thatcher and Dalton shared a body. <br />
<br />
&quot;How are we supposed to be in two places at once Thatcher?&quot; Dalton complained. <br />
<br />
&quot;I planned that with Hazel before Ty fused us together...&quot; He paused, thinking about that statement for a moment. &quot;Wait... but if we&#39;re conjoined twins now... why do we still have two separate dates scheduled?&quot; They looked at Ty, expectantly, but Thatcher continued, &quot;Did you mess something up when you fused us together?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t look at me. You guys might not have consulted one another when scheduling your dates.&quot; Ty tried to defend himself. Though, he had his sinking suspicions that he may not have completely fused the twins&#39; lives together. <br />
<br />
The matter was quickly looked into when Dalton brought up a picture of himself and his girlfriend. His twin was not attached to him. He then scrolled through several pictures of his families last camping trip. He and his brother were never once sharing a body. &quot;Dude, why does nothing seemed to have changed, just us? I thought you... altered reality or whatever too. You said as much before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot; Ty stepped away from the twins, pacing the room. &quot;It worked just fine before...&quot; Ty though back, trying to remember if anything was different. He had felt that power, just like before. &quot;No...&quot; he wonder aloud. &quot;Am I weakening... using too much too fast...&quot; Now that he thought back, the attempts were getting harder. It was easy to change the walls of his rooms to white, but since then, it was progressively taking longer to draw on that power. While he had fused the twins together, reality did not appear to have changed with them. Now, he was concerned if he could even change them back. &quot;Uh, I think I may overestimated what I could do...&quot; Ty bit his lower lip as he turned to face the twins.</p>
