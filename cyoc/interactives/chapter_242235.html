<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">This is the four roomates branch of the Chronivac Version 4.0<br />
It is a story of four girls living in a single and same appartment. One of them will aquire the Chronivac and together will upfold multiple interactions between them all. The goal is to keep the interaction restricted to the same four character, so that they might be explored and thought of more toroughly. Here is a short presentation of the four roomates:<br />
<br />
<br />
Roomate 1: Sylviana Dis<br />
<br />
Sex and gender: <br />
<br />
Sylviana Dis identifies as a woman and has the body of a woman. She is attracted by womens, making her openly lesbian. She has a small sock fetish that ups her arousal at the sight of them. She has an average libido.<br />
<br />
Personnality:<br />
<br />
Sylviana is what we could call a ray of sunshine. She is an upbeat, optimistic and carefree individual, always ready to see the best out of situations. Unfortunately, she also comes with her bag of bad news. She is a complete airhead, as she has difficulty understanding complicated talk and has a given clumsiness. She also is rather naive and can believe lies easily. She works has a secretary in multimillionaire company (That pays most of the rent for the four roomates) in a large and tall office builiding, but she has an irredeemable fear of heights.<br />
<br />
Appearance:<br />
<br />
Sylviana is almost alway wearing her favorite oufit: A long polar-lights-colored dress that reaches her ankles, a pair of red frilled arm warmers and her favorite forest-green high-boots. She has a nice figure, standing at a average 5 foot 7 inches tall. She has respectable C-cup breasts, a rather thin waist, and some average hips. She is 23 year old. She has pink waist-length hair collected in twin tails with blue dyed locks of hair scattered around.<br />
<br />
Relationship with the three other roomates: <br />
<br />
Sylviana has shown her wonderful social abilities by forging a great friendship with all the others roomates. She managed to reach herself up the ranks of bonding even though she is the newest arrival at the roomates&#39; appartment, as she only arrived a few months back. She currently has no romantic or sexual interest in all the other roomates.<br />
<br />
<br />
Roomate 2: Tarydie Faqu<br />
<br />
Sex and gender: <br />
<br />
Tarydie Faqu identifies as a woman and has the body of a woman. She is attracted by both mens and womens, making her bisexual. She prefers to be the one dominating during sex. She has a high libido.<br />
<br />
Personnality:<br />
<br />
Tarydie is a powerful, energetic and raging bag of surprises! She acts as a leader all the time to contereact her lack of self confidence. She is a teasing piece of nightmare that allways tries to mess with people, either as a joke, or as a real injure. She is the straight-to-the-point kind of person, not hesitating a second before taking action. Her fiery personality acts has a contrast to most conversations, alway find the best way to conter the arguments of people to show her superiority. She is currently unemployed and is not seeking for a job. She has the fear of being seen as a weakling.<br />
<br />
Appearance:<br />
<br />
Tarydie never get off of her brown leather jacket and thight black jeans. Her shoes are purple and has 1 inch heels. She is quite tall, standing at a fair 6 foot 3 inches. She has a sad pair of A cup breasts that does not match with her toned abdominal waist and large hips and thights. She has fiery ginger shoulder-length hair messily scattered on her head. She is 26 year old.<br />
<br />
Relationship with the three other roomates: <br />
<br />
Tarydie oftens dislikes Sylviana&#39;s optimism, but most of the time, she brushes it off as Sylviana being her dumb self. She only says to shut her trap. She despise from the bottom of her heart Roomate 3, as she is the only one taller than Tarydie, and by a long shot. This defies her authority and that makes her always find ways to humiliate Roomate 3 in the worst possible ways. She likes Roomates 4 company, as they share a passion for sports like running. She does not have any romantic feeling for any of the roomates, but she does want to fuck some of them some times...<br />
<br />
<br />
Roomate 3: Feleyn Starn<br />
<br />
Sexual and gender:<br />
<br />
Feleyn Starn identifies as a woman and has the body of a woman. Though there is one particularity, has she have a rather long clitoris, making some call her intersex. She thought that she could not be attracted sexually, until she encountered Sylviana for the first time. She has an inhexistant libido, excepting when Sylviana is implicated, where it becomes dangerously high!<br />
<br />
Personnality:<br />
<br />
Feleyn is a shy, unsure and trembling individual. She cannot help but stutter at the first interlocution or be flushed at a simple brush. She is rather calm and composed when left alone, but ouside of her personal bubble, she becomes a complete mess. She is considered has cute by most, while others calls her awkward. She works as a writer of scripts for theater and plays (it does not pay very well). The fear of judgement lingers over her infinitly because of bullying she suffered through in her high school because of her height and her intersex feature.<br />
<br />
Appearance:<br />
<br />
Feleyn rarely leaves the appartment, so her clothes are always cozy and comfortable. She often wears cotton sweaters or baggy leggings. She does not wear shoes, leaving her bare feet. Even though her overall figure might be considered petite, her height is one of her most upstanting feature as she reach a grand total of 7 feet 4 inches! She has a small pair of B cup breasts that blends into her oversized abggy clothes, same for her large hips and thin waist. She is 20 year old, easily the youngest of the roomates.<br />
<br />
Relationship with the three other roomates: <br />
<br />
Feleyn has a secret crush on Sylviana, even though she doesn&#39;t hide it very well, as she pants and muffle her moans when she talks to her secret lover, Sylviana seems completely oblivious and unaware of Feleyn&#39;s feelings. Feleyn prefer it that way, as she does not want to break the fragile bond of friendship that has formed between them with her feelings. But sometimes, she can&#39;t help herself and need relief for seeing her secret crush (If you know what I mean). Feleyn thought that bullying ended with highschool, but she ended up with the baddest bullies of all: Tarydie. She is alway bothered by the boiling sack of lava that is her roomate. She is, pranked, joked on, mentally and sometimes physically hurt by Tarydie&#39;s actions. Feleyn and Roomate 4 are not very closed, as they are limited to mere acquaintance. She has of only romantic and sexual interest Sylviana.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Roomate 4: Xyrde Telemano<br />
<br />
Sexual and gender: Xyrde identifies as a woman and has the body of an androgynous man, which mean that Xyrde has male genitals, looks like someone that could pass as both genders, and identifies as a woman. She is attracted by womens, making her lesbian. She does not have sexual preferences.<br />
<br />
Personnality:<br />
<br />
Xyrde is a blunt, intellectual and calculated individual. She is often found doing her best to maintains her health and studying various matters. She is both kind of small and imposing has she as an oppressing and powerful attitude. If you do not anger her, she might stay silently with you and pass time together. If you do anger her, prepare for a rather long lecture. She has difficulty understanding human emotions, as of why she doesn&#39;t understand when people get sad because of her bluntness. She is working has a architect right now, but she has a lot of other diplomas to choose from.<br />
<br />
Appearance:<br />
<br />
Xyrde oftens wear formal office clothes even though her work barely occupy anything remotely close to an office. She wears correcting glasses on her face. Her body is androgynous, so her breasts are non-existent, her hips are average and the same goes for her waist. She has a male genitalia, but it does not seem to bother her in the slightest even though she identifies as a woman. She is kind of small, only reaching 5 foot 3 inches. She is 25 year old.<br />
<br />
Relationship with the three other roomates: <br />
<br />
Xyrde likes Sylviana&#39;s optimism, but dislikes her stupidity. Xyrde likes passing time with Tarydie since they both care for their physical health. And she is barely an acquaintance with Feleyn, so they don&#39;t talk much unless during a group gathering.<br />
