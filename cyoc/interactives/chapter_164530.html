<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I’m the reason Moonlight Studios is as big as it is today. I remember way back when it was just me and Adam, making homemade films in my garage. We’d use whatever we could find for props and sets. Luckily, because of my gifts, we didn’t need to splash out on costumes and make-up. In fact, my abilities are why we’re so successful.<br />
<br />
Now, Moonlight Studios has become a multi-billion dollar corporation, with an endless stream of films releasing like a cinematic assembly line. I’m working more than ever, with an ever-decreasing. Budget. I’m not  complaining though. The now giant studio means I get to use my powers more often.<br />
<br />
I first met Chris on the first day of shooting Blood Cannon 3. Polite, well-spoken, but surprisingly small, no less than 5’5”. The character of Brax Mortis was everything he wasn’t. Still, I ushered him into my trailer. I could see the excitement just pour from his face. He couldn’t stop talking as he stripped to his boxers.<br />
<br />
“I’m such a big fan of your work. It’s an honour to be a part of it.”<br />
“I’m glad to hear that. Now, are you ready?”<br />
“As ready as I’ll ever be!”<br />
<br />
I picked up a file from my coffee table. Inside it was a vague description of the character, along with a well-drawn picture. I read the description aloud.<br />
<br />
“‘As the slayer of the Chakran, Brax is the epitome of masculinity, and therefore Chris should look as such. He needs to look as if he could bench press a building, and take on an endless horde of bloodthirsty creatures. Make sure he can appeal to the female demographic as well.’ Here’s a picture of what you’ll look like.”<br />
“Woah!”<br />
<br />
Chris adjusted his boxers as he stared at the drawing. I don’t blame him for being turned on. It was clear his eagerness was impeding his professionalism. Usually we hire people who are experienced with this. Chris must be another way for Adam to cut costs.<br />
<br />
“He looks amazing! So how does this work? Do you change all of me at once?”<br />
“When it’s a change this drastic, I prefer taking it slow. We don’t want you feeling overwhelmed by it all. Now, let’s see here…’epitome of masculinity…’”<br />
<br />
This is where I have creative control. Like a sculptor, I play around with what the character would look like before I settle on a final design. I used to wave my hands as I changed them, if course, doing this all day, every day, does take the fun out of it. First I needed to boost Chris’ testosterone levels. I heard his voice let out a deep breathe as he cupped his crotch, which ballooned under his hands. The bulge in his boxers was considerably larger. He was beginning to turn red with embarrassment as he tried and failed to hide his boner under his hands.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, I don’t know what’s coming over me.”<br />
“It’s ok if you’re turned on. Most people are when I do this.”<br />
“Really? Oooooh…”<br />
<br />
His body began to flood with hormones. He gasped aloud as stubble grew across his jaw, which now looked a lot more square. He looked slightly panicked.<br />
<br />
“How are you feeling?”<br />
“I feel-WOAH!”<br />
<br />
He quickly clutched his neck, stroking his new Adam’s apple. He laughed in amazement.<br />
<br />
“That’s my voice!?”<br />
“That’s Brax’s voice. Remember, you won’t look like that forever.”<br />
“Yeah I know. It’s still fun though! What’s next?”<br />
<br />
It was quite refreshing to see someone enjoy changing as much as him. I stared intently. Chris’ limbs thickened with muscle. His chest puffed out with two large pecs, and a rippling ocean of abs underneath. He couldn’t resist flexing his biceps, as he stared at his new frame in the mirror. His cock was harder than ever, pointing straight out from his crotch. Once everything was nearly finished, he stood there, completely in awe of how he now looked.<br />
<br />
“Jesus! I’m huge!”<br />
“We’re not finished yet.”<br />
“We’re not?”<br />
“We still need to adjust the height.”<br />
“The height?!”<br />
“Yeah. I’m guessing Brax is around 6’9”, maybe 6’10””<br />
“OHHH FUCK-“<br />
<br />
As Chris watched his already large body grow closer to the roof of the trailer, I notice a large wet patch formed in his boxers. Fuck, maybe I went a bit too overboard, especially for someone as young as him. There was no point turning back now, and so I continued to grow him until he reached Brax’s height of 6’10”. Chris began breathing heavily, resisting the urge to jerk off.<br />
<br />
“How do you feel now?”<br />
“I feel….I don’t know, it feels-“<br />
“Do you feel any sort of discomfort?”<br />
“Well, I uhhh-“<br />
<br />
I could hear the fabric of his underwear stretch as his cock throbbed.<br />
<br />
“I’m…I look just like him. So huge….Oh God, Im sorry! I don’t know why I’m so horny.”<br />
“Let me help you with that.”<br />
“What? I-OH FUCK!”<br />
<br />
I watched as his cock swelled in size, causing his boxers to burst open. There, Chris took the lead as he frantically pumped his shaft with his hands. The pure ecstasy that flooded his veins was almost too much for him, as he howled with pleasure. The trailer rattled from his deep, rumbling voice. I couldn’t help but smile. That’ll teach Adam for going cheap on the actors. Knowing what was about to cum next, I hastily exited the trailer, only to be met by the man himself. He spoke with an annoyed tone.<br />
<br />
“So, when will Brax be ready?”<br />
“He’s gonna need some time to adjust.”<br />
<br />
Even from the outside you could hear Chris’ animalistic grunts, his huge frame rocking the trailer. A thick stream of cum shot onto the windows, and yet that didn’t subside his hormonal rage. Adam sighed.<br />
<br />
“I told you to take it slow with him.”<br />
“What do you expect when you want me to turn a 19 year-old boy into the ‘epitome of masculinity’. This is what happens when you hire people who aren’t experienced in changing!”<br />
“It could be hours before he’s calmed down. Do you realise how much it costs to delay things?!”<br />
“Probably not as much as hiring a costume and make-up department.”<br />
“Whatever, you’re needed on Studio 6.”<br />
“It better not be another newbie.”<br />
“I’m sure you’ll make it work.”<br />
<br />
I stormed past the trailer as Chris shot another load. I boosted his testosterone levels again, making the man even hornier, just to spite Adam. The boy was gonna be there all day and, as a result, so was Adam.</p>
