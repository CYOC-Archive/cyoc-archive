<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Ok, who needs a bath today?&quot; asked Evelyn, looking at the shampoo bottles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gerta&#39;s been smelling pretty ripe lately,&quot; said Adam.<br />
<br />
Evelyn gagged and said, &quot;You get her this time. I had to wash her last time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know that Gerta&#39;s sweet-tempered,&quot; said Adam.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, she isn&#39;t sweet-smelling,&quot; said Evelyn.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the point of giving her a bath,&quot; said Adam.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it&#39;s not me that&#39;s bathing her this time,&quot; said Evelyn, &quot;You&#39;re giving her the scrub-down this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But-&quot; said Adam only for Evelyn to give him a hardened look, &quot;Alright, fine.&quot; Adam grabbed a shampoo bottle and walked out towards the barn.<br />
<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t too hard to find Gerta. The white milk goat was rubbing her horns against the walls of her pen. Adam had noticed that the she-goat had been acting odd as of late, prone to jumping around and bleating more than usual. He was pretty certain she was going into heat again. That would be irritating for a number of reason, one of them being that a goat in heat for some reason found the scent of human body odor irresistible. And an over-affectionate goat can get really annoying really quick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come here, Gerta,&quot; said Adam with a sigh. The white goat quickly ambled over to Adam and started rubbing her head against his legs. Adam sighed and scratched Gerta between her horns. It was a lot easier getting milk out of a goat that was willing to cooperate than one that was ornery. In an odd way, Gerta was less stubborn than Evelyn. But Evelyn did have a point about Gerta smelling pretty bad, but Adam had a stronger tolerance to the scent of farm animals than Evelyn did.<br />
<br />
It was a simple matter to tie a lead around Gerta&#39;s neck and the other end to a fence post. After that, it was just a matter of getting the hose running and getting her soapy. Tying up Gerta wasn&#39;t because she&#39;d run away from a bath. The problem was that Gerta was really hard to kept still. She kept bouncing in place and nuzzling up against Adam that pretty soon he was covered in as much water and suds as the goat. &quot;Why did she have to be in heat now?&quot; grumbled Adam as he removed his shirt. It was actually a good day to be working without a shirt on. The sun was shining brightly and warmly and there was a cool breeze to keep it from being overbearing. It was so nice that Adam decided to take off his socks and shoes to allow the grass between his toes. A drowsiness started to affect him, dulling his mind a bit. Why not enjoy the pleasant day for a while. Gerta wasn&#39;t about to go anywhere with that lead around her neck. Adam sat down and leaned his back against a fence post. Nobody would mind a little relaxation.<br />
<br />
Adam allowed his mind to wander, not focusing on anything in particular. It was just that kind of day for watching the clouds roll by. In his half-dozing state of mind, he was unaware of the changes occurring with his body. The body hair that was scattered across his body was spreading further than it usually did and was getting much thicker. The toes that he was allow the grass to pass between were shifting, become harder and tougher as his foot rearranged to put more pressure on them when standing. His ears started stretching out, forming points as the thickening hair on his head parted by two hard nubs emerging from his scalp.<br />
<br />
Just then, Adam was brought out of his daydreaming by something butting against his shoulder. He looked to see Gerta standing next to him, somehow having gotten loose of her lead. She seemed different than before, bulkier in frame. Her limbs seemed to have doubled in length and she was practically standing on her back knees. Her udder had moved to the middle of her belly and seemed to be spreading to the sides, her teats noticeably shorter than before. Once Gerta could see she had Adam&#39;s attention, she waddled around, her quadrupedal movement more clumsy than before, and presented her rear to him. Gerta&#39;s rear had very noticeably changed in shape. Fat tissue had gathered on her hips and buttocks, rounding them out quite a bit. Her anus and vagina had also moved away from each other considerably with her vagina almost facing her front. In fact, asides from the white fur and the goat&#39;s tail above the cheeks, it looked very near to a woman&#39;s ass.<br />
<br />
Adam blinked as he stared at Gerta&#39;s rear, not knowing that his pupils had changed into horizontal rectangles. The shape of Gerta&#39;s rear was very appealing to him, causing his pants to tent hard. A delicious scent was wafting from Gerta, awakening a primal instinct in Adam. This she-goat was definitely in heat and she needed a billy goat to mate with her. He barely realized what he was doing as he fumbled with his pants and started pulling them and his underwear down. His penis sprang out immediately, almost completely hircine in shape. The lowered pants also revealed a brown goat&#39;s tail that swished with excitement. Once Adam had the last of his clothing off, he approached Gerta, his new hoof feet giving him little trouble. He placed his hands on Gerta&#39;s hips and took a deep breath in. Gerta&#39;s scent wasn&#39;t just turning him on, it was causing him to go into rut. With no hesitation, Adam drove his penis deep into Greta&#39;s vagina.<br />
<br />
The two of them let out loud bleats as Adam plunged it. Adam didn&#39;t stop there. He was soon rocking back and forth, his penis sliding in and out of Gerta. He held tightly onto her hips as he humped. He was aware that the she-goat was changing beneath him. Her waist was getting slimmer as her shoulders were expanding. Her front legs moved further apart, muscles covering the skinny bones. Her front hooves distorted as the individual toes spread out further. The toes extended, gaining more joints as the hard part of the hooves diminished, only covering a fraction of the tip. As thumbs formed, Gerta&#39;s front hooves took on the appearance of humanoid hands.<br />
<br />
This pleased Adam. It made Gerta so much more appealing to him. He increased his speed. As he got closer to his climax, his head started changing faster. His pointed ears extended further as his sense of hearing sharpened. The hard nubs on his head grew longer, forming into horns. His face distorted as it started stretching out. His nose became much smaller as it grew closer to his mouth, the top lip developing a cleft. If Adam&#39;s muzzle wasn&#39;t shorter and his eyes weren&#39;t placed so forward, his head wouldn&#39;t look any different from an ordinary goat&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Finally, Adam and Gerta let out a loud bleat as they climaxed. Adam sent several shots of sperm deep into Gerta&#39;s womb. When Adam felt the last aftershocks fade, he pulled out of Gerta and stood up. Anyone who saw him wouldn&#39;t have guessed it was Adam. He was a goat man, with a shiny brown coat of fur and resplendent horns upon his head. Gerta also stood up, putting her weight upon her longer back legs instead of her front legs which were now positively arms. She was also an anthro goat, her udder having formed into a pair of quite sizable breasts. Adam looked at Gerta&#39;s breasts with interest. The sight was making him aroused. Of course, he was hardly sated by that one session. He was in rut and he could smell that Gerta was still in heat. Adam had no intention of stopping any longer than necessary and Gerta was just as horny as he was.</p>
