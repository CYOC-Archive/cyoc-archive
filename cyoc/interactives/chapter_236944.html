<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff was looking over his newly created office space and seeing all the degrees, rewards, and achievements, it astounded him just how much it seemed he had accomplished at the age he was now. Before he left the room, he caught a glimpse of a picture he almost didn&#39;t notice before and saw it was a framed picture of himself and Amy at their wedding. Jeff was in a neatly trimmed suit, while Amy was wearing a beautiful bride&#39;s dress.<br />
<br />
&#39;She looks so beautiful here.&#39; Jeff thought to himself. &#39;We had such a blast when we had that epic fuck on our honeymoon.&#39; Jeff suddenly thought but shook it off. He couldn&#39;t believe he just thought that. Sure Amy was technically his wife now, but by the end of the week, they would all go back to normal with him being the older brother to her being the little sister. But the woman he saw in the photograph right now clearly was not his little sister, technically right now they were only related by marriage.<br />
<br />
As he was looking at the picture, he started to notice a few more that were next to it.  What he saw is that they were family portriats of him, his wife, and Jamie all having a good time.  The first was after the delivery when he was standing there in his nurse outfit and scrugie on his head while Amy was on the recovery bed holding a new born Jamie.  The next was Jamie&#39;s first birthday as the parents were gathered together between Jamie with a cupcake and a number one handle all lit up.  The next was Jamie&#39;s first day of school as the father was next to her daughter, getting ready to go to school for the first time.  Then there was another when the three were at Disneyland behind Cinderella&#39;s castle.  Each photo he looks like, Jeff&#39;s bond with her now daughter was growing stronger.  It was like something was telling him to protect his only daughter as she is the most precious thing in the world.<br />
<br />
Looking at the photos, he was amazed of how much reality has changed between the two.  &quot;Wow...  I can&#39;t believe that the dynamic between me and my mom has altered heavily.  Once a mother and son, then twins, and now it&#39;s the reverse.  I can feel the bond between me and my daughter growing stronger.  I wonder how Jamie would think of it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Just as he asked that, the door opened and Jamie came in, expecting a twin brother, but she was in for quite a surprise.  &quot;Hey bro, mom said to come down for dinner.  I hope you&#39;re not- WHAT THE FUCK?!?!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff heard that and turned to see Jamie as her jaw dropped and her eyes bugged out, shocked to see what she was looking at.  Seeing this, he chuckled and rubbed the back of his head, feeling a little embarrassed.  &quot;Uh...  Hi, Jamie...&quot;<br />
<br />
Blinking, Jamie realized who he is.  &quot;Je- Jeff?!  Is that you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded and said, &quot;Yes, sweetie...  It&#39;s me...  And it&#39;s dad to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie heard that and said, &quot;Dad?&quot;  Just then, she could feel her mind and memories altering as she was looking as Jeff not as a son, nor a twin brother, but instead a proud and confident father to look up to.  But that meant that their connection as twins have been servered and a new relations took hold as father and daughter.  Feeling that, she realized what Jeff did, she took a breather and said, &quot;Okay...  I understand that you want to continue to try the Chronivac on some things.  But why become a father?  Is being just a twin brother not good enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff shook his head and told his now daughter, &quot;Oh no.  That&#39;s not the case.  I really apprciate wanting a twin to hang out with, but lately...one thought occurred to me.  Remembered when dad left?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie old memories kicked in while the new memories were swirling and gave a depressed nod.  &quot;I remember...  Him getting killed in that accident was the worse day of my life.  Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
Giving a bit of a shrug, he told her, &quot;Well...  Considering what happened I never had a father for so long and you raising me, Amy, and Joel, I just wished that dad was back.  But when you became a teenager and mom&#39;s the mother, and idea struck me.  So with the Chronivac, I decided to sacrifice my teenage youth to make myself the father of the household since....since we originally didn&#39;t have one.  I...I hope you understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie listened to him and understood what he meant.  Since the accident, it was a difficult time raising three kids on her own.  Which is why she decided to become a teenager to remove all that burden for some youthful fun.  She never imagines that Jeff would risk decades of his life just to be the husband and father of the house.  In fact, looking at him, Jamie could see some resemblances of Mike in many ways.  So much so that their bond between is stronger then when they were twin siblings.<br />
<br />
With a sigh, she said, &quot;Yeah...  I understand...  I haven&#39;t thought about Mike in....so long now.  I do miss him.  I am amazed that you look just like him, despite the little differences.  Guess it runs in the family.  If he&#39;s watching us in Heaven now, I could tell that he would be proud of what you become.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff gave a warm smile and told his daughter, &quot;Thanks Jamie, I bet he is proud of me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie smiled back, but not before getting serious and said, &quot;However, I am not happy about you changing without me know it.  Next time, warn me if you are planning to change your age.  I was planning on being the annoying twin to you for a whole week.  At least I have an older brother to look up to.  No younger sibling isn&#39;t complete with an older one to be the role model.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff blinked and realized that she didn&#39;t know of what he did with Joey and stretched the color of his suit with worry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...  About that...&quot;<br />
<br />
Before he could explain that, the two heard Amy from downstairs calling them to come.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff!  Jamie!  What&#39;s taking you two so long?  Come down before dinner gets cold.  Oh!  And Amy, Grandpa Joe and Gramdma Mary are here!   They want to see their sweet grand daughter.  Come down and say hi.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie heard that and turned to the direction of the voice, feeling a little confused at first before responding back.  &quot;Okay, mom!  Just a moment!&quot;<br />
<br />
Turning to her now father, she asked him, &quot;Grandpa Joe.  What does she mean by that.  Grandpa passed away a few years ago.  Unless...&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, more new memories entered her mind.  This time, it was memories of her and her grandparents, playing together back when she was young.  And throughout those memories, her grandfather was there with grandmother when before hand, even with the changes, it was just grandma in the later years.  Shaking off the thoughts, she realized who was Grandpa Joe was.  He was once her older brother, Joey.  Feeling this batch of new information in her head, she looked to Jeff and had an angrier face then before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad?  What did you do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff rubbed the back of his balding head and gave a nervous chuckle.  &quot;Well...  I thought that since grandma, or mom now, missed grandpa- er- dad so much, I decided to make Joey the husband to Mary, since he tends to take care of her so much.  Thought it would be a great way for all of us to be happy for a week.  Heh, heh...  Sorry that you are the only child now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie heard that and rubbed the temple of her head, showing the mannersims of a mother she was before and groaned deeply.  &quot;Okay...  That&#39;s it...  When the week is up and we are all back to normal, you are grounded for an entire month.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s eyes were wide and said, &quot;What?!  A month?!  What for?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie looked to him with her hands on her hips and said, &quot;For using the Chronivac to get rid of my siblings for a week.  I hope you enjoy being a father, cause when it&#39;s over, you will regret it.  Now c&#39;mon, dad.  Mom is already loosing her patience and I have to seem my grandparents.  Can&#39;t keep them waiting for so long.&quot;  She soon turned around and walked away, heading downstairs to meet Joe and Mary and have dinner.  Jeff though stood there dumbstuck and didn&#39;t know what to think.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me?  Grounded?  A month?  Oh boy...  This is going to be a long week...&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking back to the photos on the wall, that anxiety was soon gone as he saw the family having a good time.  A warm smile came up his face and he said to himself, &quot;Still, despite that, it will be all worth it.&quot;<br />
<br />
As he was starring at the photos, Jamie screamed out to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;DAD!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Hearing that, he broke from his train of thought and said back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Coming, sweetie!&quot;<br />
<br />
He soon left his private office and headed downstairs to be with his family at dinner.  And so the one week of being a happy family begins.</p>
