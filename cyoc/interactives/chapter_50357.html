<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lunch time came very quickly. But even as it did come very quickly as the various pack <br />
members congealed into the dinning area (didn't feel right to call it a room anymore) <br />
along with the shadow who did so with flawless clockwork precision, a great many events <br />
still found time to take place. <br />
<br />
Beatrice seriously considered giving Pearl a cold shower, but then remembered reading <br />
somewhere that that was actually the LAST thing you actually wanted to do to someone <br />
who was passed out due to drinking, you could end up sending them into a coma, or so <br />
said one story at least.  The best thing you could rely on was good old fashioned noise, <br />
and even that would only keep them awake for a bit. Still, Beatrice had to know the full <br />
story. <br />
<br />
&quot;WAKE UP!&quot; The plain green Beatrice said loud and clear in Pearl's ears. <br />
<br />
&quot;WHAA!&quot; Pearl's eyes shot open as she looked around completely disoriented and looking <br />
even more confused. <br />
<br />
&quot;Pearl.&quot; Beatrice said kneeling in front of her, &quot;Did you use your turn on June?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha-wha-wha?!&quot; Pearl waved about looking scared. <br />
<br />
&quot;Did you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;May-mayb-eeeee.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHY?&quot; Beatrice hammered in. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ferrrre, daa, guud, of shc-da-pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The pack?! How?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Zhhhack's da best male save mast-starh, not lettin' em be en hurts da pack...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But-but-what does that have to do with June?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shheeeaa, sawh, meaa, wittth Zhhaacckeerieee.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He told you to?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nooooohh. Ahh did ehh mahself...&quot;<br />
<br />
That answer surprised Beatrice, if she could trust what the drunk she-wolf was saying. <br />
<br />
&quot;But why Zack?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh feeels niice, eh smells niice, eh is niice, eh looks niice, eh talks niice, eh touuches niice, <br />
eh-&quot;<br />
<br />
Beatrice got the idea. &quot;You heard what he said about Lawrence and Roger!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Et Ferrr daah good of da paack...sooh guud ferr da mastah.&quot;<br />
<br />
'I'm losing her again. &quot;Why were you with him to begin with?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Taaa tell'em... how worthleeesss eh wasss...&quot; <br />
<br />
'Apparently that didn't go as planned.' Beatrice thought to Pearl's answer as Pearl was <br />
already out like a light again. <br />
<br />
Alexandra came up behind Beatrice and said, &quot;What was that all about?&quot;<br />
<br />
Beatrice jumped out of her skin and turned around, &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She was slurring like a sailor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's drunk. Apparently she took making love to Zackery rather hard.&quot; <br />
<br />
Alexandra groaned, &quot;I was more upset than ashamed-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll take care of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Both of you to the female den, there's an announcement that needs making. This order <br />
comes from the master.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Alexandra.&quot; Beatrice scooped up Pearl in her arms and began to track back to the <br />
lady's den. <br />
<br />
Alexandra found Sarah, Ulysses and Jasmine paying video games. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shut that off and come to the female's den, there's an announcement to be made. This <br />
order comes from the Master.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Alexandra,&quot; all three wolves said, but Alexadnra grabbed Ulysses by the tail making <br />
him yelp. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're not a she-wolf.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... right.&quot; Ulysses said the noise of disappointed filtering slightly through his voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;I have a message I want to give to Zackery. Tell him the ban on him is lifted.&quot; Alexandra <br />
said calmly, &quot;By Master himself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ulysses brightened up at the prospect of being useful and hurried along straight to the <br />
Male's den, as he did so, he glanced involuntary looked inside the gallery connected to the <br />
main living room.  Inside were five life sized nude gold statues of japanese women with <br />
positively absurd maternal proportions, their pose the only thing keeping them from <br />
falling over (and the pedestals with names no one recognized). All anyone knew was that <br />
the had appeared on the morning the pack had been introduced. No one remembered <br />
anyone missing, but of course, that had been part of the Transform and Dare, and the <br />
pack as a whole had a enough intelligence to guess precisely where they had come from.  <br />
<br />
For Ulysses, and in fact all the pack members, they represented the ultimate and purest <br />
punishment one could be dealt for disobeying the pack, with the clink's words suggesting <br />
anyone knew would be a glass statue instead of gold. <br />
<br />
Ulysses was honestly scared to bits about his worthlessness reaching Master's ears, and <br />
instead of being upgraded into a female or a super male like Roger and Lawrence he'd <br />
become a statue no one would recognize the name of. Sarah however, she liked him as he <br />
was, she did MIND that he couldn't please her, in fact, she seemed more relaxed about <br />
him because of that... and all the time... he felt SAFE around her, like she'd speak for him <br />
and protect him if something bad happened. <br />
<br />
When Ulysses hurried to the male's den, he found that Zackery was there with the three <br />
she wolves who looked almost just like Alpha Female. <br />
<br />
&quot;Zackery.&quot; Ulysses said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; He asked looking at the boy annoyed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Master must have caught wind what Nicole did to you, because he's declared that none of <br />
the she wolves are to reject you because Nicole said so!&quot;<br />
<br />
The three she wolves present seemed slightly surprised at this but said nothing, merely <br />
flanking him on all side.  <br />
<br />
Zackery's eyes lit up in surprise, then excitement, then joy, &quot;Haha! Good old Jen! I knew <br />
she/he wouldn't let me down! I should have known! Heh... could always count on him/her. <br />
Isn't that right girls?&quot;<br />
<br />
The she wolves all looked at each other and then said together, &quot;Yes/Yeah/Uh-Huh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess you should be glade this doesn't really have any effect on you eh Ulysses?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes indeed.&quot; Ulysses nodded perfectly calm, he hadn't minded anything Zackery had said <br />
about his inability to carnal please the females like a true male in the least, because they <br />
were absolutely true. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know,&quot; Zackery suggested, &quot;You could just ask Jensen to make you one of the girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ulysses blushed, &quot;Actually... I suggested that myself... but Sarah says she likes me just the <br />
way I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zackery blinked and said, &quot;I guess she's into that sort of thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What sort of thing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Zackery grimace, &quot;Never mind.  Feel free to sit in on any unities I have with any of the <br />
females. You can take lessons from it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you sir.&quot; Ulysses nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;Speaking of which, hey Hope, 'Belle, Grace, how about we show him how it's done?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No./Un-Uh./Not happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? You're joking.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't feel it./Not now./.... Maybe later.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like you girls actually -need- it.&quot; Zack slumped. Hope braced herself, but Zack <br />
made no sudden movements, and his voice sounded more disappointed than dark. <br />
<br />
Not one of them found his idea of Ulysses watching them mate as depraved, after all, it <br />
was what Ulysses was supposed to be for right? Even if he was still in the early stages of <br />
puberty and thus not in the tastes of any of the females. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to her?&quot; June asked as soon as Beatrice came in with the passed out Pearl.<br />
<br />
Beatrice looked at June doing her best to hide her apprehension. &quot;She passed out drunk.&quot;<br />
<br />
June feigned ignorance, &quot;What was that about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Having made love with Zack.&quot; Beatrice parroted doing her best to sound ignorant. <br />
<br />
June did her absolute best play acting, &quot;She sure is taking this harder than she needs to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's what everyone seems to be saying.&quot; <br />
<br />
June tensed up at Beatrice's words. How many had been around Pearl when drunk? <br />
Dammit. June had been hoping to be done here before Pearl knocked herself out with a <br />
wine bottle. <br />
<br />
&quot;Howdy-hoo!&quot; Sarah waved at the mass of females covering the males, she saw the new <br />
two wolf titans, but made no reaction to them beside thinking that they were good <br />
looking, but had no interest in leaping on top of them like her pack mates, Master was all <br />
she needed and for when he wanted her. <br />
<br />
Jasmine rejoined the blob with willing eagerness. <br />
<br />
Alexandra came in, the gray wolf said, &quot;All males back to the male den, all females front <br />
and center, this order comes from Master himself.&quot;<br />
<br />
The she wolves in the blob looked rather disappointed at this, but complied as they began <br />
to line up.  Beatrice helped Peal to her feet besides her. Roger and Lawrence left the she <br />
wolves also disappointed. <br />
<br />
Alexandra looked at the lesser females of the pack and said, &quot;By order of Master himself, <br />
Zack is under investigation.&quot;<br />
<br />
'DAMMIT!!!' June thought cringing, 'There's no way in Hades no one isn't going to jump the <br />
conclusion Zackery is behind it if I ToD one of those extra males now no matter how I <br />
string things along!!! DAMMIT! I should have used the game on Margot to change <br />
Lawrence for me the moment I set foot back in here!!! From now on if I need to do <br />
something for Zackery dear's own good, I'll do it myself weather he likes it or not.' <br />
<br />
Nicole looked very pleased with what Alexandra said, playing with the ribbon around one <br />
ear smiling as broadly as a she wolf could. <br />
<br />
&quot;Zackery is NOT to know he is under investigation in any shape or form. This order also <br />
comes directly from the Master and is not to be questioned. Understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Alexandra.&quot; The she wolves said together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Also. The Master has ordered that there is be NO ban on Zackery what so ever. He is not <br />
to be barred from the female's den nor is any female forbidden from mating with him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?!?!?&quot; Nicole snarled. Megan also looked shocked. June drank in Nicole's exclaim, <br />
Pearl in her doopy state smiled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Weather you mate with him is your own business. You also had no authority to impose <br />
that ban in the first place cousin, so be glade you weren't punished for your <br />
impertinence.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You dislike him as much as I and Megan do!&quot; Nicole shot back.<br />
<br />
&quot;What I feel on the matter is meaningless! You stepped out of bounds reserved for the <br />
Alphas and Betas... be grateful for the Master's mercy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nicole opened and closed her muzzle several times, then finally got back in line, &quot;Right <br />
cousin...&quot;<br />
<br />
  June felt relieved. 'Now I just need to begrudging give Zack a 'second chance' because <br />
Master said so, and I can then stop hiding being with him.'<br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Martha of course said nothing to Nick's mess, she was of course Omega, lowest of the low, <br />
and it did not directly involve the cubs, so what right did she have to say on anything Nick <br />
did? <br />
<br />
Mr. P on the other hand, &quot;Clean up on this mess boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's what I'm doing!&quot; Nick replied at the titanic four legged wolf. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do it faster!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes-yes!&quot; Nick nodded. &quot;I'm just tryin' to find ways to get Lawrence and Roger beefed up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The she wolf Margot used her turn, they're as muscular and tough as you are now.&quot; Mr. P <br />
said simply, &quot;Master approved before hand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?!&quot; Nick said dismayed agitated and honestly feeling very betrayed. &quot;After I drove <br />
myself insane for her, I mean them?! That's not fair!&quot; Nick whinnied. <br />
<br />
&quot;Life's not fair little man! Now get to it!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes yes!&quot; Nick cried unhappily. <br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings to all of you.&quot; Alice said as she entered the study. <br />
<br />
All the wolves save Nick turned to her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Mistress Alice.&quot; Martha's bowed all six eyes closed on her two heads. <br />
<br />
Alice looked at Mr. P, &quot;Master has spoken Mr P! Mr. Zackery is to be put under a full secret <br />
investigation for the time being to study his motives, designs, and threat level to the <br />
power structure of the pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr P sighed in relief, &quot;That's good news. A loose cannon is the last thing any group needs. <br />
All they do is sow confusion and disorder in the ranks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mr. P.&quot; They also delayed Alice's goal of bringing her cousins and auntie into the <br />
pack, something Alice was none too happy about in the least. Alice then pranced over to <br />
one of the poetry books and began reading Poe. <br />
<br />
Marcy and Kevin were relieved that papa would be making sure Zackery wouldn't hurt <br />
them. Bart and Jenny were glade that one was one less complication to -greatly- worry <br />
about for the pack's immediate future. <br />
<br />
<br />
Nick wondered what the big deal was, but if Nicole said that this Zack dude was bad news, <br />
then Nick wasn't about to challenge her on it in the least! <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome back.&quot; Zackery said, showing no visible reaction when he saw the new wolf titan <br />
versions of Lawrence and Roger who were rivals to him and Nick in terms of wolfish and <br />
male form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello.&quot; Lawrence said cooly remembering how Zack had treated him before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ditto.&quot; Same with Roger. <br />
<br />
&quot;So how does it feel?&quot; Zack asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eh?&quot; Lawrence asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;How does it feel? The power, the size, the strength, the eyes of all the ladies on you.&quot;  <br />
The clink around him said nothing. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can't say I'm not enjoying it.&quot; Lawrence said doing his best to sound cultured even if his <br />
new muscle buff make him seem rather contradicting. <br />
<br />
Roger of course had Megan's chat with him at the back of his mind but wasn't about to tell <br />
Zack that and put on his best face, &quot;I FEEL GREAT! Bigger! Stronger! Faster! Harder! Better! <br />
Intense isn't it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ulysses just inched back away from this, Roger and Lawrence were so focused on Zack <br />
that didn't even notice him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wonderful then isn't it? So it feels good to be upgraded? As a former female I can't really <br />
give a comparison on this state and my old one, but the -power- really is the greatest <br />
isn't it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Still trying to get under Zack's skin Roger replied, &quot;YOU BET IT IS!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Glade we agree.&quot; Zack smiled and nodded. Lawrence only nodded in turn. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hope, Grace.&quot; Zack said. <br />
<br />
&quot;What? / Yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don't you test out Lawrence and Roger's new bodies while 'Belle acts as a control <br />
group with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls were completely shocked at this. Zack had just suggested they mate with <br />
Lawrence and Roger then and there? Isabelle looked at her two fellow replicas of Alpha <br />
Female who nodded in return. <br />
<br />
&quot;I guess... I guess that sounds alright.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Be sure to take notes Ulysses.&quot; Zack said to the purple wolf boy. <br />
<br />
Both the plain green and white wolves just now noticed Ulysses in the room. Somewhere <br />
the last shreds of their humanity screamed that it was bloody wrong to do this in front of <br />
Ulysses, but the two Big Bad Wolves totally ignored it. It was no different than a apprentice <br />
getting to see the craft he was aspiring for. <br />
<br />
The females began to place themselves near Lawrence and Roger, not even asking for their <br />
permission or opinions on the matter, which didn't matter in the least anyway, this was <br />
what they were kept male for in the pack anyway. <br />
<br />
Ten minutes later Ashley had stormed in to give Zack a piece of her mind and tell him just <br />
how she... wasn't... going to... mate with... him.. just cause a ban was... lifted...<br />
<br />
Ashley's brain was easily overwhelmed by the combined pheromones of the now three <br />
fully excited three males Big Bads, her head turning to mush. She was pulled into the three <br />
way mix and match without a word or a complaint. She didn't notice or care when the <br />
match up was between her and Zack, and didn't give it a second thought when they <br />
switched partners again. <br />
<br />
She had walked out of the male den thirty minutes later, dizzy, disoriented, and swimming <br />
through a powerful after glow. She walked drunkenly as what she had just done came <br />
crawling through her mind. &quot;All the males... are pretty good..&quot; Ashley said, not being able <br />
to tell which ones had been Lawrence and Roger and which ones had been Zack as things <br />
had gotten totally chaotic.  So yes, Ashley settled on just that doing her best to maintain <br />
her dignity, all the males were good. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
When lunch arrived, Roger and Lawrence were of course much easier to spot. Megan <br />
however couldn't shake the feeling that her brother had been made into a mimic of Zack <br />
the same way the three new comers had been made into mimics of Alpha Female, and that <br />
gave her a sick feeling at the pit of her stomach. <br />
<br />
Of course Magot LOVED the new and improved Lawrence. <br />
<br />
Pearl and June still sat apart, and still did her best not to sit too close but not too far away <br />
from Zackery, couldn't flip flop on a whim after all. Ashley two shades of blue had tints of <br />
red as she blushed thinking of the mix and match she had been pulled in and not saying a <br />
word to anyone, but feeling more embarrassed them sickened. She certainly didn't LIKE <br />
Zack now, nor did she feel Nicole had been wrong for the ban or the spot between the <br />
legs (which seemed perfectly healed now), but she couldn't say she hated him either. <br />
<br />
The Master's bandages could likely come off tomorrow at the pace he was going, even if <br />
he was still stuck with just drinking fluids today and the next day. <br />
<br />
Caroline discussed Nicole's idea of the self defense classes with Master. Alice ate in the <br />
mirror with her aunt and mother, Bart really not wanting to see what he'd end up wearing <br />
if he went in there (he imagined a little boy's sailor suit).  He was glade he instead ate <br />
along side his father with his sisters and younger siblings. <br />
<br />
Sarah of course sat next to Ulysses. Leaving some joking if she was going to chew his food <br />
for him too, which Sarah ignored and Ulysses blushed from. <br />
<br />
The clink of coursed per orders stayed here Zack. The rest of the females were interested <br />
in staying near the males. Kaylee didn't like not having her personal chair with her, but <br />
settled for just being near her mate instead. <br />
<br />
The shadows of course going about the task like it was a task and nothing more. That <br />
three of them were women was glaringly obvious by now. But all of them acting like robots <br />
or shadow puppets. <br />
<br />
<br />
Mr. P and Martha ate side by side in silence but enjoying each other's company as fellow <br />
guardians of the pups. <br />
<br />
Nicole close to sit in Nick's lap like he was throne, (which he didn't even remotely try to <br />
object to) and no one questioned her on it, and Jensen didn't even bat an eyelash at it or <br />
give it a first thought nor did his inner circle. This was mostly for Nicole's self confidence <br />
after being battered down by Alexandra more than anything. <br />
<br />
Lunch broke up as it always did as the wolves went back to their tasks of either wasting <br />
time or moving along the ebay train or working on the designs for the revisions to the <br />
outside of the house. <br />
<br />
This led to a lazy afternoon, Zack oblivious to his three friends were spying on him, <br />
trusting them completely (sans of course Pearl and June's actions, he wasn't stupid). <br />
<br />
As the scent from four deer slowly floated up and away from the estate, many deer began <br />
the slow and tireless journey of making their way towards the estate on hoof, driving by a <br />
fundamental -need- to go to it, not understanding it, not desiring to understand it, nor <br />
caring to understand it. <br />
<br />
Afternoon turned to evening and evening turned to night. Kaylee finally got her wish <br />
(wearing the helmet and stick again) to get the females and Ulysses and the pups to take <br />
part in a Smash Brothers tournament on her wii... most won through sheer dumb luck to <br />
being ignorant of the game's simplistic controls, while the cubs mostly dominated the <br />
game. Nicole still couldn't believe she got knocked out in the second round. Terri was <br />
blown away in the third. Ulysses and Millie made it all the way to the semi finals along <br />
with Jenny and Kevin. Ulysses and Jenny faced off in the finals, and Ulysses made sure <br />
Jenny made a run for her money as she finally and tirelessly claimed the meaningless <br />
crown of smash champ among the pack. <br />
<br />
Dinner was much a repeat affair. There was a total sense of comfort about how routine <br />
and how NORMAL it all felt. It was good. This was there life. This was the pack. <br />
<br />
Alice made her nightly visit to Abbey and Samantha, apologizing for the delay which she <br />
sadly wasn't allowed to share details of but promised it didn't have to do with their 'father.' <br />
Abbey and Alice both doing their best to entice Samantha into 'trying out' going through <br />
the mirror once it was time. Samantha own curiosity now driving her mad at all the <br />
possible place she could visit if what Alice said about the mirror was true. <br />
<br />
In the kitchen angry, tired, upset, and mentally exhausted Julie slammed down the phone. <br />
&quot;Thank you for NOTHING!&quot;  She slowly looked back at the fortune teller's card.... the <br />
insanity of it, the absurdity of it.... 'What do I have left to lose? ... She's just say some <br />
generic and vague mumbo jumbo then ask for money to lift a family curse... just what do I <br />
have left to lose?' Julie thought as she went to bed. <br />
<br />
Lawrence and Roger had  what could have amounted to a -party- that night with <br />
themselves and the females in the lady's den (the co-ed den didn't seem big enough). <br />
Only Megan, Nicole, and Sarah didn't take part. They moved to the co-ed den themselves <br />
to get away from the smell and the noise.</p>
