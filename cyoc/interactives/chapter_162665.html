<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Coach Lucas?&quot; a voice emanated from the locker room doorway. <br />
<br />
Startled by the sudden speech, you instinctively hunted for the discarded clothes on the floor. Luckily, the shirt and shorts were scattered nearby, so you quickly threw those on before confronting the voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Coach Lucas?&quot; the voice repeated as the person seemed to be walking towards the office now. When you turned around in your chair, you saw a beautiful woman smiling near the small entryway leading into the office. While she looked fairly young, probably in her mid-20s, her more professional attire indicated that she was most likely part of the faculty here. Since you did not recognize her, you assumed that she recently joined as a new teacher. <br />
<br />
&quot;Coach? Is it a good time for a little chat now? If you are busy-&quot; the woman began.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, it&#39;s perfectly fine,&quot; you tried to contain your euphoria from your masturbation while emulating the coach&#39;s friendly mannerisms. &quot;But how did you know I was in my locker room office?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. Umm. The other teachers told me that P.E. classes don&#39;t start until after lunch, so I could stop by your office in the morning. Luckily, no boys were in the locker room, so that was convenient for me,&quot; the woman said shyly. For a moment, you might have saw a faint blush on her cheeks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the other teachers were correct. Haha...&quot; you chuckled. A brief awkward pause ensued. To break the silence, you asked the one question that was on your mind. &quot;Sorry, but may I ask who are you?&quot; You hope that this did not introduce any more awkwardness, as you simply did not know Coach Lucas&#39;s relationship with this woman.<br />
<br />
The woman briefly held a hand to her mouth before saying, &quot;Oh. I forgot to introduce myself. I know I am new here. My name is Elizabeth Wright, but most faculty just call me Eliza. I just recently graduated from college, so this is my first year teaching. I am currently teaching English for the freshmen.&quot; She briefly glanced at her wristwatch. &quot;Sorry, I have to head back to my class soon, but do you mind if we meet for a cup of coffee later? I hope to know the faculty more, and you seem like a good person to start from.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure. Just let me know whenever you are available,&quot; you hastily responded, not sure if the real Coach Lucas would agree. But as a nice person, he will probably agree anyways.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks. See you soon!&quot; Elizabeth waved before stepping out of the office.<br />
<br />
You breathed a sigh of relief as you managed to carry that conversation somehow. Things would have gone horribly if someone walked in while you were jerking off. Well, not YOU specifically, but you definitely didn&#39;t want to tarnish Coach Lucas&#39;s name. You were actually surprised that Elizabeth didn&#39;t notice the cum stains on the mirror or the musky odor from the orgasm. But you suppose that the office was dim enough for her to miss the stain, and the strong locker room smell masked the odor in the office. <br />
<br />
As you slouch in your chair, you can&#39;t help but think of the conversation you just had with Elizabeth. Is it usual for something like this to happen during the school day? The woman definitely had some sort of interest in Coach Lucas. But then, who wouldn&#39;t be? You just spent the entire morning fawning over the coach. However, you realized that you were pitching a tent when you thought of the conversation, and of Elizabeth. She was definitely attractive in her own right. Her light brown hair was tied neatly in a short ponytail, and her smooth face contained her soft hazel eyes and plump lips. Small round earrings adorned her ears. While her facial features exuded a youthful appearance, the rest of her figure displayed a more mature outlook. She was wearing a bright blue blazer over a white polo shirt with a heart-shaped necklace around her neck. Underneath, she was wearing a black pencil miniskirt with dark pantyhose, and her feet were covered by short black heels. Overall, she was of average height, but her figure was fairly slim and attractive. You recalled taking a quick glimpse at her chest and noting that while her breasts were not huge, they looked perky, which complemented the rest of her appearance. <br />
<br />
&quot;Am I...getting attracted to her?&quot; you asked. Maybe it&#39;s because she was the first young female teacher you saw in this otherwise relatively old faculty group. Or maybe it was just hot in here. Your body was sweating as you were still descending from the euphoria from before. You had to admit that Coach Lucas had a strong libido. That made you wonder if your mental perceptions were influenced by your host body. As you preferred men over women, being attracted to a woman was certainly unexpected, even if she was attractive.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, you also wondered how to control this phenomenon. You remembered thinking about getting older and dozing off, but that seemed pretty vague in terms of a specific trigger. Perhaps, it utilized your subconscious admiration of Coach Lucas. Besides initiating, how would you return to your original body? Was this also part of the Senior Takeover? So far, this possession phenomenon was just as confusing as understanding adult life. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, at least Senior Takeover is three weeks away, so I have time to figure it out. Also, I&#39;ve been controlling Coach Lucas for quite a while now, certainly longer than my experience as dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
As if right on cue, your vision started to blur as you feel faint. When you refocused, you saw that you were back in your seat in math class. Just as you were about to blame yourself for jinxing it, you heard the bell ring as students started to file out of the classroom. Dominic immediately rushed to your desk. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re awake, sleepyhead? You must be up late last night to sleep this long in class. You were lucky Mrs. Thomas didn&#39;t catch you. So, are you ready for lunch?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lunch? It&#39;s lunchtime already?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow dude. You must have been lights out during class. But yes, class is over, and lunchtime is here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Picking up your backpack, you followed Dom out of the classroom and toward the cafeteria. Understandably, your mind was still on understanding the phenomenon.</p>
