<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Day Two of this… whatever you want to call it, this testament, this record.  Things are worse than I thought.  <br />
Its not just here, its spreading.  I think they’ve started showing it at parties now.  A few people have <br />
talked about seeing a weird video at their party.  They’re picking victims in small numbers for now, most of <br />
the parties have a 9 to 1 ratio of bros to normal kids.  I wish there was more I could do, I wish I could’ve <br />
told those guys what’s going to happen to them.  But its already too late I guess.  Pretty soon they’ll be <br />
bros too and stalking around for more initiates to take to the next party to show the video to more people.  <br />
I’ve already caught some of them flexing randomly and talking in bro.  How long before it reaches my circle, <br />
before everyone is just a stupid bro?<br />
<br />
I saw my friend Mark this morning, we talked a little in the halls before class.  I didn’t tell him about any <br />
of this, about what I’ve seen or my private fears.  When he said good bye, he called me broski, does that mean <br />
he’s seen it? Is he already becoming one of them?  I better avoid him just to be safe, I think he did look a <br />
bit more built than before but I can’t be sure.  I have to be careful, I’m glad I have you guys to talk to.  I <br />
don’t know what I’d do without you all.  <br />
<br />
After class I drove to one of the local stores.  Yeah I’m one of those people, hate Walmart, rather pay more <br />
to support local business and the owner is an old friend. Mrs. Meyers.  Nice woman really, I’ve known her <br />
almost all my life and watched her son grow up; Evan, guys gotta be around 14 by now.  He was always pretty <br />
quiet and reserved but he’s helped her around the store the last few years since she’s starting to get up <br />
there and her husband left a long time ago.  When I got there I didn’t see her, she was almost always reading <br />
a book at the front, she doesn’t get much business.  I didn’t think much of it and browsed the shelves, <br />
gathering supplies and rations to make it through the weekend.  I didn’t see Evan around either.  He was <br />
easily missed, small, mousey, with brown hair like mine.  Again, I passed it off.  I went to the check out and <br />
placed my items without looking up.  I saw a very large, unfamiliar hand grab my purchases amd begin ringing <br />
them up.  The fingers were stretched and big and the owner could probably easily palm a basketball.  I <br />
followed it up to a long, but exceptionally thick arm covered in brown fuzz.  The muscles were toned, tan and <br />
bulging out without effort.  It was connected to broad shoulders and massive, bulging pecs straining at a <br />
bright pink polo shirt with white stripes and all the buttons popped.  Craning my head up because the man was <br />
easily several inches taller than me I noticed a familiar face and froze.  It was Evan.  His hair was bleached <br />
blond, wavy and shorter now and he looked almost 20 instead of 14 but there was no mistaking his face.  It was <br />
much more tan and masculine looking with a sharper jaw but still had just enough of the old mousy features to <br />
recognize him.  I gawked a bit more and asked if it was him.  He took off his white sunglasses and stared at <br />
me strangely for a second then his dull, empty eyes lit up a little as he recognized me.  It coldn‘t have been <br />
more than a few weeks since I‘ve been here yet I saw the strain as he tried to remember.  “Aye bro, long time, <br />
course its me!”  He replied.  It didn’t sound anything like Evan’s usual soft, high pitched voice.  It was <br />
deep, relaxed and confident.  It sounded very familiar.  No way, not him too.  He was wearing a silver chain <br />
around his neck and the characteristic short bro shorts, exposing his hairy legs which were developed but no <br />
where near as much as the rest of him.  He was only wearing sandals, exposing his large feet.  How does a kid <br />
going from being 14, to having 14 as a shoe size so quickly?  He fiddled with a preppy bracelet on his wrist <br />
that matched one on his ankle as he scanned my items and talked idly about what he’s been up.  I was dimly <br />
aware that I was checked out, I thanked “Evan” and drifted around the front of the store.  <br />
<br />
A female customer was checking out and flirting with Evan now.  She was around my age but not familiar.  Thick <br />
brown hair flowing down to her butt, shorts to show off her legs and a tight pink Hollister shirt.  She was <br />
pale, not like ew emo pale but in a cute way, with big brown eyes and a nice hourglass figure all around 5 and <br />
a half feet.  Evan took notice and went right to work like a pro.  He brushed back his hair and subtly grabbed <br />
the front of his pants and started going on about how he got white boy wasted as his cousin’s party on campus <br />
and bragging about how much he held down.  She wasn’t really even paying attention to what he was saying, just <br />
staring at his bit of exposed chest and trying not to drool.  She slipped him her number and left, staring <br />
back every 5 seconds with an awkward smile and giggle.  He responded by flashing his 6 pack and brown treasure <br />
trail at her.  She seemed even more ditzy and peppy then she did coming in, it’s a wonder she made it out <br />
without tripping.  I watched him give a big grin and stuff the number in his pocket whispering to himself <br />
something about getting his first “bro hoe.”  He arched his back, spreading himself out as much as he could <br />
and relaxed.  I knew the innocent boy sometimes seen sweeping the floor or following his mom around was as <br />
good as gone.<br />
<br />
I saw Mrs. Meyers come out of the bathroom.  She waved and ran over.  We exchanged our usual words and gossip, <br />
checking up on each other.  I tried to subtlety steer the conversation towards Evan, who was currently winking <br />
at his reflection in a small mirror.  She mentioned how he had started hanging out with his cousin who <br />
attended my school and then hit “puberty” she admitted he grew a little faster than she expected but she was <br />
so proud of how his working out in the gym was paying off and how much time he was spending with his cousin <br />
lately.  She also mentioned he’d been nagging her for a truck so he can go out and ‘pick up chicks’ even <br />
though as a boy he always wanted a sports car.  She went on about how she wished his grades would improve, <br />
apparently they’ve been steadily dropping.  Again, she just thought it was normal puberty stuff.  What’s going <br />
on here, does she really not notice what’s happened to her son?  But it was now in the high school students <br />
too it seems.  I said my goodbyes and got out of there quickly.  <br />
<br />
So now I’m here, in this room, typing this.  I can’t help but think about the old Evan, and shake with anger <br />
at the guy who checked me out today.  So his cousin had inducted him, why didn’t I see this coming?  Everybody <br />
with friends or family in this school is a potential bro too, and then there friends and family.  As much as <br />
this scared me I was even more concerned about Evan’s last words, what did he mean by bro hoe?  Did he do <br />
something to her?  She did seem strange after Evan flirted with her.  Brain dead almost, and she looked ready <br />
to jump him at the register, before that she was all business and perfectly poised.  And there’s still the <br />
matter of Mark, a potential bro.  I should probably avoid my friends for awhile, you never know anymore.  It’s <br />
not like I can ask them if they’ve seen it.  I have to keep a low profile.  Thanks for reading, signing off <br />
for the night.<br />
<br />
- Tom.</p>
