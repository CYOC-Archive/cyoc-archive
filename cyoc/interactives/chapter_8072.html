<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Al Bender and his apprentice Butch Tender sat having a snack before returning to weld cracked pipes running in the city sewer. Al being a welder for thirty years had by this time in his life become cynical.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea, these dumb people that run the city are so full of bull, we should have something really wild to scare the hell out of them.&quot; said Al as Butch chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need one of those twenty foot gators runn'in around down in the sewers, maybe then they'd stick their noses down here and see the mess of busted pipes. Hell most people don't know that the water pipers when cracked allow sewage to back flow into them and people drink it later, dumb!&quot;<br />
<br />
Butch knew better than to break one of Al's sweet thoughts and would just smile or chuckle. <br />
<br />
It was that afternoon when a thunder shower increased the water flow in the sewer to a rate which made it impossible for Butch and Al to stand. As the two worked their way back to the ladder and manhole for safety something bright and shiny caught Al's keen eye.<br />
<br />
There snagged by a reinforcing rod that stuck out of the concrete wall was the silver Medallion from Brazil. Al strained had to walk against the increasing flow of water to get the Medallion. At last he had the treasure and was climbing the ladder to safety.<br />
<br />
Holding the Medallion and climbing the steel rungs to the safety ladder were getting tough. In a flip he dropped the silver chain over his head and with the bright bobble he climbed into the daylight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Al, what's that you got?&quot; asked Butch pointing to the fancy piece of jewelry hung about Al's neck.<br />
<br />
As Al stood still in the manhole he smiled and picking up the Medallion for a good look in the light of day he said, &quot;This is my lucky jewelry to make a gator to bit the city father's in the ass!&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly the blue stone on the Medallion began to glow. <br />
<br />
&quot;Al look at the stone, it's glowing!&quot; said Butch pointing as Al's chest.<br />
<br />
Al took it as a joke as he said, &quot; Don't give me that crap, hell if this thing was magic I'd ask it to make me the sewer gator, Eeek!&quot; As a sharp and almost electric charge hit Al he dropped two rungs down into the manhole.<br />
<br />
Butch seeing the rushing river below and fearing for Al's life laid down bending head first into the manhole to grab his employer's hand.<br />
Looking down at Al the man's eyes had turned very red. His face looked darkened and sort of green in color. The hand which Al reached up to beckon for help was not human anymore. Four claws and a paw like green scaled hand reached up for which Butch did not want to touch.<br />
<br />
Al going through monstrous changed below in the sewer began to climb the ladder. Up he came as his head elongated and human teeth were being pushed out of place by pointed teeth of a large looking reptile.<br />
<br />
Butch screamed from the fear and tried to wiggle himself out of his situation. As Al lunged upward like he's bite Butch in half the silver chain and Medallion flew off the head of the growing Gator. In a second Butch came out of the manhole and at the same time grabbed the magic bobble too.<br />
<br />
As Al now a monster of one sewer Alligator hit his expanding head on the manhole walls he fell with a splash into the rushing torrent of water below.  Seeing something going on and hearing Butch's scream people began to gather around the open manhole.<br />
<br />
The Papers were filled with Butch's story of the man eating Alligator who took his friend and employer to his death. As he picked up his evening paper and read the wild story, Detective Ambrose Martin wondered if the Medallion had been found in the sewer.<br />
<br />
A scared still apprentice welder sat in Chilli's Bar downtown that night telling the weird story to drunks on all sides. The more he told the story the more drunk he became too. As the Bartender closed out the place around 2:00am. poor Butch was ejected into a cool windy night, stone drunk!<br />
<br />
A wandering drunk found himself talking to lamp posts and trash barrels as if they were more than just objects in his path. It was as he needed to pee and toddled into an alley for relief that he was approached by three hearty youths.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, who said you could pee on our territory? Hey you there, Drunk!&quot; yelled the lead youth as the others just smiled.<br />
<br />
Drunk or not Butch saw he was in trouble and wished he had Al with him at that moment, Gator or not! &quot;Hey fella's I'm harmless but this silver bobble here is what you need to worry about! Today I saw a guy, a friend, change from a man into a huge Alligator, you's all be scared just as me was!&quot; stammered Butch no doubt seeing three boys of each youth standing there before him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You going to become a Gator and have us for lunch too, Mr. Drunk?&quot; chided the younger of the three.<br />
<br />
Butch took a deep breath and holding up the blue stoned Medallion said, &quot;I wish it could make me into a ten foot tall Eagle and I'd eat you asses for my supper!&quot; <br />
<br />
As the three youths popped open three switchblades they watched a miracle begin before them. <br />
<br />
Butch extended his arms out to the side of his growing body. He took an evil stare at the three stunned youths standing and just looking. Butch's eyes grew round and huge as his head grew larger. His nose turned a yellow cast and strained forward making a stiff beak rounded down and pointed for tearing his victims to shreds.<br />
<br />
Shaking his body as it grew taller and much larger he stepped forward a step. With the growth up and out his legs change as toes grew out forward and back armed with talons.<br />
<br />
&quot;Squawk&quot; said Butch as his new monster sized Eagle form solidified. A thick plumage of black feathers rustled as he moved toward the three youths backing away from what they all saw.<br />
<br />
The Medallion was still tightly hung about Butch's neck as he reached his beak out and snagged the older youth by the shoulder. As Butch picked up the screaming youth he bit down had and snapped the neck, killing his first prey. The other two boy's scattered and ran as if something from hell was chasing them.<br />
<br />
The Eagle feeling happy from it's kill and still very drunk began to have his late supper there in the alley.<br />
<br />
The next morning Ambrose was called to the grizzly scene of a killing where the body had been dissected in the street. The news papers went wild with stories of the city under attack fro the sewers and now the air as the two youths came forward with their crazy story.  <br />
<br />
Meanwhile Ambrose went home to be kind to an Officer who also met his new life by making a foolish comment to the Medallion of power.</p>
