<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You were glad that Kellie and Roxie had had a good night with their friends on their &quot;girls night,&quot; and that they&#39;d appeared not to have any trouble with the Wolf Hunters, at least none that was reported. It was something that you were sure would ease Luna&#39;s worries, given the violence that the Wolf Hunters were known for and the fact that Kellie and Roxie were her parents. Having everyone back was a good thing, even though the CD that had been playing the music that you and Luna had been dancing to had finished. You looked to Kellie and Roxie to see what they wanted to do and noted that their faces retained a soft but firm look about them as they began to undress in front of you and Luna.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you two will give us a moment, Roxie and I need to get changed,&quot; Kellie spoke as she let her dress slide off her shoulders and fall down to the floor.<br />
<br />
You and Luna nodded, as while the two of you had transformed early to see on what your measurements were in MILF-wolf form, Kellie and Roxie had likely been putting a lot of their focus into holding back the transformation on the second night of the full moon, and that likely had more to do with how many stores and restaurants dealt with things like the nudity that all werewolves had in their transformed state, MILF-wolves included. Luna had said places tended to &quot;look the other way&quot; at night, but you assumed that was with regard to things outside. Inside businesses and other establishments, they&#39;d likely have their own rules. Thus, Kellie and Roxie had to stay in human form while out on their girl&#39;s night, and now that they were home, they would have to take their MILF-wolf forms. Neither you nor Luna minded.<br />
<br />
Both Kellie and Roxie were still beautiful mature women and knowing that their relationship was a loving one, it was something you hoped yours and Luna&#39;s could copy, now that Luna had fully matured into her MILF-wolf form and then transformed you. You and Luna stood by as they slid their dresses down and stepped out of them, exposing their large but still firm breasts and then stepping out of their shoes to reveal what were large and for the moment human feet. The last things they removed were their panties, which were of a different design from those you and Luna got earlier in the day. Kellie and Roxie placed their clothes on the back of the couch and you and Luna continued to stand by as Kellie and Roxie began to transform almost immediately after doing so. It started with both of them giving rushed and pleasure filled moans as their fur began to grow in, Kellie&#39;s fur being black while Roxie&#39;s being blond, like Luna&#39;s.<br />
<br />
As with yours and Luna&#39;s transformations earlier in the day, Kellie and Roxie both grew in size and height. Particularly as their feet lengthened from plantigrade human feet into the long digitigrade wolf-like feet that all werewolves, including MILF-wolves have had. Their finger and toenails lengthened into claws. As it continued, Kellie and Roxie both moaned as their new fur covered breasts grew with them and drew their increasingly paw like hands to them. It got you and Luna to both wag your tails as Kellie and Roxie&#39;s ears became triangular and moved to the top of their heads. Kellie and Roxie both smiled back at you and Luna, and revealed enlarging teeth as their faces began to push forward into wolven muzzles and their tails grew out behind them. With a small howl, the two completed their transformations and leaving four MILF-wolves standing there in the Vaxer living room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah... that felt good,&quot; Roxie smiled, &quot;I must admit I was getting a bit cramped trying to hold it back for so long...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It always feels good,&quot; Kellie smiled back and then licked Roxie&#39;s cheek, &quot;though from there... there will be some things to discuss with Nicki.&quot;<br />
<br />
That then brought two pairs of golden eyes looking to you directly, and almost instinctively you let out a whimper and curled your tail between your legs while retreating toward Luna.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s no need to be afraid,&quot; Roxie commented, &quot;this is more about some planning for the pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Planning?&quot; you ask nervously, though with your ears also perked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Kellie nodded, &quot;and it would relate a bit to your foot fetish...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look... I&#39;m sorry if anything offered as a twist was offensive,&quot; you found yourself saying in a fairly submissive tone. Even being on par with Kellie&#39;s MILF-wolf form as a MILF-wolf yourself, you still seemed to see Luna&#39;s mother as the local Alpha and thus someone to be respected. That and with your hopes and plans for a happy ever after with Luna growing stronger, you also didn&#39;t want to trigger any sort of protective instincts that Kellie or Roxie might have regarding Luna.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was nothing offensive, I assure you,&quot; Roxie said to you, &quot;as I&#39;m sure Kellie or Luna have told you... when Kellie and I began to become aware that Kellie didn&#39;t become a normal werewolf, like the one that accidentally bit her and that Kellie had become the first MILF-wolf, it is something were we found ourselves running into a fair number of people with foot fetishes and seemed to especially like our feet while in MILF-wolf form.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And in a way we did like the attention,&quot; Kellie admitted, &quot;as in some ways it felt like a good massage. We&#39;ve never shared that specific fetish... but that doesn&#39;t mean we dislike the attention.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s something we think might actually help when new people join the pack,&quot; Roxie admitted, &quot;this wouldn&#39;t be something we can do much of now because of the Wolf Hunters, but once were sure that they&#39;re gone or won&#39;t be a threat... if someone wants to become a MILF-wolf and they have a foot fetish... you might be one that they&#39;d like the most because it&#39;d be something they would share with you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And don&#39;t worry,&quot; Kellie added as she came forward and placed her hands on your shoulders, &quot;it wouldn&#39;t be as though you&#39;re cheating on Luna... you&#39;d be inducting new members who have made it clear they want to become werewolves or MILF-wolves. A lot of it is formality. And from time to time, Roxie and I get tasked with that... and the same will go for you and Luna.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You wouldn&#39;t mind?&quot; you asked to Luna turning your head to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t mind,&quot; Luna answered, &quot;I might even help. It&#39;s been a funny thing... but nothing you need to be ashamed of and NOTHING that my parents will judge you over.&quot;<br />
<br />
You caught a hint of fierceness in Luna&#39;s voice that was actually aimed at Luna and Roxie, though given some of your nervousness over their wanting to talk about your fetish was hard to hid, it was entirely possible that Luna was also making sure to defend you.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we don&#39;t,&quot; Roxie answered, &quot;it&#39;s one of those things we&#39;ve never understood... but as said earlier, we don&#39;t mind the attention. Though it is something that we don&#39;t understand... at least not entirely.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I&#39;m afraid I really can&#39;t explain the origins of a foot fetish and where it came from,&quot; you said slowly, &quot;I don&#39;t even think I could fully explain how mine developed.  I just know that there was one day when I was fourteen, my dad had left his copy of the swimsuit issue out and it showed a woman&#39;s bare foot... and well... my focus seemed to be more on her feet than on the fact that she was actually topless in the photo but had her back to the camera so that the model&#39;s breasts and nipples weren&#39;t visible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your father left...&quot; Kellie began.<br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn&#39;t porn,&quot; you answered and then cupped your own generous bosom, &quot;the magazine NEVER let things like these be visible unless things that are supposed to be under cloth are either under cloth, hidden behind hands or something else, or that the model&#39;s back is to the camera so that her breasts were pointed the other way. Though... it generally was intended to &quot;entertain&quot; men.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what did your dad think?&quot; Luna asked in a semi-teasing voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... he did catch me looking at it,&quot; you admitted, &quot;and he wasn&#39;t too upset. Though when I said that the model had nice feet, he countered that wasn&#39;t the part I was to be attracted to.&quot;<br />
<br />
You were silent and looked down for a moment with your tail hanging limp. You began to wag it again when you felt Luna come slide up beside you.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose that&#39;s why you stayed quiet so much on the things you liked?&quot; Luna asked you.<br />
<br />
&quot;With regard to those desires... yes,&quot; you nodded, &quot;and it&#39;s not as though I don&#39;t like the other beautiful features women have... and now, I&#39;m glad to actually have them as a MILF-wolf... but I didn&#39;t want to get made fun of.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It must be extra ordinarily rare,&quot; Kellie said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It probably is,&quot; you answered, &quot;as feet aren&#39;t a sexual organ... like a penis or a vagina. And while there are a lot of nerve centers in the human foot... touching them is more likely to tickle and not cause sexual pleasure, so it&#39;s not an erogenous zone the way spots on the neck, breasts, sides, and butt can be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;People&#39;s necks can be ticklish too,&quot; Roxie commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you know it,&quot; Kellie gave a giggle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway... because it isn&#39;t something that directly relates to sex and reproduction, it isn&#39;t going to be as common and people like me are bound to be more cautious about announcing it because of how people might respond,&quot; you finished, &quot;before now... Luna was the only one I&#39;d ever told about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And it&#39;s the frame of a foot that you like?&quot; Roxie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That can probably vary,&quot; you answered, &quot;I&#39;ve tended to be into bigger feet... but I&#39;d suppose there could be those that have foot fetishes that may have different specific desires. And if some of the other women that you&#39;ve turned have foot fetishes... and thus ended up cutting their tongues on a toe claw... it may be better to ask them on what they like if you&#39;re wanting to understand more. As much of what I know is largely my own desires.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Kellie and Roxie said together, though it was Kellie who then continued, &quot;well... it is different, and while it may be rare nation wide... it&#39;s seemed to have been fairly prevalent in this area. So you won&#39;t be without friends who share those interests.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My prime interest is in Luna,&quot; you answered, &quot;to be there for her... to be a loving mate... and figure things out along the way... Such as explaining to my daughter why her father is a mature woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Honesty is the best policy,&quot; Roxie said as she came forward and took your hands in hers, &quot;when your daughter is old enough to understand how you became a MILF-wolf, you tell her that. You loved Luna, came on the night Luna had her first transformation, found out Luna loved you back, and impregnated her to then let Luna being a MILF-wolf turn you while your last &quot;male&quot; action impregnated Luna.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Though you&#39;ll have nine months before the baby is born,&quot; Kellie commented, &quot;and probably a few years before your daughter is old enough to understand all that. So, let&#39;s just take that as it develops. For if you and Luna become good parents, your daughter won&#39;t care on your past as a male. She&#39;ll know that you love her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; you managed, &quot;and I&#39;d be more than happy to help those that might wish to become MILF-wolves that have foot fetishes.&quot;<br />
<br />
To that, Kellie and Roxie smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;And thank you for explaining some things,&quot; Roxie answered<br />
<br />
&quot;Which then leaves things open to whether or not you want to do anything more tonight?&quot; Luna asked as she nuzzled her muzzle to yours.</p>
