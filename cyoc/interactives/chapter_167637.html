<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"> she hold out her hand and said &quot;come on then&quot;, I grabbed her hand not knowing what else to do still feeling like the seared boy, what i am stuck as right now, and followed her to the bathroom  where she turned the tap and filled the tub, when that was done she looked down at me and said “ time to get in the tub” putting her hands under my arms and lifting me into it, I just sat down once she let go and she said” now you start to get all of that dirt off your arms and your body and I will just rinse your hair, I just nodded as a response still feeling scared because of the stable boy in me finding this to be a lot. <br />
<br />
My mom started to pour water over my matted unkept long blond hear while I rubbed down my arms and leg getting rid of the weeks old mud what has just been stuck to me, it felt nice having my mom help wash me again, I started to feel a loving attachment to her what I haven&#39;t felt in years what I knew was the stable boy part of me beginning to trust and  like her, once we were done she said “all done” and lifted me out of the bath and said “wow that is a big improvement, look at you’re self, your a little cutey now” putting me down in Front of the mirror in the bathroom and what I saw was a completely different boy from what I looked like 20 minutes ago,  my hear what was a greasy mess of dirt and only went down to my ears by it being so matted, but now it is silky smooth and reached down to the middle of my back my face was now smooth and what can only be described as cute, then there was my body what you could see it was completely smooth but small for a 10 year old and I guess I never really payed to much attention to it while I was working at the stables, it was very muscular for a 10 year old I have a 8 pack with showable muscles all up my arm and my legs I guess that is what working in a stable 12 house a day gets you, I could easily be a child model now this was making me feel more like this kids body was achily mine and I was kind of liking it. <br />
<br />
While I was checking out my small body my mom was drying it off with me not thinking twice that there was anything wrong about it, not notice in that my 16 year old personality has been changed to match my now 10 year old body, the memories of the stable boy what was helping to make me feel safe and worm around my mom. I smiled at my reflection happy with the handsome boy staring back at me, and my mom said “i am glad you are feeling much betting” with a smile on her face seeing the lost boy she found in her sons room looking much better and happier. <br />
<br />
She finished of drying me and said “all done, now you stay here and I will get you some nice clean clothes, I will be 10 minutes ok?” I looked up at her suddenly feeling scared not wanting to be left alone and feeling she is going to leave me, what I did not want her to and shouted “NOO” feeling teas in my eyes knowing that I am acting just like a child but could not stop myself, she could see the fear in my face and said” don&#39;t warry I will be back and all you got to do is just sit up hear and wate for me” while she was saying that she lifted me and put me on the closed toilet, I looked up at her and said “ok” in a sad voce, when she left and I thought am I letting the stable boy mind take over  and realized I could not help acting like a child anymore, I tried to think of my old normal life but I could not stop feeling like the lost boy I now am, it was like I was still in control but being in this body was making me act how this body looks. <br />
<br />
It had been 10 minutes now and I could hear my mom on the phone not being able to hear anything she was saying with me being in the upstairs bathroom and her being down stars but she was only on the phone for 5 minutes, after another 5 minuets she came up and entered with some clothes in her hands what I could tell are some of my old clothes what I had when I was 8-10 years old. <br />
<br />
She looked at me and saw me staring at the clothes in her hands and said” well I can see you have been a good boy”, then she put the clothes on my lap and said “these are my sons when he was your age , you can borrow some of them” putting the clothes on my lap and then asked “can you dress yourself?” I just said “yes” in a quiet voce, not knowing how to act at that moment, I put on the clothes she got me and they were a green tank top, black briefs and my old red soccer shorts, once I was done I looked in the mirror and saw that the clothes looked a little baggy on me but looked fitting for a 10 years old having shaggy clothes, It actually suited my body and I smiled and felt really happy being naked what felt like my whole life and now having clothes given to me and I turned around and hugged my mom and said “thank you miss” what I could not fight off doing letting the kid inside me take over she just bent down and said “your welcome little one”, then the doorbell rang and my mom said” wow that was faster than I expected with her holding my hand and jested to follow her what I did not wanting to be left alone feeling safe in her grasp and we both started to head to the door...</p>
