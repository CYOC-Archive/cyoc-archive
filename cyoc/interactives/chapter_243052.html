<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Here, this might help you understand.”  Ryan would have jumped in surprise at the sound of the wizard’s voice, were it not for the object currently trying to pass through his hips.  Ryan had been so focused on his body’s agonized pushing, that he hadn’t noticed the wizard moving to the area next to his right.  Turning his head, Ryan saw the wizard gesturing to a strange hole in the wall.<br />
<br />
There, to Ryan’s side, was a portal that the wizard had conjured and, through it, the same chicken girl from earlier.  She was seated in a squat, looking at Ryan to the side of her.  Her tired eyes conveyed a sense of absolute terror at her current situation, while her gaping mouth panted in exhaustion.  The fleshy nub above Ryan’s butt quivered while the chicken girl’s long, elegant tailfeathers waggled in pain.  Just below that tail Ryan could see a huge white egg protruding out of her backside as she cupped it with one of her palms.<br />
<br />
Lifting his free hand, Ryan watched as the chicken girl mimicked him, but his viewing party was cut short as he felt the muscles in his stomach regain their strength and that same instinct to push began to overwhelm him.  Bearing down, Ryan’s stomach exploded into fire, and he began to close his eyes as he focused on the pain.  As his vision blackened, the last thing that Ryan saw was the chicken girl’s muscles tense as she leaned into her own squat.<br />
<br />
“BUCKKAWW!”  <br />
<br />
Ryan wanted to ask how the wizard who the chicken girl was.  Had the wizard switched places with her?  Or maybe there had been two wizards before?  But with Ryan’s muscles tearing themselves apart as they clenched, all he could manage was a string of chicken-like caws.<br />
<br />
Time began to lose its meaning as Ryan alternated between actively pushing and “relaxing” while his body forced him to suffer.  The rest of the world faded away, and while Ryan could still see and hear movement in the store around him, he found that he couldn’t focus on any of it.  With only the dimmest awareness of his surroundings, Ryan’s attention was firmly focused on the object inside of him and his desperate struggles to push it out.<br />
<br />
The worst part about what was going on was the fact that the object only seemed to move when Ryan actively pushed, but actively pushing only served to further his own agony.  Every miniscule effort that he put into clenching was rewarded by the object forcing his cunt every wider.  It always felt like he was stretched to his limit and that another push would tear him open.  Then he would push, the ring of flesh surrounding the object would burn ever hotter until he was sure he was going to explode, but the flesh would yield and the object would descend ever so slightly.<br />
<br />
That dichotomy of being forced to heighten his own agony was horrifying.  His baseline level of pain was so high that the only thing he could think about was how to relieve it, but the only way to get that relief was to push harder.  And the harder he pushed, the more he suffered.  Forcing this object out of his stomach was like forcing a knife deeper into it.<br />
<br />
Ryan sat in the middle of the store, pushing and clenching and cawing as he fought against his own body to seek relief from a pain whose source he couldn’t even comprehend.  He pushed harder and harder, felt the object move lower and lower – each time forcing himself to stretch beyond the limit that his body told him existed.  <br />
<br />
He pushed.  It burned.  He stretched.  The object pressed down further into his palm.  His stomach clenched, his muscles strained, his hips turned into vice for his own flesh, but the object continued to press down.  <br />
<br />
Another eternity of struggling and the object had now pressed so far out of him that it no longer fit in his palm.  Flesh protested as his body kept telling him to push.  The object moved further and further down.  <br />
<br />
Then he hit a point – he was continuing to push but no matter how much effort he seemed to put into it, his cunt simply could not stretch anymore.  *Push* his instincts told him.  “I can’t” he wanted to scream back.  *Push*<br />
<br />
*Push*<br />
<br />
*PUSH*<br />
<br />
“BUCKKAWWW!”  Ryan cawed out as his body forced him to tap into reserves that he didn’t know he had.  The object moved further, he stretched wider, and then, when it finally felt like he could stretch no more, there was one last surge of agony and the object passed out of his body, landing on the floor with loud clack.</p>
