<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff was thinking for a bit then he gets an idea. “I wonder what it’s like to have feet of a gorilla, maybe it would be fun.” He starts to type down some things<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Alter Reality: Y<br />
<br />

<br />
Jeff wondered what alter reality could be, but then took some thought into it and took a guess thinking his new feet would be normal and was born with it. He hit enter and started to feel his feet tingle, his shoes were getting cramped. Jeff tried hard to get his shoes off and when he did, his feet were complete. Jeff’s feet looked just like gorilla feet with a little gorilla fur on the top with human skin. Jeff smiled to see his feet and changed into something amazing. A strong smell of gorilla musk is coming from his new feet, Jeff loved the smell and tried to put his feet closer to his face to smell them but struggled. <br />
Jeff got another idea, he started to type on his computer again and made his legs more flexible and increase his balance. Now without any effort, Jeff put his foot close to his face and sniffed hard, loving the smell of gorilla musk. Jeff suddenly heard his front door open, it was his father. Jeff jumped as he heard his father’s voice call for him, but he also notices his voice sounded a little deeper. Jeff walks out his room to a surprise, his father is an anthro gorilla, he just got home from work and looks tired. “How was your day Jeff?” Jeff’s dad asked as he sits on the couch in the living room. “It was okay.” Jeff replied, he then walked back to his room while his father starts to fall asleep. A couple minutes passed, and Jeff walks out to check on his dad, he walks into the living room and can smell a strong scent of gorilla musk.<br />
Jeff was thinking how hot his dad looked when he was sleeping wearing only his boxers. He walked up closer and the gorilla musk was getting stronger. Jeff looked down at his gorilla father’s feet, he wanted to do some nasty things with them. He then got on his knees and started to rub his father’s feet while sniffing them in pleasure and beginning to lick them. Jeff couldn’t believe what he was doing but he didn’t care, he loved it. Eventually, Jeff started to lick between his toes and then moved on the other foot. He knew his father was heavy sleeper and doing this wouldn’t wake him up. Jeff finished licking his father’s feet and then sees his huge cock popping out of his boxers, Jeff pulls his pants down and his dad’s cock wobbles leaking pre. Jeff couldn’t help himself, he begins to lick his father’s cock all over and starts to suck his cock hard. Soon, Jeff’s mouth filled with his father’s delicious, sticky, and slimy cum, drinking all of it down, there was so much. Jeff almost couldn’t handle it, his father simply had so much cum and wouldn’t stop, but Jeff kept drinking as much as he could, he felt like a cum slut, he felt like he was a cum slut, he already feels the need to become a cum slut. Eventually his father stopped cumming and Jeff can feel his belly full of his father’s cum, he then pulls his father’s boxers back on and sneaked away as if nothing happened. Jeff was already craving more cum even though his stomach was full of his father’s. Jeff sat in his chair and went to his desk and put of his feet of the desk while playing gay porn on his computer and begins sucking himself.  Jeff very soon began to cum loads into his mouth, he could feel his belly inflating with his and his father’s cum. Jeff closed his computer and laid on his bed, patting his inflated belly and falling asleep. The next morning, Jeff woke up and his belly was back to being flat and his very lean body was back to normal. Jeff got morning wood but was too tired to get to it, he then got up and sees his boxers are covered in cum stains, so he changes into new ones and he hears his little brother come in, he is not an anthro gorilla like their dad, but he does too have gorilla feet. “Oh good you’re awake, I was gonna tell you to get up.” Jeff’s little brother, David, says to Jeff then looks at his obvious morning wood. “But I always wake up around 5 am, I don’t need you to wake me up.” Jeff says as he walks closer to David. “Well I’ll take any excuse to get a nice look at your good looking hard cock, hehehe.” David says as he rubs Jeff’s bulge and giggles again. “Don’t be a prevent, especially at your age, sheesh.” Jeff says as he pushes David’s arm away. David walks out and then his big brother, Lance, who is an anthro gorilla, walks in naked and closes the door behind him. “Hey bro, I need a hand, or foot again.” Lance said he sits on Jeff’s bed. Jeff sees Lance’s thick, long and hard cock and knew what he meant. “Sure thing, anything for you Lance.” Jeff says in a sexy-ish voice while also sounding nervous. Jeff laid on the floor while Lance was sitting on Jeff’s bed and Jeff lifts his legs up and uses his gorilla feet to rub his cock. “Ohhh fuck yeah, you’re so much better at this than David.” Lance said followed up with a small moan. “David does this to you?” Jeff says, and Lance gives him a weird look. “Yeah, don’t you remember, he sometimes would give up foot jobs and blowjobs, he wanted to be slut like you, I don’t know why but that’s what he wants.” Lance says as he continues to moan, Jeff was a little confused. “Does dad know that David and I want to be sluts?” Jeff continues the conversation. “Hell no, you told me to keep it a secret, besides he’s not even here, he’s out. I honestly don’t know why this is something you and David want to do, but I get free pleasure from it, so I can’t complain.” Lance then gives a small laugh. “Shit man I’m getting close, get ready.” Lance looks as if he’s ready to blow, Jeff rubs his cock faster and opens his mouth, ready for some cum on him. Within a small moment, Lance blew a huge load, it was bigger than when Jeff sucked his father. Jeff couldn’t get all in his mouth, most of it got on his face, chest, the floor and even his feet. “Oh yeah, that was great, thanks bro.” He then gets up and walks out with his cock dripping cum. Jeff scooped up some cum off his chest and drank it and gets the cum on his face, then licked the cum off his feet. Jeff was pretty happy for his new life, but he feels like he could do more.</p>
