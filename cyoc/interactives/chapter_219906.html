<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alec woke up in pain, with another minotaur roughly kicking him in the ribs and snarling. For a moment he was disoriented, forgetting what body he was in, his plans, and the vague memories of a dream where his cock was thick and hard enough he could knock trees over by swinging it. He mumbled a quick apology which fell on deaf ears as the other minotaur kept kicking and prodding until he&#39;d donned his armor, grabbed his axe, and marched out.<br />
<br />
He was hoping to spend the day looking for where the females were hidden away, but apparently the body he was borrowing had more responsibilities than just guard duty. The other minotaur didn&#39;t bother to speak a word beyond a very angry &quot;move!&quot; At least not with his mouth, he kept prodding Alec in the back with the haft of his axe to steer him out of the camp and over to some trees, where he was forced to chop wood and haul it back. At first it was nice being able to use those strong minotaur muscles, but it was long back-breaking labor. After what felt like days, the other wood cutters set down a final load of logs, and started heading towards some sort of a park. Alec figured this meant it was break time and tried to sneak off, but a very meaty hand smacked him upside the head and one of the others barked &quot;eat, dumbass!&quot;<br />
<br />
He really hadn&#39;t thought about it, but if minotaurs were humanoid cows, it did stand to reason that they might graze like cows too. Sure enough, the others were just bending over and chewing the grass. He followed suit. The taste wasn&#39;t as bad as he feared, but it wasn&#39;t great either. Sort of like a very dry salad without any sort of dressing. Still, he stuffed his face with grass as fast as he could, still wanting to slip away, when a whole mouthful suddenly came back up on him. As he puked out the sticky wad of chewed up grass, the other minotaurs around him looked disgusted.<br />
<br />
&quot;HEY WHY YA DROP YER CUD!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Guy&#39;s been actin&#39; dumb as a damn cow all day! He get kicked in the head?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey what the hell&#39;s wrong with you!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alec started to panic. He&#39;d really been hoping instincts would kick right in and he&#39;d be able to play the part just fine, but he was really drawing way too much attention now. The rest of these minotaurs were starting to look like if he didn&#39;t start explaining himself and acting like they expected they might just beat him senseless, or maybe drag him to the local wizard who&#39;d know he was in here, or who knows what else. He really had been planning to be all stealthy, but plan A really seemed to just be totally falling apart. He looked around for someone hanging back from the rest of the crowd and trying not to be too loud about it said, &quot;possession!&quot;<br />
<br />
His head swam a bit as his perspective shifted. Now there was definitely a big crowd forming around his last host, who clearly remembered a thing or two. Alec didn&#39;t catch everything he was saying as he tried to sneak off but he definitely heard the words &quot;body stolen&quot; and &quot;weird pervert.&quot; He&#39;d just have to act fast now was all. Just had to find a female...<br />
<br />
Of course, shuffling off in a hurry in the exact opposite direction from where the angry mob was starting to form was itself pretty suspicious, and it wasn&#39;t long before a group of three more minotaurs cornered him to ask why he wasn&#39;t checking in on things by the pasture. Still in a bit of a panic, he looked around for someone even further away, and said &quot;someone said something about possession!&quot;<br />
<br />
Alec shook his third head in about as many minutes, really feeling a bit dizzy. He hadn&#39;t really thought about it before, but there might be some sort of limit to this body switching thing he was going to run into if he did it so rapidly. Of course, his last host was now staring right at his new one, and the whole group was starting to move his way. He ducked down a side street, trying to think of a way to keep this from snowballing even more, and came up short. Just openly running now, he kept looking desperately around for something safe. Suddenly he saw a rather large building with quite a lot of faces staring out from the windows. Maybe he could jump into one of them and this guy wouldn&#39;t notice which? One more time, he shouted &quot;possession!&quot;<br />
<br />
Now Alec was looking out the window rather than in, and felt just completely exhausted on some sort of spiritual level. This new body felt a lot different too.  Heavy chest. Heavy belly. He looked away from the window at the others. Lots of cow girls. Trough with water. Hay bales. Males still being loud outside.</p>
