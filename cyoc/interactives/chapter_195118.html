<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Having no other option, Samuel unpacks his things, clears the bed as much as he can, and rests. Head hitting the thankfully clear sheet, nose buried under pillows as he tries to avoid the environment around him and escape into his dreams. The fatigue of the day hitting him hard, eyes heavy as he drifts off to sleep...<br />
<br />
Though as morning hits the next day, Samuel is immediately woken. The door to his room opening, Matt stepping inside. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s 8 am, wake up!&quot;<br />
<br />
He says with a laugh, Samuel letting out a quiet sigh as he forces himself to sit up and looks at Matt. Thankful that he is clothed rather than naked, dressed in a white singlet and brown cargo shorts. Though that dress is rather light, and Sam can&#39;t help but see the meaty arms and legs that are exposed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Going from sleeping to daydreaming? Fucks sake...&quot;<br />
Matt steps closer, Samuel rising from the bed and getting to his feet.<br />
&quot;No, no. I&#39;m awake.&quot;<br />
Matt stops a few steps before reaching Sam.<br />
&quot;Good, I&#39;m about to start a round of training. Want in?&quot;<br />
<br />
His mind is immediately made up &#39;fuck no&#39;, but he can&#39;t realistically say that to this brute. He&#39;ll either sound crazy, or be forced into it. But still, his head shakes and Matt seems frustrated. Approaching once more and roughly grabbing Sam&#39;s arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, come on, you&#39;re barely thicker than a twig.&quot;<br />
It&#39;s now or never, Samuel thought. Freeing himself from the man’s grip and responding.<br />
&quot;So what? I like being like this. Don&#39;t want to change that.&quot;<br />
&quot;Just give it a shot, you might like it.&quot;<br />
&quot;No! I&#39;m done with people trying to force me to do this sort of thing. First my former housemate and now you!&quot;<br />
<br />
He immediately regretted what he said. Fearful of what response awaited him, what this stranger would do to him. All these feelings rising by the second as he saw Matt fall silent, mask his emotions, and close the door. Locking the two of them in the room together, before sitting on the edge of the bed. Sam stood still, just watching, hoping whatever was happening would at least leave him with his senses.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the silence is broken. Matt patting the space to his right.<br />
&quot;Hey, sit.&quot;<br />
Samuel watched for a few more moments, noticing that his companion was not furious, but smiling. A gentle, inviting expression, while he waited for Sam&#39;s response. The novelist deciding there was no other option once more, as he took a seat on the bed. Stiff, arms resting on his lap, head low.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not going to force you to work out, none of us here are.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well-&quot;<br />
&quot;Fuck, I&#39;m not going to force you to do anything. Anyone here tries to, I&#39;ll get in the way.&quot;<br />
&quot;What-&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a guest, we&#39;re looking after you. What kinda dumbass forces his guests to do things they don&#39;t want to. I wanna see you get some brawn, but if you don&#39;t want that, you don&#39;t want that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Was this really happening? Sam&#39;s mind almost failed to process what he had just heard. Matt and his family weren&#39;t going to force anything on him? Then why was he locked in this house after trying to escape? There still has to be something else going on... but he doesn&#39;t feel like Matts lying. Samuel looking into the emerald eyes of the other man, gazing at his short brown hair and cleaned up stubble. He had always admired the male form, and Matt’s not a bad looker...<br />
<br />
He shakes his head, those are not the thoughts he wants. Not now. Those will lead him down a pathway he is trying to avoid. Still, the thought lingers, and the dreamy gaze is noticed.<br />
&quot;Hah, like what you see?&quot;<br />
&quot;W-what!&quot;<br />
&quot;I saw how you&#39;re looking at me.&quot;<br />
&quot;No I-I was just-&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt flexed his left arm, showing the taunt muscle. Large biceps toned and fit. Skin tanned and with a light covering of brown hairs. Though the real show is what he sees as the arm is lifted, pit full of short thick hairs. Smell reaching Samuel even at this distance. Earthy, rugged, virile. The BO of a brute, of a warrior, of a protector. Masculine, young, and all encompassing. He immediately feels his cock press against his boxers, stretching the fibre as Sam has no chance to resist. But at the same time, he doesn&#39;t want to resist. Matt isn&#39;t forcing anything, he&#39;s nice and friendly. Playful even. Rather than run, he stays still, and smiles. Matt ending the show as he asks,<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a good looker, ain&#39;t I?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah... you are.&quot;<br />
&quot;Hah! Knew it, eat shit Harry!&quot;<br />
<br />
The two laugh, enjoying the moment together. Matt wrapping his right arm around his new friend, and Samuel going with the motion. Resting his head against the other man’s shoulder, secured in the firm grip, and happy with it all.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not a bad looker either, you know.&quot;<br />
&quot;Huh? Really?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, scrawny and thin, but still good for the eyes. Being a nice guy under it all also helps.&quot;<br />
&quot;...Still only known each other for a few minutes.&quot;<br />
&quot;Can change that. You got time, so let’s hang out. Doesn&#39;t have to be fitness, can just be a conversation, eat over a meal, cheer me on as I beat my brother in everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samuel is happy with the proposition. He is stuck here, so why not enjoy it. Just avoid the fitness, avoid that stink, and make a friend. Maybe something more, considering how fast his heart is already beating. Though being this close to Matts pits is not good for his willpower, and in a few more moments he starts taking deep sniffs of the surrounding air. Cock throbbing even more, and Sam unable to suppress a quiet moan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit, you&#39;re hard as a rock Sam.&quot;<br />
&quot;W-what!&quot;<br />
<br />
He breaks the moment and steps back, looking down at his tented pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I-&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s alright, just jack off and you&#39;ll feel better. I can help you with it if you want.&quot;<br />
&quot;N-no I am not-.&quot;<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
He clears his throat, heart beating faster than his cock is throbbing.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll deal with it. Please just... leave for now, okay? I don&#39;t want help with this, not right now.&quot;<br />
Once more, Matt offers a friendly smile.<br />
&quot;Fair enough, Sam. Come see me when you&#39;re settled.&quot;<br />
Before breaking into a grin.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be beating my brother in sit ups, come cheer me on if you can!&quot;<br />
Then heading out of the door.<br />
<br />
Sam sits back on the bed, unable to relax. Hand reaching into his boxers and taking a hold of his dick. Just feeling the girth to start, before rubbing the uncircumcised pole in time with the throbs. So much happened in what... twenty minutes. He thought Matt would force him to exercise but he turned out to be a nice guy. A bit rough around the edges and a huge show-off, but still a nice guy.<br />
<br />
His face strains as the pleasure escalates, deciding to stop the strokes and start to thrust against the bed instead. Dick rubbing against fabric which rubs against the sheets. Spreading into his bedding as he thinks more of that moment. More of how nice it just was to be next to Matt. Sam&#39;s had crushes on other guys before, but those guys have never reciprocated. They either didn&#39;t like his looks, were already taken, or were straight. At least, he thought they were straight, Darrel seemed to like the male form as much as he did after he started to change...<br />
<br />
His thoughts are interrupted as he feels his load approach. Thoughts gone back to Matt and that moment shared between them, pressed tight against his bulky protector. Embraced, loved, welcomed. A groan escaping his lips as his boxers are sprayed with cum, seed leaking past the fabric and planted in his own sheets. Samuel resting on his stomach for a rest seconds, before flipping onto his back. Panting, and smiling.<br />
<br />
No longer knowing if he should or should not resist. No longer knowing if he should or should not train. But knowing one thing for certain. He wanted to be close with Matt, learn about him, and be with him. It was love at first sight, and his heart was set.</p>
