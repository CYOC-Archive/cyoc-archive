<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jensen began roaming around the manor. He had new memories but he needed to see for himself. Kaylee had gone to check on the pups. They needed to be separate right now. They both had a sense of loss and being together just brought that to the fore. As he walked along he noticed pictures of the pack. They must have been taken in the mirrorverse since all were wearing clothes. Of course he had memories of dressing up for some social functions. Society did frown on public displays of nudity. He came to one picture showing him, Kaylee, Fran, Darla, Julie, and their pups. &quot;That's odd,&quot; he said to himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's odd?&quot; Fran asked coming up to Jensen.<br />
<br />
Jensen pointed to the picture and asked, &quot;What do you see?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it's a picture of us and the pups,&quot; Fran said then took a closer look. &quot;But there are three more pups in it and two look like ghosts. What does that mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; Jensen admitted. &quot;The new one with Julie and Abbey is Elisabeth. Born on the same day as Alice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I remember delivering them since Julie couldn't,&quot; Fran said tilting her head. &quot;But I have no memory of the other two.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't either,&quot; Jensen said with a sigh. &quot;I suppose we'll find out sooner or later. Now how is everyone?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well there were only a few broken bones,&quot; Fran said looking thoughtful. &quot;Most of the injuries were bites and scratches with some chunks of flesh eaten off. I haven't seen everyone yet though. Darla and Julie are still on the island along with the gem wolves. Lawrence is still there too and we need to get him back here to see what damage was done to his shoulder.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why aren't they back yet?&quot; Jensen asked surprise evident on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;The gem wolves and Lawrence don't seem to want to leave according to the last report I got,&quot; Fran said. &quot;Darla and Julie won't leave until everyone else has left the island. They believe it's their duty as Betas.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Jensen said rubbing his chin. &quot;I suppose I'll have to go to the island so they will come back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That may not be the best idea,&quot; Fran said hesitating a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;And why is that?&quot; Jensen asked in a commanding tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;You might not want to come back if you do go,&quot; Fran said. &quot;I don't know exactly what happened but from what I was told it looks like Kurse twisted their minds to no end. I bet she did the same to you and Kaylee.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen didn't reply immediately but rather looked at the ceiling. Kurse had indeed twisted their minds and he felt a compulsion to go back to the island. &quot;Kurse is dead right?&quot; he finally asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's what Gill said when I called him to warn him about a second Glass,&quot; Fran said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why do I feel the need to go back to the island?&quot; Jensen asked no one in particular.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Kaylee found the pups in the library reading. Martha was standing guard over them keeping an eye on any reflective surface. What surprised her was the fact that there six human children with them and they were dressed. Jenny looked up from her book and ran to her yelling, MOMMY,&quot; at the top of her lungs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello my precious,&quot; Kaylee said as she hugged Jenny then her other pups. As she did she shivered remembering that Kurse had twisted her mind so much that the only thing in her mind was being with Jensen and a statue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ok Mommy?&quot; Marcy asked evidently feeling Kaylee shiver.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I am now that I'm here with you,&quot; Kaylee said smiling and giving her pups a lick on their faces. She never wanted to leave them again. They were just as big a part of her life as Jensen was. &quot;Who are your friends?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They were the ones that came through the mirror with Samantha,&quot; Jenny said. Then gesturing to each in turn she said, &quot;This is Jose, Maria, Pedro, Mark, Amanda, and Candice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee noticed that all the human children were cringing back from her and Martha. She could guess why and said, &quot;We're not going to hurt you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we wanted to take your pups and kill Amy,&quot; Candice said her voice quavering.<br />
<br />
&quot;You weren't yourselves,&quot; Kaylee said with a smile. &quot;You weren't responsible for what you did. So don't blame yourselves as we don't.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want my mommy and daddy,&quot; Amanda said and the others nodded their agreement.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll see them just as soon as we can arrange it,&quot; Kaylee promised.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why can't we go through the mirror?&quot; Jose asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you would be changed if you did,&quot; Kaylee said, &quot;and we don't want that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We didn't change when we came through the mirror the first time,&quot; Mark pointed out. &quot;Why would this time be different?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because it's part of the glass pup's power to change anyone they take through the mirror,&quot; Kaylee said. &quot;Anyone that they take who isn't part of the pack or whose form isn't locked would become a little glass wolf pup girl. Now I don't think the boys will want that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jose and Pedro both shuddered and said, &quot;No.&quot; Mark however looked like he wouldn't mind becoming a girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then you can't go through the mirrors,&quot; Kaylee said. &quot;But I promise that you will be reunited with your parents. No child should be deprived of their parents. Now what are you reading?&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;LET ME OUT,&quot; Glass screamed trying to rip the bars out. She and what was now Denise were in the curse world still. They were in what looked like an old fashioned cell. &quot;LET ME OUT,&quot; Glass screamed again. &quot;THE CHAOS MUST NEVER END.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please stop yelling,&quot; Denise pleaded. &quot;It hurts my ears.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't care about your ears,&quot; Glass growled. &quot;I don't care about you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You must care a bit though,&quot; Denise said looking down.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't,&quot; Glass snarled. &quot;All I care about is getting out of here so I can spread the chaos like Mother wanted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You won't get out until it's time,&quot; a man in old fashioned clothes said coming into sight.<br />
<br />
&quot;When will that be?&quot; Denise asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why when you're executed of course,&quot; the man said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Denise asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll be hung until you are dead,&quot; the man said.<br />
<br />
Glass laughed and said, &quot;I don't breathe and I'm indestructible fool.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That does not mean you are invincible,&quot; the man said. &quot;We just have to hang this one,&quot; he pointed at Denise, &quot;and both of you will die since you are the same.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You need your eyes checked,&quot; Glass said. &quot;We are clearly not them same.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Slap the other one then if you don't believe me,&quot; the man said.<br />
<br />
Glass turned around and slapped Denise right across her snout. &quot;Ow,&quot; both Denise and Glass said at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;You see,&quot; the man said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you going to kill us?&quot; Glass asked in a low growl.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would think that would be obvious,&quot; the man said. &quot;You are evil and you want to spread that evil. We can not allow that to happen. We could not do anything before but now we can and we shall. Enjoy the remaining moments of life that you have left.&quot; With that the man walked off.<br />
<br />
Glass went back to trying to pry the bars loose. She looked back and said, &quot;Help me so we can get out of here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't care about me,&quot; Denise said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's true but I do care about myself,&quot; Glass said. &quot;If we don't get out of here we will die. Do you want to see your mother again?&quot;<br />
<br />
Denise sighed and went to help Glass. Perhaps if they did work together they would be able to get out of here.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Rick slowly came back to consciousness to hear a girl speaking. &quot;Rick, that name simply won't do,&quot; she said sounding like she was talking to herself. &quot;Elisabeth would do much better I think. Yes it would. You're not the same as when you woke this morning. Or should that be yesterday? No matter you are different now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick groaned and opened his eyes. He saw the wolf girl above him. &quot;Oh Elisabeth you're awake,&quot; she said happily. &quot;I was afraid you would never wake up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you call me Elisabeth?&quot; Rick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you're like me now,&quot; the wolf girl said. &quot;You're a little glass girl wolf pup.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?&quot; Rick asked as he suddenly sat up and felt a wave of nausea pass through him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry but it was the only way I could think of to save you,&quot; the wolf girl said. &quot;I brought you into the mirrorverse and because I have the power to transform someone who is not part of the pack into someone like me when I do and so you became like me. I'm Alice by the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alice as in the Alice in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass?&quot; Rick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I'm obviously not that Alice but that's what my transform was based on,&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
Rick looked at Alice and had to smile. She was wearing the knee length blue dress and white pinafore that Alice was known for. He looked down to see that he was wearing the same thing except his dress was white and his pinafore was a pale yellow. He moved his hand underneath the dress and was able to confirm what Alice had said. He was a girl now and a wolf girl at that. &quot;I'm not glass though,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're only glass in the outside world,&quot; Alice said. &quot;In the mirrorverse we are flesh and blood.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well this is most curious,&quot; Rick said. &quot;I'm a girl now and a wolf.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can also move through any reflective surface,&quot; Alice said. &quot;You can also travel between any reflective surface in three steps when you're in the mirrorverse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that is curious,&quot; Rick said. &quot;Of course things have become curiouser and curiouser since the yacht landed on the island.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we shouldn't sit here and kill time Elisabeth,&quot; Alice said getting up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Most certainly not,&quot; Rick said and took the hand Alice offered to help her up. Looking around she said, &quot;This doesn't look like Looking Glass House.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is different,&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for saving me Alice and for giving me my new name,&quot; Elisabeth said accepting what she was.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are most welcome,&quot; Alice said. She took Elisabeth's hand and together they left the mirrorverse emerging in the outside world from Abbey's skin.<br />
<br />
Elisabeth looked at herself and said, &quot;This is pretty queer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that you Rick?&quot; Abbey asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's Elisabeth now Abbey,&quot; Elisabeth said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I killed you though,&quot; Gilbert said in a shocked tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;You nearly did,&quot; Elisabeth said, &quot;and I forgive you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You... you forgive... me?&quot; Gilbert asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Elisabeth said. &quot;I know that you weren't in your right mind. You had your very soul twisted by Kurse same as I. That will leave scars that will take time to heal. You just have to remember who you are and your love for Gwen. That should help you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You really forgive me?&quot; Gilbert asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I do Gilbert,&quot; Elisabeth said. &quot;I mean what I say and I say what I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a question for you Elisabeth,&quot; Darla said. &quot;Are you loyal to the pack?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seeing as how I'm a wolf pup now with nowhere else to go I suppose I am,&quot; Elisabeth said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We might be able to change you back to how you were,&quot; Julie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thank you for the offer but I believe I'll stay like this,&quot; Elisabeth said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can't change her back anyway,&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We think we can,&quot; Darla said. &quot;She wasn't given the special turn that locked our forms.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You forget the terms of my transform,&quot; Alice said. &quot;Anyone that I took into the mirrorverse who wasn't a part of the pack would become like me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darla and Julie looked at each other in confusion. Finally Julie asked, &quot;But why does that mean she can't turn back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe I know,&quot; Elisabeth said thinking it over. &quot;Since her form is locked anyone that's made like her would also have their form locked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure Alice?&quot; Darla asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course Mother,&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
Darla and Julie sighed while Abbey cried out, &quot;I didn't mean to turn Dennis into Denise. It's my fault she's like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elisabeth hugged Abbey and Julie hugged both of them. &quot;It's not your fault Abbey,&quot; Julie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It just happened,&quot; Elisabeth said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You couldn't have known just when Kurse would die,&quot; Julie said. &quot;You did try to get her out of the mirrorverse before that. That's what matters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't blame you,&quot; Maylene said kneeling down and looking at Denise.<br />
<br />
&quot;You lost your son though,&quot; Abbey said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I did but my love is still the same,&quot; Maylene said. &quot;I'll become like you and that way I'll still be with her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll be her sister/cousin,&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well since I've never had a sister before that will be a new experience,&quot; Maylene said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about your family though?&quot; Julie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Denise's father was a bad man,&quot; Maylene said. &quot;He was killed in a shoot out with the police. Fortunately he was such a bad aim that he didn't hit them and luckily he didn't hit anyone else either. Other than that I have no family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't have a boyfriend?&quot; Darla asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well the only one I was interested in was Rick,&quot; Maylene said. &quot;But now that he's Elisabeth that isn't possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Elisabeth will be your sister/cousin,&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
Maylene nodded and said, &quot;We'll be a family then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure you want to become a glass wolf pup?&quot; Darla asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am,&quot; Maylene said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then Alice will take you into the mirrorverse,&quot; Darla said.<br />
<br />
&quot;May I take her Mommy,&quot; Elisabeth said looking up at Julie. &quot;She's my friend and since she won't be able to wear the birthday present I got for her I thought that this might become her birthday present from me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a reasonable request,&quot; Julie said nodding to Darla.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Elisabeth you can take Maylene into the mirrorverse,&quot; Darla said. &quot;I want you to go in right behind them Alice and show them to the manor. Then I want you back here to help get the rest of the pack off the island.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course Mother,&quot; Alice said curtsying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take my hand Maylene,&quot; Elisabeth said holding out her hand and smiling.<br />
<br />
Maylene smiled and took hold of Elisabeth's hand. &quot;This isn't going to hurt is it?&quot; she asked looking a little worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Abbey said. &quot;It just feels funny.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Maylene said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here we go,&quot; Elisabeth said diving into Abbey dragging Maylene with her. She hit the ground and thought that she had lost her grip on Maylene until she fell on top of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that was a funny feeling,&quot; Maylene said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn't know,&quot; Elisabeth said. She looked at Maylene. She had blond fur and the same knee length dress as she did. The only difference was Maylene's dress was a pale yellow and her pinafore was white. Maylene also appeared to be the same age as she and Alice.<br />
<br />
Alice squeezed into the mirrorverse behind them and smiled when she landed on the ground. &quot;Now to go to the manor,&quot; she said holding out her hands. &quot;Just three steps,&quot; she said once Elisabeth and Maylene had taken her hands.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Julie watched as her oldest daughter took Maylene into the mirrorverse. Once Alice had followed she looked at Gilbert and said, &quot;I need you to do something for us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; Gilbert asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go back to the yacht and tell them to sail to Glendale,&quot; Julie said. &quot;There will be children there who I'm sure want their parents.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Gilbert said. &quot;If this one will let go of me I'll do it right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead and let him go Ulysses,&quot; Julie said. Once he had let Gilbert go she told him where Glendale was.<br />
<br />
After Gilbert had left Darla asked, &quot;Are you sure you should have told him that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to get the people off this island,&quot; Julie said. &quot;The parents should be able to get the other passengers on to the yacht and they should head off. Right now we need to get the other wolves ready to leave.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Darla said nodding.</p>
