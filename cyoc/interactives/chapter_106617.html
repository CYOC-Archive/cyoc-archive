<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When the office aide came to Spencer Lawson&#39;s study hall period saying her presence was requested in the Principal&#39;s office, she didn&#39;t know what to think. The last time she got such a summons was when Principal Andrews was gathering facts about the Julie Stovall situation.<br />
Being a Sophomore, she didn&#39;t share lunch with her friends (and lovers) Eric Anderson and Frieda Knight, so didn&#39;t bother to hide her surprised look upon discovering them there. She sat down next to them as the Administrative Assistant (secretary) told the three of them that &quot;Principal Andrews and Sheriff Cooper will be with you in a minute.&quot;<br />
In that brief minute alone, Spencer looked at Eric and Frieda. Being the closest, Eric whispered in a low voice, &quot;Don&#39;t say anything about Brian Walker&#39;s aunt,&quot; which drew even more puzzled looks from his girlfriend before Principal Andrews requested the three of them in his office.<br />
The men stood and let the ladies sit in the guest chairs in front of the Principal&#39;s desk as Sheriff Cooper laid out the situation for them.<br />
&quot;So we have no idea at this time who actually sent those damaging e-mails to my office and Brian Walker&#39;s mother. There&#39;s no evidence of any crime being committed, since it was just Walker&#39;s aunt picking him up from school the last three days while she&#39;s up here on vacation,&quot; said Sheriff Cooper.<br />
&quot;Brian warned us about this during lunch,&quot; revealed Eric, &quot;and he suspects Julie Stovall.&quot;<br />
&quot;That is a logical assumption, under the circumstances,&quot; agreed the Sheriff. &quot;However, I&#39;ve already executed a warrant to search her personal computer and found no evidence to support that theory at this time. However, that doesn&#39;t mean she&#39;s completely innocent in this situation, or that the three of you are not potential targets. The culprit could be someone working on Julie&#39;s behalf.&quot;<br />
&quot;But from what I&#39;ve seen on social media and heard around the school, most of Julie&#39;s friends are distancing themselves from her at least for the time being, if they haven&#39;t already dumped her out right,&quot; pointed out Frieda, not mentioning that she was in the dumping category herself.<br />
&quot;Which will make finding who actually sent those e-mails more challenging,&quot; agreed the Sheriff.<br />
&quot;So, what can we expect and how do we defend ourselves from it?&quot; asked Spencer.<br />
&quot;If the sender&#39;s objective is to discredit you before you testify against Julie, something slanderous, even if it&#39;s not actually true. Just like the situation with Brian&#39;s aunt, something innocent was twisted into what it wasn&#39;t,&quot; pointed out the Sheriff, still trying to protect his cousin Alyssa while getting to the bottom of this mess. Since both Alyssa and Brian are active weres, no actual laws were broken despite the fact they had plenty of sex together*, and he had enough of a mess on his hands without adding to it.<br />
&quot;And if they plan to do worse than simply lie about us?&quot; asked Eric.<br />
&quot;We&#39;re not expecting an actual physical attack against any of you. I can guarantee your safety on campus during school hours, but we just wanted to warn you to be alert when you&#39;re not here to be on the safe side,&quot; said Principal Andrews. &quot;Now I&#39;ll make sure you all get back to your next destinations without any hassles from being tardy or marked absent.&quot;<br />
&quot;Before we go,&quot; began Frieda, &quot;if we are in any physical danger, it won&#39;t be from some agent, but from Julie Stovall herself. Any attempt at physical revenge is something she&#39;d want to handle personally. Are you sure there is absolutely no way she can deactivate that ankle bracelet I hear she has to wear?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah. My dad&#39;s a Navy SEAL, and they&#39;re specially trained to overcome any obstacle. An ankle monitor might slow him down for a bit, but it wouldn&#39;t stop him for long,&quot; bragged Spencer.<br />
&quot;You kids really think Julie Stovall might be that vindictive?&quot; asked Principal Andrews, greatly concerned.<br />
&quot;Considering how long I&#39;ve known her, yes,&quot; revealed Frieda, while Eric and Spencer shook their heads in agreement.<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t find any evidence of her trying to research how to fool or deactivate her ankle monitor on her computer either,&quot; began Sheriff Cooper. &quot;Besides, most of those websites who claim to have that information are bogus anyway. But considering this is Moon Lake, we&#39;ve taken into account the possibility of a were trying to do that long ago. Despite me explaining the odds against her, if Julie Stovall&#39;s stupid enough to attempt overcoming her ankle monitor, she&#39;s going to be in for a rude awakening,&quot; bragged Sheriff Cooper.<br />
&quot;You mean it&#39;s booby trapped?&quot; asked Spencer, but the Sheriff&#39;s only reply was to thank them for their time and input.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
&quot;Mister Knight? There&#39;s a Mrs. Tachibana no Akane out here requesting an audience with you,&quot; the secretary said into her intercom.<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; asked the voice on the other end. &quot;Two things Mary. First, I told you to call me Lance, and secondly, send her in immediately!&quot;<br />
A moment later, the leader of the Skulk was face to face with Benton Knight&#39;s younger brother**, despite the fact he was a good foot taller than her.<br />
&quot;Mrs. Tachibana,&quot; said Lance, bowing to her out of respect. &quot;You honor <i>The Moon Lake Gazette</i> and myself with your presence,&quot;  he added, indicating the editor&#39;s office of the newspaper he owned and ran. Then he stood straight up again and asked, &quot;To what do I owe this honor?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m here on official were council business,&quot; the leader of the Skulk announced, while pulling out a parchment scroll from her business jacket.<br />
The man took it from her, staring at the red wax seal with the imprint of a paw print on it, and admitted, &quot;Sorry, but I&#39;m confused. Benton represents the werepanthers of Moon Lake.&quot;<br />
&quot;Not any more,&quot; replied Akane, much to Lance&#39;s shock. &quot;It&#39;s a long story. May I sit?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; he said, indicating one of the guest chairs in front of his desk, while he sat in the other instead of his customary place behind the desk.<br />
When Akane finished telling him about Benton&#39;s misdeeds and dismissal by the Elder&#39;s, Lance just shook his head in disbelief. &quot;My reporters heard rumors of an altercation at your headquarters, but could never confirm the facts, which is why we&#39;ve remained silent on the story. I knew my older brother had a temper that would get him into trouble from time to time, but I never imagined anything like this.&quot;<br />
&quot;The summons in your hand is a formal edict for you to take his council seat until your niece Frieda is of age to assume it herself,&quot; said Akane, indicating the scroll.<br />
&quot;So that would be a little under 7 years, considering she just turned 14 before the start of the current school year,&quot; he realized.<br />
&quot;Your first meeting, just to bring you up to speed on current events, will be tonight at 8. While you will not be the only one participating in it, you will also be expected to help train Frieda to take over when she comes of age.&quot;<br />
&quot;Of course, but can I ask you, why me?&quot; wondered Lance, while holding the scroll as if it were a ten ton weight.<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot; Akane asked in return.<br />
&quot;Well, you don&#39;t understand. Benton is ten years older than me and thrives on pressure, while I&#39;ve always been more of the creative type. Besides, he has always seemed to detest the fact that I even exist, because our parents never officially planned for a second child, so my arrival was unexpected and I think he preferred being an only child. Our family dynamics went beyond the basic sibling rivalry to outright hatred of each other. He always detested how... common I was while I couldn&#39;t stand how much of a snob he was. Sure, the Knight family may be wealthy, but I never thought that a valid reason to mistreat those allegedly under you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yet each of you, in your own way, have prospered,&quot; pointed out Akane.<br />
&quot;I guess. When our father decided to retire from the business world, as much to avoid revealing how old he really was as a werepanther as the fact he was just tired of all the wheeling and dealing and backstabbing, he split his portfolio between us,&quot; remembered Lance. &quot;I got all the media and creative holdings, like the <i>Moon Lake Gazette</i> here and a small publishing company based in Seattle, as well as a couple of more newspapers and a few radio and television stations along the Pacific Coast, while Benton got everything else. Yet while he got the lion&#39;s share of the portfolio, the first thing he tried to do was drive Knight Media out of business when I refused to sell it to him. But not only did we survive, we thrived when Benton tried to set up a rival media conglomerate and failed.&quot;<br />
&quot;And that is just one example as to why you are perfect for the interim position,&quot; explained Akane. &quot;The dynamics between the two of you are as vast as night and day. Like me and Tachibana Enterprises, you see who and what is really important, instead of the proverbial bottom line. Your niece follows your path as well, and someday will be a great leader herself. You should be proud of her.&quot;<br />
&quot;I am, when I get to see her. Benton married a like minded woman when he wed Amanda Van Horton, and the two of them think I&#39;m a bad influence on Frieda. The last time I actually got to see her was the opening ceremony of her welcome into werepanther society back at the beginning of this past summer.&quot;<br />
&quot;She is a fine young girl, who is on her way to becoming a great woman,&quot; said Akane.<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; said Lance with a smile. &quot;I&#39;ve always said when I marry, it would be for love. I&#39;m not saying anything against Benton and Amanda as a married couple, but I&#39;ve yet to find a lady whose genuinely interested in me instead of the prestige or wealth of the Knight family name.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure when the time is right, you will,&quot; said Akane, as she prepared to leave.<br />
