<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty walked along the only path clear enough in the forest to not have branches smacking the head cradled under his left arm.  It was dimly lit, even though Ty was sure it was the middle of the day, and it looked as though it was not naturally occurring given the lack of any weeds or grass covering the well trodden soil.  He had been walking for a while now, at least an hour by his measure, and he was still unsure what to do.  He certainly had no idea how to undo the changes to his body himself, and he wasn’t sure who else could but the fey that had antagonized him.  However, he was not certain he could defeat them, or if they would even be willing to undo their mischief if he won.  All he knew is he wanted his condition fixed, since every hour he didn’t use his new additions, he felt their need rising, and it kind of scared him how tirelessly his new genitals could fuck.<br />
<br />
It was as he was pondering these things that he heard a noise off in the distance, towards a small stream.  Without a neck, he had to turn his whole body around to see, and in the distance he spotted a shape, shaded and un-discernable in the thick shadows of the tree cover, writhing around on the ground.  Ty thought it best to ignore it, given how ‘nice’ the first denizens of the forest had been to him, but then he heard a cry, a woman’s cry, begging for help between gasps of panicked breath.  He tried to steel himself and take a few steps forward, but he soon found himself traversing the brush, pushing thick branches out of the way and trampling over bushes as he hastily made his way to the source of the noise.<br />
<br />
A woman lay on the ground, struggling against something that entangled her body.  She was tall and thin, with light blue skin, broken up by darker blue splotches that seemed to form patterns.  Her face was enchanting, but what caught Ty’s eyes were the pitch black eyes, like a fish, as well as the long, scale like purple hair and the gills that permeated each side of her slender neck.  More concerning than that, was what bound the poor woman.  A tendril, long, thicker than the woman’s forearm, and the same blue color as her skin had wrapped itself around her hands and snaked along her waist where it buried itself underneath a massive blue ballsack that spread the woman’s legs apart slightly.  The tendril thrust in and out without a care for the person it was attached to, causing her to writhe and moan pathetically.<br />
<br />
Ty approached her, but dared not get to close.  He cleared his throat, which seemed to get some of the woman’s attention, and spoke.  “U-uhm, hello ma’am.”  As he said this, he was suddenly reminded of his own deformities and quickly sheathed his dickneck into his cleavage, hoping that it would both hide his neck pussy and cock, and be less arousing than slamming his dickneck into his slit.  It was, but only slightly less so, and he noticed the fabric of his monk gi stretch a bit.  “Do you, uhm, do you need help?!”  He asked more out of formality than anything, he knew he had no idea how to help her.<br />
<br />
 She panted and gasped, trying to form a sentence, until she was able to collect herself enough to speak.  “I-unh!-I need you to remove this thing from-ahh!-my body!”, she sputtered out quickly.  <br />
<br />
Ty looked around, unsure how to do that, “Oh-ok, how do I do that?” <br />
<br />
“J-just p-p-pull-ahh on the base!  Hurry!”, she screamed as the thing once more thrust into her.<br />
<br />
Ty hesitated, not entirely sold on the idea of having to grab what seemed like this things ballsack and tugging it off.  But, he felt bad for the woman and considered how he would have felt if someone had been there to help him and chosen not to.  Overcoming his disgust rather quickly, Ty held his head against his chest with his left hand so it would not fall over while he bent down, and with his right he placed a red hand around the bass of the writhing tentacle and pulled.  It came away surprisingly easily, and made a little sucking noise as it peeled off her body.  As he lifted it up, he saw the end of the thing was buried deep in the woman’s pussy, drilling away madly.  However, as Ty began to try and pull the thing away from her body, it stopped and began to slither out.  When its head finally emerged, Ty wasn’t very shocked to see the dark blue head of a penis.  In a somewhat frightening manner, the head turned and almost seemed to look at him, right before it struck.<br />
<br />
With blinding speed the thing disentangled itself from the blue woman and began to snake up Ty’s right arm.  Ty screamed and tried to shake it off, but the thick tentacle was strong and fast and in moments the head of it was near the opening of his neck slit.  From next to him, Ty heard the a chuckle, then a rolling wave of cackling laughter.  While he was distracted, blue hands gripped the sides of his head and pulled him out from his comfortable cleavage and into her oddly cold chest.   A breath tickled his ear as the woman spoke, “Oh little tiefling, looks like the faeries already got to you, but who says I can’t also have some fun with one of our new guests?”<br />
<br />
As she said this, she made sure Ty’s head was pointed to his flailing headless body, which currently was trying to pull the tentacle dick thing off his body with little success.  Soon enough it had wrapped itself around his hands, much like it had the woman before, and then it began to change.  It’s color shifted, first to dark purple, then to deep red before it finally brightened up a bit to match the exact crimson red as Ty’s tiefling skin.  All the while, it seemed to grow thicker, fatter, and its testicles bulged until they were the size of cantaloupes to match up with its new hosts larger proportions.<br />
<br />
Ty tried to shake his head back and forth, shouting at the woman to stop, but she only giggled as the monster prick wriggled into position above his purple pussy between his shoulders, then began to slither its way down his cunt with glee.  Ty gasped as he felt the cock slide into him, and continue to pour itself into his greedy hole, inch by inch, far longer than any pussy should have been able to manage, and that’s when he felt something tickle near the inside of abdomen.  He saw it, a bugle traveling down his body, clear even through the fabric of his clothing.  It went further and further down until he could feel it approaching his original cunt and the strangest feeling of being penetrated, but in reverse was happening to him.  A few seconds later and a bulge began to fill in the crotch of his pants until they ere pushed away and the red head of the cock pushed out of his lower pussy!<br />
<br />
Ty’s body doubled over, unable to stand up with the dual sensations of both cunts being filled, and even worse, by a new sensation.  he could feel it.  He could feel the cock, like it was his own, skewering his pussies.  He could feel it as his vaginal canal, which he now realized ran the whole length of his body, from red vagina to purple cunt.  He tried again, feebly to resist the woman and make his body attack her, or at least rip the damned thing out, but he could already feel his body shacking with the threat of orgasm.  <br />
<br />
When about a foot and a half of the cock was snaking out of his lower slit, he felt a much greater push on his upper cunt, and realized to his horror that the massive ballsack was getting pulled into his neck slit, stretching it to its limits.  Ty let out a yelp as his cunt greedily sucked it down and began to cum mercilessly, and watched as the massive bulge followed the snaking prick exited his lower pussy, cum spewing as the thing finally pulled its full body out.  His body slumped to the ground, twitching, as something even worse happened.  The blank end of the cock, its base, traveled back to his groin, and he felt a sickening pull as the tentacle like cock fused with him, above his pussy, like it had always been there.  That seemed to settle down, and it no longer writhed about with a mind of its own.<br />
<br />
“Hahaha, nice cock hero!  Let’s see how you fare with a hungry prick your more likely to trip over than suck!”, she said as she tossed his head onto the heap that was his body and bounded away in the current and quickly away from the newly cocked tiefling…</p>
