<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Expecting some pain, Jen braced herself for the change. Jen instead felt a pleasant heat radiating from…her face? No, her mouth!<br />
<br />
She brought an elephant cock around to look at her face. Jen watched dumbfounded. Shrinking in front of her very eyes, her lips drew together and nearly sealed over before suddenly stretching vertically. It settled into a familiar shape – the teardrop shape of a horse vagina, complete with clit on the bottom. <br />
<br />
Her mouth turned into a horse cunt! And, as if by some cruel joke, the white stripe that ran down her equine face changed to resemble a cock and balls like the ones she’d seen scribbled on bathroom walls. It pointed toward the vertical slit as if to say, “Insert penis here.”<br />
<br />
Teeth receding into softening flesh, her pussymouth grew tight around her tongue as it completed its change. She recoiled as the flavor of her new face cunt hit her. Sticking her horse tongue out, it parted the labia obscenely. “Great, not only do I taste cock all the time, I’m also literally eating myself out 24/7,” she thought. <br />
<br />
It didn’t end there, however. She felt suddenly restless, flustered over…over SOMETHING. It was only when the vulva on her face grew puffy and warm liquid dripped down her chin that she realized why. She absorbed not just the mare. She also absorbed the mare’s heat! Worse, all its sexual energy was concentrated in her mouth, and Jen had been inhaling the feminine estrus through her nose. <br />
<br />
Jen groaned. She remembered how her body reacted to its own pheromones. The stallion parts of her mind stirred, sensing a fertile female nearby in need of fucking. Her cocks rose to full erection, throbbing and growing slick with precum. The taste and smell of it caught on her snake tongues and momentarily overwhelmed her senses. The mare parts of her mind reacted in kind, sensing virile males to be fucked by. Her rear horse pussy grew wet with anticipation and her cuntmouth drooled profusely. It was a never-ending cycle. <br />
<br />
The morning air around her became tainted with the smell of horse cum. The precum from just one of her cocks was at least as potent as an average horse’s semen, and she had five of them. She would reek of horse cum and always taste it no matter where she was. <br />
<br />
Jen sighed. This was probably her new normal. She had just begun to enjoy the feeling of being clean too. Perhaps a shower of horse cum would do her good. <br />
<br />
What the-? Jen shook her head, catching herself and holding back the intrusive thought. Her new mouth was playing with her mind, her brain swimming in a flood of sex hormones. The mare that composed her mouth hungered for horsecock, and now so did Jen. Images of horsecock and the intense need to swallow horsecock flittered through her mind. The constant barrage twisted her thoughts and obscured her ability to think clearly. For however long this horse’s heat was going to last, she was going to need to keep herself in check.<br />
<br />
Making a series of sounds, Jen was relieved to find she could still talk. Her voice was as human and girly as always. That is, whenever she wasn’t making horse or cow noises. The movement of unfamiliar muscles and the vibrations of her voice on her mouth felt strange, pleasurable even. <br />
<br />
“Jen, honey, did you say something?” asked her mom, catching Jen off-guard. <br />
<br />
Fumbling for an excuse, she said the first thing that came to mind. “Umm, I just need suck a good horse penis.” <br />
<br />
Her eyes widened. That wasn’t AT ALL what she meant to say! “I-I mean, I was just clearing my throat!” A horse penis did sound good, however. <br />
<br />
“Oh sweetey, it must be that time of month again. There’s no need to hide it.” Jen’s mother cooed. <br />
<br />
“I’ve got just the thing!” her father interjected. “I think it’s time for you to blow out the candles!” <br />
<br />
“Umm, I thought I did that already?” She looked to where the birthday cake was, but there was no trace of it. Reality must have shifted again. “Where’s the cake?”<br />
<br />
“What are you talking about, silly? Your cake is waiting for you inside,” he said with an implying tone.<br />
<br />
They stepped back inside the barn. Jen observed how this too had changed. <br />
<br />
For one, it was larger, and her hooves reverberated off the floor which was now a polished concrete. Many of the same things were still there, just rearranged, making way for a new walled off addition that caught her attention. At the moment it was closed.<br />
<br />
They headed toward the door. “I had to pull a few favors to bring only the best today,” her father said, pushing it open. “Happy Birthday, Jenny.”<br />
<br />
Inside, holes lined the wall at mouth level. Through them were the half-hard cocks and balls of horses. <br />
<br />
“They took some extra restraining, but aren’t these just the best darndest candles you’ve ever seen? They’re the biggest, finest stallions in a hundred miles. When they really get going, they’re just over two feet long – perfect for your mouth! How can that be you ask? Well, they’re your offspring! Only our fine daughter could father such fine beasts, and it’s only fair that they show their dad some love, right?” Her dad continued to talk, placing his beloved daughter on a pedestal and getting caught up in his own monologue. <br />
<br />
Jen however had stopped listening the second the door opened. She was enraptured by what she saw. <br />
Her rational mind never stood a chance; it crumbled before the sight of Providence itself. It was as though the pearly gates themselves lay open before her. She took a step forward, trembling as though trespasser to sacred ground. <br />
<br />
She approached the closest horse penis. Black and mottled with pink, the horse’s member flared into a beautiful broad shape. It was the most glorious thing she’d ever seen. Yes, she had three of her own just like it. They were the best, but this was also the best, like all horsecocks were. <br />
<br />
Jen traced a finger along the half-flaccid length. This wouldn’t do. She’d have to nurture it. She held it with a hand, placing several kisses along the horsecock with her mouth cunt until she reached the dark skin of the horse’s testicles, which she promptly covered with her saliva. The rough, warm textures were like forbidden fruit, the intoxicating scents like heavenly ambrosia. She couldn’t stop herself from paying the ballsack a few more tributes with her tongue before letting go. <br />
 <br />
The heavy shaft slapped her in the face, splattering it with precum. She wiped it off, not to clean her face but to bring it up to her lips. She licked the precum off her hand, savoring every drop of the nectar. At the same time, she teased the cock with four hands, coaxing it with ritual tenderness. Her remaining free hand cupped the horse’s balls. The cantaloupe-sized orbs filled her palms as she alternated between them. <br />
<br />
Next, she closed her eyes, and nuzzled the cock with her face. She let it slide up her muzzle and rejoiced in the hardening flesh against her face. <br />
<br />
Finally, Jen bowed her head in prayer. The horsecock lay along the bridge of her face and the tip rested upon her forehead. With each intensifying throb, she could feel its warmth radiate into her very being. Warm precum covered her face in copious amounts. Satisfied with her purification, Jen lowered herself slightly, breaking contact. <br />
<br />
Then Jen opened her eyes, and she was filled with awe. <br />
<br />
She could not begin to express what she saw, for what she saw was God Himself. <br />
<br />
He towered before her, mere inches above her face. The pillar of cock’s presence subsumed her own. In Him she saw the universe, the meaning of life itself. She was so small, so insignificant. How could she begin to compare to His magnificence? She was not worthy. And yet He had shown Himself to her, basking her in His divine erectness. He offered His wisdom to her now. She only need drink of Him. <br />
<br />
Hand shaking, she grasped the base of the horsecock, and guided its tip into her mouth. The cock bulged under her skin as her wet feminine lips parted around its broad head. <br />
<br />
A part of her wanted to simply impale herself on her Lord, He was so irresistible, so marvelous. But that would be blasphemy. She could not cum before He did. Her Lord demanded respect. He commanded it. And so, God willing, she gave it, moving her head forward slowly, carefully as to not to make herself cum.<br />
<br />
The medial ring passed her lips. The sensitivities of mouth and pussy combined such that she could intimately feel every groove and texture of every inch of the cock. She wanted this to continue forever.  But before long she reached the end, her labia meeting sheath and ballsack, horsecock hitting the back of her throat. A perfect fit. <br />
<br />
She had taken Him fully into herself. Now she was free to please her God as she wished. <br />
<br />
Jen began to move her head back and forth down upon its length. Faster and faster, she swallowed the horsecock repeatedly. But this wasn’t enough. She needed more speed, more power. <br />
<br />
Jen placed her hands against the wall. She found handles built into it that she hadn’t noticed before. There were six of them, one for each of her hands. <br />
<br />
She grabbed onto them, never slowing her sucking and licking as she did so. Then, gripping all six handles tightly, she pushed and pulled with her arms in zealous fervor, pounding her horse face on the horsecock over and over with tremendous force. Her face was nothing more than a sleeve, her mouth no more than a receptacle for the almighty horse penis to bless with his holy horse semen. <br />
<br />
Deliverance was close. <br />
<br />
She shoved her face forward one final time, face buried to the hilt. Her feminine lips met the dark skin of the horse’s balls, and she felt them suddenly shift. The cock reverberated through the entire length of her pussymouth, pulsing and throbbing, before pure white seed came pouring down her throat. <br />
<br />
Jen met the horse’s orgasm with her own as her face cunt contracted, twitching and spasming wildly around the horsecock that filled it completely. And through it all, Jen gripped the handles with herculean strength, keeping her face pressed up against the horse’s churning balls even as the pressure threatened to separate them. <br />
<br />
Again and again the horse came into her mouth, pumping her stomach full of horse cum. Jen didn’t even have to struggle swallowing. The equine cunt that was her mouth was made for this. No, Jen was made for this. She was made to suck horsecock, and to drink of horse semen. Nothing had ever tasted this good. Nothing on this plane of existence was or would ever be as good. Only more horse semen would suffice. <br />
<br />
Eventually, the orgasms subsided. The horsecock grew soft, and Jen pulled back to let it slide out of her mouth. <br />
<br />
Yet she immediately cupped her hands together, collecting what little emerging semen remained to pool into her hands. However, even this amount seemed a great deal by the time the flow stopped. Head pointed upward, she raised her hands up, and poured the leftover horse semen into her willing, gaping mouthcunt. <br />
<br />
The first holy fountain finished, Jen turned to look at the others. She looked as though possessed, already hungry for more cum. <br />
<br />
There were so many more to go, awaiting homage from their anointed priestess. <br />
<br />
Jennifer Smith was nothing less than willing to oblige.</p>
