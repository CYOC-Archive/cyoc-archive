<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sensations swirled hazily around Jen as her phone alarm emitted a soft jingle to wake her up. <i>Oh, I must have left my vibrator out...I&#39;ll have to put it away. But first, some fun...</i> thought Jen as she squeezed her inner walls. <i>Strange, it almost feels soft....but growing....fuck!</i> Jen sat bolt upright as memories of what had happened yesterday flooded back to her, which must have been felt by whoever was inside her as she felt the penis grow more erect inside her honeypot. Jen concluded that the combination of her squeezing and her body shifting upright must have woken up her pussy&#39;s (<i>temporary!</i>) owner as it began moving in and out her, giving Jen&#39;s her first lay of the day from wherever-it-was. <i>Enjoy it for now, creep. I&#39;m going to find you...</i> Jennifer fumed powerlessly as her quickly-lubricating hole was pounded again & again.<br />
<br />
As she reached for her phone with her right hand while tightly gripping her bedsheet with her left, she heard a knock at the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen, your father told me you weren&#39;t feeling well yesterday. Are you going to school today?&quot;<br />
<br />
As Jen turned off her phone alarm, having to use both hands to keep it steady in her grip while curling into a ball, she called out in the direction of the door &quot;Yeah....ah, I&#39;m not feeling that, umm, well today either so I&#39;m going to stay ho-(oh!)-me today!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there&#39;s some bacon for you and eggs for you downstairs if you&#39;re hungry. Remember that Martha&#39;s gone now so you&#39;ll have to make your own food for now.&quot; Her mom replied. <i>How could I forget?</i> thought Jen as she wondered how her parents would react if she explained Martha&#39;s unintended severance package. She knew the curse&#39;s magic would keep them from freaking out too much, but she would still rather keep her current state as a remote sex toy a secret if possible. As the dick in her slowed it&#39;s pace to a long thrust every few seconds, Jennifer replied &quot;I think I&#39;m...just going to lie down for a while more mom...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, well I&#39;m off to work. This evening, your father and I have dinner plans at that new restaurant that opened last week, so you&#39;ll have to make or order your own dinner tonight. You know, they have that couscous that you liked so much from that other place-&quot; her mother began to drone on about the new restaurant&#39;s reviews as, about 6 meters away and also possibly several miles, her daughter received a slow fucking on the other side of the bedroom wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s great mom! You and dad have fun tonight, I think I need to rest a little longer!&quot; Jen cut her off, wanting to end the conversation quickly as her brow started to sweat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I&#39;ll see you tonight hun.&quot; Her mother&#39;s footsteps receding downstairs as she grabbed her purse and keys and started making her way out the door. As she left, Jen got out of bed and moved towards the mirror in her room.<br />
<br />
<i>If I can&#39;t find it today, I&#39;m going to have to get better at concealing this for now. At least nothing shows on the outside.</i> Jen mused as, naked, she spread her legs in front of the mirror. Other than a subtle pushing of the musculature underneath the flat skin of her crotch towards the sides of her thighs and back towards her ass when she was penetrated, making a slight &quot;O&quot; shape between her legs, there was nothing to suggest her reflection was having sex at this very moment. <i>That would be invisible even under a swimsuit, much less normal clothing. I just have to stay composed. God, I wish he would hurry!</i> Jen mused as, alone in the house, she made her way with a few stumbles to her bathroom to get ready for the day. <i>This is so fucking weird....</i> Jen thought as she did her business on the toilet while a dick pushed into her the whole time. After getting up and washing her hands, she began to brush her teeth. &quot;MMMmm!&quot; Jen stopped holding back her moans as whoever was using her was finished with his leisurely pace and began slamming his dick into Jen&#39;s former vagina, but now more accurately his cocksocket, while Jen squirmed while leaning over her sink. Jen looked at her reflection with tearfully pleading eyes and her lips wrapped around the toothbrush in her hand as she gripped the sink tightly with her other hand and began to thrust back to meet the phantom dick plundering her depths. Of course, this had no effect since her gentials weren&#39;t between her legs, and Jennifer had no control over the timing or intensity of the fuck she was receiving.<br />
<br />
Jen felt her cocksleeve get juicier and juicier, as she started to rapidly approach orgasm herself. &quot;Oh! Oh! MMmmm! Fmmish aweady!&quot; She moaned, her mouth still wrapped around her toothbrush in a bizarre sort of spitroast as her conflicted thoughts verged between just wanting it to be done with and wanting to cum herself. Reaching between her legs, Jen suddenly realized that since her clit and nipples were detached along with her canal itself, the only way she would cum is from this stranger she didn&#39;t know anything about using her hole as his fleshlight. With that thought, Jen felt herself get pushed over the edge as she had what was probably the largest, longest orgasm the 18-year old cheer team captain had had in her life so far. &quot;MMOooohhhh-!&quot; Jen moaned in both fear and passion, as her pussy felt the second ejaculation in it&#39;s new job as someone&#39;s cocksleeve. <i>I&#39;d be lying if that time wasn&#39;t good...but don&#39;t you dare think I wanted that!</i> Jennifer thought, maintain her defiance towards her&#39;s pussy&#39;s circumstances.<br />
<br />
Slumping onto the sink, she rode out the orgasm for nearly a minute before relaxing in the afterglow. Covered in sweat from the rough fuck she had just provided remotely, she stepped into the shower after a while just as she felt the penis withdraw from her and cold water wash her insides, in a shocking contrast to the warm shower she was taking. <i>Fuck, couldn&#39;t you use some warm water when you wash me?!</i> Jen continued to fume. At least she would be fully washed, besides her nipples which had been left standing untouched in cold air the entire time.<br />
<br />
After showering....</p>
