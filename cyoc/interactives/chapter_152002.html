<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was no telling how long the dog bowl had been lucky enough to be a dog bowl. But one day something different happened. His restraints were loosened. It almost hurt to move his body after so long. The gag was removed from his mouth for the first time in eternity, and Andy almost panicked, feeling like his mouth had been removed. The gag was part of him. He needed it to be a good dog bowl.<br />
<br />
His owner&#39;s name was taken off his eyes, letting him see for the first time in eons. The light hurt his eyes as shadows of blurry people moved around him. The headphones were removed and the dog bowl felt like someone had removed his mind for a moment, as the ever present and comforting hypnosis vanished from him. The enclosure around his neck was opened and his head was pulled back through.<br />
<br />
Someone put a blanket around him. It was soft and warm. Why waste something like this on a dog bowl? People were saying words, but the dog bowl didn&#39;t register any of it. It was all just noise to it. They took him away and slowly, little by little, Andy began to recover. He learned later what had happened.<br />
<br />
No one had reported him missing. It had been over three months before finally his landlord had gotten sick of him not paying for his rent. After discovering the empty apartment with a fridge full of long over-due food, the police had been alerted and an investigation had been launched. Andy had been very lucky. They&#39;d dug up the transcripts of Andy&#39;s last chat session with an anonymous client describing a sitting job for a bunny. Some techno magic later and the discovered that the client had used the same computer as the a client with a bulldog from weeks prior. The investigation had nearly hit a dead end when they just came to the kidnapper&#39;s brother&#39;s house. But with some more diligent work, they&#39;d found the house way outside the city. With a request for a search warrant and all the investigation, it had taken an extra two weeks to finally find Andy and free him.<br />
<br />
Andy didn&#39;t really know or care what had happened to his kidnapper. He knew she&#39;d been arrested, but he just didn&#39;t want any more to do with her. However, his thoughts did often return to Fido. Part of him actually missed the dog and thought of it as his owner. Eating normal food again was good, but also felt somehow wrong. It filled him with guilt for some reason to enjoy human food. His body was checked and found to be healthy apart from some minor bruises and atrophy. It had taken over a week to be able to walk normally again, but Andy was back to himself again. Physically that is.<br />
<br />
The officers hadn&#39;t had the key to Andy&#39;s chastity when they&#39;d freed him and decided not to do anything about it right away, since it was a low priority health wise. They&#39;d found the key about a day later and handed it to Andy to unlock himself. Andy had taken it, but now two weeks after his rescue, he still hadn&#39;t unlocked his dick. It was all he had left. He knew deep down that he was not meant to pleasure himself. He was only supposed to pleasure Fido&#39;s dick. Poor Fido hadn&#39;t fucked him in weeks. He shook himself. No, he had to stop thinking like that. He wasn&#39;t a fuck toy or dog bowl any more. But he couldn&#39;t stop it. It came unbidden. He&#39;d dream of being a dog bowl and fuck toy all night long, only he was abandoned. Discarded. Unused. And his poor owner didn&#39;t know where his fuck toy was. Andy would wake up in a cold sweat and be wracked with guilt for being a bad object. He didn&#39;t get punished as he rightly should anymore, so he would take to harming himself. It helped a little.<br />
<br />
At the store the other day, he&#39;d walked past the pet food section and had suddenly frozen in place. His eyes had locked onto the brand he&#39;d been living on for three and a half months. The brand he&#39;d been so happy to serve to his owner every day. Instinct compelled him. He knew he shouldn&#39;t. That he was past this. He was free now. He&#39;d managed to restrain himself enough to only buy one. He held the can to his chest the entire walk home, as if it was a long lost friend. As soon as he got inside, he&#39;d stripped naked, opened the can and stared at the contents, smelling those memories. Did he stare in horror? In sorrow? In longing? He didn&#39;t know. Reluctantly and eagerly at the same time he lay himself down on his back with a pillow under his butt, propping it up and pouring the contents into his mouth. He lay there like that, eyes closed and crying, waiting for his owner to come. But he was abandoned. Finally he ate some of it himself, but then felt guilty for eating his owner&#39;s food. He punished himself hard that night.<br />
<br />
Since he&#39;d been gone so long, Andy had lost his apartment. Some of his things had been stored away for him, but he didn&#39;t really have anywhere to live. The authorities had given him a temporary place to live while he recovered, but he was expected to leave today weather he had found a new place or not.<br />
<br />
Andy couldn&#39;t take it anymore. He needed to find his owner. After some investigation, he found out that Fido had been sent to a local animal shelter. Finding a place to live could wait. He left his stuff in a public locker at the train station and took the buss to the animal shelter. It was the same buss he&#39;d taken when he&#39;d first gone to see Fido over four month ago. His heart ached to see Fido.</p>
