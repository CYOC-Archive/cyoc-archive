Tonight&#39;s story on the CYOC is somewhat unique and calls for a different kind of introduction.  On a given morning not too long ago, the rest of the world disappeared and Laksville was left all alone. Its inhabitants were never sure whether the world was destroyed and only Laksville left untouched or whether the village had somehow been taken away. They were, on the other hand, sure of one thing: the cause. A monster had arrived in the village. Just by using his mind, he took away the automobiles, the electricity, the machines - because they displeased him - and he moved an entire community back into the dark ages - just by using his mind. <br />
<br />
This is the monster. His name is Charlie Wiliams. He&#39;s six years old, with a cute little-boy face and blue, guileless eyes. But when those eyes look at you, you&#39;d better start thinking happy thoughts, because the mind behind them is absolutely in charge. This is the CYOC.<br />
<br />
David was a young husband and father and a tough man, He kept mostly to himself in this strange new place that their town had become. He had forbidden his 2 children from playing with Charlie Wiliams out of concern for their safety. One day, when he came  home from the fields into his house he learned from his wife that his 2 children were playing with Charlie, He immediately went to find them.<br />
<br />
He came to get them from in the Wiliams’s front yard where the group of children were playing. He ordered his kids to immediately come with him.<br />
<br />
Charlie didn’t like the way David yelled at his kids and he didn’t like the the thoughts that David was thinking about him.<br />
<br />
Charlie glared at David; “Why are you taking away kids from playing with me. I don’t like it when people won’t play with me.” <br />
<br />
David knew that the little boy was dangerous but he was a brave man. He firmly answered that it was time for them to come home.<br />
<br />
“Why do they have to listen to you?” Charlie answered. <br />
<br />
David answered plainly because he was their father a took his kids by the hand a turned to leave.<br />
<br />
“Your a bad man!” Charlie shouted pointing at David.<br />
<br />
Other people had come out of their houses to see what was happening and were quite scared. No one liked to see Charlie get angry.<br />
<br />
David did not look back and started walking away. He was a grown man, after all, and he had to preserve his authority in front of his children.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the children burst into giggles. The adults who had gathered around gasped. Charlie felt a draft as horrible realization came upon him He looked down at himself hoping he was mistaken but he wasn’t . He was standing there in the middle of the street stark naked. His rather large genitals were just dangling out for all to see, Now he gasped as he dropped his kids hands and bent over to cover himself as best he could. One hand over his genitals and the other the bottom of the crack of his ass. he turned and face Charlie, <br />
<br />
“What are you doing?! Where are my clothes?” He asked in as calm a voice as he could muster.<br />
<br />
“Your a bad man and you were thinking bad things about me and now I’m going to punish you.” answered Charlie.<br />
<br />
“Its wrong for a man to be naked in public”, David tried to explain but then he felt him self loosing balance, He had to move his hands to his sides again displaying himself and he fell forward onto all fours. <br />
<br />
There he was a fit good looking grown man totally nude on all fours looking up at Antony and the crowd around him. The people behind him had a great a view of his beefy ass and slightly furry crack. His big balls were also visible as they swayed as he struggled to stand up. <br />
<br />
“I’m going to make you a dog man, because you were bossing your kids around. Now you will be their pet instead. <br />
<br />
David tried to say something in his defence but all that came out was a dog’s bark. He quickly shut his mouth when he realized that he couldn’t talk. <br />
<br />
Then his ears became pointed, floppy and furry. The children were still laughing at the funny sight. Charlie reached up and touched his ears and was horrified but what he felt. He tugged at them confirming that they were real.<br />
<br />
He then reached around he felt something pushing out of his lower back just above his ass. <br />
“Oh no!,” he thought , “Im growing a tail!”<br />
<br />
He waved the tail around to confirm that it was indeed his.<br />
<br />
David blushed at his humiliating predicament, He looked up at Charlie then around at the either laughing children or aghast adults.<br />
<br />
“Now beg!” Charlie ordered. <br />
<br />
The naked man wasn’t sure what he was suppose to to and he didn’t want to further humiliate himself so he just stood there on all fours, He pictured how he must look from the people behind him as he felt his genitals swinging. He had never felt so totally helpless and exposed.<br />
<br />
“You heard me. Up you go and beg. better do it now or I’ll make you more a dog”<br />
<br />
David put stood up on his haunches with his hands up in  begging position acutely aware that his bushy pubes and dangling penis were now being shown to just about everyone.<br />
<br />
Then Charlie made him role around and lie on his back. Then trot around on all fours while everyone slapped his naked ass.<br />
<br />
“Now what else should i do to you?” Charlie asked himself out-loud.</p>
