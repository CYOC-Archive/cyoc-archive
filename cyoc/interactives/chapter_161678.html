<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jessica dragged her ’Kitty’ down the stairs to the basement and kitty was ever so surprised. Originally the basement Was Living-room space with Max’s office In a room of to the side. No it looked like some kind of sex dungeon, Max came to the conclusion that ‘He’ had been holding Jessica back in the kink department. Among all the dungeon furniture was a bondage horse Labeled with what looked like a hand made sign. It had big flourished text and read ‘The Cage’ when she saw this her eyes widened in shock and she tried to pull away from Jessica who jerked her back easily overpowering Max’s new daintier body. Apparently she was still working out in this reality.  <br />
<br />
“Now thats not what good kitties should be doing, but I will let it slide, this time.” She pulled Max closer to by the collar. “Don’t worry the Cage is only for bad kittens that misbehave.” She whisper breathily into her ear making her whole body shutter. <br />
<br />
Among all the sex furniture was a nice and big plush couch, and across from It was a television set paused on an episode of true crime. Jessica release her hold on the collar and took a seat and the proceeded to pat her lap and click at Max. Who more quickly than he could think about it responded by hopping onto the couch on all fours.  She froze, she had done that subconsciously. She had to admit she was enjoying this more than she would like to admit. Subconsciously she understood what was expected of her. Was this part of the changes she subjected herself to?  Her thought process was interrupted by jessica.<br />
<br />
“Well are you going to get comfortable and lay down or are you just going to sit there?” She said in mock irritation patting her lap again. ‘What did she mean more comfortable?’ Max thought, but she had a gut feeling or maybe she had a subconscious impulse and she decided to act on it and started kneading Jessica’s leg and after a minute of that she curled up and placed her head on her lap. She took the remote and pressed play and began stroking Max’s head. <br />
<br />
Max had always enjoyed petting even as a guy but this was different. Normal petting felt good but this was extraordinary the whole situation made it so much better and he was starting to get sleepy when again Jessica interrupted his state of mind.<br />
<br />
“You dont seem to be enjoying your self.” She said in a serious tone. What had she meant Max was enjoying herself greatly. “Good kitties pur when they are happy.” She said now stroking between her shoulder blades. “I don’t hear purring.” Her tone sounded more irritated. ‘Shit how do I pur?’ Max had made the gag pur when she was grunting before so she tried that and had limited effectiveness but that clearly wasn’t what her mistress wanted, and she needed to please her. Max recognized  the strange thoughts and it occurred to her that this whole experience was pulling the submissive tendencies out of her subconscious and making them conscious. This only made her feel hotter and more flush the feeling was starting to drive her crazy she wasn’t used to the sensation of female arousal and it was starting to wear on her thinking. <br />
<br />
“Does kitty need help?” Jessica asked as her hands deftly began tracing Max’s chest and midriff. This felt so great and her body was so hot already that she let out what should have been a moan but instead came out as purring. The Max realized purs were what the mask made out of moans. It was humiliating, she had to continuously moan to please her mistress, but that only refreshed the hot feeling she had. “See thats a good kitty.” Jessica whispered as her hand began to trace lower and got closer to Max’s crotch. As she got closer max began to twitch. Her over stimulated body was already wearing on her will power and then it happen. It was like electricity when the finger touch what he new to be his vagina. She hadn’t had much time to look her self over but she knew the harness offered no barrier to her mistress’ hands. And she purred louder and she bucked against her will every time she was teased. <br />
<br />
“Hold still kitty or I will have to put you in the cage.” She giggled. Max realized the cage wasn’t a punishment it was an inevitability she was going in the cage because mistress wanted her there. Knowing that she stopped struggling. Against the will of her body and let her self buck as her mistress played with her. Her mistress increased the intensity as she played with Max’s clitoris getting quicker and quicker until Max thought she was going to burst but then mistress stopped max looked up in confusion and frustration at having been left on the edge of an orgasm. At this point her brain was jelly and she knew nothing other than the heat that was washing over her and the desire to have something filling her.<br />
<br />
“I guess I should put you in the cage for the night kitty.” She gave max an evil grin as she pushed her up and began to make her get up off the couch.</p>
