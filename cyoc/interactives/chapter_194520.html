<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Claire began to meander around the mall, with no clear goal other than to waste time while she and Jen look for opportunities to transform people. Their form drew plenty of stares from the other shoppers as there didn&#39;t seem to be very many other mutants around.<br />
<br />
	“Hey, can we head into the store over on the left?”<br />
<br />
	When Claire looked at the shop Jen mentioned she saw several fancy outfits in the window, as well as a sign over the door that read “Eliana&#39;s designer clothes for women.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Why do you want to go in there? There&#39;s no way they have anything that&#39;ll fit us.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Yeah, I know that! But we&#39;re not really doing much right now and looking at some cute clothes, even if I can&#39;t wear any of them, seems like a nice distraction. We might even find some people to transform inside.&quot;<br />
<br />
	Unable to disagree with her logic, Claire simply mentally shrugged and entered the store. Inside was about what one would expect from a mall boutique, mannequins displaying various pieces of clothing alongside tables with piles of folded clothes, and in the back was a half-dozen changing rooms that allowed customers to try on the clothes they planned to buy. The spaces between displays was a bit tight for the trio&#39;s feral form, but as long as Claire kept her wings folded back they were able to comfortably browse the store. As they looked around Jen commented on the various display outfits while Claire, who never really cared that much about fashion, was content to listen. Eventually they had made their way to the back of the store and were walking past the changing rooms. As they passed by, one of the changing room doors suddenly swung open right in front of the trio. Out from the door stepped a middle-aged woman, she had hair that was beginning to grey and visible wrinkles on her face, which immediately adopted a look of fury when she saw the trio.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Ugh, why is a stinking mutant like you here? This store is for respectable folk, so why would a freak like you, who doesn&#39;t even seem to wear clothes, even be inside? What kind of business would even let someone like you insi- mmmph.&quot; <br />
<br />
	The woman&#39;s sudden tirade was cut off when Claire pounced on the woman, pressing one of Jen&#39;s lipples against her mouth. Jen happily spat a pill down the woman&#39;s throat, before Claire pulled away so they could watch her transformation with glee.<br />
<br />
	The woman, still laying on her back from Claire and Jen&#39;s sudden assault, began her transformation with her head regaining it&#39;s vitality. Her hair went from a tangled mess of grey and brown to a styled silver pony-tail and her wrinkles shifted from the ugly side effects of a life filled with hatred and stress to graceful laugh-lines, giving her face a kinder overall visage. Her legs then began moving towards the trio as her hips stretched into a second torso, her pants and underwear vanishing into nothing. This new lower body then bulked up as it was covered in a coat of silver fur. Her legs shifted into a digitigrade stance while her thighs grew thick and muscular. A second pair of animalistic legs grew from the front of her tauric body, these ones thinner than the back pair. The fur spread over both sets of legs, stopping just above her lower shoulders, and a small rabbit tail grew from her spine. With her legs now fully transformed into the body of a rabbit, the woman&#39;s upper body resumed it&#39;s transformation. Her breasts perked up and grew to the size of basketballs, pulling her shirt up around them and revealing the toned abs that now adored her upper stomach. Finally, her ears moved up her head as they lengthened into a two-foot long pair of rabbit ears.<br />
<br />
	With her transformation complete, the woman&#39;s face immediately shifted from one of shock and anger to a gaze of desire. The rabbit-taur flipped from laying on her back to presenting her furry behind to the trio. <br />
<br />
	“I&#39;m usually not so easy, but for whatever reason that kiss really got me going, sweetie. Now how about you be a responsible young miss and take care of the problem you caused.”<br />
<br />
	Despite having just fucked M3-0W just a few minutes ago, Claire eagerly mounted the horny rabbit-taur, placing the tip of her and her body-mates horsecock against her waiting slit.<br />
<br />
	“Just so you know, Claire isn&#39;t the only one in here. I&#39;m Jen, and the one in the back is Lucy.” Jen whispered these words in the woman&#39;s ears as Claire thrust their cock into her fluffy backside.<br />
<br />
	“Oh! So I&#39;m being ravished by three hot young ladies? This reminds me when I was your age, they started calling me &#39;Bouncing Betty&#39; After I &#39;rewarded&#39; my school&#39;s entire football team AND the entire cheer squad after they won regionals.”<br />
<br />
	Claire started pistoning their cock in and out of Betty, wrapping her fore-paws around the older woman&#39;s toned upper stomach to give her more leverage. <br />
<br />
	“WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?” <br />
<br />
	The employee working at the moment, whose name tag identified her as “Florence” had heard the sound of sex coming from the back and came to investigate. A look of horror was on her face as she stared at what was happening in front of her.<br />
<br />
	“I don&#39;t care how horny you are! If you want to have sex, go to one of the bathrooms or something!” Florence began telling the foursome off as she approached.<br />
<br />
	Betty looked back at Claire and Jen with a mischievous look in her eyes before grabbing the employee as soon as she was in range, pressing the woman&#39;s face into her bosom. Claire brought her face up beside Betty&#39;s and asked the rabbit-taur to let her give Florence a kiss, promising that it&#39;ll get her in the right mood. Betty happily removed the woman from her bust and pressed her lips into Claire&#39;s, who promptly sent a pill into her mouth. Florence&#39;s protests promptly stopped as her body began to change.<br />
<br />
	Florence&#39;s pants faded away as her legs transformed into a pair of wooden poles carved with decorative floral patterns. Her hips receded as a two foot wide rectangular wooden surface grew out behind her. Once this surface had reached six feet long, a second set of wooden legs grew from the back end, identical to the ones in front. The top side of the surface gained a polished sheen while more floral patterns appeared around it&#39;s edges and on it&#39;s sides. Florence&#39;s waist now seamlessly blended into the front end of a wooden table.<br />
<br />
	As soon as Florence&#39;s transformation finished, she began eagerly returning Claire&#39;s kiss, her hands moving down to allow Jen&#39;s lipples to suck on her fingers. Eventually Florence pulled back, taking in a deep breath before speaking:<br />
<br />
	“Thanks girls, you can&#39;t imagine how hard it is to get off by myself without any genitals.”<br />
<br />
	“Anytime honey, all of us understand how horny mutants can get at times” Replied Betty before she pulled Florence into another kiss. <br />
	<br />
	“Florence! What are you doing?” <br />
<br />
	A sharp voice got the attention of everyone. It came from a woman, dressed in a simple pantsuit who had come to the back of the store at some point.<br />
<br />
	“Miss Eliana!” Florence broke her kiss with Betty and turned around on her table legs to face the woman who presumably, based on the name above the door, owned the boutique.<br />
<br />
	Eliana approached her employee slowly, the others watching in silence. When the woman reached her target she stared at her, letting the moment sink in, before aggressively groping the other woman&#39;s clothed breasts.<br />
<br />
	“You know I told you to let me take care of you when you get horny”<br />
<br />
	“S-sorry Mistress! It just came on all of a sudden and these four were already fucking back here. I figured you were busy in the office with today&#39;s paperwork...”<br />
<br />
	As the table-taur mewled out an excuse to her boss, Eliana walked past her to look at those behind her, Claire still balls deep in Betty. <br />
<br />
	“At least the partners you chose are a bunch of lookers...” <br />
<br />
	As Eliana analyzed the mutants in front of her, she brought her face in close to Claire&#39;s. This gave her the chance to press a bit further forwards and spit a pill into Eliana&#39;s slightly open mouth. Shocked by the sudden invasion, Eliana recoiled back as her clothes vanished and her transformation overtook her. Her forehead was covered by six new pairs of eyes, which grew in two triangles above each of her originals. A pair of long fangs replaced her front canine teeth, immediately beginning to slowly drip a clear liquid. From the shoulders down her arms were covered in dark red chitin, her fingers ending in sharp nails. A second set of arms grew from her shoulders, identical to the other set. Just below her breasts her body pulled out into two separate sets of hips and legs. Above both sets of voluminous ass cheeks a large spider abdomen, covered with the same red chitin as her arms, appeared. An eight inch cock replaced the vagina between her right hand set of legs as both sets were covered by more red chitin, now ending in two toed arachnid feet.<br />
<br />
	Once Eliana&#39;s transformation had finished, something that Jen and Claire didn&#39;t usually see happened: her clothes reformed. Her pantsuit was replaced with a sleeveless grey dress with a knee-length bottom that was wide enough to cover both sets of legs. The dress had two slits in the back that allowed her twin abdomens to not get caught under it while still covering her butts.<br />
<br />
	“Well, that was quite rude of you, and in my store rude customers are punished...”<br />
<br />
	As Eliana said this, she sauntered around to the trio&#39;s behind, her eyes widening when she saw both the living cock stuck in their asshole as well as Lucy&#39;s vagina-mouth, tongue hanging out as she anticipated what was coming.<br />
<br />
	“Oh wow, just how many people are in that body of yours anyways? Whatever the answer is, it&#39;s about to be one more!”<br />
<br />
	Eliana hiked up her skirt, lined her right set of legs up with Lucy&#39;s mouth, and thrust her cock inside, reigniting the orgy that she had interrupted moment&#39;s ago.<br />
<br />
	About half an hour later all six (seven counting Frieda) mutants were exhausted, sexual fluids dripping from every orifice and adding to the many stains already adorning the carpet. Eliana was the first to completely recover, the spider woman standing up and smoothing the wrinkles out of her cum-stained dress. The rest of the mutants were soon back on their feet as well, all of them with looks of bliss on their faces.<br />
<br />
	“Well that was fun, but I&#39;ve gotta go meet back up with my kids, we split up to go check out some of the human clothing stores while I was in here and I imagine they&#39;re wondering where I am. Now that they&#39;re adults we rarely get to spend time together like this so hopefully they&#39;re not too mad. Maybe with any luck one of you knocked me up again so I can raise another batch.”<br />
<br />
	The rabbit-taur&#39;s last sentence mildly concerned Jen and Claire, but with Betty already having zipped out of the store they figured it wasn&#39;t important enough to worry about at the moment. Eliana, who had slipped away as the girls watched Betty leave, quickly returned with several items in her four arms while Florence went back to behind the register.<br />
<br />
	“Here girls, I picked out a few items for you as a little “Thank you” for helping me and Florence out. It&#39;s not often we get to spend quality time with mutants like yourselves, so I want you to have these in hopes that you&#39;ll return soon!”<br />
<br />
	Jen and Claire, a little taken aback by Eliana&#39;s much different attitude compared to earlier, took a moment before responding.<br />
<br />
	“We appreciate the offer, but there&#39;s no way anything in here would fit us.” replied Jen.<br />
<br />
	“Nonsense, Ferals like yourselves are a bit on the uncommon side, but a store like ours has plenty of things designed just for bodies like yours.”<br />
<br />
	Sure enough, when Jen and Claire looked around the store they saw a very different layout compared to earlier. The isles were wider and, as opposed to the typical human ones from before, there were mannequins of all kinds: ones with multiple limbs or breasts, ones designed like tauric or feral bodies, even ones that were as tall as the ceiling or as small as a doll. Even the changing rooms were now designed to accommodate longer and taller occupants.<br />
<br />
	Curious about Eliana&#39;s gifts, the sisters allowed her to dress them up in her choices. This took a surprisingly short time, due in part to the spider woman&#39;s extra set of arms. Once she was done, Eliana stepped back and pulled a mirror over for Jen and Claire to look at themselves with. They&#39;re feral body was now draped in a violet blanket-like sheet that was buckled under their stomach and just below their breasts, covering their body while leaving Jenifer&#39;s lipples unobstructed. In the back there was a cut made that exposed Lucy&#39;s face while still covering their asshole, with another hole that allowed their tail through. A matching brimmed hat was placed atop Claire&#39;s head, with straps around her ears to ensure it didn&#39;t fall off. Finally a simple messenger bag was draped over their shoulders with Frieda, who had been removed at some point during the orgy, safely tucked inside.<br />
<br />
	“You three look wonderful, the best part about those clothes is that even with your clumsy paws it should be no problem to undo and redo the buckles, making it easy to remove and put back on by yourselves.”<br />
<br />
	Jen and Claire thanked Eliana for her generosity and promised to come back at some point. As the trio exited the store, Claire looked up at the sign above the door and she and Jen noticed that it now read “Eliana&#39;s designer clothes for mutants.”</p>
