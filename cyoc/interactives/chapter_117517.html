<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Harold didn&#39;t transform out of his weretiger form as he poked his head out into the hallway, and barely noticed that the height of the ceiling in the house was plenty roomy. Even in his larger form in which he was easily two feet taller than he was in human form, and possibly even taller than that, his rounded ears weren&#39;t bumping the ceiling and that there was actually plenty of room between the top of his ears and the ceiling. His thoughts were for the moment distracted by the fact that Melissa had come home just as he and Virginia had finished a very passionate bought of love making in celebration that the police had decided that the evidence presented that Virginia&#39;s involvement in his transformation into a weretiger was a pure accidental.<br />
<br />
And his thoughts were a bit divided. On one hand, Virginia made him VERY happy. Happier than he&#39;d felt... since Eliza Jenkins, Melissa&#39;s mother, was alive and healthy. She was beautiful, well muscled, with wide hips, impressive E cup breasts and that served to arouse him as he walked into the hall and he felt his penis being to push out of its sheath and against the inside of his bathrobe as he thought over Virginia&#39;s body. Of course, her body wasn&#39;t the only thing she had going for her and really wasn&#39;t what seemed to attract him to her. She was smart and shared a lot of his interests, namely history and when she&#39;d come over to visit, she&#39;d been polite and helpful. At times she was even professional in how she carried herself. Unlike Alice Decrux, Virginia was never trying to get in his pants when she came over, and that had warmed his heart and made him feel real love again.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, however, he still had a daughter to raise, and while Melissa was of the age where teens found out what sex was on their own, he really didn&#39;t Melissa&#39;s introduction to it was her watching him and Virginia have sex. It embarrassed him a bit that he hadn&#39;t remembered to close the door and that he and Virginia made enough noise in their mating that they must have attracted Melissa&#39;s attention when she came home. After all, two weretigers roaring in orgasmic bliss was not something she was used to or heard while they lived in Michigan. And in the end, that actually caught him a bit off guard and made him think over the situation when Virginia came over. <br />
<br />
She had been happy, and love was already blossoming between them, but in their closeness, Virginia became aroused and Harold felt himself follow suit fairly quickly. He&#39;d had kisses like that with Eliza before, but back then it DIDN&#39;T lead to them so quickly deciding to drop everything and make love. Yet, he&#39;d been a Normal back then. Now, as a Were, he found himself quickly aroused by that, and that also gave him a bit of a sense of shame. Not that he&#39;d been with Virginia, as he had the strange and otherworldly sensation that Eliza was okay with him being with Virginia, but that he&#39;d let his own arousal drive him to the point where he wasn&#39;t thinking and left his bedroom door open.<br />
<br />
As he came into the hall, he found Melissa coming out of her bedroom in her own bathrobe and carrying a clean change of clothes that she surely felt would look nice, including clean underwear. She paused when she noticed him in the hallway.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay, dad?&quot; Melissa asked to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... yeah,&quot; Harold said slowly, &quot;Just wanting to check on you before you left on your date...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that won&#39;t be for awhile yet, it&#39;s about three forty-five right now and Trevor won&#39;t get here till closer to five,&quot; Melissa answered, &quot;I want to get a quick shower before making some sandwiches and raiding the snack drawer for potato chips and so forth.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harold slowly nodded and was silent for a moment. He wasn&#39;t about to trail his daughter into the bathroom and watch her shower. He didn&#39;t need to watch her THAT closely to protect her, and he pretty much trusted Trevor Tyson. However, he did want to make sure things were okay between them. Melissa took his silence as an invitation to keep speaking. She gave a fairly warm smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, why don&#39;t you go back and have a good time with Virginia,&quot; Melissa smiled, &quot;It did look like you were having fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Melissa... I&#39;m... I&#39;m sorry you had to see that,&quot; Harold spoke, &quot;I...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay, dad, really,&quot; Melissa answered, &quot;Sure, seeing my dad have sex was not my idea of afternoon entertainment... but then, you&#39;re a large were. That robe looks like it was over-sized and would be practically huge on you before...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s borderline tiny now,&quot; Harold commented, &quot;but it does cover everything... for modesty&#39;s sake.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa nodded, &quot;but you can&#39;t wear your normal clothes while in your fursona. And that&#39;s okay. You do look good, dad, and you&#39;ve looked happy, which makes me happy. It&#39;s okay... really.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re sure?&quot; Harold asked his daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Melissa said slowly, &quot;I mean... seeing you have sex wasn&#39;t something I wanted to see... but, I suppose I got too curious for my own good... and besides, in the end, it&#39;s not like nudity is going to be really that big of an issue. Weres seem to be rather comfortable with that sort of thing. So it&#39;s okay, dad. Go and have a good time. I need to get in the shower.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Melissa then walked down the hall and entered the bathroom. Not too long after, Harold heard the exhaust fan and the shower come on. Knowing that his daughter was in the shower, Harold returned to the bedroom where he found Virginia laying across the bed. She was also fully transformed with her dark nipples poking through the white fur covering her breasts and indicating a lingering scent of arousal to his nose. She looked to him with a pleased smile as he shut the door and then let the bathrobe fall to the floor and revealing the rising penis emerging from its sheath  and ready for another round.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, she&#39;s okay?&quot; Virginia asked him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Harold said slowly, &quot;It&#39;s just that... well... I...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You came here as a normal,&quot; Virginia answered, &quot;It&#39;s understandable. We weres... our libidos are much higher than normal human&#39;s. It&#39;s probably the origin for why so many stories about weres in folklore tend to depict weres and particularly predatory ones as uncontrolled beings that will rape and eat anyone or anything they come across... Which isn&#39;t true. Our libidos are elevated... but we aren&#39;t out of control.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harold looked down to her as he sat on the bed and she looked up to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I went through it when I moved here,&quot; Virginia added, &quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harold soon felt Virginia run a hand down his arm. He could feet the roughness of the pads under her fingers and palm as they ran down the fur on his arm, though in a way it felt good. It made him smile and he did smile down to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so glad to have met you, Virginia,&quot; Harold said to her, &quot;you&#39;ve... you&#39;ve made me feel in a way that I haven&#39;t felt in quite a while. It&#39;s nice...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully it&#39;s a good feeling,&quot; Virginia smiled back and practically curled around him to rub her head against his side.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a very good feeling,&quot; Harold smiled again, &quot;you&#39;ve come to talk and sharing many of the same things I enjoy... I can&#39;t explain it... but... I... I think love you, Virginia McCoy. I know we&#39;ve only just met and started dating...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel the same way,&quot; Virginia spoke, &quot;Maybe it&#39;s been because I&#39;ve been single for ten years... maybe it&#39;s been that you&#39;re kindred student of history... maybe it&#39;s your kindness... your determination to look out for your daughter, even before you became a were. It&#39;s made my own heart burn and ache for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
She nuzzled his side again and then reached her arms up to hold Harold&#39;s shoulders and then pulled him back. Harold rotated on his hips and thrashed his tail in surprise, but he found himself laying across Virginia&#39;s chest and feeling her large soft yet firm breasts compress under his paws. The scent of her arousal grew stronger and he could feel his penis push further out of its sheath, and he knew he&#39;d be fully aroused again soon.<br />
<br />
&quot;After all... a lot of people have come to say there is something special about this place,&quot; Virginia commented, &quot;and it&#39;s not just because most of us can turn into animal-like beings...&quot;<br />
<br />
Harold smiled again,  moved to softly lick at Virginia&#39;s aroused nipples again raising a happy moan from her, &quot;there certainly is something about here... and with the door shut... I&#39;d think we can enjoy that very much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm... yes...&quot; Virginia moaned back as she watched her powerful and sexy male weretiger positioned himself above her with his penis at full attention and aimed directly do that, &quot;Let&#39;s...&quot;<br />
<br />
A pair of growling moans soon rose as Harold slowly eased his his fully erect penis into Virginia&#39;s waiting and wet vagina. The barbs at the base of his penis didn&#39;t bite into Virginia&#39;s very sensitive flesh at the start. When the muscles around her vagina clinched down on Harold&#39;s penis, then the barbs at its base did cause some pain as they dug into her very sensitive flesh, but in an odd way, it was something feline weres actually enjoyed and Virginia was no exception.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Melissa found herself enjoying her shower, but she did her best to be as quick as possible. After all, she did still have the sandwiches and snacks to get ready for for the picnic date. She was quick to hop in the shower once the water was hot enough and scrubbed herself down and lathered her hair in the shampoo she typically used and had unpacked on the day that she and her father moved in. By the time that she climbed out of the shower to dry off, she could hear low growling moans beginning to rise from her father&#39;s bedroom and privately guessed at what was going on. <br />
<br />
As a were, her father was enjoying the perks of being one. Being tremendously attractive physically, and with one that he&#39;d come to love, he was able to enjoy both his mate&#39;s high libido and his own. And it was something that in a way, Melissa was a bit jealous over. Every were seemed to fit the ideal form that people had with regard to physical attractiveness. There were differences between every were, though in some cases the differences weren&#39;t that great, but they still seemed to fall within the &quot;perfect ideal form&quot; of what people considered sexy. Melissa knew that unless... or given who she was dating, UNTIL she became a were, herself, she&#39;d never be able to match them.<br />
<br />
However, she still wasn&#39;t going to just &quot;take the plunge&quot; because her dad had said he was okay with it. Neither was she going to rush into anything that might prevent her from being friends with Trevor in the future. If they were meant to be, it&#39;d happen and they were ready and they&#39;d have their own happy ever after once they got through college, and she&#39;d have as many calves as Trevor could sire. If not, she&#39;d at least want to be able to still be Trevor&#39;s friend, because had been kind, informative, protective, gentle, and just about anything one would look for in a friend. She was fairly sure Trevor would wait... and even knew that the wait might not be all THAT long. She&#39;d already had the hunch that she&#39;d been falling in love with Trevor when he&#39;d taken her to meet his mother.<br />
<br />
She quickly dressed herself and went back downstairs and to the kitchen. Their she gathered and old igloo that her dad had had for years for the occasion when her mother talked him into a camping trip somewhere, sometimes in Minnesota or the more rural areas of Michigan. From there, she then began assembling some sandwiches. They were made with white bread, some sandwich meat, which varied between bologna and pastrami. She also included some slices of lettuce and tomatoes for each sandwich as well. They weren&#39;t super big sandwiches and she had to fish out some small packets of mayonnaise that had been collected from restaurants over the years, just in case Trevor liked mayonnaise on his sandwich. She quickly got all the sandwiches wrapped and packed, she placed in some bags of Lays Potato Chips of various flavors and stuffed them into the igloo. The only problem, was that once that was done, she found that the igloo was full and she had no more room for drinks.<br />
<br />
And then the doorbell rang. Sighing, she moved to the door to find Trevor standing there with a warm smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey... you ready?&quot; Trevor asked.<br />
<br />
A pleasure filled roar soon echoed through the house, catching Trevor&#39;s attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Apparently, the police let Virginia off the hook,&quot; Melissa told him, noticing his eyes drifting away from Melissa and into the house, &quot;So... she and my dad are having a good time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can hear,&quot; Trevor answered as Melissa let him in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, the sandwiches and snacks are all ready,&quot; Melissa answered, &quot;I got them in an igloo in the kitchen. Though... it doesn&#39;t have room for drinks. Can we stop for some sodas on the way out... or?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d think we can stop by one of the gas stations for some sodas,&quot; Trevor nodded, &quot;No problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Melissa smiled, &quot;First, I&#39;ll get the igloo... then tell my dad through the door that we&#39;re heading out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Trevor could answer her, she rushed to the kitchen to collect the igloo and move on to the last thing before heading out on her date...<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The sensation was amazing as Harold felt his weretiger penis slide in and out of his weretigress mate. Even the physical act of mating seemed impressive. In his present form, he didn&#39;t think a normal human would could even accommodate the head of the large rod he was now pistoning in and out of Virginia. He was that big, but with Virginia... he not only fit fine, he fit perfectly. Maybe it was because she was a fellow were and weres were a bit more &quot;elastic&quot; down there than a normal human would. Maybe it was because she was a weretigress and thus she was of comparable size to him. Regardless, he was with her and she was with him. He loved her and she loved him, and he was determined to show her just how much he loved her with each thrust of his penis into her and every use of his presently feline tongue to comb Virginia&#39;s fur on her neck and chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooooorrrrrrrhhhhhhhhh,&quot; Virginia gave a heavy moan beneath him, &quot;Oooooorrrrrrrrrhhhhhhhhmmmmmmmmm yyyeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesssssssssss!&quot;<br />
<br />
Harold kept up his pace, as he could feel that both of them were getting close to another orgasm. Though despite his focus on pleasuring Virginia to the best of his ability, a part of his mind figured that once the sun went down, he could take her out into the woods behind their homes. He&#39;d done some exploring since becoming a weretiger and found a few rather scenic views of the town and the lake, and figured they might be nice places to take Virginia and talk. Of course, she might already know about those spots, as she had been here ten years before he arrived with Melissa, but still, Harold figured it&#39;d be a nice place to take her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, dad,&quot; came Melissa&#39;s voice from the other side of the door, which was thankfully still shut.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeeeeeeeeessssss,&quot; Harold managed, still caught up in his mating with Virginia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Trevor&#39;s here and we&#39;re getting ready to head out,&quot; Melissa answered, &quot;don&#39;t forget to get something to eat, okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harold could tell she was teasing him a bit with that last part. He paused long enough to coherently speak with his daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have your pills?&quot; Harold asked, referring to the werecow birth control pills they&#39;d picked up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I got them in my bag,&quot; Melissa answered, &quot;if things really hit it off... I&#39;ll be ready. Have a good night with Virginia.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember to be be back by eleven and no later!&quot; Harold called, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t want you or Trevor lost and alone in the woods!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, dad,&quot; Melissa answered.<br />
<br />
There followed a moment of silence as Harold then resumed thrusting in and out of his mate.</p>
