<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With the fulfillment of a new home came the knowledge of the floorplan, where everyone&#39;s rooms were, and the new lifestyles that my family would have adopted.  I knew, for example, that my father would be off at a stock holder meeting for a tech company that he owned a decent chunk of, and my sister would be off at horseback riding lessons.  My mom, on the other hand, would likely be out by the pool doing yoga before going for a swim.  In my minds eye I pictured her, a short 39 year old brunette with a little pudge around the middle and breasts that were giving way to gravity and time.  I knew I could force anything I wanted to happen with the power of the ring, but I would prefer to give her what SHE wanted.<br />
<br />
I made my way through the house formulating a plan for how to talk to her.  Naturally my plans came crashing to a halt when I walked out the french doors and saw her in the position called downward facing dog.  Thin yoga pants were stretched tight across ass, and her camel toe was prominently visible.  I gulped at the sight, still excited, but now also nervous at what I was hoping to accomplish.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there Joey!&quot; she called out having seen me approaching while I was distracted.  She did not look the same as I remembered.  Her breasts were fuller and firmer, evidence that the new lifestyle I had given us had apparently allowed for my mom to have breast implants.  I didn&#39;t like it, but maybe she did.  She had a tight, firm belly now, and the wrinkles in her face were gone.  All evidence of the power of the ring.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Enjoying the view?&quot; she asked as she wiggled her bum a bit.  I could feel the heat rising in my cheeks as she guessed the truth so easily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, actually.&quot;  It was true.  I could feel myself starting to stiffen, and right at the moment I wanted nothing more than to tear her yoga pants in two and bury my face between her thighs.  I honestly believed she would be disappointed in me if she knew the animal impulses I was restraining.  I still wanted her to want this, not just go along with it because I made it happen.<br />
<br />
She unwound herself and faced me.  She was wearing a pink tank top and her nipples were easily visible through the thin material.  The piercings probably helped.  I had never known my mom to have pierced nipples, but maybe she hadn&#39;t before the wish.  I was starting to wonder just how different the world would be.  I realized I was staring as she shook her hair out of the ponytail she had it in.  &quot;Just come to gawk, or did you need something?&quot; she teased me with a kind smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, I wanted to ask you something.&quot;  I was thinking fast of how to salvage the situation since I no longer felt like asking her if she wanted to change anything about her appearance.  Fortunately I was able to think quickly and realized I just needed to change my wording a little.  &quot;Is there anything you have always wanted but were too afraid to try or ask for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure I follow.  We&#39;re rich, Joey, I can have whatever I want for the most part.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, but it&#39;s that &#39;for the most part&#39; I am talking about.  I mean like things that are illegal or immoral or anything like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I mean I&#39;m no saint you know?  I&#39;ve tried a few things that were illegal in my day.  Why the interest?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you know I love you and dad, and I just thought if there were some dream I could help you fulfill, some wish that you just never had the nerve to go for, anything like that, I would love to help you out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, are you offering me drugs?&quot;  She looked a little nervous now.  &quot;Are you saying you are a drug dealer?&quot;  She was quickly becoming both angry and afraid of me.  I realized this conversation was not going as intended.  I thought for a moment and muttered under my breath, &quot;I wish I had another chance at this conversation.<br />
<br />
All of a sudden I was back in the house, about to walk out the french doors towards the pool again.<br />
<br />
I looked out and saw my mom&#39;s ass in the tight yoga pants again, but I restrained myself this time.  I walked off to the kitchen and made a couple of mimosas to take out with me.<br />
<br />
By the time I made it outside this time she was in a totally different pose.  I set the drinks down on a nearby table and sat down to watch her routine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Joey, what&#39;s up?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thought you might want a little refreshment,&quot; I indicated her glass with a wave of my hand.<br />
<br />
Her limbs unfolded again and she came over to sit down near me.  &quot;Thank you very much.  You have certainly turned into quite the polite young man.  I&#39;m very proud of you, you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad to hear it,&quot; I responded.  &quot;I like being able to keep my parents smiling.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you regularly succeed with me,&quot; she gave a genuine smile.  &quot;What are you up to today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, I wanted to ask you something.  Well, I was going to ask you and dad together, but it&#39;s not really necessary.  I can ask him later on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?  What&#39;s up?&quot;  She seemed intrigued.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you could have anything you ever wanted, what would it be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?  I have two wonderful children, a great husband, wealth, health, and a life of luxury.  What could I possibly want?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t just mean this lifestyle, Mom.  I mean anything.  An exotic animal?  A date with a celebrity?  Anything at all.  What is your single biggest dream?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my...&quot; she trailed off as her eyes went distant.  I could tell she was thinking of fantasies and dreams that she had either given up on or already achieved and trying to think of what answer she could possibly give.  &quot;Well,&quot; she began before I saw her give a slight shake of her head.  &quot;No, not that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it Mom?&quot;  I wanted to know.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot;  I could tell she didn&#39;t feel comfortable telling me.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish you felt comfortable telling me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just like that the tension eased, and she sat back in her chair taking a drink of her mimosa.  She gave me a sort of conspiratorial smirk as she began.  &quot;Well, it&#39;s awfully embarrassing, but back when I was a junior in high school I had this fantasy that Stephen Jamison, he was the quarterback and all the girls wanted him.  Anyway, I had this fantasy that he would sneak me off to the locker room and the whole team would be in there naked and waiting for me.  They would tear my clothes off and fill every hole in my body over and over until I was dripping their hot cum everywhere.  Of course, I was imagining them all with these massive cocks and running two or three of them on me at a time, really stretching me out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow mom, that&#39;s kinda hot.&quot;  Of course, it wasn&#39;t what I had been hoping for, but it was still interesting to know what her fantasy was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Instead I happened to catch your father with a titty mag in his locker one day and it turned out that the centerfold looked almost exactly like me.  It didn&#39;t take me long to put two and two together, and he was a good guy.  Nothing like what I imagine an entire football team would be like, but then how could one guy compete with that, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that still what you want?  To be gang banged by a football team?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I mean it would hardly be proper.  Not only would it be cheating on your father, the possibility for a scandal would be huge.  I just don&#39;t think I could do it now a days.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if I could set it up for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked taken aback.  Her son was offering her a dream come true, she was obviously skeptical.  &quot;Well, I mean...The risks are just too great.  I don&#39;t know...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, if I can find the guys who are willing, make sure they are all clean, no drugs or diseases or anything, pay them some hush money, make them sign secrecy vouchers, set up some security to make sure no one records it or anything, would you want to go through with it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot;  I could see her debating it inside her own head.  &quot;What about your father?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does he know about your fantasy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but he might get jealous if I get to live out my fantasy.  Are you gonna make his fantasies come true too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing,&quot; I replied.  &quot;It&#39;s the least I could do for the great life you have given me and my sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if you think you could set it up, sure thing.  I would love to have it happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
I sat back and sipped my mimosa as I wondered what it would turn out my dad was into.  Setting up any fantasy at all would be simple with my new power.  Of course, I could always change her deepest fantasy into something else if I wanted to...</p>
