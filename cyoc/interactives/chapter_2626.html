<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The light slowly returned to normal illumination.  Timothy stood perfectly still, not exactly sure what this prophesy was all about, and how it was so powerfull as to do something as strange as what just went on.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot;  Timothy said hesitantly, practically a squeak.
<br />

<br />
Timothy wrenched his eyes shut and shed a few tears in pain. All at once a pain hit him right in the face, or more accuratly, from the tip of his snout.  A burning hot sensation directed from there with the speed of a bolt of lightening all along his muzzle, then his entire head.  He put his paws over his mouth to muffle his scream ... but scream he could not.  Not a single sound came from his mouth.
<br />

<br />
He grit his teeth together and removed his paw from his snout, but it felt funny on his muzzle, as if it were not his paw at all.  Slowly he opened his eyes and looked at his digits.  they seemed longer, the claws were much larger.  Each finger was much larger than before.  The lack of fur disturbed him the most.  Lack of fur?!?
<br />

<br />
The pain subsided long enough for him to think straight.
<br />
He began to inspect himself visually.  He still had fur in some places, and was completely bald in others.  Same feet, same legs, same tail, same rump, same shoulders, same neck, same mane ... huh?
<br />
Same mane?  He ran his strange paws through his fuzzy, thick green mane.  Green?  If that wasn't strange enough, he felt bumps on his head, almost between his ears.  They hurt when touched, so he left them alone.  He turned to find a mirror and noted to himself that he didn't look all that bad...
<br />

<br />
Who was he kidding.  he was a freak!  He looked like a mutant gerbil!
<br />
Fur in some places, bald in others, a long green mane stretching from the top of his head to the back of his neck, down to the small of his back. &quot;Still well hung, at least.&quot; he chuckled to himself.  His massive maleness hanging limp from his sheath a good 5 inches, not being able to go in any further becase of his massive size.  He sighed to himself as he looekd at his reflection &quot;But, who could love this, THIS!&quot;  His voice was deep, commanding, and dominant.  Even a little feral.  He grinned a little to himself and looked himself over once more, however, before he could even finish his self examination in front of the mirror, the pain hit him again, like running into a brick wall, but he wasn't given the option to fall over.  He stood there, like a lifeless statue, burning in pain.  In fact, he felt as if his insides were on fire, and it was spreading, rapidly!
<br />

<br />
He clutched his head as the two lumps atop it pulsed, as if they were alive.  The pain was so unbearable, Timothy was still wondering why he hadn't passed out, when suddenly, he did.  The poor freakish Timothy faded into a dream, as his body began to shift into that which the prophesy foretold.
<br />

<br />
Timothy awoke in his dream, below what had to be the biggest willow tree he had ever seen.  All around was a green field, with large, snow capped mountains in the far, fog-filled distance.  The view was definetly nice, and the shade from the massive tree made him feel at ease within himself.  
<br />

<br />
He turned around completely and took a step forward, bumping into a cloaked figure.  Timothy stumbled backwards and apologised &quot;I'm sorry, I didn't see you there.&quot;  he said as he looked up, and up, and up ... Timothy swallowed and decided that now would be a good time to take a few steps back.  &quot;Please, I'm sorry, do not hurt me.&quot;  He almost begged that last sentence.  The figure chuckled a bit, or seemed to, perhaps it was amused?
<br />

<br />
Timothy did nothing but stare at the towering, cloaked figure.  It had to be at least 9 feet tall.  Nothing else could be ascertained because of the cloak it wore.  He hesitantly reached an arm out to shake hands.  &quot;I'm uh, Tim .. Timothy.&quot;  He said, a little fear in his voice.
<br />

<br />
Again, no reaction.  Timothy began to wonder if it was even alive.  When he bumped into it, it felt, solid, and hard.  Perhaps it was just a statue afterall?  He reached out and took hold of the cloak it wore and began to give it a small tug, testingly.  
<br />

<br />
Nothing.  The figure remained motionless.  He pulled harder, the cloak began to give.  Again, no reaction, no movement.  He pulled hard again and the cloak loosened more.  Determined now, Timothy gave one final tug and the cloak was removed, landing fully atop him.
<br />

<br />
When he navigated his way out of the huge cloak, he was stunned.  It was definetly not a statue, it was a dragon!  A creature of myth and legend.  It was definetly alive, for it's chest would heave and fall with each breath it took.  The dragon's eyes locked with Timothys.  Poor Tim felt like a deer caught in headlights.  A thousand thoughts rushed through Timothy's head.  What if he'd angered it?  What is going to happen?  Will he become food ... or worse?
<br />

<br />
&quot;If you wanted me naked that badly, all you had to do was ask.&quot; A deep, commanding, dominant, perhaps even feral voice hit him square in the chest, making Tim's very bones rattle.  Tim couldn't even blink.  Did he just hear what he thought he heard?  Timothy stammered  &quot;I uh.  I mean, I didn't know... &quot; he trailed off into babble.  
<br />

<br />
The dragon chuckled once more.  &quot;Relax, friend.&quot;  Again that voice hit him, like a bass fiddle, making the bones in his chest shake as they did before.  Timothy nodded and looked the dragon over.  The sun danced on his scaled hide.  His colouration was green, which faded to yellow along his throught, belly and underneath his long, sweeping tail, right down to the decidedly spade-like tip at the end.  It was quite muscular too, having human musculature.  Tim thought to himself that this dragon was indeed a sight to behold.  It wasn't overly muscular, but it was definetly everything Timothy hoped to be.
<br />

<br />
He looked again at the dragon and noticed the biggest pair of balls he had ever seen!  Even some of the oversized porn stars had nothing on this!  It was just huge.  The sheath of this beast, which was nothing short of massive practically made Timothy erect just by looking at it.  The length housed inside has to be as big as Tim's leg, and probably just as thick!  The dragon smiled and gestured toward Tim's groin &quot;I see you approve?&quot; his voice was lighter, almost as if the wind caried it to him gently, almost seductively..?  Tim just nodded a bit and blushed.  &quot;Y .. Yeah.&quot; Tim manged to say, trying to get himself out of an awkward situation.  Looking down at his own length.  Erect, he was definetly erect.  
<br />

<br />
Tim blushed more and realised that he was just as naked as the dragon.  But he was erect, painfully so.  He was never this hard in his life.  The dragon crouched down and wrapped Tim in warm, velvet like wings.  Timothy reached out to touch the dragon ...
<br />

<br />
The dream faded all too quick for Timothy's taste.  He opened his eyes and looked forward.  He was in his room, familiar surroundings, his bed, his dresser, the table, with that chest on top, the full length mirror on the wall.  He turned to look in the mirror and saw the dragon.  He froze, staring at the dragon in the mirror.
<br />

<br />
He didn't more for what felt like an eternity.  then finally, he blinked, hopeing that the dragon would either move, or be gone when he opened his eyes.  Taking another look in the mirror revealed the dragon once more.  Motionless.  While it may have been a game to the dragon, it was wearing thin on Timothy.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Alright you&quot; Tim said, while pointing to the mirror, in that deep voice he had aquired.  The relection mimicked Tim's moves exactly as he did.  It was nothing more than his reflection.  He was the dragon.
<br />
The prohpeshy had indeed been fulfilled, he was now that stud of a dragon.  Tim grinned to himself, admiring his new form.  &quot;I could get used to this&quot;  he said while looking himself over in various poses.  He liked what he saw.  For the first time in his life he was large, strong, powerfull and dominmant.  And he knew it.
<br />

<br />
He reached out with his massive paws and cupped underneath his massive balls, grinning all the while.  &quot;I'm so, so ... big!&quot;  They were heavy in his paws as well.  He sat down on the side of his bed, which groaned under his new bulk.  He took a paw and rubbed across his sheath, similar to how he did when he was a fox.  After a few  more minutes of sensual rubbing, his sheath bulged as the tip of his length emerged.  Rubbing the tip with one paw, and his sheath with the other, he felt a sence he had never felt before.  This intense pleasure hit him as his length arose from his sheath.  
<br />

<br />
Longer and thicker it became.  He closes his eyes and threw his head back, emitting a low growl, his cock slapped wetly against his stomach.  He wrapped his paw around his growing girth and stroked.  Again, and again.  Each stroke threw him into a wave of pleasure, the likes of which he had never even dreamed of!  After a few minutes of this enticing sensation, he found it no longer brought him pleasure.  He opened his eyes and looked at his length.  No wonder the peasure had gone, it had gotten too big around to grasp with one paw.  Even his newly enlarged paw was not big enough to get around his massive girth!  
<br />

<br />
Timothy gripped his length with both paws and began stroking again, eager to see just how big of a dragon he was.  He spread his legs wider on his bedas his massive balls took up more and more room between them.  They were so large in fact, that they had to be beachball sized by now.  Tim grinned.  The power that he now felt made his length feel rock hard.  He slowly, and carefully stood up.
<br />

<br />
He couldn't believe his eyes.  His balls were so large that they hung down to just below his knees!  His cock had to be at least 3 and a half feet long, and about 18 inches thick!  The hole at the tip was a good 4 inches wide.  Tim had never felt this powerfull in his life.  He began to paw off like never before.  Eager to find out just how potent he was.  Minutes passed like seconds as he finally reached a climax.  He let out a long low, gutteral moan and let out a blast of his seed.  It was so powerfull that he was knocked off his feet and onto his bed once more.  Wave after wave of it kept coming out of his length.  Tim nearly passed out that it felt so good.
<br />

<br />
When he was finished, he looked at his length.  It hadn't softened that much and was still dripping copious ammounts of his essence.
<br />
He saw it everywhere too, on the wall, the ceiling all over his front.  He got off the bed to 'survey the damage', he thought to himself with a chuckle.  When in fact, he had done some damage.
<br />

<br />
He looked at the wall and realised for the first time that there was a hole in it.  About 8 inches tall and the same wide.  He looked through the hole and saw the bathroom.  He went and stood in the doorway, flicked the light on, and was not sure whether to laugh or to grin.  He had almost filled the bathtub with his seed!  He put a paw into it, and it sunk in.  there was at least 8 to 10 inches of his seed in the tub that had passed through the hole he shot through the wall.  Looking back down at his length, which was retreating into his  sheath, all he could do was smile.  He wasn't even tired in the least after all that.  He looked back into the bathroom again and noticed that a tile was missing from the wall, due to the hole he made.  He was so powerfull now that just his seed ripped through the plaster in two walls, and shattered a tile to dust!
<br />

<br />
&quot;The prophesy of the dragon, hmm?  This could be interesting&quot; he said to no one inparticular.</p>
