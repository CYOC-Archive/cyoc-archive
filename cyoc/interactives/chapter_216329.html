<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt looked at the ticket in his hand, trying to find any indication of his destination. He scanned the paper for any clue, but it was a completely blank ticket, no name for the airliner, the destination, absolutely nothing in regards to clues. All he could see was the seat number, the flight number, and the gate number. He tried typing in the flight number on a website on his phone and still, nothing came up. Shrugging his shoulders, Matt walked towards the gate listed on the ticket, walking further down the concourse as there was less and less foot traffic as he made his way to the gate. He had no idea where he was going, but he figured he would just wait until he boarded the plane and asked a flight attendant.<br />
<br />
After a short wait, it was time for Matt to board the plane. He handed over his ticket and made his way down the jet bridge. As he walked onto the plane, he saw that it was completely empty. The cabin lights were dimmed, and there was no one around, not to mention that the plane was a blank white color with no livery to indicate the airliner.<br />
<br />
Matt walked down the aisle and found his seat. As he settled in, he looked around and realized that he was the only person on the plane. He felt a sense of unease, but he tried to shake it off. Maybe this was some sort of private jet? He had heard of those before and the guy who handed him the ticket seemed peculiar enough to be the type of person to take a plane like this.<br />
<br />
As the plane began to taxi, Matt finally found the flight attendant to ask where the plane was going.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me, ma&#39;am? Can you tell me where this flight is headed?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
The flight attendant looked at him with a puzzled expression before checking her list. &quot;Sir, this flight is headed to Montreal Trudeau Airport. Is this not your intended destination?&quot; she muttered in a heavy French Canadian Accent<br />
<br />
Matt was left in confusion. He had never been to Montreal before, let alone anywhere in Canada for that matter, and he had no idea what he was going to do once he landed. But there was no turning back now, and there were worse places to be after all. He had been told by some friends that went over there that it was a pretty cool city with a lot of history and a vibrant nightlife to go with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhm, no, that&#39;s not where I thought I was going. But I guess I&#39;ll give this place a chance and figure things out once I get there.&quot; Matt said with a nervous chuckle.<br />
<br />
The flight attendant offered him some complimentary snacks, and gave him a sympathetic smile and went back to her duties. Matt sank back into his seat, trying to think of what he would do once he landed in Montreal as he popped a maple candy in his mouth. He began to doze off as the plane lifted off into the skies above as his changes took course over the next few hours. He felt himself getting heavier in his seat, as a mix of muscle and fat began to develop on his body. His face began to tingle as facial hair began to grow along his face. Later on, he prodded his teeth and felt that a tooth was missing. This set off even more confusion for Matt, leading him to head up to the Lavatory to see what was happening. He then stepped in and saw what looked like a completely different person. A face with a full beard with touches of gray, aged skin, and a missing tooth, not to mention he looked a lot bigger than he once was. This looked like someone who was in his 40s, not the 19-year-old boy he remembered himself as. He walked out with a bewildered look as he ran into the flight attendant once again.<br />
<br />
“y a-t-il quelque chose qui ne va pas?” She asks Matt.<br />
<br />
To Matt’s shock, he registered this perfectly in his head as “Is there anything wrong?” despite previously not knowing a word in French (he took Spanish in school). His mind began to become fuzzy, as he involuntarily answered “Non, pas de probleme” to the woman, making his way back to his seat. He then began to hear the pilot announce the approach to his destination, announcing in both French and English. He begins to check his pockets and pulls out his wallet, noticing that his money has changed from the green shades associated with American money, to shiny, multicolored, Canadian currency. In the other pocket he took out his passport only to see that it changed to a Canadian passport. He opened it up and learned more about his new life. He wasn’t 19 year old Matt Lucas from the US anymore, he was a big, burly French Canadian man by the name of Mathieu Leclerc.<br />
<br />
“Sacrament de Tabarnak!” he shouted to himself in his head, in disbelief of who he had become. The plane approached the runway, taxiing to the gate afterwards and docking at the gate. Matt would then step out of the plane and walk through the jet bridge into the airport terminal, leaving his old, American life behind…</p>
