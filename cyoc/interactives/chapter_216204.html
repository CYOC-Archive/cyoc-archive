<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle walked the last few blocks to his apartment, his legs forcing him to walk heel to toe as if strutting down a catwalk at a fashion show, he tried to force them to walk normally only to find it caused pain in his hips, he tried to get used to that, but gave up because of the strain. His hips swayed back and forth as if to say &quot;I told you so.&quot; to his attempts to make them obey him. His new massive cock and balls swayed with this movement, his sack rubbing against his athletic thighs, bouncing back and forth against his legs, cock bobbing up and down rubbing against what little skirt covered it. The sensation annoyed Kyle, it made the mass of his new manhood much more apparent to him, but continuously stimulating its length. <br />
<br />
Finally reaching the stairwell to the apartment building, Kyle opened the door, then tore off the wedge heels and tossed them into the trash bin. &quot;Fucking heels, how do girls even deal with these things?&quot; He grumbled as he began walking up the stairs, his new gait made going up stairs not only somewhat challenging to him, but also making the bulk of his new lower half much more apparent. He lived on the fifth floor, and as he reached the door of his apartment his legs ached, his attempts at forcing his legs to move normally up the stairs straining him even more that just trying to walk. Kyle entered to apartment, dropped his back pack, and tore off the skirt and ruined boxers. He lived there with his mom, a single working woman, who wouldn&#39;t be home until after midnight. Kyle made his way to his bedroom and sat on his bed, his ass feeling awkward under him, he finally stopped and stared at the damage that was done.<br />
<br />
Originally he stood at a short 4&#39;9&quot; tall, but with Jen forcing a swap on him he now stood 6&#39;8&quot;, most of it in legs, he stared in a mixture of frustration, rage, disgust and awe at the scene before him, starting at the pale flesh of his stomach, just below the belly button, his waist ballooned out, finishing at hips that measured at 46&quot;,  nearly twice as large as his legs, stretching out in front of him were two toned, tight and athletic legs, with skin the color of mocha, ones that up until this morning he would have killed to see naked, and now here they were, attached to him. His eyes were now drawn and glued to what could only be called a third leg, his new cock which measured eighteen inches soft, now stood, ridged and hard throbbing with every heartbeat, at an unnaturally large twenty four inches. Kyle stared at his two foot cock, nearly hypnotized but how large it was, he reached down and touch the throbbing black mass, and just like that, Kyle gave into his urges. <br />
<br />
Kyle had always fantasized about doing a lot of different things he&#39;d seen in his browsing online, but one that always turned him on was autofellatio, he could only dream of it, and most would only think of it as a fetish for artwork. But here he was, with a cock big enough and the chance to do it, he was tired, frustrated and most of all horny. Kyle swung his long sexy legs onto his bed and started to position himself, laying his back against his bed and pressing his plump ass against the  wall his cock obliged, pressing tantalizingly close to his mouth, he put his feet against the wall and pushed forward, his cock pressed against his lips and he started sucking, his hands moving instinctively as he rhythmically moved his hips back and forth, his massive cock pistoning in and out of the back of his throat. His hands guided themselves, one to the base of his cock, and the other to his new pussy, without thinking about it he started expertly fingering his new womanhood, and lighting struck, he moaned like he never had before as he continued to suck, enraptured by the sheer ecstasy that now human up until this point had ever felt.<br />
<br />
Kyle tensed up as he finally cam, he wanted to gag, but only found himself swallowing every drop of his load going down his throat, when he finished swallowing, he collapsed, ass over tea kettle, his knees hit off the end of the bed and he somehow landed on his feet. Panting he dragged his sexy lower half onto the bed, and pulled himself against the wall against the head of his bed, taking in what he just did and staring at his lower half. After half an hour he sat up, and stroked his right leg, lifting it against his cheek, it still didn&#39;t feel natural to him, but after the mind blowing orgasm he finally welcomed his new addition. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you&#39;re mine now, Latoia may have not loved you enough, but I will.&quot; He sighed, getting up and walking over to the dresser he opened the top drawer, finding his usually choice in clothing hadn&#39;t changed in anything but size. He grabbed some boxers and went to the bathtub to soak and lavish his new legs with the attention they deserved. &quot;I&#39;ll have to give Jen a gift as a thank you for these babies!&quot;</p>
