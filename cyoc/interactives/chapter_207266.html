<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The two boys stood there looking at Scotty&#39;s exposed new vagina.  It was smooth and hairless, looking like a narrow slit between his legs.  Their young penises remained flaccid.  Scotty was continuing to panic but starting to settle down a little. He used his fingers to explore his new opening, spreading it slightly.   &quot;Ok, ok, ok&quot; Scotty repeated to himself.  &quot;Its ok, er um, dude&quot; Jace started to say, his eyes not leaving the vagina, &quot;we don&#39;t mind that your a girl.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah&quot; Danny chimed in, &quot;I&#39;ve never actually seen a vagina before today.&quot;  &quot;Me neither, actually&quot; Scotty added quietly.  &quot;What does it feel like?&quot; Jace asked.  &quot;Its soft and kind dry inside&quot; Scotty stated, his fingers going deeper into his slit.  &quot;Can I touch it&quot; Danny asked &quot;for my birthday?&quot;  Scotty thought before a second before saying &quot;Yes, but you both have to take off your suit. I don&#39;t want to be the only naked one.&quot;  The boys thought for a second before silently dropping their towels and then their swimming trunks.  Their acorn sized penises exposed to the world. <br />
<br />
 Just then the boys heard the door open and slam and foot stomps coming up the stairs.  They turned in shock not able to move.  Jackson turns the corner entering the room, before stopping shocked and speechless.  &quot;Umm&quot; Jackson grunted, &quot;What...&quot; he tried again.  The three bottomless kids stood motionless as Jacksons younger brother, Kyle, 10 years old, and his older friend, Kurt, 14 years old stared into the room from behind him. Jackson and Kyle started laughing at the boys naked bodies while  Kurt&#39;s eyes were fixed on Scottys fingers in his vagina.  A large tent started forming in Kurt&#39;s swimming trunks.  <br />
<br />
Danny blushed and quickly explained the entire scene to the new comers. They all had to field some questions, especially Scotty.  The questions finally turned to why they were all standing there naked.  &quot;Scotty was going to let us touch him, down there&quot; Jace said sheepishly pointing between Scotty&#39;s lets, &quot;but he said we all had to be naked to do it&quot;.  &quot;Really&quot; an excited Kurt blurted out, &quot;can I do it too?&quot; In one quick movement Kurt pulled down his swim trunks exposing his erect penis.  <br />
<br />
Everyone&#39;s eyes were fixed on Kurt&#39;s cock. Maybe it was because they were prepubescent, and maybe it was because Kurt was unusually large for a 14 year old, everyone was dumbstruck by the size of Kurt&#39;s member.  &quot;Wow&quot; Kyle stated, &quot;that&#39;s the biggest I&#39;ve ever seen. Even bigger than my daddy&#39;s&quot;  Kurt&#39;s penis was a little bigger that 6 and half inches but was already very thick, roughly the size of a gatorade bottle when he was fully hard.  The attention made Kurt get even harder, his penis reaching its full potential.  &quot;Yeah&quot; Kurt said &quot;I&#39;ve got a big one. Especially compared to your little peewee penises.&quot; Kurt was feeling full of himself and an idea came to him, &quot;lets all measure&quot; <br />
<br />
Danny reluctantly found the ruler he kept in his desk and brought it out.  &quot;The girl should do it&quot; Kurt said grabbing the ruler and giving it to Scotty.  Scotty quietly examined the ruler before reaching out and placing it next to Kurt&#39;s boner. &quot;No&quot; Kurt said, &quot;you have to measure from the balls and push it down onto the ruler to get the actual measurement and so everyone can see.&quot; Scotty slowly moved the ruler under Kurt&#39;s unit and measured like Kurt instructed, &quot;6 and half inches&quot; Scotty stated.  Kurt was breathing heavier, clearly excited by the touch of a hand on his penis.  <br />
<br />
Scotty turne to Jace and Danny. He measured them as he had Kurt.  Jace measured in at 1&quot; and Danny at 1 1/4&quot;.  Everyone turned to Kyle then. &quot;No&quot; Kyle protested, &quot;I don&#39;t want to do that.&quot;  Kyle tried to move into the hallway but Kurt grabbed him, &quot;Come on dude we all did it, you have to too.&quot;  Kyle started to protest again, but Kurt moved quickly and pantsed him.  Kyle turned crimson red as he tried to reach down and pull up his pants. Kurt moving to stop him and restraining his arms.  Scotty moved in to measure.  It was immediately apparent that Kyle was the smallest, the measurement confirmed it, Kyle was an 1/2 inch long.  Kurt snickered as Scotty read out the measurement, and released Kyle, who fell to the floor.  &quot;Its cold in here&quot; Kyle screamed at Kurt.  &quot;Yeah not that cold&quot; Kurt laughed giving his boner a stroke, &quot;looks like I&#39;m the man of the house little boys.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Kyle turned to Scotty, &quot;not I believe I get to touch it&quot; he said excitedly.  Scotty felt a rush of emotion, he felt that letting this boy touch him would be gross, but he was also intrigued, and he felt submissive to his demands.  As Scotty thought, Kurt didn&#39;t wait for permission, his hand reached Scotty&#39;s pussy, his middle finger pushing forcefully on its lips.  Kurt was breathing heavy again.  Kurt began running his fingers up and down the slit before pushing further inside.  All of the other boys watched transfixed on what was happening between Scotty&#39;s legs.  Kurt tried to get his middle finger and pointer into the slit, but Scotty cried out, &quot;stop, it hurts, their too big.&quot; Kurt listened and began working his middle finger in, the rest curled down.  Kurt stopped and removed his finger, wetting it in his mouth and then began again, this time forcing it deeper into Scotty.  Kyle broke away from looking at Scotty to look at Kurt&#39;s cock.  &quot;Whoa&quot; Kyle said, &quot;what&#39;s happening to it.&quot; The boys watched Kyles manly cock pulsing hard the teen boy unable to stop himself from shooting his load in front of them all.  He groaned as squirt after squirt of hot white cum sprayed forth from his unit.  When it stopped everyone surveyed the mess he had left on the floor.</p>
