<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jackson had been more or less morose at the start of the afterparty at Gabe&#39;s place when things shook up and everyone involved turned out to be mostly male. He had been hoping to get some alone time with Linda De La Cruz and her incredible tits, seeing as it seemed by now Sasha preferred bouncing on water polo boy dick. But now, he had developed some other interests and found himself sliding into the position of storyteller in front of the younger jocks attending the party here too.<br />
<br />
Jackson had little to no idea why he was finding the idea so appealing, but here he was. Telling the stories that he remembered from his time there at high school, and even including some details he had not initially remembered. The house was an inviting two story roomy place that allowed for this kind of intimate atmosphere. It was gonna be a really chill party, in contrast to the many wild teen parties Jackson had attended.<br />
<br />
There was Danny, his old rival, and he remembered saying some pretty unkind stuff to him before. For some reason the reminisce included some regret for that. Ah, he wasn&#39;t going soft. He knew that Danny was a rival everywhere it counted. In the field, in the gym, and in bringing home chicks. Some of the jocks - the more rowdy and raunchy young guys - were asking for some stories about Jackson&#39;s romantic life for some reason. He had never really delighted in stories about that at these kinds of parties before.<br />
<br />
It all seemed too personal, too weird to share these kinds of stories. But now, something seemed to be urging him on. A different perception coming on as to his relationship with the guys. Somehow, his view of them was shifting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey guys, I&#39;m gonna get some water. Think my voice is getting pretty rough.&quot; Jackson chuckled and then left the circle of guys sitting there, hearing them chatter about how &quot;awesome&quot; he was, and how they didn&#39;t expect him to have this many stories. Honestly, Jackson hadn&#39;t expected to have such detail to share. He wiped off some sweat from his forehead as he stood there in the kitchen. Again, it was nice and just like home. With a door leading out from the kitchen area into the backyard right there.<br />
<br />
And it was despite that pretty warm in here. Jackson cursed to himself, &quot;Fuuuck this heat...&quot; He murmured some and drank a whole glass of water in one shot, before going in for another and wondering what that was. He didn&#39;t THINK the temperature in here was that bad. Maybe it did merit some inspection just to be sure. He&#39;d hate to pass out or something before the drinks got passed around.<br />
<br />
Well, that was if he drank any. He needed to be more responsible for his drinking---wait, why was he---? Ah well, maybe it was just the heat getting to him. Jackson wiped his forehead again, but no sweat this time. He looked around in time to see Gabe walking out into the kitchen. &quot;Hey Jackson, I was uh, just wondering. I wanted to talk to you about something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Talk to me about something?&quot; Jackson contemplated and then nodded, &quot;What&#39;s up Gabe?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Terry said he got something outta his system, and I was wondering about that. I mean, with you and all...&quot; Gabe seemed to blush, and looked down. Wondering when just talking to another guy got so difficult. He remembered when it was easy...right? He thought he did, but the more that he thought back on it the less likely that was the case. It was like there was a fog between how things were now and how they were before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not making much sense here, man. What do you want from me?&quot; Jackson asked, crossing his arms and leaning up against the fridge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Gabe started, and looked at Jackson&#39;s body, &quot;I-I think you&#39;re really, really sexy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hah! You and most of the female student body here!&quot; Jackson said with a laugh. Though even as he said it Jackson seemed confused for a moment due in part to the exact inflection behind his statement. It was like it took on a new meaning. He shook his head, &quot;And...what do you mean by that? I mean, I get you recognizing how damn good looking I am...&quot; Jackson flexed an arm to accentuate, &quot;But what are you looking to get out of this confession?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabe bit his lip and then finally spat it out, &quot;I-I really think you&#39;re amazingly attractive and---and I would really like to do something sexual with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
He waited for the inevitable it seemed derision. He waited for the laughter. The disdain. He thought he remembered Jackson being just that kind of guy. Instead, Jackson shook his head and sighed, &quot;Look dude, any interest at all is flattering. It really is. But the thing is, I&#39;m not gay. I&#39;m into women. So I&#39;m pleased as punch you think I&#39;m fucking hot, but I&#39;m not down for any action.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No...action at all...?&quot; Gabe asked as he shook his head, &quot;I mean, we&#39;ll be here for the better part of the night at my place. I forgot to invite any girls. And the Jackson White I know wouldn&#39;t like to go that long without...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jackson paused as Gabe brought that little fact up. It WAS the truth even still. He was absolutely straight, at least so far and as far as he perceived it, but right now he was dimly aware of the fact that he had no real sexual partners here. &quot;Damn. You got me there. I&#39;d love to bust my nut some time tonight in a hottie here, but no hotties means...&quot; He looked over at Gabe.<br />
<br />
He saw how Gabe seemed to brighten up and smile. As if he was anticipating this. Jackson shook his head, &quot;Please don&#39;t tell me you arranged things this way just to get me in this position...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...N-No way man!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;&#39;Kay. Well. You have me in this position, and I&#39;m not about to go my whole fucking night without some action. So I could either call up some girlfriends who might take some hours getting here or be busy...or I could...&quot; Jackson contemplated how to do this. Because at least so far, he was not in any mood to engage in these sorts of gay affairs. &quot;Alright.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright what?&quot; Gabe leaned forward, flush in the face, suddenly feeling a spike of excitement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here&#39;s how we&#39;re doing this. I&#39;ll take a blowie from you. Nothing else. I don&#39;t want your dick on me. If you wanna get sexual with Jackson White, this is how we&#39;re doing it.&quot; Jackson said with a small smile.<br />
<br />
Gabe for his part was very much still up for it. He looked around and said, &quot;Alright...Alright! We&#39;re good to go then! Let&#39;s uh, use the backyard.&quot; Gabe let Jackson lead the way out there, following behind in short order. As he took in the look of Jackson, awkwardly smiling and getting ready, Gabe realized he had never really done anything like this before in his life.<br />
<br />
He heard the sound of Jackson&#39;s jeans being unzipped, and Gabe&#39;s eyes immediately went to Jackson&#39;s organ. It looked distinctly larger than it had before. He remembered somehow that Jackson had a pretty nice dick, but this was longer and larger girth wise than he remembered. Gabe could almost salivate. The twinkish man shook his head, &quot;O-Okay, uh, just cuz I&#39;m like, into you...that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m gay, okay? Just...just doing this to deal with intrusive gay thoughts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabe didn&#39;t know how true any of that he was saying even was any more.<br />
<br />
Jackson ran a hand through his hair again and noted some difference, wondering if he needed to switch up his shampoo brand, &quot;Whatever you say bro. Let&#39;s get this underway before anyone sees.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jackson near immediately let out a low moan as he felt Gabe kneel down and take his manhood into his mouth. The smaller man was doing it really nicely. Almost as good as Sasha&#39;s blowjobs. Jackson grit his teeth and tried to keep his demeanor stoic and not exaggerated. If anyone saw just his upper body he had to look decent at least. Gabe was down there giving it his all and Jackson at least respected him for not half-assing it. Fuck did this guy watch a billion pornos to prepare for this...?<br />
<br />
Jackson grunted, &quot;Fuck you can blow really good, dude.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabe for his part was almost overwhelmed by the way Jackson tasted, the way this all felt to him, the sheer reality of what he was doing. He could almost forget the fact he and Terry were supposed to be just working off their needs. That this wasn&#39;t their reality. That Terry and he were actually studmuffins who fucked girls. They just needed, right now, to fuck guys in order to just...get this dealt with. Everyone had their method of catharsis, Gabe told himself. And it&#39;d take more...than one BJ...to make Gabe turn...gay...!<br />
<br />
Jackson started lightly thrusting his hips into Gabe&#39;s receptive mouth, eagerly feeling the guy&#39;s tongue around his manhood. He wasn&#39;t really into guys though, so outside of the occasional look down he didn&#39;t pay much attention there. He felt his back flex and pulse a little, and Jackson wondered if his workouts lately were really gonna be showing. His muscles were tight today, and he could really feel everything flexing and---fuck, it was almost like he could feel himself growing...<br />
<br />
Jackson grunted and bit his lip, feeling his orgasm coming up on him, &quot;Gonna cum...!&quot; He didn&#39;t say much more than that.<br />
<br />
Gabe for his part let Jackson cum on his face, and feeling the liquid rain down on him like that, he wondered how true it even was. The fact he was &quot;just trying to sublimate his urges&quot; or whatever. Maybe he needed to talk some more with Terry about it. Reinforce what he was meaning earlier. Jackson for his part zipped back up soon after...<br />
<br />
...And went back inside to get Gabe a piece of paper towel for his face. &quot;Here ya go.&quot; Was there something...different about Jackson&#39;s face? His body? Gabe swore there was something slightly off. Not much, but enough to be noticed by someone like him. He shook his head lightly and took the towel, thanking Jackson for it.<br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
Upstairs, shortly after, as Gabe heard Jackson return in to talk to the other guys some more about football team history, as if nothing happened, Gabe tried to find Terry. And he succeeded. Seeing Terry wobbling a little bit as he walked out of the bathroom. Had he showered or something? Gabe approached Terry, wondering what was going on. &quot;Hey man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey~ Gabey, how&#39;re you doin&#39; tonight?&quot; Terry seemed giggly and boisterous like earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, dude...so...like what you said earlier...&quot; Gabe asked, trying to make Terry remember that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like...&quot; It seemed to take Terry a moment to think about it, and he snapped his fingers when he did, &quot;Oh yeah, the catharsis, like, hooking up just to deal with the gay thoughts thing. Right. Riiiight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, how&#39;s it going? I mean, are you feeling like you&#39;re back to normal old Terry?&quot; Gabe asked, feeling worried. Why the hell was he feeling this emotional about this thing?<br />
<br />
Terry answered in an odd way, &quot;Uhh, sure! Sure! Yeah, it&#39;ll take more than a romp in the hay to keep Terry gay.&quot; He winked at Gabe, more for show than anything else. Gabe of course missed the feeling in that that Terry was more saying that just for Gabe&#39;s benefit emotionally than any actual belief in it. &quot;How&#39;d you do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I uh, I got with Jackson. He only wanted a blowjob though.&quot; Gabe said as he leaned against the upstairs wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s no good.&quot; Terry said with a frown, &quot;Can&#39;t well bang out the gay thoughts if you&#39;re stuck doing BJ duties. Hm! I got an idea. I&#39;m feeling kinda like I got some gay thoughts coming on. How about we help each other deal? Sound good?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I dunno man. I was good with that but...it really does feel like,&quot; Gabe fretted, &quot;Like we&#39;re changing somehow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, we&#39;re not changing at all.&quot; Terry grinned and started leading Gabe into the bathroom to have some one on one time with him. Maybe that could clear some things up.</p>
