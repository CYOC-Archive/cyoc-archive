<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With the intercourse over, the make human dog got of the back of Tracy and licked his penis clean before wandering off. As for Tracy, she was still in a daze afterwards from the session she just had and her mind took a second to readjust.<br />
<br />
It took about a minute for Tract to get her thoughts back into place. The mating was intense and Tracy find her thoughts wondering if she was impregnated or not. Even though she was completely naked and had just had an orgy, she saw no qualms about it. In fact she relished it as she felt more free when doing it.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was wonderful, but what was I thinking about before that stud took me. Oh that&#39;s right, I was heading out of here.&quot; Tracy thought as she started walking away, her tail wagging as she was over the moon.<br />
<br />
She was walking along the marble floor passing by other human dogs on the way out. Some of them were mating just like she did previously while other were playing around with various bits of scattered clothing. A part of her wanted to join in but she needed to leave the mall for some reason, yet a part of her mind was wondering what for.<br />
<br />
As she was exiting through the automatic doors, she passed by a group of three horny and huge male human-dogs. Luckily they weren&#39;t interested in her as she still had the musk from the other human-dog on her. As for who they were interested in, they were cornering three really small Asian female human-dogs which looked scared but in heat at the same time. Tracy looked at them and glared with envy as they would be bearing the off spring of three huge males, but atleast she mated so she will have off spring to look after.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Tracy got to her destination. She currently sat down on the tarmac with her tail wagging behind her as she looked up at the huge metal box. It looked familiar to Tracy yet different somehow. Maybe it was her den, yet it couldn&#39;t be, could it?<br />
<br />
&quot;Why am I here again? Oh maybe it&#39;s a spot I like to pee on, I do feel like I need to go.&quot; Was what Tracy was thinking.<br />
<br />
Lifting her back right leg up, she began to urinate on the round black thing the box was sitting on. Tracy felt in a natural bliss from doing this, but somewhere deep down, this was wrong to her. That part of her mind was getting weaker though and it wasn&#39;t noticeable at all by Tracy.<br />
<br />
Although another reason Tracy didn&#39;t notice was that her urination was cut off by a loud noise coming from behind her. Turning around to see who it was, Tracy caught the glimpse of a tall creature running towards were, screaming and making noises.<br />
<br />
Tracy backed off from the figure and hid in the bushes close to the metallic boxes. Looking over at the humanoid figure, Tracy managed to see what it was. <br />
<br />
It was a furry creature with large ears on the top of its head and had clothes on its body. It was wearing black things on its feet that Tracy couldn&#39;t figure out what they were despite wearing something similar earlier that day. Tracy wondered if it was male or female but looking at the two large mounds on its chest covered by a white shirt, her mind was telling her it was a female.<br />
<br />
&quot;God damn stray human-dogs. I hate how they will just urinate over my car like that. I hope the authorities round all them up and train them to be good animals. I can&#39;t believe I used to be like that before I lacked a developed brain.&quot; The female figure said to herself.<br />
<br />
Tracy could understand what the figure was saying but didn&#39;t know what it was she was hearing. Tracy thought about it and started thinking about some of the words said but some of them she didn&#39;t understand. She recognised the human-dogs and urinate, but what&#39;s a car. If she didn&#39;t know it, then it&#39;s not important was her reasoning.<br />
<br />
Amidst her thoughts, she failed to realise that the female figure got into the box and started making a noise. It was a loud and scary noise and Tracy started to whimper from it. Eventually the noise was gone and the metallic box was no where to be seen.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that noise? It was so scary and even that female thing was scary. It towered over me and even lacked a tail, how could anything not have a tail. I&#39;ve got a beautiful tail, one that attracts mates. What does that female have, two mounds which I happily don&#39;t have anymore.&quot; Tracy was arguing to no one but her mind.<br />
<br />
If Tracy wasn&#39;t having her mind degrade, she would&#39;ve known was the female was. The tall humanoid figure was what the old dogs had become. The old dogs, who were now dognoids (mix of dog and humanoid), had started to gain awareness and intelligence and had bodies similar to that of the old humans. They lack a tail and have feature that humans used to have, although they still have the same heads fur and ears, everything else is more like an old human including the females having breasts and intercourse being more like a humans.<br />
<br />
Dognoids also still they have memories of being domestic animals, albeit they would soon forget their old lives like Tracy is. While Tracy would be a dumb human-dog, the dognoids will have a developed society. Neither party minded however, ir they wouldn&#39;t even realise it&#39;s happening or be able to stop it.<br />
<br />
Going back to reality, Tracy wondered what to do next as the thing she was heading to was now gone. Maybe she could try to find her previous mate and form a pack of human-dogs with him. Maybe she could try to be taken in by on of the figures she saw previously? What happens next.</p>
