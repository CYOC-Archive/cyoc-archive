<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Somewhere in a microverse of impossible terror, Mark struggled to come to grips with the fact that he was standing on the seat of his chair, which was now the size of an entire small town to him. A vast landscape of cheap leather. He could even make out rolling hills from where his ass had creased the cushion after all these years. He did the only thing his unimaginative macho mind could let him do. He passed out and fainted dead away.<br />
<br />
* * *<br />
<br />
Ty stood next to June. Tall, imposing, wine drinking June. More concerned about how she looked to her group of housewives than anything else in the world. Secretly embarassed by her husband and tired of her dull suburban life. Never actually cruel to Ty, but careless and without remorse. She had used him as a plaything for her own ends, messing with him, manipulating him, stringing him along like a puppet. Ty was about to return the favor.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are no strings on me.&quot; Ty said. In his invisible and ghostlike state it was impossible to see, but he had a sudden revelation. &quot;June, you&#39;re now my living toy.&quot; He said firmly, and willed it to pass gradually.<br />
<br />
Upstairs, Dustin was in his room playing COD, Ty could hear the dull roar of video game gunfire.<br />
<br />
As she finished the dishes and put the last of them on the drying rack, June twinged slightly. Momentarily caught off guard, she staggered slightly and grabbed her head. &quot;Ohhh... what the fuck?&quot; She cursed. She looked around for Mark one more time and sighed heavily. &quot;Enough of this shit. I need a drink.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty watched as she walked over to the wine cabinet in the dining area, and he watched as June&#39;s skin started to take on a strange sheen. At first, he thought she was sweating all over. He drew close, allowing himself to feel her, and marvelled as he realized the sheen was because she was becoming plastic. June started feeling stranger and stranger, her brunette ponytail began to fray and turn straggly as it turned to cheap horse hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa.&quot; June staggered again. She heard a loud snap and felt strange coolness overtake her body. Puzzled, she looked down and saw the strange light reflecting sheen that covered her arms. She felt stiffer. Heavier. Yet strangely hollow. Confused, she touched her arm and felt... nothing. She had gone completely numb. Another loud snap. Her eyes widened as she witnessed a seam appear around her wrist. Followed by the other. Gasping, she staggered back from the wine cabinet and fell backwards into the table and then the floor. She tried to stand up and felt stiffer and stiffer by the second. Crying out, she watched in disbelief as her fingers suddenly pulled straight up and refused to move anymore. She screamed in terror as her fingers melded together, lost definition, and became a single plastic paddle. Another crack and then another, her wrist joints seperated and turned into two doll-like ball joints.<br />
<br />
Screaming, desperately trying to stand to run for help, June was helpless against her transformation. Her hands gone, now her arms began to crackle as two more ball joints appeared and snapped as she moved, seperating her lower arm from her upper arm at the elbow and remaining a toy joint. She realized why she felt so stiff, observing her skin fully hardening into toy plastic, and let out a muffled cry as her mouth closed itself forever and her voice faded. It was getting harder and harder to move, she felt stiffer and stiffer, and the crackling and popping of her hardening plastic body was met with fresh horrors as all around her she turned to a living doll, her bending points turning to toy joints, her body losing outward definition and simplifying. She lost her pussy, her nipples, and most of her details. Her hair faded except for her head, her flesh plastic body struggled to move, her toes vanished and turned to the same simple paddles as her hands.<br />
<br />
Still, June was moving and alive. Her face locked into a neutral and even expression and though she could still see and hear fine, no other movement was possible. This lead to the strange adjustment of no longer being able to move her eyes. She had to move her whole head, rotating on an immobile fixed neck, and to her fresh shock she realized she could spin her head around entirely now. She looked over herself, felt the hardening reaching its conclusion, and without voice or sound, the living doll woman eerily stood, shakily, on her new joints and imprecise feet and tried to regain balance. She failed, clattering to her knees noisily, but stubbornly refused to give up.<br />
<br />
Finally, as she braced herself against the cabinet behind her, she rose to her full 6&#39; height and stared at herself in utter horror. Unable to speak, blink, or express in any way, the living doll stared at her reflection in the glass and reeled.<br />
<br />
Ty stared at morbid fascination as his new form for June came to pass. It was delightfully horrifying, he smiled, as he willed her to shrink to doll size.<br />
<br />
June staggered again and awkwardly pulled away from the cabinet, zombie-walking with clattering feet toward the counter. Already, she was smaller, her dress hanging down to her feet, and soon enough she tripped over the dress and fell to her knees again with the clatter of plastic hitting the floor. She shrank and shrank, watching the countertop grow higher above her perspective. She untangled herself from her dress and emerged from her oversized clothing as a jointed living shrinking doll. Jointed at the wrists, elbows, waist, hips, knees, and ankles, her lifeless expressionless body was something to behold in all its horror as it shrank and shrank. She stood up, reaching for the top of the counter, and watched as her hands slid down the cabinet as she shrank down. Approximating pure rage, the doll woman kicked the cupboard and threw a silent tantrum, flailing and hitting the giant cupboard door, chipping it slightly with her digitless glove hands, as she shrank to no more than twelve inches in height.<br />
<br />
Ty stared at the pathetic living doll woman and smiled in satisfaction. June, of course, couldn&#39;t see or sense him, with what little senses she had left, and was equally startled as she began to rise into the air by Ty&#39;s unseen hand. The doll flailed her limbs and looked around in terror as she floated through the air.<br />
<br />
Having finished examining her, Ty set the doll down on the kitchen floor and smiled as she staggered and tried to regain her footing, only to fall on her plastic ass with a click against the tile floor.<br />
<br />
Ty&#39;s excitement grew as he heard Dustin begin moving upstairs. No doubt he was coming down for a snack.</p>
