<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty chatted amicably between the two musclefreak kids, unable to keep himself from gawking at their unbelievable size. They would laugh when they caught his eyes drifting towards their insanely developed muscles, but it was all in good fun. They offered to let Ty feel them up here and there, giggling as he became mesmerized by the sheer mass they built. At least, that’s what they remembered in this reality.<br />
<br />
“Wow, just look at those insane quads!” Ty gasped. Kaiden grinned and shook his leg, the cords of muscle wobbling obscenely before snapping into place as he flexed them, growling. It was no surprise that the owner of this body before the head swap never skipped leg day; each head of the quadriceps bulged in stark relief of each other, and each leg was thicker than Ty’s waist! It was also telling of the previous owner for his choice in clothes: the leggings appeared skin-tight as Kaiden put on a show for his new friend. Yet he didn’t seem to mind in the slightest, his face turning red as he huffed and puffed between poses. His glutes seemed to hog almost all the available space left around the hips, leaving nothing to the imagination. <br />
<br />
It was then that Ty noticed something else. With a silent wish, Ty confirmed that while James would have won best-in-show for those bull-like legs, his manhood was anything but. Standing erect at 2.5 inches and shriveled balls to match, Ty concluded James once went a little overboard with his cycle to compensate his lack of size, and had granted Kaiden with a pitiful bait and tackle. This was probably for the better, Ty surmised; since this giant kid was going to go through puberty in a few years anyway… Imagine if he went through that with a fully grown set! Ty gulped. He couldn’t help but be turned on by the thought. He could easily wish to fix Kaiden now, but he didn’t want to cause a bigger scene. He made a mental note for later, though.<br />
<br />
Just as Ty had an idea to check Kyle, another large hand rested on his shoulder as a deep rumbling voice spoke. “You aren’t causing trouble for my kids, are you, son?” Ty was taken aback as he looked up at the hirsute giant looming behind him. <br />
<br />
“Uh, no sir.”<br />
<br />
“Daddy!” Kaiden squealed. “Dad!” Kyle echoed. They rushed over to hug their father, smothering him in a muscle sandwich. Ty watched in bemusement as the man he found intimidating 2 seconds ago was reduced to a disgruntled teddy bear.<br />
<br />
“Boys, boys. Squeeze any harder and daddy might pop.” He wheezed. The kids slowly untangled and the man breathed a sigh of relief. Ty was able to get a better look at the man and was surprised to find that he was somewhere between both his children’s size and not larger: 6’3” and 260 lb of off-season muscle. His turtle shell gut attested to that, stretching his ratty gym tank far beyond his sizable pecs. He had the look of a retired bodybuilder who turned his career towards coaching.<br />
<br />
“This is Ty, he’s our new friend!” Kyle beamed.<br />
<br />
“Yea! He’s nice!” Kaiden added.<br />
<br />
“Is that so? Well it’s nice to meet you, Ty.” The man smiled apologetically and brought his hand out to shake. Ty accepted and mentally thanked himself for not wishing anything hasty in his brief panic. The man’s hand was firm but warm, calloused yet somehow also tender. “I’m Sean.”<br />
<br />
———<br />
<br />
While the children animatedly discussed what games to play with each other, their dad chatted with Ty. He explained that they finished their workout at the mall’s gym before he did and whined about being hungry, so he gave them some cash to stuff themselves at the food court. “They’re growing boys after all, haha!” He guffawed, reaching up to ruffle Kaiden’s hair. Kaiden playfully batted the hand away and stuck his tongue out.<br />
<br />
Kyle looked over. “Hey dad, can we get ice cream?”<br />
<br />
“Yea can we?”<br />
<br />
The man dramatically sighed and pulled out his wallet. “Alright, but only because you behaved yourselves at the gym today.” He turned to Ty. “Would you like an ice cream? My treat.”<br />
<br />
“Ah, no thank you.” Ty replied.<br />
<br />
“Suit yourself.” He handed some change to his boys and they bounded off, Kaden almost waddling with his humongous legs fighting for space.<br />
<br />
“Look at him. Only four and he’s almost taller than me. And Kyle’s probably gonna reach seven feet and twice my competition weight in a few years. What am I going to do with these boys...” Sean grew somber after that remark. “I’m sorry if I scared ya earlier, Ty. Kyle and Kaden mean everything to me. They’re all I have.”<br />
<br />
“What about their mom?” Ty asked in a hushed whisper.<br />
<br />
“Up and left us about two years ago. Couldn’t stand the idea of being a mother of freaks.” He grimaced, looking down at his clasped hands. Ty wished Sean would tell him more. <br />
<br />
“She was something of an Amazon herself, and thought Kyle’s growth was just a fluke. Though she never said it, I think she blamed me for his bodybuilding obsession. She just wanted to raise a normal kid. But after Kaiden was born, she wasn’t the same. Sorry, I don’t know why I’m suddenly telling a teenager I just met all this.” He covered his face in his palms.<br />
<br />
Ty put a hand on Sean’s arm. “And I’m sorry for sounding presumptuous, but she doesn’t sound like a great mom if she couldn’t love her family for who they are. But you… Raising a kid is already a lot; doing it yourself? With two giant muscle boys? I’d say you’re doing just fine. Just look at how happy they are with you. Even I could see how much they really love you.”<br />
<br />
The man was silent for a moment and Ty worried if he overstepped boundaries. Then, Sean sniffed and wiped his eyes before resting his hands on the table again. “Thanks, son. I really needed to hear that.” <br />
<br />
“I just wish I could keep up with those tykes. My body’s not what it used to be. Pretty soon Kyle will be benching my max weight for reps, and Kaiden’s already squatting heavier than me. Having some help around the house would also be nice… But knowing they have a kind friend like you is more than anything I could ask for.” He smiled gingerly.<br />
<br />
Ty had an idea. He wished…</p>
