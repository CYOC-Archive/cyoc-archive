<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Is this self pleasure? Is this M/M?  What a strange situation we find ourselves in.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nathan drummed the fingers of his free hand on the edge of the keyboard, barely able to contain his excitement. He wanted to carry on changing his friend, but a small part of him was getting turned on by Jake’s impotent resistance. Maybe he should just turn Jake further into a cock? Maybe he should make the world forget about him? His mind raced with idea after idea as he scrolled through the options, inspiration building up in layer upon layer, only to collapse with a distracting pleasurable twinge, radiating out from his groin. He stopped everything, feeling his body with his mind’s eye.<br />
<br />
Jake had touched something with his tiny paw, as he explored the contours of his chin, something that made Jake freeze on the spot. It was only mild, so small and so vague it was hard to comprehend, but it felt good nonetheless, and so Jake explored on, hoping to find it again. It never occurred to him that it was the exploratory touching itself that was causing the cock-cat to feel so nice, and it soon started to transform into something more self-gratifying. <br />
<br />
To Nathan, it was the hand job of a lifetime, which he decided to let slide, to just let it happen. But, without warning, it all came to an end as a semi-erect jake flopped out of Nathan’s sheath.<br />
<br />
“Woah,” Nathan said, as he lifted the laptop off Jake, “what are…”<br />
<br />
Jake couldn’t see Nathan’s dark smile, but Nathabn could see Jake’s tiny face, as it began to flush up. It wasn’t clear if it was arousal, embarrassment, probably both. <br />
<br />
“I was just testing things out!” Jake blurted, waving his hand, trying not to look up at the panting dogboy looming over him. “If I am gonna be stuck like this I want to at least get to know my limits.”<br />
<br />
Nathan chuckled, his eyes glancing between Jake and his information on the Chronivac. In the brief scramble Nathan’s thumb had nudged Jake’s sensitivity up a notch, to one hundred and ten percent, but the changes remained unactualized. This horniness was all Jake, but it needn’t be for long. He pulled a sly grin, and hit submit in secret.<br />
<br />
“That’s okay, Jake,” He said, settling back down, “I would do it too.”<br />
<br />
As he settled Nathan put a hand on Jake, for the first time since they peed together, and held Jake up, playing with his semi. “Though be careful, look how sensitive you are.”<br />
<br />
The sensation of being caressed in massive paws cut through Jake like a warm knife through warm butter. He tingled and twitched, heat and pressure rising as his once-pliable flesh hardened, overcoming Jake’s mid for a brief moment. He stuttered, eyes half-closed, as he looked up at the horny, dominant, sexy… <br />
<br />
He shook it off, pushing the paw away.<br />
<br />
“Cut it out.” Jake said, glowering at his friend. “I said you can’t use me to masterbate!” <br />
<br />
“But you can masturbate yourself?” Nathan laughed, as Jake shook his head. He always looked cute when he was embarrassed, now he was a tiny cat-person too… <br />
<br />
“ACCIDENTALLY, and I will be the one to get us soft again.” Jake’s words stumbled as they fell from his mouth. “Get ME soft again! Or get unaroused! Or whatever, just let me deal with it.”<br />
<br />
Jaked closed his eyes and took a mock-breath, focusing on windswept forests, notes from an engineering course, walking his childhood dog… <br />
<br />
Jake throbbed, twitching harder for a moment..<br />
<br />
“What was that?” Nathan laughed, jostling his cock with his hips. <br />
<br />
“I’m thinking unsexy thoughts and got distracted. You should do it too.”<br />
<br />
Nathan watched, awhing in silence as the kitty scrunched it&#39;s face in frustration. It didn’t matter, he could wait Jake out.<br />
<br />
Moments later, as his attention drifted back to the Chronivac, Nathan’s mind was struck with the errant thought of walking in nature, his cat-shaped cock out and hard, the two of them pursuing a wide-assed deer girl.<br />
<br />
Jake twitched again.<br />
<br />
“Damnit!” Jake yelled, as Nathan laughed again. “It&#39;s so hard to focus!”<br />
<br />
“That time might have been me,” Nathan admitted, “had a sexy thought about some girl in a forest.”<br />
<br />
Jake’s eyes shot up, looking at Nathan. “A deer girl?”<br />
<br />
They shared a look, Worried about the implications of a shared day dream. Jake especially wondered, as the mental image of the deer girl reinvaded their minds, the creature spreading her legs before them.<br />
<br />
Twitch.<br />
<br />
Jake stressed, Nathan laughed, and the two tried not to think about the implications. Jake chastised his friend, crossing his arms (a bizarre sensation for Nathan) as he looked away; an adorable little tantrum. Nathan, awhing silently again, tried to give Jake a reassuring pat with a finger, Jake, seeing the paw coming, tried to dismiss it, trying to push the land away with his head.<br />
<br />
A shiver of pleasure cascaded through their body, the cock alive with sensitivity. Something surged at the base of Jake’s being, and it would have spilled out if Jake hadn’t caught it. There was a new kind of liquid buildup, somewhere at the lower limits of Jake’s new body, and holding it back felt like a balancing act.<br />
<br />
Nathan suppressed his darkening smile. They both paused for a moment, motionless, before let out a preformative Nathan sigh.<br />
<br />
“Look man, I know you probably don’t wanna hear this, and you are gonna hate me for saying it, but we both know where we are at right now.” Jake looked up at his companion, his stern look faltering at the sight of the colossal sexy beast. “You don’t want to be used like that, but neither of us is gonna get any rest without addressing this, and there really is only one way.”<br />
<br />
He could feel it stirring deep within him, a gland throbbing at the base of his body, something wanting to escape up the urethra, and - somehow - suppressing it made him cough a little. It distracted him enough that he didn’t see Nathan up his sensitivity to two hundred percent, and his dominance down ten percent.<br />
<br />
“How about we just try it for a bi-i-it?” Nathan said, the sensitivity surging the ambient horniness, making his words stutter. Jake struggled for control, but his stony expression melted further as his eyes flickering half closed. He was trying to hold it back, trying to focus on anything but the present, but his willpower was already running low. He tried to say something, but his words turned into a cough in his mouth, as the pressure build surged and subsided.<br />
<br />
“I’m g-going to have to try either way.” Nathan said, feeling his heavy heartbeat through his cock, as Jake slid into full erectness, standing up, eyes now closed in concentration. The pressure was on the edge, Jake standing on a powder keg. “Just give me a yes,” he said, prodding the side of Jake’s cheek with his thumb, “and we-we can get this over…”<br />
<br />
The prodding was too much, and seconds later Jake&#39;s eyes and mouth pinned open, his body twitching, coughing, as precum dribbled out of his mouth. It was a slow torrent, the liquid thick, viscous, and deliciously salty. <br />
<br />
No matter what, things were going to get weird.</p>
