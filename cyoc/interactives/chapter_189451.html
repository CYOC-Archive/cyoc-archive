<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sure enough it was Michael and Kerry. Kerry was carrying a small suitcase when Kate opened the door. “Good morning Kate. I packed everything I might have needed if I was going away for a weekend”<br />
<br />
Michael gave Kate a ‘Good morning’ embrace. “Where is the new woman anyway?”<br />
<br />
“Still in the shower. We slept in a bit” replied Kate. She wasn&#39;t going to admit what they actually had been doing.<br />
<br />
“So no change?” Michael didn’t need to elaborate further. <br />
<br />
“We haven’t tried anything yet. I want to do our research first and make sure we don’t make the situation worse”<br />
<br />
“I started doing an internet search while Kerry was grabbing clothes. I’ve found a couple of leads. If you could give me your wi-fi I’ll keep going” Michael showed the tablet in his hands.<br />
<br />
“While you’re doing that I show Tom what I’ve bought” suggested Kerry. Without waiting for a reply she headed to the master bedroom where they could hear the shower was still running. Tom had been in there for a long time. Kate suspected he had once more been distracted by his new body.<br />
<br />
Kate began to set Tom up at the breakfast table and helped him connect to the wi-fi. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile Kerry had knocked on the ensuite door when she heard the shower stop “Tom. It’s Kerry. I need to talk to you in private” <br />
<br />
“Hi Kerry. Give me a minute. I’ve just got out of the shower” Kerry heard her own voice from behind the door.<br />
<br />
“I’ll wait” she sat on the bed. Kate had tidied the room. Kerry noticed the red socks on Kate’s dressing table.<br />
<br />
A minute later Tom opened the door slightly “Hi Kerry. Can it wait until I’m dressed?”<br />
<br />
“Probably best we talk first” Kerry suggested.<br />
<br />
“Well could you pass me a robe. I only have towels and I don’t know how to cover this body properly. There should be a dressing gown in the wardrobe” he pointed to his side of the wardrobe. The only clothes he had in the bathroom was the bridesmaids dress and he didn’t want to put that back on while Kerry and Michael were present.<br />
<br />
“Sure” Kerry opened the wardrobe and immediately saw Kate’s white cotton bath robe. She took that to the door and passed it to Tom. Tom hesitated on seeing what Kerry had passed him. He thought about telling her to take it back and instead find his bigger grey dressing gown which he had wanted her to collect. Then he changed his mind. It was Kerry’s body he had. There was no point hiding anything from her. He closed the door and put the robe on.<br />
<br />
He reappeared wrapped in the robe. Kerry again did a double take seeing her brother-in-law’s head on a woman’s body. “What’s so important?”<br />
<br />
“Well I bought some clothes you might like to wear and another suggestion. I think you should wear a pad” <br />
<br />
“A pad?”<br />
<br />
“A sanitary pad. I’m sorry Tom but it’s really unfortunate timing. I stopped taking the pill 2 weeks ago because we are wanting to start a family. I’m expecting a period to start at any time and since you have my body I’m guessing you will menstruate at the same time I do”<br />
<br />
“Shit! I’m not pregnant am I?”<br />
<br />
“No you’re definitely not pregnant. We haven’t actually started trying yet” she didn’t elaborate further. “Hopefully you have your own body back before anything does happen but I’m getting indications and well you don’t want to be caught without a pad when the bleeding starts” <br />
<br />
“What sort of indications do you get?”<br />
<br />
“My breasts get tender and I feel bloated. I’m feeling like that this morning” That got Tom worried. His breasts were tender as well. He had assumed it was from the fondling they had endured.<br />
<br />
Once Michael was set up Kate went to the bedroom to find out how Tom and Kerry were getting on. The door was closed. Kate knocked then opened the door. She found Kerry and Tom sitting beside each other on the bed. Tom was wearing her bathrobe.<br />
<br />
“Shut the door and come in. You probably need to know this as well” said Kerry. At least it was Kerry’s voice. <br />
<br />
“Michael doesn’t need to know” said Tom, also with Kerry’s voice.<br />
<br />
“I think my period is about to start. I was suggesting to Tom that he wears a pad. I bought some” said Kerry. She pointed at the suitcase, now on the floor.<br />
<br />
Kate couldn’t stifle the giggle that erupted from her throat.<br />
 <br />
“It’s not funny Kate” Tom protested.<br />
<br />
“Sorry. I couldn’t help it. We had better get you dressed. Kate said she bought some clothes that should fit you. Let’s see what choices you have” Kate lifted the small suitcase to the bed.<br />
 <br />
Tom watched as Kerry unpacked the contents and showed them to Kate. He was happy to see Kerry had bought along two pairs of jeans, and a couple of long-sleeved shirts. Also in the case were the aforementioned pads, some sneakers and two sets of matching bra’s and panties. “The undies are brand new. I haven’t worn them myself yet. I only bought them on Thursday” <br />
<br />
“I don’t think I’ll need a bra” suggested Tom. They were not plain bra’s. They were lacy. One set was white but the other was pale blue.<br />
 <br />
“Of course you will need a bra” scoffed Kate “Otherwise you’ll bounce all over the place”<br />
<br />
“I’d recommend you wear one” seconded Kerry. “You will find the support very welcome”<br />
<br />
Tom was out voted. At least he got to choose the jeans and shirt. He chose the blue jeans and a pale blue checked shirt. “Good choice” suggested Kate. Then to Kerry she said. “Thanks for that Kerry. We are very grateful. I’ll help Tom get dressed”<br />
<br />
Kerry took the hint and left.<br />
<br />
Alone with her feminised husband Kate handed him the blue bra and panty set. “Put these on. The colour co-ordinates with the shirt you chose, then I’ll show you how to put the pad in” Indeed Tom needed help with the bra as well. Kate showed him how to reverse the garment in order to do up the straps. She then showed Tom how the pads had a sticky side and how to put them into his panties. To Tom it felt like wearing a nappy. However once it was in place he had to admit it wasn&#39;t very noticeable. He still had a very flat crotch.<br />
<br />
As for the bra. It certainly felt different and stopped a lot of the breast wobble. It also lifted his breasts and enhanced his cleavage. Kate also reassured him that “The bra will help redistribute the weight of your breasts. Not that I hope it’s the case but if your still wearing it by the end of the day you will appreciate that”<br />
<br />
He then put the jeans on. They were a much tighter fit than he was used to. They did not hide his new curves at all. Kate handed him a belt to wear with it. He didn’t think he needed a belt as his hips were so wide and his waist so narrow that there was no way the jeans could fall down, however Kate was pretty insistent and he had no real objection. He put it on anyway. <br />
 <br />
The shirt seemed normal enough except the buttons were on the wrong side and too late he realised the cuffs had a floral pattern on them. At least once he did the buttons up his cleavage was hidden. Lastly he put socks and Kerry’s sneakers on. The shoes fitted him perfectly.</p>
