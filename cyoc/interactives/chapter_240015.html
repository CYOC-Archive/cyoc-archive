<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I can’t talk for both of us,” Quinn says after a while, “but, I personally would like to learn more about you two and the realm you guys pulled us into”.<br />
<br />
Azrael nods in agreement, “same here”.<br />
<br />
Jeff and Dennis look at each other, they then turn and smile at Quinn and Azrael, “well, we do owe you more information about us and your new home dimension,” Jeff says, “I guess I’ll start with myself, since it was my idea to extract you from the comic”.<br />
<br />
Quinn and Azrael sit down on Dennis’s bed, “okay, we are all ears,” they say.<br />
<br />
Jeff and Dennis sit down themselves opposite of the wolf-boy and lizard-bot on two large bean bags.<br />
<br />
“So, my full name is Jeff Davis, I have a younger brother “Riley Davis” who is 12,” Jeff starts, “my father is a lawyer and my mom is a teacher at Riley’s school, she teaches math”.<br />
<br />
“And how did you two meet,” Azrael asks, “do you visit the same school?”<br />
<br />
Jeff shakes his head, looking over at Dennis, “we just met today,” he starts, “I visited a horse race, and Dennis here competed in the race, but his horse got injured. So, when I noticed him and his sad expression, I offered to transform myself into a horse so he could take part in the race”.<br />
<br />
Quinn’s eyes widen, while Azreal tilts his head, “really? I assume you used that app of yours?”<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “Dennis didn’t believe it,” he says, grinning at the other teen, “he was surprised to say the least, watching me transform”.<br />
<br />
Dennis nods, “you can say that again,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Anyway, long story short,” Jeff continues, “after transforming into a horse, I made sure that Dennis won the race”.<br />
<br />
Dennis smiles, “and I am still so happy,” he says, “it’s been my first race!”<br />
<br />
Quinn and Azrael smile, “sounds like you are one kind guy, Jeff,” Quinn says.<br />
<br />
“With a big heart,” Azrael adds.<br />
<br />
Jeff rubs the back of his neck sheepishly, “he… I just can’t stand seeing someone upset or unhappy,” he says.<br />
<br />
“I’m the same,” Quinn says, “I hate seeing people unhappy, and it makes me happy when I’m able to help them”.<br />
<br />
“Same here,” Azrael says, smiling, “why did you choose me, Jeff? I mean… I’m just a robot”.<br />
<br />
Jeff smiles, “because, Azrael,” Jeff says, “I love reptiles, and robots, I’m especially fascinated by sentient robots, robots that are able to think for themselves”.<br />
<br />
Azrael looks down at his shiny chrome body, the lizard-bot letting out a sigh, “being a robot is okay, I guess,” he says, “it has its ups and downs. Though I honestly would prefer being a living person”.<br />
<br />
“Being a living person isn’t as fun as you think,” Jeff says, “you have responsibilities, you need to eat and drink to survive, so, being a robot is so much easier and cooler”.<br />
<br />
Azreal shrugs, “still, I’d like to at least look less like a machine,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Well, I could use the app to give you a “skin”, which will feel like real skin, or rather scales,” Jeff says, “I could also give you genitals, and also give your nanobots the ability to impregnate females, also, since you are a robot, I doubt you are able to feel touches, warmth and cold, right?”<br />
<br />
Azrael nod, “that is correct,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jeff smiles, “well, I’ll use the app on you,” he says, “after I have scanned you, I’ll be able to give you not only a “skin”, which will be made of silicone, you’ll be able to choose what color your scales should be. Also, I’ll add sensors, which will give you the ability to feel when someone touches you, warmth and cold. You be just like a normal living person, only that your “skeleton” will be made of metal”.<br />
<br />
Azrael stares at Jeff, “you… you’d really do that for me,” he asks.<br />
<br />
“Sure,” Jeff says, “if it will make you happy”.<br />
<br />
“Do it,” Azrael says.<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “alrighty,” he says, “hold still,” he then scans the lizard-bot, then opens the file, “okay, what color should your scales be?”<br />
<br />
“Blue and white,” Azrael says, “I want my main scales to be blue, like the sky, the scales on my snout, chest, tummy, crotch and underside of my tail, I want those to be white”.<br />
<br />
“Alright,” Jeff says, “would you like to have ears, which you’d be able to move around?”<br />
<br />
“A lizard with ears,” Azrael asks, “nah… I’m good!”<br />
<br />
“Okay, then let me set this up,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
Jeff quickly types the changes into the app and confirms them, Azrael looks down at himself, gasping, as he watches as blue and white scales spread over his metallic body, he grins when he notices a genital slit, and his grin widens even more when he feels a cock tucked away insde his slit. The lizard-bot then feels new sensors activate inside of him and a smile appears on his face, “it… feels so good to finally be able to feel,” he says, “and I look amazing, thanks Jeff!”<br />
<br />
Jeff smiles, “my pleasure, Azrael,” he says, “anything else you’d like to know?”<br />
<br />
“What was it like being a horse,” Azrael asks, still looking at himself and stroking over his new “skin”, enjoying the feeling of his soft scales.<br />
<br />
“It was weird,” Jeff says, “but I kind of liked it, I felt strong and powerful!”<br />
<br />
“Would you transform into a horse again,” Quinn asks.<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “I promised Dennis that, whenever he needs a replacement horse, I’d be happy to be that,” he says, smiling at Dennis.<br />
<br />
Dennis chuckles, “Jeff really was a fantastic horse,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jeff blushes a little, rubbing the back of his head, “he… thanks,” he says, “I’m happy that you are happy with me”.<br />
<br />
Dennis smiles, “I guess it’s my turn to tell you guys about myself”.<br />
<br />
“Please,” Quinn and Azrael say.<br />
<br />
“Well, my full name is “Dennis Thomson”, I have two brothers, Len and Ben, they are twins and both 13 years old, and now I have an adoptive brother,” he says, winking at Quinn.<br />
<br />
Quinn chuckles, “I honestly a happy,” he says, “back in my realm, I didn’t have siblings, I felt pretty lonely”.<br />
<br />
“Well, now you have a new family and brothers who care about you,” Dennis says.<br />
<br />
Quinn smiles, “I’m already enjoying my new life,” he says, his tail wagging.<br />
<br />
“Me too,” Azrael says.<br />
<br />
Both Jeff and Dennis smile, “we are happy you are enjoying your new lives,” they say.<br />
<br />
“Now, why don’t you tell us about yourselves,” Dennis asks.<br />
<br />
“Well, the memories I have tell me that I was born a single child,” Quinn says, “and that I attended the academy of magic. I’m neither a “predator” nor a “prey”, though I did enjoy transforming people into stuff, just as pranks. I never permanently transformed anyone”.<br />
<br />
Dennis and Jeff smile, “you seem like a cool guy, Quinn,” Dennis says.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Jeff says, “you too Azrael! What do your memories tell you?”<br />
<br />
“Thanks, Jeff,” Azrael says, “well, according to my memories, I was a living person who had an accident, my mind was then transferred into this robotic body, but I have no memories about being a living person, it’s so weird”.<br />
<br />
“Oh, that sounds kinda sad,” Jeff and Dennis say.<br />
<br />
Azrael smiles, “it’s all good,” he says, “as I said: I don’t really remember being a living person”.<br />
<br />
“At least I was able to give you a body that looks less like a machine,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
Azrael nods, “I love my new look,” he says, “I feel like a living person, even though I know I am in reality a robot”.<br />
<br />
“The most important thing is: you are happy,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
Azrael nods, “yeah”.<br />
<br />
“It’s so weird,” Quinn then says, “I don’t really understand, why Azrael and I have these… “memories” of living “normal lives”. I mean… we are just some creation from some human from this realm”.<br />
<br />
Dennis and Jeff look at each other, “well, we honestly don’t know,” Dennis says.<br />
<br />
“One reason could be that, when we extracted you, that we brought you to life, and since you were both part of a story, the app must have created those memories for you, based on what you are… were like in the comic”.<br />
<br />
“The other reason could be,” Dennis then says, “that somehow, by creating the comic, the creator, unknowingly, created a realm somewhere where you guys lived a normal life, not knowing that you, your world, families, friends,… that all that were just some human’s imagination”.<br />
<br />
“Both reasons make sense,” Quinn says, looking at Azrael who nods.<br />
<br />
“I can’t help but feel angry,” Azrael says, “angry that my life, my memories, that everything I thought was real was nothing but a lie!”<br />
<br />
“Same,” Quinn says.<br />
<br />
Jeff and Dennis look at each other, “we are sorry, we really didn’t mean to upset you”.<br />
<br />
“It’s not your fault,” Quinn says, “you two freed us from those fake lives and gave us real lives!”<br />
<br />
Azrael nods, “and we can’t be happier,” he says, smiling.<br />
<br />
Jeff and Dennis smile, feeling relieved, “we are so glad,” they say.<br />
<br />
“Tomorrow we’ll show you guys around,” Dennis says.<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “yeah, there is so much for you guys to learn, see and experience,” he says, “speaking of which, Azrael, you’ll need to wear clothes, like Quinn”.<br />
<br />
“I get it,” Azrael says, “I don’t look like a robot anymore!”<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “correct, for everyone, except me and Dennis, you are a “living person”, and a living person has to wear clothes, at least something to cover their privates”.<br />
<br />
Azrael nods, “yeah, I understand that, I’ll be okay with following that codex!”<br />
<br />
Jeff smiles, “good that you understand,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Let me grab something for you to wear,” Dennis says, soon Azrael is wearing an old black t-shirt and some blue jeans.<br />
<br />
“These fit perfectly,” Azrael says, “thanks, Dennis!”<br />
<br />
“No problem,” Dennis says, smiling.<br />
<br />
Jeff checks his watch, “damn… I better get home,” he says, “come Azrael, let’s go”.<br />
<br />
“Aww, man, but it was so fun,” Dennis says, “can’t you ask your parents if you could stay the night?”</p>
