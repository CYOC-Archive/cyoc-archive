<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bart continued, &quot;Marcine and Jack will attract wild deer with their musk after completing <br />
their transformation, and after Jack claims his position as head of the herd they should be <br />
able to keep the wild deer as game for the pack. And even if Jack can't can't become chief <br />
buck, Marcine and her fawns should be able to eventually influence any deer herd that <br />
forms into staying in this territory. It might take a year or two, but Marcine and Jack's <br />
genes should influence the deer to begin to stay near us as they multiply. The musk from <br />
our two superior deer should be keeping the herd together and around.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;A year or two?&quot; Jensen asked impatiently.<br />
<br />
&quot;I doubt most people pay attention to deer migration besides game hunters around here <br />
Master Father, but there's no need for us to waste staff on deer who will only have a <br />
limited time to use their turn. We could work it into the transformation, but I have a <br />
worried feeling about us making the Transforms too conditional, it might case a loop hole <br />
or a glitch we hadn't foreseen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A YEAR or two?&quot; Jensen growled slowly. <br />
<br />
Bart inched back a bit wanting to be very small, &quot;We can use the shadows, the phone and <br />
internet to deliver groceries. Besides, it's not like the pack is going anywhere.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen said nothing, which was the closest he'd come to conceding anything. Marcy <br />
meanwhile continued to look at Alice with delight just knowing she'd be fun to have <br />
around!<br />
<br />
Marcy's amusement of Alice wearing a dress within the world on the other side of the <br />
mirror was perfectly understandable, after all, the rest of the pack went around naked, <br />
including Alice outside the mirror, so Alice wearing her dress within the mirrors was the <br />
oddity among the pack that delighted the seven year old to no end. <br />
<br />
The black furred Jenny was also amused at Alice's addition to the pack, while she knew the <br />
real Alice Liddell didn't have blond hair like in the book drawings, and most certainly was <br />
no wolf, Jenny couldn't help but feel she was besides Alice's embodiment. She almost <br />
wondered if the idea of 'Alice' Bart had put foreword was a gift from her brother to her.  It <br />
wasn't really right to call him her husband anymore, and the idea of kissing him felt 'blech' <br />
and not just in the 'boys are icky' way the nine year old thought. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey sis'.&quot; Bart called out to Jenny, not wanting to look his father The Big Bad Wolf in the <br />
eyes right now. &quot;How many shadows do we have now? I got four with my group.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I only got two.&quot; Jenny answered slightly disappointed. <br />
<br />
Bart scratched behind his jaw says, &quot;Six shadows outta be enough. That means we just <br />
need to create enough Gargoyles,&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;-Grotesques-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;-Whatever, now we just need to create some gargoyles for security and change whoever <br />
is left the honor of becoming pack members.&quot; <br />
<br />
Alice clapped her hands, &quot;Oh stone beasties by north, by south, by east and by west!&quot; <br />
<br />
Fran and Darla looked at each other and spoke with Fran first. <br />
<br />
&quot;If this many people vanish at the estate, questions are going to start being asked.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darla continued, &quot;We're starting to think it might have been better for us to just move.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; Jensen said, &quot;We are not leaving the estate after we've already made so many <br />
preparation and plans, end of discussion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master.&quot; The twins echoed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let me and my shadows take care of that.&quot; Jenny boasted, &quot;Good enough lawyers can <br />
make anythin' seem plausible.  Just because we renew our contracts with our servants for <br />
them ta now live on the estate itself is no reason for anyone ta get involved, and with the <br />
majority of their own help, our new pack members and security are gonna legally vanish <br />
into thin air. Though we are going to have ta do somethin' about that gate way too easy to <br />
just stepped through I think.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't forget dear,&quot; Kaylee said, &quot;And we're still going to have to test to see if the <br />
experiment with our first gargoyle-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;-grotesque-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;-Enough Jenny. To see if our new creature really has ceased to exist in the outside world. <br />
Once we know that, we can either create new pack members with far less trouble, or know <br />
something won't work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can do that with Martha's new dance.&quot; Bart said with glee.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only on the days and nights of the new and full moon.&quot;  Jensen said. <br />
<br />
&quot;What? Why Master?&quot; Bart said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want someone to accidently get turned into a pack member we didn't mean to. <br />
With it being on certain days we can manage it better Bart.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;... Yes Master dad.&quot;  Bart looked over the list of staff who'd show up soon, &quot;Now, I figure <br />
that we could create five more wolf/dragon g-, living stone monsters. All female who'd <br />
work under our first one. Four can go on the estate's corners and the fifth one can flank <br />
our original... no wait, she can go behind the house. We'll use the 'dare to ask the game <br />
and answer transform' loophole to transform any who chose Dare.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Darla,&quot; Jensen said, &quot;I want you to test to see if our ... grotesque's parents still remember <br />
him or not, I have the phone number.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master.&quot; Darla nodded, glade to balance out the phone call Fran had made for the <br />
master yesterday. <br />
<br />
Jenny inserted, &quot;Remember ta include a token male or two ta service da she-wolves maids <br />
and other servants dat don't suit father's fancy or when he's too busy.&quot; <br />
<br />
Bart nodded, &quot;Right.&quot; <br />
<br />
Marcy asked, &quot;For when he's playing the saxophone or playing parcheesi?&quot;<br />
<br />
 Martha slowly patted her on the head, &quot;Yes Marcy, for when Master is playing the <br />
saxophone or parcheesi with the she-wolves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen leaned back on a coach in the tea room that functioned as a chair for him, favoring <br />
his bitten leg. He looked at them. Five pups, three red, one black, one glass. Four ladies, <br />
two dirty blond twins with gazongas that would make most women faint. His four breast, <br />
two heads, four armed, three eyes, two tails silver furred brown haired <br />
governess/nanny/nursemaid. And finally Little Red Riding Wolf.  All of them totally loyal to <br />
him. All of them living just to service and obey him. And only him. Jensen basked in the <br />
sense of superiority and dominance this gave him. <br />
<br />
And this didn't count the six people who were now but shadows of his former parents, <br />
and the two who'd soon be just a buck and doe for the pack's game herd. <br />
<br />
He thought back to his school friends, depending on what answer the <br />
gargoyle/grotesque's parents gave, he'd be either able to invite them over for a sleep over <br />
soon, or have to randomly pick them up across town one by one carefully. He knew they'd <br />
all make sexy she wolves for him. And even if they weren't, they'd still make good eye <br />
candy much like the remaining staff soon would. <br />
<br />
&quot;The majority of the staff will continue their jobs as before after their upgrades into the <br />
pack, just use the ones who aren't going to really be of much use in order of uselessness <br />
to create the five extra grotesques. Fran, fetch Jack and Marcine if they aren't in the middle <br />
of calling their relatives bye, we'll be using Jack's turn to create the gargoyles, and using <br />
Marcine's turn to change the staff, we'll then use the staff member's turns to alter the rest <br />
until we've gone through the rest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master.&quot; Fran bowed, not liking having a separate assignment from her twin at all but <br />
but realistic to know a phone call didn't need two people. <br />
<br />
Darla left the room at once to make the fated telephone call that would decide much of <br />
their future strategies. Fran meanwhile went to search via sent the new couple who'd soon <br />
be buck and doe of their game herd. She'd be glade when they got around to taking out <br />
the doors with the staff transformed and the frames enlarged, it wasn't like any of them <br />
were exactly small. Jensen was nine feet wall, the ladies were seven feet tall, and Martha, <br />
who was destine to be the lowest of the low forever and always among them was still six <br />
feet tall now! <br />
<br />
Kaylee said, &quot;Martha, take the cubs with you and go upstairs and stay upstairs. Alice is to <br />
act as a look out only. I'd rather not to have to test just how indestructible the game was <br />
able to make her. Marcy and Jenny still have turns but hopefully they won't be needed. I <br />
want them safe and sound until all the staff are in service of Master.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha bowed her heads, &quot;Yes Alpha Female.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come along girls/boys.&quot; The left and right heads say, each arm taking a child by hand <br />
while Alice took hold of both of Martha's tails gleefully following along. Martha led the <br />
pack of wolf cubs upstairs and out sight. <br />
<br />
Now suddenly alone, Kaylee feel on her hands and knees and bowed to her Master, &quot;How <br />
is your leg Mi'lord?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's alright.&quot; Jensen said, &quot;The twins gave it the iodine, that hurt like a son of a human, it's <br />
not going to get infected I'm sure. I trust you to do the running around until it heals.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll have the twins change your bandages this afternoon.&quot; Kaylee said, 'It'll give me an <br />
excuse to have more time to first aid from Darla.' Kaylee thought. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come and sit with me Kaylee.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master.&quot; <br />
<br />
Little Red Riding Wolf came up and sat on the couch with Jensen, the delicate antique <br />
slightly moaning under their weight, she wrapped an arm on his shoulder and she pawed <br />
between his legs without a second thought. <br />
<br />
&quot;Soon our wolf paradise will be complete and we'll just be able to enjoy ourselves Master.&quot; <br />
Kaylee rumbled. <br />
<br />
&quot;We'll think more about the future dear once the dust had settled. Kaylee.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master.&quot; She nuzzled under his chin, &quot;I just hope you don't plan to forget about me <br />
Master as our pack increases.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You never forget your first one dear.&quot; Jesen put one of his thick arms around her waist.</p>
