<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Stewie was absorbing the power within the crystal ball and changing his father a figure materialized out of the shadows near where Megan's corpse laid. It turned out to be a girl named Lisa. She was seventeen with platinum blond hair that fell in naturally curly waves down to her waist. Her eyes were a deep blue like the ocean. She was wearing a black robe with purple trim which hid her slight hourglass shape and B cup breasts. She was carrying a staff of twisted oak branches with a small crystal ball at the top in her right hand.<br />
<br />
She saw Megan's corpse and quickly walked up to it. Kneeling down she reached for her neck but drew back when she saw the gash. Megan was definitely dead. &quot;I'll take you back to your mother Megan&quot; Lisa whispered. Looking around she asked herself &quot;Where's Stewie though?&quot; After looking around some more she said &quot;First things first, make sure the orb and book are still in the tree.&quot; She moved to the tree and looked inside. After not finding them she said &quot;Damn! I'm too late it seems.&quot; Just then she heard a wolf howl. Digging in the neck of her robe she brought out some sort of amulet and looked at it. &quot;Double damn!&quot; she said when she saw the image of the full moon on it. She turned back to Megan and let go of her staff which stood up on it's own. Walking back over to Megan she bent down and lifted her corpse up in her arms. She wrinkled her nose as the smell of shit and piss hit her. She made a small gesture with her hand and her staff floated into her hand. She walked over to the shadows muttering an incantation as she did. She turned herself and Megan into shadows melting into the other shadows and leaving this world.<br />
<br />
Within two seconds Lisa and Megan materialized out of the shadows in a cave. As soon as they did a wailing cry was heard that said &quot;MEGAN!&quot; Megan's mother came running up and looked at her dead daughter with tears in her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please move aside Marry&quot; Lisa said. &quot;I need to prepare her body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She can be resurrected?&quot; Marry asked a note of hope in her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think so&quot; Lisa said. &quot;She hasn't been dead long.&quot; Raising her voice she said &quot;I need a volunteer. I have to maintain the balance between living and dead. If I resurrect Megan someone else will need to take her place in The Land of the Dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll do it&quot; Marry said stepping to the side so Lisa could place Megan on the altar.<br />
<br />
&quot;No Marry&quot; Lisa said placing Megan on the altar and starting to undress her. &quot;You know that you are needed for her rebirth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will do it&quot; an old woman said stepping forward. &quot;I have lived three hundred years and I have seen much. My daughters were rebirthed long ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure about this Megan?&quot; Lisa asked continuing to undress Megan's body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aye I am&quot; the elder Megan said. &quot;I can not think of a better way to die than by taking my descendant's place in The Land of the Dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then prepare yourself&quot; Lisa said. The elder Megan nodded in a sign of respect and began to disrobe.<br />
<br />
&quot;What of the orb and book?&quot; Marry asked calm now that she knew her daughter would be resurrected.<br />
<br />
&quot;They were gone&quot; Lisa said. &quot;Taken by a werewolf.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can you be sure?&quot; a young girl of eleven named Mona asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My pendant is showing the full moon&quot; Lisa said and almost everyone gasped. The only ones that didn't were the young ones that had been rebirthed within the last three years. &quot;The werewolves are rising again with their full power.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is troubling news&quot; the elder Megan said as she finished disrobing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know&quot; Lisa said cleaning the shit and piss from Megan's body. &quot;With the book gone we'll have to reconstruct the spell to seal their full power away again. At least the barrier is still up so we don't have to worry about all the magical creatures running around on Earth.&quot; She finished cleaning Megan's body with wiping the blood off. &quot;I think it was probably Megan's blood that tainted the orb.&quot; A stunned silence met this statement as Lisa went over to some shelves and selected several bottles from a shelf. The elder Megan had also gone over to the shelves and selected several bottles herself. Each one poured a bit of the contents of each bottle into a bowl. When they finished the elder Megan began to rub the oil over herself with help from a couple other witches while chanting. Lisa was rubbing the oil she mixed into Megan's body chanting a different chant.<br />
<br />
Lisa finished preparing Megan's body and stopped chanting. She looked over to the elder Megan and noticed that her own preparations were complete. Wiping her hands on a towel Lisa said &quot;Preparations are now complete. Before I perform the resurrection I want everyone here to take a moment to reflect on Megan's life and sacrifice. If you want to give her your thanks for her sacrifice now is the time.&quot; Everyone gave their thanks Marry's being the loudest and most heartfelt of them. Once that was done Lisa continued &quot;Megan, please lay down on the altar so I can perform the resurrection.&quot; The elder Megan laid down on the altar with a little help from a couple of other witches. Lisa stood at their heads and held her staff over them. She took a breath and said in a loud clear voice &quot;Guardians of the Gate of Life hear me. Allow this soul to return to The Land of the Living. A willing soul is ready to take her place in The Land of the Dead. This is what I request of thee.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa started chanting and a silver light shot out of the elder Megan's body and into the crystal on Lisa's staff. After a second or two a beam of silver light shot out of the crystal and into Megan. Lisa was glad that the guardians had decided to grant her request. As the light continued to stream into Megan the gash in her neck sealed over and healed leaving a scar. As the light streamed out of the elder Megan her breathing slowed and eventually stopped as the light left her body. A second or two later the light finished coming out of the crystal and into Megan's body. Lisa slumped a bit using the altar for support while Megan took a gasping breath and sat up screaming &quot;NO STEWIE! PLEASE DON'T KILL ME!&quot;</p>
