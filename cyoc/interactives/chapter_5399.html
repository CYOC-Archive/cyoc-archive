<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tim called down to the handsome stranger and continued to shower, lathering up all that extra fur and shampooing his new beard, he reflected on his life.  In high school, he’d been the class ‘fag’.  He was on the swim team, he was in the drama club and he was trim and fashionable.  He’d been these things because he couldn’t be what he wanted to be, the big hairy brutes on the football team.  Tim wasn’t tall and he had a slight frame.  It made him lithe and wiry, but not massive and strong and what had he expected anyway, his frame was much like his father’s.  You worked with what you had and since Tim hadn’t had the other things, he used what he had.<br />
<br />
This isn’t to say that Tim was a flaming queen, in fact he didn’t act ‘gay’ at all.  The only reason anyone had known at all was that someone had broken into his locker and found some incriminating evidence.  His father, of course, was far too busy with business to notice.  In essence, his father was clueless; clueless that is, until he caught the very buff, very sexy Jerry from the college basketball team in Tim’s bed.  Tim liked his men strong and furry.<br />
<br />
Frank Dane, his extremely successful father, had all but disowned him.  The only reason he had a place to stay at all now was that the owner of this salvage yard, Henry Orff had hired him and liked him.  The old guy was a big, bearded, burly, fat old bear whose wife had died years ago and whose son had died in Vietnam.  The old guy had taken him in, Tim guessed, because he had reminded him of his son some thirty years dead.  He was good to Tim and more of a father to him than his always busy businessman father, had been.  Tim, not being one to repeat a mistake, let Henry know up front that he was gay.<br />
The old man didn’t seem to care, though he also made it very clear to Tim that he was very straight.  When Hank Orff died, Tim saw to the arrangements as per instructions in his will.  Hank didn’t have any children or siblings that could contest the will so Tim Dane was owner of all the worldly possessions Hank had left behind.<br />
<br />
As Tim dried of the acres of new muscular body, he realized that all of his clothes wouldn’t possibly fit him anymore.  In a flash of inspiration, he realized that he still had a dresser full of Hank’s clothes.  Hank was a big man, six foot plus, and Tim grabbed the first thing in the drawer, an old, worn, but clean pair of overalls.  He slipped them on and adjusted the straps for a frame taller than that of their previous owner.  He wanted to get back out into the living room ASAP, so he didn’t bother with socks or a shirt.  He saw a pair of the old man’s work boots and slipped them on.<br />
<br />
Tim stooped for a quick look in the old mirror over the dresser at his teeth revealed that his sharper than normal canines were apparently part of his new form.  His finger nails were no longer claws and weren’t sharp, though they were thicker than average and only slightly darker than normal.  He stooped and looked again in the mirror, he’d become everything he’d ever wanted.<br />
<br />
As he moved into the living room he banged his head slightly on the top of door frame and growled out a curse.  When he entered, rubbing his forehead, what he saw made his heart race.  The big bearish man had the box in his hands.<br />
<br />
*************<br />
As his host was showering, Kelvin looked the box over, thinking about why he was here.  He’d decided to open his own contracting company.  Kelvin would be specializing in restoration of older homes and he knew places like this salvage yard often got things from older homes that could be reused.  <br />
<br />
Kelvin was a ‘tough guy’.  He’d worked construction since he was sixteen and the work had put bulk and muscle on his frame that he augmented with free weights.  He rode a Harley, hung out at a biker bar, had masculine tattoos, had a long braded sandy blond pony tail and red blond beard with a sandy blond moustache.  He watched football and played poker with ‘they guys’, whistled at the cute women who walked by the construction sites, smoked cigars and naturally gave everyone the impression that he was a ‘Regular Joe’.  It was important to do this, because Kevin was gay.  He was a bear, but he didn’t hang out at the bear bars like he wished he could.  In fact, he’d only been with a man once and had given his virginity to him.  The guy was a burly, grey bearded, long haul trucker and Kelvin’s encounter with him completely confirmed his belief that he was indeed gay; Kelvin had loved the sex too much for him not to be gay.  He’d chosen the trucker at the truck stop because he knew there was little chance that any of his friends would find out.  Kelvin’s secret was safe.<br />
<br />
He heard his host dressing in his bedroom.  Kelvin absently ran his fingers over the jeweled box and looked around the room and saw a picture on a coffee table of his host and apparently his host’s young son.  The kid was something of a twink, cute, but not Kelvin’s type.  His host was apparently a big, bearded, burly, fat old bear rather like the first man who had ever made love to him.  Kelvin was touching the jewels and thinking about bears and that led to thinking about real bears, black bears, polar bears, grizzly bears and of course, the largest grizzly, the Kodiak grizzly.  Kelvin liked bears and had since he was a kid.  He used to ask to feed the bears at the zoo.  His parents bought apples and carrots and cut them up so he could throw apple slices and carrot chunks to the bears.  Kelvin even had a grizzly tattoo that covered the better portion of his hairy back.<br />
<br />
Kelvin looked up as he heard his host bump his head on the door frame, he wasn’t the man Kelvin had been expecting.  If this was the old guy’s son, he must be the brother of the one in the photo because looked nothing like the twink.  This guy was huge and Kelvin could see the fur carpeting all over his upper torso because the guy wasn’t wearing a shirt under his overalls.  The image of a Kodiak came to his mind as he continued to rub the jewels on the box.  Kelvin’s cock was growing stiff looking at his host.<br />
<br />
The great beast of a man’s eyes went wide as he saw what Kelvin was doing and Kelvin began to feel a tingle in his fingers that was moving up his arm.<br />
<br />
Tim watched, amazed at what was happening to the man holding the box.</p>
