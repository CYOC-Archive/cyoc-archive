<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Subject Name: Alice Pendra<br />
Age: 23<br />
Height: 5&#39;2&quot;<br />
Weight: 119lbs<br />
Eyes: Ever Green<br />
Hair: Black, Shoulder Length, Straight<br />
Skin: Pale Tan<br />
Bust: 37<br />
Waist: 30<br />
Hip: 40<br />
Occupation: Freelance Writer<br />
Special Notes: Subject has become increasing agitated and desperate over time. Rarely do they exit their apartment let alone the complex except for necessities.<br />
<br />
Alice rubbed her eyes from staring at a blank white screen for hours. The blinking line had been taunting her to get the words to come out of her fingers. Yet, here she was and with what to show for it; nothing... Her desk was piled with empty energy drink bottles and paper bowls left over from previous meals. All part of the struggle she&#39;d say to herself as she pulled another all-nighter in front of her computer. Sleep crept up on her as always and she closed the window revealing page after page of references. Her project this time was to create a story that maybe someone out there would pick up and think &#39;Oh, maybe this might be a good read.&#39; Hah...<br />
<br />
Rubbing her eyes and feeling the large bags hanging just below them, she wondered if they&#39;d charge her for them if she ever vacationed... She dragged her feet as she crossed the apartment to her bedroom even scratching her ass through the old cotton undies she was wearing. What&#39;d it matter to get dressed if she hadn&#39;t planned on going anywhere? Upon reaching her bed, she dropped onto it burying her face in the closest pillow. When she got up later, she&#39;d... And just like that she was out cold.<br />
<br />
Several hours later, or an hour by the clock... She awoke to someone banging on her door. Was it the landlord again? What&#39;d she do this time? Her rent was on time, she didn&#39;t make any noise, and hell if she talked to most of the other tenants... Maybe he was just coming to check and make sure she was still alive in here... With a sigh, she put on some gray sweats and a stained white Tee and answered the door. Oh god... Her...<br />
<br />
Standing at the door, in a pink sports bra that looked like it was fighting for dear life and a pair of much less worn gray sweats of her own was her next door neighbor. Samantha was a Blonde, Blue eyed hottie with the body of a beauty queen, she knew it too. All that &#39;My body is a temple and I, its goddess&#39; bullshit. Cheery as could be she eyed Alice as she stood in the doorway. &quot;Hi, Allie. I was going to ask if you wanted to join me down at the gym for a work out session. I see you&#39;re already dressed for it.&quot; She beamed with a brightness that threatened the sun itself, damn that hurts. <br />
<br />
Looking down at herself, Alice cocked an eyebrow and returned her gaze to Samantha. &quot;Some people don&#39;t have that kind of energy and for the umpteenth time... STOP CALLING ME, ALLIE!&quot; I almost slammed the door on her but, it was on me this time. &quot;Sorry, look I need sleep. Maybe some other time.&quot; <br />
<br />
Samantha smiled through the tirade and nodded when I finished. &quot;Ok, well just let me know.&quot; She giggled softly and trotted down the hallway. <br />
<br />
Well, now that Alice was all properly riled up and couldn&#39;t sleep, maybe she could get to work on that new story or stare at the screen till she passed out again. She lightly touched her forward from the last time that she&#39;d passed out and into the desk... Booting up the computer, it opened immediately to a page that she hadn&#39;t opened before. Casting her gaze around the room, she didn&#39;t sere anything out of place so noone broke in... Well shit, must be a virus from somewhere. &#39;Chronivac 4.0&#39; shown in the middle of the window, she bumped the mouse onto the floor and bent down to retrieve it. When she came back up it must&#39;ve clicked because the window was different and...<br />
<br />
&#39;Welcome User, Alish Penther&#39; was prominently displayed across the window. Well, that&#39;s just freaky but, they could&#39;ve done a better job of getting her name right... Oh well, let&#39;s close this shit and get to work. Where&#39;s the close button? Task Manager doesn&#39;t see the program either. Maybe if I restart it? Cycling the computer had just closed everything but the &#39;Chronivac 4.0&#39; window. Well, seems I&#39;m stuck with it now... She clicked through numerous pages that looked like technical documents and almost made her head spin trying to read the first one. Finally, it came to her profile settings, may as well fix the name.<br />
<br />
After the settings page came another but, this simply stated &#39;Input Target:|________&#39; This must some sort of joke, well may as well take someone with me. She immediately thought about the landlord but, that might backfire spectacularly. &quot;Samanatha Barcly&quot; She said to herself as she filled in the blank. Might do the woman some good to have a little misfortune befall her for once. Upon hitting enter, the screen changed to a 3D model of the woman in question standing with arms out to her sides. What really weirded her out was that it was even wearing the same outfit she&#39;d just seen the blonde wearing. Looking at the fields, the very first was a dropbox called &#39;Awareness: Aware&#39;. It might be be a good idea to turn that off, she felt and she changed it to unaware. Last thing, she&#39;d want is for the blonde to know she had done whatever this was. <br />
<br />
Moving further along, she saw sliders for Height, Weight, Age, Bust, Waist, Etc. It wouldn&#39;t hurt to have a little harmless fun before she got screwed would it? Seeing the sliders and the little Samantha model on the screen she grimaced, the clothes got in the way... After a brief search, she found an option for clothing and quickly replaced the list with simply; None. As soon she she moved away from the option, the model stood in its uncovered glory. Damn, she really was gifted with the perfect body wasn&#39;t she? Her sex even sported a faint blonde pinstripe leading toward it. Now she really looked at the sliders for all her information.<br />
<br />
Name: Samantha Barcly<br />
Height: 5&#39;9&quot; -/+<br />
Weight: 107lbs -/+<br />
Age: 27 -/+<br />
Eyes: Blue<br />
Hair: Curly, Waist length, Blonde<br />
Skin: Tan<br />
Bust: 44 - /+<br />
Waist: 32 -/+<br />
Hips: 44 -/+<br />
<br />
Well the first slider she played with was the height, first she shrank her all the way down to barely an inch high and chuckled at the speck on the screen. Afterward, she ramped the height up to a considerable ten feet tall, she didn&#39;t want to consider Blondezilla. She skipped over weight, she really didn&#39;t want to see a nude bag of potatoes, blech. Of course, there was only one way to play with bust sizes... Soon the figure on the screen sported a pair of basketballs on it&#39;s chest then back down to around normal. Waist followed it&#39;s counterpart weight, less discouraging but, too close for comfort. Hips was much like its counterpart bust as well, she gave her an ass to be in awe of before she scaled it back to maybe where it had been. An innocent whistle and a glance away from the screen fitted a slightly altered body of the model.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile in the gym, Samantha had finished her warmups and had started with pull ups. Just as she grabbed for the bar her clothes evaporated into thin air and she didn&#39;t even flinch. Pulling her chin over the bar, she was struck with a new alteration. The world had become gigantic around her causing her to lose her grip and descend toward the distant floor. Good thing that a moment later, she landed and the top of her head knocked into the bottom of the bar. Her elongated body sat on its rear and she was bewildered as to when she had lost her grip exactly. Shrugging she decided to move onto push ups, as she performed the set she didn&#39;t get as low as the last as her breasts expanded. Before too long she could balance on them without her hands although the cold mat made her nipples hard and uncomfortable. Another moment and she was on her face with her breasts pancaked to the floor. Maybe just squats today then... While performing her squats however, she bounced off her ass a little higher each time until like her breasts, she rested on them. Before she could contemplate the oddness of the day, she fell onto her back as her ass deflated to normal. Shaking her head at the odd session, she called it a day gathering her belongings. While she walked to her apartment her breasts expanded just a bit more than normal and her ass toned to a  savory shape. <br />
<br />
Samantha knocked on Alice&#39;s door and heard that telltale grumbling and stomping until the door swung open. Seeing that glower on Alice&#39;s face always made her want to cheer up her oh so dour neighbor. Though she wasn&#39;t glowering this time, she seemed to be awestruck at her body. Well, let her see what the power of a good workout could do. She raised her hands out to show off the fruits of labor. &quot;Well, whatcha think?&quot; She cocked her head with a smile and a giggle.<br />
<br />
Alice answered the door to a sight that might&#39;ve struck her dead if she weren&#39;t so tired. Samantha that bubbly blonde goddess had ascended from workout junkie to full on exhibitionist. To make matters worse her, Samantha&#39;s breasts were damn near eye level with her and then she lifted them by putting her arms up. Did she hit her head and lose her decency while she was down there!? <br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, come on, say something, Allie.&quot; Before Alice could react Samantha pulled her face first into her breasts for a hug.<br />
<br />
Alice watched the breasts hurdle closer until she found herself smothered between them. She tried to pull away quickly but, had nothing to grab hold of besides Samantha&#39;s smooth soft skin. Samantha gasped softly as Alice grabbed her sides and pushed away. Gasping for breath more from surprise than being smothered she stared at Samantha prepared for a repeat performance. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sorry, sorry, was that too forward?&quot; Samantha seemed more concerned about Alice than her own nudity. &quot;I guess, I&#39;ll just go home now... Remember, you rain checked a work out with me!&quot; She was and giggled as she entered her own apartment.<br />
<br />
Alice closed the door trying to wrap her exhausted mind around what had just happened. Seeing the screen glowing with the Chronivac still active, it her harder than that hug. Whatever this program was and wherever it had come from, the damn thing worked...</p>
