<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As much as he didn&#39;t want to admit it, Kyle didn&#39;t want to see Ally completely erased from existence. She was, for better or for worse, his sister, and that at least meant a little bit. However, the idea of Ally wanting to be a dog was arousing him. She had gone from hating dogs to wanting to be one in the course of a day. The power he had over her was intoxicating. He remembered some of the drawings of furries he had found online. That would be an interesting way to take this. His sister could be the first real life anthro!<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Ally, I&#39;m going to need you to take off your clothes.&quot;<br />
&quot;Does this mean what I think it means?&quot; She had already taken off her shirt, and was working on her pants.<br />
&quot;Patience Ally. Not yet.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then why am I naked?&quot; She was pouting with her hands on her hips, but her indignation was undermined by her lack of clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ally, be a Good Girl and turn into a anthropomorphic dog.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ally barked at the command. She felt the magic seep into her, and started wiggling her butt in anticipation. As her ass jiggled, a large tail started growing out of it. She wagged it happily, as the magic flowed out of it into the rest of her body. German Shepherd fur quickly covered her torso, as her breasts shrank and multiplied to become dog teats. The fur raced down her arms and legs, and as Ally watched her hands and feet became the paws they were meant to be. Her head was the last to change. She shook it from side to side as her muzzle grew right in front of her eyes. Like a dog that had just gotten out of a bath, Ally shook her whole body, luxuriating in the change. Finally, she barked again, signalling the end of the process. <br />
<br />
Within minutes, Ally had become a real-life furry. Kyle was never going to get over how hot the transformation was. <br />
Ally growled at her brother before barking at him. &quot;What&#39;s the big idea? I wanted to be a dog, not almost a dog. I can&#39;t go outside and play like this. I want to be an animal, not a freak!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax, I&#39;m not done yet. Why don&#39;t you look yourself over? He gestured to a full length mirror in the hallway. Ally padded over to it on all fours, barking at the dog in the mirror.<br />
&quot;Go on two legs Ally.&quot; she growled under her breath, but did as her brother commanded. She happily panted, liking her reflection. Sure, she wasn&#39;t a total dog, but it was pretty close. She wagged her tail, content with her new form.<br />
&quot;That isn&#39;t so bad now, is it?&quot; Kyle inquired, noticing Ally&#39;s excitement.<br />
&quot;I like it, and you definitely like it,&quot; She could smell her brother&#39;s excitement. &quot;But that&#39;s not the problem. I can&#39;t go outside and play with other people. They would think I&#39;m a monster.&quot; She made a dog whine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Again, not done yet. Look back at your reflection. Now then, when you are awake, you will see yourself as this form. Even if you are fully human, you will see yourself as an Anthro Dog. No one else will see your new form, only you will see it. You will want to go back to being human, but subconsciously you will like your new body better than your old one. You will gain a dog&#39;s instincts, and you will naturally want to act on them. However, you can control them, and you will keep your desires a secret to everyone but me. You will not reveal your changes to anyone except for me. You will pretend that nothing has changed about you. Do you understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have turned into an Anthro Dog, but no one else can see it. I want to act like a dog, but I keep that a secret. You are my sole confidant. I can only tell you about my changes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then, Ally, do you remember your triggers?&quot;<br />
&quot;When I hear &#39;Good Girl&#39; I become more of a dog and when I hear &#39;Good Dog&#39; I become a full dog. When I hear &#39;Barbie Doll&#39; I go back to being a human.&quot;<br />
Kyle reconsidered the triggers. They were amazing, but were too dangerous right now. He didn&#39;t want anyone seeing that Ally actually had a tail, other than him. He needed to make them more specific.<br />
&quot;Okay Ally, I&#39;m going to change the triggers a little bit. First off, only I can activate your triggers. Secondly, they must be addressed to you. You won&#39;t change if I say &#39;Barbie Doll&#39; in a normal conversation. It only works if I tell you &#39;Barbie Doll&#39; as a command. Does that make sense?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes. You are the only one who can purposefully change me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle nodded, satisfied. That took care of most of the headaches. Still, what if he wanted to embarrass her in public? Was there anyway to do that? He took a second to think it over.<br />
&quot;You know, I can&#39;t keep calling you Ally when you&#39;re a dog. That&#39;s your human name. Your name as a dog is...&quot; He trailed off, not coming up with one. &quot;What is your dog name?&quot;<br />
It was Ally&#39;s turn to think. She looked at the mirror again. This clearly wasn&#39;t Ally&#39;s body. This was...<br />
&quot;Sadie. Sadie is my pet name. It is my true name.&quot;<br />
<br />
It worked for Kyle. &quot;Now then, Sadie.&quot; The dog barked at the mention of her name. &quot;That&#39;s the name of this body. The form you&#39;ve taken is named Sadie, just like the dog you want to become. When you are awake, you pretend you are Ally, even though you are Sadie.&quot;<br />
Sadie barked happily at the thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s important to know the difference. Other people see you as Ally, but you see yourself as Sadie. When I use the triggers, they are more effective on your true self. If I use them on Sadie, they will be just as effective, but when I use them on Ally, they are going to be less effective.&quot;<br />
Sadie looked at him, confused. &quot;What do you mean, less effective?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When I say, &#39;Good Girl, Ally&#39; Ally will have the urge to act like you, even in public. She won&#39;t transform, but she will have to deal with some doggy instincts. She&#39;ll see herself as an Anthro Dog, but no one else will notice any physical changes. Does that make sense?&quot;<br />
&quot;Ally will want to act like an Anthro Dog when she hears &#39;Good Girl&#39; directed at her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right. When Ally hears, &#39;Good Dog, Ally&#39; she will act just like a dog. She won&#39;t transform, and will still view herself as an Anthro Dog, but she will act just like a dog, even in public.&quot;<br />
Sadie nodded. &quot;When she hears you say &#39;Good Dog&#39; at her she will become a dog mentally.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Finally, when Ally hears, &#39;Barbie Doll, Ally&#39; she will go back to acting like a human. She will still see herself as an Anthro Dog, and will  remember how she acted like an Anthro Dog. She will be embarrassed that she acted like a dog, but subconsciously she will have enjoyed giving in. She will only remember being an Anthro Dog, and nothing else. She will know that no one else sees her as an Anthro Dog. Do you understand?&quot;<br />
&quot;When Ally hears &#39;Barbie Doll&#39; she stops acting like a dog for the time being. She will remember and enjoy acting like an animal, but she will also be ashamed of her actions. She won&#39;t remember anything about transforming physically, but will still view herself as an Anthro Dog.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay so you know what happens when Ally hears the triggers. Now then, when you hear the triggers Sadie, you&#39;re going to actually transform. When you hear, &quot;Good Girl, Sadie&quot; you will transform into this Anthro Dog form. You won&#39;t need to grow dog parts one at a time, you&#39;ll just go all the way to an Anthro Dog. Everyone can see your true form when this happens. When you hear, &quot;Good Dog, Sadie&quot; you will become a full dog. You will turn into my pet German Shepherd. Finally, when you hear &quot;Barbie Doll, Sadie&quot; you will transform back into a human, and will view yourself as a human. You will forget all about being a dog, and believe you acted like a human. Do you understand how much more powerful those commands are?&quot;<br />
Sadie barked. &quot;When I hear &quot;Good Girl&quot; I become an Anthro Dog. When I hear &quot;Good Dog&quot; I become a dog. When I hear &quot;Barbie Doll&quot; I become a human who doesn&#39;t think she is a dog.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle felt much more confident this time around. He was sure the triggers would work wonders on his sister, and couldn&#39;t wait to try them out.<br />
&quot;Okay Sadie we&#39;re almost done. Ally is going to wake up and remember nothing about her hypnosis. Ally, Barbie Doll.&quot;<br />
The changes were immediate. Her fur and tail vanished, and Ally was now a naked teenager staring at herself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot; <br />
&quot;Your sister, Ally&quot; Ally drawled. His sister was much less perky now that she wasn&#39;t an Anthro Dog.<br />
&quot;Who do you see in the mirror?&quot;<br />
She stared at it. &quot;An Anthropomorphic German Shepherd named Sadie.&quot; She perked up as she said it, before frowning, confused.<br />
<br />
Kyle smirked. He could already tell this was going to be a lot of fun. &quot;Ally, put your clothes back on.&quot;<br />
His sister did so robotically, still frowning slightly. Kyle decided to ask one final question, before snapping his sister out of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is Sadie wearing any clothes Ally?&quot;<br />
&quot;No. Dogs don&#39;t wear anything besides a collar.&quot;<br />
Kyle was slightly concerned. He didn&#39;t want his sister to become a nudist, unless he told her to.<br />
&quot;You know you have to wear clothes though, right?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah. I always put on clothes. I just don&#39;t see them on Sadie.&quot;<br />
He breathed a sigh of relief. It would be bad if Ally took off her clothes whenever he embarrassed her in public. <br />
<br />
Kyle rubbed his hands together. It was time for the fun to begin.<br />
&quot;Okay Ally. When I snap my fingers, you will wake up from your trance. You will see yourself as Sadie, but no one else will. You will not remember anything that happened in your trance, or why you see yourself as Sadie. It&#39;s time to wake up.<br />
<br />
He snapped his fingers, and waited to see what was going to happen.</p>
