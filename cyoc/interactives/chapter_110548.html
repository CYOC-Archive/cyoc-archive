<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/><em>Characters:</em> <strong>Mary</strong> [19]; <em>Changing.</em> <strong>Robert</strong> [45] & <strong>Melissa</strong> [45]; <em>Single, Purple, Two-headed Anthro Dragoness.</em> <strong>Jenny</strong> [14] & <strong>Mark</strong> [22]; <em>Unchanged.</em></div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Holding it between her thumb and index finger, Mary inspects the blue piece of candy closely. To her, It&#39;s about as unassuming as any other piece of candy. Obviously, it&#39;s blue and shaped like a dragon. Looking for something more, she twirls it idly with her fingertips. Supposedly, a dragon candy like this had changed her parents into the singular-minded masturbating dragon behind her. As she twirls it, she notices the dragon is male, similar to the one on the bottle. There was a slight air of mystery surrounding the hard candy. Through her experiences over the last few minutes, she had at least a rough idea of what the other two candies could do. This blue one, on the other hand, is still a complete mystery. Besides that, there really isn&#39;t any other remarkable thing about it. In one final attempt to discover its secrets, she rolls it over to the other side. The same male dragon, just mirrored. Overall, Mary feels moderately disappointed at the generic appearance of the candy.<br />
<br />
She let&#39;s the candy drop from her gaze slightly, putting it at mouth level. Disappointed, she considers looking at the other candies. Surely they weren&#39;t as plain? At that moment, she feels a heavy weight slam against the back of her shoulders, launching her forward. The red and black dragon candies go flying. Before she can go flying forward herself, a large and scaled arm wraps around her waist and yanks her back. At the sight of the violet scales, Mary immediately realizes who the arm belongs to. Squeezing tightly, the two-headed dragoness pins Mary against herself. Her large reptilian mammaries force Mary into an uncomfortable forward position as they push against her back. Quickly, another scaled arm reaches out towards the hand which holds the blue dragon-shaped candy. Without much effort, it swipes the candy with its sharp claws. With no time wasted, Mary finds the blue candy in her mouth, along with a single draconian finger, forcing it further down her throat. She struggles in vain, dismayed to be tasting the blueberry flavor of the candy. With another shove, Mary audibly gags as the two-headed dragoness that previously was her parents shoves the candy as far as her fingers and claws will let her. Mary recoils as she can taste the dragon&#39;s clawed fingers, along with the fluids from when she was pleasuring herself. Her gag reflex betrays her, and she swallows involuntarily, carrying the blue-dragon down to her stomach. The hydra woman laughs with both heads and retracts her scaly-claws from Mary&#39;s throat, letting her drop to the floor, gagging and sputtering.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry sweetie,&quot; both heads say in unison, &quot;But I just have to know what the blue candy is capable of.&quot; Mary only coughs in response, still reeling from having two large claws shoved down her throat. The dragoness hydra is unconcerned with her pain, now visibly excited. Still physically excited down below, she holds a hand against the side of a dragonic jaw on each head in curiosity.<br />
<br />
Before Mary can recover, she feels a pure heat emanate from her stomach. At first, it&#39;s small and painful, like heartburn. But within seconds, it grows inhumanly ferocious. Instead of feeling more pain however, all Mary can feel is more heat. She can feel it making her body malleable. Right when she starts to feel like she&#39;s literally going to melt, her changes begin. Before anything else, her hair fizzles as it burns out of existence. The sensation of burning hair hits her eyelashes, make her shut her eyes tightly. Scales burst outward, coating her body in deep, rich navy-blue scales. On her head, her mouth and jaw push outward, and changing her teeth along with the bone structure. Involuntarily, she gnashes her new teeth while her dragonic snout pushes forward, clacking audibly much in the same way the dragoness hydra&#39;s sharp teeth clacked when she talked. While her nostrils push forward to the end of her new dragon snout, a pair of ebony black horns poke out from above her rapidly shrinking ears, twisting in turning in a very dragon like fashion.  With that, Mary&#39;s tongue parts becoming similar to that of a dragon. At this point, it becomes impossible call her head anything but a dragon&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Since Mary was still on her knees, the next changes are immediately obvious to her. Her toes fuse into three thick digitrade claws, which naturally grip and dig against the floor. Claws soon replace her fingernails capable of squeezing the life out of anything. Mary, finally able to open her eyes, Looks down at ground with her new reptilian eyes. As she stares, she can tell how much her limbs have grown, considering how far off the ground she is now. Claws flat against the ground, she watches them grow thick and wide, as if belonging to a male. Mary winces at what this might mean. As if in response, her forearms and biceps bulk up considerably. The blue scales smooth over the muscle as it grows. Although she see them, Mary feels her legs and feet undergo a similar process of exploding in muscle. She could even feel her heart throb harder as it grew into a dragonic muscle.<br />
<br />
With each heavy throb of her heart, she feels her breasts shrinking. They weren&#39;t very big to begin with, but after a few seconds, they&#39;re gone. Her jaw, already serpentine and dragon-like, thickens even further, until it&#39;s strong enough to crunch a coconut. Mary swallows hard at this. The taste of the hydra had never really left her mouth, and now, with a fully male dragon muzzle, she could taste and smell her. It bothers Mary how much the fluids have gone from disgusting to almost intoxicating. she could do nothing but taste the dragoness hydra. She inhales sharply and puts a claw against her chest. It&#39;s flat, firm, and scaly. She fills the pecs fill in, and follows downward with a single claw to meet an impressive six-pack growing in. They slide underneath her scaly hide as her whole body finishes bulking up, leaving her more than three feet taller than her old self. She now easily towers over the hydra woman.<br />
<br />
The entire time of the changing, the purple two-headed dragon herself had gone from watching closely with curiosity to actively masturbating at the site. Each head blushing intensely at the changing Mary. Mary wasn&#39;t oblivious to this either. As soon as her snout formed, she could smell the dragoness sharply. The more the dragoness pleasured herself, the more of her scent flooded Mary&#39;s snout. The fire, which had burned so much at first, now felt like pleasure. Together, simply breathing started to feel like masturbation to Mary. With most of her old physical self gone, Mary can&#39;t resist her needs anymore. She lays on her side as she frees hands to work herself.  As she lays on her scaly side, a thick, meaty tail pushes outward from just below her spine. It snakes outward across the room, until it&#39;s the same length as her torso, ending in a tip with a slight cresting, which grow into a ridge that travels along her back until eventually cresting again on her head. She finally joins her parents and plunges a claw into her scaly pussy. Furiously, she tries to jill herself as much as she can. Instead of pleasure however, she felt nothing. She looks down at herself in confusion.<br />
<br />
Instead of a healthy female vagina, her claw is just being shoved in a small opening in her crotch. Before long, her claws are forced out of even this as it closes. For a few brief moments, Mary lays there, without a gender. Suddenly, the sealed labia walls swell outward. They begin sag as  two orbs fall into each side. At the same time, her clitoris bursts forward, turning from a deep pink to a dark inhuman purple. Immediately thick and heavy, pulsing as it grows. Mary watches as his erection grows until in stands full mast at a terrifying fourteen inches. His balls sag hard and straddle his legs, the size of softballs. He shudders hard as his new penis quivers against the cold air of the room. He quickly succumbs to the desire for pleasure. Cock in hand, his tongue lolls out again as he experiences male pleasure for the first time. It&#39;s while he&#39;s furiously jacking off that the pleasurable heat of the dragon candy finally fades<br />
<br />
It&#39;s not long before Mary feels the intense pressure build in his balls.. He speeds up his stroking and bucks wildly as it turns to orgasm. His hips buck hard against the ground as his seed splatters across the room&#39;s floor. A strand of Mary&#39;s semen lands of the purple dragoness&#39;s right leg. Tentatively, picks up the strand with a claw and laps it up with her left head. The flavor is intoxicating to her. She savor it and watches the blue dragon man that was once her daughter continually relieve himself. Finally, his orgasm dies down, and she feels brave enough to saunter over to the powerful dragon.<br />
<br />
Mary  closes his eyes. The pure ecstasy is too much, and his penis is still erect and throbbing while covered in cum. All four eyes of the dragoness hydra herself cannot keep off his penis, and she goes to the other side of the dragon to get a better look. In Mary&#39;s mind, he considers how much he enjoyed blowing his load. He thinks how much he would enjoy blowing his load inside another dragon. He peeks an eye at the hydra creature standing over him, considering his options.</p>
