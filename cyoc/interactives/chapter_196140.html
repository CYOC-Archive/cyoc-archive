<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty burped happily as he strolled to the bus stop, breakfast number two sitting comfy in his stomach. He kept thinking of how shocked Mark looked before he left; his jerk foster dad didn&#39;t even give him a budget, just handed over his credit card.<br />
<br />
Although, Ty thought with a wince and a wriggle. If his size sixteen sandals were barely staying on, who knows how much new ones were going to cost? Or where he&#39;d get them. There was a plus size store at the mall, right?<br />
<br />
&quot;Dang,&quot; Ty&#39;s ears perked as he heard a familiar voice drawl nearby. &quot;I swear every time I see that guy he&#39;s bigger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grinning, Ty turned toward his school friends, Peter and Jake. He couldn&#39;t wait to see their faces.<br />
<br />
Their faces looked alarmed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh,&quot; Jake, the bigger of the two, stepped forward a bit and stood in front of Pete. &quot;Sorry dude, he didn&#39;t mean anything by it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pete nodded fast, eyes wide. Ty frowned, confused, as his two best friends almost shivered when he looked at them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, you guys okay?&quot; Ty asked. &quot;I mean, I know I&#39;ve grown a bit, but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry!&quot; Pete said quickly. &quot;I mean, I really didn&#39;t mean anything, and I know the senior class this year will be glad to have you playing... well, anything, but - &quot;<br />
<br />
Ty lost track of Pete&#39;s rambling as he realized HE HAD WISHED HIMSELF SEVENTEEN.<br />
<br />
His best friends were still fifteen, and they weren&#39;t in the same class anymore. They weren&#39;t his best friends anymore!<br />
<br />
Numbly, Ty climbed onto the bus alone, feeling his friends stare at him until he was gone. He squeezed his way to an empty seat, and pawed his cell phone out of his pocket. He didn&#39;t say anything for a few blocks, instead he just looked at phone pictures of him with a bunch of strangers. People he knew he could remember if he wanted, if he left his old friends behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I was fifteen,&quot; he whispered, and closed his eyes.<br />
<br />
His phone range. Fumbling a bit, Ty answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude!&quot; Pete&#39;s voice blared in his ear. &quot;Why didn&#39;t you wait for us? We almost made it to the bus; now we&#39;ll have to meet you at the mall later! I can&#39;t BELIEVE you&#39;re still growing, it&#39;s SO unfair. You&#39;re like some kind of mutant, jeez!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pete?&quot; Ty asked, his voice cracking a bit. &quot;Um... sorry.&quot; He really was, for almost losing him.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fine dude,&quot; Jake called softly through the phone. &quot;Um, you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine.&quot; Ty said quickly, clearing his throat. &quot;I think it&#39;s my voice, that&#39;s all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?&quot; Pete yelled in the background.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, man.&quot; Jake said quickly. Ty heard scuffling noises like his friends were fighting over the phone. &quot;We&#39;ll see you in an hour or something. Food court?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ty laughed, and rubbed his eyes. &quot;Yeah, I&#39;ll see you guys there.&quot;<br />
<br />
The three said goodbye and Ty tucked away his phone, which was a bit easier since his shorts had gotten a bit baggier and his hands a bit smaller. Ty hummed, and heard his voice was definitely a bit higher.<br />
<br />
The weird thing was that he wasn&#39;t... small. He&#39;d wished to be fifteen, but he was NOT his original size. It was like all of the things his last wishes changed stayed, or mixed together. He had the same clothes, but they weren&#39;t painted on since he was less bulky. He was maybe a bit shorter. He had the same giant sandals and they were still too small, but less?<br />
<br />
Whatever. He&#39;d figure this out, and at least he had his friends back!<br />
<br />
Ty&#39;s phone rang again; it was June.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t spend any extra money.&quot; His foster mom snapped into the phone the SECOND Ty answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hello, mother, yes I&#39;m doing great. How are you? I love how you care so much.&quot; Ty was WAY better at sarcasm with a voice closer to his original. He&#39;d take the win!<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t sass me. And don&#39;t use our credit card for anything but clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, okay!&quot; He tried to chirp but his voice did NOT do that anymore. &quot;So I&#39;ll need bigger sandals, probably some socks. My shorts kind of pinch a little too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No they don&#39;t.&quot; June argued.<br />
<br />
No they didn&#39;t, Ty agreed in his head. Then winced as suddenly yes they DID.<br />
<br />
Ty tugged at his waistband as it pulled at him; with a wriggle they sat better again but they weren&#39;t baggy, did he just wish that?<br />
<br />
&quot;They, uh, really are.&quot; Ty said cautiously. That wasn&#39;t a wish...<br />
<br />
&quot;Well maybe skip thirds at dinner for a while.&quot; June snapped in his ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not fat!&quot; Ty squawked, then blushed as half the bus stared at him yelling at his phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well what then?&quot; June demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...&quot; Ty winced as he got a wedgie in the WORST way. Oh... June was annoyed about the clothes and it was affecting his growth! Ty could feel a little of his old heaviness come back to his abs, his back, his...<br />
<br />
&quot;Not THAT!&quot; Ty yelped, blushing bright red and pulling at the front of his shorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t say anything!&quot; June snapped. No but clearly she thought it, Ty thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what, just get what you need, but we WILL be checking your old clothes when you get home and we&#39;re sending anything you didn&#39;t need back!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty fidgeted in his seat and stared at his phone. She&#39;d hung up. Probably for the best; any more arguing about his shorts and he&#39;d probably have torn something. Blushing, Ty peeked down and thought about his options; his stop was coming soon and he was NOT standing up looking like... THAT.<br />
<br />
As quietly as he could, Ty mumbled out &quot;I wish I was a grower&quot;. Ty looked around as his face heated up even more; why did June&#39;s mind go THERE of all places; he looked almost indecent!<br />
<br />
... and nothing was happening. Ty mentally reviewed his wish, only to go a bit bug-eyed. REALLY?<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s an alarming update I&#39;ll have to check on later,&quot; he mumbled, and then cleared his throat as he heard his voice crack again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I, uh, I wish my shorts fit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally, a simple straightforward wish and his demon wedgie was gone. And in theory he had a future in porn, if he was a grower compared to THAT.<br />
<br />
Still a problem for later. For now, Ty had reached the mall, he wasn&#39;t going to get arrested for public indecency or whatever, and his friends were on the way.<br />
<br />
And, he realized as he stood up and wobbled a bit and realized after arguing that he&#39;d had to wish his shorts LONGER, he was apparently still growing. Almost as tall as when he was seventeen, but all arms and legs.<br />
<br />
Yeah... Mark and June were going to be pissed.</p>
