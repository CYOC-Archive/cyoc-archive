<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty was very happy for June. That thanks to Mark, she could have back her merging ability. He was jealous, too. He didn&#39;t normally like to think about his parents having sex, but if what he&#39;d seen this afternoon, and just now, was any indication, they were in for a wild ride. He wanted to do exotic things with Lisa. Or even just mundane things. Anything she wanted!<br />
<br />
At least it&#39;s only a few more days, he thought, but it still felt like an eternity.<br />
<br />
Ty thought about the various ways he&#39;d tried to pass the time the last few evenings, since Lisa&#39;s grounding. He&#39;d made copies of himself, and fucked himself, and while it was better than just ordinary masturbation, and satisfied his physical needs in the same way, it didn&#39;t really make him particularly happy. He wasn&#39;t even sure it was worth going to the effort.<br />
<br />
He was tempted to take the SSD containing Lisa&#39;s four billion pieces, (and June&#39;s fractal pieces) back to Jupiter, and have the supercomputer assemble Lisa again from the pieces. But no, that would both violate his agreement with Lisa&#39;s parents about the consequences of breaking the rule, and it would be unfair to Lisa, to bring another copy of her into existence. It was hard to resist the temptation, but he had to. How could he take his mind off Lisa?<br />
<br />
Maybe when Lisa had transformed herself into the app, shortly after she&#39;d been grounded, she had the right idea. Transformed into app form, a person had little in the way of cares or desires. Lisa had been too careless when she transformed herself, and had not used the precautions they had come up with, so it had caused problems. But maybe Ty should transform himself to app form, with the precautions. It seemed appealing, but yet he didn&#39;t have any more homework that needed doing. He knew he wouldn&#39;t be bored in app form; it wasn&#39;t possible for an app to be bored. But somehow he didn&#39;t feel right about transforming himself into the app just to do... nothing.<br />
<br />
He decided just to doomscroll for a while. He couldn&#39;t even focus on that, as near-mindless an activity as it was. He wanted to see Lisa, to talk to Lisa!<br />
<br />
He decided just to go to bed early. He transformed himself into his mattress topper form, which felt nice even if he didn&#39;t have anyone else, or even a copy of himself, lying on him. In his most basic mattress topper form, he was just a furry, but otherwise featureless, rectangular slab. To prevent any problems like those of Lisa&#39;s app transformation, where her parents couldn&#39;t find her, he made himself able to hear. He didn&#39;t actually manifest ears, because he liked his form being almost featureless. Instead, he gave himself the ability to hear without needing ears.<br />
<br />
Of course, despite wanting to sleep, he couldn&#39;t. His mind insisted on thinking about Lisa. Well, might as well try to think at least a little bit productively, then, he thought. He started trying to think up new transformations that Lisa might be willing to try.<br />
<br />
The last time Ty was brainstorming about transformations, he had thought about transforming her into a car. This still seemed appealing, but unfortunately he didn&#39;t yet have a driver&#39;s license. He was old enough to get a learner&#39;s permit, though, so he decided to talk to his parents about that in the morning. Then he remembered that Lisa had a driver&#39;s license. She didn&#39;t have a car of her own, and usually only drove one of her parent&#39;s cars when one of them asked her to do a favor for them, like pick up something from the grocery store.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s it, Ty thought! Instead of turning Lisa into a car, why don&#39;t I turn myself into a car for Lisa?<br />
<br />
He thought Lisa would probably like the idea, but given the seriousness of the matter, he thought he&#39;d best get both his own parent&#39;s approval, and that of Lisa&#39;s parents. He thought he could convince his parents, but was less sure about Maria and Diego.<br />
<br />
He imagined what it would be like to have Lisa drive him. What kind of car should he be? He liked sports cars, but if he was to be a car for Lisa, he should probably be whatever kind of car she wanted.<br />
<br />
He thought about where they could go. She could drive him to a restaurant. To a movie theater. But then he realized that once she parked him near a destination, he couldn&#39;t transform back to human, in plain sight. That dampened his enthusiasm a bit. But if the weather&#39;s nice, maybe Lisa might enjoy just a drive, just for its own sake. Maybe he should be a convertible! He&#39;d have to ask her.<br />
<br />
Thoughts of being a car, with Lisa driving him, finally gave way to sleep.</p>
