<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tanner had never felt this damned hungry before.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t even care that he&#39;d grabbed up deserts in equal measure to the protein his jock dad had always been nagging at him to eat more of. Hell, it might even put on &quot;bulk weight&quot; that could make him seem bigger, or whatever. Tanner was more interested in his video games, his Dungeons and Dragons games, and his card games. Tanner and his dad frequently had their arguments about what Tanner liked vs. what his dad expected a man to be like. It did not help that Tanner was as it was not exactly an exemplar of the kind of masculinity his dad preferred.<br />
<br />
Tanner was tall, thin and wiry, whereas his dad blatantly showed favoritism to the more muscular and typically macho younger brother Will. Will was everything Tanner wasn&#39;t - muscular, somewhat more stout at five foot ten instead of six foot three, and with a more robust and compact build in comparison to Tanner feeling like a strong gust could probably blow him over.<br />
<br />
Tanner wore polo shirts and sweat pants, whereas Will preferred sleeveless shirts and shorts, all the better to show off his &quot;sweet gains&quot; to all the girls at school.<br />
<br />
Tanner had stringy light brown hair and grey eyes, whereas Will was a dyed in the wool blond jock with darker, more blue eyes more akin to their mother&#39;s. At the very least---<br />
<br />
Will took a seat just across from Tanner and looked at the large plate packed full of food, whistling, &quot;Whew big bro, that&#39;s a lot of food, don&#39;t overfill yourself, you know...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not trying to catch up to you,&quot; Tanner grumbled, &quot;And you don&#39;t need to sit by me...&quot; Tanner didn&#39;t like sitting by his meathead brother. Guy always imposed and tried to be the solution for all of Tanner&#39;s woes.<br />
<br />
As Tanner dug into his food, realizing the 12 chicken wings were maybe a bit much in addition to those slices of beef, he started to feel more like eh, it wasn&#39;t so bad. He didn&#39;t see Will&#39;s eyes following his body. The chest that was pushing out to breath was starting to not go back down as far. Pectorals that were once totally flat began to grow and push out as Tanner ate his food. The chicken sliding down his throat tasted really good, so Tanner started to dig in.<br />
<br />
He found himself having to adjust his arms and shoulders a bit - not realizing that those were growing, larger and larger, triceps and biceps fighting with lats for room, pushing out his stance. His shoulders broadened out on all three flanks of the front, lateral and rear deltoid. His back developed width and strength, and he grunted audibly as his glutes pushed out suddenly, the sheer sensation of the suddenly tight pants on his ass giving Tanner a very pressing situation in the front of his pants.<br />
<br />
Will tried to speak up after feeling like he was just awkwardly sitting there, &quot;Uh...Tanner...umm...&quot;<br />
<br />
Tanner kept eating, by now on his eighth chicken wing and fourth slice of beef, not realizing he had grown just yet, &quot;Yeah, Will? What is it? Something wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
More like something right. Will felt like saying, but he was again left unable to really explain what he was seeing. He just saw his brother absolutely pack on muscle and size. Six foot three was already a strong height and so when Tanner began exploding with size, it only brought out the good look his height already afforded him. &quot;You&#39;re...uh...&quot; Will tried to say, &quot;You&#39;re growing bigger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tanner stopped and frowned at his brother, &quot;Are you making fun of me, man? I---Me? Growing bigger? Is this some...jock joke? Are your friends gonna jump out and say---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No way man!&quot; Will gestured at Tanner&#39;s body, &quot;Like...look at yourself!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tanner figured he could just humor his brother, and did indeed look at himself, and stopped in the midst of bringing up another chicken wing. He was a totally different man from the one who sat down. He was rippling with strong, towering musculature, his traps were getting ready to shred his polo, and his pants were strained by an ass he swore was taking up most of his seat and legs that looked like tree trunks. He fingered his quad and quivered with pleasure as he felt it flex and keep form.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m...I&#39;m fucking buff.&quot; Tanner whispered to himself, and then he started to chuckle, followed by a long laugh, &quot;Ahah! I---me, Tanner Landry, I&#39;m buff!&quot; He started to wonder what did that to him even as he flexed and enjoyed the feeling of his polo sleeves tearing and the back of his shirt ripping from the pressure of his back and rear delts. He then looked at the food, &quot;I...I think its the food...ohh yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
He sat down, wanting to continue eating what he already got, he wondered what the six slices of cake would do to him. And he still had plenty of meat. If he had to guess he was about 225 lbs by now...<br />
<br />
Will just watched his big brother looking and salivating at the remaining food, wondering if he should try and stop his brother before he went too far...or just go ahead and help himself to some food too...</p>
