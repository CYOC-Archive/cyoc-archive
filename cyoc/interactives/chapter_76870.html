<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You don't know us at all,&quot; Night spoke up in a much calmer voice then any of us had so far managed.<br />
<br />
 Her voice was calm and firm. It still carried the heavy growling tone that came with the transformation, but she was no longer howling/roaring/screaming that came along with either the pain or pleasure of transformation, depending on how long one had been a werewolf, apparently.<br />
<br />
Devon turned to look toward Night and Terri who had recovered from the intense level of arousal that transforming had brought on them.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know full well that Terrrrrrrrrri neverrrrrrrrrrrrrrr stopped loving him,&quot; Night said slowly, &quot;it's why she asked to brrrrrrrrrrrrring him in. And need I rrrrrrrrrrrrrremind you that you came to me while I was in a &quot;bad place...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you followed,&quot; Devon growled back regaining some composure in his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... but then, I neverrrrrrr knew you werrrrrrrrrrre werrrrrrrrrrrrewolves,&quot; Night answered, &quot;I thank you forrrrrrrrrrrrr the strrrrrrrrrrrength and beauty it brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrought on, but that has nothing to do with whom Terrrrrrrri and love.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we love John,&quot; Terri said firmly.<br />
<br />
I watched as an angry scowl went over Devon's muzzle.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we both know that you intend to punish Terrrrrrrrrrri forrrrrrrrrrrr biting John and possibly me forrrrrrrrrr not stopping herrrrrrrrrrrr orrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr not rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrratting herrrrrrrrrrr out,&quot; Night finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;You arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrre still MINE,&quot; Devon growled, this time more threatening, as Jenna moved to a position where she could keep Terri and Night from helping me if a fight did come.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not if you divide Fangton,&quot; Night answered, &quot;Let Terrrrrrrrrrrri, John, and I go, give us half the city and we won't botherrrrrrrrrrrrrrr you.<br />
<br />
&quot;And weaken my standing?!&quot; Devon growled back, &quot;I'll kill him and beat you!&quot;<br />
<br />
I gave a very threatening growl at that, &quot;You kill ANOTHERRRRRRRRRRRRRR perrrrrrrrrrrson, and I'll kill you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This game of yours will only give you trrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrouble,&quot; Night answered, moving closer to Terri, &quot;The police arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrre alrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrready hunting you and Jenna... as well as the secrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrretarrrrrrrrrrrrrrry you had helping you commit the murrrrrrrrrrrrrrderrrrrrrrrrrrrrr this morrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrning. You may escape tonight, but they will catch up with you eventually, especially if you stay in Fangton, and when that happens, you could be shot and killed, especially if you fight...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that will happen regardless of whetherrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr orrrrrrrrrrrrr not you kill John,&quot; Terri added.<br />
<br />
Devon gave a very angry snarl, some of the she-wolves that were initially supportive of him during the transformation process seemed to begin to question him. He then turned on me and gave an even more angry growl and rushed at me.<br />
<br />
&quot;THIS IS ALL YOURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR FAULT!&quot; he roared and slashed at me with his claws.<br />
<br />
I managed to block the attack with my right arm, and gave a pained whine as I felt his claws cut through my fur and flesh there, but I did manage to avoid getting worse than that. However, I had no boxing training, and my general plan if a fight was to break out was to rush him and hopefully incapacitate him in some way, and given the size of penis and testicles, even while protected by a furry sheath, my only real idea was to knee or kick him in the groin. And my lack of any real fighting skills came back to bite me, as Devon used my block of his slash to then land a powerful blow to the back of my head with his other fist as he went by me. It didn't knock me out, but I was knocked to the ground and in an awkward position. As he turned back to me, I could hear him snickering now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh... typical frrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreshie,&quot; Devon snickered, &quot;all barrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrk, no bite.&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked up to see that Jenna had somehow managed to wrestle Terri and Night into some sort of headlock that blocked them from coming to my add.<br />
<br />
&quot;What girrrrrrrrrrrrls and see what happens to those who brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreak the rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrules,&quot; Jenna growled to them.<br />
<br />
That only made me snarl again and I rolled over to get ready for Devon's next attack. I watched as he began to leap at me, but he never made it. A flash of sandy blond fur hit him in the shoulder and sent him skidding along the ground away from me, and his assailant, who turned out to be none other than his own daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tonya?!?&quot; Devon gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daddy... you KILLED someone?!&quot; Devon's daughter, Tonya asked, looking a little bit angry, but more betrayed/disappointed than anything else.<br />
<br />
&quot;She was unimporrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrtant,&quot; Devon answered, &quot;and a lesson.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A lesson forrrrrrrrrrr what?&quot; Tonya asked, &quot;If she was going to expose us, the Council will forrrrrrrrrrrrrgive you and assist in yourrrrrrrrrrrr legal defense. But if it was just to attack a frrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreshie's frrrrrrrrrrrrrrrriend and prrrrrrrrrrrrrrrove yourrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr dominance, they won't help you or this pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He is a thrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreat!&quot; Devon got back to his feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Afterrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr that fight, I doubt it, daddy,&quot; Tonya answered, standing firmly before her father, &quot;You want to make him, Terrrrrrrrrrrrrrri, and Night, subordinate to you... fine... but not attacking an innocent old woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How...?&quot; Devon began to ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;I came home frrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrom school and find the police looking forrrrrrrrrrrrr you and saying why they werrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrre,&quot; Tonya answered, &quot;and that is too much, and I've had enough, daddy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrre you doing?!&quot; Devon demanded, looking at some of the more questioning looks he was receiving from many of the other she-wolves, &quot;you'rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrre defending him? Embarrrrrrrrrrrrrrassing me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm taking a stand,&quot; Tonya answered, &quot;Maybe one I should have taken when you chased Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrian away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop this NOW!&quot; Devon roared at her, &quot;I am yourrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr fatherrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr! Yourrrrrrrrrrrr Alpha!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can go farrrrrrrrrrrrrrtherrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr,&quot; Tonya gave confident smile, &quot;totally wrrrrrrrrrrrrrreck the image you've made forrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr the pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You wouldn't darrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrre,&quot; Devon growled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep this fight up, and find out,&quot; Tonya answered.<br />
<br />
And to my great surprise, Devon backed down. Tonya was even smaller than me, and she managed to get Devon, who was easily bigger than me, to back down. It seemed she knew some secret about Devon that he wanted to hide and didn't want shared. I wasn't about ask, though, as it was helping me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrright,&quot; Devon backed down, &quot;what do you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Divide Fangton on Night's request and declarrrrrrrrrrrrrrre herrrrrrrrrrr the Alpha Female of the new Pack,&quot; Tonya answerrrrrrrrrrrrrrred, &quot;Herrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr pack's terrrrrrrrrrrrrrritorrrrrrrrry must include Terrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrri's fatherrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr's mansion and yard, the park nearrrrrrrrrrrrrr it, Terrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrri's aparrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrtment, Night's aparrrrrrrrrrrtment, John's aparrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrtment and access to the woods and lands on theirrrrrrrrrrrrrrr half of Fangton.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But...&quot; Devon began.<br />
<br />
&quot;Orrrrrrrrrrrr...&quot; Tonya said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine! Fine! The fourrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr of you can have yourrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr half of Fangton,&quot; Devon grunted, sounding like he didn't like it, but accepting it because he'd been pushed into a corner he couldn't or didn't want to fight out of.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fourrrrrrrrrrrrrrr?&quot; Tonya questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;You go with them,&quot; Devon said coldly, &quot;I will not be betrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrayed again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tonya turned to me, gave a short sigh, and then said, &quot;Fine. At least I won't be literrrrrrrrrrally fucking my own family anymorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrre.&quot;</p>
