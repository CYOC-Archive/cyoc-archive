<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A candle. A single vanilla-white slim tall candle with no label. Mike picked up the candle, &quot;Ok that was weird, but hey free candle.&quot; He smelled it. Farm animals. Specifically sheep. It smelled nice, an aroama of clean wool and fresh cut grass. Mike&#39;s parents were gone so he thought he could light it in his room since he was going to be in there anyway. So he want up and got a spot ready for the candle.<br />
<br />
Mike loved being in just his underwear when he was home alone. He thought he felt more free and graceful. So he striped down, lit the candle, and got to work while the candle&#39;s scent filled the room. Little did he know, he had activated a grand spell that would change his life forever...<br />
<br />
The first change was his personality. Normally, Mike is very energetic, bouncy, and aware of his surroundings, but now he was calm, blissful. Then he noticed a discolored spot on his hand. A grey spot, almost shaped like splatered ink. It suddenly spread across his entire body making it a dark shade of grey. Mike stayed strangely calm, even getting happy at the changes. When the wave of color got to his cock, it began to throb. Not painfully, but almost horny-ly as his penis and testicals retracked into his crotch, leaving him with a warm, wet slit. A vagina. HER vagina. A vagina, just waiting for a dick to fill her disires...<br />
<br />
Next, Mike looked at her hands and feet. Her fingers had become stiff and began to fuse together, turning from normal human hands to three-digited, rock-hard fingered, anthro &quot;hoof-hands.&quot; Her feet became full hoofs, causing her to lose balance for just a moment. Then Mike begane to gain weight. Quickly. Her belly ballooned out until it was patruding about 2 inches farther than here chest, her ass and thighs defining her behind as well as her new gender. Bigger. Bigger. Bigger. Until...SNAP! Mike looked down and saw that the waistband snaped in two, but the rest of her underwear was (mostly) intact, and her thighs were holding it up any way. Mike&#39;s hair began to change as it became longer, thicker, curlier, softer. Soon it became sheeps wool, 3 inches thick. Then, a sensation occured at the tail bone, as a short, soft, fluffy sheep tail popped out of her spine. This snapped a few threads in her underwear, making it ever so slighty looser. Then the wool grew all over her body, 3 inches thick, only stopping a the knees, elbows, her face, and strangely a spot just above her vagina. Mike&#39;s underwear took a toal from all of this. There were tears on ether side, going all the way down, with only a few threads each. Then that spot above her genitals began to grumble...<br />
<br />
After a few moments, Mike felt lustful pressure just under her belly button. The spot became cream-colored as it grew outward filling with liquid. The mound of flesh pushed against the underwear, it finally it could take no more abuse. With a final rip, her bloomers ripped clean in two, leaving Mike without human cloths, which she didn&#39;t care anymore. After all, she was all ready wearing nature&#39;s clothes anyway. As the mound continued to grow, it grew nipples the grew bigger, and bigger, becoming 2 inches in diameter, and 3 inches in length. Teats. As the heap of flesh and fat stopped at the size (and weight) of a boaling ball, Mike looked down to behold what had grow. A large, fat, soft sheep udder, begging for attention. But as she went to carress the large, creamy mound, a strange sensation, along with a few cracking and popping sounds brought her &quot;hoof-hands&quot; to her face. Not pain, but odd nonetheless as her nose, jar, mouth, and teeth shifted out of her face, forming a 5 inch muzzle, as her ears elonggated into fluffy, floppy sheep ears. To top it all of, a few jet black freckles appeared on her grey face, leaving her face slightly ticklish...<br />
<br />
Mike looked down at her knew form. A chubby, fluffy, anthro sheep with an udder and freckles to boot. She fell in love with her form almost instantly. She looked over were she placed the candle respossible for her transformation. It was gone, reduced to a mere puddle of wax, it&#39;s scent gone , but new smells filled Mike&#39;s now more sensitive nose. The smell of clean wool from her armpits and chest. The faint fragrent of sheep milk from her udder. The scent of fresh-cut grass on her breath. She walked (or more waddled thanks to her udder) to the full body mirror in her &quot;mom&#39;s&quot; room. She massaged her thighs, then her ass, but when she got to her udder, she entered a trance of pure bliss. When she finally came back to her sences, she had fallen on her butt with a pool of woman fluids beneath her. As Mike got up, a thought appeared in her head. Her &quot;parents&quot; would not approve of her form. &quot;Those ugly, dumb humans won&#39;t accept my grace.&quot; She said aloud, the she smirked. &quot;Then they wouldn&#39;t have to.&quot; She snuck out the back door and ran away snickering the whole way...<br />
<br />
Mike, after hours of running, came to an abandoned barn. It was newer, so it was probibly build and never owned. She went inside the barn house to look for a milking machine. Her udder had grown rounder, and heavier. It needed to be milked, and fast! Euika, there was one. She plugged herself in and almost passed out from the sheer pleasure. It only took a few minutes, since the milking machine was good quality, and also it hadn&#39;t been used before. Mike went into the residental house and got herself confortable...<br />
<br />
The door bell rang, startling Mike, or &quot;Sophia&quot; as she renamed herself. She got up from the kitchen table and answered the door. It was him. The Alchemist. &quot;Oh hello!&quot; Sophia said with joy, &quot;I never got a chance to say thank you for this perfect, sexy, new body!&quot; The man chuckled. &quot;Glad to hear it. I have come to give you another gift. But it&#39;s a surprise.&quot; Just as before, with a flash of light, the Alchemist was gone. And just as before, there was something at the door step. Sophia looked at it with exicitment. It was a...</p>
