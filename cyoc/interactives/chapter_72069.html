<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In truth, Olivia didn't wear the either the board shorts or the tank top when she got home because the moment she stepped through the door, her mother was once again on her about either getting a job or starting college. And in a fit of frustration, Olivia stormed off to her room.<br />
<br />
After slamming the door, she began to pace back and forth in her room, stopping long enough to throw the two items she'd just purchased into the nearby laundry hamper. When she felt herself starting to calm down, she threw herself down on her bed and forgetting for the moment about the two pieces of clothing, she stared off at nothing, thinking about other things.<br />
<br />
Deciding on a course of action, Olivia stood and hastily exited her room. Heading back downstairs, she stopped when her mother intercepted her and started in. Snapping at her, &quot;Back off. I'm going over to the community college to see what courses they have to offer,&quot; Olivia grabbed a few things before storming out the door.<br />
<br />
Hours later she returned, carrying information she'd not only picked up at the community college, but also the two larger universities. Not seeing her mother or her father, Olivia breathed a sigh that she wouldn't have to deal with either at the moment. Dropping the various papers and pamphlets on a nearby end table, Olivia headed for the kitchen, where she found a note from her mother reminding Olivia of the plans for dinner at some fancy restaurant celebrating her parents' anniversary.<br />
<br />
Crumpling up the note, Olivia tossed the note into the recycling bin and grabbing something to drink from the fridge, she headed for her room. Picking up her dirty laundry, Olivia headed for the laundry room in the basement. When she had her dirty clothes sorted and a load started, she headed back upstairs.<br />
<br />
Half an hour later her mother returned home carrying something from the dry-cleaners. Busy with getting ready, Olivia accepted the dress her mother handed her without a thanks and thinking how much she hated wearing a dress, she told her mother, &quot;I went to the local community college and the two larger universities and got some information,&quot; as she turned and headed back to her room. There, she draped the dress over the chair in front of her vanity and headed for the basement to switch out her laundry.<br />
<br />
Dinner, in Olivia’s opinion, was a complete fiasco. Instead of leaving her alone, he father started in on her about what college she should go to and what subjects she should take. And than her mother joined in and by the end of dinner, Olivia was so frustrated she flat refused to talk to either her mother or her father, instead relying on short, noncommittal answers to voice what she had to say.<br />
<br />
Home, she still refused to talk to her parents in full sentences and after washing off the bit of make-up she was wearing and stripping off her dress, which she left hanging on the back of the bathroom door, Olivia slipped into a night-shirt and flopped down on her bed.<br />
<br />
Wondering why it was that her parents were making such a big fuss, she shifted about and after a bit had her underwear off. Tossing the undergarment in the direction of the laundry bin, she listened as it fell short, landing instead on the floor somewhere. Turning on her side, Olivia drew her knees up and wondered what her life would be like if she had been born male.<br />
<br />
But even this subject was driven from her mind within three days. Between her parents constantly going off about college, they had at least let up on the issue of a job, and Olivia getting her monthly about three days later, she really had no time to dwell on the subject of what it would be like to be male. Nor did she remember the shorts and shirt she’d bought and for a while, they sat on the bottom of her dresser drawer, forgotten for the moment.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
It was about three weeks later, the carnival had left roughly eleven days previous, when Olivia decided that she wanted to go through her clothes and give away what she didn’t wear anymore. As she began this task, she thought about how she’d finally given into her parent’s demands and signed up at the Fiat University with an undecided major and how she had a placement test in about two weeks.<br />
<br />
Pulling out a handful of bras, she stuffed the items back in the drawer, thought, “Probably keep my underwear, socks and bras,” and opening the next drawer, she began going through the shirts.<br />
<br />
When she came to the drawer with her pants, she paused when she withdrew the board shorts. Staring at them, she wondered why it was that she’d bought them in the first place, having never really bought any clothes for the opposite sex before. Forgetting about the tank top, which had she decided to keep and had folded back up and placed in the drawer with her shirts, Olivia stood and headed over to the full-body mirror her mother had insisted on buying for her.<br />
<br />
Holding the shorts up in front of her, Olivia noted that they would probably stop just below her knees. Shucking off her pants, she thought for a moment before removing her underwear and pulling on the board shorts, which she noted did stop just below her knees.<br />
<br />
As she turned about, she thought that they did look cute on her and that they were rather comfortable. Turning away from the mirror, she went to her dresser and pulled on a rather baggy shirt. Taking off the shirt she was wearing, Olivia put on the new shirt and standing once again before her mirror, taking off her bra as she did so, she gazed at her reflection, liking how the shirt clearly hid the fact that she had breasts and came down just past the point where he legs began, about a quarter of the way down her thighs.<br />
<br />
Picking up the clothes she just taken off, Olivia tossed them onto her bed. Returning to the task at hand, she began to once again go through her clothes, sorting which to keep and which to give away, failing to notice the odd sensation growing in her abdomen and groin as she did so.<br />
<br />
About two hours later, nearly done with the task, Olivia’s mother called her down to dinner. When she came down, her mother merely glared at what she was wearing, but didn’t say anything. Knowing that he mother didn’t approve, Olivia felt a bit of satisfaction grow within her and deciding that she would keep the shorts, not only because they were comfortable but also because it was clear her mother didn’t approve, Olivia waited until her father was seated before starting to dish herself up.<br />
<br />
When dinner was finally over, thankfully her parents didn’t try and talk to her, Olivia started heading back to her room, but stopped when her mother asked, “Don’t you think you’re a little old to be dressing like a tomboy?”<br />
<br />
Glaring at her mother, Olivia just shrugged and replied, “I don’t know and I don’t really care.”<br />
<br />
Again, he mother pursed her lips and turning, not wanting to hear it, Olivia exited before her father could join her mother’s side and complain about what Olivia was wearing. Back upstairs, she finished sorting her clothes and than flopped down on her bed.<br />
<br />
Staring at the ceiling, Olivia let her thoughts drift, not really settling on one thing or another. After a moment, she stood and decided that she wanted to get ready for bed, but after looking in the mirror, Olivia figured that what she had on was comfortable enough. Turning away from the mirror, she was just about lie back down when she heard somebody knocking on her bedroom door.<br />
<br />
As she opened it, Olivia figured it was either her mother or father and wasn’t surprised when she found herself facing her father, who wanted to talk about her disrespectful attitude toward him and Olivia’s mother. <br />
<br />
After about a half hour, Olivia’s father finally left, leaving Olivia alone. Feeling that what he had to say was only one sided, she wondered why it was that he wouldn’t listen to what she had to say, take in her side of things. Exiting her bedroom, her thoughts whirling about what she’d just been told, Olivia headed for the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Shutting the door, she thought, “Narrow-minded jerk,” as she headed for the toilet and pushing down the shorts she was wearing, she sat down on the toilet.<br />
<br />
It was only shortly after she began peeing that she realised something was off and glancing down, Olivia found herself at odds to explain what she was seeing. Finishing, still trying to come to terms with what she was seeing, Olivia hesitantly reaching down at touched the growth that now occupied what had been all her life smooth, flat skin.<br />
<br />
Elation erupted through her and than she came down and wondered how she had grown such a thing and standing, she pulled up her shorts, washed her hands and headed back to her room. Inside, she shut and locked her door and hastily looking about, Olivia located the roll of measuring tape for sewing. Stripping off both her shirt and shorts, she stood nude in front of her mirror, thinking it looked odd that she had both breasts and a penis and set of testicles, but also thinking that her male genitals were rather small.<br />
<br />
Curious, she took the tape and measured her new genitals, even more curious when she discovered that her neo-penis was only 1.7 inches long. Thinking, “I’ve got a little boy’s genitals,” she let her gaze wander back to the mirror.<br />
<br />
Again, the feeling of elation came over and than vanished as she was confronted on how this would affect her life and how it had happened. Pulling back on the shorts, noting how her little penis and testicles felt when the interior mesh lining felt when it brushed up against them, she wondered how it was that she missed that sensation and how it was her genitals had moved.<br />
<br />
Sticking a hand down her shorts, she confirmed that her original genitals weren’t still between her legs and both happy and confused, she asked herself, “Is it possible for a person to turn into the opposite sex and gender without surgery?” but felt that the answer was something that was out of her reach.</p>
