<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I stretched slightly to try and clear out any kinks that might be in my back. Once done I glanced back at the clock again. It was now late afternoon. I'd slept through most of the day. It was odd, as I hadn't felt all that tired, and to some extent the looming shadow of Darren or Devon he me nervous enough that sleeping wasn't the first thing on my mind. But I'd somehow managed, and now I felt much better. Figuring that since I was feeling better, I ought to go check on Terri and see if Night was still there. As when they were last in the room, they were talking about calling the local Alpha to tell them the story Terri and I had generated as an excuse for Terri to leave, Night to follow, and for him to allow me to be a werewolf in his territory.<br />
<br />
A good part of me was still willing to fight him for having sex with Terri, and at present that part actually felt stronger now, but the warning that he would even stronger then I was, was enough to keep that part of my mind in check. As I made it to the doorway, the scent of meat and two female werewolves drifted to my nostrils. My senses had been noticeably stronger since when I'd first woken up after being bitten. Waking up next to Terri and apparently smelling the wolf in her. I figured it may be getting stronger, now, though, as it was getting closer to sunset and then I'd only have hours until I transformed for the first time.<br />
<br />
It probably wouldn't happen at sunset, as Terri and I had been watching movies before she changed and it wasn't until after the sun had completely disappeared that she began to change. Though, I also had to admit to myself, that I was fairly distracted by either the movie or by how sexual Terri was being at the time. Shoot, time almost had no meaning during the nights when we'd had our flings. She was even aroused by watching the transformation scene in American Werewolf in London. As I thought on it, it had to have shown that her life was different then what it was, and how my life would soon be just as different as hers.<br />
<br />
I felt myself becoming aroused at the thought of that, and I soon paused and began to try and get &quot;little John&quot; to stay down. I didn't want to come off as a pervert... or at least not as a complete pervert.<br />
<br />
&quot;You needn't worry about that,&quot; came Terri's voice, &quot;this time of the month, we're all feeling that way. Expecting the change... longing for it... anticipating it... lusting for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
I then looked up to see her standing in the doorway with a large platter with steaks on it. Night was behind her with couple of individual folding tables under one arm, and a bag with what smelled like potatoes in it in the other. Both of them smelled amazing, but for the moment he was drawn more to the food they had brought with them.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're having dinner here?&quot; I asked without thinking.<br />
<br />
&quot;To allow you to relax and yet your inner wolf develop,&quot; Terri answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks like you've cooked enough for nine people,&quot; I commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll need a lot of it,&quot; Night spoke up, &quot;this is more then just a change in form. It can be a drastic change in lifestyle. Terri and I... and now you... NEED the meat. Otherwise, you'd go nuts and potentially eat someone or accidentally bite and infect someone at random as your body strives to replace the energy burned transforming. Didn't Terri tell you this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She did,&quot; I nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you understand that this is to make sure that we don't go on a rampage tonight, or at least to try to get it to the point that even if we need red meat we can be somewhat &quot;civil&quot; about getting it,&quot; Night answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like hunting deer and stuff like that?&quot; I asked, almost sounding eager.<br />
<br />
&quot;Possibly, though we'd need to leave town before that could be done,&quot; Night answered, &quot;In the short term it would mean getting to Terri's father's meat locker and eating what's in there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; was all I could answer as Night entered and began to set up the folding tables.<br />
<br />
As I watched, it seemed to me that both Night and Terri were teasing me somehow. Every sway of their hips went as if they were trying to get a rise out of me. Likely a sign of the wolf in me getting stronger.<br />
<br />
&quot;And since you went back to sleep and slept all day, you'll need even more as you've missed lunch,&quot; Terri answered as she set the platter of meat down on the center table, which I noticed was set near the edge of the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; I said weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's alright,&quot; Terri gave a knowing smile, &quot;It let you recover more and let you get stronger...&quot;<br />
<br />
Terri approached me and sniffed at my neck deeply while pushing her breasts into my chest. I had all I could do to keep myself from raising my hand to rub her chest through the fabric of the shirt she was wearing.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I can smell it, your wolf is almost ready,&quot; Terri said in an almost seductive voice, &quot;almost ready to come out... to mate with me and Night... to be with us... and prepare for the creating of a new pack in Fangton. I can't wait for tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Neither can I,&quot; I said back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy there, both of you,&quot; Night cut in, &quot;as good as he smells now and as close as he is to transforming naturally, we do not want to stimulate him into transforming early.&quot;<br />
<br />
Terri backed off for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; she said to me, &quot;I'm just so excited about tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
I slowly nodded, &quot;Where do you want me to sit?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right there in the middle,&quot; Night answered, &quot;the both of us will need you tonight and you do smell good. Far better then this morning...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You smell much better too, either that or my senses are still getting stronger,&quot; I commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're all getting close to the time to change,&quot; Night said with a smile, &quot;our wolf scents are growing stronger.&quot;<br />
<br />
I couldn't help but smile at that, and then moved to sit down I looked that the meat had been divided between the platter on mine and plates that were on Terri's and Night's. Night had also placed a baked potato on each, and there was a small tub of margarine or butter on one of the folding tables.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll go back for the glasses,&quot; Terri then spoke, &quot;Sorry it's nothing fancy tonight, but water would probably be best while you're getting ready for your first transformation, John.&quot;<br />
<br />
She was gone like a flash, but it wasn't too long before she returned holding three large cups of water. Night was quick to help distribute them. It was either an early dinner or a late lunch, depending on how you looked at it, but it was still a symbol of what would be coming soon. Of course, as I thought about that a bit as I began to eat, I then sighed and remembered the call that Terri and Night made to their Alpha.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how did your phone call go?&quot; I asked.</p>
