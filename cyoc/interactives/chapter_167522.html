<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With a smirk on your face, you decide to make your bid to claim the city. But who will know that you plan to make this city your own if you don&#39;t make the declaration? Those caught in the blizzard you summoned have more than likely frozen solid at this point, but there are still many left sheltered inside of homes and businesses who don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on. They need to be made aware; not just of your presence, but how futile it is to resist. You think for a moment of how to best spread your message, and then get an idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm... The best way to send a message across the city in this modern day and age...?&quot; You muse, &quot;...Well, I guess the best way is to just report the news myself. And what better way to do that then to head to the local news station.&quot;<br />
<br />
With your objective in mind, you take the Tome of Everfrost in hand, and begin your trek to the television station. Of course; the blizzard&#39;s winds and blinding snow do nothing to slow you down as you skate effortlessly across the frozen snow; your icy presence seemingly floating across the surface without disturbing it in the slightest. You are one with the element around you, and though you still have much to learn of your icy powers, that which you are able to do seems to come naturally to you; as if it were instinct.<br />
<br />
Of course, you question the morality of your decision to take control of the city. This blizzard was an accident, after all, and you consider finding a means of at least restraining how much it ravages the city... But those thoughts are cast aside as you stake on past the poor fools who were trapped in this storm; reveling in their frozen forms, and imagining how beautiful they&#39;d all look once you got them onto their pedestals. Perhaps you&#39;d commandeer the local museum for just that purpose?<br />
<br />
Eventually you reach your destination: the Channel 7 news station. It is the largest and most-watched news channel in the city, and if any station would get your message across it would be them. You casually approach the front doors and swing them wide open; startling the people standing in and working the lobby. They all stare at you as you stand there; your icy presence quickly drawing the heat out of the room. You are approached and confronted by security guards who have their guns pointed at you, but they pose no threat as you simply snap your fingers, and their guns and clothes shatter and freeze. They are completely caught by surprise when this happens, but even moreso when you appear in front of the male one and hold him close before planting an icy kiss on him. His cock instantly goes erect as the heat is quickly sucked from his body; rendering him an ice sculpture with a raging boner.<br />
<br />
But you are not done, you turn to the other security guard, a female, and gaze deep into her eyes. As your eyes lock, a powerful spell is cast over her as she suddenly becomes extremely horny. Without question or resistance, she walks over to the frozen man and begins to kiss his frozen lips, just as you had done only moments prior, and slowly but surely mount the ice sculpture; pleasuring herself on its massive frozen member. You smile a sinister, yet seductive smile as you watch the woman slowly fuck herself as she freezes slowly on top of the frozen man, before you walk over to the receptionist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unless you want to end up like them,&quot; You tell her, &quot;You will tell me which way it is to the newsroom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...T-Thirtieth f-f-floor...&quot; The woman shivered in both fear and from the cold, &quot;T-The elevator over t-t-t-there w-w-will take you right up...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, my dear... You have been most helpful. Now for your reward.&quot;<br />
<br />
You point at her, and cast the enslavement spell over her. She shrieks, but her cries of fear soon turn into moans of pleasure as she is changed into an ice elemental just like you; the shackles that you once wore, albeit more refined than those, now clamped to her wrists and neck. You smile, and let your new servant go and have her fun as you head over to the elevator to ride it up.<br />
<br />
As you approach the top floor, the newscasters are reporting on the freak storm as breaking news. The news team was desperately trying to report on the freak storm; cautioning people to remain indoors until the storm passed. Unaware that the storm was magically summoned and would never end... At least not yet.<br />
<br />
The elevator doors open, and you step onto the set. Everyone looks over and sees you, and a commotion starts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; One of the newscasters said, &quot;Who are you? What are you doing here; we&#39;re in the middle of a...&quot;<br />
<br />
But that newcaster didn&#39;t have a chance to finish as he found himself pinned against and frozen to the back wall by an ice blast from you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chill out, anchorman,&quot; You coo; strutting your stuff as you make your way forward, &quot;I&#39;m here to make an important announcement...&quot;<br />
<br />
You turn to face the cameraman and wink at him seductively. &quot;Keep that camera on me, sweetie, and I promise you a nice reward later on.&quot; He simply nods, and instructs the broadcast room to keep the broadcast going as you make your way over to the set, and take the seat next to the Anchorwoman, who is shivering in fear of what just happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do not adjust your television sets, friends,&quot; You start, &quot;For we are interrupting your usual newscast for a very special announcement. My name is... Well, what is in a name, anyway? Shiva, Elsa, Freya, Snowbell... They&#39;d all work, really. But that&#39;s not what&#39;s important right now. You are all probably wondering about this freak snowstorm that is slowly but surely freezing the city solid. Where it came from? How it started? Well, wonder no more... For this storm... is MY doing...&quot;<br />
<br />
You stand up to show a commanding, yet compassionate presence. &quot;Of course, it was never my intent to make this storm so intense or violent. The spell I cast was cast in desperation as the summer sun would have melted me away, and that was the last thing I wanted. But now that I&#39;ve got this blizzard going, I have decided that I want to go a step further... And take control of the city!&quot;<br />
<br />
The people in the newsroom muttered among themselves; scared for what this meant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmhmhm~ I know you are all wondering what this means for you. Well, I assure you that I have no ill intent when I make this claim. But it is not a claim made lightly. I am very powerful. As the keeper of the Tome of Everfrost I have the power to make good on my claims. So... Miss Mayor... If you are watching this, you have 48 hours to surrender control of the city to me. During that time, I shall give you all a reprieve from my storm. However, if you do not surrender within that time, or fail to make any statement, I will intensify the storm a thousand times over; and every living thing in the city will be frozen solid and buried beneath an everlasting blanket of ice and snow forever!&quot;<br />
<br />
You then motion over to the newscaster, &quot;Of course... You know that I am capable of it. And you see what will befall you if you cross me, as this newscaster here now displays... However, I am not without mercy, and anyone who would choose to submit and follow me will be spared my wrath... Observe...&quot;<br />
<br />
You reach over and grab the anchorwoman, who is very surprised at this, and pull her close. As you hold her in your arms, you gaze deeply into her eyes, and she starts to feel strange... Despite the biting cold of your touch she feels... Hot. She begins to pant needily as you lean in, and kiss her deeply on the lips. Almost at once, her skin would turn icy blue, and her hair pure white as her features would be perfected; her clothing flaking off from the intense cold she now radiated; replaced by a shackle around her neck and her hands. The transformation caused the former newscaster to moan in pleasure during the kiss as her mind and her soul became bound to ice and to her new Queen and Mistress. Without skipping a beat; the moment you stop kissing her the newly-born ice elemental begins to finger herself; using one hand to pleasure her sex while the other kneaded her breast.<br />
<br />
&quot;As you can see,&quot; You say, &quot;The transformation is quite pleasurable, and once it is complete you will never fear the cold again. It is certainly a better fate than becoming nothing more than an ice sculpture that is lost to the vast whiteness of my icy realm, now wouldn&#39;t you agree? Fourty eight hours... I will be waiting... Hmhmhm~&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that; the newsroom crew had served their purpose, and so with a snap of her fingers all of them ended up frozen solid. With that bit of fun out of the way, you simply had to wait... But what to do in the meantime?</p>
