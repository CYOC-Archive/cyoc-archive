<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The demon’s sweet voice pierced the silence.  “Jack?  Yes, I believe we found one by that name.  I know where he is being held.  Would you follow me?”<br />
<br />
Alice was excited briefly, then realized this was a demon.  “Why should I trust you?”<br />
<br />
The succubus gave a sneer, and spat to the ground.  “My kin need to ration fluids in this place, and I was chosen to die so that those more important may live.  I hold no love for them, and I owe you my life for saving me.”<br />
<br />
That sounded reasonable enough to Alice.  If she was speaking the truth, this entire nightmare could be over in a matter of minutes.  “Okay.  Lead me to my brother.”<br />
<br />
“Gladly.”  The succubus started walking back in the direction she came from, then nodded back to Alice.  “Follow closely.  In fact, hold onto my tail so we do not get separated.”<br />
<br />
Alice complied, using one hand to keep her now-slack udder from being too unwieldy and using the other to grasp onto the succubus’s tail.  The spade at its end made a decent handle, though it was fairly sharp at its end.  While her hands were calloused from her farm work, she could feel the thin pricks of the tail as the succubus moved forward.<br />
<br />
The travel was largely uneventful.  The succubus briskly guided Alice through numerous corridors, sometimes switching paths to avoid strange noises that were happening down the halls.  <br />
<br />
It hadn’t taken long at all for her udder to completely refill.  What’s worse, it felt even larger than before, but Alice disregarded that as her being forced to keep pace with the less-burdened succubus.<br />
<br />
As the minutes turned to what had to have been close to an hour, Alice decided to speak up.  “I’m sorry, but could we rest?  My udder makes travel a bit exhausting.”<br />
<br />
Her guide smiled in response.  “No need.  We’re just a couple minutes away.  I’ll walk slower for now.”  A few hallways later, the succubus turned to enter a room.  It was fairly large, and devoid of life.  As the succubus passed about the center of the room, she spoke once more.  “Here looks good.”<br />
<br />
Alice could barely get a “what” out before the succubus shoved her to the floor.  She cried out in confusion as she slammed into the floor, her udder placing far more weight into the shove.  In a matter of moments, the succubus hands glowed an unworldly purple and she began tracing lines across Alice’s body “What are you doing?!”<br />
<br />
The succubus was too focused on her actions to answer, but Alice felt a sudden numbness in all four of her limbs, causing her to fall backwards with her udder pinning her down.  She watched in horror as the bones of her limbs liquefied, then pulled back toward her body until she had four orb-like nubs where her arms and legs once were.<br />
<br />
She became aware of a strange tingling sensation from the bottom of her spine as something seemed to extend from it.  It felt somewhat like a tail, but it grew directly into and through the stone floor.  She could feel it rapidly extend and splinter from itself, branching out into an incomprehensible mass of tendrils, continuously splitting more and more until it became like a gigantic network of flesh-tubes.  It was several orders of magnitude larger than her original body if the array of sensations she could feel from it were to be taken seriously.<br />
<br />
The tube then pushed her original body nearly 8 feet into the air.  She turned her head to look at the growth or possibly move it, but became more distracted by the flesh-sacs that remained on her arms.  They jiggled and gained new definition until Alice realized what they were now: breasts!<br />
<br />
Her “tail” then began to pulsate for a few moments, causing a feeling like rushing water to travel along it from each distant extremity, pushing toward her main body.  The fluid continued up the base of her tail until it reached her body, where it transferred into each of her breasts and udder, causing them to balloon in size.   In a matter of seconds, her vision became clouded by mountains of breastflesh and she could feel the boobs attached to her shoulders brush against those from her hips, each at least 3 feet in diameter  The two breasts on her chest were not nearly as extreme, but the udder was another story altogether.  It grew to such mammoth proportions, her rigid tail was forced to bend, causing her to sit upright as the floor supported the massive thing.  The udder was at least 6 feet wide<br />
<br />
As suddenly as it had started, the transformation had seemingly ended.  She could still feel her massive tail, and there was most certainly many gallons more of whatever fluid trapped within each, but it seemed her breasts and udder could grow no more.  Unable to see the succubus from her limited vantage point, Alice cried out between her tears.  “What have you done to me?!”<br />
<br />
The succubus entered from one side, a devious grin across her face.  “Congratulations, you’re a demon now.  As to what kind, my dear, you’re a succubus of my own creation, what I like to call a milk-weed.  Your roots will siphon up the discarded secretions of this dungeon and convert it into sustenance for your body and drinkable milk for others.  As a demon, time has lost its grasp on you.  Death will only come when not a drop of fluid remains in your grasp.  Let me show you what to expect for the rest of your life.”  <br />
<br />
The demon grabbed onto the nipple of the gigantic breast that had replaced Alice’s left arm, and large gouts of milk began to gush onto the floor.  To her horror, she could feel the fluid within her roots slowly feed into the breast, keeping the flow of milk going at such an inhuman rate.</p>
