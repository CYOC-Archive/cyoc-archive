<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I don&#39;t know why you have to act like that,&quot; Krista said sternly. She looked over her friend and was watching Matt warm up. His big strong body was enough to distract just about anyone. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you talking about when you insulted Clay?&quot; Jen asked. &quot;Cause it&#39;s rude Krista. It&#39;s not okay to just call people fat. And besides most of it&#39;s muscle anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
Krista rolled her eyes. &quot;Sure it is...&quot; She wasn&#39;t about to get in this argument again. Jen would just ask her if she liked it when guys called her fat. And of course the answer was no but she wasn&#39;t fat so it&#39;s not like it even mattered. That&#39;s why she went to the gym so often. And to check out the other guys.<br />
<br />
Her attention still focused on Matt though. She couldn&#39;t get over the way his big muscles moved to keep him going. Thick arms pumping at his sides as he kept up a pretty good pace. He pulled out something that looked like his phone and started typing into it. &#39;Probably looking for his favorite tunes,&#39; she was fawning over him if even from a distance. &quot;That&#39;s a real man for you,&quot; she said again as he shoved the device back in his pocket.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever,&quot; Jen stated. &quot;Are we going to workout or are you going to stare at Matt all day?&quot;<br />
<br />
The question drew her out of her fantasy. &quot;Workout,&quot; she said as she grabbed two of the ten pound weights. However as she did the bicep curls she couldn&#39;t help but notice the weight was far too light. She was normally going for toning her body so she preferred more reps to weight. But even now it felt like the weight was too light. She set them down and picked up the fifteens. <br />
<br />
&quot;You feeling alright?&quot; Jen asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, the weights just don&#39;t feel right,&quot; she said back. Jen just stared at her skeptically. But even these felt too light. It was like there was almost no resistance even as she picked them up. &#39;What the Hell..?&quot; she thought to herself. She looked over at the 20&#39;s and tried those.<br />
<br />
&quot;You going to warm up all the weights?&quot; Jen mocked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Krista looked at her friend oddly. Jen rarely ever teased her about something like this. But this felt different.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Jen added. There was even more sass as she said it. &quot;You&#39;re the one messing with all the weights Kris. Don&#39;t act like I&#39;m the one being weird while you mess with these &#39;light weights&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
Krista laughed. But realized she didn&#39;t understand why it was funny. 20 pounds used to be too heavy for her even for one set. Using the atlas stones was way more fun. &#39;Wait. What?&#39; she asked herself. &#39;How do I know what an atlas stone is?&#39; Her hand went to her chin and rubbed through her beard. &#39;Why would I know about that...?&#39; The soft bristles tickled her hand. She stopped rubbing her chin and looked in the mirror, dropping her jaw. All she wanted to do was scream. A full beard had grown on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the...?&quot; she finally got out but the changes were continuing. Her long hair pushed in a ponytail and draped to the side was shrinking. The long strands of hair slowly loosing inch by inch while her beard grew thicker. She put her hand to her face and saw the dark hair growing on her arms. She took a step back. Every time she wanted to scream a calm sensation came over her. She looked down at Jen. What used to be only an inch difference between the girls had grown several. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on...?&quot; Krista asked. It didn&#39;t hurt. If anything it felt almost good, almost like she was horny. Watching the thin arms she had trained to be trim were adding all sorts of muscle almost seemed right. She could see the weight adding onto her female frame. Her large perky breasts changed shape and pulled tighter against her chest. Their round shape flattened out but grew into larger pecs. She turned to her side trying to brace for the changes. But as she saw her flat stomach push out in front of her it was too much. The changes were getting too much. Even through the nice feeling she couldn&#39;t take it anymore.<br />
<br />
Krista rushed off to the locker room. In her hurry she didn&#39;t realize she ran into the men&#39;s. She rushed into the stall and pulled down the compression pants. It was hard to see over he massive chest and muscular belly but she knew something down there was changing. She was so horny though. Her hands tried to pleasure herself but wasn&#39;t doing any good. Even though right now her fingers were bigger than most of the dicks she&#39;d ever taken it didn&#39;t seem to be doing much. Then she felt it. A small head poking out of her vagina. &quot;That&#39;s it...&quot; he moaned as his finger touched the tip. &quot;That&#39;s the fucking...&quot; a shiver went up his spine as he leaned more into the piping against the toilet.<br />
<br />
The small bump grew longer. Into a rod that he could get a hold of. He started with just his fingers but as it grew longer and thicker he could use a hand. 1 inch turned to 2 inches, to 3, then four. &quot;What am I doing?&quot; Chris realized. &quot;No this isn&#39;t right. This isn&#39;t...&quot; his hand touched his dick again. Seven thick inches that he stroked turned into eight. &quot;Ffffffuuuucckk...&quot; he moaned. <br />
<br />
&quot;Chris? Chris babe,&quot; Jen called in the bathroom. &quot;You alright?&quot; She ventured further in. She knew no one was going to say anything. &quot;Chris. Is something wrong?&quot; She stood in front of the stall Chris was hiding in. His huge legs and feet could be easily seen under the stall.<br />
<br />
&quot;So horny...&quot; Chris moaned. He could hear Jen laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that all?&quot; Jen pushed the door open seeing him play with his 9 inches. &quot;You know that&#39;s what I&#39;m here for right?&quot; She dropped her tight shorts and rubbed up against his big body. &quot;Babe. You don&#39;t have to handle this alone anymore.&quot; Her soft hands wrapped around his dick as she started stroking. &quot;I can help you take care of it too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;J-Je-Jen, nuuuhhh-ni-nnuuhh,&quot; he couldn&#39;t get it out. Feeling her vagina wrap around his cock was too much. It was like she was supposed to be there. Her moans grew loudly making it even harder for him to think. Just feeling her soft hands rub over his massive chest and say his name in undeniable pleasure. His hands pushed against the stalls nearly tearing them off the wall. He came inside of Jen. &quot;FUCK!&quot; his deep voice bellowed through the locker room and the rest of the gym. Everything had stopped.<br />
<br />
Jen laughed as she got off of Chris. He was out of breath trying to calm himself down. She loved looking at his glossed over eyes and faint smile. He leaned forward and put all of his weight on his legs. She leaned in and gave him a kiss. &quot;Not so bad,&quot; she grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen,&quot; he tried to sound angry but it sure didn&#39;t come off that way. &quot;Jen we didn&#39;t use a condom.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jen shrugged her shoulders. &quot;Ehh... Just means i might be getting a ring faster.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen!&quot; Chris scolded. &quot;What the...&quot; Jen stopped him with another kiss. Feeling her tongue roll around his got him to shut up.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve been dating too long. I want a ring. You&#39;ve been saying soon. Well, I&#39;m making it soon,&quot; she turned around and started walking out the locker room. <br />
<br />
Chris&#39; head was still spinning. That orgasm had been a wild ride. He&#39;d never felt anything like it before. &quot;Soon...&quot; he repeated. &quot;We&#39;ve only been dating for 6 years...&quot; The sentence caught him off guard. &quot;Six years!? Jen! Jen! Wait!&quot; Chris rushed out of the locker room as all the new memories started appearing in his head. They&#39;d been dating for so long, but he still hadn&#39;t proposed. &quot;We&#39;re just supposed to be...&quot; but he couldn&#39;t get the word friends out.</p>
