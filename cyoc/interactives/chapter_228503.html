<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lucas got down from the tree and went back for his stuff.<br />
He found his boxers unscathed and quickly put them back on, however, his shirt and pants, were in a very unfortunate spot.<br />
He grabbed them and found out that with his fun time, he had cum all over his clothes. &quot;Damn it, this is ruined&quot;, he says as he smeared the cum off on the tree, not wanting to get his fur dirty.<br />
He put his clothes and shoes in his bag, and ran off, back towards the camp.<br />
He had reached his tent without getting noticed, and snuck inside.<br />
&quot;I see you had fun&quot; a voice suddenly started, scaring the bejeezus out of Lucas .<br />
It was one of the other guides.<br />
&quot;Why are you here!?&quot; Lucas shouted back at him, the man just laughed.<br />
&quot;I am here checking up on you, after all you got a second dosage, didn&#39;t you?&quot; he said pointing towards Lucas&#39; monkey feet. &quot;Just making sure you are comfortable with how you are now&quot;.<br />
Lucas crawled towards him and jumped on his bed. &quot;Oh, sorry, I am doing alright I guess, the fur is a bit warm&quot; he said laughing gently, while rubbing the back of his head.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry! I also saw you had some &#39;fun&#39;?&quot; the man said with a smile. Lucas went red with shame.<br />
&#39;I uhh.... well.. I... OOK...&quot; he stuttered flustered at being busted. &quot;Don&#39;t worry little monkey! Like my colleague said, you can do whatever you want! But back to the main question, are you comfortable with your current form?&quot; that man asked.<br />
<br />
Lucas still red, thought about it, &quot;Well honestly, I really wanted a tail, but I don&#39;t know if I want to take another dose&quot; he answered, kind off dissappointed.<br />
&quot;Ah, I see, a third dosage wouldn&#39;t really make a different, since you took the second one not too long ago, so it wouldn&#39;t work, but if it makes you feel any better....&quot; He paused for a bit, he clearly still wanted to say something but got distracted, but then he smiled. &quot;You should reach around your back!&quot; He laughed, as Lucas quickly checked his butt, above his butt he could feel something poking out of his spine, pushing against his boxer shorts. &quot;let me help you take those off!&quot; the man said, as he pulled Lucas off his legs, and quickly removed his underwear, as if he wear a parent about to change a baby.<br />
Lucas was embarrassed for a second, but was quickly focused on the new appendage that was growing in, as the male guide, pulled up the mirror for him.<br />
&quot;Look! Your tail is growing slowly! This is amazing, I haven&#39;t seen this happen before! Lie on your stomach so you can watch in the mirror!&quot;<br />
Lucas turned around, with the help of the guide, and looked in the mirror, his bare bum was the only part of his body besides his face and stomach that wasn&#39;t covered in fur.<br />
The guide then grabbed the start of Lucas&#39; tail in his hands, &quot;look you can see it growing in my hands, oh this is amazing!&quot; he said, absolutely loving the tail growth.<br />
Lucas watched in amazement as his tail grew longer and longer, until it reached about 3 feet long.<br />
&quot;I have a tail!&quot; Lucas cheered, as he moved his new appendage around, and held it in his hands, the guide smiled, &quot;Yes you do! You are now an absolute monkeyboy! However your pants are not going to fit anymore with this, so you can choose, either you stop wearing clothes, or I can cut holes in all your pants, but when the experiment is over you will be left with clothes with holes in them&quot;, the guide said.<br />
&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know... Clothes are uncomfortable but I don&#39;t want to annoy anyone either!&quot; Lucas pondered, still lying on his stomach, so the guide didn&#39;t see his penis.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about that, there are currently plenty of other monkeyboys without pants! It is expected, come, don&#39;t worry!&quot; the man said, as he picked up the monkeyboy without effort, and putting him down on all fours. He petted Lucas the monkeyboy over his head. &#39;There you go see?&quot; He said, as Lucas looked at him, kind off confused. He looked at himself once again in the mirror.<br />
He saw his big ears, his furry body, his bare butt cheeks and flaccid penis. And of course his giant tail. He also finally noticed that he was a lot shorter then he used to be. &quot;Wait did I shrink?&quot; he asked not yet aware of this part of his changes.<br />
The man laughed again, &quot;Oh you didn&#39;t notice yet? Here it is really easy for me to pick you up as well!&quot; he said, as he put his hands underneath the boys butt, and picked him up, as if he were a toddler. &quot;See? You are a lot smaller now!&quot; he said as he turned them towards the mirror. Lucas sat on his arm like a little child, his tail hanging down. It was so long it almost reached the floor.<br />
&quot;I never noticed!&quot; He said, mesmerized at the current image he was seeing.<br />
Lucas then yawned, exhausted from the long day. The man smiled once more, &quot;You should get some sleep, it&#39;s been a tough day for all you kids! I&#39;ll bring some food to your tent, so you can rest!&quot; He said, as he put Lucas in his bed, stroking the boy as if he were a furry puppy.<br />
Lucas shut his eyes, and fell asleep.</p>
