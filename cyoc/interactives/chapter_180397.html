<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You quickly decide that you need to try and escape.<br />
The more time you have the mannequins time to decide what they were going to do, the lower your chances of escaping were!<br />
In a flurry of motion, you burst from the wardrobe and come face to face with the three mannequins you saw from earlier. You find yourself momentarily mesmerized by their appearance. Though their &#39;skin&#39; was made of hard plastic and their too-still faces were a bit unnerving, it was their bodies that seemed to be built for perfection that won your attention. You almost felt jealous of it, that a non-living thing could be more desirable than you.<br />
<br />
You break out of your momentary trance as the mannequin in the red bunny suit lunges for you. You barely sidestep her grasp, but find yourself stepping into the blue bunny suit mannequin&#39;s waiting arms as you reel to the side. You thrash around in her hold, straining to free yourself before her companions join in detaining you. It seemed that the blue mannequin had trouble getting a grip on your latex body, as her hands slid around while trying to find a suitable position to hold you. Taking advantage of the moment, you duck out of her grip and give the mannequin a shove, sending it toppling into the red mannequin that you dodged earlier.<br />
<br />
Finally free, you dash for the guesthouse door and fling it open, dashing for the outside again. You nearly trip in your hurry, partly because of your panic, but also because you&#39;re unaccustomed to the new body shape that the latex catsuit you&#39;re wearing gives you. You hear the &#39;clicks&#39; of high heels behind you as you turn around to find that the mannequin in the black bunny suit is bearing down on you. You whip around and try to pick up your pace as you make it to the lawn and begin frantically sprinting across to try and get to the gate of the mansion. You nearly slipped again as your feet come into contact with the grass, slick from a morning dew.<br />
<br />
As you turn around a bend, you realize with a shock that the two mannequins you had pushed down earlier were running towards the mansion gate as well. How the hell did they get there? Upon reaching the large iron doors of the gate, they start pushing the doors closed. It takes a bit to get started, but soon the gates have enough momentum to shut with a slam. You&#39;re still nearly fifty yards away from the gate , way too far away to have done anything about it. <br />
<br />
With your exit path sealed shut, you whirled your head around to find somewhere else to lose your pursuers. You find salvation as your eyes alight upon one of the mansion windows. It was a ground floor window, at there was a small opening between the window sill and the glass  due to the window being lifted up to let in fresh air. &#39;Surely a place as big as this mansion has loads of places that I can hide in.&#39;<br />
<br />
Switching targets, you take a sharp right turn as you begin barreling for the window instead. Behind you, you can hear the black mannequin still continuing to chase you. The sounds were growing louder; it must&#39;ve gained some distance on you while you made up a new plan. Driven by fear, you pushed your body to go even faster as you went into an all-out sprint. You hadn&#39;t had to exert yourself this much in quite a long time, leading you to breathing much harder. The latex catsuit also didn&#39;t help here, as the waist of it clung tightly to your stomach, preventing you from taking as deep a breath as you would have wanted.<br />
<br />
You flung your arms out in front of you to help stop yourself as you nearly collided into the exterior wall. Climbing up on some stones that lined the plants beneath the window, you reached inside and started pulling yourself into the mansion. It was strenuous work, but you pushed on due to the fear of what would happen to you if you did not make it. You had gotten nearly half of your body inside and were beginning to pull your legs inside as a hand snatched hold of your legs. You turned your head in horror as you saw the black mannequin holding fiercely to you, face frozen in elated surprise as it pulled on you. What&#39;s more, you could see the red and blue mannequins begin to start closing the distance to you, now ensuring that the mansion gate was locked. You planted your palms on the inside wall and pushed off, hoping to giver yourself more leverage to get inside. The black bunny mannequin didn&#39;t have as tight a hold on your right leg, so you used that one to begin kicking at the mannequin&#39;s face, hoping to get her to drop your leg.<br />
<br />
With a burst of adrenaline, you gave a fierce kick that sent the black mannequin stumbling. You became unbalanced and tumbled into the mansion, knocking a few trinkets off a table pulled next to the window. Scrambling to your feet, you reached for the window to close it. You brought the window down fully just as a mannequin finger crashed into the glass, hoping to stop your efforts. You took a nervous step back as you looked at the three mannequins, who had now all made it to outside the window. The red and blue ones seemed to be staring at you intently, but the black one seemed to be dusting herself off  as she slid her bunny ears you had knocked off back onto her head. It seemed that the mannequins wouldn&#39;t break the window to follow you, so you shut the blinds so that you could no longer see them.<br />
<br />
Taking a moment to relax, you crash down into a leather sofa that was placed nearby, tipping your head back and looking at the great hall you had burst into. While the outside of the mansion had seemed that of an older era, the decor inside seemed to be quite modern. The room you were in seemed to be some sitting room, with many chairs and couches set around a coffee table, with a softly glowing fireplace in the corner. A large crystal chandelier hung above, sparkling and iridescent, as it shone down on the floor below. A balcony that seemed a part of the upper floors looked down on this space, and you could see through an archway to the side a twisting staircase that reached towards above. <br />
<br />
Looking down, you take in your body, now that you don&#39;t feel as panicked. The way the light seemed to reflect off the black, latex catsuit was quite beautiful. You couldn&#39;t help but admire your large thighs as you spread out on the couch, and you gave your &#39;breasts&#39; a firm squeeze. It might&#39;ve seemed out of place to you, but perhaps it was the fact that they were merely a part of the greater expanse of latex that encased you made it feel more normal. You gave a wary eye to the shaft of your dick, which was pinned upright by the latex. You couldn&#39;t seem to move it all that much. Stretching out your legs, you took in how thin your legs looked. Experimentally wiggling your toes, you were met with the resistance of latex, which held you in a comfy embrace. Your arms seemed thinner as well. Pinching a section of latex on your arm, you tried to pull on it, but you weren&#39;t able to make much progress as the latex stuck to you tightly.<br />
<br />
&#39;There has to be some way out of this,&#39; you thought as you reached behind you to your back, hoping to find a zipper or some sort of opening to let you out. Surprisingly, there didn&#39;t seem to be anything back there. All you felt was a smooth back of latex. Reaching to wear the latex met your neck, you tried to shove a finger in between the opening and your skin, but were unsuccessful in this as well. It seemed like you were stuck wearing this for a while.<br />
<br />
Deciding that you had rested enough, you stood up from the couch and began walking. Your next objective would be to...</p>
