<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sight of his torn clothes made Raijin realize that he was probbaly going to have to get a whole new wardrobe. There would be more time to check himself out later. He was pretty sure that almost none of his clothes would fit him now that he had grown so big and muscular. He went to his room and tried on a few of his larger shirts. He found one of his loosest tank tops, and it now fit him tightly around his chest but hung loosely just above his waistline. That and a pair of formerly baggy sweat pants were the best outfit he could find despite the exposed abs and ankles. He definitely had to get something better to wear before he went back to help Mr. Yuan the next day.<br />
<br />
He decided to call his best friend Valter. He was a bit taller then Raijin used to be so he might have had a pair of shoes he could borrow for now. He also hoped he could borrow some money. He had taken the week off from his job at the dojo to help Mr. Yuan, and he wasn&#39;t going to get paid until the end of the week... he thought. Mr. Yuan was going to pay him, right? At any rate, replacing everything in his closet was more than he could affort at the moment. Valter was a good friend. He would have Raijin&#39;s back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Valt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Rai! What&#39;s up? How&#39;s it going at that store?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, well... Something happened, and I had to come home for the day. Listen, I need your help with something, are you busy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I don&#39;t have class &#39;til later this afternoon. What&#39;s up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to go buy some things, and I&#39;m probably going to need your help. I&#39;ll drive, but I need you to come over here first. And I need to borrow a... pair of shoes. Probably sandals if you have some. I know that&#39;s kinda weird. I&#39;ll explain when you get here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Valter puzzled over that for a moment. &quot;Yeah. Uh, sure. I think I gotcha covered. I&#39;ll heard over there in five. Uh, everything okay, man?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... it&#39;s no big... Well, you&#39;ll see.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright. Be right there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks!&quot;<br />
<br />
As soon as he hung up, Raijin raced to clean up the remains of his huge load in the kitchen. Valter&#39;s apartment was only a few blocks away, and it wouldn&#39;t take him long to get there. He couldn&#39;t help pausing for a few quick flexes and cheesy model poses in the mirror as he wiped it down with a piece of his torn shirt. Just as he finished cleaning the floor, he heard Valter heading up the hallway to his door. He quickly tossed the rest of his ragged clothes on the kitchen counter and hurried to throw away the dirty rag in another room out of sight. Following a quick knock, Valter let himself in and shut the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, dude,&quot; Valter called, &quot;What&#39;s the-&quot; He stopped short when he saw the huge figure that stepped out of Raijin&#39;s bedroom.<br />
<br />
Valter wasn&#39;t exactly a small person himself. He stood 6&#39;2&quot; and had a lean but toned athletic physique. He was used to being taller than Raiijin, and he was quite faimiliar with his body as they often went to the gym together. Staring up at his friend now, however, he felt rather small. He glanced up and down at his statuesque frame with its broad, bulging shoulders, massive arms, and familiar yet unique face. Raijin brought an arm up to the back of his head as his friend&#39;s momentary silence made him a little self-conscious. Valter found himself staring at his flawless bicep peak for another moment before he could find his words again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude. What the hell happened to you? Geez! You&#39;re fucking gigantic! And your hair... And eyes... What the hell?&quot;<br />
<br />
As Valter continued to gawk at him, Raijin explained what had happened at Mr. Yuan&#39;s store with the ointment spill and how it made him grow. He glossed over the part where he had a massive orgasm just about where Valter now stood, but the bulge in his sweats may have hinted at that. It had not gone unnoticed, either. Valter may have been staring a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;So anyway,&quot; Raijin concluded, &quot;I need to go buy some new clothes as you can tell. Did you bring those shoes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. Yeah. Here you go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Raijin slipped on the pair of size 11 flip flops. He decided to wear socks with them to hopefully help hide the fact that his toes stuck out over the ends. With that done, they headed to the mall. They both cracked up a bit at how Raijin looked crammed into the driver&#39;s seat of his sedan. The first stop they made was to the shoe store where Raijin decided to splurge on a pair of size 14 basketball shoes that had a tiger stripe pattern on them. They cost a lot, but it seemed hard to pass them up with his new look. As they went around shopping at other stores, Raijin noticed he was getting a lot of extra attention. He tried to play it all off as lots of workouts, contacts, and an awesome hairstylist when he got the occasional &quot;How&#39;d you get like that?&quot; Eventually, with some financial help from Valter, they hit up enough big and tall outlets, discount racks, and sports apparel stores to put together a small but decent wardrobe. Afterwards, they returned to Raijin&#39;s apartment.<br />
<br />
Before Valter left, Raijin put on some of his new athletic gear and led the way up to the building&#39;s roof. He wanted to try something, and he wanted Valter to be there in case something went wrong. He stretched some then ran a couple of sprints along the rooftop to warm up. Then he took a deep breath and took off at a dead run toward the edge of the building. As he got to the edge, he made a powerful leap and landed solidly several feet over onto the roof of the next building. Valter was in awe of his friend&#39;s agility as he performed a couple more freerunning tricks then leapt back to his own rooftop.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was amazing, Rai!&quot; Valter said as they returned to the apartment. &quot;I can&#39;t believe how far you jumped!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I always thought it would be fun to try, but I never felt like I was strong enough until now. Thanks for your help today! I&#39;ll pay you back as soon as I can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem. I have to get ready for class, but if you need anything, call me.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Valter left, and Raijin wondered what he should do with the rest of the day.</p>
