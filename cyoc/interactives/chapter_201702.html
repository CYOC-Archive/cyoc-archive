<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sabrina was in the shower, letting the hot water stream down her hair, breasts, stomach and then to the bottom of the shower. Her nipples were hard from the warmth. She finished and got out of the glass door. Slamming the door shut she started toweling off her nude body. She heard the door bell ring. Closing her eyes and sighing she grabbed a satin bathrobe, she pulled it on as she approached the door. Pulling it over her breasts her bush was on display. <br />
<br />
She put a brown eye to the peep hole and found the hallway empty. &quot;Kids&quot; she thought, no one ever did that at any age, it was just rude. She pulled the robe tight and started walking away. The door bell was then pressed many times. Sabrina looked at the door as if it had wronged her personally. She then opened the door quickly, her heart in her throat. Expecting something curse, after what she had done to Hannah she was fearful. But wasn&#39;t that a month ago now? Who would believe Hannah anyway? <br />
<br />
Someone could see her. Her toned leg muscles and the parting of her buttocks. Where her long wet hair was turn the fabric of her robe see through. As she looked up and down the corridor he waited for her to look away and then bolted for the door. She locked the door not knowing that Someone had predicted her every move. Her robe was held together by her hands, her breasts clung to the fabric of her robe as she mentally sighed. Someone was following her, she had pulled her hair out of her robe when she turned around suddenly. Someone almost got caught, but almost wasn&#39;t good enough. <br />
<br />
She turned with her hair in one hand and the other closing her robe. Nothing.<br />
<br />
Someone was hidden behind a couch. He knew this place and he knew Sabrina. She sat down at a makeup table she used for shoot or work, it had many lights built into it so she could see her face in full sun or studio lights. It had a mirror that was on swivel, that could be tilted back or forwards.  She started working the lotion into her shoulders, her robe opened exposing a breast. As she got into her routine Someone saw her breasts. Not stiff she still had an impressive body. His teacher was right, she would be good to breed with.  <br />
<br />
Sabrina was now brushing her hair, both breasts exposed and the mirror suddenly swung down, her breasts had been in the bottom of the mirror, now they were in the middle. It was so low now she could see her pussy if it wasn&#39;t for the table she was seated at. She blinked slowly and then she started combing her hair. On the bed was a black cocktail dress she was going to a meeting to network with another boyfriend.<br />
<br />
The mirror was then pulled back showing her own scared face. She pushed away from makeup table, clutching her robe to her breasts and bush. She was like a scared deer in the headlights. Someone waited for her to turn away. She then whipped around and went saw someone grabbing her. She screamed, but people minded their own business in this building. Sabrina fought him because she had never seen him before, he had hate in his eyes. Yet somehow she knew that he was there for her. She scratched at his face but she never stopped him. Sabrina scratched at him and fought with all her strength, her robe parted and exposing a breast.<br />
<br />
Someone had once been her Siberian Husky Max.<br />
<br />
Max fucked her like a dog, but a dog turned into a man.<br />
<br />
He held her down and entered her. <br />
<br />
Sabrina had her hands pinned either side of her head, this intruder entered her hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;AH-HA!&quot; she wailed.<br />
<br />
Her hair askew on the pillow, he thrust into her again and she scream her breasts rising her her chest. <br />
<br />
Foreplay and fondling wasn&#39;t for Max, he was only here to breed.<br />
<br />
Sabrina screamed but he was strong and with each thrust she lost strength. Soon her face was a mask, expressing the horror she felt as if in a silent film. Max was hard and brutal, he emptied his balls, already churning with cum, into her unprotected vagina. As he did so his cock became canine in appearance and color. Red and knot appeared locking them in place. Complete nude except for the curse collar around his neck he fucked her until she sobbed. <br />
<br />
Sabrina knew then that this man had been sent by Hannah, she had not noticed him because she knew, by the walk he silently stalked her. That Hannah had used the curse to do a new trick. She was curled up in a ball, sobbing quietly to herself. Wondering what she had unleashed with that fucking box. Max&#39;s knot deflated and with a wet pop he pulled out of her and left her sobbing on the bed. There were scratch marks across legs where he had fought her and opened her legs, to take his bitch fully. <br />
<br />
Hannah had spent a month teaching him how to enter an apartment. Hannah had played Sabrina, her former best friend and let Max use his new form. After a month he entered and fucked Hannah without Hannah being able to stop him. She played her role because she didn&#39;t care what he did to her, she was already pregnant. Hannah was a pregnant bitch to this Dogman. Hannah wanted to share her love, and her bizarre fate, with Sabrina. <br />
<br />
max opened the door with a human hand, loosened his collar. Morphed back into a dog and cross the road the way he had come.</p>
