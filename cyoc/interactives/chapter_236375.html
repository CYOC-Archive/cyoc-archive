<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>As usual for Chronivac stories I write, I set specific rules that limit the Chronivac, including &quot;no altering reality to remove awareness of changes,&quot; because I feel the use of reality altering to hide or mask changes done is just a cheat device in writing, and there should be consequences. All of the rules set can be found in the chapter here.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chloe frantically looked through the Chronivac for some way to impede Vanessa. She at first thought to try and just set back the slider she had adjusted, but was blocked?<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean, &#39;Prohibited Action. Too Early For Reversion?&#39; What does that mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
Angie looked over her shoulder and grimaced. &quot;Um, what&#39;s that red slider that flashes every time you try to reset her age? It says something about duration...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Duration? I didn&#39;t notice that before!!&quot; Chloe blurted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you even know how this thing works?!&quot; Angie remarks.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just got it a few minutes ago, and...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Typical Chloe, rushing into things without checking them out completely. Do you even know what the rules are, what it can or can&#39;t do yet?&quot; Angie groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah...&quot; Chloe droned, before backing out of Vanessa&#39;s profile and spotting a tab discussing the Chronivac&#39;s limitations. There were seven set rules for the Chronivac, stating that beyond this, there were no real limitations on what the product could do, but these seven conditions were things in no way the Chronivac could overcome. These rules were:<br />
<br />
<br />
1. The Chronivac CANNOT alter the fabric of reality itself. This used to be a feature in prior versions, a feature that could edit one&#39;s awareness of changes caused by the Chronivac or could normalize the perception of changes made by the Chronivac, but this feature was deemed too dangerous and disabled and removed, as it caused not only harm to the fabric of reality, but could make any particularly unscrupulous user that mastered the advanced settings far too dangerous, as they could make everyone instantly unaware of anything they do, and become a threat to their fellow sapient beings, or even other sapient beings across the multiverse. Removing this feature allows users to be held accountable if the need arises. As such, all targets of the Chronivac will always be aware of being transformed, however, there is no prohibition on devolving their mind into the mind of a non-sapient species.<br />
<br />
2. While the Chronivac is quite powerful and can affect most all life in countless ways, the optimal term here is MOST. For some reason, the Chronivac, in no way physically, mentally, or spiritually, across all of reality in perpetuum, cannot affect specific neurodivergent individuals; this meaning anyone on the autistic spectrum or people who are schizophrenic and currently not treating the condition. In addition, the Chronivac for some reason does not work on Hollywood actor Kevin Bacon. Such individuals will be fully immune to the Chronivac, physically, mentally, and spiritually, and will always be aware of all changes the Chronivac causes, and will be able discern their original state of reality from all changes a Chronivac user has made, able to see the original state of a person, place, or thing.<br />
<br />
3. Changes given a timed duration cannot have their timer reduced after the fact. All timers must reach their natural conclusion. Attempting to force a timer to end or change to revert can cause serious harm to the user and program glitches, including unintended changes to others in the surrounding area and/or extra changes to the target. As such, software safeguards are in effect to protect against forced timer adjustments by typical users, but as stated above, if you bypass these safeguards, dangerous things can happen. If the timer is set to &#39;Permanent,&#39; then that particular change can NEVER be undone, and the original form is lost forever. The user can still use the Chronivac to do other transformations, but undoing their current transformation is impossible, as the new form will now be set to their new default form. The only exception to the timer rules is if the subject becomes pregnant during the time they are changed, in which case the timer is temporarily frozen until they ween their offspring from milk.<br />
<br />
4. Individuals merged into others will have their minds, souls, and personalities incorporated into their hosts, their hosts permanently retaining all memories and personality quirks of anyone merged into them, even in the event of the parties separating again later, unless specified by rules wrote out and set by the user into the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
5. The Chronivac cannot terminate life. As such, the Chronivac will not permit a female-to-male sex change and/or an age regression to before puberty if the target is pregnant, as doing so would cause irreparable fatal harm to the fetus. One must wait until the child is born (or the Chronivac user could accelerate the mother&#39;s gestation and labor of the fetus to expedite birth) before being permitted to enact said changes. The same is true for attempting to turn someone into an inanimate object. Turning a living being into an inanimate object effectively kills the target, so the Chronivac prohibits such changes.<br />
<br />
6. Anyone who has ever used the Chronivac to transform another can never lose the knowledge of the Chronivac, regardless of how low they or another user renders their intellect. This also applies to trying to wipe a target&#39;s memory, as one can not erase any memories of the Chronivac, no matter what, and while memory erasure IS a feature a user of the Chronivac may use, this is a VERY advanced feature that requires EXTREME surgical precision to remove exact data, as one would need full knowledge of assembly code to use this feature. One small misstep and you can render the subject a permanent vegetable until you rebuild their mind from scratch (which also requires knowledge of assembly coding).<br />
<br />
7. The Chronivac knows not why kids like the taste of Cinnamon Toast Crunch.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw man, we can&#39;t rewrite reality or erase her memory of this!! That sucks!!&quot; Chloe remarks. &quot;Guess I&#39;ll just have to try to use settings on this to slow her down somehow. While I do that, you try and catch up to her, Angie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good.&quot; Angie says. &quot;Just don&#39;t do anything weird, like turn her into a bull or a pirate...&quot; Angie gets up and heads after Vanessa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, how to stop Vanessa?&quot; Chloe looked over all the bells and whistles of the Chronivac, including the &quot;Advanced&quot; features, where one could use text and coding to input very precise changes, and decided that would take too long to figure out. She also saw there were available profiles for everyone in the house, which gave their biometric data and locations, and this told her that Vanessa was nearing the stairs, Angie was in the second story hall, and their moms were all in the kitchen on the first floor. That was when she saw the Presets tab up top, and saw a whole plethora of preset options to turn on and off. &quot;All I got to do is keep her from getting to our parents downstairs in the kitchen, but not cause a scene, so... if I do something that&#39;ll dumb her down but not make her an animal, maybe I can distract her?&quot; Chloe saw a filter option and used it to remove full animal presets and look for options that would reduce intellect and distract the mind. From the options left, Chloe rapidly began to check options, many of which she had no idea what some of them were. What Chloe hit was...<br />
<br />
As Vanessa made her way down the stairway, she paused, feeling odd, in a manner she recalled from when Chloe used the Chronivac on her to make her a grown woman. &quot;Oh man, did she use that thing on me again?&quot; Vanessa said, gripping the banister. &quot;They must be trying to stop me from telling on them... What are they trying to...&quot; Suddenly, Vanessa lost her balance and fell on her knees on the stairs, the girl in the 20 year old body glad she took hold of the rail beforehand, noticing her white sneakers, which along with all the other clothes she had on when she came here, had grown larger to accommodate her larger body, was now growing platform heels with rhinestones in the platforms and an even higher stiletto heel in the back. As the legs of her jeans began to shrink up her tanning firming legs, her ankle socks started to grow up into loose floppy socks that were more like leg warmers over her mid-calf and drooped over her sneakers, which now had 6&quot; platforms and a 14&quot; stiletto heel in back, but her feet felt perfectly natural in these now absurd shoes. As she began to stand, she noticed her shortening legs of her jeans reaching out for each other and beginning to merge as the fabric started to change from denim to cotton and polyester as the material began to fold and crease upon itself, Vanessa starting to recognize the end result of the changed garment as a blue knee length pleated skirt, which was still getting shorter. As the skirt was starting to rise up to mid-thigh and enter miniskirt territory, a white belt with silver studs threaded through the belt loops of the skirt, the belt secured with a heart-shaped belt buckle. Under the skirt, Vanessa&#39;s ass blew up to massive proportions, barely hiding under the garment anymore as it ended up more of a microskirt, when Vanessa felt something alien above her butt grow and slither out from under the tiny skirt, a new noodly limb covered in black fur attached to the base of her spine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this a... tail?&quot; a confused Vanessa remarked, before getting a bigger shock as something started to tent the front of her skirt as well. Vanessa cautious lifted the short garment up, shocked to see she now had a growing male member resting just above her vagina, albeit there were no balls below the penis, it went straight from the base of the penis to the clitoris & rest of the vagina below the base of the shaft of the penis. &quot;The hell, Chloe?!&quot; Vanessa let out, before she groaned, feeling her insides shift as her hips expanded to an absurd diameter as her waist was constricting to cartoonish proportions. Vanessa couldn&#39;t determine how absurd exactly, but knew it wasn&#39;t something a normal human could ever achieve. In truth, Vanessa&#39;s waist was now only 16&quot; around, while her hips were 56&quot; wide, indeed proportions no normal human could ever have, but somehow Vanessa&#39;s body was adapting. Speaking of, internally, Vanessa&#39;s gastrointestinal tract beyond her stomach was erased, nearly all her intestines removed, along with her kidneys, bladder, appendix, and gallbladder, and sphincter, as the little remaining small intestines became identical in property to her vaginal canal and cervix as they attached to her womb, her anus reshaping into a second vagina, complete with its own labia, vulva, and clitoris, while her stomach and liver became &quot;quantum organs,&quot; able to break down all biomass for 100% pure energy, meaning her body longer produced bodily waste and fully digested anything consumed, reducing the amount she needed to eat, and also rendering her immune to being poisoned. A set of her lowest ribs dematerialized from her ribcage, seemingly making her body more flexible. Vanessa gasped as her t-shirt began to change, splitting down the middle as it gained buttons down one side, clearly becoming a white blouse, a blouse that was unbuttoned and was, almost by magic, tying itself under the B-cup breasts she grew when Chloe aged her by 10 years, but now these breasts were rapidly growing inside of her new blouse, speeding through the alphabet faster than a drunk at a sobriety check as Vanessa winced, feeling something puncture her nipples, seeing the silhouette of her nipples, which now had bar piercings in them, through the blouse, as they raced up - H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, before stopping at outrageous near head-sized P-cups, but Vanessa was amazed they weren&#39;t causing her back pain, not knowing her body was racing with increasing strength and dexterity. She also wasn&#39;t noticing her mind getting more distracted, more clouded, as she kept focusing on her changes, oddly becoming less upset with Chloe and more interested with seeing where this will end up, and in the back of her mind, wondering if these changes will help her get some cute guys or girls as she lets out an errant giggle. A red necktie wrapped and loosely fastened around the collar of the new blouse, hanging in the cleavage of her now massive tits.<br />
<br />
As Angie rounds the corner of the hall and finally catches up, reaching the top of the stairs, Angie quietly mutters, &quot;Jeez Chloe, what the hell? I thought we were just stopping her, not turning her into... I don&#39;t know? Schoolgirl kitty Jessica Rabbit here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Vanessa didn&#39;t hear her, momentarily losing her hearing as her ears seemed to be absorbed into her head, only for black furry triangles to pop out of the top of her head through her shoulder length brunette locks, triangles that looked a lot like cat ears, which began to twitch and swivel amidst Vanessa&#39;s hair, hair that was now rapidly growing longer and lighter, the strands suddenly bunched by two hot pink scrunchies that seemed to manifest from thin air, styling her growing hair into a set of twintails as said twintails grew out long enough to reach her knees, as Angie noted from seeing Vanessa finally getting to her feet on the steps. Vanessa&#39;s nose became more petite and her face even more feminine and cute as her whole body now possessed a rich bronze hue, as her eyes took on a vibrant blue shade with a reflective coat on the irises.<br />
<br />
Vanessa stood there on the steps, the head of her 10&quot; cock peeking out from under the hem of her microskirt, placing a finger on her lips, her fingernails growing by a few inches as sparkly polish of various colors coated each nail, and her lips rapidly fattened up, gaining a glossy permanent coat of hot pink glittery lipstick. &quot;Um, like, what was I doing again?&quot; Vanessa remarked with a dopey, silly, vapid grin, her voice a saccharine sweet soprano with a valley girl inflection. &quot;Like, something about mommy? Was it, like, showing her my new sexy boobies? Wait, something about the Chronie!! Yeah, that must be it!! The Chronie gave me my big boobies, cute tail and skirt, and made me, like, totes dummy!! But, um, like, what was I going to tell mommy again?&quot; Vanessa was no longer mad at Chloe, and her intellect could be bested by a sack of potatoes at this point, but she still recalled the Chronivac, and wanting to say SOMETHING to her mom and Chloe&#39;s mom, but was now too dumb to remember what that was exactly.<br />
<br />
Angie decided, given Vanessa&#39;s mental state, this would be the perfect time to coax Vanessa back to Angie&#39;s room. &quot;Hey, Vanessa. Chloe says she&#39;s sorry and wants to show you something!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Vanessa gives Angie a happy chipper look and giggles, &quot;Okie dokie, Angie!! Um, like, sorry about what?&quot; Again, Vanessa had forgotten what she was ever mad at Chloe about... well, not so much she had forgotten, but that she wasn&#39;t mad at her anymore for making her a grown up, then doing this to her, and the thought of being mad wasn&#39;t crossing her brain, like whatever form she was in was naturally predisposed to being upbeat, happy, and congenial.<br />
<br />
Back in Angie&#39;s room, Chloe was in shock seeing what her random checking of preset boxes had done to Vanessa. &quot;Like, hiiiiii~ Chloe!!&quot; Vanessa beamed as she skipped into the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just WHAT did you do to Vanessa?&quot; Angie asked, walking over to Chloe and the tablet, double checking Chloe&#39;s handiwork. &quot;What is this?&quot; She looked at what was ticked off:<br />
<br />
- Nekomimi<br />
- Gyaru<br />
- Futanari Bimbo<br />
- Superhero<br />
<br />
&quot;I just ticked off stuff in the filter, and...&quot; Chloe utters.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know what half of this stuff means?&quot; Angie barks, looking at Chloe for several seconds of awkward silence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you?&quot; Chloe suddenly answers.<br />
<br />
Angie was taken aback, like she was offended, but then, she lowered her head. &quot;No, I&#39;m just as clueless. Makes sense. We&#39;re 10. I mean, the only thing of the list of things you checked off I know is &#39;superhero.&#39; Maybe we should look them up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or we can increase our intellects...?&quot; Chloe smirks.<br />
<br />
Angie looks over at Vanessa, seeing her fondle her massive P-cup breasts and lightly tease her cock before getting distracted by a loose string on the curtains and starting to bat at it. &quot;We could, but playing with the Chronivac is what got us in this mess in the first place...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I think I got a better idea of what I&#39;m doing now,&quot; Chloe says, &quot;just a little.&quot;<br />
<br />
Angie rolls her eyes &quot;At least tell me you didn&#39;t set a timer on whatever you did to Vanessa on the stairs?&quot;<br />
<br />
Moments later...<br />
<br />
*SLAP*<br />
<br />
The sound of Angie smacking Chloe upside the head. &quot;You idjit!! You forgot to check that setting again!! And that means, just like being 20, she&#39;s gonna be like... THIS, for a WHOLE WEEK. How are you going to explain THIS to her mom?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chloe held up the tablet and shrugged. Angie facepalmed.</p>
