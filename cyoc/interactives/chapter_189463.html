<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The raptors chatter amongst themselves, letting out hisses, clicks and squawks. You can&#39;t understand, but you get the sense it must be a language, even if, to you, they just sound like wild animals. Their communication is accompanied by any number of strange gestures, as well - arm movements, bobs and shakes of the head, and even tail movements.<br />
<br />
After what must be some internal discussion, the raptors fan out, injecting the ragtag group of captured humans one by one. You&#39;re one of the very last, and the raptor who does the deed looks you in the eyes as it pushes the needle into your bicep, its pupils narrow slits in a pool of gold. You try to draw away, pressing yourself back into the seat, but there&#39;s no avoiding it - the raptor pushes down on the plunger, and you feel cold, viscous liquid enter your vein. Funny - the raptor found your vein far easier than the phlebotomist last time you had to go to the doctor.<br />
<br />
You don&#39;t have a lot of time to think about the raptor&#39;s skill at phlebotomy or the amount of practice that must have been required, because the cold sensation sweeping up your arm, working its way through your blood vessels, makes it hard to think. You shiver, and, as the fluid reaches your heart, cry out; the whole room is awash with the sound of other humans exclaiming, crying, or shouting as they feel it too. There are too many languages for you to make out what anyone else is saying. You can&#39;t manage words, though, just a low moan, your thoughts growing more and more sluggish as your heart pumps that treacherous fluid through your entire body - your torso, your legs, up through your neck. Your face and ears start to feel cold as it reaches your head, and you finally fall silent.<br />
<br />
The raptor huffs a hot breath right in your face, and, trembling, you find yourself wanting to lean into it. You feel so, so cold, so the heat is almost welcome despite the source. You lean forward, seeking out comfort from the hot-blooded lizard in front of you; it just bares its teeth in what might be a grin and keeps just out of reach.<br />
<br />
Except - your face starts to feel heavy and swollen, especially your nose. You find yourself gasping for breath as your nose begins to grow, almost like it&#39;s stretching out toward the raptor since your hands can&#39;t, restrained as they are. Your nostrils flare wide as you suck in big, desperate breaths. Every inhalation seems to leave your chest a little big larger than before, like you can&#39;t quite exhale fully - or like your body is bloating up, piling on fat and muscle in rhythm with your breath and the awful cold pumping through your circulatory system. It&#39;s reached every corner of you now, from your scalp to your fingertips to the soles of your feet. <br />
<br />
The raptor makes a low rattling noise at you, showing you its teeth again before warming you with its breath again. Then it hops up onto the chair, bracing its claws on the edge of the seat, forcing your legs together. You squirm with discomfort, but there&#39;s nothing you can really do with your arms and legs restrained and this strange, awful cold making it difficult to think.<br />
<br />
Your left arm is starting to feel strange, and impossibly heavy. The restraints feel much tighter, too. You look down, and see your arm thickening even as you watch. Your fingers feel numb and you strain to move them, even just to grasp at the end of the armrest, but all you can manage is a feeble twitch as your palm swells huge and fat, subsuming your digits in the bloating flesh. Your wrist feels stiffer, too, the joint only allowing you to move your hand up and down rather than side to side, and even that range of motion is reduced.  The growth leaves you with little more than a fat mitt, little bumps sticking out where your fingertips are just barely visible.<br />
<br />
Your fingernails start to harden, too, and you watch them thicken with a distant, bewildered horror, unable to comprehend quite what&#39;s happening. It looks almost like you&#39;ve got an elephant&#39;s foot stuck on the end of your arm. It&#39;s much too heavy now for the rest of you, and you&#39;re almost grateful you&#39;re supported by the chair so you don&#39;t have to figure out how to carry that monstrously large hand. Or foot. Whatever it is. <br />
<br />
Something is rocking against you, and you blearily turn your head away from your own arm - dimly registering that you&#39;ve also been able to see the raptor&#39;s thick, muscular thigh the whole time as well, and the vicious sickle claw on its foot - and note that the raptor is rutting its thick cock against the place where your legs are pressed tightly together. It seems to be taking a deep sadistic pleasure in watching your hand change, too, but looks up and bares its teeth again when it notices you looking. The sound it makes seems almost like a laugh, as it uses you for its own pleasure with little regard for whether you even notice.  At least it&#39;s warm, you think to yourself. Without the raptor on you, pressing its hot body against yours, you think you might just freeze.<br />
<br />
Now that you&#39;re looking straight ahead again, you realize how much more space your nose is taking up in your vision. It&#39;s thickened substantially, and must stick out a full three inches, and it continues to extend - slowly but surely - between your eyes. Without meaning to, you reach your nose out - the end of it&#39;s flattened, and muscle is filling in, allowing you to reach out and sort of grasp at the raptor&#39;s snout with your new ... appendage? Whatever&#39;s happening to you, it means you can at least warm up your cold face a little bit with the skin-to-skin contact. <br />
<br />
The raptor says something to you, and inches its head back - and your nose inches forward, growing out to try and pursue the fleeting warmth of his face. You hate that you can&#39;t even seem to control this foolish instinct. The raptor has abducted you, injected you against your will, is changing your body into something horrifying and inhuman, and is using your body for its own sick sexual satisfaction - you can feel its pre slicking up your thighs - and all you can bring yourself to care about is how cold you are.<br />
<br />
You take a quick glance around, and realize all the other humans are almost as badly off as you are - bodies contorting and swelling, or, in some cases, shrinking. The other raptors are pleasuring themselves in all sorts of ways - one has its victim out of the chair and on the floor, its dick pressed tightly between the person&#39;s still-growing tits; still others have forced their cocks into people&#39;s muzzle-like mouths, pumping in and out as once-human jaws extend into long, inhuman snouts of all sorts of sizes and shapes. Not one person looks like their change is going quite the same. One woman is entirely covered with silky fur but otherwise looks totally human; another has a massive horse&#39;s ass and legs but has thus far remained entirely hairless. There&#39;s a man whose head has grown so large he can&#39;t lift it anymore - from your untrained eye, you think his head might be a tyrannosaur, or allosaurus, maybe. It&#39;s hard to know, and you&#39;re distracted by how his raptor attendant is fucking him in his still human-sized behind, a little nub of a tail just starting to grow from the human&#39;s spine as the raptor fucks into him. <br />
<br />
Unlike the others, your raptor actually leaves you for a moment - hopping back off the chair with its cock bobbing as it walks off. You try to shout for it to come back, you&#39;re too cold, you need it -  but your throat feels tight and your mouth distorted, and all you can manage is a strange, shrill cry.<br />
<br />
Your nose grows longer and longer as you try to reach for him, and you trumpet again and again to voice your displeasure and dire need for anything that could even distantly resemble comfort.<br />
<br />
Finally, finally, he comes back to you - brandishing another needle, with another feral, toothy grin. His claws rip open your pants - which were already uncomfortable, stretched tightly over thickening thighs and uncomfortably damp and sticky from his copiously leaking pre. He pries your legs apart slightly, and then jabs the needle in - you howl in fear, but he just goes for your thigh, not putting it directly into your dick.<br />
<br />
You only get a moment&#39;s comfort, though, as the new fluid reaches your half-hard cock quickly. You feel yourself swelling up, harder than you&#39;ve ever been - and yet your cock doesn&#39;t grow at all. Indeed, it seems like it&#39;s shrinking, receding into you as your thighs puff up and the area between your legs swells. Your balls draw tight against you, and then, with a sickening pop, are pulled fully inside - opening up a narrow slit in the process. You feel your pubic area growing plush with fat, thick lips developing around your new gash as you squirm and let out animalistic moans.<br />
<br />
You prod at yourself with your trunk - it&#39;s grown long enough, hanging down to your lap, that you can examine your changing genitals with it, and you let out a shameful little squeak as you realize how sensitive you&#39;re becoming. Your new cunt throbs, muscles clenching and unclenching as your dick finishes shrinking itself down to a sensitive little nub nestled just above your opening. You can smell yourself through your trunk, trembling at the state of your own arousal - and startling as you realize you&#39;re beginning to produce your own juices, your cunt swiftly getting slick with thick bestial liquid. <br />
<br />
The restraints bite into your left arm hard - you&#39;ve practically got a tree trunk attached to you at this point, the huge limb entirely out of proportion with the rest of you. Sure, you&#39;ve put on a good deal of weight, but you&#39;re mostly still person-sized besides your trunk and arm. No chance of lifting it at this point, not under your own power; not until your shoulders develop further. The raptor seems to realize this - that your arm&#39;s too heavy for you to even hope to escape - and presses a button that releases all the restraints at once.<br />
<br />
You fumble to your feet, but are weighed down by your arm. It grows longer as soon as it gets the chance, thudding to the floor even though you&#39;re completely upright. You end up collapsing, its weight skidding out from under you as you thud to the floor and stare at your six foot long limb. Prickles of dark brown fur have begun to burst through the surface, making you itch - and that same itching spreads to the rest of your body, too, a healthy, glossy coat of fur sprouting to entirely cover you. At least you don&#39;t feel quite so cold - the fluid seems to be warming up to body temperature finally, and your new fur is keeping you nice and insulated as it grows longer and longer.<br />
<br />
The raptor takes advantaged of your downed position, hoisting its claws under your hips, bringing you up so you&#39;re on your knees and it has easier access to fuck your new pussy from behind. You push back against it - that second injection did more to you than just change your genitals, and you find yourself yearning urgently to be filled. A clenching feeling inside you indicates continued changes; you need this raptor to fuck the Y chromosome out of you; you need a womb; you need to carry its young. (Some distant, sensible part of you thinks there&#39;s no goddamn way a dinosaur and a human could have viable offspring, but - you&#39;re not really a human, this raptor came from outer space, and there&#39;s no knowing what&#39;s rational and what isn&#39;t anymore. The haze of your heat blots out much further thought on the matter - you just want to be knocked up, want to feel your belly get heavy with eggs or live young or whatever else the raptor can do to you. You need to be gravid, is the point.<br />
<br />
You twist your trunk around, reaching blindly for the raptor&#39;s snout, wanting to feel more of him, touch as much of him as you can. You stroke sloppily at his muzzle, and he parts his jaws, licking at the flat, blunt end of your trunk. You can&#39;t make out in any traditional sense from this angle, but it&#39;ll have to do. The raptor is hitting your inside walls at the perfect angle, and you feel the muscles of your still-developing cunt clench tightly around him, trying to squeeze all the pre out of him that you can, desperately wanting to make him come inside you. You barely even notice as your ass swells larger, the new musculature growing in time with his deep, powerful thrusts. <br />
<br />
Just then, as you&#39;re getting the best (well, first) fuck of your life ...</p>
