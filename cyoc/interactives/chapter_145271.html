<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Who are you and what are you doing in my house?&quot;<br />
It was Sara my wife.<br />
Before I could say anything she shut the door and I heard her run back towards the front door.<br />
I quickly grabbed a dressing gown of Sara&#39;s and put it on. I heard Sara in the distance.<br />
&quot;Bill help me. I have an intruder in the house&quot;<br />
Bill was our young neighbor. I remember noticing him washing his car in his front yard when I came home. I guess he must have still been out the front as it was less than a minute before I heard Sara outside the door telling him there was a strange girl in her room.<br />
If I had a chance to jump out the window I had missed it. I decided honesty was my best approach.<br />
&quot;In there&quot; <br />
The door opened. Bill rushed in. He seemed huge. I knew he was about 6&#39;2, my old height but in my current body he towered over me. I guess I wasn&#39;t used to being only 5&#39;5 Sara&#39;s height. The world looked different from my current perspective.<br />
It took him just a couple of seconds to cross the floor and grab my right arm and wrench it behind my back. I squealed in pain. My voice was so high pitched. <br />
Sara must have thought I was her husbands lover. I saw her looking at the pile of my (John&#39;s) clothes on the floor but I didn&#39;t have time to say anything before Bill marched me down to the living room. <br />
Bill addressed Sara, &quot;What do you want to do? Call the police?&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. Where&#39;s John?&quot;<br />
&quot;I saw him returning from his walk an hour or so ago. I haven&#39;t seen him leave again&quot;<br />
&quot;I can explain&quot; I uttered.<br />
&quot;Who are you girl? Are you John&#39;s lover? Is he hiding under the bed or in the cupboard?&quot;<br />
She stormed off back to the bedroom before I could answer.<br />
&quot;John you sniveling bastard. Get out hear and face the music&quot; She yelled as she re-entered the bedroom.<br />
Bill seemed highly amused by the thought that John had such a hot lover. &quot;How does an old fart like John score a chick like you?&quot; he uttered to himself.<br />
However he released my arm and told me to sit on the couch. I guess I was a hot chick at the moment. Sara had been a stunner when we had got married. She had been 24 at the time. I guess at the moment I was a hot 24 year old blonde. <br />
&quot;Bill call Sara back. I will explain. She won&#39;t find John&quot;<br />
He looked at me with a puzzled look on his face. &quot;Do I know you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Kind of. Get Sara. I only want to explain once&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you think about running away&quot; he moved down the hallway but kept an eye on me &quot;Sara, She says she wants to explain and that you won&#39;t find John&quot;<br />
An angry looking Sara came back. &quot;Ok slut. Talk&quot;<br />
&quot;Do you recognize me?&quot;<br />
I think she realized for the first time that I looked like herself. &quot;Well you look a bit like I used to. I guess that unfaithful husband of mine likes blondes of a certain type&quot;<br />
&quot;Sara you will find this hard to believe but I am John and I have been magically changed into a copy of you from when we got married&quot;<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m the tooth fairy&quot; said Bill<br />
&quot;My god!&quot; she looked at John. &quot;She could be telling the truth&quot; <br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Bill was pretty dubious.<br />
&quot;Show me your right arm&quot; <br />
I held out my arm. Sara pushed up the sleeve and examined the arm. She located a small scar. She obviously recognized it &quot;My god. How did this happen?&quot;<br />
I told her how I had found the medallion and recognized what it was. How I had planned to surprise her by becoming my 25 year old self by touching the suit I gad got married in but had accidently touched her wedding dress, resulting in what she saw before her.<br />
&quot;Bill keep an eye on her.... err him while I check this out&quot;<br />
&quot;Gladly&quot; said Bill. He was certainly giving me the once over.<br />
Sara went to the bedroom. A minute later she returned, she was holding the medallion by it&#39;s chain. &quot;This medallion&quot; <br />
&quot;Yes. Be careful or it will change you as well&quot;<br />
&quot;So you touched this to me wedding dress and changed into 24 year old me&quot; I nodded<br />
&quot;I have to test this&quot; She went back to the bedroom<br />
A minute later she was back out. &quot;Nothing happened I&#39;m still 60 years old&quot;<br />
&quot;Did you feel you got zapped by static electricity?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes&quot;<br />
&quot;Then in 30 minutes you will look like me. It&#39;s not instant&quot;<br />
&quot;Um I think your hair is getting longer&quot; said Bill who was still there.<br />
Sara had sported a pixie cut for the last 10 years. I currently had the long blonde locks she had on our wedding day.<br />
Sara went to the bathroom to look in the mirror there. Bill and me looked at each other then followed her. We all watched as Sara grew younger. The changes were not dramatic but she slowly lost the signs of age and the extra weight she had put on in the last 36 years.<br />
&quot;So how does this work?&quot; she asked in wonder.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. Real magic. But I read on the internet that you have to wait 12 hours between changes&quot;<br />
&quot;Do you suddenly revert?&quot;<br />
&quot;No after 12 hours the medallion will work on you again. I changed at 1 O&#39;clock. I will be able to change back into John at 1 am but until them I&#39;m stuck like this&quot;<br />
&quot;My twin&quot; <br />
&quot;I guess&quot;<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;ll call you Mandy. I always wanted a sister. I guess I have one now&quot; She turned to Bill &quot;Would you like to use the medallion?&quot;<br />
&quot;No way. Keep it away from me&quot;<br />
&quot;Well how would you like to take two twins out dancing tonight. I want to make the most out of being young again&quot;<br />
Bill was a bachelor. He was a professional footballer. We were surprised when a 30 year old had bought the house next door about a year ago. He seemed to have a constant stream of girlfriends but no steady partner. We lived in a wealthy neighborhood. <br />
&quot;Ah sure&quot;<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll be ready at 8&quot;<br />
&quot;No way. I&#39;m not going any where looking like this&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh don&#39;t be such a whus. Would you rather I went out with Bill by myself? I&#39;m happy to do that&quot; Bill was a good looking guy. Did I want my wife to go out dancing with him? No. I needed to be a chaperone.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be back at 8. I&#39;d be happy to take out either one or both of you&quot; Bill gave us a smile as he left.<br />
&quot;Come on, it will be fun. I&#39;m going whether you are with me or not. Get dressed. We need to go shopping to get new underwear. I&#39;ve lost 20 kg. It&#39;s 3.30 we haven&#39;t got much time&quot; The clothes she was wearing were baggy on her.<br />
&quot;Actually you stay. Anything that fits me will fit you. I&#39;ll get what we need for both of us. I suspect I will be much quicker on my own&quot;<br />
10 minutes later Sara had changed into an outfit that fitted a little better but was still baggy and was leaving. &quot;I&#39;ll be back at 5. We will need at least 3 hours to get ready&quot;</p>
