<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris thought about it for a moment before making up his/her mind, it would take a while for him to fully think as himself as a women. <br />
“I think I need to talk to my family.” Answered Chris as the Doctor nodded her head.<br />
“Please follow me then.” Stated the Doctor as Chris followed her down the hall, she found herself looking at the multiple rooms as she passed by. There where monsters she had never even think of before, a man with a normal looking top half but the bottom half was a massive spider, a living tree creature and an actual humanoid dragon yelling at people while he played video games online. There were other more common monsters, elves, centaurs, furrys and so on. <br />
Finally, they reached a large room which had multiple cubicles each of them with computers, she could hear multiple conversations going on. <br />
“Here you go.” Said the Doctor as she led her to a free cubical, there was a desktop computer with a web camera. <br />
“Thanks.” Said Chris as she sat down, she had learned quickly that she had to move one hand behind her back to make sure her tail was out of the way as she sat down. She logged on to the computer and found the video call feature was already in place. But instead she pulled up a chat box and logged in. <br />
She quickly found that her younger sister was like always logged on, likely chatting with one of her friends or the like. She tapped her icon as a text box came up.<br />
“Hello Liza, are you at home? Is mom and dad home? I….I want to chat with them before doing a video call.” Typed Chris as he waited for her sister to see the message, she was half tempted to try to chat with her older brother Michael but he wasn’t about to do that.<br />
The resource came almost at once.<br />
“Chris…thank god, how are you? Are you ok? What type of Monster are you?” messaged Liza <br />
“I am ok….is mom and dad around?” inquired Chris in his own chat box. <br />
“Mom is here and so is Michael…dad went to get some work done on his car.” Answered Liza as Chris frowned a bit, he and Michael had never gotten along, Michael had been the golden child who could do no wrong and was the pride of their father’s eye while he was a failure as a son. <br />
“Ok…get them and once we chat a bit more I’ll video call you.” Typed Chris <br />
Liza wasn’t in the mode to wait, after a couple of minutes she got a request for a video call. Her eyes flicked up to the camera and saw that the lens was covered and therefore there was no way for them to see her. She accepted the call as the image of 23 year old younger sister, his clearly worried mother and his 35 year old older brother appeared. They were in her mother’s kitchen, looking at the two women of his family, she had to admit they did look somewhat alike, her bother and sister both had dirty blonde hair and Liza had long hair but none of them had her size breasts or nearly as blonde hair.<br />
“Chris…oh…my little boy is everything ok? They only told us that you made it through the transformation alive…are you ok?” inquired his mother “We can’t see you?”<br />
Chris looked down at her new massive chest, cat like features and her new body overall. He could try explaining everything over the <br />
“I am doing ok…just I am not your little boy anymore.” Answered Chris in her clearly female voice, her sister’s eyes widened as her mother seamed shocked and Michael leaned back a bit but seamed as distant as always. “The monster virus turned me into a women.”<br />
“So I got a big sister.” Said Liza trying to put on a happy face. <br />
“You did, however they say my age is now closer to 25 so I am not much older then you.” Stated Chris<br />
“So…what should we call you.” Said Michael his voice as cold as he always seamed to be. <br />
“I was think of going with Christina that way I could still go by Chris.” Answered Chris <br />
“We almost named you Christina if you had been born a girl that is.” Said her mother.  “Can we see  you?”<br />
Chris took a deep breath and pulled back the camera cover, within seconds her family saw what had become of their son/brother. For the longest time no one said anything as Chris just looked at her family, fear was building up within her, without even thinking about it her ears folded backwards a sign of fear.<br />
“Well…looks like I have a hot older sister.” Said Liza with a smile which caused a her heart to raise a bit. “I hope we can go shopping sometime soon, I signed the online petition to have that isolation law struke down.”<br />
Micheal glared at his sister and was about to speak up but their mother started speaking first.<br />
“Well you kind of look like my mother, your grandmother.” Said his own mother, “She had that shade of blonde hair...maybe the virus turned you into what you would been if you were born a women.”<br />
“No offense grandma didn’t have a rack like that.” countered Liza “I bet it is a pain on your back.”<br />
“I have only been walking around for a few hours.” answered Chris “But it feels so weird.”<br />
“I can believe it.” Said Liza with a smile. “What type of monster are you anyhow?”<br />
“They call it a Neko…I am basically human but I have cat ears, a tail, claws and eyes.” explained Chris<br />
“So it could be a lot worse.” Said his mother<br />
“Better if you had never caught the virus and instead remained in your dead end job.” preached Michael as the ears went back again. “Only those who do not follow the faith of God get this virus.”<br />
“Michael…you know that isn’t true.” Scolded Liza as her mother remained quiet, Michael like their father was a preacher for their local church and like their father was a very conservative Christian. <br />
They were the kind who preached anti-gay marriage, anti-evolution, hell and brimstone, was borderline raciest if not openly raciest and anti-modern culture. Their father was the worse, he had considered it a great boon to allow his children to date instead of the old fashion court and to allow his daughter to go to college. Chris had always thought the only reason why their father had allowed Liza to go to school was because she wanted to be a teacher and that was an “acceptable” job for a women. It helped that Liza threatened to join the military if she wasn’t allowed to go to school, Liza had always been the black sheep of the family. <br />
Like their father, Michael followed their faith to the letter, Chris had always fane faith but that was to keep the peace, Liza she openly fought against the faith and it drove their father crazy. As for their mother, she had spent to long in the faith and she believed she had to follow her husband’s word to the letter. <br />
“Michael, there is nothing we can do about it now, now we need to support Chris and…” started their mother going against her oldest son now only son, that was rare. It didn’t last long as the door to the house opened and after a few moments their father walked into the room. He was built like a tank, with balding hair and dressed in a clean suit. His eyes flicked to the screen and Chris felt her ears go back in fear. <br />
“Hello father.” Said Chris, her voice shaking a bit.<br />
“Lisa, shut that thing up.” Ordered their father<br />
“What?” inquired Liza<br />
“Do I have to repeat myself, that thing.” Stated their father pointing at the image of Chris. “That thing isn’t human and deserves nothing but death and…”<br />
“And that is your daughter!” yelled Lisa as she stood up only to stop when her father pulled back his hand ready to slap her. <br />
“I am your father and you WILL OBEY ME!” ordered their father<br />
“It’s ok…Liza.” Said Chris as her instincts to protect her sister. <br />
“Christina.” Said Liza as Chris smiled a bit. <br />
“Your actually the 1st person to call me that…but it’s ok.” Stated Chris fighting back tears. “Just stay safe and know that I love you, even you father.”<br />
“I don’t need the love of a monster.” Stated their father, like always their mother simply lowered her head in acceptance while Michael grinned in agreement with his father.<br />
“Alright.” said Liza giving up the fight for the moment. “Goodbye.”<br />
“Goodbye.” said Chris as she ended the call, she looked at the black screen and the image of the blonde hair neko before her. Tears began to come and within moments it was more then she could handle, she broke down and started crying, her body shaking in ugly crying.<br />
She almost jumped a mile high when a hand touched her back.<br />
“Are you ok?” said a concerned voice as Chris looked up to see…</p>
