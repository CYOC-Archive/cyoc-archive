<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Led into Mervan&#39;s, Dion learned that his mother had another reason for taking him with her. As they entered the store, collected a cart and started towards the girl&#39;s section of clothes, Dion heard his mom comment, &quot;While we&#39;re here, I want to see if I can get you some of your summer things,&quot; and thinking he knew what this meant, Dion suppressed a shudder at the thought of owning more girl&#39;s clothes. Wondering if this might be a good opportunity to slip something else in the cart, he tried to figure out how.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something for Holly should be easy,&quot; he told himself as his mom began to browse a couple of the wracks and drifting over to one of the tables, he peered at the selections as his mom said, &quot;Don&#39;t wander to far.&quot;<br />
<br />
Absently, Dion nodded and responded with a, &quot;I won&#39;t,&quot; and turning his attention to shirts, he thought they looked like they had been dumped on the table instead of having been carefully folded and placed, like most of the other items on the nearby tables. Picking up a blue shirt with kangaroo on the front, Dion peered at the tag, saw that it was 5T, and asked himself, &quot;Should I try and turn Holly into a five year old girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s cute,&quot; his mom said, startling and distracting him from his thoughts and at loss as to what he should say, Dion was grateful when his mom told him, &quot;Put it in the cart. Sophia will love it,&quot; before turning back to what she was doing.<br />
<br />
The top going in the cart, which he saw already had a couple items in it, and turning away, he gazed longingly at the boy&#39;s section. Trying to figure out a way to get away he was disappointed when his mom said she wanted his help as she began to alternate between picking items for his cousins and a couple things for him. Telling him, &quot;Your swimsuit looks like it&#39;s starting to pinch,&quot; she started going through the offered selections, asking him what he thought of each as she did. Seeing that some of them had printed images on them, but that most were brightly coloured and girly with ruffles and sparkly bits, Dion was tempted to say he didn&#39;t want any of them and ask if he could just wear shorts and a shirt.<br />
<br />
But knowing his mom wouldn&#39;t go for it, he resigned himself to choosing one. Looking at the different choices, he selected a white one with ice blue shading on specific parts. Putting in the cart after his mom had nodded in approval, Dion mentally shuddered when the thought, &quot;It is kind of cute. And will be comfortable,&quot; crossed his mind.<br />
<br />
Worried by what he&#39;d just thought, and how right it felt thinking so, Dion frowned and glanced in the direction of the boy&#39;s clothing. His mom busy with something, he took a couple steps away, but stopped when his mom told him, &quot;Here. Go into the changing rooms and try these on,&quot; and before he knew it, he&#39;d had several pairs of shorts thrust into his hands and he was turned and pushed in the direction of the booths for trying on clothes.<br />
<br />
Once more, he thought about refusing. And one again he didn&#39;t as he trudged toward the area indicated, went in, and proceeded to try on the mixture of jean shorts, cotton shorts, and denim rompers, coming out each time for his mom to inspect what he had on. Disliking the cotton shorts the most, as they were all brightly coloured and rode high, he was glad when his mom decided against them, but was still disappointed when she put the jean shorts and denim rompers in the cart, as he knew it meant that, if he couldn&#39;t find a way to undo what Holly had done, he&#39;d be spending the summer wearing them.<br />
<br />
When he&#39;d finished that, Dion thought he would have a chance to slip over the boy&#39;s clothing section, but was disappointed when his mother announced, &quot;That should about do it,&quot; and then led him out of the clothes department and to the front of the store. Quietly following, frustrated he&#39;d be stuck as a girl for a bit longer, he mentally sighed and thought, &quot;Might as well confront Holly, apologise to her for what I did, and use the amulet on her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Feeling this was the best he could do for the moment, he wondered if maybe he could talk Holly into helping him, but decided it wouldn&#39;t work when he reminded himself of what he&#39;d planned to turn his sister into. Following his mom out Mervan&#39;s Department Store, he barely paid attention when she asked him to load the stuff in the car, which he silently did, then climbed in. Mulling over things on the drive home, he was relieved when his mom told him, &quot;Take your stuff out and put it in with you dirty laundry. I&#39;ll wash it tonight,&quot; as they pulled into the driveway. Thinking this would give a chance to snag the shirt he&#39;d selected to use on Holly, he exited the car and was about to grab the bags, but stopped when he noticed the two goats.<br />
<br />
Confused by what he was seeing, Dion mumbled &quot;Holly?&quot; as he watched one the two animals headbutt the walls on the pen and collecting the clothing, he hurried into the house, scared that something had happened to his sister, beyond what he&#39;d intended.<br />
<br />
Having only wanted her to start transforming, then come to her with a way to go back, the ten year old boy turned ten year old girl tore up the stairs. His dad yelling, &quot;Stop tearing about like that,&quot; the bags banging against his legs and twisting in his hands, Dion breathed a hasty, &quot;Sorry,&quot; as he slowed and walked up the last couple steps. Upstairs, he hurried as quickly as he could to his room and after he deposited the bags on his bed, he ducked back down the hall to Holly&#39;s bedroom. Pushing open the door, hoping to see her, or even her familiar bedroom, he found his hopes dashed when all he saw was a room that was empty except for a bare bed and a box of what looked to be clothes.<br />
<br />
The edge of the door frame pressed painfully into his back as he leaned against it. Staring at the room that had been his sister&#39;s for as long as he could remember, Dion thought how he hadn&#39;t wanted it to go this far. Feeling out of sorts, unaware he was doing so, he made his way back to his room. Thinking of the goats he&#39;d seen, certain that one of them was his sister, he found himself at a loss as to which was Holly. Moving over to his bed, he absently took out the shorts, romper, and swimsuit his mom had gotten him then, after a moment&#39;s thought, the blue shirt with the kangaroo on it. Setting the garments to the side, he shoved the rest of the clothes back into the bags and took them back downstairs. Leaving them on the kitchen table, Dion slipped back on his shoes, headed outside and toward the goat pens.<br />
<br />
The more of the active of the two, upon seeing him, began bleating loudly, in addition to butting its head against the walls and gate, as well as kicking out with its back legs every so often. Watching this, and the other one, which had walked toward the edge of the pen to gaze coolly at him, Dion wondered which one was his sister.<br />
<br />
Indecisive, he thought it was going to cause another issue and after a bit, he told them, &quot;I don&#39;t know which one of you is Holly. I don&#39;t even know if you even understand what I am saying. But, I want you to know. I&#39;m sorry. It was never supposed to go this far. I just wanted you to change a little, then I&#39;d give you the option to change back. I wanted you to see, to understand, what I am going through. What I have gone through. I&#39;m sorry that it went this far. Especially with how messed up it seems to have made aunt Michelle&#39;s life. I&#39;m sorry. As soon as I get the chance, I am going to make this right,&quot; and staring at the two animals a bit longer, the one staring at him never taking its eyes off him, whilst the more active one had finally settled down a little and was only bleating every so often, Dion whispered, &quot;Believe me. I&#39;m sorry. I will find a way fix this,&quot; before turning away.<br />
<br />
No set direction, Dion wandered aimlessly, lost in thought, before finally heading back inside. Dropping down on the couch, one leg over the arm of it, the other dropped over the side so his foot was almost touch the floor, he stared up at the ceiling. Thoughts drifting to the amulet he still believed safely tucked away, he figured that tonight was the best time to undo what had befallen Holly. Knowing it would have to wait until after his parents went to bed, he wondered how long he&#39;d have to wait. Hoping it wouldn&#39;t have to be too long, he asked himself, &quot;So which goat is my sister?&quot; but found he didn&#39;t know how to answer that.<br />
<br />
Unhappy that he&#39;d have to guess, he then wondered how long he&#39;d have to remain a girl before he was able to change back. Hoping it wouldn&#39;t be too long, he didn&#39;t hear his mom enter until she exclaimed, &quot;Denise Taylor. Don&#39;t lie on the couch like that,&quot; and as he hastily adjusted how he was laying on the couch, Dion listened as she told him, &quot;It&#39;s not good for the furniture and you look unladylike with your legs open like. Like some boy,&quot; before then saying, &quot;And when you&#39;re done moping about, go set the table for dinner,&quot; and knowing she wouldn&#39;t tolerate him lollygagging, Dion quickly pushed himself off the couch and headed for the kitchen.<br />
<br />
The smell of dinner cooking stronger as he stepped into the room, Dion sighed and did as his mother told him. Finishing, he was told, &quot;Dinner will be ready in about fifteen minutes,&quot; as he left and nodding, he headed back upstairs.<br />
<br />
His mind drifting toward the necklace, he decided that, after he&#39;d figured out which goat was his sister, he might have to do something with the other one, as his memories insisted his mom bought them as a pair for a number of reasons, including they were meant to keep each other company. Inside his room, he located the rubber gloves and after setting them with the blue shirt, making sure both weren&#39;t too noticeable upon entering his bedroom, he turned to the loose floorboard and proceeded to pull it up. Peering into the hole, he blinked at the lack of the familiar Ziploc bag and after staring at it a bit, stuck first his hand in and felt around, then pushed his face in as far as he could get it to go in an attempt to peer into the space below.<br />
<br />
Starting to panic, he sat back after a some time and stared at the hole. Thinking, &quot;What the hell?!&quot; then, &quot;No. I cannot remain like this. Holly cannot be a goat,&quot; he again stuck his hand down beneath the floor, pushed his arm down as far as he could reach, and searched frantically. But after a couple more minutes of doing so, he huffed in agitation when he found he had no choice but to accept the fact that the Amulet of Zulo was missing as he cursed, then mumbled about how the thing was stupid and only seemed to lead to one problem after another.</p>
