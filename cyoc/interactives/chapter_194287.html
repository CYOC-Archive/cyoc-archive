<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Greg wiped his lips and let out a deep, satisfied sigh as the delivery driver chuckled and reeled his massive, softening cock back into his jeans. He’d been feeling a bit hungry in the evening and out of habit, he’d logged onto his favorite food delivery service app and tried to order a meal before remembering that he didn’t need to eat foot anymore. Well, solid food anyway. However, he’d been surprised to find that the app had a small-dick setting, and within fifteen minutes a driver had been on his way to Greg’s apartment to feed him a load. The man was in his early 20s, wiry but with a big, 15-inch cock and heavy balls full of delicious cum that tasted vaguely like the deep-dish pizza from the restaurant the man worked for. <br />
<br />
“This is turning into the best job I ever had,” he chuckled as he pulled his zipper closed over his obscene bulge. “Thanks, small-dick. You got a tip for me, shorty?” he asked, holding his hand out expectantly.<br />
<br />
Greg, naked and on his knees on the floor of his living room floor, shook himself from his stupor and reached for his discarded jeans to extract his wallet. “Yes sir,” he said. “Thank you, sir. Your cum is delicious.” Greg said, handing the man some twenties. <br />
<br />
“Thanks, boy,” he grinned as he counted out the money. “I get that a lot; boss even gave me a raise from all the happy reviews from small-dicked sluts like you.” He nuzzled Greg’s cheek playfully with his knuckle. He checked his phone. “Well, I gotta go pick up a pizza delivery for a real man. I’d slip him your name, but I’d hate to lose business. Later, shrimp dick!” He chuckled, walking out the door and leaving Greg a moaning, sticky mess on the floor.<br />
<br />
Greg left the living room to go take a shower. As he rinsed the sweat off himself, he found himself wishing that he always had a man around to feed him and love him and humiliate him, at any hour of the day. Sure it was convenient and kind of hot that he could just call up a large-dicked man to suck off whenever he wanted, but something about that arrangement seemed off to Greg’s corrupted, small-dick mind. Large-dicks like Larry or the delivery driver or the now countless men he’d sucked off and been fucked by in his apartment complex didn’t deserve to just wait around at the beck and call of a small-dick like Greg! They were real men, with big, juicy cocks to prove that. Greg was just a small-dick, his body designed by evolution for their pleasure. If anything, they should be able to call short-dicked losers like him whenever they needed relief. Being taunted and used by all those men over the last few days had certified Greg’s understanding of his place beneath the men he perceived to be greater than himself. He wanted to make one last adjustment with the book, so that all the small-dicks on earth would know their place serving and worshipping real men.<br />
<br />
Greg cut the water and stepped out of the shower, quickly drying himself before darting back to the living room and grabbing the Book. He opened it up to a fresh page, grabbed a pen, and thought carefully before writing his newest addition:<br />
<br />
“Small-dicks are required by law and conditioned by society to always be in the legal custody of a large-dick. Before adulthood, small-dicks are supervised and often escorted by their fathers; these men who father small-dicks, as well as the large-dick brothers of small-dicks, have a natural instinct to avoid sex with their small-dick sons. However, they cannot resist humiliating them for their size and their place in society, and will feed them if there are no other men available. When they become adults, the rights to a small-dick can be bought from the father by another large-dick for a sum agreed upon by the two men. This is not a form of legal slavery; rather a contract of legal guardianship similar to a marriage license. Because small-dicks only need to consume large-dick cum to survive, they provide services to their large-dick masters such as cooking, cleaning, and of course, sexual release. Small-dicks can be purchased by one man, a group, or even hired contractually by a business. However, they are not legally allowed to own property, have bills in their name, drive, or apply for a job or college without permission from their large-dick masters. A large-dick has the ability produce a special hormone in his cum, at will, which makes a small-dick completely loyal and subservient to his large-dick master. A large-dick’s status is determined by his cock, with Men being classed according to length, girth, and ball volume.”<br />
<br />
Greg removed the pen from the page and reviewed the lines, the world around him vibrating a little as the changes took effect. He had a sudden, additional thought and hostility scribbled it down before the change took full effect. <br />
<br />
“A rare strain of the flu virus exists, causing 1% of infected large-dick men to change into small-dicks. The transformation is permanent, but a vaccine against the virus exists.” He finished. <br />
<br />
Just as Greg closed the book, a large, hirsute naked man with a soft dick that hung to his knees walked out of his bedroom, drying his hair with a towel.<br />
<br />
“What’re you doing, boy?” he barked, but his handsome, bearded face looked calm. “I thought we were getting ready to go out?”<br />
<br />
Greg was startled at first before his new memories began to settle in. “Sorry, Daddy. Just screwing around,” he giggled, fingering his hard dicklet.<br />
<br />
“Don’t touch that little nub of yours, boy,” his Daddy warned. “I’ve got all the cock you need right here. Why don’t you let Daddy feed his boy some dinner before we got out. We gotta get you nice and ready for when you meet by friends.” He chuckled darkly. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, in another state…<br />
<br />
Colby winced, feeling a strange, buzzing sensation in the back of his head as the radio in his car went to static for a moment before going clear again. The sensation passed, and Colby shook it off, eager to get home and shower off before work. He was disappointed, but not surprised, that Tyler was still not far enough along in his small-dick transition to take Colby’s full length. Colby was willing to be patient; Tyler didn’t know this, but Colby had also been saving up for a long time, hoping to buy himself a small-dick for the two of them for college as a graduation surprise. Now that his friend Tyler had turned out to be a small-dick himself, Colby felt like even more pressured to make more money. He wanted to buy Tyler for himself, not just as the small-dick sub he was meant to be, but also as his friend. He loved mocking Tyler’s pathetic little cocklet, loved how manly and well-hung he was becoming while his friend’s dick just shriveled away. But on the other hand, Colby felt a desire to claim the small-dick, to keep his sexy mouth and tight ass for his own and shelter him from the meaner, more aggressive large-dicks in the world. Like his brothers and his father, Colby thought with bitterness. His father had a reputation for being especially cruel and humiliating to small-dicks he would meet, saying he had a nose for sniffing out “limp-clit faggots” and giving them what they needed. His brothers were no different, but they made good money out of college and if any one of them got word of Tyler’s transition they’d snatch him up in a heartbeat. He wasn’t worried too much about it though; sure his father was the largest man in the family with a 21 inch cock, but his brothers were each hovering around 18 inches. Colby’s big cock tightened in his pants as he imagined himself, the youngest in the family, inheriting a cock almost as big as his father’s.</p>
