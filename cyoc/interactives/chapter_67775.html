<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rick rushed to the bathroom, he knew something was wrong.  His cock hurt <br />
like hell, felt like it was so hard he could break glass with it if he <br />
hit it hard enough.   He frantically pulled off his pants and stared <br />
down at his member, and sure enough, it was quite erect.  Not only that, <br />
but it was more heavily veined than he remembered.  He examined the <br />
veins closely, and to his horror, he discovered that they were throbbing  <br />
at a frightening pace.  He suddenly felt an uncontrollable urge to jack <br />
off...<br />
<br />
&quot;What the Hell?  Why do I have this urge?  There is nothing more un-<br />
erotic than this!&quot; he said to himself.  But the more he thought about <br />
it, the harder it was to ignore, and so at last, he began to stroke his <br />
hands up and down his shaft.  It felt like someone had injected it with concrete, it was so hard!  Every <br />
stroke of his hands felt like he was spreading fire over his dick, like hot magma was being pushed up towards <br />
his cockhead, making it swell...<br />
<br />
Suddenly, he slowed his strokes down.  Either his eyes were deceiving him, or his ministrations were somehow <br />
making his cock longer!  He stared at it and slowly pushed the flesh of his Corpus Cavernosa towards the tip <br />
of his cock, and sure enough, he saw it stretch out like a Slinky in the hands of a two year old.  Fascinated, <br />
he kept stroking, pulling his cock out until it was about 12 inches long.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's long enough.&quot; he said to himself, and he let go of his cock.  Or tried to, because as he found out to <br />
his chagrin, he couldn't release the death grip he had on his wang.  In fact, the harder he tried to force <br />
himself to let go, the tighter his grip on his shaft became.  He cringed as he felt his hot blood forced to <br />
the tip of his cock, making his mutant dick thicker and thicker until it was more than an inch and a half <br />
bigger around than it had been.  It looked less like a human penis now, and more like one that a horse or <br />
donkey might possess.<br />
<br />
But it wasn't a donkey dick.  The head did not flare out like that of a jackass, it did quite the opposite.  <br />
His head had become even more conical than it had been, making his new pud look like a big loaf of liverwurst <br />
with a gigantic mushroom cap on the end.  He stared at this monstrosity in disbelief, when a tightening in his <br />
nether regions reminded him that he hadn't yet cum, even after all the time he had spent choking the chicken.  <br />
He squeezed his eyes shut, nearly biting a hole in his lips from the pain, and still his body would not let <br />
him release.<br />
<br />
Through tear-stained eyes, he watched his dick quiver, then throb, then thrash violently as his balls churned, <br />
semen boiling like a pot of ramen noodle water left on the stove for too long.  Before his frightened eyes, <br />
his testicles began to swell, enlarging to match his gigantic cock.  It was only then that he felt his <br />
volcanic load explode out his urethra, splattering onto the mirror like hand lotion shot out of a firehose.<br />
<br />
He breathed a huge sigh of relief, glad that the worst jerk he had ever experienced was over.  As if to <br />
confirm his sentiments, his cock at last went flaccid, smacking against his thigh with a loud &quot;SLAP&quot; noise.  <br />
He pulled his pants back up onto his body, looking forlornly at the gigantic bulge he had just grown.  How was <br />
he going to hide this?  He had always wanted a bigger cock, but not quite this big; he would never be able to <br />
penetrate any woman with this gigantic meatpole without hurting her.<br />
<br />
He sighed heavily, and took a roll of toilet paper off the side of the toilet and tried to clean his spunk off <br />
the mirror.  To his horror, it had already dried; now it looked like a glob of drywall or calk that some <br />
careless contractor had accidentally sprayed somewhere he didn't intend it to go.  He put his hands over his <br />
head, digging his fingers into his temples.  How was he going to explain this to his roommate?</p>
