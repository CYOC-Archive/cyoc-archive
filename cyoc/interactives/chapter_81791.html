<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ben and Mike shifted their perception of reality. There they stood in pin striped suits. Knowing that they are <br />
involved but somehow not family they looked the same. There was definitely a resemblance to each other <br />
somewhat like distant relatives but that didn't seem to make sense.<br />
<br />
The got into the waiting limo and headed off.<br />
<br />
Almost 30 minutes later they pulled up to one of the most impressive modern homes. There was a plain concrete <br />
wall surrounding the compound with evenly spaced palm trees providing the only decoration to an otherwise <br />
boring facade. They went through the gates and pulled up to a fully squared building with no windows facing <br />
the front. As they got out of the house and stepped up the three steps and headed down the walk way there was <br />
a perfectly manicured lawn absent of any plantings. As they went down the walk the two wings along the side <br />
showed floor to ceiling windows reflecting the image of the two.<br />
<br />
The doors swung open as they approached. The doors were large steel doors that rose floor to ceiling, 20 foot <br />
high. There were two muscled men in well fitted suits standing there like sentries.<br />
<br />
Bobby came running up to Ben. Taking him aside for a moment he talked to Ben for a few moments and Ben <br />
motioned one of the guards to him and off he went down the front steps and into the limo.<br />
<br />
The Zeus family wasn't really a family. No one messed with the Zeus' but it wasn't because they were some sort <br />
of Mafia even though those few that did have a run in with any of them went missing shortly. No one knew where <br />
they got their money but they never seemed short of cash.<br />
<br />
The two continued on toward the back of the home. It was sparsely furnished with large leather sofas, a <br />
massive fireplace that seemed out of place in the warm environment but the large fireplace dominated the <br />
middle of the great room surrounded by sofas and a flue rising through the middle of the roof.<br />
<br />
The back wall was full glass 20 foot tall single panes. There through the windows was the only thing that had <br />
any sort of form to it at all. Through the windows was a swimming pool that looked almost like a jungle area. <br />
Almost a mountain at the back with all sorts of jungle growth. Behind the mountain was a continuation of the <br />
modern house. There in one of the cabanas was another family member. He was laying there in a pin striped <br />
speedo next to another man that didn't look like any of the other people Ben or Mike had seen. He too was <br />
wearing a pin striped speedo but his was much larger. He had to be almost 300 pounds and not an ounce of <br />
muscle.<br />
<br />
Hey boys he called from the cabana. Come on in the water is fine. <br />
<br />
A lounge chair was pulled up for each of the two and a plain white rope was held up as they disrobed and put <br />
on pin striped speedos.<br />
<br />
Laying there in the sun they were each offered a mojito by one of the muscled guards and as Mike looked <br />
through his sunglasses he saw as a rather large man emerged from the pool. The water glistening off his soft <br />
round body. He wasn't as large as the one that was laying next to them but he came straight toward Mike.<br />
<br />
Bobby has been having a little trouble with that boy again. Ben said to Hollister, the man laying in the <br />
cabana.<br />
<br />
Did you take care of things?<br />
<br />
They are being taken care of now. I sent Walter to check things out.<br />
<br />
They sat in the sun when Walter came back and bent down to Ben and whispered something to him. Ben rose and <br />
excused himself putting on a robe disappearing behind the mountain with Walter.<br />
<br />
What are you going to do to me Timbur was almost crying as Ben went through the door.<br />
<br />
You had a few things to say to Bobby?<br />
<br />
No! No! I didn't say anything. Really I didn't.<br />
<br />
Bobby is that so?<br />
<br />
He called me a fat fuck and pushed me down. <br />
<br />
No! I didn't. Really I didn't.<br />
<br />
Bobby tell me the truth. What happened. <br />
<br />
That was it sir.<br />
<br />
Well now who to listen to. Do I believe Bobby who knows what would happen to him if he lied to me or do I <br />
listen to someone that has no idea what might happen.<br />
<br />
Timbur I think you are losing the veracity issue.<br />
<br />
NO PLEASE he started to cry. Don't kill me.<br />
<br />
Kill you? We don't kill anyone.<br />
<br />
Then what are you going to do to me?<br />
<br />
Well to start you are going to be turned into a total bottom bitch.<br />
<br />
But I'm not gay.<br />
<br />
Look son. Ben placed his hands around Timbur's face. I don't care. You are going to so crave something up your <br />
ass and lose interest in using your own cock on women, men, pets...<br />
<br />
No please I will be nice to Bobby from now on.<br />
<br />
Oh that is a given.<br />
<br />
It should take about a month to make you crave cock. After that you are going to be turned into a love slave.<br />
<br />
A love slave?<br />
<br />
Oh yea all sorts of pleasure centers created for you. The first of which is to enlarge your body.<br />
<br />
Timbur looked around at Ben and the muscled boys and started to think this might not be so bad.<br />
<br />
Don't get your hopes up boy. This is not your pleasure center. You will be Bobby's pleasure center. And since <br />
he is into big boys you are going to be fattened up.<br />
<br />
Timbur's eyes got big as saucers. As big as him?<br />
<br />
Now Bobby wasn't that big only about 250 pounds but that was what initiated the taunts that caused this <br />
predicament for Timbur.<br />
<br />
Oh no. You will need to please Bobby and to do that you must be large enough for him. And that will be at <br />
least twice as big as him maybe three times as big. The bigger you get the more sensitive your body will be to <br />
his touch and so 500 to 800 pounds of flesh will be good for you.<br />
<br />
Timbur began to cry again. Bobby and Ben left as an almost hidden wall slid open exposing all sorts of anal <br />
probes the begin the transition of Timbur into Bobby's sex slave.</p>
