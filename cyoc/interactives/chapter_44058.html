<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>Delighted with his Alpha's response, Chad pushed on the was as he had done several times and revealed the secret elevator to Rusty. As they stepped in, Chad right behind Rusty, Rusty could not help but feel as things were just moving a little quicker than expected. To him, it was just a few hours ago that he stepped into the portal, but when in reality it was fifteen years from the day he stepped through. Rusty would not have believed Chad's words at all, but on the wall to the right of the entry way, Chad had a calendar up with the year being exactly fifteen years from what he knew when Rusty stepped through. Rusty just shook his head ever-so-slightly so not to cause any sort of suspicion in Chad's mind. Rusty did want his kind to flourish and not be trapped like some savage beasts in the mansion. As the door closed, the elevator descended both slowly and ever so silently, which was astounding for their increased and acute hearing, down into the depths of the earth, then stopped when they reached the lab.</Br>
<Br>As the door opened, Chad stepped with a big smile on his face while he continued to walk where he had been working on the werewolf serum. Rusty, a bit in awe of the place, never expecting something like this to even exist down here, took his time to take in the size of the lab. The ceiling on the room was at least fifteen feet, a full eight feet or so from his current human height and six from his bipedal wolf stance and height. The width and the length of the room was perfectly square by twenty feet give or take on each side. Throughout the lab there were silver pens meant to keep the turned humans locked up once the serum worked until they fully transformed and their mental state was similar to the pack's. There were large stainless steel tables with straps made to keep a human's arms and legs pinned during experimentation. There were several chemical labs set up, several centrifuges to process the blood and see if it was mixing. There were just all sorts of machinery and equipment scattered about the room, half of which Rusty had no comprehension of while the other half he could make an educated guess as to what they were for. Rusty also realized that not all of the equipment down there was in relation to blood work and culturing. Not wanting to think about it any longer, Rusty moved over to Chad while Chad held a vial of a thick violet liquid.</Br>
<Br>"Isn't this the most wonderful thing you have seen Rusty... my alpha?" Chad asked while just staring at the violet liquid. "This... this is what will give us free reign over the land the humans occupy."</Br>
<Br>As Chad spoke, he heard almost a level of malice in his voice, hating the creature he once was. "Well... lets not get too caught up in things, there is still a chance that it may not bond with human blood."</Br>
<Br>Chad gave Rusty a sour look, knowing that he was trying his Alpha's superiority and leadership, but Chad felt that Rusty was being too much of an unbeliever. Chad had been spending almost every waking moment on the product he had in his hands.</Br>
<Br>"It... it's been tested on human blood Rusty."</Br>
<Br>"Oh... it has, has it. Weren't you the one that just told me a little bit ago that you just made the breakthrough a couple days ago. Also, when did you leave to go acquire human blood, not to mention where did you get some? You certainly didn't attack a human just to get his or her blood... did you?"</Br>
<Br>"No my liege, not at all. Yes, it was a couple days ago, but with all due respect, I have had human blood delivered here, a pint a week, so not to cause suspicion. I have a friend who works at the hospital in the city that is a phlembotomist. He first gave me a heavy lecture, but when I lied and told him that it was for experiments to cure HIV and AIDS virus, he agreed that I could have what I asked for. When he agreed to it, he said that the condition was that I had to test it on him first."</Br>
<Br>"So, your friend then has HIV or AIDS?"</Br>
<Br>"He isn't certain, to be honest. A while back, he told me that he was working with tainted blood and there was an accident when he changed out the needles from the bad to a clean one. He said that when he was making the swap, that was when he poked himself. So far, he continually comes up as negative, but even his doctors think that he could have it even if it isn't showing up."</Br>
<Br>"So... then what you are telling me is that you want to test it out on your friend first, see if the werewolf serum works, because if it does, then that illness would be eradicated by our blood."</Br>
<Br>"That is correct! So now do you see why this is so important to me Rusty?"</Br>
<Br>Rusty simply nodded his head. "Alright Chad, you have your way, but who do you know that is a female to test our blood on? Right now, we have killed the women who resided here fifteen years ago during our preliminary and only attack against them, so we don't know if a bite from us will kill them or free them of their humanity as it pretty much has with us."</Br>
<Br>"His girlfriend, loving him very much and not caring if she got the illness because she would not want to live without him, continuously has unprotected sex with him. To be honest, neither of them know if she has it, simply because of his state in the first place."</Br>
<Br>"Alright... make the necessary arrangements and have them both come over here. They will both be strapped to these tables until the serum has been injected into their circulatory systems. Then, if we notice change and especially resistance to the change, they will be placed into the cages until they are like us. Is that understood?"</Br>
<Br>Chad stepped back a couple steps while bowing. "Yes my liege. I am calling them right now."</Br>
<Br>Chad hurried over to the phone, dialed in the number and immediately his buddy picked up. Chad was not on the phone more than a couple of minutes when the conversation ended. As Chad expected, they were both ecstatic about the finding and agreed to be experimented on right away, and that would be within the next few minutes since they did not live very far from the Atwell Mansion. Rusty and Chad moved quickly to the elevator, then rushed to the main entry way and made everyone aware that they were having human guests over. The pack members who Rusty told, looked at him with a bit of confusion, but dared not question him as the alpha, then went on with their business while telling everyone else to be sure that there was no issue when the scent of human would waft into their keener noses.</Br>
<Br>Not more than fifteen to twenty minutes went by, when a dark blue Ford Focus pulled up near the front entry way. Chad and Rusty both greeted the couple, which Rusty could not help buy to eye both of them up and down. Chad's male friend was five foot nine inches tall, skinny and pasty white of a complexion, with short and spiky hair from his gel. His girlfriend was five foot four, nicely shaped, with long brown hair and a slightly darker complexion than that of her boyfriend.</Br>
<Br>"Welcome!" Rusty cheerfully greeted them, wanting them to feel disarmed in a place where they really had no place being.</Br>
<Br>The two just looked around the whole placed as they quickly moved through the building to their destination was more or less. They were both in a bit of awe and shock that the kind of research that Chad had been doing would be done in that place, of all places in the world, it was that place. They both lived in the town for what they both could remember about their lives, always hearing horror stories about what went on in Atwell Mansion. However, they were indeed glad to be there, just to have some hope that the virus that they may or may not have would still be obliterated if it was truly there. When they were all in the elevator hidden in Chad's room, they descended down into the labs and when the door opened, Chad let them out of the elevator car first.</Br>
<Br>"Alright you two. Since this treatment is experimental and we have no idea what will happen once you are injected, you will be strapped onto the tables over there. If things should go as planned, you will be moved into the cages for just a short period of time. It is our belief that if this does work, for the time of the injection's first run through your systems, you may exhibit fits of rage. So, the safest place is for you two to be in there."</Br>
<Br>The couple just looked at each other, shrugged and then moved to the tables as was instructed. Once they were strapped in securely, Chad administered the serum at ten cubic centimeters, or the length of your thumb nail. Immediately when the fluid went in, it was met with resistance from their bodies while they both tried to thrash Chad and Rusty. As quickly as the fit started, it ended and the treatment was over. Not wanting to take any chances, Chad moved the two into the cages and secured them. Standing there, Chad and Rusty waited and watched patiently to see what would happen. Suddenly, out of no where, both started to thrash around violently while something seemed more wrong with the female.</Br>
<Br>"Rusty, do you see what I am? The serum is working in Roger, but not in Samantha. How interesting!"</Br>
<Br>"What did you two do to Samantha?!" Roger shouted.</Br>
<Br>"The same thing we did to you, Roger. It seems that our serum doesn't work for women, in fact it seems to have spread up some sort of mass degenerative disease."</Br>
<Br>The three looked onward at Samantha in her cage, writhing in tremendous pain as everything shriveled up inside her, with her skin getting more and more taught by the second, literally sticking to her bones as her musculature was completely gone within seconds. Within a couple minutes, Samantha was nothing more than a pile of ash, but there was remarkable change in Roger. His muscles were huge, just as Chad and Rusty's. His body changed in every way that Chad and Rusty's had. Within a few more seconds, Roger howled out in his wolven form, feeling the last bit of what mainly made him human left. In his transformed state, Roger could not help but to sniff the air and take in all of the scents there, since this was new and completely foreign to him. He realized that everyone there, that was alive, was a creature like he was.</Br>
<Br>"What have you two made me into? I can not believe how I am feeling right now!"</Br>
<Br>As the Alpha, Rusty spoke up and addressed his new packmate. "Roger, we have made you into one of the immortals. You are a werewolf and I am your Alpha."</Br>
<Br>Not knowing if he was serious, while Roger thought he may have been joking, Roger sniffed Rusty's scent longer and realized that he was in fact the alpha. Roger somewhat bowed to his leader and Chad let him out to join their family.</Br>
<Br>Chad looked to Rusty with a smile. "Well, we know women will not accept this new blood within us, or any other infectious secretion for that matter. I just wonder if our saliva will work as well as the serum, not to mention how do you suppose we spread it out among the town?"</Br>
<Br>Rusty had no idea, he was just a paranormal investigator assistant before he became alpha of the only living werewolf pack that might exist by themselves. Chad also shrugged his shoulders at his own question when Rusty silently asked him the same thing. With no idea, they felt that the race of the werewolf would never get off the ground. That was, however, until Roger spoke up.</Br>
<Br>"Alpha, Chad... I have an idea that might work. I know a guy that can get this stuff into the public water supply. I just don't  know if that could work with the whole plan, if at all."</Br>
<Br>Chad and Rusty looked back at each other with a wide smile on their faces. Then Rusty spoke up. "Think nothing of it my brother! What is your plan, since we didn't have anything planned up till giving your the serum. We are definitely all ears!"</Br></p>
