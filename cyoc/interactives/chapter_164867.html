<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ken was of his situation as glad for having become a donkey. His fun fantasy had become for him as his new reality, and although there were a few drawbacks for living naked, he relished the size of his cock. He lost all human ideals for morality, as his having any thought about religion, that too had faded away. He knew he was an animal, just a thing to people, an item of property that could be sold and bought. None of that mattered to Ken, as his one greatest sought after desire was to standing as mounted, smiling when thrusting his long cock, and feeling his maleness working to delight him; no matter the cost.<br />
<br />
Janet the then jennet was new still at her being a donkey. She never wanted to be as anything other than of what she was born and having studied hard, was awarded a gold badge with the number 711. She thought her badge number would bring her good fortunes, the kind of what a person hopes to gain and live their life with a sense of dignity.<br />
<br />
Any sense of dignity she had, Janet lost when by not expecting she stepped away from the computer and entered the fate shifting green rays. Caught, made captive be the rays emitter, Janet like Ken their mind goes blank, they stop and stand like a deer caught baffled by the headlights of an on-coming vehicle.<br />
<br />
At the moment anyone who entered under the green ray emitter, their body and lifestyle was decidedly changed. The preset questions on the computer program determined the extent of change and the duration; or the length of time when being different and away from to what a person was born did redefine their desires and all manner of outlook for a dissimilar self.<br />
<br />
Janet awoke that fated day a human, she being slim, her body strong, agile in the extreme, and a rich kid from day one. She had from her father&#39;s earned wealth all the good graces of an education and the fun from knowing no need gone untried or owned. She was alone when by chance Janet stepped away from where she sat and came under the green rays.<br />
<br />
Eyes were closed and kept shut when struck by the weird green, pulsating rays. Janet mentally ceased to exist in her mind, and soon too as a portion of the human race. Her body came under attack and due to the surge of bodily changes, her clothing was the first to be as a loss. She became as one is when born, naked to the world, but she a victim to the computer program.<br />
<br />
Indeed, the brainy wit who wrote the program was of self a person with low self esteem. He or she wanted physically what they were not gifted by birth and imagined a way to gain, as help others to gain, as some found everything from being as new and different.<br />
<br />
Ken wanted in his foolish fantasy to be drastically different than to what he was born to his mother. His life was one failure after another, and the more of what he tried, the more he continued to fall short of the mark. When gifted the computer program and the ray emitter apparatus sent to him, he sought to correct his lifestyle, and especially his masculinity, wishing to gain of a long cock to fornicate as he so desired.<br />
<br />
Officer Janet had earned her idea of self esteem, but Ken having set and locked the program, left it capable to entrap others. Janet experienced a drastic level of humiliation made worse from her family and their debasing disdain. Her professional friends made unrelenting jokes and vulgar suggestions after they saw what had happened and doomed her. Her work-a-day world became an entangled mess as her body conformed to being that of a jennet donkey, and all she was faded before she went to reside at the animal control division of the local sheriff department. Her parents literally disowned their donkified daughter, seeing no hope for her to ever become again as human.    <br />
<br />
Defamed to being treated as if born a female donkey, as all she gained and learned was for becoming a common farm animal, she knew what it was to be a beast of burden, having degraded physically; left her praying to die.<br />
<br />
When Janet first saw then Ken being a male donkey and allowed to enter the corral where she spent most of any day, her human mind reeled at the prospect of the young stud donkey mating with her. She recalled the lurid comment said by her partner officer that from her becoming a donkey she gained a cunt worthy as it was big to equate her family wealth.<br />
<br />
Nerves flared, she shivered as her big nostrils took in the sweaty scent of male donkey musk. Her human mentality was revolted at the smell of Ken. Yet, she was in and out a donkey now, and the scent of a stud male caused her vulva lips to begin winking, flashing her sense of lust before a willing stud male.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, no,&quot; Janet thought as she harshly brayed and turned, trying to keep her bare rump from where the young stud could not mount and penetrate her sex.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, oh yes, praise be, a jennet donkey,&quot; Ken thought, he not knowing or if he knew could not care but to gain his male sense of delight by using his cock to nailing a feminine quest.<br />
<br />
Janet reared high up on her hind donkey legs, she pawing the air with her fore legs and two hard hoofs.<br />
<br />
Ken stood in awe, he gaining a good view of jennet teats and saw only a female for him to dominate.<br />
<br />
Janet being still agile and her body as muscular, she walked toward Ken as balanced on her hind legs, until she came close enough to drop back to standing on all fours; but as she dropped, her right fore-hoof slammed down hard on top of Ken&#39;s donkey skull.<br />
<br />
Naturally the hit hurt and Ken brayed, as he backed away from the cute jennet.<br />
<br />
Ken felt hurt and turned, he walked to the watering trough and began to drink. He as much ignored the jennet donkey, and his erect cock vanished back inside its protective sheath. He felt harshly sated from his wild desire for mating, and drank more water with a hope to sooth his aching head.<br />
<br />
As misery loves company, Janet wandered slowly toward the watering trough and she soon stood there drinking; but smelling the male musk. Ken raised his head, and turned it to look at Janet, the water dripping from between his black donkey lips.<br />
<br />
Janet noticed the Jack male look at her, and she did the same, as Ken knowing equine etiquette, did exhale softly his breath for the cute jennet to sniff and gain a better recognizing of someone wishing to be as a friend.<br />
<br />
It was then that her  #711 badge fate worked to enhance the beginning of a friendship.<br />
<br />
Jedidiah  Flycatcher was the animal control officer, and he stood quietly watching to see if the donkey police officer turned jennet would willingly allow any jackass to mate with her. He was a bit surprised as to her harsh disdain for another donkey; she denying Ken of his desire to mount, mate, and thrust!<br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings you two, as I believe the two of you need to become more formally acquainted. You there girly, you have become quite completely as a physical jennet, a female donkey. We shall allow you to retain your name as Janet rather than to cause you further mental difficulties.<br />
<br />
As for him, his name was and is still Ken, and it is from him and his fool wish to become a donkey, that you dear became, as the story was told to me, you were victimized, transformed is the proper word. That damn computer apparatus did somehow cause your bodily chemicals, your DNA and RNA to change, as miraculously, as totally altered you from what was you, to being this new bodily form.<br />
<br />
Ken here has known his being as a donkey for a longer while and by his actions, he has become accustomed to being a donkey and wants to be a Jack-stud male.  Ken meet here Janet, and you dear meet Ken as from what was told to me, the likelihood you both shall as permanently be remaining alike donkeys is very likely indeed!<br />
<br />
The Sheriff has so informed me to place both of you as set for adoption, and if not then come the first of the month you shall each be put up for sale at the auction. A sad end for two born people, as either or, your futures are based on your being animals and your perspective genders. As Janet could bear foals, and is strong, Ken if not wanted for his big balls and semen, may well be gelded, castrated, and become tamed for use as a pet or be around children.&quot; Jed told his two newest and larger boarders.<br />
<br />
Ken listened and understood perfectly, but shivered when he heard his balls might get cut off, as that would seal his donkey future as just another failure.</p>
