<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A speckled blue and white Australian cattle dog ran up to meet Cynthia at the same time Tony was making his way back to reconnect with David. Tony had not been expecting to see a dog in the horse facility, but having such a classic farm dog in such a farm like environment just seemed right some how.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Trusty, hey boy, why don&#39;t you come say hi to Tony. He&#39;s David&#39;s doggy. Why don&#39;t you show him what a good boy you are?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hearing Cynthia calling Trusty a good boy and watching her scratch between his ears made Tony feel a little bit jealous inside. He knew he had to play it cool, though, because he could not be overly distracted by other dogs and their owners if he was going to work in public as a police dog.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, hi Trusty, yeah, I&#39;m gonna be a drug dog, and I&#39;m sorry, Miss, your name is ... ?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sorry, Tony, my name is Cynthia. I don&#39;t know if David&#39;s told you, but I work with the people who wanted to be horses instead of dogs. I hope you&#39;re enjoying the Illusia Kennels program.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I really am, actually, you see--WHOA! just a second, um--&quot;<br />
<br />
There was cold wet nose at Tony&#39;s backside that had suddenly interrupted his thoughts. He spun around and looked right at the offending cattle dog, who was panting playfully and tilted his head to the side as though perplexed by Tony&#39;s reaction. Oddly enough, Tristan himself was not only able to smell Trusty from where he was standing, but there were aspects of the scent that he felt a curious urge to explore in more detail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Tony, aren&#39;t you going to be polite?&quot; David said, causing Tony to stop looking at Trusty and look to the humans again. &quot;You&#39;re not gonna leave Trust hangin&#39; like that, are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony looked back to down to the cattle dog and realized what David was saying to him. Tony lowered himself to the ground and started giving in to what his new nose really wanted him to do. It boggled Tony&#39;s mind that this was what would be considered POLITENESS for him from now on. He paced around to the other side of Trusty and found his target right underneath the speckled cattle dog tail wagging in front of him. He stopped for a moment to let himself appreciate how completely disgusting this was. (I&#39;m about to sniff some dirty animal&#39;s shithole! And I don&#39;t even have any way to hide my own ever again. Why the fuck did I sign those papers? But still...)<br />
<br />
Tony knew this was something dog&#39;s did, and the sooner he got it over with, the better, if only so that he could reassure himself how disgusting it was so that he wouldn&#39;t every have to do it again even after his transformation. But even from here, the scents from the asshole were making him even more curious, and there was no way to resist investigating. Soon Tony&#39;s nose was underneath Trrusty&#39;s tail sniffing it like it was a bouquet of flowers, and Tony was smiling! He now knew almost everything about this dog! He knew that Trusty was a relatively old dog, but still playful and with lots of energy to enjoy life with. He knew that this dog had been eating, and some of it smelled pretty tasty. He knew that Trusty was neutered and therefore not a threat to his sexual prowess (wow! That was a weird thought!) and he especially knew that Trusty had been eating other animals&#39; shit. (Yuck!! ... Right???) Tony came back around to face Trusty and actually felt as though he had made a new friend. They gave each other play bows, and then both of them ran off into horse barn to see what they could see.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, he&#39;s really getting into this, isn&#39;t he?&quot; said Cynthia with some amazement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. He&#39;s one of the quickest students I&#39;ve had,&quot; said David. &quot;But enough about him. Let&#39;s talk about what you&#39;re doing after work this evening...&quot;<br />
<br />
While the humans had there conversation, Trusty and Tony were having the time of their lives. Tony had a little trouble keeping up because he still had to do his actual running on two legs, but he managed. Trusty showed him some cool scents they could follow and sometimes just played chase with him. Trusty introduced him to the horses, some of whom were still partly human and wonder what Tony was doing there if he was turning into a dog. He told them about Illusia Kennels and said very nice things about David. Some of them were already standing on four hooves, which he thought was really amazing. Some of them were very obviously turning into male horses, and there was absolutely no way to miss the monster dongs that were dangling between their legs. Tony didn&#39;t know whether he would be more proud to have such a thing or more embarrassed to be permanently unable to hide it! But mostly, he didn&#39;t do a lot of talking to either horses or humans, because he was too busy playing with Trusty. Trusty had a lot of energy and liked a lot of attention. Tony liked it, too. By the time David called him back using that one of those special police dog commands from yesterday, the sun was setting and Tony knew that David was going to have to leave for the day. Either way, he felt a lot more comfortable detecting animals and objects by scent after that experience, and he hoped Megan would have some interesting experiences to share with him after dinner again.</p>
