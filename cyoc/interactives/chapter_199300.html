<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff really liked Brianna&#39;s happy expression whenever they were together, and he knew that one of the reasons for that was what was between his legs that it shouldn&#39;t be there and it was a secret that only the two of them knew. After his girlfriend drank his milk for the first time she started asking him to give her some to take to her school every week so she could feel like he was around even when they couldn&#39;t see each other in person, ended up making him keep his chotch-breast.<br />
<br />
Weeks later came the last week of classes before winter break, and when they said goodbye on Sunday, Brianna whispered in his ear that when they saw each other again that she was intending to give him something and that he had better be prepared. as she guided his hand between her legs, allowing him to feel her pussy through her pants. Jeff was excited by the idea and milked himself again that night thinking about Brianna.<br />
<br />
On Monday, Jeff, remembering his girlfriend&#39;s words at the farewell that he should be prepared, realized that in order to satisfy her he would need his dick back. With that in mind he decided it was time to use Chronivac to get back to normal, as it had been three months since he had his dick and he would need to relearn how to handle it properly before he met Brianna again.<br />
<br />
On Monday night he found himself lucky, as his parents went out to dinner with an aunt of his who was pregnant and the baby was due any moment, his brother went to a friend&#39;s house where he was going to participate in a study group with some classmates and would sleep over there, which meant he would be home alone all night.<br />
<br />
Jeff, as soon as he said goodbye and was sure his parents weren&#39;t around anymore, he went straight to his room and sat in front of the computer, opening the Chronivac Window to change his crotch-breast for his dick as it was before. It was at this moment that he exited. He realized he had gotten too attached to his crotch-breast and it wasn&#39;t that he didn&#39;t want his cock back, but he didn&#39;t want to lose the &#39;genital&#39; he had at the moment. He then decided that after he had satisfied Brianna he would trade his dick for the crotch-breast again.<br />
<br />
Since he was going to be without his breast for at least a week, Jeff took off his pants and bra to milk himself one last time before changing, and he did it while thinking about Brianna, remembering the times they&#39;d spent together, caressing his breast between his legs with one hand and with the other advancing the settings so that he came back had a dick again and he only needed to confirm it after coming, leaving no chance for regrets later. He circles the hardened nipple, then uses both hands to stimulate as much area as possible, feeling it grow as it filled with milk. He continued, stopping whenever he felt he was getting close to orgasm, wanting to hold on to the limit, remembering the time at the movies and the diner the other time.<br />
<br />
When Jeff felt he couldn&#39;t hold it any longer, he took a bottle he kept in his room and placed the tip against his nipple pretending to be Brianna&#39;s mouth, and let it out. He almost completely filled the bottle with his milk in the most intense orgasm he had ever achieved in a simple masturbation. After his orgasm ended he confirmed the change in Chronivac and waited for the breast between his legs to be replaced by his cock and balls, but time passed and nothing happened.<br />
<br />
**Brianna&#39;s side**<br />
<br />
Brianna is in the dorm where she stays during the week until she comes home on the weekends. She is with her roommate Jessica reviewing the topics they believe will be on the exams the next day, everything was going smoothly. Someone knocked on their bedroom door and it was a pizza they had ordered that arrived, so they decided to take a break to eat. As they ate they chatted, talking about subjects that started from gossip about celebrities until they ended up talking about their respective boyfriends, in which Brianna talked about everything but the secret he was keeping between his legs.<br />
<br />
After the break, the roommates went back to studying, but after a while Brianna began to feel discomfort in her stomach, which quickly became more intense.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry Jessica, I have to go to the bathroom. I think that pizza didn&#39;t suit me well.&quot; Brianna said<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem. If you need help just call me.&quot; Jessica said<br />
<br />
&quot;OK&quot; Brianna said and went to the bathroom. When she closed the door she looked down, as she felt as if her insides were being turned over, and she could see small bulges that appeared and disappeared, indicating that definitely something was happening there and was going down. She then started to feel a tingle in her clit and with that she lowered her pants along with her panties, thus seeing her clit getting bigger and bigger and hanging between her legs, stopping with approximately 5 inches of length. Then she felt her vagina getting full inside, she put a few fingers there trying to see what was happening, but not only did it not have the same depth as before but it decreased rapidly, pushing out her hand, at the same time skin grew covering the her grown clit. Brianna was already suspicious of what could be happening and bent over to get a better look at what was happening, only to find her vagina closing and disappearing completely, soon loosening up and what was moving inside her belly descended, resting on the newly formed ballsack between her legs. Finally any discomfort passed and she knew her transformation was complete, but now she found herself standing in the bathroom with a flaccid 5 inch cock hanging where her vagina had been just minutes before.<br />
<br />
**Jeff&#39;s side**<br />
<br />
Jeff started to worry if the Chronivac had trouble again, because his dick didn&#39;t show and he still had her breasts between his legs, so he tried to see what had happened. When he looked more closely at the screen he realized he had made a mistake, as he hadn&#39;t opened his file, but Brianna&#39;s. He remembered putting her file into Chronivac when he first turned it on and thought about testing it on her, but he thought it had also been erased along with the history when the program had problems before and he also had no intention of using it on her unless she asked.<br />
<br />
He knew that if it worked, he must have caused problems for his girlfriend, so Jeff set it up right away to fix his mistake. He prepared her change history and was ready to confirm when suddenly everything went black.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit, why did a blackout have to occur right now?&quot; Jeff said groping over the table looking for his cell phone in the dark. He found the device and activated the flashlight, but the battery was very low and it only lasted 1 minute before the device turned off. &quot;More trouble? Looks like I&#39;ve had a run of bad luck.&quot; He said and left feeling around the walls towards the kitchen, where he looked for some candles that should be in the cupboard. He found the candles, and while he was looking for matches, the blackout ended and the lights came on.<br />
<br />
Jeff quickly went back to his room and turned on the computer. A little over 10 minutes had passed and he needed to correct the mistake he made with Brianna. He started Chronivac and set it to undo the last change in Brianna, but his PC made a strange noise and a blue screen of error appeared. The PC had crashed and he tried to restart, but he noticed a burning smell and before he knew where it was coming from the computer completely shut down, no longer responding in any attempt to restart it. <br />
<br />
&quot;More bad luck. The blackout must have damaged something on my computer, now I can&#39;t do anything until I get it fixed. Could the situation get any worse?&quot; Jeff said and, as if to answer him, he felt that something was happening with the breast between his legs. His crotch-breast started to get bigger and grew until it doubled in size, the nipple was no longer centered but it didn&#39;t stay alone for long, as 3 pink points appeared and quickly became new nipples.<br />
<br />
Jeff started to worry, as he was already used to having a breast between his legs, but now that he was the size of his head and had four nipples it would hardly fit into his clothes. Concern for himself was great and he was sure Brianna would be willing to help him, but remembering his girlfriend his blood ran cold, as he feared that something else might have happened to her and he couldn&#39;t do anything about it.<br />
<br />
**Brianna&#39;s side**<br />
<br />
Brianna was surprised at the sudden change, but then she remembered Jeff telling her about the show that turned him and wondered if he could have done that to her. Did it really work remotely? Somewhat relieved of the surprise she felt the need to pee, and with that she went to the toilet to pee standing up for the first time. Finishing with her needs she pulled on her pants and panties again, which to her relief still worked even though they were tighter now, and a small bulge had formed in the front.<br />
<br />
Brianna went back to the bedroom and told Jessica that she was feeling a little better now, but that she would need to go to bed early. Her roommate took pity and decided to go to sleep too, so they changed clothes (Brianna had her back to Jessica the entire time) and put on their pajamas, then lay down and turned out the lights.<br />
<br />
Brianna waited for Jessica to sleep to get in touch with Jeff, but while waiting she felt something was happening on her cock and her panties getting even tighter, she then lowered her pajama bottoms and stuck her head under the blanket, lighting up with the light of her cell phone, and saw that her dick was getting bigger, reaching twice its previous length, following her member her balls also got bigger, leaving her ballsack huge, bigger than she expected it could get , while her cock got strangely too wide for her.<br />
<br />
The transformation stopped and with that Brianna took her odd looking cock, realizing there was something out of the ordinary to the touch and as soon as she retracted the foreskin she was presented with the sight of the tip of not one, but two cocks. She had 2 cocks inside the same skin, both were almost 10 inches long and still limp. she then analyzed her ballsack and discovered that she now had four testicles the size of hen&#39;s eggs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this Jeff&#39;s doing? What does he mean by doing this to me? I have to contact him immediately and ask him to undo this.&quot; Brianna thought and was already getting ready to text Jeff when she got a message from him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brianna, please answer me asap. Brianna, please answer me asap. Did something strange happen to you?&quot; Jeff&#39;s message read<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it happened. I believe you have something to do with it, so I would like you to undo it as soon as possible.&quot; Brienne wrote back<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s as I feared. I&#39;m sorry but it was an accident, I was excited by what you told me when we said goodbye that I wanted to be prepared but I got distracted at the time and instead of putting the dick in myself I ended up putting it in you. I tried to undo it later, but I ended up having one problem after another and this time not only Chronivac but my entire PC is out of order. To make matters worse, I ended up going through a new transformation that will complicate everything.&quot; Jeff texted<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you have my registration in the program? Did you intend to use this on me?&quot; Brianna texted<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought of this the first time when I tested the program, but I had no intention of using it. I swear I thought I lost it when Chronivac crashed earlier.&quot; Jeff texted<br />
<br />
Brianna sighed and replied by texting &quot; Okay, it was just an accident so I won&#39;t be mad at you. At least I&#39;ll be able to better understand what you went through.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for being so understanding, I swear I&#39;ll find a way to sort this out and get you back to normal as soon as possible.&quot; Jeff texted<br />
<br />
Brianna put her cell phone aside and, knowing that she would continue to have her dicks for some time, it would do no good to despair and she could even reveal this secret unintentionally, so she just turned on her side and slept leaving to look for a way to hide it the next day.</p>
