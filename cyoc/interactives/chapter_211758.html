<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I think I got it set up the way I wanted to. </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff quickly grew bored while waiting around for Ed, &quot;That big oaf, what&#39;s taking him so long? with how big he is he can stomp around the school in like 5 minutes&quot; thought Jeff while he fiddled with the chronivac.<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems this thing can make sweeping changes, but it’s a pain to set up exactly what you want&quot; thought Jeff as he checked the many and seemingly endless menus. &quot;Small changes are fine, but changing a whole person with just a short phrase is a recipe for disaster&quot; he said as he read -Ed Addams is a dumbass biker turned janitor, he always listens to Jeff-  <br />
<br />
&quot;Both he and me, had to change for that to be true&quot; thought Jeff. At least the chronivac seemed to consider my personal preference when making those changes. &quot;I can&#39;t say I&#39;m mad at them, just worried that things will get out of hand if I don&#39;t take proper precautions&quot; said Jeff while tapping away at the screen.<br />
<br />
Just then a raspy female voice could be heard on the other side of the door, &quot;Who is there? School is out, only cleaning personnel and teachers are allowed on the premises&quot;. &quot;UGH, its Mrs. Bell, the Principal&quot; thought Jeff, &quot;Charming as always&quot; said Jeff drily.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that!??&quot; said Mrs. Bell &quot;I don&#39;t know who is in there, but I am coming in and whomever it is, is in big trouble.&quot; As soon as the door handle started rattling Jeff made a snap decision, &quot;Just one more sweeping change before getting a hand on things, I can&#39;t stand that old woman, or any of the other female teachers&quot;.<br />
<br />
As Jeff started typing on the chronivac an old woman in his 60&#39;s wearing a beige dress opened the door and stepped inside, but just before she opened her mouth a weird ripple like effect seemed to pass through her distorting her figure, revealing a very different person after the effect subsidized.<br />
<br />
Jeff had gone into the school description in the chronivac and wrote &quot;Lincons High is an all Boy&#39;s Highscool who throughout its history has only ever hired the manliest male personnel possible, the current Principal is Mr. Cowbell a manly former local football player and coach, who dislikes women very much. The school motto is -Boys will be boys, and the school serves his boys-, Mr. Cowbell is one of Jeff many daddies&quot; As he finished typing Jeff felt a big ripple coming out from all around him. This time seemingly skipping on physical changes to him while the school itself seemed to shift and turn in his eyes.<br />
<br />
When everything stopped spinning Jeff opened his eyes to see a very handsome older man wearing a beige suit beaming at him &quot;Jeff so this is where you were! I&#39;ve been looking everywhere for you!&quot; Said the newly minted Mr. Cowbell while walking towards Jeff with his arms open wide, seemingly wanting to hug him.<br />
<br />
Jeff started at the &quot;new&quot; principal, Mr. Cowbell is a 6&#39; feet tall bear of a man on his early sixties wearing a proper looking beige suit that hugs his body nicely, he has short salt and pepper hair like Ed but more white than black, with a wide widow’s peak that frames his handsome mustached face. He has a big puffy walrus like mustache that doesn&#39;t quite suit him but wears it that way because Jeff likes it that way. He is wearing a sober looking belt and loafers that go very well with his suit. Mr. Cowbell has the air of a grandpa to him, the kind that demands respect but it’s not overbearing to be around, and was looking at Jeff with a twinkle in his eye, in a similar way as a doting father looks at his son.<br />
<br />
As Mr. Cowbell reaches Jeff and embraces him in a big hug &quot;My Boy, how I missed you, I know we saw each other this morning, but you know me, a full day without you is a too much for little ol&#39; me&quot;. -Little- wouldn&#39;t ever be the word Jeff used to describe Bull, as he now thought of Mr. Cowbell, -Bull- was Mr. Cowbell nickname when he was a rising star in his youth, only to come crashing down thanks to a jealous ex-girlfriend meddling, disliking women since then and ending up settling in his small town as the star coach, leading young men in his alma matter for decades to come.<br />
<br />
Jeff seemed to melt into Bull&#39;s arms as he hugged him, Bull was built like a brick house and kept his body in shape even in his old age, wearing his old gym clothes underneath his proper suit at Jeff&#39;s insistence, just so that Jeff could feel it whenever Bull hugged him, and Bull is quite the hugger. &quot;I like how the chronivac gives me a different type of daddy every time, first a tough one, next a slobby one, and now a grampa one&quot; thought Jeff while hugging Bull. &quot;I wonder...&quot; said Jeff while he decided to be naughty, grabbing a hold of Bull&#39;s meaty behind making him *Yelp* in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;J-J-Jeff!! You know we can’t do that at School! stammered Bull.  What if someone sees??&quot; exclaimed a squirming Bull &quot;You could get into so much trouble, and I would hate if anything bad happened to you, even more if it was my fault!&quot; he said with a stern voice, betrayed by the massive erection he was now sporting and the way his ass seemed to push into Jeff&#39;s hands. <br />
<br />
Jeff just laughed and said &quot;Bull, don&#39;t you worry, I have everything under control,” said Jeff while kneading Bulls butt. &quot;Besides it should just be me and my Daddies at the school, and those 2 idiots bring all the attention to themselves&quot; said Jeff while smirking at Bull as he squirms in his grasp.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know about that Jeff, you know how I worry about what you get up to with those 2, they aren&#39;t a good influence on you! they don&#39;t have one brain cell to share between them, at most they can teach you how to build up muscle and stink up the place&quot; said Bull while shaking his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh don&#39;t say that daddy, you know Ed has my back! he is so protective of me, always looking out for me and driving me around in that old bike of his&quot; says Jeff with a smile on his face, &quot;besides I like how stupid he is, it’s so fun to bully a guy over 4 times your age, he does everything I tell him to do you know?, he hasn&#39;t had a hair cut in ages just cause I told him I liked his wild style! I even have him pay me most of his salary, I just let him have some spending money and he mostly spends that on me too!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bull had a frown on his face as he listened to Jeff *sighs* &quot;you know I don&#39;t like you riding around in that dead machine you call a bike, much less with a brute like Ed... I know he has your back, or else I wouldn&#39;t let him hang around you, but I trust you much more than I trust and &quot;adult&quot; like him, said Bull sternly while I kneaded his butt and he let out involuntary *gasps* and*moans*.<br />
<br />
“Come on Bull, you know I have been a good influence on him! He hasn’t spent a night in jail since he found me, the guy would rather have me sit on his face than beating people up anymore, I just can’t push a guy like that away. Not that you could make me anyways ha-ha” said Jeff while smirking at Mr. Cowbell.<br />
<br />
Looking unamused Mr. Cowbell just sighed again, well at least he isn’t as bad as Cliff *shudders* I do not know what you see in that disgusting man.<br />
<br />
Jeff laughed again “Oh come on, he is not THAT bad, you got to admit having a living trashcan like him around is quite handy, I swear that man can eat anything and not get sick” said Jeff making a mental note to make that true with the chronivac. “Besides he is much cleaner than he used to be! I even taught him how to wash his hands and face properly, and he must do it several times a day now! I make him take a shower and wash his hair every day now too! Even if he gets dirty right away. Baby steps ha-ha.” Said a smiling Jeff.<br />
<br />
*Sighing* one last time Bull gently pushes Jeff away, “You are a smart young man Jeff, I am sure you know what you are doing, besides you have been a good influence on both of those men, and I would be a hypocrite to say I’m the best influence on you, since I’m quite positive I spoil you too much, I just can’t seem to say no to you” said Bull while looking longingly at Jeff’s hands, missing his touch already.<br />
<br />
“Say Daddy” Jeff says, and Bull instantly perks up “would you mind standing there for a few minutes? I need to do something on my phone real quick. Bull looks a bit disappointed but nods, seemingly content to just stand there watching as Jeff stands a little way away and taps on his smartphone.<br />
<br />
“This thing Is amazing” thought Jeff as he looked at the chronivac, he vaguely remembered the reality where the school wasn’t as it is now, with his tough exposed brick finish and wide-open spaces, filled to the brim with hunky teachers. The school now looked like a fancy boarding school in some far away European country rather than the dingy public school it was just a few minutes ago.<br />
<br />
As Jeff checked the chronivac He could see Bull waiting patiently, he had gotten a book from somewhere and was reading it while standing there “guess he can’t sit down since I told him to stand there huh…” thought Jeff “so even a casual word from me seems to be an iron command for my daddies” thought Jeff, as he fiddled with the chronivac some more.<br />
Jeff couldn’t help but stare at his newer daddy and wonder how he could mess with him. Jeff now had memories of growing up in the town and meeting Mr. Cowbell several times before he became his daddy. He always seemed especially fond of Jeff, but as soon as Jeff turned 18, Bull cornered him one day after school and begged him to let him be around, telling him how he always liked him and how he suddenly couldn’t stand the thought of not being a part of his life.<br />
<br />
As Jeff checked Mr. Cowbell in the chronivac he decided to make a few more changes to him, giving him a penchant for smoking pipes, a need to wear glasses for reading, some bigger feet, since a size 12 was simply too small for his tastes, and smelly size 16 where objectively better, and finally he decided to make Bull more top heavy, with a bigger and yet softer chest perfect for hugging. Finalizing the changes he pressed – Accept- and watched the show happen.<br />
<br />
Bull was waiting patiently for Jeff to finish playing with his phone, “Kids these days, can’t leave their phones alone even for a few minutes” he idly thought as he absentmindedly started scratching his expanding chest, seemingly not noticing as the top 3 buttons of his shirt *popped* out due to the sheer pressure, disappearing from sight revealing  the cleft between 2 massive mounds of muscle covered in a bush of white hairs, nor noticing anything odd as his meaty protruding nipples could be seen through his shirt as his jacket opened, never to be fully closed ever again. In a similar fashion both of his feet visibly expanded, and a manly familiar stench filled Bull’s nostrils, as he could smell his feet even though his shoes. He used to be so embarrassed by the smell, but since his boy liked it, he stopped trying to mask it, now relishing in how masculine it made him feel. As his arms got pushed away from his face, Bulls’ eyes started to get strained trying to read without his glasses, so he started patting himself up looking for them, finally finding them in one of his jacket pockets, right next to one of his missing trusty pipes – so that’s where the thing was- thought Bull, no wonder I couldn’t find It, it was in one of my gigantic jackets! He remarked to himself chuckling.<br />
<br />
“Bull looked fantastic now, a proper top heavy daddy with big (and smelly!) feet to balance him out, and the nicotine stained mustached gives him a far more serious look” Thought Jeff, and now for the finishing touches he typed “Bull truly enjoys the company of Jeff, so much so that he never gets mad at him and always ends up accommodating him, specially enjoying the feel of Jeff on his massive pecs” as he typed -Accept- once again he watched Bull closely as he stared blinking rapidly seemingly somewhat dazed, before staring at Jeff with a needy look in his eyes, clearly wanting to move towards him “Jeff, can I move again? I really need to hug you, I don’t know what has come over me, but I can’t stop thinking about the hug from a few minutes ago, seems I didn’t have enough! please Jeff” begged Bull<br />
<br />
Jeff just snickered and said, “Nah, too many hugs for now, why don’t you go do my homework and handle the rest of your days’ work for a few hours and then come find me at Ed’s and Cliff place? We are celebrating their 6-month anniversary today.<br />
<br />
Bull looked stricken, like a guy who just got stood up to prom, or like a kid who dropped his ice cream, “Jeff please don’t make me beg, I feel an ich only you can scratch, please my chest feels so heavy all of a sudden” said bull as he made puppy-eyes to Jeff. “It’s just one hug!... tell you what, I will make it worth your while, I won’t pester you again about your… other daddies, so please hug me before I get back to work” said Bill sullenly with a needy tear in his eyes.<br />
<br />
“Oh Bull”, said Jeff, “you know I can’t say no to you when you get like this, come here old man” he said while he opened his arms for a hug. Bull beamed at Jeff as he crossed the distance between them as fast as his stinky feet could carry him, picking Jeff off the ground and pressing him against his massive and soft pecs, hugging Jeff for all he was worth, *moaning* like a hoe in heat while doing so, seemingly unaware of the noises he was making. “So much for modesty” thought Jeff as he received the best hug of his young life, full of love, neediness, and eagerness to please.<br />
<br />
Bull pecs were incredibly soft to the touch, yet firm when pressed, they seemed perfect for a guy obsessed with hugging, and so very sensitive! Bull kept making little involuntary jumps and gasps whenever Jeff moved even slightly, almost trembling at Jeff’s touch. “His moaning is starting to sound like a cow mooing, seems fitting” thought Jeff happily while hugging his hunky grandpa daddy and resting his head between the cleft of his massive pecs, nuzzling them, and enjoying the warmness of Bull’s furry muscles.<br />
<br />
Bull was in heaven, he couldn’t remember a time he was happier than at this moment, not even when he won the state championship, or got his dream job at his alma matter, none of that compared to the feeling of having the love of his life safely in his arms, everything felt perfect… and that’s why the moment couldn’t last. As he stared down at his boy between the cleft of his pecs, the door to the classroom opened with a *SLAM* making Jeff *yelp* in fright, and him turn around to the loud noise, using his body to shield his boy instinctually, instantly shattering the moment.<br />
<br />
On the other side of the door stood a couple of bickering idiots too busy arguing with each other to notice whatever they interrupted in the classroom.<br />
“We kept boss waiting long enough lard-ass, you had to finish the whole trashcan? You didn’t even clean yourself properly, boss is gonna be pissed” hissed a frowning Ed to a smirking Cliff. “Heh you worry too much, I told ya already, Boss loves us, no way he will care if we take a few minutes to ourselves” answered Cliff. “Oh. Hey Boss, hey Bull” said Cliff talking a look inside for the first time, seeing both his boy and his -honest to fuck- boss inside, both looking mighty pissed for some reason.<br />
<br />
“I was actually enjoying myself quite a bit” thought jeff grumpily, “damn pair of idiots had to interrupt at the worst time”, but before he could even open his mouth a commanding voice right in front of him said.; “YOU TWO! Why are you PESTERING ME and NOT doing your JOBS!?” yelled Bull at the pair, making them stop in their tracks. “CAN’T YOU SEE WE ARE TALKING HERE!? GET LOST!!” finished Bull before turning to Jeff and saying in a much lower voice, “I’m so sorry my boy, the pair of brutes scared you, don’t you worry, I will get rid of them so that we can get right back to what we were doing”.<br />
<br />
Jeff got even more annoyed at the tone Bull was using, he wasn’t in control here, and he had no right to send the pair of idiots away, even more when Jeff had been the one to call them here in the first place! But once again before he could say anything a booming voice from the door said “WHAT THE F!#”% did you say to ME you OLD fart!?? ED yelled back, stomping loudly and menacingly towards Bull, “IF YOU THINK FOR ONE SECOND, I WON’T BEAT YOUR ASS JUST CAUSE BOSS IS HERE, THINK AGAIN!” he said while clenching his fists. For his part Cliff just seemed honestly surprised, and sensing he was somehow at fault, wisely for once, decided not to say anything. Regardless, feeling like things were about to get out of control, he tried to reach out to and grab Eds arm and stop him for hitting their actual boss, thinking that getting fired was a lousy way to celebrate their 6-month anniversary.<br />
<br />
For his part, Jeff had enough. “ALL OF YOU STOP!” He yelled sounding pissed, and as if by magic, all 3 of the manly men flinched, instantly frozen in their tracks, turning their head at once to look at their boy… their pissed looking boy.<br />
<br />
“DON’T TALK, in fact DON’T even THINK until I tell you too.” Said Jeff in a half-yell. “F%/”# these 3 can be a handful” thought Jeff, “At least they listened and stopped being dumb…”  thought Jeff, losing his train of thought as he watched Cliff start pissing himself.<br />
<br />
“…” thought Cliff as he felt a warm happy feeling from his lower body somewhere near his gut, he couldn’t think where exactly and it didn’t seem to matter, only feeling the need to relieve himself and with no reason to stop. <br />
<br />
For his part Ed looked mostly the same, doing what he usually does when waiting around, scratching his armpits and smelling his fingers “…” he thought while sniffing them, a trail of drool beginning to form near his open mouth.<br />
“…” Thought Bull as he absentmindedly searched for the pipe in his pocket and stuck it in his mouth, sucking on it like it was lit, getting drool all over it and his beard.<br />
<br />
Jeff was surprised for a moment before he burst into laughter “HA-HA-HA Holley Wacker moly you guys are a riot” he said while clutching his sides from laughter. All 3 men just stared dumbly at the important boy near them, not understanding why he was important, but knowing deep inside that he was the most important thing to each of them. “…” they all thought.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes of laughter, most of which Cliff continued pissing, Jeff got himself together enough to say, “Don’t piss or shit yourselves for the next 3 hours”, “I don’t know how long I will keep them like this, but it would be a pain if Bull pissed himself, at least he must look somewhat presentable for his job” thought Jeff. The men just stared at him not saying anything, only Bull opened his mouth as if to say something, managing to drop his pipe in the process while not making any sound. “Oh yeah” thought Jeff “I did tell you all to not talk huh… “he said while grabbing his chin, I wonder what you would even say while not able to think… let’s hear it he said while smirking. “Ed!” He said while pointing at the former biker, “come stand next to me and talk”.<br />
<br />
Ed continued sniffing his fingers as he lumbered over to Jeff, pushing Bull away with a shoulder check in a way that looked natural, the kind of move a trained body does after dozens or even hundreds of fights. “Oh Shit” thought Jeff as he saw Bill almost falling over, managing to right himself just as his massive foot stood on his pipe with a loud sounding “crack”, Bill looked unperturbed, only staring at his foot to see what that noise was about while thinking “…”.<br />
<br />
“Boss…” said Ed while staring at Jeff with a goofy smile “boy… important… fingers… nice… smell… boss…yes” he said while sniffing his fingers. “Continue talking” said Jeff as he grabbed the Bikers head and brought it to eye level “Boss… pretty… nice…nice…” he said while staring at Jeff with empty eyes. Jeff smirked, and in a swift motion kissed the Biker on his lips forcefully. Ed eyes rolled upwards in pleasure as he tried to keep on talking, only managing to *gurgle* while his boy had his way with his mouth “Grgl…GRlit…horneey” he finally managed as Jeff broke the kiss, a line of droll connecting them still.<br />
<br />
“I kinda like you like this” said Jeff, “you are mostly the same, but far more eloquent ha-ha” he said to the dazed looking biker as he still tried to talk while making kissing movements with his mouth “Bouss…kiuuus” tried to say Ed. “Shh stop talking” said Jeff while putting his index finger over his daddy’s lip. I want to keep playing with you guys, but we have lost too much time already, we have your party to get to after all! And you dummies need to finish working for us to go, said Jeff while Ed tried to suckle on his finger.<br />
<br />
“I know I could make the chronivac do everything… but where is the fun in that? Thought Jeff, “I want to see my daddies sweat and work for a living, as proper blue-collar men should” said Jeff out loud to no one in particular. The men jus staring at him and thinking “…”. And for that! You two, he said while pointing to Ed and Cliff in a moment I will snap my fingers, and when I do, both of you will turn into the perfect Daddy Janitors. The kind that does their job in a rapid and orderly manner, while being a great team that doesn’t get in the way of each other. Your true minds will be suppressed and will only wake up once you finish all the chores for the day and are ready to lock up. You only answer to me, your boy, as the sole authority figure, everyone else is just in the way and while they should be treated with respect befitting someone not a Janitor, for the most part they should ignored. You will only answer to the name “Janitor” while in this state, recognizing who I’m talking to by context.<br />
<br />
Ed and Cliff just started at him and thought “…” while he *snapped* his fingers. With a start both Janitors shook their head while looking around the room and saying in unison “Boy we are going to work” and moving in a synchronized manner walking towards the door and picking up the cleaning supplies they had both left outside the classroom, while listing all the chores that needed to be done to each other. “Janitors” said Jeff to his 2 daddies, both instantly stopping and turning their head in unison “Yes Boy?” they both say with an intensely focused look on their faces. “Start with this classroom, it reeks of piss” he said while pointing to the pool made by Cliff just a few minutes ago.<br />
<br />
Both Janitors walk back inside the classroom, and as if they were doing a choreographed dance, started systematically cleaning every single nook and cranny of the place. Starting with the pool of piss, Ed got his mop out and started rinsing out the floor while keeping track of his partner Janitor, who was busy removing gum from one of the chairs with an intense look of concentration on his face.<br />
<br />
“Perfect” thought Jeff, “this way they can finally get some work done, and I can decide who to invite to their anniversary” he said while getting the chronivac out of his pocket. “And now for some final changes to them and me” he thought. “If this works the way I think it will, it should be the last time I need this thing, for a while at least. If I’m not careful things will get both dangerous and even worse, boring”. He thought drily.<br />
<br />
-Cliff Huff can eat and digest anything and not get sick- Jeff typed into Cliffs description. -Cliff needs to eat at least 10.000 calories a day or he starts losing weight- “That should help with Cliffs weight problem” thought Jeff, “I want him at around 350-400 pounds, anything more and it’s just too unwieldly. And this way I can watch him sweat it all off, while still porking his face with food every day” he thought with a smile on his face. “Cliff Huff enjoys eating human waste, and has no problem being considered both a human trashcan and toilet” typed jeff, while adding “Cliff is a Slob and has slobby tendencies for all his actions and reactions, only his boy Jeff can tell him how to act as a proper adult”<br />
<br />
-Ed Addams cannot die from injuries – he will recover from any injuries either after an hour, or after drinking his favorite cheap beer – Ed Addams takes all injuries to be received by his boy Jeff or any of his daddies, regardless of distance – Ed Addams has a strong tolerance to pain and will not sustain permanent damage to his psyche regardless of the severity of his future injuries, while still feeling the pain from them. Typed Jeff, ensuring he had some security going forward, “and who better to take the pain than his tough daddy biker? I’m sure he won’t mind, even if he doesn’t realize it’s happening” thought Jeff with a wicked look on his face while typing -No one will think this ability of his is odd, or noteworthy at all, not even himself, forgetting about it most of the time- except for Jeff.<br />
<br />
-Bill Cowbell - Aka Bull – is a responsible and proper daddy, whose musk puts people – except Jeff and his daddies – at ease, making them more inclined to agree with him. Bull is not aware and will never be aware of this ability-. Typed Jeff. -Bull has a compulsion to try and hug Jeff or people he likes whenever they are near him, but never Jeff without his permission. “This one is cute, if he likes hugs so much, let’s make it his thing, but only when I allow it” Thought Jeff. – Bull is a workaholic, enjoying his work and the money he provides for his boy, always working on a project to bring more money home for his boy – typed Jeff. Bull traits, like his sharp intellect and a willful attitude, can be freely drained by Jeff for his use regardless of distance, leaving Bull in a diminished state which he is mostly unaware off and will attribute to simple tiredness” finished typing Jeff while looking at the drooling Mr. Cowbell as he stared at the broken pieces of his pipe on the floor.<br />
<br />
And finally, with a crack of his knuckles, he started on his changes.<br />
<br />
All of Jeff daddies are now in perfect health, unless Jeff explicitly doesn’t want it that way – example Bull needing glasses to read- or Ed Getting injured - he typed in his description.<br />
<br />
Jeff has the ability to turn anyone he comes in contact with – this being by sight or touch – into a Daddy of his choice - this will happen by clearly thinking or speaking the way the target is supposed to change, and this cannot result into something that will kill the target – all targets of Jeff&#39;s ability will instantly be  attracted to him, willing to put him over their interests, the grade of which will depend on the amount of changes received - more changes means more attraction.<br />
<br />
No one else but Jeff can touch or even be aware of the chronivac, if someone does become aware, they will turn into a useful daddy for Jeff and attempt to contact him as soon as possible, while ensuring no one else comes into contact or becomes aware of the chronivac. This daddy will have big odorous feet and a lot of facial hair, plus a penchant for a random embarrassing behavior.<br />
<br />
Once Jeff was happy with the changes, he pressed -accept- and watched the magic happen.</p>
