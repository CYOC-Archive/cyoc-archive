<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Flying had certainly shortened the time it took to travel from the capital back to her home village. However Sara was still confined to following the roads from above and occasionally landing to read a road sign to remind herself of which path to take at each crossroads. Eventually Sara saw her hometown of Granton in the distance and a smile crossed her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Finally, I was beginning to think I&#39;d never get there,&quot; Sara lightly landed beyond the village outskirts and continued on foot, not wanting to scare the residents.<br />
<br />
As she passed by the first house, the resident sitting by the window seemed to lean forward to get a better look before he suddenly yelled out, &quot;well look who&#39;s back and all grown up, little Sara Zagan. How are ya?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, I&#39;m well. Glad to be back in Granton,&quot; Sara waved slowly, having difficulty understanding the man&#39;s reaction to her being so casual.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it&#39;s good to see you again ms. Zagan.&quot;<br />
<br />
This continued as she passed by people in the streets. All the adults smiled and waved and offered greetings, while some of the children shirked away and were told to not be rude. Each encounter only served to make Sara more uneasy, this was definitely not the reaction she was anticipating.  Near the center of Granton Granton Sara stopped one of the passersby and asked him why everyone was acting so casually towards her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s my place to say really,&quot; the woman answered. &quot;It should be your parents that should explain everything. They&#39;re down the way,&quot; she pointed to the familiar road Sara had walked many times as a child, where her family&#39;s home and shop sat. Sara continued at a brisk pace to her old home eager for answers and nearly tore the door from its hinges in her haste when she opened it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Careful with that Sara,&quot; smiled the large man behind the counter. Easily over 6 feet tall and broad shouldered it was easy to see the family resemblance to Stanley. &quot;Its not as sturdy as it used to be.&quot; His hazel eyes had a loving twinkle that brought back memories of her childhood. &quot;Frieda, our little girl is back,&quot; he looked back at Sara, &quot;though not so little anymore.&quot; He moved out from behind the counter and held his arms open for Sara. Without hesitation Sara ran forward and hugged her father. &quot;Oof, careful girl. Don&#39;t break your old man.&quot; <br />
<br />
Somewhere behind her another familiar voice called out as a door creaked open. &quot;What was that Jacob? I was in the cellar when I- oh dear me.&quot; Sara pulled away from her father&#39;s embrace and turned to see her mother standing in the doorway that separated the shoo from their house, tears welling up in her eyes. &quot;Oh, look at how much you&#39;ve grown,&quot; she said and ran to her daughter kissing her on the cheeks. The three of them stood in the storefront in a silent embrace, enjoying the reunion. Their tender moment was broken by the front door opening.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oops, I&#39;ll be back later,&quot; the woman said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m closing up early, come back tomorrow,&quot; Jacob called to the customer. After the door closed he turned to his family. &quot;Let&#39;s go to the other room and catch up on things. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve had plenty of stories to tell. You 2 go on and I&#39;ll close up shop and be in there soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Sara, I want to hear about all you&#39;ve been through. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve found someone special by now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You could say that,&quot; Sara smiled as they left the storefront.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
&quot;...so then Jack comes running out of the room screaming with a fish in one hand and the papers in the other,&quot; Sara laughed, trying to catch her breath. They had gathered at the dining table for a more relaxing conversation, emptied plates stacked to one side as Sara told of some of her adventures.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hahaha, and how did Vect get out,&quot; Jacob asked wiping a tear from his eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;He jumped out the window and feet first into a manure cart.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And then what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;By the time the baroness had worked free of the ropes the guards were already there to arrest everyone and the Haze drugs were seized. And that&#39;s why Jack can&#39;t look at a fish and not break into a big smile.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you&#39;ve definitely got some interesting stories to tell Sara. More than what Stanley will talk about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you seen him recently?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes, he&#39;s here in town,&quot; Frieda answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where,&quot; Sara was surprised he came back to Granton at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think he&#39;s at the tavern pouting like a child.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He didn&#39;t like our response when he told us about how you changed.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Actually I&#39;ve been wondering why everybody has been so nonchalant about my current appearance as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that&#39;s an easy answer. We knew what you were,&quot; Frieda explained casually.<br />
<br />
&quot;You...knew. And no one thought it important to warn me about my very sudden and drastic changes,&quot; Sara was wrestling between if she should feel angry this was kept from her or bewildered that they were acting so casual about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, technically the whole village knew save the children until a certain age where they could be trusted to keep quiet,&quot; Jacob added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why we knew or why we didn&#39;t tell you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose the answer to both questions is the same; your parents. Your birth parents I mean,&quot; Jacob clarified as he leaned back in his chair.<br />
<br />
&quot;When you were brought to our village, your parents made us all swear to keep your origin a secret from everyone even you,&quot; Frieda continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;But why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They didn&#39;t give much of an explanation when we asked. Only that it was important for you to never be discovered. After they left in a hurry some people rode through and asked which direction they were heading.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you gave them up?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your parents told us to! Any deception would have been sensed, so we were to tell them the direction they left. All to keep you safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel like I&#39;m repeating myself over and over again,&quot; Sara sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know and I wish we could have answers for you, but we don&#39;t. This however,&quot; Jacob set a small lockbox on the dining table, &quot;might help give some answers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sara examined the container before her. Deep blue with gold trimmings along the edges and a red gemstone set in the center of the lid. The gemstone was circular with a black stripe centered inside, giving it the imitation of an eye.</p>
