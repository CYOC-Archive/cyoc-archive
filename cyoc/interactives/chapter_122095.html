<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Jeff looked at his crotch he had a strange thought. What if he transplanted more of the toy to himself. Walking over to his bed he spread the deflated toy out to look at it. It was a fox pool toy with handles on the back, and currently it had his former dick in place of a nozzle. Looking at the toy Jeff decided to try it.<br />
<br />
He set the chronovac to take several minutes to shift his legs, arms, shoulder blades, ears, and his tailbone with the toy&#39;s own, and no one would care about it, they would see it as normal. Or rather they would follow the reality Jeff was setting. One where he was a pool toy to people and the actual toy didn&#39;t seemed to exist so no one would freak out about it. Setting the chronovac to start Jeff quickly pulled off his clothes and made a run out of his room to get outside to the pool.<br />
<br />
Quickly had made it outside to the family pool, Jeff panting in relief as he walked outside completely naked. If he hadn&#39;t gotten out here he would have been stuck inside. Deciding to lay on the deck by the pool he sat down to feel his changes as inside the toy started to transplant with him.<br />
<br />
Jeff watched as his foot started to shrink, gaining a rubbery sheen as his toes melted together into a fake paw with three painted on toes. There was currently no air in his feet and they deflated to be flat before turning black. Jeff was giddy as rubbery seems formed on his legs, which were turning orange before deflating, going completely flat. The limbs were almost comically small for his body, but that changed as well as his torso shrunk to better fit the limbs somewhat, so he would be a better toy despite only being half pool toy. His legs were now attached to his hips like the pool toy&#39;s had been, in a quadrupedal stance.<br />
<br />
Jeff was smiling as he grabbed his flat legs, he could feel his hands on them as he flopped them about before spreading them out with his hands to reveal his crotch. He couldn&#39;t move them, but that was alright. The next change was starting as Jeff felt irritation in his spine. A rubber tail growing out from behind him, completely deflated with a white tip and rubber seems. It felt awesome as Jeff decided to move the tail so it was flat between his legs as he flipped himself over so he was on his stomach, his legs still flat as well as his tail as the next change began.<br />
<br />
Jeff shivered as his shoulder blades seemed to pop out of his back. But they were turning into the rubber handles on the original toy that would inflated when he was, within a minute he had a pair of deflated handles where his shoulder blades had been, laying against his human back.<br />
<br />
Jeff knew this next change was going to be the most important as he spread his arms, giggled to himself as his arms shrunk and fingers melted together to match his deflated rubber legs, within a minute he had a second pair of deflated rubber legs ready to be inflated. Jeff&#39;s hearing then went muffled as his ears migrated up his head, turning into the toy&#39;s fox ears that sat deflated on top of his head. Jeff&#39;s changes seemingly complete.<br />
<br />
But Jeff&#39;s choice to alter reality had a side effect. Jeff had to shiver for a moment before squeaking, eyes going wide as he realized he just squeaked. Turning his head he could barely see, but he could feel as his torso started to shrink, his internal organs being replaced with a air sac for his limbs and body as his torso deflated, turning into orange rubber that matched his body as Jeff realized what he had done on accident. He&#39;d shifted everything but his head with the pool toy and shifted reality for a solid month for him to be like this. But Jeff was okay with that. He was going to be a pool toy and enjoy it.</p>
