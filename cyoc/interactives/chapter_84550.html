<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Not everyone in Janace came see Sammy and Gloria&#39;s eggs hatch, as the town had grown so much that not everyone could fit in their house to see them hatch. However, close friends and family did come, as well as Janace&#39;s two doctors. Ronnie and and Mina had no appointments and closed up the clinic for everything but emergencies so they could go and see the new hatchlings and figure out what sort of care they would need. As they made their way out, they also came across the group leaving the new Chakat Industries building.  One of them caught Mina&#39;s eye especially. Other than the long furry tail tipped with a scorpion&#39;s stinger, shi resembled many of the artistic depictions of various saber toothed cats, with tan-gold fur that covered with dark black stripe/spots that wrapped around hir body.<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks that Maurice figured out the formula to return Charlie to being a Chakat again,&quot; Ronnie commented as they got closer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Complete with a pair of very sexy looking sabers,&quot; Mina joked, looking toward Charlie&#39;s teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; Ronnie protested.<br />
<br />
Mina gave hir mate a rather impish smile, &quot;Hey, you know I love you, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d hope so,&quot; Ronnie faked a huff of protest.<br />
<br />
Mina only giggled and then decided to give hir greeting to the new Charlie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there!&quot; Mina announced as shi bounded over ultimately bounced hir side against Charlie&#39;s, &quot;Who are you there, new Smilodon?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mina, you know who I am,&quot; Charlie answered as shi staggered sideways a little, &quot;and I&#39;m sure your sither and sither-in-law had mentioned that they were working on the a formula to make me a Chakat again...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A manticore based Chakat,&quot; Ronnie nodded as shi caught up, &quot;how does all the vaccine stuff stand up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It appears that all things are looking good... the transformation didn&#39;t affect the new vaccine... though it will also mean everyone will need to get the new Wise... or maybe Charlie Vaccine...&quot; Charlie shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;A little more modesty please, Charlie,&quot; Sally gave a rather playful swat at hir with one hand.<br />
<br />
Charlie only shrugged, &quot;But... yeah... this feels good to be on four legs again...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t seem to do too bad on eight,&quot; Ronnie commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... but I&#39;ve got some repair work to do,&quot; Charlie sighed, &quot;Insects and Arachnids are normally so small that they can grip minute bumps and cracks in surfaces that we can&#39;t see without a microscope... at the size I was at as a Scorpkat... I actually did damage to the wall... and regardless, I feel more like me again...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only with a great set of teeth,&quot; Mina quipped as the Smilodon based Chakat flicked one of Charlie&#39;s enlarged upper canine teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sally said they&#39;d be more pleasure for hir,&quot; Charlie commented and then looked to Ronnie, &quot;Do you know what shi means?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well aside from providing good back scratches while cuddling, that&#39;ll be for you to find out,&quot; Ronnie smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Spoil sport,&quot; Charlie grumbled.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The group gathered together in Sammy and Gloria&#39;s home. The home had been built for them and was fairly close to Mikkie and Danna&#39;s home. It included a room that would become their soughter&#39;s bedroom that for six years had been kept warm as an artificial incubator, letting Sammy and Gloria spend time away from their eggs. And now all four eggs were rocking as the Dracokats inside them were getting ready to break out of their shells. Sammy and Gloria sat by each other, holding each other&#39;s hands and tears of joy going down their cheeks. Closest to them were Mikkie and Danna with their soughters, Tris and Sirt. Next to them were Alexis and Flake with their soughters, Tres and Sert. Elise moved to stand by hir college friend. Next was Nikole, Jess, and Snowy. Maurice was still working with the samples to put together more of the new vaccine. In front of them were Janice and Snowflake. With it presently being summer, the other kids appeared to be out playing tag. Sally and Charlie set Fluffy, Mary, and Reca in front of them and sat down on their haunches. Ronnie and Mina sat to their right  and closest to Sammy and Gloria on the other side. There was some recognition at Charlie&#39;s restored Chakat form, albeit a bit different from hir previous one, but no one said anything and tried to keep their eyes on the rocking eggs. <br />
<br />
Jess, however, did notice that hir sither had been looking better and now even more so. Shi felt glad for that, as shi had nor real idea what shi would do if shi had been in Sally&#39;s paws. Shi remembered being raped in Fee City, but that was vastly different from what had happened to Sally. The Chakats in Fee City were all lust filled, and strangely before they moved to Janace, most, if not all of them, actually came and apologized in person to Jess. Jess could never blame them, and the fact that shi had proved immune to that strain of the virus helped ease the wounds that Jess endured there. Sally&#39;s chief wounds though, occurred in Cairo. Sally loved Reca firmly, and they remembered a family vacation to Florida with Torrent and Aqua when Sally very nearly assaulted some teenager who decided to poke fun at Reca for some ridiculous reason, but that did not change the circumstances of Reca&#39;s conception. The Jackats that raped Sally in Cairo HAD their minds back. They had burned through the lust phase of the virus and consciously raped Sally, which was something totally different from the Kats who had no control in Fee City because of the virus&#39;s lust phase. The incident in the Vatican had only reminded hir of Cairo, and Jess hoped Sally would get the time and opportunities to recover. Things soon brought Jess&#39;s attention to the rocking eggs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy,&quot; Tris, who looked very much like the black cat in Loony Toons that got her back painted white and attracting  Pepe LePew to her, &quot;Why are Aunt Sammy and Aunt Gloria crying?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Their eggs are finally hatching, sweetie,&quot; Mikkie said to the soughter shi gave birth to, &quot;They will finally get to hold their soughters in their arms and love them, just as your father and I held you and Sirt when you were infants.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;d actually hoped that they would hatch when we gave birth so that you and your sither would grow up with your cousins,&quot; Danna gave a smile to soughter shi sired.<br />
<br />
&quot;So they&#39;re happy tears?&quot; Sirt asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; it was actually Sammy who answered, &quot;Very happy tears...&quot; Sammy then hugged Gloria to hir, &quot;We&#39;ll finally be mothers...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were mothers the moment you laid your eggs,&quot; Nikole told them.<br />
<br />
&quot;But we couldn&#39;t hold them and cuddle them and see them play the way you all did,&quot; Gloria answered hir, &quot;Lucky mammals. Now, we&#39;ll finally get that chance.&quot;<br />
<br />
They all watched with great interest as all four eggs rocked. They rocked hard and soon little chirps could be heard through the shells. Then one of Sammy&#39;s and one of Gloria&#39;s eggs began to rock even harder.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re hatching! They&#39;re hatching!&quot; Sammy said and in hir excitement actually shaking Gloria. Gloria was too excited to complain.<br />
<br />
Then came a cracking noise coming from the two vigorously rocking eggs. The baby Dracokats were ready to truly enter the world. The cracking noises were accompanied by visible cracks appearing in the eggs as they rocked like great spider webs. As time passed, the cracks grew larger and larger until a three toed foot pushed trough the top of Gloria&#39;s egg and a feathered head emerged through the shell of Sammy&#39;s egg.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hir feathers don&#39;t look like Aunt Sammy and Aunt Gloria&#39;s feathers!&quot; Sirt pointed to them, &quot;They look... wet.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two infant Dracokats continued to break out of their shells with Gloria&#39;s looking like shi was doing a handstand on hir arms and forelegs and then did a complete somersault and landed on hir back. Sammy&#39;s broke out of hir shell and wobbly stood on hir legs before dropping softly onto hir belly. The two did look rather wet, but that was the result of breaking out of their eggs, though Snowy also noticed that there was a certain pattern to the new hatching&#39;s feathers. Sammy and Gloria&#39;s feathers resembled the flight and body feathers of adult birds in many ways. It was only on the underside of their jaws, necks, bellies, arms, all four legs, and tail where they transferred from feathers to more reptilian scales. The hatchlings had the same sort of transition from feathers to scales, but unlike their parents, for the moment their feathers looked more like the feathers of baby ducks or chickens in that when the feathers were dry and clean they would look rather fuzzy and would be molted out when they matured.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re just hatching,&quot; Mikkie laughed, &quot;You and your sither were rather wet you came out of me and Danna.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we hold them?&quot; Tris asked as the other two eggs began to rock with the same vigor as the first two had.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you&#39;d best let the new mothers hold them first,&quot; Danna commented as Sammy and Gloria lay down onto their own taur bellies and began to carefully lift and right their newly hatched offspring.<br />
<br />
The two hatchlings chirped and actually sounded like baby Alligators or Crocodiles as they were held by their mothers. Both Sammy and Gloria smiled heavily as they held them, overjoyed to finally hold their children in their arms. And shortly after, the other two eggs hatched and they collected all their hatchlings.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re mothers, Sammy,&quot; Gloria said softly, tears of joy going down hir cheeks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Sammy nodded as shi felt her soughters push begin to suckle from hir breasts, &quot;Yes we are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you plan to name them?&quot; Mikkie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think this one will be Emerald,&quot; Sammy gently rocked the hatchling in hir right arm, which had bright emerald green coloring, and then did the same with the hatchling in hir left arm, which had the coloring of the gemstone opal, &quot;and this one will be Opal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gloria did the same with regard to holding up the hatchling in hir right arm and then hir left.<br />
<br />
&quot;This will be An-Bai and this will be Dao-Ming,&quot; Gloria spoke, sticking to hir original Chinese ancestry, even if shi was likely never to set foot in hir birth country as anything other than a tourist.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Everyone gave Sammy and Gloria their congratulations and politely excused themselves to let the &quot;new&quot; mothers be with their newly hatched infants. Some also said brief hellos to Charlie and told hir shi looked good. Charlie thanked them, but they moved to head home and make sure the rest of their children were okay. As they reached their home, they found Brent waiting quietly on their front porch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Brent,&quot; Charlie said politely, &quot;What brings you here...? I thought you&#39;d been looking for a place to stay permanently.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For the moment I&#39;ve been okay with being with mom and Jess,&quot; Brent answered, &quot;that&#39;s not why I&#39;m here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it would be nice to have you visit,&quot; Charlie spoke, &quot;We are family after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brent nodded, &quot;And you do look good Charlie... a bit bustier than I thought but hey...&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlie looked down. Shi didn&#39;t think hir breasts were any bigger than they were before, shi just had an extra pair, which were covered by hir shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re also looking better, Sally,&quot; Brent said to the black panther Chakat.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do feel a bit better,&quot; Sally commented, &quot;Letting time heal wounds and all that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I still remind you a bit of what happened in the Vatican, since Charlie vaccinated me and made it impossible for me to become anything other than what I am physically?&quot; Brent asked pointedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;A little bit,&quot; Sally admitted nervously, &quot;but I am getting better...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; Brent said slowly, &quot;but the three of us need to talk as I think I might be able to help...&quot;</p>
