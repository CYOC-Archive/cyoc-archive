<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Of course! What could possibly stand out more and test the limits of biology and reality than that? If he made himself clearly pregnant, then that was bound to either cause great confusion or it was treated like normal just as the program was set to do. Plus it was going to be quite the experience.<br />
Thus Sean pulled up his model on the screen and began to experiment a little to figure out how to accomplish this little idea of his. At least until he finally saw he could indeed use the options for female bodies on his own as well. <br />
And when he found the pregnancy option, he hovered above it for a moment before smirking and right away maxing it up to nine months. Besides, it had to be obvious.. Otherwise it could just be treated as a pot belly. Plus he would change it back soon anyways, so why not go test the limits.. And so he did set it to be quintuplets as well. &quot;Only question is if I really can undo it...&quot;, he began before checking the settings just before he&#39;d activate the change. <br />
That did allow him to see an option labeled &#39;Phantom Pregnancy&#39;. It would make him appear pregnant with all the symptoms involved - even kicking - but it was clearly an option to probably either test out what a pregnancy felt like... or to be permanently pregnant without actually ever giving birth to anything. <br />
&quot;Might as well go with that.&quot;, he shrugged and thus selected the options and set the time for the changes to take place to ninety minutes. One month every ten minutes. Would at least allow for the changes to be more interesting. But what he did not want was to feel sick. So he did make sure to not have that included before finally pressed the checkmark and set the changes in motion. Now he just had to wait.<br />
At first he didn&#39;t feel much different. Hell, one could say nothing was happening at all. Perhaps that really was however due to the lack of feeling sick. <br />
Thus Sean got up and moved to hide his laptop just in case while getting his phone out instead to check if his roommates sent any messages about coming back soon. Jay did text that he&#39;d be there in thirty minutes, however, Dan would said he&#39;d be back shortly. <br />
Though, after only five minutes, Sean could definitely start to feel the changes. His stomach clearly seemed no longer as toned as before. It felt a little bloated. But it wasn&#39;t too obvious of a change yet. But it would be soon enough, especially with the quintuplets setting. And sure enough, he could tell his stomach was slowly but surely starting to look more and more bloated. He could even say it felt heavier. <br />
But he wanted to pretend for things to be as normal as possible. Just to see how it would go. And thus he moved to put on his baggiest shirt and pants just for the hell of it and went to livingroom to watch some tv. <br />
It was after he hit fifteen minutes - him already thinking he looked way bigger than before - that he could hear the door finally open and his roommate Dan come in. <br />
&quot;Hey, Sean, give me a hand with some of the groceries I got?&quot;, he called out. Not even having looked his way yet. <br />
By now Sean did feel a lot more bloated now that he was reaching closer to the twenty minute mark - the two months - and had some more trouble getting up. The baggy shirt still covered his body pretty well, but even he would say the larger stomach should be noticeable by now. Yet Dan seemed far more focused on picking up the heaviest things to carry inside, leaving Sean with the mostly lighter stuff. Which did stand out. Normally Dan wasted no time to push the heavier things in his arms and have Sean carry them. Was that a chabge caused by the shift in reality or was Dan just for once not being lazy about carrying his own stuff? <br />
Either way, Sean simply quietly moved to grab the remaining groceries and carried them to their kitchen area along with Dan. But he needed to test whether Dan&#39;s behavior changed more than just that.<br />
&quot;So... You got any plans for later?&quot;, he thus tried to ask Dan then who was still busy putting everything away. For a moment, Dan was thinking about it before snorting: &quot;If this is your way of asking if I am finally going on a date with Ashley, then you got it right. Gonna take her to the movies! And hopefully get to hang out further at her place - no way do I want you or Jay hearing anything!&quot; <br />
&quot;Right...&quot;, he nodded slightly. Still nothing? By now he really felt like he needed to lean against something. Maybe quintuplets was too much..? He was sure he probably looked like someone nearing a third trimester rather than the third month of a pregnancy. It had to be obvious. Yet Dan said nothing about it. Was that really all? No reactions was the shift in reality. <br />
He moved to sit down. He felt heavy and full. But thankfully that finally caused Dan to say: &quot;That exhausted already? Really, I am glad I don&#39;t have to deal with that. Seriously, you really didn&#39;t get lucky with that condition.&quot;<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;, that did catch Sean&#39;s attention.<br />
&quot;I mean, it&#39;s called a condition... Right? You&#39;re literally the only guy out there that can do this. Get pregnant I mean?&quot;<br />
&quot;So... You are not bothered by it? At all?&quot;, Sean asked.<br />
For a moment Dan seemed confused before shrugging: &quot;Why should I? Not like I&#39;m the one that knocked you up.&quot;<br />
Though, before Sean could retort anything else, the door finally opened again and in came Jay. He clearly came back from the gym. Yeah, compared to him, Sean probably really oughta stand out. He was already getting close to the fourth month abd was just stuck trying to somewhat sit comfortably and lightly pull at his formerly baggy shirt so it would keep covering his stomach instead of rolling up the whole time. <br />
But as he noticed Jay staring at him, he simply asked: &quot;What? Is there something you want to say?&quot;<br />
&quot;Seriously, at least try to buy something that fits? I don&#39;t go around constantly showing off to you either.&quot;, Jay grunted and simply walked past him. He at least also seemed affected by the change in reality. <br />
Everyone believed he was pregnant. But there was only one issue... It hasn&#39;t even been fifty minutes yet and he already felt like if he moved and sat up in the wrong way, the weight of his stomach was going to really make it uncomfortable for his dick since it would definitely press down on it. And it already felt huge. So how was it going to be if he finally reached the ninety minutes?</p>
