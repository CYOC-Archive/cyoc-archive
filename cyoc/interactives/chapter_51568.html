<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;It's so bright ...&quot; Armisael said stepping out of the art gallery shading her eyes. She <br />
looked around, &quot;Where are all the horses?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sister.&quot; Mal'akh said curious, &quot;How long were -you- part of the gallery?&quot;<br />
<br />
Armisael looked unsure, &quot;I'm not sure... it was so long ago... truth to be told, like I think <br />
all of us who were art for so long we came to EMBRACE our fate, it was better than going <br />
mad or being miserable after all...I remember the curator when he was a little boy, and his <br />
father, and his grandfather, and his great-grandfather, and... they all blur together after <br />
that... I think the newest president after we succeeded from England and Fat George was a <br />
Mr. James Monroe.&quot;<br />
<br />
The lionesses all looked at each other. They'd have a lot to teach their pride sister. <br />
<br />
&quot;A remember a another cop using the curse on me... he said I didn't deserve being on the <br />
same force as him because I was a Jew.&quot; <br />
<br />
And something very horrid and very good they'd have to break to her. What, with the <br />
whole mass murder of her people by the Nazis and later the return of the holy land to the <br />
Jewish people... <br />
<br />
&quot;This curse has been on Glendale for three hundred and ten years...&quot; Fox realized. &quot;Of <br />
course not everyone in the gallery is going to be from our lifetime...&quot; <br />
<br />
The midnight lioness Elise said folding her arms thinking pragmatically, &quot;So there's <br />
nineteen of us now, seventeen if you count that Mary can't be risked and Penny is in no <br />
shape to fight... and there's now... the curator said twelve other statues were missing, add <br />
from fifty two we get sixty four of them not counting the statue and who knows what <br />
else? And if we don't hit them soon and fast we'll lose everyone they've altered forever. <br />
And the only way we could ever beat them with numbers is by dragging our families into <br />
this or by becoming no better than Jensen. Great. Just great.&quot; The midnight lioness did not <br />
sound happy at all.  &quot;And the SICK PART is that they could have been our sisters and <br />
pridemates and helped END this insanity rather than extend it. Beautiful isn't it?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You know... thinking about it.&quot; Bernie said, &quot;We don't really need to fight all the wolves...&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone looked at her. The slightly more rounded of the lionesses' continued stroking her <br />
muzzle, <br />
<br />
&quot;If they really are acting the way they're acting because the curse has removed the ability <br />
for them to see anyone who isn't a wolf as a person... Then if we can get to Jensen, undo <br />
HIS brainwashing... and the rest will more or less get in line when he tells them to line up <br />
for de-sociopatherization.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That,&quot; Elise raised a finger, &quot;Is assuming Jensen will DISLIKE having turn people into <br />
brainwashed fanatics who are blindly loyal to him.&quot; <br />
<br />
Everyone nodded at each other. <br />
<br />
Bernie said, &quot;It's still our best option, find the black midnight furred big bad wolf, snap <br />
him back to reality with the game, and the rest should fall into place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Won't their defenses be mostly around Jensen though? It might be more trouble than we'd <br />
be getting curing the rest first.&quot; Gary said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Felicity said simply. It amazed her how no one gave her mind, nor any of her pride <br />
mates mind. It was like it was completely natural for them to be what they were. &quot;What <br />
their defenses will be most around, will be the pups.&quot;  <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Master.&quot; Megan asked jumping out of a window and landing right in front of her Master <br />
having listened in, then saw Yomato, &quot;Hello, who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
The red and white flag wolf replied, &quot;I am Yomato, Master-Sama's loyal samurai.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen inserted calmly, &quot;He and all the other new wolves will be introduced to the pack <br />
after our relocation to the island is complete. Is there something you wished Megan?&quot; <br />
Jensen asked calmly, Kaylee having failed to mention Megan's hair-brained scheme.<br />
<br />
&quot;Master, it has occurred to me, it might not mean much, but if the familiar who invaded <br />
our home was Trevor, isn't the best way to see if he really did survive and gave away our <br />
home's location is to use your power to find out where he is?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen started, he hadn't considered that. But all the same it made sense. &quot;Very well.&quot; <br />
Jensen thought for a moment, then replied, &quot;He's at the police station. I doubt I'd be able <br />
to tell where he is if he was dead, so that settles that I suppose.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm glade I was able to help Master.&quot; With that, with no concern for the outer appearance <br />
of the manor, and with no objection or protest from anyone (the cleaning staff now neither <br />
feeling encouraged nor given encouragement to do their old tasks) Megan climbed up the <br />
front of the house and back into the window she came out of leaving claw marks on the <br />
front of the manor. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well?&quot; Margot asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Police station, mangy cat is at the police station, the same place as Ashley.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I really think I should go help my sisters...&quot; Abbey suggested meekly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry Abbey,&quot; Megan said kindly rubbing the living glass' head. &quot;We're just going to <br />
punish that mean old cat who took my brother's eye, and rescue Ashley so she can be with <br />
us on the island before they can move her to some place we can't rescue her from... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;From the middle of a police station with lions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll be in and out in three minutes. The lions had the element of surprise on my brother <br />
and the rest... this time, we're the one with the surprise.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Mary didn't know why she was in here, because maybe she wanted to see one up close? <br />
Maybe she was curious as a cat will be? She didn't know. Trevor in her arms, she sat <br />
across from Ashley looking at the blue and dark blue she wolf. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you hate me?&quot; Mary was surprised when Ashley spoke first. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hate you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I broke into your home, wanted to mutate and brainwash you, and was willing to murder <br />
you to accomplish my objective. That deserves hating.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary thought, Trevor staying quite. &quot;No... I don't... you weren't really you were you? It was <br />
all the curse wasn't it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whose to say this isn't all the curse now? You, me, him. Whose to say anything we say or <br />
do isn't just the curse itself talking? Whose to say we even remotely have any self left at all <br />
that isn't just the curse's own will.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... I know I'm acting different... Paul says the curse is what made me want to stay this way, <br />
and for my parents to be this way forever more but... if I'm happy, and you're happy, is it <br />
really evil?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Happiness can be a veil.&quot; Ashley said not sure why she was trying to explain this to an <br />
eight year old. <br />
<br />
&quot;... Maybe but... if... we, the pride, mom, dad, and all of my new family can do some good <br />
for Glendale... then, maybe that's the best way to spite the curse? If it feeds off misery and <br />
we make people happy, then we're doing the exact opposite of what the curse wants right?<br />
&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley looked up, &quot;I... didn't think of it that way. ... Thank you... but... is the love I feel for <br />
Jensen real? Is the love I feel for any of my pack mates real?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley started and so did Mary when Trevor spoke next, sharing Mary's grasp with Lance, <br />
&quot;If it isn't, then take it and make it real. Decide what it is that love for them is. And what <br />
separates it from robot devotion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;HEY! WHAT IN THE-&quot; They heard a voice of a man sounding surprised and armed, and <br />
what could have been a bathroom door being swung open... and half the bones in a man's <br />
body breaking as he hit a way hall.<br />
<br />
Trevor, Mary, and Ashley all stood up. <br />
<br />
&quot;STAY THERE ABBEY!&quot;<br />
<br />
They heard a gruff woman's voice shout. <br />
<br />
Then the armored green door that separated the cell block from the rest of the police <br />
station was hit by an indentation, then another, and another, then finally, it fell foreword <br />
with a Earth shaking thud. <br />
<br />
A red-violet and pastel green pair of baled she wolves walking imposingly inward. Behind <br />
them was the door to the men's bathroom off it's hinges, and an officer whose mouth and <br />
nose were all blood as he lay in a heap against the hallway wall. <br />
<br />
&quot;MEGAN! MARGOT!&quot; Ashley declared.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll have you out in a second Ashley!&quot; Margot promised. <br />
<br />
&quot;Give me the cat ... little girl...&quot; Megan said simply and directly skipping introductions and <br />
drama... Though Margot was surprised to see a LITTLE GIRL lioness, true she had heard <br />
was Ulysses had said but still... &quot;It's very hurt, it's time to put it to sleep.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor showed no reaction to the death's intention. <br />
<br />
&quot;Go to Hell.&quot; Mary said simply and directly. <br />
<br />
&quot;WHY YOU LITTLE-&quot; <br />
<br />
Mary let go of Trevor and Lance, and in that space of time took hold of the pepper spray <br />
Trevor had insisted taking in with them and sprayed it in Megan's face.  Trevor dutifully <br />
taking Lance with him retreated. <br />
<br />
The wolf cried and snarled and instinctively reached for her face. Mary didn't retreat like a <br />
proper cub would, like a child logically should, she attacked. She climbed on Megan like <br />
she was a gremlin on an airplane leaving claw marks up her body and hissing and snarling <br />
tore at Megan's muzzle. <br />
<br />
&quot;MEGAN!&quot; <br />
<br />
Ashley reached through the bar and grabbed her fellow she wolf and pulled Margot into <br />
the bar leaving a ding and an indentation on the impossibly tough she-wolf.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ashley! What the hell are you doing?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Something only someone who actually loves their packmates would do!&quot; Ashley said back, <br />
&quot;The first step to making any dream come true is to wake up Margot.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;UGH! Ashley you don't know what you're saying!&quot; Megan snapped and threw Mary off her <br />
face leaving claw marks behind sending her to the flash hard and turned to deal with their <br />
clearly re-brainwashed pack-mate. <br />
<br />
However, Megan had forgotten something that could have been consider kindergarten <br />
level logic and biology.<br />
<br />
Mary was a cat. Cat landed on their feet. <br />
<br />
Mary landed squarely on all fours and spring boarded and bite Megan right in the green <br />
furry rear. <br />
<br />
Megan let out a yelp and turned to see the annoying lion cun. &quot;I'll rip your face off your <br />
mangy cat!&quot; <br />
<br />
'NOT ONE MORE TIME!' Trevor swore and bite Megan in the ankle sending her off balance. <br />
<br />
Ashley shouted, &quot;Transform or Dare!&quot;<br />
<br />
Margot didn't believe what she just heard, &quot;WHAT?&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan was busy fighting off the two pronged assault from two cats not half her size. <br />
<br />
&quot;I said Transform or Dare... fifty seconds or you get both!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ashley you nut Transform, I can't be, we can't be changed now remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Margot, transform into a person, who can appreciate every we, our pack, you, and our <br />
Master: have done, are doing, and will do, with perfect objectivity.&quot;<br />
<br />
Margot's eyes went wide and the red-violet she wolf shuddered. Then her pupils dilated, <br />
her mouth began slightly open, then she screamed. She held her head, her eyes were the <br />
size of saucers. <br />
<br />
&quot;--GOD!&quot; Margot gasped. <br />
<br />
That was when the orangutan dropped from the ceiling hanging from one arm, then the <br />
two legs and the extra pair of hands/feet did a pair of karate chops to the sides of <br />
Megan's neck... the she wolf fell backwards like timber out cold. <br />
<br />
'God forgive this act of violence I have done upon one of your children.' Paul thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;MARY! ARE YOU OKAY?!&quot; Trevor begged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... yes I am... I promise...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good...&quot; Trevor said look very relieved.<br />
<br />
&quot;FREEZE!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary and Ashley both turned, &quot;Don't worry, the green one's out cold, Ashley put the other <br />
one back in her right mind.&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;We should be working.&quot; Ulysses said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We won't be able to see this view again for a long long time.&quot; Sarah said as the pair was <br />
on the roof looking at the forest property behind the Smith estate. &quot;We should drink it in <br />
while we can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your name is Ulysses-chan and Sarah-san yes?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Call me Sarah-chan it sounds cuter.&quot; Sarah replied knowing absolutely nothing about <br />
Japanese language but wanting to keep up with the beat.<br />
<br />
Standing on the roof top with near super natural grace, Amy stood looking at the pair, <br />
&quot;Your name, it is ULsses-chan yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just Ulysses actually...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;-Chan is merely a term of respect... we need to talk.&quot;</p>
