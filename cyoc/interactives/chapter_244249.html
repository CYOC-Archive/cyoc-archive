<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The rest of July crept by and the first week of August came and went. In all this time, Jon and Lucy continued to investigate what was happening to them, even as they each experienced more and more changes. For Jon, it started with his hands and feet. Writing details down, no matter how trivial they seemed, he soon discovered he had to continuously adjust how he was holding the pencil. Thinking nothing of it at the time, he didn’t become aware of something being off until he went to put on his shoes later.<br />
<br />
Discovering his shoes no longer fit, he decided he’d try to keep it from the Parkers. Positive they&#39;d leap to some conclusion about how he&#39;d done something, and this was another way to prove he wanted to be female, in the end, the only one he told was Lucy, figuring it’s be simple to keep the change hidden. Only to learn it wasn&#39;t as easy as he believed as the rest of his body began to slowly alter itself.<br />
<br />
At a height of sixty-seven inches, and a weight around a hundred and twenty-six, Jon didn&#39;t believe for a minute, if he was to become a girl, any of this would change. But as the days ticked by, he was forced to reevaluate his opinion, as, more and more, the clothes he had were becoming too big. Breaking down, and borrowing a tape measure from Lucy and taking to stepping on the bathroom scale, he took to measuring and weighing himself regularly, and jotting down the results in his notebook. And when the drop in height weight slowed, then stopped, he was dismayed when he looked back over his notes, and saw he now stood at sixty-one point five inches and weighed a hundred and three pounds.<br />
<br />
Yet, the thing with his hands and feet, as well as his height and weight, wasn&#39;t the only odd thing happening. For as he monitored the changes, he began to notice other things. Taking to standing nude in front of a mirror, turning to face it one way, then another, he observed how around the start of August, first the area around his nipples, what he soon learned was called the areola, grew bigger. Worried this meant he was about to grow tits, he took notes on how also his hips, butt and thighs became more pronounced, whilst his waist took on a more pinched look, giving him a slightly curvier body. Wanting to cry, to have it stop, he was even more alarmed when he lost the ability to get an erection, though he still could get sexually aroused, and his junk shrunk and pulled down so low, his cock and balls now rested between his legs, leaving him looking very much like a flat-chested girl whenever he stood with his legs closed.<br />
<br />
From the point he discovered this, things seemed to get worse as first the Parkers noticed the changes, then Dr Deks became aware. Both parties talking to him about it, with more wanting to know if he was taking anything, when it was confirmed he wasn&#39;t, it was decided he was to see a specialist to determine if there was something wrong with him. Poked, prodded, becoming even more uncomfortable with his body, Jon couldn&#39;t decide which was worse, as Mrs Parker, when she went to buy him new clothes, bought him stuff from the tween girl&#39;s section, the way everyone he encountered acted and treated him as if he was a girl, or the way his own mind and body seemed to rebel against him as he took to wearing girl&#39;s clothes as if it was the most natural thing for him to do. And to cap it all off, he was sat down in the kitchen once again, and the Parkers explained, &quot;We understand this is a confusing time for you. But we want you to know we are always here for you, no matter what.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not sure where they were going with this, Jon nodded and thanked them. Glancing at each other, it was Mr Parker who broke the silence by laying out, &quot;We want to you consider something. As you know, you&#39;ll be starting tenth grade in the fall. And with everything that&#39;s happened, with your decision to come out as a girl, how your body for reasons no one can determine yet is making you look more and more like one, we want you to consider something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hesitant to agree to anything, Jon shifted uncomfortably in the chair as he imagined the prospect of going back to school as a girl. His foster parents again giving each other a look, Mrs Parker reached out and gently placing a hand over his, she said, &quot;Jon is a beautiful name. But, the thing of it is, honey, it&#39;s not a girl&#39;s name.&quot;<br />
<br />
This was something he already knew, and was conflicted on. On one hand, he understood he still used a guy&#39;s name, thought of himself using male pronouns, and cringed on the inside to be doing so, as, more than anything, he wanted to use feminine pronouns, be addressed by a girl&#39;s name. Yet, on the other hand, he dreaded the idea, and did everything he could to resist these two things. Mind jumping to these two subjects the instant Mrs Parker told him Jon wasn&#39;t a girl&#39;s name, he half listened as Mr Parker explained, &quot;We don&#39;t want to rush you. But since it&#39;s clear this is what you want, we ask that you think about choosing a more appropriate name. To put it in perspective, consider how you&#39;ve spent almost the whole summer either by yourself or with Lucy, who, it&#39;s fine you hang around with her, it&#39;s just, she&#39;s one girl. But come September, you&#39;ll be around other girls, and they&#39;ll, along with others, notice and call it out if you are still calling yourself Jon.&quot;<br />
<br />
He was slow to nod, as he understood what his foster father was driving at. Wondering if this was the point where he&#39;d have to stop calling himself Jon and decide on a girl&#39;s name, and if doing so meant he was giving up on ever being a guy again, if it also meant he ought to start using female pronouns, he again hardly paid attention when Mr Parker said, &quot;Thank you,&quot; and believing they were done, he was about to ask to be excused when his foster mother said there was one more thing.<br />
<br />
Unsure what else there could be, Jon watched as his foster parents stood. Following their lead, he watched Mr Parker leave the room as Mrs Parker bid him to follow her. Going upstairs, his foster mom grabbed something from the bedroom she shared with his foster father, then lead him toward his room. There, she closed the door, set the box she held on his bed, and turning to him, she explained, &quot;There&#39;s something else I would like you to consider. Whilst your appearance is very much a girl&#39;s, and you are very pretty, there is one thing missing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only one,&quot; Jon thought as Mrs Parker opened the box and withdrew a light beige, almost white, coloured object.<br />
<br />
Despite his trepidation, he was curious to know what it was, especially as it looked to have a nipple on it. And then he was told what it was as his foster mother filled him in with, &quot;This is a breast insert. Those bras I bought you, I would like you to consider wearing this with them, as girls your age generally tend to have some breast growth,&quot; before explaining how to care for them, the away he could apply them so they stuck to his chest, and when he wasn&#39;t to wear them. After she finished, she had him remove his shirt, something he was ill at ease doing, but complying, he was then shown on how to put on a bra, the way to insert the breast forms, how to remove the bra, then guided through using a glue adhesive to stick the breast forms to his chest.<br />
<br />
Able to wear them without a bra, Mrs Parker advised he not do this, and under her watchful eye, he again put back on the bra, then his shirt. Afterward, looking down at the pert swell which filled the B cup size bra, Jon again felt conflicted. Listening as his foster mom encouraged him to leave the breast forms in, that he try and get used to them and the bra, he wanted to refuse, but his mind and body had other ideas as he nodded and replied, &quot;Okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a nod and a hug he found comforting, Mrs Parker left the room. Alone, Jon turned to the mirror Mr Parker had hung a bit ago on the back of the closet door. Staring at his reflection. he again wanted to cry as he saw a girl wearing a pair of denim jeans shorts and a t-shirt with flowers and butterflies on it stretched outward by what was now beneath it looking back at him. Turning away, going over to door, he almost left his bedroom, but at the last second, Jon closed the door and locked it. Shucking off the shorts, shirt, then the bra, he returned to standing before the mirror. Looking at his reflection, seeing a girl with breasts he couldn&#39;t decide if they look real or not, wearing a pair of boyshorts, he shucked off the last garment and tossed it on his bed. Holding his legs together, he turned back to the mirror. Eyes straying over the breast forms, down his flat stomach and to the small, triangle-shaped thatch of pubic hair, he whispered after a minute, &quot;I am a girl, and my name is Madison McKenna.&quot;</p>
