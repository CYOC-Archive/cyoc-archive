<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The red morning sun boiled over the valley one hot day. Your partner was perfectly nesting the clutch of eggs as she covered them with warmth. The dick girl and her partner was off scavenging the landscape for food. As she laid on the eggs you could feel and hear a few of them in the eggs. You could feel life and hear a small delicate heartbeat with each one. The morning was pretty tame and dull since you didn’t have the dick girl to talk to. Though feeling your partner’s babies move around their little speckled shells, was a very nice experience you shared around every morning.<br />
<br />
You were kind of worried; you had hoped they’d hatch sooner. It was about 3 months since you laid this clutch and the new clutch would be soon on their way. Each day you worried that something might have happened while on our journey, however the heartbeats you could hear told otherwise.<br />
<br />
It only took one new rapid heartbeat to startle you into reality. Of course your partner sensed to was well, as she quickly lessened the pressure off the eggs. She turned and both of you looked at the nest. There was one egg that started to move. It firstly wobbled onto its side as the t-rex inside try to break out. It was slow, but for some reason it felt like it happened faster than what you comprehend. The small pecker began to prick through the egg as you could see a few others start to tremble with life as they started to usher themselves out of their pods.<br />
<br />
The male t-rex came into sight as it was holding a small dinosaur carcass in his mouth. It seemed like a smile was had formed hoping your partner would start to join him in breakfast, she didn’t look over. He seemed confused until he look over to the nest as he soon found what directed her attention from him. He dropped the carcass on the ground with a loud bound. He rushed to her side as he began to nuzzle her and she did to him. <br />
<br />
“When did this start?” The dick girl said as she came furling out of her little sheath as both of your partners began to get hot for each other.<br />
<br />
“I think 20 minutes ago.” You quickly answered her. <br />
<br />
The first t-rex had pushed their little head out as they began to break their shell with its body. But before you could even finish watching it come out, you felt the need to hurl. Your stomach was building up this nauseating feel that you would think you could get use to her urinating out of you. The pain was immeasurable as your partner was also in pain. The male t-rex stepped away from you as your partner squatted down with you facing the ground. She applied pressure as you started to release the pee. Though something rough and solid push out and landing on the ground. Before you could comprehend what just happened, the next egg began to push out of you feeling even more pain than the last. You now realized she was laying her next batch of eggs already. Your partner began to whine and howl like a wounded wolf. One after the the other each egg came and rolled out onto the ground. Your whole body was burning and on fire through the whole procedure. You screamed internally, as you were feeling you could easily pass out at any moment. You kept going as the last few slid out of your cervix and finally onto the ground. Your mouth leaked slimy fluid onto the batch of eggs as you quickly passed out from the pain.<br />
<br />
You woke up from your nicely earned sleep and the day was almost over. The sun was now setting and before you cried ‘what happened’ you heard the voice of your friend. <br />
<br />
“Did you have a nice sleep?” She asked very seductively. The t-rex couple was laying on the ground as you began to hear little screeches and yapping noises. “Can you hear your kids, they’re really cute.” She chuckled.<br />
<br />
“What do they look like?” I asked. <br />
<br />
“Like your hostess, green with blue bellies. Wide yellow eyes filled with wonder and excitement. They’re pretty hard to calm down, probably needed a maternal touch. After when you were knocked out, your partner fainted as well. She seems to be waking up as well.” You could hear her pulse begin to quicken as she seemed to want to look at her kids. SHe stood a little off balance at first but quickly fortified herself. She found the little dinos under a piece of hide from the dinosaur the male had killed earlier today. They were rolling around and screeching but still stayed under the hide. “Like the blanket my partner whipped up. It was able to cover them while they try to get some sleep.”<br />
<br />
As she looked at her young you only counted that 5 hatched. “Where’s the rest? How many did I get birth out?” You seemed to be a little worried again.<br />
<br />
“They’ll come out when they’re ready, and as for how many you laid, well I think about 19. I hope they’ll be as pretty like us. Come, tell your t-rex to come to bed with us.” You tried to stimulate the connection you had with your partner to go lay back down. She then looked back at the nest and saw another hide covering the eggs for the night. <br />
<br />
She then laid down next to the other t-rex. You still feel wide awake for the time being. <br />
“Could you hear the crying, I still can.” Your girl dick was talking away.<br />
<br />
“Are you talking to yourself?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, but can you hear the crying?”<br />
<br />
“I can hear screeching, I don’t think they’re crying though.”<br />
<br />
“That not what I mean.” She sighed. “I can hear the crying of newborn babies like in our old lives. I think the t-rex babies have human babies as their genitals.” <br />
<br />
“So, how is that possible? Wasn’t the way we got here was by something weird we didn’t take seriously, it seems like this story is being made up as it goes along.”<br />
<br />
“Look, it seems crazy, but I think the souls of human babies are coming to the past and possessing the dinosaur’s genitals. Whatever you may think, they need our help to survive. I’d like us to work together to to take care of them when they grow up. They need comfort and nurturing. They need a mother more than a father.”<br />
<br />
I started to think for a minute before commenting back. “So do you think they’ve swapped genders as well?”<br />
<br />
“I can’t tell now, but there’s 3 boys and 2 girls so we’ll see.” <br />
<br />
You and your dick girlfriend kept talking until you finally went back to sleep. Dreaming of becoming the mother to your new dino genital babies.</p>
