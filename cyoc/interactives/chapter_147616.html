<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Megan rode on the bus giddy as could be. The limit on her magic didn&#39;t even faze her as she rode along to school. Normally, at this time of day, Megan would be loathing every second of this sort of trip. Now, however, she couldn&#39;t wait to get to school. The bus stopped again and her Asian-American friend Kim walked on the bus and sat next to her as usual. Megan tried not to spill the beans about how excited she was for magical mayhem as the bus arrived at school.<br />
<br />
Although she was still listening along to Kim&#39;s story, Megan&#39;s mind continued to drift. She wondered what the extant of her magic was. Could she make a teacher a student or vice versa, or would that be too far? She could also completely decimate the school popularity ladder but that would take a few days to do and Megan wanted quicker results than that. &quot;Maybe Jenna could be a janitor, or I could make her date Jeremy Philips or...&quot; She began to think before she felt a tap on her shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Megan, are you okay?&quot; Kim asked slightly concerned. &quot;You seem a little, absent minded today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh sorry, I got lost in thought.&quot; Megan explained. &quot;It was a LONG weekend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, probably because of all that work we had to do for the presentation today.&quot; Kim laughed. &quot;Man that took me forever to do, what about you?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
Megan&#39;s heart dropped into her stomach as she began to internally scream. &quot;Oh God!&quot; She thought. &quot;I completely forgot to do my presentation. All that stupid magic stuff completely made me forget.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah...&quot; Megan lied. &quot;It was, tough.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Definitely, especially the part where it asked you to...&quot; Kim continued but Megan wasn&#39;t listening.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do I do what do I do.&quot; She thought over and over. &quot;The presentation is first period I have no way of doing it now.&quot; That&#39;s when it finally clicked in her head. She had magic. She knew she could change lives, but could she change her life so minimally as to just make herself stay the same but with her project done?<br />
<br />
Megan slyly took out the mirror and looked into it, causing it to glow. No-one seemed to notice this and Megan quickly put it away before Kim could notice. Megan felt her bag get heavy and she sighed in relief. She felt great knowing she just dodged a MAJOR bullet, but now she felt annoyed that she could only use the mirror two more times today!<br />
<br />
Megan and Kim made it to class and both did their presentations flawlessly. Megan sat down relieved to have avoided trouble and embarrassment, but now had to limit her magical options to two. The class ended a few minutes later, and Megan waved Kim goodbye as they went their separate directions to their next classes. Megan sighed to herself as she entered Algebra.<br />
<br />
She hated that class, not just because the teacher was annoying, and the class was annoying, but she knew no one that took the class. They were either people she didn&#39;t talk to or people she hated. Even though it was just the second period of the day, Megan needed something to distract her through this class.<br />
<br />
She slyly pulled out he little compact mirror, and decided to mess with the teacher, Mr. Marlow. He was a pretty handsome guy all things considered, but he was crazy obnoxious. He always called on random people to come up to the board and called you out if you weren&#39;t doing the work correctly. More people would hate him if he wasn&#39;t a late 20&#39;s Italian pretty boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;He always makes me feel dumb, so I&#39;ll give him a taste of his own medicine.&quot; Megan thought. She pulled out the mirror when he had his back turned to the class, and activated its magic. Once again no one seemed to notice the glow of the mirror, and no one noticed reality change in front of them.<br />
<br />
Mr. Marlow&#39;s clothes immediately shifted form a work shirt and tie into a middle schooler&#39;s minecraft t-shirt. His Khakis became shorts and his work shoes became sneakers. His writing on the board got a lot messier and he was no longer writing a question, but the answer to a question. From the looks of it, Megan&#39;s mirror worked perfectly. Megan changed Mr. Marlow&#39;s job as a teacher into his role as a middle school student.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Barry.&quot; A woman&#39;s voice rang. Megan was confused until she saw a middle aged woman she had never seen before sitting at Mr. Marlow&#39;s old desk. &quot;Barry&quot; quietly sat down at a desk that was now there for him, and Megan almost burst out laughing. From the looks of it, Mr. Marlow was still considered the same age and level of intelligence, but instead of working as a teacher he was now considered a student.<br />
<br />
The lesson went on without a hitch as Megan loved every second of it. The new teacher that took Mr. Marlow&#39;s place was a lot nicer than he ever was. It was also a lot of fun seeing Mr. Marlow forced to take notes and sit in a desk that was way too small for him. Megan left the class with a smile on her face. She followed Mr. Marlow for a minute before tapping him on the shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Barry.&quot; She said emphasizing his name. &quot;How are you?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Megan please.&quot; He said annoyed. &quot;I&#39;m 29 years old, like everyone else, I&#39;d like you to call me Mr. Marlow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan was annoyed that he could still pretend to have authority while he was wearing a minecraft shirt.<br />
&quot;So, why are you a middle school student?&quot; She asked confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you hit your head or something?&quot; He said weirded out. &quot;I&#39;ve always been a middle school student. Ever since I graduated college. Now if you don&#39;t mind, I have to get to class.&quot; He said as he walked off.<br />
<br />
Megan was stunned and confused by the power she now had, but she was also stumped in general. It seemed her reality bending powers were powerful, but one use leaves some things a little jumbled. Just changing Mr. Marlow&#39;s occupation and not his perceived age made his life very confusing for Megan to understand. She almost wanted to finish the job, but then she remembered that she only had  one left for the day.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shoot.&quot; She thought. &quot;I better save it for when I really need it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The rest of the day chugged along and class after class went by with no real issues. She went through her next three classes without much trouble. There were no other teachers that she really despised or no other terrible classes, so she ended up saving her last mirror use. In one of them she saw &quot;Barry&quot; again and he seemed to be hating the class so that made Megan laugh a little.<br />
<br />
Finally lunch came and Megan still hadn&#39;t thought of another use. She was sitting with Kim and a few other friends while she was half listening to them and thinking about the mirror. She held the mirror in her hand, flipping it around, trying to think if something. &quot;I could change that bitch Kellie&#39;s dad into a garbage collector. Or maybe I could make Jenna over there into a mental 5 year old so she could just humiliate herself. Or..&quot; She kept thinking away as her friends chatted away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Megan, could I borrow your mirror for a second I&#39;ve been meaning to check something.&quot; Kim asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Oh yeah sure.&quot; She said as she handed Kim the mirror. Megan continued to think about what she could do until she suddenly stopped dead in her tracts. Her brain caught up and she realized she just handed the mirror over to Kim. Megan also knew how the mirror worked, so if Kim let somebody willingly have the mirror, then they could use it. She knew she and her family would be the only ones aware, but she was still crazy nervous.<br />
<br />
Oh God.&quot; She thought. &quot;If Kim even daydreams or something with that mirror, then reality itself would change. And I won&#39;t be able to change it back cause that&#39;s the last one I&#39;m allowed for today.&quot; She thought as she nervously stared at her friend.<br />
<br />
Kim continued to check her face, when suddenly, it began to glow. Only Megan noticed as she braced for impact. Reality changed once again and somebody&#39;s life was altered.</p>
