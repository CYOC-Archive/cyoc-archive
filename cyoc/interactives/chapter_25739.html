<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lisa and Wendy drove to the meeting.<p>

“I really thought we were going to lose you there for a bit, Wen. Glad you decided to join us.”<p>

Wendy giggled. “Well, I think I will definitely accept the promotion you’re offering me, but I’ll pass on being a werewolf.” She smiled to reassure her. “Don’t worry, Lisa. I will do everything I can to ensure that you and your sisters remain safe and in secret, but no, I like being human just fine.”<p>

Lisa’s eyes widened in fear, she swallowed hard and whispered with genuine sympathy to her passenger…<p>

“Oh sweet Wendy…”<p>

Lisa and Wendy were silent for the rest of their trip back to the health club.  Lisa took note of the Southern Indiana Gas & Electric Company van that was parked in the vacant lot across the street, like it had been three days ago, before the same space was occupied by a phone company truck two days ago and one from the water company yesterday.  She was confident that the highly tinted windows in her SUV made it impossible for her avid fans to know that Wendy was in the truck with her, and she pulled into her regular space in the parking deck below the club so no one would see Wendy return with her.<p>

Avoiding the main enterance to the club also allowed Lisa to avoid the advertising execs that waited in the lobby for their meeting.  Checking her watch, Lisa noted it was 2:35.  She had 25 minutes until the scheduled meeting.  She needed to work quickly and have a real heart-to-heart with Wendy.  She led her up the rear stairway to her private office.<p>

"Can I get you something to drink, hon?" Lisa asked.<p>

"No, I'm fine," Wendy responded quickly before settling in on the leather couch next to Lisa's desk.<p>

Lisa sat right beside her, after the intamacy she'd already expericened, Wendy was hardly suprised that she didn't feel put off by Lisa's closeness.  In fact, she felt a familar euphoria rise as Lisa nestled in beside her.<p>

"So, Wendy," Lisa began, "I'm grateful that you've agreed to protect my pack's secret," Wendy smiled.  Inside she was glad that she had pleased Lisa.  "But," Lisa continued, "I'm a little concerned about what you said about being a werewolf."<p>

Lisa cocked her head to the right and looked at Wendy with soft, pleading eyes, waiting for Wendy to express herself.<p>

"Well, Lisa," Wendy stammered, "It's just that, I'm ... I'm not sure..."<p>

"Not sure of what, dear,"<p>

"I'm not sure of what it all means.  Until a couple of weeks ago, I had no idea that werewolves even existed, and now, and now you want me to BE ONE. I .... I don't ..."<p>

"Wendy," Lisa interrupted, "Tell me, did you enjoy this afternoon?"<p>

Wendy blushed and after a few seconds, nodded slowly.<p>

"Have you ever in your life had an expreience like the one you had with my sisters and me?"<p>

Wendy giggled nervously, "Oh, God no!" she blurted out.<p>

Lisa took Wendy's hands in hers and placed them on her lap.  "Do you ever think you'll ever have an experience that comes close to that with a mere human?"<p>

Wendy didn't say a word, but she knew the answer, and she stared into Lisa's eyes as she turned her head back and forth as her panties ran damp.<p>

"Wendy, I've offered you a gift.  An opportunity to be something far more than a mere human.  An opportunity to feel the way you did today, every day for the rest of your life.  An opportunity to be strong, powerful and wild.  An opportunity to be a part of something greater than any human society has ever created - a pack.  A pack that will love you and care for you and keep you safe.<p>

"Werewolves are nearly invincable, Wendy, did you know that?  There's hardly a thing in this world that can kill us.  And we heal from any non-leathal injury in a fraction of the time it would take a human to heal, if they could even survive."  Lisa pulled Wendy's hands to her chest and pressed them against her.<p>  

"We hardly age.  It's been eighteen years since I became a werewolf, and I barely look a day older.  We can live hundreds of years.  There are stories of ancients who have been around for more than a millenium.<p>

"Wouldn't you like that, Wendy?  Wouldn't you like to live for centuries ... with me ... with your sisters?"<p>

Wendy swooned and fell into Lisa's arms.  She felt so good there in Lisa's embrace, so protected, so loved.<p>

Then she began to cry.  She didn't know if they were tears from fear or tears from relief or tears from joy, but she sobbed quitely on Lisa's shoulder.<p>

"I'm just too scared to do it," Wendy whispered into Lisa's ear.<p>

"It's okay, Wendy," Lisa reassured.  "You don't have to worry about that."<p>

Lisa paused to let her words sink in.<p>

"Because you already have."<p>

Wendy pulled back and starred at Lisa, her eyes narrowed as she asked, "What do you mean?  No one bit me."<p>

"Wendy, the gift of lycanthopy is passed though an exchange of bodily fluids. Remember what Sharon told you about her contact with Solange?  Do you think there was any bitting in that relationship,... atleast before?"<p>

Wendy still looked confused.<p>

"After enough sexual contact with a werewolf, lycanthropy is passed on.  Besides, its a much more enjoyable way to welcome a sister into the fold than a nasty bite."<p>

"What do you mean, 'enough'?" Wendy asked.  "I mean, Sharon and I didn't, you know, that much."<p>

"Oh, Wendy, I think you did more than enough, but we won't be certian until the next full moon.  If you did receive the gift, you'll feel your body bathed in the light of the full moon.  It will touch every aspect of your being, and it will call you to let the wolf, your wolf out, to surrender to the primal passion and run free with your sisters."<p>

"Oh, God," Wendy exclaimed. She was excited and dismayed at the smae time by the thought of what could happen to her.  She was also dismayed at the uncertiantly of it all.  Had she been infected?  Was she really a werewolf?  Would it really feel that good if she was?<p>

Wendy fell back into Lisa's arms and cried again. "I think the next few weeks are going to drive me nuts."<p>

"They don't have to," Lisa reassured her.  She hugged Wendy close and the same feelings of love and safety returned to her.<p>

"We could make love again. right here, right now.  I could turn into a wolf and you could taste my essesnce, and I could taste yours.  By the time we're done, there'd be no doubt that you'd be a werewolf, just like me."  Lisa smiled sincerely at the offer.<p>

Wendy's heart began to pound and she trembled as she pulled Lisa close, but she wasn't certian if it was simply from the offer of sex with Lisa or what that would mean.  She would feel like she had earlier with Sharon, and that would be wonderful.<p>

"Tell me what I'd be," Wendy whispered into Lisa's ear.<p>

Lisa pulled Wendy's ear to her lips and licked it softly as she becan to rub her hands along Wendy's body.<p>

"You'll be a werewolf, Wendy," Lisa said.<p>

Wendy moaned at the the words.<p>

"You'll be strong and powerful, with a sleek, sexy body.  You'll change in the moonlight.  You'll grow thick rich fur, a long tail, and sharp claws and fangs.<p>

"I'll lick your snout and your furry snatch under the light of the moon."<p>

Wendy rocked her body against Lisa's as she tried to calm the lust that was welling up inside her.<p>

"And we'll howl at the moon together!"<p>

Wendy pulled Lisa's lips to hers.</p>
