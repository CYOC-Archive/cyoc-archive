<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Sorry, have a very tiring job now and can&#39;t quite pump out chapters like I used to.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Kai?” Spencer paused, startled by how deep his voice had become. “I…err..What’s happening to me?”<br />
<br />
“Happening to you?” Kai grinned and adjusted his glasses. “You’re getting a haircut, silly! You short-haired breeds have it easy, no scissors needed. Look, they even have the clippers in the size we need!” Kai held up clippers with a vacuum attachment. “Self-groom stations sure are convenient, huh, bud?”<br />
<br />
“Self-groom?” Spencer’s brow wrinkled and he leaned over the side of the plexiglass shield. <br />
<br />
Sure enough, on the side of the station was a sign that proclaimed it a self-groom station in the same blue and yellow cartoonish lettering that was everywhere in the store. He was pretty sure it had just said ‘For Large Breeds!’ before, but…was he misremembering it? The smell of cinnamon was so strong, he couldn’t recall. The booth next to his said it, Spencer realized. Maybe he’d mixed the two up?<br />
<br />
“Oh, you know what?” Kai spoke up suddenly, tearing Spencer away from his thoughts. “Maybe I should go get the blow dryer and my shampoo ready too.”<br />
<br />
“Your shampoo?” Spencer asked, feeling increasingly confused.<br />
<br />
“Oh, it’s really nice! You’ll see. Just hang on for another minute. It’s easier to clip short-hair if your fur is wet, then you can rinse off when I join you!” Kai hustled off to a nearby table and selected a bottle.<br />
<br />
Did he just say he was joining him? Spencer realized the tub appeared even bigger than he’d remembered, like a very large shower one might find at a truck-stop restroom. How he’d ever thought it was a little cramped was beyond him. He shivered and found his whole body getting into the motion, spraying water in a wave against the glass and walls.<br />
<br />
“Alright, back!” Kai announced, placing the blower nozzle and a pearly bottle of shampoo next to Spencer’s clothes. He picked up the clippers. “Did you know they actually increased the prices on these shampoos! Almost twenty dollars. Ridiculous! Okay big guy, open up that door and let’s get cutting!”<br />
<br />
Spencer opened the door without even thinking about it, completely unconcerned about being nude. A niggling voice in his head, mostly muzzled by that incredible cinnamon smell, told him that was weird, but then again, he was super muscular, why not show off? Spencer grinned and posed, puffing his chest proudly as the smaller man ran the clippers over his hefty pecs.<br />
<br />
Kai worked fast, as though he’d groomed anthropomorphic Rottweilers all the time. The clippers ran over his musclegut. Sure, Spencer maybe had eaten a few too many calories, but that was what happened when you bulked in your off season. Kai slapped his flabby gut playfully and grinned up at him as he continued the groom. Spencer smiled and stretched himself against the wall of the shower, letting the twink have his fun. Each pass of the clippers just vibrated his muscles, like a very light massage. The sensations were so pleasant they engorged his red, lipstick-like cock.<br />
<br />
“Alrighty, all done!’ Kai smiled, cupping Spencer’s balls and the obvious erection he was sporting. “Someone’s enjoying their personal grooming, huh?”<br />
<br />
Spencer smirked. <br />
<br />
Kai swept out the stall and stripped, revealing his smooth little body. Spencer’s cock stayed hard as the young man carefully set his glasses next to their clothes and picked up his shampoo. He stepped into the shower and Spencer closed the door, giving them both some privacy. With his other paw, he started the shower again.<br />
<br />
“You wanna shower with me that bad, huh?” Spencer grinned toothily down at Kai.<br />
<br />
Kai glanced over his shoulder coyly. “Come on, get me all wet.”<br />
<br />
The big Rottweiler took the shower head and gently sprayed the water in the twink’s pink hair and then moved the spray down, making sure to wet every nook and cranny. Thoroughly wet, the dog-man picked up Kai’s shampoo and squeezed a thick dollop into his huge paws. He sniffed. Vanilla and tea-scented.<br />
<br />
Kai moaned as Spencer massaged the sudsy shampoo into his flesh, not even noticing the thick white hairs rising from his skin. It all tingled oh-so-pleasantly that it had him panting, tongue lolling out the side of his burgeoning muzzle as his muscles gained definition under his growing coat of fur. <br />
<br />
Spencer&#39;s hands roamed over the lithe man’s body before he shampooed his head, rubbing the suds in thoroughly. Kai’s pink dye-job stayed, hair growing a bit longer, ears pulling up to the top of his head and lengthening until the flopped over cutely. The big Rottweiler playfully tweaked them.<br />
<br />
“Hey, stop that!” Kai snarled.<br />
<br />
“Sorry. Your ears are just too cute!” Spencer replied with a toothy grin. <br />
<br />
His hands roamed over the transforming man’s ass, feeling it firm up under his paws. Something lumpy began to bulge from Kai’s tailbone and the Rottie idly tweaked it. The tail grew longer and longer before it exploded with fluffy fur. As the scrub-down finished and the new Border Collie appeared, Spencer turned on the shower head and began to thoroughly rinse ou the heavy coat.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, my breed has a lot of fur.” Kai giggled. <br />
<br />
“I think it’s nice.” Spencer inspected the collie carefully.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, me too. Except my barber’s bill is, like, 120 bucks a month. Yours is free.” Kai chuckled.<br />
<br />
Spencer let his paws roam across the border collie’s tight little body. Kai turned and stared up at the big Rottie, startling blue eyes glistening in the soft overhead lighting. The bigger dog caressed the new dog’s perfect bubble but and squeezed, pulling the twinky collie closer. The smell of cinnamon and vanilla breakfast tea swirled in the stall, filling both of the occupant’s nostrils.<br />
<br />
“Wow, I-I can’t believe this is really happening! Y-you’re a really hot daddy.” Kai stammered, hand-paws pressed against Spencer’s pillowy pecs. “I, uh, wasn’t actually sure you’d let me groom you, to be honest. I tried to play it off like everything was normal, you know? I’m kind of a dork and I’m not so good when it comes to this kinda stuff. Do I act casual or do I-”<br />
<br />
Kai’s babbling was cut off as the rottweiler leaned down and parted Kai’s pointy muzzle with his own, their long, canine tongues sliding against each other. Spencer was shocked at how forward he was becoming, not quite sure, what he was doing, but couldn’t deny how lovely it was to take charge. He wrestled with Kai’s curious, probing tongue, exploring the collie’s muzzle.<br />
<br />
They continued caressing each other, claws combing through wet fur. The smell of the shampoos were beginning to lose out to the cloying scent of doggy lust as their bare members throbbed between them. After another minute of enjoying each other’s bodies-Spencer’s hefty and thick, Kai’s lithe and tight, they broke apart.<br />
<br />
“Are we…moving too fast?” Kai spoke breathlessly, desperately wanting another kiss, his paws still running across the Rottweiler’s short coat.<br />
<br />
“Not fast enough.” Spencer growled, turning Kai around roughly and forcing him against the wall.<br />
<br />
Kai supported himself with both paws, tail hiking up and exposing his pink anus as the Rottweiler got on his knees behind him. Spencer sniffed the dainty Border Collie’s tight hole, inhaling his unique bouquet. It told him everything he needed to know: that Kai was healthy, horny and needy for a proper breeding. He never questioned how he knew that. Spencer opened his maw and let his tongue slide slowly across the twink’s entrance.<br />
<br />
The collie’s body tensed as he felt the tongue shove in, easily sliding past his clenched ring. Kai writhed around the hot, slippery intruder, moaning. Spencer reached under him and gently squeezed his balls in one clawed hand as he lapped the other dog’s hole teasingly. Kai shivered at the sensation as the tongue licked in again and again, Spencer shoving his muzzle deeper between the twink’s bulbous ass cheeks. His hole eventually gave up, twitching and quivering loosely around the warm tongue.<br />
<br />
“Spencer…” Kai groaned, mind overwhelmed with pleasure as the Rottweiler gave his loosened hole one last lick and squeezed Kai’s balls before standing. “F-fuck me!”<br />
<br />
“That’s the plan.” Spencer replied, spreading Kai’s legs and forcing his ass further into the air, hole at perfect waist height. “Hold on tight.”<br />
<br />
Spencer lined up his girthy rocket with Kai’s asshole and slowly pressed in. The feeling of that massive red spire cramming itself in his moist hole sent electric tingles up the Border Collie’s spine. The Rottweiler was relentless, shoving himself deeper and deeper until his knot bumped Kai’s stretched orifice. The big bear of a dog began rocking his hips, stubby tail wagging behind him.<br />
<br />
“You’re so fucking tight, Kai!’ Spencer panted, tongue lolling out as Kai’s hole clenched and squeezed around his shaft.<br />
<br />
He pistoned his cock into the writhing twink below him, each bump of his knot stretching Kai a little wider. Kai quivered, glad he had his arms to hold his weight as his legs had turned to jelly with pleasure as Spencer&#39;s knot almost slipped inside his hot depths. It hurt, but it was a good hurt, the kind that made him desperate to have the big dog seed him like a bitch. He rocked back into the fuck, feeling his insides tense and twist around the turgid shaft. <br />
<br />
The two working together was enough for Spencer to slam home his knot. Spencer groaned as Kai’s ass seemed to suck and pull on the cock locked inside him. The bigger male’s virile balls slapped hard against the Border Collie’s perfect ass. It was so good, so tight-Spencer felt his balls begin to tense, an orgasm barreling down on him.<br />
<br />
“Oh shit! I’m gonna cum!” Spencer groaned. “I can’t hold back!”<br />
<br />
“Breed me!” Kai moaned.<br />
<br />
Spencer slammed his cock home one last time, pulling the smaller dog close, and came. Hot, pressurized waves of jizz pumped into Kai’s insides. Each spurt of masculinity was bigger than the last, absolutely flooding Kai’s insides with warm cum. The big Rottweiler reached around and grasped Kai’s knot and squeezed firmly.<br />
<br />
Kai let out a strangled yelp as his own orgasm overtook him. Thick ropes of canine pleasure splattered the wall of the wash-stall. They continued screwing, bodies feeling insatiable as Kai’s tight hole milked Spencer’s cock for every last drop of semen. At last, the ejaculation slowed and they panted together under the shower, basking in the after glow.<br />
<br />
“You busy tonight?” Spencer whispered, cock still lodged in the Collie’s ass.<br />
<br />
“I’ve got a DND game in about fifteen minutes.” Kai whispered back, tail wagging.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we better get you off my knot so we can clean up, huh?” Spencer replied. <br />
<br />
The Rottweiler pulled back slowly, knot straining Kai’s hole. Then, just as Kai began to relax, the big dog pushed him away, knot stretching him wide and slide out with a popping sound. The Border Collie yelped  his displeasure, his ass suddenly feeling empty.<br />
<br />
The big Rottie began showering them both off, careful to get any fluids out of their fur.</p>
