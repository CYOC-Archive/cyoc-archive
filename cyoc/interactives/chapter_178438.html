<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Walking through the office floor with a confident hop to her struts Jasmine held her head high in bliss at having the best job in the world. Not only was she required to show off her body in the most skimpiest outfits imaginable but she also was required to show off her formidable skill in the bedroom to all of the eager males in the office and few females that thought she was a sexual challenge worth facing. Grabbing both shoulder straps of her slingshot bikini and pulling them up in an obvious sexual tease of her crotch to the male staff looking over their desks and cubicle walls towards her Jasmine knew that she just needed to bat them an eye or a flash of a smile to have them swooning over her for her services.<br />
<br />
Still even with all this attention directed at her and her body that she adored Jasmine felt what could only be described as off following her encounter with Dave in his office earlier. Somehow she had ended up in his office but she couldn’t remember how she ended up there or for what original reason? Still that wasn’t anything to get uptight over as she had had a busy day fucking multiple men at their office desks or on their couches that morning as well as the occasional blowjob hence her encounter with Dave. Jasmine thought that she may have been so caught up in the moment of another opportunity to perform sexual acts that she had simply forgotten how she had gotten to Dave’s office in the first place. Jasmine herself knew how uncontrollably horny she got when she was asked by a person on the office floor to perform a sex act on them, she could barely form coherent thoughts in that moment. Still something perturbed her about the encounter and how she couldn’t recall anything happening before meeting Dave. Sure she remembered her life servicing the office before the encounter but those memories seemed more like what you would read in a book or diary and not something she could recall with any certainty to have happened.<br />
<br />
Jasmine felt like the best course of action would be to go back to Dave’s office and ask him about the particulars of what she was doing before she went into his office. Jasmine would have no problem jogging Dave’s memory with a pick me up if he wanted for that was her job after all, not like she could help herself being in close proximity to a man such as himself. Spinning around and beginning to strut in the opposite direction to where she was originally going Jasmine began gaining ground closer to Dave’s office when over the loudspeaker Pete Simpson came on the mic “This is Peter Simpson Jasmine Daniels please report to my office.” As soon as she heard her name and where she was needed by the intercom Jasmines legs ground to a halt as she stood up straight with her heels brought together and her mind went blank. The wiping of her memory was so quick that one of Jasmine’s feet was suspended in the air unable to move as she received her instructions and then had no idea a second later why she was walking towards Dave’s office. Suddenly her blank mind was replaced by images of Pete and her previous sexual encounters with him and what he liked her to do to him and him to her. Immediately Jasmine began panting and sweating profusely at the thoughts as her nipples became rock hard and she felt a heating pressure building in her genitals. Spinning on her feet again Jasmine headed in another direction towards Pete’s office a short distance away almost sprinting as she needed to get to him as soon as possible to meet her needs. Not even waiting for Pete’s beautiful secretary to buzz her in Jasmine rushed up to the closed door as the secretary smiled and nodded to her. Swinging open the door Jasmine rushed into the room and closed the door behind her.<br />
<br />
Looking at the stripped and naked man behind the desk before her Jasmine had to bow her head down and take deep exasperated panting breaths as the sight and her own sexual needs had begun to overwhelm her. Knowing exactly what he expected of her Jasmine immediately undid the straps to her bikini and stepped out of her unzipped stilettos to become naked as well. “Hey Jasmine nice of you to join me” said Pete as he got up from behind his desk and began rapidly walking towards Jasmine. She only had a second to look back up from her panting before the now running Pete ran into her picked her up by the ass and ran her back hard into the wall his erection plunging deep into her at the same time. Jasmine screamed pure erotic energy at this entry as Pete began pumping away and she wrapped her arms around his neck and began passionately kissing his mouth and neck.<br />
<br />
Some time had passed and Jasmine found herself coming to on her stomach on Pete’s couch. Lifting her pretty little head to stare with a smile at the now fully clothed Pete typing away at his desk Jasmine knew that it was time to go get cleaned up and was given permission by Pete to use his office restroom to get herself presentable again. After washing herself with the sink following time on the toilet Jasmine stretched her slingshot bikini up over her curves and shoulders and back onto her body then zipped her stilettos back on and fixed her hair and makeup. Feeling satisfied with her work and striking several poses in the mirror kissing and laughing at herself Jasmine exited the bathroom. Pete didn’t even acknowledge her as she made her way to the door being so engrossed in his work still she felt it was her duty to ask if there was anything else she could help with “Pete is their anything else I can help you with?” pouted Jasmine hoping above all else seconds were in order as the thought began to make her horny all over again. “That will be all for now Jasmine thank you” Pete’s words immediately depressed Jasmine but she still felt it best to put on a smiling face to the occasion “OK that&#39;s cool Pete see you later” Waving her hand at him and happily bouncing out the door.<br />
<br />
As soon as she exited Pete’s office Jasmines original train of thought regarding Dave’s office returned and she realized with a yelp of fear that whenever she had a job to perform her non-career oriented thoughts and motivations would be temporarily wiped from her mind as her sexual appetite and duties took over. Jasmine knew now more then ever she needed to get to Dave’s office and ask him about her day but still she had a second thought about the whole investigation. “Should I really be so worried about who I am and what my life entails even with a few memory hiccups? I know who I am and I am happy with who I am and that should be enough proof to myself of my identity but still something doesn’t sit right with how I feel. I should just go find another job to perform in the office right now and forget I ever had these thoughts but I also don’t want to give up on something that could be important.” Jasmine mired over these thoughts for a long time and partly wished a job would come over the intercom right now as she could use the distraction. Her mind and body was made for sex not mental questions of existence and the sense of self. Jasmine was at a crossroad, either she could continue to Dave’s office to get to the bottom of her dilemma or she could just forget about her questions and continue on with her life and all the happiness and fulfillment it brought her and others?</p>
