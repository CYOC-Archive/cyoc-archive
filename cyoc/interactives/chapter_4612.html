<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The brite lights of the boardwalk hurt my eyes as I bounced off of people and an occasional lamp post. Drunk and still scared the sight of the donkey headed man stuck in my memory. <br />
<br />
Feeling evermore and more out of breathe I exhaled harshly as never before. I was overly warm from the booze and sweating like a race horse all over my body. I knew I must get to the Ferry landing and try to go home and recooperate.<br />
<br />
Now noise of people and the brite lights stirred my blood, the thought of just running away pressed hard at my mind. I began to dash first in one direction and then in another all the time wanting to make it back to that damn boat.  Whether it was fear or the free booze I'd swallowed in such quanity I started to run in a straight line.  The feelings from running seemed so personally satisfactory I felt myself digging in and going faster than I'd ever run before.<br />
<br />
My head began to clear as I reached the Ferry landing. It was then that a woman screamed and pointed at me that I got my first rational thought in thirty minutes. As she pointed two strong men grabbed me and hustled me off the boardwalk and into a building.<br />
<br />
Once just inside the one man stepped to the shop owner as said something I could not understand. In fact everybody was talking a different language now and it was all jibberish to me.<br />
<br />
The shop owner came over and with a calm demeanor pushed the man holding me out the door and turned to look at me.  I must have been some sight as standing there drenched in sweat and drunk too boot.<br />
<br />
He motioned me to come in and to sit on a bench to the rear of the store. As I continued to breathe heavy I'd let out a ragged sigh from time to time. I watched as he made a drink from green glass jars which decorated the place from ceiling to floor. The quiet of the store made me more calm as if then hickups began and the ragged exhaling sounded like a braying of some jackass.  I would feel embarressed when I spouted out but the man just gazed at me and smiled.<br />
<br />
Several minutes had passed when he stepped closer to me and was then much more in focus. He handed me a glass mason jar with a blue liquid which I was of hope would rid me of the booze and bring the fuzzyness out of my thinking.<br />
<br />
As I tipped the jar up and drank the sight of the sign above his loft came into view, Island Apothacary.  I knew I was in the right place now he was a drugest and could help me if anyone could.<br />
<br />
The blue liquid gone down the hatch I wiped my mouth and got the scare of a lifetime. The warm day had suggest short sleve shirts and cutoof pants to keep cool during my adventure. The sight of my forearm and the thick covering of light broan hair told me that donkey headed man was soon to get a new friend.<br />
<br />
I jumped to my feet in obvious surprise only to fall backwards onto the bench with a thud. My mouth tried to form words as I searched my attled brain for the right word to scream. Yet nothing, no words, I strained to speak my terror to the shop owner even if I could not understand him he might see my problem.<br />
<br />
A soft hand touched my now burning skin. A friendly smile as he did his best to comfort me in this time of fear. I sat looking down at those legs which carried me here as they too were hairy to almost furry and seemed bent somehow wrong.<br />
<br />
My shoes lay torn at the ends near to the counter and I don't remember kicking they off. My shorts were so tight around my thighs as I began to struggle with the snap and zipper in hope of relieving the stress. It was then another man dressed in coveralls and walking in cowboy boots stepped close. I was so involved with my agony and pains that it gave little notice of the thing he slipped over my head.<br />
<br />
The men quickly shook hands as though good friends when they helped me to stand. I suddenly looked down on them as if they had gotten smaller somehow, but then my balance was not too good and I fell face first toward the floor.<br />
<br />
A scream of terror for falling issued as that hickupping ragged exhale which made the men laugh. I stood now looking up at the men as my hands touched the floor. <br />
<br />
Odd it was as I stood on hands and feet bent over and yet feeling very natural in this cockeyed stance. Looking up the men made no atempt to pull me up to stand erect, but instead the man in coveralls attached a clip and leather strap to the thing he'd put on my head and began to pull me along.<br />
<br />
I held back as the desire to stand up correctly as a man should and go if I must with him to wherever. He gave me more tugs on the lead and the other man shoved my butt out a side door and into a dark alley. <br />
<br />
Humiliated I walked slowly in the darkness till we popped out into the dim gas lights along a ole' Western type street. As we walk for some stupid reason down the middle of the street I looked from side to side at people milling about. Carzy I thought that nobody looks at a drunk walking on feet and hands along the middle of the street.<br />
<br />
Worse that that I had been stripped naked by my expanding shorts and this too should have made me feel embarressed as well. Yet the cool evening breeze tickled the furry hairs and gave a strange and easy comfort as I walked.<br />
<br />
Whether the booze, blue liquid from the Apothacary or the freshening breeze I had to take a leak and soon!  Thw walk had continued past the point of a dam bursting urge which I could no longer deny. I stopped and looked up at the man leading me along feeling so in need I just didn't care who saw me do it.<br />
<br />
Strange is a word and a half word as a sensual feeling of my penis getting ready for a release of the flood. It felt like an almost crakling feeling as the thick skin of my foreskin released the penis to lengthen and seemly fall toward the ground. I thought as I stood not trying too look at it that I didn't have a foreskin since birth. Yet it was as I felt and the penis swung down and a wild sensual delight, a pride in my maleness came as a rush into my thoughts. The stream began to flow but it must have been a gallon as I felt the urine splashing into the dirt street and jumping onto my legs. I didn't care of even that as the feeling of the penis was so intense an aroused delight.<br />
<br />
The man ahaed of me stood calmly and looked at my actions. I turned as another man walked close by leading a donkey. A sniff of the air and a rich scent of masky odor touch my nostrils. I turned to catch a quick sniff of the Donkey's rump as it passed. Oh the sudden desire of wanting sex and with an animal to yet, I was drunk!<br />
<br />
I stood with her smell running circles in my brain as I felt the most massive hard on I'd ever felt. It was like a steel rod swaying below my belly. I tensed it and swinging up the massive thing bumped my furry belly sending waves of sensual pleasure into my groin.<br />
<br />
A chruning feeling in my groin made me feel as if my balls were about to explode. The senssation of a load of semen forcing it's way down the shaft made me shiver with wild delights. The spewing load covered my belly and legs!<br />
<br />
Legs, I looked down I had sicky white semen clinging to forelegs of a DONKEY!</p>
