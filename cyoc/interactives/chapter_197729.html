<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With a snap of his fingers, Darren now transformed Aboliths clothing. The elf assassin blinked, thankful that her clothes at least fit her yet still only 13 years of age.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to gather my strength,&quot; Darren sighed. &quot;Ageing you down took alot out of me. Why don&#39;t you talk with them first? I&#39;ll change you back in a little while.&quot; Abolith sighed, nodding in agreement. At least she wouldn&#39;t be stuck like this. Turning she now narrowed her eyes, gazing at the teenage prodigies. &quot;Can we find someone more private,&quot; she asked. &quot;Id rather not have Raiden see me like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My basement is a rec room,&quot; Hannah offered. &quot;Why don&#39;t you head down there.&quot; Abolith and the prodigies nodded, making their way downstairs. As they descended into the basement tbe group were pleasantly surprised by Hannah&#39;s rec room. Fully carpeted with a couple couches, the basement appeared quite comfortable for a group of teens to pass the time. Abolith now sat with her back against the wall, finding a comfortable spot on the floor.. What was less comfortable was the questions she was now peppered with.<br />
<br />
Abolith would certainly say that the group of teen teachers were quite inquisitive. The teenage prodigies now peppered the grown down assassin with questions, almost to the point of interrogation. How old was she? How long had she been an assassin? Who taught her to fight? Why was Darren so nervous around her? For her part Abolith answerd, her head feeling as if it was spinning. Taking a deep breath, Abolith now hoped she had quenched the teens curiosity, only to have Stella approach.<br />
<br />
Stella now studied the teenage girl in front of her. The raven haired guidance counselor, sitting down crossed legged as she gazed into Aboliths eyes. Abolith now cast the girl a befuddled look, wondering what she was thinking.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was your childhood like?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My childhood,&quot; Abolith stammered, somewhat confused by the question. Stella simply nodded, drawing a groan from her friends. &quot;Ugh not again,&quot; Pam moaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;What,&quot; Abolith asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stella&#39;s trying to psychoanalysis you,&quot; she sighed. Pam now glared at her friend in annoyance. &quot;You know just because you have a Masters in psychology, doesn&#39;t mean you have some super secret insight into what makes people tick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just curious,&quot; Stella responded. &quot;I mean from what Abby is telling us she&#39;s been a warrior for 600 years. I just want to know what her life was like before that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just as I&#39;d like to know why you called me Abby,&quot; Abolith grumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seems more age appropriate,&quot; Stella shrugged. &quot;So tell me, what was your childhood like?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was fine,&quot; Abolith stated. &quot;I grew up with my family in the woods. Like I said elves mature in very much the same way as humans. Our ageing just slows when we reach maturity.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And your parents,&quot; Stella asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Were parents,&quot; Abolith exclaimed. &quot;I fail to see how my parents have anything to do with anything.&quot; Stella nodded, grabbing a notepad as she began to jot down some observations. Abolith now fidgeted slightly, what was this girl doing?<br />
<br />
&quot;The reason I ask,&quot; Stella stated as she now looked straight into Aboliths eyes. &quot;Is because of what I&#39;ve seen with Raiden.&quot; At the mention of her son, Abolith now seemed to tense, Stella noting the skinny elven teenagers body seeming to coil as if to strike. Stella simply gave Abolith a warm smile as she continued to talk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Raiden from what I&#39;ve seen is a very polite, very kind, very shy boy,&quot; she said. &quot;For someone who has a history of violence I&#39;m surprised to see that just how sweet natured he is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love my son,&quot; Abolith said. &quot;I would never hurt him, I want him to be safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sheltered,&quot; Stella corrected. &quot;You shelter him. Its not necessarily a bad thing. But I wonder, why is it you are so protective of him. I have a theory your parents either didn&#39;t protect you or emotionally abused you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abolith laughed at the idea, her parents were far from abusive. Thinking back, she recalled that they were well meaning, perhaps a bit emotionally distant. That was to be expected though. Elven emotions were more muted than humans. She also happened to grow up nearly 880 years ago when parental love was far less &quot;touchy feely&quot; than the parenting of today.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re way off,&quot; Abolith chuckled. &quot;My parents have very little to do with how I raise my son.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its something though,&quot; Stella stated. &quot;Why are you both callous in regards to life yet so protective at the same time?&quot;<br />
<br />
Abolith sighed, she knew why, she just hated bringing it up. &quot;I was a slave,&quot; she sighed sadly. The teens gasping in shock at this revelation. &quot;I was young,&quot; she paused, looking over her youthful body before continuing. &quot;Not this young but young by elven standards. I was barely 200 years old, which for elves is hardly an adult. More like the equivalent of a 20 year old by human standards.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I had no idea,&quot; Stella gasped. &quot;How did it happen?&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was captured by my people,&quot; Abolith said sadly. &quot;Sold to humans for next to nothing.&quot; Abolith paused, lowering her head as she took a deep breath. She did not want to go into the gory details of her ordeal due to the age of the teachers. Glancing up at Stella though, she realized she didn&#39;t need too. The raven haired girl, seemed to already have an inkling of what happen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Since that time I have never trusted humans or elves,&quot; Abolith stated. &quot;I felt betrayed, alone. The only one that seemed to care for me was my beloved. We both felt betrayed, we both distrusted humans. Naturally we both have fought them ever since.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stella nodded, rubbing her chin thoughtfully as she gazed at the girl. &quot;Yet your &quot;beloved&quot; doesn&#39;t hate elves, you do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For obvious reasons,&quot; Abolith grumbled. &quot;They sold me into slavery!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And your parents never tried to find you,&quot; Stella finished. &quot;You may not realize it but its affected how you&#39;ve raised Raiden. Yeah your people screwed you over but what was worse from a psychological standpoint is your parents never came looking for you. It was a double whammy so to speak. You felt betrayed by your people and your parents.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abolith raised an eyebrow, she understood what the girl was saying, she just thought it to be alot of nonsense. She hadn&#39;t been angry at her parents, had she? <br />
<br />
&quot;Its also why you don&#39;t trust Darren or the others,&quot; Stella continued. &quot;You were betrayed by those closest to you. You have issues with trust.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I trust Fukushu,&quot; Abokith stated quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because he rescued you,&quot; Stella said. &quot;Which is also interesting psychologically. Falling in love with your savior and having his child.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abolith now gave Stella a befuddled look. This girls analysis was hitting a little too close to hom, making the elf fidget nervously. Part of her wanted to punch the girl in the face, the other part wanted to give her a hug. Stella now leaned over, startling the elf. &quot;What are you doing?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Giving you a hug,&quot; Stella smiled. Abolith fidgeted awkwardly as the girl squeezed her tightly. &quot;Its okay to trust people. You don&#39;t have to shut yourself off completely.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abolith had no response, simply giving the raven haired girl a puzzled look. &quot;Um thanks,&quot; she mumbled. <br />
<br />
&quot;So is that how your going to earn your doctorate Stella,&quot; Gail teased. Stella blushed, drawinga chorus of snickers from her friends. &quot;Hey I&#39;m just trying to help Abby here okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the teens now began to talk, Abolith studied this girl carefully. These prodigies were certainly odd, yet perhaps she could learn to trust them. Just so long as she stopped calling her Abby.</p>
