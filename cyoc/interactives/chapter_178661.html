<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Beginning through this story from then on the morphed Roy will refer to herself as Sarah and the old Sarah Roy just to keep track of the characters more easily.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Very angry and still in a state of shock Roy stomped her right foot on the floor in rage pursed her lips and bunched her fists in a unintentional feminine pose that would prove to anyone around her that she was a girl having a moment. “I will not be turned into a someones sex object and not have the last word” stammered Roy as she took another deep breath and let out the air through her red lipstick smothered lips in a way that forced the airflow upward causing some strands of hair to fall down and be  waved in a way that would make any man notice if they had been there. Knowing that Sarah sometimes  left changes of her clothes over at the apartment Roy spotted Sarah’s gym bag over on one of the stools at the counter and wobbled over to it. Unzipping the bag Roy found exactly what she was looking for a pair of  panties, jeans, a bra, t-shirt, socks and tennis shoes. Taking the bag and going into the bathroom Roy quickly got out of the ridiculous outfit that she was wearing just with extra difficulty from the double bikini straps around her breasts and how they were so tight that the breasts refused to break free. Roy quickly got to work putting on the outfit from the gym bag. Roy of course wanted to spend more time admiring Sarah’s body especially how well endowed she was in the upper body department but she also knew that she needed to get back to her real body and that meant changing into clothes more suited for chasing down Sarah and that was the priority.<br />
<br />
The bra was again one of the most aggravating devices Roy ever fumbled with. Five different attempts to put it on only successfully ended after she put it on backwards and fastened the straps together before turning it around and nestling the breasts in the cups individually. Along with the panties, and quickly pulling up the skin tight denim jeans, followed by the white t-shirt, white socks, and tying her shoelaces on the tennis shoes Roy stood up in front of the full length mirror on the backside of the bathroom door taking the sunglasses off her head in the process and tossing them before looking on in triumph. Only triumph is not what Roy thought or felt when he looked in the mirror. Yelping in fear and throwing both hands up to her mouth Roy didn’t see the ordinary denim look on her body instead she saw the same bikini shrine-maiden outfit she had on before with all the trim and toppings including the recently discarded sunglasses now sitting back on her forehead. Still in her first breath of shock Roy all of a sudden in a process that took only seconds felt her clothes shifting around on her body on their own accord as her body shifted up slightly and then leaned forward her feet coming to rest in heels once again. Most of the clothes felt like they had left her body and that familiar near naked feeling returned to haunt Roy as she looked down and saw that she was indeed back in the bikini costume much to her dismay. Looking at the clothes stuffed in the gym bag Roy was shocked to see that they had morphed back to the outfit Sarah had originally been wearing when she arrived at the apartment that morning a light blue-long sleeve blouse, blue sweater, black slacks, dark nylon socks, and  brown heeled shoes.<br />
<br />
Quickly getting a hold of herself Roy stopped panting and looked at this situation critically. “That device must have made it so that I have to conform to that picture in the photo album no matter what” she thought with an added shiver. Roy knew at this point that she wasn’t going to be catching up with Sarah in this outfit anytime soon and her best bet would be to try and live her life until she could get her hands back on the remote. Looking deeply into the mirror Roy knew that this dilemma also left her with no other choice as well, she would have to start referring to herself as Sarah Howard and the other Sarah as Roy Milford. Knowing it was the only way to avoid confusion in her day to day life Roy also knew that it was the only way until she turned back. Keeping her eyes focused on her face Roy began repeating to herself in varying speeds “I AM SARAH HOWARD” over and over again in what seemed like fifty times and until she felt that the name came easily to her and the fact that her sense of self to the reflection in the mirror held true.<br />
<br />
Just as she was backing away from the sink having completed her ritual. Sarah heard a knock on the door which she opened to find Jack in his boxers and a tank top looking groggily at her. “Sarah baby I heard you talking in the bathroom and I wanted to make sure you were OK.” putting up her best pout voice to Jack’s question Sarah responded “oh baby you cared about me that’s so sweet. I’m fine but I need you to answer a question about me no matter how crazy it sounds OK? what am I wearing right now? Looking over your body in a canvasing motion with his eyes Jack quickly looked back up at your face and said “sure baby anything for you your wearing the type of outfit I see you coming over here a lot in and on your days off. That body of yours is sporting a white strap bikini with cut-off robe sleeves, long white stockings, and some red wedge high heels.” Sarah was taken aback by his revelation that she wore this outfit all the time and that it looked completely normal to him. Then she had another idea. Sarah begged Jack to stay right where he stood for one more question as she closed the door and quickly changed back into her work clothes from before.<br />
<br />
Before opening the door Sarah allowed the familiar changes to take place as her clothes morphed back into the shrine-maiden bikini. Opening the door again and fixing her sunglasses over her eyes Sarah then asked Jack again what she was wearing “baby are you sure you’re OK?” he said with obvious concern. Sarah profusely reassured him that she was fine so he continued “baby your now wearing your everyday work clothes for your job at the library. A white strap bikini with cut-off robe sleeves, long white stockings, and some red wedge high heels. Baby what’s going on?” Sarah didn’t answer him she was too lost in thought “This is too weird she pondered.”</p>
