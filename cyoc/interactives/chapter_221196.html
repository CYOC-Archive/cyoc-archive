<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">All three were frightened beyond believe. Mike, because his bully-victims little brother seemed to have a power he couldn´t explain, and Dean and Thomas, because three of their friends had been reduced to a little boy or puppies. And by how unaffected Jeff watched, at least to the outside view beside the disgust, he had also been changed somehow, even if he looked normal.<br />
Jeff was mentally cursing Jared, while also crying about losing his friends to his brother in such a way. It was clear to him that Jared had been envious of him and his friends, and with the given power of the chronivac, he had simply taken them for himself.<br />
While Todd cuddled with his puppy Colin, Jared petted Dennis while grinning at the three remaining teens. That would be fun to watch. “Now that I have my little puppy, along with one for my best friend, there isn´t much left I would need.” He took a meaningful gaze down his body, used the same towards Todd and nodded over to his brother. “But I think it will get chilly if we run around naked for too long. Dean, as you choose Jeff before, who was only a placeholder for myself, you will become my new clothes. Thomas will become Todd´s, as he had chosen him over Jeff. Finally, Mike, as you have been bullying Jeff for a long time, you will become his new outfit. But first, you will all strip naked, as your own clothes won´t be needed by you anymore and would be in the way.”<br />
All three widened their eyes in fear. And all three thought “I will become clothes?”, only adding each of their future wearers afterwards, slightly panicking. But they couldn´t stop themselves from striping, throwing them on the ground like it was nothing. Afterwards, each of them stepped over to their new “wearer” before the changes started.<br />
Other than Chris before, unknown to the three teens and Todd, they didn´t merge to their new wearer. Instead, their bodies changed into the clothes in the way Jared had planned.<br />
Thomas and Dean changed in similar ways, as their end-result would be near identical. Their hands fell off first, the fingers merging into each other into a formless blob. But it was apparent to anyone watching what the hands were becoming quickly. It was socks, each hand was a sock. Skin turned into black cotton, while it hollowed out right where it had landed.<br />
The other part simply dropping off were their cocks and balls. On the ground, the cock got longer and flatter, skin turning into black leather, while the balls turned metallic, and reformed into a silver buckle. The only thing from their cock not turning leather had been the cockhead, which also turned silver metallic, into a pin for the buckle. Their genitals had become a belt.<br />
The rest of their body remained standing, even as the changes separated it for different clothes. Their feet become harder leather, their soles the hardest part. The upper side ripped open to the sides, leaving behind a rag of skin in the middle. Said rag become a shoes tongue, slightly overlapped by the sides. The bones and flesh inside their feet loosened into the laces soon being pulled through the overlaps, enclosing the tongue inside. With the form finished, the outside turned dark blue, the sole turned dark brown, and the rim alongside the inside become a dark green.<br />
Their legs and empty crotches turned brown as well, the legs also shortening. While it hollowed out, their skin turned to fabric like jeans, but the result were brown shorts.<br />
Above, their body, from stomach up to the neck, and down the arms, also hollowed out. With the arms growing shorter, the skin turning dark blue, and all the new rims gained a black border. Their upper body had become a shirt each.<br />
The final body part to change were their heads. Their horrified looks slowly washed out into nothing, as their faces melted away. Hair vanished into the skin, before a big hole formed on top of their heads. The place where their necks had been, and their wide-open mouths, which slipped down to the side, formed the lower holes. As their heads emptied out, the skin turned into a light grey colored cloth, and soon what had been heads were a pair of boxers each.<br />
With their changes finished, the bodies of cloth collapsed into each other, leaving a pile of clothes laying where the two teens had stood before.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Mike changed in similar ways, but not exactly. His tongue had jumped out of his mouth and dropped together with his hands and cock, hollowing out. It became a silver metallic tube-like object, and Jeff could identify it, mentally screaming. Mike´s tongue had become a cock-cage. Mike´s front teeth had also fallen out by now, merging into a small key, fitting to the cage. <br />
Instead of shortening, both arms and legs separated into an additional part. While Jeff would wear jeans instead of shorts, the parts separated hollowed into tubes as well, only with an opening to the side. On each formed a small ring of metal, and the skin turned leather. From the shins and the fore-arms had formed bracer-like, brown brackets, with the metallic ring being a fixture to lay the wearer in chains. It seemed Jared´s intend affected the clothes, and his intend was following Jeff´s former statement of himself being a slave to his brother.<br />
A quite similar change had happened to Mike´s neck, ending up a brown collar. The rest had been similar to Thomas and Dean. The jeans were dark-blue, the shoes and shirt black, and the socks and underwear white.<br />
Jared smiled satisfied down at his new clothes before jumping down, quickly dressing in them. Dean could taste Jared´s cock and balls, and feel his feet in his hands. Jared felt comfortable in his new clothes, while Dean mentally gagged.<br />
Todd stared wide-eyed at his new clothes along with his friend, who had just dressed. “But… what did you do to the guys? How are they clothes now?” he asked, confused as to what happened.<br />
Jared lifted Todd´s new clothes up to his bed. “Silly Todd. What guys do you mean? There wasn´t anybody here beside us and Jeff, right? And he had them placed on my bed while you had dossed off, you just didn´t notice them before. You were to distracted cuddling with Colin after you got him. But don´t you recognize your own clothes, Todd?” he explained.<br />
Todd nodded, accepting the “truth”, before hitting himself. “You are right, sorry. Maybe I´m still a bit tired.” He slowly placed Colin on the ground and moved over to put on “his” clothes. He looked like a smaller twin of Jared in them. While he also thought them comfortable, Thomas was disgusted by having his cock on his face. <br />
Jeff still stood in the corner, waiting for a new order. When Todd moved to the bathroom, Jared turned to Jeff. “You can put your new clothes on, and then sort these clothes out. And you won´t remove your new clothes, or better yet, your uniform, without my permission. Right, slave?”<br />
Jeff mentally cursed his brother again, while his body started to put on Mike. The cage was rather small, just fitting around his cock, which was luckily not erect right now. But if it ever tried to, it would be painful. Mike gagged, feeling the cock on and all over his tongue, tasting it.<br />
Jeff fixed the brackets on his legs next, then on his arms. With the restricting gear mostly in place, Jeff put on the boxers, socks, jeans, and shirt. He tied his shoes, wrapped the belt into the jeans and wound the collar in place, finishing his new outfit. Mike was cursing Jeff by now, around the gagging.<br />
Just when Todd returned, Jared establishing a mental connection between Mike´s, Thomas´s, Dean´s, Colin´s, Dennis´s and Todd´s old selves. They were all still there, trapped in their own bodies, able to use all their senses, but with no control over themselves. With a grin, he also made Jeff part of the group chat on their mental connection. It would be his way to talk to them if he ever wanted to. <br />
Todd made his way to his seat, quickly returning to cuddling with little Colin. It seemed Todd had been shy around that age. But it didn´t take long for him and Jared to go walkies with their little pups.<br />
Jeff collected the left behind clothes, searched the pockets before throwing them into the bags with his own clothes. After checking on baby Jeremy, who was still asleep, Jeff went out to bring the bags to the recycling bank.<br />
On the mental level, Mike, Thomas, and Dean were mostly gagging at their predicament, Colin and Dennis were trying to see something positive in being dogs, and Todd was still unbelieving, thinking this all must be a nightmare. Jeff, when he finally made himself known, was mostly apologizing, as he saw no reason to hide that Jared´s power was given to him by his computer program, only he used it against them all.<br />
“So, it´s your fault, asshole?” Mike screamed at him, but the rest defended him. They knew Jeff enough to know he wasn´t lying, and he said that Jared had slipped into his room while he was on the phone with Todd. And Todd said Jeff suddenly had to go, which resulted in Jeff explaining what happened after that, as well.<br />
“Okay, I get why he was an ass to your older brother, but what has his friend done to him?” Colin asked.<br />
“The same as you, I guess. Jared was at least envious of my friendship with Todd, and ordered him over. Chris was just there, and Jared added him into his plan, just like the rest of you.” Jeff explained his own understanding of the situation.</p>
