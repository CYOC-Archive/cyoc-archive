<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With the Dan/you zentai drone still powering the room via treadmill. Your mind in sync with Dan, you physically moan as Dan&#39;s spandex bulge just bouncing as your view shakes up and down. You feel content this way, while serving your drone owner, Rick. You can also sense Dan&#39;s desire too, the soles of his feet hitting the treads as he jogs, walks, or runs and the desire to obey Rick. You want to as well, but again, you serve better for your owner to be a happy bulge swelling and shrinking while bouncing as your drone host(?) move. Rick receives a call from his best friend and picks up the phone. Rick answers, &quot;Hey Jeff.&quot; Jeff replies back, &quot;Hey Rick. I just want to say, I&#39;ve decided to be your zentai drone.&quot; This caught Rick by surprise. &quot;Wait, really?&quot; Jeff, on the other side of the phone nods. &quot;Yeah, I&#39;ve always liked the fact of being a faceless drone made of spandex, and what can be better is to be a zentai drone.&quot; he says in a happy tone. Rick, considered Jeff as his best friend, he doesn&#39;t want to know how to feel about this. Jeff has been with him in his crazy mischievous plans, and even when he is down, he is there. But for Jeff to be his zentai drone owner, does seem to raise question about this. He also knows that he likes zentai suits too. &quot;Well, I don&#39;t know if I like it about you being owned by me, Jeff. I mean, it&#39;s awesome and all, it&#39;s just that...&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff hears his unsure in his voice. &quot;That what?&quot;<br />
&quot;I hate owning you as a drone. I like you as a best friend.&quot; Jeff chuckles, &quot;I know! But I want to help you that way as a zentai drone, Rick.&quot; Rick stays silent until Jeff continues, &quot;Hey. I&#39;ll be okay no matter what man. And I know you&#39;ll treat me the same even if I do become a faceless freak. You accepted me of who I am. Or what I like. So please let me grant this one request and be your zentai drone.&quot; Jeff was right. He just needs to remember that even when Jeff does become a zentai drone for him, he&#39;s still his best friend, to the end of time. &quot;Alright. I&#39;ll join you tomorrow, to watch your change and pick you up.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thank you, Rick. I&#39;ll see you tomorrow!&quot; Rick replies back, &quot;Yeah, see you tomorrow.&quot; They both hung up as Rick looks out of his bedroom window questioning the fact of Jeff being his zentai drone. Well, he better not let him wait, so he just watches TV, and eat until he is ready to go to bed...<br />
<br />
The next day, Rick gets ready to go out and meet Jeff and goes to the front door. Before leaving, he opens the door and Rick orders Dan/you, &quot;Dan, get off the treadmill, we&#39;re going out to the facility.&quot; Dan grunts in obedience and gets off the treadmill as the whole area powers down (except the fridge, gotta keep food nice and fresh when gone!) and meets Rick at the front door. After going out, locking the door, and heading down, Rick orders Dan to pick him up and jog to the facility. Your crotch view bounces as he jogs through town making their way to the facility. You moan in pleasure just bouncing makes you satisfy your host that is Dan.<br />
<br />
At the facility, Jeff waits at the entrance for Rick and sees a zentai drone jogging and carrying Rick. Jeff waves to him as Rick orders the Dan zentai drone to halt and put him down. Rick goes up to Jeff giving him a bro hug and say hi. Jeff looks at the Dan zentai drone, &quot;So, your first drone?&quot; he asks. Rick looks at him and replies. &quot;Yeah, just got him yesterday.&quot; He looks back to Jeff. &quot;Well, you ready to go buddy?&quot; Jeff nods as they go inside, the zentai drone follows. Once inside, at getting the papers from the zentai attendant, Jeff inputs his information to be transformed to a zentai drone:<br />
<br />
Application- Drone<br />
Color/pattern of spandex- Snake pattern<br />
Awareness- Yes<br />
Slight free will or individuality- Yes<br />
Hivemind- No<br />
Owner- Rick<br />
Featureless or features- Featureless<br />
Keep name after transformation?- Yes<br />
Other notes- A swelling and shrinking bulge that can adjust my sensitivity to touch and be able to let out a muffled sound of a moan or groan to either confirm or let my owner, Rick know that I have complied or enjoy it.<br />
<br />
Jeff then hands the finished papers to the attendant zentai as it checks to the information. The attendant then calls over a forest green zentai drone to escort Jeff. Jeff asks the drone, &quot;Is it okay, that my friend watches my transformation?&quot; The forest green drone replies in a monotone voice, &quot;Yes, they will be seated at the observation room. Please follow me.&quot; The three of them follow the zentai drone through a series of corridors and elevators to the transformation room. Jeff then goes inside as the drone escorting Rick and the Dan drone leads them to the observation room. Jeff then sits down on some sort of dentist chair while a bright blue zentai drone sets up the procedures on a console to his right. A mechanical arm holding some sort of spray attached to it comes down while a muscle relaxing agent was injected to him by the dentist chair he is laying on. In the observation room they found a spot to sit and waits for the change. The window soon show holographic screens of cameras pointing at Jeff and starts recording.<br />
<br />
The drone controls the arm and begins the transformation by pressing the button as the spray shoots out some sort of mist that aimed at his chest. Jeff looks down at his body as much as he can and sees his body change from flesh to snake pattern spandex. The drone continues to spray as it moved the arm down his crotch area where is member is already erect. The following trailing mist falls down as hits his skin as more and more of his flesh is converted. His erect member soon melts and merge to his balls as it forms into a snake pattern bulge. Though, you can&#39;t see it, but you can tell by your host&#39;s mind that he is getting aroused, making you swell, moan, and wriggle in pleasure to be rubbed. Dan moans to his owner to rub you. Rick, still watching lets him do it. Soon you feel a pair of blue mittens on your faceless bulge as you and Dan moan in pleasure as he rubs you and squish you trying to relieve that near release. Back to Jeff&#39;s transformation, the drone moves the arm, still spraying down to his legs and feet. The changes then follows down as more flesh turns to snake pattern spandex all the way down to his feet. Jeff can feel his toes merging and smooth away into a featureless feet like socks of snake pattern spandex. The drone then stops spraying for a moment and moves to his arms and sprays down. Already his back is turned to spandex, same pattern as his asshole was already smoothed away. The changes following down his arms to his hands, like his toes, his fingers fuse together, but leaving his paddle hands or mittens only thumbs ending with the same texture and pattern. Finally, the spray arm goes to his head, Jeff closes his eyes as he can feel the spray hitting his face. He groans as he can feel the chemicals or nanomachines change him inside out. Nose holes seal up and leave a smooth bump, his mouth and eyes seals up like a zipper leaving no trace, and his ears close in and leave a smooth flat surface on the sides of his spandex changing head and his hair sinking or falling off of his head. Finally, the changes are complete.<br />
<br />
The drone then adjust the chair up making his sit up, the paralyzing agent wears off as he moans and raises his mitten hands and flex them, same to his sock feet as they curl in unison. &lt;This is it, I&#39;m going to be Rick&#39;s drone for life... I feel so complete.&gt; Jeff says in his head letting out a moan of glee. &quot;Jeff drone, the changes are complete, but there is one thing I need to do to to complete your information inputted in your files&quot; the bright blue zentai drone said as it presses several buttons. The spray arm goes back up as another with some sort of headphones and a virtual headset is placed over his smooth and faceless head. The audio plays and strange colors show up in his visors as it creates some sort of chanting knowing that he has little free will left, he knows what he once was, and he is now, but is now a drone to serve his owner, Rick along with the other zentai drone, Dan as it repeats itself for a minute or two. The drone then stops the audio and video as the headset moves upward as it comes over and writes his name on his left sole and writes Rick&#39;s name on Jeff&#39;s right. He wriggled to the motion of it and let out a muffled giggle.<br />
<br />
The drone then faced to the one way window where Rick and Dan sit, Dan still rubbing your facless spandex bulge and says, &quot;Mr. Rick, your drone is ready to be picked up. Please come to this room.&quot; Rick nods and orders Dan to follow him, making him stop rubbing and squishing you. You wish you want it to last forever, but you know there will be more. After all, you and Dan share the same mind in someways. The snake patterned Zentai drone feels a bit wobbly and sensitive but manages to stand up straight and face Rick as he walks close to him and stands a few feet away from him. The blue drone giving him space leaves the room just outside the door waiting to escort them back to the main entrance. &quot;Jeff, you still there?&quot; Rick asks. The Jeff drone lets out a muffled grunt and a nod to know he&#39;s still somewhat himself, but now obeys him. Rick then spreads his arms wide and orders Jeff to hug him. Jeff did and wraps his spandex pattern arms around Rick as he did the same knowing he&#39;s still in there somewhere as they both let go of the hug. He then puts a hand on Jeff drone&#39;s shoulder saying, &quot;Let&#39;s go home.&quot; The words Jeff wants to hear makes him nod as they follow the drone outside, both Jeff and Dan drones, in a few inches different in height following behind Rick.<br />
<br />
Back at the apartment, to their room, Rick orders Dan drone to get back on the treadmill and continue to run. Dan grunts with glee and begins running, as you enjoy bouncing up and down as he runs on the treadmill, giving power in their room. Rick orders the Jeff drone that he can move on his own to get accompanied to his new home, before joining him on the bed to snuggle and hug by Rick. Jeff complies the order with a grunt and looks around and looks at the Dan drone running on the power generating treadmill. Already night time, Rick gets ready for bed and looks at the Jeff drone standing their waiting for another order, but his faceless head looks around aimlessly until he turned his head to Rick as he orders him, &quot;Well, don&#39;t stand there, come sleep with me. I need my best friend and drone to snuggle with me.&quot; Jeff drone nods and gets on the bed, no need to worry about getting hot or cold, is laying next to Rick, his best friend and owner. Next thing Jeff feels is his bulge being circled to heighten his sensitivity of touch as he sees a gentle smile on Rick&#39;s face. &quot;Hope you don&#39;t mind me doing that, buddy.&quot; Jeff drone shook his head confirming he likes it as he moans in pleasure as Rick snuggles and plays a little footsie with Jeff&#39;s zentai sock feet until Rick falls asleep. &quot;Good night buddy, we got a new day tomorrow.&quot;</p>
