<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Milo hugged William as he stepped into the dorm. &quot;Are you sure you two don&#39;t mind?&quot; He knew William didn&#39;t he had memories of them sharing a room for seventeen years, it was more to Guy he directed the question.<br />
<br />
&quot;As long as it is just a couple nights.&quot; The lynx said with a smile that turned to a grunt as William elbowed him in the ribs. He then whispered something into the feline&#39;s ear that had his ears quivering and his tail lashing. &quot;As long as you need I mean.&quot; And Guy did sound like he meant it, which made Milo wonder just what his brother had promised.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you mind if I take a shower real quick?&quot; Milo hadn&#39;t had one since Dare&#39;s stunt, and despite his best efforts, he just didn&#39;t feel clean yet. The two older guys exchanged looks as if they knew exactly what he wanted to do in the shower. He dug out his towel and his toiletries, trying to ignore the looks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Down at the end of the hall.&quot; William replied, a touch, too sweetly. He also had memories of his brother walking in on him, and vice versa. Things got complicated with two teenaged guys in one room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, try this. Trust me.&quot; And Guy slipped something into Milo&#39;s toiletry bag with a wink. Milo tried not to stare. He wasn&#39;t going to manage one night with these two, much less a few. <br />
<br />
He quickly stripped down to his boxers, tossed his towel over his shoulder, and grabbed his kit. He did hear a soft, &quot;If you keep staring at my brother like that I might get jealous.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a apologetic, &quot;Just want to know what to expect.&quot; Added in Guy&#39;s accent.<br />
<br />
Milo could feel himself blushing, but managed to cool himself down by the time he got to the showers. He got a few odd looks as he walked, almost everyone here was completely an anthro, but he doubted any of his brother&#39;s floormates wouldn&#39;t be able to place him, and dorm crashing wasn&#39;t forbidden as long as it wasn&#39;t long term. At least the bathroom was pretty much the same, he noted as he slipped out of his boxers and into the shower.<br />
<br />
He flicked on the water and waited for it to warm up before stepping under it. He wasn&#39;t alone, but thank god this school believed in privacy stalls. He could hear exactly what that other guy was doing, he could smell it. Privacy was a weird thing in this world. He dug inside his bag to pull out his shampoo and instead pulled out the bottle Guy had tucked in there. Milo almost laughed. <i>Warming and tingling, fresh fruity aroma.</i> Lube, probably the last thing he needed at the moment. He flipped the top open and sniffed. Strawberries. Guy didn&#39;t know about Dare&#39;s favorite fruit, did he? Just had to be coincidence. But that scent got him rock hard in a moment as it brought Dare right to mind.<br />
<br />
Even now, angry as he was at the skunk he couldn&#39;t stop thinking about him, about wanting to bury his nose in that soft fur. He poured some of the lube into his hand and wrapped it around his cock as he leaned back against the shower wall, water hitting the top of his scalp and running down him in rivulets. It followed the curves of muscles he never actually earned, despite memories of playing in a rugby league.<br />
<br />
He felt something heavy between his legs, tugging down but paid it little attention, even as the swollen orbs brushed up against his thighs. It did feel warm on his cock, and in his hands, almost as warm as it was when Dare had his.. No.. focus on you. He stroked himself softly as the scent of strawberries mingled in the air with his own aroused musk. Maybe the lube was too much, it felt like his cock kept slipping and twisting in his hand, it felt so good but it was a different game just keeping his stroking going.<br />
<br />
Eventually it started feeling so strange he looked down, gulping as he saw what his cock was becoming. It had twisted around, he could even slide his fingers between the twists, which was a whole new level of feeling that made him gasp softly. The tip of his cock slowly narrowed to a point, the last bit to reshape itself.<br />
<br />
<i>That stupid skunk. Making me do this. He should be doing this. Better, he should be spreading his legs..</i> Milo gave a snort and came. It was nothing like he had ever experienced before. He was used to quick nd furtive sessions in the few minutes you could get the bathroom to himself. Now he understood why he had so many memories of he and his brother walking in on each other. He came, and it didn&#39;t seem to stop. Those large balls he had grown first churning out an eruption of sticky, musky seed over his hand and down his thigh. His muscles strained, his still human toes curling under him as he leaned back more to keep himself up than to relax. That orgasm thrummed though him for what felt like well over a minute before dying away, leaving quite the mess on the shower floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit.&quot; Came whispered from one of the other shower stalls. Milo had to agree, and thanked whatever was watching over him his legs hadn&#39;t furred out yet. It still took a bit to clean himself off, and as his cock softened it untwisted, sliding into its new sheath. HE could already hear Dare&#39;s comments about Swiss army dicks and corkscrews. He finally felt clean enough to towel off and step out of the shower. A ferret was eyeing him from where he was standing in one of the fur dryers, and Milo could only offer a sheepish grin in return.<br />
<br />
He quickly headed out of the bathroom. That slinky rat did not have to lick his lips quite so obviously, the perv. Milo stepped back into the dorm to William reading through the rules to a board game as Guy set it up. &quot;We&#39;re going to try this weird war game Guy likes, want in?&quot;<br />
<br />
Guy was not very subtle in sniffing the air, and that strawberry scent wasn&#39;t completely hidden by the smell of his shampoo. Milo almost wanted to wipe that grin off Guy&#39;s face. Almost. All in all, he thought he liked the feline, and his brother seemed smitten, so that was enough. &quot;Sure, but I get green.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s always loved green.&quot; William said in an annoyed tone to Guy, then a teasing smile. &quot;A green pair of eyes more than anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bite me.&quot; Milo replied, but he felt himself relaxing around the two. Maybe being away for a bit would be good.</p>
