<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Deciding for the moment, that maybe she was happy with her size (for now) - she really had to talk through these changes with someone. But first thing was first - this...bra... was... killing her - and making her horny, so it had to go. She reached around and started unhooking the four hooks built into the strap. As she undid the second, she heard a creak, then the remaining two hooks straightened flat from the combined strain, and the bra flew off her chest, onto the bed, landing on her cock - her breasts settling heavily low on her ribcage and wobbling back and forth for several seconds. Nipples tracing lazy figure 8&#39;s in the air a good ten inches in front of her.<br />
<br />
She almost came again from this demonstration of the power of her huge breasts, and she had to work to calm herself down as more blood rushed into her enormous cock (which thankfully seemed to not be growing any more, and maybe had settled back down to somewhere in the two foot range.<br />
<br />
She thought about her best college friend, Jane - they had played around with a little sexy time before, and had remained close ever since. She also recalled hearing her brag about some huge stud she&#39;d fucked in college - and well, the temptation to revisit both aspects was just too good to pass up. She got up from the bed, wobbling more than a little as she adjusted to her new (and equally wobbly) center of gravity and walked over to get her phone from the dresser. Staying on task as best she could, with the glimpses of her unbelievable body in the mirror next to her - she sent a quick text to Jane. <br />
<br />
&quot;Something important to share with you. Big developments. Come quickly, bring overnight bag.&quot;<br />
<br />
Smiling to herself as she waited for a response, she decided to look at herself in the mirror and face the music. She started from the ground up - her feet, perfect as before moved into well shaped ankles and calves - maybe better shaped than before, she couldn&#39;t be sure. Halfway down her calf, the tip of her beautiful cock swayed - prettier than most men&#39;s cocks it tapered neatly before flaring out in a gorgeous mushroom shaped head as big as a tennis ball - with a dime sized slit still dribbling pre-cum from her intense horniness. Reaching down to scoop a bit onto her finger, she brought it to her lips and tasted it. Delicious, and predictably, her breasts tingled intensely again. She&#39;d have to be careful about that or she&#39;d end up with breasts too big to move herself unaided (that thought causing her cock to thicken and twitch, and pulse out more pre into a puddle on the floor). &quot;Down boy, easy big fella...&quot; she mumbled to herself as she continued her visual tour of her new body. <br />
<br />
Following the rest of her unbelievable cock up alongside her muscular thighs, she found her goose egg sized balls gathered in a neat hairless sack, resting just above her still drooling pussy. She&#39;d nearly forgotten that was still an option in all the new sex organ goodness. Her trim waist and navel were unchanged except for the shadow cast over them by the enormous outswelling of her huge new tits. Swinging just below her lowest ribs, they were wider than she was by several inches on each side - her nipples too had grown slightly, deepening in color, and now seemed permanently erect. With her arms at her side, she couldn&#39;t even see her elbows, and she turned around to look over her shoulder and see if she could see her tits from behind. The view was stunning. Not only had her ass tightened into a perfect heart, her tits were clearly visible on either side of her, and if she pressed them against herself she showed more tit from the back than most girls ever could from the front. <br />
<br />
Turning back to face the mirror she noticed that the skin around her biceps and triceps had toned up a bit, and she was showing a bit more muscle than she remembered. Her neck too had tightened up and even her face had changed slightly. Her nose a bit perkier, cheeks slightly better defined, lips definitely plumper. This had to be magic. And it was turning her on. She reached down and tweaked her bigger nipples, pulling them, and massaging the breast a bit. They felt, fuller than they had a minute ago, a bit firmer maybe. As she played with her nipples more, that feeling became more defined - her breasts seemed to be perking up more, standing out from her chest - and she could feel tiny pinpricks inside them as they swelled slowly. Her cock too was swelling as she played with her breasts, slurping more pre onto the ground as it twitched and began inching upwards.<br />
<br />
Just then her phone chirped, with a received message. <br />
<br />
&quot;On my way! Can&#39;t wait to see you. J&quot;<br />
<br />
Her breasts practically groaned with need as she held the phone, every nerve humming with anticipation. Now all she had to do was wait. And maybe try to find a shirt that fit... and holy fuck was she horny...</p>
