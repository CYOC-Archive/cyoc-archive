<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Samantha felt a rush as her mind adjusted to this new reality. The elderly Samantha and Jacob had passed away peacefully now their daughter owned their old home and was raising her family there. Sammy and Jacob now lived in the same neighborhood as Mary Elise and Katie the two teens were neighbors and had known eachother since infancy. They also happened to go to the same school as Mary Elise, Katie, and Mika. Although their future was yet to be written the ring seemed to tell Samantha that her and Jacob were destined to be together no matter what. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for this Katie,&quot; Samantha said. &quot;By the way how did you and Mary Elise do on getting your first kiss?&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie paused before answering Samantha puzzling Samantha. &quot;Why don&#39;t you talk with Mary,&quot; she said. &quot;When you come over to my house I&#39;ll tell you about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie passed the phone over to Mary Elise, confused Samantha began to worry about Katie&#39;s well being. &quot;Is everything alright over there Mary?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Things didn&#39;t go too well on our end Sammy,&quot; she said. &quot;Why don&#39;t you and Jake come on over well tell you all about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright I&#39;ll be right over,&quot; Samantha said before pausing. Samantha sighed as she realized the distance between Katie&#39;s house and the restaurant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um...Mary,&quot; Samantha said. &quot;How are we going to get over there, Jake and me are too young to drive.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary Elise laughed before answering. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about that,&quot; she laughed. &quot;Katie thought about that. Why don&#39;t you and Jake head outside, I think you&#39;ll be pleasantly surprised.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha said her good byes and went to Jake. Taking his hand in hers the two teens walked outside into the parking lot. The confused girl now glanced around wondering what Katie and Mary Elise had in store for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sammy, Jake over here.&quot; Turning towards the voice Samantha&#39;s jaw dropped. &quot;Mom?!?&quot; She exclaimed. <br />
<br />
Staring at Samantha was her mother Judy. Judy had passed away several years ago, now she was driving Jacobs car and beckoning the two teens to get in the car.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Sammy,&quot; Judy said. &quot;How was your first date.&quot; Jacob blushed deeply while Samantha continued to stare at her mother. &quot;It was good,&quot; she whispered as slid into the car. Judy smiled as the two teens buckled their seat belts. &quot;Hey.....mom,&quot; Samantha asked. &quot;Can we stop by Katie&#39;s house. I promised Mary and Katie I would see them when the date was over.&quot;<br />
<br />
Judy turned around to face her daughter and smiled. &quot;Sure sweety,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;ve been meaning to meet with Kellie for awhile, guess I get my chance.&quot;<br />
<br />
The drive to Katie&#39;s was quiet as Samantha tried to take in this new reality. Her mom Judy had not only been resurrected but had been regressed to a 38 year old woman with a 14 year old child. Samantha was happy to have her mother back, the two were very close and her death had saddened her greatly. That the ring had the power to not only resurrect the dead but return them to the prime of their lives was astounding.<br />
<br />
As the car pulled into Katie&#39;s driveway Samantha grabbed Jacobs hand and ran to the front door. Samantha was surprised to see Kellie standing at the door. Katie had obviously progressed her mothers age to make her a little older since she was now the mother of two teenage daughters. The now 38 year old woman had some fine lines around her eyes and a few stray grays in her honey colored hair. &quot;Hi Samantha,&quot; she said. &quot;We&#39;ve been expecting you. Katie and Mary Elise are waiting upstairs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha smiled and led Jacob up to Katie and Mary Elise&#39;s room. Opening the door Samantha could see the room had altered so that  it looked like a young teens. Mary Elise was standing by Katie who was looking out the window, she smiled as she saw Jacob and Samantha.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi guys,&quot; she said. &quot;So I&#39;m guessing the date when well.&quot; Jacob blushed wildly while Samantha attempted to maintain her composure. Squeezing Jacobs hand tightly Samantha found the courage to speak. &quot;It was a great first date but I&#39;m concerned about Katie is okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
The smile on Mary Elise&#39;s face faded as she looked back at her sister. &quot;Unfortunately we had a run in with a couple of bad boys,&quot; she said sadly. &quot;They got a little fresh so Katie kicked him in the groin. The guy didn&#39;t like that though so he slapped Katie in the face.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob stepped forward and looked at Katie&#39;s face. The poor girl had a welt on the right side of her face and her eyes appeared watery. &quot;I&#39;m sorry things didn&#39;t work out for you Katie,&quot; Jacob said. &quot;Unfortunately guys can be jerks sometimes, I should know... I&#39;m a guy. Don&#39;t let that jerk ruin your day though, you know me and Sammy always have your back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie smiled and gave Jacob a quick hug causing the young teen to blush slightly. Samantha&#39;s heart melted as she watched her husband now boyfriend cheer her friend up. &quot;Jake thanks for cheering Katie up,&quot; she said. &quot;Can you go get us something to drink while we have a quick girl talk.&quot;<br />
Jacob nodded and left the room. Now alone Samantha looked at her friends.<br />
<br />
&quot;So did you get back at that guy after he hit you,&quot; Samantha asked. Katie nodded and smiled weakly. &quot;Let&#39;s just say that I hope he learns some manners when he repeats preschool in a couple of weeks.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls smiled and gave eachother a hug. Samantha now sat on the floor and looked at her friends. &quot;I&#39;m still trying to take this all in,&quot; she said. &quot;Seeing my mom again kind of makes it settle in.....I really am just a kid again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad things went so well for you,&quot; Katie said. &quot;I&#39;m hoping that first kiss was worth it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha smiled and looked at Katie. &quot;Katie,&quot; she said. &quot;When you experience your first kiss it&#39;s like nothing that you can&#39;t explain and the fact that it was with Jake makes it more special.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie smiled and hugged her friend. &quot;I&#39;m so happy for you Sammy,&quot; she said. &quot;Unfortunately I don&#39;t think I&#39;m ready for that kind of thing yet. I might have the mind of a grown woman but I have the relationship experience of a kid. Tomorrow I think I&#39;m going back to being ten.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha took this knowledge in and shook her head, she knew what Mary and Katie wee going to tell her. &quot;So you guys are going to make yourselves even younger and I&#39;m guessing you want me to join you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary Elise looked at Samantha and smiled sadly. &quot;Katie&#39;s  my sister,&quot; Mary Elise said. &quot;When I wished to be a kid again I knew what I was getting into. While it would be nice to stay 14 Katie&#39;s not ready, it&#39;s something she&#39;s going to have to grow into. No amount of age magic can change that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha looked down at the floor and shrugged. Mary Elise placed her hand on her shoulder and looked Samantha in the eye. &quot;Samantha I&#39;m not going to force you to get any younger,&quot; she said. &quot;Katie and I talked about this if you want to stay 14 you can just know that we won&#39;t have the chance to grow up together, they&#39;re would be too many questions if a teenager hung out with a group ten year olds. If you and Jake want to be ten again though, we all get to grow up together and you will still end up with Jake.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha looked at her friends and nodded. &quot;So my choices are stay 14 and I become your babysitter as far as the world is concerned or become ten and grow up together with Jake by my side.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not just by your side Sammy,&quot; Mary Elise said. &quot;But as your best friend. The choice is yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha had an important decision to make now. &quot;Let me think about this...I&#39;m going to need to sleep on it.&quot;</p>
