<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff noticed that the fur was growing on his hands as he looked down to see the changes up close for the first thing he could see was his nails getting longer and sharper, becoming points while the color of each nail brightened to a solid white. By the time they sharpened into claws is where the fingers cracked and pulled in for they were becoming less dextile as the thumbs then grew while it migrated all the way up to the back, becoming almost invisible that the thumbs shifted into large feline like toes. During mid migration though that he could hear the bones cracking during the changes, but he didn&#39;t feel any pain for it only through pure enjoyment.<br />
<br />
Lifting his former hand up that Jeff could see bright red padding growing in on his palms while the fur grew not only down to his shifting hands as it was being covered completely, but up his arms to. The skin on his deformed hands then thickened as a pattern of orange and black hairs deepenedinto fur. When the changes subsided as they grew almost three times their own size, Jeff could see that his hands and arms were turned into the front legs and forepaws of a big style cat. Jeff tried to flex his kitty digits, but they were almost completely useless for he could only open and close his paws. However, he was amazed by his claws for they went in and out as he did this a couple of times.<br />
<br />
Jeff sighed, as he knew that he had lost the one impotent thing his human side has in his life for it was the use of his hands. “well, there goes my hands… Guess I won’t be using my fingers for things like writing, typing, playing sports, not even for masturbating.” he said with the aggravation in his voice that Sally giggled while watching him still change, but corrected him about his new paws being able to play sports.<br />
<br />
While the fur was moving up his arms and strengthened to fit his new body to come, they cracked and shifted into that of large feline tigers when they finally reached his elbows. Once there that Jeff continued to watch as the fur creped up his arms while his muscles contorted and grew thicker to tiger properties. Still feeling the changes up in his arms that it wasn&#39;t long for the fur started moving up to his biceps as it slowly moved went down from there.<br />
<br />
What were his human arms and hands has now become his new a pair of forearms to a big tiger that Sally looked on in delight and was surprised at the start of the change. Sally spoke with interest as she was seeing the changes from his once room chair to sit in, while still naked. &quot;Well now, it looks like the changes are starting off with your arms and moving on from there. I could already see the fur slowing spreading up your arms.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know what you mean. This is awesome! this is going to be my body, and yet it&#39;sstarting to feel unfamiliar to me. it&#39;s like it is not even my own anymore.&quot; Jeff said, feeling amused by this that he couldn&#39;t help himself by rubbing his newly found fur arms with his giant sizable paws as this gave him both pleasure and chills.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get to it. I mean, my body is now human and I’m getting the hang of it.&quot; Slly said as she signed, telling him that it was nothing for she then gasped and spotted something by pointing to it.<br />
<br />
”oh my gash, Jeff! Look at your feet! They’re starting to change now to!&quot; Sally surprisingly said out loud for Jeff felt the next change coming as he shortly looked down at his feet and saw, like his fingernails that his toenails grew pointy and sharp while slowly forming into claws.<br />
<br />
While this was happening that he could feel his heels lifting up by themselves and stretching to inhuman proportions for it was soon enough after during mid migration, his heel was high enough as his former big toe migrated to the back and almost became nonexistent. Just then that like his hands, the skin on his deformed feet soon became covered in thick deep pattern of orange and black hairs as he knew was fur. Now, what were his human feet has now become a pair of giant sizable cat feet of a tiger.<br />
<br />
With Sally looking on in delight as she was supposed to the sudden side of change that Jeff lifted up one of his tiger feet for he was marveled at the sight of his fur spreading up his legs while his muscles and bones grew and shifted into those of a tiger&#39;s proportions. By this time the fur slowly made its way up to his knees, it  began another drastic change for he could feel his bones popping and cracking as the knees themselves slowly shifted to hind legs of a strong tiger. Even though he could stand upright like a normal human that it was obvious for Jeff to remain standing as the rest of his body was still human, for now.<br />
<br />
Jeff could feel himself loosing balance abit as he turned to look at the mirror, feeling the was he&#39;s standing with his newly formed tiger like hind legs on his human body that he watched in fascination while the fur spread up to his thighs and was still watching for when the muscle mass shift into those of a tiger. With his arms, hands, and legs mostly turned into tiger limbs by now that Jeff then turned to her as the fur spread up to his hips while leaving his legs to be turned completely into tigers. It wasn&#39;t long though for jeff felt something at the base of his spine as another change took place.<br />
<br />
Jeff turned back to see what’s going on back there, giving how his lower body has changed however that it was almost impossible to find out what was going on as it itches. Guessing that it could be his tail growing in, he played along and turned his back to her as he asked Sally to see what it is. &quot;Well, do you see anything happening back there? Any changes?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally continued to just look on as she spotted something sticking out of his rear that it looked like a small nub growing out and slowly extending after each pop. As it continued to grow that a pattern of orange and black stripped hairs grew in to match this to his lower body and arms, yet seeing this while watching the show of his rear is when she smirked and told him what was happening. &quot;Well Jeff, it looks like that you&#39;re gaining yourself a new tail.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff was surprised as he looked at her while saying &#39;what?&#39;, before jumping with shock and turning his body to the side with his arms trying to grab his rope-like tail. once he did as he got a good enough look at the mirror, he was amazed to see the tail growing on his rear that the muscles and the nervous systems seem to have formed and caused the tail to swish and swing around in happiness. Indeed, Jeff did feel extremely happy as he saw that his tail was growing right before his very own eyes.<br />
<br />
“Whoa... I have a tail… this is, this is awesome!!!” Jeff said in sheer excitement as he watched his tail finished growing for it soon became a fully functional tail that any tiger would be proud of. Jeff couldn&#39;t quite help himself from shaking his hips around to see his tail being waved back and forth, and Jeff was really gleeful about it while Sally was looking on as well for she was happy to see that Jeff was getting his very oun tail.<br />
<br />
However, the fur slowly spread past his hips as it moved ferther on hid naked body. This was just the beginning as most of his body was still human while the legs, rear, and arms were that of a large feline. With that in mind, Jeff started to wonder if he&#39;ll be a good enough pet for his former pet Sally while also wondering if she made any other changes that Jeff wasn&#39;t aware of as his metamorphosis is about to reach the finish line of being what he wanted to be on changing into a tiger.</p>
