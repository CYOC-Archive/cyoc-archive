<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When the lion man -- Erick -- had released him, Johnathan had collapsed back against the wall, chest heaving, causing his strangely sensitive nipples to rub against his shirt. Staring, as his brother rammed into the furry colossus. Only to be tossed aside, the lion soon landing atop him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh...&quot; His head cleared a bit, but he couldn&#39;t believe what he was seeing. &quot;Is this... a dream?&quot; he whispered. &quot;I...&quot; He knew he should run, but... he shivered, missing the lion&#39;s warmth. Yet at the same time... &quot;Damn... why am I so... hot...?&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite the chill leaking in from the storm, Johnathan was burning up, and it wasn&#39;t just the fur that had now claimed every inch of him. His loins were pulsing with desire, and as he had watched the lion -- Erick -- hump his brother, his hands fumbled with his fly. As jeans and boxers fell, he told himself it was to relieve the heat, to release from the sweaty confines his hard... throbbing... dick...<br />
<br />
God, was he getting off on this? On watching that big, powerful stud dominate his brother? He shook his head, trying to restrain his hands. <i>He should run.</i> His brother had given him this chance. But...<br />
<br />
But <i>it&#39;s so fucking hot in here...</i> &quot;Ohhhh...&quot; He found himself undoing the buttons on his shirt, shrugging it off as his fingers brushed down over his nipples. Had they always been this... fat? So fat and sensitive -- &quot;oo-ohhh!&quot; -- and stiff. Soon there were soft, supple mounds beneath them, swelling larger. The little sparks of pleasure jumping from his chest to his groin didn&#39;t seem to offer relief, only drive him crazier with the need to be touched, to have his <i>breasts</i> fondled.<br />
<br />
And every jolt from his nipples made his cock shrink a bit more; drew his balls tighter to him. He felt the arousal building. Two new points appeared on the circuit of pleasure between chest and groin, and he moved one hand from his now C-cup breasts to tweak at the new nipples beneath them.<br />
<br />
He sagged back against the wall, eyes focused on Erick, his growling taunts coming distant to Johnathan&#39;s ears as they migrated up his head. His stomach felt so empty, hungry not for food, but for... <i>Erick.</i> That powerful male, visible now to his new, light-sensitive eyes in all his glory -- the virile black mane, the slabs of muscles across his broad back, and most importantly, the heavy balls between his massive thighs. <br />
<br />
He spread his own thighs a bit. He could smell the male too, musky and potent, as his royal fluid spread over Ryan writhing beneath him, moaning like a slut. <i>What&#39;s happening to me...?</i> Johnathon knew this was wrong. He wasn&#39;t into guys; he shouldn&#39;t feel this <i>need</i> to have that big lion cock in him!<br />
<br />
He should run! Or intervene! Not just stand there... watching his brother get fucked... <br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhh, Gooood!&quot; Johnathan&#39;s head lolled back as his manhood suddenly inverted. She slid both of her hands down her now toned, smooth-furred belly to explore her plump labia, her cute little pleasure button. She slipped a few fingers... inside... imagining how much better Erick&#39;s long, fat shaft would feel. When he fucked <i>her.</i><br />
<br />
Her scent, a lioness in heat, wrapped around her. She was ready. She had only to wait for her king to claim her.<br />
<br />
Then another female scent reached her. Ryan had succumbed -- no, Rianna; Johnny had caught the name, and that suited her big sister so much better. Erick stood up, his back flexing beautifully as he stretched; his majestic roar fluttering Johnny&#39;s stomach. Was it her turn!?<br />
<br />
<i>He&#39;s so hot... and powerful!</i> Liquid gushed over her probing fingers. She felt a new appendage switch behind her in anticipation, silky tuft brushing the hocks of her now digitigrade feet.<br />
<br />
She moved her hands back to her breasts as Erick turned to face her, pupils wide, eyelids half-shut as she moaned in need. A perfect lioness, softly furred, her formerly short blond hair now long and brown, a few shades darker than her tawny fur. Her curves generous, one round pair of DD breasts, another of modest Bs; her body narrowing down to a tight waist only to flare into equally wide hips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahahaha!&quot; boomed Erick, fierce grin showing his fangs. &quot;Good girl! All wet and ready for her king!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeeeesss! Sooo ready...&quot; Johnathan let herself eye her king&#39;s majesty for just a moment, particularly his long, heavy sceptre and royal orbs. Then she turned, bending over and bracing herself against the wall. She raised her ass and waggled her hips, imagining her big juicy buttcheeks framing her swollen, dripping pussy; and spread her legs wide, lifting her tail to the side. &quot;Please, take me Erick! I need you --&quot;<br />
<br />
Her big round ass was as alluring to Erick as a juicy peach to a man parched and starving. But he needed no encouragement to take what was his. To stride over and run his hands down her shuddering flanks, turning her desperate speech into another desperate moan.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you you&#39;d be the first!&quot; He grabbed the female&#39;s hips, aligning them before burying himself in her with one powerful thrust, drawing a half-bestial mewl from the heated lioness &quot;Oh God this feels good...&quot; he rumbled as he began to saw in and out, his rough cock dragging over Johnny&#39;s insides like his rough tongue had her mouth. Making her clench and growl in pain-laced pleasure as her insides were stimulated, burning her status as submissive female into her heated brain.<br />
<br />
He bent over her, his big padded hands moving to her breasts, squeezing first her top pair, then her lower. &quot;Better than either of my... girlfriends...&quot; He grunted, gripped her more tightly, then bite at the loose skin of her neck.<br />
<br />
~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br />
<br />
Rianna watched with a sick mixture of horror and jealousy as the mighty lion took the female that had been his bro Johnny. Watched his magnificent balls slapping her ass as he rutted her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Noooo,&quot; she moaned as her fingers darted in and out of her own pussy. The orbs on her chest grew heavier, still rounding beneath her other hand. <i>I&#39;m Ryan! I&#39;m not some... lion slut...</i> She tried to stop herself, but she couldn&#39;t help it, the male musk growing stronger in her nostrils as the beast began to rut into Johnny. If the lioness could still be called Johnny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh nooo...&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>Is that really Erick? How is that possible?</i> Ryan&#39;s mind clutched desperately at something to distract himself from the consuming lust. His eyes went to the bejewelled gold circlet shining amongst the thick black locks of the beast&#39;s mane, entangled so that it remained in place even as he plowed that pussy hard. Maybe that had --? But no, there was no way that was Erick... Erick was fit, but this big, strong, handsome stud...<br />
<br />
<i>It&#39;s no use...</i> She closed her eyes, a sob choking up from her, though even that was mixed with a groan of need. She could still feel the powerful body atop her, the warm breath on her face, his tongue in her mouth. His balls and cock rubbing away her useless manhood to make way for... <i>him.<br />
<br />
Oh God how did things go so wrong so fast!? I -- little bro -- I need --</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh...&quot; Her hips bucked as her padded fingertip brushed against the nub that had once been her penis. Her eyes snapped open as she heard Erick say that Johnny was better than his girlfriends. A strange, intense feeling stabbed her, jealousy mixed with pride that her sister was so pleasing to the male. And most of all a craving, an emptiness in her lower belly that Ryan...<br />
<br />
No... Rianna couldn&#39;t keep this up. As she looked back down at herself, she felt another sob as she accepted that she was female. Her quarterback physique had slimmed out -- she was still muscular, but lithe and feminine, not bulky. Like a swimmer or runner. Or a huntress. Her boobs were even bigger than her sister&#39;s, which was -- good. Beyond her narrow waist, her hips were also bigger. Motherly, well-padded to seductive curves that drew the eye down her legs and in to her wet flower.<br />
<br />
The lion... Erick... would want her. Johnny was hot, but she was hotter. She shuddered, licking her lips in memory of the kiss. But still, deep down, she tried to resist. She was the leader, not Erick. She was the sexiest. The horniest. The...<br />
<br />
Her gaze snapped up as Johnny&#39;s voice rose in a growly scream. &quot;Breed me,&quot; gasped Johnny. &quot;Breed me!&quot; The male atop roared through his hold on her neck. Thick white fluid began to squirt out around the base of Erick&#39;s cock.<br />
<br />
The lioness gave one last gasp as Erick pulled out and released her. She slid down the wall and rolled onto her back, her eyes taking in the beast now standing proudly above her, before reaching down to where lion seed leaked from her vagina. She collected some on her fingers, and massaged it into her belly, fantasising about what fruit the mating would bear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enjoy seeing your king in action, Rianna?&quot; Erick asked. Rianna&#39;s ears dipped in shame, but she couldn&#39;t tear her eyes from his enormous cock, dripping with his and her sister&#39;s fluids. &quot;I smell you, lioness. You need this too. So come here and get a taste!&quot;<br />
<br />
Unwilling, but unable to resist her new body&#39;s cravings, Rianna shifted onto all fours and stalked forward, feeling her four heavy breasts sway beneath her. Her equally round butt wobbled behind her as her tail flicked in excitement. <i>This is humiliating.</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Please,&quot; she pleaded as she came before Erick, getting on her knees. She managed to meet his eyes before her gaze was drawn irresistibly back to the tantalising spire before her.<br />
<br />
&quot;No need to ask,&quot; laughed Erick, hands on his hips. &quot;Clean me off, slut!&quot;<br />
<br />
That wasn&#39;t what she had been asking for, but she obeyed. The taste of the male mixed with her sister&#39;s sweet juices on her tongue, and her reluctance began to melt in her lust to be dominated. She still felt shame, but... now it was making her hotter. She nuzzled and licked his balls clean, imagining Erick pumping their contents into her, turning her into a bloated breeder, forced to carry and nurse his cubs, her old identity erased by their virile flood.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s enough,&quot; ordered Erick. He set his hands on her shoulders, pushing her away from his cock, which was now covered in saliva rather than sexual fluids -- though that was soon fixed as more pre-cum squeezed out of it. &quot;Get down, slut.&quot;<br />
<br />
She let him push her onto the floor, her boobs squishing in agonising pleasure as his weight settled atop her again. &quot;Ready to accept your place beneath me, &#39;Ryan?&#39;&quot; Erick whispered in her ear, his massive barbed length grinding between her butt cheeks, mocking her with the emphasis on her old name.<br />
<br />
No more football, no more education. No more need to think or stress or be an example. No more expectations or ambitions. Just looking good, getting fucked, and raising young for the pride.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh I need it so bad,&quot; she groaned, her sex-addled mind unable to distinguish between the king&#39;s cock and the life it promised. &quot;P-please, fuck me, Erick. Please, I...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s KING Erick to you, Rianna.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yes, King Erick,&quot; she affirmed, doing her best to push back against the heavier male, trying to tease his shaft into her waiting folds. He lifted away from her. Taking his hot, hard rod with him. &quot;I- I accept!&quot; She wailed. She pushed her rear up, questing for that cock. &quot;Ple-ease fuck me Erick, make me Rianna! Make me your breeding slut!&quot;<br />
<br />
She screamed, feeling his cock rake in her as it had in her brother. Sealing her fate as Erick&#39;s lioness. &quot;Yes&quot; after &quot;yes&quot; dripped from her panting lips, her body already starting to spasm in ecstasy.<br />
<br />
&quot;You really <i>are</i> a slut,&quot; growled Erick as he pounded her. &quot;I bet -- you&#39;ve wanted -- a REAL male in you -- all your life!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeeee-eeess!&quot; she screamed. God, those spines... they hurt but they felt so good, driving her crazy with stimulation, with a need to be PREGNANT! &quot;Fill me up! You stud! Breed me like my brother!&quot;<br />
<br />
She screamed again, orgasm ripping through her as Erick grabbed her scruff, feeling the vibrations of his orgasmic yowl as hot seed began to pump into her fertile womb.<br />
<br />
She remained collapsed on the floor, tongue lolled out and eyes rolled back, as Erick pulled out and got back on his feet.<br />
<br />
The new king smirked down at the two lionesses. His first two conquests, a fine start to his harem. His pride. He ran his fingers lightly over his cock. It had softened a bit, but it still jutted proudly from his sheath, and he was eager to put it to further use. Lions could go for hours. But while Johnny and Rianna smelled very enticing, there were still two more males here in his territory, who needed to be caught and made to serve him.</p>
