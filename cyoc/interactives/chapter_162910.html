<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Toni’s mouth was dry as she tried to process what was before her, she had 5 minutes to decide what type of monster she would spend the rest of her life as. She knew that in her recent future she was going to be a call girl, she didn’t like that but at least according to that goblin she had a chance to get her freedom after she worked it off. She didn’t like what the idea of working it off meant to her.<br />
<br />
She opened the rather large book containing all the different types of monsters/mythical creatures she could become. She wanted to be able to look at herself in the mirror and still see herself, she didn’t want scales or fur, her eyes looked toward where two elves stood talking. They looked human enough, they seamed slightly taller and maybe thinner as well. They also had pointed ears which was a little weird but not bad. Her fingers moved to the elf page even as the voice of the Goblin filled her mind.<br />
<br />
“Elves are very common and among the top ones requested but also there are many to go around. I could go something rare and make more money spending less time as a call girl but I wouldn’t know who I was when done.” Restated Toni as her finger found the page and looked over the details. “It may take longer to be free of this thing but as least I will still look basically the same…”<br />
<br />
She stopped as she noticed that elf wasn’t a single species but had multiple subspecies. She ran her fingers over the different subgroups, wood elves, high elves, moon elves and a dozen others species. She looked at them as her eyes came to a stop on one of them. <br />
<br />
“Maybe I can find a balance.” Whispered Toni “A way to stay mostly myself but yet stand out from other elves.”<br />
She turned and looked at the Goblin who was waiting nearby.<br />
<br />
“Question…” said Toni as the Goblin walked forward, something which made her want to gag because of the smell and his lack of pants.<br />
<br />
“Yes…have you decided, you still have a few minutes.” Stated the Goblin<br />
<br />
“Maybe.” Admitted Toni “What can you tell me about Drow?”<br />
<br />
“Drow?” inquired the Goblin slightly taken aback. “You are considering Drow?”<br />
<br />
“Yes.” Confirmed Toni “They are dark elves right?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, we haven’t had a Drow at the club, we don’t get many of there kind in.” stated the Goblin as he put his hand under his chin. “They are often more stuck up then normal elves and don’t like turned humans, they take them of course but they don’t like them all that much. They are more active at night, can see in the dark as clear as day but they don’t like sunlight all that much. Then all the other normal stuff longer life, pointed ears however their ears are longer then most elves. Is that what you want?”<br />
<br />
Toni thought about it, she was always more of a night owl then anything else and this way she would stay mostly herself yet be different enough to maybe get out from under this “club” sooner.<br />
<br />
“Yes.” Confirmed Toni as the Goblin nodded and turned to his boss who was busy watching the singer whom he paid top coin transform into a fairy, however this fairy wasn’t small but instead remained human size but with large beautiful wings. That is when Toni realized that everyone transforming was in the nude, and she knew what that meant.<br />
<br />
“Boss…the other one has decided to become a Drow!” yelled the Goblin as the owner Goblin turned and look.<br />
<br />
“A Drow…don’t see many of those….do it.” Confirmed the Boss as Toni gulped, fear gripping her heart as a cloaked figure approached and did a series of strange hand symbols as glowing blue energy surrounded Toni. <br />
<br />
Within moments her cloths disappeared, not transform like before but totally disappear leaving her nude. She tried to cover herself but her hands couldn’t move, she couldn’t move at all past some rapid breathing and moving of her head a bit. She felt tears in her eyes as she looked down. Her skin was rapidly changing color, the pink skin she had her whole life was turning darker and bluer. It was a constant change, finally stopping as a dark bluish grey, her nipples which she could see clearly had turned from their normal color to a dark navy color as her breast went up a size as well. She felt herself grow a bit as her spin grew longer and more flexible. Her hands and feet length as well and became more elegant. Finally, she felt her face change, not much she could tell but she did feel her ears elongate her finger and toe nails becoming navy color as well. She could see her bangs turn from a blonde color to a silver white and with tears still flowing from her now golden eyes, it was done. Toni the human was gone, Toni the Drow had come to be.</p>
