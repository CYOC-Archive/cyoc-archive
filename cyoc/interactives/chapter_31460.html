<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>You sit down on the sofa in the living room, the thought of why the house had a name like Howlings Hall still bothered you. It was a nickname that you knew the house had for years, ever since you were young. Closing your eyes again, thinking of the nickname "Howlings Hall" and focusing on it, you feel energy pulse around you, like you felt with the moon earlier, but even larger and stronger. Wondering if it worked, based on the only thing you knew, you open your eyes looking around, completely stunned by what you saw. The house was completely different, not even remotely looking like it had when you first encountered the old woman.</br>
<br>You stood in the middle of an extremely large, circular room. On your left was the base of a spiral staircase following the walls along the single room. You walk toward the banister of the stairs, finding it was ornately carved into a very detailed wolf's head, only the wolf's head was not just a wolf's but a cross between a wolf and a human's. Curious about the place, you continue walking around on the level you were on, not yet ready to inspect the upstairs quarters. You find a candle sconce on the wall, but you could see that there was something very different about it. Touching it, you feel that it will turn either to the right and to the left. Turning it to the right, pointing underneath the staircase, you hear the sound of gears turning, something mechanical happening, with something yet to reveal. You watch as the spiral mural on the floor begins to descend slowly, sinking below the floor. The portion painted like moonlight remained, where the darkened portion descended into another spiral staircase. Wondering where it led, you follow the stairs into the darkness. As if by magic, torches hung on the wall of the stairs under the main floor lit up, one after another in a sort of domino effect. Following the stone steps, you descend quite a ways into the hill the house sat upon. Once you reached the bottom, you stood on stone that was set in place with mortar. You look around, seeing that the wall was circular and was the same length as the one above ground. Figuring that this was the support for the rest of the house, you pay no attention to it and explore. You see a tall, white pillar made of stone. On the outside of the stem was what looked like thousands of faces pushing from the stem, trying to get free from what trapped them. The head of the pillar looked like two open wolf paws with it's claws extended. As you look at it further, you realize there were five fingers, while having an opposable thumb. That meant it was a cross between human and wolf, but you tried not paying any mind to it as it was simply strange. Even though a house that created what you wanted was strange, the altar was stranger still. You see that there was a very large and old book that was closed, placed in the middle of the palms. Curious as to what it contained, you walk over to it, placing your hand on the cover, feeling it, realizing it wasn't made out of paper like most. You look at the latch keeping it closed, you look for a way to open it, yet find no key hole. Frustrated, you place both hands on the book and yell <i>open</i>!</br>
<br>Immediately it responds to your command, the latch flies off and the book is now able to be opened. Flipping the cover open, you see that the title of the book was printed on the first page, centered both horizontally and vertically on the page. It was in Latin, so you did your best to pronounce it correctly. You figure you should read it out loud to get the pronunciation right. You sound out the words to be: <i>Librum Et Lupanis. Pacte De HomoLupus.</i></br>
<br>After the words were read, you hear the sound of moaning growing into howling. Something was definitely magical about the book, especially since it was a part of the house. Turning the page, wondering what it was about, it immediately begins on the history of the place. As you read you discover that Howlings Hall was sealed by the eldest of its inhabitants. He locked the magic away, placing it into a recipe known to make "Wolf Cookies". Your eyes widened, realizing that you played a part in this, possibly a large part. Continuing on, you read that the eldest took the newest born child, a boy to be exact as the seed of their people laid in the genes of the males of their people and abandoned him in the hopes one day he would return to the house of his forefathers. You stop, realizing that you were abandoned at an adoption agency, that it was strange and that you had a birthmark that resembled a crescent moon on your right hip. Continuing on, you read that upon his return, the true house will once again emerge and he would bring life to the house that had none for many years. Wondering if this could be truth, you recount everything once more. You were abandoned, you had the odd birthmark, you were drawn to the house even though you thought it was to help the old woman, you ate the cookie that contained the magic required to break the seal of the house and now you were there, reading a book that you opened by command. Something told you that this was all definitely true as it was happening as you stood there. Reading on, you look for instructions on what you are supposed to do. There was a diagram toward the middle of the book before the text just ended. Grabbing it, you figure that was what you needed. Just to see if this wasn't some huge joke, you look at the diagram. It showed that you were to turn the lever the other way and then everything would be revealed.</br>
<br>Since it was simple enough, you run up the spiral stairs, quickly reaching the main floor and the fake sconce. Turning it upright, the gears clanked again and the floor sealed up once more. Once the gears stopped, you turned the sconce to the left and waited to see what would happen. The gear started up again and the center of the mural split where there was the image of the full moon. As the gears clanked, you could see that the pedestal was rising from the basement to more than likely rest above ground again. Once the pillar was placed where it was supposed to be, the ceiling opened, letting an odd light beam directly on the book. You realize it was the light of the full moon, even though it was being generated with an artificial moon, like you created in the basement of the house you created. This one was bigger and obviously brighter. Feeling drawn to the light and the book, you walk up the pedestal and stand where you saw foot markings. The light flooding over you and the book, feeling energy and power ebb and flow in pulse like waves. The power seemed to come from the circular wall, the empty space below your feet and the ceiling above, all the way from every wall outside of that specific room. As the light increased, the strength of the  power did as well, until it felt as though it drew back to the wall, building up to one final surge. When it released, the power poured into you, knocking you down to the ground and you lay there sprawled out on the floor. The ceiling closed once again, but when it finished, the book and the pedestal remained.</br>
<br>As you woke up, groggily coming to, you try to stand on your own two feet, still a bit weak kneed. You remember what happened and you wonder what was next. Thinking the book may have an answer, you flip through the pages to find nothing of use to you for the moment. Although you do see that the pages that were blank were now filled with words and pictures. You look them over at a glance, still finding nothing of use. Wondering what you should do now, you decide it was time to climb the spiral stairs and see what else you might find.</br>
<br>At one stopping point of the stairs, seeming to be one level up, you find a hall with paintings of people adorned along the walls. Stopping to look at some, you realize you knew those people somehow. As you look at the paintings, something begins happening, and you see the people transforming into their wolven identities. Then while looking at them more, they changed back into humans. Walking further down the hall, you see that there was one empty frame hanging between a man and a woman. Stopping for another moment, you place your hand on the picture, feeling the image, stroking the persons face. An image pops into your mind, you see yourself as a newborn being held by the two who were placed on each side of the empty frame where you guess your image was to be. Continuing down the hall, you feel as though you should enter the door to your right. The urge was too strong to ignore, so you place your hand on the door knob, ready to open the door before you. Doing so, you walk into a room and turn the lights on. Inside you see a large room, what you thought as a master bedroom, having a four post bed, dresser, fully stocked closet of clothes. Thinking this to be as good a room as any, you decide to make it yours.</br>
<br>As you sit on the four post bed, a flash strikes you and you can see the hall filled with people, while the two who you thought were your birth parents sat on the very bed you were on, talking about the fate of your kind being left with the male baby to be born from her belly in days. As the flashback ends, you know this was where you were supposed to be. You knew it was right that you were there. You close your eyes once more and breathe slowly, thinking inwardly about yourself and what you were to do. Suddenly, an image entered your mind, at first it was cloaked in shadow, slowly it emerged coming to the front of your mind, being illuminated. You could see that it was you, but you were a large wolf-like beast. You see how strong it was, how powerful it must have been, how completely opposite it was from you. It grows bigger in your mind, becoming the only thing you could think about. You knew you wanted it, you wanted your animal side to be loosed, you wanted to be the werewolf you were born to be.</br>
<br>Suddenly, you felt every inch of your body tingle, growing in heat. Feeling as though your skin was on fire, you remove your clothes and sat there completely naked. Your average, hairless frame, without muscle definition, being completely average in every sense of the word was displayed before you. Angry with yourself, being inferior to the creature you had inside you, you call for the creature to come forth. In a burst of energy, you feel your skin tingle from the surface to the deepest tissue in your body, all the way down to your bones. Your body racks with spasms, your muscles growing spontaneously, hair sprouts from every pore of your body where hair should exist. As the wave was over, you stand on your two feet, immediately noticing things were different. Your senses were heightened, you were taller, muscular, hairy and having thick, meaty hands. Everything about your body was bigger and better than before, even your cock was larger. You stroke it till it was hard as a rock, spewing sticky and stringy clear precum in copious amounts. Wondering how you looked, you walked to the nearest mirror and gazed upon your reflection. You looked huge and definitely older, appearing as though you were thirty-five when you were twenty-four years old chronologically. Happiness flows abound within you, but you know that where you were was not the end. Again, thinking of the beast within, you focus on him and call him forth. This time his image was clear in your mind as you reached out and grabbed it's clawed paws, bringing it where you were now, placing yourself where he was. Suddenly, your body cramped, and you fell to the floor. Your bones popped and shifted, growing and thickening, all to fit your new wolven and glorious body. Your hands shifted into paws, thick black pads formed on your palms, your fingers gnarled as fur sprouted from them and razor sharp claws pushed out from under the beds of your fingernails. Fur sprouted quickly, consuming your body rapidly, covering every inch of skin. Blood filled your already hard cock, pushing it to expand in length and width. Your balls contracted and exploded in size, going from walnuts to fullsized baseballs in seconds. The tingling culminating in your head and at the base of your spine. Your ears growing to points, moving to the top of your head as your face pushes out, your nose following the end forming your new wolven muzzle. Fangs replaced your human teeth, as your tongue flattened, while widening at the same time, your eyes yellowed. You threw back your head and howl in all your wolven glory as your tail popped out, growing long and semi-fluffy as your cock shot copious amounts of your true werewolf cum from your huge and human shaped cock. Once the spasms ended, the smell of your seed wafted into your nose and you drop to all fours, searching for where the majority of your cum landed. Finding a huge pool of it, you begin lapping at it, tasting the sweet and salty nectar. Wanting more than what was there, you bend down and lick at your own cock, sucking on it and milking it for more cum. You bob up and down on your own shaft, becoming more and more furious in your actions, focusing on another load. You felt that you were near the edge and you sucked slow and long, and as you came back up on your fat, human shaped cock head, you send yourself over the edge, shooting half a gallon of cum onto your tongue and let it flow down into your stomach, swallowing huge gobs of the creamy and delicious white goo. Once you were satisfied in that respect, you come off your cock, licking your maw clean, ensuring you got every last drop of the great nectar. You howl again, this time because you were now on the prowl. There was a deep urge within you to bring more into your pack and you knew that was what you needed to do. Now on a mission, you calm yourself down and bring back your human counterpart, knowing that you wouldn't get very far in your wolven form. Rapidly, you regress into your human form, keeping most of the muscle, hairiness and cock size. You are instantly reminded of your college and all those who were ripe for the picking, but who would you choose first?</br></p>
