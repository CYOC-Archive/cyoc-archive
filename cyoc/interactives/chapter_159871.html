<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brin grabbed the bras she bought and the medallion, felt the shock, smiled, put the amulet down and went up the stairs to her room, moving three steps with each stride.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gina, looking at the not so short Jake, told him “Let’s go to our room to get you measured”<br />
With both going to her room, Jake noticed how he didn’t have to speed up that much to keep up with her now.<br />
<br />
At her room, Gina measured Jake against her wall.<br />
“Looks like you are a clean six feet” she said, giving him a smile on his face.<br />
<br />
“Gina, wanna... do what you offered yesterday?” Jake asked, gently squeezing Gina’s now larger breasts. He didn’t know where he got that courage from, but there was no way back now...<br />
Gina immediately understood what he meant and started to undress. “Yes, I do”<br />
After the agreement, Jake removed his own shirt and pants, who were too short on him, and then his tight underwear.<br />
<br />
As he and Gina looked at his naked body, it looked similar, though longer, in addition to another thing down there also became a little longer than before...<br />
Right after that, Jake pulled Gina to her bed. It was difficult, and he was surprised about his capability to do so and certain he wouldn’t have been able to do so if she fought back as she still had nearly half a foot over him.<br />
On Gina’s bed, both of them lost their virginity with a confused and clumsy yet passionate and pleasurable sex.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
All that while, Brin was in her own room waiting for her own change.<br />
Only a handful minutes after she touched the medallion, her bra (technically Gina’s) became too tight, so she removed her shirt (also Gina’s) and the bra, to reveal her breasts rapidly getting bigger.<br />
Going to the mirror in her room, she was too tall to look it in a comfortable position. Due to that, she took a chair to sit down in front of it.<br />
Only ten minutes since the change started and Brin’d breasts already looked to be as big as what Gina’s have become.<br />
Twenty minutes since the change started and the pair that stuck out of her chest has started to get heavy and the nipples appeared notably bigger, making Brin more and more excited.<br />
<br />
As thirty minutes has passed since the start, Brin noticed how her heavy mammaries stopped changing. Looking down, her sight was blocked by them. She saw how they were large enough to form a large cleavage even without a bra.<br />
<br />
To get a better look, she went to the mirror to analyze them closer.<br />
Standing up, Brin felt heavy weight pulling her chest down against her movement, and as she stood up to her full height, she felt them heavily jiggling.<br />
For a young teenage girl who was as flat as a boards until the day before, she was extremely excited for that, and like with her height, the hassles only fueled her excitement.<br />
Talking a long step towards her mirror and bending down, Brin felt how each of these movements caused jiggling, and then analyzed her breasts from the reflection.<br />
They were huge on her young and slim figure, though clearly natural, and her nipples were a lot larger than before, though not as big as expected for a female with breasts of such size.<br />
Grabbing them, they were very heavy, and the touch was very pleasuring.<br />
<br />
“Am am a freakishly tall and busty amazon” she said with a huge smile on her face.<br />
She absolutely loved it.<br />
<br />
After the analysis, Brin grabbed one of the bras she bought, Brin had a bit of struggle putting them in, but they were a perfect fit.<br />
The bra gave her breasts some support, and increased her already great cleavage.<br />
<br />
She had to show it to Gina and Jake.<br />
<br />
Walking to her sister’s room, Brin found herself disoriented once again due to the center of gravity changing, but she balanced herself.<br />
<br />
By the time she reached Gina’s door, the pair of lovebirds has finished and dressed up.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Jake was the one to open the door, and even with his new height, his face was met with a large pair of breasts. Both him and Gina stared in shock to the large mounds, and Brin was well aware of that.<br />
<br />
“Hey shorties! My eyes are up here” Brin said extremely teasingly. “But if you are already staring at my boobs, what do you think about them, LITTLE sister?” she continued to Gina with a little movement to cause a jiggle.<br />
<br />
“Brin, are you really sure you want to be like that?” Gina asked. “You will now have the problems of both a big bust and a tall body and no matter what, you will always be the certain of attention.”<br />
<br />
“It’s worth it” Brin said with a smile. “I prefer that to what I was before, with all the disadvantages, and you can’t convince me otherwise. If anything, I hope I’ll get even more extreme!”<br />
<br />
Afterwards, Jake heard his phone ring.<br />
“It’s my mom” Jake said. “She said that I have to go back home soon...”<br />
After packing his stuff, Jake put on the new socks and shoes he bought, but before leaving, he thought of an idea and asked Gina. “Can I take the medallion for the night? I think I want to do something with it. I’ll bring it back tomorrow”<br />
Gina agreed and Jake put it in a bag to avoid unwanted changes, gave Gina a goodbye kiss, went towards his car and drove.</p>
