<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tyson Prior was rather surprised when he got a request to come to Heiya Island to convert someone. But he was hardly displeased. Skull Island might be a nice place, but it was a little small for him. Quite literally as he became a little bigger than expected when he converted into a <i>Tylosaurus</i>. There was only so much room Skull Island could provide, which was why they haven&#39;t done any conversions for the larger <i>Mosasaurus</i>. Sure, Tyson had a regular job as a lifeguard and shark deterrent, but the job can be a little unfulfilling and unchallenging. And he felt a little lonely being the only mosasaur.<br />
<br />
So naturally Tyson leapt at the opportunity to travel to a new place and meet someone who wanted to become another <i>Tylosaurus</i>. The fact that someone was female excited him, though he tried to control himself. As pent-up as he was, he didn&#39;t want to come across like a creep. But he could barely hold his excitement as he was flown towards Heiya Island. Of course, it wasn&#39;t a straight flight from Skull Island to Heiya Island. The plane did have to stop and refuel along the way. Heiya Island is a little off the beaten path by standard flight routes, so the last stopover in Japan was a bit unavoidable.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, it wasn&#39;t a simple refuel and go. Unlike cars, airplanes require a lot of fuel that had to be pumped in by special trucks. And unlike a gas station, Tokyo International Airport couldn&#39;t allow planes to simply leave after refueling. As a major international airport, dozens of planes came and left everyday. As such, a tight air schedule was needed to make sure the coming and going planes didn&#39;t collide with each other. And even Animalia Air would have to wait before it can take off again.<br />
<br />
The wait at the airport became a little too long for Tyson, especially since he was flying in a relatively smaller and more private plane. Eventually, he lost patience and said, &quot;I may as well swim the rest of the way.&quot; And unlike most people, he was actually capable of doing that. After arranging for his luggage to be sent on to Heiya Island, Tyson made his way to the western coast of Japan. He had to pay a truck driver who was happening to be driving towards that area to ride in his trailer as few vehicles would be big enough to fit him. Once Tyson got to the western coast, he put his phone in a waterproof bag and set his navigation app to Heiya Island. Of course, most people using this app would be more likely to take a boat. But as Tyson said, &quot;A boat would slow me down.&quot;<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
The East China Sea is only a small part of the vast Pacific Ocean. Still, it was too large for anyone but the most trained human swimmers to try and swim across. For a <i>Tylosaurus</i>, it was much easier. Tyson&#39;s biggest concern was going off course. Occasionally, he had to stop, check his phone, and readjust his direction. Sometimes, he dived down and snapped up a fish to eat. While he would prefer his fish cleaned and cooked, his saurian palate can handle raw fish. He felt quite secure as the dominant predator in these waters. The only things that could give him trouble were a great white shark and an orca and they would have to be pretty hungry to try attacking him instead of easier prey.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Tyson saw Heiya Island on the horizon and swam towards it. Considering its relative remoteness, it wasn&#39;t much of a wonder why this island had been lost for a few centuries. By his calculations, he should be approaching its north beach. He could see people on the beach as he got closer. Out of a sense of playfulness, Tyson kept underwater as he got closer to the shore. He wondered how many people could see him coming. It wasn&#39;t like he had a dorsal fin to give away his position.<br />
<br />
Eventually, the water became too shallow to just keep going underwater and he emerged from the sea. The sight of a marine Dinotopian suddenly rising from the sea startled quite a few people. Quite a few kids ran away crying for &#39;Gojira&#39; or &#39;Gamera&#39;. Tyson was almost tempted to roar, but that might be a little too much. The kids were panicked enough as it is. The adults were far more collected, though many of them pulled out their phones to snap pictures as Tyson walked out of the surf. As he started walking up the beach, he soon noticed what looked like a group of schoolgirls heading his way. As they got closer, he could see they were of various teenage ages. What he didn&#39;t expect was for them to crowd around and start clamoring over him. &quot;Whoa, ladies! Hey! I just got here!&quot; yelped Tyson as he was being mobbed.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, a pair of orca Animalians were able to break up the fangirl frenzy. Tyson noticed something rather unusual about these two. These orcas were silver instead of black and the female had breasts that were a little bigger than what Tyson had seen on other orca women. The female introduced herself, &quot;I&#39;m Kumiko and this is my mate, Ningen. You must be Prior Tyson.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s actually Tyson Prior,&quot; said Tyson.<br />
<br />
&quot;I forget how you Americans arrange your names sometimes,&quot; said Kumiko, &quot;Anyways, my cousin has been waiting to meet you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your cousin with the gigantomastia?&quot; asked Tyson. Well, this explained why Kumiko was so busty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, she&#39;s been looking for relief and I&#39;m hoping you can provide it,&quot; said Kumiko.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll see what I can do to help,&quot; said Tyson.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
When Tyson met Kumiyo, he could see why she needed to become such a large Animalian. Her large breasts on her small frame looked like she was bound to an exercise ball. Tyson couldn&#39;t imagine the daily strain that put on her back.<br />
<br />
Still, Tyson felt like he ought to know a little about Kumiyo first, especially if she might become his mate after converting. &quot;So, if I may ask, why do you want to be a <i>Tylosaurus</i>?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Any ancient marine reptile would do,&quot; said Kumiyo, &quot;But <i>Tylosaurus</i> looks closest to an orca.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So why not become an orca like your cousin?&quot; asked Tyson.<br />
<br />
&quot;Prior-san, our fathers are identical twins who married another set of identical twins. We were born on the same day and physically and genetically, we were practically twins ourselves,&quot; said Kumiyo, &quot;And what we&#39;ve both agreed on is that we would <b>not</b> look exactly alike after our conversions. Maybe true identical twins can deal with it, but it&#39;s much more annoying for identical cousins.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose it might be,&quot; said Tyson, &quot;Though that doesn&#39;t limit your options to just sea animals.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our fathers also own a fishing company in Hokaido,&quot; said Kumiyo, &quot;We thought we could help out by chasing the fish into their nets.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s commendable,&quot; said Tyson.<br />
<br />
&quot;Also, I heard you were lonely with no others of your kind,&quot; said Kumiyo, &quot;Maybe I could help with that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is a generous and tempting offer,&quot; said Tyson, trying to remain a gentleman, &quot;But let&#39;s see how your conversion goes first.&quot;</p>
