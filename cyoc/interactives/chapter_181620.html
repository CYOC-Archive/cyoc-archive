<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Debbie expounded upon her time in the midst of the houses. Apparently with the disappearance of the -former- heiresses, they were more willing to bring Debbie back into the fold as the last remaining true heiress of any of the families. They were already bringing the second in line for each of the families forward now. They were quite skeptical of her story of arriving upon the incomplete sex doll she&#39;d brought but, needs were too great now to ignore a potential threat. Having tested the residue on the doll, they had set forth a search of the area for the origin.<br />
<br />
They found it at the cost of several of their low branch family members that had gone on the search. This swift dispatching of their search team had left the leader&#39;s concerned that they would get a elite group in town in time to intercept it. Of course, they&#39;d kept the doll at the main hall of the Houses for further study but, they released Debbie to her own devices until further need arose. So having made certain that she was not followed, not that she felt she would be, she had come to Selicia as soon as she felt it was safe.<br />
<br />
The success of getting Debbie into the Houses again was wonderful and mildly unexpected new. There might be more than she knew of going into their decision but, for now she&#39;d cautiously make use of it. While Selicia considered the options available with this news, Debbie had offhandedly mentioned that the &#39;New Girl&#39; at work was doing well and going to take her shifts as she had quit to take on her new role. With that she excused herself to head to her home, there was a member of the Houses coming to discuss the reinstatement of her family.<br />
<br />
Wanting to ease off of the dream she&#39;d had the night before and celebrate a success to her plans, Selicia decided to head out to a higher class restaurant. She returned to her bedroom to change into a fairly more extravagant dress, she informed Marina where she would be if anything came up. Since there was the looming threat of this witch of the past coming to town she wanted to be certain to keep her territory safe. There was little in the way of her telling just how much of a threat she may pose after so long. Judging from recent evidence presented, she may be in a struggle should they meet in a less than amiable nature.<br />
<br />
With a quick jaunt by spell, Selicia arrived a short distance from the Black Velvet restaurant. One of the upper class restaurants in the center of the town, not quite the best of the best but, worthy of the occasion. She checked herself in at the door and was ushered to a small booth to the quieter side of the eating area. Her waitress arrived shortly after with the menu and a list of wines to choose from. The waitress was a cute woman with a button nose, blue eyes, and brown bob cut hair. She wore her uniform well and filled it out just as well. D cups being held firmly to her chest with a well shaped rear end. She had a kind of lilt to her voice as she gave her introduction to the restaurant.<br />
<br />
Having selected a deep red wine from the menu and a fine steak cut with a side of potatoes and greens. Bowing slightly the waitress moved on to complete her order and return with the wine. As Selicia waited for her return, she felt a certain wrongness to the air of the restaurant. It wasn&#39;t there when she&#39;d first arrived but, the cloying feeling had stifled the refined feeling that had been there. Returning with the wine, the waitress seemed concerned about Selicia&#39;s furled brow.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s nothing , Dear. Don&#39;t worry about me, just plotting the course of the days events. &quot;A feigned smile seemed to placate the woman as she smiled in return and left for another table.<br />
<br />
With a quarter of the bottle gone, Selicia searched for the waitress since it was long past the estimated wait. As she scanned the crowd for any sign of the woman, a waiter approached her table with a humble bow. &quot;The woman at the private booth across the way has requested you join her. We will have your food brought to you there.&quot; As Selicia followed the waiter across the dining area the sense of wrongness increased drastically until she was standing at the booth. Her senses screamed in her head that the source was here. As she stared at the veiled woman seated at the table, the waiter excused himself to retrieve Selicia&#39;s food if it was ready.<br />
<br />
The woman lifted her veil and the past struck Selicia boldly across the face. There was no more time to prepare for her arrival, the witch was already among them. Her hair was a strange sort of unkempt with a unique style to it coming down around predatory yellow eyes that seemed to jump through emotions the longer she stared into them. She looked the spitting image of what she had the last time Selicia had seen her so long ago. There was not a single sign of the ages past between then and now. She gestured for Selicia to be seated across from her and smiled sweetly but, the eyes didn&#39;t look any less unfriendly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Selicia~ It has been ages since we&#39;ve last spoken to each other. Tell me, how was it being a statue for a thousand years? Refreshing was... What&#39;s happened to me...? n&#39;t it?&quot; That brief crack in her speech seemed to go unnoticed by her. The voice and tone sounded of a young man desperate for an answer.<br />
<br />
Keeping on her guard, Selicia smirked and stretched her arms. &quot;Well, a thousand years will give you such a crick in the neck. I should say you look like you haven&#39;t aged a day, Abernathy... How have you stayed so exuberant after living for so long...?&quot; Asking that question was more out of a need to keep small talk alive rather than actual curiosity. She already had an idea just what she had done.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, so you wonder after me even after so long apart.&quot; Abernathy&#39;s smile seeming a sneer with those eyes fixed in their gaze. &quot;It&#39;s quite simple, I... Please, you have to help me... do what I&#39;ve always done in the past, maybe a bit more in excess now however~&quot; A lick of her lips, left Selicia feeling as if there was the implication that she might be on that list of potential candidates.<br />
<br />
While they were talking the waiter returned with a covered tray placing it before Selicia. &quot;Your steak, Madam...&quot; He uncovered the tray and with a bow stood in wait at the side of the booth. Curious... Shouldn&#39;t he be seeing to the needs of other tables? Seeing her steak was still steaming had brought another thought to her mind, had the remade it fresh after the long wait or... Looking to Abernathy, Selicia saw that she had nothing in the way of a menu, food, or drink in front of her. &quot;Have they not seen to your needs yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, I was merely waiting for you to get yours before I settled on mine~&quot; Those eyes looked up past Selicia prompting her to follow their gaze. In short order she had seen exactly what she&#39;d suspected at first and what Abernathy had meant. A blonde haired woman seated at a table with five other guests had suddenly been enveloped by her own dress. After the dress had completely wrapped within itself, it shrank slowly become more glassy and translucent until there on the seat sat a bottle of wine. The other diners at the table didn&#39;t seem to care let alone notice the change.<br />
<br />
A few tables over from that one, a man and a woman were suddenly pulled together. Their clothing swirling to the floor beneath them as their body&#39;s shrank and lost definition. The woman of the pair seemed to fall into pieces but, it was hard to tell from where Selicia sat. Further over a waitress was in mid-stride when her changes took form, she continued to walk through them as her legs shortened slowing her stride, arms sliding into her shoulders, and her head fell into her uniform. She fell forward onto her pristine white panties that panned out becoming a shining white plate. As a pair of B cup breasts tumbled from the shirt, another lump was already settling on the plate. The three peach colored lumps turned an off white shortly there after.<br />
<br />
With a look from Abernathy, the waiter walked forth and collected the victims as if nothing was wrong with any of it. Even going as far as scooping the last plate from the floor didn&#39;t get so much as a raised eyebrow. He brought the collection to the table and laid them out before Abernathy. Selicia could clearly see just what was on either plate now and the subtly had surprised her. The main dish held a suggestively sausage, a pair of eggs, two &#39;chicken&#39; breasts with deeper pink spots, a baked potato with a small nob of butter to one end, and a pair of steamed buns. On the other plate was a desert reminiscent of a transformation Selicia had herself done in the past, three scoops of assumed vanilla with one sporting a trail of whipped cream like spread lips and a cherry atop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will that be all for you, Madam?&quot; The waiter asked calmly as Abernathy surveyed her &#39;food&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, you are dismissed.&quot; She said with a wave of her hand. The waiter bowed once more and then, without further ado, he too vanished into his uniform. &quot;Would you get that for me, Selicia?&quot; Abernathy motioned to the crumpled uniform.<br />
<br />
Reaching in through the neck of the uniform, Selicia grabbed a hard and hot shaft. She pull it loose to see that she held and equally suggestive steamed carrot. The pause elicited an impatient wave onward from Abernathy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well come now, I don&#39;t mind if it&#39;s touched anything. I need my vegetables after all, I&#39;m... What&#39;s going on here...? an old woman after all.&quot; She grinned amiably as Selicia passed her the carrot. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ve settled something special for you as well~ Just finish what you have first.&quot; With that final comment, she took a large bite of the carrot and started into the rest of her &#39;food&#39; .<br />
<br />
The rest of the &#39;meal&#39; passed quietly with the occasional outburst from Abernathy that made the scene far more unsettling. The voice of the previous waiter was already among them when she patted the ice cream from her lips. &quot;Fantastic meal and service, I should make this a regular stop, truly~&quot; Seeing that Selicia had likewise finished her meal, Abernathy giggled absently. &quot;Ah, where are my manners... Here you are~&quot; She produced a small covered tray from beside her and slid it over to Selicia. Opening the lid, Selicia received the answer to a question she&#39;d asked herself around an hour before.<br />
<br />
On the tray was a single pastry bearing the striking resemblance to a female torso with a smile on its face. The cute waitress that had initially served her was now laying before her as a brown sugar frosted Bavarian cream eclair. At the prompting of Abernathy and the threat that if she didn&#39;t want it Selicia picked the former woman up. It was either she did the honor or she joined the rest of the people tonight. So Selicia bit into the eclair headfirst to make it somewhat easier on her. Doing so cause a small splatter of cream to shoot out of the tiny opening at the over end. Abernathy quickly scooped it onto her finger and licked it off with glee.<br />
<br />
&quot;You certainly know how to make a display, Selicia.&quot; She chortled noting the thin line of cream waggling from the same opening.<br />
<br />
Having finished the eclair, Selicia fought down the mind of the terrified woman. Despite the showy exterior the casting was a mess leaving the mind of the victim to free to roam. Placating the former waitress as best as one might be able to, she felt the woman fade away. Coming back to the scene at hand, Abernathy was smiling viciously at Selicia.<br />
<br />
&quot;This has been such a lovely reunion, my next visit will be to your undoubtedly lovely home~ Oh, and don&#39;t worry about the bill, they won&#39;t remember it anyway~ Ta ta~&quot; Abernathy faded from view pulling herself to some unknown place but, the message was clear. Selicia would be next on the menu...</p>
