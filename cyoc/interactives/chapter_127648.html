<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie stared in horror as Ms. Walters began to grow younger. The beautiful dark haired teachers face began to soften as she crossed the threshold of 30 and reentered her mid twenties. Katie could see the woman’s large breasts appear to perk up as she grew younger. Trembling Katie hoped Ms. Walters regression would end soon. To her dismay it didn’t.<br />
<br />
Katie began to grow pale as Ms. Walters began to relive college in reverse. She watched as Ms. Walters face began to soften even more. The young coed looked around 21 now, her waist thinning as her dark hair seemed to shine. “No, no,no,no,” Katie whispered as Ms. Walters became a teenager again.<br />
<br />
Katie felt on the verge of tears as Donna Walters reentered high school. The girl had a youthful face with with a thin waist and perky c cup breasts that appeared to be getting smaller. Katie trembled now as Donna became 17 then 16. The girl was a beauty with a shy smile, and black hair that descended to her waist. Donna now appeared to shrink as she became 15. Katie was petrified at this point, the girl while skinny possessed a gorgeous face with ample perky breasts. Donna now shrank again becoming 14. Her regression complete Katie stared at her waifish form. <br />
<br />
Donna was a youthful looking girl with a gorgeous face, perky b cup breasts and a thin waist. Katie watched as the ill fitting clothing she wore began to change. Instead of a blouse and slacks Donna now sported a Wonder Woman T-shirt and a pair of jeans. Smiling up at the sophomore girls Donna now spoke. “Hey Mary, hey Katie how was your weekend,” she chirped.<br />
For Katie it was too much, dropping the ring she now sprinted out of the classroom to the nearest bathroom, her friends desperately calling her.<br />
<br />
“Shit,” Claudia exclaimed. “Someone should go after her.” The girls nodded as they looked at the young girl at the teachers desk. Kellie sighed as she stood, “Let me,” she said. “Her over reaction is probably my fault. She probably doesn’t realize what’s happening right now.” The girls seemed to agree with Kellie as she reached down for the ring and now headed out to get Katie.<br />
<br />
As Kellie entered the nearest bathroom she could hear sobbing coming from the nearby stall. She approached slowly, knocking on the knocked door. “Go away,” the girl cried. Kellie sighed, knocking once more. “Katie it’s me,” she said. “Please open the door.”<br />
<br />
“No,” she wailed. “Don’t you see I messed up again. I....I didn’t want to do that to Ms. Walters. Your....your going to be...so mad....I...” Katie trailed off into further sobs. Kellie sighed and smiled. She had witnessed the whole incident and knew it was an accident. Ms. Walters had touched the ring and wished herself, Katie had nothing to do with it. As it stood now Kellie could see how things had turned out for Donna Walters, the results were better than expected and Katie needed to know.<br />
<br />
“Kat Listen,” She soothed. “I know you think it’s your fault but I saw the whole thing. Donna touched the ring accidentally, you had nothing to do with it. Now please open the door, I’m not mad, in fact I’m happy. You did a great thing.”<br />
<br />
Katie unlocked the door and slowly opened it. Kellie could see her girlfriend now sitting down, her eyes red while her cheeks were tear stained. Smiling Kellie took her girlfriends hand and pulled her into a hug. Katie cried anew as Kellie stroked her hair. “Shhh it’s ok,” she soothed. When Katie calmed down enough Kellie now began to talk.<br />
<br />
“Look I know you think I’m mad but I know it was an accident,” she said. “Besides your not going to believe what happened.”<br />
<br />
Katie sniffed as she gave Kellie a confused look. “What changed,” she asked.<br />
<br />
Kellie now explained the new reality. Donna Walters was a 14 year old freshman, her 15th birthday would be in July making her one of the youngest kids in the school. As it turned out Donna’s mother, Victoria Walters, was a teacher at the school. The 40 year old woman was as popular with her students as Donna Walters was (or would be someday). In this new reality Donnas best friend was Cassie Abbott, the 15 year old emo freshman the girls had changed not too long ago. As an added bonus Cassie’s father Jared had proposed to Victoria in the fall. The wedding was planned for that summer meaning that the best friends would soon become sisters. Since neither had any siblings the two girls were extremely excited about this. Katie gaped at Kellie as she finished her tale.<br />
<br />
“So things worked out well then,” Katie whispered. Kellie smiled and nodded. “Yeah things worked out great,” She said. “Cassie never really had any friends and believe it or not neither did Donna. The two seem like a perfect fit together, their have similar interests and couldn’t be happier with the way things are now.”<br />
<br />
“But I was reckless again,” Katie cried. “I....I didn’t want to make any changes. I never wanted to use my power and make you mad with me ever again.”<br />
<br />
Kellie now smiled as she held Katie’s face in her hands. “Katie,” she soothed. “You didn’t make these changes, Donna did. Don’t ask me why but I think that ring has a mind of its own to some extent. I’m beginning to think it can influence some of the changes that you choose to make. This isn’t your fault, this is something Donna wanted and it worked out better than we could ever hope for. Now come on, come and see.”<br />
<br />
Katie nodded sadly as Kellie helped her to her feet. Leaning on her girlfriend for support Katie made her way back to the classroom. As they entered Katie was shocked by what she saw.<br />
<br />
A woman that looked very much like Ms. Walters was now sitting at the teachers desk. The 40 year old woman had a spread of bridal magazines across her desk. Helping the woman make these decisions were 15 year old Cassie and a now 14 year old Donna. The two freshman giggled as they helped Victoria Walters make the tough decisions on the types of bridesmaids dresses they should have.  <br />
<br />
“Katie is everything alright,” Victoria asked. “You look a little pale.” <br />
<br />
“No, I’m okay Ms. Walters,” Katie muttered. “I guess lunch isn’t agreeing with me.<br />
<br />
Ms. Walters smiled as she looked at the young teen. “That’s Why always pack my lunch,” she smiled. “I’ve never trusted the cafeteria food.”<br />
<br />
“It’s not that bad mom,” Donna giggled. “Me and Cassie had pizza it wasn’t that bad.”<br />
<br />
“I think you might be right Ms. Walters,” Cassie said. “Donna liked it but I kind of thought it was gross. That’s why had gave mine to Her.”<br />
<br />
“Cassie I’ve told you you can call me mom,” Victoria said. “After all were all going to be family in just a couple more months.”<br />
<br />
Katie watched as A wide grin spread across Cassie’s face. “Okay mom no problem.”<br />
<br />
Katie stared dumbfounded at the family she had accidentally created. Turning towards Kellie she could see her girlfriend smiling as she gripped her hand tightly. “You did a great thing here Katie ,” she whispered. Katie turned back to look at Ms. Walters and her two daughters. Seeing how happy the three of them were Katie had to agree with her girlfriend, she really had done a great thing.</p>
