<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Christy, the other employee Susan had brought in, was still happily sucking on Susan’s balls as Susan felt the curse’s power run through her.<br />
<br />
Felicia’s breasts surged outwards, her bunny suit stretching with them. She’d been a solid D cup before, but now Felicia was sporting obviously fake J cup breasts, big and firm on her chest. Her hips and rear expanded, her stomach becoming flatter with abs forming, as if all she did was exercise all day. Her bunny outfit began to change, her leotard becoming a black blouse that showed off her cleavage. A pair of leopard print leggings appeared, showing off her newly expanded hips and ass. A pair of 6 inch heels appeared on her feet, making the 5’4 woman stand at 5’10.<br />
<br />
Felicia was a bit dazed. The 33 year old seemed slightly confused as her thick blonde hair formed itself into a bun. Much heavier makeup appeared on her face, which was changing as well - her lips expanded, giving her huge DSLs that Susan was going to thoroughly enjoy. <br />
<br />
Expensive jewelry appeared all over her body, including diamond earrings, a diamond necklace, a fancy watch, and a diamond bracelet. The shining star of this, however, was a huge diamond engagement ring on her finger, along with a wedding band.<br />
<br />
Susan held her head for a second as a wedding band appeared on her finger next. New memories began to appear. Buncorp was a fully owned subsidiary of Sultry Smith’s - Susan remembered Felicia being bored at home and wanting to spend more time at work with her - and her sexy employees - so she allocated some money for her sexy trophy wife to feel accomplished. Susan had been incredibly impressed at how profitable it was, and she was happy to let Jennifer’s step-MILF pass it down to her. Susan opened her laptop to check on the site as Christy continued sucking her off.<br />
<br />
Susan bit her lip when she saw Ophelia on the site, remembering how good it felt to fuck THE Lesbian Goth Whore. For a split second, Susan wondered if she’d met up with Ophelia for another reason, but those thoughts were interrupted by that same hair pulling feeling she’d become familiar with…<br />
<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
<br />
“I’m sick and tired of you fucking these whores all the time! What, I’m not good enough?” A voice was yelling at Susan.<br />
<br />
Susan was a bit dazed, but she suddenly remembered who it was. Thea. Her pregnant fiancée. She was having another daydream.<br />
<br />
“Babe, I don’t get the problem! I had a vasectomy just like you said, and I’ve been wearing condoms!” Susan yelled back. She couldn’t believe what she was saying.<br />
<br />
“That’s not the point! If I’m gonna be your wife, you can’t be fucking these stupid god damn sluts all the time!” Thea shouted, with tears in her eyes. “I didn’t even want this damn baby!”<br />
<br />
“Thea, you knew who I was when we started fucking! I can’t control my dick! I need to get off as much as possible!” Susan shouted back.<br />
<br />
“Fuck. You.” Thea said. She took her engagement ring off and threw it at Susan. “And you’re going to take care of this baby. I don’t want anything to do with either of you ever again!” Thea shouted, before storming out of Susan’s humble apartment. Susan remembered that both of them had dropped out of college - that night in the dorm room, she’d gotten Thea pregnant. After a while, she’d convinced her to keep the baby. But Susan couldn’t stop fucking as many women as possible. She had to listen to her cock. Her big, wonderful cock. Her huge, full balls. She couldn’t resist her urges - why even try? She pulled off her sweatpants - her twelve incher was just as impressive as it’d always been, and her huge hairy balls were just as sensitive. Despite being upset that Thea had left, Susan began fondling her balls, feeling her cock rise again…<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
In a snap, Susan was back in the office - but not in the present day. It was at least ten years earlier - before she’d hired Martha. A younger, less chesty Felicia was under her desk, vacuum-sucking Susan’s cock.<br />
<br />
“Oh my GOD!” Susan shouted, as she sent another load down Felicia’s throat. “I knew I made the right choice hiring you. You’re such a dirty slut.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks, boss!” Felicia said, wiping her mouth. “And these new tits you got me feel great! Who knew I’d ever be an E cup?”<br />
<br />
“That’s just the start. Say, how do you feel about threesomes?” Susan said, licking her lips.<br />
<br />
“Mmm, well… I did fuck Diana. And Liz. I really, really love sex, boss! I’ll fuck whoever you want me to!” Felicia said, with a smile.<br />
<br />
Susan recognized Liz… but who was Diana? <br />
<br />
Susan remembered David. He was a body building coworker that she’d had when she was just an employee… but her mental image of him instantly morphed. In David’s place was Diana, a gynomorph like Susan. The difference, though, is that while Diana had fairly impressive testicles, her cock was a measly 3 incher. Instead of being a 6 foot tall, 260 pound body builder, Diana had shrunk down to just 5’2 and 130 pounds. She was a beautiful woman, and now Susan remembered fucking Diana’s ass multiple times. Diana had even taken advantage of the company’s breast implant program, going from natural C cups to much better J cups.<br />
<br />
In fact, all of the male workers had become gynomorphs - but Susan remained as the sole alpha. The biggest dick. The highest position. The most dominant woman in the company. All because she listened to her beautiful dick. She felt herself cum as her world began spinning once again…<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Christy happily took Susan’s load in her mouth as Felicia had her pussy eaten out by another one of Susan’s loyal workers - Liz. Formerly one of Susan’s managers, the new universe had decided to make Liz a (much sexier) secretary. Felicia shouted as she, too, orgasmed, the two secretaries looking proud that they’d made the boss and her wife cum so hard. Susan licked her lips as she watched Liz and Christy make out. She had such wonderful employees. Felicia pulled her thong and leggings back on as Liz and Christy left the room, continuing to passionately make out.<br />
<br />
“God, that was fucking fantastic! Alright, babe. I gotta hit the gym. Love you.” Felicia said, kissing Susan on the lips.<br />
<br />
“See you tonight!” Susan said, smacking her wife’s ass.<br />
<br />
Felicia winked as strutted away, Susan admiring how her wife’s ass looked in her leggings.<br />
<br />
Finally, Susan was alone. She blinked a few times.<br />
<br />
“W-what… something’s happened…” she thought. She couldn’t quite remember. Something… something with her cock? She felt it rise once again. Part of her tried to focus on what she was forgetting, but another part of her wanted to just listen to her cock and mindlessly jerk off. After all, her cock had never led her astray before…</p>
