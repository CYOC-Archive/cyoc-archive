<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Over those two weeks, another transformation that had ensued was the youthening transformation of Coach Eli Bramden. Eli had been a football player himself in his youth, but in college an unexpected injury to his knee took him out of the circuit. However his understanding of the game was so good that he wound up coaching football, first making his appearance as an assistant coach to the current team before the old coach retired and passed the reins down to him.<br />
<br />
With Coach Eli at 42 years old, it would stand that the youthening transformation would have momentous effects on him. Though few could really guess exactly how large these effects would be.<br />
<br />
A married man, the first day in the two week long transformation, the newly 41 year old Eli woke up on the first morning feeling better than he had in a long time. He felt bad having to cut Gary from the team, it was obvious the guy was trying to gain weight to really make his impact on the team, but there was such a thing as too much. But right now his thoughts were on how curiously GOOD he felt just waking up. Usually he would be besieged by aches and pains as middle age wore down on him together with the impact of lifestyle but today he was feeling so much better.<br />
<br />
He woke his wife for their morning routine, him having to go to work with the school and his wife Ellenore having her job at the bank to get to.<br />
<br />
She commented on his gumption and energy as he went about making their coffee, &quot;Someone&#39;s in a good mood...&quot; She kissed him and Eli was surprised by how he wanted to really return it, but there was little room this morning for amorous topics. Both had their obligations.<br />
<br />
It was when Eli got to school that morning and greeted the other teachers he started to wonder if something was up. The head of the physical therapy room commented that he was looking good, and wanted to know if he&#39;d been taking her advice to eat healthier. He shrugged her off and went about his business. Still, Eli had to wonder if there was something to it...<br />
<br />
It was odd to go to practice and lead the students in drills without having Gary around, but it seemed Tyler and Pete were in very good form that day, and he was delighted to see them stepping up. The Coach went home that day convinced that whatever he had been doing to shape up, he needed to do it more. Despite usually liking a drink after dark, today he skipped the liquor and went to try out the treadmill he&#39;d bought impulsively a few years ago, but which only his wife seemed to use.<br />
<br />
He got to a stunning eight minutes - stunning for him especially - and noted he&#39;d been able to maintain a level of 6.5 on the treadmill before being forced to stop by his still lagging health. Eli then went about showering to get the stink of his exertion off of him, and that night the husband and wife consummated - with Ellenore commenting on his vigor and capability.<br />
<br />
The following mornings and days in that first week, Eli was on cloud nine - fitting then because he was regressing every day another year. He was now 35 on day 7...<br />
<br />
Day 7 was marked by Ellenore asking him if he&#39;d been using some sort of product on his face, but otherwise said little and went about going to work. Eli had been utterly confused and yet also felt a sense of arousal and readiness for a morning sexual session he hadn&#39;t felt in a while. It took a while for him to calm his desires down and looking in the mirror almost made Eli double take. <br />
<br />
His face was diminished in terms of wrinkles and his hairline which had been receding was now in a far fuller state. He ran a hand through it testing if this was even real, or a trick of the mirror. His skin still somewhat weathered and craggy was now smoother and his muscles, formerly degraded from years of unhealthy habits were restored to a luster and strength that took his breath away and hardened his cock. Eli didn&#39;t know what to do. His hands uneasily explored his hardened pecs, felt at strong, broad and wide shoulders, and felt at the abdominal shelf only barely contained behind a thin layer of fat.<br />
<br />
Eli did not know what was doing this, but he wanted it unquestionably.<br />
<br />
He also wanted himself. Despite his usual perfect time at school, Eli could not help himself but enjoy his newly rejuvenated body. His hand, wrapped around his cock, told him of returned sensitivity and sexual strength. He moaned outloud in front of the mirror and flexed an arm, delighted by the response he saw of a strong and bulky sphere of muscle, not much tone but full of strength. Laughing, Eli pumped his hips and thrust into his eager hand...<br />
<br />
Eli chuckled, he looked like some kid, desperately chasing the specter of arousal and carnal fulfillment. But it was so fitting and so arousing. The coach bit his lip and kept thrusting. This reminded him of the days in college, when he would take the tack of college experimentation - he had settled on straight, but there were a number of times he&#39;d...dithered. He remembered he and the quarterback had jerked each other off, which made Eli thrust stronger into his hand.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d never gone fully into the &quot;gay&quot; spectrum of it, only ever doing such things as that, but he didn&#39;t blame the other guys for wanting to indulge in such experimentation.<br />
<br />
Eli had also been an utter pussy hound. He remembered fucking Lina Beckett from the cheer squad under the bleachers of the stadium where he&#39;d do his best, and that memory of her taking his dick into her mouth was what finished Coach off. He moaned - almost screamed - and shot his load. His cock shuddered and spat as his balls quivered, delivering an orgasm uncommonly strong.<br />
<br />
Coach Eli however realized he was now almost crucially without time.<br />
<br />
Realizing what he&#39;d gotten caught up in doing, he quickly cleaned up the evidence of his self flagellation and got dressed, noting his clothes were tight in some places and loose in others. Eli would need to go and get some new ones if these trends kept on going. Just the idea made him chuckle to himself despite the crunch for time.<br />
<br />
Picking up his lunch bag packed by his loving wife, Eli hurried out shortly after getting his shoes on.<br />
<br />
Only barely making it within the time he needed to be there, the receptionist commented, &quot;Running close to the clock, mm Coach El---ohh, is someone taking care of themselves better these days?&quot;<br />
<br />
While he didn&#39;t take particular glee in the overweight receptionist blatantly hitting on him, her comment did make him beam a little bit in that others could very well see how strong and powerful he looked now. And this trend continued as he went about his duties. The school assistants and other teachers were very complimentary, and some of the finer teachers made Eli ponder about his faithfulness for a split second before minding that he was married.<br />
<br />
This surge and strength in his testosterone was definitely to blame. Eli went about teaching economics, the arrangement at school being that everyone even the coaches needed to have some sort of formal class they taught. And Eli was smirking the whole way through, the students probably thought he could not hear them chatting about him. The jocks in his class were in some cases jealous - jealous of HIM, their COACH! This made him turn to the side and make an effort to calm - his dick was hard again.<br />
<br />
Though it seemed some of the female students might&#39;ve seen, because another topic now circulating among them was that &quot;Coach Eli is so fine!&quot; and &quot;look at the size he&#39;s carrying!&quot; Eli being a respectable teacher would absolutely never countenance abusing his position and power as a teacher in such a way, but the fact the students were chatting about him made him both embarrassed slightly and much more feel like the stud he used to be.<br />
<br />
Beaming as he went about his daily life at school, Eli wondered if he should try and train the team in drills personally, among them like he was a footballer himself again. The idea was alluring, but he decided against it ultimately. Eli found himself having to fight off his urges to ah, take care of himself during practice, mentally noting that he was bigger than some of his athletes at this point.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, Eli thought to himself, whatever&#39;s doing this, do go on!</p>
