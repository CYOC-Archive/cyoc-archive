<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kaylee meanwhile was enjoying her day. Bart, Jenny, Kevin, and Marcy were with her and five of them were playing a series of singles tennis tournaments on her Wii. The current match up had her facing off against Marcy, while Bart, Jenny, and Kevin looked on. They cheered heavily both their mother and their sister as the two wolves moved their controllers to make the character on the screen volley the tennis ball over the net.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom is good at this, isn't she?&quot; Jenny asked as she watched Kaylee return what should have been a point for Marcy.<br />
<br />
&quot;She does have more experience,&quot; Kevin commented, &quot;She played it a lot before she become mom...&quot; Marcy easily sent the ball on the screen back toward Kaylee's character. &quot;... but I think we're pretty good too. Marcy will win for sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't count me out yet!&quot; Kaylee retorted, incensed at the challenge, &quot;I'm not old and feeble.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe we're good at this now because we're puppies now,&quot; Bart commented, &quot;Not adults.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; Jenny shrugged, &quot;Or maybe it's a gift.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin jealously eyed his sister as she was referring to the earlier video game tournament that Jenny had won. He held it as dumb luck that she had won and wanted a rematch. Of course, if they were going to do this all day, Kevin was sure to get a rematch against his sister.<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Despite only needing to take three steps, Martha was feeling worn out by Alice, Abbey, and Samantha as they moved through the mirrorverse's portrayal of a Japanese department store in Tokyo. The three blond pups enjoyed it tremendously as they played various games of dress-up, even as the reflections of real people moved through them, oblivious to existence of the mirrorverse.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think, Miss Martha?&quot; Samantha asked as she twirled around in a gold colored kimono.<br />
<br />
&quot;We might lose you in that,&quot; Martha commented, &quot;It very nearly matches your fur.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, that's why I like it!&quot; Samantha smiled and twirled around in it some more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss Martha! Sisters!&quot; came Abbey's voice, &quot;come quick!&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha rushed to where Abbey was to see the blond pup looking up at an article of clothing hanging up on the wall. Samantha followed along, at more leisurely pace and she arrived at the same time Alice did.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is that?&quot; Abbey asked.<br />
<br />
Martha looked at it and recognized it from something she had picked up after one of the click's sleepovers with Jensen while he was still Jennifer.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it's called a fuku... but I'm not sure,&quot; Martha answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where is the bottom half of it?&quot; Alice asked in amusement.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is it,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;that is all there is to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most improper,&quot; Alice answered, &quot;if they wear that, they ought to simply become like us and go naked. It would be no different then wearing such skimpy clothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do not think the idea of the outfit is... of THAT nature, Mistress Alice,&quot; Martha spoke, &quot;Although I would agree that that is the image it portrays.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where shall we go next?&quot; Samantha asked, &quot;This is fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha turned one head to see Samantha twirl more in the gold kimono she had found.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, I believe we should be getting back to the manor,&quot; Martha said after a few moments, &quot;It will be lunch time soon, and I'm sure your mothers will wish to eat with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The three blond pups looked a bit depressed at having to stop their world tour.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure we can pick up after lunch,&quot; Martha spoke and watched as the three pups wagged their tails at that.<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Zack's game of &quot;Risk&quot; was going along fairly well. He had most of Europe, North America, and all of South America. Roger controlled Africa and southern Europe. Lawrence controlled Asia and Australia. He was about to list his next attack when Beatrice came in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me, Zack, I have a message for you from the Master,&quot; Beatrice spoke calmly.<br />
<br />
All of them looked up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there something I can do for him?&quot; Zack asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He wants you to go over your &quot;transform&quot; with Alice before your parents arrive, whenever that may be,&quot; Beatrice spoke, &quot;Make sure there are no loopholes that the Game might manipulate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She isn't here right now,&quot; Zack answered, and then said in a nervous voice, &quot;and my parents will arrive to &quot;pick me up&quot; this evening. Alice won't be late will she?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn't think so,&quot; Beatrice told the charcoal black male, &quot;Not with Martha supervising... Also, and this is for all of you, that you are only to use a turn when you have the Master's permission, and you've gone over the wording with Alice. The only time you can use the game otherwise would be if someone had a gun to your head or it was the only way to save the Pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack nodded, &quot;If that is what Master says, then it is what will be done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Beatrice nodded and then turned around to continue the mission Jensen had given her.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what do plan to do with your parents?&quot; Roger asked, &quot;She wolves? Male wolves? Guardian wolf, like Mr. P... I mean he might get lonely. Gargoyle? Statue? Pup?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I had thought about a fountain for the front,&quot; Zack commented, &quot;as it had always needed a fountain, I think... but that would kill their turns unless they're made into living fountain statues to work with the gargoyles... which would be too confusing...&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack paused for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Turning them into wolves isn't really my choice,&quot; Zack then continued, &quot;I mean, I don't want to be in a position where I'd end up sexually pleasing my own relatives... that'd be disgusting...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can understand that,&quot; Roger nodded, &quot;but a little self-control can go a long way. Just because they're related to you, and you're &quot;function&quot; is to please the she-wolves, that doesn't mean that you have to do that with them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think the idea of puppies would be the best one,&quot; Pearl spoke and licked Zack's check, &quot;I can be the mother of your &quot;mother&quot; and June can be the mother of your &quot;father&quot; and you can be their parent. Just like the Master and Alpha Female are now the parents of their parents.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That does sound like a good idea,&quot; June commented, &quot;and it will give the pups some others in their own age group. I mean, Ulysses is stuck in the middle right now, but he'll mature in a few years and will likely join you three, and the gem colored males in pleasing us, but the pups are even younger. With Abbey and Samantha being the youngest. And since they are all the Master's children, they'll need someone else to be with when they mature.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You've given some thought to this?&quot; Zack questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do a lot of thinking,&quot; June answered, &quot;Mostly on trying to find a way to help you.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
In the end, Marcy did win the match between herself and Kaylee and was now taking on Bart  in the next round. Kaylee meanwhile moved to sit on the couch that Kevin and Jenny were watching from.<br />
<br />
&quot;You played quite well, mother,&quot; Jenny told her as she sat down.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I lost,&quot; Kaylee groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;But it wasn't like Marcy walked all over you,&quot; Jenny pointed out, &quot;You tied the score a couple of times.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I used to be good at this,&quot; Kaylee groaned again.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are good,&quot; Kevin told her, &quot;but you have lots of mommy things to do with daddy. Helping lead the Pack and stuff...&quot;<br />
<br />
That reminded her of how her parents had loved her and looked after her when she was Kyle. She didn't want to go back to that life, but she did have to admit that her parents loved her. Now those roles were reversed, and the pups didn't question that. It was if they enjoyed being her pups and accepted it entirely.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you don't mind that I'm usually busy with your father?&quot; Kaylee asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You do that to protect us,&quot; Bart said without taking his eyes off the game he was in.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you're playing with us now,&quot; Marcy said, &quot;and we're having fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's good then,&quot; Kaylee replied, &quot;You're having fun and you're being safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're always safe with you, mommy,&quot; Kevin told her and moved to hug Kaylee.<br />
<br />
The feel of Kevin hugging her made Kaylee's growing maternal instincts bubble over and she pulled her younger son  and her elder daughter into a tight hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you, all of you,&quot; Kaylee spoke as she began to lick the two pups she was hugging too, &quot;My precious children.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcy and Bart ended up pausing their game to join their siblings in hugging their mother. Kaylee accepted it eagerly. After all, what mother would reject the love of her children? And Kaylee loved her pups.</p>
