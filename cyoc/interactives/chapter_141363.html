<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The day started early at Fort Wolfe with Colonel Harrison finding the low ranking FBI agent actually waiting for him as he arrived to go on duty for the day. The agent seemed calm, though he was repeatedly checking his phone battery and tapping on the outside of his pants. Harrison guessed this was likely some of the pressure that dealing with the Gamboni crime family. And that was something that went a bit beyond Harrison&#39;s personal expertise with regard to law enforcement.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t that the MPs at Fort Wolfe didn&#39;t have to deal with trouble of some kind. Soldiers returning from active combat tours that hadn&#39;t been adequately treated for the stresses they went into could have trouble, there were some indications that at times among the enlisted ranks there was the presence of street gangs serving. Then of course there were some of the things one might expect, soldiers on leave enjoying their time off duty a bit too much and so on. The fact that a known mafia member had come to the base was not something that Colonel Harrison had had to deal with at Fort Wolfe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yer up awfully early,&quot; Harrison commented to the FBI agent, &quot;Ya don&#39;t think that these Gambonis will come tryin&#39; ta bust their guy out, would they?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t think so,&quot; the agent answered with a sigh, &quot;the fact that Albert Gamboni came here in the first place is a bit surprising. As while Moe Charleston has probably served service members his pizza wherever he&#39;s set up his shop... he hasn&#39;t been ON a military base and thus would have no reason to be here... even among your civilian contractors running your Commissary and PX... or the restaurants attached to it. So in that we lucked out in catching him...&quot;<br />
<br />
Harrison nodded. He could agree with that.<br />
<br />
&quot;The big thing for the moment is to get started on contacting the banks that Albert hacked,&quot; the agent answered, &quot;we don&#39;t know for sure if the Gambonis laundered their money this way... and on the surface it wouldn&#39;t look like they did... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You said it was mostly to track this Charleston, guy,&quot; Harrison commented as he opened the other door and lead the agent into the interior of the office he ran Fort Wolfe&#39;s MPs from.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is the most likely thing,&quot; the agent nodded, &quot;as Moe Charleston would HAVE to give his address to the bank in order to get the loan... but by the same token, given the laundry list of crimes that Albert Gamboni&#39;s computer hacking skills have played a role in... we also have no way of knowing for sure as to whether or not the Gambonis pulled at least some small stunt with the fact that they had somehow gained access to the bank CEO&#39;s log in information. That&#39;s why we need to contact the banks to let them get started on changing their passwords and going through their records to report anything they might find as suspicious. It&#39;d be another reason why you ought to let us take the computer to Washington where we can get more powerful computers and our own experts to break all the passwords that Albert&#39;s secured his files with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When the rest are caught, your boss... Agent Baoman does have an arrest alert for them?&quot; Harrison asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least for Marcus and Vito Gamboni,&quot; the agent sighed, getting the sense that the colonel wasn&#39;t going to budge on that point that turning over the laptop that Albert had had over to the FBI until most of the other things were finished. However, with the warnings that needed to get to the banks, there was no time for that fight. The agent simply followed Harrison as they made their way to his office. The agent saw a few MPs that were on duty salute and offer paper reports, likely updates on what had gone on over night, which was pretty standard stuff for Harrison&#39;s normal day to day work.<br />
<br />
The two settled into Harrison&#39;s office, and the agent was fairly grateful to be allowed to use Harrison&#39;s computer, though from time to time they did have to trade places so Harrison could handle his standard paperwork, but that wasn&#39;t to hard. And the agent was quick to get through to get to the page and list of banks that Albert had hacked. He started with the first one on the list that Albert had listed in his files. He could use his cellphone for that and prepared for what would amount to a great game of phone tag, as the numbers the bank&#39;s website provided wouldn&#39;t take him directly to the bank&#39;s CEO.<br />
<br />
&quot;PNC Bank Central Office, how may I help you?&quot; came a male voice from the phone&#39;s speaker.<br />
<br />
&quot;This Agent William Quizz with the FBI&#39;s computer crime department, is your CEO in today?&quot; the agent questioned as calmly as he could manage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is something wrong, sir?&quot; the secretary asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing that I can discuss with you at this time, is your CEO in today?&quot; Agent Quizz asked and then gave his &quot;badge number&quot; just to make sure that the bank secretary could confirm that the call wasn&#39;t fraudulent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on a moment, sir,&quot; came the reply, and Agent Quizz sat quietly for a few moments listening to some music while he was on hold. After a few moments a new voice came on and listed his name and office within the bank. It matched the name that Agent Quizz had been able to notice when he checked the usernames and passwords that Albert Gamboni used.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry to have to interrupt your day, sir,&quot; Agent Quizz spoke as he did hear some irritation in the man&#39;s voice, &quot;I am Agent Quizz with the FBI&#39;s computer crime department and have been assigned to serve under Agent Baoman with their organized crime department... and an investigation I&#39;ve been working on would indicate that your personal account was hacked by the Gambonis.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;The Gambonis!&quot; the bank owner gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, their tech guy was caught at Fort Wolfe in Washington State, and with him was a laptop on which he had your user name and password with regard to your accounts as the bank&#39;s owner,&quot; Agent Quizz explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did they take anything?&quot; the bank owner asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t think so, but it may be a good idea to do a couple of things,&quot; Agent Quizz answered, &quot;One would be to change your username and password. We may have Albert Gamboni, but there is no telling how much information he shared with the rest of their organization. Change your passwords and they shouldn&#39;t be able to get in. The other thing you&#39;ll need to do is go through the transactions on your end and see if anything sees abnormal to you. Also contact those that have accounts with you and ask them to double check their records and report any findings they find &quot;odd.&quot; I can give you my number and the number for the various regional offices you may need to contact directly should there be something odd that you find.&quot;<br />
<br />
The answer was affirmative and Agent Quizz gave the bank owner his number and the number of any of the other field offices that might need to be called. There was some warning to treat any alert as a possible claim and to file it as a standard report. There was also some instructions on what would potentially classify as something that would be connected to the Gambonis, and this took a little while, but Agent Quizz did his job dutifully, as it wasn&#39;t often that he was called in to help the organized crime office in the FBI and he wasn&#39;t about to do anything that would give Albert Gamboni any reason to smile.</p>
