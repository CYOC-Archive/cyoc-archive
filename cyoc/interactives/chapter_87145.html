<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I was still standing next to my chair, and I was only a few steps away from the door. I could have bolted out of there whenever I wanted and never come back. I could have just shrugged it off as some strange, vivid dream. I could even have tried to call the police or something, because surely this wasn&#39;t legal! And yet... something made me stay... At first I thought it was his magic at work again that made me stay, but then when I thought about it, no, that couldn&#39;t be it. When he turned me into a cat, I could feel a relaxing, tingling sensation come over me, and I didn&#39;t feel that right now. I figured it was just the presence of the old man that was kind of intimidating me, even though he looked so friendly and gentle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take your time,&quot; the man said with a smile and then stood up. &quot;I&#39;ll meanwhile get myself some coffee. Would you like some?&quot;<br />
<br />
My immediate reaction, knowing that this guy sold all kinds of potions, was to say &quot;No thanks!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hahaha, don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m drinking the same coffee as you would,&quot; the man said with a smile, &quot;but suit yourself.&quot; With that, he was off to the back room, leaving me alone to my thoughts.<br />
<br />
Now would have been the best chance for me to leave, without Gregory&#39;s eyes on me, but I still found myself frozen in place. I had to face it now: I was actually considering this. Why though? Was it because I needed the money? Or was it because of the job itself? People transforming into other things... and didn&#39;t he also mention some other kinds of potions? It all seemed so out of this world! But then, I thought back to what had happened only a few moments earlier, when Gregory turned me into a cat. I did have to admit... it felt pretty good. The magic working its transformation on my body felt so relaxing and tingly, and then being a cat, even for a few seconds, was also pretty fun. Okay, so I had to admit it to myself: the idea of magic was starting to interest me now, more than it scared me. Maybe if I&#39;d just buy one or two items and be done with it? That way I could experiment with this a little more, and then maybe come back here some other time as well. But then, what did the man say about me being special? What did he mean by that?<br />
<br />
&quot;So, have you made up your mind yet?&quot; I was so lost in thoughts that I hadn&#39;t even noticed that Gregory had returned with his cup of coffee.<br />
<br />
I looked at the old man once more and opened my mouth to say something, but the words simply wouldn&#39;t come.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, hang on, I got something for that,&quot; Gregory said suddenly. He stood up and went up to the wall with all of the &#39;candy&#39; jars. He took what looked like a purple gummy drop and handed it to me. &quot;Eat this, that&#39;ll help! Don&#39;t worry, it free of charge,&quot; he said, still smiling.<br />
<br />
I looked at the purple thing and was hesitant at first, but then, I was also rather curious. This was going to help? Was this going to transform me again, or was this one of the &#39;other things&#39; Gregory mentioned? After a few moments, I put it in my mouth and swallowed it. Instantly, I felt something overcome me. I looked down at my body to check, but it was still quite the same as it was before. So it wasn&#39;t a transformation at least! But then, what did happen?<br />
<br />
&quot;So, tell me now. Do you or do you not want to have a job here at my store?&quot; Gregory asked me again.<br />
<br />
Then, I felt a really weird sensation. It was as if my entire body encouraged me to tell the man the truth and nothing but the truth. It ached when I even thought about lying or hesitating. &quot;Yes, I want to work here at your store,&quot; I said without hesitation then. Right away, the sensation stopped and I felt like normal again. My eyes went wide right away when I said that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fantastic!&quot; the man said excitedly. &quot;My apologies for that. As you could probably tell, that purple pill makes you tell the truth. It&#39;s kind of like a truth serum. Don&#39;t worry, it will wear off in, oh, two days I believe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;T-Two days?!&quot; I yelled suddenly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, you won&#39;t even notice it! So long as you keep telling the truth that is, hahaha. Now, shall we finalize some things?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I.. I ... &quot; I sighed. I was doomed to speak the truth for the coming two days now. Now, I&#39;m not an avid liar or something, but occasionally, there&#39;s those moments where you tell a little white lie. Or, when mum wants me to do the laundry again, I&#39;d suddenly be &#39;preoccupied&#39;, but now, there was no way I could even attempt to think about that. &quot;Alright...&quot; I said then.<br />
<br />
&quot;Splendid! Now, first and foremost, I open my stores on weekdays from 9 AM to 5 PM, and on saturdays, from 12 PM to 6 PM. Now, I won&#39;t be requiring your help all the time of course, but since it&#39;s currently still the summervacation, I&#39;ll simply let you decide. If you want, you can just work here tomorrow for a day and see how you like it. Then you can base your future hours on that.&quot; he told me.<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds good,&quot; I said truthfully again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then, what is required of you, you might wonder. Well, at first, you&#39;ll only need to be the check-out girl. Nothing too difficult I imagine.&quot; Gregory said.<br />
<br />
&quot;At first, sir?&quot; I asked then.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, call me Greg. Sir sounds so old,&quot; he said with another chuckle, &quot;but yes, at first. I did say you were special, but you haven&#39;t seen any of that yet. let us wait until you do see that before I give you other tasks. Does that sound good?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose it does,&quot; I said. I noticed that I was a lot calmer now, after I&#39;d taken that truth pill.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent! Now then, I&#39;ll expect your arrival tomorrow morning, a little before 9. Have a good night&#39;s sleep and remember, an honest person always beats a liar!&quot;<br />
<br />
I couldn&#39;t help but chuckle at that last remark. I suppose that my situation was a little funny. &quot;Until tomorrow morning then, Greg!&quot; I said, and, rather confidently, stepped out of the store again.</p>
