<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">...his ex-girlfriend.<br />
<br />
Kathy--or Kat, as everyone used to call her--had been Jeff&#39;s first girlfriend in 8th grade. She had even been his first kiss. She was very cute with her strawberry blonde hair and piercing blue eyes. Jeff thought it had been love right up until Kat hit a sudden growth spurt leaving her with a much more mature-looking figure (her breasts had ripened like fruit almost right before Jeff&#39;s eyes) and making her a couple of inches taller than Jeff.<br />
<br />
Jeff was so fascinated by her changes that he completely missed the signs of her shopping around for a new guy until it was too late. One day, as Jeff was going to pay her a surprise visit her at her house, he saw her through the window making out with some high school sophomore on her living room couch. Jeff angrily rang the doorbell and demanded to know what was going on. Kat just said the guy was a friend and that he would be a better fit for her than Jeff, someone more mature. Jeff called her a &quot;bitch.&quot; She told him to &quot;fuck off,&quot; and sent her new boyfriend to make sure that Jeff did just that. He cried over the breakup for months, mainly because of the betrayal and the sense of inadequacy it had left.<br />
<br />
It was still a painful memory.<br />
<br />
&quot;Time for some revenge,&quot; Jeff said half smiling as he approached Kat&#39;s house with the Chronivac remote in his hand.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Jeff rang the bell, and Kat answered the door. She was even more gorgeous than Jeff had remembered. Her breasts were enormous and accentuated perfectly by the low-cut top she wore. She stood about 5&#39;6&quot; tall, and most of her height was in her long legs that she showed off with a pair of short shorts. Clearly, someone was proud of their body. Jeff smiled, he knew just what to do now.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want?&quot; she demanded coldly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you home alone?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; she said. &quot;So what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Jeff said, with mock outrage. &quot;How irresponsible of you parents to leave such an immature looking girl at home all by herself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell are you talking about?&quot; She cocked her hip to the side and rested a hand on it. It was such a sassy, sexy gesture.<br />
<br />
Jeff hit a series of buttons on his remote. &quot;I mean just look at you. You don&#39;t even look old enough for middle school.&quot;<br />
<br />
She smirked and snorted a laugh. &quot;Please, you&#39;re the only immature looking one around here. I got it where it counts.&quot; To illustrate her point she put her hands on her generous breasts and pushed them out to him. Then, she frowned. &quot;What the hell?&quot; Something felt wrong. Were they shrinking? She stared at her breasts. &quot;Impossible.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff and Kat watched as her breasts shrank in her hands like deflating balloons. &quot;Feeling a bit small today?&quot; Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell did you...?&quot; she started to say, but when she looked up at him she stopped. He was getting taller. No, she was getting shorter than him. Her clothes that had fit her so tightly just a moment ago started to sag on her as they became too big for her shrinking body. Still, she desperately clutched her disappearing breasts as if holding them could keep them from being taken away. Her short shorts slipped down her narrowing hips revealing her trimmed bush, which soon started to vanish, leaving her crotch bald, while her once curvy long legs became skinny and short.<br />
<br />
In seconds, she appeared to be a middle-school-aged girl, just in the first spurts of puberty, but even that development faded away a short while later, leaving her looking like a little girl of about 9 years old. &quot;No,&quot; she cried, and then she literally cried at hearing her voice sounding so high and young. &quot;What did you do to me?&quot; Her hands still gripped her chest, but beneath them was nothing but an empty bra covering a pair of immature nipples. The changes had stopped and she now stood a very short 4&#39;3&quot; tall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you remember how, when puberty hit, you suddenly decided that you were too good for me?&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked up at him woefully with tears dripping down her young face. &quot;I never...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Quiet! Yes, you did,&quot; Jeff said, cutting her off. &quot;Well, you see what I did here? I took away your puberty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; she said, sounding like a confused little girl. &quot;B-But, that&#39;s impossible!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t believe your own eyes? It just happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
She let her grip on her chest loosen and delicately pulled open her low-cut top to see her flat chest and pink little girl nipples under her empty bra. &quot;Y-You can&#39;t do this to me,&quot; she said as her situation became clear to her. Desperation dawned in her eyes. &quot;You&#39;re ruining my life. How they hell can I go out anywhere now looking like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s your problem,&quot; Jeff said. &quot;I guess you&#39;ll just have to get used to dating less mature-looking guys again. Actually, it might be better to avoid dating altogether. You wouldn&#39;t want to be with a guy who would find your body attractive now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat pictured her current boyfriend. She could pass for his little sister now. &quot;Please turn me back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, never,&quot; Jeff said. &quot;And, if you tell anyone about me or what happened here, I will instantly turn you into a newborn baby and leave you at that age forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her little girl eyes bugged out at that thought. &quot;You can&#39;t do that. No one can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Care to test me?&quot;<br />
<br />
She shut up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be happy that all I did was take away your puberty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; she said at last. &quot;I&#39;m stuck looking like this now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are.&quot; Jeff said. &quot;but..&quot; he added, letting the word hang for a few tantalizing seconds.<br />
<br />
&quot;&#39;But&#39; what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But, in spite of what you deserve, which is an endless girlhood, I will allow you to grow up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat looked up at him uncertainly. &quot;You will?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Jeff said. &quot;You will go through puberty again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; she said, feeling guardedly optimistic at last. &quot;Thank you for that, I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem. You see, all I did to you was change your genetic code so that your puberty will start much later than it normally would.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um... how much later?&quot; She asked, feeling worry creeping in.<br />
<br />
&quot;About ten years later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ten years?&quot; She was shocked.<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;B-But, that would mean I won&#39;t go through puberty until I&#39;m almost 22!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God!&quot; she looked ready to faint.<br />
<br />
&quot;On top of that I have temporarily retarded your normal physical growth so that you will only grow a year older over a period of five years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You see, you will still look like a little girl for the next five years or so until puberty hits you again in your early 20s. Then, you will grow normally again. You&#39;ll get to experience all of the joys of adolescence once again: your first surprise period, the growing pains, those awkward uneven growth spurts, acne... you know, the works.&quot;<br />
<br />
She stared off into space, remembering all of the tortures and awkward moments that had come with puberty. And, now she would have to experience them all over again. &quot;This can&#39;t be happening.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, since your puberty will be hitting you later and your growth has slowed so much, you probably won&#39;t grow up as much as you did before. But, hey, you might be almost 5 feet tall when it&#39;s done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Five feet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you&#39;re lucky. It kind of sucks being a late bloomer. Believe me. I had to deal with it myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This can&#39;t be happening.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You keep saying that, but, in fact, it is happening. Get used to it. Oh, and don&#39;t bother with hormone treatments or any other medical procedures. I&#39;ve set it so that they won&#39;t work on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
She started to cry again silently.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Jeff said in an upbeat voice. &quot;Cheer up. At least this time through you&#39;ll be mature enough mentally to deal with the experience. Hell, you&#39;ll be in college by then. Just imagine what fun you&#39;ll have while your college girl friends go out parting all night long, flirting with frat boys, and having casual one night stands. You won&#39;t have to deal with all of that nonsense, none of those distractions for you. Instead, you&#39;ll be back in your dorm room studying and trying on training bras. And, imagine the money you&#39;ll save by shopping in the girls section.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat sobbed like a lost little girl. &quot;Y-You m-monster!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I learned from the best,&quot; Jeff said. &quot;You taught me so much about causing pain. I thought I would return the favor. Now, I&#39;m going to head off. Remember, don&#39;t tell anyone about me, or it&#39;s diapers and baby bottles for the rest of your life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What will I tell everyone then? How can I explain this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff turned and started to walk away. &quot;I don&#39;t care. Make up anything you want, but leave me out of it. Well, bye now, enjoy the rest of high school as a little girl. Try not to get stepped on in the halls.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff walked away down to the street. He turned around for a second to see poor Kat standing there in the door, looking for all the world like a little girl playing dress up in her older sister&#39;s too large clothes. It was both an adorable and pathetic sight. &quot;Boo!&quot; he said, and she gasped and fell over backwards onto her skinny little butt. She shrieked and kicked the door shut.<br />
<br />
Jeff smiled. He turned from Kat&#39;s house and walked down the street.</p>
