<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had only been a few days since Lisa and Vlad had become &quot;reacquainted&quot; with another that Lisa was beginning to finally feel like she was at home. She and Vlad had also begun to dress like the other members of her new family and wore a blue retta Victorian dress. Vlad had gone off to give Wyatt some political advice at a meeting for the day leaving her to wander the manor by herself. As she was going down the hallway, she saw a portrait that was getting the frame redone by the staff and she saw that the painted portrait contained Wyatt, Kyra, and their children. Lisa gave a small smile at the portrait and couldn&#39;t help but think how different things had been had she not become the monster she did. As she was wiping the tears away from her eyes, she suddenly felt a little tug at the end of her dress. Looking down, she saw one of the boys looking up at her with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hello there. Now, which one are you? You&#39;re not your rascally brother Duncan, are you....Andrew?&quot; Lisa guessed as the boy shook his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;No? Then you must be...Brendan. Where are your brothers and sisters?&quot; Lisa asked as Brendan excitedly pulled Lisa&#39;s arm wanting her to follow him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, alright, I&#39;ll follow you.&quot; Lisa said as Brendan followed him into what looked like the children&#39;s bedroom. She saw the children were not alone as Hanako, Sasha, and Cheyenne were also there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, welcome to our little party. I see Brendan found you and dragged you here. Dromy found me and brought me in here.&quot; Sasha said as she mussed up Andromeda&#39;s hair and she giggled happily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Andrew brought me in here, I initially said no, but then he looked like he was going to cry, so I had to come in here.&quot; Hanako explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;As for me, I was watching the children by myself today. Duchess and Cassandra were going &#39;out on the town today&#39; as it were so the children wanted to bring you in here to play with them.&quot; Cheyenne explained.<br />
<br />
Lisa sat down with the others while the children played. Andromeda and Nyx wanted to put makeup on Sasha, and while Sasha rolled her eyes, she complied with the young girls. Andrew wanted Hanako to play with his toy soldiers, which she didn&#39;t mind doing, while Brendan wanted Lisa to read a book. Cheyenne was helping Duncan build a tower, then proceeded to knock it down finding it funny to him while Cheyenne shook her head at the boy not understanding his sense of humor. The children were all having a good time with the women, but eventually it was time for their lunch, followed by their nap. Duncan was the hardest to put to sleep, but eventually he himself got tired and drifted off to sleep like the others.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, how I missed this. I never really got much of a chance to spend time with Bastion before....everything happened, so this was pleasant.&quot; Lisa sighed, she then looked at Hanako and Sasha and realized despite being part of her family, she really hadn&#39;t gotten to know them that well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hanako, do you have anyone special in your life? Maybe there&#39;s someone here in the manor you have your eye on?&quot; Lisa teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, I don&#39;t need a partner of any sort. I&#39;d sooner marry little Ann then be married to anyone in this manor.&quot; Hanako said.<br />
<br />
Far away in a field, Little Ann was feasting on some sheep when she suddenly stopped and looked around in confusion, then shrugged it off as she went back to devouring the sheep.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about you, Sasha, right? How have you adjusted being married into the family?&quot; Lisa asked Sasha who blushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, actually, Duke and I are just dating right now. No wedding plans yet, heck, I don&#39;t even know if I want a kid yet.&quot; Sasha answered as little Andromeda yawned while adjusting in her sleep to lay in Sasha&#39;s lap.<br />
<br />
&quot;But these kids are definitely making me rethink that.&quot; Sasha said.<br />
<br />
&quot;They have become my entire world.&quot; Kyra said as she now entered the room. Cheyenne gave a polite bow as Kyra waved her off. She also noticed that Lisa was cradling Nyx in her arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see your motherhood traits haven&#39;t been forgotten.&quot; Kyra complimented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I was a mother once upon a time. You certainly had your hands full here, all five of them, I&#39;m very surprised.&quot; Lisa said as she handed Nyx over to Kyra and cradled her in her arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes...I would&#39;ve been satisfied with only one. But I was...blessed with five lovely offspring.&quot; Kyra said as Nyx groggily opened her eyes to see her mom holding her and gave a little smile before falling back asleep. Kyra then gently kissed Nyx on the forehead and lay her down in her bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come, I wish to speak to you, alone. Wyatt suggested I get to know my in-law.&quot; Kyra motioned for Lisa to follow while the others watched as the other kids began to sleep.<br />
<br />
Lisa followed Kyra down the hall of the manor as they saw the staff still at work rebuilding what had been ruined beforehand. Lisa then realized that in all the time she had &quot;known&quot; Kyra, she had never actually gotten to know her at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;I never did get to ask how you and Wyatt became involved with each other. I suppose you both met in school.&quot; Lisa guessed.<br />
<br />
&quot;We did actually, only a few years ago. It was during a time when Wyatt and I had....different goals to achieve then. Wyatt&#39;s family were more willing to become part of his new family than mine were.&quot; Kyra said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, do you know what did ever happen to your own immediate family?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I initially thought about taking revenge on them for....abusing me for most of my life.&quot; Kyra said as she clenched her hand into a fist.<br />
<br />
&quot;However, I gave them the gift of becoming vampires instead. After we moved overseas, I didn&#39;t hear from my parents, however I did find out from a source that my father died whilst my former mother has rejected her old name and gone to serve Lady Roseblood. Though, I could care less what happens to her with Lady Roseblood. She could be dead by her ladyship or lie naked in bed with her, I don&#39;t care. My family is with Wyatt and you of course. How did you ever meet Vlad, I know he must&#39;ve been quite the recluse.&quot; Kyra now asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He was actually. In a way, I suppose like you and Wyatt, I felt a friendship with him when I first went to meet him. Women were thought to be nothing but witches back in the days if they learned natural medicine. After Vlad and I married, I thought life might become a little easier, but it was nothing but hardship after the children. If my mind hadn&#39;t been lost when Vlad turned me, I wish I could&#39;ve been more like you.&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. Look at what you&#39;ve come from. You came from practically nothing, are running an entire country with the man you love and have five beautiful children from your marriage. In a strange way, you and Wyatt are what I wish Vlad and I had been. Kyra, you deserve what you&#39;ve been given. You have earned the name, Lady Kyra Tepes.&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think many including myself actually owe you a great debt we can never repay. You may not know it, but Wyatt and I studied his family history. Nothing had been written about you turning into a vampire, but when I read about your own devotion to Dracula and how you brought him back into the world he once turned away, I guess before I even knew you, I wanted to live up to being as great as he had written about you in his diaries.&quot; Kyra said as she now held Lisa&#39;s hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose this means I&#39;m forgiven then?&quot; Lisa asked rhetorically as Kyra chuckled.<br />
<br />
They both then turned to see their respective partners coming to greet them. Wyatt and Vlad had finished with their meeting and both kissed their partners with the two women smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;The children are still taking a nap my lord, I&#39;d say a little wine wouldn&#39;t hurt before they wake.&quot; Kyra said as Wyatt smiled and took his wife&#39;s arm and they made their way towards the dining area.<br />
<br />
&quot;Vlad, Lisa, won&#39;t you two join us?&quot; Wyatt asked as Vlad and Lisa looked at each other and smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;It would be our honor, Lord and Lady Tepes.&quot; Vlad said as he and Lisa followed behind them.</p>
