<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>AndreaFlameFox is to thank for the proofreading of this path. ;)<br/>

<br/>
<i>(Bracketed italic text indicates internal thoughts)</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>Non-bracketed italic text indicates mental influences & suggestions.</i></div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Having put some space in between herself & her family, the initially cheeky facade of herself that she had portrayed to her family was dropped, with her original state of mind gaining back some of its lost ground. Despite the induced lusts that came from stroking her new vulpine prick, the worries that she had about her new form couldn&#39;t simply just be stroked away.<br />
<br />
<i>(Mmph….W-wait, this isn&#39;t who I am!)</i> The hot pink fox thought to herself. <i>(I&#39;m not supposed to be some kind of fox: I don&#39;t even remotely like pink!)</i> She was someone that likes dark colors & goth bands, someone that was against the pretty fairy tales that the mainstream churned out, someone that detested being happy because it showed naiveness.<br />
<br />
…So then why did she initially accept her new body so easily?<br />
<br />
The thoughts that ran in her head conflicted with each other, as memories of her actual life were being contested with the memories of being a rubbery fox instead, and that was on top of the existential problems that she was feeling right now: It was all giving her a mild headache. She needed a distraction from her looming thoughts, something that she could do in the meantime, or finding something that could help with dealing with what was in her head right now.<br />
<br />
<i>(....I need to distract myself: Maybe I can find something here that could help with that…)</i> Debra thought to herself, the absentminded strokings of her lengthy prick doing little to resolve her current predicament, nor were the idle gropings of her own pairs of breasts.<br />
<br />
As she wandered around the military compound, her mind started to wander off as to why they left in such a hurry, with some of the abandoned barracks that she entered containing various supplies that were left behind. Rarely anything, however, stood out in the quick searches that she did in those barracks: Other than the occasional misplaced key (all of which she decided to take with her), there was nothing that piqued her interest.<br />
<br />
As the lights around the compound came on, her eyes soon landed on a series of sheds marked as &quot;Storage&quot;, followed by an ascending number for each successive shed. <i>(Score!)</i> was her first thought, as she opened the first shed in front of her, the door opening as it was unlocked. She thought that she was going to finally find something cool within this compound, but unfortunately, it was a food supply storage shed: The vacuum-sealed military rations stacked on the shelves around her were nothing to cry home about, as they had supposed expiration dates that were years from now.<br />
<br />
<i>(Okay… this shed was a bust: Maybe one of the other sheds could hold something that&#39;s actually worthwhile.)</i><br />
<br />
<br />
…They couldn&#39;t all be just duds, right?<br />
<br />
<br />
The next few sheds were also unlocked, just like the first shed. <i>(They must&#39;ve left in a hurry…)</i>, she thought to herself as she was repeatedly met with slim pickings within each of them, just like the first shed:<br />
<br />
The second storage shed was recorded by the shed&#39;s written logs to have held military garments for the compound, but the entire shed was effectively barren, save for the plastic bags that the garments were wrapped in. <br />
<br />
The third & fourth storage sheds supposedly held military equipment & the ammo for said equipment, but like the second shed, it was stripped bare, with nothing left behind.<br />
<br />
The fifth & sixth sheds were, however, locked. Thankfully though, one of the keys that she had looted from the barracks was able to unlock the padlock that secured their doors. Checking the log books within the aforementioned storage sheds, they were recorded to have respectively held cleaning & hygienic supplies for the entire compound: It was decided that they would be left behind, as evident by the fact that some of the shelves were still stocked. Taking one of the basketball-sized empty boxes that occupied some of the lower shelves, some of the remaining toiletries were taken off of the shelves in the 6th shed.<br />
<br />
<i>(At least it&#39;s better than nothing…)</i>, Debra thought to herself as she took the box out of the 6th shed with her.<br />
<br />
Upon arriving at the seventh shed, the immediate difference that she had noticed was that it was at least twice as large as the other sheds, and that there weren&#39;t any windows along the sides of it. Further surprises awaited her when she went up to the door on her right, where instead of a lock being used to secure the shed&#39;s door, it was instead secured by an electronic lock, with the lock&#39;s display requiring a 9-digit access code to unlock it. <br />
<br />
<i>(...Shit, and I haven&#39;t seen any codes for this.)</i>, she thought to herself as she approached the lock, finding that it wouldn&#39;t budge upon trying to turn its handle. A series of attempts were subsequently made on the access code, using common sequences, with each one returning a sharp beep and a red light, signaling an invalid code. With each one, a sense of dread began to loom over her head once again, as the thoughts of being locked out of something that could potentially help with her predicament incrementally fueled more attempts at the digital lock.<br />
<br />
Unbeknownst to the brightly-colored vulpine, her aura began to warp the lock&#39;s internal memory just a little bit, so that upon her next guess at the combination, the access code that she punched in was coincidentally the correct sequence needed to unlock the door: 698008135. The emitted green light & chirp-like beep caused her to sigh with relief, turning its handle and opening the door in front of her, her head poking in to assess the shed&#39;s contents.<br />
<br />
What was revealed garnered a sense of awe from the vulpine, as it appeared that this shed housed both the chemicals & parts used by the labs for their research & prototypes, as well as said resulting prototypes from the researchers. The shed was divided into 2 sections, with one marked for &quot;Supplies&quot;, whilst the other half was marked for &quot;Results&quot;. Various large & detailed warning signs were hung on the sides of the shelves, and on some of the walls of the large shed. <br />
<br />
Pacing around the room once over, the vulpine noticed that some of the shelves were more akin to sliding cupboards with a metal shelf base, with transparent sliding doors allowing anyone to see the chemicals & concoctions housed within them. The other shelves meanwhile had no such housing, packed to the brim with sealed flasks & glass containers containing a slew of labeled chemicals, with each label handwritten for that chemical&#39;s housing, along with the occasional packet of labeled powder. <br />
<br />
Aside from the beakers & flasks that were left behind, nothing that was considered interesting to the herm fox could be found, with the closest being a wrapped packet of dried powder, labeled for future use in the research & development of an &quot;aphrodisiac-based distraction agent&quot;. <br />
<br />
Scanning the wall-covering shelves in the &quot;Results&quot; section, she noticed a flask whose label had the word &quot;reversal&quot; written on it, hidden in the back of one of the lower shelves. <i>(...No way, is that what I think it is?)</i> She thought to herself, it would take some effort, but if she wanted some way to get out of her current predicament, <i>she couldn&#39;t let this opportunity go.</i></p>
