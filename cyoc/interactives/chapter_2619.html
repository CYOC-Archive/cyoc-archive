<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ben looked at his choices for age. &quot;I think I'll make myself younger. Not really ready to go forward just yet. But how old?&quot; He gave it a bit more thought. &quot;Well, I'll still have my 34 yo mind and emotions. Let's give this thing a real test!&quot; With that, Ben entered the number 1 in the box next to the Regress button. He pressed that button and immediately felt the now-familiar tingling sensation in the pit of his stomach. This time, however, the feeling spread quickly throughout his entire body. It was like a warm wave that started from his abs and went all the way to the ends of his body. 
<br />

<br />
&quot;What a feeling! It's better than when my dick went huge and down to a nub,&quot; Ben exclaimed. His body reacted with another hard-on. His body hair felt like static was making it stand on end. It was then Ben decided to check himself in the mirror. He went back through his bedroom and to the bathroom mirror. &quot;Whoah!&quot; Ben screamed. The reflection in the mirror was changing right before his eyes. &quot;I can't be even 30 years old right now.&quot;
<br />

<br />
It was exactly like the male morph in the homepage that introduced Ben to Major Changes. His skin was moving like running water as Ben bagan to grow younger. He watched in fascination, yet again, as he went from 30 yo to 25. Ben marvelled as his muscles gain a little mass and his hair darken a bit. His 5 o'clock was fading away, too. &quot;This is incredible! I look like I did when I got out of college,&quot; he said to himself with a thrill. &quot;But I'm getting even younger.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Sure enough, Ben lost another four years. He was now looking more like a freshman than a graduate. It was then when Ben noticed that his silk boxers were a little loose around his waist. &quot;Wow! I'm losing weight now... and muscles, too!&quot; He also noticed that his voice had gain a little higher pitch. &quot;I'm actually getting younger,&quot; Ben said to his reflection in the mirror. &quot;I mean, my body is getting younger. My mind and emotions are still the same.&quot;
<br />

<br />
As Ben turn to go back into the dining room and his laptop, he realized something for the first time in years. He had to pull his boxers up to keep them from slipping off. &quot;I'll try to keep these on as long as I can,&quot; Ben chuckled to himself. &quot;This is SO neat!!&quot;
<br />

<br />
Ben walked back through his apartment to rejoin his computer. All the while, he kept growing younger at a steady pace. By the time he reached his laptop, Ben could tell that he was beginning to enter puberty again. Only this time, it was in reverse. When he looked at the screen, the number at the top was at 17. But the 7 was morphing into a 6. &quot;16 years old! I'm about to lose my driver's license!&quot; Ben shouted with glee. It was the first time his voice cracked during this change. &quot;Cool!&quot;
<br />

<br />
The silk boxers Ben had on were definitely becoming a bit cumbersome. He knew he'd have to hold them up. He took his right hand and bunched up part of the waist band in it. &quot;Maybe this will keep them up for a little bit,&quot; the now-14 year Ben observed. He noticed that the hair on his chest were starting to disappear. No...not disappear. The hair was sinking back into his ever-youthening chest. Ben's height was beginning to diminish more, going from over 6' to nearly below 5' now. &quot;I'm getting smaller now. These boxers are getting huge on me!&quot;
<br />

<br />
Reducing in age to 12 years old, most of Ben's body hair had retracted back into his body. He pulled his adult boxers' waistband and saw something he had not seen in many years. Ben's cock was in plain sight. There was no pubic hair anywhere around it. It was still hard from the feeling of change and the sexual excitement he also felt with this new experience. &quot;I wonder if I'll stay hard as I get younger?&quot; Ben, the now 10 year old boy questioned. 
<br />

<br />
He looked back at the computer as the number changed from 10 to 9. Ben felt the change more prevalent. It also seem to be going a bit faster. It was long before Ben was below 4 feet tall and smooth as a little boy should be. He started holding up his silk boxers with both hands. He walked around the apartment, getting used to his ever-reducing size. The more he walked around, the more voluminous his boxers got. By the time he got back to the computer on the dining room table, Ben could barely see over the table. &quot;I'm getting too small to see how old I am. Do I get up on the chair or stay here on the floor?&quot; 
<br />

<br />
With that question, Ben felt another wave come over him. Within moments, he went from a six year old boy to a three year old toddler. He was showing signs of baby fat in his once-awesome adult abs. His hands were getting chubby, as were his feet. He noticed that he was having trouble keeping up his now-oversize silk boxers and remain standing, as well. Ben felt his baby teeth in his mouth for the first time. As well he should, because they were sinking back into his gums. &quot;I butter let goo of dis 'oxers, for I fall dow.&quot; Ben didn't even realize his speech was becoming more difficult. So was control of his movements. He was swaying more and more, as the final wave hit him. 
<br />

<br />
It was a doozie, too. Ben's hair sank back into his head until there was nothing but a little wisp of dirty blonde. His hands becoming unmanagable, which allowed the boxers to fall their short trip to the floor. Ben's legs becoming too young to hold his weight of a one year old baby boy. He fell to the floor and began to crawl out of his boxers. The baby fat increased more, making Ben a pudgy little infant. &quot;This is wonderful!&quot; Ben tried to yell out. But all that came out was gurgles, coos and a baby boy's laugh. It caught him completely offguard.</p>
