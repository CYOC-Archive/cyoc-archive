<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt's changes were becoming more noticeable as Ty anxiously watched. Matt continued to unconsciously scratch; Matt’s shirt was stretching across his body tightly, and revealed his stomach. Thin hair was forming a small trail from his pants and was sprinkled around his belly button. Ty glanced at the clock as he grew more excited. <br />
<br />
Ty noticed Matt was unconsciously continuing to pull his shirt down trying to pull the tight fabric over his revealed skin. Matt shifted uncomfortably and shuffled his feet. His pants were too short, and ended some inches above his ankle, showing his legs which were originally covered with some light brown hair, was now denser and brown.<br />
<br />
Matt then raised his hand and called out, &quot;Mr. Stiel, may I go to the bathroom?&quot; Ty, not wanting to miss out on what would happened made a wish for Mr. Stiel to say, &quot;No, Matt I'm on a role right now, you can't afford to miss this information.&quot; There, thought Ty, I won't miss anything now.<br />
<br />
Matt, looking very disappointed, picked up his pencil and began to doodle, but appeared more to be like careless scribbles. Matt shirt was now ridding up his arm as if he tried to roll up his sleeves to make a tank top. Matt's biceps were much larger and had some definite definition. The hair on matt's arms was darker, and was beginning to sprinkle on his hands.<br />
<br />
Ty looked up at Matt to ask him something to see if Matt had noticed the change and to see how deep his voice had gotten, but Ty noticed not only had Matt's hair grown much darker, but Mark had thin sideburns that thinned out and disappeared as they began to reach his cheeks. What was once only peach fuzz over his lips was now colored, and the beginning of a goatee was pushing out from Matt's chin. His face was more mature, including a sharper jaw.<br />
<br />
Ty thought Matt was definitely at least 18, and was maturing into his twenties. Matt's tight shirt was straining to hold on to Matt's chest which had pushed out alot since Ty last looked, and was very defined. Ty even noticed some dark hair stringing out of Matt's shirt on his chest.<br />
<br />
Matt then raised his hand again looking desperately to the teacher. with Mat's arm raised Ty could see Matt's large and muscled arms, with  a new coating of hair. Ty could even see Matt's armpit which had a bush of hair. Ty decided to let Matt go this time, and Mr. Stiel let Matt go as long as he would be back in 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
The five minutes went slow, and Ty shuffled in his chair awaiting Matt to return. The other students were letting on a dull whisper, probably talking about Matt, Ty guessed.<br />
<br />
Matt stepped into class again, but was wearing his jacket, in an attempt to cover his tight shirt. Matt seemed very tall now that ty could see him standing, ty guessed he was about 6'3.Matt's shoulders had broadened out, and you could see matt's arms bulging in the smaller jacket. Matt's pants looked tight, and seemed to barely reach past matt's knees. Matt's hairy, but chisled calves were plainly visible. the dull murmer in the class seemed to rise. ass Matt sat down, ty heared a soft tear.<br />
<br />
Matt's sideburns looked fuller, and now Matt had Dark hair all over his cheeks as if he was trying to grow a beard. Matt's chin was completely covered with a much thicker goatee which was now streached to meet his mustach, and was growing out to outling his defined jaw.<br />
<br />
matts Jacket was even getting too tight, and Matt began too pull down the zipper to loosen it, and Ty is able to see Matt's bare chest. it was blanketed with a soft layer of dark hair, and Defined, leading to a six pack. Matt then noticed his shirt had ripped off and saw his used-to-be bare chest....</p>
