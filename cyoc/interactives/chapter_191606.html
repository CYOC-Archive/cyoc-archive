<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I&#39;m kinda hungry,&quot; Sachiko said. &quot;What about you Raiden?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A little,&quot; Raiden said softly. Sachiko smirked, looking over her friends. &quot;Lets get some milkshakes!&quot;<br />
<br />
As Sachiko and her friends now made their way towards the Soul Drive diner, Darren began to walk towards Yurikos home.<br />
<br />
Since Darren had begun lessons with Fukushu, he had found Yuriko to be distant. The elderly wizard, despite her best efforts, was unhappy with Darren&#39;s truce. Today the young Catalyst would learn about the history between the wizards and the rogue kitsune.<br />
<br />
Knocking on Yuriko&#39;s door, Darren waited patiently for the elderly wizard. As she now opened the door, she gave him the same warm smile he had grown accustomed too. &quot;Hello Darren.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ms. Yuriko can we talk?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Yuriko said quickly. Darren nodded as the two made their way into Yurikos living room. As they did Darren paused, he had never really looked at any of the pictures she had.<br />
<br />
Glancing at the photos, Darren could see pictures of Yuriko throughout the years. A family photos from her childhood, a picture with Akira and Ayami when she graduated from college, a photo with her two slightly older adults Darren didn&#39;t recognize, even a wedding photo.<br />
<br />
&quot;My husband,&quot; Yuriko stated. Darren nodded, studying the photo carefully. Yuriko was stunning in her wedding gown. Akira and Ayami standing beside her, along with the two adults Yuriko was unfamiliar with. &quot;And those were my godparents,&quot; Yuriko smiled. &quot;Mia and Zack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What were they like,&quot; Darren asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very kind,&quot; Yuriko said. &quot;And very protective. My husband, Ben poor thing, first time I introduced him to my family Mia and Zack practically interrogated him. It didn&#39;t help Zack was in werewolf form. Needless the say he passed the test.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren chuckled, trying to picture what it must have been like being interviewed by a werewolf. &quot;So what was Ben like,&quot;Darren asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ben was more traditional than I was,&quot; Yuriko chuckled. &quot;He was a first generation American. When he introduced me to his family they were a bit taken back. A girl with a Japanese name that was way, way too American and opinionated. Still, I loved him, he was my rock. The one who would calm me down when I went off the rails.&quot;<br />
<br />
A sad sigh now escaped Yurikos lips as she gently touched her wedding photo. &quot;I&#39;m sorry Ms. Yuriko,&quot; Darren said softly. A pause now lingered as Darren tried to form his next question. &quot;It was Evan wasn&#39;t it.&quot; Yuriko simply nodded. &quot;How did Evan go dark?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yuriko sighed, motioning towards the couch as the two wizards now sat down. &quot;Evan path towards darkness was slow and gradual.&quot; Darren now listened as Yuriko told the history of Evan&#39;s decent into darkness.<br />
<br />
By the time Evan Harris had graduated college, everyone realized he was perhaps the strongest wizard in existence. With that power came arrogance on the boys part. He believed he could do no wrong, and eventually his arrogance led to him making a fatal mistake.<br />
<br />
&quot;When Evan was 24 he began accompanying his Uncle and his cousin when they hunted,&quot; Yuriko stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hunted,&quot; Darren asked. &quot;Hunting what, deer?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Demons,&quot; Yuriko said. &quot;Vampires, monsters of all kinds. Caleb Moreland, Evans uncle, was a Demon Hunter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren gawked at this bit of information as Yuriko went into detail. The Moreland family were Demon Hunters. Caleb had fallen in love with Lynne&#39;s older sister Gloria, eventually marrying the girl. Uncle Caleb became everybody&#39;s favorite uncle. Caleb was kind, strong, funny, and easy to talk with. Combine that with an exciting job and it was no surprise that all the children of Yuriko&#39;s generation wanted to be around him.<br />
<br />
&quot;He even trained by cousin Aaron,&quot; Yuriko added. &quot;The Kintaro you met in the Kitsune kingdom. Aaron was Calebs apprentice, trained in the ways of Demon hunting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what happened to Caleb?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Caleb was getting old,&quot; Yuriko sighed. &quot;He was 70 when he went on his last hunt. Gloria was getting aggravated by her husband&#39;s profession. She wanted him to settle down, to turn the responsibility over to Aaron or their son. Caleb was stubborn though, hunting was in his blood. Instead, he relented and began letting our children accompany him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yuriko&#39;s shoulder slumped, the memory obviously causing her sadness. The elderly wizard now told the her story. Caleb, Aaron, Evan, and Calebs son David had gone with him as he looked to clear out a nest of vampires. The vampire, Wyatt, had amassed a sizable army that should have been easily taken care of. Evan though was cocky, he didn&#39;t take direction well, and it almost killed him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wyatt and a few other vampires got the drop on Evan,&quot; Yuriko said sadly. &quot;Caleb and David moved in to help. Evan though was too stubborn, too proud to ask for help. Instead he cast a spell, which leveled the building and created a crevice about 100 feet deep.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yuriko wiped her eyes, sighing sadly, as she continued. Evan had destroyed the vampires but he had put Caleb and David in danger. Both hunters were clinging to the wall, but Caleb knew this was the end for him. He had asked Evan to save his son though, if for no other reason than to spare Gloria from having to bury both a husband and son.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what happened,&quot; Darren asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Evan saw a surviving vampire attempting to escape,&quot; Yuriko replied. &quot;Evan thought he could destroy the vampire and still save his cousin. He was wrong. David and Caleb died.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren listened as Yuriko spoke of what happened next. Gloria was heartbroken, especially when she learned that her own nephew had failed to save her husband and son. Righ or wrong she blamed him, it didn&#39;t help that Evan felt he had done the right thing or that Lynne defended her son, causing a rift to form between the sisters.<br />
<br />
&quot;After that things began to fall apart,&quot; Yuriko said quietly. &quot;And your....new friend only exasperated that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What did Fukushu do,&quot; Darren asked, noting the bitter tone in Yuriko&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fukushu could sense the darkness within Evan,&quot; Yuriko stated. &quot;He began to infiltrate his dreams, sabotage whatever he did, allow resentment to fester with the boy. Evan, thanks to Fukushu&#39;s magic, believed everyone was against him. Eventually he snapped.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I heard him say something about  Claudia,&quot; Darren said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Yuriko nodded. &quot;He killed Claudia, made it look like Evan had done it. Mika, Claudia&#39;s wife went mad, attacked Evan. She would have killed him too if not for Lynne&#39;s interference. Instead, Evan took Mikas life, and forever turning towards darkness.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren was silent, gazing at Yuriko who had dug her nails into the arm of her couch. &quot;Darren,&quot; she said. &quot;I know that you are trying to find the good in Fukushu. I know you have made progress, however, I do not know if I can forgive him. His actions have killed my friends, my family, and even my husband.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry Ms. Yuriko,&quot; Darren said softly. &quot;I understand that by training with Fukushu I&#39;ve hurt you. I can&#39;t begin to know how you feel. I just need you to trust me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dont worry Darren,&quot; she smiled. &quot;I may not always agree with you but I will always trust you.&quot;</p>
