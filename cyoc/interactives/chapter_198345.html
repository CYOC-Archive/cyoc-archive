<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Two African American women were sitting across from them.<br />
<br />
Michelle, formerly answering to Chief before deciding her career interest lay elsewhere after the shard’s destruction, trilled with laughter and waved the suggestion away. “And get between the pair of you lovebirds writhing around in the water? I’ll have to preen and dry my feathers for hours afterwards to sort out the mess. No thank you,” the harpy mock complained in a richly lyrical singsong voice only slightly slurred by the beer they had lured her here with in exchange for sneaking away from the paprazzi. “...no need to look so disappointed, Ssokha. Me, Trinity, your cock, can still enjoy ourselves.” She downed the last of the beer inside the can before throwing it aside. “Still haven’t eaten my sausage yet.”<br />
<br />
Trinity could see the effort she had put in to dress up even for the short camping trip as she rose; a little envious of how quickly Michelle had taken to things after living for decades as a gruff old man. Just her makeup was stunning. But the swamp dragoness didn’t have long to look as with a glance from the harpy, Trinity slithered around and onto her knees before the were-reptile. Face-to-face with his crotch and cloaca waiting for his cock to spring forth fully erect and ready. She craned her neck, tilting her nuzzle upward as Michelle joined them on her knees. The two women couldn’t be much more different in appearance, but both possessed a lustful hunger visible in their eyes and jockeyed for position. The dragoness some-time lover reached out with a hand to gently stroke her scales, sending shivers down her ridged spine and let out a low rumble that meant he was ready–<br />
<br />
“Oh my fucking gods! I didn’t think you’d actually do it!” Trinity snapped her neck toward her sister that had her face buried in her hands on the other side of the burn barrel, desperately trying to avoid watching what was happening. Yet as the slick sounds of Michelle taking the alligator’s member into her mouth suddenly split her attention between keeping both her eyes and ears covered and made a mess of the attempt. It split Trinity’s too, but she kept her eyes on her younger sister. Her still human sister. “Ugh, I’ll be waiting the car!”<br />
<br />
Serenity had missed the wave by a handful of minutes while driving home. While months ago Trinity remembered how secretive she had been during the call the day before the day of the event about her first archaeological find. It had been one of the magical shards, a smaller one that now hung unbroken around her neck. Kinda ruined it by breaking a massive one, Trinity supposed.<br />
<br />
“Let her be. She still wears her false skin and doesn’t understand.” The harshness coming from Ssokha’s tone didn’t surprise the amazon, those kinds of thoughts had been building every since he converted, but it still gnawed at her. But his hands were still just as gentle as before as he coaxed the dragoness back and she let her love and desire for him fill her and the rest to pass.<br />
<br />
The pair of winged hands, one feathered and slender, one scaled and muscular fought for space to caress the stiff shaft. Curved, bulbous, greyish-white, with a head that seemed to open like a maw, and massive enough to fill even her draconic pussy. Nothing about it was human, not least the pleasure it gave. Trinity slid out her tongue, coiling it around its width and slathering her saliva around the thick mass of collagen. <br />
<br />
Michelle took the opportunity to tend to the head with long and languid strokes before it was soaked and glistening. The harpy’s open mouth and lolling tongue made Ssokha shudder when swallowed and pushing past her lips. Trinity withdrew, turning her attention lower and toward the base, the same enthusiasm guiding her as she firm grip around his scales. Michelle gagged and hacked when the head pushed against her palettes and throat. She still had several inches left and eager to let her former Chief taste the entire length, the dragoness moved behind her. The reaction when she hissed and promised to help wasn’t as strong as when she did it to Ssokha, but she could still feel the harpy’s heart skipping a beat and skin flush.<br />
<br />
Despite telling them otherwise, Michelle was now surrounded and enveloped in scales, and letting her hand roam down and past her soft and dark-skinned stomach Trinity could also feel her wetness when Michelle clenched her pussy around one of her claws. Uncoiling her neck, the dragoness reached up with it to kiss the were-alligator, sharing a private moment just the two between them. When breaking it, Michelle had had a finger half-buried inside her for several tens of seconds; she was squirming and asking for more. “How about it, man? Think you can turn her into a reptile slut?”<br />
<br />
Michelle played along, her insulting grunts, that still managed to sound melodic even with her mouth full, were followed muffled comments that neither of them paid attention to. “Think she’d lay cockatrice eggs?” Asked Ssokha. Trinity shrugged and she gently held the harpy’s hair feathers with her wing arms.<br />
<br />
She was skilled, more than the harpy had let on as her head bobbed up and down the were-alligator’s length with the dragoness’ help seemingly without a need to breathe. Ssokha’s stomach rumbled and vibrated with pleasure he felt, and Trinity felt the thrumming through the air, playing across her scales, and moaned. Her next kiss was more insistent, filled with the urge to coil her body around his and push him deep into water where those reverberations would carry into the deepest parts of her. It was difficult to resist the call from mythic side of herself and she was only saved by Ssokha’s hips jerking forward as he came.<br />
<br />
Michelle let loose a bird-like shriek, body and feathers shivering and twitching as she pulled away with a noisy slurp. And Trinity reached around with her neck, letting her flicking tongue capture the still pulsing cum beads from his erect cock. Then she searched out the harpy’s mouth, holding each other tightly while they explored Ssokha’s taste combined with their saliva.<br />
<br />
Trinity wanted to settle down against them both, but she had a sister to tend to.</p>
