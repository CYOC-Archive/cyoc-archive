<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rebecca took a breath and took Astaroth’s hand and took her last human step on Earth and passed through the flaming portal to into Hell.<br />
<br />
“See you Charon and Remeila.” Said Maisy as she and Rachel stepped through the portal. Charon nodded his head as Remeila opened a portal for themselves, this one was a greenish color and showed beyond it a very scenic view of rolling hills and row after rows of trees. <br />
Rebecca was nearly blinded as she stepped into darkness, all around her was a massive building with black marble stone walls with what appeared to be red lines of glowing lava in it. As her eyes adjusted she began to see reddish light coming in from multiple stain glass windows showing scenes of battle and sexual acts. Her years as the wife of a rather prudish Rev caused her face to blush just looking at the imagery on the wall. <br />
<br />
For Rachel it was strange being back in almost the same spot where she had been less then a day ago. The darkness was nothing for her new eyes and she saw the horrifying beauty in this room. <br />
<br />
“Shall we show your mother our true forms?” inquired Astaroth as Rebecca turned to look at her daughter who smiled before her body began to shift. Her skin turned an impossible white which stood out against the black all around. Her T-shirt changed back into the dress she had been wearing the night before as scales grew around her shoulder and down to her now larger breasts. Scales ran down her spin as her wings grew out as well as her tail. In the darkness of the chamber her scales at once began to give off a slight blue glow which would have been just perfect in a horror movie. <br />
<br />
“Wow…Rachel, you look so beautiful.” Said her mother “Will I look like her?”<br />
<br />
“Possible, but not 100%, the pool transforms every human differently but either way you will be the most beautiful demon in hell in my view.” Stated Astaroth “Are you ready to see me?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, I want to see the real you.” Confirmed Rebecca<br />
<br />
“Alright.” Said Astaroth as she began to grow in height as well, her fire red hair became a pure silver color as the red left her hair and journey instead to her eyes, horn buds above her eyebrows, her now fuller lips and a flaming crown above her head. Her face became far more elegant and more beautiful and fuller of lust as well. Her body also screamed sex which was appropriate for the Lady of Sloth and Vanity. Her marble white skin was countered by her black raven like wings. A snake, which had been just a tattoo on her human form came alive and headed down her now longer arm. Her clothes, which had been a black leather mini skirt and a very tight blouse changed to a very thin red thong with nipple coverings and more golden bands, necklaces, amulets, earrings and so on. <br />
<br />
“Wow…” said Rebecca she wasn’t so sure about the lack of clothing but that was something she assumed she would get used to in time. The important thing was the women in the clothing, or the lack of clothing that was and she was drop dead hot and turned her on more then any time her husband had ever had. “You look amazing?”<br />
<br />
“Thanks.” Said Astaroth, giving off a slight blush.<br />
<br />
“So how does this work?” inquired Rebecca <br />
<br />
“Follow me.” Said a new voice as a priest probably the same priest which had transformed Rachel appeared out of seemly nowhere. “Lord Lucifer warned us of your possible arrival, so we are prepared.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you.” said Astaroth as the priest led the four of them down the same staircase, down to the same dark chamber. The same statues stood awaiting Rebecca the same way they had been awaiting her daughter just the other day. The black pool of water was still there along with the multiple statues that had the same liquid dripping down into it.<br />
<br />
“So I stand here and walk under the water to the priest?” inquired Rebecca<br />
<br />
“And us, we will be waiting there for you.” Reassured Astaroth <br />
<br />
“They will set the pool on fire but the flames will not harm you, your cloths yes.” Added Rachel “As for breathing, it is kind of strange I didn’t even think about it.”<br />
<br />
“Alright.” Said Rebecca as she pulled out her wallet and took out some of the photos of her children she kept in it, making sure to leave the photos of her husband in there. She wanted those to burn but not the photos of her kids. “Can you keep these safe?”<br />
<br />
“Of course.” Said Rachel with a smile. “Don’t worry, mom I will see you on the other side.”<br />
<br />
Rachel and Maisy walked away heading down one of the sides of the pool.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, you will be fine and no matter what you will be the most beautiful demon in all the circles of hell.” Stated Astaroth “You have been through so much; this will be nothing for you.”<br />
<br />
“To correct the mistake, I made all those years ago to not go with you, walking across a pool would be ease.” Stated Rebecca as the two of them shared a tender kiss before Astaroth walked away.<br />
<br />
“Come to me human, leave your humanity behind and enter the waters, shed your human flesh and become a demon, come into darkness.” Called out the Priest as he extended his hand on the other side of the pool, as he did other priests began to chant while still others lit the pool causing the surface to catch fire at once.<br />
<br />
Summon up all her coward Rebecca took her first step into the pool. To her amazement the water was warm and welcoming as she took another step. As she did the fire rushed over her burning away her cloths. The last thing her human eyes saw a wall of flame and somehow through all the twisting flames, she saw Astaroth standing on the other side waiting for her along with her daughter and daughter-in-law.<br />
<br />
The water was pitch black and for a moment she felt fear but she kept moving, moving past the statues which populated the water marking the path she had to follow. With each step, her fear melted away as her body began to change as her human soul was transformed.<br />
<br />
Astaroth had never been so worried in her long life, not even during the battles against heaven during the rebellion or when she first told Rebecca about her demon hood. That made no sense to her, but her concern for Rebecca’s safety and happiness was almost overwhelming. She calmed down a little when Maisy and Rachel placed a hand on each of her shoulders.<br />
<br />
“It will be ok, Aunt Astaroth.” Reassured Maisy as the pool began to ripple as something began to come out of the water. <br />
<br />
As Rebecca’s head came out of the water, it was drastically changed, the years had melted away, she did look older than her daughter but not by much. To the point most would have considered them sisters not mother and daughter. Her face had become far more elegant and noble looking. Her brown hair remained but now seamed fuller, however her head was dominated by not one set of horns or even two but three sets with one additional horn. Two grew straight out from the side of her head and moved upwards, like of like bull horns but thicker, a set of three grew in almost a crown shape at her hair live above her nose/eyes. They grew up and back in an elegant nature, with the center one being slightly shorter than the two outer ones. The last pair of horns grew out from the sides of her head before wrapping around the larger outer two to face forward. The horns were a bright neon green just like her new eyes and lips. Her skin was the same pure white as her daughter’s.<br />
<br />
Her body had grown in size and in beauty to the point that a supermodel would have looked like a deformed monster. Her breasts are noticeably larger and fuller, perkier as well with a line of green scales running across her shoulders before going to a v shape. That was something her daughter had but in neon blue instead of neon green. The stretch marks that came from giving birth had disappeared as well as all the scars from her years of abuse at the hands of her husband. <br />
<br />
Her hands which were now longer lacked any claws which most demons had, however a large bump could be seen above the wrists and as she walked out of the water a long natural bone blade was retracting back into both of her wrists. The bone blade was the same green as her horns and where sharper than any blade made by man. Scales covered her elbows as well, another trait she shared with her daughter.<br />
She lacked any tail and her feet where mostly human aside from green scales around her knees, a trait she shared with her daughter. As she came out of the water a pair of pterodactyl like wings spread out from her shoulder blades, however while her daughter only had one, she had two. A second smaller set had grown as well, the flesh on the wings were the same green as her scales. It was clear to anyone looking around that Rebecca and Rachel were closely related and in hell that likely meant mother and child.<br />
<br />
“So how do I look?” inquired Rebecca, her teeth were now fangs.<br />
<br />
“Amazing, simply amazing.” Said Astaroth as she stepped forward and kissed Rebecca’s new lips, her raven like wings wrapping around her the best she could as Rebecca’s own wings did the same, the combination allowed both of them to make their own private bubble out of view of almost everyone. “Welcome to your new life, my love.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks for waiting for me.” Said Rebecca</p>
