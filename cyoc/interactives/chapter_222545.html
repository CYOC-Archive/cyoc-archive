<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Antonio had returned to camp, his maw soaked in blood, dragging the carcass of a large buck deer, it&#39;s neck broken and smoldering, the air filled with a sent of cooking meat, as he dropped the beast when entering camp he couldn&#39;t help but chuckle at the sight before him.<br />
Lilith with the snake demons assistance was desperately trying to pull her outfit over her new form, her loincloth laying snapped around her ankles and her face a deep purple in effort as she tried pulling the bindings of her breast covering closed, before gasping for air and letting her large mammaries bursts free, groaning and holding her enormous pregnancy as her brood began to stir due to their mother&#39;s efforts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Having some wardrobe problems by chance?&quot; Antonio said, sarcasm dripping from his voice as he chuckled &quot;not that I see this being a problem any time soon&quot; grinning as he began using his claws to skin the deer, the heat from his blade like claws cauterizing the incisions as he glided through the creatures flesh, resulting in no blood being spilled.<br />
Lilith glared at the big cat, putting her hands on her hips with a huff &quot;don&#39;t fuck with me right now kitty, if your species didn&#39;t make their young so big I wouldn&#39;t have this problem right now&quot; she said, slapping a hand onto the side of her girth. Antonio simply chuckled as he turned to look at her &quot;and who was the one who stole my load from a certain succubus?&quot; Raising an eyebrow before resuming his work when she couldn&#39;t give an answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ll be able to fit into this again Lilith, but maybe I can extend them for you&quot; said the snake as she bundled up the broken fabrics, Lilith sighed and braced her hands against her back &quot;ok Sarah, do what you have to do&quot; Sara nodded and slithered back into her tent, as it turned out Sarah was Lilith personal attendant, being a creature of lower power compared demon hunter it was only natural to them, but now thanks to the collar around Lilith&#39;s neck she now served Antonio.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your not the only one having problems covering this boulder&quot; came a tiny voice, both Antonio and Lilith turning to see Heleli floating out of her tent, a strained look on her face as her large overfilled womb seemed to weigh her down before sitting down on the edge of the campfire, spreading her legs wide to make room for her mammoth womb, letting out a sigh of relief as she rubbed over it&#39;s drum tight surface<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not even at your point yet Lilith, how the hell am I gonna cope when these little kittens start to grow, right now their just tadpoles sloshing around in there&quot; she said with a nervous chuckle, Lilith then leaned down, spreading her legs to do so, her ass and moist lips in perfect view for Antonio, as she ran her fingers through the sucubi&#39;s hair to sooth her<br />
&quot;Have no fear my tiny friend, I&#39;m sure the sire of these cubs will ease your burden as he has done for mine, when the time is right&quot; she said, looking over at Antonio as he drank in her naked beauty, she then began shaking her ass at him and gave him a wink.<br />
<br />
Just then a sound erupted from the Forrest, the sound of a low rumbling horn, it&#39;s haunting call echoing amongst the trees, vibrating the nearby river, Antonio leapt into action disappearing into a streak of flames before re appearing on the road next to camp, his form scorching the ground black, his smoldering patches of fur bursting into roaring flames, engulfing his paws and above his head in a thick smoke glaring with fury at what matched down the road.<br />
<br />
Marching in a perfect row were four individuals, all dressed in black cloaks and hoods, and lumbering behind them was the grotesque sight of a truck sized bear, it&#39;s flesh and fur seeming to be rotting away leaving only it&#39;s skeleton and organs underneath it&#39;s vile tissue, it&#39;s lower jaw unhinged, dragging along the ground as it trudged along the path, it&#39;s body was covered in chains, sinking into it&#39;s putrid flesh leaving blood soaked patches in its fur, all connected to the largest cloaked figure, clearly standing nine foot tall, his frame bulky and intimidating, then Antonio noticed the figure next to him, his eyes glowing a burning yellow, illuminating through the shadows of his hood, both hands were visible from beneath the robes, his palms open and tipped with claws, the skin coated in a fur coat as black as night, a black mist with an ominous purple haze to it was leaking from his palms, however there was something eerily familiar about those smoky fumes, the other two looked to be regular human sized, both wielding an axe in opposite hands, both walking in perfect sync of eachother, but the main feature of all four was the glowing red crests on the hoods of all four individuals, the symbol of a twisted crown with horns.<br />
<br />
Antonio&#39;s fur stood on end, his maw in a snarl, fangs exposed, his eyes and body consumed in flame, his mind raced with the memory of his burning den, the loss of his pack, his cubs, and that cursed symbol claiming responsibility, painted in his packs blood, and now here stood four cloaked figures wearing the same symbol, Antonio glanced back to see Lilith, Helen and Heleli, each weilding various weapons, Lilith held her green flamed swords, her stance heavy with her current condition, the same for Heleli, floating with a double ended spear, their blades hooked in opposite directions, and Helen, holding a mace in one hand and a Cresent moon shield in the other.<br />
<br />
Antonios attention turned back to the threat however as they came to a stop in perfect sync<br />
&quot;Strange, the master sent you ahead of us&quot; the large one spoke, his voice a booming rumble, low and gruff, folding his arms over his chest, yanking the bears chain as he did so, causing the foul beast to stagger forward, a blank look in its milky eyes.<br />
&quot;He&#39;s not&quot; &quot;one of usssss&quot; the two on the opposite side spoke, finishing each others words<br />
&quot;He is no cat I recognise, so primitive, it&#39;s vile to even look at&quot; the fourth one spoke, a low growl along with a plume of black vapor escaping his shadowed face before he reached into his cloak and revealed a one handed hammer, it&#39;s cube ends stained with blood and dirt<br />
&quot;Let me correct this mistake, this one should never have survived&quot; he hissed, looking up to the large one, who simply gave a nod before yanking the bears chain once more and began to walk along the side of the road, Antonio snarled and swiped at the giant figure, only to have his paw swatted away like a fly, the giant man chuckled, but continued walking, the other two in tow as they continued walking, but the third remained where he stood, glaring at Antonio with a familiar hunger.<br />
<br />
&quot;A disgrace such as you will surely have useless and weak skills, but I will harvest them from your mutated corpse none the less&quot; he growled before reaching out and grasped his cloak and ripped it from his body.<br />
Antonio was stunned by what he saw, the man wasn&#39;t a man at all, it looked just like him!, Except he possessed a much more human form, walking on two legs, his feet still paws and tipped with claws, his tail dragged along the floor behind him, a loincloth made of chainmail and various animal hides around his waist, his form was ripped with muscle, the gaps between each bulging muscle ripped open revealing the red tissue underneath, his forearms were covered in a cloth binding, and then there was his face, his head remained completely feline, his pupils a knife like slit, the whites bloodshot if his eyes were drenched in blood, he exposed his fangs at Antonio and began to circle him, Antonio did the same.<br />
<br />
This was unlike any encounter he had experienced before, this was the first time Antonio had seen anything resembling his own kind, and now he would have to fight for not only his life, but also for the lives of everyone in the camp, for his cubs<br />
&quot;When I&#39;m done with you, il make sure to wipe your putrid bloodline from the face of this realm, as I did before&quot; the cat grinned, before reaching down and showed off a long black wolf tail and a fox tail, Antonio froze on the spot, this creature, he was the one responsible for his cubs death<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right you mutant son of a bitch, I ripped those females if yours apart limb by limb, oh how i remember the delicious sound of their screams&quot; he snarled, Antonio felt something snap inside him, his fire was hot before, but now, it was an inferno, like an explosion that had been held at bay but now it was free, he roared, sending a collom of white hot fire from his maw, striking the cat directly in the face, the creature roared in pain, desperately clawing and batting it&#39;s face to put the flames out before letting loose a wild scream and charged Antonio, his hammer swinging wild as he ran in his direction.<br />
<br />
Their battle shook the earth, trees collapsing, the ground cracking, land masses rising into hills and collapsing into Pitts, it was as if gods were at war with eachother, there were floods, fires, storms, both cars had taken a beating yet luckily Antonio&#39;s efforts had directed the fighting away from the camp, his left eye was crushed, his vision one sided, his back leg broken in several places, maybe a few ribs too, yet he smiled evilly hen he saw the state of his opponent.<br />
The humanoid cat was burned and broken, his fur and flesh scorched and sliced, claw marks raked across his entire body, his hammer lay shattered to one side, broken on the iron skin of Antonios Solar cloak skill, the metal still glowing red from the heat, the creature had lost an arm and both his eyes, seeming to use the black smog to sense Antonio as it coated the wreckage of their battleground<br />
&quot;Die die die die!&quot; It manically roared, lunging at Antonio with fangs and claws extended, catching his shoulder with its fang as Antonio leaped from the strike, spinning in the air and digging his claws down the human felines back as it raced past him before slamming head first into a tree with a sickening crunch, turning around Antonio looked on in disgust as the cats bottom jaw was missing, gushing blood as it&#39;s severed jaw lay at its feet, blood gurgling in it&#39;s throat the cat dropped to its knees and began blindly crawling to escape.<br />
<br />
Antonio stalked him as the cat gurgled, his cries for mercy choked on its own blood<br />
&quot;You called me inferior, weak, mutant, a failure, you took everything from me and now&quot; he smeared before sinking his fangs into the cats spine, yanking his jaws skyward as the collom of bone was ripped free in a shower of crimson red &quot;now I will take everything from you&quot; he said darkly before taking a chunk from the beasts flesh.<br />
WARNING: EVOLUTION FROM: Hellfire cat TO: Hellfire beast-man IMMINENT.<br />
EVOLVING SKILLS:<br />
&quot;I will grow, I will build, and I will make an empire to slay all who threaten me and my family&quot; he said before setting fire to the symbol of the twisted crown that glowed on the cats bindings.</p>
