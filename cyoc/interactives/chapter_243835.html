<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The were-bear Rachel took a moment to revel in the power surging through his new form. He swiped his massive paw at the shower curtain, sending it flying across the bathroom with ease. He felt his new muscles flex and stretch, enjoying the sensation of his enhanced strength. He playfully smacked his tail against the wall, feeling the power behind the swing and the thump it made against the tiles. Rachel&#39;s mind raced with the possibilities of what he could do with his new body. <br />
<br />
The hunger grew stronger, and Rachel&#39;s nose twitched as he caught a tantalizing scent. His heightened olfactory senses picked up something delicious wafting through the house. It was a smell he recognized—his favorite takeout, sizzling with spices and grilled meats. He salivated at the thought of devouring it. Rachel had always loved food, but as a were-bear, the craving was insatiable. He lumbered out of the bathroom, his new form feeling surprisingly natural.<br />
<br />
SUMMARY^1: Rachel, now a were-bear, began to embrace her newfound strength and senses. Despite feeling confused, she enjoyed the power her transformed body provided. Hearing a noise outside the bathroom, Rachel&#39;s curiosity grew. The intense hunger that accompanied her transformation led her to sniff out the scent of her favorite takeout, which she found incredibly appealing. She left the bathroom, her bear form moving surprisingly naturally. <br />
<br />
He moved with a grace he didn&#39;t know he possessed, his powerful legs carrying his massive frame through the hallway with ease. The floorboards didn&#39;t even creak under his weight. Rachel felt a thrill of excitement and power. He couldn&#39;t resist testing out his new body further. With a roar of delight, he swiped his paw at a vase on the coffee table, sending it crashing to the ground. Shattering ceramic was music to his new, more primal ears. <br />
<br />
His stomach rumbled again, the smell of food growing stronger. He followed the scent to the kitchen and found a half-eaten burger on the counter. With one swipe of his monstrous paw, he sent the plate flying into the wall, leaving a gaping hole in the drywall. Rachel&#39;s jaws unhinged, and he took a bite of the burger, savoring the taste. It was delicious, but something was off. It wasn&#39;t enough. He craved something more... substantial. <br />
<br />
The were-bear Rachel went to the fridge and pawed through the contents. Nothing seemed to satisfy the hunger that gnawed at him. He threw the fridge door open with a roar, the items inside flying out and smashing onto the floor. He sniffed the air, trying to find something that would appease his newfound appetite. And then he smelled it—fresh meat. The scent was irresistible. <br />
<br />
With a bound, Rachel leaped frogged over the kitchen island, knocking over a chair in the process, and dashed to the freezer. He ripped it open and found a pack of steaks buried under the frost. Using his sharp claws, he shredded the plastic packaging and took out a steak. He took a bite, the cold meat sending a jolt through his teeth. It was delicious, but it was too frozen. Rachel didn&#39;t care. He devoured the steak, feeling the cold melt away in his mouth, the blood thumping in his veins with each chew. <br />
<br />
Curiosity overcame Rachel as he realized he hadn&#39;t fully explored his new body. He looked down at his paws and flexed them, watching as his claws retracted and extended with a satisfying click. He tried to write his name on the floor with his claw, but his coordination was still off. It was like writing with a crayon for the first time. He chuckled, the sound coming out as a low, guttural growl. Rachel&#39;s sense of humor remained intact, even if his handwriting was now illegible. <br />
<br />
On a whim, Rachel decided to see if he could still use the TV remote. He picked it up with his paw, feeling the plastic device between his thick digits. With surprising dexterity, he managed to press the power button. The TV flickered to life, and Rachel leaned in, his eyes adjusting to the bright screen. He flipped through the channels, watching in amazement as humans went about their lives. It was strange to see the world from this new perspective—both terrifying and fascinating. <br />
<br />
Rachel&#39;s curiosity grew stronger, and he began to explore his new physical capabilities. He tried to stand on his hind legs, wobbling at first before finding balance. He took a step forward, and then another, feeling his heavy paws thud against the floor. The were-bear grinned to himself, feeling like a toddler taking its first steps. He stumbled into the living room, knocking over a lamp and sending it crashing to the floor. Rachel chuckled at the mess, his deep voice resonating through the house. <br />
<br />
The ache in his cock grew more intense as he thought about the girls he had seen earlier in the night—how they had looked at him with desire in their eyes. Now, Rachel felt that desire himself. The bear inside him wanted to claim a mate, to feel the warmth of another body against his fur. His thoughts turned to Mei, his missing friend. He hoped she was okay, but also wondered if she was going through the same transformation. <br />
<br />
As he pondered these new feelings, Rachel heard a knock at the front door. His ears perked up, the sound echoing through his head with a clarity he&#39;d never experienced. His heart raced, the beast within him eager to protect his territory. He padded over to the door, his heavy steps muffled by the plush carpet. Rachel felt excitement—what would he find on the other side? Another were-bear? Or perhaps a human, oblivious to the creature they were about to face? <br />
<br />
He peeked through the peephole and saw a group of college students, likely looking for a party. Rachel&#39;s cock twitched, the ache growing more insistent. He hadn&#39;t felt this way since... well, ever. The desire to claim a mate, to feel the heat of another body against his fur, was overwhelming. The bear within him roared to life, demanding release. Rachel&#39;s mind swirled with confusion—he was Rachel, a girl, but now he felt like... like a boy? No, not just a boy. A bear. A creature of power and lust. <br />
<br />
He swung the door open, revealing his massive, fur-covered frame to the stunned party goers. They stared at him, their eyes wide with shock. &quot;Whoa, dude, that&#39;s a sick costume!&quot; one of them exclaimed. Rachel bared his teeth in a smile that was more snarl than greeting. &quot;You like it?&quot; he rumbled, his voice deeper and more animalistic than he ever remembered it being. The girls giggled, their eyes flicking down to his crotch. They had no idea what was happening, but they found it incredibly... hot. <br />
<br />
The were-bear Rachel stepped aside, allowing the group to enter. His cock throbbed again, demanding attention. He watched the sway of their hips as they walked past him, his instincts telling him to grab one, to claim her as his own. But Rachel&#39;s human mind rebelled. He had to keep his secret. He couldn&#39;t just jump on them, no matter how much he wanted to. The group spread out into the house, laughter and chatter filling the air. Rachel retreated to the shadows, his heightened hearing picking up every word, every footstep. <br />
<br />
He watched one girl separate from the group, heading for the kitchen. Rachel followed, his heart pounding in his chest. She was petite, with short, curly hair and a figure that would fit perfectly against his new, powerful body. He approached her from behind, his claws retracting slightly as he reached out to touch her. She gasped when she felt the fur brushing against her, turning around to face him.<br />
<br />
Her eyes widened when she saw Rachel&#39;s new form, but instead of fear, Rachel saw something else. Desire. She leaned in closer, her hand reaching out to stroke his fur. &quot;What are you?&quot; she whispered, her voice filled with awe and lust. Rachel leaned down, his muzzle brushing against her neck, inhaling her sweet scent. He growled softly, his cock growing harder at her touch. <br />
<br />
With surprising gentleness, Rachel picked her up, cradling her in his massive arms. She squealed in delight as he carried her into the living room, laying her on the couch. Rachel watched her, his eyes glowing with hunger—both for food and something more primal. She looked up at him, her pupils dilating, and Rachel knew she wanted it. The were-bear didn&#39;t waste a second. He leaned in, his tongue tracing a wet line along her neck before he kissed her. <br />
<br />
The girl moaned, her hands sliding along Rachel&#39;s muscular chest, feeling the fur under her fingertips. Rachel&#39;s cock throbbed, demanding release. He tore off her skirt with one swift movement, revealing her lacy underwear. The scent of her arousal was intoxicating, and Rachel could barely control himself. He stepped back for a moment, admiring the beauty laid before him. Then, with a growl, he ripped off her panties, tossing them aside like a piece of tissue paper. <br />
<br />
The girl looked up at Rachel with a mix of fear and excitement in her eyes. Rachel knew she had to be careful; he didn&#39;t want to hurt her. He leaned down and nuzzled her neck, his cock now aching for use. He could feel his body changing again, his bear instincts taking over. He was going to claim this girl as his own.<br />
<br />
With surprising grace, Rachel climbed onto the kitchen island, the plates and pans clattering around him as he stood tall, his cock standing proud and ready. The college student looked up at him with a mix of terror and fascination, her eyes locked on the massive member that swung before her. Rachel&#39;s mind swirled with lust and the primal need to mate. He knew he had to have her. <br />
<br />
He plunged his cock into her. She let out a moan as he filled her, the feeling of his furry body against hers sending waves of pleasure through her body. Rachel felt his muscles contract as he began to thrust, his cock hitting all the right spots. The college student wrapped her legs around his waist, her nails digging into his back as she urged him deeper. Rachel had never felt so alive, so powerful. The bear within him was in control, claiming her as his mate. <br />
<br />
The room was filled with the sound of flesh slapping against fur and the grunts of Rachel&#39;s animalistic lust. Rachel watched her face contort in pleasure, her eyes rolling back in her head as he brought her closer to climax. He felt his orgasm building, his cock pulsing with every thrust. Rachel knew he couldn&#39;t hold back much longer. <br />
<br />
With a final, powerful thrust, Rachel came, filling her with his seed. The sensation was overwhelming, and Rachel felt the girl change. Her body began to bulge and shift, her transformation starting as Rachel&#39;s climax subsided. Rachel watched in amazement as her body grew, her features becoming more masculine, her eyes turning a deep, golden brown. Her fur was a different color from his, but Rachel could sense the connection, the bond that was forming between them. However, that bond would seem like a brotherly one.<br />
<br />
To Rachel&#39;s shock, the college student began thrusting her hips. With each thrust her clit grew and changed. Rachel watched as her new body began to adapt to the new cock inside him. His body grew more masculine, his hips broadened, and his muscles grew. Rachel felt the bear inside him shift in surprise, but the hunger didn&#39;t subside. Rachel&#39;s cock remained hard, begging for more. <br />
<br />
The girl moaned Rachel&#39;s name, her voice now deep and gruff. Rachel realized with a start that she had become a he. Rachel pulled out and watched as the new man sat up, his cock still rock hard. Rachel licked his lips, tasting the musky scent of the transformation. He was no longer the girl he once was. &quot;Rachel? What is this?&quot; the guy asked, looking at his blond paws. Rachel&#39;s mind raced as he tried to explain, his voice now a low growl. &quot;I don&#39;t know, but it feels... right.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But we thought it was a costume,&quot; he poked his balls before hoping for the island. He immediately fell from two feet to four. &quot;This is no costume,&quot; he grinned as he sniffed food from the kitchen. Rachel watched the new were-bear with a mix of confusion and arousal. He had never felt this way before, but it was undeniable—he was Rachel&#39;s brother now. Rachel&#39;s mind was racing with questions and newfound desires. He had to know more about what had happened to them. For now, though... <br />
<br />
The two made their way into the living room, Rachel&#39;s new brother sniffing the air. &quot;There are two more,&quot; Rachel whispered, his newfound heightened senses picking up on the presence of their roommates. &quot;We need to find them.&quot; Rachel&#39;s stomach growled, the hunger for more than just food driving him forward. The thought of having more mates was too tempting to resist. <br />
<br />
&quot;First, tell me your name, brother, mine is now... Jake&#39;s voice was still deep and gruff, but there was a tenderness in his tone that hadn&#39;t been there before. Rachel nodded, his mind still reeling from the transformation. &quot;Okay, Jake,&quot; Rachel said, testing the name on his new tongue. It felt right. Rachel, &quot;My name is Riven.&quot; The two stared at each other for a moment, their new forms still unfamiliar, but the bond between them was unmistakable. <br />
<br />
SUMMARY^1: Rachel and the transformed college student, now named Jake, discussed their new reality and the bond they shared as were-bears. Rachel&#39;s stomach growled with a hunger beyond food, hinting at a desire for more mates. Rachel introduced himself as Riven, accepting his new identity, and the two agreed to search for their roommates together. <br />
<br />
Riven and Jake decided to split up to find the rest of their friends. Jake took the upstairs, while Riven went down to the basement. Rachel&#39;s bear-like nose twitched as he caught the scent of fear and excitement. It led him to the room where the other college students were hiding, whispering about the &quot;monsters&quot; upstairs. Rachel felt a pang of guilt—they were the monsters they feared. <br />
<br />
As he approached the room, Rachel heard a boy speaking loudly, trying to reassure the others. &quot;It&#39;s just a costume, guys! It&#39;s so realistic, though—I bet Rachel spent a fortune on it!&quot; Rachel&#39;s heart sank a bit at the mention of his old name, but he knew he had to keep his true identity hidden. He had to find Mei. <br />
<br />
Riven&#39;s large, fur-covered form crept closer, his paws making barely a whisper on the hardwood floor. His massive frame could have easily crushed the furniture and the humans cowering behind it, but Riven was in control—for now. His eyes narrowed as he focused on the scent of his roommate. There she was, hiding behind the couch, her heart racing like a rabbit&#39;s. Riven could feel the bear within him wanting to pounce, but he held back, his humanity still fighting for dominance. <br />
<br />
&quot;Guys, guys, it&#39;s okay. Rachel&#39;s always had a wild imagination,&quot; the boy was envious of how realistic his friends &#39; outfits were. &quot;I mean, come on, it&#39;s gotta be some kind of Hollywood-level costume!&quot; He said, thinking he was alone. He mentioned how good it looked between the legs. &quot;I mean, how can that look so real?&quot; he whispered to himself. <br />
<br />
With a powerful leap, Rachel, now known as Riven, landed in the room, his paws slamming into the floorboards. The college students screamed and scrambled to get away, but Riven had locked onto his prey—the loud-mouthed boy who had been talking about his costume. The were-bear&#39;s eyes gleamed with a mix of anger and desire. <br />
<br />
&#39;If he likes my costume, he should get one for his own,&#39; he thought. However, the moment was cut short when Riven&#39;s massive form lunged at him. The boy&#39;s eyes widened with terror as Riven&#39;s fur-covered paws pushed him onto the floor. Riven&#39;s powerful claws ripped through the fabric of his pants, exposing the boy&#39;s trembling ass to the cold air. Riven&#39;s cock, still rock hard, throbbed with need as he stared at the boy&#39;s exposed flesh. <br />
<br />
The boy&#39;s scream was muffled by Riven&#39;s paw as Rachel&#39;s human mind struggled to regain control. But the bear was too strong, too hungry. With a fierce growl, Riven plunged his cock into the boy, the sound of tearing cloth echoing through the room. The boy&#39;s eyes watered with pain, his body involuntarily tensing around Riven&#39;s thick shaft. Rachel&#39;s mind was in a frenzy, torn between the horror of what he was doing and the primal satisfaction it brought him.<br />
<br />
Jake heard the commotion and rushed downstairs, his cock swollen with excitement. He wasn&#39;t alone as a third male were-bear was right beside him. &quot;Riven, this is our new brother Sam,&quot; he said, his fur standing on end with excitement. Riven, lost in his lust, didn&#39;t even notice. His powerful hips bucked, driving his cock deeper into the boy&#39;s tight, unprepared hole. The boy&#39;s cries grew muffled as Jake approached, his new brother&#39;s paws tight around the human&#39;s waist. <br />
<br />
The boy, realizing his fate was to become like Rachel, felt his body change. His cock shrunk and retreated, replaced by a wet, pulsing pussy. His chest expanded, tearing his shirt to shreds as his breasts grew, large and full. Rachel watched in amazement, his thrusts growing more erratic as the boy&#39;s transformation began. The boy&#39;s features softened, his skin becoming furry and his eyes taking on a golden glow. Rachel&#39;s mind reeled—this was his doing, his seed that had brought about this change.  <br />
<br />
The new female were-bear let out a guttural moan, her body spasming as the last of the transformation took hold. Rachel&#39;s cock slipped out of her wetness, leaving her panting and trembling on the floor. Rachel stepped back, watching as she grew before his eyes, her body shifting into that of a powerful, curvaceous she-bear. She looked up at him, her eyes filled with a mix of anger, confusion, and undeniable arousal. Rachel felt a twinge of guilt—he hadn&#39;t meant to do this, but he couldn&#39;t deny the excitement that surged through him at the sight of his new sibling. <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome, mate, you are the first female were-bear in our pack, you will be cherished,&quot; Jake said, his voice gruff with lust as Rachel&#39;s humanity washed away and Riven fully embraced his new identity as the pack&#39;s alpha. Rachel watched in amazement as the boy&#39;s body grew more voluptuous, his chest bursting from the fabric of his shirt. Several large, round breasts emerged one pair after the other, the nipples already erect and sensitive. Rachel could see the new she-bear&#39;s confusion as her hands reached to feel her new form. <br />
<br />
&quot;Then call me Bea,&quot; Bea stated. Her voice was like a mix of Rachael and a bear&#39;s growl, but somehow it was still feminine. Rachel felt his ears twitch at the sound of her new name, his human mind struggling to reconcile with his animal instincts. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bea, huh?&quot; Jake said with a grin, his fur ruffling with excitement. &quot;It suits you. You look like a fierce warrior.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bea looked down at her new body, taking in the sight of her new fur and breasts. &quot;I... I don&#39;t know what to say,&quot; she murmured, her voice a mix of fear and fascination. Riven watched her, his heart pounding in his new, powerful chest. <br />
<br />
Jake stepped closer to Bea, placing a furry hand on her shoulder. &quot;You&#39;re part of the pack now, sis. We&#39;re here for you.&quot; His voice was soothing, yet the hunger in his eyes was unmistakable. Sam, the third member of their newfound family, shifted nervously, his smaller frame looking even more so next to the towering were-bears. <br />
<br />
Riven coughed before speaking, &quot;It seems in order to get a female werebear we need male humans and vice versa, however, I didn&#39;t like how tonight went down, it wasn&#39;t consensual.&quot; Rachel&#39;s mind was still there, trying to make sense of everything. &quot;But it&#39;s what we do,&quot; Sam spoke up, his voice still deep but with a hint of uncertainty. &quot;It&#39;s our nature.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but we forced it. Even though it will be difficult, new members should be volunteers. We can&#39;t just change people&#39;s lives without their consent,&quot; Riven said firmly, his human morals still strong despite his animal instincts. Jake nodded, understanding the gravity of the situation. <br />
<br />
But their discussion was cut short by a loud knock at the door, followed by a powerful crash as it was broken down. The frame splintered, and a male were-bear, larger than Riven and Jake combined, stormed into the room. His fur was a deep, dark brown, almost black, and his eyes glowed with fiery rage. The college students screamed, hiding behind the furniture, and Bea took a protective stance beside Riven. <br />
<br />
The intruder bellowed, his deep voice resonating through the house. Riven recognized the challenge in his roar and knew that they had to assert their dominance. With a mighty leap, Riven rose onto his hind legs, towering over the new threat. His voice boomed through the room, of his human speech and the guttural growl of his bear form. &quot;We are not here to fight! We seek only to claim what is ours!&quot; <br />
<br />
The large male were-bear paused, his eyes narrowing as he took Riven&#39;s words. Rachael could feel the tension in the room, the air thick with the scent of fear and aggression. But Riven&#39;s words had an unexpected effect. The intruder&#39;s rage seemed to dissipate, his ears flicking back as he considered the situation. &quot;Your pack is new,&quot; he said, his voice a low rumble. &quot;You do not understand the ways of the moon.&quot; <br />
<br />
Riven nodded, his fur bristling slightly. &quot;We may be new, but we are not weak,&quot; he said firmly. &quot;We seek to live in harmony, not dominance.&quot; The dark-furred were-bear studied him, and Rachael felt a shiver of anticipation run through his new body. The creature was massive, easily twice the size of Rachael&#39;s transformed form, and his muscles rippled with power. Rachael knew that a fight would be disastrous, especially with so many humans present. <br />
<br />
&quot;To each pack his own, but I smell the intruder was here,&quot; the large werebear sniffed the air deeply. &quot;However, they are not here now.&quot; Confusion washed across Riven&#39;s pack. &quot;What do you mean?&quot; Bea asked, her new fur bristling with fear. <br />
<br />
The new alpha, Rachael, took a moment to recall the event. &quot;A month ago,&quot; Rachael began, his deep voice still holding a hint of Rachel&#39;s softness, &quot;a creature came to my land. She was holding a foul liquid and drinking it, stumbling as she did so. She was not like us. Her fur was patchy, and she smelled...different. I knew she was not of our kind, and she had no place here.&quot; Rachael&#39;s paw absently scratched his large, fur-covered testicles, the sensation both foreign and oddly comforting in his transformed state.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I would have let her pass had she not dishonored our fallen brethren. She smashed the elixir and pulled out a colored stick, the same color as her lips, then she defaced the tombstone of my beloved.&quot; <br />
<br />
The tall were-bear paused, his nostrils flaring as he sniffed the hand he had just used to scratch his balls. Rachael could smell the faint scent of the foul liquid on his fur. &quot;What did you do?&quot; Bea whispered, her curiosity piqued despite her fear. <br />
<br />
Riven looked at his pack mates, his eyes flashing with anger and sadness. &quot;The intruder had no respect for our kind,&quot; he said, his voice low and menacing. &quot;I taught her a lesson she would never forget.&quot; Rachael&#39;s hand balled into a fist, his claws extending slightly as he remembered the encounter. &quot;I slashed her up. It would&#39;ve been fatal had she not stumbled down the hill. I assumed she had passed, but her scent is too recent and...&quot; he sniffed riven. <br />
<br />
&quot;...you have been affected by her.&quot; Riven was confused as the tall werebear looked at a picture hanging on the wall. Rachael&#39;s eyes followed his gaze to a photograph of Mei, Rachael&#39;s missing friend. Rachael&#39;s heart raced as the realization hit him—Mei was the one they had encountered in the alley. <br />
<br />
The tall were-bear sniffed the air again, his nostrils flaring. &quot;I&#39;m sorry to say your friend is in a fate worse than death. Unlike you and I, he will have no control over his instincts. One day he will be killed, whether by one of us or the humans.&quot; Rachel felt a pang of sadness for Mei. Rachael had never wanted this for her, but she had brought this curse upon herself. Rachel&#39;s bear instincts roared within him, demanding that she find her and bring her to justice. Rachael knew that they had to act fast. <br />
<br />
&quot;i will take my leave&quot; the male werebear walked on two legs then turned to them. &quot;i will not go look for your friend but hope she does not return to my land&quot; he then raised his paw. to the four&#39;s amazement it was repaired in a green glow. &quot;i leave my scent upon you, you may find your way to the tomb of our ancestors if you wish to understand more&quot; with that he left, his fur brushing the door frame as he left. Rachel felt his bear instincts recede slightly, allowing his human mind to take back over. He looked at Bea and Jake with a mix of fear and determination. &quot;We need to find Mei before it&#39;s too late.&quot;</p>
