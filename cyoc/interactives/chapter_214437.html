<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;...horses.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The spell will turn you into horses. You see, this way you will be able to stay together, here in the farm...&quot;<br />
<br />
The boys looked at each other, and laughed. &quot;I must admit, I believed you for a second,&quot; said Kyle. &quot;Turn us into horses? you&#39;re amazing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan also laughed, but his sad look return quickly. &quot;Katie, if that&#39;s all you have... I really need to get going now-ahhhh!&quot; he shouted, as his hands... changed in front of his eyes. His fingers melted together, and a black mateer covered them. He watched in shock as his former hands rounded and shifted, turning itno horse&#39;s hooves.<br />
<br />
Dan let out another scream, and Kyle looked at him in terror, his jaw open wide. &quot;You were actually serious! What the fu-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhh!&quot; shouted Kyle as the same accured to him. His hands blackened and rounded, transforming into a pair of hooves.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was completely serious. You are going to turn into horses-my horses, and that way, we&#39;ll get to be together forever!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We had no idea you-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you both agreed to any sacrifice, not matter how bad it is. So you&#39;re giving up your humanity for friendship. And you get to help my family here-Kyle, you know how generous my parents have been with you. It&#39;s a great way to give it back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We had no idea this is what you meant! Please, stop it, please!&quot; screamed Dan as his arms started changing, covering in brown fur, cracking and shifting, and turning into front legs. Kyle screamed as a wave of pain crossed his feet, and he took off his shoes to see his legs and feet changing, turning into equine hind legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is no way back now. Just calm down, boys. I think you&#39;ll find the life of a horse really happy and calm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t wanna be a horse!&quot; cried Kyle. &quot;I wanna be human! With two legs, and a human mind!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, stop whining. You&#39;ve already gave your approval... and anyway, you guys ain&#39;t gonna lose your minds. Only your physical body change... maybe you&#39;ll have some horse instincts, but that&#39;s it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle sighed in relief, but than shouted again: &quot;And yet, I don&#39;t want to do this! Please! Katie, I&#39;m your friend! Why are you doing this to me?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan&#39;s hands and arms has completely changed by now, and his legs started changing as well. Katie looked at Kyle in the eyes, and Kyle looked back, looks away from his changing arms. &quot;Kyle, honey, be honest with me... who is more important for you, me or Dan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I, I-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t lie. It&#39;s Dan. I know it, I always knew it. And I really want the best for you guys... this is the only way you can stay together. Do you still want me to stop?&quot;<br />
<br />
The friends looked at each other, and figured they can&#39;t say no. Their friendship was stronger than just themselves... Dan thought how on how their parting will affect Kyle, and blushed in embaressment. Kyle needs him. And if it&#39;s the only way he could stay with him... he will do it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can see you&#39;re getting it. Life as horses isn&#39;t bad at all, I promise you! and I&#39;ll always be there to help you and guide you, take care of you and feed you, so you have nothing to be afraid about.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan sighed, and looked at Kyle back. &quot;Kyle? What are you saying?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As long as you want it... yes. I will do it... for our friendship.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For our friendship,&quot; responded Dan.<br />
<br />
Katie smiled. &quot;I knew-&quot;<br />
<br />
She was cut off by grunts from the boys, who&#39;s spines begun to lengthen and crack, forcing them both onto all their four new legs. She walked outside of the barn, saying: &quot;I&#39;ll meet ya after the changes are over, have fun!&quot; and giggling.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Dan and Kyle looked at each other from their akward, equine posture. &quot;Seems like we&#39;re staying together,&quot; said Kyle in a bad attempt to laugh. <br />
<br />
Dan looked at him in discomfort. &quot;Dude... my shirt is killing me. It&#39;s so itchy... can you help me remove it?&quot;<br />
<br />
It took a long time, but eventually they mamaged to pull off Dan&#39;s shirt. &quot;Now it&#39;s my turn,&quot; said Kyle, noticing the fur growing on Dan&#39;s body, and knwing what will he find under his shirt. As he expected, when they puleed it off, his back was completely covered in brown fur, though it was a much ligher brown than Dan&#39;s fur.<br />
<br />
Their spines continued to shfit and crack, and their bellys swelled as they gained muscle and mass. Their chests barreled, transforming their bodys into equine bellys. They hips cracked, making their movement much less flexible. They both let out grunts and shouts as their bodies continue to grow and swell, until they finally stopped. Kyle looked at Dan, and noticed he was a little taller than him-but they both were way taller than before. Kyle pointed it out, but the only answer he got from his friend was a grunt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dan? Are you okay there?&quot; he asked, trumbling on all fours, trying to get closer to him. Dan shouted in pain. &quot;I think I&#39;m getting my ta-aaail!&quot; he screamed as his new tail bursted from his pants, covering in black fur. Dan sighed in relief. &quot;Oh, thank god,&quot; he mumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;It isn&#39;t over yet,&quot; said Kyle, starting to feel the pressure in the back of his pants. Much like Dan&#39;s, his tail bursted out of his body, and he realised he can could control it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dan! Check it out!&quot; he said, swishing his tail back and forth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, that&#39;s actually looks cool,&quot; said Dan. He smirked, and got closer to Kyle, flicking his new tail on his friend&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ow!&quot; shouted Kyle, but laughed. Having a tail was sick!<br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle...&quot; said Dan, feeling the bulge in his pants. Kyle looked at him with the same face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you please...?&quot; he asked, embaressed. Kyle nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s alright, horses go around naked anyway,&quot; said Kyle, trying to calm his friend down as he bended on his new knees and used his mouth to remove Dan&#39;s pants. It was suprisingly easy; The pants almost fell down anyway. He took a long breath, and did the same to his underwear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Dan, blushing in embaressment. Of course, they&#39;ve seen each other before, but... not like this.<br />
<br />
Kyle was embaressed of his act, but he just couldn&#39;t move his eyes away as his friend&#39;s member started to change. Dan&#39;s balls grew bigger and covered in hairs, and his penis lenghened and swelled. &#39;It&#39;s so big!&#39; thought Kyle. Was he actually... aroused by that? He blushed and turned his face away, trying to cover his eraction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle...&quot; said Dan, trying to look between his legs. &quot;Please, tell me... what&#39;s going on over there?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle looked again, and saw Dan&#39;s member sliding into a sheath. &quot;I think you&#39;re done changing... there,&quot; he said. He could feel heat rising in his own privates, and knowing what&#39;s about to come, he asked Dan &quot;Can you remove my pants?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan blushed, but walked behind his friends, tugging down his clothes with his mouth.<br />
<br />
One minute later, the heat was over, and Kyle let ut a sigh of relief. &quot;Dude, is everything alright there?&quot; he asked, trying to look between his legs, and seeing nothing.<br />
<br />
Dan chuckled t himself. &quot;Oh, dude, you&#39;re not gonna like it...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; asked Kyle, corious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seems like the spell is turning you into a female horse... A mare, I think that&#39;s how they&#39;re called.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; shouted Kyle in disbelief, but he really haven&#39;t felt nothing between his legs. &quot;Why?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have no idea. We can ask Katie when she&#39;s back...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, we will,&quot; hissed Kyle.<br />
<br />
They let out another scream as their necks elongated and rounded. Their ears changed together, turning big and pointy. <br />
<br />
&quot;I thing that&#39;s the last part...&quot; said Kyle. &quot;I mean, our fa-eeeighces!&quot; he said, his voice turning into a suprised whinney as his face pushed forward, forming a snout. His ears grew bigger and turned black, and a mane sprouted on his neck and back, finishing his transformation. Dan&#39;s face followed quickly, transforming into horse&#39;s head. As his mane grew, Dan and Kyle looked at each other in amazment. In the place once stood two human friends, standed now-on all fours-a mighty stallion and a beautiful mare.<br />
<br />
The door slammed open, maing their ears twitch. &quot;Wow. You look gorgeus,&quot; said Katie. &quot;But who is who?&quot;<br />
<br />
Both the horses tried to respond, but only snorts and whinneys came out. &quot;Oh, yeah, I forgot,&quot; said Katie. She mumbled weird words, and a flash of purple light sparked from her hands. &quot;Now I can understand you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Katie, please, help us! It&#39;s me, Kyle, and I&#39;m a girl now, and I feel like I&#39;m falling over, and I&#39;m hungry, and-&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie laughed. &quot;Chill! Come, guys-I mean, guy,&quot; Kyle let out an angry neigh. &quot;Come with me, and I&#39;ll explain everything.&quot;</p>
