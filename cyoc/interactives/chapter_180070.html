<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate had a bit of a spring in his step as he disembarked the plane as it landed on Heiya Island, as it was an opportunity to spend time with Shuixing and that made it worth while. He&#39;d seen her for the Year of the Ox tournament, as they&#39;d both managed to arrange things so that they could be in it, and a part of Nate was still surprised he&#39;d won, but that had been limited and almost as soon as it was won, he and the others had to fly back to Wisconsin where his father had his farm to manage and Nate had college to finish. Now, though, he&#39;d have a full week off with limited class work and the free time to be with the female Water Buffalo Animalian that he loved dearly. After managing to get through all the testing that Heiya Island required for entry and doing his best to keep from laughing when the swab for the test tickled his nostrils.<br />
<br />
He eventually made his way out from the testing area at the airport and smiled underneath his mask at the sight waiting for him, Shuixing with her eyes seeming to glitter in the lights from the ceiling. Or maybe that was just how he saw it, either way, he was happy to see her and moved quickly to embrace her in a hug and nuzzle his muzzle to hers.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve missed you,&quot; Nate said softly as they nuzzled and then turned to head down to the baggage claim.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can feel that,&quot; Shuixing smiled beneath her own mask as she felt Nate&#39;s hand rest on her hip before pulling her toward him. It felt warm and gentle, &quot;and perhaps later we can engage in what you Americans always do on Spring Break...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we may have to wait until the summer to go swimming,&quot; Nate answered, &quot;the waters here are more temperate. Only the Animalians based off of animals that normally swim in waters like this would want to go swimming.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They came out back in like January or February... and some of the rescued girls got a bit handsy with them,&quot; Shuixing chuckled, &quot;but supposedly the pair of new Wolf Animalians that have come here from Japan have been helping them get better with some other help...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;From this &quot;Rose&quot; mentioned on Animalia Ambassadoria?&quot; Nate wondered.<br />
<br />
Shuixing nodded as they made their way down to the first floor and the baggage area, where Nate&#39;s bags were already circling on the conveyor belt for them. Nate carefully picked up his bags and then turned to head out with Shuixing at his side. As they moved to make their way out some things turned to other matters.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how are your Aunt and Blueberry doing?&quot; Shuixing wondered as they made their way across the the airport&#39;s lobby.<br />
<br />
Nate was soon digging into his pockets and pulled out his cellphone, which Shuixing recognized. It was larger and capable of handling Nate&#39;s now stronger fingers as a Water Buffalo bull, and she watched as Nate scrolled around a few sets of settings before pulling up some photos that were on the phone. He eventually brought up a pair of photos that showed Ulysses happily standing with Blueberry and one that had Meryl and Olly standing together. Shuixing could note that both Mule and Cow Animalian were bigger around the middle than they&#39;d been back during the Year of the Ox competition, though only Blueberry had come. She wasn&#39;t sure but it wouldn&#39;t be too long before Nate had half siblings and cousins born into the Bowman family.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re doing well, though right now their doctors don&#39;t want them going very far so as not to do anything that might complicate things,&quot; Nate answered, &quot;Mom seems fine with it... from the story my dad told me is that Meryl argued with her doctor over it, but so far as I know they&#39;re doing well. Hopefully they&#39;ll give birth before May or June... by then I&#39;ll have graduated and we could get married. As, you&#39;ve told me your sisters would want the wedding here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at the airport, but on Heiya Island, yes,&quot; Shuixing nodded, &quot;though I suspect there will be some debate over Christian versus Buddhist ceremonies?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate nodded, &quot;though, I&#39;d offered that two ceremonies can be held. Our minister can come along and hold the Christian ceremony and the local monks can then do the Buddhist ceremony. The only thing there would be the order...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can handle that out over the course of the week,&quot; Shuixing commented, &quot;or at least what part of the week before you have to fly back to Wisconsin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate nodded to that and they happily headed out and into more natural light. It was a bit late in the day and the sun was going down, but it was bright enough that Nate could see around and he noted that at a few corners there were now small and modest cherry trees, planed in the soil or in large pots. This came as a surprise, though he could note that many of them were starting to grow out their leaves in accordance with spring. He actually paused to look at them for a few moments. He heard Shuixing take a few steps as he looked to one that was outside the airport. Eventually her footsteps came closer to him again.<br />
<br />
&quot;They were brought in a little bit earlier in the spring,&quot; Shuixing explained, &quot;a few Japanese Animalians  that have either come her after converting or come here to convert have made requests for something that would play to &quot;cherry blossom festival.&quot; It was agreed that it would add to the beauty in places and thus put them in at street corners and so on. I think they were brought in from a part of Japan that has had warmer weather than we&#39;ve gotten here this time of year, but they still look okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So long as they get water and fertilizer they should be fine,&quot; Nate commented as he looked more closely at the tree and noted that it&#39;s size was relatively small and figured these were all fairly young trees, &quot;some of our neighbors have cherry trees, or at least one or two. It may take time for transplants to grow and flourish, but so long as whoever does the gardening knows what they&#39;re doing, they should be fine. And in time, if you can get bees, you may get cherries to eat, which will be good for pies and snacks. Though you don&#39;t want to eat the pits... because of cyanide.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm,&quot; Shuixing said slowly, &quot;I think they were brought in for the beauty of their blossoms. Something we can see and enjoy better during the day.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate nodded and then resumed walking with Shuixing. They crossed the street and then made their way toward the home that had been set up for Shuixing and her sisters.<br />
<br />
&quot;And for the evening?&quot; Nate wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;We shall enjoy dinner and some discussion with my sisters,&quot; Shuixing answered, &quot;from there... we can then have some time in private...&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate picked up short change in tone in Shuixing&#39;s voice and answered, &quot;I&#39;d like that...&quot;</p>
