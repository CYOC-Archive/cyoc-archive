<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While the Seattle PD and the FBI&#39;s Seattle Field Office agents continued looking for clues into Dymixious Drake&#39;s location and while Tom went through his morning with more cheer than would be expected given his circumstances, the subject of that investigation was settled into the house that his father had apparently arranged as a safe house in Moon Lake in case something like the present police investigation happened. It wasn&#39;t a bad house, and it did serve to keep things quiet enough so that Dymixious wasn&#39;t looking at armed normals coming after him and so his wife could get the medical care she needed that went along with being in the late stages of her pregnancy. However, that didn&#39;t mean that Dymixious was entirely pleased.<br />
<br />
His father had told him many times that the agreement between him and Akane no Tachibana was binding and that her rank as a noble would always insure the best possible treatment. For, after all, they were making sure that no rogue could EVER expose weres to the world and they were exceptionally powerful, even for a were. That deserved the best, and yet, they were in a home that wasn&#39;t much better than their own personal home elsewhere in Washington State. Granted secrecy was one thing, but supposedly Moon Lake was like many other secret were communities where everyone worked to protect that secret. In that, Moon Lake was supposed to be a place where Dymixious could do whatever he pleased, speak openly about his efforts to protect weres and be praised for it, but instead he was supposed to lay low in a middle class suburban home with no internet and no phone calls of any kind for fear of being traced.<br />
<br />
These frustrations kept Dymixious pacing at times during the day, and this Saturday morning was no exception. He was in the house&#39;s living room and pacing as he listened to the television. At least the house had cable, and he was able to watch CNN to see what they were covering. For the moment there wasn&#39;t much, at least not much that mentioned him. That was another thing that he&#39;d found irritating. He&#39;d done his best to make sure the security cameras at the hospital never caught his face when he killed Lionel Ulysses and yet the Seattle PD had managed to to somehow ID him as the assassin and got the FBI&#39;s help, which had forced him going into hiding in Moon Lake in the first place. He had no idea how they did that and that only added to his frustrations.<br />
<br />
&quot;Father wouldn&#39;t out me,&quot; Dymixious thought to himself, &quot;Father taught me everything he knows... he wouldn&#39;t out me to the Normals after doing what he&#39;s done for years...&quot;<br />
<br />
His pacing was interrupted by a knock at the front door. The knock was soft enough for him to know that no one was trying to force anything on him. With that he made his way to the door and opened it, revealing a man who looked to be in his twenties to early thirties, but then, most weres looked like that. His black hair and and his eyes showed an oriental heritage and the fact that his scent identified him as a werefox was enough to identified the the man was likely related to Akane no Tachibana, though how closely was unknown to Dymixious. He merely stood and eyed the werefox before him. Eventually he bowed politely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning,&quot; the werefox said politely, &quot;I am Taro Tachibana...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t look like the doctor,&quot; Dymixious interrupted.<br />
<br />
&quot;He is my Uncle, sir,&quot; Taro Tachibana spoke, &quot;but I am not here to discuss my family relations.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps you would like to explain the lack of respect I deserve,&quot; Dymixious answered in  a low voice.<br />
<br />
If this werefox was intimidated, he didn&#39;t show it. He only blinked and then answered calmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;The request your father made was to provide you with a means to stay out of trouble until the heat over your actions carries through,&quot; Taro Tachibana answered, &quot;which we&#39;ve done. That does not, however, mean you would be treated as a major celebrity, as that would only bring attention to you and Moon Lake at a time when that cannot be afforded.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dymixious frowned. He&#39;d heard some rumors about some outside Normal causing trouble which might have the risk of were exposure. He had made a phone call to help, but had found that in that, Akane no Tachibana wouldn&#39;t allow it and stated that the deal with his father was not going to allow for any further favors. It was something he didn&#39;t like, but for the moment he couldn&#39;t afford to get into too much of an argument, even though he felt he deserved more.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you&#39;d let me help, these interlopers would be dead the moment they arrive and can be dealt with in comfort,&quot; Dymixious pointed out after a few moments.<br />
<br />
&quot;And further risk Moon Lake?&quot; Taro Tachibana spoke, &quot;given that the police and FBI are onto the actions taken in Seattle... No, thank you. For the moment, that situation is well under control and does not require &quot;help.&quot;  At least not the sort of help you want to provide.&quot;<br />
<br />
Again Dymixious frowned. He stood by as Taro Tachibana then continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;And at preset, we would request that you remain here for the morning,&quot; Taro Tachibana continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d already agreed to remain in Moon Lake until things quieted down and until after my wife gave birth,&quot; Dymixious answered, his irritation obvious in his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was referring to staying in this specific residence for the morning hours,&quot; Taro Tachibana answered, &quot;at least... as Moon Lake cannot have anything that would potentially betray your presence to outside law enforcement at the present time and keep the present Jenkins/Harper wedding safe. We will call when it is safe for you to leave this residence.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t presume...&quot; Dymixious began, nearly losing his temper over the issue.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is ultimately for your safety just as much as the wedding&#39;s safety,&quot; Taro spoke, &quot;If something goes on and Federal authorities are drawn to Moon Lake, they may notice your presence, and they will certainly try to arrest you. You would be doing yourself a favor just as much as you would be doing us a favor.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dymixious growled and clinched his fists. He had to admit that the werefox had a point, but he still figured that their actions represented an overly complex situation and that things could be handled far simpler than they were. And if his place was more appropriately respected that simple solution would be used and would benefit Moon Lake in the long run as rogue Weres and nosy Normals could cause trouble the longer they were allowed to go free. Killing them did everyone a favor. It protected Normals from the things they feared and protected Weres from being exposed, and for the most part, Dymixious and has father had gotten away with that for the better part of two hundred years. The fact that the Seattle PD and the FBI&#39;s Seattle Field Office got his name in association with Lionel Ulysses&#39; death was a surprise that had never really happened before and Dymixious really didn&#39;t see the need to alter the behaviors of a lifetime that had achieved lasting success.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; Dymixious grumbled, &quot;I will stay here...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Taro Tachibana answered and then turned.<br />
<br />
Taro Tachibana walked away quite quietly and didn&#39;t look back to see Dymixious shut the door. He knew enough that the the were-komodo-dragon was powerful and came from a English noble family and was old enough to lack the ability to easily see that the world was changing or in fact had changed. It was something that would cause problems as the world did in fact change. Taro didn&#39;t know how Seattle&#39;s law enforcement agencies got Dymixious&#39;s name, but he figured that there was something that Dymixious had done that had put either his name or his face somewhere that the police did pick up on. In this, Taro well knew the situation was complicated, as if Dymixious was found in Moon Lake there could a a lot of potential negative consequences, and the simplest solution wouldn&#39;t really lessen the issues at hand, and with the Harper/Jenkins wedding to be handled, that wasn&#39;t an option. The best they could hope for, would be that the wedding goes smoothly and the hunt for Dymixious cools off in the near future, allowing the egotistical were-komodo-dragon to leave. But that would take time...</p>
