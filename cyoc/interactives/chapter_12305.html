<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;GOTCHA!!!&quot; screamed Carl, interrupting the two Speedo Fags as he pounced through the shadows. Roughly, he shoved the man closest to him to the ground, not recognising it as Matt. The other man got up and ran back the alley, a distorted wailing sound echoing from his mouth.<br />
&quot;Dammit!&quot; Carl muttered, seeing the retreating red Speedo fade into the night. &quot;Well, at least I got something!&quot; he exclaimed as he leant down over the dazed body of Matt. The Speedo Fag lifted his head weakly, but Carl clamped a large damp piece of cloth over his mouth, and within seconds the body became limp again. Grabbing a jacket off the ground, Carl carefully wrapped the body in such a way that he could carry it without his skin coming into contact with the Speedo Fag's. <br />
<br />
Several hours later, Matt came to, lying at the bottom of a large cage in a familiar room.<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; he muttered confusedly as he tried to identify where he was. A sudden burst of smell filled his nose: Pete's briefs, the ones he had found earlier that night. He was in Pete's basement; locked in the cage Pete had set up.<br />
&quot;Well well well...wakey wakey,&quot; came a voice from behind him. Matt spun around, clawing wildly at the cold metal bars in a desperate attempt to escape.<br />
&quot;Aren't we a little excited today?&quot; the voice laughed. Matt saw Carl smiling at him through the shadows. Snarling, Matt hurled himself against the bars of the cage. Carl flinched in fear, but laughed nervously when he saw Matt gripping at his arm painfully.<br />
&quot;It's no use trying to escape. You're locked in tight,&quot; Carl told Matt. Matt realised that Carl didn't recognise him as a Speedo Fag. There might still be a way out of this...<br />
<br />
Carl sat down in the arm chair facing the cage and rubbed his chin calulatingly, watching Matt pace around the small cage. After a few minutes, Matt sat down too, his legs spread wide apart. Carl winced a little as Matt began to rub his crotch slowly. <br />
&quot;Hey, cut that out!&quot; Carl exclaimed angrily. Matt glared at Carl, who looked slightly digusted back at Matt. They sat quietly, eyeing each other down, not moving a muscle. Matt's eyes flickered to a clock positioned on the wall behind Carl. 4:00. <br />
Matt vaguely remembered that if the sun rose, then he'd really be in trouble. He estimated that he had about 3 hours at most before it was too late. Carl looked over his shoulder to see what Matt was looking at. Matt hurriedly threw himself against the metal bars again, sending a sharp pain up his muscular arm. Gradually, he pulled himself into a fetal position and began to moan softly.<br />
<br />
Carl hesitated, but approached the cage against his better judgement anyway. Slowly, he edged closer and closer to Matt.<br />
&quot;Hey, are you okay?&quot; Carl asked unsurely. No reply.<br />
Carl bent over at the cage and looked over the curled up figure to see where he was hurt. Suddenly, with a great shout, Matt sprung up, his arms flailing wildly at Carl.<br />
&quot;Shit!&quot; Carl shouted angrily as he weaved out of the grasp of Matt.<br />
&quot;You freaking little shit. You try that crap again, and I'll put a knife in you, ya hear?&quot; Carl bellowed. &quot;Son of a bitch...&quot; Carl muttered to himself as he moved over to the telephone on the tabel.<br />
&quot;Better call in some reinforcements then...&quot; Carl thought aloud as he picked up the receiver and dialed Pete's phone number. Matt knew he wouldn't be able to take on two of them at once; even taking care of one would be a challenge. A rush of animal instinct tore through his body...he'd let the Speedo Fag part of him get itself out of this one...<br />
<br />
Matt began howling loudly, the animal-esque roar tearing through the house.<br />
&quot;Would you SHUT UP?!?!?!?&quot; Carl screamed over the howling as he tried to hear whether or not Pete had picked up the phone. Between a set of howls, Carl heard the clicking as Pete answered his mobile phone.<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; came the slightly excited voice of Pete. Matt howled again, the unearthly sound causing the hair's on the back of Carl's neck to raise. Shuddering, Carl placed a hand on the receiver to cover the mouth piece.<br />
&quot;I SAID SHUT...&quot; Carl shouted, but then realised he felt dizzy. &quot;Up...&quot; he finished groggily.<br />
&quot;Anyone there?&quot; Pete's voice sounded. Matt howled again, louder.<br />
Carl raised the receiver to his lips but couldn't form a sentence with his mouth.<br />
&quot;Bloody hell...&quot; Pete grumbled impatiently. Carl dropped the phone to the floor and fumbled for his neck, as if he were choking. Matt took a deep breath, that let out one long piercing howl. Carl opened his mouth to scream; but he could hardly breathe.<br />
&quot;Ahhhhhhhhhhooooouuuuuu!!!&quot; Carl's scream gradually changed to the same pitch as Matt's howl. Carl stopped, surprised at himself for howling with the Speedo Fag. His head jerked sideways a little. He felt like he was about to pass out. <br />
&quot;Shutttuh uhhhhpp...&quot; Carl slurred, pointing groggily at Matt, who had stopped howling a minute ago and was now watching excitedly at the doubled over figure.<br />
<br />
Panting heavily, Carl held himself upright by leaning against the chair he had sat in.<br />
&quot;What...the...hell...did...you...do...to...me?&quot; he asked in between breaths. Matt sat silently in the cage, an odd smile on his lips.<br />
Carl's chest suddenly felt hot all over. Rubbing his hands vigorously across his sweaty singlet, Carl managed to drag it over his head. He didn't notice how defined his abs had become in the last few minutes. Moaning in a slight pain, Carl began to slowly wipe the sweat off of his chest using the singlet. He looked up at Matt, who was still smiling in the semi-darkness.<br />
&quot;You...what did...you?&quot; Carl began, but suddenly a stomach pain forced him to run to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Gripping his bare chest with one hand, he began splashing water onto his face with the other. Carelessly, he swung a large handful across his shorts.<br />
&quot;Bloody hell,&quot; he mumbled, half registiring the dampness against his pulsating penis.<br />
Back in the basement, Carl could hear the sound of clanking metal again. Rolling his eyes backwards for a second, Carl trudged back to the cage, feeling like he was about to pass out. <br />
&quot;Stop...that...&quot; Carl gasped between chest cramps at Matt who seemed to be becoming more and more excited. Suddenly, Carl was on the floor, sprawled across the carpet.<br />
&quot;Oh God...no...NO!!!&quot; Carl shouted, as if to keep a grip on himself, to remain awake. He clenched his fists into tight balls. Carl looked up at Matt, who had began masturbating again through his Speedo. Carl smiled weakly. That did look sorta like fun, he thought to himself. He lowered one hand down to his own erected penis. It really didn't matter to him anymore. His senses returned briefly, screaming at him. He was surprised at himself, but then a second later, the only thing that he found bothering him was the fact he was still wearing his shorts. Carl unzipped his fly, and slowly slid his shorts down past his thighs and down onto the floor, now only wearing a pair of black briefs. Nervously, he pulled the waist band down to the base of his crotch, revealing his stiff erection. Carl began to feel short of breath again. Slowly, he took his penis in his hand, and began to masturbate. As if feeling the pleasure, Matt fell onto his back and began groaning happily, his own erection stiffening in his Speedo, but still, Carl continued.<br />
 <br />
As the heat built up in Carl, the muscles in his chest tightened again. He never felt so alive; rubbing his penis up and down as if he were a child first discovering the pleasures of masturbation. He could feel it now, spreading across his crotch and moving upward through his shaft.<br />
&quot;Oh!!!&quot; Matt and Carl moaned in unison. Carl let go of the waist band of his black briefs in excitement, letting them snap back onto the base of his cock. Then, he came on himself. <br />
Matt howled again, as if he too had just finished masturbating.<br />
However, this felt different to Carl. His briefs were tingling as the cum faded into them, and his erection still felt like it needed to be rubbed down. A resonating howl from Matt somehow caused Carl's cum to tingle even more than before, and it continued until the tingling had spread across his body. Suddenly, the waist of the black briefs crept upward over his steady erection, and he watched on as they began turning a rust color.<br />
<br />
Grunting, Carl forced himself off the ground and stumbled over to the cage. Matt didn't attack this time. Carl flexed his steadily forming biceps and began to pry the bars off of the cage to free Matt. The metal was tightly inserted though, and could barely budge. Focusing all of his strength, Carl attempted to force the bars apart again, his face turning a steady red, and along with it, his briefs. The more he squatted and pushed on the bars, the more red his briefs turned, but he was too intent on shifting the bars too care. Finally, Carl's briefs had taken on the same color as Matt's Speedo. Feeling a sudden rush of sexual energy, Carl roared intensely as the bars slowly began to part under his muscular arms' grip. Matt crawled across the cage and began helping at this point, and within seconds the bars were completely wedged open. Carl grunted again, slightly exhausted. Matt wrapped his arms around Carl's bare back, letting them slide down until they rested on Carl's ass. Carl swallowed nervously, but as Matt sealed his lips over his and bit gently at Carl's lower lip, he lost all of his prior inhibitions. The cotton on his briefs changed to nylon, and instantaneously he felt more sexual urges filling his body. Grunting wildly, he wrapped his own hands around Matt, sliding his hands down within the red Speedo so he could touch everywhere. Matt began to slowly kiss downwards, trailing from Carl's neck, across his tight chest and down to just above Carl's own Speedo. He glanced up cautiously, but Carl placed his hands on the back of Matt's head and pushed for him to go on. Matt breathed in the smell of fresh cum mixed with Speedo from Carl's crotch, and slowly let his tongue slide across the smooth surface of the Speedo with the etched shape of Carl's erected penis pushing outward, quivering gently. <br />
<br />
Carl, tilting his head back, howled deeply, falling into Matt's arms as they continued to kiss each other.</p>
