<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The darkness of Wendy's stall proved to be a blessing as Kevin milled about with Joe. The morning light shone through a skylight high above in the roof over the big box stall.<br />
<br />
Kevin stood feeling the thousands of new and strange sensations like those Wendy had also learned of on her first day as a true animal. If being naked to the world was his worst fear the feeling of being covered in hair was certainly his second. Odd he thought how the swinging tail which brushed his hairy butt seemed to help calm him.<br />
<br />
Wendy got up from where she had laid down for her night's snooze and greeted Kevin as one of her own. Joe too walked over and had a warm feeling for the male who only the evening before had given such a neat experiance.<br />
<br />
All this attention would have been a loving blessing to Kevin except his stature and status had changed. Standing on all fours was comfortable and still very strange. Hoofs which were the night before hands touched the ground if a dull feeling way. The desire to stretch his fingers out straight and flex them as theynow felt stiff made him all the more aware of his stature.<br />
<br />
Normally he would be walking the stalls bring food stuffs, water and an occasional dark beer to the draft animals. He stood thinking about his old duties and the silly ponderings of giving Draft horses, draft dark beer in their grain rations. Yet those were his orders and do it he did, but oh those big belly's burst the gas later in clouds of equine stench.<br />
<br />
The voice of the Doctor showing some new trainee or a volunteer the daily duties soon filled his long ears. Wendy the lovely girl she was still showed her friendly attitude with the coming of her feeding time. Kevin watched as she thanked the person who would bring her food and water. He thought of how this along with her new and past beauty had drawn him to show his love.<br />
<br />
Joe stood side by side with Kevin as the Doctor beamed a smile at them. The trainee held two musty old feedbags and with few words slipped them over the muzzels of the two hungry males. Kevin's first meal found the grain and dust being snorted up into his nostrils making him cough. A huge tongue reached out to lick and let the grain seeds stick to it and be dragged into the mouth for chewing. Even as he ate as he could Kevin had memories of wishing to wash those feedbags if not for the animals, then for his small nose.<br />
<br />
With eating quickly done the demand to drink was overwhelming. Into the five gallon white plastic bucked went Wendy's pretty muzzel. Then Joe slurped up his fill and at last Kevin had a turn. Looking down his long funny face he wanted to drink bad. The bucket still looked clean but the film of horse and donkey green saliva floating on top of his water made Kevin stop and consider.<br />
<br />
A new much bigger nose brought the scents of Wendy and Joe up from the remaining water. A drink was needed after a bag of dry grain, but as he lowered his eyes past the rim of the bucket the true feeling of lowliness his home.<br />
<br />
Slap, slurp, gulp, cough, Kevin drank his first gulps of water in a donkey sort of way. Behind him Wendy made sounds which seemed of laughter. She remembered her first drink with muzzeled face, thick lips, and not knowing whether to lap or suck up the blessed liquid.<br />
<br />
Water dripping from his thick lips Kevin raised his head to look at Wendy. As two of the morning duties were over the next two seemed to Kevin as one wishing for human privacy.<br />
<br />
Wendy went first as she spread her hind legs and lengthened her stance. Suddenly a strong stream of bright yellow urine shot from behind her and splashed on the rear wall of the big box stall.<br />
<br />
Joe being a male animal went over for a sniff of her wonderous scent. Now even as he stood with his nose only inches from her soaking wet straw, his big donkey dong fell out it's sheath. Quickly the passion of that moment built his donkey cock to one straining to bust.<br />
<br />
Kevin stood watching the ritual from the other side of the stall. Oggling with his new and strange vision he watched intently the donkey cock strain into a rigid shaft. The funny colors of black at it's base and the moddled coloring to almost a tan color at the flared flat end. <br />
<br />
It was then that a old past thought came to mind. Kevin's parent had him circumsized and his own human penis had a domed end. Now the sight of Joe's shaft made Kevin really wonder how such a flat flared shaft could enter the sexy lips of a mare? To enter Wendy his own penis would eek the lips of her sex open with the round curve of that sensual head. Oh but now he too had a shaft like Joe and with it he wondered the possible feelings of pressing it into some female donkey.<br />
Indeed the need for the mare's slick juices would at that time and place be an absolute. A flat ended, dry shaft would be rather tough to press into those normally dry tight lips of equine sex. <br />
<br />
All these previously unconsidered facts were now in the forefront of his considerations. Suddenly as Joe's cock erupted with his morning stream of yellow Kevin jerked his head to attention.<br />
<br />
The morning was filled with watching the others go about the desires and bodily needs of horse and donkey. These animals were in his care before and those things never even were considered. Now he thought very seriously of their actions, as stance, and body attitudes had new meanings.<br />
<br />
A rich scent of mare urine mixed with the sour stench of Joe's and filled the air inside their stall. Kevin shook his bigger head as scents enter the nostrils and quickly became thoughts in his changing brain. Turning to look at what felt very odd Kevin watched his donkey cock stretch forth to meet it's first grand showing.<br />
<br />
Now it was Wendy's turn to watch Kevin as his bladder released the flow. Blinking his eyes Kevin stood rigid above and below as the stream spewed from the end of his new honored member.<br />
<br />
Joe stood still sniffing the puddle of mare urine as he filled his little mind with the instincts of this most passionate moment. Stretched and strained to reach his nostrils close to her scent he was now erect and the cock bounced off the hairy belly. Kevin began to watch this what he knew was a male donkey about to masterbate.<br />
<br />
It was easy for Kevin to see how much built up passion was welling up in Joe. A look up at Wendy showed her passion but due to her height Joe would need a ladder to reach his ultimate desire. It was as he watched the useless hope of mounting passion in Joe and Wendy's willing stance, Kevin realized his and Joe's place at the farm.<br />
<br />
Unless a pony mare was willing or rank with desire both Joe and Kevin had no chance to feel their passion. Yet to sniff the scent of a mare and stand in barn, corral, or pasture only to masterbate there spewing the hot seed on the ground was such a letdown.<br />
<br />
Kevin snorted loudly which at the moment broke Wendy's thoughts of passion and made Joe turn a look. The dull look which Joe had showed his mental desire for the rich feeling of sexual passion. He could see by the old donkey's stance just how much he wanted to be humping a female. The expression which Joe showed of eyes half closed, lips partially open and his head hung so low that the semen he jocked out was dripping from the hair on that gray chin.<br />
<br />
A plopping sound brought notice of Wendy's morning manure pile growing to new heights in the corner where she stood. Now another scent hit Kevin's senses and with it the beastial drives kicked in.<br />
<br />
As Kevin's bladder finished it's duty he too held a tail high and dropped a mound of stench. As he stepped away the three seemed to mill about the stall drinking in the smells of the other's leavings. Minutes passed and after some time of wandering in circles Kevin stopped suddenly and raised his head high.<br />
<br />
Stink and instincts had a direct relation on their social patterns. A thought became the rationalization of his changed lifestyle. Suddenly the fact of his change was quite apparent in his recent actions. Thinking for a moment as a man again Kevin noticed how his sensual body was taking over the reasoning mind. He was not thinking thoughts but instead learning patterns of action and reaction. These were the ways to life for an animal and he was for fact now a very animalistic beast with a weakening mind.<br />
<br />
A creaking sound and the three looked toward the dutch door to their home. As it opened Kevin caught sight of the Doctor and one of his previous animal control helpers. Lynn was a tough guy and had helped many a time with animals or volunteers who were not cooperative as they changed. Now he was here for his manager now a donkey in disguise.<br />
<br />
Lynn steps over to Kevin and presses over his head a bridle and the steel bit to control the beast he was. Standing docile he let the man do his work knowing that to fight would be both futile and painful.<br />
<br />
Wendy whinnied a good bye as Kevin was led out the stall and out of sight.<br />
<br />
Down the isleway Kevin's hoofs clipity clopped and the sound brought a new feeling of uforia. As scents dulled his thinking, now sounds did their part to tear down the last of Kevin's thought patterns.<br />
<br />
Standing calm and willing he watched as Lynn picked up leg after leg and attached small steel shoes to each hoof. A shake of his head and twitching of an ear was due to the tight hold Lynn held as the Doctor Tatooed a number inside the new donkeylike ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;21-090303, there my new donkey you are a recorded piece of property to the Sunrise Farm. I don't understand the way your change occured? The speed to which this new form took hold was one which I must check into. If I could increase the speed of change our experiments could triple and with them the profit margin and our wages too! Lynn here has been informed of who you were and is looking forward to being a big helper to your new life. I have awarded him your apartment and your status on the farm since you have now accepted a lower status.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now with every passing instance Kevin felt his animal self becoming the true self. Looking up he felt his shorter and lowly place like never before. Even when being hollarded at when pushing paper in an office he felt still a man when the clock chimed five. Now the clock lost it's meaning in this world of animal life. The five O clock would never come and he was on duty as a male donkey day and night till the last second of life.<br />
<br />
Shoes nailed to hoofs Kevin found himself turned out to graze the large pasture and meet the horses he'd fed and kept. Now though he stood on a new level and was subserviant to the larger beasts.</p>
