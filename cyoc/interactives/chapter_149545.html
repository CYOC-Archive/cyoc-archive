<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You saw the twinkle in Fall&#39;s eyes, and you couldn&#39;t help but be aroused. You knew what was coming before she said it, even as you waited for her to voice it. People had always marveled at how perfect the two of you were for each other. High school romances rarely lasted long once young lovers discovered the breadth of the real world, with its temptations and promises, but you two had always stuck together, having barely had a fight more severe than a mild disagreement. Your friends would always confide to the two of you that they wished they had what you and Fall had-that perfect love with an unspoken understanding.<br />
<br />
The reality, or at least part of it, was that you&#39;d both discovered that you were into a very particular fetish, one that had shaped your sexual awakenings with each other. While neither of you was a virgin when you&#39;d started dating, you each had only had a couple of experiences, and none of them quite as good as you&#39;d hoped. And then you&#39;d seen the movie “Cat People”, and both become entranced by the story of a brother and sister who transformed into panthers when they had sex with normal humans.<br />
<br />
That night, Fall had teased you, saying “What would you do if I turned into a cat when I had an orgasm?” And she&#39;d proceeded to tease you as she played with herself until she came hard, then climbed on top of you with prowling body language, being somewhat dominant and wild. It had aroused you to a level you didn&#39;t realize you could reach, and you&#39;d fucked roughly, turned on by the thought of her transforming, which was accented and egged on by her roleplaying.<br />
<br />
Afterward, you two had talked about how yeah, this really turned you both on quite a lot. As the weeks, months, and years went on, the fantasy grew to be a rather prominent part of your relationship. While it wasn&#39;t the ONLY thing you had in common, and while it wasn&#39;t a perpetual part of your bedroom antics, it was definitely something that kept the fires burning long after many couples would have tired of it and grown apart.<br />
<br />
It became more specific, that the change never hurt, that you could trigger at least a partial shift without sex, though to fully change, either sex or a full orgasm had to happen. That unlike a normal cat, your dick wasn&#39;t barbed, and that your tongues were softer than a cat&#39;s. (Though still slightly rough.) You two were contagious, able to spread it through sex or biting, just like a werewolf could.  You could revert at will. You kept most of your human minds, though accented and deeply affected by the animal side. And finally, that both of you put off pheromones that broke the will of anyone you focused on.<br />
<br />
That was when you two discovered that Fall was at least semi-bisexual. While the two of you had never actually brought a third party into the bedroom, you guys had come very close a couple of times, and had privately talked about what certain women would look like as they changed, or what breed of cat they might be. Possibly the biggest reason why you&#39;d never followed through on the fantasy was the fear that one of you might slip and share your feline transformation kink with someone who wasn&#39;t of like-mind, and be shunned for it.<br />
<br />
You bought minor cosmetic items to complete the illusion, at least on some level. Both of you had costume cat-eye contacts, tails, and fake ears and movie-quality fangs for both upper and lower teeth, to help with the fantasy.  You&#39;d devised detailed scenarios, switching roles from seducer to victim for either of you as the mood hit. Sometimes you met a strange woman who wanted to be fucked hard and made to transform into the cat. Other times, she was a reluctant waif who had to share her secret and was afraid you&#39;d reject her. Other times, you were her slave or she was yours.On occasion, you were both werecats who&#39;d smelled each other and were drawn inexorably to one another.  Because you both enjoyed both sides of the change, both as observer and shifter, your sex lives were fluid, perfectly matched because neither of you always had to be dominant or submissive. And while all of these were wonderful and fulfilling, there was always the barest hint of regret that in the end, neither of you would actually transform. But now..now you had the ring. And you knew what Fall was going to say, but you still let her say it. You liked the eager tone in her voice that she was struggling to contain.<br />
<br />
 “Can the ring change people?” she asked. Her nipples were erect, and she chewed her bottom lip.<br />
<br />
 “I assume so, but there&#39;s really only one way to find out,” you said as it fully dawned on you precisely what this could mean.<br />
<br />
“Then wish for our fantasy to be made real,” she said,  “Exactly as we always have wanted.”<br />
<br />
You closed your eyes, picturing the entirety of your fantasy, of what it was to BE a werecat. You focused on it, because you didn&#39;t want the ring to screw this up, because it could go wrong if the ring chose to interpret your wording poorly. You knew the ring could read intent – you&#39;d only wished to be in the apartment, and you&#39;d both been transported safely, as opposed to materializing inside the walls. You&#39;d asked for a better apartment, and it had given you a color scheme you liked, a pool which you&#39;d always wanted, and a large kitchen for Fall, who enjoyed cooking as a hobby. And so, once you&#39;d made a strong point to visualize your fantasy, you felt rather confident as you spoke.<br />
<br />
“I wish that Fall and I were the werecats that we&#39;ve always wanted to be,” you said.</p>
