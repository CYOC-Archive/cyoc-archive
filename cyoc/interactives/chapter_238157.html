<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Callum knew as he typed up the change he had in mind that there was only really one thing he wanted of Daryl and his friends. In his mind, he thought that maybe a sister would be less awful to him than a brother - not to mention the idea of having two girls so close by. And Callum being Callum, he immediately was thinking about his romantic chances with them. He had after all just entered proper puberty, and had extremely potent artificial testosterone pumped into him for both quite some time and imminently. He bit his lip as he thought about Daryl&#39;s friends Jay and Simon being turned into girls.<br />
<br />
Girls were a thing that Callum was just really starting to notice. Enough that when his friend had voiced the idea of peeking in on the older girls at their K thru 12 School, the young bully boy had enthusiastically nodded at the idea. He remembered going home after they successfully looked in, not a soul the wiser...and then he promptly fucking jacked off like 3 times in an hour. His fantasies occupied by images of those girls fawning over him at one of the contests his dad made him do. <br />
<br />
Even in the realm of fantasy, there was an imposition. Albeit with something to empower him. He saw it as him there without his dad. Getting to enjoy a foreign city and somewhere far away from his mom and dad. These groupie girls who&#39;d look at him. They&#39;d look at him, not dad. He&#39;d be the stud. And his dad could sit at home and eat ice cream outta the tub like a fucking loser.<br />
<br />
He imagined himself older, bigger, stronger and less awkward...and them just touching his body. Affirming it as his. Not something his dad had made. Letting Callum know he was big. He was his own man. And that---shit shit shit, there he was again. Callum grinned as he looked at the settings he could alter and adjust. Jay and Simon were sixteen and seventeen, respectively. And Callum could make them become 18. Just like the---like the girls in the locker room.<br />
<br />
Blushing and typing out the changes he wanted, Callum figured he could make the change take a while. Daryl and his buddies had made things difficult enough for him. So he figured that making em go through a protracted, intense transformation would be fair as far as these things went. When Callum saw the pictures that depicted what they&#39;d be like when they were done though...he let out a little gasp and fixated for a minute.<br />
<br />
They would be athletic, tall and pretty girls - slightly tanned and with nice makeup. They&#39;d probably be on the cheer team, rather than nerdy girls, and their bodies were fit, toned, and they&#39;d be wearing athleisure.<br />
<br />
Looking at the breasts---the---the big fucking tits...Callum was blushing. Callum was blushing, and he knew if he kept looking he was gonna just start gooning all over his bed. So he went ahead and decided to give em a personality shift too. He knew what a bimbo was. And he figured if anything, that would give him the best chance with the new Jay and Simon. They&#39;d be turning into sexy bimbos eager to please. That produced some shifts in the end result pictures for the two.<br />
<br />
Now they had the same athletic bodies, but the breasts were even bigger, and their tans were deeper. Their hair had been dyed to be that all too familiar blonde look, curled and wavy, thick mascara and makeup, pink nails, and showy clothes. They were going to be Callum&#39;s dream girls. He was gonna get sexed up bimbo babes who were gonna---who were gonna---!!<br />
<br />
And Callum started both working on the length of the change, the exact amount of time it would take to complete...as well as palming his erection with his free hand. His blush was intense, and he was already thinking about (poorly conceived and thoroughly adolescent) fantasies about these imaginary women. Callum thought about walking out of the shower, and then they just start cooing over him - looking at him like he&#39;s the fucking man of the house. Not his---not his dad...!<br />
<br />
But then as he started the transformation on Daryl and his buddies, watching the percentage gauges on there slowly filling up, Callum jumped back on to his bed and began reaching into his boxers. He wondered if he should give his buddies a bit of an upgrade. He wasn&#39;t gonna go and turn them into girls, but he figured that they might appreciate being able to keep up better in the school weight room with him. Probably not on his level though.<br />
<br />
As much as it was all pretty complicated for him, Callum did like being the only 13 year old in the whole school who could bench press 225 for 4 reps.<br />
<br />
But then as he got into his fantasies about the women, thinking about them touching him, of him touching their breasts...he realized something. The reason that his buddies had to go and sneak their looks at the older girls rather than just try and ask them out already. Even as Callum indulged in fantasy, an inkling of a realization hit him right when he was enjoying some nice, relaxing self pleasure - and he almost bit his tongue as the realization fully hit him.<br />
<br />
He had to sneak around, and do all that...because they were eighteen. And he was thirteen. And women didn&#39;t like to go out with guys who were that much younger than them. Callum almost thrashed in his bed as he awkwardly pulled his hand back from his groin. The blush still on his face as he realized that he had made a rather severe misjudgement of the way things were probably gonna turn out. He&#39;d made it so the girls would be 18.<br />
<br />
And Callum...would still be 13. <br />
<br />
They would totally just see him as the annoying little step-brother of their best friend, and they&#39;d instead all be chatting about how hot someone else was. And if Callum was really unlucky? That someone would be his dad. Even being replaced in fantasies by his dad made Callum utterly furious - his amorous mood forgotten in an utter roid rage at the very concept. He punched his pillow several times and kicked at his bed, his lack of forethought obvious...<br />
<br />
&quot;Fucking dad is just gonna be seen as---fuck!!&quot; Callum glared at the window, wondering initially if it was too late to cancel the transformations. He certainly knew that he would sustain a lot of mental damage if he ever had to so much as hear the women he worked on changing talking about that perverse narcissist in that way...<br />
<br />
Such was his reaction, initially.<br />
<br />
At least, until he realized something else. A moment of pure eureka hit Callum all at once, and his mood swung back to glee and excitement. He still had something in here that they all had no idea about. And nothing was even set in stone yet. The transformations on Daryl and his buddies hardly even started. So there was plenty of time to make himself a more appealing option to the women his brother&#39;s buddies were gonna become.<br />
<br />
Callum looked at the computer still running the Chronivac. Maybe...maybe he could change himself, too. Checking on the service, he noted there was a limit of 10 concurrent transformations that could be initialized. And these were filled out with both transformations at the stage of being filled out, as well as finished transformations waiting on the duration...<br />
<br />
Of course, this led to another question.<br />
<br />
How much further did Callum want to go? He certainly didn&#39;t want to be a college guy or anything. And he definitely didn&#39;t want to become as old as his dad. Callum also had no idea how his own aging process would look. He just hoped that he&#39;d get to be the kind of guy they&#39;d go out with. And there was also the option of mental changes...<br />
<br />
...Which Callum enthusiastically rejected in terms of applying them to himself. He wanted to stay as close to who he was as humanly possible. And just---just have himself but in an older body. Something about doing mental changes on himself kinda spooked the youth. But for now, he needed to make a decision on how old he wanted to be...<br />
<br />
------<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Daryl and his friends were out, heading to the local supermarket to get some food to enjoy on their way back to Daryl&#39;s place. They assumed that the strange tingling feeling that each had felt in turn was just their stomachs acting up for lack of food. After all, they hadn&#39;t eaten in some time, and figured thus it would just be something so simple. Not that Daryl&#39;s moody little jock brother had acquired a piece of software that could change someone. That would be insane, after all.<br />
<br />
Jay was talking about how much he&#39;d like to get a chicken sandwich from the market deli. His straight brown hair and dark eyes gave him a bit more charm than the average nerd. And Daryl swore there was a bit more curl today in Jay&#39;s hair. He dressed in a white long sleeved shirt and jeans, and he, like Simon and Daryl, was a skinny guy.<br />
<br />
Simon meanwhile was every bit as skinny, but kept his light brown hair usually in a buzz cut, apparently because his dad was military or something. He dressed in a logo t-shirt and pants. Always keen to advertise his fandom. Though Daryl swore that Simon&#39;s hair was slightly longer than usual, and slightly lighter.<br />
<br />
And so, none the wiser as to what was going on back at home, they chatted about the recent events. As far as Daryl was concerned, his life with his stepmom was interrupted - rudely so - by his new stepdad, who was himself a disgusting piece of work that Daryl one day hoped to see tossed out on his ass for good. But then there was the surly, arrogant little shit that walked around even in the colder holidays with his shirt off. He was pushy, and snide, and---and linked to the step-dad. <br />
<br />
And Daryl knew well about the kinds of guys that the little shit hanged out with.<br />
<br />
So what, Daryl was a bit sarcastic to him in turn. That was all he really saw it as. Just a bit of sarcasm, a bit of snark, and if the little shit couldn&#39;t take that, womp fucking womp. That was what he got for hanging out with the dere---dere---bad scum of the earth that was those two idiots at the school. Weird brain fart, Daryl thought briefly, but he figured he was just hungry.<br />
<br />
Though he had to admit as he heard Jay and Simon doing an impression of his kid brother, he could get to enjoy a bit of a distraction while they walked. The others were no greater fans of the little shit than he was. He had positively regaled them with stories about what he saw Callum doing at school. All the bullying, picking on guys smaller than him, pushing people around. So Jay took it as a moral imperative to dunk on Callum whenever possible.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Simon just kind of saw Callum as a freak. A weirdo. A little guy who pumped himself full of steroids well in advance of his actual puberty. And as far as Simon was concerned, being a freak like that suggested that everything else was rooted in that rot. Not that Simon had any idea of what went on with Mr. Thornton.<br />
<br />
Nor did any of them have any idea about the changes they would be undergoing.</p>
