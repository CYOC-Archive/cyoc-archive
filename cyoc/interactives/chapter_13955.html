<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brandon looks up at Rick's hardening cock.  Above it, he could see the hairs up into his navel filling in with a coat of gray fur.  On Rick's left shoulder an odd black splotch of hair was surfacing, another quickly cropping up along his gut.  Brandon cries, his conscience wrenched in the conflict of his body's want but his mind's revulsion.  His mind wanders back to the depravity he endured by his stepfather's hands before.  His eyes water, realizing how much larger his stepfather was going to become.  “I don't want to get fucked.”  his deepening voice whimpers.<br />
<br />
Rick saw his cock lengthening at the bottom of his periphery, feeling sympathy for what the boy would likely have to accommodate again.  He leans forward, touching his stepson's shoulder apologetically.  He tries to think, just a few words to help Brandon cope, ones he couldn't find.  Rick's gut tenses harshly, causing him to stoop and lean against Brandon.  Beneath his palm he feels the fuzz pushing over Brandon's shoulders.  He could see Brandon's ears pull up into canine, possibly feline, like tips.  His nose was darkening, getting slick as he drew breaths over burgeoning senses.  Deep empathy wells in him, and he turns towards the door then slumps to the floor.  Rick looks over his side, catching Brandon's arms build bulkier.  He wheezes out to Brandon, “You owe me...”  Brandon looks up, his yellow eyes wild, the man inside subdued.  Rick leans forward, presenting his rear, it's flicking young tail, upwards to the beast.  “Owe me big.”<br />
<br />
Brandon's hand grips along Rick's thighs, and the beast pulls itself onto Rick's back.  The creature fumbles it's fat cock head up along Rick's crease, driving madly down once contacting Rick's folds.  Rick cringes.  His temples burn, horn nubs and all.  The creature buries itself deep within, beginning to piston forcefully.  Rick feels the creature seem to shrink along his back, knowing it was himself only getting larger.  Rick's leathery hand grabs down upon his cock, a mean fifteen or more inches of hot flesh.  He gives in to the beast, loosening to the fucking, though he can no longer tell if it's him or his beast doing so.  His hands pull up along his cock, tugging the thick skin of his shaft repeatedly over the heavy dripping head at its tip.  His horns begin to dig into the wood floor.  His nostrils flare breathing in the sexual musks.  The creature behind him increases pace.  His body urges him to match.  Brandon's feral groans ring into Rick's twitching bovine ears.  Rick's cock reaches against the floor, his head sliding in the pool of his own excitement.  Brandon fucks furiously into Rick.  Rick stretches and tenses his upper body, feeling his muscles flex all the way down into his burning loins.  His balls pucker up beside the monstrous shaft, burning outwards from his groin.  His voice shrills upwards, calling a long baying need.  He bursts out across the floor intensely, long ribbons spraying, puddling a foot or more away from the source.  Brandon continues to fuck into Rick's hole, while Rick begins to tighten down around him.  Brandon clamps his hands around Rick's waist and buries his phallus deep inside Rick's tight confines.  His seed spills into his stepfather, and the creature subsides, collapsing its weight forward upon its increasingly human partner.<br />
<br />
Rick feels Brandon's resting face, along his back, flatten.  He whispers back, the strength hardly there to speak.  “Brandon?”<br />
<br />
Brandon's voice slurs back, “what?”<br />
<br />
“Pull out.”  Brandon's body chuckles lightly.  The weight on Rick's back pulls up, and he feels his son pull free.  Rick sighs and turns his head, watching his stepson sit up on his knees, a cringe wrinkling up his nose.  “What?”  Rick asks flatly, his cords seeming stuck monotone from stupor.<br />
<br />
“Um...”  Brandon fidgets, “I can see... stuff dripping out.”  <br />
<br />
Rick laughs.  He rolls onto his back.  Brandon flinches.  Rick's cups off a handful of seed from his goo coated chest.  “I landed in my own.”  <br />
<br />
Brandon smiles freely for the first time since he woke.  His smile turns thoughtful, “You took...” His expression twitches, “one for me.”<br />
<br />
Rick sits up, continuing to pull more of his own ejaculate off.  “Yeah...”  He paused, not sure how to proceed.<br />
<br />
Brandon pulled a towel out from under a pile of old clothing.  He tosses it to Rick.  He nods and works out a, “thanks,” just under his breath.  <br />
<br />
As Rick dries himself, he mull over the incident.  “Brandon?”<br />
<br />
Brandon's head perks, his attention focused.  “yes?”<br />
<br />
“It's obvious we're not... “  He pauses for the words, “side effect free.”  Brandon nods, a hint of embarrassment surfacing.  Rick continues, “It could go away in a day or so, whatever that chemical was should get flushed out of our system by then, but, I think it's fairly obvious, we should probably call you in sick for school this week until it's gone.”<br />
<br />
Brandon smiles, his voice mock whining, “but I had a test in senior history Thursday.”<br />
<br />
Rick smirks.  “Oh darn, and you've been studying so hard for it, too”<br />
<br />
Rick stands up slowly, making several extended moans as his body aches from exertion.  Brandon crawls up onto his bed.  They look across at one another for a moment.  Rick nods and turns to leave the door.<br />
<br />
“Rick?”  Brandon asks.<br />
<br />
Rick stops at the threshold of the room.  “What?”<br />
<br />
“Why were you a bull?”<br />
<br />
Rick stood there thoughtfully for several long seconds.  “I don't know.  Only thing I can figure is that I grew up with cows, a dairy farm.”<br />
<br />
Brandon nods.  “And I've lived with...”<br />
<br />
Rick synchronizes his nod.  “with dogs and cats.  Some sort of exposure thing.  It seems the most likely explanation.”<br />
<br />
Brandon's nod gets larger for two bobs then stops.  “Makes sense.”  He looks down at Rick's bare rear, a moment of unease sneaking back into his face.  “Perhaps you should leave before things...”<br />
<br />
Rick groans and starts down the hall.  He calls back, “I don't know about you, but I doubt I'll get another erection for as long as I live.  I'm tired like a dog fleeing the catchers.”<br />
<br />
Brandon looks down between his legs.  He pulls on his changed cock, an impressive five inches flaccid.  He slaps it against his thigh curiously.  It doesn't stir.  He smiles and nods.  “Thank God.”</p>
