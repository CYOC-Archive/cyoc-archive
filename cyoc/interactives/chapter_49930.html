<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Isabelle, Hope, Grace, and Zylphia nervously followed Jensen and Kaylee while flanked by Fran and Darla and kept moving by Alexandra and Pearl bringing up the rear of the group. All of them wanted to bombard Jensen with questions, but for the moment the four of them were too frightened to say anything, not to mention jealous of Kaylee, Fran, and Darla's attributes. As they walked, they noticed that the doors had been removed from the doorways, and their frames enlarged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen must have hit her... his... her... head,&quot; Hope commented looking at he altered doorways.<br />
<br />
The other three nodded nervously. They weren't quite sure how to address Jensen, as they knew him only as Jennifer. And Jensen was no longer Jennifer, although there were plenty of things the four girls could likely easily see in Jensen that was similar to Jennifer. Their only concern was to figure out what possessed Jennifer to become Jensen.<br />
<br />
They were eventually lead to a large bedroom with an absolutely massive bed that looked like it could support the weight of all the wolves around them and then some. The other thing they noticed was that the room reeked of sex. They could smell it, and that was saying something, since all four were still only human. They could also hear the sounds of the renovations of the mansion recommencing elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Jensen turned calmly and took Kaylee's arm while Fran and Darla took flanking positions beside their alphas.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, I'm sure you guys have questions,&quot; Jensen spoke slowly and left it open ended for his friends to began asking their questions.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did this happen to you?&quot; Hope finally asked after a moment or two.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know the game transform or dare?&quot; Jensen asked back.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's real?&quot; Zylphia asked, &quot;it really works?&quot; She waited for all of the wolves to nod, &quot;I knew it! So who did this to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you remember Kyle Perkins?&quot; Jensen questioned.<br />
<br />
Jensen felt Kaylee clutch his arm when all four of them giggled, obviously remembering and remembering the incident fondly.<br />
<br />
&quot;The geeky guy who could only attract a cat-girl?&quot; Grace almost laughed, &quot;How you got his underwear is still a mystery to me, but it was funny to see it flying from the flagpole.&quot;<br />
<br />
The other four soon nodded in agreement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Jensen smiled, wondering how his friends would respond to the knowledge that Kyle was now Kaylee, &quot;it turns out he had a turn in the game and brought me into it yesterday morning...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That little jerk!&quot; Isabelle growled, losing her fear for the moment, &quot;if I ever see him, I'll tear out his throat!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Here I am,&quot; Kaylee growled in a threatening manner.<br />
<br />
All four of them gasped at that and were speechless for several moments. Kaylee then went along with the plan they had hammered out while they waited for the four to arrive.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had Jennifer become the next character she read about in a book,&quot; Kaylee explained, the threatening tone on her voice still present.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which turned out to be the Big Bad Wolf,&quot; Jensen finished as he held out his arms in a dramatic &quot;ta-da&quot; pose, &quot;Improving me greatly from the form of Jennifer Smith. I am strong and powerful... far beyond the high school jocks we used to tempt...&quot;<br />
<br />
The four of them looked over Jensen's fur covered body. They were all still speechless, but Grace did sort of think Jensen looked rather sexy. But, she wasn't about to really admit that because the male werewolf before them, they knew as a girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;And maybe out of spite or revenge, or to reward Kyle for making me so powerful, I returned the favor and made him Kaylee,&quot; Jensen spoke, &quot;Little Red Riding Wolf. My mate and Alpha Female...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You actually had sex with the dork?&quot; Isabelle gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, he had sex with ME, twice,&quot; Kaylee answered, &quot;Kyle was a dork, but I am also greatly improved... and bigger then any of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The four looked rather nervous as the reddish-brown she-wolf had caught them looking at her breasts. They then looked down toward their own. Grace wasn't smaller then Kaylee by much, but the rest were at least a full cup size smaller.<br />
<br />
&quot;And it's from there that we began assembling the Big Bad Wolf Pack,&quot; Jensen smiled, &quot;mostly made up of females, all of whom completely devoted to me and love me with every fiber of their beings. We have a few subordinate males, and while they do not love me... which I don't want... they will still do ANYTHING I, or Kaylee, tells them to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It really is you...&quot; said Grace as the four of them found themselves slightly attracted to the power that Jensen claimed to wield. They didn't really like Kaylee, but to them, anyone who followed and adored their leader they considered smarter then others... so they each thought that they could place Kaylee somewhere as a &quot;hanger on&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it you want to bring us into the pack now?&quot; Hope asked nervously.<br />
<br />
Jensen smiled and then nodded, as his group of friends seemed to continue to cling to their high school &quot;click&quot; mentality and therefore attachment to their leader. He believed that they would all say &quot;transform&quot; just to follow their &quot;leader&quot;, soon to be master.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, who's to ask us the question?&quot; Zylphia asked as she looked at the other she-wolves.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I want to be as big as the blonds,&quot; Isabella added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pearl and I have our turns,&quot; Alexandra spoke, &quot;but I'm afraid that the transformation is not up to you. The details of what you will become have been determined by the master.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You've been planning for this?&quot; Hope asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think I would my friends miss out on being the biggest baddest thing in Glendale?&quot; Jensen questioned, hoping they bought that and believed their human &quot;friendship&quot; would translate into instant status...<br />
<br />
Status which they wouldn't get. The females would be Kaylee's equals physically, but they would find that their &quot;click&quot; leader was now the she-wolf whose underwear had once flown from a school flagpole.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Hope and Grace both said after a few moments, &quot;Go ahead and ask...&quot;<br />
<br />
Isabella and Zylphia soon nodded in agreement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well,&quot; Alexandra spoke as Pearl came around the four, holding several straws, &quot;transform or dare to the four of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Transform.&quot; &quot;Transform.&quot; &quot;Transform.&quot; &quot;Transform,&quot; the four said in unison.<br />
<br />
Alexandra then began to name the transformation, &quot;You shall all become members of the Big Bad Wolf Pack, but first you must draw the straws Pearl holds. If you do not draw straws, you will all become glass statues of naked Japanese woman and know one will have any memory of your ever existing...&quot;<br />
<br />
The four blinked, but didn't reach for the straws yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;... Whoever draws the shortest straw will become a male big bad wolf who will be impressively built, but will not surpass the Master in all things. He will have charcoal black/gray fur and golden eyes and will be eager to please those females that the master is to busy to mate with or shows no interest in,&quot; Alexandra continued, &quot;the rest will become she-wolves whose frames and build will equal the Alpha female's. One will have fur the color of milk chocolate and another the color of dark chocolate. The last will fur that resembles that of a normal wolf with browns, grays, whites, and blacks mixed together. All of you will love and be loyal the Master, Jensen and will respect Alpha Female Kaylee as your best friend and &quot;click leader&quot;... whatever she does, you will follow. And all those who knew you will not remember you unless you directly contact them, and you will not use your turns without meeting the the Master's approval and instructions regarding to your turn.&quot;<br />
<br />
All four of them nervously looked at each other for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;One of us is to become male?&quot; Isabelle asked in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;It isn't so bad,&quot; Jensen smiled, &quot;I've been enjoying it... unless you'd rather be a statue...&quot;<br />
<br />
The four then nervously glanced at each other and then turned to the straws Pearl held before them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do we need to be naked first?&quot; Zylphia asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not if you don't want to,&quot; Kaylee spoke calmly, &quot;although, your bodies will shred your clothing when they take on wolf-form... so you'll be naked in the end, anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Might as well,&quot; Grace spoke and began shedding her clothing. The other four followed shortly, and soon all four of them were standing naked before a group of naked wolf-people.<br />
<br />
They then reached for the straws that Pearl held in her paw. Grace pulled out one that was four inches long. Hope pulled out one that was three and a half inches long. Isabelle pulled one that was three inches long. Zylphia found herself looking at two inch straw.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to the pack, girls, Zack,&quot; Jensen smiled from his position.<br />
<br />
Zylphia felt strange the instant she saw that her straw as the shortest as her body began to immediately change. She expected see wolf claws sprout from her fingers, but watched as her hands and wrists began to lose their feminine daintiness. And that is what frightened her a bit. She was okay with becoming a wolf to a certain extent, but becoming male wasn't her preference. She began to feel some discomfort as her shoulders started to widen, taking a more masculine form.<br />
<br />
&quot;My God it's happening!&quot; Zylphia spoke, hearing her voice beginning to drop into a deeper register.<br />
<br />
She looked down to see her breasts rapidly shrinking into well muscled pectoral muscles. Powerful looking, but still well smaller then Jensen's. But then, she wasn't done changing. She then felt a strange pressure build up inside her and pushing out toward the area between her legs. She got the feeling what that would soon be. Felling and urge to push, she looked further down to see her clitoris beginning to lengthen and thicken. The texture of her skin down there was also beginning to change.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's growing!&quot; Grace said from beside her looking down at Zylphia's enlarging clit.<br />
<br />
Zylphia looked at her friends. Dark brown fur was beginning to grow on Grace's shoulders while Hope had grown claws and was beginning grow taller, and Isabelle's breasts were swelling larger with each breath she took. All of them were moving on their way to wolf-hood.<br />
<br />
Zylphia then felt the pressure between her legs increase as she felt organs shift and move inside her. She hadn't yet produced any signs of the wolf transformation, but she was very nearly a he... &quot;just like Jen is a &quot;he&quot; now...&quot; she thought. Then in a brief flash of pain, like getting a shot from a doctor, they emerged from within her... two testicles, and her clitoris had now completed its change into a penis, and was swelling larger and more erect with each moment. For the moment it made her nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have nothing to worry about, Zack,&quot; Jensen spoke, &quot;the Pack's females will love you... or at least they will love your ability to satisfy them...&quot;<br />
<br />
Zylphia looked on nervously as his present erection continued to grow larger. And then she felt her skin begin to itch. Absentmindedly he began to scratch at his shoulder. What he felt was growing fur, which was thickening across his shoulders and upper arms. It was a blackish color, but it was not the same shade that Jensen was. It was more like someone had mixed gray and black paint together. He was growing charcoal black fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can do it, Zack!&quot; came a voice from behind him.<br />
<br />
Zylphia turned to see that his friends had completed their transformations, even as his own claws began to grow. All of them resembled themselves in a wolfish sort of way, but with obvious changes. Their musculature now matched Kaylee's, as did their bust and hip measurements. Their tails wagged happily behind them. Zylphia meanwhile, felt himself beginning to rise up onto the balls of his feet, as his charcoal black fur now covered everything, with the exception of his erect member which was easily visible as his sheath was retracted to make it visible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Strange,&quot; Zylphia though as his transformation continued, he thought he could smell  the scent of arousal in the room. He glanced around to see that there was sexual arousal among the wolves present. He could see the nipples on each she-wolf poking out through their fur, and Jensen's own member was beginning to emerge from its sheath.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's happening,&quot; Zylphia thought for a moment before cringing as sharp pains ran through his head. He heard a strange cracking sound and when he looked out, he saw a charcoal black muzzle pushing out from his face. The pain and discomfort was now shifting to his spine, as he knew the last thing he needed to do was grow his tail, and it burst forth in another short flash of pain, leaving Zylphia a highly aroused male werewolf.<br />
<br />
&quot;How are you feeling, Zack?&quot; Jensen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very horny,&quot; Zack answered, not challenging Jensen's giving him a new name, and not noticing the mental change, &quot;I need to mate... bad&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry,&quot; Jensen spoke, &quot;it'll go down in a little while... if not... I'm sure there are at least two here would gladly help you out with your &quot;problem&quot;.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack then looked to see Alexandra and Pearl approaching him The smell of their arousal only served to send more blood to his erect member. He glanced over to see Grace, Hope, and Isabelle beginning to gossip about something with Kaylee and playing their alpha's hair. He could smell the arousal in all of the other females in the room as well. As Alexandra and Pearl came closer to him, it was clear that they wanted him at that moment... and he wasn't in the mood to disappoint.</p>
