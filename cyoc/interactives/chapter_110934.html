<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">One of the options really surprised Jeff.  The heavily masculine face of a black man stared at him from one of the squares.  And when he hovered over the image to get a look at him.. holy crap.  Elias was big, this guy was bigger.  He was all muscle and brawn, with a heavy cock to match.  He wondered in what world his grandmother would have ended up with this man, William Davis.  He almost laughed seeing the surname the same as his old one, and took it as a sign.  One click and the picture of his mother and his siblings all highlighted.<br />
<br />
This time he didn&#39;t hesitate before he activated the program that would update his body once again.  He was eager to see how the blood from this new grandfather would mix with that of his father.  He felt the now familiar tingle under his skin and wasted no time in tearing his shirt off his torso.  The hair on his body wasn&#39;t getting any thicker, that wasn&#39;t something William seemed to have so that still all came from Elias, but it was getting a bit curlier, not a tight curl, just a gentle looping to the hair.  He looked towards the mirror on his wall and noticed the same thing was happening to the hair on his head, waves turning into full curls.<br />
<br />
His skin was darkening, the Mediterranean olive taking on more of a bronze tone, as if he was sporting the world&#39;s best tan.  He guessed having a quarter of his blood being African wasn&#39;t enough to make him completely dark, at least not how he inherited it, but it did darken him.  As the color change reached his nipples they became a darker brown, even increasing in size a bit.  He couldn&#39;t resist reaching up to tweak one, sending a shiver down his spine and into his cock.<br />
<br />
How had he forgotten about that, he quickly undid his fly and peeled back the fabric just in time to see the thick length of his shaft turning the same dark brown as his nipples.  He shimmied out of his pants and let them drop around his ankles, taking that throbbing length into his hands.  No, not throbbing.  Growing.  Elias&#39; genes may have made him big, but William&#39;s were making him hung.  His fingers curled around his shaft were being forced apart as his manhood thickened and lengthened, veins standing out in sharp contrast under the brown skin.  Even stranger, extra skin was creeping up towards the head, was he becoming uncircumcised?  A few experimental strokes and he let out a soft moan at the feeling of his renewed foreskin sliding up and down his cock.  Even his balls seemed larger, heavier, and fuller, filling up his deep brown scrotum with their new heft.<br />
<br />
So absorbed was he in playing with himself he didn&#39;t even feel the slight tingling in his face as some of his features began to change.  His nose widened slightly, nostrils flaring even as his lips plumped up.  Though his eyes remained the same bright blue.  He still mostly resembled his father, but anyone looking closely wouldn&#39;t miss his now mixed heritage.<br />
<br />
But it wasn&#39;t enough to distract him from the heat now passing through his muscles and bones.  His frame was stretching again.  It seemed William&#39;s genes were strong enough to override or even enhance those of Elias.  Two prime male specimens in his tree was just amping up everything about him.  His limbs stretched out as his torso extended, adding a couple more inches to his height, bringing him to an impressive 6&#39;3&quot;.  His shoulders widened as his hands and feet grew larger.  And the muscles, his arms, his legs, his chest, everything added on a couple of inches, especially his chest, and those pert sensitive dark nipples of his.<br />
<br />
Sixteen and his was already as big as his father, who wasn&#39;t a small man by any means.  It&#39;d take a bit for anyone to realize he wasn&#39;t a fully grown man.  He was huge, and he was jacked.  Part of his mind wondered what he&#39;d look like when done with puberty, but for the most part he was busy stroking his cock with one hand and pinching one of his nipples with the other.  With a deep moan he came, just as he heard someone coming up the stairs..</p>
