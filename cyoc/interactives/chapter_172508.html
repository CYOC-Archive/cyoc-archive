<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Malcolm was an average boy on his way from school. At 15, he was 5’8” tall, pale, skinny, with messy brown hair, and weighing about 130 pounds. He was wearing a baggy black shirt and khaki shorts, and he was tired from a long day of school.<br />
<br />
As he passed the museum, he saw a commotion on the front steps. It looked like two men were struggling. Something dropped to the ground and emitted a purple ray of light, which flashed all the way across the street, hitting Malcolm.<br />
<br />
He suddenly fell to the ground, groaning as his whole body cramped. He writhed on the ground while people around him started to stare at his changes.<br />
<br />
The officer, having finished apprehending the thief, saw the kid on the ground and rushed over, cursing under his breath that someone had been caught in the crossfire. He reached Malcolm and yelled, “Kid, do you need help?”<br />
<br />
“No! Please help!” Malcolm yelled in pain as he kept writhing in the ground.<br />
<br />
“Someone call an ambulance!” The officer shouted to the crowd around him and Malcolm. A woman who wasn&#39;t recording with her phone called an ambulance while another one who was a nurse tried to calm Malcolm down.<br />
<br />
“It hurts!” Malcolm yelled as he felt light headed. The nurse noticed that Malcolm&#39;s body began to vibrate all over.<br />
<br />
“Uh? What’s happening?” The officer asked confused as he kneeled in front of Malcolm. “What was on that thing? His reaction doesn&#39;t look normal.” He looked at the device that the thief tried to steal. Then he looked back at Malcolm who was tightly holding his hands. The officer noticed that Malcolm&#39;s hands were expanding larger. His fingers were stretching out and his palms became very wide and masculine looking.<br />
<br />
“What the fu-UUH!!” The officer shouted but he suddenly stopped when he noticed that Malcolm began to grow in height. He was startled watching the boy&#39;s body lengthening and becoming taller. Malcolm grew from 5’8” to 5’11” instantly.<br />
<br />
“Oh my god!!” The nurse shouted as she looked at Malcolm&#39;s body. His clothes started to get very tight and she can feel he was getting extremely hot all over. “He has fever!! Hurry! I need a fold compress!!”<br />
<br />
Malcolm can&#39;t stop groaning and writhing but he can feel his scrawny figure starting to develop rapidly. He felt his muscles expanding within his stretching clothes. His arms were growing larger. His sleeves popped open revealing nice biceps. Then, his shoes felt tighter.<br />
<br />
“Is he growing?!” The officer shouted as he looked down at Malcolm&#39;s shoes and noticed them beginning to stretch rapidly. Suddenly Malcolm&#39;s toes began to burst out one by one leaving half of his feet completely exposed. The people were agape watching as Malcolm wiggled his now thick toes freely from his now undersized shoes. Just then his foot expanded rapidly, ripping through what was left of his shoes. He was now standing barefoot and still growing.<br />
<br />
Malcolm rapidly stretched from 5’11” to 6’2” now. His pants were starting to barely cover the top of his ankles now. Despite the nurse had managed to put a cold compress on his forehead, Malcolm was feeling even more hot now. He felt a weird sensation happening inside his shirt.<br />
<br />
“Uuuugh!! Oooouch! I&#39;m burning!!” Malcolm yelled as his torso suddenly exploded out of his tightening shirt revealing thick pecs, and muscular stomach to match his bulging biceps. The people were in shock as they watched little curly hairs quickly sprouting in Malcolm&#39;s chest. Then, there was a loud rip from behind and everybody noticed that Malcolm&#39;s butt had burst from the back of his pants as well.<br />
<br />
“The paramedics!” The nurse shouted as she watched two men coming out from an ambulance.<br />
<br />
“Move!! Give them some space to work!” The officer said while Malcolm’s thighs were bursting out of his pants because of his newly grown muscular legs. The paramedics tried to move Malcolm inside the ambulance but he was getting so big that they needed the officer&#39;s help to do it.<br />
<br />
“What happened to him?” The paramedics asked but the officer didn&#39;t know how to explain what he saw. Meanwhile, Malcolm&#39;s face was already changing.<br />
<br />
“AaAAhHhh!” It was a painful sensation as Malcolm’s face matured through 20 years in less than 10 seconds. His face started to feel extremely itchy from all of the facial hair that was sprouting across his face. Then, the officer suddenly blushed ashamed when he noticed that Malcolm was clenching his underwear with his now large hands.<br />
<br />
“Um... Kid, don&#39;t do that in public!” The officer told Malcolm who was practically moaning as his boyhood matured into a fully grown manhood.<br />
<br />
“He can&#39;t hear you.” The nurse replied. “Quick! Close the ambulance. We need to give him some privacy!” The officer came in next to Malcolm while the paramedics closed the ambulance doors. However, some curious people were still trying to look through the small ambulance windows.<br />
<br />
Despite of the audience, Malcolm couldn’t help but rub his thickening balls and lengthening cock inside of his shrinking underwear. “Ooooooo” He moaned. 20 years of sexual build up starting to catch up to him now. His face was so red now. “Uuuugh!! It feels sooo~ UGH!” Malcolm moaned in a now very deep voice.<br />
<br />
The officer realized that he needed to help the boy&#39;s sexual frustration somehow. So, he ripped off what was left of Malcolm&#39;s underwear and when his huge dick was totally free Malcolm started to stroke it faster and faster. The officer just stepped back as he watched the disgusting and fascinating scene in front of him.<br />
<br />
“oh…OOOooO…UUUH!!!” Malcolm wasn’t prepared with how intense this was going to become. He stroked faster and faster until he finally came all over his huge new self. Just then, He passed out. Now, a 35 year old muscular hairy hunk laid where a scrawny 15 year old boy once stood just 5 minutes ago.<br />
<br />
“Oh, shit. Poor kid.” The officer said as he watched the cum covered man in front of him. “This is going to break the news...”</p>
