<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tyra Wrex, formally Effie Wilcox, had recently been given a wake-up call. Ever since her conversation and rejuvenation, she had been openly embracing her rekindled sexuality and new lease on life. She had teased Heather about it good nature, but she didn&#39;t want her to be really uncomfortable. It was when Irena told her that Heather was feeling more distant with her that Trya realized that she might have been going too far. She supposed if her own grandmother was acting like she had, that would drive Tyra away too. Though the concept was hard to picture. Still, it seemed like it was time to really reconnect with Heather.<br />
<br />
So a few days after Irena&#39;s birthday, Tyra went to Heather&#39;s room and knocked on the door. &quot;Come in,&quot; called Heather.<br />
<br />
Tyra walked in to see Heather working on more posters. It made Tyra feel proud to see that Heather was regaining most of her old art skills. Heather had told her grandmother that she was afraid she wouldn&#39;t be able to pain with her claws, but it seems like the practice was paying off. &quot;You&#39;re almost as good as you used to be,&quot; said Tyra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Almost,&quot; agreed Heather, &quot;Those coloring books really helped me relearn my grip.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So...I was wondering if ya&#39;ll wanted to do something together. Just the two of us,&quot; said Tyra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tyra, I&#39;m not going on the stage with you,&quot; said Heather flatly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing like that, I promise,&quot; said Tyra, &quot;Just some normal stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather turned to look at her grandmother. &quot;Like what?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Er...what is you girls do these days?&quot; asked Effie.<br />
<br />
&quot;You really don&#39;t know?&quot; asked Heather flatly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Things were a lot different back in my time,&quot; said Tyra, &quot;We didn&#39;t have your fancy phones and cars and whatever social ya&#39;ll have now. But since I&#39;m young again, I oughta learn more about the new generation and stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, considering you&#39;d be butchering modern lingo and making a hopeless fool out of yourself, I suppose it&#39;s my duty to educate you on the 21st century,&quot; said Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok then. Where do we start?&quot; asked Tyra.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
The next few days were more fun than either Tyra or Heather would have expected. Tyra was adjusting better to the ways of the current generation than Heather would have expected. It may have because of Tyra&#39;s youthful energy, but then Heather was trying to go with the most basic and easy to understand things. For instance, hanging out at the mall. Ironically, Lyre didn&#39;t really have a mall. There were a few strip malls, but not a full-sized one. But with so many Animalians and people now, Lyre Mall was constructed. It didn&#39;t receive as much attention from Animalia-focused events as the store in the mall were mainly meant for humans. The clothing stores at least, the other stores were more unilateral. But Tyra and Heather were able to check out the jewelry and bath supplies stores without much hassle. The electronics store was visited more for Tyra&#39;s education than shopping as the newer Animalian-geared models were still be created.<br />
<br />
There were various other things, such as working out at the gym or enjoying smoothies together. As Tyra promised, she didn&#39;t drag Heather to the Meat Market or act too promiscuous around her. But that didn&#39;t mean she was acting like she was when she was an old woman. While Tyra didn&#39;t want to lose her connection with her granddaughter, that didn&#39;t mean she wanted to act like a grandma around her. The point of these activities weren&#39;t just to rebuild their relationship, but also to ease Heather into thinking of Tyra less as old Effie and more like someone that she could have a peer relationship with. Someone who was more like an older sister or an aunt than an old grandmother. And Heather seemed to be more at ease now.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
After a couple of weeks of this, the two <i>Syntixisaurus rex</i> Animalians decided to treat themselves at the Cavern Spa. The mud facials seemed a bit superficial considering their scaly skins, but it did feel relaxing. They definitely need the manicure/pedicure treatment as their claws needed filing. And the massages took a bit longer as there was a lot of surface area to cover, but it did loosen up some kinks that they weren&#39;t aware they had. After that was a relaxing dip in one of the hot springs. By now, Heather was used to the relaxed nudity standards of Animalia and it didn&#39;t really bother her to see her grandmother naked now.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, you&#39;ve really come a long way since you&#39;ve started,&quot; said Tyra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I guess I have,&quot; said Heather as she flexed her arm. She had lost a lot of flab since she had started that Alpha Prime Weight Management Class. She was rather pleased with the muscles that were forming. Of course, part of that wasn&#39;t just because of the exercise, but from the second dose she had gotten from Jeremy. However, it was much more gradual than other Animalians&#39; second doses. But she had been noticeably growing taller, almost reaching Tyra&#39;s height and her breasts had been increasing in size as well. The scientists theorized that it was because Heather&#39;s first dose was unrefined compared to the Dinotopian serums made since. Effie&#39;s had been more instant by virtue of getting two doses at once.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not just your body, I meant your personality,&quot; said Tyra, &quot;You&#39;re pretty different from the egomaniac you once were.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t have called me an egomaniac,&quot; said Heather, &quot;But I was pretty messed up. I was really selfish and was lashing out at people for bad reasons.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you&#39;ve really come around since then,&quot; said Tyra.<br />
<br />
Heather snorted and said dryly, &#39;Tell that to my parole officer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I intend to,&quot; said Tyra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pardon?&quot; asked Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps you&#39;ve forgotten that your probation review is coming up,&quot; said Tyra.<br />
<br />
&quot;It might have slipped my mind,&quot; admitted Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I think you have a very good chance of getting your sentence lifted,&quot; said Tyra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Am I supposed to be practicing?&quot; asked Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would try to be sincere,&quot; said Tyra, &quot;Show them you really have turned over a new leaf. But you should watch out for trick questions or being led into making a bad answer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At least I can count on you to be there for me,&quot; said Heather.<br />
<br />
Tyra put a hand on Heather&#39;s shoulder and said, &quot;I&#39;ll always be there for you. Always.&quot;</p>
