<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After &quot;eating&quot; a few more fish, she moved until she no longer felt the paralysis, and then emerged from the water completely. The last bit of water drained from her pussy, and the gills hid entirely under a few new layers of skin sliding on top of it.<br />
She had a hypothesis; her pussy was changing based on what she eats. Granted, this was based on a smaller sample size than she&#39;d like, but even now she felt her vagina muscles tense and quiver much more strongly than before, not unlike the muscles of a salmon.<br />
The more fish she &quot;ate&quot;, the better she felt her gill working, her vaginal opening wider, like a fish&#39;s mouth, and the more she felt the depths of her pussy &quot;adapt&quot; to the water environment. What was once just an underwater vagina, quickly turned into a perfect fish lure, as at one point, multiple fish were trying to cram together.<br />
However, what really sold her hypothesis was when she &quot;ate&quot; some aqualife she knew had venomous properties. Her abdomen seemed to churn for much longer with that, making her worried wether she had just poisoned herself.<br />
But no, after a moment, it subsided, but her instincts didn&#39;t yet open her &quot;mouth&quot; for a long time.<br />
After that time, it opened, and she could feel her tentacles laying in wait further in.<br />
With the first fish, her suspicion was confirmed. Because, instead of multiple tentacles wrestling it to death, only one tentacle reached out to sting it, and after a few moments of the fish frantically trying to swim away inside of her pussy (which she moaned at), the fish was dead, and it was pulled deeper, while her pussy open again. Efficient.<br />
Her pussy was changing depending on what food she ate, even optimising the process.<br />
She also thought that, now, her pussy was capable of digesting things that her regular human stomach couldn&#39;t. She wasn&#39;t entirely sure what the churning exactly <I>was</I>, but she also noted that her abdomen took more time to &quot;digest&quot; new kinds of food. Maybe it was optimising internal acids too?<br />
So then she began hiking through the woods, with no pants or panties to speak of. Those now felt too restrictive to her, somehow, like putting on multiple masks, even though she didn&#39;t have to breathe down there.<br />
Michelle felt some insects annoy her, and after swatting away another one, she got an idea, and stopped to sit against a tree, and opened her legs.<br />
The bugs landed on the outstretched, wet, and warm tentacles, and before they could react, they were pulled inside.<br />
A small snack, but a considerable one nonetheless, she could feel her abdomen churning and churning, until...<br />
Nothing.<br />
Confused, she let herself catch more insects, and then even some other things from the forest floor, such as a pineapple, some leaves, and some twigs.<br />
While the bugs still caused her abdomen to churn, the forest-food didn&#39;t, so she stopped doing that, and focused on bugs.<br />
Finally, she felt something &quot;click&quot; inside of her, and she felt an urge to lie down a sleep for a while. She obliged, letting the exhaustion wash over her, just as her crotch area felt like burning up.<br />
She awoke a moment later, in the late evening, with a setting sun. She looked down at her pussy, feeling a strange mix of anxiety and anticipation at her latest change.<br />
Her pussy lips looked... blackened, losing the red lustre. In fact, looking deeper, her entire tunnel seemed to have darkened, sucking up almost all light.<br />
And that&#39;s exactly what it did.<br />
She grabbed her head, as her awakening consciousness seems have caught hold of... <I>something</I>. A new sensory connection, and when she let it through, her head overloaded from the senses.<br />
Light, light nearly everywhere, in all corners, from all sides. She rose her torso back up again, and the light seemed to get brighter, with more reddish-yellow light peering in.<br />
With a small spark of horror and insight, she closed her legs, and the light disappeared, plunging her in blackness yet again.<br />
Though... not entirely, she could see the faint light bouncing off some skin, and after some period of adjusting, she could see... red, a lot of it, but not everywhere, inside?<br />
She moved one of her tentacles, and the red shifted around her vision. She choked on nothing as she realised what was going on, and what her vagina now had.<br />
Vision. Insects have compound eyes, in all directions, with fragments of light hitting it everywhere, creating 360 degree vision from one spot.<br />
Except... she didn&#39;t have 360 degree vision , she just felt like there was a lot of light. Her head hurt again, and the picture seemed to defragment a little as she moved around her tentacles. She could feel connections forming, simplifying, filtering, until she was looking at a fairly-fragmented but almost-cohesive image of her vaginal insides, from all sides. She was seeing her own carnal insides from the vaginal walls.<br />
Like this, she could definitely see the changes she brought to herself, her tentacles were rooted along a ring muscles in the... &quot;back wall&quot;? Running along the tunnel&#39;s length. She could see strong muscles quivering in the folds, evidencing the effect those salmons had on her. She could see small holes for saliva glands, which she wasn&#39;t sure she&#39;d need for, until she realised these might be pheromone glands, helping to... entice prey, into her.<br />
The more she &quot;looked&quot;, the more she &quot;saw&quot;, as the fragmented picture completed itself, with only a few inconsistencies, seeing her insides with all of its detail.<br />
Sitting against the tree, staring into the reddening sun, she processed this, and ultimately decided she was in no position to process this right now, her mind being already overwhelmed from the last few days. She opted to make sense of it later, but right now, just accept for what it is.<br />
Yet still, she was curious.<br />
She opened her legs again, and almost gasped at the remainder of the light. Ah, right, that too.<br />
She could see red from down there, and as she stared forward into the sunset, blinking against the light somewhat, she realised that her crotch area was seeing the same. She looked down again, seeing the blackness of the lips as the same material that composed those insect eyes.<br />
But if her lips were black, then maybe...<br />
She leaned forward, and actually used a finger to pull back the hood that covered her clitoris, until-<br />
&quot;Arghhh, fuck!&quot;<br />
-she saw that it, too, was blackened, but looked a lot more like the composite eye she knew from insects, but a <I>lot</I> more of them. She recoiled at the light that it received, gritting her teeth as it drove a small throb of pain in her skull.<br />
But still, she held up the clitoral hood, and forced her new clit-vision to absorb the light, to <I>see</I>.<br />
It took a moment, but then, it was like she was seeing double, with one perspective a lot lower. She noted it had no distance recognition, and a lot of leafs and plants were obscuring her secondary vision, compared to her primary one.<br />
Michelle let her clitoral hood go, and it fell, covering her &quot;eye&quot; again. She felt annoyed at this fact, wondering if she&#39;d have to hold it up somehow, and her &quot;abdomen&quot; seemed to agree, beginning to churn again.<br />
Michelle felt her breath stop as she realised what was about to happen, and while half-expecting the tiredness to return, it didn&#39;t.<br />
Instead, she felt warmer, warmer than ever before, all centred on her clit, her hood, feeling as if dozens of nerve endings were killed off and recreated, causing her sensory systems to go haywire. If this is what had been happening to her crotch this entire time, she was now suddenly glad she wasn&#39;t awake for it.<br />
She felt the skin of her abdomen move, together with a sensation like her nose twitching, but only down there. She felt skin merging with muscle, as more and more twitches and pain and senses and touches and hurt and burning and pain and-<br />
She blinked.<br />
Not with her normal eyes, as those had an uninterrupted sight of the moon, which was beautiful. She woke up in the middle of the night from her fugue, seeing both the forest and the moon simultaneously.<br />
She saw her view of the forest worsen, some moisture accumulating on her eye, deforming the light, and she blinked again.<br />
Michelle heaved her torso up, wanting to inspect her latest changes. She noted a slight change in the musculature of her abdomen, and saw a distinct raising of her clitoral hood... by itself.<br />
Together with that, when she &quot;blinked&quot; again, her clitorical hood lowered and raised by itself with immense speed, just like an eyelid. Leaning forward even more, she tried to catch a glimpse of it...<br />
...until she was looking at her own face upside down, scared, confused, and flushed.<br />
Blink.<br />
In a split second, her clitoral hood pushed out all fluids that had accumulated on it, but she saw it started gathering again.<br />
Blink. Blink.<br />
Fuck, that actually felt good.<br />
Blink, Blink, Blink.<br />
It felt like she was softly wiping her clit with her finger, almost, but &quot;hands-free&quot;, and this time, without her tentacles as well.<br />
Blink-blink-blink-blink.<br />
The &quot;blinking&quot; seemed to cause a vicious cycle, as she became more aroused, and the arousal seemed to heighten her wetness further, causing her &quot;clit&quot; to be welled up with more of her moisture, causing her to blink, causing more arousal.<br />
She felt this could become overstimulating soon, and she felt her &quot;eye&quot; &quot;close&quot;, the clitoral hood lowering for a final time, before it pressed itself against the clit, softly tensing a muscle continuously, protecting it.<br />
She rubber her finger over it, the hood still transferred her touch enough to arouse her more. She felt it tensing under her rubbing, trying to &quot;blink&quot; out of reflex, which amused her.<br />
Eventually, she came.<br />
As if her body had not changed enough for her, she felt and saw several of those &quot;saliva&quot; glands in the back of her vaginal began to ejaculate thick sticky fluid, cum, which caused mixed feelings.<br />
After musing about this for a few more minutes, staring at the moon, she heard a soft snap.</p>
