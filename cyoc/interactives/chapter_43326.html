<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Will was slowly coming down from his euphoric high, the feeling of his new body's much more powerful orgasm was too much for his still male mind to take in. He felt fantastic, his senses had still not cleared completely. Will's hands framed his body as he glided his hands over the sides of his still tingling body. He was content with being held in his lovers strong hands firmly against her softening member. Strong hands send chills through his body as they caressed his sensitive smooth thighs. <br />
 <br />
His mind suddenly clearing, Will sat straight up, noticing now that he'd some how lost the flimsy nightie, he covered his perky breasts with one arm, looking down at Megan, she looked at him with a smirk of conquest on her face. &quot;I can't believe you can just treat me like this, trying to blackmail me, then using this body against me to get your own perverse pleasure. I thought you loved me, why are you doing all this?&quot;<br />
 <br />
Megan just smiled up at Will, he looked like he'd had a few romps in the bed, his hair was strewn about wildly. Small beads of sweat could be seen gleaming on his cute naked body. &quot;I do love you, more than you know. But you need to learn a lesson, all those times you treated women like they were just eye candy. You need to know what its like, and maybe that's what this is all about, maybe if you learn your lesson, things will return to normal.&quot; She said basically giving him the gist of her plan. &quot;Now, go get yourself cleaned up, we're going to dinner, tonight's the first night we're going out with our new identities.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Will was about to protest, but Megan raising her hand only reminded him of the pain he'd experienced earlier. Forgetting modesty he jumped out of the bed, he felt his hips roll as he quick walked in the heels, with surprising ease to the bathroom, giving Megan a good look at his shapely shaking ass, the heels making it look all the more feminine. He sighed, locking the door behind him. &quot;What the hell...this is bull shit. I shouldn't be in this mess to begin with.&quot; He said his emotions welling up, he walked over to the shower, turning it on. He looked himself in the mirror, his hips looked wider than before and his boobs were definitely half a cup bigger now. The only thing that reminded him of himself was his face, it was still his at least for now. His Adams apple was still there, but his neck had started to thin and it was smaller now. He didn't know how long that part of him would last. <br />
 <br />
Megan layed back in bed, she felt great and tired, now she knew why guys felt sleepy after sex. But man was it great and she wanted to do it all night, but there were still things to do. Standing, she grabbed the camera off the tripod, checking the images. There was a bunch, all loaded straight to the computer. &quot;He'll never live this one down. As long as he plays nice, he won't have to.&quot; She walked to the spare bathroom and started getting ready herself. As she stepped into the shower, she felt her body, it had become so strong and rock hard, a mountain of muscle and she wasn't even done yet. Her breasts were still there but had definitely shrunk. For all purposes she looked like a man just with slightly softer features, longer hair and a still higher voice. &quot;Not for long.&quot; She thought, soaping herself down. <br />
 <br />
Megan looked down at the main of hair between her legs, she thought about it briefly. &quot;I think it'll look better without all that.&quot; She grabbed the razor and meticulously removed all her pubic hair, when she was done, her magnificent shaft looked even grander than it had before. &quot;Oh he'll love this, wait until I make him kiss it. No more nasty hair to get in the way.&quot; She finished cleaning up and turned the water off, stepping out, she grabbed a towel.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Will washed himself clean of all Megan's cum which had splashed on the small of his back. He knew she'd cum inside of him, the feeling was eerie, he'd never thought he'd be in a situation where he'd be the one getting the business. His eyes shot wide open. &quot;Can I even get pregnant?!&quot; He announced, his voice screeched girlishly, the thought made him sick to his stomach. He continued, trying to keep his mind off of it, his mind had more important things to worry about like what exactly Megan was planning this time. &quot;I knew I was kind of a dick, but I didn't know I was this bad.&quot; He felt down his legs, they were still smooth as a baby's butt, as was the rest of his body. He turned the shower off.<br />
 <br />
Pulling Will straight out of the shower before he had a chance to even open the curtain, Megan patted down a very surprised Will with a beach towel, paying special attention to his more sensitive areas, his nipples, and his sore lips. &quot;Just follow what I say completely, I'll get you all fixed up. Remember, I've got all those pictures to send to your friends, so be a nice young lady.&quot; She smirked as Will his face blushed and his eyes watered slightly, she sat him naked on the toilet, lifting his feet onto the stool. <br />
 <br />
&quot;What do you think? A hot pink? Maybe a dark red? Or a playful purple?&quot; Will's eyes shot her a look of confusion which was quickly replaced by worry as she put toe spreaders between his toes now size seven feet. She quickly filled and clipped the nails on both his feet and hands, cleaning the cuticles, then putting a clear coat on she applied a hot pink to his nails, she looked up at Will, his face was in horror. &quot;You didn't say what you wanted, besides, you'll pass for a sixteen-year-old for tonight anyway, this'll go with your new look.&quot; <br />
 <br />
Will was once again bewildered by what was happening to him. She worked her magic, applying the first coat, then another clear coat, then another coat of the hot pink and one more gloss coat, all while he sat there naked on the cold toilet. He was told not to move or he'd smudge the nail polish, he sat there feet and hands spread as Megan disappeared out of the bathroom. &quot;What am I supposed to do for work? I guess it's easy enough to remove, but this is too much, I can't go in public like a girl, I'll be humiliated. Better that than Gary or Mike getting a hold of those pictures.&quot; He sighed, waiting for Megan to return.<br />
 <br />
Megan stopped at the study and used the chronovac to create some fake I.D.s for them, and a new vehicle registration with her new male persona's name, just in case. She dressed in some black jeans, a black button down shirt and a nice pair of dress shoes, she fixed her hair so it was more manly. She smiled in the mirror, she couldn't believe how much more quick her changes were compared to Will's, but all the better she thought. Grabbing Will's clothes for the evening, her smirk grew. She walked into the bathroom where Will still sat nude his hands out in a very feminine fashion, trying to let the air dry it quickly.<br />
 <br />
Taking off the spreaders, she looked at his cute toes, she playfully grabbed them. &quot;Your toes are so cute now baby.&quot; Megan chuckled, helping Will to his feet. &quot;Should be all dry now, time to get you all dressed.&quot; She grabbed a pair of cotton hot pink panties, she handed them to Will, he immediately pulled them up his shapely legs. &quot;I thought you'd appreciate they're not a thong.&quot; She smirked, handing him a similarly pink bra, it was an A-cup, so his new girth in that area cause him to give and extra large appearing bust.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Megan, my...uh boobs are getting a little too big now, this barely fits.&quot; Will said, hoping she would give him some kind of consideration.<br />
 <br />
&quot;You can wear it or not, but where we're going there's plenty of guys, so if you want to give them a show, by all means don't wear it.&quot; Megan said, her facial expression was that of seriousness. She told him to put his hands over his head, he complied, she pulled a pink and white striped lace blouse over his head, the straps barely covered the ones from his bra. She began to blow dry his hair, making it manageable by running a brush through it as he stood in just his panties. &quot;Do you mind pretending to be a little girl tonight do you? I mean you'll probably only look this way for one more night, I just want to have some fun.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Will sighed, he could tell she was trying to make the best of a bad situation, or at least he wanted to believe that. &quot;No, I mean, we might as well enjoy it...I guess.&quot; He said, half because he feared what Megan would do if he said otherwise, but part of him was interested in pretending to be a girl, see if he could pull it off. Megan pulled his hair into two short pigtails, his hair wasn't all that long yet, she added a . It felt like he drifted off while Megan continued, when he zoned back in, he now had eye shadow on and bubblegum flavored lip gloss had made his lips look ultra kissable, Will smacked his lips a few times. She'd used cover up to make his face look completely like that of a girl. His nipples actually grew stiff at the sight of the gorgeous young girl in the mirror.<br />
 <br />
&quot;You turned out greater than I thought, now lets get you all finished.&quot; Megan said, pulling the skirt up Will's silky smooth legs, pulling it up and over his wider hips she left the white cotton skirt hand just above mid thigh, combined with his shirt it did nothing to hide his tight little belly, or legs. &quot;Just watch how you sit, one false move and you'll be flashing everyone those girlie panties you've got on.&quot; She said, playfully lifting his flowy skirt. Next she put some white Mary Jane slipons with little silver hearts on Will's feet, giving him that perfect schoolage girl look.<br />
 <br />
Turning to face his reflection, Will felt an overwhelming sense of dread at the thought of going out in public like this, especially not knowing where they were headed. He looked perfectly like a sixteen-year-old blonde cutie, his undersized bra giving his boobs extra cleavage in the thin blouse. &quot;So, where we going anyway? It's not like we have I.D.'s or anything?&quot; Will said, crossing his arms over his sizeable chest.<br />
 <br />
Megan handed him a state ID and drivers licence. &quot;We do now, I'm Brian Chandler and you're my little cousin Vikki Chandler.&quot; A look of shock covered Will's face as he studied the ID closely, it had a picture of him as he was now, a the blonde girl he had become. &quot;Vikki Chandler, Blonde hair, blue eyes, 5'6&quot; &quot; He couldn't believed he'd dropped so much height and weight or that this ID seemed extremely accurate. &quot;It says I just turned 16, I can't even drink with this, what's the point, and why make me your cousin? How is this even possible?&quot;<br />
 <br />
A smirking Megan just shrugged. &quot;Dunno, just found them, must be more magic, I guess you'll just have to be my DD tonight. Mine says I'm twenty-five. Come on, we'll have fun, I'll slip you some drinks, besides, you're going whether you want to or not, so just have fun.&quot; She reached under his skirt, grasping his cotton pantied ass. &quot;I'll keep you safe, relax, now come on.&quot; She said grabbing his freshly manicured hand and pulled him all the way out to the car.<br />
 <br />
Will sat in his seat, fidgeting the entire time as they drove and drove until finally reaching a bar just outside of town. &quot;I don't think they even let minors in this bar, I'll just wait out in the car, you have fun.&quot; Will hoped she'd just take the offer and let him keep some of his dignity. Megan opened the car door, walking over to Will's side, she pulled him out. &quot;Behave, or else I'll swat your ass right here in front of everyone.&quot; She chuckled instantly as Will stood straight up. &quot;Ok ok, I was just saying.&quot; He said as they walked up to the bar entrance, his heart was beating out of his chest.<br />
 <br />
Walking through the entrance, they were immediately greeted by a bouncer who asked for their IDs, they both handed them over. &quot;Oh, she's just my DD tonight, see she's my cousin and she has no where else to be, she offered to drive me home later. She'll be good on cokes all night.&quot; The bouncer seemed to consider it for a moment, then placed a green paper around Megan's wrist and a red around Will's. &quot;This lets the bartender know you're the DD, have fun.&quot; He said, smiling with a leer at Will, giving him a funny feeling in his belly.<br />
 <br />
Megan smirked as they walked on past them. &quot;See I told you, nothing to it. Now, go grab that booth over there, I'll grab us a couple drinks.&quot; She said pointing then immediately disappearing into the crowd. The music was beating loudly as Will made his way through the wall of people, he'd catch a guy or two glaring at him extra long, he couldn't believe so many guys would scope him out. &quot;This is unbearable.&quot; He swore he felt a few guys grab his ass as he walked by, he simply huffed angrily and continued. He sat at the booth, sighing as he finally reached his destination, he crawled into the booth, keeping his skirt down from flashing the many spectators.<br />
 <br />
Will sat at the booth for a while, his head would start bobbing up and down to the music. He seemed to drift off for a while, not noticing that Megan seemed to be off doing her own thing. Finally after what seemed like several minutes a girl came by with a drink. &quot;This is from the guys at the cocktail table.&quot; She pointed, the guys waved. Will was about to point out his wrist accessory when she just walked away, leaving him with the strawberry daiquiri. He smiled nicely and waved to the guys in thanks, hoping that would be the end of it. &quot;Man, what loser sends a girl a daiquiri.&quot; He said out loud, taking a sip of the drink. Will shrugged and continued to sip. &quot;That's actually not so bad.&quot; He felt a familiar warm feeling as the alcohol flooded his system. &quot;Wow, better take it slow...&quot;</p>
