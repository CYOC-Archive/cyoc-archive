<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The moment I said that lots of hands shut up.<br />
<br />
“Another woman volunteer.” I clarified and all the men in the audience put their hands down. I look through the audience until I found the ideal volunteer. Another French girl by the name of Blair; she held up her hand, although she looked like she was unenthusiastic about it. She was dressed up as Bell from Beauty and the Beast.<br />
<br />
Blair is a girl mine & Brad’s age and she’s a foreign exchange student. Most of the guys in our school like the fact that she’s exotic, curvy, and busty; but I did not like her. In fact, if you were compare her to Monique I like Monique more due to her personality and beauty. Monique is soft-spoken yet hardworking, intelligence, and kind which is probably why Mrs. Brockman has her as the head maid.<br />
<br />
Blair on the other hand is selfish, narcissistic, and if she’s doesn’t get the attention she deserves she throws a tantrum. In fact despite being French she doesn’t look like it. Her facial features, hair, and skin tone don’t match up with someone whose ancestry stretches back generations from France. She looks more like immigrants that settle in France and she was just born & raised there. In my opinion she obviously didn’t deserve to be here as an exchange student.<br />
<br />
“Blair Dupuy, come on up.” I called out as everyone in the audience broke out in applause as Blair got up. She didn’t look overly enthusiastic. I look over to Mrs. Brockman who watch with interest as I smiled when I plan to do. Mrs. Brockman, despite how she treats her maids she was always a bit nicer & more rewarding to those who are soft-spoken, hardworking, and kind. Almost as if she was raising adult daughters at least that’s how I view her relationship with Monique. As soon as Blair was on stage, I had both girls face the audience.<br />
<br />
“Now girls tell the audience is a bit about yourselves.” I instructed.<br />
<br />
“I’m Monique Beaumont. I am 24 years old and the Brockman’s head maid. And I’ve been working for them for two years now. I have a good education, but failed to secure a job in the modeling industry should have try something else.” Monique said in her French accent which had hint of sadness in the last part. This got a snort from Blair but I gave her a glare. “I’m hoping to not stay a maid forever.” Resorting in another snort from Blair.<br />
<br />
“Okay Blair why don’t you introduce yourself to the audience?” I asked sternly.<br />
<br />
“Sure thing. I’m Blair Dupuy, I’m 18 years old and I’m an exchange student but everyone here knows that. I’ve been here three years going on four and when I graduate obviously I’m gonna find a job in the modeling industry and get it on my first try.” Blair said with confidence. It’s obvious that her accent has faded overtime she lived in the states while Monique kept her accent. I smiled deviously at what I’m about to do. I turned to address the audience.<br />
<br />
“Well folks here we have two French girls who could be no different from one another. One that has been through so much yet hopeful for the future and one that has been put down enough. Let’s fix that.” I announced as I turned towards the two girls. “Now please stand still this next is gonna be important.” They did as they were told as I went behind them and pulled out a sheet.<br />
<br />
I toss the sheet over Monique covering her, then proceeded to take out another sheet and cover Blair with it. I silently made the wishes as I got between them and held my hands above their heads. The difference in height between the two women were obvious was Monique being an inch taller than me and Blair being an inch shorter than me. I’m currently 5‘8“ for those trying to keep track. <br />
<br />
I pat their heads once, then with my right hand (with the ring on it) over Monique I pushed down while with my left hand over Blair I moved up. Both girls height changed to follow my hands and as if something was on enough, their shapes underneath the blankets seem to change but they were minor. I stopped as soon as Monique’s height changed to be an inch shorter than me while Blair‘s height has changed to be taller than me. I finally had their heads again as if to stop further changes.<br />
<br />
A golden wave shot out and encompasses the room, as a result everyone in the room, except for the two figures under the sheets held their head, said that they had a minor headache included. As soon as I recovered, I grabbed the sheets and pulled them off the girls. Boy were the changes noticeable to an extreme.<br />
<br />
Monique was now younger and no longer wearing the maid outfit. In fact, she was dress as Bell from Beauty as Beast and boy, does it look like that outfit look more like her speed. Granted her feature seems to soften, including her bust, but I do not care about that part of her. She held her head with her hand, as if she also now got a headache for looking around confuse. It only last a moment before she look at me and smiled before turning to face the audience. <br />
<br />
Blair had changed the most; she now looked older, it looked like she grew a size and she was wearing the maid uniform. What was odd is she looked forward as if she was following instructions. When I took a closer look, I noticed that the maid uniform was more risqué compared to the normal maid uniforms the Brockman maids wear. I looked at the audience to gage everyone’s reaction at this change. <br />
<br />
Most of the girls in the audience pouted at this change, most of the single men in the audience were shifting in their seats to hide their erections, those that have girlfriends got the smack from them. Brad wasn’t even bothered trying to hide the erection he was having staring at Blair, but his girlfriend Jessica just rolling her eyes in disappointment. Mrs. Brockman was a mix bag as when she looked at Monique, she was smiling; but when she looked at Blair, she was furious and upset. Decided to take control the situation, I decided to continue on as this was part of the act.<br />
<br />
“There you have a folks I made two people in the audience disappear and then reappear on this stage.” I lied as if this was part of the act before turning to the girls. “Now ladies do mind introducing yourself and tell a bit about yourselves?” I asked them. Blair spoke  out first.<br />
<br />
“I’m Blair Dupuy. I’m 24 years old.” Blair said with a hint of an accent. “I am one of the Brockman’s maids and I am from France. I have been working for them for two years. I one of the sexy and best maids in this house.” Blair post before Mrs. Brockman decide to interrupt.<br />
<br />
“You’re dead last in my list of capable maids, Blair and I already got on your case today about wearing that uniform. It’s bad enough if you tried to wear it all the time around my husband, even though he turns you down but here? Do you have no shame?” Comment/ask Mrs. Brockman. Earning a chuckle from the girls in the audience. Once to chuckling died down Monique decide to speak up.<br />
<br />
“I’m Monique Beaumont. I am 18 years old and a French foreign exchange student.” Monique started to say with a heavy French accent. “I live with the Brockman’s as my host family, and I have been living with them since my freshman year. I’m a hard worker, quick study, work part-time, straight A student with a passion for math and business. I work part-time and I have a handsome boyfriend here today.” She said before she grab my hand which caught my attention. She then close in and kiss me straight on the lips. Earning a cheer from the audience.<br />
<br />
As we broke, the kiss, she looked at me with the eyes telling me that she remembers her previous life, but is enjoying the new life she has now. In this new life she is an exchange student and surprisingly it was Mrs. Brockman that introduced her to me. Boy is a fun relationship getting it to where it is now I even had to video call her father to ask for his permission to go out with her. Which things to Mrs. Brockman backing he accepted. I turned to face to address the audience.<br />
<br />
“Blair Dupuy and my girlfriend Monique Beaumont.” I called out, causing everyone to break down into applause. The two girls gave their bows and left to stage. Monique going to an empty very close to the front of the stage. Blair surprising left to do whatever duty she think she hast to do. However, as she was leaving, she was swinging her hips back-and-forth, and she passed the boys in the audience. This caused the boys to follow her which earned those that had a girlfriends another smacked to the back of their heads including Brad. Mrs. Brockman just glared at her, it was obvious that she disliked this particular maid. I didn’t clear my throat gaining the audiences attention.<br />
<br />
“For this next trick, I’ll need a cheerleader to volunteer.” I announce, and as a result, multiple hand shut up. Brad seemed to invited most of the cheerleaders no matter the grade. All eight senior cheerleaders showed up while; only six out of eight junior cheerleaders, four out of eight sophomore cheerleaders, and two out of eight freshman cheerleaders showed up. Now depending on which cheerleader I choose will determine my next trick.<br />
<br />
The senior cheerleaders were all white girls wearing other counties clothing so that’s a race change. The junior cheerleaders costumes made them look like animals so animal change. The sophomore cheerleaders dress in outfits that to me; make them look like perfect statues. Finally there wasn’t enough freshman cheerleaders to come up with a perfect uniform transformation for them so I’ll make it up as I go along.</p>
