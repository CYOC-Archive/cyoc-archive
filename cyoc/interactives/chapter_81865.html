<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After some time investigating our new living space, I began to think about what to do next.  Right now there were six of us, two male and four female.  I decided I wanted to double those numbers, so there were would be four males and eight females in our group.  Perhaps this was a bit ambitious, but it's what I wanted.  Once I had this group fully assembled, I would somehow announce to the entire world that I was going to change it in my own way.<br />
<br />
It occurred to me many times that my plans to essentially take over the world may not be what had really been intended when I'd been given the ring.  But I did truly want to make the world a better, yet different place for everyone.  I wasn't going to punish people.  Whenever I doubted myself I kept falling back to one thought:  I must have been given the ring for a very good reason.  Without trying to be too philosophical, my reasoning was that this ring had such a power that only one responsible enough to wield it would ever be allowed to possess it.  It was a higher power.  I also reasoned that if someone could bestow such a power upon another, that person must be some kind of monitor over it.  That is to say, that person was likely observing me and my actions somehow and could always show up and remove the power from me.  I hoped this would never happen, and so I was determined to not act out of malice.  <br />
<br />
Was changing George's father into a bit of a bimbo malicious?  I didn't think so.  I believed that deep down George's father had been carrying the guilt of his actions for so long that he needed to be freed from it.  He certainly was free from it now.  The only thing that really concerned me about my actions was not giving people a choice.  I'd only granted Kelly true choice before any of my changes.  But once again I came back to the thought that I was given this power for a purpose, so my actions must be right.<br />
<br />
Enough of this for now, I thought.  You could drive yourself crazy playing this out in your mind.  I decided what my next course of action would be.  I had to find the woman I'd embarrassed on the street earlier today.  I had two reasons for wanting to do this.  First, and most important, to see if I could somehow make up to her what I'd done to her.  Second, I remembered that while I wished for the effects of that wish to be forgotten and ignored by everyone but me, she seemed to fully remember what happened.  I had to find out if this was so and why.<br />
<br />
I gathered everyone into the main living room of our penthouse.  &quot;Bozantum and I will be going out on an errand right now,&quot; I explained.  &quot;As for the rest of you, I'd like you all to just stay here and have some fun with each other.&quot;  I emphasized the last three words of my sentence.  I wanted and fully expected them to start enjoying their bodies.  I flashed a devious smile at them and added, &quot;Make sure you do anything you think I would.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bozantum and I headed for the elevator.  Just as we were about to depart, Myrintha came running up to us.  &quot;My goddess, you'll need this,&quot; she said as she handed me one of the keycards.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you so much, my friend,&quot; I said.  &quot;We'd have some trouble returning without this.&quot;  I realized we didn't have anywhere to carry it.  So I simply wished that Bozantum's loincloth would have a small, sealable pocket where the keycard could be safely stored.  Once I saw it appear, I put it inside the pocket and sealed it.  &quot;There, no problems now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Before you leave, my goddess, I must speak with you,&quot; added Myrintha.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it, my friend?&quot; I asked.  <br />
<br />
She swallowed hard.  &quot;Well, I understand what you want us to do,&quot; she said.  &quot;But...it feels weird to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Immediately I understood what she found weird.  While the other three had no memories of who they had been, Myrintha still remembered that they were her, rather George's, old family.  It was the same problem I had in realizing that Bozantum had been my mother.  So I put her mind at ease the same I'd done with my own.  I wished that while she would still remember who the other three had been, she would have not be distracted by the fact and would be able to engage with them in any manner, particularly a sexual one.<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand your feelings,&quot; I said to her as I placed my hands on her shoulders.  &quot;But I have an idea that they are not so troublesome anymore, are they?&quot;<br />
<br />
Myrintha slowly smiled at me.  &quot;No,&quot; she said.  Her smile broadened.  &quot;They are not.  How did you...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My power, as always,&quot; I said.  &quot;Keep your mind at ease and do what feels natural.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will, my goddess, I will,&quot; she said.  She took me in her arms and hugged me tightly.  I had to say that there was a very nice sensation when our breasts pressed together.  It also made me realize something.  While all of my sexual desires so far had been with males, I was definitely curious about having sex with a female.  It was something I'd have to explore later.  This body continued to amaze me.  <br />
<br />
Myrintha returned to the living room and Bozantum and I entered the elevator.  Since I'd just had a moment of feeling bi-curious, I wondered if Bozantum had any such feelings.  &quot;Bozantum, my dear, I know that you are a perfect lover, but I wonder...how do you feel about two women having sex with each other?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
He looked at me with question in his eyes.  &quot;It makes no difference to me,&quot; he said.  &quot;A woman can do as she pleases.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about two men having sex with each other?&quot; I asked.  My expectation would be if you asked a man who looked like Bozantum that question you wouldn't get a positive answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Same thing,&quot; he said.  &quot;What two men decide to do with each other is their business, not mine.&quot;  <br />
<br />
I was glad to see he was open-minded.  Now for the real whammy of a question.  &quot;Would you have sex with another man?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
He opened his mouth and then closed it.  I'd caught him off-guard, evidently.  &quot;I don't know,&quot; he finally said.  &quot;I've never thought about it until now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well don't worry,&quot; I said.  &quot;I was just curious.&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked at me and said, &quot;I would if you asked me to.&quot;<br />
<br />
I smiled.  &quot;I appreciate your devotion,&quot; I said.  &quot;I don't think I would ask you to do that unless you wanted to.&quot;  He was about to say something else but I called him off.  &quot;Don't worry, we have more important things to do now.&quot;<br />
<br />
The elevator dropped us off at the ground floor and we walked back through the lobby.  I saw the receptionist look up at us as we walked past him.  I gave him a quick wink.  Still he remained absolutely expressionless.  He was a tough nut to crack.  I continued to wonder if I should try to crack him open or not.<br />
<br />
Once we were outside I realized we had no idea where we needed to go.  I made a quick wish to know the address of my victim from earlier today.  Fortunately it was only about a 10 minute walk away from the hotel.  It was nighttime now.  The sun had set and the moon was up.  It was for this reason I took Bozantum with me.  Even though I felt quite certain that I could take care of myself if necessary, since I had the ring, having Bozantum with me meant no one would even think about trying to mess with me.<br />
<br />
The night air was cooler and I loved the feeling of it on my bare breasts.  My nipples were rock hard in response to the cooler air.  I put my arm around Bozantum's arm so that he escorted me like a proper gentleman.  It dawned on me that I really wanted to have sex with him at right that moment, but that would have to wait.<br />
<br />
We arrived at the house of my victim from the afternoon.  I realized I didn't know her name, but that was OK for now.  Her house was a small house, but at least it had its own four walls.  I walked up to the door, pressed the doorbell, and waited.</p>
