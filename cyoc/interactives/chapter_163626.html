<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>The nudity warning is more parts mentioned but not acutally seen...</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rose, meanwhile, lay as comfortably as she could in the bed that she was moved to in Moon Lake&#39;s hospital. She wasn&#39;t in the ER anymore, she knew that much and from some of the signs that she&#39;d read, she didn&#39;t think it was any intensive care ward of the hospital either. Her best assumption was that it was more of an observation ward than anything else, and given the things that had happened over the course of the evening that had put her in the emergency room, that made sense. She remembered the Mountain Lion attacking her, and while she didn&#39;t see anything to indicate that it was sick with anything, given that they wouldn&#39;t be able to test the Mountain Lion until the morning, it made sense to take precautions against things like Rabies.<br />
<br />
Though, trying to argue about &quot;comfort&quot; for her was a bit difficult at the moment. She had a bandage pad on her forehead and with another one wrapped around her head to hold it on a way that would her heal from the gashes that the Mountain Lion had left on her head toward the end of its attack on her, and that held her hair down. Parts of it even itched a bit, largely as while she was a bit more interested in sports than other girls growing up, that didn&#39;t mean she preferred short hair.  There were also points where her forearms were bandaged to cover the stitches that held tight the area where the Mountain Lion got her good. Her ankle was similarly bandaged to cover stiches. It was only her right shoulder that had a more disposable bandage. It left her forearms a bit itchy but she couldn&#39;t scratch at that because of the bandages wrapped around her forearms to protect the stiches.<br />
<br />
The most uncomfortable thing, though, was her breathing. She had a bit of pain whenever she breathed in. It wasn&#39;t so painful that she couldn&#39;t breathe, but it was enough that the ER had added in the X-Rays and other scans to double check some things. From what those determined, the Mountain Lion had landed on her back with enough force to bruise a few of her ribs and that was the cause of her present pain. Whenever she breathed in, her lungs expanded and pushed against already injured bones, but Rose counted her blessings that nothing was broken. That would allow her to return home in the morning, assuming she didn&#39;t have any negative reaction overnight to the shots she&#39;d been given. Though it also meant for the moment she couldn&#39;t move much, if only to prevent herself from further agitating things. It left her laying there and alone with her thoughts.<br />
<br />
And the room she&#39;d been moved too wasn&#39;t too bad. The walls had some rather friendly wall paper that was sort of soft blue with white flowers printed on them. To her right she could look out to see out into the area around the hospital in a way that she couldn&#39;t in the ER. And from what she could see, things did look relatively calm and peaceful. It left Rose thinking that Moon Lake&#39;s weres were probably going about their business for the night, their loves, their hunts, and their furry bodies.<br />
<br />
&quot;And in time that will likely include me,&quot; Rose thought to herself as she looked over to the window and seeing some the lights that were on the nearby houses.<br />
<br />
That came from the knowledge that Richard had become a were, largely as a result of their argument and his then tripping on a rock as they wandered through the woods looking for a were before stumbling onto Sheila Wiggleston. And once Richard became a were, Rose had two real options. One would be to divorce Richard and leave or become a were to be with him. But she did love Richard, and in some ways, even while Richard was with Sheila, she thought that Richard did love her. In that it was an odd thing, but now in the hospital room, she accepted it in a way. It was odd, but then, Rose also had to admit that love was never necessarily &quot;logical.&quot; People tended to do odd things when they were in love, and she was sure that she and Richard had done their fair share of odd when they started dating, got married, and started their family. It was one of the things that made love wonderful, and Rose didn&#39;t want to lose Richard. That had been part of her fears when she stormed out before ultimately running into the Mountain Lion... that Richard would leave her for Sheila and Moon Lake&#39;s weres and never return to her.<br />
<br />
Some of those fears though were offset by the last moments they&#39;d had together in the room she was in and in the ER before she was moved from there to where she was now. Richard did apologize for letting new were instincts get the better of him the way he did and did so in a way that Rose was sure was honest on his part. Rose didn&#39;t know how she knew, but she just did and she was glad for that. Then as they essentially had their kiss and make up moment once they got from the ER to the room she was presently in, it soon lead to kisses and to a point where Richard was actually getting ready to climb into the bed with her, despite her injuries and the fact that bruised ribs. And at the same time as he started to do so, Rose thought she felt a rather large human penis tenting her husband&#39;s pants... though they didn&#39;t look like anything Richard owned. Richard was fully dressed and thus Rose couldn&#39;t see anything, but her sense of touch was still there and as such, she had the sense that Richard was getting aroused over her, despite not being in Sheila&#39;s league physically and with her head and forearms wrapped in bandages. Thankfully, she managed to get control of things for the moment.<br />
<br />
It proved to be something of a reassurance that Richard still loved her, and a part of Rose was well of the fact that her husband looked much better now as a werelion. But it would also mean that if she and Richard were to stay together, Rose would have to become a were, herself. The guidebook that Samantha Twist had left gave some very basic rundowns on weres and how they were built, and Rose was partially amazed at how many different kinds of weres there were. The critical thing was that the condition couldn&#39;t be blocked and that if a were had sex with a normal human, that normal WOULD become a were, and the same kind of were as the one that they were mating with. And since she and Richard weren&#39;t too old to &quot;not&quot; have sex, from the way Sheila described things, Richard&#39;s libido would get a very healthy rise as a werelion, and as such, Rose would need to become a were to be with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course... now the question is what were to be,&quot; Rose thought to herself as she shifted over to lay back against the pillow and look upward toward the ceiling while only a small lamp above her head was lit, &quot;and many of them do look nice...&quot;<br />
<br />
Though most of that was determined by the guidebook&#39;s drawings. The only weres she&#39;d actually seen transformed were Samantha Twist and Shelia... and then there was her husband as well. And she did find Richard&#39;s new form quite intriguing, and if it weren&#39;t for the fact that she was recovering from being attacked by a mundane animal, a part of her mind wasn&#39;t above just being a werelion to be with Richard. But that was just carnal lust in the immediate heat of that moment. Though it wasn&#39;t as though werelions would be a truly bad choice, their whole society structure that mirrored mundane lion prides aside. For Sheila looked strong, athletic, in addition to being more voluptuous than Rose was after three pregnancies. Rose couldn&#39;t deny that she could see that Sheila carried herself well...<br />
<br />
&quot;But then the base description for all weres would be that they&#39;re generally built that way,&quot; Rose thought to herself, &quot;the smallest cup size weres would seem to have is a D, which is big. They&#39;re all at least reasonably well toned and with wide hips... the only thing that differs them...&quot;<br />
<br />
Her thoughts were interrupted by a knock on the door. Rose turned to see a lone woman enter rolling in a standing tray. On top of it was a plastic dish that had what looked like ham, some peas, and mashed potatoes on the plate. Beside the plate was a glass of water.<br />
<br />
&quot;How are you feeling Mrs. Van Direstag?&quot; the woman asked, &quot;any additional pain or anything like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No not at the moment... at least nothing beyond the soreness when breathing in,&quot; Rose managed, &quot;and you&#39;re..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can call me, Phoebe,&quot; the woman answered, &quot;and I&#39;m with the nursing staff here in the Observation Ward. If anything happens... I&#39;ll get the appropriate doctor to handle the case. Right now, I figured I&#39;d bring you something to eat... as it&#39;s pushing ten PM. It&#39;s a late dinner... but it&#39;ll help you heal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rose didn&#39;t answer, but managed a blush when she felt her stomach gurgle at the mention of food. She&#39;d felt a bit weak when she first awoke in the ER and getting from the ER&#39;s bed to the larger bed in the observation ward was a bit difficult and took some help from Richard and Doctor Chlorophylls just to make it, likely a result of the blood lost in the attack. In that, all Rose wanted was the ability to regain her energy, some of which was now returning as the transfusion she&#39;d gotten helped. With that, Rose began to pay a bit more attention to her hunger.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose I am a bit hungry,&quot; Rose managed as she let Phoebe roll the stand up so that the platform sat over Rose&#39;s lap. Phoebe then set down a knife and fork on the plate so that Rose could use them.<br />
<br />
&quot;The call button should be right behind you under the speaker, should you need it,&quot; Phoebe spoke, &quot;just press that and I or one of the other nurses will be by to check on you. Will there be anything else you need?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not for the moment... thank you for the food,&quot; Rose answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Phoebe replied as she then turned and left the room.<br />
<br />
Rose was quick to dig into her food, and while it wasn&#39;t top tier restaurant good, it was rather good. Though given that she hadn&#39;t eaten since just before noon, Rose wasn&#39;t about to complain about the food, regardless of its quality. As she ate she also knew that she&#39;d need to spend some time with the Moon Lake Guide in order to at least get started on figuring out what kind of were to become...</p>
