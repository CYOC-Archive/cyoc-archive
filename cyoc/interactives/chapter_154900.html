<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Suddenly, as he was flexing, he heard a knock at his bedroom door. Startled, Jim nearly let go of the balloon.<br />
<br />
“Jim, are you in there?” It was his mom. He had not even heard her come in the house as he was so focused on his own transformations.<br />
<br />
He looked down at himself. He was a half naked young man now. That might be a problem. He panicked and while he tried to remember if he had said &quot;Release&quot; he said it anyways, then he started to blow into it.<br />
<br />
“Jim?”<br />
<br />
“Is this big enough?” he wondered as he tried to figure out how much air he needs to go back to his original age. “One second, Mom,” he said to her. His voice sounded nothing like a kid but a young man. He was nervously shaking. Even his fingers were struggling with the big balloon between them. So big, that it suddenly... POOP!! It popped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Crap&quot;, he thought, &quot;No no no!&quot; He started to repeat as he saw the balloon pieces on the floor. &quot;This isn&#39;t happening!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; That&#39;s enough, Jim. I&#39;m coming in!&quot; His mother said before she started to open the door.<br />
<br />
“She can&#39;t see me like this” he said and jumped onto his bed. He covered himself with his bed sheets but he was so tall that his feet came out from downside. His only option was to take a fetal position and pray for a miracle.<br />
<br />
The door opened. His mom poked her head in.<br />
<br />
“What’s going on in here?”<br />
<br />
“Nothing,” he said, trying to make his voice sound higher. “I was taking a nap.” he said as he tried his best to keep covered.<br />
<br />
“Really?” she asked. “And why are you so covered? It&#39;s a hot day.”<br />
<br />
True! he thought. He was sweating just by the few seconds he was in there.<br />
<br />
“What are you up to?” she asked, glaring him.<br />
<br />
“Nothing,” he said. &quot;It feels comfortable to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
His mom looked ready to investigate more closely, but then she stopped. Jim was in luck. His mom seemed exhausted from his sister’s soccer game. “Okay, then. Fine. It doesn’t matter what it is, just as long as you don’t break anything or hurt yourself. Okay?”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m just sleeping.”<br />
<br />
“Right, ‘sleeping.’”<br />
<br />
“Yep.”<br />
<br />
“Dinner in fifteen minutes. Finish up your ‘sleeping’ by then.”<br />
<br />
“Right.”<br />
<br />
She gave him one last concerned look. He held his breath. It seemed that for a brief second, her eyes showed a momentary flash of confusion, as if she exactly knew what was he doing. After all, her son is 12, he&#39;s starting to get curious about his body.<br />
<br />
Jim let out a big sigh. That was a close one.<br />
<br />
He hurried back to the mirror. What is he going to do? Without the balloon he was stuck in that age. Could he pretend it&#39;s just a growth spurt? Nah, maybe for a few inches but not a whole foot. Surely he&#39;s as tall as his dad now. Let alone all the hair that had grown in his armpits and crotch.<br />
<br />
After staring at his crotch, he glanced at his newly grown manhood. He definitely can&#39;t hide that in his old briefs. He desperately needed clothes, then he could think of what to do about the balloon. He looked in his closet but all his shirts and pants seemed very small on his new frame. Even his baggy clothes didn&#39;t feel comfortable. <br />
<br />
&quot;How much time was left before dinner?&quot; He wondered as he put on sleeveless shirt. It displayed all of his hairy armpits but at least it fit him. &quot;What I&#39;m going to say? Mom, dad, a magic balloon made me older? They&#39;ll call the cops before I could give them an explanation.&quot; He tried to wear all of his underwear but it was like getting a wedgie after another. &quot;Commando it will be...&quot; He sighed as he adjusted his dick inside the green running shorts that an older cousin left a month ago. &quot;Agh, it smells like piss.&quot; He wondered if his cousin use to go commando too. Nasty.<br />
<br />
He looked at himself in the mirror once again. He didn&#39;t look bad, a good looking high school senior ready for some exercise. However, he wasn&#39;t going to exercise nor he was a high school senior. He was in his first year of middle school for God&#39;s sake! It&#39;s a dream to look this good as a young man, but this wasn&#39;t the right time for that. He needed to go back to normal.<br />
<br />
“Crap!” He said when he watched his phone and realized that he has no time left.<br />
<br />
If he did not go to the kitchen right now, his mom would surely figure out something was wrong. She already had looked suspicious at the door. He had to think of something.<br />
<br />
Jim took his phone and called for his best friend, maybe he could help him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; An clearly recognizable 12 years old boy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gabe? It&#39;s me,  Jim.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I have your phone number registered.&quot; Gabe replied. &quot;But, why do you sound so weird?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll explain it to you later.&quot; Jim replied. &quot;I need you to make me a big favor!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? I&#39;ve already lend you ten bucks this morning!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I don&#39;t need money. I need you to convince my mother that I can&#39;t have dinner tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you expect that I will do that? Why don&#39;t you tell her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She can&#39;t see me right now. Nobody can. Please! You&#39;re a smart boy, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find out a way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, Jim...!&quot; Gabe tried to reply but Jim had already left his phone. Although of his reaction, he knew that Gabe will help him.<br />
<br />
He put his phone in his pocket and carefully headed downstairs, looking back every two steps to make sure that no one will see him. He didn&#39;t enter in the kitchen, he just poked his head to see if there was someone there. There was, his mom, his dad and his sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where&#39;s Jim?&quot; His dad asked his mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told him to come fifteen minutes ago.&quot; His mother replied. &quot;I&#39;m going for him.&quot; She was standing up when her phone rang. &quot;Hello? Oh, hi Gabe...&quot;<br />
<br />
Thank Gabe, Jim thought. He saw that his mother took a seat again while she talked with Gabe.<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand.&quot; She said. &quot;Well, if that&#39;s the case, he won&#39;t come to eat.&quot;<br />
<br />
I love you Gabe! Jim thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who called you?&quot; His dad asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Gabe.&quot; His mother replied. &quot;He was worried for Jim, because he was bullied really bad today at school. He told me that Jim was crying so much that he couldn&#39;t talk with him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s terrible.&quot; Jim&#39;s dad said. &quot;He&#39;s small for his age, so he&#39;s frequently bullied by bigger kids. I hope he could get bigger after puberty.&quot;<br />
<br />
You have no idea, dad. Jim thought as he scratched an armpit.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to give him some space.&quot; His mother said. &quot;I&#39;ll talk to him later.&quot;<br />
<br />
His dad nodded and kept eating but Jim wasn&#39;t too relaxed. Gabe him gave him some time but he had to face his parents sooner or later.</p>
