<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tim Enderson definitely hadn’t dreamt all those flashes of green caressing every living pore out of his body, that’s for sure. The nearly naked big bear of a man stood up swiftly from his bed, libertating himself from the soft prison that his sheets made from 100% cotton were, and with a grunt he wondered who was the unlucky son of a bitch that had dared entering his property.<br />
<br />
He could hear the intruders talking among themselves. Who were they? Robbers? Tim couldn’t make heads or tails of their language, so they must be illegal immigrants on top of that.<br />
<br />
The hairy bare feet of the man walked towards the door as his knuckles were clenched. The man didn’t even bother owning a baseball bat: his fists were the only weapon he needed to protect himself. And for that matter, the only piece of armor he was wearing were the not-so-white-anymore briefs covering his ample bulge. The only thing that covered his pecs and muscle gut was a big tuft of black hair, and that only helped intimidate any possible intruders even more.<br />
<br />
Mr. Enderson was about to open the door before charging at the intruders acting and looking like a B-Movie barbarian when a scene completely out of this world developed before his very own eyes...<br />
<br />
The intruders opened the door first.<br />
One of the two intruders was holding a gun, pointing straight at Mr. Enderson’s heart.<br />
Both intruders were aliens.<br />
<br />
Mr. Enderson almost pissed himself right then at there. He was being held at gunpoint by aliens! Not illegal aliens, mind you, but full-blown nightmarish monsters from outer space! The way the taller one pointed its gun at the poor human without any hesitancy was terrifying but just look at its body! It was clothed in a relatively human-looking brown trench coat but its scaly black colored skin delated its true nature.<br />
<br />
The most disturbing thing about it was not its front, but its huge behind. Its bottom was way too large and scantily-covered to be considered decent by any standard by itself but the thing was... well... it was fucking ALIVE! The two big buttcheeks moved from side to side with a big gaping anus looking around the whole room in a displeased manner. Whenever its master turned around its stinky butthole acted like a third eye, constantly monitoring Mr. Enderson’s movements with clear distaste for the human.<br />
<br />
The other alien was shorter but way thicker. Contrary to the tall alien this one didn’t own three eyes... it had TWELVE eyes! And they didn’t stop spinning like a roulette! Considering the evident bulge, this one was male (?).<br />
<br />
Okay, maybe it hadn’t been a good idea to go unarmed. Mr. Enderson stood with his hands in the air, not moving a muscle. In this vulnerable position the man’s musclegut looked more like a plain big beer belly, to his shame. In fact he no longer felt like B-movie barbarian... He felt like a damsel in distress being held captive by the strangest monsters! He stood still in fear, frozen solid like a statue. Any abrupt movement could land him dead, but he also didn’t know what the aliens demanded out from him. Both aliens didn’t stop talking, but their voices sounded like inhuman gibberish to Mr. Enderson. Where they looking for the de facto human leader? Human knowledge? Sex slaves for their space colony? Fuck, if only he could understand their language...<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
“So you want to remodel this messy room into an Earthian recreation room? Do you even know what that is?”<br />
“Well, of course!” Mr. Wheeler said. “It’s where Earthians have fun and play with each other, right? I’m so excited to find out what they do for fun!”<br />
Was it Agent’s imagination or was Mr. Wheeler’s bulge growing bigger? Weirdo.<br />
<br />
Agent held a fierce grip on the AutoDecorator, which got quite heavy when fully charged. He was glad he had it, because the Earthian room was a complete mess to fix by himself. The bedsheets were undone, the desk’s placement wasn’t fully perpendicular to the wall and worse of all there was a coat hanger right in the middle of the room. Did Mr. Enderson had no taste at all?<br />
<br />
The color of the coat hanger didn’t fit the style of the room at all. It was mostly pink, with round corners that gave it an organic feel. It had grown what seemed to be black strands mold on the front side and on its top. Thankfully, the mold on its top seemed to be receding.<br />
<br />
The piece of furniture reeked badly. When was the last time it had been cleaned? It was also very out of shape, with multiple irregular bumps all over it that served no useful purpose. It only had two arms pointing up, which reduced its usability unless you only owned two coats.<br />
<br />
It had a few crevices on the top part where oxygen seemed to be rapidly accumulating causing some annoying sound effects along the way.<br />
<br />
Still pointing the lighted up AutoDecorator at it, Agent checked out the texture of the coat hanger. Just as he suspected, it was full of ugly pores filled to the brim with humidity. Yuck. He tried brushing out some of the black strands of mold from the front, but it seemed to be firmly stuck to the thing. He plucked some black strands from it and licked them a little. He grimaced and tossed the disgusting thing away.<br />
<br />
He noticed the coat hanger was also very soft to the touch, which placed in question its durability. The huge bump on the front had a big crevice on it. Agent put its finger inside and found out there was lot of dirt inside.<br />
<br />
He hadn’t noticed it before because of the huge bump, but apparently someone had left some dirty rag laying around on the lower part of the coat hanger. He took it off and it ripped in half. Oh, well. He placed it on top of the coat hanger but quickly realized that only made the ridiculous thing even more pathetic.<br />
<br />
Interestingly, behind the rag there was even more mold and more bumps and crevices. Agent inspected them but found them boring. He liked artistic liberties in furniture, sure, but a coat hanger with so many useless appendages ruins its functionality. He checked the lower bump a final time to see if it extended into a third arm but it barely could expand.<br />
<br />
“This is such a lost cause. Thank the universe for the AutoDecorator.” Agent said right before he pulled the trigger.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
The tall alien stepped forward, gun in hand. Tim tried his best to stay as still and submissive as humanly possible. Oh shit, here it came! The menacing monster was so close he could smell its strange breath.<br />
<br />
The alien looked at him with clear disgust, but in its lizard-like eyes there was a glimmer of curiosity. It didn’t stop aiming its gun at Mr. Enderson but its scaly hand reached forward to the human’s bare chest.<br />
<br />
Tim wanted to just scream and run away but that would get him killed in an instant. These aliens clearly had to be explorators or scientists, because the thing was touching his pectorals as if it couldn’t believe what it was seeing. It surely had to be the first human this thing had encountered in its life.<br />
<br />
The dark clawed hand reached out to his chest. The touch made him shiver in utter fear. The alien hand touched and prodded his skin and the black hairs on his chest with what had to be interplanetary wonder.<br />
<br />
To Tim’s surprise the alien’s claws then ripped a patch of hair off his chest. For a second he thought the thing was about to try to rip his heart off him! He struggled to suppress a yelp of surprise.<br />
<br />
The alien’s tongue then tasted his chest hair and spit it out. Was it trying to find out how the human would taste? Mr. Enderson’s entire body shook with fear, his big bear belly contracting defensively but not for long because then the alien grabbed his big gut. It caressed it for a bit and then with great force its claw fingered his bellybutton. Clearly the alien expected Tim’s navel to go deeper. Oh shit, was it about to probe every other of his orifices as well?! Mr. Enderson didn’t want this thing handling his private parts like he was a piece of meat!<br />
<br />
As if in cue, the next thing the alien did was rip apart his not-so-white briefs in two. Oh fuck! Tim’s startled penis shrunk to baby size. Oh shit! Oh shit! Oh shit! What were these otherworldly creatures unblessed by the light of God up to?!<br />
<br />
But the next thing the alien did was to put the tattered briefs on top of Tim’s head. Needless to say, they reeked of dried cum and sweat. The alien grinned with amusement. What was the alien trying to communicate with this? That Tim was a dickhead? That he was its bitch now?<br />
<br />
What came next was really hard for Mr. Enderson to suffer without protesting. The clawed hand cupped his babymakers without a care in the world, not aware how important they were to the naked human. It squished them and smelled them, but he seemed to be clearly unimpressed. The alien then forcefully yanked at his uncut dick, stretching his foreskin painfully in the process. Was it... trying to give him an erection? It was only managing the exact opposite!<br />
<br />
The alien looked clearly disappointed at Tim. Had he not passed some sort of test? Would they dispose of him and look for a better prime example of a human male? Or maybe...<br />
<br />
But Tim couldn’t think further about the matter because unceremoniously and without warning the alien had pulled the trigger.</p>
