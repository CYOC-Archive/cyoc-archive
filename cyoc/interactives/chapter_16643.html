<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;By the way I told your dad about the swap&quot; Jim's mom said as she peeked her head back in the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;You what&quot; Jim exclaimed from the bed he was sitting on.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told him about the swap of course I didn't tell him the truth that you stole my body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you tell him then&quot; Jim questioned?<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry you'll see so just play along&quot; and before Jim could say anything the door closed leaving him alone in his parent's bedroom. <br />
<br />
Seconds later the door opened and Jim's dad stepped in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that you Jim&quot; he said staring at his wife's body which was sitting on the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes&quot; he said quietly as his eyes met his dads.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't believe your mom did this too you&quot; he stated as he moved over to the bed sitting next to the body of his wife. &quot;I mean we both knew you were wearing her clothes, but we thought it was just a stage and I thought we agreed to let you be, figuring you would stop in a few months. If not then we would do something. Instead today after the little argument at dinner she was so mad at you that she figured if you wanted to wear her clothes then you can wear them all the time along with wearing her body and living her life. So your mom uses a ring that swaps bodies and takes over your body leaving you in hers. Now she wants you to live her life being Janet Stinson until she feels that you know what its like to live her life just like you always wanted. But you don't want to be her, you just want to wear her clothes right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim thought for a second as he considered the question and considered what his mom said before leaving the bedroom. If his mom told his dad that she put him in her body then she didn't want Jim to admit that he wanted to be her instead he wanted him to be scared that he was her so Jim knew what his answer should be &quot;Yes dad I don't know what it is but I just love the feel of women's clothes, but I don't want to be a woman especially mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I know thats what I tried explaining to her however she doesn't care she said if he wants to wear my clothes then he can see what its like to be me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what are we going to do dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're going to do exactly what your mom wants Jim in order to get your body back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK so what do we have to do then dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well thats the first thing you can no longer call me dad its John. Plus you have to think of me not as your dad but your husband. Because right now your in the body of the woman who on her wedding wore a white wedding gown and walked down the aisle and married me then later that night made love to me. Your in the body of the woman I made love with in the Bahamas on our honeymoon, in our bedroom and in bed and many other places creating three lovely children in the process. Speaking of the children your the one who they call mom, the one who feeds, dresses and cares for them. So right now that who you are Janet Stinson, wife and mom.&quot; Just like I have to think of you as Janet Stinson, my wife, not as the one who I took to the ball games. Not as the one who i tossed the football and baseball with or played basketball in the driveway with. Not the one who I had to ground for coming home late or picking on your brothers. Instead I have to think of you as the person I could do this to.&quot; Jim felt his dad gently place his big hand over Jim's small manicured hand and stared directly into his eyes &quot;Janet Stinson I love you&quot; and then his dad started to move his head closer to his only Jim pulled back.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's wrong Janet&quot; John said as he caressed the hand of his wife only to have her pull her hand away. &quot;Listen I don't like this either but the sooner we get you acting like her, the sooner you can live her life like she does, and then the sooner you can get back in your body. So why don't we try this again&quot; and then he placed his hand on his wife's hand. &quot;Janet Stinson I love you&quot; and then his dad moved his head forward.<br />
<br />
Jim couldn't believe it as his dad just called him by his mom's name, Janet Stinson again and said I love you again even though he knew he wasn't Janet Stinson and now his dad was moving in to kiss him just like he would kiss his mom. <br />
<br />
As their lips met and his dad moved his hand to his back, rubbing the silk blouse, but Jim couldn't help to think about his mom and what a great idea by his mom. Now not only would his mom help Jim be her but now his dad would be treating him like her and helping him act like her too. As their lips broke apart, his dad spoke again.<br />
<br />
I guess we should move on to the next thing.</p>
