<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><i>Pop quiz</i>, said the anus to Butt.  <i>My roommates are out partying and I don&#39;t want to go to bed, yet.  What&#39;s my favorite way to pass the time?</i><br />
<br />
The skunktaur knew Sean well in this reality, and answered immediately.  &quot;Playing video games!&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>What?  But...</i>  Sean stopped himself from asking the logistics of how a skunktaur&#39;s anus would play video games.  He needed to keep up the facade of this reality being normal to his host.  <i>Yeah, you&#39;re right.  Let&#39;s do that.</i><br />
<br />
Technically, owning a game console was not allowed in the dorms, and there weren&#39;t many TV stations accessible outside the news stations, as TV and video games were initially deemed too big a distraction for students.  But the school turned a blind eye in recent years, after deciding said distractions at least kept their students out of trouble.<br />
<br />
Sean rode along under Butt&#39;s tail as she turned on the TV and N-One and grabbed the controller.  Then, the world turned upside-down as she lay on her back, her upper back resting against the sofa bed.  Once again, there was no physical sense of being flipped around, outside of the light pressures exerted by the rear surrounding him.  All he had to go by was the view in front of him, and though it was mentally disorienting to see the world upside-down, it didn&#39;t take long to get used to the view.<br />
<br />
And what a view it was.  Butt&#39;s tail lay spread out across the floor.  From his perspective, it was like the canopy of a furry tree.  Following its line of sight was the now-massive (but not all that big in reality) TV far across the room, seeming to hang upside-down from the table.  And then, far &quot;below&quot; Sean was the ceiling.  And although Sean no longer had a true sense of up and down, the view was still enough to give him a sense of vertigo.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which would you like me to play?&quot;  Oh, so Butt would be the one playing games?  That makes a lot more sense, though it didn&#39;t sound as fun as Sean playing the games himself.  As such, he didn&#39;t really think hard about picking among the many choices downloaded onto the system.  He just chose the newest game his roommates bought, an open-world racing game.  In hindsight (heh), it seemed an appropriate choice, as he himself was along for the ride.  &quot;Which mode?&quot;  Again, Sean was asked to make the choice.  He supposed that since Butt considered herself his body, he would be the one calling the shots as the owner of a body normally would.  But how would that work when it came to actual gameplay?  Sean imagined a disasterous gaming session ahead, as Butt constantly drove into things waiting for Sean to say when to turn.  So for now, he requested the sandbox mode.<br />
<br />
As it turns out, Butt had some amount of automation.  After instructing her where to go, she simply took off and did her own thing.  As Sean watched her drive around, he began to wonder why he would find this enjoyable.  Even if he never had bodily control in this reality, shouldn&#39;t he find watching someone else play boring?<br />
<br />
&quot;Sean, aren&#39;t you going to tell me what to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean awoke from his bored trance.  Okay, so he still needs to give her instructions.  He asked her to return to the starting point, and head off in a different direction.  One that he hadn&#39;t had the chance to explore, yet.  Though considering his viewpoint, even famliar areas felt somewhat new to him.  He briefly wondered if there should be an &quot;upside-down mode&quot; in the game by default.  As it turns out, probably not a good idea.  Instructing her which direction proved difficult from this perspective; he would tell Butt to turn left and she&#39;d go right.  Or rather, she did go left, but it was her left.<br />
<br />
After a while, though, he got used to the orientation, and started calling out the correct directions.  Soon, they had formed a special synchronization between each other.  He would anticipate a turn and direct her as needed.  Deciding to test that synchronization, Sean asked Butt to go into the online mode.  It was here that Sean learned that the synchronization wasn&#39;t perfect, as the fast-paced racing didn&#39;t completely allow for play-by-play instructions.  However, he also learned that Butt was a decent gamer all her own, and in fact seemed to inherit his own gaming skills.  And though she lost the first few races, she and him eventually resynced themselves, instructing her to perform specific tasks like shortcuts or blocking a racer coming up behind them.  In fact, the teamup soon became advantageous, as he was able to look at the mini-map and surrounding players while she focused on the road ahead.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, he was enjoying himself, despite not being the one playing.  In fact, it reminded him of when his roommates played without him.  Because of how bored he got watching them play, he would often find himself trying to tell them where to go and what to do.  They would get annoyed at this, though, telling them to stop back-seat gaming.  However, in this situation, not only was it necessary, but Butt enjoyed it!  (This was quite easy to tell, not only in the tone of her voice, but the way the &quot;canopy of fur&quot; above him swayed in excitement.)</p>
