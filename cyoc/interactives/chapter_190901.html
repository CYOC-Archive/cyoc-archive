<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Jeff thought about his perfect girlfriend, the girls in his school&#39;s various sport clubs came to mind. So he decided to turn his dad into an athletic girl. All that was left was to figure out what he was going to change specifically in the Chronivac. He turned it on and looked up his father&#39;s profile:<br />
<br />
Name: Mike Kendrick<br />
Age: 45<br />
Gender: Male<br />
Race: Caucasian<br />
IQ: 110<br />
Language: English<br />
Sex Drive: Low<br />
Build: Middle Age/Soft Muscles<br />
Hair: Short/Black/Gray on the Sides/Thinning<br />
Eyes: Dark Blue<br />
Occupation: Business Man/Single Father<br />
Family: Wife (Deceased)/Son/Daughter<br />
Love Interest: None<br />
<br />
&quot;Very detailed&quot; Jeff thought. The Chronivac was still something new to Jeff, so he didn&#39;t really know how specific were the changes that the Chronivac offered, nor the effect that those changes would have on reality. Each option that was shown on the computer interface offered opportunities for a more complex transformation, but Jeff wanted a simple change from a man to a girl, so he set the parameters that made the most sense for him.<br />
<br />
Name: Michelle Reed<br />
Age: 16<br />
Gender: Female<br />
Race: Caucasian<br />
IQ: 110<br />
Language: English<br />
Build: Slim/Strong legs and abs/Firm butt<br />
Cup Size: B<br />
Height: 5&#39;9&quot;<br />
Hair: Medium/Black/Smooth<br />
Eyes: Dark Blue<br />
Occupation: High schooler<br />
Sexual Orientation: Heterosexual<br />
Love Interest: Jeff Kendrick<br />
Mental Change: Yes<br />
Clothing Change: No<br />
Reality Change: No<br />
Duration of Transformation: 10 minutes<br />
Change Last Until: Twelve Hours<br />
<br />
The name that Jeff chose for the new girl was basically the female version of his father&#39;s name, Mike. He set the age to be the same as him, and kept race, language, and IQ the same as his dad&#39;s. For the body changes like hair and physique, this was basically made taking the girls at Jeff&#39;s school as reference. Many other settings were left untouched by Jeff, except for the clothing change, which was set to off just because, and the mental and reality changes. These two, Jeff figured, were very important. He turned on the mental change so that Michelle would be unaware of the changes, while he kept the reality changes off because he feared to what extent would reality be altered. Jeff finally clicked on the button &quot;Start Change&quot; as a 10-minute timer popped up.<br />
<br />
Jeff was excited to see his dad&#39;s transformation and his new girlfriend, it was going to be a first in more than one sense. He grabbed the portable emitter and substituted the 10 changes set in the device to Gender, Age, Height, Cup Size, Physique, Hair, Personality, Clothing Changes, Mental Changes, Reality Changes. Jeff went downstairs to observe the transformation.<br />
<br />
Mike was lying down in the couch waiting for the kick-off, eating some pizza, and then he saw his son Jeff come down from his room. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you going to watch the game, Jeff?&quot; asked Mike.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, yeah Dad, I wanted to watch it with you. Try something new, you know?&quot; said Jeff.<br />
<br />
Mike noticed that Jeff was acting weird, he seemed anxious. &quot;Are you feeling alright, son?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, dunno why would you ask that, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
His son still looked nervous, but Mike thought that perhaps it was something his son didn&#39;t want to share, just like what he was hiding when he went to his bedroom, so he stopped trying to figure it out.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Jeff was trying to check if any changes were already taking place. The portable emitter showed the timer but it didn&#39;t show the process of the transformation. Jeff thought that perhaps he should&#39;ve made Michelle have an appearance more different than just being an &quot;athletic girl&quot;, since she still was going to have Mike&#39;s hair color, eye color, and skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever&quot; thought Jeff, &quot;I set the time to 10 minutes so the transformation happened quickly, I bet I will begin seeing a change any minute now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Three minutes passed and the game began. Jeff was disappointed since nothing seemed to happen to his dad. It was when Mike stood up and went to the kitchen that Jeff noticed his dad seemed smaller, both in height and weight. His cargo pants and the red t-shirt seemed oversized in his body.<br />
<br />
When Mike came back from the kitchen and sat in the couch, Jeff caught a glimpse of his dad&#39;s chest, and saw a new pair of breasts. Mike&#39;s hair also recovered its color, gained silkiness and length. Any trace of hair in his face disappeared, as it got more feminine and smaller.<br />
<br />
Mike&#39;s arms toned up, but that was the only thing that Jeff could easily see. Due to his clothes, the rest of the changes were difficult to see. His entire legs got muscular, especially his calves and thighs, his butt gained roundness and firmness, and a nice pair of abs formed on his body.<br />
<br />
The last thing to change was Mike&#39;s crotch. His penis retracted along with his testicles, and, although Jeff couldn&#39;t see this change either, he noticed something was happening due to his father&#39;s reaction: a contained moan.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that Dad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing&quot; said Mike, trying to dissimulate. A doubt came to his mind &quot;Did Jeff just call me Dad?&quot;. Once his dick disappeared, a vagina formed in his crotch, complete with new ovaries. The idea that Jeff was his... HER son vanished. How could that be? He was her boyfriend.<br />
<br />
Mike was no more, and in the couch was now Michelle, a sporty gal, that attends the same high school as Jeff, or at least that is what she thinks. Because the reality changes were turned off, that was only an illusion in her mind, and there was no student called Michelle Reed at Jeff&#39;s school.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked at the portable emitter and saw the timer hit zero. &quot;That&#39;s it!?&quot; he thought, frustrated because he couldn&#39;t see most of the changes take place. &quot;Guess next time I&#39;ll transform a naked person.&quot; Another timer appeared on a smaller window, this was set to 12 hours, and it said &quot;Time until subject goes back to normal&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jeff was sitting on a separate chair from Michelle, which seemed strange because as a couple they&#39;re supposed to be snuggling or something. &quot;Jeff why are you sitting there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do YOU mean? You said you came to watch the game with me, so sit next to me and show some love to your girlfriend.&quot; Jeff blushed a little after listening this request, he still couldn&#39;t believe that he got a new girlfriend that originally was his dad.<br />
<br />
Jeff sat right next to Michelle and she patted her lap, signaling Jeff to lay down on it. Jeff slowly accommodated his body and put his head on Michelle&#39;s lap. Jeff could feel the muscle in her thighs. At the moment, Jeff completely forgot that minutes ago this was his father, all that mattered right now was his new girlfriend.</p>
