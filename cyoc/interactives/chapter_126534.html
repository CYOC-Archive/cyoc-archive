<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;How would that even work?&quot; Anne asked.  &quot;Some sort of &#39;Freaky Friday&#39; where we&#39;d wake up in eachother&#39;s bodies?&quot;  She smiled at me, slipping a loose strand of hair behind her ear.  Having a sexy older woman smiling at me wearing only a shirt, my shirt, certainly wasn&#39;t deflating my boner any.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, Ida know.&quot; I stammered.  &quot;Maybe we&#39;d just start dating?  Or something.&quot;  I could feel myself blushing furiously. I remembered the ring and wished my erection to go away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you can start by walking me to my car.  Your shirt is a big improvement over being naked, but I&#39;d still get in trouble if the cops showed up.&quot;  Ms. Robertson grabbed my hand, raised her chin and started walking back the way she&#39;d come as if a woman wearing nothing but a shirt as she walked down the street was perfectly ordinary.  I was relieved my last wish had worked, or the pace she set would have been torture. <br />
<br />
We got a fair number of looks, Anne mostly with her long tanned legs and bare feet.  She and Katie had a heated pool in their backyard and Anne swam year-round.  Katie mostly just sunbathed or splashed around with her friends.  I&#39;d admired Anne&#39;s physique when she swam, much to Katie&#39;s displeasure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leg man, are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Anne&#39;s question made me realize I&#39;d been staring at those notables as we walked.  I straightened up and looked straight ahead.  She was still holding my hand so I couldn&#39;t step away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, no!&quot;  I felt my blush return. &quot;Kinda.  I mean, you&#39;ve got really great legs!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, thanks Joe!&quot;  She leaned over and gave me a peck on the cheek.  <br />
<br />
To say I was confused would have been the understatement of the century.  I flicked a glance over and Anne was smiling, practically skipping!  What the hell?!  We turned off the sidewalk and I spotted Anne&#39;s car, a dark green Prius.  She&#39;d let Katie borrow it a couple times when we were going out and my car was in the shop.  Anne popped the trunk and pulled out a gym bag.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Joe, you keep watch while I get dressed.  No peeking!&quot;  She flashed me a smile and leaned in to give me another peck on the cheek before she slipped into the backseat of her car.  I was distracted, but not by the kiss; when Anne had leaned over to kiss me she&#39;d rubbed her breasts against my chest. Not just pressed or brushed, there had been definite deliberate contact going on there.<br />
<br />
Katie isn&#39;t as tall as her mom, yet, and that annoys her, but her mom is stacked, and Katie&#39;s boobs are on the small side of C cups.  Anne had come out to swim laps in a bikini one of the first times Katie had me over, and she threw a fit when she saw me looking at her.  After that Anne always wore a full body suit.  Not like a wet-suit, but like you&#39;d see competitive swimmers wear.  It flattened and constrained her bust, which was a shame, lord knows I&#39;d stolen enough glances.<br />
<br />
The Prius shook a bit, and I resisted the urge to look, barely.  It began to dawn on me the reason Katie and I weren&#39;t such a hot thing anymore was probably because she&#39;d caught me eyeing her mom and didn&#39;t appreciate the competition.<br />
<br />
The car door popped open and I stepped over, offering Anne a hand to help her out of the car.  She had on some running shoes, Capri-length jogging pants, and a stretchy red top.  I could tell it was stretchy because it was molded to the curves of her ample breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Such a gentleman!&quot; Anne proclaimed.<br />
<br />
I glanced up from her mesmerizing chest, half-expecting, half hoping for another peck.  Anne was giving me a mischievous look.  She leaned back against her car, raising one knee to brace her foot against the paneling, and pulling her elbows back to rest on the roof.  Katie at her most flirtatious had never looked so sexy.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how do I look?&quot;  Anne turned her head to the side and stuck her chest out a bit more.  The material wasn&#39;t sheer, but it was certainly thin enough that there was no question Anne didn&#39;t have anything on under the bright red top.  I managed not to drool or stare too long before I put my fingers to my mouth and gave her a piercing wolf whistle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha!&quot; Anne laughed out loud and gave me a wink as she turned and reached into the car.  She bent over at the waist, the jogging pants pulling tight on her well-toned swimmer&#39;s ass.  I swallowed, running my gaze up and down those long, long legs of hers.  She straightened up holding my shirt and stepped over to me.  I was leaning against the car next to hers, literally stunned by what she&#39;d done.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for the loan,&quot; she said softly, &quot;and for being my knight in shining armor.&quot;  Anne was taller than me, but somehow managed to look at me through her eyelashes.  She was holding my shirt with both hands, her shoulders rounded as she leaned over.  The neck of her top gaped but her eyes were captivating.  &quot;If you meant what you said earlier, about dating me?  I&#39;d like that very much.&quot;<br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t have time to respond before she pinned me against the car as she kissed me, full on the lips.  I put my arms around her, pulling her close and moaning gently.  Her body was soft and warm where it pressed against me.  My erection returned full force and Anne was not shy about grinding her hips against it and me.  Her tongue brushed my lips, I let my mouth open and she enthusiastically French kissed me.  We were both moaning at that point, and I let my hands slide down to her ass, squeezing ecstatically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm, I&#39;m taking that as a yes.&quot; She said after our lips finally parted.<br />
<br />
I was panting, and she was still pressed against me.  I&#39;d had the presence of mind to slide my hands up to her back as the kiss ended.  Anne didn&#39;t seem in any hurry to get away.  Katie always seemed embarrassed after a make-out session, as if she&#39;d only been doing it because I wanted to.  Anne was watching me closely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I, date, um.&quot; I stopped speaking, realizing how incoherent I sounded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Anne drawled, &quot;we can&#39;t stay in this parking lot forever,&quot; she twitched her hips against my still erect boner, &quot;much as I&#39;d like to.&quot;  She pursed her lips.  &quot;Where would you like to go, Joe?&quot;</p>
