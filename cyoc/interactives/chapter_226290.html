<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He awoke in the morning and got dressed. He made his way to the kitchen, where his father David was making breakfast. The smell of food made his mouth water and his stomach growl.<br />
&quot;Good morning, son,&quot; David said.<br />
&quot;Good morning, dad,&quot; Jeff said. &quot;I&#39;m starving.&quot;<br />
&quot;I can tell,&quot; David said. &quot;Have a seat.&quot;<br />
Jeff sat down at the table, and his father placed a massive plate of food in front of him.<br />
&quot;Enjoy,&quot; David said.<br />
&quot;Thanks, dad,&quot; Jeff said. <br />
The muscle-bound giant started eating his breakfast, shoveling food into his mouth with a ferocity that would have made any normal person recoil in horror. But, the two giants were used to it. They had seen Jeff devour countless pounds of food, and had always admired his seemingly bottomless pit of a stomach.<br />
Jeff ate and ate and ate. He kept eating until there was nothing left on the table. Then, he licked the last bits of food off his plate.<br />
&quot;That was delicious,&quot; Jeff said.<br />
&quot;You sure eat a lot,&quot; David said.<br />
&quot;I guess,&quot; Jeff said. He was so happy to feel himself bigger than anyone, muscle beast. The biggest muscle beast.<br />
David laughed.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to work,&quot; he said.<br />
&quot;Ok,&quot; Jeff said.<br />
With that his father left him alone. Jeff wanted to go to the gym, so he got his bag and made his way there.<br />
On the way he met his best friend.<br />
&quot;Hi, Jeff!&quot; he said.<br />
&quot;Hello, Mike,&quot; Jeff replied.<br />
Mike was &quot;just&quot; 8&#39;8 tall and 1000lbs with an amazing set of muscles. The two muscle monsters were walking to the gym, and chatting. They were discussing the latest news in the fitness world. Mike asked Jeff about the closest competition.<br />
&quot;Next one is in 3 weeks&quot; the giant answered.<br />
&quot;So soon?&quot; Mike was shocked.<br />
&quot;Yes, so we need to train hard,&quot; Jeff said.<br />
&quot;I know, I want to be in your division one day&quot; Mike complained about his size.<br />
&quot;You need to eat more, my friend&quot; Jeff tried to support him.<br />
&quot;So, how are you going to beat Alex?&quot; the giant asked.<br />
&quot;I have some plans,&quot; Jeff felt worried that he didn&#39;t remember any Alex. Just misty thoughts but they were to uncertain. &quot;Do you know his current state?&quot; Jeff asked.<br />
&quot;Last week he was 11&#39;9 and 1800lbs, 4% bf&quot; Mike knew the answer according to his official instagram.<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Jeff was shocked. He was 11&#39;2 and 1400-ish lbs. He remembered that Chronivac could affect the results, but this was to much. He changed the whole world.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong, bro?&quot; Mike noticed his concern.<br />
&quot;Nothing, just thinking&quot; Jeff answered.<br />
&quot;Ok, but if something is happening you can tell me&quot; Mike offered his help.<br />
&quot;Thanks&quot; Jeff smiled and the two muscle giants continued their way to the gym.<br />
&quot;Do you want to go to the sauna after training?&quot; Jeff asked.<br />
&quot;Sure, bro,&quot; Mike said.<br />
They entered the gym. Jeff needed a plan how to increase his size. Noone could be larger than him. It just wasn&#39;t fair!<br />
They changed their clothes and started to train. They did bench press, and Jeff was benching 1700 lbs. He asked Mike to add another 200 lbs and the his friend did. &quot;A bit more than your standard max, hah?&quot; he asked Jeff. &quot;Are you from the moon, I&#39;m just warming up&quot; Jeff answered. <br />
&quot;Sure big guy, sorry&quot; Mike said. <br />
Jeff felt that the wight was becoming lighter and lighter. And when the barbell was touching his chest, he put it on the rack.<br />
&quot;Your turn&quot; he said.<br />
Jeff&#39;s pecs were ripped, his abs were defined and his ass was firm and round. Than he was able to hear a strange sound with a source between the huge stone pillows he called his chest. It was a sound of fricion, his chest started to block his view a bit.<br />
The next exercise was squating. Jeff again told the number of his max weight just for warming up. He felt that his legs and ass were getting rounder and thicker. There was no space for his cock and balls, so they changed their position to be in his front. Jeff needed even to change his way of walking to adjust this new situation. Than it was shoulder pressing. His wide frame added a feet just to be capable to allow all desired muscled be there. The last two exercises were back and abs. He did pull-ups with additional 1900lbs again, &quot;just for warming up&quot;. His lats and traps were swelling till they ripped the tank top. Jeff didn&#39;t want to change it and continued to workout shirtless. For his abs exercise he chose a russian twists with additional 1000lbs as his &quot;usual weight&quot;. He saw that the stone brick wall on his belly became a bit wider and harder. With the last squize it added on row of new titles.<br />
Than, they was in the sauna. He was feeling hot and horny. Mike was there too.<br />
&quot;Do you want to have a little fun, bro?&quot; Jeff asked.<br />
&quot;Sure, bro,&quot; Mike said.<br />
Mike reached Jeff and the two muscle monsters began to kiss passionately. Jeff&#39;s cock was throbbing and his balls were heavy with cum. Mike&#39;s cock was hard and ready.<br />
&quot;Take me, big guy,&quot; Mike said.<br />
Jeff took his friend&#39;s big ass and slowly penetrated him. The two muscle monsters moaned in pleasure.<br />
&quot;You are so tight,&quot; Jeff said.<br />
&quot;Fuck me, harder&quot; Mike said.<br />
Jeff was thrusting into Mike&#39;s tight hole, his huge cock stretching the his friend&#39;s ass.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to cum,&quot; Jeff said.<br />
&quot;Me too, bro,&quot; Mike said.<br />
When Jeff came they left the sauna and headed for the showers. They helped to clean each other and in the changing room Jeff wanted to understand his weight. He stepped on the scale and was shocked to see that he weighed just over 1800lbs. He also noticed that with all these muscles he started to lose his ability to move. He was not happy about it at all. When they went to the car Jeff&#39;s legs were rounding one over another and sometimes his nutsuck were between them and did pain. Jeff came over his car and tried to unlock it, but the he wasn&#39;t able to put the key into a keyhole. His huge chest didn&#39;t allow him to do that. <br />
Mike noticed it and helped his friend.<br />
&quot;Thank you, bro,&quot; Jeff said.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome, big guy,&quot; Mike said.<br />
&quot;You are so short, Mike&quot; said Jeff.<br />
&quot;Yes, and you are so huge, Jeff&quot; said Mike.<br />
Mike was so far from thinking so Chronivac supposed it as new reality. Jeff felt that he became taller. His muscles didn&#39;t grow so he achieved more mobility than before.<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s go home,&quot; Jeff said and tried to fit into his chair. But now he figured out that he was too huge for it. <br />
He had no choice than continue to play with Chronivac, which was too dummy for his will.  He asked Mike &quot;What do you think about my new car? Does it match my size, init?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah, bro,&quot; Mike said.<br />
&quot;And what about the color?&quot; Jeff asked.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s perfect, bro,&quot; Mike said.<br />
&quot;But, do you think it is too small for me?&quot; the giant asked.<br />
&quot;No, it&#39;s perfect,&quot; Mike said.<br />
&quot;Yeah, right,&quot; Jeff said.<br />
The car started to get wider, transforming in something which is able to be capable to contain such giant as Jeff was. <br />
Jeff drove Mike to his home and than went to his own. His stomach was empty and made deep groarring sounds. <br />
Jeff was thinking about his dinner when he entered the house and saw Chris.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m starving, Dad&quot; Jeff said.<br />
&quot;You are always starving,&quot; Chris was smiling.<br />
&quot;Yeah, but this time I&#39;m really hungry,&quot; Jeff said.<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s see what we can do about that,&quot; Chris said.<br />
The musclebound giant went into the kitchen and pulled out a huge pot of his signature beef stew. It was a massive amount of meat and vegetables in a thick, rich gravy.<br />
Jeff ate and ate and ate. When he finished the pot was nearly empty, just a gallon or two. David was back from his job and joined Chris and Jeff for a dinner. <br />
&quot;Sorry for being late. My work... you know.... Ehmmmm&quot; his voice was trembling, he felt unconfident because of the last talk with his father about his family. &quot;Jeff, I know your competition will be soon. Don&#39;t you think it is good idea to participate, when you.. hmmm.. not big and strong as other participants ?&quot;<br />
&quot;What do you mean? I&#39;m the biggest, I&#39;m huger than Alex, the one who was able do defeat me!&quot; Jeff was shocked with his father&#39;s statement.<br />
&quot;Ehmm... may be I read wrong, but they are thinking to make additional part for people whom larger than 2k lbs. I&#39;m not sure, but you don&#39;t and if they didn&#39;t do it you&#39;ve been out of ten&quot;<br />
Jeff was so shocked that he didn&#39;t finish his dinner and went to his room. He opened Chronivac and found out that the world changed more than he expected. There were giants 18 feet high and more than even 2500 pounds. &quot;So, the world was changed a lot, and I would change it once more.&quot; was his thought</p>
