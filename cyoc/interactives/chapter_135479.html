<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tom had a pretty good idea on what Alice wanted as he entered the bedroom they now shared. The lights were rather low and the curtains were drawn over the windows so that no one outside the building could see in, at least not in any way that would be definitive. If anyone from a nearby building or decided to climb the fire escape climbed up to look in, at best all they&#39;d see was an outline, which could be described off as a costume. The lying wasn&#39;t something that Tom liked, and he was privately sure it wouldn&#39;t protect weres in the long term. There&#39;d already been more then enough close calls that could have had disastrous consequences for weres.<br />
<br />
And that was why Tom favored coming out and coming out now while there was some possibility of having control over the reveal and while there was at least a decent political chance of enabling weres to be accepted as far as the law was concerned. He could not guarantee complete acceptance, but he also knew that if weres waited until an accident happened, regardless of its cause, the results of an accident would potentially be worse than a controlled narrative.<br />
<br />
But that wasn&#39;t likely on Alice&#39;s mind as she lay across the bed in her fursona and with her tail slowly swaying behind her. She was also propped up on her arms with her impressive breasts hanging beneath her and with her nipples erect and poking through the white fur that was there. It served to get a small smile out of Tom as well as a rise out of his penis, which was visibly beginning to tent his pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see you&#39;ve been excitedly waiting for me,&quot; Tom commented as he raised one leg to begin untying his shoes. He had to hop a little bit to undo the shoelaces, but Tom generally kept his balance and only watched as Alice smiled back to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I was,&quot; Alice smiled as she rolled on the bed, being sure to give Tom a full and open view or her furry body, &quot;You are my bonded mate... and I&#39;ve told you that I felt that bond even forming before we were ever together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seems something of a miracle that one as wonderful as you would want someone like me,&quot; Tom answered as he got his shoes off and then turned to his socks. He could now more clearly smell Alice&#39;s own arousal which only served to make the tent in his pants bigger. He could feel his penis straining against his underwear.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re wonderful too,&quot; Alice answered as she stood up and approached Tom, slowly running her paw-like hands down the front of Tom&#39;s shirt.<br />
<br />
Werefoxes weren&#39;t known for being overly muscular. That was something that was more seen in the larger weres, weres that were based off of animals that were strong to hung large prey or to fight off large predators. However, werefoxes could be very well toned for their size. It was something that helped male werefoxes pull off a male-model look very well. They weren&#39;t bulky, but what they had was well toned and sculpted, and even through his shirt, Alice could feel that muscle tone on Tom&#39;s body, which excited her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re smart and clever,&quot; Alice commented as her hands drifted down to Tom&#39;s belt, &quot;and that&#39;s just one of the things that I love about you.&quot;<br />
<br />
And she knew he was smart. She&#39;d had her fair share of dates in the past, but a fair number of men spent the date staring down at her F cup chest, which as a werefox vixen, Alice should expect, as that sort of response was something she&#39;d even seen in male weres while growing up in Moon Lake, but that didn&#39;t mean that that was something she wanted a lasting relationship built off of. Tom wasn&#39;t like that. He noticed, obviously, but her chest wasn&#39;t the only thing he focused on, and he&#39;d even say that there had been something about her that seemed to touch him in a way that he generally didn&#39;t tell anyone else. The biggest thing that Alice felt showed Tom&#39;s intelligence in his plan for the big reveal that weres existed.<br />
<br />
Like many other weres, she had the fear that discovery would lead to all sorts of trials and tribulations that wouldn&#39;t be good, at least not immediately so. And having grown up in Moon Lake, she defended those points when she first told Tom about weres and how she was one, but Tom ultimately did raise some good points and he made sense with how he argued them. In this, something told her that a good part of his plan could and would work. She only got further confirmation of that with a prophecy dream that had him ultimately becoming America&#39;s first were President following the 2020 elections. Which, if it was true, would mean that while there might be some difficulty from 2015 to 2020, it wouldn&#39;t be the nightmare that many weres thought it would be. And with that sort of confidence in mind, she hadn&#39;t gone to the Moon Lake City Council meeting. Part of that was that as a Seattle resident, Moon Lake&#39;s local decisions didn&#39;t effect her all that much and the rest was in the assurance that not only would Tom succeed but succeed in a way that no one likely thought possible right now.<br />
<br />
&quot;One of the things?&quot; Tom asked her with a small smirk as she pulled down his pants and underwear letting his erection stand freely in the dim light of their bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;This would be another thing,&quot; Alice said with a smile as she stood up and reached down with one hand to wiggle Tom&#39;s erect shaft softly, making him take a deep breath in as she did so, &quot;and I&#39;ve had some idea that you&#39;d succeed... so... why not celebrate?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom smiled as he stepped out of his pants toward his fiancé and began to take off his shirt, which was soon tossed on the floor. Even if they weren&#39;t celebrating the success in his plan to get a discussion going to reveal were existence and let all were-society evolve and contribute in a way that they could show how good they were, he would be more than eager to &quot;celebrate&quot; with Alice. She was beautiful, kind, and provided an emotional bond that in a way made Tom feel far more comfortable with than he&#39;d ever felt with anyone before. He&#39;d had a few past relationships, but nothing really materialized out of them, but with Alice, there seemed to be so much more, and after his transformation into a werefox, he could feel the same bond that she felt. It was warm and inviting, as though her happiness gave his subconscious feelings of pure joy. It was a mental feeling that he couldn&#39;t describe in a literal sense, but he knew it would be as long as they lived.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... why not celebrate?&quot; Tom smiled back to her and wrapped his arms around her and pulling her in for a passionate kiss, mouth to muzzle.<br />
<br />
Alice eagerly returned the kiss. It was a bit awkward, as fox&#39;s narrow muzzle wasn&#39;t designed for kissing, but that was something that weres had managed to adapt to for years and it didn&#39;t get in the way of love, and the love was what she was after. She felt Tom&#39;s hands drift down her furry sides, softly massaging her so that her wasn&#39;t out of place. They passed onto her butt and then the base of her tail before drifting further down to the ack of her inner thighs, then around the outside of her legs, to the front of her inner thighs. And as Tom&#39;s hand&#39;s reached the juncture between her legs Alice gave a heavily aroused moan. She could also feel the presence of Tom&#39;s claws starting to comb her fur. Tom was transforming, which made her happy as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I think you&#39;re ready,&quot; Tom said with a smile as his eyes shifted into a bright crimson and his pupils pulling into a fox&#39;s vertical slit.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am,&quot; Alice moaned back, &quot;I&#39;ve been fantasizing all the fun that we would have in celebration for first steps and our bonded love all evening... with each one being better than the last.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice then pressed herself against him and licked at his cheeks as she saw red orange fur grow across his body, with only white fur forming on is upper lip and running to his nose while also covering his lower jaw and his neck and chest and running down to his wonderfully erect penis, which as Alice looked down to it was swelling a bit larger as Tom transformed. Black fur grew out on his hands, forearms, and feet, forming the sort of &quot;gloves&quot; and &quot;socks&quot; that the Red Fox was typically known for, and he could see them as he guided Alice back toward their bed. Out of the corner of his eye he noted that the alarm was on for the following morning, but that wasn&#39;t the issue he focused on. His focus was on the beautiful werefox vixen before him, who had opened so many doors for him and who loved him very much.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you, Alice Stevens,&quot; Tom spoke as he felt his feet lengthen into digitigrade paws. He gained a bit of height, but not too terribly much. And as his brush like tail grew out behind him, he slowly and easily eased himself into his fiancée. &quot;I love you so much.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice gave a heavy and husky moan as she watched Tom&#39;s ears shift into triangular points that poked out through his hair and completed his transition into his werefox form. He looked dashing and handsome in it, and the pleasure she felt in her clit with his large penis stretching her inner walls was divine. She quickly thrust her hips forward, to get all of him into her, though for the moment the knot at the base of his penis didn&#39;t enter her... but that&#39;d change as they continued... and gave a few yipping moans as she did so.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I love you tttoooooooooooooooo, Tom Herald,&quot; Alice moaned back as both of them began to pick up their rhythm together, before giving several pleasure filled yips as Tom bent down to softly nibble at her erect nipples.</p>
