<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While others, were and normal alike, had a more standard afternoon and evening in Moon Lake, getting home from work and kicking back and relaxing over dinner, among other things; it was a totally different story at the Stovall residence.<br />
Brett Smithson had been there for hours, explaining the ins and outs of what to expect over the next day or two before the Elders&#39; Council as they heard and decided on Julie Stovall&#39;s Statute 1-A charges.*<br />
&quot;I know it&#39;s getting late, and I do thank you for all you&#39;ve done on behalf of our daughter, but are you sure there is absolutely no other way to go about this?&quot; asked Martin Stovall.<br />
Brett sighed as she looked at the concerned parents. &quot;I truly wish there was, but if there is, I haven&#39;t figured it out yet,&quot; she confessed. &quot;Statute 1-A, as it&#39;s written, automatically presumes the accused were was successful in transforming the normal. Since Eric Anderson is a happy werepanther who became one voluntarily instead of a were-merman—&quot;<br />
&quot;He should of been mine!&quot; muttered Julie under her breath.<br />
&quot;Even if Julie did attempt to do what she is accused of,&quot; continued the lawyer, ignoring that remark despite her acute were hearing, &quot;then obviously Julie wasn&#39;t successful. Therefore, the first thing I&#39;ll try to do is plead and/or argue before the Elders that there needs to be a lesser charge established than Statute 1-A, although technically Moon Lake doesn&#39;t have such a law yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what would that accomplish again?&quot; asked Melissa, for it had been awhile since they last discussed this point. There had been much discussion about everything; including Julie&#39;s appearance, attitude, conduct, and wardrobe in court before the Elders. The accused was to dress plainly to and from the Elders&#39; building, but would be wearing only a robe like everyone else while in her were form before the Council. In this case, Stage 2 at most so she could still have full mobility out of water, but Julie was to keep her robe closed for modesty&#39;s appearance.<br />
&quot;If we can get them to establish a lesser charge, say... Statute 1-B for lack of a better name, then the less severe charge should have a less severe sentence if Julie&#39;s found guilty,&quot; pointed out Brett.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m <b>not</b> doing any jail time!&quot; protested Julie. &quot;That cell they stuck me in while I was being processed before they released me with that stupid ankle monitor was bad enough!&quot;<br />
&quot;Julie, I&#39;ve explained this several times already, but apparently the severity of what lies before you still hasn&#39;t sunk in,&quot; realized her defense attorney. &quot;Even if I can get the Elders&#39; Council to establish a lesser charge, the evidence against you is pretty steep as it is.&quot;<br />
&quot;What evidence?&quot; Julie snapped back. &quot;The lies of people I thought were my friends like Eric and Frieda?&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you calling the teachers who witnessed your altercation in the school cafeteria during Freshmen lunch liars? Are you claiming the video tape of you attempting to molest Eric Anderson at Moon Lake High&#39;s bus stop after school let out was fake? Are you going to call your own parents liars too? Because they heard the death threat you gave William and Martha Anderson about their son Eric as you were being taken to jail, along with the Sheriff, his deputy, AND the school principal,&quot; explained Brett Smithson. &quot;The odds are stacked against you and you have no one to blame but yourself young lady.&quot;<br />
&quot;HEY! You&#39;re supposed to be on my side!&quot; complained Julie, as she stood up and yelled at her defense attorney.<br />
<br />
&quot;She is. Now sit down and shut up!&quot; yelled her father in return.<br />
&quot;Definitely a trying time,&quot; said Melissa Stovall, rubbing her stomach, trying to comfort herself and the new life growing within it; as Julie reluctantly complied with the order.<br />
&quot;Believe it or not, I am,&quot; said Smithson calmly, her gaze never leaving that of the young, troubled were-mermaid. &quot;But even if I hadn&#39;t of discovered that technicality that got all the other charges against you dropped, the judge would still have deferred the Statute 1-A accusations to the Elders&#39; Council anyway. So we&#39;d still be right where we are right now, but probably with you facing a stiff jail sentence for the other stuff too.&quot;<br />
Julie looked like she was about to say something, but decided to remain silent as the lawyer&#39;s words sank in.<br />
&quot;That reminds me. What about the new accusations of Julie phishing online in hopes of gathering information to intimidate witnesses against her?&quot; asked Melissa.<br />
&quot;Far as I know, the Sheriff and the DA&#39;s office is still looking into that. No formal charges have been filed yet, but if they are, those would be in a normal court anyway, regardless of the results of the Elders&#39; Council hearing,&quot; explained Smithson.<br />
Then the defense lawyer glanced at her wristwatch. &quot;Okay. We&#39;ve been at this for quite a while now, and I want Julie at the Elders&#39; Council building by 9 in case there have been any new developments overnight and to have a last minute review with her before the trial starts at 10.&quot;<br />
&quot;What about the werefoxes outside? Can&#39;t you do anything about them?&quot; asked Julie, as her lawyer got up and prepared to leave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tachibana Security representatives?&quot; Smithson asked in return. &quot;I checked the scroll they gave your father. They&#39;re within their legal rights, doing what they were told to do by the Council. So you have an escort whether you like it or not,&quot; she added, throwing her coat on.<br />
<i>Nosy bodyguards is more like it,</i> thought Julie. <i>No way I&#39;m gonna sneak out of here and start heading to freedom in the Tropics with them around,</i> she silently bitched.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll see you out,&quot; Martin Stovall said, walking the lawyer to the front door.<br />
&quot;Julie,&quot; began her mother.<br />
&quot;I know. <i>Go to your room!</i> NIGHT!&quot; said Julie sarcastically, before running up the stairs.<br />
<br />
AT THE FRONT DOOR...<br />
&quot;Andrew Curtis <i>really</i> wants you to take his place on the Elders&#39; Council?&quot; asked Smithson.<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; he confirmed. &quot;After the current matters with Benton Knight are resolved, which would make it sometime late next month at the earliest. Between that and the seriousness of having a were accused of violating Statute 1-A, that&#39;s why the Elders are pushing for a speedy trial on Julie&#39;s case.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s still majority opinion rule when it comes time to vote on guilt or innocence, but maybe we&#39;ll get lucky and Curtis will decline to vote on the matter, which would be one less voice against your daughter.&quot;<br />
&quot;Listen, about that. The more I see of Julie since this whole mess started, the more I realize how little I truly know my daughter. I know you have a job to do, but neither Melissa or I want Julie to go unpunished from this,&quot; said Martin as his wife approached. &quot;Actions have consequences, especially bad ones, as I&#39;ve learned first hand,&quot; he added, lovingly putting an arm around Melissa. &quot;My own private past hasn&#39;t been all that great, but Melissa and I are working it out to save our marriage because we still love each other. Yet I certainly don&#39;t want Julie swimming either away scott free or down the same path I did,&quot; referring to the many infidelities of cheating he did against Melissa.<br />
&quot;I know. That alternate plan you told me about while Julie was still outside swimming this afternoon is a good one,&quot; said Smithson, referring to the Stovalls sending their daughter away to a strict disciplinarian school for weres. &quot;But we&#39;ll have to see how things turn out with the Elders&#39; Council first. Besides, the way she&#39;s behaving, maybe we should have Julie tested for any potential mental disorders. In any event, I&#39;ll see you in the morning,&quot; promised the lawyer, before leaving. &quot;You two try to get a good night&#39;s sleep.&quot;<br />
With that, Smithson walked out to her car and let it warm up for the drive home.<br />
&quot;Oh Martin,&quot; said Melissa, leaning against her husband as she began to cry after the door was closed. &quot;Where did we go wrong?&quot;<br />
&quot;We didn&#39;t. I did,&quot; said her husband, trying to console her, &quot;and no matter what happens, I&#39;m going to spend the rest of my life trying to make this up to you,&quot; he promised, holding her close.<br />
