<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a minute of thinking what to do next, Jakes cellphone rang. It was Nate. Jake started to answer. ”What’s up Nate?” While on the phone, Jake could make out yelling in the background. “Hey Jake. I was just calling to tell you I’m not gonna be back for at least an hour or two. I should have listened. Rush hour in Denver is awful.” Jake chuckled into the phone. Nate was with his class on a feild trip to Coors Feild to watch the first MLB game of the season. “I should know. I lived there for a few years.” Nate sighed. “Right... Rockies won, so at least I got that going for me. anyway, just wanted to update you in case you had any plans, cause this trip had worn me out.”<br />
<br />
Jake was slightly disappointed. He wouldn’t be able to show Nate his new tail for a while. Which reminded him that he should turn off awareness for Nate sometimes today. But no matter. He had other experiments in mind. “It’s fine. I was heading out with some friends anyway. By the way, you might be shocked once you get back to see me. I made a slight... change.” He didn’t wat to outright tell Nate just yet. He wanted to be cryptic with his wording about what he wanted to show. This mad Jake feel giddy as he saw the tip of his tail twitching slightly.<br />
<br />
“Uh... yeah sure. Anyway, I’ll talk to ya when I get back.” And with that, Nate hug up. A thought came to Jake’s mind. He should give Nate a tail while he’s getting home to surprise him a bit more. He brought the laptop back out of his bag. The program was still running, and he was still on custom change. Jake saved his change just in case he wanted to change the tail he had (cause there was no way he was getting rid of that) or anything else to him. He typed Nates full name in and made a profile for him. He decided to give Nate a monkey tail. He didn’t want Nate to be too uncomfortable on the way home if he chose something too big. The hit the boxes in the following:<br />
<br />
Self aware: no (he would change that later)<br />
<br />
Bystander aware: no (except for Jake)<br />
<br />
Pleasure: no (don’t want any accidents on the road)<br />
<br />
Timer: 2:00:00 (just in case he could see the growth when he got home.<br />
<br />
With everything put to his liking, he hit enter, and a progress bar showed up. Jake decided to tab the bar to the side so he could work on other subjects. He also remembered to add Nate to the bystander knowledge list for Jakes tail. With that done, Jake headed out of his dorm.<br />
<br />
In the hallway, Jake was a bit surprised that no one took notice of his huge tail. Or maybe the did, but just didn’t care. It was all normal to them. Jake wanted to start his tail spree in campus with someone special. He made his way to his girlfriend, Luna’s dorm. He knew exactly what he wanted to do for her. Outside her dorm room while his laptop was still out, he added Luna to the bystander awareness list. He was a bit nervous upon how she would react, but figured it would be worth it to see her surprised face.<br />
<br />
Knocking on the door, while keeping his legs closed to hid his tail, Luna answered the door. “Hi sweetie. This is a surprise visit.” She said. Oh you’ll be surprised alright, Jake thought. “Is it cool if I hang out with you awhile? Nate got stuck in big city traffic and wouldn’t be here for another few hours.” “Sure, come on in. I’ll be in the bathroom for a minute to freshen up.” Perfect. Jakes opportunity was set up. As she left to the bathroom, Jake got on his laptop again and entered Luna’s profile. He decided to give Luna an otters tail. He didn’t want it to be to short, so he put in a custom length of 3ft 6in.<br />
<br />
Self aware: yes<br />
<br />
Bystander aware: no (except Jake)<br />
<br />
Pleasure: yes<br />
<br />
Timer: 00:45<br />
<br />
Jake looked over everything but didn’t press enter yet. He wanted to see Luna’s face when his tail came into view. With that thought, he heard Luna emerge from the bathroom. “Alright. So what did you want to... what is that?” Jakes heart started racing. She discovered his tail. “Is that suppose to be a-“ “Kangaroo tail? Yep.” Jake interrupted. “Are you going to an animal themed party or something?” “Not exactly. It’s kind of... attached to me.” Luna started to look worried. Jake turned around to show that the tail, in fact, was attached. He even wiggled it around showing he could control it. Luna’s jaw dropped. “Wait! Just... How? You can’t just...” Now was Jake’s moment. He pressed enter. “Yeah. It’s very real. Just as yours will be.” <br />
<br />
“Huh?” Was the last thing that came out of Luna’s mouth before she jolted. She had felt something in her lower back. She lifted her tank top to se a bump protruding. “Wha... Ohhh...” Luna reached down to feel it. Her body shaking all over when the sensation first landed. Jake wasn’t gonna mis a thing. He stood close behind Luna to see the lump grow into a beautiful tail. Once the tail was about 2 ft, Jake started feeling it for himself. “Ahh...” Luna had fallen on her hands and knees. Excitement rushed through her as her boyfriend stroked her sensitive new appendage. As he was rubbing hers, Jake was doing the same with his tail, rubbing it at the base. Both of them moaned in absolute pleasure of their new parts. Both Jake and Luna could feel short hairs sprout. Slowing growing water tight fur that was the same as her hair color.<br />
The progress bar reached 99% and just like Jakes, that one percent shot Luna’s tail out another foot. She, as was Jake, was lying on the floor panting.<br />
<br />
Transformation complete displayed on the screen.<br />
<br />
Jake looked at Luna, face down on the floor, admiring her tail. Not quite as log as Jakes, but larger than an average otter. A few seconds have passed before Luna could finally speak. “Jake... did you do this?” Jake looked down at her, grinning. “Depends. Did you enjoy it?” Luna managed to get up with Jakes help. “That was the greatest feeling I have ever experienced!” She hugged him, and Jake hugged back. Luna eyed Jakes tail again and during the hug, started down his spine getting all the way to his tails thick base.”Oh... that feels good bebe.” And before they knew it, they started rubbing each others tails in unison.<br />
<br />
Finally Luna had gotten over her trance and started asking questions. “How exactly did you do this?” Jake at that point had to be completely honest. “It was all through this program on my computer. It can change anything imaginable.” “Your saying I got this...” she pats her tail. “from a computer program?” “It didn’t make sense to me either. But here we are, both tailed and happy.” Luna looked concerned however. “I am happy, but what will others think of us?” Jake closed his laptop. “That’s the beauty of it. No one does. This thing alters people’s minds to make them think we always been this way.” Luna was dumbfounded. A machine that could physically and mentally change people? This truly felt like science fiction. Since she wanted to major in writing, she thought something like this could make a great story.<br />
<br />
“I’m gonna do some more experimenting with this thing on campus. Wanna come?” Luna shook her head. “Can’t. Exam tomorrow so I gotta hit the books. Maybe later though.” Jake was a bit disappointed, but he’d get over it. There was always the weekend. “Alright then.” Jake kissed Luna on the cheek before leaving. “See ya tomorrow.” “Bye sweetie.” Luna said as Jake closed the door.<br />
<br />
So the night was still young and Jake wanted to keep trying new things.<br />
<br />
What to do next... He thought to himself.</p>
