<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(Hows THIS for an interactive chapter??  This one, is alllllllllllllll mine  :)  ~Jamie)<br />
<br />
    Jamie looked back at his legs when they formed into fins and at the rest of the huge guys.  All of them were fishpeople!  He felt like he was Tom Hanks on &quot;SPLASH!&quot; when at the end, he got to be a merman and swim away with Darryl Hannah.  Except his Darryl Hannah was Peter, Allen and Ty.<br />
<br />
    Ty was right though, and he DID save Jamie from using Peter and Allen like little toys, and he WAS rock hard.  This would prove the perfect distraction, and he was the first to dive underwater, the other fifteen feet mermen following right behind him.<br />
<br />
    Jamie swam way out away from land, and was surprised that he didn't choke and drown when he had to take a breath underwater.  He had gills as well, or some other kind of water filtration to his lungs.  That was awesome!  He looked back at the other guys as they were frolicking with one another as they chased him.<br />
<br />
    Ty and Peter were beating on one another and with each swing, their arms were getting longer, pushing each other away from the other.  Jamie figured this was probably because of Allen, because he was swimming behind the two cousins, with a big grin on his face.  That was until both of them turned around and slapped Allen at the same time, giving him a shell shock.<br />
<br />
    That didn't make Allen very happy and he growled at the two and reversed their long, rubbery arms, reducing them to little more than nubs sticking out of their shoulders.  &quot;That should teach you two!&quot;  Then Allen swam ahead of Ty and Peter, up toward Jamie, who had opened up a HUGE lead, and he was almost out of sight.<br />
<br />
    The two cousins returned their arms to the way they were and made Allen back to his normal six feet self, leaving them and Jamie the fifteen feet they were.  Allen slowly shrank, and freaked out, and shrank them too.  All of them were then their usual heights, except Jamie.<br />
<br />
    But all of them had to hurry, or Jamie would be gone forever.  So they raced to swim up to him.  And Jamie kept swimming lower and lower, staying right at the ocean's floor, and took every little valley he could.  They felt the heavy pressure bearing down on them as they went deeper and deeper into the dark depths of the ocean.  But still, they swam on.  They were nearly a mile below the surface of the water!  But if they did know that, they either didn't care, or they were too busy keeping up with the huge Jamie merman.  They finally decided as a group they would have to shrink him to his normal size too, or they wouldn't be able to keep up.<br />
<br />
    Jamie didn't even notice the change, as he swam on, deeper and farther, on some sort of vendetta or something.  When he got almost two miles underwater, he went into a huge cave, and the pressure almost instantly relieved itself which allowed them to swim better.  After several more minutes of swimming almost straight down, it suddenly began to get brighter and brighter.<br />
<br />
    Below them was some sort of light.  Jamie immediately thought of the water elemental in &quot;The Abyss&quot; and how it reacted to humans.  This seemed different to him, and that was just a movie after all.  Allen, Ty and Peter knew nothing of what Jamie was thinking, they just swam along behind him, taking it all in.  It was kinda freaky to be swimming in the middle of the ocean and underground at the same time!<br />
<br />
    As the light got brighter, it became obvious to the group that it wasn't coming from anywhere in particular, but instead from all around them, and was just growing in intensity, the deeper they went.  Once they was nearly fifty miles underwater, they could see pretty clearly, and they was slowly approaching a structure of some kind.<br />
<br />
    The closer they got, it became more and more obvious that they were coming up on some kind of bubble, and there were forms swimming around in them.  It was like a whole different world, underwater!  They swam right up to the bubbles, all as shocked as the other, and stunned by the beauty and the unlikeliness of what they were seeing.<br />
<br />
    They were greeted by other mermen, each carrying large tridents, and swam out to intercept them.  &quot;Cease your approach in these waters, Strangers!&quot;  They spoke and we understood them!  And they were also holding their weapons in attack positions.  Well they were too shocked to use their powers, they all stopped, and were escorted to the camps more like prisoners than guests.<br />
<br />
    Surprisingly, upon entering the bubbles, it was like a Gungan city on &quot;Star Wars&quot; than the fabled Atlantis...  But then, this was REAL!  The four were escorted among a myriad of merfolk and toward a large structure.<br />
<br />
Once inside the massive and remarkably beautiful structure, they were greeted by an old man on a dais.  &quot;Who are you, and why have you come here, Strangers?&quot;  This guy commanded, he did not speak.  He was a high authority here.  And there were several tridents held at the ready at the four boys heads, should they choose to answer incorrectly!</p>
