<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Just to make sure even original body parts aren´t a problem, Aidan, your nose will drop off.” Mark says with a small grin.<br />
“What? Why do you take my nose from me, Mark?” Aidan exclaimed, only for his voice to shift a bit. He sounded like his nose was plugged up, or as it was, missing. It really had slipped off his face, and Aidan had just enough reflexes to catch the dropping nose with his arms. He squeezed it lightly between his left arm and his right hoof, but had no reaction to it. “Weird. I know I just squeezed it, but I can´t feel it, even knowing it´s my nose. And I lost my sense of smell completely.”<br />
Mark nodded. “And there is just flat skin where your nose used to be, just like with the tail. No blood or anything. Now, part of the reason I wanted it to drop off is the following. Aidan, this cat´s tail will connect to the spot your nose had been before, while your nose will be in the former tails spot on your body.” Mark said, and laughed at Aidan´s face.<br />
Aidan saw the tail come flying towards him, hitting him right beneath his eyes where his nose had been. The second it connected, he remembered how to operate with it. Meanwhile his nose had slipped out of his arms and along his body until it was right above his ass, where it connected to his skin. Suddenly, Aidan could smell again, and grimaced at the smell of his own ass. While it was clean, it still wasn´t smelling any good. His tail swished before him, aggravated.<br />
“Mark, that´s disgusting. Why had it to be there you reconnect my nose? You asshole.” Aidan nearly screamed enraged. If he could, he would pummel Mark right now, being weaker then him being damned.<br />
Mark laughed again. “There are two reasons. One, as is quite obvious. I wanted to have a bit of fun from this. The way you looked was hilarious. The other is a following change I wanted to try with you. Aidan, your body odor will smell like freshly mowed grass, and your shit will smell like a flowerbed.”<br />
In between two breaths, which Aidan did through his nose, the smell changed as Mark described. If he had closed his eyes and hadn´t heard Mark´s sentence, he could believe to be standing on some big field of grass and flowers. Nearly instantly, his face relaxed and he let out a satisfied sigh. “That´s definitively better, thanks.”<br />
Mark laughed at the quickly changed mood of Aidan. He himself could already smell at least the grass, as with all his changes Aidan had sweated a bit more than normal. And as that were both smells they didn´t constantly smell, they didn´t mentally turn them off, making them even stronger to the both of them.<br />
“Okay, so we can also change the smell of things. I won´t need you to test a taste of something, I guess it would be the same. Any idea what else we can let change form on you? Otherwise, I would test something else next.” Mark asked Aidan, who seemed relaxed right now.<br />
Aidan thought about it, but shook his head. “No, no idea right now. You had form changes, both living and inanimate, along with giving me feathers, fur and scales. I have additional body parts, and both lost and returned things to my body. What else do you have in mind?”<br />
Had Aidan looked at Mark, he would have seen an evil grin. It wasn´t per se evil what Mark planned, but his face looked like it. “I was thinking about other measurements of the body to change. As you aren´t that big in that way, let´s do the following. Aidan, you will gain a hundred pounds of weight, centered around in your stomach area. Next, you will grow bigger to the size of 8ft tall. After that, your head alone will shrink about a third of its size, excluding your tail. Then you will gain muscles along your arms and legs, at least doubling your actual strength. And last, your cock and balls will regress in age to fit a baby, while your bladder and bowels will hold your age, meaning you won´t lose your control.”<br />
Aidan had looked alarmed and a bit angry at Mark´s plans, but he was overall okay with them. Becoming taller would reduce the effect of the weight he would gain, and the added strength would also help. Shrinking his head and regressing his genitals was mean, but at least he wasn´t forced to pee on his own carpet.<br />
Before he could comment, however, Aidan suddenly felt rather bloated. Looking down, he saw his stomach expand quickly, and the added weight pressed hard onto his stands, nearly giving his tire contact to the ground. But he had been right about it would spread around more soon. His body shot up, and he felt a strong pull in his flesh and bones as the length of his legs and torso raised nearly two feet together. His bloated stomach was sucked back in, distributing the mass around further.<br />
A strong pressure seemed to squeeze his head, letting him moan a bit, as his head shrunk smaller under it. The second moan was already higher pitched, giving the changed size the air could flow through his mouth. His tail, still the center of his face, was millimeters from both his eyes and his mouth now, and he could taste his fur on it. When the pressure ended around his head, another bloating feeling spread through his body, pumping his muscles with new strength. A small tingle was all he felt between his legs, as his genitals regressed into nearly nothing.<br />
Overall, Aidan now looked rather weird, and Mark laughed at his friends changed body. He saw Aidan´s tire was rotating really fast now, as it similar to the tail showed Aidan´s mood, which right now was excited.<br />
Aidan explained his feelings through the changes without Mark asking, knowing he would do so anyway. “The weight and the muscles felt like bloating up, the shrinking of my head like a tight squeezing. I felt a pull as I grew taller, down to my bones. And the regression was only a small tingle in that area.”<br />
Mark nodded again. “Okay, I guess if I would regress your whole body, it would be stronger, but still be a tingle. But it´s interesting that shrinking was more of a squeezing then. Maybe regressing you would be a mix between both.”<br />
Aidan looked at him shocked. “But you aren´t planning on regressing me that far, right?”<br />
Mark laughed at him. “No, that would be boring. And you wouldn´t be able to tell me until I change you back.” Turning to the laptop, Mark saw they had only about five minutes left before the timer reached zero. “Time flows quite fast, huh? We are nearly finished with your time as my guinea pig, Aidan.”<br />
Aidan now laughed a bit himself. “So, I will finally be back to normal? I think I like the tail and the muscles, but not the rest. I feel weird being so big suddenly.”<br />
“Yeah, and I got a few ideas what I would want to try myself now. But I have a last change I want you to test for me, and as it is not a nice one, I waited to do it last, so you have to suffer through it only a short time. Aidan, you will lose your mind in parts. First will be your memories, then your knowledge, and finally, your feelings and emotions. Each part will happen over a minute each, so by the end, you will be in that state for only half a minute.” Mark explained his last change to Aidan.<br />
Aidan looked horrified at him. “You want to erase me? What do you get from trying that?” Aidan already felt memories slipping his head.<br />
“I just want to know how it feels if you erase something out of there. Think about it, erasing a bad memory or useless knowledge, so you can concentrate on something more important.” Mark answered as Aidan´s hooves raised to his head, trying to massage his temples without any luck.<br />
Aidan accepted Mark´s answer, and just as quickly the whole situation was lost to him. The last memories to leave him were about the chronivac, Mark and himself. He stared at Mark with a blank look, not recognizing him or anything around him as his. He was right now more like a computer, working on programmed knowledge. But that also was slowly getting deleted out. A light sigh escaped him as he lost the knowledge how to form speech, and the last bits leaving him were about himself. Who he was? What he was?<br />
By the two-minute mark, Aidan was void of any knowledge, and his body worked purely on instincts, given by his feeling. His body feared something, so he cowered down, trying to hide from whatever made him want to run away. But now, with exactly these feelings vanishing at last, he more and more relaxed again, in a way blind to everything. <br />
When the last of it all left Aidan, he just stood there, like a statue, unmoving. He wasn´t even breathing, and Mark feared that he now had killed Aidan in the end. “Aidan, please don´t be dead.” He yelled panicking as he jumped forward to hear if Aidan´s heart was still beating, but he heard nothing form Aidan´s body. He pressed his ear painfully into the scales on his chest, but absolutely nothing. What if the program couldn´t restore him now?<br />
Just as he was nearly knocking Aidan over with how he pressed against his chest, the program beeped once. As Mark wasn´t looking at him, he missed how his body reverted to his old form.<br />
Within seconds, Aidan´s tail was sucked away, until the very tip turned into his nose. The nose above his ass was sucked into his body, along with the wings. Fur, feathers and scales vanished as well, leaving only naked skin behind. His tire vanished, split in the middle, back into Aidan´s legs, while the stands turned into his feet. His hooves split into fingers, soon being hands again.<br />
Without him noticing, Mark´s head sunk with Aidan´s chest, as he returned to his original size. His muscles shrunk away, along with the fat he had gained before. His cock bloomed bigger as it returned to its normal age, and his head expanded to its old size. And all along, his mind returned to normal, and he knew exactly how panicked Mark was right now, thinking him dead.<br />
Mark was near a heart attack when Aidan wrapped his arms around his still sobbing form, still deaf to the now again beating heart. “I´m okay, it´s over.” Aidan tried to calm Mark, but it took a bit for him to calm down. And that resulted in him promptly falling unconscious. <br />
Aidan dragged Mark over onto his couch, before getting something to drink. He needed something, and was sure Mark would need some, as well.</p>
