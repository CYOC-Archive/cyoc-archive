<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Clark couldn’t help but play back the conversation between him, Phil and Jax repeatedly. Did the jacket really have magical powers? Of course, seeing how Phil had changed almost overnight truly assured him that the jacket could do something, but he didn’t know what. So, Clark put on the jacket and walked away. <br />
<br />
As Clark strolled on his way home, he passed a small strip mall containing a few shops. He stopped and headed towards the small shopping mall, since they all had nice, bright window displays which were all decorated for the holidays. One of the stores was a brand-new sporting goods store, so he decided to go inside. <br />
<br />
Once inside, Clark spotted a section of American football gear, including padding, uniforms, cleats, and footballs. The display didn’t excite him that much, although he did have dreams of being a big, famous American football quarterback one day, throwing huge passes in a packed stadium filled with thousands of onlookers. So, he paused for a moment and then continued to the next section. <br />
<br />
In the next section of the sporting goods store, Clark spotted new weightlifting equipment, including weights, dumbbells, barbells, benches, machines, clothing, and more. Clark stood there as he imagined himself lifting weights in a gym where his muscles grew so big that he began to look like a teenage bodybuilder. The thought excited him a little bit, but he wanted to look further. As he walked past the football and the weightlifting gear, he felt a slight surge of power from the strange jacket, as if the object could detect his thoughts and feelings. <br />
<br />
Next, Clark walked into the baseball section, where large racks showcased all the different brands and types of baseball bats, gloves, balls, hats, and protective gear. Clark stopped and only imagined himself standing on the pitcher’s mound, throwing pitches at the batter as the crowd cheered him on. He imagined himself wearing a cool, stylish baseball uniform and a glove in his hand, as he hurled the ball towards home plate. He could almost hear the crowd as he struck out another batter, closing out another inning after the third strike. Yes, this made him excited. Again, the jacket felt it as well. <br />
<br />
Finally, Clark walked to the large section in the back where a large soccer goal was set up, with the thick, white, metal posts and the netting. A few soccer balls lay on the floor, and Clark casually kicked one ball into the goal. He paused and briefly imagined himself wearing cool soccer gear, with those long knee-high socks covering the shin guards, the colorful jersey and the padded gloves as he stood in the goal and protected it from the strikers of the opposing team. He had always dreamed of being a soccer goalie, with those thick, muscular quads and huge calves in his legs. Yes, Clark felt very, very excited. <br />
<br />
His cell phone beeped, and he received a text message from his mother. It was time to come home for dinner! So, Clark turned around and walked out. Just as he reached the door, he spotted a flying with a picture of a soccer player on it. He grabbed a flyer and stuck it in the side pocket of the jacket before he took off and walked home as quickly as he could. <br />
<br />
When he got home, he removed the jacket in his bedroom before he joined his mother for dinner. Afterwards, he returned to his bedroom, where he did his homework at his desk before he switched off the light and went to sleep. For some reason, he was feeling very tired that night. <br />
<br />
A few hours later, he woke up very early in the morning. Yes, he had to get up early. It was time for soccer practice. Wait. Soccer practice? Wearing just his underwear, Clark went into the bathroom and turned on the light as he stood before the full-body mirror which hung from the door. His jaw dropped wide open when he saw his reflection in the big mirror. <br />
<br />
He was just as short as he had always been. No increase in height for him. But, he was no longer a skinny kid. His legs were thick and muscled!<br />
<br />
“Holy shit! What happened?” he wondered as he stared at his reflection.<br />
<br />
His quads were twice as wide and twice as deep as before. His legs were as big as tree trunks, bulging from the sides with solid, unbridled muscle. Thick cords of muscle ran from the waist to the knees as he turned and flexed his mighty quads. Then, he turned around and gasped a second time. <br />
<br />
His calves were huge! Two thick, large mounds of muscle were sticking out from the back of his legs. No more skinny chicken legs for him. No, this was pure, solid muscle! He couldn’t believe hos big his legs had become.<br />
<br />
Then, all he could think of was soccer. Kicking a soccer ball. Dribbling a soccer ball. Passing a soccer ball. Doing soccer tricks. Bumping a soccer ball with his head. Tapping a ball with the sides of his cleats. The thoughts wouldn’t stop flowing through his head. <br />
<br />
Cleats? What cleats? Then he opened his closet and he found five pair of soccer cleats on the floor, still in their boxes. He put on his long socks and shin guards before he laced up his cleats and put on a jersey. Yes, he had become a soccer jock!<br />
<br />
Clark ran outside, kicking a soccer ball as he rolled the ball all the way to the field behind his school where he met up with a dozen other guys. They welcomed him on the team and right away, he made an impact. Clark would become the best player on the high school football club! <br />
<br />
But the jacket wasn’t done with Clark because he also had other desires. <br />
<br />
Would Clark remain a soccer jock, or would the jacket change him the following day into something else?</p>
