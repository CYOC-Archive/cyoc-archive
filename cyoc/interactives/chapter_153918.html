<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Diya…” Michael began. “I think it’s a good idea if we go ahead with laying out the plan.”<br />
<br />
Fido barked happily as he began to wag his tail.<br />
<br />
“We did promise Freddy that if he changed into a dog for you” he continued “that we’d talk about what my strategy is. I think we should stick to that promise.”<br />
<br />
“I guess…” Diya replied reluctantly. “Though I still think seeing him summon the ring would help me in evaluating the details of your plan.”<br />
<br />
Fido stood up as he happily wagged his tail back and forth, anxious to hear what Michael had in mind for defeating the wizard. <br />
<br />
“So” Michael continued. “Here’s what I’m thinking. The old man said we can’t beat this powerful wizard with brawn. Not only is he an expert in magic, he’s built like an ox. So if we’re going to beat the wizard, we have to pin him down with proof of his crimes so that he can reported to the police.”<br />
<br />
Diya nodded as Fido excitedly continued to listen on with interest. <br />
<br />
“So that means we need to get him on the record admitting to his crimes and keeping him held down in this neighborhood long enough for us to summon a magical police force to arrest him. Like in the human world, crimes are adjudicated in court with evidence and that’s what we have to collect for the charges to stick. So, that’s where you come in to play, Diya.”<br />
<br />
Diya looked at Michael intently, unsure of where she was coming into all of this. <br />
<br />
“Remember when I asked you to borrow that advanced bugging device?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, Michael.”<br />
<br />
“My plan involves finding a ruse to get into the wizard’s house so that way I can both keep an eye on him and listen in to his conversations from afar. He’s not going to spill the beans in my presence, or Freddy’s, but if he can tricked into thinking that we’re not listening in on his conversations, then we might be able to get him on tape revealing his thieving ways in the privacy of his own home.”<br />
<br />
“Ok, so you plan to bug his house. What’s the ruse to get in there so you can do it?”<br />
<br />
“That’s where Freddy comes in.”<br />
<br />
Fido looked up at Michael, nervous as to what he might be suggesting. <br />
<br />
“Freddy” Michael continued as he looked down at Fido. “You should prepare to spend the weekend on all fours at Sofya’s house.”<br />
<br />
Fido whined in discontent and then began to bark loudly. Michael bent down to rub his back, but that didn’t seem to calm him down. <br />
<br />
“Listen, Freddy” Michael said, trying to be reassuring. “It’s not like we’re going to leave you there as a dog forever. I just need someone on the inside to provide another pair of ears. I’ll be listening in from afar and you’ll be listening in on the ground.”<br />
<br />
Fido whined loudly.<br />
<br />
“It’s not that bad, Freddy” Michael continued. “It just insures that the bugs stay in place and that someone is keeping an eye on them at all times.”<br />
<br />
Fido barked in discontent. <br />
<br />
“See, Michael” Diya said. “This is why we should have waited to talk about this until after Freddy changed back. Obviously, he’s very angry right now and I’d like to hear what his objections are. Plus, I’d still like to see the ring.”<br />
<br />
“Alright” Michael replied as he scratched Fido behind the ears. “Let me get Freddy back and then we’ll talk it over in more detail.”<br />
<br />
Diya stood there as Michael and Fido looked at her with a glare. <br />
<br />
“We’re going to need some privacy please, Diya” Michael said.<br />
<br />
“Oh right, sorry” Diya replied, feeling embarrassed. “Let me leave you boys alone for a bit.”<br />
<br />
Diya made her way to the door, but turned to them before she opened it. <br />
<br />
“I’m going to use the bathroom. Is 20 minutes enough time?”<br />
<br />
“I guess so.”<br />
<br />
Fido looked at her nervously. He wasn’t sure if that would be enough time to do the trick, but they were running short on it, so they’d have to make it happen fast. <br />
<br />
“Oh, I almost forgot” Diya said as she walked back into the room. “Here…”<br />
<br />
Diya pulled out a bottle and a plastic bag from her shelf. <br />
<br />
“This is the spray you mentioned that you wanted me to purchase. I thought it was so strange when you originally asked me to buy this, but I decided to just go along with it, thinking there was some method to your madness. It makes sense now that I know what’s going on. I got it with same day delivery and, surprisingly, it came just a few hours ago. My parents were bugging me about what it was, so I just told them it was a new perfume that I wanted to try. They didn’t seem to object.”<br />
<br />
Diya handed the pheromone spray to Michael. <br />
<br />
“And when Freddy…erm, Fido, is done, use this” she continued.<br />
<br />
Diya handed Michael a plastic bag. <br />
<br />
“I don’t want there to be a mess on my floor. When he’s ejaculating, use this to collect all the semen. Don’t spill any, please.”<br />
<br />
“Sure Diya” Michael responded as she nodded and walked out the door. <br />
<br />
Alone in the room with Fido, Michael thought it best not to waste anymore time and got right down to business. <br />
<br />
“Alright, Freddy. I’m going to spray some of pheromones on my hand and hopefully that will turn you on a bit.”<br />
<br />
Michael sat down next to Fido as he took the bottle and sprayed a little on his hand. Placing his hand to Fido’s snout, Fido took in the scent from Michael and the reaction in his loins began a minute later. <br />
<br />
“Do you think you can self service yourself tonight, Freddy? I’m not in the mood to jack you off.”<br />
<br />
Fido did not react to this well as he barked, trotted behind Michael’s back and pushed him down on the floor. From there, Fido grabbed the hem of Michael’s pants with his teeth as he tried to rip off them. Panicking, Michael placed his hands on Fido’s snout as he tried to swat him away. <br />
<br />
“Stop it Freddy! Bad dog!”<br />
<br />
Freddy whined as he let go of the pants and stepped back away from Michael. Michael lifted himself up as he scolded Fido.<br />
<br />
“Jesus, Freddy, what’s gotten into you?”<br />
<br />
With a whimper and a sad expression on his puppy dog face, Fido turned into his crotch and began to lick his still flailing red rocket. Freddy found that this didn’t turn him on nearly as much as his blowjob from Michael or his mating sessions with Ellie and the stray bitch in the park. Still, it would have to suffice for now to get himself off. <br />
<br />
After a few minutes of self pleasure, Freddy motioned to Michael with his snout to take the plastic bag and place it over his dick. Michael, having sat down to watch his boyfriend lick himself into orgasm, scooched into Fido&#39;s crotch with the bag and held it over his jerking penis. After a few gentle rubs, Fido began to shoot his load into the bag. Michael pulled Fido’s penis up into a position that simulated a tie. This saw a larger quantity of semen come out in drips than Michael had noticed in the past. <br />
<br />
Finally, after a few minutes of milking every last drop of cum out of Fido&#39;s dog dick, Michael tied up the semen filled bag, got up and placed it on Diya’s desk. As he did so, he could hear Fido changing back behind him. By the time he turned around again, Michael already saw his boyfriend butt naked on his best friend’s floor. <br />
<br />
“Michael?” Freddy asked he quietly lifted himself up into a standing position. “Why did you scold me like a bad dog?”<br />
<br />
“Because Freddy” Michael responded. “You were trying to pull down my pants to, I presume, fuck me. Not only did we not have enough time for that now, I really don’t think it’s a good idea for us to be doing that at all.”<br />
<br />
“Michael…”<br />
<br />
“Freddy, can we talk about this later, please? Get your clothes back on. Diya will be back soon.”<br />
<br />
Freddy stared at Michael as he attempted to plead with him with his eyes. Michael was having none of this and folded his arms to signal his dismissal. After a minute of silence with neither of them moving a muscle, Freddy sighed in resignation as he bent down to pick up his clothes from the floor and put them back on piece by piece. Just as Freddy finished putting on his shoes, the two boys heard a knock on the door. <br />
<br />
“I hope you’re decent” they could hear Diya say as she opened the door. <br />
<br />
Diya covered her face as she she closed the door behind her and stood before them with her elbow blocking her vision.<br />
<br />
“Are you dressed, Freddy?” Diya asked. <br />
<br />
“Yes, Diya” Freddy replied. <br />
<br />
Diya moved her elbow and opened her eyes to see Freddy standing before her again; as clothed as he had been before he dogged out. <br />
<br />
“I still can’t believe this is happening” Diya said in disbelief as she gaped at him with a surprised look on her face.<br />
<br />
“You’re telling me” he responded. “I’m the one who has to spend part of the time on all fours. And from the looks of it, the whole entire weekend now, too.”<br />
<br />
“It’s not a big deal” Michael replied. “It’s just for this one weekend and then, hopefully, we’ll break the curse and you’ll never have to do it again.”<br />
<br />
“About that” Freddy interjected. “I don’t like this idea at all.”<br />
<br />
“Why Freddy?” Diya asked. “I think it’s a pretty good idea considering the circumstances.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah Freddy” Michael concurred. “I don’t see what you find so objectionable about it.”<br />
<br />
“You don’t?” Freddy asked incredulously. “Because I have several problems with it.”<br />
<br />
“Oh Jesus” Michael said nervously. <br />
<br />
“For starters’ Freddy continued “I have to spend the night at Sofya’s. As a dog. Michael, don’t you remember what happened the last time I was over there by myself?”<br />
<br />
“That was as a human being” he responded. “This time it’s different. You’ll be a dog.”<br />
<br />
“Still. What if I accidentally turn back while I’m in there. Not only would I be in serious trouble, but I’d be naked and vulnerable to Sofya’s advances. It’d be easier for her to rape me than ever before. And what if she has a dog fetish, Michael? She could jack me off and then the gig would be up.”<br />
<br />
“Freddy, if anyone should be worried about Sofya coming onto you, it should be me and I’m not that worried about it. She’s not going to come onto you as a dog unless she has a freaky dog fetish, which I highly doubt that she has. And even if she does have one or you get horny while you&#39;re over there, just run away from her and restrain yourself. You can avoid ejaculating for 24 hours or so.”<br />
<br />
“And then there’s the fact that my friends are going to be over tomorrow night, Michael. I’m going to have to be in the house at the same time as my friends.”<br />
<br />
“It’s not a big deal” Diya responded. “You’re not going to be there. Fido is.”<br />
<br />
“And besides, Freddy” Michael added as he moved to place his hands on Freddy’s shoulders. “Think of it as being a fly on the wall to what your friends really think of you.”<br />
<br />
Freddy looked at Michael with agitation strewn across his face as there was an awkward silence between them. <br />
<br />
“Actually” Michael corrected himself. “I’m going to be like the fly on the wall, with the bugs we’re planting all over their house. For you, it’s going to be more like Fido on the floor. You don’t think your friends trash you behind your back, Freddy?”<br />
<br />
“My friends have never said anything bad about me” Freddy responded as he removed Michael’s hands from his shoulders and turned around to face him.<br />
<br />
“I highly doubt that” Michael replied. “And besides, think of it as an opportunity for you to find out what your friends, your great ‘friends,’ really think of you when they don’t think you’re around to listen in on what they have to say.”<br />
<br />
Freddy moved to object, but Michael wouldn’t let him. Michael walked over to Diya and tried to take the bugging device from her desk before being stopped. <br />
<br />
“Not yet” Diya responded. “While I’m going to let you guys use this for the plan, I want to see the ring first before I hand it over.”<br />
<br />
Freddy groaned as Michael looked at him earnestly. <br />
<br />
“She’s right, Freddy” Michael said. “You promised.”<br />
<br />
“Fine” Freddy replied. “She kept her word and I’ll keep mine.”<br />
<br />
Freddy opened his hand out and closed his eyes. He began to visualize the ring in vivid detail. At first, nothing seemed to be happening and Diya was once again questioning whether she was in a coma or in a long, long dream. Finally, after what seemed like ages, a flash of lighting struck across Freddy’s palm as Diya jumped back while Michael stood still, having gotten used to the summoning by now. <br />
<br />
After some smoke settled from his palm, Diya looked into Freddy’s hand to find that the Ruggeri ring had made an appearance. <br />
<br />
“Unbelievable!” Diya exclaimed. “That’s amazing!”<br />
<br />
Freddy opened his eyes to find the ring back in his palm, glowing as it sent a chill down his spine. Before he knew it, though, Michael snatched it from him and placed into his hand. <br />
<br />
“Hey!” Freddy snapped. <br />
<br />
“Since you’re going to be a dog for the weekend” Michael replied “I figured that I should hold onto this for the time being.”<br />
<br />
Freddy frowned at Michael briefly, before he realized that it was for the best. Michael took care to place it gently into his pocket. When he was done, he turned to Diya. <br />
<br />
“Freddy is able to summon the ring with his mind. When he wants to send it away, he can do that with his mind too. But for now, I’d like to keep the ring on my person. And before you ask, I can’t explain to you how it works or why it happens. All I know is that I didn’t think of this before the old man from the magic shop scolded me for not having thought of asking Freddy to do this earlier.”<br />
<br />
Diya nodded, processing this information, however limited it was. <br />
<br />
“So now that you’ve seen the trick in action” Michael continued “it’s time for you to hand over the bugging device.” <br />
<br />
“About that” Diya replied. “I need to the deposit first.”<br />
<br />
“What?” Freddy asked with a tinge of anger in his voice, upset at the many obstacles that Diya was placing in the way of getting started on executing Michael’s plan. <br />
<br />
“It’s fine, Freddy” Michael replied, as he waved his hand to dismiss his objection. “I already talked this over with Diya and I agreed to do it.”<br />
<br />
Michael pulled out his phone and opened up a financial payment app. After typing in some numbers and punching his screen with his fingers a few times, a dinging could be heard as the money was sent away to her account. Diya heard a dig on her phone and pulled it up to see a message that read:<br />
<br />
“$500 Payment from Michael Received”<br />
<br />
“Thank you, Michael” Diya said as she put her phone down. “That ought to cover it.”<br />
<br />
“Why are you making him pay for this, Diya?” Freddy asked. <br />
<br />
“Freddy” she responded “this bugging device is very expensive. I can get myself out of a lot of sticky situations, but it’s harder for me to get out of losing a valuable device like this, especially if I’m not the one handling it directly. I’m not made of money, though I hope to be one day. I only asked Michael for a deposit to cover the costs in case they break, get stolen or destroyed. If they come back in one piece, then Michael gets his money back. If not…”<br />
<br />
Diya pointed to an old fashion piggy bank sitting on a shelf. <br />
<br />
“…think of it as a generous contribution to the Diya Ramesh Harvard University Scholarship Fund.”<br />
<br />
Freddy, unsure of how to respond, turned to Michael who smiled at him and put a reassuring hand on his shoulder. Diya opened the box and poured its contents out onto her desk. Laid before them were six little devices that looked like tiny, electronic ants.<br />
<br />
“These are the most advanced bugs in the world” Diya began as she pointed them out to Freddy and Michael, who stared at them with curiosity. “It’s amazing how I was able to even get my hands on these things in the first place. They are used by foreign governments to spy on their adversaries. It’s the best of the best. They are small enough to fit into the tiniest of crevices and have a listening range of over 100 feet. It has incredible decibel sensitivity and can pick up everything from the quietest of whispers to the loudest of airplanes with crystal clear recording output. It’s amazing considering the microphone is so small, it’s barely visible to the naked eye.”<br />
<br />
Diya put the bugs back in the box and handed them to Michael.<br />
<br />
“All you have to do is put them on a surface and gently tap it in to secure it. My suggestion is to find small and hard to reach crevices and place them there. Things like the backs of hard to move furniture or the backs of paintings. Things you think aren’t going to be turned over, manhandled or looked at regularly. Dark spaces or crevices in walls are good hiding spots as well.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks Diya” Michael responded. “I’ll try to get these back to you in one piece.”<br />
<br />
“Just work on breaking the curse” Diya responded. “That’s the priority. The bugs are replaceable…ish, but Freddy’s life is not.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks Diya” Freddy responded, appreciative that she knew what was important in this moment, even if he wished that she hadn’t charged Michael to use the bugs. <br />
<br />
“It’s getting late” Michael said as he as he yawned and began to gather his belongings. “We still haven’t figured out where we’re going to sleep for the night.”<br />
<br />
“Where do you think we should go?” Freddy asked quietly. <br />
<br />
Michael thought for a moment before he decided…..</p>
