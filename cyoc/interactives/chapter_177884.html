<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Since then, the girls quickly fixed the accidental curse on Susan by making it now entirely up to her decision when her clit would become a clit-dick. And Jen managed to convince her to slowly build up her breasts, as suddenly comming to school with DDs when the day before she was as flat as a pancake would be a bit more than an eye opener for most. <br />
<br />
Jen&#39;s GG cup breasts would produce more than a few droplets now that they have undergone yet another size increase, nearly multiplying her maximum quantity of milk by tenfold. Since she was banned from entering the actual pool on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday were just spent on the side bench watching the class. Her bikini also was not unaffected buy her total wardrobe update, and now her nipples were sticking out, perfectly exposed and at a length of 1.5&quot; long, they were quite noticable.<br />
<br />
It was definitely something she had to get use to. Her life apparently was not made to be spent covering up her breasts. None of her clothing, even the new things she buys, would even dare touch her nipples. Everything had without fail, somehow been remade into a special version that exposed her breasts in full. The first day had been very awkward at first for her. But by now, since not a single person seemed to give it a second thought anyways, Jen had stopped worring about it too. <br />
<br />
Since Susan had shrunk her breasts back down to normal, she no longer was lactating either. But that wouldn&#39;t be the same after a few more weeks, so she was still allowed to swim. <br />
<br />
One of the teachers walked over to speak with Jen. &quot;I am really sorry we had to make you sit out Jen, but that&#39;s the school&#39;s ruling on this matter, so it is out of my hands. Either way, I have a seperate matter to discuss with you. While I am glad to say that you still are allowed to be on the team, unfortunately, your normal position can no longer be filled by you. Simply put, with the recent raapid development in your breasts, you are sadly now too big and off balance to be one of the flyers. Again, since this is actually a regulation imposed by the national organization, I can&#39;t do anything about it. And even though I know that your body weight still falls well within the range, they insisted on their ruling, saying that they wouldn&#39;t make an exception whenever a student&#39;s safety is concerned.&quot;  Informed the teacher. She and Jen had known eachother for almost 6 years now, and Jen was by far her favorite cheerleader on the squad, so when the notice came, she had been greatly saddened by it. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s ok, I understand that it isn&#39;t your fault.  I dont mind being part of the pyramid base&quot; said Jen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, about that. I am so, so sorry but when I said that you could still be on the squad, I didn&#39;t mean as one of the active squad members, but more as either my assistant, the mascot, or as our equipment manager. Look, I usually wouldn&#39;t say this, but I wouldn&#39;t hold it against you at all if you even wanted to just quit the team. This is a really bullshit ruling in my opinion, but it is above my authority in the matter. If we let you participate as an active squad member, then we will be heavily fined for both reckless endangerment and... unnecessary obscenity. Look, everyone here already onows and excepts your progressive, free and open breast style. But these clowns on the board don&#39;t. They think you are just acting up for some kind of stunt or whatever. They don&#39;t count it as a medical issue either, even though it basically is. It isn&#39;t your fault that your nipples are just that sensitive.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen just let out a sigh. She had expected something like this to come up. The morning she woke up with GG breasts she already knew she would be kicked off of the active squad by the board. This was not the first time they have done this, and it won&#39;t be the last either. They consider any girl to be &quot;too lewd for the general public viewing&quot; if she had breasts bigger than DD on a &quot;disproportionately slender&quot; body. <br />
<br />
&quot;If it is alright, I think I will just take a break from all of cheerleading for a while. Even just helping out at practice will just be more depressing than enjoyable to me for a while&quot; said Jen appologeticly. Her coach nodded at her decision. &quot;I understand completely. Don&#39;t worry about returning your uniform, you can just keep it as a souvenir of sorts. And I don&#39;t think anyone would stop you from wearing it around school either, just not to the games is all. Again, I am sorry about all of this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her coach left and Jen just continued to watch the class. Oddly enough, she was not bothered by what just happened in the slightest. She was not happy, or sad. Just bland and boring apathetic. This was odd for her, but over the last few days, she found that she felt like this more and more. She was by no means emotionless, but she simply stopped caring about the extreme negatives in her life much faster than usual. She had even began to doodle and draw in her growing quantity of free time. She found it both fun to do and also relaxing.<br />
<br />
Swim class ended and all of the girls, including Jen, left the pool and changed back into their clothes, Jen&#39;s turtle neck top had no back and also had 2 holes which would slide over her breasts. Literally every guy and even many of the girls would give her passing glances. None of them were with bad intentions though. She liked the added attention it brought her too. While she was walking, someone jumped onto her from behind and began squeezing her breasts, causing a bit of her milk to spray out and a lusty moan to escape her lips.</p>
