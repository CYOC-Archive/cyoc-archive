<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The answer came to Brandon perhaps a little too easy.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll do what it takes to survive,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Brandon felt confident, as though he was in control and could think and do what he wanted. If he desired to strip his clothes off and run naked and free through the woods, he would do that. Having a girlfriend felt natural now.<br />
<br />
He remembered his former life just fine. Even in this so-called time of equal opportunities, people often expected women to be submissive. As Brenda, Brandon had wanted to do things. However, her family often told (or gave the appearance of telling her) that she was the girl. It had annoyed her that just because of gender, she might not be able to have a career or do much beyond being propagating the species. <br />
<br />
Now, however, Brandon felt different. Since becoming male, it seemed the spell or his manhood (perhaps both) had boosted his ego. What he wanted *did* matter. If someone wanted to tell him differently, he was willing to fight for the right to do as he wanted.<br />
<br />
Danielle on the other hand seemed to be taking a turn for the other side of the coin. Brandon noted how her once strong boyfriend was now behaving submissive. She was relying on him for comfort as though he had the solutions to all of their problems.<br />
<br />
&quot;But how we live like this? It's as if I'm not me any more! I feel so weak and helpless,&quot; Danielle said.<br />
<br />
Brandon sighed, was this how girls acted without even realising it? He didn't want to go back to that! He knew that he had to rely on what (even if perhaps it was minute) femininity he had inside of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen to me Danny. You're not weak and helpless! Besides, I'll protect you no matter what happens. It looks like there may not be a society on this world. We're going to have to adapt and get used to being fox people. I'll make sure you enjoy this. Look, if you want to take off your clothes then go ahead,&quot; Brandon said.<br />
<br />
Truth be told, Brandon no longer saw the prospect of Danielle parading around nude as degrading to women. Brandon also didn't want to strip just to see a naked man do as he pleased. Perhaps, initially knowing it would insult Danielle is what stopped him when he might have done it using that motivation. He didn't however, mind the idea of seeing Danielle naked as female fox.<br />
<br />
&quot;But, I don't know. I mean, I ... I don't want that much to see a naked woman now. Besides, someone might see us!&quot; Danielle said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who? You know what, let them see us. If Kat is watching let *her* see us! I have nothing to hide!&quot; Brandon said.<br />
<br />
Brandon removed his shirt and then his pants before removing his undergarments and standing there. Danielle seemed to be struggling. It was as though she wanted to do something but was afraid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't be afraid to look. If you want to give in and enjoy my body, go ahead,&quot; Brandon said.<br />
<br />
Brandon watched Danielle look his body up and down.<br />
<br />
&quot;I ... I feel funny,&quot; Danielle said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How so?&quot; Brandon asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know I ... I want you. No, I can't let her win. I don't want to be a girl!&quot; Danielle said.<br />
<br />
Brandon watched with horror as Danielle turned around and ran away! Brandon chased after Danielle while calling her name. He wondered if this was his fault. Maybe he was being too egotistical. Unfortunately, he liked being naked. He was female enough to know he was good looking. While perhaps that was actually his ego speaking, he saw that Danielle looked at him with more then a little lust in her eyes.<br />
<br />
*	*	*<br />
<br />
Danielle ran as fast as she could. She tried her best to ignore the jiggling on her chest. Dammit, she didn't want to be a girl! At school, she'd seen girls do things that seemed embarrassing to her. <br />
<br />
She'd been too nervous of someone catching them to even consider sneaking into the ladies change room. The idea of getting in there wasn’t so appealing now that she *was* a lady.<br />
<br />
She wondered if the whole idea seemed appealing because it was wrong. While she never smoked, she remembered her friend Billy. When he started, part of the appeal for him was that it was something he wasn’t supposed to do. When his parents found out, they were initially furious. However, eventually, they didn't care. That was when Billy lost interest in it. Somehow, for him, it wasn’t as cool when he wasn’t defying someone's authority.<br />
<br />
When she'd first changed, stripping and seeing a naked vixen appealed to Danielle. Touching her body and feeling sensations nature never intended her to feel was wrong. Being able to touch female parts without some sort of permission had been appealing to her. However, now she felt more like a natural born female. Somehow, that took the appeal out of it.<br />
<br />
However, she was finding a new allure now. Even as a girl, people would consider stripping and exploring her body in the middle of the woods wrong. That alone had her feeling interested enough in the idea. However, when Brandon had all but told her to do it, somehow it almost took the appeal of it away! Although, she also noted that pleasing him was an appealing idea. She hated the thought that she'd be so dependant on him that she'd be not unable but unwilling to think independently.<br />
<br />
Then there was gender roles in society. Companies always geared boy's stuff towards being strong. The same companies would gear girl’s stuff towards looking good and being more submissive. Danielle didn't like that especially now that she *was* the girl.<br />
<br />
When Danielle thought about having babies, a part of her enjoyed the idea. However, another part of her was terrified that she'd be nothing more then a baby factory to Brandon! From her point of view, he'd be free to go on adventures and have fun while she'd be stuck at home, unable to do anything else then raise kids!<br />
<br />
Having grown tired, Danielle stopped running. Brandon caught up to her moments later. He was still naked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you run away?&quot; Brandon asked.<br />
<br />
Danielle couldn’t bring herself to look lower then Brandon's eyes, despite her urges wanting her to.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want to be the girl! I have hopes and dreams! I'm not some bitch who only exists to make babies!&quot; Danielle cried.<br />
<br />
Brandon seemed almost hurt. &quot;I never said you were. Why do you think that's what I want?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At home, people still expect the woman to be the mother. You know, the whole barefoot, pregnant and in the kitchen thing. I guess as a guy, I never thought much of it. I don't think I considered what it'd be like for people to expect me to have no plans for my future and to only care about everyone else,&quot; Danielle said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I ... you're right,&quot; Brandon said.<br />
<br />
Brandon turned around and looked at the ground. Danielle fought the urge to look at and touch his rear end.<br />
<br />
&quot;As a girl I thought that would be my life. Just be a wife and mother. I mean, in school, even if they don't say it, from what I saw, to be honest, they tend to encourage girls just to take easier courses. Now that I'm the guy, I feel strong, like I can do what I want and if anyone says otherwise, I can and will fight for the right to do as I want. Before, it was different. If you said we should fight, I'd trust you even if I didn't agree. Now, I feel like, I need to have my own opinions and not just inside but to express them,&quot; Brandon said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it,&quot; Danielle said.<br />
<br />
Brandon turned around. &quot;What's wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I keep wanting to touch you. This is stupid!&quot; Danielle said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it? As a guy you desired me didn't you?&quot; Brandon asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Danielle answered. She hung her head. &quot;It's that I feel like if I'm attracted to a guy that means I'm gay!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not if you're a girl!&quot; Brandon said. Danielle felt Brandon gently touch under her muzzle. She raised her head to look at him. &quot;Look, it's still me under this body, our roles are just a bit different now. Think of it this way, if I were someone else, would you still like me in that way?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I ... I dunno. I don't think I could,&quot; Danielle said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, we'll get through this. We'll make a home here and find a way to make a life for ourselves. Now, if you want to be naked, go ahead, I won't stop you. I'll take care of you and make sure no one hurts you. Because if they try, I'll snap their neck like a twig.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And it I want you to at least put some pants on?&quot; Danielle asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I will it it'll make you feel safer,&quot; Brandon said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually,&quot; Danielle said, running her right index finger down Brandon's chest and taking in his scent. &quot;You can stay this way. These clothes are dirty and smell bad anyway; I kinda do want to get rid of 'em. Can I just ask you a favour?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brandon smiled. &quot;Sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I do start to lose it and you know, you can tell it's my hormones talking, please, do like we did as humans and say no. I'll try to do the same for you. At least, until we're truly ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brandon nodded. &quot;I'll try my best.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danielle hugged Brandon before stepping back. She removed her clothing starting with the blouse and bra and threw them to the ground. Standing as naked as one could with fur, she took several deep breaths. She felt exposed but at the same time not humiliated. Brandon had seen her this way and perhaps now, the world had seen her like this. She broken though one layer. Now, she wondered what the next step would be.</p>
