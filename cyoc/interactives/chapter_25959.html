<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jason looked over at the both of you and smiled. He proceeded to take his shirt off because he was extremely hot and used the shirt to wipe his brow. You looked over at your new friend and roommate and noticed he barely had any definition to his chest, unlike the current bartender.
<BR>Jason looked at the couple of guys sitting there, one who was a deserter to Pleasure Island, who would now be able to reap its benefits, in some certain cases that is. Jason sat there and looked at them, he wished that he would be able to have a special drink with those two.</br>
<BR>"So what will it be guys?</br>
<BR>"Bear Balls please! Hey Jason, exactly how many does it take to get every last effect of the drink?"</br>
<br>Jason winked at your new friend and drinking buddy.</br>
<br>"To be honest, it takes at least two, but you are safe having double that. Besides, if you drink more than you need anyway, it will only benefit your condition and state of being when all is said and done."</br>
<br>"Ok, make four shots a piece then!"</br>
<br>Your new roommate turned to face you and smiled.</br>
<br>"It looks to me that we are going to become the best of friends after tonight."</br>
<br>"Yeah, I guess we will... hey by the way I never did catch your name at all! Also, what did you mean for the drinks to have their full effect?"</br>
<br>"I guess I never really properly introduced myself to you. My name is Robert, but please call me Spike. It was a nickname I was given long ago and I would really like to go back to going by that name. In fact here on Pleasure Island, my identification card has my first name legally as Spike. The reason behind my nickname was that I used to emulate the very guy I dreamed of being like in high school, but no matter how hard I tried, I could not even come close to matching his size or scruffiness. So I just started acting like him and one day I started being called that. Second of all, what I said about the drinks was just what I said. I don't really know what special attributes these drinks give people. When I went through the bartending classes and told how to make each and every drink, they just told us that the name of the drink co-incited with the special ingredient is. Each drink has a certain level or amount of alcohol in them and there is a certain number that gets you as intoxicated as your system can handle."</br>
<br>As Spike finished talking, Jason was done preparing the drinks for his patrons and slid them down the bar from where he was standing. They stopped perfectly right in front of where you were both sitting, and what was most remarkable was that not a drop of the liquor was spilled. You both picked up your first shot, clanged the glasses together and took the shot straight down, somewhat smoothly. Since it was your first time actually drinking an alcoholic beverage, you weren't used to the burn on the way down, so you coughed and choked just a bit. Only seconds after the first shot hit the pit of your stomach did you feel the inebriating effect of the alcohol. You both sat there looking at each other, each about to say something when the other was about to speak. As you looked at Spike, you can't help to notice how attractive Spike really was. After sitting there for a moment, you realize that it became at least ten degrees warmer in the room and you had to remove your shirt. You were just as scrawny, if not more than Spike, but at this point you didn't care, you were just happy to be able to do that small thing and allow yourself to cool off a tad. As you looked at Spike, you notice that there was a light fuzz covering his chest and he grew a five o'clock shadow since having the drink only seconds ago. You have heard of alcohol making you a man, but dang if that wasn't a pretty quick reaction. You watch in amazement as his face went to that of a young man with a five-o’ clock shadow, to a man who had a thick and full beard attached to a thirty-five year old man’s face. You wanted to know if the same had happened to you and as you reached up, you were shocked and amazed that you too shared the same attributes.</br>
<br>The two of you look at each other, more attracted to each other when you had first taken the shot, as if you both were now gay. As you continue to study him, you also notice that his muscles had become just a bit defined and a light coating of thick and dark brown hair covered his arms, hands, and chest.</br>
<br>“Wow, this is pretty cool and I thought my trip to the Maturation Station was cool, and I just did that seconds ago. First I go from thirteen to twenty-one in mere seconds, now I am a thirty-five year old, cub of a man! I think we should go ahead and take the next shot, this is such a rush!”</br>
<br>Spike nodded, you both clanged your glasses together and Jason could stand there and watch these two change rapidly, nodding in approval as he became turned on by the turn of events. Just like before, the shots burned on the way down, but not as much as they did the first time. As the two of you sit there, watching each other, you could feel things rapidly expanding all over your body and watched as Spike was somewhat of a mirror to show what was happening to you. Both of your muscles went from nothing, which was the case on your entire bodies, to being voluptuous mountains of muscle all over your bodies, as well as a spare tire that formed quickly over your short-lived six pack abs. As the muscles stopped, you felt something odd, it was if your body started tingling and itching at the same time! You both watched as your muscles became covered in thick, dark brown human hair, so thick you would think it was fur. Then, just as quick as your muscles grew, you began to feel a stirring in your pants. You start to become uncomfortable as your entire package grew and outgrew their confines. You look over at Jason, who was now tweaking his nipples in arousal, and gave the look of puppy dog eyes.</br>
<br>“What is the matter David?”</br>
<br>I was wondering if we could just get totally buck naked. Our current restrictions are becoming quite painful as we continue growing!”</br>
<br>“Yeah… sure that would be fine with me. Here on Pleasure Island, we can do whatever we want, especially since we are all men and there are absolutely no girls or women allowed on this island.”</br>
<br>David and Spike looked at each other, now in lust, and didn’t hesitate one second to remove the rest of their clothing. As they stood there naked, they looked at each other jaw dropped as they were both now muscle bound bear men. What was most impressive was the size of their cocks. They were both about the same. Their cocks were at least nine inches long and as thick as a beer can.. They seriously could not believe their eyes and Jason was now drooling, wanting both of those meaty cocks for himself, as well as the special surprise at the end.</br>
<br>“Hey, you know what you two, I think its about time you guys got to the back room, as I am sure you are thinking the same thing I am. Here, I will double the size of your glasses so that you can combine the two shots into one big one. That way, you both can get over what is going to happen to you both next.”</br>
<br>Jason quickly took two larger shot glasses and combined the other two drinks each of you both had left. You both clanged your glasses together in tradition and this time the alcohol went down smoothly. You both stand there, waiting in excited anticipation for whatever the next changes were… and boy did they ever pack a mean punch! Your skin began to itch even more profusely and it felt as if your skin was crawling. You could feel all the muscles in your body become even more tense and rigid, you could feel all the bones in your body popping and cracking as well as shifting to accommodate the new form it would be taking. Then it all happened at once. You watched as your arms and legs lengthened and thickened, your hands and feet changing into paws, your face pushing outward forming your new muzzle along with your teeth elongating and becoming sharper and your tongue growing to fit your new mouth, your ears grew longer and more rounded and placed themselves atop of your head, your chest and stomach bulked out where your pecs were as huge as mountains and your belly became fatter but it was hard as a rock, your tail popped out of your tailbone even though it was a short nub, last was your cock that grew to be fourteen inches long and six inches thick in diameter and still had the human shape to it as well as your balls that were now the size of grapefruits.</br>
<br>You sit there in amazement and wonder at all of this. You look over to Spike, who now, really did fit his name. You hunger for the new bear cock as well as the sexy bartender Jason. You know from that point on that your life is going to be filled with hot, sweaty bearman sex and cum galore~</br></p>
