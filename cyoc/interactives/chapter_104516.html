<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Tad was providing help for the Howlers with regard to their issues, Agent Theodore Green was getting ready for the day as well. He felt rather confident for success for the day, as it would be the day to get justice for the murder of Jeff Decker. He&#39;d been on the case from the beginning, and while it had been frustrating at first, thanks to having little identification on who the suspect was, once they had an ID on their suspect, things had all fallen into play. He knew who to look for and that lead to tips on where to find him. That presented the chance to catch his suspect,  Lionel Ulysses, and likely take a the gang he&#39;d been associating with in Seattle down as well. Teddy was determined to bring Ulysses in and fulfill the promise he&#39;d made to Jennifer Decker to bring her husband&#39;s killer to justice.<br />
<br />
Getting ready was a bit more difficult than normal. Given the potential for there to be a shoot out or some sort of scuffle with the &quot;Rat Pack,&quot; bulletproof vests would be required, but given the fact that the plan was to ambush Lionel Ulysses, wearing the vests openly might draw unnecessary attention and spoil the entire raid. That meant that Teddy had to wrestle to fit his normal suit jacket over his vest. He managed, but just barely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready Agent Green?&quot; came Agent Peters&#39; voice from behind him in the main equipment locker.<br />
<br />
She was dressed a bit more casually than he was, with a pair of jeans and a Seattle Seahawks windbreaker on over her bulletproof vest. He couldn&#39;t see her gun outright, but there looked to be the outline of one either in an internal jacket pocket or in a holster strapped to the bulletproof vest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready, indeed,&quot; Teddy answered, &quot;with a shot at getting justice... and with some extra help arranged.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Seattle PD?&quot; Agent Peters mused as they turned to leave the FBI&#39;s Seattle Field Office and drive to the McDonnalds near the city&#39;s warehouse district, thinking of the agreement with the Seattle police.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, they&#39;ll be there,&quot; Teddy answered, &quot;I was thinking more along the lines of someone who might be more familiar with Lionel Ulysses as an individual and so on...&quot;<br />
<br />
Agent Peters raised an eyebrow in confusion, &quot;You called his parents?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, after our conference I made a call to the Moon Lake police and their chief,&quot; Teddy explained, &quot;to get some extra backup and to make sure that Ulysses himself goes down.&quot;<br />
<br />
He&#39;d done that given his concerns that Ulysses was a were. If he was, he&#39;d be stronger than any normal human, and depending on what kind of were he might be, massively so. An officer from Moon Lake would likely also be a were and would be better prepared to deal with Lionel Ulysses. That made good sense to him, and thankfully, despite sounding tired, the Moon Lake Police Chief, O&#39;Hara, did agree to provide Teddy with an additional officer under Teddy&#39;s direct command for the ambush and to smooth things over with regard to the jurisdictional issues that would exist between Moon Lake and Seattle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Moon Lake PD?&quot; Agent Peters asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;For potential extra muscle and some inside knowledge on Ulysses,&quot; Teddy answered, &quot;it&#39;ll hopefully make things less violent than the might be as it is. Remember we want Ulysses alive to stand trail and face justice. If things go well, we won&#39;t have to kill him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure... but what about jurisdiction?&quot; Agent Peters asked as they made their way into the Field Office&#39;s parking garage.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Moon Lake officers will be directly attached to us and under our direct command,&quot; Teddy answered, &quot;in a sense we&#39;ve been allowed to deputize them for the mission.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that may work,&quot; Agent Peters commented, &quot;though it&#39;ll still rub the Seattle police the wrong way, just for warning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If it works and Ulysses and the Rat Pack are off the streets, they&#39;ll accept it,&quot;  Teddy answered.<br />
<br />
The walked along and prepared to move toward a lone unmarked car that Agent Peters and Agent Green would use to get to the McDonnalds. Several of the Field Office&#39;s parking spaces that were assigned to their agents were empty, which Teddy was sure meant that they had moved on to their positions with the Seattle PD to both be ready to move in to their ambush points. That gave Teddy some confidence, though Teddy soon found something that killed some of that optimism. They did have a visitor, and it was a visitor that Teddy expected, but not entirely. It was one marked police cruiser parked in the visiting parking space and on the side that Teddy could see was the words Moon Lake written in gold letters. Standing beside it was a lone man in plain clothes rather then a formal uniform, with a police badge pinned to his belt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Officer Ryan Connor,*&quot; the man introduced himself, &quot;Chief O&#39;Hara told me you could use an officer that could be more familiar with people from Moon Lake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We did... and do,&quot; Teddy commented, &quot;But I&#39;d thought there would be more officers...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have plenty of officers to keep an eye on things in case Ulysses comes into Moon Lake, but with some other issues going on, we can&#39;t be sending too many officers outside Moon Lake,&quot; Ryan Connor answered, &quot;But I can do my best. If he runs, I can run him down and give you the best catching him without major problems for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; Teddy sighed, &quot;better than nothing, I suppose. You will understand that you will be under our direct command in order to work with the jurisdiction issues between Seattle and Moon Lake?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, than you&#39;ll ride with us,&quot; Agent Peters instructed, &quot;and we can make our way to catch our guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Ryan answered.<br />
<br />
They climbed into the unmarked car that they would have. While Agent Peters drove, and Teddy rode in the front passenger seat, Teddy explained the ambush plan to Ryan Connor. The Moon Lake officer nodded and did understand the plan as Teddy explained it. He then agreed to do what he could, though he also assured Teddy that with the plan in place, that the ambush was likely to succeed and that it was doubtful that the Rat Pack as a group would truly fight and even Ulysses wouldn&#39;t fight back too hard without risking death. Fighting against the number of armed officers would surely invite getting shot. Teddy still stated that killing the Rat Pack was only to be a last resort.<br />
<br />
It took them a good fifteen minutes to reach the McDonnalds near the warehouse district and they found the Seattle PD detectives Francis Smith and Watson Holmes were actually waiting for them. They caught on to Ryan Connor&#39;s presence, and soon brought attention to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you get an additional agent, Agent Green?&quot; Detective Smith asked curiously as he held the door open for them as they went inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Teddy answered, &quot;someone who might be able to help us coral Ulysses and might be able to catch on to any potential surprises that Ulysses might have for us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is he from the bureau?&quot; Detective Holmes asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Moon Lake, actually, detectives,&quot; Ryan Connor spoke up, &quot;as part of an assignment to work with one of our neighboring towns and in a deputized capacity to Agent Green and the FBI. I&#39;m at your disposal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Detective Smith  commented, &quot;Is he wanted for anything in Moon Lake?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing on par with the murder of a US Marine,&quot; Ryan Connor answered, &quot;but I was asked to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He might be able to help get Ulysses to surrender,&quot; Teddy spoke, &quot;and he is under the FBI&#39;s direct command here.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Seattle detectives glanced to each other and nodded. Catching Ulysses was for the moment was more important than ego. Besides, Ryan Connor certainly looked strong enough to take on just about anyone without much difficulty.<br />
<br />
&quot;How goes the status of the planned sting?&quot; Teddy asked after a few moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re ready,&quot; Detective Smith pulled out a hand held walkie-talkie to present how they&#39;d stay in touch with the others.<br />
<br />
&quot;And everyone else is waiting in their ambush spots,&quot; Detective Holmes finished, &quot;The trap is set.&quot;<br />
<br />
Teddy smiled at that. Now all they had to do was wait to catch Ulysses.<br />
