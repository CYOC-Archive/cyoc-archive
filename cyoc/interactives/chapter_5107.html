<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Like Steve said, it is slowing down already,&quot; Paul lied.  &quot;I want to get home and gather my wits about me before we go seeing anyone who is going to poke or prod me.&quot;  Mike put a hand on Paul's shoulder and gave him a long, hard look.  Paul felt a fraction of an inch evaporate.  'Of course,' Paul thought, 'Steve's bull nuts are still in the room.  Let's get going...'  But what came out of his mouth was, &quot;Can you get my clothes?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike stood up and walked past to gather Paul's things.  Josh came to stand behind Paul and put a hand on each shoulder, &quot;I'll watch your back,&quot; he said with a smile.  &quot;Let's go.&quot;  Paul wondered why Josh was suddenly friendly, but they marched out the door and headed for Mike's car.  Paul felt a weight lift from his body as he moved away from Steve.  Somehow, he automatically knew that even with his reduced stature, Josh was going to be shrinking this afternoon.  He smiled.  Maybe he was getting the hang of this after all.<br />
<br />
Mike caught up before they reached the car.  &quot;You take our car,&quot; Mike instructed Josh.  &quot;I'll take Paul in his car.  Follow us.&quot;  Josh hesitated for a moment, and then let go of Paul to open the driver's side door of his car.  Paul watched as Josh moved the seat forward with a smile, and he got in the passenger side of his own car.<br />
<br />
Paul buckled himself in, and they were on their way.  They hadn't talked in a while, so there was some comfortable catching up to do -- Paul could talk about his kids, Mike about his work.  For a minute things relaxed and it seemed like shrinking had been forgotten.  As they eased their way out of the neighborhood and onto the city streets, Paul noticed Mike reach down to adjust his equipment.  Paul was feeling heavy again too, drawn to Mike's crotch.  His own loins stirred a little, and he shifted his T-shirt away from his slowly inflating dick, so the growing erection wouldn't be apparent.<br />
<br />
Paul put one hand on Mike's thick leg, and he felt a little jolt of power from the touch.  &quot;I really appreciate you taking care of me like this,&quot; Paul said.  Mike smiled at Paul, and completely encased the small hand with his own.<br />
<br />
Paul closed his eyes and felt his head swimming gently.  There was pressure on all sides of his body, and he felt his skin slip against Mike's hand and pants.  His dick got a little bit stiffer as he thought about how Mike's balls were shrinking him.  Yes, there was no doubt about it.  His inches were going, his cock was hardening.  Paul thought it would be unsettling if it wasn't so pleasurable.<br />
<br />
At the next stop light, Mike took his hand away from Paul's and undid the top button of his jeans.  He stuck his hand down his pants and started fishing around.  Paul saw the full head of Mike's boner emerge from the top of the elastic waistband.  &quot;You doin' ok over there, cowboy?&quot; Paul asked.  &quot;Need any help?&quot; he added with a chuckle.<br />
<br />
Mike blushed.  &quot;No, just itchy,&quot; Mike said.  &quot;I just need to get my shirt untucked,&quot; and with that Mike quickly removed his hand from his pants and covered himself with the end of his T-shirt.<br />
<br />
'So Mike has a woody too,' Paul thought as his own half-mast quickly unfurled to its entire eight inches... or however many were left.  Soon his brother's hand was back around his own, and Paul felt himself shrinking from the closeness.<br />
<br />
Soon they were pulling into Paul's driveway, and while Paul hesitated to let go of Mike, Josh was soon out of the other car and headed over.  Josh opened the door for Paul, and Paul wondered how obvious his boner would be with the flapping, growing T-shirt.  &quot;Smaller,&quot; was all Josh said when Paul stood up, and Mike looked over to see the lost inches too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's get inside,&quot; Mike said and quickly they were through the front door.<br />
<br />
Without a word, Paul headed straight for his bedroom.  It was getting late and his kids might come home at any time, which would cause a complete uproar.  Mike and Josh followed like leaves blowing in the wind, unsure of what to do but drawn up by Paul's wake.  Inside his room, Paul tossed his shirt aside and made a straight line for the master bathroom, attached to his bedroom, and closed the door.  Mike and Josh were left in the bedroom, and Josh closed the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you felt anything funny around Paul?&quot; Josh asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Funny like what?&quot; Mike asked, obviously uncomfortable with the question.  &quot;This whole situation is weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh grabbed the front of Mike's jeans, closing one hand around his partner's rock solid cock.  &quot;Funny like this,&quot; Josh whispered.  &quot;Funny like you want to suck the living cum right out of that hot little furball.  Funny like you want to shoot your big load all over his little body.&quot;  Josh low voice was almost a growl, &quot;Funny like I can't stop thinking about having sex with your brother!  That's funny like what I mean.&quot;  Josh looked away, a little startled by his outburst... but the pressure of his own dick only declined slightly.  &quot;I don't even like your brother,&quot; Josh added harshly, then softer, &quot;Or, I didn't before this afternoon.&quot;  His hands kept their grip on Mike's throbbing meat, as if to confirm that he wasn't going through this alone.<br />
<br />
Paul looked at himself in the mirror, or what was left of himself.  His nipples were at countertop-level, and soon he knew his chin would be.  His dick throbbed as big as ever, but more insistent than he could remember... his jack-off at Steve's had only given him a short break.  Sex had been the way out last time he shrank, with Matt.  He had been a lot smaller that time too.  Maybe if he could reproduce the same situation, it would be the way out this time too.<br />
<br />
He turned the large knob in his hand and stood in the bathroom doorway, full-on boner pointing at the large men.  They were standing close together, and Josh's hand was on the front of Mike's jeans.  Josh's mouth worked as he tried to say something, but Paul walked wordlessly up to his brother.  Josh eased back, but hung close.  Putting both hands into Mike's waistband, Paul gave a strong tug and shucked the pants and underwear off with a single motion.  <br />
<br />
What appeared to be a foot of meat sprang loose, suddenly freed.  Paul was surprised by his first full look at his brother's boner, not so much by the length, but the thickness.  For a moment, he tried to think of himself as the one who was shrinking, but that just seemed so academic.  There was a giant penis waving around in his face... and just seeing it was making him hornier.  He tried to wrap a fist around the head, but it was too big around.  Below, in a tight sack, rested two oversized balls.  They were obviously not as large as Steve's, but almost half his size was gone already.  These were the source of his shrinking, so Paul buried his face in them and felt his moustache tingle as it shrank against the soft, ruffled skin.</p>
