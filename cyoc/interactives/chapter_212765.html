<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff stared at the black furred buck for a moment, quickly putting two and two together.<br />
<br />
Somehow, the tailor had given Greg a completely different personality. Apparently he had fixed the niggling class problem, but still. Greg didn’t seem to really be in there any longer. That was the fate that would await Jeff if he stayed.<br />
<br />
“Fuck that!” Jeff turned to run, his fat rolls heaving as claws dug in the soft carpet below him.  Muscles coiled as Jeff tried to spring away – only for pain to shoot through his muzzle as he smacked straight into an invisible wall.<br />
<br />
Rubbing his aching muzzle, Jeff pressed his paw carefully against it. Where his paw touched, the light tingles of magic made his fur stand on end. He pressed against it hard, but his hand would go no further. <br />
<br />
“W-wall of Force?” Jeff turned, back to the wall, and stared in horror at the advancing stag. “You’ve gotta be kidding me! That’s a fifth level spell!”<br />
<br />
Glitz advanced, grabbing Jeff by the shoulders and forcing him to the ground. The bear tried to crawl away, but a  a hoofletted hand closed around his ankle in a vice-like grip. <br />
<br />
Jeff was shocked – given the size difference he should be able to break the halfstag like a twig.  Then he remembered where he was, and how the rules of this universe worked.  As big as Jeff was, he was a low level wizard who was built to be a wizard.  Glitz, on the other hand, was clearly a very high level NPC and who knew how he was built or what enchanted items he was wearing.<br />
<br />
“Come along now, we must prepare you for your fitting.” Glitz picked the bear up by the foot and dragged him off down the hall.<br />
<br />
“No! Please! I don’t wanna experience mind death! I love being a fat bear!” Jeff screamed, kicking at the buck.<br />
<br />
“Oh, do be quiet. You’ll love your new self.” Glitz gently chided. <br />
<br />
“I LIKE MY OLD SELF! HELP! HELP!” Jeff shouted, then turned and pointed at the stag. “FIREBOLT!”<br />
<br />
A paltry flame splashed against the stag’s jackets and smoked. The buck casually brushed it off.<br />
<br />
“No one can hear your screams.” Glitz pointed at the wall of force. “Blocks sound.”<br />
<br />
“Scorching Ra-Oof!” Jeff choked as the stag’s hoof kicked him in the stomach, knocking the wind out of him.<br />
<br />
“Enough of that. You’re grappled.” Glitz grinned toothily.<br />
<br />
“Please, I wanna be a wizard and break reality. Please please please.” Jeff begged.<br />
<br />
“So many wish they could do that. Alas, that is not your destiny.” Glitz grinned and his voice changed to Finn’s. “Because you didn’t fucking turn in your backstory!”<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry, I didn’-!” Jeff paused, then leveled an accusatory glare at Glitz. “Hey, wait a minute! I totally turned in my backstory yesterday, asshole!” <br />
<br />
“’I am Jeff, a fat bear wizard who likes to suck, fuck and eat butt’ is not a good background.” Glitz tossed the obese ursine into the Fitting Room. “You haven’t helped them at all. You said you’d warn them of all the dangers. Time for you to protect them from said dangers. Now back to letting the NPC take over.”<br />
<br />
“No, please! Finn!” Jeff begged.<br />
<br />
The stag paused.<br />
<br />
“Who’s Finn?” Glitz cocked his head, voice normal. “A friend of yours? They can’t save you. Now, hold still while I make you into a better you.”<br />
<br />
With a wave of his hand, the stag lifted the fat bear up and levitated him onto the pedestal in the middle of the room. Surrounded by mirrors, Jeff could see his obese body in stark detail.. He was incredibly overweight, with rolls on rolls overflowing on top of a tiny cock that he could feel throbbing in his sheathe.  Jeff realized that the sight of his own flabby, furry body was turning him on and the thought briefly flickered through his mind that he hoped that whatever he turned into would still find this hot.<br />
<br />
“I-I’ll do anything you want if you let me go.” Jeff pleaded. “You don’t need to alter my identity!”<br />
<br />
“Contingent Silence. Any speaking beyond answering my questions is now forbidden.” Glitz rolled his eyes, casting the spell as though it were nothing.<br />
<br />
Glitz circled the bear, tisking and taking his measurement. <br />
<br />
Jeff stared wildly at him, whimpering. His fingers wouldn’t move and he hadn’t taken Stilled Spell, which allowed casting somatic spells with only a word. All of his spells required him to be able to move his fingers. Plus, even if he HAD taken that feat, he was now silenced. He was utterly helpless. <br />
<br />
“This will be your new form.” Glitz said, holding out a foot-tall miniature of a well-dressed bear.<br />
<br />
Jeff gawped at it in abject horror.<br />
<br />
“But I’ll be so tiny!”<br />
<br />
“What?” Glitz blinked, staring at Jeff and then to the miniature. His eyes widened in slowly dawning realization. “A-are you serious?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t wanna be a foot tall!” Jeff wailed.<br />
<br />
“Just…I can’t...Please be quiet.” Glitz pressed a hoof to his temple. “You’ll be proper bear sized. This is just a model, you silly fat bear. I pity the poor soul who gets tailored into you.”<br />
<br />
“A-a model?” Jeff sniffed.<br />
<br />
“Yes.” Glitz grit his teeth. “Now, please look at it and tell me what adjustments you’d like to make. This is an opportunity for you to customize your new look.”<br />
<br />
“Uh. Okay. Well, first, he’s waaay too muscular for a wizard.” Jeff pointed out.<br />
<br />
“Correct. He’s not a wizard, he’s a bodyguard.”<br />
<br />
“Some bodyguard. Doesn’t even have scars.” Jeff scoffed. “He’s not wearing any armor, either.”<br />
<br />
“The clothing is reinforced. It counts as heavy armor.” Glitz explained, though scars appeared across the miniature’s body and a particularly deep one across one eye. “Anything else?”<br />
<br />
“Silk?” Jeff asked hopefully. “It feels good on my tits.”<br />
<br />
“Go fish.” Glitz rolled his eyes. <br />
<br />
Jeff could only watch as the stag walked over to the shelves and began pulling out materials and fabrics. He recognized the strands of adamantine in the cloth and realized Glitz hadn’t been lying about the armor. It was being used like Kevlar. In less than an hour, a proper suit had been crafted. It looked a bit like formal wear, something a butler might use, but the material was clearly of much higher quality than simple cloth or linen. <br />
<br />
Glitz approached Jeff with a white long-sleeved shirt, a pair of black pants and a black trench coat with two sets of five buttons running down both sides of its front, tails trailing down the back. The size was strangely too large in the chest and much too small in the waist.<br />
<br />
“Alright, this should stretch to fit you.” Glitz grinned and with a wave, released his hold on the fat bear. “If you co-operate, I will reward you with a modicum of your former personality.”<br />
<br />
Jeff eyed him warily, not sure if he believed the handsome stag. He simply gave a nod of understanding and slid the pants on first. They were extremely tight, puffing the legs out ridiculously and barely pulling over his wide rump. Glitz helped him slide on the boots and pull the suspenders up over his shoulders.<br />
<br />
The bear huffed wildly, feeling uncomfortable. His lower half was uncomfortably tight, so much so he could barely move from the spot. The fabric didn’t stretch, if anything, it got tighter, his ass and thighs jiggling within their confines. Strangely, the boots fit perfectly. <br />
<br />
“Shirt.” Glitz demanded.<br />
<br />
He grabbed the white shirt and pulled it over himself, finding it was tight around his middle. The buttons were practically about to pop off, while the chest area sagged loosely over his moobs. He turned stiffly to the deer, who was smirking at him.<br />
<br />
“Now what?” Jeff grunted.<br />
<br />
“T-pose, please. Let’s put your jacket on.” Glitz grinned.<br />
<br />
The stupid magic deer was clearly enjoying Jeff’s suffering. That black butler’s coat was obviously too small in the middle and far too wide in the chest and arms. Jeff sighed. Still, if he wanted to keep some of himself, he needed to co-operate. He begrudgingly raised his arms, finding it difficult to do with the shirt so tight.<br />
<br />
Glitz helped fit his first arm in. That was the easy part. The stag raised the arm of the other sleeve, preparing to put the fat bear’s other arm into it. He paused.<br />
<br />
“So, this is going to be very tight…bear with me, would you?” Glitz smirked.<br />
<br />
“Want me to suck in my gut?” Jeff rolled his eyes, reaching back and placing his arm inside the sleeve.<br />
<br />
“As much as you can, please.” Glitz nodded.<br />
<br />
Glitz pulled his arm through the sleeve. He came around the front of the fat bear and grinned, prodding Jeff’s fat gut. Jeff rolled his eyes and took a deep breath, trying to suck in his gut. It didn’t amount to much. Glitz grabbed both sides of the jacket and pulled it tightly, trying to fit them together, but they wouldn’t stretch around the bear’s fat gut.<br />
<br />
“Oh no!” Jeff wheezed. “Guess I’m too fat to be tailored!”<br />
<br />
The stag just gave him a wry smile and pulled a bit tighter, forcing the air out of Jeff’s lungs. The sides of the coat moved closer together. Glitz gave another tug and the white of Jeff’s shirt began to disappear under the black fabric, hiding the bear’s gut from view, making it appear smaller.<br />
<br />
“What the Hells?” Jeff gasped, trying to catch his breath.<br />
<br />
The displaced fat appeared to move up into Jeff’s chest, making his moobs appear to swell large and hard, like pillowy pecs. Jeff watched in amazement as the stag started buttoning up the fasteners of the butler’s coat. With every button, more of his huge gut was hidden and his upper body bloated huge and wide. <br />
<br />
Jeff could barely move, his body so tight. He breath came in shallow gasps. The bear attempted to push his belly out just to relieve the pressure a bit. To his shock, no matter how hard he pushed his belly out, the jacket held it firm in place. He moved his paws to examine his midsection and paused, staring at them.<br />
<br />
Instead of the fluffy brown bear fur, his paws were wide and covered in dense white fur. The tips of his fingers were tipped in razor sharp claws. Scars broke up the monotony of white, and the bones of his hands felt thick and gnarled. Jeff recalled that monks back on Earth would punch rocks, breaking their bones. The hairline fractures would fill in. They repeated the process until their hands were basically bony clubs.<br />
<br />
Jeff glanced down past his heaving chest, which was feeling less tight the longer he stood there, to his pants. His waist had narrowed enough that he could now see past the bump of his musclegut to a heavy bulge where his small cock and balls used to be. Jeff realized the pants were no longer too tight, they were perfectly sculpted to his muscled thighs and bubble butt. A little white tail stuck out through an opening just above his ass crack. <br />
<br />
“P-Polar bear?” Jeff’s voice cracked and shifted deeper and rougher. <br />
<br />
The tightness the bear had felt finally faded. Instead, this new body felt powerful. Even as he stood there, more of his fat melted away, replaced by heaving mounds of muscle. The deer finished buttoning his butler’s uniform and even his musclegut began to fade to barely a bump of heavy abdominals. <br />
<br />
“Yes. I thought you would be a better match for a white-furred mink.” Glitz nodded sagely. “Now for the finishing touches.”<br />
<br />
With a flourish, the buck produced a simple black tie. <br />
<br />
“Doesn’t it feel good Geoffrey?” Glitz said, looping the tie around Jeff’s neck.<br />
<br />
“It’s Jeff.” Jeff growled, his voice deep.<br />
<br />
“Not for long.” Glitz winked and began the actual process of tying the tie.<br />
<br />
Jeff gulped as he watched the white fur creep up out of the neckline of this suit and toward his chin. He felt his cock harden and droop down the leg of his suit, the outline lewd in the mirror. He hated that he enjoyed being so vulnerable to the handsome stag. That was his punishment for being a filthy degenerate.<br />
<br />
The stag began to cinch the tie. Geoff immediately felt his thoughts begin to scramble as memories began to leak in. His life training to defend his lithe, sexy Prince. How wonderful serving Master Gregory felt-especially attending to his...personal needs. White fur surged up over his chin. Fat began to recede, giving away to corded muscles that the fur barely concealed. His skull creaked as it grew larger, his face slimming though his muzzle grew longer. To Geoffrey’s horror, his thoughts began to slow down.<br />
<br />
“Not my brain!” Geoffrey begged as the tie began to cinch around his neck.<br />
<br />
Though his skull grew larger, more fitting for the polar bear’s body, the bone was growing thicker. Geoffrey could feel his eyebrows grow thick and heavy, giving his much more prominent brow ridge more emphasis. They settled like to black, furry caterpillars over his eyes, making him look rather dumb but oddly cute and expressive. Scars crisscrossed his muzzle, his memories shifting, remembering every fight that they came from. <br />
<br />
Then the vision in his left eye went out as a heavy scar appeared over his face. Geoffrey reached up a huge paw to feel it, seeing the milky white orb in the mirror. A fierce pride gripped him as he remembered receiving it while defending his liege’s life. Geoffrey tried to fight the memories but the pressure on his brain was increasing the tighter the tie became. It wouldn&#39;t be so bad if his life as a fat nerdy bear on Earth wasn&#39;t being forced out with each new memory.<br />
<br />
“Just relax. You don’t need to think so much. You just need to be a good bodyguard.” Glitz said, rubbing his hoofletted hand over Geoffrey’s stiff cock.<br />
<br />
The polar bear groaned at the delightful feeling of the stag’s hooves on his big fat cock. He wanted to so badly to let go, but a voice was there in the back of his mind, screaming to not give in. Geoffrey was a kind bear who helped those in need, so it gave him some pause. He wanted to help that sad voice, but there was just too little space in the overly-muscled polar bear’s brain to contain two personalities. One of them had to go.<br />
<br />
“Please.” Geoffrey begged. Then he groaned in delight as the stags hand traveled up and down his cock. The halfstag&#39;s touch was electric, soon reducing him to lewd moans. &quot;Oh, please, please, please!&quot;<br />
<br />
“How polite.” Glitz grinned and continued tightening the tie, hand rubbing the bear’s twitching log of a cock through his pants. “Almost done.”<br />
<br />
Geoffrey moaned in despair and delight as his brain was squeezed. He desperately wanted to buck his hips into the buck’s clever hands, remove the voice in the back of his mind. The buck&#39;s hand was a blur now and all Geoffrey could do was moan, powerful muscles twitching, writhing in Glitz&#39; grasp, his balls feeling so full. He could see himself, the big polar bear in the mirror with the impossibly massive muscles and ruggedly handsome good looks, even in spite of the scar, was someone most people would wish to be. With his tongue lolling out and his expressive brows lowering over his eyes as his skull compacted further, Geoffrey just looked so dumb, so needy, so desperate to serve-<br />
<br />
“I-I can’t hold on!” Geoffrey roared in despair.<br />
<br />
“I know.” Glitz smiled and cinched the tie tight in one quick move.<br />
<br />
Geoffrey’s eyes rolled into the back of his head as his brain shrank one last time. He took a deep breath and roared a wordless, desperate cry as he came. Whatever was left of Jeff began to spurt out in thick ribbons of rich polar bear spunk, splashing the mirrors in translucent white goo. Despite bringing him to orgasm, Glitz was relentless, his hooves pumping the ursine&#39;s thick cock.<br />
<br />
The polar bear could only moan, helpless to stop the stag from milking his old personality out of him. His nipples were hard as rocks despite the terror of losing his self, but with each spurt of cum the stag coaxed out of him, the more the fear abated. Geoffrey couldn’t help but buck in the deer’s grasp for relief from the pressure in his head. It all felt too good, he just wanted to be dumb and happy and to serve his liege like a good servant.<br />
<br />
Eventually, the pressure in his head abated. The buck below him continued pumping until his balls were completely drained and his cock was oversensitive. Geoffrey sagged as he was lowered to the floor and released from the magical bonds that had gripped him. Glitz was eyeing him critically and still stroking his cock. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let go.&quot; Glitz said firmly, slowly jacking Geoffrey off.<br />
<br />
The polar bear moaned and hung his head over the buck&#39;s shoulder. The deer&#39;s other hand wandered to his muscular ass and gently squeezed it. Geoffrey shuddered and came one last time onto the stag&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;There we go.&quot; Glitz pulled away and looked into Geoffrey&#39;s eyes before nodding. &quot;All done!&quot;<br />
<br />
Glitz&#39;s hand was still gripping Geoffrey&#39;s cock. He gently batted the deer’s hand away. Then he stood up and brushed his jacket off. His shoes squished as he took his first step. The bear looked down at the cum oozing down his leg.<br />
<br />
&quot;Prestidigitation.&quot; Glitz snapped his fingers. The cum vanished, leaving the bear perfectly presentable. &quot;Welcome back Geoffrey. Would you like something to eat?&quot;<br />
<br />
“Thank you, but I do believe my friends are waiting for me.” The polar bear said in deep but respectful tones.<br />
<br />
“Of course, Geoffrey. I didn’t mean to hold you up.” Glitz smiled and bowed. “Please be on your way.”<br />
<br />
Geoffrey bowed back and walked stiffly out of the room. <br />
<br />
The stag chuckled as he watched the new body guard leave, the bear&#39;s muscular ass swaying and bouncing with each step. He picked up the fat bear’s miniature and brought it over to a shelf labeled ‘Punishment’. Glitz paused, staring at Jeff&#39;s figurine. Something about it seemed...off.<br />
<br />
 As soon as he was out of earshot, Jeff chuckled and pumped his fists in the air. <br />
<br />
He’d won! That stupid sexy deer was no match for Geoff-er, Jeff’s intellect! Jeff had barely managed to punt the polar bear’s submissive and overly protective personality out of his mind at the last moments. Thinking was admittedly much harder now, and his memories of earth were basically gone, completely replaced by Geoffrey’s past, but his personality was still here, interlaced with the bodyguard’s. After doing a little victory dance, he straightened out his outfit and strode to the drawing room where the rest of his party was lounging.<br />
<br />
Glitz smirked from around the corner, watching the polar bear do a silly little dance of victory in the middle of the hallway.<br />
<br />
He’d followed after the polar bear after he’d put Jeff’s miniature away and realized the expression on its face was oddly servile. Meaning the stupid wizard may have actually beaten him, something Glitz simply wouldn&#39;t let stand! The stag observed the bear silently, watching the figure straighten his outfit almost robotically, and shook his head. Enough of Geoffrey had survived that Jeff was screwed, though he clearly didn’t know it yet. <br />
<br />
For now, Jeff was still himself. But people were shaped by their memories, and all the memories Jeff had to draw on now were the polar bear’s. Eventually, Jeff would simply be Geoffrey, a rather dumb polar bear body guard. Or…he supposed he could get the bear’s miniature and quietly tailor the rest of Jeff away. But this was much more fun. <br />
<br />
Glitz picked up a tray of snacks and plastered on a smile before walking to the drawing room.</p>
