<br />
Max had decided to keep n eye on the two dog herms. &quot;I better keep them out of trouble&quot; She kissed Patrick and went to the living room. Patrick then knocked on his sister&#39;s door. &quot;come in&quot; a deep manly voice answered from the other side. Pulling the door open Patrick, Han, and Max were shocked. While Patrick expected Mary to have changed from the cute fourteen-year-old girl he knew this was a shocker. A twenty-foot-tall neon blue and green kitsune sat in the middle of the room in ripped clothing. Patrick realized this giant looked like one of Mary&#39;s drawings. &quot;hey bro can you use your leaf on me?&quot; the kitsune giant asked. It seemed like Chucky and Lucy Mary had developed a new life in his head. &quot;Mary?&quot; Patrick asked only to receive a laugh in response. &quot;come on bro don&#39;t joke like that&quot; the kitsune laughed as Han pulled out a leaf and placed it on Mary. In a puff of smoke, he had shrunk to seven feet. He now wears a sleeveless grey t-shirt with matching armbands, black shorts, and training socks. Patrick recognized this from the drawing his sister had once shown him. With the expectation that his clothes looked very tight on him causing both his muscles and cock to be clearly defined. &quot;sorry that&#39;s as far I can shrink you down. I need more practice before I can do these things better.&quot; Han apologized. &quot;no worries bro, my kitsune powers are still coming in myself&quot; The sixteen-year-old rubbed the top of the Tanuki&#39;s head while bending down a great deal. &quot;Kevin?&quot; Patrick asked causing the kitsune to turn his head. &quot;yes&quot; Kevin responded. Now Patrick was sure, his sister had been fully transformed into her character. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Mary couldn&#39;t explain it. She just had the urge to draw Kevin again. Being an up-and-coming artist she did many drawings. However, Kevin the muscled kitsune was always at the top of her drawing influences. She even did some... let&#39;s just say not public drawings of him. This was one of them. Hence, she had to do it so late at night that no one would come in and see it. She had just drawn the last bulging vein on his neon cock when she heard a window smash open. She turned in her chair concerned at what caused it. She suddenly felt hot and went to open the window. The second she looked up at the moon she felt something else though. She felt extremely horny. Her mind was overcome with lusting images of Kevin. She didn&#39;t even notice when the drawing&#39;s ink left the paper and was absorbed into her. Her clothes warped into Kevin&#39;s ensemble. Her body then began growing as neon blue fur covered her bulging muscles. She gained a muscular v as each muscle bulged and became impossibly dense.  <br />
<br />
Not even a bullet could penetrate her new body. Below her elbows and knees, neon green fur grew in a jagged pattern. Her hands grew larger as white fur covered them and her forearms. Each nail sharpened into black claws as neon green pads appeared on her palms and soles. Unlike her hands, black fur grew across her calves and paws. At this point, her clothing had ripped revealing large paws for her feet. Her breasts reformed into strong pecs as white fur covered everything from the sides of her muzzle to his inner thighs. A jagged neon green line of fur separated the white and neon blue fur as her nipples became neon green. Her chair broke causing a shortfall. She didn&#39;t care as this whole time she had been pleasuring her growing clit. It shifted to a human dick when it reached six inches and began to turn green. His balls pushed out of his closing pussy and were quickly covered in thick white fur. They didn&#39;t stop swelling until they were the same length as Mary&#39;s original stance. His yoga ball-sized nuts were churning pre out his neon green dick as it shifted to a canine shape at two feet. It then began to glow brightly as it reached five feet. Its veins bulged as he unleashed a flood of cum beneath his lifted desk. His tail grew out as he did so. his neon blue fur was stopped halfway by neon green fur and ended with fluffy white. His black eyebrows and deep blue eyes were all that remained of his original body. His hair shrank into his fur revealing black fixed ears with white insides. Kevin slept like this for hours. As he did memories of his new life replaced his old ones. He was jolted awake by a knock on the door. Thankfully his cock was soft so he was able to get it out from his broken desk and shifted to face the door. &quot;come in&quot; he said while wiping the sleep from his eyes. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;um... can you go to the living room? we need to have a meeting&quot; Patrick said to his brother. &quot;sure thing, I&#39;ll make some breakfast for us first though. don&#39;t want Drake to burn us cause he&#39;s hangry&quot; Kevin jabbed his elbow into Patrick&#39;s shoulder before chuckling, and walking out of the room. &quot;so I&#39;m guessing drake next&quot; Han asked as he pointed to the last bedroom. &quot;his name was Devon so brace your selves.&quot; Patrick then walked to his brother&#39;s or rather youngest brother&#39;s room. He didn&#39;t like how all their bedrooms faced the moon&#39;s path in the sky. Knocking on the door he heard a scuffling sound followed by a bang and some things falling. &quot;ow...&quot; was all Patrick needed to open his brother&#39;s door. He wasn&#39;t surprised to see a sixteen-year-old dragon in place of his twelve-year-old brother. &quot;who are you&quot; Despite the cool-looking appearance he still acted like a scared kid. &quot;Drake?&quot; Patrick asked. &quot;who?&quot; the dragon asked. Patrick decided on a different name &quot;Devon?&quot;. This caused the dragon to back away in shock. &quot;how do you know my name&quot; he actually looked like bursting into tears before fire accidentally escaped his lips when he said &#39;name&#39;. &quot;Devon it&#39;s okay I changed last night too. I was Patty and this&quot; he gestured to Han &quot;Was Mom&quot; The dragon leaned against his desk and held his head. &quot;what happened to us&quot; he suddenly demanded with a face of anger. This was quickly replaced with concern. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry. if feels like there&#39;s some other version of me saying that,&quot; Devon said. &quot;it&#39;s okay we will all talk about it in the living room&quot; Patrick explained. &quot;there better be food&quot; &#39;Devon&#39; said. His expression quickly turned to embarrassment as he said &quot;I hope someone can explain this&quot; Devon then left the room. His stride kept going from awkward to prideful every couple of seconds. &quot;so any thoughts on what going on with him?&quot; Han asked. Patrick shrugged his shoulders and spoke &quot;Devon liked dragons so maybe that has something to do with it&quot; The two followed Devon and went to the living room. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Now Devon was quite the sound sleeper. No noise save for his alarm could wake him up. So when a loud crash happened Devon did little more than shift under his sheets. Through his blinds, however, streaks of moonlight landed on his right arm and face from these exposed areas blue fur would grow over scales equal in durability to titanium. His nails grew into sharp black nails as dull yellow fur grew around his new pads. An orange crescent appeared on the back of his hand while three jagged orange lines of fur grew on his shoulder. While this happened Devon&#39;s face pushed into a cool-looking muzzle and a horn painlessly pushed out of his skin between his nostrils. His upper canines pushed past his gums and were visible in front of the dull yellow of his bottom jaw. Orange markings littered his face as a brush of dull yellow appeared around the bottoms of his eyes. His ears expanded and became large pointed ovals with dull yellow insides. Just above them, two ivory horns grew above his head piercing his pillow and mattress without waking him.  <br />
<br />
Once his changes hit his neck a thick plume of fur obscured it like a lion&#39;s mane. His left arm then began to change to match its counterpart. Devon&#39;s body began to age as the changes passed over him. he shifted to his side when his back felt uncomfortable. This was the result of two large feathery wings similar looking to bluebirds. He soon gained a swimmer&#39;s build despite never having a passion for swimming. Dull yellow covered his front and went between his legs. His cock became inhuman as the tip became like a spear and ridges ran down its underside. Right after it developed a large knot his balls were sucked into him and became internal. A slit even formed around his cock to hide it whenever he wasn&#39;t aroused. Which wasn&#39;t right now. His once innocent dreams were becoming way more adult. In his dream, he went from saving a princess from a dragon to using his dragon meat to make her a female dragon while she sucked the other dragon off. From his ass, a long furry tail grew matching the rest of his fur color. Even a strip of black fur covered the topside to match his head hair. His legs broke the wooden baseboard of the bed revealing large paws for feet. Two orange crescents grew on the top while the toes gained dull yellow fur and dark claws.  <br />
<br />
The sixteen-year-old then cummed in his sleep blissfully unaware he was a 6&#39;10&quot; dragon anthro with some room to grow still. He woke up when his alarm let out its usual noise. He slammed his hand on it only to hear an awful metallic crunch. He opened his eyes to reveal a yellow iris on a black backdrop. He looked at the destroyed alarm clock in chock and reached to touch it. Only to stop as he saw his larger blue hand. This jolted him awake and he rose quickly. He then realized he could still feel his pillow on his head and reached for it. After a loud rip, his pillow came off in pieces. He then noticed his broken bed and new form. Just as he started to hyperventilate thoughts began to assault his mind. I&#39;m a dragon now. &#39;Finally, I have the body I always deserved&#39;. &#39;bet all the ladies will love Drake now&#39;. That last one confused him as he knew his name was Devon. He then realized he had hit snooze or at least tried to. The wall clock told him it was lunchtime. He then heard a knock on the door. He stood up only to be thrown off by his new horns, tail, and wings. He stumbled into his shelf and a snow globe hit his foot and shattered. Despite what should have been deep cuts Devon found himself simply yelling out &quot;ow&quot; before the door opened. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;...and that&#39;s when we came to the living room&quot; Patrick finished. Kevin seemed unconvinced about his past while Chucky seemed to accept whatever her master said. Lucy meanwhile was putting the dishes in the dishwasher. Max and Han meanwhile were silent and knew Patrick was telling the truth. &quot;you&#39;re pulling my leash right?&quot; Kevin sat on the couch with his arms behind his back. &quot;it&#39;s true you idiot! you think were born like this!&quot; Devon yelled with smoking nostrils only to look ashamed afterwards. &quot;sorry&quot; he mumbled while eating his eggs. A knock on the door alerted them to Doctor Taylor. So far it had been two hours since they each told what they could remember of the last twelve hours. Lucy rushed over before Max could grab her. The husky herm then opened the door. &quot;you must be the vet lady they told us about&quot; Lucy mentioned. Max, Pat, and Devon all looked embarrassed with Devon smacking his head. He pulled back after being poked by the horn on his muzzle. Doctor Taylor seemed undisturbed by the naked herm and introduced herself and Celina.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve been informed about the rules of this visit&quot; she announced to the group. They nodded in understanding. &quot;okay then I&#39;ll need samples from each of you. I&#39;ll give them to my assistant who will take them to the mobile lab outside. Then I&#39;ll need to interview you all alone to see what has changed about you both physically and mentally&quot; Doctor Taylor finished her brief recap. Max being the oldest by a month gave a sample of hair, saliva, and blood. Each of the others did the same except for Devon. His needle did little more than give him a slight pain each time they attempted to insert it. Eventually one of his episodes happened in which he grabbed the needle and destroyed it with little effort. He then picked up the agent who had held the needle and held him by his shirt collar above him. As quickly as this had shown up Devon looked ashamed at this and set the man down gently. Doctor Taylor wrote down this incident for later examination. Once this was done each of the Williams&#39;s were sent to an individual room for Doctor Taylor to talk to. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Two hours later Celina and Doctor Taylor arrived back at the base. Simon greeted them before noticing the government vans behind their lab. &quot;did they all have to come?&quot; Simon asked as he saw the Williams and Max walk out of the vans. Devon was on his own and an extremely broken straight jacket hung loosely around his neck and arms. Despite this Devon looked upset at himself. &quot;each of them is now sixteen years old and several of them have a complete mental rewrite&quot; Doctor Taylor then told them to move them to the west wing of the hospital. She then went to her office and began to audio logs. She picked up Max&#39;s file and began to read.  <br />
<br />
Max Carson:<br />
age: 16<br />
location at the point of transformation: Cliffton suburbs<br />
Status of changes: complete gender change as well as personality change. Will also change into a grey-furred werewolf at night.<br />
Mental state: Miss Carson seems mentally fine while in her human form. Mei her werewolf form on the other hand is a different story. By both accounts, Max and her former girlfriend, Mei immediately got Patricia into the path of the moon&#39;s glow. It&#39;s unclear if Mei knew the moon would change Patrica or not. <br />
<br />
Nicole sighed as she would have to wait until nighttime to talk to Mei. Even then it was dangerous given how Mei willingly changed Patricia into Patrick, speaking of Mr. Williams had his file next. <br />
<br />
Patricia &#39;Patty&#39; Williams: now known by Patrick &#39;Pat&#39; Williams<br />
age: 16<br />
location at the point of transformation: Clifton suburbs, Williams household<br />
status of changes: is now a male jock type and unofficial alpha of the group. Partick will change into a male eight-foot were-fox at night. Personality doesn&#39;t seem to change but libido will at night. <br />
Mental state: Patrick seems unbothered by his changes and even acknowledges that it is a result of his mind changing. <br />
<br />
From how the household listened to him, Patrick being an alpha would be a possibility. Chucky and Lucy seemed to have unwavering loyalty to him. It was unclear if he and Max would still date, but he seemed positive about it. <br />
<br />
Hannah Williams: Han Williams <br />
age:16<br />
location at the point of transformation: Cliffton suburbs, Williams house<br />
status of changes: is now a three-foot male tanuki wearing only underwear. He has changed his appearance by adding a black T-shirt and red shorts along with sandals. Han now has the power of transformation using leaves he conjures.<br />
Mental state: the subject&#39;s mind has been wiped clean of all memories before the change.  <br />
<br />
It was upsetting that Han had lost his previous life. He wasn&#39;t even granted a new one from the moon&#39;s power. Hopefully, he&#39;ll either get new memories or his old ones will eventually come back to him. The next file was opened. <br />
<br />
Chuck and Lucy: Chucky and Lucy Williams <br />
age: 16<br />
location at the point of transformation: Clifton suburbs<br />
status of changes: both have become anthro herm dogs. Lucy remained a husky while Chuck became a German shepherd herm named Chucky. <br />
Mental state: Both now believe that they are Patrick William&#39;s pets. They are extremely loyal and will obey any command except clothing. Both now believe they are each other&#39;s mate. Lucy is dominant and bold. Chucky is submissive and hates the idea of letting down his &#39;master&#39;. <br />
<br />
Honestly, Hannah would probably be mortified to see what had become of her husband. As for Lucy, the first meeting Doctor Taylor had with her was... unforgettable. Regardless the two do seem to love each other. She picked up Patrick&#39;s former sister&#39;s file next. <br />
<br />
Mary Williams: Kevin &#39;the Kitsune&#39; Williams<br />
age: 16<br />
location at the point of transformation: Cliffton Suburbs <br />
status of changes: Kevin is a twenty-foot kitsune with supposed magical abilities. His fur is mostly neon blue and neon green with white and back fur. His cock is the size of a human and glows like plutonium. No radioactivity had been found emitting off it though. he was able to shrink to a large but movable state with the help of Han. His form is based on one of Mary&#39;s most drawn characters.<br />
Mental state: Kevin has no memories of Mary or his previous life. He now believes he was born with his three brothers (Han being one of them). He is also calling Devon Drake for some unknown reason. <br />
<br />
According to Patrick Kevin looks like Mary&#39;s favorite character but jacked. His personality is a mix of a jock and a kind man. From his interview doctor Taylor got to see exactly how large he could get and how strong he was. Picking up the final file Nicole sighed as this was the second subject to have this problem. She read aloud for the audio to pick up. <br />
<br />
Devon Williams: <br />
age: 16<br />
location of transformation: Cliffton Suburbs <br />
Status of changes: He is now a 16-year-old dragon with seemingly impenetrable skin. His scales are hidden by thick fur and his balls have become internal.  <br />
Mental state: While his memories are unaffected, the same can not be said for his personality. He will have these sudden mood swings either by chance or by a trigger of some sort. It is believed he has the same fate as Maxwell Shelton. His new dragon instincts and testosterone are mixing with his personality. <br />
<br />
Doctor Taylor then ended the recording. So far this has been the largest amount of people changed. The only factor known was that a person who had transformed last month had been present this month. If that were the case several other people would be changed by being near those who changed the previous month. Such is not the case though. Regardless doctor Taylor had noticed some similarities. While each change was different each one had similarities to Max&#39;s change. Patrick is the most direct becoming a were-fox. This was combined with his love of foxes. Next Han became a mythical tanuki with mental changes. The leaves in the kitchen plus proximity to Mei might have been a factor. Chucky and Lucy became anthros with psychological changes. Kevin had become his drawing and Devon&#39;s love of dragons would fit previous observations. Doctor Taylor hoped she could find a cure or help them adjust to their new forms before the next full moon.</p>
