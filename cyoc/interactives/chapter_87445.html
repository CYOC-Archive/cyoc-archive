<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aidan had an idea.  Geoff wouldn&#39;t feel so bad if he weren&#39;t alone in all this...  He was going to try being fat at some point anyway, why not now?  He booted up the chronivac and scanned.  A ton of options appeared for the people in the busy pub.  Geoff&#39;s name near the top, with the notation &quot;currently transformed&quot; next to it.  Aidan scrolled through and found his name.<br />
<br />
Name: Aidan Sterns<br />

<br />
He knew how to do it now.  He dove into the weight section and notched it all the way up to 525 pounds.  Geoff might feel good if he was the thinner of the two of them.  He darted through the same options he had earlier, giving himself the same overall treatment he&#39;d given Geoff.  Reduced fitness.  The same note popped up to tell him that any negative issues he may experience relating to his fitness were pure simulation, and that he was safe. He made sure his clothes would grow with him. Then, the advanced awareness options.  He found a radial button to choose his level of awarness, specifying &quot;partial awareness&quot;.  Another note popping up &quot;Partial awareness is an option only available to users who are changing themselves.  It will allow the user to experience new memories, and feel they are true, but be aware that they are currently transformed and may return to normal with the use of the chronivac.  Individuals aside from the user will have their perception altered to suit the users new memories.&quot;<br />
<br />
Good. Aidan smirked to himself.  If he wanted Geoff to not feel so alone in this, he had to experience it himself.  He copied and pasted his description of Geoff&#39;s new memories and started to edit them slightly.  When he was done, the text box had a wall of text reading out his new story.<br />
&quot;It was only months ago that Aidan decided to take the plunge and visit a gay bar with his friend Geoff and his other friends, they showed up early, only to find the other guys had to bail. Not one to be shy of strangers, Geoff met a guy a little older than him and hit it off, and brought Aidan around to make it a trio. All three were laughing and telling stories into the night. The man invited them back to his place for some night time swimming, and with the hot and sticky weather, they took him up on it. This little visit, however, became a much longer stay when Aidan awoke the next morning to find himself strapped to some table with a tube down his throat. The man they&#39;d chatted with all night was across the room, standing by Geoff, who was strapped to an identical table. By his side was a complicated machine. Without a word, the man flicked it on, and a heavy, chocolatey slop pulsed through the tube, into Geoff&#39;s flat, tight stomach, causing it to quickly bow out.   Then the man realized Aidan was awake, and sauntered over, turning on an identical machine to his right, and quickly, Aidan filled out, keeping pace with Geoff. Something buzzed around his cock at a low speed that became faster the fuller he got, keeping him hard, and only allowing him release when he was full. This became routine, and over the next few months he and Geoff watched each other change from lean young men to enormous, soft blobs that jiggled with every movement. Now, at 525 pounds and out of shape, his captor has released him, and he is slowly trying to get back to a normal life. Except now, he&#39;s been trained. He craves more weight, and someone to gain it with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Content, Aidan nodded his head and pressed the start button.  With a groan, he felt the change begin.  His flat stomach quickly plumping out, making an arch over his waistband.  Geoff was chatting with him as if nothing was wrong.  Aidan could feel his memories seeming to fall out of brain as some new ones crammed in to replace them.  The bearded, ball cap wearing bear of a man talking to them the night they met.  The cool feeling of a swim in the dark.  Then, the painful sensation of a stomach pushed to it&#39;s limits.  Day in day out, pumped full of food, and watching himself in a nearby mirror as he turned to jelly.  Then the memories of the bearded man telling him that he likes feeling fat, how he wants more of it.  How he wishes he&#39;d gotten bigger so much earlier, because he&#39;d be so far ahead by now.  How these little chats seemed to cement themselves in his mind as he became obsessed with his own weight gain.  How he and Geoff just happened to wake up in their own apartments one day, as if nothing had happened, aside from the hundreds of extra pounds they now carried.  How just this morning he peered over his stomach to see 525 on the scale and felt disappointed that it wasn&#39;t more.<br />
<br />
While those memories slipped into place, so did a new physical body.  Aidan was now enormous, heavier than Geoff.  His stomach pressed up against the edge of the table.  His clothing, while tight, draped over some of his thinner spots.  He&#39;d had a hard time finding anything to fit since being let go.  Always tight across his now formidable man boobs.  His belly always finding a way to work itself out from under the fabric of his shirt.  And he was always a little aware, now, of the folds and pinches on his side where his body seemed to rub up against or spill over itself.<br />
<br />
&quot;I still think the guys cancelled cause we weird them out now.&quot;  Geoff said, snapping Aidan out of his daydreaming.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.  Me too.  They&#39;ve been weird ever since we got back.&quot;  Aidan said, absentmindedly playing with his belly.  &quot;I think they&#39;re worried they&#39;ll catch our fat or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Geoff laughed &quot;I actually think you&#39;re right.  They don&#39;t know what to think.  They wouldn&#39;t have believed that story if it was just one of us saying it, but both?  No denying it.  And with how much we&#39;ve put on, they probably think that guy injected us with a fat virus or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aidan shrugged.  He knew the chronivac was probably responsible for his current size, but still, his memories felt very real. &quot;Maybe, we don&#39;t know what was in that chocolate goop.&quot;  They both laughed, but said nothing for a moment.  Geoff was biting his lip a bit, uncomfortably.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... uh, any progress on the weight loss?&quot;  Aidan said, trying to start the conversation up again.  <br />
<br />
Geoff shook his head, and finally broke his silence. &quot;I don&#39;t think I want to lose it.&quot;  He blurted out, turning red. <br />
<br />
Aidan laughed a little awkwardly.  &quot;Actually... uh... me either...  I guess he said all that stuff to you about needing it, too, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Geoff nodded again, second chin wiggling.  &quot;Yeah.  When I woke up at home, none of that chocolate stuff to eat, I actually felt a little sad.&quot;  He went quiet for a moment &quot;I kind of wish he hadn&#39;t let us go...  think how big we could be now if he kept us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aidan&#39;s mind instantly shifted to a picture of he and Geoff, twice this size, easily, greedily slurping down that tube of chocolately fluid. Pinned down by their own excessive weights, happy to be growing larger by the minute.  His cock was hard between his thunderous thighs.  Geoffs face showed he was too. &quot;You know.&quot; Aidan said, as non-chalantly as he could. &quot;I can&#39;t even eat without getting hard now.  Or vice versa.  I can&#39;t even look in the mirror without thinking I&#39;m too small, and that just makes me want some junk food from the fridge.  I&#39;ve been trying not to give in.  It&#39;s not normal to want this... but...&quot;  He trailed off.  <br />
<br />
Geoff looked like he understood.  &quot;Yeah...  it&#39;s not... but we do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aidan thought a moment &quot;So, let&#39;s stop torturing ourselves over it.&quot;  Geoff&#39;s face lit up, intrigued, hopeful maybe.  Aidan continued &quot;Let&#39;s just... go for it.  We won&#39;t be as effective at it, I&#39;m guessing, and people are going to talk about us if we do it... but who cares, we&#39;ll be getting bigger, and that&#39;s what&#39;s really important, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Geoff broke into a full, beaming grin.  His chubby cheeks still red.  &quot;Yeah.  Let&#39;s go for it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Aidan raised his hand and flagged down a waitress, ordering the pair as many desserts as the money they had on hand could afford them.</p>
