<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The book blinded the family once again and everyone stumbled backwards from the light. They had hoped that they&#39;d be prepared for it by this point, but even if they closed their eyes they were still somehow blinded by the light. Alan, stumbled the farthest, and managed to open his eyes enough to stumble to the nearest bathroom.<br />
<br />
He laid his hands on the edge of the sink and braced himself as he felt nauseous. The nausea went away and his vision thankfully returned. Still with his head down, he sighed in relief as the pain left. Unfortunately, his joy turned to frustration as he saw his fingers were still manicured and painted. <br />
<br />
Looking up, he was shocked to see that he was no longer a cheerleading teenaged girl, but was a middle aged woman! The woman in the mirror was still fairly attractive for her age with long, curly blond hair tied up in a messy ponytail, and just the right amount of makeup. She was thick as well, with massive thighs and tits that came along with multiple kids. She looked like an adult version of the female Alan. He nearly screamed as he gripped his massive ass in shock at how old he had gotten.<br />
<br />
Alan walked out to see the rest of the family got matching changes. Megan was now crying while sitting on the counter. Alan at least assumed it was Megan, as who he actually saw was a tall, brown haired man with a pretty damn good physique, and unfortunately, a fairly large dick from what was able to be seen through the boxers he/she was wearing.<br />
<br />
There was now a teenaged girl standing where Alan&#39;s father had been. She was pretty with light brown hair unnaturally curled past her shoulders, with a cute skirt and top to match. She had a fairly nice figure as well, and was currently staring in frustration at herself, and Alan figured this was because &quot;she&quot; was really his father, who was not happy to be right.<br />
<br />
Janet was next to him, but now she was a 12 year old boy. He was wearing some Green bay jersey and jeans with messy brown hair. He looked like he could have been the younger version of the masculine Janet, right down to the face. If this kid could grow a beard, it would look a lot like &quot;Jake&quot; did. Ironically, Janet&#39;s prepubescent boy face looked a lot like her old face, so at least she recognized herself better in the mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great.&quot; Alan sighed. &quot;We&#39;re back to normal and I&#39;ve always been a woman.&quot; He said before immediately slapping his hand over his mouth. He had meant to say nothing of the sort, but for some reason, his voice betrayed him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about hon-&quot; Megan began before stopping herself as well. She had wanted to call him dork, but it had come out as honey.<br />
<br />
The family just exchanged glances at one another as they all realized what had happened. Not only had they exchanged ages, but now they couldn&#39;t even talk about the truth. The magic of the book was forcing them to talk like their current bodies would in that situation. It seemed like they had most of their free will, just with some truth being replaced with lies.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great going dork.&quot; Steve growled at Janet. &quot;I, like, knew this was a freaking lost cause. We&#39;d we even listen to you?&quot; He said in a stereotypical bitchy teen&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t blame me!&quot;&quot; Janet snapped back. &quot;I was just trying to fix this as fast as possible!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh really. Like great job! Now I have to say like, like all the time! And I&#39;ve always been a girl! I mean... gah!&quot; Steve yelled frustrated before he started pacing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look kids, it&#39;s been a busy day.&quot; Megan chimed in. &quot;Why don&#39;t we all go to our rooms to relax and then go to bed okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right.&quot; Alan agreed. &quot;And then we can just do Steph- D...daa...&quot; He tried to say &quot;dad&quot; with all his might but gave up resisting the far too powerful magic. &quot;You know who&#39;s plan.&quot; He sighed. &quot;Which means we got a lot of research to do tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve walked off pissed and Janet walked off upset behind him. Both were still adults on the inside, but both were forced to talk as their new bodies would. Janet felt that Steve was right, but she couldn&#39;t apologize with a twelve year old boys tone or word choices. When the two got up to the top of the stairs, Janet tapped Steve&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
Steve turned around, ready to yell again, but was instead greeted by Janet starring at him with the saddest eyes. Steve&#39;s anger left pretty quickly and he figured this was her way of apologizing without speaking. Steve held her hand and gave her a warm smile. Janet smiled back, and then the two hugged.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, downstairs, Megan and Alan were internally freaking out. They had the exterior chill demeanor of too &#39;we know what we&#39;re doing adults&#39; but inside they were still themselves. <br />
&quot;What the hell are we going to do now?&quot; Megan sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly what I said. We just have to do some research.&quot; Alan sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;But Alana- I meant, aw forget it.&quot; Megan huffed. &quot;Alana, honey bear, tomorrow is a school day.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So? We&#39;re not going to school we&#39;re adults remember?&quot; Alan responded, a little irritated after being called honey bear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but the kids still have to right?&quot; She continued. &quot;We can&#39;t hold them off from going forever because of magic, especially if them doing so affects our lives... if you know what I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve was confused for a moment before it clicked. If they just let their parents keep skipping school, when everyone changed back with reality adjusting, Alan and Megan might be the ones with a crazy amount of missed days. Alan didn&#39;t;t want to believe it would happen, but Megan did have a point.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, when did you get so smart?&quot; Alan cheekily asked.<br />
<br />
Megan just gestured down with a shrug and they both laughed. Alan was glad to have a bit of fun since all this began. Although he was still a woman, at least he wouldn&#39;t have to deal with school.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then, we&#39;ll just have to tell the kids tomorrow.&quot; Alan sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you think they&#39;ll take it?&quot; Megan asked</p>
<hr/><h3>
How do they take it the next morning?</h3>
