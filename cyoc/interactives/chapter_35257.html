<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Max Biggermen<br />
<br />
(Authors note: Part of this story has been posted before, the beginning and the end are new.)<br />
<br />
&quot;Motor four one from Base, Motor four one from Base, Maxwell are you there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm right here my southern bell. You always seem to know when I have my hands full. Are you callin to except my offer to go out with me tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep dreamin Romeo, now put it back in your pants and listen up. The Mayor was lookin over the books and noticed that revenues are down. He wants ya to write more tickets. We haven't met the ticket quota for the month.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mabel, you know since the state put in the new bypass the pickins have been slim. The tourist haven't been driving through.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Max, change some road signs or put up the detour again. You bess be doin some writin or your going be the new school crossing guard.&quot;<br />
<br />
Max put the radio mic down and zipped up his pants. &quot;The Mayor must be remodeling his house again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Max was about set up a speed trap when a SUV went speeding by. &quot;Well what do ya know? There's my first ticket. Let's see how big I can make it.&quot;<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
Ty, Allen, Peter and Dustin decided to drive down to the beach for the day. They were running a bit late, and Dustin had missed the bypass turn off to the beach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dustin! You were supposed to turn right on Highway 98! It says so on the map, right here!&quot; Ty said to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, let me turn around.&quot; Dustin sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, hurry up! We're wasting time driving around these little towns!&quot; Allen added.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't!&quot; Dustin replied. &quot;The speed limit in this town is 30 miles per hour! If I drive any faster than...&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly there was a sound of a siren coming from behind their SUV.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh crap... A motorcycle cop!&quot; Dustin sighed. &quot;Right behind us...&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin pulled over and turned off the engine.<br />
<br />
The cop parked the bike behind the SUV and got off. He then walked up to the car and bent down so he could address Dustin, while looking through the window.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there a problem, officer?&quot; Dustin asked him, with an innocent look on his face.<br />
<br />
The Officer took off his mirrored glasses and hung them on the out side of his shirt pocket.<br />
&quot;Boy!  He said in a deep southern accent. &quot;You must be one of those Yankee cause I know ya aint from these parts, commin down in your fancy &quot;S&quot; &quot;U&quot; &quot;V&quot; speedin through town. Speedin aint gonna be tolerated in this town...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, officer. We're on the way to the beach and we lost our way...&quot; Dustin added.<br />
<br />
&quot;You best be gettin out of the car and quit sassin me.&quot; the officer ordered.<br />
<br />
The foursome got out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your trip through our little town here is gonna to cost you 75 Dollar fine for speedin right now...&quot; the officer started. “Or, a day in traffic school.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the officer felt a tingling feeling through his entire body. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey... What... What's going on?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;FREEZE! &quot; Demanded Ty. &quot;You will not be able to move until I say so. I'm going to teach all you cops in your little hick town how to treat tourist right.&quot;<br />
<br />
His uniform started to fit loose. His boots were bigger and wider. He was regressing! The cop, who was about 30 years-old, was slowly becoming younger and younger, thanks to Ty’s powers!<br />
<br />
“I can make you into a teen right now…” Ty replied. “Or, I can make you into a little boy…”<br />
<br />
The officer continued to regress, with his uniform now fitting him many sizes too big. The officer was now in his early twenties, as he continued to regress. <br />
<br />
“How about I send you back to high school?” Ty continued.<br />
<br />
The officer was now about 18, as his facial hair disappeared. He lost his height and muscle, and his face became slightly rounder.<br />
<br />
“I can also make you a middle-schooler…”<br />
<br />
The officer now regressed even further, slowly shrinking into a teenager, becoming skinny and short, with his uniform sitting on him like a huge robe, wrinkling on him in the process. His sleeves were just too long, since his arms were shorter. His slacks were all wrinkled as well, since his legs were much too short.<br />
<br />
“How about I send you back to grade school?” Ty laughed, as the regression continued.<br />
<br />
The cop now regressed into a pre-teen, and was now a sixth-grader, small and skinny, with big blue eyes, and an innocent look on his face. He lost all the hair on his arms and legs and on his armpits. <br />
<br />
“And now… A little baby…” Ty chuckled.<br />
<br />
The copy finally regressed into a baby. His face became rounder and his hands and feet shrunk further. He was completely covered by the big, black uniform. Finally, the little baby started to cry softly.<br />
<br />
“All right, time to grow back to fifteen… But this time we are going to change a few things …” Ty ordered.<br />
<br />
The baby started to grow once again, progressing this time. His face started to grow a little longer as his hands and feet grew bigger. His arms and legs grew longer, and his torso expanded. The boy became a pre-teen and then passed through puberty, as hair covered his arms and legs. Muscles started to increase in size, and the boy grew bigger in size and in height. The police uniform started to fit tighter than when he was an adult. Then the muscle growth stopped, leaving him looking like a senior in high school rather than a fifteen year-old teenager.<br />
<br />
“Now, you’re going to waive the stupid speeding ticket…” Ty said to the teenage cop, “Or I can change you back to your original self?”<br />
<br />
The boy shook his head out of fear. &quot;Please don't change me back. I kinda like this body you have given me. I aint felt this good in years.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Good, you let us go and you can keep your new body. Just to let you know that there are no hard feelings I will let you decide when your body will stop growing. Open your mind and let me see what it is you really want.”<br />
<br />
The teen aged back to adulthood, right before the four teens. He grew slowly, filling in the ever-expanding police uniform. Ty made the uniform stretchable to accommodate the increase in muscle mass. Within moments, the cop was a twenty five year old, two hundred and seventy five pounds adult bodybuilder dressed in a skintight police uniform.<br />
<br />
Allen, Peter and Dustin looked at Ty's latest creation. This was one of Ty's best works yet.<br />
<br />
“You will not remember anything that has happened here in the last thirty minutes.” Ty said in a monotone voice. “You will now have a need to spend more time at the beach to show off your new body. Your friends will not notice a change in your body. Only your fellow officers, who come in physical contact with you, will change into bodybuilding police officers. When I snap my fingers you will act like anything unusual has happened.”<br />
<br />
&quot;SNAP!&quot;<br />
<br />
“Very well I'm will give you a warnin this time. Next time I catch ya speeding it will cost ya a hefty fine.” The officer said, as he walked his now larger body back to the motorcycle, starting the engine as he got on. As he rode off he thought to himself &quot;I need to get a bigger bike. Thisn' is gettin too small.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Wow… That was close…” Dustin sighed.<br />
<br />
“Now, Highway 98 to the beach!” Ty said, as he jumped back in the car. &quot;I think the police force in this town is about to get a whole lot bigger.&quot;<br />
<br />
All the guys started to laugh as they got back in the car. They rode off, to enjoy the afternoon at the beach. <br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
Driving down the road Max gets the urge to take a day off. &quot;Ya know I think I'll go check out the beach and show off this body again. Nothin makes my day like a little admiration.&quot; <br />
<br />
Max opens his shirt by three buttons exposing his massive chest to the world. He cruised down the road just at the speed limit. This of course meant that no one wanted to pass him in fear of getting a speeding ticket. Driving the speed limit gave everyone coming from the opposite direction a front on view. They in turn joined Max's little caravan to the beach.<br />
<br />
By the time the caravan got to the beach there were twenty cars wanting to get a closer look at their escort. With twenty or so set of eyes watched Max prepared to dismount his motorcycle. Max didn't have to worry about helmet hair as he took off his helmet. His hairstyle was a blond military flat top. He smiled at what he saw in rear view mirror before covering it with his helmet. He slowly unbuttoned the rest of the buttons and untucked the shirt. The white tank top undershirt hugged his body like a second skin and so did his pants. He had to get out of them real soon before he splits any seems again. The thought of out growing his clothes was very arousing to him. His growing bulge was evident of that. For a brief moment he thought that exposing himself in public would be bad for his career. That thought quickly faded away. Why shouldn't he show off his body?<br />
<br />
Max unbuckled his weapons belt and put it in the hard case saddlebag on his motor. He undid his pants, pulled downed the zipper and opened his pants. Even he was surprised at what he found underneath.  Unbeknownst to Max, Ty saw fit to change Max's underwear into form fitting pair of black Speedos. The Speedos had a large pouch, that Max filled, while the seat had minimum coverage. Max slipped off his motorcycle boots and put them next to his ride. As he bent down, peeling off his tight pants, he heard a collective gasp behind him. He lingered a bit longer to give all a good view of his striated gluts before standing up right. <br />
<br />
The shirt flapped in the ocean breeze like a large blue flag. Under it was a body many have dreamed of for decades. Max removed the shirt placing in the saddlebag with his weapon. Now clad in only in a black Speedo and a very tight shirt he decides to give his audience a show. He criss-crosses his arms in front and begins to pull up his shirt. He slowly pulls it up over his head, ending in a double bicep pose. The sound of bodies falling to the payment could be heard.</p>
