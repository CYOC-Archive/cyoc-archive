<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stumbling out of the bathroom, his shorts pulled up but still unbuttoned displaying a white triangle of the strap of his jock, David made his way to the living room again. <br />
<br />
What he saw unnerved him.  There was his son, but it wasn&#39;t his son. Instead of the pale tiny nerd, in his place, manspreading in the middle of the couch was a barely clothed hunk.  Gone was the weak nerd that he had pushed and pushed to be a barely useful bat boy. Instead, a young man sat in his place who looked like he was minutes if not seconds from playing for the major leagues. Gone were his glasses, pale skin, and bowl cut and in their place rested the tanned and confident head framed by a blonde mullet.  His shirt was gone and he displayed a pair of broad pecs and abs dusted with blonde hair. The only clothing he wore was a white jockstrap.  Concealed within, David could see a hefty cock and balls that pulled the supportive underwear away from the base of his torso to show an inch or two of shaved pubes.  <br />
<br />
Looking at the scene objectively, David could see this was just like those gay for pay casting videos with Chuck playing the interviewer off camera.  Looking again, David noticed the tripod sitting before the couch and realized that was exactly what it was.  <br />
<br />
He still couldn&#39;t figure out why he knew that was the scenario.  <br />
<br />
His momentary confusion was broken by his son noticing his return to the room. <br />
<br />
&quot;Daddy!&quot; his son said gesturing him to the couch.  <br />
<br />
David found his desire to get the fuck out of there melt away as he went from confusion to meekly sitting next to his son on the couch.  <br />
<br />
As he sat down, his son draped one of his large arms over him and pulled him closer to him. <br />
<br />
With them both seated, Chuck began to speak.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Dave,&quot; he said, a mischievous grin playing across his lips, &quot;I imagine you have a lot of questions about what&#39;s going on. When you went to the restroom, I asked your son what he wanted most in the world, and he told me, &#39;I want my dad to love and support me.&#39; Normally that would have been a sad thing to hear but, you&#39;re both in luck. I&#39;m in the unique position to help you both in all kinds of ways.&quot;<br />
<br />
David didn&#39;t move. He didn&#39;t even change the expression on his face. It was almost as if he couldn&#39;t.  But, he did begin to sweat.  <br />
<br />
Chuck continued, &quot;I asked why he thought you didn&#39;t love and support him and he said it was your dream as a coach to have a son who could be the all-star player you wanted him to be.&quot; <br />
<br />
Dave found himself unwillingly locking eyes with his son.  Behind his eyes he saw none of the intelligence that he normally expected. Instead, he just saw simple contentment and something else.  Something harder.  <br />
<br />
Chuck kept talking. &quot;Cole here is the perfect jock son.  He can bat, he can run, and he can pitch.  He&#39;s everything you&#39;ve ever wanted and more.&quot;<br />
<br />
David thought for a brief moment Chuck had said, &quot;Cole&quot; but his son was named something different.  His son was named Col... Coli.... Cole was his son&#39;s name.  <br />
<br />
He focused back on what Chuck was saying.  &quot;...once I made Cole the total package a studly jock like you wanted, he had some more ideas on how you could support him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave found himself moving his right hand over on the couch and grasping the thigh that his son had pressed against his bare knee.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You see, you wanted Cole to be a total alpha, a game-winning, cock-strong jock and that&#39;s what he is. But he needed someone to help him in that endeavor.  Someone like you, his father and his coach is the best he could ask for.  I think he will find that you&#39;re more eager to help him in his training than you ever thought you could be.&quot;<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when David felt it.  The need in his body, his hand inching further and further up his son&#39;s thigh.  The changes to his body. It all made sense.  <br />
<br />
Chuck said, &quot;From now on, you&#39;re going to be a hard assed coach on the field and a bottom bitch at home. Serving Cole however he desires. Making yourself available for his urges. You&#39;ll wait in him hand and foot, worshipping your prodigy with all your might. Keeping him focused on his athletic goals by giving him a place to focus his other energies.&quot;<br />
<br />
The light on the camera flashed red and Dave watched as Cole reached into the waistband of his jock and fished out a growing tube of flesh. Dave found himself leaning over Cole&#39;s lap and latching on to the massive head with his lips.  It quickly expanded and he began to work the shaft with his hands making sure to keep a bit of eye contact on the camera.  <br />
<br />
Chuck shifted his focus from his explanation and addressed the couple.  &quot;Why don&#39;t you two introduce yourselves?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole spoke up, his baritone voice causing a flutter in Dave&#39;s stomach, &quot;I&#39;m Cole and this is my slutty daddy David.&quot;<br />
<br />
David&#39;s mind drifted from the back and forth between Cole and Chuck.  It was clearly for the sake of the camera.  He instead spent his time worshiping the cock his altered son had presented for him.  Up and down, using his tongue dutifully  as he had watched countless bottoms do to their tops.  <br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t stop until he felt Colin pull his head away saying, &quot;Time for the main course.  Show me that ass.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave positioned himself in the middle of the couch as his son&#39;s powerful hands pulled off his shorts and jock in one quick motion.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Get those legs behind your head.&quot; Cole commanded. Dave found himself responding immediately his actions an instant compliance to his son&#39;s imposing presence. <br />
<br />
Dave could see his reflection in the dark screen of the television. The hairy orbs of his asscheeks framed by the white lines of his jock.  Then the felt his son&#39;s meaty paws spreading them more, making his puffy hole wink at the recording camera. <br />
<br />
&quot;Look at this slutty dadhole.&quot; He heard Cole say.  He no longer thought of Cole as his son.  Of course, he was his son but he was also so much more.  <br />
<br />
His head lulled as he felt Cole&#39;s wide tongue graze the newly needful center of his ass.  It was unlike anything he had imagined. He saw fireworks.  It was as all he was, all he&#39;d ever been was a body carrying around an empty hole needing pleasure.  He moaned and he was surprised at how feminine he sounded.  He felt Cole pause and then continue his ministrations. <br />
<br />
Finally, Cole shifted from his knees where he had bent down to lap at his ass and he stood, shucking his moist jock.  &quot;Quit your mewling.&quot; Cole said and he shoved the large garment deep in his daddy&#39;s mouth.  Chuck&#39;s senses were filled with the smell of Cole&#39;s musk and the taste of his precum. <br />
<br />
He would have sat there in his ecstasy but then he felt the tip of his son&#39;s pendulous manhood at his entrance.  With one hard thrust, Cole went from tip to hilt.  Dave would have screamed but the jock muffled his outcry.  Cole slammed in and out of him using his hairy ass like a human fleshlight.  The pounding went on and on without break. Dave was actively spurting cum into his ball filled jockstrap quickly turning it into a sopping mess.  <br />
<br />
Cole pulled the garment to one side and grabbed his enhanced  ballsack and pulled it from his body. &quot;The last manly thing you did with these was squirt out me&quot; he said.  Cole brought his face down to one of his balls and nibbled on it like an apple.  &quot;Aren&#39;t you glad I came out of here to show you hat a real man looks like?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave, before he could even think of it found himself nodding, he had tears in his eyes and he felt like his brain was being pumped out of his body with every thrust Cole shoved into him.  <br />
<br />
After some time, Cole pulled out leaving a gaping hole and the coolness of the room&#39;s ac on his ass.  He shot his load all over Dave discoloring the now sweat soaked white shirt with the off white torrent of spurt after spurt of his load.  <br />
<br />
He wiped his dick clean on Dave&#39;s blue pants and thew them back on the ground.  <br />
<br />
Chuck turned off the camera. <br />
<br />
Colin  was  now Cole the perfect athlete. David was now Dave, his south coach and Daddy.  Cole pulled on his modified pants.  And Dave began to stand up shakily.  Cole looked at him with disdain, &quot;Don&#39;t bother to put on any pants.  This is only round one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave couldn&#39;t help but feel excited.  When they got home, his son was going to go for a double.</p>
