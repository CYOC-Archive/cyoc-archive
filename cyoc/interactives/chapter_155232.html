<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For two weeks after Gary had transformed Pete, Tyler, Coach Eli and himself, he just enjoyed his return status on the team. Exercising with the team was one of the hight lights of his day, because Gary was able to show off just how strong he now was. However at the end of that first new week, Gary found some unexpected side effects.<br />
<br />
While throughout the week, Gary had noticed that Tyler&#39;s libido had drastically increased, forcing Tyler to spend a good amount of time during lunch in the restrooms, and that Pete now found himself dealing with a drastic increase in popularity. However, it was that Saturday that he woke and found himself with a beard.<br />
<br />
Gary knew he had been shaving daily, but looking in the mirror that morning, he saw a light beard where the night before had been almost smooth skin. After examining the facial hair with his hands and eyes for a few minutes, Gary turned his attention to the rest of his body. Gary now noticed that the hair on his legs and arms was much thicker, and the bush around his monstrous cock and balls was now at the base of a trail of hair leading up between his abs. With some hair on his abs and a light dusting across his pecs, Gary realized that his testosterone levels must be through the roof. <br />
<br />
He knew that his own libido had risen, something that Lucy, his girlfriend, did not seem to mind. She had even said that she hoped he would get even bigger. So that Saturday, Gary started to think about more changes. <br />
<br />
That night, when Lucy arrived for their date, Gary had yet to shave and his beard had come in thick. At first, Lucy was so surprised she had no idea what to think, but when Gary picked her up off her feet and pulled her in for a kiss, Lucy could not help but melt from the feeling of shear power that now held her. Latter that night, she would also realize that Gary&#39;s new size was not just for the football field.<br />
<br />
After the second week, Gary sat in his room. While things were even better with Lucy (she seemed to want to be in his bed every single night), the football team was a concern. He knew that he should stop while he was ahead. After all, he had everything he could want. But the team was just not where he would want them. Sure the team had won by a wide margin, thanks to him, Tyler and Pete, but he just knew that some of the other guys should be as fortunate as them.<br />
<br />
Turning on the program, Gary looked through the list of players on the team. Settling on three, Gary picked John and Luther, two of the team&#39;s defensive tackles, and Kevin, the quarterback. Setting the program to add five pounds of muscle to John and Luther each day for the next two weeks, this would bring them closer to Gary&#39;s own level, but still leave them both at least fifty pounds below his own size. Next he set the program to add three pounds of muscle to Kevin daily for the next two weeks. <br />
<br />
Sitting in front of his computer, Gary then brought up Coach Eli&#39;s profile. The coach was now 28, and Gary had been impressed with his muscle. Sure it was nothing compare to Gary, but still admirable for a guy under six feet. <br />
<br />
Gary had been very grateful that Coach Eli had let him back onto the team. The coach had even personally paid for Gary&#39;s new jersey (none of the ones the school already had would fit when Gary wore his pads). Gary also knew that Coach Eli was really enjoying his returned youth. When Gary had heard that Coach Eli&#39;s wife had left him, Gary was concerned. However, seeing the man out on a date with a girl who looked like she was in a college sorority quickly eased his mind. Therefore, when he set the program to reduce the coach&#39;s age an additional two years and give the man two pounds of muscle a day over the next to weeks, Gary wondered how this would effect the coach&#39;s mentality.<br />
<br />
Gary already could see that Coach Eli was treating the players on the team like peers in many situations, but Gary restrained himself from actually making Coach Eli a teenager. After all, only being 28 had flipped the coach&#39;s life on his head, and now he would soon be 26.<br />
<br />
Finally, Gary brought up his own profile. Remembering how much both he and Lucy were enjoying his growth, Gary set the program to raise his hight to seven feet even and increase his muscle mass by 3 pounds a day over the course of the next two weeks. Gary knew that he was going to need to get new pads and clothes again, but he didn&#39;t care.<br />
<br />
Finished with the program, Gary went into the bathroom to take care of his raging cock. Already leaking pre-cum, Gary wrapped one of his giant hands around his monstrous cock while he ran his other had over the rest of his body. Feeling the hair on his chest, Gary loved the way that his body was so powerful. Playing with his balls, which now were the size of oranges and hanging in a sack that almost reached his knees, Gary was now almost always force to were a jockstrap. Finally rubbing his face and feeling the beard that he had let grow, by request of Lucy, Gary blew his load all over the sink and mirror. Not once. Not twice. But Gary counted eleven loads semen shoot out.</p>
