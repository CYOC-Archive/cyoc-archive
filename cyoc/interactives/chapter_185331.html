<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The closet was a small and otherwise cramped space to be in. Normally its space was used to hold clothes, but after Whitney Chapman became a Slug Woman those clothes had all seemed to vanish. For the previous night and start of the morning, Jeff and his siblings had left the closet door open and empty as there was no other use for it There were no clothes and thus nothing for any of them to wear and it was too small a space for the four of them to sleep. Once Whitney was rescued and they&#39;d managed to break the mind control that she&#39;d been under, that room would be even smaller, and not just because Grace had also become a Slug Woman the previous night. Now, however, it was only a shelter for Jeff to hide in.<br />
<br />
It had started in letting the four members of the Chapman family that had become Slug Women out to go and get food and things that were needed and what they couldn&#39;t gather the night before when Megan and Jenny&#39;s attempt to turn the entire Chapman family into Slug People was betrayed. Jeff had thought it would be reasonable and the only worry might be that Megan and Jenny might jump his mother and sisters elsewhere in the house, but as Slug Women already, there wouldn&#39;t be anything more that Megan and Jenny could do to them. However, that plan wasn&#39;t followed as shortly after they left, Jeff had gone to look out a window while Megan and Jenny came in through the north and south windows, and with a fast enough speed that Jeff hadn&#39;t been able to get to the main door and flee the room. Thus the only place he could go was to the closet that he was now in.<br />
<br />
He managed to escape capture, but he was alone and in the dark. He was able to get the door locked, but he was still alone and frustrated as Megan and Jenny had begun to masturbate and spray the wall and door with their cum. Jeff could smell all that and it had two effects. One was a reminder of what Megan and Jenny had come to the Chapman home to do, to transform the family and enslave them to an unnamed &quot;master.&quot; That was something that no one in the Chapman family supported, and while Jeff knew that Lucy&#39;s opposition to it would be the strongest, that didn&#39;t mean that he or his siblings were actually that far behind. He could accept that he too would probably become a Slug Woman or a rarer Slug Man, but he at least wanted to keep his freedom and mental faculties, which he might lose if Megan and Jenny were able to catch him and have their way with him.<br />
<br />
The other problem, however, was the arousing factor of the scent that Megan and Jenny gave off as they masturbated and as every spurt of cum hit the wall or door. He thankfully couldn&#39;t see it through the wall or the closed door, and in the darkness of the closet he might not even seen it, even if they&#39;d been in the closet with him, but he was completely certain that was what they were doing. He could hear both of them moan and taunt him to come out or let them in, or complain that he&#39;d been fast enough to get the locked door between them and him, and that gave him some indication of what they were up to. The big thing though is that Jeff could smell their scents and in an odd way, something in his mind told him it was a scent that indicated arousal and that served to arouse him in reply. The scent turned him on and he could feel his penis standing erect and firm as though his body wanted to cum and thus join them. All Jeff could do was sit with his back to the door and hope that his family would come back rescue him some how. <br />
<br />
He also had to wrestle to keep his hands away from his waist and away from his penis. All of that represented a great deal of temptation that Jeff knew he had to resist, at least while Megan and Jenny were there. Grace, Lucy, and Zoe might have kept their own free minds and personalities when they became Slug Women, but they&#39;d also gone through their transformations absent interference from Megan and Jenny. In that he struggled to think over things that didn&#39;t turn him on, baseball, football, water pipes making some weird &quot;whirring&quot; noise when the water softener had a cycle to run through. However, with the intense scent drifting into the closet, Jeff found that it was a hard mental fight and all he could do was hope and wait for his family, and for a while that seemed like a lost hope.<br />
<br />
However, after a few moments something happened, and something Jeff couldn&#39;t fully explain. He could somehow sense Megan and Jenny&#39;s distracted confidence, though that was something he could assume they felt because they had him trapped. The thing that he could explain was the feelings of righteous fury that he could some how sense and feel coming from nearby. He couldn&#39;t be sure where, exactly, but it was reasonably close. It felt sort of like what Grace had described the hive mind that Slug People had, not true telepathy but more the ability to sense the sorts of feelings and intents that were there, and that could be a sign of his own transformation, but as he ran his hands over his skin, he noted he wasn&#39;t sweating any more than normal which had been part of the first step in Grace&#39;s transformation. Yet, all the same, that feeling of fury was there and Jeff knew that wasn&#39;t coming from Megan or Jenny. The confirmation on who it was came a few moments later.<br />
<br />
&quot;You dirty slut!&quot; came Lucy&#39;s voice. It carried a very growling tone that betrayed all that rage and anger, which Jeff was certain his twin had in spades over what Megan and Jenny had done to them and put them through and he only listened as Lucy&#39;s verbal assault continued, &quot;coming after our brother like that... and messing up my mother&#39;s room and the rest of the house is even worse!&quot;<br />
<br />
That got Jeff more alert and he looked up, even though he was still in pretty much pitch blackness inside the closet, but he could hear what went on outside the door. Megan and Jenny did vocally respond, but the bigger thing that happened was that there was the sound of skin slapping skin followed by grunts of exertion rather than passion. It was something that Jeff felt had to be his mother and sisters coming back. He didn&#39;t stop to think on how they got into the bedroom, as he&#39;d left the main door locked and he didn&#39;t think that Megan or Jenny had paid any attention to that door, but that didn&#39;t matter. His family had returned to rescue him, and while Megan and Jenny argued back,  Jeff could hear all of his siblings and his mother.  A loud and almost fearful cry from Jenny was enough to prove to Jeff that they were also getting the upper hand on the Slug Women that had started things. He then waited a few moments before things got quiet and shakily got himself to his feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom? Lucy? Grace? Zoe?&quot; Jeff asked to the door, &quot;is that you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, bro, it&#39;s us,&quot; Zoe answered come out, &quot;it&#39;s safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff came out and had to adjust his eyes a bit as light came flooding in, but after a few blinks he was able to stand there and see the gathered faces. Zoe and Lucy looked a bit relieved, though Lucy also had a small look of frustration on her face. Whitney was a bit more unreadable, though Grace had also looked a bit scared. As his vision cleared even more, Jeff was also able to note that what Megan and Jenny had done had effected his siblings and mother too, as their penises were just as erect as his was. It also made Jeff cringe a bit as he&#39;d also stepped in something wet and sticky as he&#39;d come out of the closet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man... they made a mess,&quot; Jeff grumbled trying to break the tension that had likely built up over what had happened and ease some of the fears he was sure they felt.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were supposed to flee the room if they were to try and come in through the windows,&quot; Lucy then said to him firmly, &quot;do you realize how scary it was to come back to the door and sense them in here and bragging about what they wanted to do to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t want to lose you, Jeff,&quot; Grace added weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not my fault,&quot; Jeff tried to defend himself quickly, &quot;I was waiting for you guys to get back and came out to this window here...&quot; He gestured to the south window to the room, &quot;and I was looking out it and noticed some people going about their mornings. No one seemed to notice anything. Then I heard a click... like someone was undoing the window locks... I turned toward it and found that Jenny had already gotten into the room. I couldn&#39;t make it into the hallway, and then Megan started to come in through the window I was looking out of. The only thing I could do was get into the closet and lock the door behind me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucy narrowed her eyes a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Zoe&#39;s been the athlete in the family, okay,&quot; Jeff said to her, &quot;I was lucky I didn&#39;t twist an ankle hurdling the bed just to get to the closet door.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... at least you made it too the closet,&quot; Zoe commented, easing some of the family&#39;s inner tension.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... though I was glad to sense your guys&#39; anger at Megan and Jenny,&quot; Jeff spoke, which actually got some eyes to widen in surprise, &quot;it brought a lift to my spirits and assured me that Megan and Jenny were in trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You sensed our arrival?&quot; Grace asked, &quot;our emotions?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t explain it,&quot; Jeff answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you could... that&#39;d mean you were starting to tap into the hive mind,&quot; Grace told Jeff, &quot;part of what starts the final part of the transformation...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I didn&#39;t give in to all the intense scents of arousal that Megan and Jenny were trying to use,&quot; Jeff pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;True... but remember that they bathed all of us in the transformative magic when they came into the house the first time,&quot; Grace countered, &quot;and you and mom got the most of it. In this, Megan and Jenny were quite right to say that we were going to transform eventually.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I still feel like me,&quot; Jeff said slowly, &quot;and maybe now that they&#39;re gone we can talk and get some breakfast. Maybe that will delay things while we figure out what to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So long as you&#39;re feeling like you,&quot; Lucy said, &quot;that&#39;s what matters. It&#39;s at a point where it probably won&#39;t matter whether or not you&#39;re a Slug Person.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If and when that happens... I&#39;d want it to be on my terms,&quot; Jeff answered, &quot;can we eat now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Whitney spoke, &quot;let&#39;s move over to a cleaner area and eat. We can then discuss on what to do next.&quot;</p>
