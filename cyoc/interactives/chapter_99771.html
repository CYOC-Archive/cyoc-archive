<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Whatever,” Jeff said, “Are ya gonna come in or just stay out here ‘n pout?” It was obvious that Jeff wasn’t grasping the depth of what was going on--then again, Jeff had never been very good at grasping anything at all, as long as I’d known him. <br />
<br />
I paused and rolled that thought around in my head for a moment--Jeff might have always been a jerk, but he’d always been clever...hadn’t he? I looked at him now, and things were...off. The wifebeater, the grungy looking boxers-- the mullet and the beard he had grown out for years. Sure, he’d become a slob before, but he seemed to have taken on a few extra qualities along with this new trailer. I followed him inside; I had to know what he’d wished for, exactly, so I could try and see if this whole Emma problem was even fixable. “Hey, what did you say to get this trailer, anyway?--after you wished for no neighbors, I mean.”<br />
<br />
“Well, I mean, it put me here in the trailer, but it was pretty small, so I made it bigger, but then it was expensive--so the curse made it so my uncle gave it tah me, ‘r it woulda cost a fortune.”<br />
<br />
“Wait, your uncle?” I’d met his uncle before--he would have never ever lived in a trailer. “Seriously?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, sure--he put every penny he scraped together workin’ construction tah buy this trailer, ‘n left it tah me when he passed--since mah dad and mom ditched me, and I lived with ‘em fer so long.”<br />
<br />
“Jeff, I think your wish might have changed a bit more than you realized.”<br />
<br />
“What do ya mean?”<br />
<br />
“I mean--look at you man. I don’t want to say anything, but doesn’t anything about the way you look seem a bit...different?”<br />
<br />
I dragged him over into the bathroom, to look in the grungy mirror, and I saw he was still changing--his beard a bit longer still, his teeth looking yellow--and one cheek was puffed out--with chaw, I realized. He always used the stuff...just like his uncle had, which I knew, somehow. He stared at himself, and shook his head, “I don’ know what ya mean, man.”<br />
<br />
Well now he definitely didn’t know, thanks to the curse, and I had a sneaking suspicion it was actually getting stronger. Still, I had to try and get through to him before he forgot entirely. “Look, think about it, man! I mean, if you lived out in the sticks like this, and I grew up in town, then we shouldn’t even know each other--we met in elementary school, right?”<br />
<br />
“Well...sure we did--I never went tah no city school, ‘n neither did you--don’t ya remember? Both of us went tah that little run down elementary school ten miles down the road--you ‘n yer Pa were our closest neighbors, with that little patch a land down the road. Too bad yer dad lost his job ‘n couldn’ pay the bank--coulda put mah trailer on yer property--always thought it was nicer.”<br />
<br />
It had been a trap, and Jeff hadn’t even known the curse had laid it for us. I tried to hold onto those old memories of mine, but they were already fading, with new ones filling in their place. Of living and being raised by my dad, losing our little home. He got a job trucking, and I moved in here with Jeff--but hadn’t found a job anywhere. It wasn’t easy--since now we’d both dropped out of high school. “Shit--ya fucker! Why’d ya go ‘n say that?” I yelled in mah new accent, “Ya stupid son of a whore!”<br />
<br />
“Hey, tha’ don’ make mah Ma any less a person,” he said, his accent thicker, his words slurring a bit more “N, ya ain’t one tah call anyone stupid, when ya can barely read!”<br />
<br />
I bit my tongue as best I could--I couldn’t let my anger get the best of me, not after the damage we’d already done. I looked down at myself, at my filthy overalls and dirty hands--I wasn’t even wearing a shirt...but I didn’t wear shirts very often, only when we went into town to get food--maybe. “Look, I’s sorry, I just a bit frust--fustated is all, cause ya changed so much.”<br />
<br />
“Nah, I know, ‘n Ah lost mah temper--but ya know how Ah feel ’bout people makin’ fun a mah ma,” Jeff said, and stepped closer to me, in a way which was both...familiar, but also uncomfortable. “Look, why don’ we make up--ya still gotta pay me tahday’s rent, ya know?”<br />
<br />
“R-Rent?” I asked, kind of knowing what he meant, but hoping I was wrong. <br />
<br />
“Hey, guys’ got needs, ya know? Git a job, or bring a bitch, or I git tah fuck.”<br />
<br />
I did call him a fucker, so what did I expect would happen? And girls weren’t exactly lining up to come home with a redneck slob like me. Part of me tried to fight it, but most of me was just resigned to the reality I’d helped create, and undid my overalls, letting them fall around my boots, and bent over his bed.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, that’s what I’m talking about,” Jeff said, letting his cock free from his boxers. It was...substantial. At least eight inches, but it wasn’t the first time he’d fucked me. <br />
<br />
“Come on man, jus’ git it over with.”<br />
<br />
He spit in his hand and got it wet, and pushed it against my hole. I pushed back, trying to not holler from the pain of it, until he popped inside me, and got up a good rhythm. I just tried not to think about what was happening--which was easy, because suddenly it was hard to think about anything.<br />
<br />
“Yeah fuck, feels so good in yer fat ass,” Jeff said, and I felt the weight pack on around me--not only on my ass, but also on my gut and moobs, “Heh, If I fuck ya enough, I’ll start preferrin’ ya tah pussy.”<br />
<br />
“Jeff--jus’ stop talkin’, man.”<br />
<br />
“Oh shut up, ya know ya like it.”<br />
<br />
So what if I did? I pushed back, letting out a little moan, my cock hardening in my flab.<br />
<br />
“Callin’ mah Ma a whore--yer the real fuckin’ whore.”<br />
<br />
I couldn’t really make money any other way at the moment, and a surprising number of rednecks around us liked using my hole...and I liked having them inside me plenty. Funny enough, a lot of them told me that once they shot their first load in my ass...no other sex was as good. Generally, a first customer for me was a repeat customer, though Jeff fucked me more than anyone, by far--always had, since we were teenagers.<br />
<br />
“Dirty, nasty, stinkin’ whore. Ya fuckin’ love it.”<br />
<br />
The musk rolling off me doubled in strength--I reeked of sweat and sex, but it only got me harder, as I wormed a hand underneath my bulk, rubbing my cock, feeling myself get close as Jeff started panting harder--meaning he was about to blow too. Feeling him spill his seed in my guts pushed me over the edge too, and I sprayed my load all over his bed, both of us huffing and puffing and sweating and stinking, and it felt so wrong but completely normal. He pulled out of me, and I pulled up my 5XL overalls--basically the only thing I could wear that fit my fat body comfortably anymore. <br />
<br />
“Thanks man, Ah didn’ know how much Ah needed that.”<br />
<br />
“Hey, a fuck fer a night, tha’s the deal,” I said, and grinned, “Got other guys tah git tah though, Ah’ll be back in a few hours.”<br />
<br />
Jeff smirked, “Maybe Ah can prepay fer tahmorrow when ya git back?”<br />
<br />
“Jeff, Ah got rent covered from ya fer months--yer mah horniest regular. Can’ git enough a me.” <br />
<br />
I grinned and jiggled my ass at him in just the way he liked. The desperation in his eyes was the best payback I was going to get, but I did have rounds to make. I climbed into my old truck and headed out--ready to make my first stop of the evening.</p>
