<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">...a half-orc.<br />
<br />
Jeff's mind barely had time to register the last words he saw on his computer screen before the transformation overtook him.  His modern clothing, obviously not suited for this new setting was the first to go dissolving off his body like mist, leaving his sixteen year old human body exposed.  Still none of the villagers walking through the town seemed to see him floating over their heads.<br />
<br />
Suddenly it felt like his entire body was tensing, flooding with a sudden spike of adrenaline and testosterone.  His scrawny muscles began to swell, becoming hard and toned.  His frame began to stretch, his bones creaking as they grew in size, becoming both longer and thicker.  His 5'8&quot; body grew to 6'2&quot;, his shoulders becoming broad and his chest barreling out.  Even his waist and hips got thicker, followed by his hands a feet nearly doubling in size.  His lean teenaged body now replaced by a thick and stocky one, with his muscles still growing.  His arms and legs both grew thick with muscle, as his pecs puffed out, hard and well-defined.  His stomach tensed as his abs became a six-pack.<br />
<br />
A warming heat swelled in his groin as the changes moved on there, growing his cock to match the rest of his body.  His 3&quot; flaccid cock doubled in both length and girth, larger than it used to be hard but still soft.  His sac dropped lower, making room for his swelling testicles, growing to a pair of plum-sized orbs.  A strange tingling sensation ran over his thicker cock as his once circumsized organ regrew it's foreskin.<br />
<br />
His skin thickened slightly, becoming tougher as it began to darken slightly, taking on a slight olive tone.  His nipples and cock though took on a darker coloration, no mistaking the slight green tint to them.  The shaggy blond hair on his head suddenly streaked with black, the color soon covering every hair on his head.  His smooth cheeks and jaw had grown a slight stubble, his sideburns becoming thick and full, as well as a longer tuft of beard on his chin.  He felt his nose broaden and flatten, as his brows became thick and heavy over his now dark brown eyes.  His jaw squared and jutted out a bit, the tips of very short tusks barely peeking out from his lips.<br />
<br />
His pubic hair and the sparse hair on his arms and legs followed suit with that on his head, soon becoming coal black.  Then the hair began to thicken, his arms and legs developing a thick coat of hair that went up to his biceps and up his thighs.  His pubic bush spread out as well, and began to grow upwards, a thick trail growing up his stomach between his abs.  When the growing trail of hair finally reached the center of his chest it spread out, covering his pecs in dark hair.<br />
<br />
With the changes to his body complete clothes began to reform on him.  First, after a crude bit of underwear appeared covering his bulging manhood, a pair of brown cloth pants appeared.  A pair of iron greaves appeared on his feet going up to his knees, with the ends of his pants tucked into them.  A leather vest appeared on his torso, a rough metal breastplate.  From the elbow down his arms became encased in a pair of gauntlets that matched the rest of his armor, crude looking but effective.  A large battle axe appeared in a harness strapped to his back, not the prettiest weapon, but one with the nicks and dings of use.<br />
<br />
He felt a short stab of pain in his nose and reached up to feel a metal ring pierced his septum.  He felt a few more pricks in each of his ears as a few more rings appeared.  A tingle ran over his shoulders and biceps, dark black tribal tattoos becoming visible on his skin, which it seems his outfit was designed to display proudly.<br />
<br />
With almost careful slowness he lowered to the ground on the outskirts of the village, the cradling presence disappearing as soon as his feet touched the ground.  He felt heavy, but a feeling of power seemed to course through his muscles.  His ears then picked up the sound of footsteps hurrying his way and someone shouting, &quot;Jaf!&quot;  He wondered at that for a moment, but something in the back of his mind, some planted memory told him that was his name now.  Jaf turned in the direction the voice was coming from, running towards him was...</p>
