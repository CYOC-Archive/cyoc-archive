<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You quickly shake the thought of freezing out of your increasingly less gooey head and continue to trudge through the snow. Sure, the ice crystals forming in your body didn&#39;t feel good, but they wouldn&#39;t make just give up and turn into an ice sculpture. The blue slime fox girl behind, however, began to slow much quicker than you. Eventually, you pause and glance back at your shapely companion. &quot;H-hurry u-up!&quot; you urge, reaching back and grabbing her hand.<br />
<br />
The other slime fox looks back at you, her breath coming out in puffs of steam, and responds in a voice that was hardly a whisper: &quot;S-s-so c-c-cold...&quot; You turn back to face forward and continue moving as best as your slimy body would allow you to, squinting your eyes in an attempt to see through the blinding gusts of snow.<br />
<br />
In minutes, you&#39;ve reached your limit. Your legs barely move when you try to take a step, and your arms barely even twitch when you try to use them. Your left hand in particular stubbornly refused to move at this point because of its contact with the blue slime fox anthro behind you. The blue slime fox anthro was no longer moving, her body rigidly frozen in its position. The worst part of your contact with the blue slime fox girl was the fact that you could no longer let go of her hand, as your own was firmly frozen to hers.<br />
<br />
For the past few minutes, you were forced to trek through the snow while dragging a heavy but beautiful ice sculpture behind you, and you were tired. Your eyes start to glaze over as your brain starts to freeze, but you give one last weak struggle, forcing your less frozen leg to take one last step forward.<br />
<br />
As soon as your foot settles into the snow, the ground seems to give way. With your body frozen as stiff as a statue, you could do nothing but watch as you tumble down into an open chasm, dragging your blue slime companion in with you as a result.<br />
<br />
You fall for what seems like an eternity before landing. To your surprise, you don&#39;t shatter against a cold stone floor when you touch down. It seemed that the snow that had caved in beneath you had formed a handy little cushion on the ground, allowing you to land softly. You slowly gaze around your surroundings, moving your eyes and neck as fast as your body would allow.<br />
<br />
The place that you had fallen into was large was a large cave, one that was a serenely peaceful sight. The cave&#39;s walls seemed to be made of a thick bluish-white ice, which caught the dim light coming from the sky and radiated it out. It was still extremely cold in the cave, cold enough that you were still in danger of freezing if you stayed in the same position for too long, but it you reason was nowhere near as bad as the surface above you, with its ice-covered landscape and sleety gusts of wind. But the features of the cave weren&#39;t what caught your attention.<br />
<br />
There was someone kneeling in the center of the cave, someone with a body that looked similar to that of your own. You couldn&#39;t tell what features they had from this distance, but you could tell that they looked to be a slime like you, seeming to be a pure white in color. You try to quickly get to your feet, but your body doesn&#39;t move as quickly as you want to. You end up rising jerkily, the frozen parts of your body crackling with each attempt to force them into motion. You take a step forward, only to be stopped by a weight on one of your hands.<br />
<br />
The blue slime fox anthro lies still in the pile of snow you both landed in, frozen solid into an ice sculpture. You give her look and crack a slight smile (literally). Even as a statue, she looked beautiful, from her alluring pillowy ass to her plump breasts. But that wasn&#39;t the problem here. Your hand was still frozen solidly to hers. You stare at your blue fox slime companion for a little while longer, then yank your arm away. Though your face was now frozen in a slight smile, you wince inwardly as the blue slime anthro&#39;s hand snapped off, still firmly connected to yours. She would be mad at you for that when she defrosted. If she defrosted.<br />
<br />
Your force your rapidly stiffening body to spin around before you froze in place, jerkily moving your legs at a literally glacial pace. With crackling of your nearly frozen body echoing throughout the cave, you were certain that there was no way the slime creature in the center didn&#39;t hear you coming towards then.<br />
<br />
As you approached the white slime, you begin to notice more and more features. For one, this slime creature was clearly a she, like you and the sexy blue slimecicle behind you. She also had canine ears on the top of her head, not exactly like yours but pretty dang close. She had a tail resting next to her kneeling legs, but it wasn&#39;t as &quot;fluffy&quot; as yours. She also had a snout on her face, but it wasn&#39;t as slim as yours and had a distinctly wolf-like appearance.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-h-hello?&quot; you manage to choke out, your frozen vocal cords not doing much to assist you. The white wolf slime says nothing in response. You try to frown, but your face remained fixed into the slight smile you had made before. You attempt to reach out and touch the white wolf slime, but your arms remain firmly frozen at your sides. &quot;H-h-hello!&quot; you manage to shout, your words coming out much clearer this time. You&#39;re met with cold silence again. You hobble around to the front of the white slime fox anthro, your legs refusing to bend anymore, making sure to stand directly in their field of few. This is when you notice something off. The white wolf slime hadn&#39;t moved an inch from their position this whole time.<br />
<br />
You couldn&#39;t tell due to their coloring, but the white wolf slime was actually covered in a thick layer of frost, telling you that she had been frozen here for a long while. She, just like your blue fox slime companion and yourself, was well on her way to becoming a slime anthro ice sculpture. If you could gasp, you would, but your face wouldn&#39;t move anymore. In fact, not a single part of your body was responding to your commands anymore. You stood where you where, frozen firmly into your standing position with a slight smile on your face. If it wasn&#39;t for the fact that your body was green, any onlooker would see nothing but an ice sculpture when looking at your body.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, your frozen eyes registered a bit of movement in their field of view, and you forced them to move, searching for the motion. You look around for a moment before your eyes settle on the white wolf slime anthro statute in front of you. The white wolf slime&#39;s eyes lock onto yours at the same time and widen in obvious surprise. In a frantic jerking motion, the white wolf slime&#39;s eyes jerk downwards, clearly glancing towards the floor. You look down and notice a bundle of frost-covered sticks arranged on the cave&#39;s floor. It seemed that the wolf slime had been trying to make a fire right before she froze in place, as her frozen hand was still clutched firmly onto a stick of her own.<br />
<br />
It was obvious what the white wolf slime wanted you to do. She wanted you to rub the sticks together and start the fire, a task that seemed easy, but with the body of a slime ice statue, it was impossible. Your eyes narrow as you try your hardest to move your body, and to your surprise, you here your joints crackling. Yes! You could move, even if it was at a glacial pace!<br />
<br />
You slowly lean down and pick a stick up, placing against the pile and rubbing it against the rest of the sticks. Your body might not be cooperating, but there was no way you would let yourself and your companions stay frozen!</p>
