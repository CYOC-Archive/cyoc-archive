<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate watched in the mirror as his complexion improved, the last few years of his life seemed to smooth away and he grew younger. Even his tiredness seemed to be melting away. It hit him all at once then, the realization that the phone call was not a hoax or some Role Play phone sex thing. It was real.<br />
<br />
He pulled his pants off and stepped out of them, looking down at his waist, legs, and paying special attention to his crotch. He had on boring red checked boxers and could make out the outline of his own junk hanging between his legs. Soon he was going to be back in diapers, it&#39;s what he had asked for. He was getting younger just like the woman had said. He looked in the mirror and almost laughed at the excitement of the whole thing, feeling slightly dizzy with the flood of wonder and a little fear. What would it be like? Who would take care of him? How young was he going to get? <br />
<br />
Wait... he didn&#39;t know. He looked in the mirror again at his face, pulling at his cheeks and looking at his arm pits. Still hairy. He seemed to be about 20, but didn&#39;t look like he was getting any younger. Uh oh. He told her to pick, and she had. Oh fuck was going to be 20? He turned and took a step to the bathroom door. He could walk out to the living room and get his phone and just call her back. But he only took one step.<br />
<br />
Then he felt it happen, a pressure building right between his legs that felt itchy then cool all at once. He gasped at the sensation of it. It slowly grew, and quickly he reached down hooking his thumbs under his underwear waistband and pulling them down on to the floor. At the same time he let out a tiny moan feeling something new growing from his crotch, a tightness and a pressure but something also pulling at him.<br />
<br />
He stumbled back two steps back in to the bright light of his bathroom and put a hand on the counter to steady himself as the wave of sensation passed through him. Between his legs he could see his balls turning white and smooth, pushing up in to him. His dick had become hard but was pressing in to his chest, turning pale, then white. The skin turning shiny, then plastic, and he could feel beneath it as he flesh turned to cotton padding. Growing more and more fluff and his diaper grew out of him, from him. He let out another long loud moan while it spread up behind him, covering his ass in white crinkly plastic. A second later more fluffy padding growing from him, giving him an exaggerated bum. The excessive padding was pushing his legs apart now, but before he could reach down he felt the sides grow in to place, the little tape fastening itself and tightening. All at once the sensual waves of pressure and stretching ceased, he stood in his bathroom, panting slightly for a second, then stood up straight and looked sideways to the mirror again, over his sink.<br />
<br />
He was still him, about 20 years old. He had not become a toddler at all, and now he wore a white bulky diaper. He straightened and felt it shift between his legs. So different from what he expected. The sound of plastic crinkled, unmistakable. Even the smell was familiar. He just stood motionless, looking at himself. I&#39;m 20, and wearing a diaper. What am I supposed to do next?  He tried to collect his thoughts, he wanted his phone, he wanted to not be dressed like this, he wanted to tell Aidan to get help.<br />
<br />
He did the first thing that came in to his head: slowly, almost shaking, his hand moved to the front of his diaper, and took a crackly plastic handful of it and massaged himself. It felt far away, padded, cool and slick but warm at the same time. His erection was gone, but it felt like... everything else was too. He bit his lip gently and looked from the mirror to his diaper and pulled harder, nothing. Then he tried to take it off. It held fast, the waistband was stuck to him. No matter how hard he tried he just made more crunchy noises and struggled, but he couldn&#39;t get it off. His breathing came faster. He was panicking now, stuck like this... wait. No. Get your phone. Its just in the living room.<br />
<br />
He looked down to grab his clothes and found them missing. Walking in his padded diaper was a new experience and felt awkward, he had to adjust his legs constantly and found himself wishing he could take it off. Looking around the room he found no trace, where had his shirt and pants gone? The underwear he was wearing just minutes ago was gone. Nate sighed, and let out a long and well earned &quot;Fuuuuuuuck&quot;, concluding that there was no pile of clothes anywhere on the floor of his room.</p>
