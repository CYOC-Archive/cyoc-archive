<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Alright then, if this is real I would rather be as a pony giving rides!&quot; screamed Paul.<br />
<br />
Zepar seemed amused at hearing Paul wailing his feared worry at the prospect of becoming as some vile and brute pig.<br />
<br />
&quot;I bequeath to you my blessing, the body and life as of a truly male pig is something that from my mind's eye best suits someone like you!<br />
<br />
Be you then blessed to live that normalized lifestyle of a boar pig so constantly in a sense of wild rut for having and giving into the wanton need for things of bestial sex. <br />
<br />
Blessed shall you be with such big balls sticking out past your buttocks that a sow seeing them will want for giving them a friendly and alluring licking.<br />
<br />
Such a lick and your sex drive will increase ten fold, driving you to mate her and needing to mate nine more sows as soon as if possible.<br />
<br />
Cursed are you, damned from the day you were born, and by our meeting the curse and damnation shall be complete.&quot; So boasted Zepar, he smiling at Paul; using his demonic shit grin that tells anyone around he has a human where he wants them.<br />
<br />
As if hearing of his vile coming form was not enough to make a grown man want to cry, Paul began to feel the surging wave of pain as what was born human was becoming that made to look like a pig.<br />
<br />
Falling to his knees, Paul looked a gaze up toward Zepar.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this agony necessary?&quot; he groaned out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, and why not, as from giving pain now, when finished of your changing, the lack of pain and the lust for sensation will bring about acceptance of what you are then, A Pig!&quot; Zepar replied, he watches his handiwork begin and take its toll on the human mind, spirit, and the body.<br />
<br />
The wave of burning pain raced throughout his guts, as Paul clutched his arms around changing innards.<br />
<br />
Bones snapped and muscles cramped spreading the agonizing pains to every portion of the body. Paul reeled with the feel of his change; as from what were human legs made muscles and tendons flare.<br />
<br />
A sudden jolt of pain had Paul jerking himself over backwards, falling face down on the floor there before Zepar and with Boot watching too.<br />
<br />
Violent convulsions began to take away what appeared as of human, replacing human tissue with what seemed better of some male pig becoming effectually mature.<br />
<br />
Finally, the Centaur Boot turned around, he not wishing to be reminded of the pain and agony he endured to become the half animal creature, changed by Zepar of body, mind, and soul.<br />
<br />
Paul cried out from the pain, his cries changing to sound as if the squeal of a pig in unutterable agony.<br />
<br />
Paul then lost consciousness, his arms twisting, reshaped to be as forelegs, wrists as if knees, and fingers fusing into cubed small neatly proportioned hooflets.<br />
<br />
Shuddering, as the wealth of pain subsided, Paul opened his changed eyes. Seeing as by being a pig had its differences, as he eyed what was human legs, they all changed, conformed to be a hind like legs, feet and trotters of some mature big boar of a pig.<br />
<br />
Horrified of his new self, but upon seeing the size of what were his testicles, the bulk of them seemed to offer up in his mind a sense of delight and brutal satisfaction.<br />
<br />
Testicles the size of grapefruit hung between his reshaped hind like legs. The volume of hormones pulsing out of them was like the electric charge of a dynamo whirling, sending excitement along the lines to a brain then longingly wanting to change and become as is a boar.<br />
<br />
The hog sheath had grown, matured, toughened and became worthy of any type of weather it needed to face. <br />
<br />
Shivers of chilling thrill tingled in his thighs, legs, and deep into his changed groin.<br />
<br />
Paul eyed with care and delight as he saw how human feet seemed then worthless when compared to the hard hoofs of his new piggish feet.<br />
<br />
Zepar smiled down on his work of recreating something from that which other powers had helped be born as was a human. The demon overlooking his evil work smiled as Paul reminded then of his becoming a beast, felt his tail grow out, wiggling, and coarse bristles flicking their sensation across an anus belonging to a pig.<br />
<br />
Reaching his hind legs out to their farthest stretch possible, Paul strained to give a stretch at his forelegs as well. A popping sound was heard as each vertebra in a changed spine did strengthen his back. <br />
<br />
Yet the worst agony was still to come.<br />
<br />
Feeling as one being embalmed, Paul felt the wrap of new strong muscle fleshing his shoulders, neck, and adding upon his changed frame piggish mass and brute force muscles.<br />
<br />
The ears were first to be drawn outward, becoming oval, mobile at their roots, and then flop eared as proper on a pig. <br />
<br />
Eyes and nasal glands welled with massive change. His skull needed to change, conforming as a human brain felt the crunch of cranial size dwindle and a human brain compressed then to reside into a smaller confinement.<br />
<br />
His nose was the brute force for him to dig for worms and grubs, the food of a pig. Paul felt his human teeth uprooted, they falling to the floor in tinkling sounds, as in the meanwhile pig boar tusks and teeth replaced that kindly human smile.<br />
<br />
Paul groaned and would have cried tears but from those boar testicles came repeated waves of lust and want for things sensual as what it is to be as a pig, a boar, and in the pangs of rut.<br />
<br />
Paul noted how with breathing a heart pumped harder and internal organs accepted a new way of life.<br />
<br />
Slowly Paul stirred and moved his legs as pains calmed and the agony of demonic forced transformation subsided. The floor being quite slippery to even cloven hooves, had Mister Boot walking over to help guide the newly formed big boar to learn how he needed to stand on all four feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Congratulations your change of species is now complete!&quot; said Zepar.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are a meaty big boar hog, and to which I grant unto you the most sensual of male organs! Your probing pecker is as a corkscrew in its shape, the way a boar give a sow her sense of delight, Paul!&quot; said<br />
Zepar, he seemingly giving a note of admiration.<br />
<br />
Paul looked up with his beady orbs of eyes peering around a long snout, sniffing the scent of a demon drenched of sulfur.<br />
<br />
&quot;Again I congratulate you for weathering the forces needed to change the body from one species to another! I was thrilled to put upon you your new and enlarged testicles. I felt an honor about you as the change completed and since you were strong enough to live on I will gift you the mastering of a herd of sow numbering in the thousands.<br />
<br />
Oh, but in time you will feel your big balls wither, and when the comes about, expect to travel and going on a one way trip to the slaughterhouse, I shall redeem your soul into my grasp as you die!&quot;<br />
Zepar taunted Paul, wishing to see a grown boar cry about what he, the devil himself had in store for that young man!<br />
<br />
Mister Boot looked down at Paul as he looked upward at the tall Centaur.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be you off and find your new life as a boar pig, wanting and getting so much sexual pleasures with sows that you might, if so lucky, would forget you ever as a human did exist.&quot; Mr. Boot spake, he wishing for Paul a good life, or as good as what a pig boar might ever have a hope.<br />
<br />
Waddling on slippery floors and of cloven hoofs, Paul made his way from the cursed barn and out into the warmth of a cruel world. He knew he was then as a pig, a boar, and had the longing to show the world at large just how brutal it and he could be together.</p>
