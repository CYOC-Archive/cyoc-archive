<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Heat. At the moment that was all that Jeff could sense around him as Sonya’s diaper. There was no light to be had since he was held securely in place by a onesie and covered with a blanket.  But Sonya’s body heat he could definitely feel as she snoozed through the night. If he were capable of sweating in his current form who would be absolutely drenched right now. Hours would go by as dwelled on that thought when suddenly he was! A torrent of hot urine shot of Sonya into his awaiting padding as the diaper eagerly absorbed it up, his body swelling outwards in the process as the warm wetness spread throughout the diaper. Unfortunately some of his senses came flooding back such as smell and taste as the urine permeated his very being, and they were not pleasant! “Mandy! I’m going to freaking kill you! This is horrible!” Jeff screamed internally.  Despite the obvious relief of letting such a large amount of pee out while she slept, Sonya didn’t even budge during this whole ordeal and slept through until morning - thanks mostly to the diaper - err - Jeff - doing it’s job of keeping her dry.  <br />
<br />
More hours would go by, the warm ur one having since becoming cold and clammy, before Sonya began to stir and awake. First she rolled over and then got into a sitting position on her knees which twisted and stretched Jeff until her weight was put upon him once more as she sat on the back of her legs. A moment later, she pulled herself up by the crib bars and got into a standing position. Jeff was still snugly secured around her waist thanks to the onesie and still couldn’t see much though a little light to filter through now thanks to the absence of the blanket. It was at this point Sonya unleashed yet another torrent of urine into her already soaked and swelling diaper, causing him to expand outward even more so as it continued to absorb the offensive substance, Jeff now straining against the onesie that no longer felt snug but now tight and restricting   <br />
<br />
Meanwhile,  back at his house -<br />
<br />
Mandy woke up earlier than usual to sneak back into Jeff’s room and opened up his laptop with the Chronivac  program still running. “I wonder how nerdy faired the night as a Sonya’s diaper!?” She said to herself. She opened up Jeff the diaper’s profile and see the following prompt:<br />
<br />
Former Name: Jeff Davis<br />
Object: Pampers Baby Dry, Size 4. <br />
Location: Johnson Residence / Nursery / Changing Table<br />
User: Sonya Johnson / Girl / 18 months<br />
Status: Used, wet only. Still worn by user. <br />
Retrieve back to home location?: type YES / NO<br />
<br />
Mandy smiled with glee knowing that her brother had suffered so, and completely unknown by his wearer to boot! But she wanted a piece of him for herself too! Shockingly Mandy didn’t wet her diaper while she slept and woke up dry… “I’ll have to fix that once Jeff gets back here” she said to herself. Mandy went back into Jeff’s profile and made a couple of changes so that he would fit her and also made it so that only she would be aware of his predicament . Mandy then typed YES on the command prompt and hit enter. <br />
<br />
Back at the neighbors house…<br />
<br />
When Sonya’s mother Claire finally came into the room to greet Sonya good morning - Jeff was completely soaked and he was kind of shocked he didn’t leak at all. When Claire picked up Sonya out of the crib and brought her to the changing table, Jeff could feel as he was moved with her across the room before Sonya was lowered down onto the table and her weight put back upon him. He felt as Claire undid the onesie and flipped back the flaps - light shined upon him now as he looked up at Claire who seemed totally unfazed by his current state - but he was just a diaper after all and did what a diaper was supposed to do. Claire reached down and ripped the tabs of his arms and legs open before folding him down and beginning the cleaning process. He could see now with his body laying flat against the table but he could feel as Sonya’s bottom was lighted off of him and wipes were deposited into him. In A moment he was folding in half again and could see as Claire pulled him out for underneath her daughter and set him aside, grabbing a clean diaper and securing it to her. Once she was done she returned her attention to Jeff and rolled him up into a “ball” before taping his arms and legs around the soaked mass and moving him towards the diaper pail. He watched in horror as her foot below stepped on a pedal and the lid popped open before being casually let go. Just as he was about to land in the pail a bright flash engulfed him.<br />
<br />
When Jeff came to once again he realized he was back in his house, his room for that matter, and his little sister Sonya was starting down at him with a huge smile on her face! He also realized that he no longer felt full but rather white empty and smelled… well clean. But something still wasn’t right. He was human again and Mandy seemed like a giantess above him. He also could move which means Mandy didn’t actually restore him! <br />
<br />
“Hello my beautiful diaper Jeffpers! I hope you had fun at the neighbors house! But it’s my turn to have some fun now!” Mandy said to him as she picked him and held him in front of her waist and in front of a mirror so that he could see what he had become. Jeff couldn’t believe it! Not only did Mandy not restore him but he was still a diaper! And by the looks of it he looked less like a baby diaper and more like something that would fit Mandy!<br />
<br />
Mandy then</p>
