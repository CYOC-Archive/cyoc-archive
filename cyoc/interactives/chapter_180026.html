<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The women filed into a second laboratory smaller than the first. Here, a large glass tube took up the center of the room. A row of Standing Polymer Generators stood against one of the walls, their captives moaning in pleasure as technicians inserted and removed black cylinders from their rubberized holes. As with the previous room, there was a group of female prisoners accompanied by guards. These girls seemed more frightened than the ones from before and they constantly struggled against their handcuffs, their eyes focused on the glass tube.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, the problem with the Standing Polymer Generators is that they&#39;re quite bulky,&quot; Dr. Morris explained. &quot;Based on the principles we&#39;ve derived from the SPGs, we developed a way to store that power and release it in a convenient form. With our special latex polymer and a human core bonded to it, we can directly store orgone energy with capacity-to-weight ratios that surpass any electrical battery on the market.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. Morris led Melissa and the others to the large glass tube and made a signal to the guarding soldiers, who brought a terrified prisoner in front of the tube. A technician opened the door and the prisoner was indifferently pushed in; the glass door slammed shut behind her. The orange-jumpsuited young woman banged on the glass tube, crying and screaming in obvious terror. &quot;No, no, no! Please let me out!&quot; she shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;What a baby,&quot; Dr. Morris snorted. She flipped a switch on a nearby control panel, starting the conversion process.<br />
<br />
Shiny black liquid began pouring into the glass chamber from above, and the trapped girl shrieked as it splattered over her head and body. She tried to pull it off with her hands fruitlessly, then tried to bash the reinforced glass with her shoulder with no luck. She sputtered as the shimmering goo invaded her mouth and crept all around the private folds of her body. Her prison duds dissolved into the latex, leaving her naked. The young woman fell to her knees, desperately trying to scrape the latex off her body as it completely covered her. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, she gasped and grabbed her pussy in shock. The latex-coated girl felt her clit grow, swelling and expanding until it became a fully-formed penis jutting from above her vagina and dripping with liquid rubber. She shrieked as she looked down at her new appendage, but she had no time to appreciate it before she was suddenly yanked upwards by a pseudopod of latex.<br />
<br />
The young woman was now suspended in the center of the glass tube by a column of glistening black rubber. She thrashed and kicked, but the sloshing column held her firmly in place. She yelped as her legs were jerked forwards by the latex coating her skin. With the creaking noise of moving rubber, her legs were stretched back until they reached behind the girl&#39;s head so that she adopted a pretzel pose. Her eyes rolled into the back of her head and her tongue lolled out; the contortion of the girl&#39;s body was apparently extremely pleasurable. Now the latex pulled her arms so that she was hugging her thighs, then forced her head backwards so that her open mouth faced directly upwards. The latex-coated young woman was now held in a position that lewdly emphasized her naked body and erect cock.<br />
<br />
With a mechanical whir, the glass vessel entered compression mode. The glossy latex pulsed as it began to constrict around the girl, forcing her into a tighter and tighter position. Now she was moaning in pure ecstasy; her senses were clearly overloaded by the sensitivity of her newly rubberized body.<br />
<br />
As the animate rubber squeezed, the girl was slowly warped into a less human shape. Her cries of pleasure were muffled as the air in her fully converted body was pushed out; she no longer needed it. Her figure became flatter as her legs and arms were pressed into her sides, leaving the young woman in the vague shape of a cylinder. Her blissful face was on one end and her penis stuck out from the other, with only a lumpy tube in between. The incredible squeezing sensations were bringing her mind to the brink of madness.<br />
<br />
Now the compression entered its final stage. &quot;Hphhh... hphhh... hrrmmPPHHHUOOO!&quot; The remolded girl&#39;s lips swelled and molded themselves into a puffy O and her throat was reshaped into a ribbed shaft. At the same time, the latex squeezed definitively, compressing what was left of the girl into a perfectly smooth cylinder and flattening her face into rounded nothingness. Only her penis, jutting from the end of the cylinder, was left intact. This was the final straw; the throbbing cock jerked violently as it spurted out a gush of shiny liquid latex.<br />
<br />
The column of rubber collapsed back into thick, glistening slime. The remaining latex drained from the glass vessel, leaving behind only a twitching black tube with a penis on one end and a hole on the other.<br />
<br />
A technician opened the latch on the door of the glass vessel, which opened with a hiss of steam. Dr. Morris reached into the vessel and picked up the latex cylinder.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is the Polymer Battery Module, ladies. Isn&#39;t it beautiful?&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa stared at the shiny black cylinder in horror. The Standing Polymer Generator was bad enough. Now she had just seen a terrified woman unwillingly transformed into a fleshlight. She watched the thing&#39;s dick twitch and pulse. Was that poor girl still alive in there?<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about the girl,&quot; Dr. Morris said. &quot;She&#39;s still alive, and enjoying her new life quite a bit.&quot; The doctor stuck out her tongue and slowly licked the PBM&#39;s cock from base to tip, making it squirm even harder. Dr. Morris laughed jovially.<br />
<br />
Melissa was no prude, but this was too much. She covered her mouth and averted her eyes, face red as a beet.<br />
<br />
One of the blushing members of the tour group asked a pertinent question: &quot;Ma&#39;am, is the dick really necessary?&quot; Dr. Morris lowered the PBM and looked at the woman. The good doctor seemed almost offended.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course it is!&quot; she replied. &quot;You see, the human penis is designed to discharge material, while the human mouth and vagina are designed to receive it. When nature gives you a perfectly good mechanism, you take it. We simply replaced the semen with energy.&quot; Dr. Morris gestured to the glossy black cylinder in her hand. Its cock twitched desperately, hoping for more stimulation. &quot;Naturally, since the special polymer doesn&#39;t bond with males, we have to make some alterations to the female host.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, the Polymer Battery Module is designed for use with the Standing Polymer Generator. It&#39;s all very intuitive; just stick the charging interface into any orifice.&quot; Dr. Morris walked over to one of the jiggling rubber walls and thrust the battery&#39;s dick into the generator&#39;s mouth hole. The two devices shivered intensely and the latex woman in the wall let out a muffled cry of bliss.<br />
<br />
&quot;The orgone flux between the two is so great that the PBM charges to full almost instantly,&quot; Dr. Morris remarked, and pulled the battery out with a wet pop. &quot;It can now be used for anything from charging your phone to powering a flashlight.&quot;<br />
<br />
She picked up an object that appeared to be an adapter; it had a long, rounded cylinder on one end and a standard power outlet on the other. Dr. Morris plugged the device into what was once a mouth, causing the PBM to twitch. She picked up the plug of a desktop fan and plugged it into the adapter. With the circuit completed, the fan whirred to life and the PBM shook as if in the throes of a powerful orgasm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our little friend will be able to run this fan for about 12 hours before it needs a recharge,&quot; Dr. Morris said brightly.<br />
<br />
She picked up a lightbulb from the countertop. &quot;By the way, both the male and female ports of the Polymer Battery Module function as a power supply.&quot; Dr. Morris held up the battery, still plugged into the adapter through its former mouth, and gently touched the lightbulb to the tip of its penis. The lightbulb lit up; the twitching latex tube started to convulse even harder. Dr. Morris giggled like a schoolgirl as she watched the battery&#39;s orgasmic torment.<br />
<br />
Satisfied, Dr. Morris removed the lightbulb and the adapter. &quot;The most interesting part of the Polymer Battery Module is that it&#39;s - well, modular. We can attach multiple PBMs together to create a much more powerful battery, and all it takes is a bit of physical compression.&quot;<br />
<br />
She walked over to a machine with her PBM in hand. Melissa and the others hesitantly followed. This machine looked a bit like an enormous vice. It had a long, cylindrical trench in the center with a compressing plate on one end.<br />
<br />
An intern in a lab coat rushed over to Dr. Morris with a box of more PBMs. Each one was an identical latex tube with a cock at one end and a cushioned hole at the other. The lewd batteries shifted with the squeaking sound of rubber on rubber, apparently trying to stimulate themselves on each other.<br />
<br />
Dr. Morris picked up one of the PBMs and jammed its dick into the first PBM&#39;s hole. The two batteries started to squirm as if trying to thrust into one another. Melissa&#39;s tour group watched mystified as Dr. Morris and the intern attached more and more PBMs into one long conga line of rubbery cock until there were six altogether.<br />
<br />
The two women in lab coats lowered the jittering mass of latex into the vice. On one end of the extended tube was its only open hole, in which the intern carefully inserted a phallic metal rod. On the other was the dick of the very first PBM, whose creation Melissa had watched. Dr. Morris shoved this through an opening at the end of the vice so that only the dick was sticking out.<br />
<br />
Dr. Morris stepped back as the intern started to crank the vice. Melissa and the other soldiers watched as the rubbery column of batteries began to shrink. Over the course of about 30 seconds, the vice compressed the latex batteries together to the size of a single battery, the exposed cock at the end throbbing harder and harder as the individual modules pressed into one another. With a grunt, the intern finished cranking, and a thick gout of liquid latex suddenly gushed from the exposed penis all over the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Crap!&quot; Dr. Morris spat. &quot;I forgot the bucket.&quot;<br />
<br />
She told the intern to get a mop and clean up the spill before someone tripped on it. Then she turned towards the touring soldiers. &quot;Don&#39;t step in that stuff on your way out, unless you want to make a direct contribution to the polymeric sciences.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway.&quot; Dr. Morris plucked the compressed battery from the vice, wiping the still-dripping cock on the lab countertop. She removed the metallic dildo from its hole. <br />
<br />
&quot;When you compress six Polymer Battery Modules into one, you get the full Polymer Battery Complex - or, as we call them in the lab, a 6-pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was the size and shape of a normal PBM, with one ribbed shaft and one erect cock on a thick latex cylinder, but it had five seams in the middle showing where its component batteries fused together. It quivered as if permanently in orgasm.<br />
<br />
&quot;A 6-pack has six times the charge capacity and six times the potential voltage with almost the same mass,&quot; Dr. Morris said. &quot;With this kind of charge, gasoline vehicles are a thing of the past. A Humvee can run for hours on two of these 6-packs. A light plane can fly on just eight. And we&#39;ve already got working prototypes for tanks and fighter jets powered purely through polymer-based charge.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. Morris idly stroked the 6-pack&#39;s cock with her latex-gloved hand, making the whole battery shiver with pleasure. &quot;Infinite clean energy! Imagine that. Just a decade ago it would have been a fever dream, but once this tech is declassified, the whole world could be driving around in latex-powered cars in a few years.&quot; She thought for a second. &quot;There is the issue of finding enough cores for the batteries, of course... but there are countless down-on-their-luck women who would gladly give their humanity to ensure their family&#39;s future.&quot;<br />
<br />
The doctor placed the rubber battery down. &quot;Now, let&#39;s move on to the latest and greatest in polymeric orgone manipulation. Follow along, ladies.&quot; She moved through a nearby door at a brisk pace, and the flustered soldiers scrambled to catch up with her.<br />
<br />
After witnessing that perverted series of events, though, Melissa hesitated. What Dr. Morris had said resonated with her. A light plane flew on eight six-packs? That was 48 human souls turned into latex... Were the top brass really going to roll out woman-powered Humvees to every G.I. Joe and Jane on the field? She shook her head, trying to clear those thoughts out of her mind. She was only a soldier, and her job was to follow orders, whatever they may be. She bumbled to her feet and went after the others.</p>
