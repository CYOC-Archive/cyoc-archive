<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&nbsp; <b> A couple minutes later </b><br />
“Ah, there you are Tom, let’s head home, we have a long day of ‘chores’ to do,” Rachel said grabbing Tom’s arm. We all then headed back to Rachel’s and Tom’s, still nervous about going to talk to my parents, also for what Rachel has in store.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <b> Back at home </b><br />
“Heather and Tom, you know the ruling from this morning, <i>STRIP! </i> and Heather, in my room with me, and Tom make lunch, okay?” Rachel states taking her top off heading upstairs with all my new clothes in hand. I hear Tom sigh, we look at each other, he shrugs, then heads to his room while I follow Rachel. I enter the room to see Rachel naked, posed like a superhero waiting for me to enter, “Your clothes are hidden and you won’t ever find them until you are nude!” Rachel declares ripping my pants down to my feet. I start to continue to undress while Rachel sits on her bed spread legged, watching me. I take off the last article of cloting when she shoves me out, and presumably hides it with the rest of my new clothes. She opens the door and drags me to her brothers room, “Tom are you decent yet?” Rachel asked. “Yea, just finished, coming out now.”<br />
The three of us stood upstairs nude, Tom’s dick slightly shorter than mine, all three of us sporting bush, and Rachel’s breasts sitting still perky, sagging slightly. We then head downstairs to the livingroom, Tom heading to the kitchen to make some lunch. “Alright Heather, fist things first, I’m going to need you to —“<br />
&nbsp; There was a knocking at the door, Rachel walked over and noticed Heather’s parents visualy distraut. Rachel opens the door slightly to peek her head out, “Okay, so I know what you are going to ask, but let me just start by saying that Heather freaked out, and I’m helping her through what happened,” Rachel said opening the door and pointing towards me, “Heather saw an ad for a potion that caused her to change gender, she freaked out came here and I’ve been consoling her since.”<br />
“Hi mom, dad, I’m Heather, Rachel isn’t lying, I fresked out, stole a shirt and sandals from you dad so I could get here last night, and Rachel has been helping me figure this out. I organized my room for when I figured this out and came to you, and I should have done this instantly, but look… I’m a boy now not a girl and it’s insane to try and comprehend, and then also now realizing I haven’t said why we both are naked, and it’s nothing, I’ve not done anything, it’s Rachels idea,” I blurt out in a torrent. Both my parents rush over and hug me, “Oh baby, we’re just happy you are alright. Thank you Rachel for being such a great friend. We’re here for you Heather, whenever you are wanting to come home after whatever this is, we’ll deal with changing your room, school applications, everything for when you get home,” both parents said taking turns on points, “be safe! and I mean <i> be safe! </i> you two,” mom added on, they both left leaving myself and Rachel still standing there naked. Rachel closed the door and turned around, “Alright now, I guess foods resdy first, then back to what we were about to do.”<br />
&nbsp; The three of us ate lunch, a weight off my shoulders allowing me to relax knowing I’ve talked to my parents now. “So did they comment on your penis length?” Tom asked as he finished his meal, “because it’s no slouch, though it may have been a bit weird.”<br />
“I’m just relieved that it’s dealt with, and now am a bit more open to deal with you Rachel,” I say moving my empty dish to the sink.<br />
“Now you get go do double Heather,” Rachel said squeezing my testicles slightly putting her dish in the sink as well.<br />
&nbsp; The three of us now are in the livingroom, Rachel leaning over to Tom and whispering something in his ear, he then get’s up leaving Rachel and myself alone, “He’ll be back, and then fun, so relax, calm down.” I look skeptically at her but lay back, a minute later Tom returns, Rachel sits right next to me on the couch, our hips touching and arms rubbing against each other. “Sit back relax, look into the watchface, follow the watchface, you can see the ticking slowly make you ease up, your eyes slowly close as it hits the pendulem end, tired, sleepy, the watch is safe, it’s comfortable…” Tom starts to chant Rachel and I into a hypnosis slump.<br />
<b><i> temporarily pseudo TP in * because technically hypnotized </i></b><br />
&nbsp; We wake up, *Rachel and I swapped bodied* and I see my body across from me, “what happened now?” I look down and see Rachel’s body, “damn, I just have to, I missed this.” I plung ‘my’ fingers into ‘my’ vagina staring at my body’s cock, Rachel starts to stir, “Why am I seeing myself masturbate?” She looks down and see’s ‘her’ dick, “damn so Heather, your in my body?”<br />
I nod, increasing intensity, “nah I want to feel my pussy with your dick,” Rachel says pulling ‘me’ ontop of ‘her’ and inserting ‘her’ penis. “Oh god! This is amazing!” We both yell, thrusting quickly.<br />
<b> sleep </b><br />
&nbsp; I wake up to Rachel sitting on my lap, my penis penetrating her vagina *Rachel and I are stuck like this* and I try and move her but she won’t budge, “Hey Rachel, we seem to be stuck.”<br />
“It wouldn’t be the worst thing to be stuck like this would it?” Rachel said looking down at our ‘joined’ groins. “Yea it would, because a permanent boner because of your pussy sounds like pain.” I try and move her again, pulling so hard I’m lifting my crotch off the couch. “Eh, may as well have fun stuck like this…” Rachel purred trying to independantly move her hips but failing, “oh, so we can’t even with how stuck we are.”<br />
<b> sleep </b><br />
&nbsp; *I’m a dog, Rachel my owner* I wake up, hop off the couch, “here boy, time to lick up some peanut butter,” Rachel said while her pussy, nipples and mouth are covered in peanut butter. I start licking her pussy, the peanut butter seemed to dissapear, “yes baby dog bitch Heather, ohhh… next spot please,” Rachel saidafter her cum coated my face from that orgasm. I move from spot to spot until I get to her mouth where Rachel starts licking her own pussy juice off my face.<br />
<b> sleep </b><br />
&nbsp; *I’m the owner, Rachel’s a cat* I wake up, my cat is purring at my feet, I call her to sit up, she starts to bat at my penis like it was a tail toy. “There you go, now lay down,” I order, Rachel lays on her back, her breasts now like pancakes. I start to rub her stomach with my penis, Rachel purring in happiness, I then insert it into her pussy, “Is kitty ready to play bounce?” Rachel starts purring in eagerness, I slowly start to pump my penis into Rachel.<br />
<b> sleep </b><br />
&nbsp; *Rachel’s breasts produce food for me, My penis is food for Rachel* I wake up, look over and see Rachel start to wake up as well, “Hey Rachel, I’m starting to want some food, do you mind?” I ask leaning towards her breasts. “Not if you don’t, I’m starving,” Rachel replies her mouth stuffed full of my penis.” We both suck *mentally I’m feeling full Rachel isn’t lactating* I’m getting full slowly when finally I feel the final shock and cum in Rachel’s mouth. She sucks down every last drop, “damn, you were hungry,” I say feeling tired. “Yea, I guess I was,” she said licking her lips. She leaned towards me while I lay on the floor and kissed me.<br />
<b> sleep </b><br />
&nbsp; “Alright you two, you guys have fun?” Tom’s voice came from nowhere, I open my eyes and notice both Rachel and my bodied covered in sweat, our heads close, tasting Rachel’s cum aftertaste. I slowly get up, untangling myself from Rachel, “Did we actually?” I asked looking at Tom.<br />
“No, you were edging until she gave you that blowjob, she came a few times though,” Tom replied going to go get some towels for the mess on the hardwood livingroom floor.<br />
“Rachel, wake up,” I say rocking her slightly.<br />
“But I’m still tired,” Rachel moaned, I kissed her forehead, “well if that’s the case Heather.”<br />
Rachel leans on one arm, her breasts following gravity, I push her breast causing it to sway slightly, she flicks my penis.<br />
“That was great, but make sure Tom get’s rid of any triggers,” I say as Tom returns throwing us towels.<br />
“All the triggers are gone, I promise,” Tom said, “now go shower so I can clean this area.”<br />
I get up, Rachel uses my penis to help herself to her feet, and we both head to the shower after making sure we don’t drip along the way.</p>
