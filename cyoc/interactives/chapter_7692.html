<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty now knew where he should apply his powers next. 'he's just sitting there, waiting for me to change him' Ty thought... 'Well, what will make a girl like him? he does look a little young, maybe if he was more manly'<br />
<br />
&quot;thats it&quot; he quietly said aloud. 'i wish that Matt will grow more and more manly until the end of class' he wished silently to himself.<br />
Then Ty turned over to Matt, who was just sitting there, not doing much of anything, staring off at chalkboard...<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Ty, what are you doing this weekend?&quot; Matt asked. &quot;not much of anything at the moment, at least i don't have anything planned&quot; Ty replied. <br />
<br />
Class began with Mr. Stiel asking the class: &quot;what is the highest mountain in the world?&quot; and then in almost unison, the class replied &quot;Mount Everest!&quot; <br />
&quot;and do you know how those mountains were formed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;India rammed into Asia&quot; One kid in the back piped up. <br />
<br />
&quot;very good, Today we are starting a new lesson on plate tectonics, and I'm sure you guys know what that is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;will this be on the test next week?&quot; another student asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;i haven't decided&quot; Mr Steil replied calmly<br />
<br />
And so the class droned on and on in this manner. Mr. Stiel asking general questions to the class, and one or two students answering it. This, of course, held no interest for Ty, who was wondering how his good friend next to him was doing. After about 5 minutes of this questioning, Ty looked over to Matt, who still looked normal. <br />
<br />
Matt grabbed a piece of paper out of his back pack and started to write some things down on it, take notes, as well as doodle. Ty watched him &quot;what are you drawing?&quot; &quot;oh, oh nothing...&quot; Matt replied in an uncharacteristically low voice. &quot;just nothing really&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt's voice did sound a little deeper, Ty thought, but he wondered what else was happening... Ty even liked this class, and Mr. Stiel, but it felt so slow today... Ty slowly counted the minutes as they passed. a good 15 minutes had passed since class had started, and a good a 13 minutes had passed since his wish. Matt leaned over to grab a pencil that was about to fall off the deck, moving his arms, Ty watched Matt's forearms move forward to grab the pencil. They did seem unusually hairy, to Ty's memory, Matt wasn't that hairy... <br />
<br />
It is working... he thought, he knew. if i could only see the other changes...Matt started to fuddle with his shoes. Ty realized he had just taken them off, and then Matt had a slightly nervous look on his face. &quot;why'd you take your shoes off&quot; he asked Matt quietly. &quot;oh, they, uh, felt a little uncomfortable, i don't know why...&quot;<br />
<br />
Yep, his voice was definitely deeper. Not a lot deeper, but a bit. Not only that, but Ty noticed his shirt seemed a little smaller on him than before, his pecs showed through the white fabric of his shirt, where they hadn't before. Ty was sure of it, Matt was growing. <br />
<br />
Time moved slowly in that class, Ty eagerly awaited every possibly minute to pass, so he could observe any changes in him. after five more minutes, Ty noticed something, Matt eyebrows seemed heavier, and hairier. The dark hair had thickened, he just knew it. And actually, Matt was looking older than before... at least a year older. His jawline had grown more defined, his face had become more handsome. It was quite noticeable. Ty also saw that his white shirt had seemed to have shrunk on him, or, rather, he was starting to fill it out. Biceps showed from the shorter sleeves... they looked shorter anyway, and they revealed a now muscular arm. His Pecs were now even more clearly defined then before, he was positive. <br />
<br />
Even more revealing was the fact that Matt was starting itch all over his stomach and chest. Matt scratched himself, and seemed to realize that his shirt was smaller on him now... or really, he was bigger in it. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, Matt, how are you?&quot; Ty asked casually. &quot;uh uh, actually I itch at the moment&quot; And then he chuckled a bit. Ty wondered if he should say something... he DID look older now, how much Ty wasn't sure, and his brows were heavier, now he could easily pass for an 18 year old. 'Other people are going to notice, if they haven't already' Matt slouched over onto his desk. Ty looked behind him to see a few people in the class were in fact looking at Matt. Turning around in his seat, Ty could see why. Matt's once loose shirt was hugging his upper back and shoulders, and had shortened considerably, leaving nearly all of his lower back exposed, and his green plaid boxers. Ty noticed a trail of thin dark hair led from his boxers up his back a little ways before disappearing underneath his shirt. Everyone was becoming aware that Matt was changing, Ty was sure after looking at the reaction of Lindsey, who sat right behind him... At that moment, Matt's hand reached back to feel his exposed lower back, and tried to cover it with the shirt. Matt pulled down on the fabric, loosening it, and pulling it down half way. Matt stopped slouching and sat back up. <br />
<br />
Just then, Ty realized how much taller Matt had grown, just sitting in his seat, Ty now had to look up at Matt, instead of him being just at eye level. Matt shoulders looked even more broad as he sat straight up in proper posture...<br />
<br />
Ty looked up at the clock, and back to Matt, who was feeling his chest and his now tight white shirt...</p>
