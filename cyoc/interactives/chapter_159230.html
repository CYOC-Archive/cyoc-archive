<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Animalian conversions always had their tricky sides to them, particularly in relation to how the Human mind adapted to the new Animalian instincts that often related to the animal who&#39;s DNA the conversion was used for. For while Animalia had its Edicts that forbade predatory Animalians from eating herbivorous Animalians, there were obvious signs where Animalians that might be potential food for others would be nervous around the Animalians that in nature would be their predators. Doctor Jones had even observed that with the Wolf Animalian officers with the Animalia PD when they interacted with any Deer Animalians on the streets, regardless of which species of deer. The Deer Animalians often double checked to make sure that there was no hunting. Thus it also made sense that animal instincts might clash with the Human mind post transformation.<br />
<br />
At first, things seemed generally fine in that regard as Animalians all seemed to get along and the worst that ended up running into was in relation things that didn&#39;t necessarily relate to instinctive behaviors. Such as finding that becoming an Animalian, and even if only single dosed with some species, had left the new Animalian too big for their clothes, bed, or most other furniture. With that being the limit of the problem, Horizon and Animalia managed to shrug off most of the potential criticisms. Then came the twin blows of Heather Wilcox&#39;s attack on Lyre High and Regressive Hypersexuality Disorder appearing in various converted Animalians, and particularly those that were older when they became Animalians. One was an instance in which an unprepared person gained a sudden rush of predatory instincts that fueled a psyche that was already angry and not terribly interested in resisting those instincts. The other was a condition that seemed to raise Animalian libidos, which were already higher than most normal Humans, to levels where things like flirtation and potentially worse could happen with the new Animalian.<br />
<br />
These problems were all things that could be dealt with, and generally were. The incident with Heather Wilcox changed how Horizon was allowed to sell the Animalia Virus and increased the regulations for testing and understanding the animal in question. Thus if anyone had bad reactions to the instincts, they would at least be in a controlled setting and would leave after &quot;calming down&quot; as Heather ultimately did. It also helped with those suspected to have Regressive Hypersexuality Syndrome, though the big thing there was more to work with things related to therapy. While Doctor Jones had originally come to run his clinic to help those who were looking for love, and he still did do a fair amount of work in that department, he&#39;d found that many of cases he heard related to instinctual issues and Regressive Hypersexuality Disorder, though it was the former that brought him to Horizon.<br />
<br />
&quot;There you are Doctor Jones,&quot; Miss Fabina said to him as came along one of Horizon&#39;s hallways, &quot;come to see Animalia&#39;s Honey Badgers?&quot;<br />
<br />
The white furred Canine Animalian shook her head toward to sets of doors with Judy standing on the other side of her. It was an indication of two people that Miss Fabina had helped select the Animalian they wished to become and referred them to Doctor Jones for some sessions regarding their personalities and how they would match with Animalian instinct, and specifically the &quot;fearlessness&quot; that was often attributed to Honey Badger, a species of Mustelid that had won some popularity for its behaviors. One was Aida, who in her session with Doctor Jones came off as rather timid and shy and it had been suggested that becoming a Honey Badger might help her confidence. The other was a woman named Tomi who carried a great deal of confidence with her, along with a fair amount of muscle mass.<br />
<br />
Between the two women, Doctor Jones figured the greatest risk was with Tomi. For while Honey Badgers were certainly tenacious, that fearless attitude could get them into real trouble in Africa or India in the wild, and Tomi&#39;s tomboyish nature could easily fall victim to that sort of thing and irritate someone to the point where a fight could break out, and against some of the larger Animalians, such bravado would not end well. Aida was more of a question mark, for while certain elements of a converted Human&#39;s psyche did change after the transformation, it generally wasn&#39;t enough to say that the transformation would make her more confident and outgoing. In this, both would likely need at least some continued therapy, but Doctor Jones would need to see how both turned out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will admit to being a bit curious,&quot; Doctor Jones answered in response, &quot;though, admittedly I can&#39;t say anything without breaking confidentiality. I can say I feel they well be fine, but that&#39;s a fairly general statement.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m not asking for anything specific,&quot; Miss Fabina replied, &quot;just hoping to see that Aida and Tomi do well and are pleased with what they become and are at least friendly with each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Given their personalities... that could be difficult,&quot; Doctor Jones replied, &quot;but... I suppose in theory it IS possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was then that one of the doors opened and a black furred head with a silver top peaked out from inside the room. The eyes retained the color that the human woman that had gone in had, and her human hair also remained. The hair actually contrasted a bit with the black and silver coloration that the Honey Badger was known for. Doctor Jones did note the look of recognition that flashed through the Animalian&#39;s eyes as she looked to Miss Fabina and then to Judy and finally to himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um,&quot; the Honey Badger Animalian spoke in a somewhat meek voice, which Doctor Jones recognized as Aida&#39;s, &quot;I&#39;m afraid I might need new clothes. For... I&#39;m a bit bigger in certain places and the transformation was rather... nice…&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is okay,&quot; Miss Fabina assured Aida, &quot;everyone who converts gets bigger in places. Women get a bigger bust line and wider hips... men get more muscle and a larger... shall I say &quot;joystick,&quot; if you catch my meaning. And that&#39;s regardless on the type of Animalian one becomes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aida slowly nodded, but stayed within the room so that Doctor Jones couldn&#39;t see in, though not that he was trying to. She looked over Judy who stood on the other side of Miss Fabina.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we do have spare clothes for Animalians of all sizes,&quot; Judy assured her, &quot;though, we cannot refurbish your entire wardrobe. We can give clean clothes to wear out, if you&#39;ve outgrown your old attire. Thus you will likely need to go shopping for some items...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can do that,&quot; Aida said a bit forcefully. It wasn&#39;t aggressive or mean spirited, but it was a slight bit more forceful than what either Miss Fabina or Doctor Jones had heard from Aida, &quot;but right now I&#39;m naked...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Understandable,&quot; Judy answered without missing a beat, &quot;but since you and Tomi came in with Miss Fabina as your &quot;sponsor,&quot; you may have to wait until she is ready... It&#39;ll save on trips and make any last forms that may need to be signed easier to handle. It shouldn&#39;t take too long.&quot;<br />
<br />
And they didn&#39;t have to wait too long as the door to the changing room that Tomi was in and the new Honey Badger Animalian stood totally naked in the doorway and looking quite pleased with herself. The black fur around vagina looked a bit matted, which gave everyone a vague idea of what she had been up to. She was still quite trim and held a fairly muscular frame, however some of the Honey Badger&#39;s adaptations, which helped contribute to its reputation, shown through. The outline of her biceps and abdominal muscles were only barely visible and the enhanced muscles underneath her enlarged breasts were not visible at all. Most likely a result of the &quot;loose skin&quot; that Honey Badgers had that helped prevent predators from getting a grip on them. Her skin couldn&#39;t sit tightly against her muscle and still be &quot;loose.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m ready,&quot; Tomi announced confidently, &quot;You will need to clean the bed though...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is part of the process after conversions,&quot; Judy answered with a small frown, &quot;Now if you&#39;ll excuse me, I&#39;ll get you both some clothes...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t see Aida anywhere,&quot; Tomi answered and then added in Japanese, &quot;Meek little mouse girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m naked!&quot; Aida answered with her head through the doorway to her room, &quot;so I&#39;m not flaunting myself for anyone and everyone to see.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey Badger don&#39;t care,&quot; Tomi answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;The law will,&quot; Doctor Jones spoke quietly.<br />
<br />
Tomi gave a grunt at that.</p>
