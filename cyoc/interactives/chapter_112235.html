<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">as Madame Illustria spun the wheel once more that she chuckled again after she called him Rudolph with those antlers Tyler now had on his new head of his. he still was trying to protest and call out to turn back, but all you can do was call out with deer calls and noises as the audience were clapping their hands for the next change to come. while he was watching the wheel spin around and around till it started to slow down with every pass in the corner of his eye that even she caught sight of what he was seeing till it came to a stop.<br />
<br />
&quot;What luck!&quot; Madame Illusia exclaimed as No one in the audience, not even Tyler himself, knew what the wheel landed on until the engravements started to change. The etchings began to glow and rearranged themselves until they were english letters so everyone can read what it said, including Tyler as his face went pale when he saw where the needle was pointing on. it was directly pointing onto &quot;Fox tail&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;A Fox Tail? I don&#39;t want to grow a tail!&quot; he thought to himself with a panic that He tried to protest, but still made noises of the deer as she then walked over to him and whispered into his ear while holding him from behind like anyone would do with a hug. &quot;calm down big boy, i hear that some foxes have there tails to be very good lucky. you should be very lucky that you&#39;re growing one.&quot; she whispered into his ear while playing with his grin area as the transformation took him over.<br />
<br />
he began to feel something pushing out against his skin that His hands were still immobilized, so all he could do was turn his head to look as a warm wave went down and around his butthole. Soon Something was growing right above his ass as he felt his tail bone starts to push out against the skin of his but. It dawned on Tyler after a moment&#39;s thoughts as he was growing one lucky fox tail. His tailbone continued to push out further and further, away from the rest of his body that he was Eyeing it intently. when the formation peaks its way to A very tip of the tail that Tyler thought it would never end when The growth subsided once the tail was at least one foot long as he then tested it out and practice moving around the naked fox tail.<br />
<br />
when the fur began to sprout out from the base of his tail where the goat fur ended is where the red fur began growing over his tail that It was quickly spreading over it like a wildfire. when the fur almost covered his tail from the base of his spine to the near tip of his tail that white fur grew in at the end of his tail, giving him a dipstick tail look. It felt strange, fur against fur.<br />
<br />
As the fur finished growing, Tyler stumbled a bit as he&#39;s not use to his new balance with his tail now. soon he fell awkwardly on his butt, squishing his tail in the process. at least the long lasting transformation had stopped as Tyler soon got to his feet/hooves that The audience clapped and cheered, while Madame Illusia beckoned for Tyler to come to her. following her orders as the protest was building in Tyler&#39;s mouth and mind, but as he was about to struggle with some deer sounds to her that she then suddenly, without warning, kissed him on his deer lips as he were shocked and gasped for what she had done. The audience also gasped as well as the protest started to fade and died down that Tyler started to join in on the kiss.<br />
<br />
Tyler was actually enjoying being kissed, but when their lips parted ways from the kiss that she then smacked hin hard and said angry at him, &quot;how dare you try to kiss me!&quot; Tyler tried to say the she was the one who came at him first, but still came out nothing more then deer calls. &quot;down on all fours, now!&quot; following her orders and going to all fours with his hand on the floor that he then heard a cracking sound from his lower body, he was now permanently stuck on all fours.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s give Tyler a hand.&quot; Madame Illusia said. While the audience were clapping, she extended a hand to Tyler&#39;s balls that made His penis grew hard, and he had the urge to tell Madame Illusia to stroke it instead of playing with his man balls. &quot;these here could do better... oh. oh, my. looks You&#39;re enjoying the changes more than I expected&quot; shacking his head no to give her the answer, but your tail was telling her yes as it was swishing back and forth rapidly on all to see.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then, Shall we continue?&quot; Madame Illusia asked the crowd as They cheered for more to see. Once again, Madame Illusia began to spin the wheel as she was playfully playing with Tyler&#39;s tail that He had never been turned on in his life before now as his mind was hundreds of miles away by now. He thought his dick might burst if it didn&#39;t find release soon that The tip was already leaking precum as Tyler wanted it so badly, But Madame Illusia had his hands on the floor like a dog&#39;s. Tyler was forced to stand there with a raging boner while tyler watched the wheel spin and spin, until it then slowly stop. a wave of cheers from the crowd drew his attention away from her and to the wheel.</p>
