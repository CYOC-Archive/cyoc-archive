<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Antony was scrolling through the options one stuck out to the teen. Chameleon clothes? What on earth did that mean? Curious he clicked on the option and read up on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Make clothes that transform the wearer into a person that best matches the clothing. Interesting...&quot; There were sub-options too. Reality changes, Transformation duration, mental changes. Yeah, this could be very interesting. The ability to live a different life based on the clothes you wore, or maybe have someone else wear this. Yeah! Antony needed to try this out right away. <br />
<br />
He should start with something simple. The first thing that came to mind was a business suit jacket and the option he ended up trying first. Alright, now it was time to fine-tune the options. Since this was just a test he was not going to have any reality changes and set the duration of the transformation to as long as he was wearing the suit. Next, Brain Patterns, and how close to the subject will act as the transformation target. Antony decided to set this at 30% for this test. Finally, there were keywords to help fine-tune the transformation. Antony decided to add in the words &quot;Sexy&quot; and &quot;Hunk.&quot; He wasn&#39;t interested in becoming one of those old and tired office workers today. Once he was satisfied, Antony press the confirm button, and suddenly a business suit jacket appeared out of thin air.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa!&quot; Antony whispered in surprise, careful not to wake up his brother. Part of him wasn&#39;t expecting this to work, but the fact this appeared out of nowhere proved that this wasn&#39;t just some fancy computer. Alright, now was the moment of truth. Antony put on the suit jacket and each time he fasten a button, he felt a warm, pleasurable feeling wash over him. Once he got to the last button, all that warmth that built up inside of him suddenly was unleashed and Antony could feel his body shifting, changing.<br />
<br />
Eventually, the warmth he felt went away, he wasn&#39;t sure how long that transformation lasted, but he clearly felt different. Looking down, he saw that the clothes he was wearing before he put on the suit changed. He was now wearing some clean suit pants, polished dress shoes, and an expensive-looking watch. There was no doubt about it, the suit jacket changed him. <br />
<br />
Quickly, Antony rushed over to the mirror and he was amazed at what he saw. He was still him, maybe a little taller and muscular, but it was him as a high-powered businessman. It was clear that he was older but he couldn&#39;t really tell how much how much older he was right now. He didn&#39;t have any wrinkles, but the look in his eyes seemed to show experience. Not only that but despite being older, his skin was smoother and softer than when he was a teen. Even his hands which became calloused after taking up weightlifting were smooth, and it was clear that this new body still lifted weight given the muscles. He must have some expensive skincare routine to pull that off. Speaking of grooming, his hair wasn&#39;t left out of that department. Before Antony didn&#39;t really care too much about his hairstyle as long as it wasn&#39;t too long. But now it was gelled back and looked like it had been stylized by a top-paying hairstylist.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, Antony looked like he now oozed money. He was classy, stylish, rich, and powerful now and Antony kinda liked it. Huh, now that he thinks about it though, normally he would probably be freaking out over the fact that a computer had transformed him into a hunky businessman, but he was oddly calm about it. Were these the brain pattern adjustments? Yeah, that made sense. He was an adult now, and there was no need for childish outbursts to tarnish his image, after all. Hmmm, maybe that was enough testing for now. Antony quickly removed the business suit jacket and almost instantly he began to revert back to his teenage self.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, that was incredible! Freaky, but so incredible. What other clothes could I make.&quot; Many different ideas were flowing through his head. One thing he could do was adjust the suit to change reality. He could use a few days away from his family to live the high life. Alternatively, he could give this to his father. Maybe he could finally get that promotion he was working so hard for. Another option was to leave this at school and see what happens when a student or teacher gets their hands on this.<br />
<br />
Oh, but why should he stop with the business suit? Maybe he could do something like create gym shorts that turn you into a bodybuilder. Yeah, that could be fun! Sure Antony had no need for that but others could, like his brother. Maybe with this, Antony could finally convince his brother Alex to come to the gym with him. He could slip those to the nerds and see how they react. Would some of them catch the bodybuilding bug, get back at some bullies, or even fight amongst themselves for ownership of the shorts?<br />
<br />
Oh! Speaking of nerds, maybe he could make another pair of shorts that turn you into a bodybuilder but also drain your intelligence making you a himbo! Yeah, he could see it now. A nerd struggling to decide to keep their intelligence or sacrifice it to become a muscle hunk.<br />
<br />
The possibility seemed endless! There were so many other ideas swimming in his head, but for now, he stick with one thing for now, and after some thought, he decided on an idea.</p>
