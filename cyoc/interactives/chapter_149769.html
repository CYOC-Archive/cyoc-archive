<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Abby and Jenny were clearly getting agitated. The lust-addled couple continued to admire each other from across the stable as their natural urges overwhelmed them. They both shifted around in discomfort as their genitalia began to throb, desperate for some action. <br />
They both knew that this was all wrong; they were husband and wife, not a pair of beasts!<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the attendant looked on in amusement as the former humans succumbed to their new instincts. He was particularly amused that his sadistic boss was now nothing more than a horny mare, begging to be fucked into submission like the animal she now was.<br />
<br />
The attendant reckoned that seeing his former boss debasing herself would be deeply satisfying. However, he couldn’t forget his earlier promise. Jenny had deliberately disobeyed his orders, and he had threatened to punish her. And what use were threats if they were never acted upon?<br />
<br />
Consequently the attendant had another plan.<br />
<br />
He began by summoning a stable hand to lead Sophie away. The worker calmly removed the freshly-bred mare from Abby’s new stall, carefully making sure that the feisty stallion didn’t try to bolt out while the door was open. Luckily, the male’s eyes were firmly locked on his former husband as the chestnut coloured mare shamelessly displayed her slick vagina to the world.<br />
<br />
Sophie was then led away so that she could recover from her rigorous humping. Jenny looked back to see a satisfied smirk on the grey mare’s face as she revelled in the aftermath of her sensational equine orgasm. Jenny also caught a glimpse of Sophie’s backside. Abby’s cum had spurted out from all corners of the mare’s pussy, thoroughly coating everything between her hind legs. There was so much semen inside her that some excess spilled out with each step, leaving thick globs of the stuff clinging to her fur while less viscous fluids dribbled down her hind legs.<br />
<br />
Of course, if he was still human, Jenkins would have been disgusted by the mess between Sophie’s legs. But these were hardly normal circumstances. Jenny knew that she could share in Sophie’s bliss if she gave in to her body’s urges. She trembled as her need for sex ramped up a gear. She was beginning to get desperate as the will to reproduce overrode all other thoughts.<br />
<br />
Her heart therefore skipped a beat when she noticed that several stable hands were wrestling with Abby in an effort to get him under control. Abby had already demonstrated his virility, but this show of strength ticked another box in Jenny’s warped mind: yet another useful trait the couple could pass on to their foals…<br />
<br />
Her heartbeat accelerated again once the door of Abby’s stall opened. The couple whinnied to each other lustfully as they readied themselves for some action. <br />
<br />
However, to Jenny’s dismay, rather than being led to her stall, Abby was instead made to head further along the row of stalls. Abby whinnied out in dismay whilst fighting hard to get back at his former husband. Jenny also voiced her concerns as ear-splitting whinnies echoed throughout the stables.<br />
<br />
However, try as he might, Abby was beginning to give ground. He was already tired from his passionate lovemaking, meaning that his resistance started to dwindle. Jenny began to despair as the handsome stud seemed to give up.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately this wasn’t entirely accurate.<br />
<br />
Jenny noticed that Abby’s gaze started to wonder. His eyes were no longer fixated exclusively on her as he looked around at his fellow horses. He studied the other males and quickly determined that his main rivals were Harry and Prince. He made a mental note to keep an eye on those two, since both were incredibly muscular and well-endowed. But aside from them Abby reckoned he was more than a match for any of the other feeble stallions. He was sure they could be friends, as long as they understood who was boss.<br />
<br />
Once he had surveyed his competitors, he started to scan for potential conquests. He was sad that he had been separated from Jenny. She certainly had attractive feminine assets, not least her hot mare’s pussy. On top of this he sensed a strange connection with the chestnut mare which he couldn’t quite place, despite the small human voice in his head which desperately tried to jog his memory.<br />
<br />
Still in a trance, his eyes moved to Sophie as she merrily munched on her hay in the corner of her stall. He was certain that she would soon be the mother to his offspring, judging by the sheer volume of semen that he had pumped inside her womb. And, once she had given birth, he would be more than willing to begin the cycle anew.<br />
<br />
His dull brown eyes continued to drift until he saw Princess. She had an attractive physique, with an elegant face and wide foal-bearing hips. He would definitely like to have a go on her as well at some point in the future. But his instincts told him that she was not in the mood for sex at the moment. She seemed tired and content like Sophie, suggesting that a rival stallion had beaten him to it. Such a pity.<br />
<br />
Abby continued to scan the stables, hunting for a worthy mate. He watched in frustration as a graceful bay mare trotted out of the stables, giving a young college student his first, and last, cross-country ride. He knew he would soon return as a handsome stallion, and the female would inevitably be his first conquest. <br />
<br />
He looked around some more. His eyes settled on a few ponies which were used to give riding lessons to the smaller kids. He spied a few females amongst them but they could hardly compare to his fellow horses. He doubted whether they could handle his weight and power, or whether their foals would share his impressive physique. Ultimately he decided that they might be fun to try out if he was desperate, but at the moment he wanted a true horse beneath him; one that was worthy of his prowess. <br />
<br />
Abby was beginning to despair when he found what he was after. The next mare that caught his attention seemed promising. He sniffed curiously, instantly picking up her pheromone-laced scent. She was still in heat and yet to be mated with. She would do nicely!<br />
<br />
Abby got more and more captivated as he studied the nearby female. He started whinnying excitedly as the attendants began leading him straight towards her!<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Jenny watched in horror as Abby eagerly trotted towards the rival mare. She couldn’t believe that she had been denied that sweet release of orgasm yet again. She was also furious that her former wife had chosen this other slutty horse over her. She tried to block it all out, but she kept staring at Abby in morbid curiosity.<br />
<br />
And so Jenny watched angrily as Abby neared the beautiful mare. It turned out that it was…</p>
