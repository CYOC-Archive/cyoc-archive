<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Delilah rejoiced in her first conquest she started formulating a plan on how to get back at the entire town she couldn’t just take them all at once her will could dominate them all but her power could have her only take one at a time. She realized she needed to be intelligent and cunning take them one at time, grow in power, evolve into a greater demon. So she summoned an illusion over her physical form of a heavily endowed woman with long dark hair and lightly tanned skin wearing a black revealing leather dress. She then commanded Bug to invisible but not before he wrote a note saying he quit and was running away to live free. Delilah’s next step was to grab the ancient tome and leave the school to find a safe place to enact her plan. Many eyes both male and female, young and old followed her as she stride through the halls a sly smile on her lips as she thought what she was planning to do to them. As soon as she left the school she made her way to the biggest bank in town and waited until the head banker left. She quickly followed behind him until they reached his home where he lived alone, perfect Delilah thought. She went on to command the invisible Bug to sneak in to let her in. As soon as she entered the banker came to confront her whereupon she dropped her illusion revealing her demonic physique. “Congratulations Mr. Rupert” his name tag still hanging from his suit jacket pocket as Delilah said his name “You have the greatest pleasure of being my host on this earthly plane.” By the end of the day a new insect named Shrimp was skittering around with Bug as Delilah started making herself at home. <br />
<br />
Over the weeks that had passed since Delilah came into existence within that time she had commanded Shrimp to resign his job at the bank and transfer his assets to her, which she used to make a new identity with under the name Delilah Rose. With this new identity Delilah became the librarian at the high school through the use of illusion, charm and pure sex appeal. With her position established she started working her charm on the students and faculty, Burton and Rupert may have both fell in less than a day but their minds were weak to repress sexual tension and repressed desires, these young bloods were far stronger than a hapless librarian and an overworked banker. But progress was going well with her illusory visage and sinful skills she had to get the attraction of almost every person in the school now she would pick them off one by one. Her first target Julie Thomas was a nerdy little girl who was alway pressured by teachers and bullies to do the homework of school athletes. She was a short maybe 5’5” with a scrawny frame, stringy brunette hair, dull brown eyes with thick rim glasses and a shy nature. Delilah thought she would become an excellent ally in future plans and had set the seeds for her to bloom.<br />
<br />
Julie was leaving the library late having finished the same Math assignment five times as she was leaving the librarian Ms. Rose had called her over. Julie liked Ms. Rose, she was alway nice to her unlike other faculty members who just demeaned her and wanted her to work for the football team. Ms. Rose was beautiful, intelligent and gave Julie advice to  stand up for herself. As Julie came to the front desk she saw Ms. Rose was wearing one of her low cut blouses with a tight skirt that ended just above the knee. “You know Julie I been seeing you staying late here far more often than any other student is everything alright” Ms. Rose asked concerned “You always seems to have more work than any student I have ever seen”. “Oh it nothing to worry about, just extra credit work, got to get that college resume ready” Julie replied shyly. “I’ve seen extra credit work before you are going beyond what is required for extra credit” countered Ms. Rose “You really should stand up for yourself say no to doing those boys work” “You know about that” Julie answered quietly which Ms. Rose replied “everyone knows the teachers have the honor students do the sport teams’ homework, doesn’t that bother you” “Yeah a bit but what can I do” Julie said. “More than you can think, if the right opportunity comes” Ms. Rose charmingly retorted “How would you like to actually like to do something about it”. “Like what bring it to a news outlet and expose them” Julie offered. “I was thinking of something far more direct” as Ms. Rose said this her image shimmered until their stood a crimson muscular succubus the only clothes being a leather collar connected by chains to a set of nipple and vaginal piercings. “What are you?” A shocked Julie stated falling down staring at the red vixen that was her friend. “I am your savior the one to give you all your heart’s desires, the one to help you get pay back for all the bullying, all the teasing, all the mistreatment” Delilah tempted so charmingly “all you have to do is say that you will follow me and it will all be your”. As Julie thought of this offer she remembered all abuse she received for being the smart girl from her fellow students, her teachers and even her own mother who thought popularity was the only thing worth having. Then she remembered all she received from Ms. Rose how she treated her with respect, how she allow her to stay at the library late to finish all the extra work, how she never gave in to all the school’s temptations and threats. “Yes I’ll follow you I submit” Julie replied. Delilah gave a welcoming smile as she lifted Julie to her feet and drew her in closer “Then accept this gift my child” then slowly brought Julie’s lip to her’s and gave a deep passionate kiss transferring her will over her. As they kissed Julie started changing, her thin frame becoming more fuller forming an hourglass figure her breasts growing in size, her hips expanding in more child bearing proportions and her legs forming into strong thick limbs. As their lips withdraw from each other Julie’s face lost all signs of blemishes or defect, her eyes and hair remained relatively the same only becoming more vibrant in color and more shapely in appearance. “You are so beautiful my sweet” Delilah said as she then took a mirror from her desk to show her new charge. “Now let us get you your first servant now” Delilah said as Julie coyly smiled in agreement. They quickly made their way to Julie’s house shortly after closing the library whereupon they found Julie’s mother an once pageant queen now obese coach potato another easy slave for Delilah to convert making Julie’s new servant Roach. Over the course of the next couple of weeks Delilah would convert a number of students similar to how she gained Julie then converting their parents into more insect-like servants which she kept in the basement of the mansion giving a few to her most fervent followers. As she gain the submission of many servants Delilah started changing at a very gradual way but still noticeable. Her muscular features were beginning to fade to a more refined figure the muscles never fully disappeared but gained a more feminine appearance, she grew a second set of downward curved horns with the first growing longer and more elaborate, her wing also grew in size to a level where they could actually hold her in flight, fiery runes began engraving themselves across Delilah’s body appearing on the length of her arms, legs, back and sides and the final change a line of short sharp spines beginning at the base of the skull following the spine then ending at the tip of the tail. At this point Delilah had gone beyond being a simple succubus and had attain the level of middling demon now able to gain the submission of multiple people at once now and with a small army of demonically empowered servants she now must decide what her next move must be.</p>
