<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Frederick headed for the door, so did Keith.<br />
<br />
“Where are you going?”  Frederick asked.<br />
<br />
“Out,” Keith replied.  “I always take my fifteen minute breaks outside, weather permitting.”<br />
<br />
Frederick shrugged and accepted the answer.  He headed toward his car, then stopped.  No one else was around. No harm in a quick picture, right?  Turning around he saw Keith on a shaded bench near the door, a book in his hands.  The young man was tall and thin, his skin pale, and his hair dark red.<br />
<br />
Keith was always an odd young man; the orders he loaded were always perfectly sorted, but his social skills were… lacking, to say the least.   Frederick guessed he was probably autistic.  While waiting for the truck to load, Frederick usually saw one fantasy novel or another near Keith’s paperwork, usually with a dragon on the cover.  It’d be funny and fitting to try the dragon girl filter on him.<br />
<br />
Making sure Keith wasn’t watching, he took a quick picture, and dragged the dragon girl icon down to the photo.<br />
<br />
Frederick blinked in surprised when he saw that, rather than just poorly pasting pictures of horns and a tail in the general area of Keith’s head and back, the photo seemed give Keith the appearance of a full-fledged woman, with longer hair, a smoother, softer face, lacking the stubble he’d missed shaving, and natural-looking womanly hips and chest, all on top of the draconic features that seemed to naturally grow from her.  Frederick wasn’t normally one to be impressed by AI generated art, but this thing seemed near flawless.<br />
<br />
<I>Good shot!</I>  Cheered the text box.  <i>Now, it’s time to transform!  Just hit the button, and your first partner will be ready to go!</I><br />
<br />
Curious what the feature would do, Frederick pressed the button.<br />
<br />
He nearly jumped back as a bolt of red light flew out of the phone and hit Keith, who jolted upright, and began panting.<br />
<br />
“Wh-what’s going on?”  He stammered, his voice cracking slightly.<br />
<br />
Frederick shook his head and ran over to Keith.  “Are you alright?  I don’t know what happened, I was just fiddling with my phone and then-”<br />
<br />
“I-I feel warm…”  Keith panted, his voice getting higher.  “No, I feel HOT!  I’m burning up!”  <br />
<br />
He clutched at his stomach, panting faster and leaning over.  Frederick noticed three lumps forming under Keith’s clothes, one on each shoulder, and a third near the base of his spine. <br />
<br />
‘Oh no.’  Frederick’s eyes widened and he fumbled for his phone.  ‘It&#39;s actually changing him!  How do I stop it?’<br />
<br />
With each breath in, Keith’s hips and thighs seemed to grow a little wider, as did a pair of growths on his chest.  With each breath out, Keith’s waist became a little narrower, his Adam&#39;s apple pulled back just a little more.  He shuddered and moaned, before reaching up to the two lumps, which swelled to fill his hands, and more, easily surpassing a D cup. <br />
<br />
“A-are these-” He gasped sharply as he squeezed them. “B-breasts?  Wh-what’s going on?”  He looked toward Frederick.  “What are you doing on your phone?  Get some help!”<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to do!”  Frederick pressed anything that looked like a button or icon, swiped every which way, searching for some way to stop the process, but the screen only displayed the outline of a human, slowly being filled with magical energy, with a rotating hourglass below it.  Not even the button to restart the phone did anything <br />
<br />
Keith yelped and pulled his hands away from his chest.  Looking down at them, he and Frederick saw his nails gone, in their place, thick, sharpened, black claws forced their way through his fingertips.  <br />
<br />
“Claws?”  Keith shouted.  “How am I growing claws?”<br />
<br />
Frederick stammered.  He knew the answer, but wasn’t sure how to say it.  <br />
<br />
Or at least, not in a way that didn&#39;t risk those claws being turned at him.<br />
<br />
From the base of each claw, red scales began to grow from Keith’s skin, spreading down his hands in a careful, interlocking pattern, forming a firm armor that spread down until it reached his elbow.  His upper-arms lost much of their body hair, while picking up a subtle hint of toned muscle beneath the surface.<br />
<br />
“Wait, scales too?”  Keith panted.  “What&#39;s happening to me?  Am I turning into some kind of monster?  It burns, but it feels so…”<br />
<br />
He moaned, his shoes tearing as his feet suddenly outgrew his shoes, his toes growing claws just as fingers had, before splaying out and growing longer as well.  Keith wobbled and fell back on the bench, losing his balance on unfamiliar feet.  Red scales grew from his toes, right where the claws had emerged.  More and more appeared, crawling over his feet and toward his legs.  He lifted a leg, and twitched his clawed toes then turned back to Frederick.  <br />
<br />
“A-are you getting anything on your phone?  Just go back inside for help!”<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t have a key card anymore, remember?”  Frederick replied, trying not to let himself get distracted by Keith’s leg getting slimmer as scales crept up its surface, gaining a subtle feminine curve, with a hint of muscle building below. Were it not attached to Keith,  Frederick would probably have found it hot, but as it was, it just made him feel uncomfortable on top of the guilt of having done this.<br />
<br />
He shook his head.   He needed to focus.  Surely there was some way to cancel this, right? <br />
<br />
Keith moaned, his voice unmistakably feminine. “Ugh, right, then take mine!”<br />
<br />
He reached for his pocket, only for the claws to get stuck in the fabric, and create a huge cut in the side of his shorts, providing a side-view of Keith’s hips.  The tear only seemed to get longer as Keith’s hips swelled to child-bearing proportions, with his butt swelling to match.<br />
<br />
“I, ah-ahh!  I feel like I’m gonna-”  His face flushed red, and he let out another long moan, his whole body shivering, as the bulge in the front of his pants began to slowly pull back.  Her hands dove toward her shorts, looking ready to rip off what was left of them, before her eyes caught Frederick’s, and she stopped.<br />
<br />
“I-it’s too much, I can’t…”<br />
<br />
Dots of scales, easily confused for freckles at a distance, grew on Keith’s cheeks, getting thicker around her ears, as they fanned out into fin-like shapes.  She clenched her teeth, which grew steadily sharper, as four bones grew out from the back of her head, two on each side, all pressing out into conical horns.  Her jawline softened, and her face became a little rounder, while her red hair grew far longer, draping down past her shoulders.<br />
<br />
She let out a high-pitched gasp, as her tail suddenly shot out through her pants, growing several feet long, covered in red scales, with sawblade-like ridges running over the top.  It seemed this was the last blow her shorts could take, before they finally gave up, the tatters clinging to the remaining waistband doing little to hide her moist slit.  She scrambled to cover up, backing away.<br />
<br />
“I’m s-sorry,” Frederick stammered, filled with guilt, mixed with a base desire that only increased that guilt.  While it had been odd seeing part of Keith’s body become increasingly feminine, now that she had become wholly female, (and half-naked) Frederick couldn’t help but find her figure arousing, even in spite of the horns, scales, and claws.  If anything, the accents somehow made her even more appealing.  “I think I…”<br />
<br />
Before she could continue, Keith doubled over as the back of her shirt was shredded,  releasing two long, spindly limbs with equally long digits, covered in red scales.  A leathery membrane filled the space between each lengthy digit, as well as between her new “arms” and back, becoming a set of large, powerful wings.  <br />
<br />
Keith turned her head up, and with one more scream, unleashed a jet of flame into the air, before stumbling back to the bench, exhausted.  The collar of her shirt remained undamaged, leading to the front of it draping loosely over her teardrop-shaped breasts like a short apron.<br />
<br />
Frederick blinked.  He’d been taller than Keith before, but when she’d reared up to full height a moment ago, she was nearly 6’6”.<br />
<br />
Keith panted, trying to cover up with her arms, before looking back, and fully taking in her wings.  <br />
<br />
Did she smile for a second?  No, Frederick had to have been imagining that.<br />
<br />
She moved her wings in front of her, seemingly to cover up, but she also stared at them intently, feeling over both them and her tail with her hands.<br />
<br />
“Keith, I…”<br />
<br />
Frederick’s cell phone let out a ping.<br />
<br />
<I>Great Work!  Now it’s time for the Capture Cube!”</I><br />
<br />
A small, blue, crystalline cube flung itself from Frederick’s phone, hovering over Keith and enveloping her in a blue light.   She barely had time to look up in shock before her body glowed brightly, then seemed to rise up into the cube and vanish from sight.  The cube then flew back into the phone, leaving Frederick alone as he tried to process what just happened.<br />

<br />
---<br />
<br />
Keith shook herself awake, taking in the smell of sulfur.  As she came to, she realized she was in a massive cave, sitting atop a pile of gold coins, with a cliffside view of a large lava lake.  The steady, rhythmic sound of magma crashing down a “waterfall” nearby created an oddly relaxing ambient noise.  Coins clinked underneath her as she slowly got up.<br />
<br />
“Where am-”  She stopped, surprised at the sound of her own voice.<br />
<br />
“It wasn’t a dream…”  she whispered.<br />
<br />
She looked down at one of the more reflective treasures in the pile.  Sure enough, a woman’s face, with horns, scales, sharp teeth, and a forked tongue, looked back.  She looked down, confirming not only the rest of the changes, but that her clothes had been replaced by a long green dress.  It had holes for her new limbs, but did little to cover her legs, most of it trailing down between them.  It also gave a clear view of her far more defined abs, and the neckline gave a cleave view of her cleavage.<br />
<br />
Still shaking off the beary, sleepy feeling, Keith didn’t know how to feel about this.  On one hand, she’d fantasized about being a dragon, since her childhood.  Her new wings, horns, and tail were all perfection, as far as she was concerned.   On the other hand, she hadn’t particularly ever fantasized about being a woman.  She would have preferred to lean more on the dragon side, if she had to go through a change like this, to be completely covered in scales, at a bare minimum, with an imposing snout...  Still, it wasn’t like she DISLIKED the idea of being a woman, if it also meant being a dragon.<br />
<br />
Then, it started to hit her that, whether she liked it or not, she couldn’t exactly fit in anywhere like this.  There was no way her employers or family would recognize her.  Assuming she could even figure out a way back home from wherever this was at all.  No matter how much this half-fulfilled her fantasies, it did little to ease her being unrecognizable from her old self, and having no idea why.  She anxiously glanced around, trying to figure out what direction she should fly in.  <br />
<br />
Could she fly?  It shouldn’t be physically possible with wings this size, but she didn’t think it was possible to suddenly become a dragon woman either…<br />
<br />
Before she could worry any more, she noticed a spiral of stone rising up out of the lava lake,slowly but steadily spinning.  Its slow, subtle movement spun the lava with it, and she found the interlocking red and brown spirals difficult to look away from.<br />
<br />
Its was relaxing.  <br />
<br />
Soothing.<br />
<br />
It made it easy to not focus.  OR maybe it took all her focus into itself.<br />
<br />
She calmly sat on the edge of the cliff, continuing to stare,  as the whispers started.<br />
<br />
<I>Relax.  Let go.<br />
<br />
Feel the peace and warmth flowing through you.</i><br />
<br />
Keith could definitely feel the warmth flowing in and around her.  Somehow, now, it didn’t bother her, though.  If anything, it felt soothing.  Like a hot shower after a cold day shoveling snow.<br />
<br />
<i>You are a girl.  You are a dragon.  You embrace your inner Dragon girl.  You don’t need to be human.  You love your new form.  You are better this way.  You are happy this way.</I><br />
<br />
Keith, or rather, Kerri, (a much more fitting name for her new form) nodded.  She’d always wanted to be a dragon.  She didn’t mind the idea of being a girl.  She was better this way.  She would find a way to make this work.  It’s not like she needed to be human.  <br />
<br />
<I>Dragon Girls are proud.  Dragon Girls are Loyal.  Dragon girls have strong codes of honor.  Dragon girls are beautiful.  Dragon girls are strong.  Dragon girls are confident.</I><br />
<br />
Kerri agreed.  She was proud of her new form, and, whatever any other dragon-girls might be like, she considered herself loyal.  She wanted to have a strong code of honor too.<br />
<br />
She found herself standing up straighter, pushing her chest out.  She had nothing to hide.  She was beautiful, as all dragons were.  She was stronger, tougher than she ever dreamed of being as a human.  Why should she fear what other people thought of her?  What could they do?<br />
<br />
<I>Dragon girls serve their Masters.  Your Master is the one that changed you.  Your Master is Frederick Swanson.</I><br />
<br />
Kerri felt it was only natural.  She greatly enjoyed the new gift that was her body.  It was only fitting she help the one that granted it to her in any way he wanted.  She would serve and obey him.<br />
<br />
<I>Obeying Master feels good.  Obeying Master feels natural.  The more you obey, the better you feel, and the better you feel, the more you obey.  </I><br />
<br />
The fire within Kerri burned fiercer as she subconsciously obeyed the orders.  She craved to feel this more and more.<br />
<br />
<I>Dragon girls love treasure.  Your Master is your greatest treasure.  You treat him like a precious gem.  You protect him from all that would harm him.  Your strength is for his protection.</i><br />
<br />
She grinned at the thought of her Master at the top of her treasure pile, his charming face smiling at her.<br />
<br />
She then sternly put her hands to her hips as the thought of Master coming to harm entered her mind.  She grit her teeth, tiny flames slipping between them.  Anyone who thought to hurt her Master would suffer!  Suffer or…<br />
<br />
<I>You will aid your Master in his quest to research all types of Monster Girls.  You will help him find humans who need to embrace their inner monster, and bring unruly girls back in line.</I><br />
<br />
She stood tall, filled with a sense of purpose..  With how much she enjoyed her change, and her Master, how could she NOT want to spread this joy with other humans?  Sure, not every human deserved something like this, but that would be Master’s choice.  She felt almost giddy, but stopped herself, wanting to retain her appearance of draconic pride, even if nobody was around to see her at the moment.<br />
<br />
A small part of her still worried about what her friends and family thought, but she let those thoughts go.  Surely her wonderful Master would help her deal with that when the time came, if he was kind enough to give her this new body and home.  She smiled to herself as the spiral slipped back beneath the lava waves.</p>
