<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;For Moon Lake having such a late Indian Summer, the water&#39;s colder than I thought it would be,&quot; said Nate Anderson, as he stepped into the town&#39;s namesake.<br />
&quot;As weres, it shouldn&#39;t bother us too much,&quot; whispered his boyfriend Alex Ramsey, as he waded in next to his partner.<br />
After making their way back to the tent the two High School Juniors were sharing for the weekend, it took longer than was actually necessary for them to change into their swim trunks and make their way to the shore line because...<br />
Well... if you were in a secluded spot with your lover and saw that person naked, what would be the first thing on your mind?<br />
<br />
However, both knew they couldn&#39;t go all out and risk losing control and exposing their fursonas in public, despite being in a designated were section of the campground, but there was a lot of teasing and fondling, along with many promises of what would be on the agenda after sundown when they could let their hair down figuratively and expose their inner werewolves.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can swim, right?&quot; asked Alex, as he started out until his feet barely touched the lake bed beneath him.<br />
&quot;I never counted them all for myself, but Minnesota IS the Land of 10,000 Lakes,&quot; Nate reminded him as he easily swam past Alex. &quot;But none of them have you,&quot; he added, coming back to kiss Alex&#39;s neck and wrapping his arms around his lover.<br />
&quot;Down boy,&quot; said Alex teasingly. &quot;Not till after sundown. Remember?&quot;<br />
&quot;What if I don&#39;t want to wait?&quot; Nate whispered in Alex&#39;s ear, as he started running his hands across his boyfriend&#39;s chest.<br />
&quot;Then you&#39;ll leave me no choice but to do this,&quot; replied Alex, as Nate suddenly found himself being gripped by one arm and flipped over Ramsey&#39;s shoulder as Alex braced his feet against the muddy lake bottom.<br />
Nate went over Alex and landed in the water in front of his boyfriend with a splash.<br />
<br />
When Nate surfaced, Alex said, &quot;As much as I want you too stud, hopefully that will cool you off now.&quot;<br />
&quot;So, that&#39;s the way you want it, huh?&quot; teased Nate, as he playfully flung some water at Alex.<br />
In his best comedic voice, Alex said, &quot;Of course you realize, this means war,&quot; as he started splashing Nate in return.<br />
Soon the two teenagers were playfully splashing each other and having fun, with both thinking about how great it would be to kiss and make up afterward.<br />
Not that it was any kind of a real disagreement to begin with, but still...<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
&quot;I think we wore the poor dears out,&quot; said Dawn Hale to Martha Anderson, while looking at their sleeping husbands.<br />
The ladies had enjoyed a very long session of oral sex while their respective mates continued pleasuring their rears via anal sex.<br />
When the werevixen and the werecat felt their husbands&#39; werefox top knots slip out their asses, the ladies continued licking the juicy cream from each other until Dawn heard Douglas start to snore.<br />
With that, they sat up and observed the current situation.<br />
&quot;Usually we fall asleep in each other&#39;s arms, but this has been a rather hot afternoon,&quot; Martha said in a sultry voice to Dawn, even as she started licking the leftover werevixen honey from her paws.<br />
&quot;What say we go downstairs for a quick bite, and I&#39;ll help you fix dinner for these hardworking men,&quot; suggested Dawn, as she looked at the nightstand clock and saw it was approaching five.<br />
&quot;Like this?&quot; asked Martha, indicating their fursonas.<br />
&quot;As long as your curtains are closed and we don&#39;t go outside before dark, we&#39;re not breaking any laws,&quot; answered Dawn, as she got up to use the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Soon both women were having sandwiches and bottled water at the kitchen table.<br />
Martha commented on how different it felt sitting down on her werecat behind, her tail swishing outside the wooden chair.<br />
&quot;You mean to tell me that you and William haven&#39;t done much furry outside of sex?&quot; asked Dawn in disbelief.<br />
&quot;So far? Not really,&quot; admitted Martha. &quot;We&#39;ve been weres just a little over a month now. William because of that damn rogue, and me because I knew I&#39;d never be able to be with him again if I didn&#39;t become a were too; while some dear friends of mine convinced me it was time to finally acknowledge and embrace my bi side,&quot; she added, thinking about Samantha and Frances Twist next door.<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m glad they did. You taste great,&quot; replied Dawn, before kissing Martha.<br />
&quot;You do too,&quot; agreed Martha, after their lips parted.<br />
&quot;But there&#39;s all kind of things you can do furry besides sex,&quot; added Dawn. &quot;It&#39;s just so natural to be out and about in your fursona, even if you&#39;re just sitting in front of the TV after a long day at work. There&#39;s long romantic walks, prowling or hunting through the woods if you&#39;re into that kind of thing.&quot;<br />
&quot;I take it you&#39;re not?&quot;<br />
&quot;Douglas likes the thrill of the chase at times, but my prey always has two legs,&quot; answered Dawn, licking her foxy muzzle as she smiled.<br />
&quot;So you two...&quot; began Martha, wondering how to phrase the question.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve known I was bi since my first transformation. To celebrate that glorious night, I had both a boy and a girl with me and I can guarantee you a terrific time was had by all. I turned Douglas and we formed a mutual life/mate bond on the spot. Getting married just made it official. I don&#39;t mind him being straight and he doesn&#39;t mind me being bi as long as he gets to share my women with him when they&#39;re willing or I share his female partners if they want to play with me too. But at the end of every night we&#39;re always together and as much in love with each other now as the day we first met.&quot;<br />
&quot;I see. One of the reasons we moved to Moon Lake, not knowing in advance about weres, is because William had a... roving eye and penis for the ladies. Moving here was a fresh start for us, in more ways than one,&quot; said Martha, holding out her paw briefly.<br />
<i>So that&#39;s why you&#39;re afraid to switch partners,</i> realized Dawn. &quot;Well, if it&#39;s one thing I can tell you about werefoxes, they&#39;re faithful until death. Just like our counterpart in nature, we do mate for life, and I dread the day one of us passes before the other. But our love is strong and very secure, which is why we have such a good open marriage. Besides, I&#39;m too horny to ever stop completely playing,&quot; she added, before reaching over and giving Martha another kiss while cupping the werecat&#39;s breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. I can smell your arousal,&quot; noted Martha, as her whiskers twitched in anticipation of future pleasures. &quot;Sometime, I would love to have a session with just you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Just name the time and place,&quot; replied Dawn with a huge smile.<br />
&quot;I definitely will,&quot; promised Martha. <i>Maybe Samantha and Frances would like to join in too.</i> &quot;In the meantime, don&#39;t you think we should start dinner?&quot; she asked, looking at the kitchen wall clock and seeing it was now well after five.<br />
&quot;Yeah. We probably should,&quot; agreed Dawn, as she rose from the table with Martha. &quot;But what about dessert?&quot; she asked, rubbing her furry body against the werecat.<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll see,&quot; said Martha with a smile, already looking forward to more time licking Dawn&#39;s werevixen cunt while William fucked her more.<br />
<i>And maybe, if I play my cards right, that handsome werefox of yours will be pounding my pussy before the night is over,</i> thought Dawn, while asking her partner what she wanted to fix for dinner.</p>
