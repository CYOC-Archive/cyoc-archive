<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The kiss was passionate Eric loved every moment of being close to his true love. Julie had done so much for him and even if he couldn&#39;t truly define what love was academically, he certain that he loved her and that was all that mattered. With his arms around her, he kissed her passionately, and neither young weremer felt reason to stop.  They moved slowly toward the stairs, with Julie doing so backwards, and with their lips locked and their tongues wrestling with each other to establish dominance. The only thing that stopped them was when they reached the stairs, and the move ended up sending Julie back onto her butt where she was seated on a step with Eric managing to catch himself above her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps the steps aren&#39;t the place for this,&quot; Julie gave a small smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Eric commented as he felt his penis beginning to stir in his pants.<br />
<br />
Both of them could feel their own mutual attraction growing. In a way it was beautiful and for both of them it reflected their desire to be together and to make the other happy. For Eric, it was about becoming part of Moon Lake and enjoying the happiness that he felt when he was with Julie. For Julie it was about being with her one true love and the happiness that came from it. She&#39;d never given much thought into a were&#39;s libido being an issue until she met Eric. Saw the light in him that showed her that he was the love of her life, the man that she wanted to be with, the man she would have children with when they grew up. And while they both made each other happy, the issue of libido was not something that was necessarily wrong, as both of them had no intention of letting their own desires get in the way of what they needed to do... But, Eric felt his erection growing and Julie felt herself growing wet as they stared into each other&#39;s blue eyes. They loved each other and desired each other, and they would need to address the issues rising from that.<br />
<br />
Eric stood up helped Julie to her feet and the two continued on up the stairs with the planned action being rather obvious. Julie could feel her nipples pushing hard against the cups of her bra and looking over her shoulder, she could see the sizable bulge Eric&#39;s penis was putting in his pants. Granted both of them were in the early stages of were puberty, Julie from birth and natural development and Eric by joining were society, but Julie also knew that as weres they were bigger than normals at the same point of development, and they would get bigger as they continued to mature. The sight of  that bulge in her one true love&#39;s pants was enough to keep her wet and to run one hand down between her own legs, if only to keep some things stimulated until they could get to Eric&#39;s bedroom.<br />
<br />
Eric took the lead once they got to the top of the steps and entered the second floor hallway. It ran on a north/south axis and started at the top of the stairs down to the other end of the hallway with a modest square window with navy blue drapes. That window let in natural sunlight which framed Eric as he walked to the first door on the eastern side of the hallway, and Julie couldn&#39;t help but smile at that. He looked good with sunlight coming in behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is my room...&quot; Eric began as he gestured to the door.<br />
<br />
Eric didn&#39;t get the time to finish, as Julie initiated another passionate kiss and pulled Eric into the room. The two ultimately fell sideways onto the bed, with their backpacks falling to the floor next to the bed as they did so. They simply looked into each other&#39;s eyes and smiled as the love and devotion they both had flowed freely. It might be some time before they have their own children or even just to get married, but that was still the future Julie wanted very much, to be Mrs. Julie Anderson and joined in the eyes of the law.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re so beautiful,&quot; Eric said to her and kissed her cheek, though his kisses moved down her neck and as his hands found her shirt, &quot;thank you for finding me...&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie gave a moan and raised her arms so as to give Eric some aid in getting her shirt off and then came close to him. As they met, both Eric and Julie moved to take each other&#39;s pants off<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for being so kind... so warm... so loving... so smart,&quot; Julie began running down the list of things she liked about Eric. &quot;It&#39;s provided me with a lot to love.&quot;<br />
<br />
By this point the two of them had managed to get the other&#39;s pants and underwear down that Eric&#39;s penis was given the freedom to stand at full attention and Julie&#39;s wet vagina was exposed as well. A few flailing kicks of their legs then sent the articles of clothing to the floor and they smiled to each other again.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s not counting how attractive you truly are,&quot; Julie said to him as she helped him get his shirt off and ran her hands along his chest. True, Eric wasn&#39;t as bulky as his brother, Alex, or Ben, as that sort of thing could be an impediment while swimming in terms of responding to potential predators coming from not only behind but also from below or above as well, but he was still well toned and had become a very handsome merman, but to Julie, that had always been there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or how attractive I became,&quot; Eric hugged her and came in, and could soon feel his member starting to ease its way into her. Julie gave a happy moan and the two rolled on the bed toward the wall that it was pushed against. It ended up with Julie on top and she effectively sheathed her one true love&#39;s penis inside her vagina. While Eric moved to unclasp her bra, the two began to thrust their hips forward and began to establish their rhythm.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was always there, Eric,&quot; Julie smiled to him, &quot;that was always you and you didn&#39;t need to become a were to change my love for you... That was simply more of a biological requirement because of my being a were. If we cooooooouuuuuuuuuuullld...&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie had wanted to say &quot;could,&quot; but soon felt her boyfriend&#39;s penis grow larger as he thrust into her. She looked to him and noticed his beautiful blue green scales were forming on his legs. Further down, Eric&#39;s toes began to lengthen with scaled webbing forming between each toe, effectively taking on a very flipper like shape. Eric&#39;s assumption of Stage 2 had only served to increase the pleasure Julie felt, even as her bra clasps were undone and her B cup breasts bounced free. It took her a moment to get used to it and began to take on her Stage 2 form as well with her breasts swelling slightly larger and orange/gold (same coloration as a goldfish) covered her legs as well. She could also feel her own toes lengthen to form the more flipper-like feet of her Stage 2 form as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;If we could manage this without you becoming a were,&quot; Julie managed as she felt Eric begin to massage her breasts as they continued to thrust their hips a pattern insure the most pleasure could be gotten by both of them, and Julie had already cum once when Eric began to transform, &quot;I would accept that. Because what&#39;s makes you you and what really attracted me to you...was WHO you are. Not how you look. If looks was all our true love senses needed, no weremer would ever marry... as just about EVERY were species fits the ideal body types that humans find attractive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Still... I was more than okay with becoming a were,&quot; Eric answered her as he felt his penis begin to twitch. Her vagina was squeezing it firmly, as if to milk him of all the sperm he could produce, and Eric got the sense that with the vigor they were both giving off in their  efforts to mate, it wouldn&#39;t be long before he reached his own climax. &quot;Becoming your merman. I love you, Julie Stovall... I love you with all of my heart.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you, too,&quot; Julie answered as they both could feel their bodies building toward an orgasm. &quot;With all my heart.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then the goal the two had been pushing toward came. Julie felt Eric&#39;s penis twitch and twitch until it she could feel it erupting within her and caused her vagina to clinch in an orgasm of her own, making her whole body quiver from the pleasure her one true love provided. It felt good and Julie loved the sensation, but was for the moment thankful that she had taken her weremer birth control pill for the day. It wasn&#39;t that she didn&#39;t want to have Eric&#39;s children, it&#39;s that both of them had agreed that right now was too early for them to be having children. The only thing they had for the moment was to simply bond together and make each other happy, which they had done. Both Eric and Julie breathed heavily and held each other as they recovered before turning to getting their homework done.</p>
