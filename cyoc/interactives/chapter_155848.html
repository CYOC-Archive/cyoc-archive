<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rodger and Bobby stepped through the front door.<br />
<br />
Um sir we mainly cater to women here.<br />
<br />
I know but I have heard great things about your work and would love to give my boyfriend the works at your wonderful spa.<br />
<br />
Well ok. Now we have an opening. What would you like to do. She pulls out what looks like a menu.<br />
<br />
You just sit down honey I want this to be a surprise for you. It took some time because Bobby or Bob as he liked to be known as finally sat down. He was a head strong dominant sort and Rodger was going to change all of that.<br />
<br />
As the clerk and Roger talked he would point out this and that and look over at Bobby and let out a little laugh. There were some gestures he would make and the clerk would look at Bobby and say almost inaudibly to Bobby, I think we can manage that.<br />
<br />
The clerk called for one of the techs and she took Bobby to the sauna first. We are going to open up your pores and release all that old toxins running through you. As Bobby sat in the sauna he could feel his brain emptying. He felt as though it was a relaxation but at his brain drained more and more his IQ lowered more and more. He had been in there longer than any other person managed. He had a lot to expel in the sauna.<br />
<br />
As the time wore on eventually another tech came in and had to tell him to get up and come with him. He was truly being a very obedient submissive boy at this point.<br />
<br />
The next thing they did was give him a mud bath. He sat there in the mud as the tech rubbed some of the mud on his clean shaven face. Sitting there more relaxed than he had ever been he went to sleep. Snoring like a buzz-saw the techs eventually woke him up having soaked in the mud for much longer than they had planned. They had two people help him out of the mud bath caked in mud taking him to a shower to shower him off.<br />
<br />
As the mud washed off there stood a big bear of a man. His face had rounded out, not that it was that noticeable because his new double chins were hidden by a new beard that he had never sported in his life. His chest now showed some, well I was going to say pecs but they are more than pecs, they are man boobs and they rested on a barrel shaped belly. It hid his not diminutive cock but even at the size of his cock he couldn&#39;t see past his belly to see his big cock.<br />
<br />
Now they took him to the massage table. Laying down on his stomach there came in a big man finally that took out his oils and began applying them to Bobby&#39;s back, legs, crack and even to Bobby&#39;s cock and balls. As he did there grew some tattoos all over the big bear. A set of wings on his back. A rainbow flag that took up most of his left arm and a bear flag that took most of his right arm in reference to him being a submissive bear. The oil made his body soft and supple enough so that the masseuse could slip his arm all the way up to the elbow into Bobby&#39;s ass. As he was stretching Bobby&#39;s ass, which had never been used before in his life, Bobby had been a total top, the masseuse also worked on Bobby&#39;s penis, scrunching it down smaller and smaller as he worked it. Finally he locked it in a cage making his cock only able to harden to a micro penis no longer than an inch long. He did stretch out Bobby&#39;s balls making them the size of grapefruits since Rodger was not going to give him the chance to cum easily.<br />
<br />
As Bobby rose from the table he stood there like a drone. A collar was hooked around his neck with a chain that he was led out, naked into the waiting room. There Rodger paid the bill took Bobby and left with his submissive bear that was going to be a nice money maker for Rodger.</p>
