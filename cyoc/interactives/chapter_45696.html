<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike Carson was a man in his late 30's.  Although he'd put on a little weight (and was losing some hair), he'd aged fairly well. <br />
<br />
Mike was a salesman at an electronics store, as well as a single parent.  Even though his wife had left him years ago, his son had eventually chosen to stay with his father.<br />
<br />
Tyler had just turned 17, and every time Mike looked at his son, he was reminded of his past; when Mike was 19, he'd been the lead guitarist for a band called Grey Skies.  They'd gotten lucky, and signed a deal with a record label.  He'd met Paige at a party, and they quickly got married; he was 20, and she was 18.<br />
<br />
Eventually things started going downhill.  The lead singer got a big ego and threatened to leave to form his own solo career, the drummer overdosed on heroin, and one night after a party, he found himself in bed with a seventeen year old groupie.<br />
<br />
When he told Paige about it, however, she told him that was it, and left him, taking Tyler.<br />
<br />
At first he tried to hook up with other bands, but when things didn't work out, he decided to clean up his act.  He quit the band scene, hung up his guitar, and went back to school.<br />
<br />
With a steady job and a good home, he first was awarded partial custody, and eventually, when Tyler was 11, he chose to live with his dad.<br />
<br />
Paige kept moving around, and by this time, she hadn't contacted her son in almost a year.<br />
<br />
Mike was between girlfriends at the moment; his last relationship had ended badly.  Colleen had wanted more time from him, but his son was more important, and she finally had had enough.<br />
<br />
Maybe he should hold off until Tyler was in college, he told himself.<br />
<br />
Then one night Tyler brought home a girl.  And everything changed.<br />
<br />
Damia Valentine's parents were artists, and they'd encouraged her to express herself.  She had short black hair with long bangs dyed pink, wore too much makeup, and had the strangest fashion sense Mike had ever seen; that first night, she'd come in wearing a red skirt, a black Metallica t-shirt from their 'Ride the Lightning' tour, a pair of pink sneakers, mis-matched socks (one white and one black), at least a dozen bangles on her right wrist, and a pair of black, fingerless gloves.<br />
<br />
She was a very petite girl, with small breasts (Mike was uncomfortable to notice the girl didn't wear a bra).  She seemed no more than a child when compared to Mike and his son (Mike was 6' 1&quot;, and Tyler was an inch taller).<br />
<br />
When the topic came up, she grinned and declared herself to be 4' 10 (and a half) inches tall, and proud of it.<br />
<br />
It was obvious the two kids had somehow hit it off, so Mike ignored the warning signs (like the fact that the punkette was only 15) and expressed his approval.<br />
<br />
As the weeks went by, Damia became a fixture around the house, even spending the night.  Mike had talked to her parents, and they seemed perfectly happy with the arrangement.<br />
<br />
One night, he woke up to hear some odd noises.  Walking down the hall, he heard moans of pleasure from his son's room.<br />
<br />
Unsure of what to do, he went downstairs to watch television.<br />
<br />
About half an hour later, he was shocked when Damia came into the living room wearing nothing but her panties and one of Tyler's shirts.  <br />
<br />
She was grinning like the cat that got the canary, and perched on the loveseat.  &quot;Sorry if I woke you, Mr. C.  I can be a little loud.&quot;<br />
<br />
She had the decency to blush, which made her seem very cute and younger than her years.<br />
<br />
Mike coughed.  &quot;Christ...what are your parents going to say?&quot;<br />
<br />
She smiled at him.  &quot;They know.  Dad wasn't too keen on it, but I told him we were going to use protection, and I'm on the pill.  We made an agreement after the last time....my first time, that I'd tell them before I planned on having sex.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh...I wish I'd been included.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her eyes got wide.  &quot;Oh wow, he didn't...I'm so sorry!  Do you want me to wake him up?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike sighed.  &quot;He's asleep already?&quot;<br />
<br />
Again the cute blush.  &quot;I think I kind of wore him out.  I prolly get it from Mom, Dad says she's insatiable.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike was starting to feel very uncomfortable being near this sex kitten.  &quot;Then let him sleep.  I guess I should count my blessings that his girlfriend is so mature.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her grin somehow got even wider.  &quot;You really think I'm mature?  Thanks Mr. C., that means a lot.  I better get back to him now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddendly she bounded off the chair and onto the couch, just long enough to give Mike a kiss on the cheek.  &quot;You're the best, Mr. C..  G'night!&quot;<br />
<br />
And she left, giving Mike a very good view of her legs (she had very nice legs for a girl her size) as she went...as well as the immediate need to have a cold shower.</p>
