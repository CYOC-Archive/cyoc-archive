<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The henchmen resented his position. He ran off into the woods in the hopes of making it out of Moon Lake, but had gotten somewhat lost and found himself merely crossing one of the areas between the spokes that made up Moon Lake and coming up on a school besides. That&#39;d mean tighter security and he could hear the thumping of boots hitting the ground behind him. The ground was soft, but he could hear the boots hitting the ground none the less. He knew he wouldn&#39;t have time to steal a car, as his pursuers wouldn&#39;t let him hot wire it and it was unlikely that someone would leave their keys in the car... and his pursuers would give him time to check for it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn,&quot; the henchman cursed again as the sound of boots got closer and the sound of sirens also got closer.<br />
<br />
He was running out of options and rushed across the stream. He had to get across the stream, go past the school, and try to get to the next set of woods on the other side. The cops didn&#39;t know he&#39;d used up all his bullets that he had on hand and that he couldn&#39;t get to the car for more, but that didn&#39;t mean he was in a good position. The creek was deep enough that the water rose up over his shoes as he splashed through it and it was another thing he didn&#39;t like, but he still had to get away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop! Get on the ground!&quot; a voice shouted from behind the second agent.<br />
<br />
He kept running and looked back to see both officers at a full sprint and guns drawn leap into the air and hurdle the creek like it was nothing and keep running. If he weren&#39;t running for his freedom, he would have been amazed by that. The stream wasn&#39;t super wide, but it was just wide enough that unless you were an Olympic class athlete, you weren&#39;t going make the leap those two officers made. Contrary to popular stereotypes, most police officers were actually fairly fit individuals, as the job had the potential to involve a lot of physical activity, but that didn&#39;t mean that they could perform such an athletic feat as easily as they did. But the second agent&#39;s need to flee and get away and made his focus on doing so.<br />
<br />
He made it onto the street in front of the school just as another police cruiser pulled up with its sirens flaring. He tried to turn away from the car, but the officer managed to move fast enough to block any direct route the second agent had of getting to the school, even if he wanted to. He was now running up the street to go around the school as the newly arrived officer got out of his cruiser and quickly joined the chase, drawing his gun in one hand. The second agent soon heard another set of boots thumping on the sidewalk behind him. He glanced back to see the newly arrived officer getting excellent acceleration on him. In doing so,  he noticed that the first two officers that were chasing him had taken up a pursuit angle that was allowing them to gain a lot of ground quickly, and they were gaining on him as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit,&quot; the second agent cursed to and turned forward see a uniformed female officer, the Moon Lake Junior High/Middle School security officer, moving around from a small office building that was between the Middle School building and the Moon Lake School District&#39;s transportation office and garage was. The second agent cursed this even more, &quot;Double shit...&quot;<br />
<br />
What happened next was somewhat expected. The second agent tried to plant his foot to make a tight turn and get around the female officer, but it wasn&#39;t sharp enough or she was quick enough to keep up with him. She hit the second agent like a linebacker and drive him hard to the ground. The second agent struggled and tried to get free, but found the woman&#39;s grip on one arm surprisingly strong and it was only by sliding his other arm up and down that he managed to keep her from getting hold of that one as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop resisting!&quot; she commanded him with narrowed eyes.<br />
<br />
The second agent managed to reach inside his jacket and get to the revolver he&#39;d shot &quot;Harry Jenkins&quot; with. He had used up all its bullets and he had no more with him, but he figured it&#39;d do for a club weapon  and tried to hit the female officer with it. However, his plan didn&#39;t work as he couldn&#39;t pull his arm back to truly use the gun as a club and doing so only let the female officer pin him down. She continued to order him to stop resisting as the other officers arrived. They&#39;d holstered their guns as the threat of him killing one of them was now much lower, but the second agent was quick to notice that the closest one had drawn his taser.  The first officer dove at the ground and grabbed the barrel of the second agent&#39;s gun and quickly pulled it from the second agent.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; the second agent screamed and managed to knee the female officer in the side.<br />
<br />
The female officer grunted as the blow was hard enough to make her release her grip, but even as the second agent tried to get out from under her, he lost his grip on the gun and the officer that had drawn his taser acted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Taser! Taser! Taser!&quot; the officer, Samson Carter, shouted.<br />
<br />
The female officer and the officer that had wrestled the second agent&#39;s gun away rolled and jumped back just as Officer Carter fired his taser. The lines flew and hit the agent in the chest and the gathered officers were quick to hear the mechanical clicking of the taser being activated. The second agent felt it as the electric current ran through him, and his whole body went rigid and shook under the current. It wasn&#39;t enough to electrocute him, but it was enough to get him to stop trying to get away. By the time the second agent had full control over himself again, he&#39;d been rolled onto his chest and his arms were pulled behind himself. He didn&#39;t have time to struggle as he felt a pair of handcuffs being placed on him. To add insult to injury, the first officer, Officer Ward, spoke to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re under arrest for the attempted murder of Henry Jenkins Junior,&quot; Officer Ward spoke, and then moved into his Miranda Rights.<br />
<br />
That left the second agent with a great deal of surprise and shock, as he thought he shot Harry Jenkins. He had no idea who Henry Jenkins Junior was. His thoughts were fairly simple and limited to one word...<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn,&quot; the second agent cursed himself in his mind. He barely noticed the officers patting him down and making sure he didn&#39;t have any more weapons hidden away.</p>
