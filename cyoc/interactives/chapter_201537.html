<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Uhm, I don&#39;t really like that thing of being my own girlfriend&#39;s mother...&quot; Said Rick, thinking about his new life. &quot;And actually having a husband... ugh, this doesn&#39;t feel right at all...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, this is also very weird for me, you know?&quot; Said Emily with a smile, enjoying all this a lot more than Rick. &quot;But this is also very cool, don&#39;t you think? Just think about everything we can do!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, maybe you are right... But now that we have seen what we would turn into, what should we do now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, how about we have some fun?&quot; She suggested, holding up the camera.<br />
<br />
&quot;Define fun here.&quot; He chuckled, rolling his eyes at Emily&#39;s suggestion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come onnnn, we only tried two modes; the random one and one of the blend in settings. Don&#39;t you wanna see what this thing can do?&quot; She smirked with a wide grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay okay fine.&quot; He sighed, but in doing so got a bit of his curly hair in his mouth. After blowing it out and spitting slightly, he glared at Emily who was trying her best not to burst out laughing. &quot;Just let&#39;s not mess with ourselves, please?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Promise!&quot; She smiled, although not really knowing herself whether she&#39;d stick to that promise. &quot;Okay, let&#39;s take turns, I&#39;ll go first!&quot; She yelled before rushing ahead.<br />
<br />
The two of them began to walk, and as they did so Emily reached up and grabbed Rick&#39;s hand. Rick blushed, cause although she normally did that, it made him feel more like a mother than before. He couldn&#39;t help but think about his new form, how it felt or moved. Were people checking him out? From the occasional eye glance from men of all ages, he quickly realized the answer was yes as his face grew more red.<br />
<br />
Emily, meanwhile, was too busy thinking about which mode to try out next. Eventually, she decided to pick at random. After a bit of eenie meenie minie moe she landed on Role swap.<br />
&quot;Hey, &#39;Mom&#39;, which Role swap setting should we try?&quot; Emily asked, placing emphasis on the word Mom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever you want, sweetie.&quot; Rick responded with snide, rolling his eyes at Emily&#39;s comment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Both it is!&quot; Emily laughed. &quot;Give me a second, cause the first one is gonna swap me somewhere.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What, what do you me-&quot; Rick began to ask before the bright FLASH of the camera interrupted him.<br />
<br />
Rick was stunned to see a little 8 year old boy, but was clearly NOT Emily. He had darker hair, a different face, and was wearing a different kind of t-shirt to boot. The little boy caught Rick staring, and that&#39;s also when he realized that his jaw had been opened. He closed it quickly, then gave a fake smile at the boy.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong Mommy?&quot; He innocently asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Um, uh, nothing... baby, I just...&quot; Rick stuttered before a husky voice interrupted him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Free sample?&quot; A deep, male voice asked. <br />
<br />
Rick turned to see a gruff, tall man that was standing near the food court. He was dressed mostly in white, and had a name-tag that read &quot;Eric&quot; on it. Rick could immediately tell that this was Emily. She looked like the spitting image of her father, but with a few of her mothers features and more hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Em- Eric, nice to see you.&quot; Rick replied, both shocked and relieved to see his girlfriend, even if she was currently a man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy you know this old guy?&quot; The boy asked, confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sort of...&quot; Emily laughed before bringing the camera up from behind the little booth. In an instant, a flash went off again, and suddenly Rick was now staring at a strange man. After squinting, he figured this was the little boy that had held her hand a moment ago. Rick looked back and saw a smirking Emily as a little boy holding his hand once again, and the camera in the other.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, do you want a sample orrr...?&quot; The man asked, confused why this woman was taking so long.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no we&#39;re fine, thank you though!&quot; Rick replied before swiftly dragging Emily along, away from the booth.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell was that?&quot; Rick whispered. <br />
<br />
&quot;I told you, Role swap! That was setting one.&quot; Emily explained. &quot;The setting swaps the picture taker&#39;s roles with the subject of the photo.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, it made you into what you would have been like if you had been born in his life... kinda?&quot; Rick asked, confused by his own sentence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe another example will show it better...&quot; Emily muttered as she glanced around the mall. &quot;How about those two?&quot; <br />
<br />
Rick looked over to see two people shopping together, and from the looks of it they were Father and daughter. The man was probably around 50, with slicked back black, receding hair and lots of jell. He was fairly tall but getting overweight, wore a blue suit, and looked impatient as he tapped his foot in annoyance. Next to him was a girl around 20, with long dark brown hair tied in a bun. She wore a tight green dress, was fairly fit with toned thighs and a fairly nice features. <br />
<br />
Rick wouldn&#39;t have mentioned that last part to Emily, but what distracted him was the older man who, upon seeing Rick looking at them, gave him a smile and a wink. Rick looked away quickly, blushing hard. He kept forgetting he was basically the definition of a MILF now. He made sure to fix his tits, trying to get rid of any cleavage, then looked back at Emily.<br />
&quot;So? What&#39;re you waiting for? Change them already.&quot; He muttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not so fun when you&#39;re the one getting gawked at huh?&quot; Emily teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just take the pictures.&quot; He grumbled, subconsciously brushing his curly hair behind his ear. <br />
<br />
Emily aimed the camera first at the man, and then she took a second photo of the girl, and after that flash the two had finally changed. The man and his daughter had clearly changed to be more like the other one. The new man had combed, brown hair. He wore a green sports jersey and blue jeans. He looked a little more youthful, and definitely more fit that the previous man. Next to him was a new girl with long, blonde hair that had dark black roots growing in. She was somewhat chubby, with large breasts and an even bigger ass. She wore a tight skirt and grey blouse, and also seemed to be holding more bags than the previous girl had been.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, now that&#39;s easier to see.&quot; Rick mumbled to Emily. Rick looked at the new man, and judged him to be someone Rick would&#39;ve actually enjoyed having a conversation with. This man glanced at Rick too, but also gave him a smile, though this smile was far warmer, more genuine overall. &quot;Kinda an improvement on that end.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah but kinda sucks on the other.&quot; Emily chuckled, looking at the new girl snootily browse through dresses that were too tight for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s go Daddy, this place sucks.&quot; They heard the girl whine as she began to walk out of the store. <br />
<br />
&quot;Should we put them back?&quot; Rick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah we probably should.&quot; Emily agreed, as she took a picture of the new father, and then the new girl, causing the change after the second flash.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly, while both were their own bodies again, but it was different than before. The black haired man had more hair, and was wearing a baseball sports coat with khakis. The girl, meanwhile, was still wearing a green dress, but seemed a bit less fit with more weight and longer, messier hair.<br />
&quot;You ready to go Dad?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay honey.&quot; He sighed, still seeming annoyed at what he was doing.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell?&quot; Emily muttered a little loud.<br />
<br />
&quot;Watch your language people still think you&#39;re a kid... but yeah I saw that. Why aren&#39;t they back to normal?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... idunno... but if I had to guess, I&#39;d say it guesstimated.&quot; She wondered aloud.<br />
<br />
&quot;What does that mean?&quot; Rick asked, even more confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it runs them through a reality change magic... whatever right? To swap their roles.&quot; She began to speculate. &quot;So maybe it picks different scenarios to make them fit the role.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh, so this time around it thought the dad&#39;s new love of sports would be critical for that role, and would still be involved meaning now the original dad is still fancy from his general personality but more involved with... baseball I guess?&quot; Rick said amazed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gosh, okay we gotta be careful going forward with this one.&quot; Emily added. &quot;Still, it worked out. The girl still seems happy and now the dad at least has a hobby.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I guess so.&quot; Rick mumbled. &quot;Still, it&#39;s kinda hot...&quot; He thought, not letting Emily know how the camera was starting to turn him on, or how the stares were also starting to get more interesting. &quot;So, what now?&quot; Rick asked.</p>
