<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Mike drives his new “bike” through the streets, while wearing his new and comfy “suit”, the man smiles wide, a huge feeling of joy raising inside of him, “this bike is amazing, the suit is so comfy,” he says to himself, “the program is awesome! I can do anything I want… I can redesign my life… make it better! And I think THAT is what I’m going to do! There are so many kids and teens out there who’d be more useful as some object, who needs them anyway? I think the first step would be to upgrade the way I live, I always wanted to be some rich guy… so, let’s begin with that!”<br />
<br />
Mike drives to the park, parking his bike in the lot, before heading into the park, taking off his helmet and sitting down on a bench. The man then pulls out his phone and opens the app, he then scans himself, then opens his file.<br />
<br />
Name: Mike Davis<br />
Race: Caucasian<br />
Age: 45<br />
Gender: male<br />
Children: none<br />
Sexual Orientation: straight<br />
Relationship status: married to Jane Davis<br />
Wealth: 20.000 $<br />
Occupation: Employee<br />
<br />
Mike smirks when he sees that he has no children, ‘looks like the reality alteration had worked,’ he thinks to himself, ‘Jeff and Tyrone no longer exist! Only because I’m immune to the reality alteration is why I am still able to remember those two lazy losers,’ Mike then begins to edit his file.<br />
<br />
Name: Mike Davis<br />
Race: Caucasian<br />
Age: 16<br />
Gender: male<br />
Children: none<br />
Sexual Orientation: straight<br />
Relationship status: single<br />
Wealth: 100.000.000 $<br />
Occupation: Founder and CEO of AI-Industries<br />
<br />
Grinning, Mike sets it so that his suit adjusts to his soon-to-be new age and size, he also sets the reality alteration, so that everyone, except him think it’s not weird that a 16-year-old own a company and has so much money, he then confirms the change.<br />
<br />
The man shivers, letting out a moan, when the tingling rushes through his body, his smile widening when he feels himself become younger, soon a 16-year-old is sitting on the bench, “perfect, now for the next step: finding the perfect residence,” he says, “I think I’ll buy some isolated grounds, maybe even a section of the forest outside of town, there I’ll “build” my dream home!”<br />
<br />
Mike opens the browser on his phone and soon finds the perfect grounds: a large clearing in the middle of the forest is up for sale, costing 2.000.000 $, without hesitating, the former adult purchases the clearing and soon receives an email from the seller with details and where to meet to do the paperwork.<br />
<br />
Two hours later, Mike exits a local restaurant with a large brown envelope tucked under his arms and a huge grin on his face, “that’s done,” he says, “now I just need to find the suitable “house”. And I know where to find… it,” he then drives to an area of the town where he knows that mostly kids who had run away from home or some orphanage hang out, those kids would be perfect for his plan, since no one will be missing them.<br />
<br />
As Mike drives towards the part of town, where all the street kids hang around, he notices a 12-year-old boy wearing torn jeans, sneakers and t-shirt walking on the pavement in the direction of an orphanage. Looking closely, Mike notices the sad expression on the boy’s face, the teen grins, ‘I think I found my house,’ he thinks to himself, “hey, kid,” Mike then calls out, driving slowly up to the boy.<br />
<br />
The boy jumps in surprise, turning around, “um… yes? Wh-what do you want,” he asks cautiously.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, I didn’t mean to startle you,” Mike says, turning off the engine of his bike and taking off his helmet, a friendly smile on his face, “I just couldn’t help but notice that you seem sad or depressed about something. Mind telling me what’s the matter?”<br />
<br />
The 12-year-old boy, who has short black hair, brown eyes and an athletic figure hesitates, “I… I shouldn’t be talking to strangers,” he then says, “besides… I don’t trust you”.<br />
<br />
Mike nods, “I get that,” he says, “my name is Mike, I am not planning anything to harm you, I can tell that you must be an orphan”.<br />
<br />
The boy’s eyes widen, “how?”<br />
<br />
“For one, your torn clothing,” Mike says, “and for two, the look on your face, it looks depressed, pained… frightened, and I doubt that the fear is about me, am I right?”<br />
<br />
The boy nervously looks around, he then sighs, “y-yeah… it’s… it’s that hell of an orphanage I live at,” he says, “they… they treat us all like… like trash… like unwanted animals”.<br />
<br />
“Damn, I’m sorry,” Mike says, “but… I might be able to help you not to have to return there”.<br />
<br />
The boy narrows his eyes, “and how do you think you’d be able to help me? You look no older than 16, so you’ll be unable to adopt me”.<br />
<br />
Mike grins, “who’s talking about adopting you,” he asks, “nah… I have something else in mind, but before I explain… what is your name?”<br />
<br />
“Toby,” the boy says.<br />
<br />
Mike smiles, “it is a pleasure to meet you, Toby,” he says, “now, why don’t you and I head someplace where we can talk in private? I promise, I’ll do nothing to harm you, I really just want to help. Besides… what have you got to lose?”<br />
<br />
Toby thinks for a while, “alright,” he then says, “I’ll come with you, you got me all curious”.<br />
<br />
Mike smiles, “then sit on my lap, I know a perfect place where we can talk,” he says. Toby hesitates, but then he climbs on Mike’s lap, Mike smiles, “hold on tight,” he says, before putting the helmet back on and soon they are zooming through the streets.<br />
<br />
After two hours, Mike and Toby arrive at the clearing in the forest Mike had just bought, both get off the bike and Mike takes off his helmet, “where are we, and why did you bring me here,” Toby asks, still not fully trusting Mike.<br />
<br />
“This clearing belongs to me, I just bought it,” Mike says, “I am planning to build my dream house here”.<br />
<br />
“Okay, but how is that supposed to help me,” Toby asks.<br />
<br />
Mike grins, “I want YOU to become my dream house!”<br />
<br />
“WHAT,” Toby exclaims, “you are crazy, man! How am I supposed to become a freaking house, and why should I,” the boy takes a step back.<br />
<br />
“Calm down, Toby,” Mike says, “let me explain first, and I want you to know, this is an offer! I am not going to force you, if you decline, I’ll simply drive you back to that… hell!”<br />
<br />
Toby stays silent for a while, he then slowly nods his head, “okay… fine, I’ll hear you out,” he says, “but if this is some crazy BS, I demand you take me back to that hell!”<br />
<br />
“I promise,” Mike says, “well, I have an app on my phone which is able to transform anything and anyone into anything imaginable. That bike and this suit, they were once my sons Jeff and Tyrone, Jeff is the bike and Tyrone is the suit. Also, I used the app to transform myself into a 16-year-old, plus I used it to make myself rich and the founder and CEO of AI-Industries”.<br />
<br />
Toby raises an eyebrow, “that… that sounds to crazy,” he says, “if what you say is true… did… did your son’s agree to becoming what they are now?”<br />
<br />
“To answer your question, yes, they agreed to it. They wanted to be something useful, because they both thought being a human was boring, now they are much happier,” Mike lies, “and what if I do a small demonstration? Would that convince you,” Mike asks, pulling out his phone.<br />
<br />
“Um… yeah,” Toby says.<br />
<br />
“Okay, what would you like me to do,” Mike asks.<br />
<br />
Toby thinks for a while, the boy looks around, he then notices a squirrel sitting on a branch of a nearby tree, the boy points at the small animal, “do something with that squirrel,” he says.<br />
<br />
Mike turns and looks at the animal, “okay, let’s see, first I need to scan it,” he says, activating the scanner, “now, I could transform it into a human, into something to eat, into a different animal,…”.<br />
<br />
“Um…,” Toby says, “can you… can you transform it into a raccoon?”<br />
<br />
“Of course,” Mike says with a grin, typing into his phone, “alright, ready?”<br />
<br />
“I guess,” Toby says.<br />
<br />
Mike smiles, “watch this,” he then confirms the input and both turn to watch the squirrel.<br />
<br />
At first nothing seems to happen, “pff… I knew you were talking BS,” Toby says.<br />
<br />
Mike grins, “patience,” he says, “it takes a while for the change to start, and it depends on what changes first, keep looking”.<br />
<br />
Toby reluctantly turns back to look at the squirrel, his eyes then widen, “wait… the squirrel looks bigger than before,” he exclaims, his eyes then widen more and his mouth hangs open as he watches the squirrel’s tail and coloring change, soon a raccoon is sitting on the branch, “no… way!”<br />
<br />
“Well, convinced,” Mike asks with a grin, Toby nods his head, to stunned to utter a word, “good, now, back to my offer,” Mike then says.<br />
<br />
Toby turns to look at Mike, “I… I don’t know,” he says, “I mean… I enjoy being a human… I… I don’t want to… you know… vanish”.<br />
<br />
Mike nods, “I was thinking and decided that I’d like you to be a smart-house,” he says, smiling wide, “you’ll still be you, but more like an AI which controls the house, your body, you’ll be able to see, feel, hear everything. You’d also be able to manifest as a hologram and move around the house and grounds, you’ll be a one of a kind house since there aren’t any houses like that around. And I promise to take good care of you”.<br />
<br />
Toby stays silent for a while, thinking it over, a smile begins forming on his face, which turns into a grin, “you know… that does sound cool,” he says, “being something so advanced, having finally a purpose and someone who’d really care for me… yeah… I think… I think I want to become that!”<br />
<br />
Mike smiles, “great,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Just one thing,” Toby says, “w-will it hurt?”<br />
<br />
Mike shakes his head, “I’ll make sure you’ll enjoy it,” he says, “but I’d need for you to take off all your clothes and walk into the center of the clearing”.<br />
<br />
Toby blushes, but then nods, starting to strip, “this… this feels so wrong and awkward,” he mumbles.<br />
<br />
Mike chuckles, “you’ll be a house soon, so don’t worry,” he says, activating the scanner, “you have a pretty athletic body, perfect for a strong house, I promise, you’ll be much happier and enjoy your new life”.<br />
<br />
“I do hope so,” Toby says, taking position in the middle of the clearing, “well… do it! I’m ready,” he then says.<br />
<br />
Mike nods and begins typing away on his phone, choosing a large Victorian style mansion, which has an indoor pool, outside pool, an entertainment room, an office, five bedrooms, six bathrooms, a large garage, an advanced security system. He also adds that the grounds should be surrounded by high thick concrete walls, a large gate, a large garden at the back, a pathway, a driveway and a road that connects his property to the main road. He also sets that the interior of the mansion should be created from Toby’s organs: the boy’s brain becoming the main computer and server system located in the basement, his bones becoming furniture, his lungs the ventilation and cooling system, his heart the electricity and heating, the boy’s cock the main sewer pipe, with additional sewer pipes connecting the house to the sewer and fresh water supply. He then gives Toby the ability to control everything that is a part of his new appearance, like the security system, appearing as a hologram.<br />
<br />
Mike looks over the changes and nods, “okay, I think that’s all, if I should have forgotten anything I can add that later,” he says, before hitting confirm, then looks up to watch Toby become his dream house.</p>
