<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You hear giggling from the other side of the café. &quot;That broken flashlight keeps shining on the primals, maybe the guy just has a thing for them.&quot;<br />
<br />
You turn to where you heard that, and see a bunch of gossiping girls. One opposite the first smiles as she sees you looking. &quot;He&#39;s kind of cute though, I wouldn&#39;t mind the attention.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know right?&quot; the first said, and the whole table started giggling.<br />
<br />
Its then you felt like there was some noticeable shift in the atmosphere of the café. Everyone was looking either at them or you... But they all seemed kind of amused... Was using the flashlight more making reality shift so that its more normal for you to use it? And what of that term &#39;primals&#39;? Is that accepted term for &#39;animal person&#39;?<br />
<br />
You caught a sort of look from rose, it was like she could read that you were thinking about humouring them; and she gave you a sort of flick of her head and eyes like she was daring you to do it.<br />
<br />
You flicked on the animal setting, and whispered the word &quot;cat&quot; into it, hopefully you wouldn&#39;t need to be more specific. And you shone the light over them less subtly, making it clear that at the very least you were playing along with them. You started by shining the light on their top halves and smoothly moved down, making sure to only shine on their face until their muzzles and ears had pressed out so they still had some semblance of human hair and human mind in case the light gave people animal minds. You spent a good bit of time shining it on their lower halves, and their pants and skirts flickered out of existence but you could still see they were wearing panties, barely covered by a shirt that seems to be a bit longer. You clicked it off and observed them out of the corner of your eye, and you could see they had a few extra teats poking into their shirts, which almost seemed purposely tight just to show off their curves.<br />
<br />
As you listened, the newly minted cat girls continued giggling. &quot;I knew he liked our kind, got to love the tail,&quot; the first said, practically wiggling her butt and tail as she said it. She looked to be covered in almost pure white fur now. <br />
<br />
The second one giggled, having been turned into a full black cat. &quot;From the looks of it, he&#39;s probably more into our legs,&quot; she said, her cheeks fluffed like she was blushing as she wiggled her toes for effect.<br />
<br />
You noted there were two other girls with them. A ginger one with dark spots, and a grey one with dark stripes... You don&#39;t know how long you spent listening to them and watching, when you suddenly felt a kiss on the neck, and Rose&#39;s voice whispering in your ear. &quot;That flashlight isn&#39;t really broken is it?&quot; You glanced over to see her grinning mischievously, perhaps because she was more fox-like now. &quot;Play along,&quot; she whispered.<br />
<br />
She made a play at trying to bang it on the table, and the other customers giggled. She then imitated what you did before, saying &#39;Eagle&quot; into the mic. Then you could see her shining it on a woman in the corner. You couldn&#39;t see her changing, but you knew from context she had to have changed... It was weird, you remembered seeing the wing armed lady when you walked in, and you could almost swear you were checking out her gorgeous tail and talons earlier, and you had no idea what those parts might have looked like before... But you knew what the flashlight did, since you knew how it worked.<br />
<br />
But that statement the girls made earlier did make you think... Everyone you pointed to was now an animal girl, and not everyone believed in coincidences… So maybe that&#39;s how...<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t matter now, since now Rose knew for sure, and was trying not to make an excited noise as she handed it back to you reluctantly. &quot;This is amazing,&quot; she whispered, &quot;what else can it do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A few things,&quot; you started, &quot;but mostly I&#39;ve turned guys into girls or close to it, and here the whole animal thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
She hugged up, and at this point you weren&#39;t sure if it was another distraction or a legit show of affection. &quot;This is so cool,&quot; she whispered, &quot;even the fact I can&#39;t remember, the fact you can make me think its always been like this, its so hot.&quot; She pulled back a little, and looked you right in the eyes. &quot;How far were you planning on going?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was considering turning the whole café into animal girls,&quot; you say, starting to blush as she watches you.<br />
<br />
You hear to make some kind of trill, kind of remining you of a cat, and seems strange coming out of her. &quot;Do it,&quot; she whispers, &quot;after closing time, I want to hear all about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
She tries to play it cool heading back to her rounds, but she already looks really excited, even wagging her tail a little; but the real attention draw seemed to be the hip sway, you could only guess that somehow she was aroused by this whole idea.<br />
<br />
You noted that since most of the girls in the café were now animalistic, coffee shops are small after all. The rest of the unchanged patrons were mostly male at this point, so you figured you might as well start with the genders and do them all at once.<br />
<br />
You track a moderate setting of pink gender light across the entire Café, trying to get full body of everyone, and making sure that everybody gets enough of a dose to at least get some B-cup sized breasts; figuring its long enough that their dick is probably gone, but not so long people would be getting annoyed at being shone on.<br />
<br />
Its kind of funny when you start focusing on a team of footballers who came in, looking kind of uncomfortable with their whole kit on, and the light suddenly turns them all into a women&#39;s soccer team. Taking a cue from the mascot that appeared on their sweats, you whispered into the animal mic for them to become &#39;sled dogs&#39;, and you weren&#39;t disappointed when they all turned into huskies, save for one who was mixed Asian who seemed to become a cross with a Shiba Inu, which gave you a chuckle.<br />
<br />
After the ones already in the Café were sorted, you started relaxing, it was less of a risk to change them more if you aren&#39;t having to do all the changes at once, and with only a few people coming in at a time, you could spend the time between customers laying low by not using the flashlight. More-over, the coffee was getting pretty good as the day went on; and rose would sometimes make a gesture that showed you that you missed some former guy&#39;s cock with the gender light. Afterwards you&#39;d find yourself wondering what Rose thought she was pointing out once the reality change set in... Did she question what she thought she was pointing out?<br />
<br />
It did get harder and harder to keep track of all the people you were changing however, so you ended up getting Rose to give you a note pad. The two of you figured that the notepad wouldn&#39;t be re-written if you wrote what you were recording after the fact. though it would certainly confuse a viewer if they paid any attention, but luckily, most stuck to themselves. You did frustratingly notice details on the pad keep changing, not really altering the overall idea.<br />
<br />
You didn&#39;t always make them completely feminine afterwards... You&#39;d thought about turning any businessmen into deer, and figured that the guys you&#39;d let keep a stag head but a doe body just for variety, and you&#39;d managed to keep that up for a while... But after like the fifth group of businessmen you had gotten bored of deer, and instead ended up turning a group of bankers into great busty gryphons.<br />
<br />
Of course... The day couldn&#39;t last forever.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
The café was closed and it was just you and Rose through your notes, and with each one she would say how much she believed who they were. A lot of the early ones she accepted pretty easily, since you didn&#39;t focus on the feminization for as long. With a lot of the regulars she&#39;d go on for a bit about how she remembered some of them coming to the café specifically because a lot of &#39;primals&#39; hung out there. By the end of it, she was talking about how she remembered joining up at the café for a similar reason, that for a long time she believed she&#39;d never meet any others like her only for them all to show up at once in this one part of town. Or how she&#39;d marvelled at how unique she looked all the time to the point of turning herself on in the mirror, and how she appreciated how the thick fur meant she could get away with shorts in the winter, and how she sometimes desperately wanted to strip off her underclothes during the summer.<br />
<br />
She looked at you as you were beginning to nod off. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m probably boring you... You might be sitting on the more interesting side of things.&quot;<br />
<br />
You chuckled. &quot;No, not really; between not getting a chance to really savour it with having to do it on mass, and the fact it looses an element of surprise after a while... I&#39;m starting to think you&#39;ve got the better deal.&quot;<br />
<br />
She snickered. &quot;Maybe you should use it on yourself then,&quot; she said, &quot;after all, you did say the whole café, and you&#39;ve been in it for some time.&quot;<br />
<br />
You shrug. &quot;I&#39;ll think about it... I mean, I can just use the reset button if I screw up, or I could see if there&#39;s an awareness setting in this manual.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No need to use the reset button on me,&quot; she said, waving it off. &quot;I don&#39;t think the plain jane version of me would be all that interesting to remember.&quot;<br />
<br />
You raised an eyebrow. &quot;Even if you can&#39;t be sure you even were a girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
She giggled. &quot;If I were a boy, I would think you would have been a lot more amused when you changed me.&quot;<br />
<br />
You shrug, conceding the point. &quot;In any case... It might be nice to have someone around who remembers what the other can&#39;t. You can remember the post change reality, I remember most of the original reality, save for the harpy.&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded and the two of you exchanged phone numbers. You did spend a little bit discussing what to do next; you think you should...</p>
