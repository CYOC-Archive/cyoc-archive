<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Diane arrived home from the bus ride to the mall, and headed towards her room, making her sure to lock it so her younger brother doesn&#39;t wreck her room while she&#39;s home. Diane was thinking about her time at the mall with her friends, laughing with Bets, hanging out with Chastity, but then she remembered the man that Bets giggled at, the one with the frizzy hair. Something about him felt off to Diane. It&#39;s wasn&#39;t the hair, it wasn&#39;t the clothes, it wasn&#39;t the 250 pounds of weight, but it was something. She thought about it for a while, trying to guess  why she felt that way about that moment, until her thoughts trailed off into what she was going to do with her friends tomorrow, where it was going to be held, etc.<br />
<br />
&quot;At the beach would be fun, we could play beach volleyball or we could go to the zoo and see the giraffes, that would be fun. I like the zoo with all those cute animals, especia- Wait, what was I thinking about before?&quot; Diane thought, as if every thought in her head was a tweet.<br />
<br />
She sighed. Diane was the brightest kid at school. Her thoughts would usually trail off, like she was a fish with her head in the clouds. She didn&#39;t like being the friend that couldn&#39;t focus on what was happening. That&#39;s why she slightly envied April. April knew where she wanted to go in her life. April was already planning which UNI she wanted to go to, the accommodation, the job she would have there, the works. And all of this half-way through the years where she didn&#39;t know what score she was going to get, but her friends knew. April was a grade A student, and Diane, put simply, was not.<br />
<br />
Diane laid on her bed, thinking about how great it would be if she would have the intelligence of someone like April. &quot;I wish I was smart like April&quot; Diane said to herself. That funny feeling that she had before came back, but the feeling mainly focused on her brain. Something didn&#39;t felt right with Diane, so much so that it actually hurt. &quot;Ow, something&#39;s awry with my Cerebrum&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Diane froze. She never used words like &quot;awry&quot; and &quot;Cerebrum&quot;. For her, she didn&#39;t know the meaning of any of those words. She did now. Her brain felt like it was increasing in size, like all the brain cells she barely used were actually connecting to create some form of intelligence for Diane. Any sort of information that existed was being scanned by Diane&#39;s mind. Shakespeare, Dickens, Hawking, Einstein, all of it was going into her, once small, now expanding brain. But as she was learning about every named star in our galaxy, she was wondering how she was getting the information. Her eyes widened. She knew now.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
April was writing another email to the UNI that she wanted to go to, for the twenty-fifth time. If she wanted something that could benefit her in the future, she was going to be persistent about it. &quot;Dear Saint Mathews University...&quot; spoke April, repeating every word she was going to write into her email. &quot;I would like to be a part of the meet-up at the campus on the Thursday next month. Is there any way where I cou-&quot; April looked up to her screen and noticed some spelling mistakes. She backspaced the sentence and went back to the starting point. &quot;Dear Siant Mathew Univesreity... I wa dted to go to te camps cathp&quot; April immediately looked back up to the screen and became a little annoyed. She didn&#39;t know what was going on, she aced spelling in primary and keyboard typing in Year 3, it&#39;s not like she bonked her head and forgot about them. She tried again, backspacing everything on the email. &quot;Dar snat mahe Univesrity...&quot; She stopped again, becoming more agitated, clawing at her desk. &quot;DR SZOFT MSAndJTSAJD UFENwocigIGIFYGIKBHBA&quot; She became angrier and angrier, not noticing her hairs on her arms standing up, and her ears becoming rounder. &quot;Let try again&quot; April thought, completely oblivious to the fact that she didn&#39;t think &quot;Let&#39;s&quot;. &quot;DRIWQGDKB SOHUGSFYDJV MIKDGYJFVDHBN UUNOREBFYIJESDCVABDONURIFEDWVJHABS&quot;. She was furious, her hatred of not knowing what&#39;s wrong with her spelling took over from her noticing that the back of her hands started sprouting black hairs, faster and faster, and that her nose was pushing out a bit more, starting to fuse with her top jaw. April was heavily breathing with pure hate. &quot;If this doesn&#39;t fix, me scream&quot; April thought, as words start to fall out of her mind. She tried again, this was going to be the last time. If this didn&#39;t work, April was going to let Hell break loose.<br />
<br />
&quot;KJEGHFHKLASDHIODUGYFWJHEVBKLDASCHOYUIGYDJFEVWHBKLNAJSXZOYUICGDJSHVBAKSLUOYICTGUFEJH&quot; <br />
<br />
April screeched at the highest pitch that she ever reached and her more muscular-than-before hands slammed down on the keyboard, as keys flew from across the room. She battered and slashed the keyboard to pieces, and threw the monitor on the floor, as she roared in anger. April hopped off her chair. She noticed that her back wasn&#39;t straight as before, she believed that she must of sat on that chair so much that it caused her back problems. Her arms seemed to be longer too, and the fur on her arms was also a hu-<br />
<br />
April stopped dead. &quot;Fur? Why me have fur?&quot; April stopped again, as she realised her thought patterns dumbed down. She moved closer to the monitor screen, scared to see what has happened to her. She etched closer and closer. On the cracked computer screen, she finally saw what she looked like.<br />
<br />
In front of her was a person with a pushed out monkey nose, with fur slowly growing to the sides. <br />
<br />
&quot;EEEEEEEEK!!&quot; she screeched.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Diane wished to be smart like April. The wish must of got lost in translation, as she was getting all the knowledge April had, and now April is turning into a monkey. Diane had to find April and quick.</p>
