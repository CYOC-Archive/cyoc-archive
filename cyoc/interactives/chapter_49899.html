<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gloira thought about her options on how to turn into a robot and came up with a final conclusion.  She decided to transform her entire body into a metallic, mechanical, moving, talking robot.  It might be cool for her to know what its like to be an android and not worry about doing the things humans can’t do.  And she would enjoy something new for once.  So Gloria started to close her eyes and focused on turning into a female android.  What she wanted was her change to go from her feet all the way up to her head and it needs to be a slow transformation so that way she could feel all the changes all over her.  When she started to feel the tingling in her body, she knew that the changes have started.<br />
<br />
The first thing that changes was the toes of her feet.  Gloria looked down to see the beginning of her changes.  First, she saw her nicely painted toenails disappear out of thin air, leaving nothing but ten sets of naked toes.  Suddenly, all of her toes seem to be melting and merging together, shaping into what appears to be a pointed front.  Then the skin color on the front went from its tannish peach color to a silver like color, shining up to a chrome like substance.  It started to spread trough her feet until it reaches the end.  Once the color reaches the end of her feet, a new appendage popped on her heel and grew three to four inches in length.  Lifting one of her feet up, Gloria saw that the appendage was actually a metallic stand for her heel.  She was surprised that her feet would turn into a metal high heel shoe, but at least she won’t have to worry about buying shoes anymore, let alone clothes of any kind.<br />
<br />
The chrome metal then moved up her legs and creeping up her thighs.  She could see the chrome shining in the light and the reflection of the hotel room was pretty unique.  But there is something else Gloria notices.  On her knees and bridges of her feet, indents were formed and darkening, creating dents between her feet and legs and her legs and thighs.  She realized that they are were in fact joints to help her move more easily instead of being too stiff.  Inside her body was another different change together.  Her human insides are being changed into robotic insides.  Her bones have harden into titanium steel skeleton, her muscles morphed into servos, and her nerve straitened and tilted into circuitry.  Gloria could feel every part of her body inside out and she was beginning to like it.<br />
<br />
The chrome skin continued to spread all the up to her waist area as more mechanical joints between her thighs and lower body.  This is the part where she would dread the most, her vagina.  Gloria looks closely to her privates just to see the changes that are about to take place.  First she could see all of her neatly trimmed pubic hair thinning and sinking into her skin, leaving her pussy completely bald.  Then her vagina lips started to seal itself from top to bottom like it was a magical zipper closing it completely.  She could feel her ovaries and other sex organs inside her disintegrating and vanishing away in an instant.  All Gloria could see is just a smooth metallic crotch with no opening at all.<br />
<br />
Gloria then started to wonder if her rear did the same just like her pussy, so she turned around to see for herself.  Lucky for her, her ass didn’t close up but it did had a shiny coat of chrome silver that shines oh so brightly.  She also notices that it doesn’t jiggle any more since her human flesh was long gone.  Now every time she moves, her butt would be staying in place, another mere sacrifice for herself and her body.  But as curious as she is, Gloria decided to place her hand deep into her ass to feel an opening in between.  To her surprise, there was none, just a smooth surface between her ass cheeks.  She could even feel part of her digestive system melting away from within her body.  Upon feeling that, she sighed to herself and said, “Oh well, guess I won’t have a problem going to the bathroom anymore.”<br />
<br />
When wondering about her butt, she had completely forgot about the rest of her body.  Gloria quickly turned to the mirror and just to see if there were other changes in her body she missed.  What she saw was her chrome metal spreading up her stomach and below her chest.  The smooth metal made her hourglass figure nicely detailed and the reflection designs were completely innovated.  She saw her belly button rising up from the inside until there was nothing left but a smooth surface.  She could even feel her insides changing into something more mechanical.  The rest of her digestive system was long gone and her stomach expanded and squared, turning into a fuel take.  Gloria could even feel gears appearing in her and moving on their own.  She noticed a smooth line was in the center of her hourglass waist.  Wondering what is was, she turned her waist left to right and notice that the top part of the hourglass is moving while the bottom isn’t.  Thinking of doing something completely ridiculous, she turned her upper body around 360 degrees to see her entire room.  Once she positioned herself right and was shocked that she could do what no other human would.  With eyes wide in amazement, she laughed with glee and excitedly said, “Wow!  That was so cool!”<br />
<br />
Gloria watched on as the chrome spread all to the way up to her breasts, another thing she liked about herself.  The shine of her breasts was stunning and the way it shapes her cups made her look mouthwatering.  Her nipples were smooth and almost invisible, as if someone buffed them for more then ten minutes.  They no longer bouncing any more as the metal made them unmovable after each movement.  All of her organs that kept Gloria functional and healthy were changing drastically.  Her lungs collapsed in on itself and shriveled away, causing her to not breath.  Her kidneys melted away as her liver shrank to nothing.  And her heart stopped beating and withered away like rotting fruit, dissolving into dust.  Replacing all of her organs were multiple gears and circuitry to help keep her robotic body completely functioning.  Gloria was going to panic when she realize she doesn’t need air to breathe or blood to pump.  With the systems and gears that are working in her, she won’t have to worry about dying.<br />
<br />
She could feel the chrome washing over her arms all the way down to her hands.  She looks down at them just to see what changes have taken place.  As always, the metal sheen was completely flawless with robotic joints on her shoulders, elbows, and wrists.  Gloria took a closer look at her hands and noticed other changes as well.  Her hand and finger print designs are no longer there.  Instead, it was replaced with a smooth metallic surface.  Her fingernails went away with the toenails from earlier, leaving each fingertip pointy and naked.  She could also see mechanical on each part of the ten fingers, flexing them back and forth to see how they function.  She wasn’t expecting the mechanical sounds on her fingers as she said, “This is something I have to get use to if I’m ever going to be-“<br />
<br />
Suddenly, her voice was just cut off, as if she couldn’t even talk.  Gloria could feel the chrome metal moving up her neck and where her vocal chords are placed.  She cold feel the cords thinning and detaching themselves, leaving her voice completely mute for the moment.  A few moments later, a box of some kind grew in her neck and was connected with wires and small speakers.  Gloria knew that what’s in her neck is her new voice box and decided to test it out.  “Testing, testing, 1, 2, 3…” she said as she tried out her new voice.  It sounded like her old voice, but it had a bit of a metallic tint in the background.  She needs to get use to that too if she needs to talk to people in her new form.<br />
<br />
Gloria knew her transformation is almost complete.  The only thing that’s left of her was her human head as she looked into the mirror at see the last part of the change.  The metal slowly moved up from her chin to her mouth as the changes swept through easily.  Her lips remained the same as the chromed covered them up and was completely detailed.  Her pearly white teeth got harder and turned into stainless steel choppers.  Even her tongue was covered in the same chrome like substance and was shining in her mouth.  She could already feel movable sticks in her tongue and around the insides of her helps to make her movement more realistically then the rest as she opens and close her mouth just to see how it works.  The metal chrome then moved up her nose as it starts to shrink away.  Soon enough, her nose was long gone and in its place was nothing put a smooth surface.  Gloria thought that without a nose, she couldn’t breath but since her lungs were gone, she doesn’t need oxygen needed to keep her alive.<br />
<br />
Once the metal moved up to her ears, a different change had occurred.  They started to compress and close up instantly, making her loose her hearing completely.  But then, what’s left of her ears started to form into metal balls and started to grow sideways, forming some kind of antennas prongs at the end blinking light blue.  Her hearing went back and it sounded much better and much clearer.  She used her hands to feel her antenna like ears and was impressed by how they were changed.  As she was looking at her new ears, Gloria’s sight was starting to feel all blurry.  She knew that the chrome was around her eyes so she was prepared for the inevitable.  In a matter of seconds, the world around her went black and she couldn’t see a thing so she stood there and wait for her sight to come back.  While she was waiting, her eyes started to shift and expand wider.  After that change was over, her vision went back and it was something completely different.  The world around her was covered in a blue color with light and dark shades on everything judging by how they’re positioned.  Upon looking at the mirror, a lighter highlight blinked a couple of times and a description bar came up next to it.  She looked closer to the mirror and saw the changes on her eyes.  Instead of two eyes, there’s just one eye and it was wide almost up to her new ears.  It was almost like some kind of green visor she saw in sci-fi movies.<br />
<br />
All that was left of her human self was her hair and her brain.  All of her long black hair slowly shrank up to her head and simply sank right into her ski, leaving her completely bald.  At the same time, the chrome slowly went up her head and covered up the rest of her human flesh.  As it covered up her dome, her brain started to mush up and reshape itself to many ways.  Gloria’s brain flatten and expanded itself to form a dome that’s the same size as her skull and multiple wires came out and implanted into each part of her body.  A microprocessor then appeared in the middle of the dome and was connected with multiple wires and circuits.  When her human brain was replaced by a processor, all of her memories have changed.  All of her human life was replaced with her life as being a mechanical robot with her family now a team of scientists working on a high intelligent android, being built instead of being born, and her education at school is replaced with downloading everything in her head.  Even her name was not Gloria anymore, since she’s no longer human.  Instead, her name is now G-30 being G stand for Gloria and 30 for the age of 30 years old.<br />
<br />
What appears to be almost five minutes, G-30’s transformation is complete.  She looked at her body and was completely amazed by the transformation.  Her body looks like the sexy android from one of those Heavy Metal magazines with a body to die for and the metallic chrome that makes her feel very seductive.  Turning around to get another view, she whistled to herself and said in a metallic voice, “Not bad…  So this is what being a female android is like.  I feel so hot…”  She turned around to see her room and notice that it too had changed to match her body.  Her bed is a charging berth to regenerate her power, the bathroom is replaced by a repair station to fix her body if its broken, and her luggage full of things she needs vanished into thin air since she doesn’t need any clothes to wear.  After looking around her newly modified room, she rubbed her chrome chin and said, “Now let’s see…  What should I do with my new body?”</p>
