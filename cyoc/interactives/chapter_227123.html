<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Welcome,” Edward Heartpaw shouting as a group of furies walked into his backyard. While everyone at the table was drawing a blank, Edward and Julian recognized the group straight away.<br />
“Glad you could make it,” the anthro fox fury beaming as he approach the anthro black bear fury and his mate an anthro bald eagle fury. Also with the couple was a young looking female black bear. Edward recognized her as their daughter; however her name eludes him.<br />
“Sora,” the anthro grizzly looking at Edward; “our daughters name.”<br />
<br />
“Yes,” Edward nodding as he escorts the family to the large table. Giving everyone introductions, the group soon learned that the anthro black bear is Bob Clawfoot and his mate the anthro bald eagle fury is named Atoli. Their daughter Sora, was six years old and was three months old before the fury flu pandemic hit the world. The group soon sat back down just as Bob and Atoli joined; their daughter Sora ended up sitting next to Jimmy J.R who was across the table was Dusk and Dawn.<br />
“Eveyone,” Edward speaking; “Just grab a plate and stuff yourself silly.”<br />
<br />
The cubs needed no further instruction as fury paws snatched up burgers and hotdog; slapping down cheese, mustard, ketchup and other assorted condiments. An adult could be heard to tell them to grab some corn and a salad. Dusk reluctantly scooped up some potato salad while Dawn just doubled down on chips out of spite. This action did not go un-noticed as Jake Proudhoof glanced her way and shook his head dis approvingly. Whether or not Dawn noticed it was moot as she already had her plate full and was already ripping into her burger. Meanwhile Jimmy J.R opted for a hot dog loaded with onions and ketchup. Also on his plate was a cob of corn and a bit of potato salad. Jimmy glanced at Sora, the anthro bear cub fury and noticed she had a hamburger with just cheese and side of corn.<br />
“My grandfather cooked most of this,” Jimmy J.R speaking through bites of the corn; “mom says he loves to BBQ.”<br />
“I bet Grandpa could do better,” Dawn sneering at her cousin; “plus your dad can’t boil water.”<br />
“At least he doesn’t try to torment other fury’s pets,” Jimmy J.R biting back.<br />
“Just you wait,” Dawn whispering; making sure her voice was low enough that her parents who are too close for her comfort. “Dickens can’t hide forever.”<br />
<br />
“So Bob,” Edward ripping through one of the chicken leg’s he grilled; “what is the status on your parents?&quot;<br />
Bob sighed as he put down the burger he had loaded with peppers and tomatoes. “Still in prison for their crimes.” Bob was referring to the raid that took place in Silver Springs Montana six years ago. Bob’s parents were running a religious fundamentalist sect that didn’t believe that the government could tell them what to do. When the federal agents raided the compound, they rescued Bob’s siblings Evelyn, 12years old at the time; and his brother Ezekiel, 14 at the time. Both were being forced to work as servants. Evelyn was supposed to be sent away as a child bride to a forty year old Polygamous. His parents charged with a host of criminal acts; the biggest, child abuse and child endangerment. Bob was supposed to fly down to Billings and testify as to what he witnessed/experienced in his parent’s compound, however this was the time when the fury flu pandemic was released thank to Denise Proudhoof. The trial was naturally delayed, but after society re-righted itself; the push to proceed was renewed by a fury prosecutor.<br />
<br />
“Fortunately,” Bob sipping from a bottle of beer; “I didn’t need to testify. The Prosecutor got more than enough evidence from crime scene photos as well as statement from my brother and sister. However, Evelyn and Ezekiel had to testify and when they appeared on the stand, Mom and dad flipped their lids.”<br />
“Why is that,” Julian jumping in after settling Adam into his high chair and providing him some chicken to eat.<br />
“Because they are furies,” Bob answers; recalling that Evelyn turned into and anthro grizzly fury while his brother Ezekiel  became a spotted leopard fury. “Mom and dad are still human and view us as abominations. They caused such a disruption that the judge had to order a recess and put them in a separate room that would allow them to view the proceeding but not stop it with their outbursts. They got convicted in the end,” Bob taking a bite of his burger; “not sure which prison they ended up in. I refuse to have any contact with them.”<br />
<br />
“It’s a shame your siblings couldn’t join us,” Atoli responding as she tears through the chicken thanks to her sharp beak. “They would have jumped at the chance for this.”<br />
“I know,” Bob nodding; “but Ezekiel couldn’t get leave and is stuck in Louisiana helping to repair the levees from the last hurricane.”<br />
“And your sister,” Julian speaking; “if you don’t mind me asking.”<br />
“She landed a scholarship to Cornell University,” Bob smiling; “and somehow stumbled upon her mate. She is with his family for the semester break. From what I heard,” Bob taking another sip of his beer; “he is Rhino fury and his family is supposedly comes from old money.”<br />
“I hope she doesn’t develop a sooty demeanor the next time she visits with him in tow,” Julian snorting; leaning and looking down the table to see if the cubs are behaving or not.<br />
<br />
“Come on Oliver,” Lucas trying to feed is son some chicken; “I know your hungry, you’ve been drooling the moment I put you in your chair.&#39;<br />
“Just leave him be darling,” Rachael taking a large bite of her hotdog in a very seductive manner; “he’ll eat at his own pace just like Paul over here.”<br />
Lucas looks at his mate from across the table and feels a twinge of arousal as she nearly deep throats the dog she shoved into her muzzle. Turning his head to see Oliver’s twin brother Paul peeling sliver of chicken off of the large chunk on his plate. Snacking on the slivers, Lucas turns to see Oliver following suit with his chicken.<br />
“See,” Rachael now munching on a cob of corn; “they just need to learn on their own and by watching the others.”<br />
<br />
“Can I have one of those things,” Roxy looking at her mother while pointing to a plate full of deviled eggs.<br />
“Okay,” Denise passing the plate to her anthro tigress cub; “but only one, these can be very rich with the mayonnaise mixed in with the yolks. Have some carrots and celery sticks with it,” Denise taking the plate back and passing the crudité platter to her daughter.<br />
“Pass that over here when Roxy has her fill please,” Michael wiping his hoof hands clean with a nearby napkin. The Anthro stag-deer fury polishing off a whole quarter chicken along with a double cheese burger and some potato salad.<br />
“Are you sure you are going to have room for pie afterwards,” Denise looking at her mate pig out on the feast.<br />
“It depends on the pie,” Michael smiling slyly before lowering his voice; “rumor is Edward is going to host another sex lottery.”<br />
“Oh,” Denise looking over at the end and watching the fox fury chat with the anthro black bear before getting up to grab more meat that has been staying warm on the BBQ. “It’s been a while since we had one of those,” Denise rumbling with desire; “If the Clawfoots are staying for that, then this is going to get fun.”<br />
<br />
“So what is the matter with those too,” Sora looking at Jimmy J.R as the the anthro wolf and doe cubs sitting across from them get up and leave the picnic table.<br />
“They are my older twin cousins,” Jimmy answering glumly; “and they like to torment.&quot;<br />
“Wait,” Sora looking at the two and noticing that half of their fur is pink; “they tried to mess with the garbage can during school lunch!”<br />
“You know,” Jimmy looking at  the black bear cub; “how?”<br />
“We are in the same school,” Sora chuckling; “I’m just a year older. Everyone has heard of the pinkies,”  Sora speaking loud enough so that Dusk and Dawn turned around and glared at the bear cub; “shall I sing the song or recite the other nicknames you two have?”<br />
“Do it,” Dawn glaring; “and you will regret it.”<br />
Sora just lifts up a hand paw showing off her trimmed yet sharp claws; “the only one regretting anything is the dumb dumb who thinks they can pick a fight with me.”<br />
Jimmy J.R picking up on what Sora just implied looked at his hand paw and flexed his digits; showing off his retractable claws; “Stay away from Dickens.”<br />
<br />
“Who is Dickens,” Sora asking as Dawn skulks back to the corner of the yard she and her brother staked when they arrived earlier.<br />
“Dickens is my pet cat,” Jimmy J.R answering as he reaches for another hot dog; “and those two tried to torture him last year.”<br />
“How and why,” Sora looking at the twins as they glared back at her.<br />
“Dawn had Dusk hold me down as she tried to shave off the fur of Dickens,” Jimmy pausing as he remembers the frightening incident. She managed to get a strip off of my cat before mom came to investigate my cries and screams. I never saw her more furious that day,” Jimmy looking at the black bear cub; “mom’s wrist gave a spooky glow and then my cousins were completely pink. Then she picked them up by the scruff and hauled them to Aunt Brittany. There was a massive shouting match, followed by a less than pleased Aunt having to look at my terrified kitty and seeing the patch of fur missing from him.”<br />
“How horrible,” Sora looking at the twin’s; “why would they do that?”<br />
Jimmy J.R just shrugs his shoulders as he had no answer.</p>
