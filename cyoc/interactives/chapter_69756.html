<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You were just an ordinary teenage boy. You were 16 years old and had some <br />
good friends, not popular but definitely not a dork. Just average. You had no <br />
siblings, but your aunt and her son lived with your family due to a nasty divorce. <br />
Nothing too strange went on in your life. Until tonight. <br />
<br />
You had gone to bed as normally as any other night, but in the middle of the <br />
night you woke up in a cold sweat. You thought you had heard something. Sure <br />
enough, there was a quiet noise under your bed. You weren't sure whether to <br />
stay in bed or go turn the light on and investigate. When whatever was under <br />
there bumped the bed from underneath, you knew you had to get out of there. <br />
You got up and leapt from the bed, but before you could even touch the ground, <br />
something caught you in midair. <br />
<br />
To your horror, you turned to face a giant snake. It was as thick as an oil barrel <br />
and longer than two buses! How it had gotten into your house and fit under the <br />
bed, you had no idea. However, you were more concerned with the fact that <br />
you were caught in its coils and the caution cone sized fangs dripping venom <br />
and ready to strike.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, you heard a loud crack. Both you and the snake turned your heads <br />
towards the noise. It was a young boy, maybe 12 or 13 years old. He had jet <br />
black hair cut short and brilliantly bright green eyes. He wore a tuxedo, dress <br />
pants and shoes, white gloves, and a top hat. A black cape hung from his <br />
shoulders and he held a straight black cane in one hand.<br />
<br />
The snake moved you behind it and hissed at the boy. It lunged towards him, <br />
but the boy didn't even flinch. He snapped his fingers and the snake was gone, <br />
leaving you to drop a couple feet to the ground. You were sure this had to be a <br />
dream, but it certainly hurt like the real thing. <br />
<br />
The boy propped his cane against the wall and removed his gloves. He then <br />
walked towards you as you picked yourself up and extended his hand. You <br />
raise an eyebrow, but shake hands with the strange boy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings, mortal,&quot; he spoke in a mature voice unbefitting his young form. &quot;I <br />
see you've been taken into the world of dreams. And I'll bet a leprechaun's <br />
fortune you want an explanation.&quot;<br />
<br />
You meekly nod your head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, first off, let me introduce myself. I am Alp, Master of Dreams.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seem more like nightmares to me,&quot; you say. <br />
<br />
&quot;A nightmare is simply a dream with more power. But yes, this is a darker <br />
circumstance. It would appear that someone is interfering in my realm. <br />
Recently, my scarier dreams have been disobeying me. Someone has gained a <br />
power they should not have. I must find whoever this person is and put an end <br />
to it before someone gets truly hurt or even dies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But wait,&quot; you ask him, &quot;If this is a dream, how could someone die?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you feel pain when you fell?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Normally, you do not feel pain in a dream; dreams are just emotions playing <br />
out in your mind. Pain is a real thing and so are these nightmares. As it stands <br />
now, you are stuck in the dream realm and whatever happens to you here will <br />
happen to your body in the outside world.&quot;<br />
<br />
This information hits you hard; &quot;But, my family...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, your family will most likely find you tomorrow in a comatose state. They'll <br />
take you to a hospital where no doctor will be able to tell them what's wrong. <br />
That is why I would like to ask for your help. Since you are stuck here, you <br />
would be much more useful by helping me find whoever is doing this. And by <br />
staying with me you would be a great deal safer.&quot;<br />
<br />
You weakly agree and follow Alp to your bedroom door. But when he opens it, <br />
you are gazing out across a strange place. It appears to be a field, but the <br />
grass is black and the sky a dark red. Everything is in silhouette until you are <br />
right next to it. Then it turns out to not be what you thought it was. <br />
<br />
A tree becomes a massive spider web. The thing that made the web sits at its <br />
base, but does not attack you. It bows to Alp as he walks by, who tips his hat in <br />
salute. <br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you said the scary dreams didn't listen to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most don't. Some do. The scarier it is, the more likely it won't obey and vice <br />
versa. But it is mostly based on personal fears. Obviously, you hold no great <br />
fear for spiders, so it did not attack you. Believe me, there are more horrifying <br />
and dangerous things in this realm than giant spiders.&quot;<br />
<br />
You come to a stone wall. Alp jumps up on top and looks upward towards the <br />
red sky. <br />
<br />
&quot;That's normally blue. Red means things are out of order. I can feel the conflict <br />
growing between good and bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alp is quite for a long time. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aren't you worried about other people getting trapped here?&quot; you ask. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no, I have sent my most benevolent dreams across the realm to protect <br />
whoever dreams. I came to you specifically to recruit you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can sense in you great courage and cunning. Though you were afraid of that <br />
snake, you were not paralyzed with it. Those who can act self-consciously in <br />
dreams are those I need. I have recruited others as well. They are, even now, <br />
searching for the source of this chaos.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So how can I help you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, all I really need you to do is to go into other peoples' dreams and try to <br />
track the source of their nightmares. Unfortunately, this is easier said than <br />
done. When you enter another's dream, you adapt to that person's mind. I <br />
appear to you as a child in magician's garb because that is what your <br />
subconscious felt was appropriate. Although I must admit it is rather charming, <br />
which is why I haven't changed back to my true form now that we are in the true <br />
dream realm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Here, Alp jumped down and led you to another freestanding door in the middle <br />
of the field. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is your first assignment. Inside is another's dream. You must stop the <br />
nightmare from hurting them and then track it through the realm it flees to. Be <br />
prepared for anything to happen as you cross this threshold. Good luck and <br />
don't get killed. Wounds I can heal, but if you die you will remain here forever.&quot;</p>
