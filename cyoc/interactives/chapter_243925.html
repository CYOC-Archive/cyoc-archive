<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">     Robby boarded the bus after scanning his card, walking down the aisle he found an empty seat and sat down with his brother joining him. As they rode he brother was texting someone doing his best to hide his phone from Robby. Robby tried to see who Simon was texting but the older boy covered his phone and moved it revealing his crotch and a slightly obvious bulge in his pants “ bugger off” Robby leaned back and looked out the window at the gray skies it looked like rain.<br />
    The bus dropped them off across the street from a crowded school. Robby quickly spotted his friends and ran across the muddy soccer field not caring about getting messy as he ran to join them. “Hi!” He skidded to a stop, almost falling in a large muddy puddle near the soccer nets “ did you bring it?” One of his friends he suddenly remembered was named Hollis. “ Bring what?” Hollis looked at him “ you dork you said your dad had a girl magazine and you were going to bring it to school today” Robby smiled and slipped out of his backpack, unzipping it he rummaged around shoving crumpled up papers and crushed snack cakes aside “ here it is! <br />
    Keeping it hidden from the grownups he showed Hillis an outdated issue of a playboy magazine. “ I&#39;ve never seen a naked girl before. Is it true girls don&#39;t have a penis?” Robby nodded and zipped his backpack up” only boys have a penis girls here something called a gina or something my older brother told me I&#39;ll ask him later”. The boys played around shoving each other and trying to make the other boys muddy before the bell rang and they went to the classroom.<br />
     The school day went by smoothly. Robby was a star student acing the maths test with ease “ how do you understand that stuff?” Hollis asked him as they peed together sneakily, sharing the urine and making sure to fully expose their penises. They were about the same size and both boys were uncircumcised. Hollis gazed down at the urinal watching the twin streams “ our penises look alike! That&#39;s cool. Did you know that some boys don&#39;t have their foreskins? They were chopped off when they were born”. Shaking his penis off he waited for Robby to finish and shake his own penis. “ Can I put yours away? You can put mine back” The boys gently pushed each other&#39;s soft penises back into their underwear smiling and giggling” I love playing with it whenever I&#39;m in bed” “ me to” Hollis rubbed Robby&#39;s foreskin sliding it back before pulling his hand out “ thanks a lot” Robby adjusted his foreskin and the boys zipped up and washed their hands making their way out to the playground.<br />
     Finding a spot far from the prying eyes of the playground supervision they opened the magazine “ it&#39;s just words! I thought that it had pictures of naked girls” Robby was flipping through the pages “ I know it does Simone told me so.” Flipping quickly he gasped and stopped at a picture of a women wearing nothing but a small thong her breasts fully exposed “ wow her underwear is flat! Girls really don&#39;t have a penis!” Hollis was dumbstruck staring at the magazine, his mouth hanging open. “ Don&#39;t let any bugs in” Robby teasingly mocked while he looked at the magazine, “ are there more” Robby flipped to the next page and the boy&#39;s curiosity was rewarded with a completely nude woman posing for them hands covering her breasts and nothing between her legs” there&#39;s nothing! It&#39;s all flat” Robby nodded unable to look away from the woman Riley would have been soaking wet after looking at it but as far Robby his prepubescent penis didn&#39;t even twitch. “ What&#39;s this supposed to do to us?” Hollis question brought Robby back to the moment “ I know my brother says his penis gets bigger and hard when he looks at it he said I&#39;m a pervert for asking to see it I don&#39;t know why we&#39;re both boys why can&#39;t I see his penis I let him see mine” The boys continued to flip through the pages” what are you two doing!” The sharp voice of the playground supervisor started them but Robby was able to quickly hide the magazine. “ nothing Hollis answered too quickly condemning the boys immediately” the supervisor glared at them “ what&#39;s under your shirt take it out!”<br />
     Slowly reluctantly Robby pulled out the rolled up magazine and handed it over “ so mister do you think this material is appropriate for two young boys? I don&#39;t think so, I&#39;ll be taking this and consider it a warning if I find you two doing something like this again I will take you to the headmistress” gripping it like it was infected the supervisor left them. “ Well that sucks Simon&#39;s gonna be pissed” Hollis looked immensely relieved “ I&#39;m just happy she didn&#39;t decide to report us my parents get mad if I play with myself” Hollis giggled and playfully grabbed at the  boys crotch “ they probably wouldn&#39;t like knowing that you play with mine would they?” Hollis squirmed around and grabbed Robby crotch, they stood there giggling, each boy holding the other&#39;s soft penis through their pants” they definitely wouldn&#39;t like that. “ Robby looked into Hollis Hazel eyes and for the first time ever in his young life as a boy felt the same feelings as Riley had felt all those years ago at prom “ wanna sleep over tonight?” Hollis looked back a strange expression on his adorable young face” yeah! We can play games”. Releasing each other&#39;s penis they went back inside to finish the day.<br />
       Simon meet Robby after school “ ready to go squirt? I think I figured out your punishment and you&#39;re not gonna like it” The two brothers left together making their way to the bus stop. “What&#39;s my punishment gonna be?” Simon smirked “ you really wanna know?” Robby nodded “ well since you like acting like such a little pervert you might as well be one, from now on whenever it&#39;s just us you are not allowed to wear anything” Robby stared at him “ you mean I have to be naked all day?” Simon nodded” whenever mum and Dad aren&#39;t home you can start today” Robby sat quietly the rest of the ride home security looking forward to his punishment he couldn&#39;t wait to be naked.</p>
