<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I... I want to try something... something weird.” Ty admitted, gulping.<br />
<br />
“Please,” shrunken Eileen nodded her approval, a huge grin taking over her flushed cheeks, “do what you will, darling. Be as strange as you’d like. I’m fine.”<br />
<br />
“Even... even if... i-if... I... want to make you an animal?”<br />
<br />
Eileen’s brows visibly raised and her smile grew to startled but amused surprise. “An... animal, darling? You... you want to... to turn me into an animal?”<br />
<br />
“S-Something like that, sure...”<br />
<br />
“I can’t say no.” The woman grinned, again revelling in her total helplessness before the perverted teen-God who now desired to warp her into a little tabletop beast.<br />
<br />
“To a deer...” Ty whispered, vocalizing his whim for the first time.<br />
<br />
Eileen obeyed. She felt a startling tug inside of her body as organs began to change, bone began to gain and lose length, joints snapped, sinew reformed, muscle shrank and expanded, and her body began to transform. Unlike the sudden poof of her shrinking, this was drawn out and live.<br />
<br />
Eileen, already on all fours, could only shake and stand in horror as her human body began to warp. Her legs groaned, her hands began to stiffen. Already her toes were becoming cloven hooves, the big toe growing big and hard, the remaining four melding together and following suit. Fur began to sprout down her spine. Her ears began to grow. Her arms began to slim, her fingers began to merge. A tail puffed out above her ass, suddenly waggling in alarm. She crunched and let out a strange inhuman bleat as the merciless transformation overtook her. Her neck stretched, her torso shrank, her enormous breasts began to deflate as her nipples shrank flat and began to merge into blank skin.<br />
<br />
She shrank. She slimmed. Her hips snapped, her stance became quadrupedal. Her ankles crunched into an angle, new nipples began to grow down her belly. She rounded, she compressed. Her face began to tug out, her teeth crackled. Her skull reformed.<br />
<br />
A panting and overwhelmed deer, overloaded with sensation and confusion, staggered across her table and collapsed on the wood top with a light thud. A fully formed deer – a mulie native to Ty’s part of the country, and a form he knew well – laid on her side with her long back legs outstretched. She panted a long tongue from her muzzle and twitched her big black nose. As her vision returned, the former woman glanced down in alarm and saw her front legs stretched out in front of her. She flexed her hooves experimentally, stood in shaky new legs, and let out a bray of shock. She stood deathly still, wondering where the strange sound had come from, and simultaneously realized she had lost human speech and that the noise was her.<br />
<br />
She began shaking. She glanced back to her short slim body and the suggestion of her former round ass. She shook her plump hips and blinked several times, mouth agape, brown eyes wide and incredulous. She slowly glanced up and turned her attention to Ty, expression locked into complete and utter shock.<br />
<br />
“Um... you okay?”<br />
<br />
The deer blinked, nodded slowly and carefully, unable to communicate in any other fashion, and backed away gently, fresh new instincts screaming at her to run away from a predator thousands of times her size.<br />
<br />
She stood her ground, though, trying to make sense of all the new emotions, feelings, and senses. Her nose picking up the kitchen sink. Her ears sensing the vibration of the water heater downstairs. She felt immensely helpless and oddly curious at once.<br />
<br />
She bleated in shock, trying to ask why he had made her a deer, but she was entirely incapable of even attempting words.<br />
<br />
“A... a horse.” Ty whispered.<br />
<br />
Eileen the deer barely had time to come to grips with her brand new body before she was surging forth with size, muscle, and height. From a slim and compact woodland deer she positively ballooned into a sleek but well fed mare. Apparently, the magic had interpreted “a horse” to mean Mangalarga Marchador, the iconic Brazillian riding horse of her home country. Having barely adjusted to being a scaled down deer, she was even less accustomed to being a scaled down equine.<br />
<br />
The majestic and long nosed mare stumbled backward on her thick hooves and staggered with tiny clops across the surface of her own kitchen tabletop. The new linen Ty had made an hour or two ago could barely be felt under her hoof.<br />
<br />
This time, the boy let her adjust. Eileen managed to huff her great chest and felt her udder swaying beneath her. It was... considerable. As Eileen’s boobs had been considerable. The gorgeous white mare flicked her long dark mane out of her eyes, snapping her powerful neck back, and felt a surge of strength and confidence she couldn’t have imagined before. She steadied herself, stiffened her back, and inadvertently struck a strong and oddly sexy pose as she straightened her front legs and lowered her rump.<br />
<br />
She turned, getting used to being on all fours, and stared up at Ty. She whinnied a high pitched whinny, trying to ask him if she looked pretty this way, and stared back at her ample flank. Her ass looked better than ever! She recognized her pedigree immediately and felt a strange moment of patriotic pride for her home country. She... kind of liked it. She was quite a looker for a mare, confused as to why she now regarded herself as a damn sexy horse but well aware of her former humanity. More instinct, perhaps? Pride? Vanity? She couldn’t be sure.<br />
<br />
Ty stared in shock, reached for her, and pet her strong neck and big buff shoulders. She swayed appreciatively, loving the sensation of the giant human fingers tickling through her sensitive fur.<br />
<br />
“We’ll have to come back to this one later.”<br />
<br />
Eileen glanced up in shock and her eyes widened. What do you mean later? We’re not done?<br />
<br />
“A zebra.” Ty giggled.<br />
<br />
Eileen the Mangalarga went stiff as her gorgeously long legs lost height, her body and build compressed, and her mane suddenly shot up and stiffened to the top of her head. It was a jolt as very little drastic change warped her into a thick faced zebra. She glanced back at her gorgeous stripes and actually managed a smile of delight despite her thick rubbery lips. How strange! She flexed her more muscled legs, perfect for evading lions on an African Savannah, and felt an urge to get out a run with her non-existent herd. She ignored it, asserting control over this set of new instincts, and looked up at Ty with a side glance, amused and annoyed.<br />
<br />
“Does it hurt?” He asked, genuinely concerned.<br />
<br />
She shook her head no, hooting a little.<br />
<br />
“Then... a giraffe...”<br />
<br />
Eileen shot up. She gasped mid change and felt her lungs positively balloon inside her chest cavity, her growing heart thundering blood through her veins as she stretched and stretched like taffy. Her body thickened, her legs lengthened, her pattern changed, a long tail dangled over her increasingly dry pussy lips. This couldn’t even be described as weirdly enjoyable for her as bone and tissue stretched out and up. As the solid bones hardened under her head, the oddly long-maned giraffe felt a little woozy. She lowered her tremendously long neck level with her front shoulders and felt drunk. She staggered, smacking her lips, and what would have been a 14 inch tongue dangled lazily from her mouth.<br />
<br />
When she regained her composure, Eileen the giraffe raised to her full height, marvelling at how heavy and paradoxically graceful her new body felt. She couldn’t even make a grunt of protest anymore. She completely lacked vocal chords of any kind. She looked down at herself, startled at the long drop that was now her body, and circled the table slowly, nervously glancing at her long gangly limbs and noting that they seemed to sway in a perfect rhythmic unison. One side and then the other. It felt so strange but so natural.<br />
<br />
She... really liked this. She didn’t feel sexy persay, as she had as the horse, but oddly beautiful and unique. She looked up at Ty, who was staring down at her with equal amazement and marvel at her animal majesty, and they both shared a silent giggle.<br />
<br />
“Another one?”<br />
<br />
Eileen was starting to get into it. She nodded her long angular face with a smile on her thick rubbery lips. This was actually really neat! She had started the day as a woman. Now she was a giraffe. What else could she be?<br />
<br />
“A moose,” Ty whispered.<br />
<br />
Eileen let out a bellow as her voice returned, and felt a sick sense of falling as she shrank and lost her lank at the same time. In moments, a very startled lady moose fresh out of a Canadian postcard staggered and awkwardly bounced on the table, trying to get her footing. She managed it, getting her balance back, and let out a heavy but still heavily shrunken huff, turning to her side to let Ty inspect  her. She felt... bulky. Heavy. Powerful. More than the horse, she was thick and built like a tank. Yet oddly her legs felt undersized for her weight. Long and lanky and vulnerable. She had a momentary flash of being mounted by a big boy moose with a big black cock filling her to full, and licked her lips.<br />
<br />
The instincts were starting to run together. Deer, horse, zebra, giraffe, moose. They all had an underlying sense of wanting to eat, sleep, screw, and occasionally pop out kids. She huffed again, confused at her sexual urges, but not unwelcoming of them.<br />
<br />
“Something more drastic,” Ty began, smiling.<br />
<br />
The moose chuffed in alarm and glanced up, eyes wide again.<br />
<br />
“Flamingo!”<br />
<br />
The transition from female moose to female flamingo was even weirder. She felt her guts shift and shrink, new bits growing in that hadn’t existed before, and felt a dizzying shedding of her weight as she lightened and slimmed down. Her thick trunk legs vanishing into flexible arm like feathered wings was especially strange, as she honked in shock, halfway between big goofy moose and pink feathered bird. As her big nose shrank away and lost mass the sudden crackle of her face turning into a beak caught her offguard and genuinely left her a little sickened as she felt bone crunch inside of her shrinking head. She curved her neck into an S, finding it way more flexible than the big giraffe, and felt her sex organs suctioning up into a little discreet opening behind her feathered tail. Whatever arousal she had felt ebbed away as a little pink flamingo slapped her webbed feet on the tabletop, weird stick legs wobbling madly.<br />
<br />
“Wow.” Ty gasped. “That was amazing!”<br />
<br />
She shot him an indignant look and honked in annoyance, her flamingo attitude soaking in.<br />
<br />
“Well, it was amazing to watch!”<br />
<br />
She honked again and shrugged her shoulders, which in turn ruffled her folded wings. She felt an odd need to preen herself, tugging her neck back and rubbing the crooked angle of her beak across her back. She stood on one leg, blinking, becoming... more an animal. She shook her head in alarm and looked up at Ty in alarm.<br />
<br />
Wait, wait! She blinked several times. Her mannerisms and mind were becoming less human with each change. She realized it to her horror and began honking madly with concern, trying to explain the situation.<br />
<br />
“Huh?” Ty blinked. “What’s wrong?”<br />
<br />
I’m losing myself! She protested, feeling her bird instincts growing stronger, her human self losing a little prominence with this latest transformation. She began honking again and grimaced in annoyance. She pointed her wingtip out toward the other end of the table and the blank pad of paper sitting there. Ty gasped, nodded, and scrambled for a pen from the counter. He carefully grabbed the pad, set it down before the little flamingo, and offered her the pen.<br />
<br />
She looked up, annoyed, and held out her wings.<br />
<br />
“Oh. No hands. Duh.” He thought of something that had hands and smiled.<br />
<br />
“A...”<br />
<br />
No! NO! Eileen gasped and held up her wings and waved them frantically in an approximation of stop.</p>
