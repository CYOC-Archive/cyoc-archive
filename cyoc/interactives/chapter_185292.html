<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>- Luma Lerouge, Level 69 femme herm Kitsune Wizard (23)/Sorceress (10)/Courtesan (36)<br/>
<br/>
I noticed that in the course of the chapter I assigned Paul/Ancalion as having started the Game as a male human warrior; I explain the class change but not how he became an Elf. I don&#39;t remember now what my intentions were for this, or even if calling him human was an error to begin with. Anyway, I&#39;m leaving the TG tag on this, although I don&#39;t go into detail on his former existence as a girl.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The time for resistance had long passed. This time, Ty&#39;s penchant to wait and see had bit her in her round, fluffy butt. She was a slave, and was going to become a concubine to this Madame Lerouge. A sex slave, a mere plaything in this brothel.<br />
<br />
<i>But... I don&#39;t...</i> Blinking against tears of frustration and helplessness, she looked up at the Elf. He seemed surprisingly kind -- much different from the bandits who had delivered her. Maybe he would listen...?<br />
<br />
&quot;Please,&quot; she whispered. &quot;L-let me go? I... I&#39;m not really a kitsune girl, I&#39;m a... a man from another world, and I-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shhhhh.&quot; The Elf raised his hand from her waist to put a finger to his lips, pausing at the base of the few steps that led up to the porch. He looked down at her, not unkindly. &quot;Many enter this world from another. I did myself, long ago. But there is no going back, and no sense disturbing those born here.&quot; He set his hand on her back, gently stroking down her hair and fur, and she involuntarily leaned into his side.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right. Come, and let the Mistress dispel your concerns.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty&#39;s stomach knotted, but she offered no more resistance as the guards opened the doors ahead of them. Inside, was an entry hall, the floor laid out in lavender tiles with silver between them; the walls continued a shell-like pink. Soft yellow tapestries bearing a red lamp-in-heart symbol flanked a large, pointed arch that opened into a central rotunda beneath the great dome. Several smaller arches opened off to the sides, and it was through one of these that Ancalion ushered the two slave girls.<br />
<br />
Inside the room was divided into four squares of dark purple, each a step lower than the main floor. Inside each square a six-pointed star of light lay, encircling by rotating rings of runes inside glowing borders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, sisters,&quot; the Elf said to the guards. &quot;You can go back to your rounds now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sisters?&quot; wondered Ty as the guards bowed and left. The Elf nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. We are all one family under our Mistress. While you, sweet vixen, will have the greatest honour -- devoted <i>entirely</i> to her pleasure and those guests rich enough to share in her harem -- we <i>all</i> are hers to fuck and use as she sees fit.&quot; He sighed dreamily. Ty stared at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;How -- how can you live like that? You said you too were from another world-&quot;<br />
<br />
He chuckled and shook his head. &quot;I imagine you&#39;re from Earth, a player of the Game of Change? So was I. I was a girl in college, finally convinced to try tabletop RPG by my roommate. I chose a male human warrior. Soon after I arrived I found robes that changed my class into a wizard -- quite a powerful one, or so I thought. My party joined an attempt to &#39;liberate&#39; Mistress&#39; slaves. Ah, the folly!<br />
<br />
As I found out, none of them wanted to be freed. Still, we managed to fight past the guards... and then Mistress herself came out. She easily vanquished my friends; I held out a little while with my magic. I was foolish enough to think I matched her. But she -- she defeated me. She <i>came</i> on me, filling me with such desire as I had never felt before, and then she took me, my virgin shaft in her pussy, and I willingly fucked her out there in the courtyard as her slaves cheered.&quot;<br />
<br />
He ended with another fond sigh, rubbing at the bulge beneath his robe. On the other side of him Steph gasped. Peeking around the wizard, Ty saw that her friend was once again masturbating to the story.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gods that&#39;s hot!&quot; Steph blurted. &quot;I want to hear more about it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Later, my sweet. The Mistress waits.&quot;<br />
<br />
So saying, he guided them onto the stars. The runes lit up, and Ty closed her eyes against a bright white flash.<br />
<br />
When she opened them, she was in a different room. Here the walls were warm brown, hung with red velvet drapes and lit by low red lamps. A single curtain-hung door led out into a hallway, where a stained glass window depicted a feral fox looking down at them. Gently Ancalion pushed the girls on along a gold-edged red carpet, and soon they were at another, somewhat smaller pair of double doors, these embossed with a single golden flame-in-heart, supported by foxes.<br />
<br />
&quot;What race do you think Mistress Lerouge is?&quot; giggled Steph.<br />
<br />
&quot;&#39;Mistress!?&#39;&quot; Ty&#39;s fur stood on end, angry and afraid that her friend had already accepted this fate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shhh,&quot; repeated Ancalion. Then he lifted his hand. &quot;Mistress Luma, the new girls are here that you ordered from the Master of Slaves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Enter,&quot; replied a rich, feminine voice. A crack appeared down the centre of the flame emblem, and the doors swung inward.<br />
<br />
Inside a lavish chamber was revealed: the throne room of a queen of pleasure. Red columns fluted with gold upheld a vaulted ceiling; painted statues of entwined lovers stood in the corners. Erotic tapestries alternated with banners displaying the lamp or naked flame.<br />
<br />
But their eyes were drawn up the sweep of carpet to the far wall, topless human slave girls knelt on cushions to either side of a wide dais. Upon the dais was a couch of red silk, flanked by braziers from which rose clouds of alluring incense; and stretched across the couch...<br />
<br />
A breath-takingly voluptuous kitsune female. Save for a strand of gold supporting a polished jet locket between her breasts, and a golden fillet wound between her auburn tresses, she was starkly and proudly naked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome, my slaves,&quot; she greeted in the same dark, rich tone. Ty shivered, her arousal spiking just from hearing her voice.<br />
<br />
The vixen threw her legs over the side of the couch and rose to her feet with amazing speed, considering how languid she had looked. Behind her what Ty had at first thought to be furs draped over the couch slithered off, revealed as nine luxuriant tails flicking behind her.<br />
<br />
As she walked down the steps towards them, Ty marveled at her body. She was six feet and a half tall (not counted her perked ears), taller even than the Elf. Her breasts were large, F-cup at least, though they fit her regal frame well; her hips matching.<br />
<br />
Her coat shone in the fire of the braziers: her back, limbs and tails were fiery red-orange; black on her forearms, lower legs, and lining the borders of the orange; white on her breasts, stomach and the tails of her tails. Cream-yellow covered her chin, throat and upper chest, narrowing to a line that disappeared in her cleavage. Then the yellow appeared again, splitting around her toned stomach, to join over her lower abdomen and cover her loins.<br />
<br />
Her... loins... Ty gulped, beginning to pant with need as she noticed that this vixen&#39;s crotch was taken up by a sheath over hefty balls swinging with her seductive walk. A hint of deep red peeked from the opening of the sheath, and as Ty watched -- <i>Oh gods...</i> -- it grew into a pointed tip, followed by a thickening shaft, and finally two nascent bulbs. The male equipment was not large compared to her over-all build, but it was still very impressive.<br />
<br />
Ty tried to hold back, fearful of what that mesmerising organ would do to her, but Ancalion&#39;s gentle pressure kept her walking forward. Then, about halfway through the room, the Elf went down to his knees. Steph did likewise; but Ty remained standing, though her legs trembled, and the Elf did not force her.<br />
<br />
The vixen came within a yard of them and stopped, towering over them. This was Luma Lerouge, Madame and Mistress of the Pleasure Palace, and Ty shrank back from her presence. Oh how she longed to join her friend on her knees -- to bury her muzzle in that tantalising sac! But still the lesser kitsune maintained her upright posture, trying to look defiant.<br />
<br />
Luma grinned knowingly at Ty, then bent down to pet Ancalion&#39;s head. &quot;Thank you, Paul,&quot; she said. Ty stared.<br />
<br />
&quot;P-Paul?&quot; Immediately she put her hand over her mouth. Luma glanced back at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;His Earth name. Well, it used to be Paula; but that&#39;s no longer appropriate, is it, my slave?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Mistress,&quot; he replied, his voice adoring.<br />
<br />
Luma straightened back up. &quot;Yes, I know all about this &#39;game,&#39;&quot; she said in response to Ty&#39;s expression. &quot;Far more than you. But before I tell you the true rules, or how I came to be what I am; you must accept me as your mistress. First, tell me your names.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stephanie, Mistress!&quot; Steph supplied eagerly. &quot;My friends call me &#39;Steph,&#39; b-but you can call me whatever, just fuck me already!&quot;<br />
<br />
A musical laugh spilled from Luma&#39;s full lips. &quot;So impatient! I see that those bandits followed my orders and let the two of you stew. It must be hard for one of succubus blood to go so long without sex. But later.&quot; She shifted her eyes to Ty.<br />
<br />
Ty tried to back away. But with a step Luma closed the distance and, lifting a hand, she put a claw under her chin. Ty halted at the touch, her voice catching, and she let the larger vixen tilt her head up to meet her gaze.<br />
<br />
&quot;And <i>you,</i> vixen? Tell me your name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;T-T-Tuh... Ty...&quot; She was trying to say &quot;Tyler,&quot; her old name, but it just wouldn&#39;t come. At some point, she had accepted her sex change. And now, staring into the luminous amber eyes of Mistress Luma, she could no longer think of herself as ever having <i>been</i> male. Her real past seemed vague and dream-like; her training as a kitsune whore real and present. And from that training an altered form of her name rose.<br />
<br />
&quot;T-Tyana.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tyana. A pretty name for a very beautiful girl.&quot; Luma&#39;s eyes began to literally glow, and Ty felt a strange brush on her mind, dangerous and intoxicating -- Luma&#39;s presence. She wanted to look away, but she couldn&#39;t break her eyes from Luma&#39;s captivating stare.<br />
<br />
&quot;A beautiful, foxy slut. Who once was a human boy... who became an Elfmaid ranger... a frog girl... Rescued your friends, defeated that pretentious witch... but caught by the Master of Slaves. Mmmmhmhm... oh my dear.&quot; She scratched Ty&#39;s chin. &quot;I see what you&#39;ve done. It seems I have <i>you</i> to thank for preparing my tiefling whore for me. But you -- you&#39;ve consistently abstained from sex throughout your adventure.&quot;<br />
<br />
She shook her head slightly, not enough to break eye contact. &quot;Shame on you for forcing your friend to do what you would not! But that will change now. Whatever your motives for your silly chastity, I will teach you better. I will show you where a slutty whore like you belongs. On her knees; on her back; on her face, tits smashed to the ground while she&#39;s bred like a bitch.&quot; <br />
<br />
The larger vixen leaned in and licked Ty&#39;s nose. &quot;Oh yes, I will show you, Tyana.&quot;<br />
<br />
So close, Luma&#39;s scent filled Ty&#39;s nostrils -- the erstwhile ranger huffing it in as she hyperventilated. A dominant male -- and female, too. She must have a pussy hidden behind that ballsack. Ty opened her mouth, ready to beg, to plead for the Mistress to fill her and finally douse the heat... when Luma drew back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Asphodel!&quot; she commanded. &quot;Bring the collars.&quot; Then to them she continued, &quot;Let me tell you why I ordered you. Tiefling, your role is to perform for my guests and fellow slaves alike, enflaming their lusts and isnpiring their performance; but most importantly, you will serve in my harem to entertain my concubines. Hence why I wanted you to already have a bond with the newest.&quot;<br />
<br />
She leered at Tyana, one of her tails coming around to caress the side of Ty&#39;s muzzle. &quot;You, of course, will be that concubine. I have specific taste in my bed slaves; I want other foxes, beautiful, cunning, and strong-willed. You are absolutely <i>perfect</i> -- or will be, once I tame that will to my own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The collars, Mistress.&quot; One of the human girls had come up, and now bowing she presented two more gem-studded collars to Luma. The vixen took them, then held them out. In her left she offered one with a bronze medallion to Steph; in her right, offered to Ty, was one with a gold medallion.<br />
<br />
Ty stared, eyes wide and dilating with fear, as Luma continued. &quot;These collars are imbued with a powerful enchantment that will chain your desires to mine, worshipping me as your Mistress -- your <i>goddess</i> -- as long as you wear them. However, I will only put them on you once you ask for them. If I were to force you, you might resist, now or in the future; but do it willingly... and you get no &#39;saving throw.&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Besides...&quot; She smirked. &quot;It turns me on to know that you former &#39;adventurers&#39; wanted me so badly that you <i>chose</i> to give up your free will to me.&quot;</p>
<hr/><h3>
What will the two girls decide to do?</h3>
