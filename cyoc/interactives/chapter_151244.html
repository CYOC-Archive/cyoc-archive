<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had been less than ten minutes and already Oscar was completely out of his clothes, covered in sweat, lying back on the couch with his sexy tan gleaming in the soft candle lighting. The girls were stroking his body while he moaned in pleasure. He tried to fondle them back several times but they would just grope another one of his (secretly magically enhanced) erogenous zones to paralyze him in sexual ecstasy. Before he knew it, he was hanging off the couch and then just totally lying on the floor, writhing and moaning under their manipulations.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is what bitches are for,&quot; he thought inside in his lusty, chauvinistic, egotistical mind. &quot;Just to serve my body all night long. They don&#39;t even wanna be served.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan would have giggled if he still had his human voice. It was comical to watch this hefty 18-year old muscle mound just melt back on the floor with his tongue lolling out while they rubbed his belly a dog. Poor thing, he had no awareness of the changes they were making to his body. For one thing, he had been thinning out during the entire massage. He had gone from looking like a body builder to looking anorexic. It was eerily unnatural: no part of his body looked like it could be much thicker than the bones inside there. That had been just the start however.<br />
<br />
Oscar woke up from his stupor when he felt himself thumping the carpet with something that wasn&#39;t an arm or a leg.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; he asked, lifting himself up a little bit on his pencil-thin elbows.<br />
<br />
&quot;What, you mean this?&quot; said Kat, picking up his pencil-thin tail in one hand and waving it slightly in front of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck?!&quot; he said, reaching out to grab it for himself. That&#39;s when he noticed how thin his arm was.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do to me?!&quot; he demanded, grabbing his right arm with his left arm while his right arm gripped his tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not just those things,&quot; said Selena in a sexy innocent voice. Dan had already noticed Oscar&#39;s manhood becoming more like his own, a hard pointed prick poking out from a fleshy pocket on his groin. &quot;Take a look at this,&quot; she said, tugging the sheath down with her finger making Oscar flinch when his knot came out for the first time. Before he could even swear again, she grabbed it and made Oscar howl.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve been a bad boy,&quot; said Selena. &quot;You&#39;re still in for a few more adjustments.&quot;<br />
<br />
Selena let go and Oscar rolled over onto his side and tried to make a break for it, but he stopped when Kat grabbed and held onto his new tail. The surprise pain sent him back down onto the floor with a yelp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where do you think you&#39;re going?&quot; said Kat. &quot;The foreplay is just getting started.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oscar looked down at his arms sprawled out in front him. His hands were getting even thinner... and longer. The fingers were shrinking but his nails were thickening out into a hook shape. &quot;Claws&quot; he realized. Kat finally let go because Oscar wasn&#39;t going anywhere. He was too dazed now watching his lower face stretch out in front of him to form into a thin pointed muzzle. His nose turned velvety black at the end of it, and he could smell everything in the room: Dan, the girls, his own sex. A paper-thin layer of steel-gray fur came up all over him and his other hair just vanished. His ears stretched up and flopped over, and it was all done.<br />
<br />
&quot;There you go, Selena, a new greyhound sire for Starlight,&quot; Kat announced. &quot;Now you can have some purebred puppies.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan felt that he should have been more sympathetic for Oscar, but of course sympathy had never been his strong point as a human, and it wasn&#39;t now either. Seeing someone else get the change this time wasn&#39;t so bad, and it was sure better than facing Kat&#39;s wrath himself. Something seemed wrong, though: Oscar was sitting and panting with a surprisingly relaxed and blank look on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;So he&#39;s become entirely a dog even mentally, Kat?&quot; Selena asked in a clarifying tone of voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes he is,&quot; answered Kat, &quot;not even a slimmer of human awareness ... at the moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat and Selena led what was left of Oscar out the back door, where Starlight was instantly put into heat by another spell, then they came back inside and left the greyhounds to their business, watching their interactions through the kitchen window. The new dog fucked his bitch mindlessly while they watched. Kat snapped her fingers, and Oscar&#39;s mind came back just in time to notice that he was pumping his juices into an animal and that his new penis wouldn&#39;t let him leave until he was completely finished. He howled in physical euphoria and emotional agony. Kat and Selena laughed and cackled from the kitchen.<br />
<br />
The smell of all of this human and canine sex, including the sudden heat from Starlight out back, was the last straw for Dan, who couldn&#39;t take it any more and finally gave into some instincts of his own. Kat came back in and found her former brother humping her best friend&#39;s couch, when of course she swatted him with the newspaper again and said &quot;Bad dog!&quot; He circled around and lay down on the floor, trying to cool himself down.</p>
