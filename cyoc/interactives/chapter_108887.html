<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marco seemed on the verge of handing the Chronivac over when he suddenly grit his teeth and pulled the device close to his chest, staring defiantly at his shocked seven-year-old of a father.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s always about what <i>you</i> want,&quot; Marco spat. &quot;Now I&#39;m gonna do what <i>I</i> want.&quot;<br />
<br />
He started jabbing at the Chronivac with fervent determination, James allowing himself one more moment of heartbroken disbelief before he dug his teeth into his lip and charged at his son. His attack, however, was cut short when Paul suddenly jumped in front of Marco and ran interference for his friend, pulling James into an impromptu wrestling match that he quickly took control of. Spurred into action, Jacob toddled furiously over to Paul and wrapped himself around the boy&#39;s leg, the baby&#39;s weight throwing him off balance and bringing the wrestling match to a standstill. Rick hit the scene a moment later and wrapped himself around Paul&#39;s other leg, the trio bringing the boy to the verge of defeat - only to have victory snatched away from them at the last moment when Paul starting growing at an astonishing pace.<br />
<br />
His strength multiplying exponentially, Paul easily shook off the babies and shoved James to the ground as he sprung up into his adolescence, a fascinated grin on his lips as he looked down at himself, watching hair spring up and muscles grow, watching the floor pull further and further away from him. The horrified trio looked past him to see that Marco was going through a similarly drastic growth spurt, the innocent adorability of his seven-year-old self long gone as he hit his teenage years and kept aging. Their jaws sharpened while their hair darkened and shifted into more mature styles. Freckles and stubborn patches of baby fat disappeared. The gawkiness of teendom quickly gave way to confident, masculine frames, young and lithe and coiled with lean muscle. And throughout the whole process Marco and Paul&#39;s pajamas shifted and morphed and grew right along with their aging bodies, their fuzzy two-piece pajamas turning into jeans and stylish graphic tee-shirts befitting two guys in their mid-twenties.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa.&quot; Marco laughed at the depth of his voice, holding a hand to his throat as he tested it out. &quot;I&#39;m Marco and I&#39;m twenty-seven!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Duuuuuude.&quot; Paul beamed. &quot;This is the BEST. Look how tall we are! I feel superhero strong!&quot;<br />
<br />
The trio could do nothing but look on, awestruck, as the two former second-graders admired their new grown-up bodies. Though all three had good reason to be upset, James was clearly the most distraught - in looking at the expression on his cute young face, one might think that he had just missed the rest of his son&#39;s childhood.<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t this cool, dad?&quot; Marco grinned, finally deigning to address his shrunken father. &quot;I&#39;m as big as you were! Maybe even bigger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Marco...I...&quot; James trembled as he stared up at his son, who now dwarfed his immature little self. &quot;Don&#39;t...please, don&#39;t...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re still trying to tell me what to do?&quot; Marco&#39;s grin disappeared. &quot;You&#39;re always telling me what to do. Even when it&#39;s stupid. And then <i>I</i> get punished when I don&#39;t do it! Well - let&#39;s see how <i>you</i> like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marco stormed at his dad, the boy barely getting a chance to shout in protest before his grown-up son ripped the tent-like shirt from his immature frame. Though his hands immediately shot downwards, he wasn&#39;t quick enough to keep Marco and Paul from getting a glimpse at the wiggly little worm dangling innocently between his legs. James sniffled and blushed crimson as he tried to plead with words that just wouldn&#39;t come, unable to do anything but squeal in dismay when Marco grabbed his skinny wrist and dragged him to the couch. In a flash James was spread over his lap, naked little body pressed down with one hand, the boy barely having the time to process the bottomless indignity of his situation before Marco brought down his big adult hand and smacked James on his round, smooth little tush.<br />
<br />
<b>WHACK!</b><br />
<br />
The sound of the spank reverberated throughout the room as Paul, Rick and Jacob looked on with wide eyes and open mouths. James, for his part, looked so shocked that he didn&#39;t even cry or shout - at least, not until the second, third, and fourth smack.<br />
<br />
<b>WHACK! WHACK! WHACK!</b><br />
<br />
Thoroughly snapped out of his trance, James squealed and kicked as his son mercilessly spanked him, his little bottom already glowing red and tingling with pins-and-needles numbness. Marco&#39;s lips were twisted in a vindictive grin as James sobbed and squirmed beneath him, tears running down his shrunken father&#39;s chubby and fiery cheeks, snot dribbling into his wailing mouth. Unable to take it any longer, Rick and Jacob charged (well, waddled) at the couch - only to be suddenly scooped up by Paul, who took a seat beside Marco and then stretched the shouting, wiggling babies across <i>his</i> knees. Jacob and Rick looked at each other in horrified disbelief - horrified that they were small enough to fit on Paul&#39;s lap at once, horrified at what was happening to James, horrified that they were about to suffer the same fate.<br />
<br />
<b>PAFF! PAFF! PAFF! PAFF! PAFF! PAFF!</b><br />
<br />
Paul alternated between whapping the babies&#39; thickly-diapered bottoms, the cushioned sound of palm hitting padding acting almost as a backbeat to the sharper <b>WHACK!</b> of James&#39; spanks. Though the protection kept either toddler from being hurt much, what little pain they did feel - combined with the horrible helplessness of the whole situation - got them both bawling at once, their cries joining James&#39; as the three former adults were made to feel like very naughty little boys.<br />
<br />
Things finally came to an end when Marco set James on his bare little feet, followed by Paul putting the babies down on their diapered tushies. The well-spanked boy sobbed and rubbed his glowing bottom as he hopped on his toes, momentarily indifferent to the humiliation of his tiny weenie bouncing freely between his hairless thighs. Jacob and Rick immediately jammed their thumbs in their mouths and started to suck, snuggling up close to each other for whatever comfort they could find. Marco and Paul stood above their distraught victims and smirked down at them, forcing them to soak in the moment until...</p>
