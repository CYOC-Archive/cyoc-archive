<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Steve agreed to take a look around to see if he could find his parents. How hard could it be as he took a look around to see that the whole bar appeared full of lesbians. But before he could start walking around Liz asked him if he would like a drink while he looked for his parents.<br />
<br />
“I’ll take a water” he responded and Liz quickly gave him a glass.<br />
<br />
Diane turned and said to Liz “If he is drinking water can I get a cocktail now that he has made himself the designated driver” <br />
<br />
Liz was happy to get that drink started. Steve walked off after finishing his glass.<br />
<br />
As he walked around he noticed lesbian couple after lesbian couple in the booths. Some were just talking others were in the middle of passionate making out. He had to quickly turn away from one couple as his penis went hard in his pants.<br />
<br />
As he walked past one of the tables he noticed Olivia who was a fellow student in one of his classes at college. He stopped to say hi and she was rather surprised to see him there. <br />
<br />
“What are you doing here Steve?” She asked<br />
“I am looking for my parents, they called my sister and I saying they were here and we haven’t seen to find them yet” he replied pointing over to his Sister at the bar. Though when he looked over to where she was he noticed she was was talking to another lady at the bar and that she looked like she was holding her hand which he thought was odd but quickly brushed aside.<br />
<br />
They talked for a little bit, Steve had always liked talking to Olivia, and had even tried to ask her out on a date once but she had turned him down saying she was a lesbian. <br />
<br />
All of a sudden he felt a sharp pain in his stomach like he was going to be sick and quickly ran off to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Olivia followed behind as she noticed that Steve’s hair started to change color knowing the magic that was going to start hitting him.<br />
<br />
As Steve moved to the bathroom he noticed some hair get in his field of view which he quickly pushed out of the way. Every step in agony and they he started to feel off balance as he walked like he was getting shorter. He could not see his that from his 6’2” height he had started to shrink down.<br />
<br />
Making it into the bathroom he noticed something weird as he passed the mirror his hair… it looked longer and looked red instead of his brown, the face looked female. As he stared at the face staring back Olivia came into the bathroom as well. <br />
<br />
“what is happening to me???” Steve asked <br />
“What do you think is happening?” Replied Olivia<br />
“I look like a woman!!!” He shot back.<br />
“It’s okay” replied Olivia and as she said that she gave him another cup of water as he drank it he started to calm down even his the weird changes occurring.<br />
<br />
Looking in the mirror Steve’s clothes started to look big on his frame as his body started to shrink faster and faster<br />
“Steve you should take your clothes off” Olivia said and started to help him remove them.<br />
<br />
Steve thought it was strange but he did as she said. As he took them off he noticed breasts starting to form on his chest and that he had lost all of his body hair. His legs were smooth and his feet were getting smaller.<br />
<br />
His once pride and joy his penis still looked erect but was getting smaller and smaller. His face no longer looked male now resembling closer to his sister or mothers.<br />
<br />
He reached down to try and touch his penis as it pulled inside and instead was replaced by a vagina. He touched it and it shocked him. He looked down as he rubbed it and noticed his breasts now looked fully formed. They looked big as he ran his hands along them compared to what he had before. Forgetting Olivia was there he got lost in touching his new vagina and its folds and his breasts. <br />
<br />
When all of a sudden the door to the restroom opened and he heard a voice call out saying “Hey Steve it’s Diane, are you okay?? I saw you rush in here followed by that girl from school that you liked…..” as she rounded the corner surprised to see her brothers clothes on the floor and a naked woman trying to cover herself as another woman stood there smiling on.<br />
<br />
“Diane!!! It’s me!! It’s Steve, I don’t know what happened” hearing his new voice surprised Steve but he liked the way it sounded.<br />
“This can’t be real” said Diane feeling for some reason turned on looking at the woman claiming to be his brother standing in front of her she never thought she was into girls but seeing the naked form in front of her she was blown away.<br />
<br />
With all their surprise they didn’t hear the door open one more time and were surprised to see Liz standing there. “Stephanie and Diane let me take you to your parents. Also Stephanie let’s get you some clothes.” Liz picked up the clothes that had once belong to Steve and as she did they seemed to change, a pink bra and matching panties formed from the his underwear and a nice floral dress formed from rest of the clothes with the shoes becoming a nice pair of flats. <br />
<br />
Stephanie put them on and they headed out of the bathroom but before they left Olivia pulled Stephanie in close and gave her a kiss on the lips, Stephanie was over excited and she felt a warmth in her new pussy. <br />
<br />
They excited the bathroom to find that Liz was talking to there Mom and another woman who they have never seen before. As they approached Liz said to Diane and Stephanie, “Here are your Mothers”</p>
