<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff wondered which of mom’s body part he would be.  There were a lot of choices, from her ass to her vagina, breasts to stomach, arms to legs, hands to feet, pretty much any piece of the body he could think of.  There’s too much to think of at the top of his head.  Head…  Head.<br />
<br />
“That’s it!” he said in an excited voice.<br />
<br />
Of all the pieces of her mother’s body, the head seems like the best choice.  If he becomes his mom’s head, he can control her body, feel every aspect of her body, even masturbate with her body.  His teenage hormones are already ramping up after thinking about that.  Course, by becoming the head, there is going to be the issue of the mentality.  If it’s his mind in the mother’s body, the rest of the family would be suspicious.  But if it were her mom’s mind in the body, it would be even more of an issue.  So thinking about it, he would split the mentality half and half, with the knowledge and memories of both him and his mother in the same body.  Seems like a fair thing to think about.  So thinking about it, he decided to go for her mom’s head.  Going for the Chornivac, he started to put his information, what body part and who’s mentality, transformation time, and duration.  Finishing it up, he looked to the info and reviewed it.  Here’s what the information says…<br />
<br />
Who is being transformed?: Jeff Rogers<br />
What are they being transformed into?: Head<br />
Who’s part(s) are they being transformed into?: Olivia Rogers<br />
When will the transformation occur?: Before she leaves for the spa. <br />
What senses does the transformee want to keep?: Hearing, Sight, Smell, Taste, Touch<br />
How long will the transformee be transformed?: 8 Hours<br />
Will the entity the transformee is becoming a part of know that they are there?: Yes<br />
Do others recognize the transformee?: Not going to disclose<br />
Does the transformee retain any parts from their previous body?: No<br />
Can the transformee control any part of their new body?: Yes<br />
How will the change occur? (Be specific):<br />
<br />
Jeff looked at that one and wrote down how the changes will happen.  What he wrote goes as shown…<br />
<br />
‘The changes will start when Olivia leaves for the spa.  But when she’s about to leave, she immediately stops and turns around to head to Jeff’s room in a trance.  As she heads up the room, her head will decompress as all her features vanish, up until she’s a headless body walking to Jeff’s room.  Around the time her changes starts, Jeff’s body will begin to shrink and deteriorate from the feet to the shoulders, until Jeff’s just a living head.  When Olivia entered Jeff’s room, she will take his head and attach it to her body, merging it to one.  Then Jeff’s head will morph and shift until it resembles his mother’s.  Jeff will also obtained the memories of his mother while Jeff’s memories remain intact.  But Jeff will have full control the body and will do anything he wants with it.  When the eight hours his up, there will be a flash and both Jeff and Olivia will be back.’<br />
<br />
Writing all this information down, he reviewed it and realizes that it was perfect.  He will have full control of his mom when he becomes her head while obtaining both his and her memories.  The eight-hour part works as well as he can have all the time in experiencing every part of her body.  Just as long as the rest of the family doesn’t know that anything that happened.  He’s anticipating this moment for so long as he hit on the enter button.  But before the changes can start, a pop up appeared and gave him a warning.  It says…<br />
<br />
‘Warning!<br />
<br />
By beginning the change, you must be aware of the consequences.  If the body is injured or dies, the changes will be permanent and you will not return to your previous body.  Are you sure you want to do that?’<br />
<br />
Below that message is a ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ option, wanting you to choose.  Jeff knew his answer and didn’t want to sugar coat it a lot.  Which is why he would risk it all to be mom’s head for eight straight hours.  Who knows, he will alternate to permanent and be his own mother period.  He just need to alter reality to make sure no one knows what happened to Jeff.  But for now, just eight hours will suffice.  With eager anticipation, he clicked on the yes option and a new window appeared that says…<br />
<br />
‘Transform JEFF ROGERS into OLIVIA ROGERS’s head.  Thank you for choosing the Chronivac.  Enjoy the change.”<br />
<br />
At the same time, Olivia was already set to get to the spa for some relaxation.  She had a busy week and a little messaging can calm the nerves.  Picking up her pocket book, she checked to make sure she has everything.<br />
<br />
“Let’s see…  Keys, wallet, license, make up…  Yeah, that’s everything.” She said with glee, “I’ve been working hard all day, a little R&R would be what I wanted.”<br />
<br />
She soon approached the door and was eager to leave.<br />
<br />
“It’s a shame that I have to leave Jeff on his own.  What with his father at work, his older brother in college, and his little sister hanging out in her friend’s house, it hard to for him to live alone.  If I were to take him with me, then maybe he won’t be so lonely.  But he’s a teenager and he’s going through hormones and all.”<br />
<br />
She was already at the door and was about to touch the knob.<br />
<br />
“Maybe next time I would invite him when he got nothing to do.  Got to be a better mother in-“<br />
<br />
Just as she was about to finish and open the door, she immediately stops and froze like a statue.  Her eyes were completely blanked, as there was no soul in them.  It was at that time the Chronivac started to make the changes and the program hit both the mother and son at the same time.  When it did, Olivia dropped her purse and turned around, walking like a robot and approaching her son’s room.  When she did that, it’s when the changes take place.<br />
<br />
It started with her long, brown, wavy hair as it slowly shrank when she was heading to the stairs.  Starting from her lower back, it shrank to the middle, then the upper, then brushing up her shoulders.  Going up her neck, her wavy style deteriorates and was restyled into a boy but on her head.  But that didn’t stop there as it continued to shrink more and more, letting the follicles suck up in the skin.  Soon enough, Olivia was completely bald, devoid of any hair was so ever.  But she didn’t realize it as her mind was in a haze and her eyes were completely in a trance.  She soon started to head up the steps, getting to the second floor where Jeff was waiting.  That’s when the next change begins.<br />
<br />
As she slowly walked up the steps, her head slowly melted down her neck, growing smaller and thinner.  At the same time, parts of her head were slowly absorbing into her face.  Her ears shrank away and absorbed into her head followed by the holes sealing themselves up, leaving her completely deaf.  Her nose assimilate her face as the two dots along with them popped out, making it impossible to breathe.  Her lips slowly flatten and the color of her lipstick faded away.  That’s when her mouth acted like a zipper and sealed up to the middle.  The last were her eyes as they slowly closed and sealed, with her lashed and eyebrows sink into her skin.  Pretty soon, her head was completely featureless as it’s halfway small when she reached the top of the stairs.<br />
<br />
By the time she got up, she turned and headed straight to Jeff’s room.  As she was doing that, her head kept growing smaller and thinner.  Soon enough, the head melt right into the neck and then the neck itself shrank down to the shoulders.  Pretty soon, Olivia is now just a headless body walking to Jeff’s room.  And even though she doesn’t have a brain, her body was automatically walked to her destination.  Pretty soon, she made it to the door of Jeff’s room and turned the knob, opening the door.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, minutes before, Jeff hit the start button as the message appeared in front of him.<br />
<br />
‘Transform JEFF ROGERS into OLIVIA ROGERS’s head.  Thank you for choosing the Chronivac.  Enjoy the change.’<br />
<br />
As he read it, he felt his body tingling, as he knew his changes were starting.<br />
<br />
“Feels like I’m starting to change too.” He said, feeling excited over controlling his mother’s body with his head attached to her.<br />
<br />
As he waited, he felt his shoes feeling a little roomy.  Looking down, something didn’t feel fight.  Lifting one leg up, he soon took off his sneaker and noticed his sock was a little floppy.  Curious, he removed his sock and discovered something that shocked him.  What he saw was his own foot looked half it’s size and steadily getting smaller.  Curious, he soon removed his other show and sock and saw his other foot is doing the same.  Wriggling it, he could tell that the changes were starting and had to do something.<br />
<br />
“Whoa!  Looks like the changes are happening fast.  Better get off this chair and head to the bed.  Last thing I want is falling on my face when my feet are gone.” Jeff said.<br />
<br />
Getting off his chair, he walked to his bed as a better way to lie down as the changes were taking place.  But as he was getting close, he felt his legs getting smaller and it was difficult for him to keeping himself up.  Almost immediately, his prediction came true as he started to trip and fall.  Fortunately, he didn’t fall to the floor.  Instead, he landed on the bed face first, making it in time.<br />
<br />
“Urgh…  Talk about cutting it close.  I thought for sure that I was going to go unconscious if I landed on the floor.” He said to himself.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Using his arms, he got up on the bed and sit down to see what happened.  Looking at his feet, he can clearly see he has no feet to speak of.  Just two stomps with nothing connected to it.  Those stumps soon shrunk into the bottom hem of his past and vanished completely, moving up his legs.  Seeing that, he decided to take a look at the progressing changes.<br />
<br />
“Better undress myself.  I have to see what’s going on with these changes.”<br />
<br />
With that, he immediately lifts his shirt up and then undid his belt to take off both his pants and boxers.  Now it is fully naked as he observed his changes.  Pretty soon, could see the stumps spreading up his legs and to his knees.  Going up his thighs, it was getting close to his waist area and was getting hard to sit.  He soon crawled back to his pillow and rest his head to see the stumps go up his waist, leaving him completely legless.<br />
<br />
As he looked on, he noticed that his pick started to get erect, as if it was turning him on.  But in reality, he wasn’t turn on.  He believes it must be the Chronivac making him turned on.  Watching on, he saw his shaft slowly shrinking as his balls were shriveling.  The mushroom tip compressed and the hole on top concealed itself, leaving nothing but a fleshy tube.  Soon enough, he penis and balls absorbed into his skin and left him completely crotchless.  That was soon followed by his rear as he felt it zipped up and concealing his anus.<br />
<br />
Once the two things were out of the way, the bit stumps at the bottom started to rise up higher and crawling up his stomach.  That in turn led to his belly button filling in and his dusting of abs smoothing over.  Going up his stomach and approaching his chest, he could feel something in his body.  Apparently, all of his organs were compressing and disappearing completely, from his stomach, kidneys, pancreas, and even his vital organs such as his heart and lungs.  But for some reason, he was still alive, even if he can’t breath or could feel a heart beat.  Jeff’s guess is that the Chronivac was still keeping him alive.<br />
<br />
As the huge stomp go up his chest, he felt a tingling on his hands and he took a good look at it.  That’s when he saw his hands growing smaller and continued to shrink into baby sized.  They grew too small that they popped out of existence and was left with stomps on his arms just like his feet.  The stumps soon went down his arms and go up the elbows, removing muscle tissues and bones.  The stumps went up his elbows and then his biceps until they reached his shoulders, leaving him armless.  The rest of the big stump soon reached his chest and all the way up to his neck.  Pretty soon, Jeff became just a head and neck lying on his pillow with the rest of his body long gone.<br />
<br />
Peering his eyes around, he was surprised on how that changes occurred.<br />
<br />
“Whoa!  This is really freaky.  I’m just a living head.  I never thought the Chronivac could do something like that.  Wonder what else it did?” he asked himself.<br />
<br />
Just as he said that, he heard the doorknob turning and the door opening.  Using just his eyes, he looks to the door to see who’s coming in.  That’s when he saw his own mother coming in, a headless mother.  He blinked with shock, as he couldn’t believe that his mother would walk in without a head.  What’s even more surprising is that she was walking down to Jeff as if she was a zombie.  By the time she approached him Jeff looked on and was curious at what she’s doing.<br />
<br />
“Mom?  Is that you?  What happened to you head?  Can you even hear me?”<br />
<br />
Of course, Olivia wouldn’t hear him, as she doesn’t have any ears.  But her body was on automatic as she outreached her arms and grabbed Jeff’s head off the pillow.  Jeff felt that and was caught by surprise.<br />
<br />
“Whoa!  Mom!  Be careful!  Don’t let me fall!”<br />
<br />
Olivia slowly lifted her son’s head over her headless body and slowly lowered it to her necklace top.  In a few brief moments, she connected Jeff’s head to her body as his neck merged with her.  By the time that happened, he could feel Mom’s heartbeat and breathing through his mom’s lungs.  Not only that, but he seems to have full control of his mom’s body.  Turning his neck, he lifted his mom’s arm and flexed his mom’s fingers.  Starring in awe, he was amazed at what happened.<br />
<br />
“I can’t believe it!  It works, I now have control of my mom’s body!” he said with excitement in his voice.  He soon started to worry on why he has Mom’s body when he still has his head.  “Still…  I have my own head and not my mom’s.  Doesn’t make any sense.  The last thing I want is my family seeing me like this.”<br />
<br />
By the time he asked about it, he could feel his head tingling.  That’s when he soon realizes that the changes were just beginning.  Turning to his full-length mirror, he hurried with his mom’s body and took a closer look and see what was happening.  What he saw was truly fascinating.  His face started to become putty as it was magically molded to find the body.  Jeff’s skin was clearing out as it was devoid of any blemishes and small pimples.  His skull structure was rearranging itself changing shape and structure to that of his mother’s.  His nose got small and thin, making it looks like Olivia’s matching nose.  His lips puffed and showed a tint of red on it, lacking the lipstick.  His eyes grew small and he had to blink as his eye color was changing from hazel to green.  His Adams apple slowly shrank into his thinning throat, disappearing completely.  Finally, his short hair started to grow long and wavy, coming down his mother’s thighs while the pigment color changed to a dark shade of brown.  Looking right at the mirror, Jeff realized that he wasn’t Jeff anymore.  He’s not a splitting resemblance of his own mother, Olivia.<br />
<br />
Finally, his brain started to take effect as he felt a migraine.  Placing his hands on the side of his head, he could feel all the memories and knowledge of his mom.  He still has his own memories as well as he didn’t want to loose them all as well.  So he’s going to be okay with that.  Soon enough, all the changes were finished, as Jeff has become Olivia in body and mind.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked to his feminine body and was impressed by what he had become.  “Wow…  Look at me.  I look so smoking hot!” he said with the voice of his own mother.  He soon did a few poses in his mirror and could tell that he’s damn sexy in his mom’s body.  Bending down for a sultry pose, he grabbed his boobs and gave them a good squeeze, feeling hot over it and winking to it.  “Man, I never thought mom’s body was this flexible.  This is amazing.”  He soon got up and grabs hold of his mom’s breasts one more time and was blushing from how they feel.  “And these beauties…  I can’t believe that they are so real.”  He soon got down to his mom’s butt and rubbed them as well.  “And this ass…  So round and firm…  Mom really work hard to keep this body in shape after having me and my other two siblings.”<br />
<br />
Standing up, he placed his mom’s hands and his mom’s hips and gave a really good smirk.  “All and all, I say I can get use to this body.  Now…  What should I with this body I’m controlling?”  He gave it some thought and wondered what to do for the next couple of hours before things reverse itself.</p>
