<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mary Elise sighed as she continued scanning through the numerous books played out in front of her. While her friends were all enjoying spring break, her school wasnt scheduled until later. Not wanting to let the opportunity pass her by, Mary Elise quickly dove into Dartmouths extensive library in hope of finding something that could help.<br />
<br />
&quot;Any luck?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary Elise lifted her head, giving her long time boyfriend Sebastian a sad smile. &quot;Nothing,&quot; she sighed. &quot;I would of thought we would have something! I mean, it is an Ivy League school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty sure the Ivy league doesnt deal in magical legends,&quot; Sebastian chuckled as he handed Mary Elise a coffee. &quot;Cmon, I told Shiro and Jen we would meet them outside the Student Union.&quot;<br />
<br />
A brief walk eventually led the couple to Jen and Shiro. The couples had all tried finding anything that could help them against this threat and had so far come up empty. Despite this, they still felt they could find a solution to their problems. Those problems, though were about to meet them head on.<br />
<br />
As the couples were about to go and find something to eat, they were forced to dive for cover as an explosion of magical energy detonated nearby. Dusting themselves off the quartet looked over, gasping at what they saw.<br />
<br />
&quot;Voids,&quot; Jen whispered, pointing towards the grayish humanoids.<br />
<br />
&quot;Worse,&quot; Shiro grunted. &quot;Fukushu.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary Elise narrowed her eyes as she gazed at the eight tailed kitsune. Fukushu had a triumphant smirk on his vulpine face as he watched the group of Voids terrorize a group of college students attempting to flee. Looking towards the far end of the quad his smirk faded. &quot;Their you are,&quot; he growled in a barely audible tone. Gaining the Voids attention he now motioned them to attack Mary Elise and her friends.<br />
<br />
Mary Elise and the others now braved themselves as a group of Voids now charged towards them mindlessly. Shiro brought forth his katana with a word as Sebastian and Jen unleashed several blasts of energy at the approaching enemy. The initial attacks did little to stop their advance. As they got within striking distance Shiro stepped forward, swinging his katana at the attacking Voids.<br />
<br />
Shiros attacks were precise but the damage was minimal at best. Despite limbs being severed the Voids pushed on.  Now it was Mary Elises turn to act. Focusing her magic into her pendent she now began to use the trees. Mother nature now became a weapon of the auburn haired coed as vines sprang forth from the ground as the limbs of oak trees swatted the attacking Voids away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyone got any ideas,&quot; Jen yelled as she dodged out of the way of an attack. &quot;These things arent slowing down.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m open to suggestions,&quot; Mary Elise responded, watching as the Voids now began uprooting the tree she was useing to attack them. <br />
<br />
Gunfire now rang out behind the four coeds forcing them to dive for cover. Glancing at the approaching Voids, Mary Elise was shocked to see their heads explode from the impact of the bullet. Confused she turned her head, her mouth dropping in shock.<br />
<br />
Behind the group were two teenage kitsune, or at least they sort of looked like kitsune. The two teens a little bulkier than the teenage kitsune she had seen in the past, possessing an impressive amount of muscle. The brown fur the two had also had faint stripes running over their bodies, while their ears were more rounded than pointed. Finally Mary Elise could see that the two tails the teens possessed appeared more feline like than fox like.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice shot Aaron,&quot; the female said. Aaron smirked, turning towards his sister. &quot;What were you expecting Haley,&quot; he smirked. &quot;You want to finish them off?&quot;<br />
<br />
Haley giggled almost girlishly as she now held up an oversized hammer. &quot;Got my yeet hammer,&quot; she said happily. Aaron gave his sister a knowing look as he watched her charge forward, laughing maniacally.<br />
<br />
Fukushu was visibly confused as he gazed at the two teenage anthros. They appeared to be kitsune yet something was very different. The Male, who appeared to be named Aaron, sported an array of handguns strapped to himself. What alarmed Fukushu though was the enchantments placed on these weapons. Aaron appeared to be an expert shot, hitting the Voids directly in the head with little effort. While normally he wouldnt have been concerned, these bullets appeared tailor made to take down magical beings.<br />
<br />
The female, Haley, was a force to be reckoned with in her own right. Sporting a pair of brightly colored pigtails the smaller girl was no less capable a fighter. Fukushu watched as she wielded the hammer with a tremendous amount of skill, smashing the heads of the Voids. As they dispatched his troops Fukushu watched as they now approached him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hiya Unc,&quot; Haley said excitedly, waving at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do I know you,&quot; Fukushu asked,<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet Fuku,&quot; Aaron grinned. &quot;But you know our mom. You know, Mika.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu was startled by this bit of information. Little Mika a mother? How had his sister become a mother? The clan was barren.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look confused Fuku,&quot; Aaron smirked. &quot;Dont worry about it. You wont live long enough to find out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushus eyes went wide as the teen now drew his weapon firing several shots in his direction. Startled he dodged before yelping in pain as a bullet connected with his shoulder. Diving behind a tree, Fukushu grasped his shoulder, shocked to see he was bleeding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Smashy! Smashy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu looked up just in time as Haley brought her hammer down. Dodging quickly he watched as the tree he had been behind splintered into pieces. Staring in stunned silence he could see a maniacal grin spread across the teenage girls face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fukushu!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lord Villar,&quot; Fukushu thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fukushu,&quot; Villars voice echoed in his head. &quot;Return at once, the timeline has altered.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu paused, his master sounded as if he was in pain. &quot;My lord is everything okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;These children should not exist,&quot; Villars voice echoed. &quot;Your clan was not meant to have children. Lilith, that bitch, she has given your clan the gift of life. These two are but the first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How are they so strong,&quot; Fukushu asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Part of Liliths gift,&quot; Villar growled. &quot;The first born of her spell are connected to chaos. Your niece and nephew here are chaotic in nature. Unlike the others they have no qualms of useing brutal tactics. Now return before they destroy you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu could only nod, gazing at the two apprehensively he now vanished into the ether.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw he left,&quot; Haley pouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hell be back sis,&quot; Aaron snarled. &quot;And when he does, we&#39;ll finish what we started. Now, let&#39;s go talk with the wizards.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary Elise and the others had watched everything transpire in stunned silence. As Fukushu vanished they were now left with two teenage anthros with incredible power. Hopefully these two would turn out to be friendly.</p>
