<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next day, Emily was surprised and terrified of what had happened to her last night. As she woke up, she tried putting her hands to her face, but instead she felt the rough surface of her hooves. She opened her eyes and screamed in terror as both arms and legs were larger and had the hooves of that like a bovine. Emily was freaking out. What was happening to her? Where was Amelia? Would she ever see the light of day again?<br />
<br />
These questions were driving her insane. She tried calming herself down, but this was too weird. She tried standing up, which immediately backfired as she came crashing down onto the floor. Her torso was seemingly bigger than yesterday, as her chest cavity grew slightly wider. She was also getting fatter, even though she barely ate the day before.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, Emily was starving. She didn&#39;t know it, but she had this craving for the feed she had eaten last night. She stumbled on over to the trough on all fours. She looked over to the water trough and began to drink. She had not noticed that a tail had sprouted from her spine while she was sleeping. She wagged it without noticing at first, but a that same moment, she heard the door begin to open. Dr. Remus came in with the same clipboard and same smug as yesterday. <br />
<br />
Emily shot her head up, and  stopped wagging her tail, which at then she noticed it&#39;s existence. &quot;What do want now?&quot; she asked. Remus tilted his head to the side, noticing that she had grown a tail. He smiled. &quot;Looks like someone&#39;s finally showing some growth on her.&quot; he said. Emily ignored him, continuing over to the food trough to eat some feed. Remus waited for a response, but didn&#39;t get one. &quot;You know, your friend has beed doing pretty well since the transformation began.&quot; He finally said. &quot;It&#39;s a shame you never got to say goodbye to her.&quot; <br />
<br />
Emily looked at him. &quot;What are you even planning for me? What is happening to me?&quot; she asked, her tone slowly drifting into sadness. Remus walked over to her and looked down on her face. He could see that she was also sprouting horns, and that her face was slightly wider than usual.<br />
<br />
&quot;You see, Emily, we in the dairy business need cows, right? It&#39;s the sole basis of the whole thing.&quot; He said, as he looked at her. &quot;But, the problem with having cows is the fact that they don&#39;t live forever. A cow&#39;s lifespan is only about 18 years. And sometimes, cows don&#39;t produce the ideal amount of milk that is required, or rather, demanded for the good people of the world.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily looked at him with a confused expression on her face. &quot;And your point is?&quot; she asked. &quot;Good question.&quot; he replies. &quot;With kidnapping people and replacing them with our lovely bovines, the dairy industry might rise higher than it&#39;s ever been. If cows live to as long as a human can, and with fixed milk-producing formulas, we might just be living in an era of super cows!&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily was scared. She didn&#39;t want to be a cow for the rest of her life, but she was afraid that it was the only thing that would be happening.. &quot;Will I ever see Amelia again?&quot; She asked. &quot;Most likely not. Sure, you might end up on the same farms, but you&#39;ll look so much like the other cows that you wouldn&#39;t even realize!&quot; he answers. Her heart sank. The doctor pulled up his clipboard and flipped through the pages until he stopped at one. &quot;Now let&#39;s see your growth rate so far.&quot; he said, pointing his fingers down until he stopped. &quot;Day one should have made the formula from the milk you drank spread across your body and make sure everything is stable until it starts to change you. Night of day one should have your hooves grown in and your tail elongate. Start of day two should have your udder, leg muscles and face develop. Then at the night of day two should have your ears elongate too. Day three, you should be experiencing your chest barrel out as your breasts sink in and become nonexistent.&quot; he said as he flipped the page. &quot;By the way, don&#39;t resist your urge to eat or drink. Your body needs it so that it can maintain itself while your changes continue.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway.&quot; he continued. &quot;Uh, night of day three, you should be experiencing the full growth of pretty much everything. Day four, you&#39;ll fatten up and hairs will start to sprout from everywhere on your body except for your udder. Night of day four, your udder will be producing milk for the first time and you&#39;ll lose your human larynx in exchange for a cow&#39;s, so there goes your voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will be producing milk even if you&#39;re not pregnant or not, which won&#39;t matter anyway since you&#39;ll probably still be bred if things go smoothly.&quot; He said, slowly walking backwards towards the door. &quot;These next few days are going to be tough for ya, I suppose, so better get ready!&quot; he said, as he walked put of the room, closing the door in the process. &quot;Oh, and by the way. As your final days of being human come to a close, your bowels rearrange, causing you to no longer control them. That&#39;s it for today, ta ta!&quot;<br />
<br />
Great, she thought. Emily sighed and went back to eating. She thought about her future, how she would&#39;ve been human again. She was enraged, but she figured if she was going to be stuck like this, she might as well accept the changes instead of fight them. As the day progressed, she could feel her stomach changing, her head stretching, and horns itching. Her groin area got fatter and soon formed 4 nipples to be her udders. As usual, she continued eating, further fueling the growth as she drifted off to sleep for the night.</p>
