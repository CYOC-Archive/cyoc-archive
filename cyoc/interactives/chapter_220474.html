<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Melody ran faster and faster as the rain began to pick up more and more. She couldn’t help but notice the warm breeze all over her body, it wasn’t normal, especially considering how cold it had gotten. She found the front door of her boyfriends house, quickly knocking on it.<br />
“Babe?” The familiar voice of her boyfriend said through the door. He opened it, finding his cold, wet girlfriend standing, shivering with her arms wrapped tightly over her chest.<br />
<br />
Around twenty minutes had passed. Melody was sat, shivering with a blanket wrapped over her. Despite her body being cold, she still felt that warmness. Just slightly.<br />
“Can I explain myself?” Tony asked, handing her a warm cup of coffee,<br />
“W-what-tever…” Melody stuttered with cold breath. She took a sip from the coffee, feeling the warm liquid running down her throat, heating her up quickly,<br />
“I was…” Tony sighed, “you’re the perfect girlfriend. Really!” He said, Melody scoffed, “I’m serious,”<br />
“Then what were all the links?” She asked accusatory. She’d removed her jacket, having it rested to dry. She adjusted her tight tank top, her bra as well,<br />
“It was… I was…” Tony tried to think of some kind of witty reply, a smart response that’d get him out of the doghouse, but he couldn’t, “I just watched Porn,”<br />
“WHILE WE ARE DATING!?” Melody shouted,<br />
“Shhh…” Tony tried to quiet her down, “it’s not about you,” he said, “I was on my own… in fact I missed you. It was… like I was remembering you,”<br />
“Remembering me?” Melody once again scoffed, “so girls with tits as big as their heads remind you of me?” She turned her head to the side, then looked down, once again adjusting her tank top, it felt tighter than before,<br />
“Every guy I know watched porn… I mean most girls I know do,”<br />
“No they don’t,” Melody said, “not a single girl I know has ever watched porn,”<br />
“I-I…” Tony stuttered, he tilted his head slightly, speaking under his breath, “I doubt that,”<br />
“WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!” Melody shouted, almost dropping the mug. She placed it aggressively down on the coffee table and stood up as if to make a dramatic exit. But as she did, the blanket fell down, “fuck…” she said. She gave Tony an angry look before leaning down and picking it back up. In doing this, she gave him a perfect eye into her cleavage. He couldn’t help but stare.<br />
It was far from the first time Melody had showed off her cleavage for Tony, and Tony was very familiar with it. Which is why Tony could see that something was off,<br />
“D-did you get a new…” he started to ask, before Melody snapped her head back up to look him in the eyes, “…bra?”<br />
“You’re so typical,” Melody groaned. She placed the blanket messily back on the couch before taking her coffee to the kitchen behind them. She stood over the sink, resting her hands on the side and acting melodramatic, “I think it’s completely out of line for you to be watching… that, while we are still in a relationship. It’s like…” she hesitated. Tony was doing his best to listen, but he couldn’t keep his eyes off of her ass. Something about it, even in her retro looking jeans, it seemed bigger. And if his eyes weren’t playing tricks on him, it still looked to be growing, “it’s like you’re cheating on me!” She said,<br />
“What!?” Tony exclaimed, “it’s nothing like cheating!”<br />
”It totally is!” She said, spinning around to face her boyfriend. He was now standing up, she walked towards him, “I just… I can’t face the fact you’d rather your girlfriend was some big titty bimbo bitch! I’m a real person!”<br />
“Babe I know! I’d take you any day over one of them!”<br />
As the two argued back and fourth, Tony noticed something else. His eye-level, previously several inches taller than his girlfriend… it was different. His head was no longer tilted so far down, instead he was looking more head-on with her. She was supposed to be five-foot-six, he was six feet tall. Now it looked like she was somewhere around five-feet-ten, even with her high heeled boots on, she was significantly taller somehow,<br />
“Uhm…” Tony said, unable to focus,<br />
“Can you not pay attention to what I’m saying! If you’re not careful…” she started, almost looking as if she was going to cry, “th-this could be  the end of us…”<br />
“What!?” Tony once again exclaimed, <br />
“O-our relationship…” she looked down, unable to keep looking him in the eyes. As she began to obviously tear up, Tony watched as her hair started getting longer, it seemed to extend further and further from the roots. He felt like he was going insane, but her hair even seemed a little lighter. What the hell was going on!?<br />
“I don’t want to lose us…” Melody said, tilting her face up again, she brushed her longer hair out of her face, revealing her eyes. Tony couldn’t believe what he was seeing… her eyelashes had grown longer… just by a little bit. Her nose, it looked smaller somehow. Her cheekbones somewhat higher. And her lips, they were getting plumper. Each moment, as she stared into his eyes with a quivering lip, she couldn’t help but lean in, “I can’t lose us…” she placed her lips upon his. Her chest pressed into his.<br />
Her kiss felt different, it was bigger, softer, more passionate. Melody was the best kisser Tony knew, he could never forget the feeling of her lips. There was no mistaking this was different. That meant this was real, she was truly changing right in front of his eyes!<br />
<br />
Tony pulled away, “babe are you okay?” He asked. This was sexy, but his concern was higher than his libido,<br />
“Of course I’m okay…” she said, grumpily, “was that kiss not enough for you?” She said, crossing her arms, finding it more uncomfortable than usual. But she looked at Tony’s face. He looked almost afraid. Like he couldn’t believe what he was seeing, “what?” She asked. She turned and caught herself in the reflection of the TV. She didn’t look… too different. But there was change. A change in colour from what she was used to, “what is it?” She asked again, impatiently,<br />
“Y-your hair…” he said,<br />
“What about my hair?” She asked. She looked in the kitchen, finding the toaster. It had a mirror-like finish around it. She made her way over, tilted it towards herself, and saw herself for the first time.<br />
<br />
“OH MY GOD!” She screamed, seeing her hair having changed from dark brown to a blonde, “WHAT THE HELL!?” She screamed, she turned to him, “I-I can’t have done this, right!? This doesn’t make sense… no,” she said, turning towards her boyfriend, “I can’t be changing. I’m wrong… I just… I’ve always looked like this,” she said, trying to rationalise it, sounding crazy on the process, “I mean if I’m changing… I wouldn’t just suddenly change out of nowhere, right?” She said.<br />
And if on cue, she felt a warmness in around her chest. It centralised more and more central, towards her nipples. She looked down as the warmness became a deep pleasure, she opened her mouth almost as if to moan. Until suddenly the pleasure penetrated her senses, like a spike impaled her with a rich, excruciating pleasure. She moaned loudly before looking down, seeing her nipples protrude through her tank top. Even with her bra, they poked through. She could hardly take it, feeling herself falling to the ground.<br />
But Tony caught her, keeping her up. She looked him in the eyes. With a mixed feeling of pleasure and discomfort, she couldn’t help but be happy Tony was helping her. Maybe he loved her after all…<br />
<br />
He dragged her back to the couch, whereupon she slid out of his hands and onto the sofa, her eyes rolled gently back and fourth and the pleasure pulsated through her. She wasn’t even sure if she’d orgasmed yet.<br />
“Babe… what the hell is going on here…” he said, “I swear, I never wished anything like this would ever happen to you,”<br />
“I-I know…” Melody said, coming back to her senses, “I made a deal…” she said, her breathing steadying, “with a thing outside,”<br />
“What?”<br />
“I have to endure your… like… fetishes or something,”<br />
“WHAT!?” Tony yelled, blushing quickly, “what do you mean by that…”<br />
“I thought it wasn’t real,” she said, placing her hands on her head, balancing herself, “I just… I was so mad,” she said, finally speaking some kind of sense, “I just don’t want to lose you,” she said. She looked up at him,<br />
“You’re not going to lose me… not over porn,” he said, placing his hand on hers, “I was bored, I missed you. I’d spend a peaceful day out with you over spending any kind of time with a girl like that. I promise,” he said. They both smiled at each other, Melody felt quite relieved.<br />
<br />
“I suppose if this is the challenge, there’s a lot worse it could’ve gone,” she smirked, looking down at her enchanced cleavage. She reached around, unhooking her bra. She pulled it out from her tank top, revealing her perky, DD sized breasts. Her nipples were significantly bigger, rock-hard, poking pretty hard through the fabric of her tank top, “I guess you could do me a favour and… remove my pants for me?”<br />
She smirked.<br />
It seemed as if Melody had learned her lesson, and Tony had earned some kind of reward. A slightly sexier girlfriend. <br />
<br />
Melody got changed into a pair of gym-shorts, now tight around her bubblier butt, she smirked. Maybe this is what she needed to make Tony love her. She smiled at him, as the two started making out again…<br />
<br />
Everything seemed fine… until.<br />
“Uhm… Melody?” Tony asked, looking once again, a little afraid,<br />
“No…” Melody said, her expression changed, “don’t tell me it’s not over!” She said, feeling the warmness spreading once again.</p>
