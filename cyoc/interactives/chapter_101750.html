<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was now Julie&#39;s turn to be it in their game of &quot;Marco Polo&quot;.<br />
She walked back to the pool steps, closed her eyes, and said “Marco.”<br />
Then she heard Eric whisper in her ear “Polo,” before he took her in his arms and kissed her.<br />
The kiss was long, deep, soulful, and romantic. Their lips kept a tight seal as their tongues danced back and forth between each other&#39;s mouths as the lovers wrapped their arms around each other.<br />
When they finally stopped, Julie looked at Eric as if there was a great weight on her mind.<br />
Finally, she said, “We need to talk,” before Julie had him sit down on the pool steps next to her.<br />
<br />
Julie held Eric&#39;s hands in hers and told him everything. Not just reminding him about the were-mer&#39;s sense and belief of love at first sight, along with everything else he already knew about her people and their customs, but also about how his eyes were changing color as a confirmation sign of what was meant to be between them, the mating urges growing within each of them, even if he might not be consciously aware of them yet; and confessed that her mother had set everything up to give them the opportunity to do what was necessary if they wanted today because she didn&#39;t want them having to wait ten years for love like she had. Although her father going to California to take care of her grandmother after she hurt herself was NOT part of the plan.<br />
“We&#39;re not trying to pressure you. I&#39;M not trying to pressure you, but fate is working against us here. Sooner or later the urges will become too great to ignore and when that happens...” Her voice trailed off for a moment before Julie spoke again. “When it does happen, I want that first time with you, my soul mate, to be as romantic as possible. I want it to happen because WE want it, because we truly love each other, not because of some hormonal drive we can&#39;t control.”<br />
<br />
Eric had sat next to Julie, listening intently to every word. It was a lot to take in. Eric knew that when they did finally do more than just kiss, he would become a were-merman.<br />
He wanted to be HER were-merman. There was no one else in his life and Eric couldn&#39;t picture anyone but Julie Stovall in his heart. Some of his dreams of them went far beyond high school, showing a future where she was Mrs. Julie Anderson and they lived happily forever after.<br />
Eric&#39;s life was lonely beyond description back in Minnesota. She represented not only love and happiness, but a bright promising future as well.<br />
He wanted to tell Julie all of that to calm her fears, but the first words out of his mouth were, “I understand why you didn&#39;t tell me.”<br />
“If you had noticed and asked, I would have,” replied Julie, hoping that would ease his concerns.<br />
“There should never be any secrets between us, yet I can&#39;t be mad at you for keeping this one even if I wanted to, because I&#39;ve been keeping a secret from you too.”<br />
“Oh?” she asked, with a surprised look on her face.<br />
<br />
Eric took a deep breath before asking, “Do you know why my family moved from Minnesota to Moon Lake?”<br />
“Because your father got a better teaching position at the college here than wherever he was back there,” answered Julie.<br />
“No. That&#39;s only what we tell people,” confessed Eric. Then he explained to Julie the real reason. William Anderson&#39;s months (years?) of covert unfaithfulness to his wife that ended with his father getting a coed pregnant, losing his job and tenure, and having to move away in hopes of having a fresh start and a chance to save his marriage somewhere else.<br />
“Nate and I talked about it one night in a motel room on the way here,” revealed Eric. “While I didn&#39;t know at the time Nate&#39;s gay, both of us agreed that we didn&#39;t want to turn out like the way dad was, before becoming a werefox established the life/mate bond between him and mom that saved their marriage. I&#39;m scared not only because I do not want to take the risk of hurting the woman I love physically if we attempt to have sex today, but because I&#39;m afraid of someday running the risk of hurting you the way my dad hurt mom.”<br />
<br />
Julie Stovall&#39;s only response was to hug her boyfriend. “Eric Anderson, you have absolutely no idea just how much you truly mean to me. You&#39;re the first thing I think of when I get up in the morning, the last thought on my mind before I fall asleep, and you occupy a lot of my day as well. But there is no way you could ever hurt me the way your father harmed your mother, even if you were stupid enough to try. I don&#39;t know how it compares to a werefox&#39;s life/mate bond, but don&#39;t you know that all were-mer couples are totally monogamous?”<br />
“They are?” asked Eric in disbelief.*<br />
“Once a wer-mer has confirmation that they&#39;ve found their soul mate, like I have seeing those beautiful blue eyes of yours right now, it&#39;s eternal,” said Julie, staring intently at Eric. “Like love at first sight, happily forever after is another proven fact among our people. There has never been a divorce in the whole history of were-mer society.<br />
“I—” began Eric, at a lost for words. “I&#39;ve been a complete dummy!” he said, kicking the water in frustration. “First I didn&#39;t know what love is. Then I had to figure out whether or not what I feel toward you is love. Now I almost let my dad&#39;s past ruin the best things I&#39;ve ever had in my whole life: you and your love. If I had only known about this color change thing sooner...”<br />
“I know, and I&#39;m sorry I couldn&#39;t tell you,” said Julie, apologeticly, “but things between us had to develop as naturally as possible.”<br />
“Well, getting back to that other matter... I&#39;ve heard and read plenty of stuff about what should happen, along with all the hows and whys, but I don&#39;t want to hurt you.”<br />
“I know Eric,” replied Julie, staring at him, “but the part I&#39;m still scared about is that there will be some degree of pain for me the first time. I&#39;ve never liked pain.”<br />
“Who does?” asked Eric in return.<br />
“You don&#39;t understand. This is a childhood fear I&#39;ve had practically my entire life, but sadly, pain can&#39;t be avoided this time,” said Julie. “Yet mom also said that afterward, the rest of our lives together will be pure pleasure, at least romanticly and sexually. For that, I&#39;m willing to take the chance,” she said, grasping his hands tighter. “But whatever happens, we&#39;re in this together. So what do you want to do?” Julie asked, leaving the decision entirely up to him.<br />
<br />
Eric Anderson just sat there on the pool steps. It seemed like a very long time to her as he thought things over, but it was actually just a little over a minute. Then...<br />
