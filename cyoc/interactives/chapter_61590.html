<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Blushing madly, and keeping the folds of &quot;her&quot; robe together, Fred (in Jill's body), didn't see the real Jill<br />
(in Fred's body), smile, thinking: Well, this may not be a total disaster after all. As Fred, he had totally no<br />
modesty, and would always try to get into MY panties. No other girl's would do. Actually, I'm rather flattered<br />
that out of all the girls he could have chosen, he chose me, and he's got my voice perfect, and my signatures.<br />
Suddenly, &quot;Jill&quot; gave a soft, very discreet, feminine cough. Is there no end the his-I mean, her talents? the<br />
real Jill asked herself. &quot;Before we talk about anything&quot;, &quot;Fred&quot; said, adding, &quot;Or DO anything, would you mind<br />
getting that asshole up here to mend the door?&quot; &quot;Jill&quot; said, &quot;Sure, one moment, please&quot;, and walked down the<br />
stairs in a very feminine manner, walked over to Helen Walker, the real Jill's friend, and said, &quot;Hello, Helen. Excuse me, I've got to deal with that idiot&quot;.  In a chillingly cold voice, Fred, in Jill's body, asked, &quot;And<br />
just where do you think YOU'RE going, Russ?&quot; &quot;As far away from here as possible!&quot; he replied. &quot;You broke the<br />
door of the bathroom, which, by the way, is six feet four inches tall, and six feet two inches wide, and hope<br />
to get away with it? Not a chance. You are going to replace it today, with a steel 6ft. 2in. tall and 6ft. <br />
2in. wide, bulletproof and soundproof door, which also includes the same bulletproof and soundproof  glass!&quot;<br />
Jill (in Fred's body, approved. And she definitely LOVED  the way &quot;Jill&quot; delivered the coup  de grace: &quot;Oh, and should  you even TRY some stupid stunt, Helen is a consummate professional of Aikido, Judo, Ju-jitsu and<br />
Karate, not forgetting Kung-Fu. Don't give her a reason to use them&quot;. Russ gulped. &quot;Surely y-you're kidding?&quot; Helen's eyes narrowed at Russ.&quot;You are in BIG trouble, pal&quot;, she informed him calmly. She added, &quot;Where are you going, Jill?&quot; she asked, and the  real Jill smiled to herself to hear  Fred (in her body) easily reply, &quot;Oh, to get dressed and put my face on. Just try not to damage him too much&quot;. Reunited with the real Jill in her own room, Fred asked quietly, &quot;So, Jill, what's the verdict?&quot; Jill replied, &quot;Well, it may not be a total disaster after all. As Fred-and I hate to say this, but it's true, you had totally no modesty, and would always try to get into my panties. No other girl's panties would suffice. I knew I should've been outraged, I was secretly flattered that it had to be mine. It's nice to see you showing some modesty for a while. Also, you've got my voice, walk, signature and discreet, feminine cough down perfectly. If you will agree to remain me, I will agree to obey you in all things. And yes, I am serious&quot;. There was a brief pause, but Fred (in Jill's body), finally said, &quot;OK, but if we are to pull this off successfully, there must be some ground rules laid. Deal?&quot; After a moment's hesitation, Jill said, &quot;Deal&quot;, and  she helped Fred apply make-up, but she needn't have bothered. Suddenly,a motherly female voice exclaimed, &quot;Fred? What are you doing in Jill's room?&quot; Fred (in Jill's body) and Jill (in Fred's body) looked at first Jill's mother, then at each other, and as one voice, they chorused, &quot;I WAS AFRAID THIS MIGHT HAPPEN!&quot; The black-haired,emerald-eyed, attractive middle-aged woman was confused. &quot;Like what might happen, Fred?&quot; She asked. &quot;Actually, I am your daughter, Jill. And the person who looks like me physically, is Fred. Remember that  weird August of 1988?&quot; &quot;Vaguely. Wasn't that the time when for some unexplainable reason the boys turned into schoolgirls and the schoolgirls turned into schoolboys?&quot; Jill replied, &quot;Yes, mother&quot;. &quot;And how did Fred take it?&quot; Fred was surprised by Jill's answer: &quot;Better than I expected. For example, he's a lot more mature and modest now. I never told you this before, but when we were at school,  he gave my ego a huge boost. How, I'll tell you later. For now, though, just keep this between ourselves, okay?&quot; &quot;Jill&quot; walked over to &quot;her&quot; mother, and said, &quot;I know you are a  mainly a tea-drinker, mum, but I would advise you to drink strong black coffee to steady your nerves&quot;. &quot;I agree. Mum's 42, you know!&quot; Fred (in Jill's body), couldn't resist quipping, &quot;42! The answer to the ultimate question to Life, the Universe, and How Much the Taxman's Going to Charge You!&quot; That had the real Jill and her mother, rolling about laughing. Finally, their laughter spent, Jill's mother accepted a hand up from Fred, and at the two Jills' insistence, she drank strong black coffee. Then she learned why the two Jills had insisted on strong black coffee. Turning to her daughter, who looked like Fred, she  asked, &quot;Has F-I mean, have you  promised him anything, daughter?&quot; Jill (in Fred's body, replied, &quot;Yes. Anyway, back to how Fred gave my ego a huge boost of confidence when we were at school. He always tried to get into my knickers. Now any normal girl would have   been outraged. I, however, was not. Quite the opposite, in fact&quot;. Her mother asked, &quot;May I know why, daughter?&quot; &quot;Because  he could have chosen any girl, yet he ignored their panties in favour of mine. In fact, I was secretly flattered that he thought me that attractive that I was worthy of having my panties pilfered&quot;. &quot;We aim to please&quot;, Fred (in  Jill's body) quipped. She said to Fred, who wore her body, &quot;You know I want you to take my virginity from me, yet you have five conditions for me. I am listening. What's the first condition?&quot; Fred in Jill's body, replied, &quot;Condition 1: You must agree to be a petgirl&quot;. &quot;What's a petgirl?&quot; she asked while wearing Fred's body. The answer shocked  her. &quot;At present you are a beautigul, intelligent young woman, but  when your training and taming from Petgirls.com is over, you'll be nothing more or less than a crawling, collared, a leashed pet, and even your memories of being human will no longer exist!&quot; &quot;Do I at least have the right to  decide what kind of pet I can be?&quot; she sobbed. Fred (in her female body) said, &quot;Of course! I wouldn't want you to consider me  unfair. The pet types available to you are: petgirls, ponygirls, puppygirls, piggirl sexslaves or caged women&quot;. Fred added, &quot;And besides, as long as you behave yourself, it need not be unpleasant. In fact,you'd be kept as a pampered pet!&quot; &quot;Puppygirl, but please let me speak in human language!&quot; she begged. &quot;Do you swear on your immortal soul to always obey me,  no matter what the reason is?&quot; he asked her. &quot;I do so swear&quot;, she vowed.</p>
