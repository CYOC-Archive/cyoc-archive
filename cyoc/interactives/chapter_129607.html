<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The week that included Valentines Day, Mardi Gras, Ash Wednesday, and Chinese New Year was one that would give just about anyone a tiring runaround for things to cover and do. That was soon made pretty clear when Abby, Sarah, Malice, Jessica, and Sophie met up on the Monday as part of their planning sessions for their Animalia Ambassadoria episodes. They met at the Wesley house for this meeting which soon included looking after Belle and Bash for a moment as Julia had also just gotten home from work and picking them up from their daycare.<br />
<br />
&quot;First of all... this meeting can&#39;t go for too long,&quot; Sarah commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, we still have training for the Chinese New Year competition,&quot; Malice nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;s that going?&quot; Jessica wondered as softly patted Belle&#39;s tiny shoulder as the infant Husky Animalian had managed to crawl over to sniff at Jessica&#39;s feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s going good, lots of running and sled pulling,&quot; Sarah commented, &quot;but we&#39;re also getting more practice on some of the things that will come after the preliminaries... You know making the line up, walking the catwalk, and so on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All very formal stuff,&quot; Malice added, &quot;but it&#39;s stuff we gotta be there fore, so we can&#39;t have too long a meeting.&quot;<br />
<br />
The others nodded from where they were. Sophie and Sarah were seated on the main couch in the living room, while Malice sat in one easy chair, and Jessica and Abby were seated cross-legged on the carpeted floor. They all agreed to allow for a short meeting.<br />
<br />
&quot;A shame that there is so much that goes on this week,&quot; Sophie commented, &quot;there&#39;s Valentine&#39;s Day, Mardi Gras, Ash Wednesday, and the Chinese New Year all in the same week.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And Valentines Day and Ash Wednesday are the same day this year,&quot; Abbey added.<br />
<br />
There was a moment of silence as they all moved to think things over, as there were a lot of things that would need covering as updates on what was going on in Animalia and showing the bright side of the society. Normally this was done on an almost daily schedule, especially to show that Animalia and Animalians were more than what their detractors claimed... However, there were some times where their own schedules were often pretty busy that the Animalia Ambassadoria schedule would either be altered or one or more of the other members wouldn&#39;t be there for a particular episode.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe we should only do one episode this week,&quot; Sophie offered, &quot;film various parts of the week and then summarize the week at the end. It&#39;d make things easier than trying to do a series of episodes for each individual holiday or event.&quot;<br />
<br />
The idea was well accepted and they then set about choosing who would film what as the week went by... This also included what bits that they felt would the parts that their present mates/boyfriends would cover for the week, as they&#39;d all gone to a separate meeting that when Samson mentioned it to Abbey sounded suspiciously like Valentine&#39;s Day planning.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Mardi Gras came with the same excitement that it did every year in many places, and Animalia had found it to be quite an enjoyable celebration, as many did go the parade and have fun with the event, though not everyone. It wasn&#39;t that Jessica didn&#39;t like the Mardi Gras celebration or that her parents forbid it outright. She actually did like the of the parade and bright colors and all that sort of thing, but with Valentine&#39;s Day and Ash Wednesday being the same day and the continued reminders that she was growing up and would be growing into a figure that her mother didn&#39;t have and wouldn&#39;t ever have, unless she and her dad decided to become Animalians, with a high sex drive to add to it.<br />
<br />
Jessica wasn&#39;t ashamed of that knowledge and to some degree, she knew what she would ultimately become the moment she drank the glass of milk that Judy had provided for her, but she did have some sense of wanting to try and keep to her own promises to her parents before her transformation. For the moment, avoiding the Mardi Gras parade seemed like the best idea, and left for a more quiet and subdued dinner at home, though Roger had come as dinner guest as well, as he often did.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... any special plans coming up?&quot; her father asked to Roger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; Roger said slowly, &quot;I was hoping for a date tomorrow evening...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m already married,&quot; Jessica&#39;s father answered humorously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, he means with me!&quot; Jessica groaned.<br />
<br />
Her father only chuckled, indicating that he knew that already, which flustered Jessica a little bit. She knew her parents loved her and were accepting of her decision to become an Animalian. She was overjoyed that they accepted her dating Roger, even if their pairing was overly ironic given their names. That didn&#39;t, however, mean that she liked or wanted to endure the moments of over protectiveness or humor that her parents would sometimes show. However, she knew they did want what was best for her and that they loved her, which would mean she&#39;d just have to accept it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; her father sat back with a small smirk on his face, &quot;I&#39;m okay with a good date, just so long as you remember the rules we set with regard to dating... for BOTH of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, sir,&quot; Roger said slowly, &quot;And there is nothing illicit planned... Just dinner...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica kept her ears focused as Roger then described the base plan that was put together. Something told her that this was in relation to what meeting Roger, Travis, Samson, and Roland had had at the start of the week, which only triggered her curiosity at what was planned. The restaurant was one of those in Animalia that was mad to serve all Animalians, be they carnivore or herbivore, and with a few dishes that would be in relation to what humans could and would eat. In this it served as a general purpose restaurant. Beyond that, however, Roger didn&#39;t reveal any details beyond when she was to meet him at the restaurant.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Jessica showed up to the restaurant on time with a lot of that curiosity still in tact, particularly as she hadn&#39;t gotten much in the way of updates on what the plan for this date was. She&#39;d wanted to try and get something out of Roger at lunch, but he gave a cryptic smile and said she&#39;d have to wait. Now came the time for the date and her curiosity was at its highest. Though to her surprise, she found Sarah, Sophie, and Abbey also coming up toward the doors to the restaurant.<br />
<br />
&quot;You guys have dates, too?&quot; Jessica asked as she paused in front of the doors as her friends approached.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Abbey said slowly, &quot;Samson wouldn&#39;t say much with regard to the details... just that I was to meet him here at six o&#39;clock.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Roland said the same thing to me after school,&quot; Sophie commented.<br />
<br />
Jessica noticed a nod from Sarah as well, and all of this seemed to tickle her curiosity on the entire issue. Particularly as Samson, Roland, and Travis weren&#39;t with them. In fact, for the moment, Roger didn&#39;t seem to be there either. Though the first question that came to her was more to Sarah on her sister&#39;s absence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is Malice with Simon?&quot; Jessica wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Malice is at home,&quot; Sarah commented, &quot;Simon said he might be able to manage the drive to Lyre tomorrow for the Meat Market&#39;s &quot;Adult&quot; dinner/party, but he wouldn&#39;t be able to stay long... So, Malice is at home looking after Belle and Bash who were happy to play and giving my parents a night out. I think they went to one of the steakhouses in Lyre or Animalia... or was it Lover&#39;s Woods... Either way, they went out for the evening.&quot;<br />
<br />
They all nodded. Though from there, their thoughts soon turned back to the curiosity at the situation they were in. They apparently all had dates and were supposed to meet them at the same place and at the same time. It left Jessica wondering entirely on what was going on. However, the only way they could figure out what was going on was to continue to go on with the instructions they were given. Jessica opened the door and held it open for the others letting Abby take the lead in entering the restaurant with Sarah and Sophie following close behind. As they entered, however, they got the answer to where their &quot;absent&quot; boyfriends were. They were in fact waiting for them in the restaurant&#39;s lobby, and while they weren&#39;t in anything as formal as a tuxedo, they were dressed quite well in matching suits.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it looks like we&#39;re all here,&quot; Sophie said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Roland gave a small smile and then nodded to Samson.<br />
<br />
Samson then turned to the person manning the podium for the restaurant&#39;s host/hostess and said, &quot;Okay... our party is now here and ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Party?&quot; Abby wondered as she approached Samson and he took her arm, &quot;It&#39;s Valentine&#39;s... I was thinking it&#39;d be more... private... or that we&#39;d be at the school dance...&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a school dance going on, just as there was last year, and to show the cooperation between WSA and the Lyre School District, the dance was essentially combined between the two and was at the WSA Gym. There was some element in that probably contained some ability to help many of the students at Lyre get more used to WSA layout and buildings when the two districts were unified in the next fall, but that was something different and something that apparently wasn&#39;t part of whatever the boys had planned.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have something special planned,&quot; Samson commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;We wanted to include everyone... but Simon said that while he might be able to make it up tomorrow, he couldn&#39;t do it today,&quot; Travis added.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what is this something special?&quot; Jessica asked to Roger as he took her arm and escorted her as the group followed the host through the restaurant. &quot;Come on... you&#39;ve kept me on edge about this since yesterday at dinner... I&#39;ll explode if we don&#39;t know what is going on soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s something very special,&quot; Roger assured her as they walked along and managed a small kiss on the cheek as they approached one of the larger tables in the restaurant.<br />
<br />
The area was fairly quiet without too many other people present and that left the area they&#39;d been lead to to be fairly quiet, but there was some small amount of background noise. It varied between the clinks of silverware or glasses and some polite conversation between other people that had come to the restaurant. If one didn&#39;t know that it was Valentine&#39;s Day, one would think it just another day of the week. The table they&#39;d been lead to was a long rectangular one, usually one used for when a large family would come in to eat, but since the group had eight people, it made sense.<br />
<br />
The boys all politely offered their bond-mates/girlfriends a seat, and Jessica&#39;s curiosity at what was going on only grew as she was seated next to Sophie on one end, with Sarah and then Abby on the other side. Roger then walked around to sit opposite Jessica with Roland sitting beside him. Travis walked around to sit opposite Sarah and Samson opposite Abby. Jessica wanted to ask on what was going on again, but their host soon set down menus and they were hustled into ordering what they planned to eat. Handling the orders on what to eat and drink were handled quickly and their host/waiter assured them that their food would come out shortly.<br />
<br />
And it was at that time that the boys began to reveal what they&#39;d planned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now... we&#39;re all aware you&#39;re all curious,&quot; Roland said slowly, &quot;as to why we&#39;re all here and why we&#39;re all together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But as said before, we wanted to make it special, as it is Valentine&#39;s Day and there has been a lot we&#39;ve had together that is special,&quot; Travis added.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve known all of you for at least a year,&quot; Roland commented as he looked to Sophie, remembering asking her out at the Valentine&#39;s Dance the previous year.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;ve all been friends with us as well, welcoming us into your &quot;group,&quot; which has been very kind and generous,&quot; Travis added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is why we wanted to do something special,&quot; Samson spoke, &quot;Not just with regards being with our bond-mates, but with our close friends as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
This earned a few blinks as it seemed that a lot of this was rehearsed. This had to be what the boys had been planning over earlier in the week. Each of the boys then produced a large red envelope from inside the suit jackets they were wearing. Each had Sarah&#39;s, Abby&#39;s, Sophie&#39;s, and Jessica&#39;s name written on it, and the cards were then passed across the table to the appropriate recipient. Jessica looked to the others and they shrugged before looking into the envelope. The cards all proved to be the same with a simple love message that the card company provided, but each also included a handwritten note that was more personal.<br />
<br />
Jessica couldn&#39;t help but smile a bit as she read the note that Roger had written. It read: &quot;My dear Jessica Mariana, this card cannot truly express how happy I am to have met you and found love with you. You are warm and kind, and I am very grateful that your parents have accepted me as your bond-mate. The best part is that not only have you provided me with some happiness and love, but that you&#39;ve also helped me meet new people who have proven to be good friends as well. I hope that we may hop together forever, and I hope that the friendships formed... through Animalia Ambassadoria and all our other adventures make things all the more special when it comes time to take each other as mates. I love you, Jessica, and the others love your friendship too. Happy Valentine&#39;s Day.&quot;<br />
<br />
The other cards had similar handwritten messages in them, and they all carried the similar message. That the bonds of friendship between Abby, Sophie, Jessica, and Sarah that had been there before Animalia had helped reinforce and forge friendship between Samson, Travis, Roland, and Roger, which they felt to be welcome and that they hoped that while they might all take one individual mate that the friendships formed and forged wouldn&#39;t be lost, either. It was almost like a group valentine.<br />
<br />
&quot;You boys are so sweet,&quot; Jessica said after a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;d hoped to be able to include Simon and Malice,&quot; Roland answered, &quot;as they&#39;re part of the group too...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Malice does understand,&quot; Sarah assured them, &quot;and is looking forward to the adult party/dinner tomorrow with the hope that Simon can come up from the Police Academy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Happy Valentine&#39;s Day!&quot; the boys said together, with each of them saying their respective girlfriend/bond-mate&#39;s name which Jessica and the girls returned in kind.</p>
