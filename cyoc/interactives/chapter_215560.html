<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She reached into her purse, pulling out both devices; one to program and the other to use. She quickly inputted a few commands into her mobile before putting it back. She swayed her hips over towards the bed again and pointed what looked like a remote at Sharon who stared at it in confusion. Daisha just chuckled at the look her lover had. <br />
<br />
&quot;You want more baby..., You wanna keep this party going? You wanna be pleased and please me like no other?&quot; She asked, running a hand down her body making sure to draw attention to her breasts and hips. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t get enough of you....&quot; Sharon breathed out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Then baby, lemme rock your world.&quot; <br />
<br />
-------<br />
<br />
Shawna stretched out, almost falling off the bed. She had lost track of time with the cutie but god that was an enjoyable time. She could see why girls liked doing it so much. Too bad Claire didn&#39;t have the energy to keep going. She looked adorable though, draped over herself, using her breasts as a pillow. She kept placing kisses, alternating from one side to the other and running a hand over her inner thigh. <br />
<br />
&quot;Damn girl..., you were really pent up huh?&quot; Shawna muttered as she brought the other woman up to plant a small kiss on her lips. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmmmm yeah...., went to that club cause haven&#39;t been lucky in a few months..., mmmmm think I&#39;ll be good for a few good years with how you worked me over...&quot; Claire murmured as she nuzzled her cheek against Shawna&#39;s. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shooooo, happy to help a little lady like you get some fun.&quot; she replied, giving a little squeeze on Clarie&#39;s butt which earned a moan. <br />
<br />
&quot;FUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK YESSSSSSSSSSS....&quot; Came a shout along with the sound of a bed frame slamming against the wall. <br />
<br />
&quot;And here I was about to go see if my friend was done..., well... should probably go see how those two are still able to move, get some water too. You want anything?&quot; Shawna asked as she disentangled herself from Claire and put a blanket over her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just.... tell my roomie to keep it down..., we got work tomorrow....zzzzzz&quot; came the response as she rolled over.<br />
<br />
Shawna nodded and tried to make as little noise as possible to let Claire get some rest. Though what did she just say.... Roomie? That wasn&#39;t right, was it? As she walked though, something was off though. The apartment seemed a little different. A little bigger, a little wider with the floor and the doors were raised up higher. All the photos of the twins were gone too, replaced by some vastly different pictures. <br />
<br />
&quot;....She didn&#39;t.&quot; Shawna muttered as she made a few more hurried steps to the end of the hall and throwing open the door to the main bedroom. <br />
<br />
She was greeted with an arousing sight. Daisha was sitting on the edge of the bed, her large arms wrapped around her partner&#39;s waist as she kept slamming her down on the double ended dildo that they shared. The clap of their bodies colliding was a chorus of pleasure as their moans added to the sound. Daisha must have been busy too before getting into this posistion as the woman&#39;s skin was covered in golden lipstick marks. <br />
<br />
Clearly visible against her dark black skin. <br />
<br />
A flick of her hand and a spank was sent across that delicious ghetto booty which earned another scream. Large hands moved through that thick curly fuzzy hair. Daisha leaned forward to take one of those large breasts, visable even from behind, into her mouth. That strong and toned back was more than enough to keep that back arched just right to let her do this, while a golden rose tattoo sat just above her large butt.<br />
<br />
With one more slam, the two came in tandem, coating the tool and the floor below them in their cum and pausing for a breath before Daisha brought her down into another kiss and giving her another swat on the ass. <br />
<br />
&quot;Turn this ass around..., I wanna see it bounce.&quot; Daisha firmly said as she took large handfuls of the body part, &quot;Make this booty shake for me.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;If you want see it, all you had to do was ask hot momma.&quot; The other woman said, her voice deeper and a bit more husky. <br />
<br />
She spun as ordered and Daisha took up handfuls of her breasts from behind as their hips started to move once more, starting to build a rythm before the haze of lust lifted enough to see that they had a guest. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shawna bae, good to see you...., done already with that little roomie of mine? Wanna join in?&quot; The woman asked, motioning with a finger to come closer. <br />
<br />
&quot;Double team? Mmmm, you&#39;re kinky you know that bae.&quot; Daisha told her, kissing at the woman&#39;s neck. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...., right...., uh, yeah Claire&#39;s resting. Hey uh Sharon, can I talk with my &#39;sis&#39; for just a bit. Maybe go get some water cause you look like you need to rehydrate.&quot; Shawna said, motioning for the door. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do what she says, Sherri. Maybe get me something too while you stretch those legs..., you know you&#39;re gonna need them later.&quot; Daisha whispered in her ear before planting another kiss on her neck. <br />
<br />
Sharon/Sherri moaned but was able to disentangle herself enough to leave. Not before picking up a towel and starting to clean up just a bit. Shawna couldn&#39;t take her eyes off the new black Amazon as she moved. She was just as tall, big and firm as the others and DAMN those legs went for miles. Well all their legs went for miles but she seemed to know how to work them as she walked just right to attract attention. She blew a kiss to her partner on the bed before heading around the doorway. <br />
<br />
&quot;......THE FUCK!?!?&quot; Shawna hissed out after she recovered and moved closer to , &quot;Did you do!?!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I had fun, that&#39;s what I did.&quot; Daisha said, giving a large stretch. Shawna wasn&#39;t sure if the fact she made sure to jut her chest out was on purpose or not. &quot;Poor girl couldn&#39;t keep up with me and wanted more pleasure. Besides, I have a thing you know; was it so wrong? She looks better this way.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I mean.... yeah DAMN she&#39;s a looker...., but her sister!&quot; Shawna hissed out, trying to keep her voice down, &quot;You can&#39;t just break them up into different people; it&#39;s not like you and Dad, they liked each other.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;MMMMM, there&#39;s an idea. How about we reunite them then? We can do that you know.&quot; Daisha said as she stood up grabbing the remote as she walked over putting an arm around her &#39;sister&#39;. &quot;Why just let Sherri have all the fun?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t just do this...&quot; Shawna started before a finger was put on her lips. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh stop, you turned your friends into big black babes too. What was that for? Didn&#39;t want your old friends to lust over your new form, wanted new friends to understand you, some girls to share your bed too?&quot; Daisha breathed out, her free hand starting to trace a circle around Shawna&#39;s stomach with a finger, &quot;What was your plan there? You could have turn them into hunky guys, or other girls but no, you made them like yourself. I saw their profiles when you took me to the device, I know you changed them.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey you can&#39;t turn this back around on...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You like big black babes don&#39;t you Shawna..., come on. You were gonna fuck your friends. Don&#39;t lie to &#39;momma&#39; here, I understand. It&#39;s a thing we share..., and it&#39;s so hot we can do it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just a fantasy I used to have, not something I actually wanted!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s reality. Our reality.&quot; she dangles the remote in front of Shawna&#39;s face, &quot;Admit it, you want that Claire girl to be a big black babe, bouncing her booty all over your lap.... or face. You wanna see her change, you wanna see her get fucked into a new life, come on. Let&#39;s make the sisters get back together. It&#39;s the right, and hot, thing to do.&quot; <br />
<br />
Shawna bit her lip as she thought about it.</p>
