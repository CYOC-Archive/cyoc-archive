<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A shrill alarm jolted me out of my sleep. One of those old school buzzer type alarms (instead of the more pop sounding ones I had on my cell phone). I wake up in a dark room, I can’t make out any features other than the angry red numbers of the old digital clock reading 4:05 – Holy fuck this is the worst dream I’ve ever had! Must be a dream from my past since I haven’t had a clock like that since I was in my mid-20s. Wanting nothing more than to silence the annoyance, I get out of bed and make my way toward the red light, tripping over various unseen debris on the floor, and then desperately pressing every button on the damn thing until it would shut up. Finally it stops and I groggily make my way back to the bed and decide to skip the fuck out of this dream and try to go back to “sleep” in my dream. As I lay there with my eyes closed, waiting for slumber to come and carry me off again, once more the alarm blasts me out of my peace. Shit! Must have pressed the snooze button. Once again I carefully make my way to the alarm, this time finding the proper button to turn it off and breathe a sigh of relief. <br />
<br />
Then it hits me, I really need to take a piss. Fuck it, what do I care if I piss in my dream? So part of me thinks of laying back on the bed and just let the urine flow until I wake up from this horrible dream. But in the back of my mind I can hear a little voice telling me not to, and that I need to get ready for the gym. What? The gym? At 4 in the morning? But somehow it felt right. So instead I blindly find my way to a wall, feeling all over until I find some sort of switch. Nope, that one didn’t do anything, oh nevermind, it was connected to the clock – that’s kinda dumb. I flick it back on and see the flashing 12:00 staring back at me like I should care, and I don’t, because I need to find the bathroom. The light switch next to it was the right one, illuminating the room and I can see it’s an absolutely disorganized mess! I was never this messy in my past, except maybe when I was a teen, but even then my parents got on me constantly to keep it neat. No, this wasn’t my room from the past, I realized. The computer on the desk was too new, the TV was a decent sized flat screen, connected to a game system I’m pretty sure came out only a few years ago. There were posters of wrestlers and sports stars all over the walls, and a few scantily clad women leaning against fancy sports cars. Yeah, this was definitely not my room…<br />
<br />
The urge to pee took precedence right now, however. So I made my way out of the room, finding the bathroom two doors down the hall, and I flick on the light there and make a bee line to the toilet, lifting the lid, I should have realized things were massively different when I saw my arm, but I was too focused on the task at hand. No, it wasn’t until I dropped these basketball shorts that I fully realized that something had definitely changed… Because there in my thicker hand attached to a wide forearm connected to a sizable bicep was a dick that was certainly not mine. For one, I was cut where this dick was clearly not! And for two, this cock dwarfed my real dick in both width and length, and it wasn’t even fully hard, only a slight semi likely a “pee hardon”. Speaking of, I let the stream flow and was jolted even more awake as urine flew everywhere. What the fuck! I then realized the hood, er foreskin was in the way. I forced myself to stop with the stream and rolled the foreskin back, finding it was sort of stay in place slightly if I kept it behind my new thick mushroom tip. Carefully I started to urinate again, and successfully emptied my bladder, shaking off the last few dribbles and allowing the foreskin to roll back over the tip. <br />
<br />
A devious thought entered my mind, I do sometimes have these dreams where I find myself in a stranger’s body, and sometimes they are even uncut like I was now. I always loved to play with the foreskin until I blew a load, and I was keen to find out what it was like once again. I started to manipulate the foreskin, making sure to feel the sensitivity of my exposed mushroom, which sent shivers all down my body.<br />
<br />
I’m sure I had a big dopey smile on my face as I slowly but deliberately jacked this new monster uncut dick in one hand and felt up my new lemon sized balls with the other. Damn this feels amazing! I can feel the precum mix with the leftover urine inside my foreskin, making it very slick and incredibly erotic. In a matter of minutes my new cock grew a full ten inches by my estimation, perhaps more, and so thick I could barely get my hand all the way around. <br />
<br />
By this point, I stopped playing with my balls because I had to use both hands to not only keep this heavy beast up, but to satisfactorily continue to jack it. My soft moans were quickly becoming hyper sexual grunts and my breath was becoming more shallow and my pulse beat faster and faster. I could feel my skin flush from my chest up to my face as I stopped breathing until… <br />
<br />
“Oh FUCK!” I shouted in a deep guttural moan. <br />
<br />
Shot after shot aimed strait into the unflushed toilet, each heavy glob of baby batter quickly sinking to the bottom of the bowl, and as it dissipated, the urine became more cloudy – and I was still shooting! A full half minute or more, and what felt like eight or ten ounces later, I was finally spent. Some leftover cum oozed down the side of my massive dong, which more remained within the foreskin. I kept moving the foreskin back and forth, addicted to the incredible pleasure it was giving me now. Gradually, my beast softened, shrinking maybe two inches in length and perhaps twice as much in thickness, still looking like an obscene horse cock hanging from my pelvis. Oh shit! What if that’s what this dream is? The crazy ass dream where I have an animal cock? No, that can’t be it, this looks like a human cock, just way too big. <br />
<br />
It was then I realized how close I was to the toilet bowl, meaning I was actually pretty short, making this cock look even more massive on me. It was also then I realized I had no shirt on, and my body… Well it definitely wasn’t my body. No, this dream body of mine was hairless on the chest, slightly tanned, and had large untoned pecs and a flat stomach with a large waist. I had a V shape, definitely, just I wasn’t ripped or anything. I also had something else that told me for certain this wasn’t my body. On my right pec was a tattoo that looked like some sort of crest, I couldn’t tell of what exactly right then and on my left bicep was a typical tribal tattoo looking like intertwined lightning bolts. <br />
<br />
Putting the monster back in my shorts and flushing the toilet, I made my way to wash my hands. It was when I looked in the mirror finally I realized just how much I had changed. Staring back at me was a baby-faced kid with buzzed light brown or dark blond hair and the most stunningly blue eyes I had ever seen outside of the movies. He had absolutely no facial hair, and something tells me he couldn’t really grow much anyway judging by the few wisps under his nose and hardly any aside from where sideburns would be. His nose was strong and angular with a slight upturn at the tip, and his teeth were bright white and perfectly straight except for the right canine being slightly in front of the teeth near it but hardly noticeable. His complexion, despite looking like he should be in high school still (by the face, certainly not by the body or by the cock) was clear and blemish free, or even scar free, even though his cheeks were slightly rounded due to some facial fat that would probably always be there even when he’s older. I better took in the sight of my torso in the mirror and saw what looked like a junior powerlifter – you know, muscular and solid, but a little chubby looking. The type of kid that could probably bench over 300 and squat over 500, but looks like he can’t run a mile without getting winded. He had the look of a high school offensive lineman. I flexed these new biceps, letting the muscled pop up and down, feeling myself get a bit giddy and turned on by it too. I smiled and chuckled to myself and I swear I almost came again seeing this short but very handsome beefy kid looking right back at me, with those thick arms and solid chest fully on display for my personal pleasure. Hmm… hmm… hmmmmm…<br />
<br />
OK, I’ve wasted enough time, I need to get to the gym right? Might as well continue living out this dream until I wake up like I would normally… Even though I usually wake up after I shoot a load, but hey, I ain’t complaining. I went back to my room and found some clean compression shorts, and put together the rest of a workout outfit. A tight black T-shirt stretched across my massive teen muscles, basketball shorts I was wearing before (they didn’t smell bad to me at least) and some black Nike socks with some older worn out cross trainers I found discarded on the floor – size 10. Out of the corner of my eye, I spotted what looked like car keys and a wallet. The insignia on the keys for the car was Dodge. In my wallet I found an ID from another state – Iowa, with the name Tyler Bates (yeah yeah, I’m sure he gets the jokes plenty for that last name already) and the date of birth showing (if time hadn’t changed in this dream) I was now 19 as of a week ago. There was a five in the wallet along with a bank card for a local credit union I didn’t recognize. Blonde hair, blue eyes, organ donor, and only 5’5” tall, at least when this ID was issued last year, and near as I can tell, I doubt it’s much taller since. The weight on the ID was 205 lbs, but the face looked a little chubbier in the ID picture, so I’m guessing he’s lost some weight since then. <br />
<br />
Damn, this kid easily weighs at least as much as I did, and he’s over a half a foot shorter. But he’d definitely way more muscular than I had ever been, and probably even more toned than I was, sadly. Attached to the keychain was a little barcode card that said “24/7 Fitness”. I found a cell phone charging next to the keys, and thankfully it had a face lock, so I opened it and put in the name of the gym and found out it was only a couple of miles away – and it looks like I live in a somewhat rural area too. <br />
<br />
Somehow by memory I know where the kitchen is, where I make up a pre workout drink, and run into an older lady sitting in the living room asleep with the TV up fairly loud. Thank God! I would hate to have to deal with the embarrassment of her maybe hearing my orgasm earlier – I thought to myself as I felt my new cock jump slightly, taunting me to jack it again. I pat it down – maybe later I think to myself, in the gym showers. Outside, I find my new truck apparently, well new to me, since it looks to be an early 2000s Ram, either black or dark blue, I can’t tell in the dim light from the double wide trailer patio. I let the directions run from the map app on the phone and make my way to the gym to pump up this nice beefy teen body I have now!</p>
