<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan was jumping with joy lately; due to one simple reason. His parents had decided to take a relaxing vacation together, visiting Hawaii for a good ole fashioned fun in the sun type of trip. Yet, they went a bit differently this time. Due to how expensive tickets were, and how sub middle class his family was, they couldn&#39;t actually afford tickets for the both of them. It was Dan who suggested they leave his mother&#39;s body behind so they only had to pay for one person; a suggestion which they happily took. Smirking, Dan had waved them goodbye when they left for the airport a few days ago. A big mistake.<br />
<br />
His parents had planned on staying overseas for a solid two weeks, plenty of time for Dan to get what he wanted, as he snuck over to his parents room. Laying on their bed was his mother&#39;s defenseless body, idly waiting as if for him. &quot;We&#39;ve been waiting a long time for this, haven&#39;t we?&quot; He asked, waltzing over and sitting on the end of the bed. This made the matress shake and caused his mother&#39;s body to jiggle sensually. Dan&#39;s plan was finally coming to fruition; with his parents gone, he could finally lose his virginity, and gain a lover in the process.<br />
<br />
He had been hiding his lust for his mother for years, and with the dullahan incident he finally had the means to get it. &quot;Look at you, all peaceful and alone.&quot; He cooed, crawling over to the milf body. Being only 39, his mother took great care of herself; huge boobs and wide hips with a big butt, her 6 foot tall body was better than any model&#39;s. And now, it was about to take its son&#39;s virginity involuntarily. <br />
<br />
Cuddling up to the headless milf, Dan nuzzled her boobs with his head, loving the fragrant smell of her blouse. He couldn&#39;t wait to feel those nips in his mouth, as he grinded his crotch against her leg. Meanwhile, Dan&#39;s mother in Hawaii widened her eyes at feeling something weird against her body. &quot;Honey?&quot; She called out to her husband from her spot on the beach towel, though her voice wasn&#39;t loud enough to be heard by her husband chatting up the guy working the beach stand.<br />
<br />
Kissing his mother&#39;s large breasts, Dan began to slip her jeans and blouse off of her plump body, revealing the tight underwear pressing into her meat. Squeezing her slightly chubby tummy, Dan started rubbing between her thighs, getting her body into the mood to let him enter her. Dan&#39;s mother began to get really worried, however; she began to sweat from all the groping and stimulating of her body thousands of miles away. &quot;Honey, please get over here!&quot; She shouted, not noticing her husband had left his spot to go to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Now being nude himself, Dan rubs his dick all over his mother&#39;s body, as if marking it as his woman. Licking her soft soles and grabbing her tits, she created a stain on her white panties. Knowing that it was the sign she wanted him inside now, Dan removed her bra and slid the panties down her shapely legs, angling himself and aiming perfectly at the moist cunt. Unable to wait any longer, Dan pushed forward, poking his tip at her entrance before pushing inside. Her inner walls tightened around his rod, glad to have it inside. Back in Hawaii, Dan&#39;s mother gasped at feeling something penetrate her pussy. She tried not to seem too suspicious right now, with her husband still in the restroom; but she sure was anxious for him to come back and help.<br />
<br />
Clutching the maternal body tightly, Dan pressed his hips against hers for maximum reach. Surprisingly enough, he filled up her cunt perfectly; further evidence to him that this was meant to be. Finally moving his hips back and forth, Dan felt his mother&#39;s body autonomously twist and tighten around his dick, feeling the pleasure from it. &quot;Yes, oh god yes!&quot; He shouted, going faster and faster, grabbing her tits and placing both her nipples in his mouth. &quot;Stop, please....&quot; His mother pleaded in Hawaii, not knowing who it was doing this to her, but had an inkling of who. &quot;This isn&#39;t right....&quot;<br />
<br />
Going with a primal lust, Dan mated with his mother&#39;s headless body with such speed, groping every part of her he could reach as he kept going in and out. After plenty of time, he felt her snatch tighten immensely, as his tip poked a certain part. &quot;Her womb....&quot; He whispered, having made contact with her cervix. Smiling, he kept thrusting forcefully until finally poking her cervix once again and painting the inside white with his virile seed. Her pussy climaxed as well, leaking lots of sex juice all over where they were connected. Panting, Dan finally claimed her body as his woman, only for him to fuck and cum inside now. With that in mind, he got back to work thrusting, aiming to release even more cum inside her.<br />
<br />
Dan&#39;s mother cried at feeling her body being raped so shamelessly, and by her own son no less. It didn&#39;t get any better as she felt his tip poke her cervix. &quot;No...no not that...please...&quot; She sobbed, unable to stop it as she felt the warm sperm get pumped into her womb. Tears streaming down her cheeks, she had to suffer for another ten minutes, getting another three loads blown into her womb. Finally, her husband came back to the towel, apologizing for having to go number two. He had a confused look on his face at seeing his wife&#39;s head looking so distraught.<br />
<br />
Laying atop his dominated parent, Dan sighed and kissed the top of her neck stump. &quot;I had such a good time with you,&quot; he said, grabbing her ass. &quot;What say we blow this joint and get us a place where we can be alone together uninterrupted?&quot; With no answer from her body, Dan got her redressed, but place a dildo in her cunt to plug her up and make sure no cum dripped out. Grabbing a few suitcases, Dan packed up all of his mother&#39;s clothes, shoes and jewelry (except for head jewelry), then did the same with his own possessions, bringing them out to his car. Carrying his mother&#39;s body bridal style down to his car, Dan hopped in the driver&#39;s side, groping her boobs. &quot;I love you, honey.&quot; He said, driving away to leave town, taking his mother&#39;s headless body with him. &quot;At least I locked the house for them.&quot; He chuckled.</p>
