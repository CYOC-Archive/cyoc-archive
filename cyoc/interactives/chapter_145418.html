<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She stood, rather paralyzed, in front of the mirror, taking it all in. The fangs. The claws. The incongruous strain on her panties, and the lilac blush centered around her crotch. Her body still ached, and her guts still felt like they’d been unceremoniously yanked out of her, jammed into a blender, pulverized, and then poured back inside. She sat down on the side of the tub and sighed. She wasn’t exactly thrilled about the changes - turning purple and growing a dick weren’t exactly things she’d ever really considered before. And she knew that she was far from the end. If she was really turning into Xecanthys, she’d end up completely male, completely purple, and with an excellent set of horns. Which would make it pretty much impossible to continue her life in the way she’d known it before. She was an elementary school administrator. Looking like a literal demon seemed fundamentally incompatible.<br />
<br />
But the hooded figure had told her to get ready for an adventure. She wasn’t going to go back to her old job, was she? <br />
<br />
As she pondered, her guts continued to churn painfully. And then something shifted suddenly. She didn’t think too hard about it, but the passing thought crossed her mind that it was probably the death throes of her uterus. She glanced down to where the pain had been centered, and noticed that a trail of soft purple hair had ascended from her crotch to her belly button. And the lilac seemed to be spreading. <br />
<br />
Another wave of pain coursed through her. Clutching the bathroom countertop, she watched in horror as her abs involuntarily flexed and relaxed and flexed and relaxed in quick and incessant succession, building in tone and bulk. Her defined and feminine waist was in the process of disappearing before her. But she felt stronger than she’d ever felt before. The lilac tint followed soon after, leaving her with a lithe, strong, purple, and masculine abdomen.<br />
<br />
Then the pulsating sensation moved up. Her pectoral muscles, well-protected underneath her boobs, began to twitch. As the muscle strengthened, the fat seemed to melt away, the skin tightening across her flattening chest. <br />
<br />
She almost had to laugh - it kinda looked like one of those novelty swimsuits. Her limbs and head were still hers - flesh toned and female.<br />
<br />
It didn’t last long. <br />
<br />
The lilac change surged ahead, overtaking the rest of her skin. <br />
She groaned as her shoulders widened slightly and her hips crunched inwards. It felt like her bones were on fire. <br />
Then her limbs began the muscle-building process. It started at the shoulders, moving down from there. Not even her hands were spared. Her clawed fingers had kept their dark eggplant color, fading smoothly to blend with the lilac at her knuckles, but the hand itself had grown just a larger. <br />
<br />
The same thing happened to her feet, but she was too busy staring herself in the face to notice. Her long hair had taken on a purple color, and her face was beginning to look a little less like hers. It was especially surreal to watch her familiar, albeit purple, features reform into something totally different. Her round and pouty lips thinned into a wily smirk. Her chubby cheeks practically caved in as her skull warped - cheekbones and jawline sharpening, a subtle brow ridge rising. An itch crawled across her cheeks as the follicles thickened and left her with a purpley five-o-clock shadow. <br />
<br />
She gasped as her warm brown iris began to fade away, followed by the pupils. She could still see just fine through the blank white eyes, but it was certainly surreal. <br />
<br />
As was the gasp. She touched her throat and felt an adam’s apple. <br />
<br />
“What the fuck?” She whispered. It was exactly the voice she’d imagined Xecanthys having - still pretty high, but not feminine. Soft-spoken but with a sharp edge to the words. <br />
<br />
But things weren’t done. Xecanthys was a half-demon and she didn’t have the horns or the tail to show for it. <br />
<br />
She shouldn’t have had that thought. It felt like somebody was trying to hammer nails into her forehead from the inside. Two lumps began to form underneath the skin. Before too long, they broke through. And not long after that, complete ram-like horns spiraled out of her head, curling around her pointed ears.<br />
<br />
Then her underwear began to feel even tighter. The striped panties were already strained by the first appendage, and a second seemed like a lot to ask. She watched in the mirror as a bulge began to grow from her tailbone, and winced when the underwear gave out. Her tail was almost five feet long, smooth, and well-muscled. It came to a wickedly sharp spade tip. <br />
<br />
The pervasive ache that had followed her from the con finally faded. It was like an immense weight had been lifted. <br />
<br />
She looked down once more to see a body that wasn’t hers. It was jarring, but it was a beautiful body. Strong, but lithe and catlike, with a flawless lilac complexion and lovely dark purple hair. Maybe it wasn’t so bad. But she’d need to find something to wear. <br />
<br />
Just as she reached for a towel, somebody knocked on the door.</p>
