<br />
At the old cabin just outside of the city limits, a light can be seen through the window, where Adam, the older brother of Andrew, was bring new hospital equipment&#39;s, along with foods he was able to gather along the way. He hadn&#39;t seen the doctor or his youngest brother Andrew few days ago, fearing that Andrew must have decided to follow his silly dreams again; when he find him, he was going to give him a piece of his mind. As he putting away the last equipment in the basement, he went upstairs only to see the hotel clerk and also the middle-child sibling Mary just waiting for him with a rather piss-off expression. Now Adam had some anger issue, but his sister was the one thing in the world he dares not to make enemy with.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where in the hell have you been Adam!? We have a problem on our hands and you wouldn&#39;t even answer my calls for the last few ours!&quot; Adam take a few steps back just from the volume of his sister tone before calming responding back to her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now Mary, you know as I do that I sometime don&#39;t carry the phone with me, which I know that is something I got to fix. But What is this problem your talking about? Is it related to Andrew?&quot; His sister march toward him till she was inch&#39;s close to him, then bring out a picture of what suppose to be a creature walking through the wood.. expect it kind a look like a were-gorilla. &quot;Wh...Where did you get this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A visitor just told me that someone had got a picture of either you or Andrew and now there a chance&#39;s the people would be starting looking for us. So how did this happen? You were suppose to be aware of your surrounding, this is something we always do we when travel through the woods.&quot; His sister was right on that; since they came to Moon Lake, they new that if people find out there is a new kind of weres in town, fearing that they may never to be able to leave town again if found out. However, since the day they came upon Doctor Henry Wendz, they were given more reason to not be found out by the people. <br />
<br />
Since their time living with Henry, He was indeed ego-center, but he had theories and methods that were far beyond any professional doctors weren&#39;t able to accomplish or even figure out how to do make, expect Henry himself. Though he was, as he said &quot;gifted&quot;, he refuse to take the responsible of being the head of the genetic and medical center of the hospital and instead focus on his work alone. Few years ago Kathy Tucker soon became the new head came and Henry decided to work under her since the two had the common new dream of helping people, both humans and were-beasts. His greatest achievements was the new develop were-species and even gender changing serums, but his testing on ex-con prisoners was a question of his morals, but he had his heart on the good of people. It was when the hospital began refusing to do any more research&#39;s on his theories, he came upon with a shocking discovery of both the hospital and the town itself &quot;dark side&quot;. He began taking stuff from the labs, but he was quickly discover his action and label him a theft. Since that day, we help out the doc with his research while at the same time hide ourselves from the media and the town people.<br />
<br />
Getting a closer look of the photo, he soon discover what it was.<br />
<br />
&quot;That picture doesn&#39;t look like me; It look like this picture was from the mountain side, I mostly travel close to the lake to the city. It must have been Andrew looking for his &quot;dream&quot; girl again. I fear that this dream of him is going to get him into trouble. Mary agree with Adam, but this was kind of her fault for not support Andrew for the last few days.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was hard for him to find love again after we return back to the U.S.A; his girlfriend witness seeing him transform and even crazy enough attempt to kill him out of fear. We barely manage to get out of town before the mobs could capture us, but since then he was mostly in the dump. After meeting Henry and staying here for over a few months, Andrew was still hear-broken most of the time, till one day he got this &quot;dream&quot; that his dream girl was here and began looking for her... I should have watch over him and realize how serious he was about this, other wise...&quot; Adam got closer to his sister and place both hands on her shoulder to her calm.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is not your fault, it was ours. If I had keep an eye on him while you were at work, Then no one would have caught a picture of him, or that he and the doctor would have been gone so long...&quot; moment when Mary heard that, she quickly look at Adam with concern look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, both Henry and Andrew are gone? When did you last seen them!?&quot; But just before Adam could answer, the door slammed hard and coming in was a exhausted Andrew as he fell to the floor. The two quickly run toward Andrew, Mary carry Andrew upper body to have a better look on him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god Andrew!  What happen to you, and where is Henry!?&quot; Andrew quickly lifted his body up on his two feet, need a few second to breath in calming before he could speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys, we have a situation...&quot;<br />
<br />
As Andrew told the event that had transpire from few days to today, both Adam and Mary were quick shock of this. Mary was the first to speak at anger.<br />
<br />
&quot;What were you thinking!? Not only did you risk yourself, you even let Henry get capture by them and who knows what they will do to him, and all this for some guy you think is your dream girl!? Don&#39;t you think this is insane!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know how it sound, but it true! The serum Henry is going to help this person become what he wanted to become and...&quot; Mary interrupted Andrew before he could even make another word.<br />
<br />
&quot;And thus you actually made Henry to turn some poor guy into a girl! Andrew, it was a dream, a stupid dream! I&#39;m sorry what happen to you and we feel bad about it as well, but your 15 years old and you should realize that you can&#39;t just force people into something else all over a dream. This person may not even love you if he become a woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary...&quot; Adam said softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not now Adam! Anyway, now we got to get out of here before they get the information from Henry and come here.&quot; Andrew disagree with that idea and speak back.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! we got to save Henry; it my fault that he got caught and we to get him out of there.&quot; Just as Mary was about to speak back, Adam step forward place his hand on Mary to keep her calm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Andrew, we don&#39;t need to do anything.&quot; The two were confuse by his statement and listen to get a better understanding of his meaning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Henry had a feeling that he would get caught, and that way he had a &quot;plan&quot; to escape if he was ever capture or found.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean he had a plan?&quot; Andrew spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;He didn&#39;t want us to save him, else it could result us getting found as well.  So that why he brought his &quot;last resort&quot; with him.&quot;</p>
