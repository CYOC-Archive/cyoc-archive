<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was a crash in the bedroom, sounded like something being dropped. Cole was certainly having a tantrum about something Nate or Aidan had done.<br />
<br />
Christian lowered his phone from his ear and looked at the screen - DISCONNECTED - in red letters, with the redial icon in a green circle. He thought about pressing it and asking those two for an explanation. Aidan was level headed but could be a little excitable sometimes, but Nate was usually the mature one. This wasn&#39;t like him to just hang up like that. Sounded like he dialed something though... maybe he dropped the phone? Christian&#39;s thoughts were interrupted by the sound of Cole slamming his closet door and swearing loudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok man I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on but you are clearly pissed about something and I&#39;m worried. I&#39;m coming in.&quot; Christian used his best firm but caring tone, hoping the intrusion would be forgiven. Pressing his shoulder to the door he opened it in a rush, just in case Cole tried to stop him. Then he took in the scene in the room and his entire mental train came to a halt, hitting the brick wall of the scene in front of him. Piece by piece he took it in.<br />
<br />
First the normally clean room was a shambles, but scattered all over the floor were white plastic little squares that looked like, yes indeed they were diapers. Christian gaped for a moment at all of them spilling out of the drawer that was on the floor, dumped in front of the chest Cole stood next to. Then he noticed Cole.<br />
<br />
He looked different. Slightly younger, skin a little smoother, hair a little thicker and his body certainly looked healthier because Christian could see all of him. He was practically naked for some reason, and wearing what looked like a puffy white diaper. He stared at Cole&#39;s crotch, not really knowing what to say all that came out of his throat was a dry &quot;Uh...&quot; and he trailed off. Cole put both hands in front of himself trying to hide.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t take it off. All my clothes are diapers now. I don&#39;t know what happened but... I wear diapers now...&quot; Cole blurted then he too trailed off. Realizing what he just said, for the first time. A small smile twitched at the corners of his mouth. He thought about how silly it was that he wears diapers, but it was part of him, and he couldn&#39;t get rid of it, and he had to admit he actually liked it the more the he thought it over. He let go then, and just laughed. Grabbing a hand full of his plastic fluffy crotch he tugged at it and enjoyed the feeling, soft and smooth and cool.<br />
<br />
Christian snorted and then laughed too. They both laughed for a solid ten seconds. Christian wiped tears from the corner of his eyes and took a step in to the room and then said &quot;Dude you had me worried. I thought this was some kind of mental breakdown, not a hazing stunt. You look adorable in your diaper by the way. Where did you get so many?&quot; Christian gestured around the room.<br />
<br />
Immediately Cole&#39;s smile faded. Christian thought this was a joke. Well, it made sense right? What had happened was impossible so obviously Christian wouldn&#39;t believe it. &quot;Its not a joke. I wear diapers. I can&#39;t take it off. Here look.&quot; Cole said, pulling harder, trying to show that it was stuck fast. He was trapped, padding and plastic imprisoned him. It was no good though, Christian just gaped. His  eyebrows knit together in confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ow. What the hell.&quot; Christian said, quickly pulling at the front of his own pants. Cole saw it and knew something was up, it wasn&#39;t confusion on Christian&#39;s face. Something was happening. Oh no. He immediately knew what it was when Christian&#39;s pants and shirt all at once seemed to unravel and fall to the floor, pulling back together in mid-fall, forming two white diapers that hit the ground with a little &quot;pap pap&quot; sound. Christian stood naked, the source of the discomfort on display: He had a rock hard erection pointing straight at the ceiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the...&quot; was all he got out before he moaned, feeling the sensation of his change begin. His skin turning white, slowly spreading down his cock creeping over his balls and up between his legs; he felt it like a cool breeze stretching his skin taught, turning it slick and plastic. He looked down to see his white hard cock press in to his abdomen, swelling larger, he grunted feeling himself grow and stretch against his plastic flesh. Behind him the cool feeling continued over his butt pulling upward, moving gentle and steady over his hips to join the spreading plastic at the front of him.<br />
<br />
For a moment he appeared to be wearing white shiny underwear, smooth and soft, broken only by a long bulge in the front where his dick swelled and pressed to him. Then Christian let out an almost orgasmic sigh as he felt himself turn to cottony padding, swelling and pushing against his new plastic skin. It begin to swell in order to accommodate his grown padding, spreading down and fluffing up his slick diaper. It pushed hard against his hips, forcing him to adjust his stance, releasing the pent up flow of padding to spread up his ass. He felt little tapes pop in to place at his hip then, and a final moan of ecstasy feeling his now cottony dick fully transformed in to fluffy padding, his skin become plastic, and his transformation was complete. The sensations fading out as easily as they had begun, he was left standing there, gaping at himself.<br />
<br />
The voice came to him then. His own voice in his head, and it told him he wanted to wear and use diapers. He agreed with it, of course, it was him and he always agreed with himself. He did want this, but his shock at what happened overwhelmed him for the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck?!&quot; he managed to blurt it out, grabbing a handful of his crotch just like he had seen Cole do a few seconds ago. &quot;Im... I have a... What?&quot; he was confused, noticed his own clothes had turned to diapers when they fell off, and suddenly connected that he was surrounded by them. Cole&#39;s whole room was full of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you do this?&quot; He said, he placed his flat palm on his left butt cheek, feeling the softness of it. Smelling the slightly acrid plastic perfume. His other hand moved from his crotch to his right cheek, pressing in to it. He felt... good? He liked it. Why was he mad? This was nice.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. I didn&#39;t. I swear. It happened to me too. I think it was something to do with Aidan and Nate. Go check out your room, it&#39;s probably full of diapers now too.&quot; Cole said calmly. He was fascinated by the transformation he had just witnessed but at the same time he couldn&#39;t shake a new thought in his head: Christian looked so good in his diaper. It was white and fluffy and the way it bulged right between his legs just looked so adorable, he wanted to feel it, to play with it. What was happening to him? He wasn&#39;t like this before but now, this was all new and he had to admit to himself he was loving it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Let&#39;s go look at my room.&quot; Christian turned, his diaper crinkling, and he took a few awkward steps then moved his hips to compensate for his new padding and waddled slightly out of Coles room. Cole, eager to keep looking at his rounded shiny butt followed close behind, barely resisting the urge to spank it.</p>
