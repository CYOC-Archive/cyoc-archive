<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jessie drove to the dorm, leaving her stuff in the car as she headed inside.  Almost instantly she was greeted with the bad pick-up lines and cat calls of her dorm mates.  Face flushing with a mix of embarassment and anger, she walked up to the door marked RA, and pounded.<br />
<br />
The door opened, a sleepy eyed man, probably a senior in his twenties stood on the other side.  He stared down in confusion for a moment, then shook his head.  &quot;Sorry, I think you have the wrong room.  Who're you looking for, I can tell...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessie cut him off short as she shoved the paper in his face.  As he read it she took time to look him over.  He was tall, probably 6'3&quot;, making him a good foot taller than herself.  His pitch black hair was cropped in a buzz cut, showing a square jaw with a few days stubble, and bright blue eyes.  His body was all lean muscle, she also noticed with a bit of a blush, that he was only wearing boxers, and his morning buldge was quite visable through the thin fabric.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see..&quot;  He lowered the paper to his side, and motioned her in.  &quot;Come on in and we'll work this out.&quot;  She followed him inside, watching him as he pulled on a pair of jeans, still leaving his torso bare, scratching his chest the the light pelt of fur.<br />
<br />
Jessie looked away, trying to gather herself.  &quot;If it's possible, I'd like a singl...&quot;  She turned just in time to get hit in the face with a blast of silver powder.  She tried to cough, to back away, but her body remained frozen in place.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, it's easier to work when the subject's not moving around.&quot;  He waved his hand in front of her mouth, releasing that part of her.  &quot;Now, few questions.  IT says here..&quot;  He pointed to a spot on the letter. &quot;You would do anything for a chance to study magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.  But why am....&quot;  The RA waved his hand by her mouth again, cutting her off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just had to make sure.  So here's how it's going to work.  The dorm has rules, the school has rules.  You agreed to follow those rules.&quot;  He began to work at her clothes pulling them off her rather gently, but with no sexuality to it, more like someone unwrapping a loaf of bread.. or a peice of meat.  &quot;You can call me Tim by the way.  Since I'm going to be your RA for a year, considering you stay.&quot;  Pulling off more of her clothes he walked around her, examining her.  &quot;So the main rule is, no girls in the dorm for longer than 10 minutes at a time.  So this letter you gave me says I have to fix this.&quot;  He removed the last of her clothing, folding it neatly on the bed.  HE walked over to a shelf, pulling off a vial of red liquid and a paint brush.  Pulling the stopper off the liquid, he dipped in the paint brush and began to draw on her body.  Strange symbols and patterns.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, while you are at this school, living at this dorm, you're going to be a guy.  Hell, maybe you'll like it and want to stay this way.  Maybe a spot will open in the female dorm and they'll move you.  I've seen it happen both ways.&quot;  Jessie tried to shudder as the cold liquid settled on her skin, but the spell still kept her paralyzed.  &quot;Only down side is, it's against school regulations to mess with what's up here.&quot;  He tapped her on the head with the end of the paint brush.  &quot;So you might have some problems acting like a guy, but the hormones will help out after a bit.  Also, there's the problem, that right now if you like guys, you still will, if you like girls, you still will.  So, judging by how you reacted to me, you're going to be a gay guy, or at lease bisexual.  Don't worry, we have quite a few in the dorm.&quot;  He stopped by a tattoo she had on her shoulder, a fairy and shook his head, making a few brush strokes over it.<br />
<br />
He stepped back, looking her over, making a few last marks.  Nodding to himself he grabbed another handful of silvery powder and blew it at her, then began chanting.  He stepped aside, letting her have full view of the body length mirror on the closet door.  She stared wide-eyed as he body began to stretch taller, almost making her look like a twig, she halted at about six feet, a whole nine inches added to her height.  Her breasts began to flatten against her chest, nipple shrinking in diameter from half dollars to quarters to dimes, looking like puberty in reverse, except her sparse shaved body hair didn't vanish, it began to grow out a little more.<br />
<br />
It was then she felt a tugging between her legs, and when she looked saw an empty sack of flesh growing between her legs, looking like a withered balloon.  With a short gab like being kicked she felt it suddenly pop out as something dropped into it, then another jab as a second fell in.  Then her mind finally grasped it, balls, they  were her balls.  The continued to grow, stopping, she noticed with a bit of pride, on the above average side.  Her, clit, which had migrated to just above the sac, was throbbing and swelling, veins snaking along it as it took on a familiar tube shape, the head becoming more defined.  It stopped growing, but began to become erect, filling out to a hard eight inches.  They weight of the flesh was odd, but at the same time, pleasant.<br />
<br />
Her body then began to widen, shoulders becoming broader, as she began to fill out with muscle.  She looked like one of those scrawny geeky kids, but then the muscle began to tone, and define itself, giving her a lithe physique.  Her body hair thickened a bit more, giving a good coating on her fore arms and legs, her thicker pubes pushing a trail up to her belly button.  A very light coating of fuzz forming around her nipples and between her newly formed pecs.  The tattoo on her shoulder began to move like water, becoming a tribal band design that circled her bicep.<br />
<br />
The changes then moved up to her face, her jaw filling out and becoming more square, a weeks worth of dark blond stubble defining her jaw line even more. Her button nose became a little less dainty.  Her whole look going from cute girl, to the boy next door with only a few alterations.  In fact she would be able to call the guy she was looking at in the mirror her brother with ease.<br />
<br />
Tim moved back to the shelf, and pulled of a pair of scissors and a razor, chanting some words, they flew out to work on their own. Her long hair was cut down to only two inches in length, and somehow spiked up by the scissors as they worked, the cut locks vanishing before they hit the floor.  The razor glided along her jaw, shaving off everything except for the patch of facial hair on her chin.  Once done they returned to the shelf.<br />
<br />
Tim by know had sat down in his desk chair, just watching with a slight fascination.  &quot;I always love watching this.&quot;  He stood up and walked over to Jessie, waving his hand in front of the new young man.  Finding himself released from the paralyzation, Jessie did the first thing that cam to his mind, he punched Tim right across the jaw.  Tim's head snapped to the side, but he remained up, easily catching the second punch.  Staring at Tim, Jessie then did the second thing that came to his mind and kissed him, which he also found diverted.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's the hormone change, you'll get used to it.  Just try not to get too emotional over the next few days.&quot;  Tim walked back over to his chair and sat down, nursing his jaw.<br />
<br />
&quot;You shouldn't have made me so strong, but I do like how I look..&quot;  Jessie looked back over to Tim who was just shaking his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did nothing, I just altered fate.  This is how you would have turned out if born a guy, that's all.  It's the easiest way to do this sort of magic.  But you'll learn that when classes start.&quot;  Tim looked over his new charge, and Jessie certainly felt the lack of the attraction he had shown for his female body.  &quot;Well, you should get dressed.  The spell altered what possessions you brought with you, too.  So all your clothes should fit, and your personal stuff should be more suited to a guy as well.  Your roommate is waiting for you, try not to hit him, he might not be as understanding.  As for kissing him, I haven't got a read on him yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim shrugged and Jessie felt heat enter his cheeks.  Hurriedly he began pulling on his clothes which had become a pair of guys jeans, so sneakers and a sleeveless black tee that showed off his tattoo.</p>
