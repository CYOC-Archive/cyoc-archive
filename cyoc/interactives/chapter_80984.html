<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Erin examined the remote more, wondering what all the other buttons did. They were all labelled with letters <br />
or shapes, making about as much sense as when he used it to become 30. He decided that he'd get around to the <br />
other buttons some other time, wanting to get older again. Besides, chances are that one of the buttons could <br />
make him younger, right? He clicked the AP button again, and started to decide just how old he wanted to get. <br />
5 years older. That would make him the same age as his dad and step-mom. No, that's not high enough at all. <br />
Another 10 years would make him 40 years old, even older than his uncle. No, he was in the mood for an extreme <br />
change. Then the magic number came to mind. He entered the number 30 into the remote, turned it towards him <br />
and pressed enter. He was going to double his age again, becoming even older than his grandfather. He was <br />
excited and stripped out of his clothes again, not wanted to ruin them. <br />
<br />
Running upstairs, Erin wanted to watch this change in his parent's full length mirror. By the time he reached <br />
it, he was already 35 years old. Other than the grey hair multiplying in his long beard and hair, and the <br />
lines slowly spreading around his eyes, he didn't seem that much different. It wasn't until he reached 40 that <br />
the first major change occurred. He started to put on weight, filling up his body like someone pumped gas into <br />
him. He certainly wasn't expecting to get fatter, having such a quick metabolism, but it looked like it <br />
practically slowed to a halt in his 40s. He rubbed his expanding belly, finding it oddly comforting. When he <br />
reached 45, he noticed his hairline was starting to recede, albeit his hair length didn't. He laughed at his <br />
reflection, Deep lines wrinkling his face and not disappearing. He looked like an aging hippy now, the <br />
majority of his hair a dark grey colour. Passing into his 50s, his eyesight was starting to deteriorate. He <br />
had to squint to keep everything looking clear. His body was still expanding, his large belly sagging <br />
downwards and hiding his cock, no longer functional for sex without some Viagra. His beard grew slightly <br />
longer, now completely grey. Most of the hair on his head had disappeared by now, but what was left still <br />
stretched to his mid-back. <br />
<br />
It wasn't long before he'd reached 60 years old. Erin wished he had a pair of glasses to see just how much <br />
he'd changed. Everything was a blur. He could tell he was obese, giving his large belly a wobble, giggling at <br />
the feeling. Feeling his head, he could only feel wisps of hair on his scalp. His face felt rough and pudgy. <br />
It wasn't fun knowing how much he'd transformed and not being able to see it clearly. Maybe the remote could <br />
give him better eyesight. He felt his way along the wall, carefully making his way down the stairs and found <br />
the remote on the table where he'd left it. Just as he was trying to feel the buttons, he heard a car drive up <br />
to the house. Oh no, it was his family and he was a naked old man with eyesight issues! He fumbled with the <br />
remote, trying to find that reality remote on the side of it. Just as he heard the keys in the door, he <br />
pressed it and a blinding light burst from it. When it disappeared, he was able to see again. He had a pair of <br />
thick rimmed glasses on his nose. He could see his reflection in the mirror from where he was standing, seeing <br />
an elderly man thankfully dressed in clothes. They looked a bit explorer-like. He looked so old, and yet he <br />
wasn't freaked out at all. It was how he always looked right? No, that reality button must of affected him <br />
too. He could still remember his previous life, but his new life was more prominent in his mind. The door <br />
swung open next to him and Sam came in. &quot;Grandpa!&quot; he yelled, running over and giving him a hug. In this <br />
reality, he'd ended up being his own father's new father. This wasn't right, he'd had to change that as soon <br />
as he could. What did he do with the remote anyway? <br />
<br />
Erin bent down and reciprocated the hug, feeling a sharp pain in his back, and after straightening up said <br />
&quot;Hey kiddo, how have you been?&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;I've been doing OK. We just went shopping for my birthday. Oh, we got you something. Let me just go and get <br />
it&quot;. Sam ran back out to the car as his son, Barry, and daughter-in-law, Janice, came in through the door. <br />
<br />
Barry looked confused. &quot;Hey dad, what are you doing here? I thought you were out in Brazil, campaigning for <br />
better sustainability in the rainforests?&quot;. <br />
<br />
Erin went over to hug his son and said &quot;Well I couldn't just forget seeing Sammy on his 15th birthday. <br />
Especially because it's also my 60th birthday today, so I made a trip out especially for the occasion&quot;. <br />
<br />
Janice stared at him with disgust. She never liked him as a teen, and looked like she still despised him now, <br />
fearing that his hippy-like views and appearance would rub off on her son who admired him greatly. &quot;Well you <br />
could of phoned or something! We were going to eat at this fancy new restaurant tonight and it's for a table <br />
of three&quot;. <br />
<br />
Erin glared at her before replying &quot;Well I'm sure they won't mind trying to find a table for four now, right?&quot; <br />
Then Sam came back into the room with his gift. It was a special type of shampoo made for long hair and long <br />
beards that looked rather expensive. He gave the boy a bear hug, trying to ignore the pain in his back. &quot;Oh <br />
thanks kiddo, I've been looking for this for months, but I guess they don't sell it south of the border&quot;. He <br />
went to put the shampoo on the table and noticed another gift there. Of course, it was his present to Sam. He <br />
handed it over, saying &quot;I hope you like it. The guy at the shop said it was the latest in technology or <br />
something. I couldn't understand the bleeding thing but maybe you will&quot;. <br />
<br />
Sam opened the present and pulled out the Chronivac Remote. Erin flinched in horror, how could he of given it <br />
to him? He didn't want to stay 60 years old. It was nice to try, but he didn't want to be stuck this way! &quot;Oh <br />
cool, I've seen this thing in the mall. Everyone gives it great reviews. Thanks grandpa.&quot; Before he could stop <br />
him, Sam left his grandfather to go to his room. Erin had to get that remote back somehow before his flight <br />
back to Brazil tomorrow afternoon. But Barry wouldn't let him leave, wanting to know how his campaign was <br />
going. He just hoped that whatever Sam did, he didn't use the reality option. It might make his grandfatherly <br />
role permanent as he forgot this reality.</p>
