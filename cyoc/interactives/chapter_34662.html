<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot; The ointment&quot; Guy began, still out of breath, &quot;Makes the muscles grow, just as much as the person want them to.&quot; he paused &quot;So, you must have wanted to grow... a lot...&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;I never want to get this big! AS big as you are now!? Its impossible, I wouldn't of ever imagined it&quot; He said in a pointed tone  &quot;Anyway, what's happened to you?!? Whats going on! Why are you... like this... now?!?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot; Dude &quot; Guy replied, &quot;I used the ointment yesterday, and I also grew huge, but not nearly this big. Still, it took me a while before I could control it and get back to a reasonable size, thats why I was so much bigger than usual this afternoon when you saw me. And you... Well, you might not have wanted something like this consciously,&quot; guy said, pulling his gigantic arms over his bulging chest. &quot;But on some level you wanted to grow so huge so badly that you ended up like I am now.&quot; Guy explained<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I... don't know, this is too weird!&quot; Cray replied, feeling a knot form in his stomach while looking at the surreal picture in front of him. Guy was now a gargantuan pile of muscle, so big that he was barely able to move, so large his body sprawled across his entire, now broken, sofa. He didnt even look human anymore, but just like incredible mounds of muscle.<br />
<br />
Cray was still practically naked and a little out of breath from the whole ordeal. Suddenly, Cray started to notice an increasing tightness, his chest looked like it was starting to swell again, ever so slightly. He felt his arms expand a little as he stood there, while he gawked at the gigantic pile of muscle that Guy had become. <br />
<br />
&quot;Guy... you gotta help me... its, I can feel it, Its starting to.. come back...&quot; Cray said in a slight panic as his body passed 300 pounds. &quot;I'm starting to grow again, its wearing off!&quot; <br />
<br />
As he said those words Crays growth seemed to accelerate, pushing his arms and lats wider apart.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cray!&quot; Guy exclaimed &quot;Concentrate! 280 pounds! remember!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know if I can control this&quot; Cray said nervously. &quot;I feel so..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just concentrate man! Stop looking at me, just concentrate on 280 pounds. On Jay Cutler or something!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its hard, it's... not easy&quot; Cray replied, trying to form a mental picture of Jay Culter, or Victor Martinez or Ronnie Coleman. The growth began to ebb once again, leaving Cray at a paltry 350 pounds. He had stabilized it again, but all this talk of growth was clearly effecting him.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, I'm trying too! I can't stay like this!&quot; Guy replied, realizing the difficulty of formulating a coherent thought while being flooded an incredible number of new sensations from his gigantic body. Guy was only able to bend his arm about an inch before his massive, rock solid, boulder-like biceps collided with his gigantic, 25 inch forearms. The more he flexed them, the tighter his muscles became and the less he was able to move. There was no way he would live like this. <br />
<br />
Guy pictured himself back as Cray, a 250 pound bodybuilder with good proportion and symmetry, yet still huge, and undeniably so, rather than this monstrous form he had become. <br />
<br />
It began suddenly. Guy began to notice an increase in flexibility, his traps receded a little, allowing him to turn his head and face Cray. <br />
<br />
Cray, still a full 100 pounds heavier than he had been this afternoon, looked so incredibly huge to Guy, even though Guy was still well over twice his mass. Guy looked at awe at his buddies powerful, bulging physique. Not even Jay Cutler could compare to Cray now, let alone Guy. <br />
<br />
&quot;How are you doing man? It looks like it's working... you're starting to look a little more...&quot; Cray paused. &quot;...Human&quot; <br />
<br />
Guys muscled continued to recede. He began to move slowly, hearing another little crack in the wooden frame of the sofa. At least he was starting to regain mobility. <br />
<br />
Guy pulled himself up, maybe a little pre-maturely, as he nearly lost his balance and fell, thankfully, Cray helped stabilize him. <br />
<br />
Cray was in awe of the still monstrously large man in front of him. &quot;It's gonna be ok man&quot; Cray said reassuringly.<br />
<br />
But then it all stopped. Guy was puzzled. He was trying to be Cray's size... a more modest 350 pounds, yet he was still easily 150 pounds heavier than Cray, dwarfing him. Guy concentrated for another minute, while Cray look on in shock.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Cray, I don't know whats going to happen, I don't know what to do. I'm trying to get smaller now, but its not working. I'm stuck!&quot; Guy said anxiously, closing his eyes and picturing being in Guy's body...It wasn't helping, he wasn't getting any smaller. <br />
<br />
Guy moved his legs, which were still so huge that they were forced over 2 feet apart at his knees, and still pressed tightly together. He managed to make a few steps, hearing the wood creak beneath his 500 some pounds. He moved towards Cray. <br />
<br />
&quot;Woah man, be careful&quot; Cray said, trying to keep his friend balanced. &quot;I need to figure out a way to fix this!&quot; Guy said. <br />
<br />
&quot;oh, man, its late! What am i going to do? Mr Yaun's not at the store... and I cant get any smaller.&quot; Guy continued. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just keep trying&quot; Cray said, putting a hand on Guy's titanic shoulders<br />
<br />
Guy concentrated again, but it was no use, he couldn't get anything to change. Was he really stuck like this? <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry man, you can stay here, it's not a problem, my bedroom is just over there, we'll put the mattress on the floor, it'll be fine, and I can sleep on the couch.&quot; Cray said in a re-assuring tone, still taking stock of his own bulging musculature. None of his clothes would fit him now! How was he supposed to get to work?<br />
<br />
Cray and Guy decided to take a break, tried to get their minds off their bodies, turning on the TV and relaxing a little over a few beers. For the 500 pounds the Guy had become, it would take a lot more than five beer for him to feel any buzz. <br />
<br />
None the less, they attempted to relax, and Guy continued to try and ignore his own size and nakedness. Besides, at this point, it's not like he could do much more than tie a blanket around his waist.</p>
