<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">„Well, since I got my driver&#39;s license on monday, I&#39;d love to have a car,&#39; Dean says.<br />
<br />
“What kind of car would you want,” Jeff asks.<br />
<br />
“An Skoda Superb SportLine,” the other boy says, “they are so cool!”<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “yeah, they are,” he says, “okay, a Skoda Superb I will become. What colour?”<br />
<br />
“Blue,” Dean says, Jeff nods and starts to edit his stats.<br />
<br />
Jeff is so focused on the editing, that he does not notice Dean&#39;s evil smirk, &#39;Jeff is so dumb,&#39; he thinks to himself, &#39;once I get him registered he&#39;ll belong to me. I&#39;ll be his owner for life, he&#39;ll have to do anything I says, maybe the registration will also make him think that he is actually a car and not a human.&#39; Imagining Jeff as his property, the boy&#39;s cock twitches as it starts to harden, his smirk growing. Jeff is unaware that Dean is gay and always had an eye on Jeff, he always says he is not gay, because he knows how homophobic Jeff is and he did not want to lose Jeff as a friend, but now he can have some fun with his soon-to-be car and no one will be any wiser.<br />
<br />
Dean then jumps as Jeff starts talking to him, ripping him from his train of thought, “all done,” Jeff says as he turns around, by then Dean had put on his poker face. “I set the transformation to be slow and start in an hour, that would give us time to get out of the house, then we&#39;ll search for a secluded area and wait for me to transform.”<br />
<br />
“Sounds like a plan,” Dean says, “what about your clothes?”<br />
<br />
“Well, since I don&#39;t want to strip naked, especially in front of a fellow male, I set it so that the first transformation would transform my clothes into a full body suit. That way if I turn back into a human I&#39;ll be always wearing clothes.”<br />
<br />
&#39;We&#39;ll see about that,&#39; Dean thinks to himself, &#39;I&#39;ll make sure that my car will stay a car for ever.&#39; Then Dean asks, “what about the awareness?”<br />
<br />
“Only you and me will know the truth, every one else will think I am just a normal car,” Jeff says, “my family only know that they have a son “Jeff” who is always hanging out with his friend “Dean”, that way they know that I&#39;ll always be back in the evening.”<br />
<br />
&#39;I got to find a way to make sure that Jeff is unable to transform back into a human without me allowing it,&#39; Dean thinks to himself, &#39;I got to get my hands on the Chronivac, I think I know how.&#39; Dean looks at Jeff, then he gets an idea, “hey Jeff, before you confirm the settings, I&#39;d like a drink, I am pretty thirsty from the excitement.”<br />
<br />
“Sure,” Jeff says and gets up from his computer, “no touching the program,” he says sternly, Dean simply nods and Jeff leaves the room.<br />
<br />
The second that Jeff has left the room and closed the door, Dean sits down at his friend&#39;s computer and hooks up his phone to the laptop. The boy the looks at Jeff&#39;s profile, looking for a possibility to download the program including Jeff&#39;s stats to his phone. Dean smirks as he finds a button in the right hand corner saying “download program and profiles to a portable device”. The teen presses n it and a window pops up, which shows the possible devices on which the program and profiles can be downloaded/copied on to. Dean smiles as he sees the name of his phone in the list, working fast he clicks on his phone and then confirms the selection and his phone beeps as the download/copy process starts. “Come on, come on,” Dean mumbles to himself, he smiles as he sees that the loading bar is already at 50%, the boy guesses that since there is only one profile saved in the program and that his phone is pretty powerful, that the copying and download won&#39;t take to long. After five minutes, his phone and Jeff&#39;s laptop beep showing the message that the process has been successful. Dean smirks and detaches his phone from the laptop and puts it into his pocket and stands up from Jeff&#39;s laptop, just in time as the door opens and Jeff enters with two cans of coke.<br />
<br />
“Sorry it took so long,” Jeff says, “mum hid the coke again,” he adds as he hands Dean a can.<br />
<br />
Dean smiles, “no problem, c... um... Jeff.”<br />
<br />
Jeff raises an eyebrow, “did you just wanted to call me “car”?”<br />
<br />
“Hehe... sorry... I guess I just cant wait,” Dean says.<br />
<br />
Jeff smiles, “that is okay,” he says, he then sits down at his laptop, not noticing anything, “you ready to get this started?”<br />
<br />
“Always,” Dean says and smiles as Jeff clicks on “confirm”, the boy inwardly smirks as he feels his phone vibrate in his pocket, knowing that the program he downloaded also activated, since he copied Jeff&#39;s profile with his settings. &#39;Enjoy the last hour of your human life, car,&#39; the boy thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
Jeff then closes the program and shuts off his laptop, he stands up and turns to Dean, “let&#39;s get going,” he says and the boys leave the house and walk down the street.<br />
<br />
“So, any idea where we should go,” Dean asks.<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “we&#39;ll go the the woods just down the road,” Jeff says, “I know a secluded area where the path is wide enough for a car. The path leads directly to the main road, but since it is not visited that often, we&#39;ll won&#39;t need to be worried to be spotted.”<br />
<br />
“Sounds good,” Dean says and follows Jeff.<br />
<br />
The boys enter the forest and start to head towards the secluded path, deep in the forest, as Jeff suddenly feels a tingling running through his whole bods. “I think it is starting,” he says, they look down and watch as Jeff&#39;s shoes start to change. First his blue Adidas sneakers change colour from blue to black and the material changes from cotton to rubber and they seem to become skintight, as if they were painted on to Jeff&#39;s body. The changes continue up the boy&#39;s body, his blue jeans become skintight and become a little darker in colour and they also seem to get an metallic sheen.<br />
<br />
“Your legs look like made of metal,” Dean says.<br />
<br />
Jeff taps his changing legs and a metallic “cling” can be heard, he grins at Dean, “not only look like it, they ARE metal,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Wow, isn&#39;t it uncomfortable to walk,” the other boy asks.<br />
<br />
“Nope, I don&#39;t feel any difference,” Jeff says, “it feels just weird.”<br />
<br />
“I bet it does,” Dean replies.<br />
<br />
The boys continue to walk, they soon reach the path, Jeff turns so that he is facing forward and stands in the middle of the path. “Following the path that way,” he says, pointing in front of him, “leads to the main road.”<br />
<br />
“Got it,” Dean says, “how long will it take?”<br />
<br />
“The transformation,” Jeff asks and Dean nods, “well, since I want to experience every little thing, I set it to last three hours.”<br />
<br />
“Damn... okay I just hope I can keep my impatience under control,” Dean chuckles.</p>
