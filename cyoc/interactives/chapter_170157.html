<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brian knew deep down he should put the jacket back into the locker. He knew he really should. But when he looked at the new him, standing there smirking in the mirror, Brian lost the fight before it really began. He remembered how he was before, the sheer dynamic energy going through him, the fact his girlfriends described him as being GORGEOUS... Brian put the jacket back on and grinned at himself. He wasn&#39;t gonna go too far with it. Just back to his twenties. He knew it could cause a problem if he got too young looking, so he decided to try and observe himself.<br />
<br />
For a time he took it off and flexed one more time for the mirror, then called for his assistant coach, Chase, to go and handle the team. He trusted Chase because the guy was like him - a former jock who now lived the dream of coaching sports in high school. Chase was about 24, and muscled - though more toned than large. Brian knew from chatter around the school that apparently a number of the school&#39;s girls and some of the boys had crushes on Chase.<br />
<br />
&#39;Well,&#39; Brian thought, &#39;They&#39;ll have someone new to crush on.&#39;<br />
<br />
Chase seemed to notice Brian was in better health than usual, and the auburn haired young man enthusiastically agreed to go handle things. Give an excuse and what not. Brian watched him go, and grinned. He slipped the jock jacket back on, and noted how it still even after he grew felt like it had room and yet a reasonably nice fit. Definitely seemed like something was going on with this thing. Once he was done with it, he was gonna give it over to Seth.<br />
<br />
Man, his son and him just muscled up by this thing and hitting the gym at the same time. It&#39;d be something else.<br />
<br />
Brian entered his office, and decided to check in a nearby mirror to see if anything was happening yet. What he saw was actually astonishing. He watched as his rugged face seemed to soften a bit, while retaining its masculine countenance. He was watching himself become younger and prettier as he sat there. He could feel his muscles twitching, pulsing...it seemed actually looking made him actually feel it happen.<br />
<br />
Ohh it was beyond what he had imagined. Brian&#39;s cock starting to twinge and then twitch before filling with arousal, and he looked at himself, sitting there with his cock sticking up like a joystick in his pants, his increasingly youthful face and muscled physique just driving up the arousal more and more. Brian wanted to keep watching, to enjoy with bated breath the transformation of his body, but he was both aware he could go too far...and was aware he needed desperately to beat off.<br />
<br />
He peeled off the jock jacket gingerly, and put it on a seat by his side. Sure the windows would let people look into his office, but they wouldn&#39;t show what was going on below his waistline...! Brian pulled up to one of the desks, biting his lip as he pulled his pants down and looked at his manhood. A trimmed up bush he remembered above a strong, thick eight incher. He called it the &quot;babe pleaser&quot; back in the day. A day he was increasingly getting to enjoy again.<br />
<br />
Brian wrapped his hand around his cock and was immediately left choking down a sexualized gasp. He hadn&#39;t remembered what kind of sensitivity he had in his younger years. He must be physically about 25 or 26, and when he beat off back then, ohh, it was always something else. Brian tried to exercise the same maturity and restraint while pleasing himself he usually employed, but increasingly it was obvious he was lasciviously grinning and pumping his hips.<br />
<br />
Brian wanted to keep quiet, but before long that too was too unrealistic. His moans were light at first, but then he lapsed into deeper grunts and groans as he pistoned his hips. He even found himself chatting about it as he pleasured himself, &quot;Ooh fuck fuck fuck! My dick&#39;s so sensitive! I gotta get laid tonight! I&#39;m like a young stud again...&quot; Maybe that was because he was!<br />
<br />
Brian hoped that the practice lasted longer out there, he wanted to draw this out. To really enjoy his body and his renewed masculine energy. He flexed an arm for the mirror and gulped down a moan - just looking at that almost made him cum...! Indeed, it seemed he had underestimated how easily this body of his would&#39;ve settled into the role of a quickshot. &quot;Ohh fuck, almost came too soon...&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian propped his arm up on the table as he heard someone come in.<br />
<br />
Oh it was just Chase again. <br />
<br />
&#39;And there&#39;s Chase. Fuuuck I need to workout with Chase. Maybe we can go out and hit up the town after, maybe we can fuck some chicks together, jerk each other off if we can&#39;t find any chicks no homo.&#39; Brian bit his lip, wondering where that came from.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, uhh, Brian, just wanted to ask what drills you did yesterday. I wanted to switch things up today.&quot; Chase was oblivious it seemed to what was going on in the coach&#39;s office. Though he did seem curious why the coach was looking sweaty.<br />
<br />
&quot;I uhh...uhhhh...mmm...&quot; Brian tried to answer, then managed through a moan disguised as contemplation, he said, &quot;Routines A1-35 and A2-46. I marked em down Chase. Feel free to uhh...do whatever ya want...&quot; I know I am, Brian thought to himself as he bucked his hips, barely stopping himself from shooting off when he felt his hand slip and touch his all too sensitive glans. Man he&#39;d be in trouble if the other teachers realized he was in here beating off like this.<br />
<br />
&#39;Would it be problematic for me to start showering with the guys on the team? Yeah duh...&#39; Brian contemplated but then felt himself lose control totally. His thought train derailed as he felt an initial pump of cum hit the wall the table was up against, and then he gasped outloud, &quot;Aww fuck yeah I&#39;m cumming!!&quot; He must&#39;ve painted the underside of the table with it because he heard it dripping off.<br />
<br />
He withdrew his hand and looked at the remains of his emission on there. &quot;Wow, also forgot how much I came. Damn, this is a straight up blessing. I&#39;m hot and young looking again. Sure I&#39;ll have to come up with some sorta explanation, but maybe this thing might cover it for me...&quot; Wouldn&#39;t be the weirdest thing about a jacket that turned people into the best versions of themselves.<br />
<br />
Brian contemplated what to do next.<br />
<br />
Seth could really do with this helping him out, but there was also the fact the team getting upgraded by this was incredibly exciting for him on multiple levels. Brian could go and try and hit the gym with his new physique, and see what happened. Though there were also those kinda weird thoughts he had found himself thinking. Maybe there was also a mental component to the jacket&#39;s changes.<br />
<br />
Brian pulled his pants back up and flexed one more time. Just the right age to really get back to the good times.<br />
<br />
Now what to do from here...</p>
