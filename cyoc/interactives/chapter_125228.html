<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After Tabitha left, I decided to just go for a walk.<br />
<br />
I wanted to use my ring to bring sexy but happy changes to other people, so I thought I&#39;d start with our own neighborhood.  I had already done so with our neighbors, so after locking up the house and taking the key with me, I strolled down the sidewalk.<br />
<br />
I thought as I walked that for each family I&#39;d set the stage of changes for each family, and let them play out slowly, as if they&#39;d done it all on their own.  All these people needed for a happy future was a little nudge from the ring.<br />
<br />
I passed the neighbor&#39;s house, belonging to Gilly and Wendy who I&#39;d already changed, and stopped in front of the house 2 doors down.  Using the ring I wished to know about the family living there.<br />
<br />
With that wish I learned that the house was lived in by a married couple, Jacob and Hannah.  They were not very happy in their marriage.  Jacob had a job at a hardware store and Hannah stayed at home and didn&#39;t work.  At home Jacob was a lazy bum and didn&#39;t want to chores or help his wife in any way.  He didn&#39;t like doing anything.  Hannah always wanted to pursue a career but Jacob thought it was not fit for a woman to have a job and thought they should just stay home and keep house.  Hannah also wanted children but was unfortunately found to be barren, and she was very sad and depressed in her life.<br />
<br />
I started wishing.  &quot;I wish that Jacob&#39;s laziness and old-fashioned thinking are the expression of a suppressed deep dislike for being grown up and having responsibilities and that in truth he wishes he could just go back to being a child again.  I wish that Hannah will talk to a psychiatrist today about her marital problems and that the psychiatrist will realize the truth about Jacob&#39;s desires and will tell Hannah how to go forward.  I wish that after Jacob comes home today Hannah will be assertive and talk to Jacob about his suppressed desire and tell him that she wants to help him.<br />
<br />
I continued: &quot;I wish that although at first Jacob is resistant Hannah will be assertive and keep trying until he agrees that he wants to be young again.  I wish that at this time Hannah will use hypnosis techniques the psychiatrist taught her and help Jacob&#39;s mind open up to acting like a baby again, except that she will throw in the twist that Jacob will now want to be a baby girl.  I wish that from then on Jacob will slowly start to act on his inner desire to become like a baby girl while Hannah supports him doing so.&quot;<br />
<br />
I went on: &quot;I wish that by the time one year has passed Jacob will act exactly like a 1 year old girl and Hannah will change his name legally to Julia and his gender legally to female.  I wish that from then on Julia will mentally age in real time while Hannah raises her as her daughter, and so the former Jacob will grow up as a woman and live out the rest of her days as a woman.  I wish that as Julia becomes smart enough again she will ask her mother Hannah about why she is different from most little girls and Hannah will be honest with her about her past life, and that Julia will accept this but be very happy with how things turned out and be happy to now live as a trans-girl growing into a trans-woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
I conluded: &quot; I wish that meanwhile Hannah will pursue a successful career and be so happy now that she can have a career and a child like she always wanted.  Lastly, I wish that Hannah&#39;s experience has made her not be sexually attracted to men anymore, and that she will be a lesbian, and may start looking for love after Jacob&#39;s first transitional year to become Julia.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pleased with myself for the new happiness this family would find, I walked on and reached the end of the block.  The houses and yards in this neighborhood were fairly sizable, like my parents&#39;, and Jacob&#39;s and Hannah&#39;s house was actually the corner house.  I turned right and crossed the street I&#39;d been walking along, and headed back on the other side along the direction I came, until I came to the house opposite Jacob&#39;s and Hannah&#39;s.  I wished to know about the family at this house.<br />
<br />
I learned that it was occupied by a husband and wife who had one son.  The husband named George was a successful businessman who was away from the house a lot.  He was powerful in his company and made a lot of money and cheated on his wife a lot.  The wife Yolanda was from Peru and was a trophy wife for George.  She was a stay-at-home mom but was happy enough doing so unlike Hannah.  She knew about George&#39;s affairs but stayed with him out of her submissive personality and inability to go anywhere else, as she had no job experience and would have difficulty financially if she left.  Lastly their son Fred was a pretty typical teenager; he went to school and had average grades and average friends, nothing special at all.<br />
<br />
I knew that George didn&#39;t find any fulfillment in his affairs, and that Yolanda had been sexually cold ever since George stopped paying attention to her sexually.  I though of an idea to help them.  &quot;I wish that even though George has always liked submissive women, that he is realizing that he needs something more to help him be sexually satisfied.  I wish that when George is dominated by a submissive person, it is a big turn-on for him, and not having this with his submissive mistresses is why he is not happy sexually.&quot;<br />
<br />
I went on: &quot;I wish that Fred will be staying over with a friend tonight so that George and Yolanda will have the house alone.  I wish that Yolanda will have an idea to try something new sexually since she has tried everything else, and it couldn&#39;t really get worse.  I wish that when George comes home late tonight that Yolanda will have her sexy submissive maid outfit on and they will start going through the motions of having sex like normal, except that Yolanda will have put on a strap-on.  I wish that when they start taking off clothes and George discovers this, Yolanda will take the strange role of a submissive dominant, that she will humbly point out how naughty he&#39;s been, and will request permission to punish him as he deserves.&quot;<br />
<br />
I continued: &quot;I wish that George will be very turned on and unable to resist and will be submissive to his submissive wife, and will allow her to ravage his asshole for the first time.  I wish that he will love it immensely and cum multiple time throughout the night as she submissively dominates him.  I wish that this sort of sex was a huge turn on for Yolanda as well and that the movement of fucking her husband will stimulate her clit and she will find this the most pleasurable sensation she&#39;s ever had and will cum frequently while fucking him.&quot;<br />
<br />
I concluded: &quot;I wish that from then on George will realize that he absolutely loves to be penetrated and also loves submitting to his submissive wife.  I wish that he&#39;ll never again be able to penetrate someone else, but will just love being fucked in the ass and this will always make him cum.  I wish that they will love experimenting with dildos, vibrators, and anything else to fuck George.  I wish that he will love wearing butt-plugs of various shapes and sizes throughout the day and all the time Yolanda isn&#39;t fucking him.  I wish that he would enjoy being called &#39;Georgia&#39; during sex with his wife.  I wish that their newfound sex life will make them very happy and the George will never cheat again and that he will continue being successful in his business.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was happy with myself for improving their lives.  It occurred to me that I hadn&#39;t done anything with Fred.  I decided I&#39;d think of something later.<br />
<br />
I walked further and came to the next house, across from Gilly and Wendy&#39;s.  I wished to know about that family.  I learned that it belonged to a single man named Harvey, a lawyer who had several failed marriages and was living alone.  I thought I could help him.<br />
<br />
I wished: &quot;I wish that Harvey will grow until he is 7&#39;2&quot; tall, and become incredibly muscular like a body-builder and that his cock would become very thick and over a foot long.  I wish that Harvey was gay and absolutely loves cocks.  I wish that Harvey was very good at picking up men to have sex with, and that because of his size and stature that he was always the top when he had sex with men.  I wish that during his downtime from work his favorite pass-time was having gay sex, and that we would often go out on the town to seduce men, or even hire servicemen or repairmen for his house and seduce them, since he loves a man in uniform.<br />
<br />
I continued: &quot;I wish that Harvey is generally happy, but is missing something.  I wish that Harvey secretly longs to be the bottom in a gay relationship, but this has never been successful because of his physical dimensions he is always on top, and any attempts to be the bottom have failed because the other man can&#39;t do it.  I wish that Harvey is searching for someone he can be the bottom for, and when he finds that person he will fall in love with them and want to get married and settle down, but until that time Harvey is just a big happy gay slut.&quot;<br />
<br />
That one was easy.  With that out of the way a walked down the street to the next house.  This one was across from my parents&#39; house.  I wished to know about the family that lived there.  <br />
<br />
It was a family of 4, a husband Gene, wife Sarah, and their son Chad, and daughter Jill, who was a year younger than Chad.  Unlike some of the other families I&#39;d come across so far, they were pretty straightforward.  They didn&#39;t have any huge marital problems or suppressed desires.  Instead they were boring and had humdrum lives.   Certainly I could make their lives more exciting, and happier, though they weren&#39;t so unhappy now, but I needed something to go off of.  I used the ring to search a little deeper into their mindsets and desires, and learned something that could help.<br />
<br />
Each member of this family was not only accepting, but genuinely impressed with the transformation of Francine and Lisette, my parents.  They were appreciative of the happiness my parents found, and impressed with their commitment to the change.  With that information, I though this family could be improved with a change of their own.<br />
<br />
I wished: &quot;I wish that this family would have a long talk tonight about how important it is to be open and honest with each other and to pursue one&#39;s dreams.  I wish the sincerity of the conversation would allow Chad to come out as transgender, and then Gene to also come out as transgender.  I wish that Sarah and Jill would be very happy and supportive of them and want to help them become happy as women.&quot;  <br />
<br />
I continued: &quot; I wish that over time, as Gene grows into his new femininity, that he would prefer acting as a young teenage girl.  I wish that meanwhile, Chad would learn he prefers acting as a mature grown-up woman.  I wish that over time and healthy discussion, Chad and Gene would switch roles as they switched gender, and that Jill and Sarah were happy and supportive of this.  I wish that Sarah would start to love Chad--who will change his name to Cheryl--as her wife.  I wish that Cheryl will love being Sarah&#39;s wife and will take over as a parent in the family.<br />
<br />
I went on: &quot;I wish that Gene will change his name to Janine, and will become as a teenage girl and daughter of Cheryl and Sarah.  I wish that Jill will so admire her father&#39;s transformation into Janine that her love will become skewed in her mind, and she will start to love Janine as both a sister and an incestuous lesbian lover.  I wish that Janine will feel the same toward Jill, and I wish that Cheryl and Sarah will be happy with this relationship as well and will encourage it.  I wish that this slow transformation over time will bring great joy and happiness to this family.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was really feeling good now, and I liked helping people like this.  I was ready for more, and headed down the street to the next house, which was across from Lorne&#39;s and Rachel&#39;s house.  I wished to know about the family that lived here.  I learned that it was a family of 5, including Barry the husband, Harriett the wife, their son Josh the oldest child, their daughter Anya the middle child, and their son Ernie the youngest.<br />
<br />
I learned that this family was pretty unhappy.  The parents fought all the time and were always angry with each other.  They had low-paying jobs and had been fired from many more because they were rude and lazy people.  Josh was a jock who was a bully at school and ran with his crowd of sports players picking on kids who were less popular.  Ernie was a juvenile delinquent and was always getting in trouble, going out drinking, smoking, and causing trouble around the town.  The only sensible one seemed to be Anya, who was always depressed because of the state of her family and her life.<br />
<br />
I knew I could help them.  I started wishing: &quot;I wish that Anya has found and will read a book on hypnotism.  I wish that she will experiment with it and find that it doesn&#39;t work on most people, but for some reason, that it does work on her family.  I wish that she will use hypnotism to slowly mold and change her family.&quot;<br />
<br />
I continued: &quot;I wish that she will use her hypnotism to make her parents into air-headed bimbos.  I wish that she will make Barry want to become a girly-girl, who loves anything pink and feminine, and wears only the girliest clothes, and is really dumb, and that he will change his name to Barbie.  I wish that Anya would change Harriett into a typical bimbo, who will get plastic surgery to make her breasts really big, and who is really air-headed and talk like a bimbo, and wears bikinis all the time and loves going to the beach, and also loves pole-dancing, and will change her name to Heather.<br />
<br />
I went on: &quot;I wish that Barbie and Heather would support their family by becoming a lesbian porn-star couple, who make up scenes and film themselves having sex with each other and sell it to sites on the internet.  I wish that they will do all the writing and production themselves, and that they will become really popular and make a lot of money.  I wish that they will happily have sex outside of their marriage and still be happy with each other but that they will be strict lesbians and only have sex with women.&quot;<br />
<br />
I wished further: &quot;I wish that Anya will make Ernie act like a prissy young girl whose name is changed to Elaine, who dresses only in really fancy, Victorian-style women&#39;s clothing and schools herself at home on all manner of high class subjects.  I wish that Anya will rent out Elaine to women as a high class lesbian slave, who will do anything asked of her, as long as the command is made by a lesbian.&quot;<br />
<br />
I concluded: &quot;I wish that Anya would make Josh act like an athletic and active girl whose name is changed to Denise who loves running, hiking, track and field, swimming, volleyball, tennis, and biking.  I wish that Anya would make Denise her incestuous lesbian sister and lover.  I wish that Anya would be really smart and successful in directing her family into blissful, ignorant, lesbian happiness.&quot;<br />
<br />
Another family&#39;s happy future ensured, I was starting to get tired, but there were only two houses left on the block: the corner houses on the same side of the street as my parent&#39;s, and the one across from it.  I went to the one across from it and wished to know about its occupants.  It was a single African American woman named Aliyah who had inherited the house when her parents passed away.  I learned she was sad and lonely, and that she was also unlucky in love.  She had a promising job as a manager of a clothing store.<br />
<br />
I wished: &quot;I wish that Aliyah would start masturbating as a regular pass-time when she was home, since she doesn&#39;t have anyone else to be sexually active with.  I wish that she would slowly start to really enjoy and prefer the company of nobody but herself.  I wish that she would have friends but she would like only platonic relationships and no longer desire to find love with other people.  I wish that she would start to love herself like a lover, and that instead of thinking of it as masturbating, she would think of it as having sex with herself.&quot;<br />
<br />
I finished: &quot;I wish that she would fall in love with herself like a lover, and would engage in a relationship with herself as if it were two people.  I wish she would go on dates with herself, plan her future together, argue and make up, and discover new things together with herself.  I wish that some day she will be so in love that she will ask herself to marry her and she will say yes.  I wish that she will have a wedding to be married to herself and invite all her friends who will be happy that she has found happiness with herself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Phew!  Now for the last house.  I realized I had left a few loose ends.  I had never set up a happy end for Harvey, and I hadn&#39;t done anything with Fred, so I decided I&#39;d include them in what I did with the last family.  I crossed the street to the last house and wished to know about the family.  It was a family of 4: the husband Robert, the wife Sheila, the older brother Paul and the younger sister Kayla.<br />
<br />
I learned that Robert was a stereotypical masculine man, who didn&#39;t pay much attention to his wife.  He liked sports, and fishing, and guns, and drinking beer with his friends.  He objectified women and was misogynistic.  Sheila was living as a meek housewife who had grown up as a tomboy.  She also liked the same kinds of things that Robert did which is how they fell in love, but because of Robert&#39;s domineering personality Sheila had fallen back to sticking with womens&#39; pass-times.  <br />
<br />
Paul had taken after his father and was a sleeze-bag who was always trying to get into girls&#39; pants.  He didn&#39;t care about his grades but liked cars, drinking, and getting laid.  Kayla followed the life of a good girl but envied the trouble her dad and brother got in, and wanted to be stronger and more assertive, but couldn&#39;t bring herself to do it with her dad and brother around.<br />
<br />
I made some wishes to change the family: &quot;I wish that Robert&#39;s over-masculinity is an expression of his suppressed desire to be dominated and humiliated by a woman.  I wish that he will meet a woman who is one of his friend&#39;s exes, and that this woman will be huge: 6&#39;4&quot; tall and 350 pounds.  I wish that this woman would be assertive and dominant toward him and that he would realize that really turns him on.  I wish that he will start having an affair with this woman who treats him like a humiliated sex slave.  I wish that she will continue putting on weight which Robert loves because he learned that he loves BBWs.  I wish that she will start calling him Sally and make him wear women&#39;s fetish clothing all the time.<br />
<br />
I continued: &quot;I wish that Sheila will learn early on of her husband&#39;s affair but will be okay with it because it allows her to pursue her masculine pass-times.  I wish she will get back into hunting, fishing, sports, and beer.  I wish she will learn that though she still likes her boobs, clothes, and feminine looks, she will really want to have her own cock.  I wish she will save up her money and contact a friend of hers: a robotics expert.<br />
<br />
I went on: &quot;I wish that he will give her a massive, 18 inch robotic penis that he connects it into her nervous system so it feels 100% real to her.  I wish that she will have full control over it and can change its appearance and shape to some degree.  I wish that not long after this that she will meet Harvey who will notice her new endowment as it is really hard to hide.  I wish that Sheila and Harvey will have sex and that Sheila would be the top.  I wish that because of this Harvey will fall in love with her and want to be her bottom forever, and she will fall in love with him too.&quot;<br />
<br />
I kept going: &quot;I wish that for some reason Paul happens to watch a popular cartoon princess movie.  I wish that for some reason he would be really interested in this and start watching all the cartoon princess movies and be really into them.  I wish that Paul would love and envy the princesses and that he wished he could be one.  I wish that he would find a therapist who will help him become a fantastic princess girl, and that in his transition he will learn to sing in his new feminine voice.  <br />
<br />
Continuing further: &quot;I wish that he will become a woman named Ophelia and that she will be a professional princess, dressing up and acting as one at events to make money.  I wish she would be so good at it that she would end up being cast as a cartoon princess in a movie, with even her own singing, the first transgender actress to do so.  I wish that after this she would meet another princess actress and they would fall in lesbian love and get married and live the rest of their lives in lesbian princess bliss.&quot;<br />
<br />
Moving on I kept wishing: &quot;I wish that Kayla would shave her hair short and dye it hot pink, get lots of piercings and tattoos, and start dressing and acting like a stereotypical punk butch lesbian.  I wish that she will like masculine things like fighting, skating, shooting guns, and going to bars.  I wish that though she&#39;s in this rebellious streak she will eventually come out of it a better person and will want to go into the army.  She will remain a butch lesbian and around the time her behavior starts improving she will meet Fred.&quot;<br />
<br />
Going even further: &quot;I wish Fred who has always liked dancing will start getting into ballet at his school.  I wish that he will like the skill and athleticism needed.  I wish that he does male parts in ballets for a while but a time comes when a female part is needed and only he is capable of doing it.  I wish that he will do the female part and love it so much that he will only want to do female parts.  I wish then he will aspire to become a professional ballerina and is willing to become a woman in his normal life to accomplish this.  I wish that he sill start transitioning to a teenage girl and ballerina with the support of his parents.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally concluding: &quot;I wish that when Kayla meets Fred it will be at the beginning of his transition and she will fall in love with his future female self and help him transition to become Felicia.  I wish that after that they will pursue their dreams, Felicia as a ballerina and Kayla in the army.  I wish that years later they will rediscover each other and fall in love and get married and live happily as a lesbian couple.&quot;<br />
<br />
I realized that while this family was going to be scattered to the winds, and not family anymore, that they would each find individual happiness far greater than what they had now.<br />
<br />
By now it was almost 1 o&#39; clock, and that Tabitha would be getting out of class soon.  I decided to head home, happy with the changes I&#39;d made to the neighborhood.  I went back to my parents&#39; house, fixed a sandwich for lunch, and watched TV for a little while before Tabitha came home.</p>
