<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Many thanks to AlabastorScone for helping in reviewing this chapter and providing thoughts and opinions.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tom nervously made his way into the open waiting room, where he saw Alice, his 14-year-old son, Matt, and his roommate, Steve, all sitting down. They looked up when they saw Dr. Pinkerton and Tom.<br />
<br />
Alice got up and walked over to him. “Tom, is it really you?” she asked, looking inquisitively into his eyes.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, babe! It’s really me!” Tom said, blushing when he realized that she was now actually a little bit TALLER than he was. His voice sounded so young in comparison to hers.<br />
<br />
“Then it was a success? Everything’s normal? Quick, tell me how we first met!” she asked.<br />
<br />
“It was at Kim and Dave’s wedding, 3 years ago. You were there with some friends, and I asked you to dance. We hit it off and started dating,” Tom replied.<br />
<br />
Alice looked at him, amazed. “I can’t believe it worked! You look so young! Are those braces?! People are gonna think I’m a cradle robber!” Alice said jokingly.<br />
<br />
Matt had stood up and was staring at his father. Matt was a bit tall for his age and was roughly around the same height as Tom was in this new body. But Matt was also a student athlete involved in wrestling and football, so he actually had several pounds of muscle more than Tom did now.<br />
<br />
“Wow, Dad! This is crazy! I can’t believe this!” he said, coming in for a hug. Tom hugged him back, surprised at how much weaker he felt in comparison.<br />
<br />
“I know, Matt. It’s going to take some getting used to, but I’m still your dad!” Tom replied after they broke the hug. <br />
<br />
“I bet I could totally take you down now in wrestling, though!” Matt said with his trademark smirk. <br />
<br />
“That may be the case, but I can still ground you and take away your phone!” Tom said in response.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, yeah, I get it. You’re a skeleton but still the boss,” Matt said, chuckling. His short brown hair and blue eyes made him look a lot like Tom was when he was a teenager, at least, in his old body. “Well, I guess people won’t be saying that I look a lot like you anymore!”<br />
<br />
“That’s true!” Steve said, standing up and running a hand through his short blond hair. Steve was also taller than Tom in his new body, and even with his average build, still looked like had a definite strength advantage over Tom. “But hey, as long as you continue to pay your half of the rent and bills, I’m cool with whatever you look like!”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, well, I’m still supposed to be able to keep my job and everything,” Tom replied. “I’ve already talked this over with Bill and it shouldn’t be a problem.” He noticed that Alice kept looking at him with a strange look on her face. “What is it, babe?”<br />
<br />
“What?” she asked, when she realized he had called her out. “Oh, it’s nothing. I’m just still trying to get over how young you look. I mean, you look like you could be in school with Matt. It’s just weird. I told you this was going to be a bit hard for me.”<br />
<br />
“Well, I’m still me,” Tom said. “Still the same guy on the inside that you fell in love with 3 years ago. That hasn’t changed. I’m just a younger, skinnier, ginger version.” He tried to flash her his typical grin, but he realized that with his new mouth and braces, it probably looked a lot different.<br />
<br />
Alice smiled weakly in response, and then turned to Dr. Pinkerton. “So what happens now, Dr. Pinkerton? Can Tom go home now that the procedure is completed?”<br />
<br />
“Well, we do keep the patients overnight for one night, just to make sure there are no hiccups or anything wrong before transitioning them back into their daily lives. Basically, Tom will be under observation to make sure that there are no unexpected complications, but he should be good to go by tomorrow afternoon,” Dr. Pinkerton replied. “If you’ll excuse me, though, I do need to edit and revise my report on Tom’s procedure in my office. If you need anything, Mr. Allen, you can ask one of the nurses at the nurse’s station to call me. I’m on call all night, so I can help take care of anything that you need.”<br />
<br />
Dr. Pinkerton said his goodbyes and left to go to his office. Tom sat down and chatted with Alice, Matt, and Steve, trying to help them get comfortable with the situation. Alice grilled him with personal questions, as if she still couldn’t believe that he was her actual fiancé and not some stranger pulling a prank on her. Matt for the most part remained quiet, pulling out his phone and texting on it, which was not abnormal for him when he had nothing else to do. Steve stayed relaxed and chill, which was also par for the course for him normally. After about 30 minutes, Matt mentioned that he was hungry. Tom also realized that he was really hungry as well.<br />
<br />
“Well, text me in the morning when you wake up,” Alice told Tom. “Let me know when they’re going to discharge you. I should be able to leave work and come pick you up.”<br />
<br />
“All right, babe, I will,” Tom said in response. He leaned in for a kiss. It was so weird to be kissing Alice at the same height as him. She kissed him briefly on the lips, cocking her head to the side as she pulled back. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, this is definitely going to take some getting used to,” she said, a somewhat pained look on her face.<br />
<br />
Tom wanted to discuss this more with her, but he also knew that they would have more time to discuss things one-on-one in the upcoming days, and right now, it would be really awkward in front of Matt and Steve. He gave Matt a hug and told him to continue to listen to Steve, whom he high-fived as he returned towards his hospital room.<br />
<br />
He stopped at the nurse’s station and asked about possibly getting some food. “Oh, yes, of course,” the nurse responded. “We can get you some food sent to your room. Do you have any dietary restrictions?”<br />
<br />
Tom paused for a moment. He actually had no idea whether his new body had any dietary restrictions that would affect what he could or couldn’t eat. “Ummm….I’m actually not sure,” he replied. “Not that I know of?”<br />
<br />
“Here, let me pull up your chart and make sure,” the nurse replied. She scanned his record on the computer. “Unfortunately, since your host body was comatose when brought in, we don’t have a lot of details about his medical history, but I don’t see anything in the notes. Would you like some baked chicken and steamed vegetables?” <br />
<br />
As much as Tom wasn’t a fan of hospital food, he was so hungry that he was willing to eat anything. He agreed, and the nurse said that they would bring the food to his room as soon as it was ready. He returned to his room and sat down on the bed. This was the first time he had been alone since he had awoken in his new body, and he was still getting used to it. He reached for his phone which was on the table near his bed. He looked at the screen waiting for it to unlock, and then realized that the Face ID wasn’t recognizing his new face. He ran a hand through his long red hair, which then fell into his face again. Rolling his eyes, he typed in his passcode and checked his social media accounts. Nothing too noteworthy had occurred since that morning. He thought about posting a selfie with his new body on his accounts to see if people would respond but ultimately decided against it. <br />
<br />
About that time there was a knock on the door and a nurse came in with his food. He thanked the nurse and pulled off the lid. Even with the little salt packet available the hospital food was mostly bland, but he seemed drawn to the pepper packet. Normally, he didn’t put pepper on his food, but this food was so bland that maybe some pepper would spice things up and add a bit of flavor. Without thinking too much, he opened the pepper packet and poured it on the food as well. After taking another bite, he still felt that the taste was too bland for his palate.<br />
<br />
He pressed the page button and his nurse came in a moment later. “May I help you, Mr. Allen?” she asked.<br />
<br />
“Do you have anything to help spice up the food a little bit?”<br />
<br />
“Well, I have some tabasco sauce that I use sometimes when I get food from the cafeteria downstairs. Would you like to use some?”<br />
<br />
Tom had never been a fan of tabasco sauce, but the sound of it actually made his mouth water. “Um…Yes, please, if you don’t mind,” he said.<br />
<br />
“Sure, just a moment.”<br />
<br />
As the nurse left, Tom thought about what he had asked for. Tabasco sauce? Really? Well, it couldn’t hurt to try just a little. If he didn’t like it, he would just force himself to eat the food without anything else. <br />
<br />
The nurse soon returned with a small bottle of tabasco sauce. “Thank you so much!” he told her. She left the room, and he opened the bottle and poured out a small amount on the chicken. He took a bite and found it to be much better! He proceeded to drown the food in the tabasco sauce, and quickly ate up the rest of it without any problem at all. *Could this be some of the new tastes that Dr. Pinkerton was talking about? Or maybe this food is just so bad that it needs whatever it can get to spice it up…* he thought. He didn’t dwell too long on the thoughts. <br />
<br />
After he finished eating, he started going through his email and accidentally tapped on a spam message for a porn site. Although the images only flashed on his screen a few seconds before he deleted the email, he realized it was enough to make his new teen body flood with hormones. *Ugh…that’s going to be a pain to get used to…all those teenage hormones again.*<br />
<br />
He figured he needed a shower anyways, so he decided to go ahead and take a shower to relieve himself. He walked into the attached bathroom and got the shower going. He completely undressed and looked at his body naked for the first time. When he had previously gotten dressed, he hadn’t really taken the time to examine his naked body due to Dr. Pinkerton being present, but now that he was alone, he saw himself in all of his youthfulness.<br />
<br />
Besides the long hair atop his head, he had some small patches of orangish-red hair in his armpits. His crotch had a moderate amount of orangish-red pubic hair that crept up slightly towards his belly button in the beginning of a happy trail. His penis was half-hard and skinny as well, and he realized that he was uncircumcised, with the top part of his shaft sticking out from his foreskin. Having been circumcised as a baby in his previous body, this was an entirely new sensation. He tentatively touched his dick. The feeling was strange and unusual to him, but not unpleasant. A shiver of excitement went down his spine due the sensitivity of his shaft, as a bead of pre-cum appeared at the tip of his penis. As he felt himself, he realized that his penis was not as thick or long as his old one. Feeling his new dick in his hand made him feel weird. It was wrong to touch another guy’s dick, but this wasn’t some random kid, this was HIS body now. He tried to remind himself that, but it was still difficult.<br />
<br />
He went ahead and got into the shower and began to wash his hair. It was weird having such long hair. He usually kept his hair fairly short and trimmed, getting monthly haircuts to keep his hair under control. But this new body’s hair was long and shaggy. He had never thought that he would like having long hair, but he did actually think that it looked good on his new face. He washed the shampoo out of his hair and started washing the rest of his body. It felt so strange, but a part of him felt okay with it as long as he didn’t think too hard about it. As he washed his groin, he looked at his still half-hard dick peeking out from his foreskin. He had heard from other guy friends who were uncircumcised that you had to be particularly careful in cleaning a foreskin, but he had no experience with the details of how to do so. As he soaped up his dick, he started thinking about Alice. They were already sexually active, so it was not too difficult to normally get himself easily hard thinking about her sexy body. But apparently the stress of everything that had happened that day was causing him to struggle to stay hard. He focused on the feeling of masturbating itself, and that seemed to help, especially with his “new” foreskin adding to the sensitivity of it all, but he wasn’t quite reaching that point of imminent orgasm. As he let his mind wander, an image popped into his head. It was a Hispanic teen boy with thick, curly black hair and a dazzling smile. The image seemed to do the trick and push him over the threshold. He came quickly and suddenly, shooting out several shots of cum against the shower wall.<br />
<br />
*Whoa…that was intense,* he thought. *Where did that guy come from, though? That’s weird…” Tom was definitely not gay, and he couldn’t recall ever having seen that kid before in his life. He shook his head and washed off his groin where some semen had dripped out when he orgasmed. He washed his face and exited the shower, drying off with the nearby towel. He chalked up the experience to still getting used to this new body. Of course, it would be weird to try to masturbate this body the same way he did in his old body. Especially with a different sized dick and foreskin. Maybe it was just a matter of figuring out the right position or stimuli. Still, he had been impressed with the intensity of his orgasm.<br />
<br />
He slipped on the athletic shorts that he had worn earlier. He had only worn them for about an hour, and they still smelled clean. He took the other clothes and draped them over the top of the box with all of the kid’s belongings to wear the next day. He went to the bed to lie down but found himself oddly energetic. *Well, I guess the kid was unconscious for most of the day. My body’s probably just still full of energy.*<br />
<br />
He got out of bed and started doing push-ups, which he normally did to help release excess energy before bed. However, he found that this new body did not have the same strength he did in his old one, and he found himself tired out after 10 pushups. *Ugh! It’s going to take forever to get back into my old workout routine,* he thought. He turned on the TV and flipped until he found something to watch, but he felt like there was nothing interesting on to keep his attention. He pulled out his phone and tried to play some games instead, but he quickly got bored of each of his normal games after just a couple of minutes. His thoughts kept racing through his head about everything that had happened, and everything that was going to happen. He felt like he couldn’t focus on anything.<br />
<br />
He started walking around the room, and he felt himself drawn to the box of clothes. Part of him wanted to go through it all and see what was all in there, but as he approached it, he felt his racing thoughts calm down slightly. He leaned into the box and breathed in the faint aroma that he had smelled earlier, a heavy incense or something that he was certain he had smelled before, but he couldn’t quite place where. While it helped calm his thoughts down a little, he still felt restless and energetic.<br />
<br />
“Maybe this is a side effect of the procedure,” he said aloud. “I should probably page the nurse and tell Dr. Pinkerton.”<br />
<br />
He went over to page the nurse but got distracted when he saw a notification on his phone. Grumbling about having to type in his passcode again, he typed it in and then decided to update the Face ID for his phone so he wouldn’t have to keep typing in his passcode. After having completed that, he thought there was something else he needed to do, but he couldn’t remember what it was. <br />
<br />
He got up from the bed and started pacing, and then realized that he had forgotten to call the nurse. *Damn, this procedure’s got me all scatterbrained,* he thought. *Gotta call the nurse.*<br />
<br />
He pressed the page button by his bed, and a minute later one of the nurses came into the room. <br />
<br />
“Hi, I’m having trouble sleeping. Can you see if Dr. Pinkerton can prescribe me something to help rest?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“Sure, I’ll call the doctor and if we get a prescription, I can get you something to help sleep,” she replied.<br />
<br />
“Thank you so much!” Tom said.<br />
<br />
As the nurse left, Tom went over to the window to look outside. His window looked out into the parking lot of the hospital, which at this time of the night was mostly deserted. He quickly grew bored and returned to the bed to check his phone when he realized that he still had a notification. He looked and saw that he had a missed text from Alice, who was telling him that she got home safely and reminding him to text her in the morning when he was getting discharged. He quickly responded and told her he would.<br />
<br />
The nurse came back into the room with the medicine and a glass of water. “The Doctor gave you a one-time prescription of trazadone for tonight. He said that if you have any more difficulty sleeping to set up an appointment with him, as you may be having some sort of new side effect from the procedure.”<br />
<br />
“I understand,” Tom said, taking the medicine and the water from the nurse. After taking the pills, Tom thanked the nurse and went to lie down in bed. He still felt jittery, but after a few minutes, he finally felt sleepiness start to overtake him, and within another few minutes, he was sound asleep.</p>
