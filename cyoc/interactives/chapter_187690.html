<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>- Pearl, Level 12 female Catfolk (Margay) Rogue (9)/Courtesan (3)</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luma strode back into her throne room. Two fresh slave girls stood at attention, waiting for her to dismiss Asphodel and Mayflower. This she promptly did, allowing the humans to finally go and wash off their coating of cum. She had telepathically summoned her chosen spy already, so all she had to do now was lounge upon her throne while the slave girls, Elves this time, began their shifts in attendance on her.<br />
<br />
In the few minutes it took her slave to reach her, she fondled a breast while imagining all the ways she could use the Tome of Change. Dethroning the Witch Queen would be just the beginning, though the Lady relished the ways she might sluttify that uptight bitch. But beyond that... there were whole worlds to conquer and drown in her sweet, sexual ambrosia.<br />
<br />
Soon however her agent humbly announced herself and Luma opened the doors for her. In walked a lithe margay girl, her fur an unusual delicate shade of pink blotched with hot pink rosettes and spots.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for calling me, Mistress,&quot; she said, kneeling down. Her collar bore the bronze medallion of common slave, but this particular whore was also a Rogue. Luma had been impressed with her skills at burglary, and seen to it that she continued to practice them when not servicing clients. Now -- gods of lust willing -- that investment would pay off.<br />
<br />
&quot;How may I serve you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come here, slave, and make yourself comfortable.&quot; Luma patted her lap, and the feline obediently got up and ascended the dais. Luma shifted to more comfortably hold the pink kitty, cradling her with her tails, smiling fondly on her slave as she remembered how Pearl had come into her ownership.<br />
<br />
<i>The Pleasure Palace was famous for many things, among them its treasury. Three Rogues -- all decently seasoned in this bizarre world -- had made a compact to break in and purloin as much as they could carry. Peter, who had become a margay morph to enhance his agility, was possibly the best of the trio, though he had not been the leader.<br />
<br />
By the time he breached the Palace&#39;s vault, though, he was the only one remaining. The first Rogue had been caught outright by the Palace&#39;s guards, transformed, made into a moaning slut and deflowered in just minutes after they laid hands on her. The second had botched disarming a magic trap, and been turned into a slime girl composed of aromatic perfumes and aphrodisiac drugs for his mistake. Peter would likely have caught by her in turn had he not fortified himself with a copious amount of anaphrodisiacs.<br />
<br />
But now, here he was; and Luma Lerouge&#39;s treasury did not disappoint. It was full of erotic statues and idols cast in various precious metals, or set with gems; fragile vases of porcelain; enchanted alabaster perfumeries... wealth beyond the dreams of avarice, magic to make an archmage die of envy, and all molded after the pattern of Luma&#39;s own lascivious heart.<br />
<br />
He tried a detect magic scroll, but the scroll burnt to ash overwhelmed; givign only a flash of revelation that apparently everything here was enchanted. He would have to take his chances.<br />
<br />
His first choice was an ordinary-looking chest, which after disarming the magical lock turned out to be full of ordinary electrum coins. These he filled his pockets with. Then he set his sights on something more exotic -- a fist-sized pink pearl, which a mermaid statue was cradling in her generous cleavage.<br />
<br />
Gingerly he set the fingers of his left hand on it, and immediately felt ice run up his arm. His hand stiffened into mother-of-pearl, tawny gold and black fur replaced with smooth pink.<br />
<br />
Instantly he snatched the hand back, and the transmutation of his flesh slowed -- but did not stop, the shiny smoothness and soft colour continuing to seep up his arm. And he felt heat growing in his chest and his butt. He stumbled, barely catching himself in a crouch, as his figure slimmed a bit, mass transferring into budding breasts and girly hips. He also felt a tightening about his genitals, but it did nothing to them except leave them painfully aroused, the anaphrodisiacs failing in the face of the pearl&#39;s curse.<br />
<br />
Suppressing a whimper, he dropped his trousers, and began rubbing himself with his remaining hand. Torn between lust, fear and greed, his eyes roved around the cursed trove, until they alighted on a large, golden dildo with a bejewelled canid knot. He felt his breasts and hips swell just looking at it, but he could not help himself. Driven by mounting need, he staggered over to it, picked it up, and touched the heavy toy to his own engorged member.<br />
<br />
Frotting himself with a dildo was a novelty -- and one that did not last long. For -- as he would have guessed if he were rational -- the contact completed his transition to a full-figured female, and he was soon mrowling and mewling as needily as the first Rogue had been. Then his head swam, the room blurred, and when he could focus on anything again, he found himself looking down at a taut, white-furred belly, his hand clutched around a much fleshier and hotter red knot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well; it seems my decoy cock caught a naughty little kitty.&quot; Peter forced his head up, his terrified eyes trailing past mountainous boobs and an array of vulpine fangs bared in lusty smirk to meet the hot gaze of the Lady of the Palace -- and, he knew immediately, his Mistress from then on.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you&#39;ll find the real one is far more precious to you, my little slut...&quot; He felt her hand guide his own from her maleness to his own pendulous bosom, before her tails wrapped around him to give her leverage...</i><br />
<br />
Pearl was in much the same situation now. Luma seemed to enjoy fucking her pink margay in her lap, reliving that first meeting. Probably not as much as Pearl did, though, once again mewling in want for that hard intruder and its hot, wet gift; to be reminded of owe much she owed her Mistress. Luma had lifted the nacrefication curse from her, and Pearl could never express her gratitude enough for being allowed to remain flesh, never mind being turned into a slutty margay.<br />
<br />
(Although, to her abashment, the curse did have a lingering effect. Sometimes, for a week or a few months, she would come begging to Luma; and the Mistress would render her entirely to mother-of-pearl, installing the still-conscious statue in her bedroom: there to watch the Mistress play with herself, her concubines or her guests. And, in the long hours of Luma&#39;s daily absence, to revel in her own helplessness and humiliation as erotic decoration, unable herself to soothe the burning of her nacreous body for amorous gaze and touch.)<br />
<br />
Once the vixen&#39;s knot was tightly wedged in the pussy&#39;s pussy, she began to tell her slave of Tyana&#39;s news and the mission she had for her. Pearl&#39;s ears perked and her eyes lit; like Tyana, she was all too eager to secure world domination for her Mistress.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go to Celephais -- I&#39;m sure that is where this &#39;Guild&#39; was heading, and if not it will be easy to track them from there. Ingratiate yourself with them, especially this Kelly, and find out if the book she has really is this Tome. Once you know, contact me and report. We&#39;ll make further plans from there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Mistress Luma,&quot; purred Pearl, nuzzling between Luma&#39;s breasts. The Mistress scratched her ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luma&#39;s knot was still a little swollen; but Pearl being a feline she did not have the constrictor muscles to lock it in place, so Luma was easily able to pop her off. With a final kiss and tail-swat to her bottom, the Lady sent her slave to prepare for her journey to Celephais. Then she also rose, to herself prepare for the entertainment of guests. Luma was Lady and Mistress, but she was still a whore herself -- for her own pleasure servicing choice guests with her mind and body. And her guests this evening were very choice indeed.</p>
