<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff looked to both his options and one option popped into his head.  Apparently, his baby sister wasn&#39;t the only sister in the household.  Turns out, Katie was in her room, next to his and streaming those girly cartoon shows on her tablet.  And considering he never got the chance in seeing her baby sister getting deleted, why not Katie as well.  With that thought in mind, he decided to start with his younger sister.  But first, he needs to call her out.  Turning to the open doorway, he yelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Katie!  Can you come to my room?  I want to talk to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
He waited for her to respond and heard back in an annoying girly tone, &quot;Okay...  I&#39;m coming.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hearing that with glee, he soon headed to the Chronivac that had the deletion package on and started to type her name.  By the time he soon hit Delete, another warning popped up as it says...<br />
<br />
‘Are you sure you wish to delete Katie McCarran. Removing her will mean he will be lost and never recovered.’<br />
<br />
He rubbed his hands in anticipation as he hovered the pointer over to the Yes option.  As he did that...<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want, loser?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hearing that voice, he turned to see his ten-year-old sister standing at the doorway, looking annoyed that he called her.  At ten, she was already starting to experience puberty early with her arms and legs longer then her body and head.  And althrough she was wearing a pink Barbie shirt, and blue jean short shorts, she could feel her nipples iching and her hips starting to expand.  She also had on pink Barbie sneakers with white socks and to up her mid calf and a barbie watch on her wrist.  Her blond shoulder hair was done up into two lower pigtails as she has some light make up on her face.  No doubt, Katie was starting to grow up as in a couple of years, she would be a teenage bombshell in no time.  But once Jeff starts the program, she will never reach her teendom.<br />
<br />
Katie crossed her arms and had a mean look on her face.  &quot;This better be good, dweeb.  I was in the middle of watching the Barbie movie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff knew that he was going to see his sister one last time and wanted to witness her early end.  But he has to play it cool as he smiled warmly and said, &quot;Oh...  It is good.&quot;  He soon hit the Yes option and a new message said...<br />
<br />
‘Deletion in progress… Please stand by…’<br />
<br />
As the progress bar slowly starts to rise, Jeff turned to her sister while sitting on his gamer chair and said, &quot;Now...  We&#39;ve had our differences, you and I.  I was meant to be your older sibling until you follow Amanda and wanted to be like her.  But still, I know that deep down you care for me.  After all, we&#39;re siblings and we always care for each other.  And while you don&#39;t look it, you always care for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie heard that and raised an eyebrow.  She was confused on why he&#39;s acting all nice all of a sudden and rolled her eyes in annoyance.  &quot;Right...  Are you okay, dickhead.  Cause you are acting really shifty.  Are you pulling some kind of prank?  Because if that&#39;s the case, when mom and dad get home, I swear to-&quot;<br />
<br />
Almost immediately, Katie stopped mid sentence as her eyes glazed over and was in a trance. Her arms flopped down and she was stiff like a rock<br />
<br />
Jeff looked at her and realized something happen.  Standing up, he approached her frozen sister and bend down to her level.  &quot;Katie...  Are you okay?&quot; he asked as he waved his hand over her eyes and snapped his fingers to wake her up.  But for some reason, she didn&#39;t respond at all.  What Jeff didn&#39;t know is that the deletion process has just started as the program began to cease Katie&#39;s bodily functions.  Her lungs stopped producing air, her heart stopped beating, and her brain was shut down.  It was as if she was dead, yet at the same time alive, as she stood in place like that of a statue.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked on and knew that it was the Chronivac that did that.  &quot;Huh...  Guess that deletion is already taken place.  Let&#39;s see how it turned out.&quot; he said as he was on his knees to get a better look at Katie&#39;s erasure from existence.<br />
<br />
As he watches, he could see the next phase of deletion taking place.  The laces of Katie&#39;s sneakers begin to untie themselves until they grow smaller, going through the holes until they vanished completely.  Then the Barbie stitches unstitch themselves and the soles around his feet curled up and exposed her socks, sinking right up into the soles.  And then the soles begin to shrink under her feet until they disappeared completely.  Once the shoes were gone, her socks were next to go at the tips unravel to expose her toes with pink nail polished nails and traveling up her feet.  As soon as they were gone, the seams of her blue jean shorts were unraveling as well and traveled up her thighs.  Reaching the top, the zipper lost it’s metal and the button grew smaller until it popped out of existence.  the unraveling spread around her waist until is disappeared into the ether.  With her shorts gone, her pink shirt was next as the bottom seams of her waist and upper arms unravel and spread up her chest and shoulders before that too was long gone.  Her digital pink watch he had one was affected as well as digital display malfunctioned and turned off and surface of the watch crumpled and was removed.  The circuitry soon broke apart and deteriorate until it was bare and the ring around it lessened from the inside and wiped away.  The leather straps of the watch soon unravel from the spot where the watch was and the buckle end popped out of existence, leaving her wrist bare.   The strings on her pigtails snapped and vanished, letting her blonde hair flows down her back.  The only thing that was left were the pink underwear he had on until it too unstitched itself and vanishes away, exposing her vagina and rear.<br />
<br />
Seeing that, Jeff witness her clothing removed automatically, leaving Katie completely naked in front of him.  Jeff was a bit surprised at first and understood why that happened.  &quot;Guess Katie doesn&#39;t need any clothes with her.  Just seeing her naked is really...strange.&quot; he said to himself.  Looking at her nude body, she could see the flared hips and pointy nipples and confirmed that she was starting puberty.  &quot;Heh...  Guess Katie was starting her journey into teendom.  Too bad for her that she won&#39;t live through it.&quot; she he said with a devious smirk on his face.<br />
<br />
Watching on, Jeff witnessed the next stage of removing Katie.  All around her body, small pieces of Katie were starting to be removed.  The nails on her fingers and toes complete with nail polish shrank into the skin and sucked up completely.  Her belly button filled in and there was no evidence of it while her pointy nipples flatten and shrank until they too popped out of existence, leaving her chest completely bare.  The blemishes and birthmarks she had on her faded out, leaving her skin completely smooth and clean.  The blonde hair shrank up her back until it&#39;s on top of her head before leaving her completely bald.  Pieces of her head started to disappear one by one as her eyes automatically close and zip up with the lashes sinking into the skin, eyebrows thinning and vanishing, earlobes growing smaller to nothing and the holes sealed shut, nose flattening and the two nostrils closing, and lips getting ironed out and the mouth sealed shut.  This in turn left Katie&#39;s head completely blank with no definition what so ever.  Her ass soon followed suit as the cheeks merged together and the anus collapsed and closed off completely, leaving behind a smooth rear.  The only thing that was left is her small pussy as it zipped up like a zipper and left behind a smooth surface.  Soon enough, Katie didn’t look like Katie at all, just a mannequin made out of flesh.<br />
<br />
Jeff was in awe at what Katie is going through and out of curiosity, he touched the fleshy stomach and was amused by how she looked.  &quot;Whoa...  That&#39;s so weird.  Katie looks like a fleshy mannequin.  And for some reason, I feel satisfied with this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course, Jeff doesn&#39;t realize the next stage commenced inside Katie&#39;s body.  All the veins of her body retracted throughout her body until they reach the heart before it begins to shrivel and dry up to become non-existent.  Her lungs, kidney’s and liver deflated like a bunch of balloons until they too were no more.  Her intestines and digestive system crawled upwards and unknotted themselves until it reach the stomach.  The stomach soon was drained away sagged before it shriveled up and vanished.  Her ovaries shriveled away and tubing was drained completely while the start of a womb for her deflated and thinned, removing all of her plumbing where her immature vagina used to be.  Her eyes over his sealed lids popped into the skull and sucked into the brain, absorbing it completely.  Her tongue grew smaller and melted right into her mouth while her uvula rose up and absorb into the top part of the mouth.  All of her teeth got sucked into her gums one at a time until it was left toothless as the gums rose up and disappear in the ridge of her mouth.  The brain dissolve away, growing smaller and smaller until it was no more.  All the muscles in her body deteriorated away until they were mostly hollowed out, but the muscles on the outside remain intact.  Lastly, her bones break apart and turned into dust, vanishing away to nothing.  Soon enough, the inside of Katie’s body is completely hollowed out while the outside remained standing like a normal human being.  Course, Jeff didn&#39;t see it as he was focused on the fleshy mannequin Katie in front of him.  But when the next stage of deletion occurred, that&#39;s what he was expecting.<br />
<br />
On the fifth phase, what’s left of Katie&#39;s body begins to be removed.  Each of her fingers and toes were slowly sink into her hands and feet leaving each of them digitless. Then her hands and feet begin to sink into the wrists and ankles.  Her legs and lower arms soon shrank upwards to her knees and elbows.  Finally, her thighs and upper arms went all the way up to her hips and shoulders. Soon enough, her body was completely limbless and even if she doesn’t have any feet or legs, her body was still floating in the air like that of a physical ghost.  Her blank head was next to go as the neck shrank downwards until the upper body and head merged together.  The head soon started to melt and absorbed right to the top part until all that’s there is a floating torso.  The final changes soon came at the shoulders and hips rounded out and stomach and chest smoothed over, curving into a sphere made out of flesh. That sphere soon shrank more and more and was getting smaller and smaller until it popped out of existence.  Soon enough, Katie was no more as she was completely deleted from the real world.<br />
<br />
Jeff watched it all and was amazed at the end result.  &quot;Whoa!  So that&#39;s how the deletion works.  Very creepy...yet very cool.&quot;  Standing up, he still couldn&#39;t believe that her younger sister was deleted completed.  That&#39;s when he was curious about something.  &quot;Hmm...&quot; he stated, &quot;I wonder...&quot;<br />
<br />
Leaving his room, he approached Katie&#39;s room and wondered if what happened to her Baby sister&#39;s room is the same as Katie&#39;s.  Opening the door, he soon discovered that Katie&#39;s room was heavily altered as well.  Gone were the heavily pink Barbie themed room with bed, posters, and toys representing that overplayed doll.  In it&#39;s place is a gray studies room with shelves filled with various books and two comfy chairs and a round table for reading and relaxing.  Jeff was pleased with the end result on that end as there is nothing Katie related at all.  He soon turned to the family pictures and noticed that there were less pictures and could see the huge family photo where Katie and his baby sister was now had his parents, him, and Amanda.  This was proof that he successfully deleted both younger sisters.  Not to mention that everyone&#39;s minds were altered as people who know of Katie and the baby sister were erased for their minds.<br />
<br />
Leaving the studies and returned to his room, he lay on his gamer chair and looked at the computer of a new message that said...<br />
<br />
‘Deletion Complete’<br />
<br />
With a smirk, he knew that he did it.  He removed two of his younger sisters and feel more liberated then before.  But it&#39;s not over yet.  He still has one more sister to go, and it&#39;s his eldest in Amanda.  Once he removes her from existence, he will be free from all the annoyance and bullying from the three sisters.  Looking to the computer, he was ready to wrap it all up.</p>
