<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kaylee looked at Zackery with an appraising eye, but more like looking over their new star <br />
work hand than a new male to enjoy, after all, all she needed was Master, nothing more, <br />
nothing less.  'No matter how many more females we add to Master's collection now, we'll <br />
always be able to sate them when the master is not in the mood. ... I saw Zackery last <br />
night, he could have kept going until the cows came home, he only wound down when <br />
Pearl and the others did... It doesn't matter how many ladies we add to the pack now, <br />
Zackery is all they'll need, and Master is all I'll need.' <br />
<br />
 Already she was seeing some of the ladies look at Zackery with appraising eyes of their <br />
own with much more direct intentions in mind. Yes, they were the master only when you <br />
said he said you were, but Zackery would be much more achievable, making him the <br />
perfect distraction. She leaned against Master letting her paw feel her Master's body, <br />
'Perfect.' <br />
<br />
She looked at the three she wolves that now wore copies of her body, 'I almost wish <br />
Master HAD granted Isabelle's request... in spades... it would have been fun to see how big <br />
we could have made the knockers on a she wolf before they went past attraction and went <br />
into absurd territory....' Not to mention all the fantastic (some would say gaudy) colors for <br />
wolf fur she hadn't used yet. 'Oh well, you win some you lose some.'  <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Alice pulled the twins through the mirror, Darla of course accepted the victorian era dress <br />
she found herself in, what she hadn't expected was for Fran to suddenly be in one. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wha-what is this-?!&quot; Fran hadn't seen what had happened to Darla, and Darla had failed <br />
to mention it.  &quot;Alice?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this going to happen to everyone who comes in here?&quot; Fran point. <br />
<br />
&quot;I do think it shall only to those who are directly related to myself Mama.&quot; <br />
<br />
Fran was now wearing a victorian era dress much like Darla, only Fran's was purple were <br />
Darla's was red, and red where Darla's was purple. While Fran approved of the motif, <br />
suddenly wearing clothes again after nearly two days of going around in the fur was <br />
rather unbalancing, not to mention she had never ever worn a dress. <br />
<br />
&quot;Anything else I need to know?&quot; Fran asked her twin. <br />
<br />
Darla whispered back to her, pretending Alice couldn't hear her, &quot;Don't eat or drink <br />
anything that comes from in here, Alice said the stuff she takes out if it comes out at all <br />
turns to glass like her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...&quot; Fran's imagination took it from there and it wasn't pleasant. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please do sit down and dine with me Mama and Auntie.&quot; Alice helped them to a set of <br />
chairs and a table out of view of the mirror. Darla noted it was different from yesterday, <br />
had Alice set it up herself when alone in here? <br />
<br />
Fran asked, &quot;Alice, we all love the upgrades the game's given it but... somehow you seem <br />
more... happy about it than others...&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice turned looked at her aunt her arms behind her back and said, &quot;Adam had no one. <br />
Alice has a mother, a father, an auntie, cousins, and half-siblings... everyone else gave up <br />
something I do declare if I would be so bold when becoming part of the pack, I on the <br />
other hand as Adam lost nothing.&quot; <br />
<br />
The three blond wolves sat down and Alice provided KNIVES AND FORKS, when the twins <br />
took hesitantly but they were large enough for them to use. <br />
<br />
<br />
Fran asked Alice, &quot;So when you gave the Transform to Mark and Marcine, why gold fur <br />
with a nuance of brown anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice was eager to explain, &quot;It was for them to be a color that people do not see anywhere <br />
else, and to be an unmistakable marker on any deer they sired and their fawn sired, and so <br />
on and so forth and all of that.&quot; <br />
<br />
Fran nodded at her niece, &quot;Ah I see. Though don't you think that might attraction <br />
attention? The one thing we DON'T want for the pack?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Are there are professors who specialize in deer in Glendale? I did not know that.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;... No they're not... but I don't think it's really needed...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we have cross the bridges and we need to ride our train now.&quot; <br />
<br />
Darla defended her child, &quot;Well, remember sister, there wasn't anything besides the odd <br />
look when we were driving to the household... people will just brush it off as odd. If they <br />
just take a second look at most at naked wolf women, then deer of a different color won't <br />
flicker much on the radar.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I know sister. I'm just being careful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know also sister.&quot; <br />
<br />
Alice looked at her mother and aunt, 'Sometimes it is as if they share the same mind and <br />
happen to have two bodies, or maybe the right and left sides of the same brain perhaps? <br />
Or maybe two different sides of a congress, or-'<br />
<br />
&quot;So Alice dear.&quot; Darla began, &quot;What's on your mind? You seemed plenty eager to talk <br />
yesterday.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I spoke with Samantha and Abbey as Auntie asked yesterday Mama... Abbey wanted to <br />
come in and play with me, but of course I had to say no since Auntie and you told me I <br />
could not change her into a glass wolf... they seemed quite gay in meeting me after <br />
getting over their surprise.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fran remembered that yester-century, heck, yester-HALF-century the word gay had <br />
meant simply very happy and joyous. Of course Alice would use the classic term. <br />
<br />
&quot;And Julie?&quot; Fran asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was told that she was busy on the phone, so I could not speak to her, but I was <br />
promised that she would be told that you loved her very much Auntie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fran guessed that would have to do for now, Fran wanted all the 'testing' out of the way so <br />
Julie wouldn't be used as an experimental of the game. <br />
<br />
&quot;Auntie. Mama.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes dear?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have been thinking. Abbey really wanted to play with me within the mirror... and... you <br />
Julie to join the pack yes?&quot; They could tell Alice was unsure and nervous, usually whatever <br />
she said was precise and crystal clear even if her vocabulary could be odd. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Alice we do...&quot;  Fran said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I know you said you did not WANT your family as glass wolves like me but... are <br />
you shamed of me?&quot;<br />
<br />
This threw the twins totally for a loop, they simply had no idea what to say to this! <br />
<br />
Fran managed to answer first having more maternal experience, &quot;No no no Alice! I promise <br />
we aren't shamed of you! It's just... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just what Auntie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;.... &quot; For the first time, the twins felt disjointed and out of balance with each other, and it <br />
was a horrible feeling. &quot;... ... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just thought... if Abbey and Samantha were glass wolves like me, then maybe Samantha <br />
could be Julie's daughter, and Abbey could be your daughter, and we'd all be siblings and <br />
cousins at the same time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fran started, she hadn't even considered that possible angle. <br />
<br />
&quot;We'll... think about it Alice...&quot; Fran relented. With Zackery now in the picture, it seemed <br />
any new male would be surplus. But Fran still wanted to be united with Julie.. but being the <br />
MOTHER of one of her little girls? Something about that felt strangely appealing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is there a reason you want this Alice?&quot; Darla asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I overheard Master saying that after Fran's family we would not be actively looking <br />
for people to add to the pack ... and Abbey and Samantha are already family and... it <br />
wonderful in here... but it also gets lonely... &quot;<br />
<br />
Fran and Darla looked at each other instantly understanding. <br />
<br />
The twins put a paw each on Alice's seven and a half year old shoulders. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Alice,&quot; The twins said together, &quot;We promise we will seriously consider it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice nodded and bow at the table rather than her normal curtsy which was odd for her, <br />
&quot;Thank you... very much...&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Jensen scratched at his bandaged leg, he really needed to change the bandages. Kaylee <br />
noticed him scratching and knew she had to ask Darla more about those lessons in first <br />
aid they had talked about. <br />
<br />
The lesser she wolves chatter among themselves, sharing stories of their ordeals getting <br />
everything done and up to standard for Master last night (or was that this morning?). <br />
<br />
&quot;I never want to look at another antique again...&quot; Lawrence said, while being asked to do <br />
something by a female of the pack was an honor to be embraced with zeal with Lawrence <br />
had done so, he was happy that it was over. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder if Jenny and Bart want to be friends.&quot; The purple boy wolf Ulysses thoght seeing <br />
he eldest wolf kids discussing things. <br />
<br />
'Only way to know is to ask them.&quot; Roger answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;sometimes the direct approach is the best.&quot; Megan added setting on her knees close to <br />
her brother, her face covered in blood much like the other wolves here. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile Alice led her mother and Auntie out of the mirror world.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello.&quot; Alice greeted her siblings. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi.&quot; &quot;Hello.&quot; &quot;Yo.&quot; &quot;Hiii.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What shall happen today I wonder?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Work sadly.&quot; Bart said, &quot;We have to rearrange the paper work for three of the shadows. <br />
And I think we're all expected to join in father's inspection.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you may indeed call the last one work.&quot; Alice pointed at Kaylee who was now <br />
whispering, 'You stand by that portal, you two stand by that room' to the various she <br />
wolves with Caroline being the official 'tour guide.' <br />
<br />
&quot;I do hope the inspection does not take longer than two hours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why's that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because that is when Marcine and Jack will fully change and I think we should be there to <br />
bid fair well before they can no longer speak english. It's only fair, they've been hard <br />
workers and will provide the pack with an invaluable service, shall they not?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bart and Jenny looked at each other, then shrugged, &quot;I'll pass it along to dad, I'm sure he <br />
won't mind.&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
<br />
At ninety one percent, the couple decidedly looked more like deer with some human traits <br />
than human beings. Fran had arrived much to the deer's shock and worry, but she openly <br />
helped them remove the clothing that was now cutting into them. Now all that remained <br />
that was human was their human hair on top of their furry heads, some muscles in their <br />
four legs that made their hooves twitch, Jack's uncovered reproductive material, and <br />
Marcine's shrinking maternal material. <br />
<br />
Helped outside by Fran, the almost completely deer in the fur sunlight looked at each <br />
other. <br />
<br />
&quot;You are beautiful dear.&quot; Marcine said to Jack.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you are a  beautiful deer.&quot; Jack replied, both smiling while those facial muscled <br />
remained. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Thirty minute later the meat not even a puddle on the floor Kaylee said, assuming a <br />
'captain' pose with one hand on a hip and another pointing foreword to nowhere, &quot;Alright <br />
troops! Go wash up and assume your positions!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Alpha Female.&quot; The subordinates and began to file out, leaving only Martha and her <br />
charges, the alphas, twins, and Kaylee's three alt-copies. The dark blue Caroline remained <br />
at the doorway waiting for Master for the inspection to formally begin.</p>
