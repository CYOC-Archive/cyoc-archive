<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;puberty&quot; Mr. Bretman began &quot;is a period in developement when... blah blah blah...&quot; When ty heard this word he literally jumped in his seat. <br />
<br />
&quot;what the hell ty?!?&quot; Jason exclaimed &quot;oh, shit sorry, i just... uh... flinched you know?&quot; Ty replied...<br />
<br />
The word didnt seem to come with any noticable changes so far. Ty still listened to Mr Bretman monotonous lecture.&quot;Puberty causes major changes in the developement of an individual...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;There it was again!&quot; Ty thought, &quot;ok something must be happening now...&quot; But as ty was thinking this he was unconsciencely squirming around in his seat,  not aware that his wish applied to him too. <br />
<br />
Ty looked over to see jason, who was at the moment looking off at the wall with a blank stare. Ty looked at him carefully and watched his friend. Ty noticed Jason was moveing around in his seat, almost like he was uncomfortable, Thats when he realized that Jason wasnt the only one uncomfortable, all the guys in the room looked at least a little uncomfortable in their seats, even ty. Ty still couldnt understand why he felt a little awkward. Then ty reached his hand under his desk, adusting himself nonchalantly. It then finally dawned on him, that his wish also applied to him. A small grin crawed across Ty's face.<br />
<br />
&quot;also the other effects associated with puberty are...&quot;<br />
<br />
There was that word again, and then he said it once more: <br />
<br />
&quot;this period we call puberty lasts...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;now&quot; thought ty &quot;he has said it four times...&quot; Ty could feel a warm sensation spreading out in his groin, and his stomach itched, it itched like he had been bitten by some mosquito, actually so did his legs... all over his legs, but the sensation was much less severe- and his arm pits too. Ty reached down to scrach his stomach which was really starting to bother him. <br />
<br />
As ty scrached he realized he wasnt alone, Jason was scranching his leg, another guy across the room was scraching his arm pit, and Mich, a 15 year old was nearby, scraching his face. Ty knew imediatly what was going on, and he could tell that hair was forming around his belly button as it iched. Ty could almost feel his leg hair growing, and he could see the same thing was happening to jason. He silently observed the changes happening to Jason and his classmates. Some of them looked, maybe, just maybe, a little older. One guy seemed to have grown a little moustache since class had begun, and while still rubbing his somach, ty could feel the Happy trail that was rapidly forming on his belly- those thin little hairs which spread down all the way to his pubic hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;and this is fundemental in development and puberty...  this section will help you understand the effect puberty has on...&quot; <br />
<br />
two more times! &quot;this is getting good...&quot; ty thought. Ty looked around the room some more. All the guys in the room looked, maybe, possibly a little upset. Jason meanwhile was starting to look older, Ty could tell allready that Jason had aged a good year or more. Actually, a lot of the guys in the room were looking older than they normally did a little older. Ty moved his hand across his chin, feeling it he knew his features too, were changing. His jawline,felt a little sharper, amybe a little more angular.Ty could even feel the traces of hair on his upper lip, hair which he knew wasnt going to stop spreading. <br />
<br />
The warm sensation in his crotch was getting more intense, the itching around his belly button was back, and the same on his legs. Ty knew his body was changing, fast.<br />
<br />
&quot;and puberty is essential...puberty is a stage that all animals go through...&quot;<br />
<br />
Twice! again with that word! Ty was no longer focused on Mr. Bretmpns dull lecture, but now he was facinated by the changes he was going through... Ty shifted his weight in the seat, feeling a little awkward again, but as ty moved around a little bit, he could feel something, his shirt! it was smaller on him! or at least it felt that way, especially across the shoulders, the sleaves seemed shorter somehow, revealing his small (yet oddly toned) biceps. He was growing! Even his pants felt smaller around him, his legs pushing farther out than they did before, and when he went to scrach his arm pit, ty could feel a thick mass of hair- hair that wasnt there this morning.  <br />
<br />
Ty looked back to his friend jason, and noticed first off, the amount of facial hair which seemed to have suddenly appeared on his chin. Not only that, but he was starting to grow sideburns, the hair seemed like it was growing right before his eyes. <br />
<br />
Jason turned his head and looked right at Ty.<br />
&quot;dude ty! you need to shave! when did you start growing a goatee?!?&quot;<br />
&quot;uhhhh... huh?&quot; ty replied &quot;Jason, look at yourself, you need to shave more than i do!&quot; Something else was different though, both of their voices had grown deeper since class has begun. Mr Bretmon, who seemed to be awkward himself, stoped reading and looked at the two boys, then quickly returned to his reading. <br />
<br />
Jason looked confused, but he placed his hands along his chin, and a look of surprise sweapt over his face. &quot;shit, Ty, what the hell happened to us? you voice sounds all different&quot; Jason wispered right back to ty. &quot;dude, we arnt the only ones&quot; pointing to Mich, who was practically sporting a beard. Not only that, but his shirt now looked two sized too small on his grwoing body, his pecs seemed to puncture theough the fabric of his shirt. <br />
<br />
Not only that but Mr. Bretmon looked different too. He had, since class had begun, grown a slight five o clock shadow, and his shirt was starting to look small on him too... especially around the chest, where it looked like the buttons were starting to strain...<br />
<br />
&quot;what the hell is happening to all the guys???&quot; Jason mumbled.<br />
<br />
This was getting to be really fun for ty, who was now quite aroused by the changes to his body, and to his classmates. <br />
<br />
&quot;and puberty...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty looked down at his stomach, it was itching worse than before. He pulled up the fabric just to take a glance at his stomach, and when he did Ty was shocked. His once thin trail of hairs was now much, much thicker. Hair covered all of his stomach actually. Dark brown hairs, spreading from the center of his stomach outward and upwards. It wasnt done growing either, ty could tell, it was quickly spreading up to his chest too... &quot;With Bretmon saying that work maybe two more times... well then i will have chest hair too..&quot; Ty thought to himself. Jason meanwhile, was still in shock, rubbing his chest and face, watching as his male classmates did the same...</p>
