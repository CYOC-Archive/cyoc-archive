<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Might be a good idea.  Unless you're having second thoughts about me.&quot;  Sean said as he stood up, giving Dan another kiss.  &quot;I have a feeling you're not though.&quot;  He heard the tumblers in the door to the apartment clicking.  Jay was home.  He'd finished changing Dan.  Maybe it was time for a new target.  &quot;You try and get used to that big body of yours. Maybe take another shower.  You've gotten a bit... uh... sticky since the last one.&quot; Sean said as he toweled himself off with a discarded shirt on the floor, and got his pants back on.  Dan nodded and watched the bubble butt of his roommate run out the door, letting out a contented sigh.<br />
<br />
Sean ran to his bedroom to start the scanner on the chronivac to grab Jay's info.  Jay was walking down the hall, passing by Sean's bedroom just as the scanner whirred to life.  &quot;Hey Sean.&quot;  Was all he muttered as he walked by rifling through mail he'd picked up on the way in.  &quot;Hey, Jay.&quot; Sean said as he watched the statistics compile.<br />
<br />
Jay's new window came up.<br />
Gender: Male<br />
Age: 24<br />
Height: 5'11&quot;<br />
Weight: 190 pounds.<br />
 <br />
His build was listed as Athletic with some bodyfat.<br />
<br />
It was taking some time to compile other info.  Sexuality, and some more... private info was calculating, but Sean had access to plenty of options while he waited.  He wondered what he could do to Jay.  His mind kept racing to how hot it was to fatten up Dan...  he could do the same for Jay.  That way he'd be the fit, hot one in the apartment, and he'd have two butterballs to keep him company.  But... he lucked out with Dan.  He knew he did.  It was sheer coincidence that Dan fantasized about being fat like he did.  Jay likely didn't hold those same fantasies.  There was no way to know what he could be into either.<br />
<br />
Sean tapped the table a bit... maybe he didn't need to know Jay's fantasies.  Maybe he could give him a new one.  He flipped to the Mental tab.  He looked through, hovering over options.  The same ones as before.  Nothing about sexual preferences aside from gender preferences.  Nothing about fantasies...  he hovered over memory for a moment.  An empty text box popped up, and a description came into view.<br />
<br />
&quot;The memory section can be used to both clear memories of specific times, or add new ones. For safety reasons, users are not able to erase a targets memories completely.  Targets will regain memories over a period of 24 hours.&quot;  Sean read.  That was probably a good idea.  What about adding them though... &quot;Adding memories can be done by typing a description of the desired memory into the text box.  Memories can be used to influence behaviors or reactions to stimulus that the target encounters. Complicated memories involving people other than the target may eventually be rejected as the stimuli may contradict their memories.  For best results, it is suggested that new memories involve only the target and changes to the targets own behaviors.  Grammatically awkward and incorrect memories will be rejected.&quot;<br />
<br />
  &quot;Okay...&quot; Sean said as his hands hovered over the keyboard.  This is what he was looking for.  He started to type. &quot;Recently, Jay has been noticing his obese roommate Dan.  He feels envious.  He's begun craving a fat body of his own. Fantasizing about fattening up gets him sexually charged, giving him the most intense erections of his life.  As a result, he's begun stuffing himself late at night when he thinks no one is watching, jerking off and rubbing his taut belly, dreaming about being bigger.&quot;  Sean looked at it.  That was probably enough... but now that he was typing... why not go further?  &quot;Jay doesn't know why he's begun to want this.  He doesn't want to be fat.  Every new pound is a slight source of panic for him, but he's overcome with the intense desire to grow that he only feels bothered by it a few moments when he thinks about it.  Then his mind fills with imagery of gaining weight.  His desires have become so strong that he's gone online, joining weight gain websites, making dates with men who promise to feed him to his goal.  He's especially attracted to forceful, dominant feeders who aim to get his weight as high as they can.&quot;<br />
<br />
  Sean didn't even check if Jay was gay.  He didn't think he was... but he'd be into guys for this, it seemed. He clicked save and grabbed the emmitter, aiming it down the hallway at Jay, who was sitting at the desk in the doorway of his bedroom.  There was a zap, and Jay swatted an invisible fly.  He was looking at a bill.  He made a huffing sound and got up, walking to Dan's doorway and knocking.  &quot;Dan, get out here for a second, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
  He stood and waited. Dan didn't want to come out... probably because he thought Jay was going to lose his mind with the drastic change he'd gone through tonight.  Sean smirked &quot;It's okay Dan, he already knows.  Come on out!&quot; He shouted down the hall.  A brief silence, followed by the turning of the mechanism in Dan's doorknob.  It opened, and the bulging ball of flab that Dan had become stood there, doing his best to &quot;cover up&quot; with a towel slightly too small for his waist.  He waited for Jay to freak, but he didn't.  <br />
<br />
  &quot;Have you been torrenting a lot of TV shows again?  Our internet bill has a bigass fee tacked on it for going over our limit again...&quot;  He said showing it to him, Jay was annoyed for sure... but he looked over the soft, supple curves of Dan's big body. He bit his lip slightly. &quot;Oh shit... sorry, I must've left a torrent going.  I'll take care of the fee, I promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm?&quot;  Jay said, snapping out of his oogling a moment. &quot;Oh, yeah, good.  Thanks.  Sorry for shouting at you to come out.  You could've gotten dressed first.  I don't mind.&quot;  he said with an awkward laugh.  Dan looked at him with curiosity &quot;I don't exactly  have anything to fit me..&quot;<br />
Jay just nodded and tried to look away &quot;right, of course.  You're a bit guy.  Clothes are tough to find...  anyway, thanks again.&quot;  He shrugged and started to walk away down the hall.  Sean decided to follow him.  Jay rounded the corner in the hall and headed towards the kitchen, Sean a few steps behind him.<br />
<br />
  &quot;Checking out Dan's gut, huh?&quot;  He asked, smirking.  Jay looked insulted.  &quot;O-of course not, you freak.  Why would I do that?&quot;  he went quiet &quot;but... is it just me, or has he put on some more weight recently?&quot;<br />
<br />
  Sean leaned on the counter while Jay dug in the fridge. &quot;It's not just you.  He's packed on a few.  I made sure of that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;  Jay said, darting back out of the fridge.<br />
<br />
Sean laughed &quot;you're gonna call me a freak again, but I don't even care.  I can't keep my hands off him!  All that weight... fucking turn on man... the only bigger turn on is making him gain even more.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay popped the top on a beer and started to drink. &quot;Making... him gain more?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean nodded &quot;yep.  I stuff him every chance I get... I think I've put 50 pounds on him now...  planning on maybe another 100 or so more.  The bigger he gets, the better the sex!  I just can't help myself, even when he asks me to stop, or tells me he's getting too fat. No such thing I think...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay gulped, adjusted his bulging package. &quot;Really...  you don't say?&quot;  He gulped again, looked away from Sean. &quot;What... what do you think it feels like to be like Dan.  You think it's a turn on to be fat too, maybe?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean looked at him with mock amusement. &quot;Don't really know.  His mouth is usually too full during our times together for him to tell me... judging by the fact that he gets off with me just talking to him about how fat he is... probably is.  Why?  You curious?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay sputtered and laughed &quot;Course not.  haha... that'd be too weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean leaned over and gave his athletic roommates gut a poke. &quot;Don't lie, man.  I've seen you looking him up and down recently, having to adjust after your talks... plus, I've seen you stuffing yourself when you think we're gone to bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay was silent, pale, sweat beaded on his forehead.  Sean grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can show you what it's like, you know.  With my help, I bet we can fatten you up in no time.  I like my men a little on the big side, so I'm willing to get you there as quick as I can.  If that's too weird for you though, there's plenty of websites out there for you to hook up with other guys to make your little dream come true.  You'd be a hot fat guy too.  Probably give Dan a run for his money.  Not that either of would be able to run much at the size he is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay kept quiet, his lips trying to make a sound, trying to think of what to say.  &quot;D-do you think... we can start tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean grinned &quot;I don't see why not.&quot;</p>
