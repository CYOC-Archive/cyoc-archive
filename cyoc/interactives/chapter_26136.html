<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eleven Forty-Five in the Evening, September 25. West Lloyd Expressway.<br />
<br />
Vix was driving haphazardly back to the District Attorney’s Office with Lisa by her side. Once again, she felt fortunate that she was able to participate in another meeting with the pack. Dan was her primary objective. Everyone else was secondary to his demise, even Sharon. This could all end in the deaths of Dan and Lisa’s pack during the conflict, which would have been a boon for Vix. It’s just that she felt more connected to this pack and a part of her fears that she might regret if this ended as such. For now, she thought, a small time of regret is nothing compare to a life time of vengeance.<br />
<br />
“I’ve been wanting to ask. Who’s this, dear?” Lisa pointed to a small picture dangling off the neck of the rear view mirror.<br />
<br />
Vix slowed down her mustang and replied, “That’s my father.”<br />
<br />
Lisa looked at the picture closer. It was a middle aged man with balding blond hair. He was holding a small fish on a hook with one hand and holding on to a little girl on his shoulder with the other. Lisa figured it must have been Vix at a young age. “How is he?”<br />
<br />
“Dead,” Vix coldly said.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry, dear.” Lisa sympathized. “If you don’t mind, how did he die?”<br />
<br />
Vix’s face flushed. She couldn’t keep personal secrets if she was to maintain Lisa’s trust. “He was killed in the line of duty.”<br />
<br />
“Was he a police officer?” Lisa noticed Vix’s change from her composed state.<br />
<br />
“No, a federal agent,” Vix corrected. She knew Lisa was trying to dig up something that could influence her, but nothing will change her mind of accepting Lisa’s offer to join.<br />
<br />
“He would be proud to see what you’re doing now, dear.” Lisa smiled.<br />
<br />
“Maybe,” Vix said with uncertainty. <br />
<br />
Lisa opens her cell phone and speed dials a number. “Who are you calling?” inquired Vix.<br />
<br />
“Wendy,” Lisa said solemnly, “She needs to know.” Vix started wonder about how Wendy can be a part in all this.<br />
<br />
“Let’s pay her a visit then,” Vix exited the freeway.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
At the Holy Cross hospital in Evansville, Wendy had already made a complete recovery of her injuries. The visits by her parents as well as the calls from her coven members had helped her during the process. Her family was worried and she assured them that she was doing well. What she didn’t tell them was her new condition of being a lycanthrope. They’ve been through enough already, she had concluded.<br />
<br />
Now, Wendy couldn’t go asleep. She wasn’t used to sitting around doing nothing. She wanted to know what was going on with the FBI’s hunt for Dan and what her coven was going decide to do about it. She felt helpless having to stay in the hospital under Doctor Van Pelt’s supervision. Wendy had discarded the hospital gown and was wearing her usual clothes. In about twelve more hours, Wendy thought, I’ll be out of here.<br />
<br />
Her cell phone had started to vibrate next to her. She looked at the caller ID and saw it was Lisa on the other end. “Hey Lisa,” Wendy answered cheerfully.<br />
<br />
“Hello sweetheart, are you feeling better?”<br />
<br />
“Restless as ever,” Wendy sighed.<br />
<br />
“Wendy, I need to tell you something important.” Wendy listened attentively. “Dan has kidnapped Sharon.”<br />
<br />
Wendy felt her stomach turn. “What!? When did this happen?”<br />
<br />
“Less than an hour ago. We’re setting up a meeting for a plan to get her back.”<br />
<br />
Wendy had started to storm out of her room. “I want to be there.”<br />
<br />
“I thought that you won’t be released until this afternoon?”<br />
<br />
“Screw what the doctors think! Sharon’s life is on the line, I’m not going to wait while Dan has his way with her.” One of the nurses called out to Wendy while another spoke into an intercom. “Can you pick me up at the hospital?” Wendy hastily asked.<br />
<br />
“Hold it there Ms. Patel,” Doctor Van Pelt appeared. “You’re not discharged yet.”<br />
<br />
Wendy was going to say a witty remark when she was interrupted by Lisa. “Wendy, put the doctor on speaker.” She pushed a button and held out her phone.<br />
<br />
“This is Jennifer Grogan of the Evansville Resident Agency. Doctor Van Pelt, we’ve meet while I was visiting Ms. Patel.” Vix’s voice sounded clearly through the phone.<br />
<br />
“Yes, I remember,” Van Pelt replied.<br />
<br />
“Doctor, I need Wendy Patel discharged from the hospital effective immediately.”<br />
<br />
“For what reason?” he asked inquisitively.<br />
<br />
“Wendy Patel’s presence is needed, it is critical that she is released due to the nature of this investigation.”<br />
<br />
“Documents will need to be filled before I can authorize a release.”<br />
<br />
“You will fill out those documents after she is released. Doctor, those papers will take time which we currently do not have much of. There is a life endangered and the longer we wait, the less time we have to prepare. It is imperative to have her released,” Vix repeated.<br />
<br />
Wendy handed him her phone. The banter between Doctor Van Pelt and Vix continued. Wendy started to march on with Doctor Van Pelt behind her. Reaching to the end of the hall, Wendy waited impatiently as she pushed the elevator button still hearing the doctor making excuses over the cell phone.<br />
<br />
The elevator rises and opens, revealing a very irritated Vix and a smiling Lisa. Vix hangs up the cell phone and gives it back to Lisa. Then, she proceeded haughtily toward the nervous doctor. “We need to talk,” Vix said, her eyes narrowing.<br />
<br />
Wendy hugs Lisa, her eyes tearing up. Lisa gently soothes Wendy, brushing her hand on Wendy’s hair. “It’ll be okay dear, we’ll get through this together,” Lisa said understanding Wendy’s pain. They silently held on, feeling comforted in each other’s arms.<br />
<br />
Vix finished berating the doctor, having to snatch Wendy’s cell phone away from him. She then saw the pair in each other’s embrace. Her nerves calmed as she watched them. Lisa looked up at Vix and smiled. “I’ve convinced the doctor in discharging Wendy. We can go back to the office now,” Vix calmly stated. They all quietly entered the elevator.<br />
<br />
“Is she…” Wendy started asking a question.<br />
<br />
“No, dear. She’s helping us in getting Sharon back,” Lisa interrupted. Vix wasn’t theirs just yet.<br />
<br />
Vix looked over at the two and handed Wendy the cell phone. “Here, you’ll want this back,” Vix smiled.<br />
<br />
Wendy wasn’t sure what to think of this agent. She was there earlier blaming her of creating a situation with Dan. Now here she was helping in getting a discharge.<br />
<br />
Vix noticed the uneasy look in Wendy’s eyes. She was the only other person kept out of the loop. “Wendy, my name isn’t Jennifer Grogan and I’m not with the Evansville Resident Agency. I’m Special Agent Vix, sent by a different department of the FBI to look into matters of Dan’s operations. I was under orders to investigate both you and Dan of the confrontation that night. I see now that Dan is the culprit in all this and I’m doing what ever I can to make sure he doesn’t hurt anyone else.”<br />
<br />
Wendy took back her cell phone and started questioning Vix. “If you’re making sure he doesn’t hurt anyone else, than why has he kidnapped Sharon?” <br />
<br />
“I haven’t been as vigilant as I should have been with Dan. I was too caught up in making sure you’re not the reason for all this. I should have trusted your judgment, Wendy. For that, I do bear some responsibility for Sharon. That’s why I’m here.”<br />
<br />
Wendy saw it was pointless to blame her for all this. Vix was just doing her job, just like how Wendy did hers. There were still more questions. “Which department?”<br />
<br />
Lisa also looked over with interest. “I’m afraid that’s classified Wendy,” Vix hesitantly said.<br />
<br />
Wendy stared intently at Vix. There was something familiar about her now that she’s so close. “I know you from somewhere.”<br />
<br />
“Other than the fact that I visited you several days ago, I doubt it.” Vix smirked. “I’ll give you all the details on what happened so far.”<br />
<br />
“WE, you mean,” Lisa corrected. Vix nodded in agreement.<br />
<br />
Although Wendy was listening to the explanation of events from both of them, she was bothered that she had recognized Vix. She’d seen her before but where and when…</p>
