<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After checking out whatever changes have continued to occur to your body, you pull your shirt back down as far as it could go and frown as a sliver of skin still showed between your shirt and pants. You should probably borrow some clothes from George seeing as you were about the same height. For now at least. You shudder at the thought and slip back out of the bathroom. Nobody had hung about in the hallway for you but you could hear the noise of a television coming from down the hall. <br />
<br />
You follow the sound and enter a large, cluttered living room. A flat screen TV was playing one of your favourite cartoons that you enjoyed watching with your brother, but at the moment it wasn&#39;t all that comforting to you. George and Colby were sitting on the sofa in front of you, engrossed in the show. You were about to grab their attention when some slapstick humour occurred and there was a loud, childish laugh to your right. You freeze and turn to see your brother was sitting there watching the show! Had he seen you? Did he notice that you looked different? Cautiously, you clear your throat and say &quot;Hey Tim, how&#39;s the show?&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! It&#39;s pretty good&quot; he replied without taking his eyes off the screen, to your relief. &quot;It&#39;s one of the old episodes where they help that tiny elephant, I forget her name, to find a special crystal apple in that creepy forest&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmmm boy, that&#39;s a fine episode&quot; you reply, not really remembering it at all. in fact, you struggled to remember what the show was about, other than it being colourful and zany. It was far too juvenile for your tastes anyway.<br />
<br />
Tim giggled at your response and asked &quot;What&#39;s up with your voice?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My voice?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s all deep and junk. You sounded just like dad&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, uhm...&quot; You hadn&#39;t even noticed your voice was no longer the cracking whine of adolescence but had considerably deepened to a manlier voice. &quot;I guess I must have caught a cold...&quot; you mutter, then pretend to sneeze into your hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eww gross, I don&#39;t want your germs!&quot; Tim replies, covering his mouth and waving you away, all while still transfixed to the screen.<br />
<br />
The three of you leave and George leads you up the stairs, into his bedroom. It was as cluttered as his living room, maybe worse given the small space. He and Colby sit on his unmade bed while you head to his wardrobe and sift through his clothes for anything that could fit. George coughs to get your attention and asks &quot;What do you think you&#39;re doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
You get defensive and respond &quot;What? I can&#39;t head back home like this. My shirt already feels ready to burst&quot;.<br />
<br />
He sighs and says &quot;Well you could at least ask before you rummage through my wardrobe...&quot;<br />
<br />
You roll your eyes and say &quot;I&#39;ll keep that in mind the next time I begin unwillingly aging. Now look away while I change&quot;. He returns the eye roll as you grab a shirt and pair of shorts at random but averts his gaze along with Colby. After a bit of effort, you manage to pull your tight jeans off of your thicker legs and slip into the shorts. They were still a bit clingy around your thighs but they would have to do for now. It was harder to get your shirt off as the sleeves clung to your more muscular upper arms and struggled to get your head through the smaller collar. You could already tell you&#39;d grown a bit thicker around the chest since looking at your reflection in the bathroom while your waist looked even slimmer. It also looked like your body hair had further increased its spread across your pecs, coming in a darker colour than your usual sandy blonde. <br />
<br />
You spot a small mirror on the inside of the wardrobe. You take a glance at your reflection to see your face had gotten more solidly shaped, less curved and more angled. Sparse pinpricks of stubble scattered across your cheeks, increasing in density as they got closer to your chin. You were looking less like you were in high school and more like a college student. You rub your jaw, the sandpaper-like hairs feeling both foreign and familiar to you. You lower the hand to a pec and give it a slight squeeze, feeling the tightness and thickness of the muscle. A small grin escaped your lips. You hated to admit it but you were beginning to feel more at home in your body than before these weird changes started. You knew it was the socks&#39; dealings but you felt better now than you had all day. You finally pull the new shirt down over your torso. It was still a bit tight around the chest, but it made up for that in it&#39;s longer length that comfortably fell past the waistband of your shorts.<br />
<br />
Pleased to be in more relaxed fitting clothes, you grab a swivel chair tucked under George&#39;s desk and drag it to where your friends sat on the bed and sit on it backwards, your legs straddling the base and your arms slouched across the back. &quot;So do you have any ideas how I can get out of here to get the socks?&quot;<br />
<br />
George said &quot;We could just cover for you and say you were in the bathroom but they&#39;d probably get suspicious if you weren&#39;t out of there after 10 or 15 minutes&quot;<br />
<br />
Colby shrugs his shoulders and says &quot;We could always stuff some things under the bedsheets and pretend you were taking a nap. It works on TV&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, until they inevitably get caught and questioned.&quot; George replied, followed by a sigh. &quot;But I can&#39;t think of anything else. It&#39;s better than nothing...&quot;<br />
<br />
The boys each grabbed a pillow to begin the shaping but you stop them. &quot;Wait a minute, what if I told your parents that we were all going to play a new video game I bought but had forgotten to bring. My house isn&#39;t too far of a walk from here after all&quot;<br />
<br />
George rubs his chin in thought. &quot;Hmm, well my parents might not let you go alone, even if it is only 15 minutes away. But it&#39;s worth a try I guess, they might even drive you there. But you might want to do something about that extra growth on your face or they&#39;ll get suspicious. Especially my dad seeing as he&#39;s basically the king of facial hair&quot;.<br />
<br />
You rub the itchy stubble coating your jaw. You knew it had to be done but it just felt wrong to you, to vandalize your face in such a way. Deep down, you wanted it to grow even more but you already looked like you could order alcohol freely instead of the fresh-faced adolescent you were meant to be. You justify that you didn&#39;t have to shave it all off, George&#39;s dad did point out his chin scruff after all. &quot;OK... If you even have a razor in this household of course&quot;.</p>
