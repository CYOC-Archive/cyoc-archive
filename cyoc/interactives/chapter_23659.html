<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>Marie felt like she had a stroke of genius. Maybe if she changed herself into a dog, she'd have enough of an appetite! Impulsively, she jumped off her chair and ran to the box of vials. She opened it up, and found that there were many different kinds of dogs to pick from, though her young mind was having trouble reading all the words. She spoke them out loud to help herself out.
<P>"D-O-B...Doberman? C-O...I? No, C-O-L-L..." Becoming frustrated, she simply grabbed one and gulped it down, suddenly realizing that she probably shouldn't be a complete dog. She immediately stopped drinking, though there was very little mixture left in the vial. "Aw, well," she shrugged, putting it back into the box.
<P>She walked back to the table, feeling fur beginning to grow on her arms and legs. She stumbled, falling to the floor as her feet and legs reshaped themselves. Fortunately the carpet and her growing fur cushioned her fall. She noticed her fur was growing quite fluffy, and shiny. It was a dark brown...nearly black. She couldn't even see her skin anymore under the inches of silky fur. Her hair grew down in front of her eyes while blond fur sprouted from her cheeks.
<P>Underneath her towel, she felt something grow from her backside. She knew it must be her tail, and threw off the towel to see. It was short, with black fur on top and some blond on the bottom side. Now that she could see her chest, she found that blond hair was growing there. Marie was now completely covered in fur.
<P>The shiny black fur on her arms and legs was a bit shorter than the fur on the rest of her body, though still thick. Her legs had shifted into the hind legs of a dog, complete with small paws. She brushed more hair out of her face, finding that her original head of hair now blended into her fur and covered her entire forehead. The hair on her cheeks, neck and chest was bright blond and grew to nearly nine inches long. The black hair on her back was just as long.
<P>She felt her ears moving through the hair, rising to the top of her head. Feeling them with her almost-human hands, she noticed they had short fur covering them and ended in points, which flopped down a bit.
<P>Marie giggled as she put a hand to her round, black nose and felt how wet it was. The nerves inside were sending her many new smells. Her face ached as it pushed outward from the nose down. Her upper lip grew out to form the trademark dog mouth. Her teeth sharpened into points, and Marie ran her lengthening tongue across them eagerly. She knew exactly how to put these to work.
<P>Smiling, with her tongue hanging out of her mouth, she stood up on her hind paws. She was still able to walk like a human despite the many changes to her body. She didn't bother putting the towel back on now that she was covered in her shiny coat of hair.
<P>Before she made it back to the chair, however, her hands still felt funny. She looked at them, realizing that they had barely changed at all. Now it was a different story, as her fingernails grew into claws and her fingers retracted. Her thumbs shrank and moved up to her wrists, barely longer than an inch. Thick, dark pads formed on her palms as her fingers finished becoming stubby. She now had large dog paws, completely lacking any human characteristics.
<P>"Grrrrreat," she whined. "Noooowwww hooowwww dooorr I eat?" She was surprised how dog-like her voice sounded. She tried a few barks and yips to test out her voice, and was amazed to hear such authentic dog sounds.
<P>Her easily distracted mind snapped back to the matter at hand. She got back up on the chair and looked at the microwaved dinner. Drool began to drip from her tongue, and she used her forepaws to pull the plate to the edge of the table. She bowed her head and started eating right from the plate. It didn't taste too bad for leftovers, and Marie figured her taste buds had changed a bit. Still, she didn't stop eating until the entire plate was literally licked clean. She lapped up a bit of the soda as well, but the fizz seemed to be too much for her new canine tastes.
<P>She would have put the dishes in the sink, but she didn't want to risk breaking them. Instead she trotted back over to the vials, planning to change herself back to a human.
<P>Fear struck as she attempted to pick up the vial and realized she still didn't have any thumbs! She tried using both paws to grab it, but all the vials were packed too close together. She needed fingers, and right now there were none to be found.
<P>Whining a dog-like whine, Marie slumped onto the couch. She started looking over her body and began to think it wasn't so bad being a dog. There wasn't much responsibility, and her "mother" would have an easier time raising her this way. She decided to wait and see what her mom thought when she got home.</p>
