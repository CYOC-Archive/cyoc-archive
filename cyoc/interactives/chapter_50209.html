<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;This is a disaster.&quot; Pearl said to herself upon seeing the new and improved Roger and <br />
Lawrence like a knee-jerk reaction the words flying from her mouth as the image of the <br />
upgraded Lawrence made contact with her brain. <br />
<br />
 &quot;You think?&quot; June replied sounding ever so slightly sarcastic. <br />
<br />
Pearl didn't pick up on June's sarcasm, &quot;When Zackery and Nick were the only big game in <br />
town besides the Master we could count on the others eventually accepting him back due <br />
if nothing else because he was needed.... now Zackery and his infinite stamina aren't as <br />
unique now... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I get it.&quot; June replied in a hush voice. June and Pearl had discussed June's plan with a <br />
little bit more depth with Zackery, and he figured that they could likely rewrite existence <br />
so Lawrence had been Laura since becoming part of the pack with minimal scarring on <br />
reality. Pearl and June had returned to the female's den to wait for a decent chance in the <br />
corner of the room. <br />
<br />
 But now that June and Pearl had seen Margot gleefully bringing in the new larger, more <br />
muscular, more wolfhood, pastel green and white wolves, and had heard Ashley and <br />
others chat about how dutiful Lawrence was in bed, this threw everything into chaos. <br />
<br />
Keeping their voices low, June said, &quot;Maybe we should just go along with our plan <br />
anywho...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No way.&quot; Pearl said, &quot;When we were all brought into the pack, none of us had sired <br />
children, so our existences being removed didn't cause any trouble, but Margot now made <br />
love with Lawrence last night... who knows what damage we'll do to reality if we try to <br />
revise him now? In particular after Margot used a turn to make him and Roger into muscle <br />
wolves that can equal Zackery?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you 'know' so much about this sort of thing anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
Pearl blushed, &quot;I had a boyfriend once, real Star Trek geek, he loved deconstructing the <br />
laws of cause and effect the show used in the time travel episodes... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was just science fiction.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So was men landing on he moon once upon a time...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... okay, we can do this... let's talk somewhere private.&quot; <br />
<br />
Thankfully nobody paid different she wolves comings and goings that much with the <br />
exception of Megan with June... but she was very very much more so distracted by the <br />
changes to her brother. <br />
<br />
While Lawrence drank in the looks of all the she wolves (and doing the smart thing by not <br />
speaking and thus not ruining the moment), Megan ever so slightly unsure approached <br />
Roger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bro...  is that you?&quot; Megan asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;You bet it's me!&quot; Roger said gleefully, &quot;How do I look? Oh I know how I look! Bigger <br />
everywhere! Stronger everywhere! No one's going to mistake me for a she wolf now, and <br />
let Zackery try to say anything negative about me now!&quot; <br />
<br />
Megan nodded, &quot;Yes... Zackery not having any justification for putting you down anymore <br />
is a very very good thing, maybe that'll... that'll teach him to not be so sure himself like he <br />
was still in high school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay Meg'?&quot; Roger asked concerned while all the other she wolves flocked around <br />
their new white wolf titan. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's just...&quot; Megan didn't know how to begin, &quot;Is this really you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nicole meanwhile was trying very hard not to giggle (and only slightly failing), Lawrence <br />
and Roger were gonna shut up Zackery for good now! It was almost too bad, she had been <br />
looking foreword to kicking that aloof wolf down a peg again.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's kinda  a redundant question sis'.&quot; Roger said, &quot;I mean, are Maxine and Robyn really <br />
themselves? We've all been upgraded into Big Bad Wolves and part of the pack, we're taller, <br />
stronger, and faster than any human athlete. I simply now look the part.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, I know, I get that, but....&quot; Megan sighed, &quot;I think I was getting to kinda like how the <br />
two of us were now peas in a pod.... our ages were so close together that everyone kept <br />
mistaking us for twins even before day before yesterday.... but I can't help but feel that <br />
you're now sort of ... generic.&quot; <br />
<br />
Roger hugged his sister, &quot;Sis', I promise, this is all for the good of the pack, this is what I <br />
stayed a male for, it's still me, Roger, your brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan only slightly hesitantly hugged back, &quot;I know you are, I know it is, but... I think I <br />
liked being able to hug you all the way around, ya know? It was kinda fun being similar <br />
and everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a sacrifice we have to make for the good of the pack, you're for Master, and I'm for <br />
everyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah bro', I know.&quot; Megan leaned against her brother's furry chest.  'This isn't a stranger <br />
I'm hugging, it's Roger, it's not a stranger I'm hugging, it's Roger.' She said as a mantra in <br />
her mind. <br />
<br />
Zackery had to admit, having morning love making with Grace, Hope, and Isabelle had <br />
certainly been weird, in particular since as Zylphia she had never even remotely considered <br />
herself a slut and loathed people who had sex with less than a hello. But it had also been <br />
very very fun.  <br />
<br />
Zackery meanwhile his way to 'pass' by the female's den since he didn't want to go through <br />
the trouble of confronting Nicole and anyone else who agreed with her over entering for <br />
Pearl and June... then he saw the new versions of Lawrence and Roger. &quot;Oh shet.&quot; Zackery <br />
said in a simple voice, turned around on one foot, and went back he way he came. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Mistress Alice.&quot; <br />
<br />
The glass she wolf turned to see Martha with Kevin. &quot;Yes Martha?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's time.&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;So what's our new scheme?&quot; Pearl asked sounding tired behind the bathroom curtain, in <br />
low voices, glade that 'lip reading' would have been impossible even if the curtain didn't <br />
obscure their images thanks to now having muzzles rather than lips. <br />
<br />
June said, &quot;If we Transform Laura right off, it'll cause confusion and alarm, and if we alter <br />
reality, you'll throw a panic attack thinking it'll cause a rift in reality due to too many <br />
paradoxes. And we can't have Lawrence say he wanted to be female all along now that he's <br />
been updated into an imposture of Zackery and has no insecurities. ... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Again, what's your new scheme for us to help Zackery?&quot;  It was stunning to Pearl, the <br />
Dare had simply said for June to not think any negative thoughts of Zackery, but she was <br />
now willing to risk subterfuge for his sake.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's rather complex, that's why I want us to run it by Zackery first... we Transform or Dare <br />
Margot...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What good would that do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We convince her before we invoke the game to chose Dare to get her her turn back to let <br />
it harmlessly be given to her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah...&quot; Pearl said, the fact Pearl had used her turn was still an unknown among the pack, <br />
unless she could get her hands on a way to given a new turn, she could be found out, <br />
which would be the final disaster. <br />
<br />
&quot;We will Dare her to use Transform on Lawrence, if Lawrence choses transform, she'll <br />
include that Laura thought the pack didn't need four uper males underneath Master. If <br />
Dare, then he and Margot will do a minor display in front of the other she-wolves doing <br />
their best to ad lip so not to appear scripted about Lawrence's sacrifice for the pack. If he <br />
somehow ends up with both, he'll plant some discussing about being surplus before being <br />
transformed in a way that creates the illusion that Margot is Transform or Daring him then <br />
and there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pearl sighed, &quot;So all the pressure of using a turn without Master's permission is on Margot <br />
and no us...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But Margot used her turn on Roger and Lawrence remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not if Lawrence 'gave it back' so she could change him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah.....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't sound so excited about this. This is what you want, what I want, what WE want! <br />
To put the pack into a position where they -have- to accept Zackery back into their arms.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know but.... we're playing a dangerous game... so much could go wrong..and it could all <br />
lead right back to Zackery... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry Pearl...&quot; June put a burned hand on her shoulder, &quot;I plan to talk it over with <br />
Zackery before I put it into motion. He can help me figure out any bugs I might have <br />
missed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what'll be the female details of the TF anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Chest larger than the twins as it can get without being ugly, and some long flowing white <br />
hair, and some oriental red markings on her fur just for the fun of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No changes in how she thinks about Zackery?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Neither her nor Margot, the Dare will include she'll think was Laura's idea after the Dare is <br />
done and that it was a perfectly good idea, and double for Laura thinking it was her own <br />
idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't want them suddenly changing their opinions about Zack and raising Nicole's <br />
paranoia.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well.. have fun talking about it with Zackery...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We are you going to be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Getting drunk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just remember you STILL need to get your turn back before you're found out...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...I know...&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
Kevin sat in Martha's lap reading Alice in Wonderland still, while Alice, Bart, Jensen, and <br />
the twins  gathered around. Kaylee was leaning over the tap over so slightly with her the <br />
three clink she-wolves acting as a singular chair for her again not making a peep of <br />
complaint having enjoyed themselves that morning quite much with Zackery at a joint <br />
request of Jensen, the clink wolves having their first foursome with Zackery (whose <br />
wolfhood was healing fantastically fast). <br />
<br />
Bart and Alice sat ON the table, looking at the map the twins had drawn up in as much <br />
detail as they could manage. <br />
<br />
&quot;So Alice, do you have everything memorized?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do not have everything memorized, but I do have my instructions for the mission to the <br />
police station and this map committed to my memory. I do think would need a brain the <br />
size of a planet to memorize everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
The wolves looked at each other then nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right... you'll have to leave the map behind one you enter the real world. There are <br />
mirrors in these rooms here, and in pretty much all the hallways.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand.&quot; Alice said. &quot;I'll check to see if there's anything reflective enough to enter <br />
the filing room and a computer terminal directly. If I'm spotted I'm not to mention the <br />
pack or any details about myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darla said, &quot;Alice, if you chose something that's not a typical mirror, MAKE SURE it's not <br />
something that'll fade away when the sun comes off it or can be easy disrupted, do NOT <br />
leave yourself without an escape rout. They can't hurt you, but they that doesn't mean they <br />
can't tie you up or something worse, understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mother I do understand.&quot; <br />
<br />
 &quot;Remember Alice,&quot; Darla implored, &quot;Get in, find out what we need to know, then get out. <br />
Do not be seen. Do not be heard. The security cameras and these red dots. Do NOT be <br />
seen by them! Least of all entering and exiting a mirror. These sketched in spots are the <br />
cameras blind spots. We're lucky they're focused on the doors so they won't be looking at <br />
the mirrors...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If a police man stops me, should I bring him into the mirror world?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... only if positively absolutely necessary.&quot; Jensen said, &quot;More vanishing would just bring <br />
people's attention more, there would be nothing to connect us, but it would be best to <br />
leave without any traces, THAT MEANS VERY MUCH IN PARTICULAR ALICE: Leave no traces <br />
WHAT SO EVER of what you looked at, you don't have finger prints being glass but they <br />
can't see what you looked at or find the folders in question of place... understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice inched away from Jesen somewhat frightened in spite of being 'indestructible.'  &quot;Yes <br />
Master.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darla hugged Alice from behind. &quot;It's okay dear, just be a brave girl and stay focused on <br />
the mission.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mother.&quot; Alice nodded. She looked at Jensen, &quot;So only bring someone into the mirror <br />
with me if letting them stay would compromise things, I understand.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Remember mother loves you, and she's waiting for you to come home.&quot; Darla reminded <br />
her one last time.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can do it Alice!&quot; Kevin declared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be careful Mistress Alice.&quot; Martha's right head said the other looking at Kevin. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just be careful, sister.&quot; Bart said. <br />
<br />
Alice nodded, &quot;I will.&quot; Alice stepped into the office's full length mirror, looking like the <br />
ghost of a blond wolf in a Victorian era dress on the other side rather than unbreakable <br />
glass in the real world. &quot;I'll be back.&quot; Alice curtsied and walked out of frame, taking three <br />
steps as she went, &quot;One, two, three....&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that, Alice was at the police station in the world within mirrors. Alice stayed out <br />
of the view of the mirrors, but did look at the reflections of the police and criminals as <br />
they passed in and out of frame, looking as ghosts to her in the mirrorverse. <br />
<br />
Alice regarded her map carefully to be on the safe side, to the video cameras she'd appear <br />
at best as something that would appear on a 'haunted houses' series, but she remembered <br />
her father and mother's instructions about not being seen.<br />
<br />
Now Alice just had to hope that nothing went TOO wrong.</p>
