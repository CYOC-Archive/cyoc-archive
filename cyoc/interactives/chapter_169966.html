<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Here we are,” Toby said. She slowly knelt down to allow Jordan to climb off her shoulders. Once his feet touched the ground, Jordan was able to get a better look at Toby and was simply amazed by how statuesque she had become. Which is no less impressive than when he grew Hugo earlier despite the height difference between the two; rather, anyone larger than him was an awesome sight to behold. There was also Toby’s proportionately enormous rack as an added bonus.<br />
<br />
Toby made her way to the front door, leaned over and pressed the doorbell button with a large finger. After the chime rang out, a voice called out, “Coming!” Moments later, the door opened and Jordan saw an older woman in the frame. She stood close to his own height, and bore a striking resemblance to Toby, save for some wrinkles, gray streaks in her hair, and an average-sized bust. “Yes, how can I…? Toby?” The woman wore a light pink blouse and tight-fitting jeans.<br />
<br />
“Hey, mom,” said the mini-giantess, who now appeared more awkward about her situation than before. “It finally happened. I grew!”<br />
<br />
“Oh my, how you have,” replied Toby’s mother, who began to eye her newly grown daughter. Then her eyes fell upon Jordan, and she said, “And who might you be?”<br />
<br />
Jordan responded with, “I’m Jordan. I go to college with Toby.” Taking in her appearance, he quickly added, “And I see where Toby got her large breasts from.” Within seconds, Toby’s mother’s chest inflated, standing out further and straining the buttons of her blouse. Jordan watched closely as the top-most buttons popped off one after another and a deep line of cleavage slowly revealed itself until her bra could be seen.<br />
<br />
“Oh, stop,” she said as her face turned a shade of red. “Well I’m Lucille,” said the woman. “Come inside. I was just fixing supper.”<br />
<br />
While Jordan casually walked in, Toby needed to squeeze herself through the doorway. Once inside, Lucille motioned to the living room furniture and said, “Please, have a seat.” Toby carefully lowered herself down into the two-person couch, which was just wide enough for her hips. The wood foundations of the furniture creaked before she eventually relaxed. Jordan remained standing and called out, “It smells nice. What are you cooking?”<br />
<br />
“It’s beef stew,” Lucille replied from the kitchen. “Old family recipe.”<br />
<br />
Jordan walked about the living room, taking in the scene until he came upon the shelf of family photos. One featured Lucille and Toby’s father, who appeared to be a tall, portly man with short, dark brown hair and a bushy mustache. He wore a short-sleeved, button-down flower shirt and khaki shorts. The next photo features the whole family, including a pre-giantess Toby. Standing on either side were the twins, Tess and Nina. While they did share much physically, each twin had her own sense of fashion. Nina, who wore her dark blonde hair in a short, bushy bob, had eyeglasses and dressed as a tomboy of sorts. Tess, on the other hand, kept her lighter blonde hair long and flowing, and she did not need to wear glasses. She also dressed to insinuate her womanly figure, with a low-cut top and tight pants.<br />
<br />
“You have a nice looking family here, Lucille,” Jordan said aloud. “Your wife looks especially beautiful.” He watched as the former husband of Lucille slowly morphed into that of a gorgeous woman around the same age. The mustache faded away and her hair cascaded down, framing her rounder face until they reached her shoulders. Her attire also adjusted to fit her womanly figure, with the top three buttons unfastening to reveal modest cleavage.<br />
<br />
“Alex is a delight. I can’t wait for you to meet her when she comes home from work,” said Lucille.<br />
<br />
Jordan decided to join Lucille in the kitchen. While her back was facing him, he saw that she wore an apron as she worked. “So tell more about growing up on a dairy farm,” he said.<br />
<br />
“Oh, there isn’t much to tell,” said Lucille. “My Pa and uncle did most of the work, leaving Ma and I to tend to other duties.”<br />
<br />
“I bet you had more to offer with you and your mother being part bovine,” Jordan said. He watched as a nub poked out from the top of Lucille’s pants until it morph into the tip of a tail. It slowly extended out and hung from where her tailbone was located. Lucille’s hips widened and thighs thickened slightly, stretching her jeans which caused an audible creak. Her hair began to grow longer and thicker, falling down past the middle of her back. Jordan began to notice two protrusions appearing from the sides of Lucille’s head. He recognized them as horns which slowly curved forward and up before stopping.<br />
<br />
Lucille turned to face Jordan, her face had become flushed. “Well, most women in the family did provide the dairy for the town.” She started to fan herself and said, “You’ll have to excuse me. I seem to be having hot flashes.” That wasn’t all, thought Jordan as he watched Lucille’s front expand further. Two more buttons gave way as the newly transformed cow woman’s breasts grew to greater sizes.<br />
<br />
“Ever since I became a mother, these big gals have not let up on the milk production,” explained Lucille. Sure enough, two dark stains appeared as milk began the leak through. “Would you be a dear and get the pump from underneath the sink for me.” She proceeded to sit down at the kitchen table as Jordan did as she requested. After retrieving the apparatus, which looked to be a two-foot long cylindrical container with suction cups attached to hoses, Jordan handed it to Lucille, and said, “It’s okay for you to be topless all the time.” As she began to unfasten the remaining buttons, Lucille said, “Frankly, I don’t know why I bother most of the time as it is.” Once she discarded her blouse, next came her overtaxed bra. “Especially since I’m a licensed dairy producer.”<br />
<br />
The moment Lucille unhooked her bra and released her breasts, Jordan stared in awe. Proportionate to her body, they were at least twice the size of her head, and appeared heavy with milk. Her nipples were also an inch long and the width of pencils with saucer plate-size areolas. Jordan regained his composure and quickly said, “Excuse me for staring. It’s not often I see such wonderful breasts such as yours.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, no need to fret, Jordan,” replied Lucille. She placed two suction cups from the pump on her teats and turned the machine on, which hummed quietly. “Most ordinary women would be uncomfortable with anyone ogling their goods, but it feels natural for me.”<br />
<br />
Before Jordan could do anything else, he heard the sound of the front door opening. Then a voice called out: “Baaabe, I’m home--! Oh god, is that you Toby?” Jordan left the kitchen and found in the living space the wife of Lucille, Alex. She was dressed in her business attire, which consisted of a light blue suit jacket and slacks, white button-down shirt and dark green neck tie. Setting down her briefcase, she looked up at Toby in awe. Her eyes then fell upon Jordan, who quickly spoke first, “Hey there. I’m Jordan, a friend of Toby’s.”<br />
<br />
“Hello to you,” said Alex before looking back at Toby. “And I still cannot believe what I’m seeing here.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I know,” said a surprisingly timid Toby. “But look on the bright side. This outfit grew with me.”<br />
<br />
“Well, so long as you’re happy, I don’t think I have much say in the matter.” Alex relaxed and took in a deep breath, inhaling the aroma of her wife’s cooking. “Since you’re here, you might as well stay for supper.”<br />
<br />
“We’d be happy to,” said Jordan. “But first, where’s your bathroom?”<br />
<br />
“Down the hall and to the left.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks. I’ll be right back.” Jordan exited the living room and made his way to the bathroom. Closing the door behind him, he stared at his reflection in the mirror, deep in thought on what to do next.</p>
