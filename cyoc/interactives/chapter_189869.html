<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">...your chest.<br />
<br />
Feeling your chest itch was not the worst that could have happened from your ill thought out wish, so you counted your blessings that so far the only consequences of your stupidity was itchiness.<br />
<br />
Ignoring it, you quickly focus back on the video, rewinding a bit as you missed around half a minute from being distracted.<br />
<br />
The need to scratch your chest was soon becoming overwhelming however, growing stronger as you ignored it. It took no time at all until you were unconsciously rubbing the area around your nipples through your baggy t-shirt to relieve the itchiness with both hands.<br />
<br />
Initially you didn’t notice, your hands just doing their own thing while you watched the video. The first clue you got that the wish hadn’t just caused itchiness was something intruding on the edge of your vision from below. Your hands had been concealing it until this point with their movements, but as you looked down you were baffled as your eyes met your chest way sooner than expected.<br />
<br />
Clearly visible through your grey t-shirt were bumps on your chest, bulging it forward a few inches, breasts. They could be nothing else.<br />
<br />
You wouldn’t exactly call yourself fat, but you never were the sporty type, so you had some experience with flabby pecs. You knew what you were talking about. As the first conscious action you took with your hands was feel how squishy these things were you could confirm that they were exactly what you took them for.<br />
<br />
Mesmerized, you continued slowly scratching and massaging your still itching new breasts, eyes glued to your hands as you fondled yourself.<br />
<br />
Not noticing until your chest was heaving from breathing too hard, you could finally focus on the sensation touching them caused. Your face must have been incredibly flushed. You felt so hot that you were panting, gulping as much air into yourself as you could to try and stench the heat radiating from your bosom.<br />
<br />
You couldn’t stop touching them, squeezing them, playing with them. It felt incredibly good, relieving that itchiness ever so slightly. Before your eyes you saw them slowly growing, stretching your baggy shirt slightly more with each second.<br />
<br />
Curiously, you weren’t hard. You never felt something like this before, this primal arousal that touching your chest caused, but your penis adamantly refused to strain against your sweatpants.<br />
<br />
Your new breasts took up the slack though, now growing a bit faster as you continued to satisfy your urge to fondle them. Your pc now completely forgotten, your entire attention consumed by your new flesh as you sat there for a few minutes, entranced. All the while your chest continued to grow and grow and grow!<br />
<br />
Your baggy t-shirt was soon riding up your stomach, your breasts lifting the fabric up and being held up by it in turn forming two round bulges squeezing against one another.<br />
<br />
Your breasts weren’t the only thing that grew, your nipples grew with them. They became your focus after a bit, the itchy sensation concentrating there. As you felt them and stopped massaging your chest so much you were surprised how solid they were, visibly standing apart from the bulges your breasts caused in your t-shirt.<br />
<br />
Pinching one and then immediately the other caused a short gasp to interrupt your panting as that was the final thing needed to finally wake your penis from its slumber, disregarding the fact it felt as if you could&#39;ve orgasmed half a dozen times already from simply squishing your chest.<br />
<br />
Continuing to tweak your nipples as they filled out your hands more and more each second, growing more massive to match their new homes, you felt your dick getting erect agonizingly slowly.<br />
<br />
Your sweatpants had shifted down a fair bit from your wriggling as you played with yourself and not soon after your throbbing penis emerged from your waistband, not that you could see it.<br />
<br />
Your breasts took up the entirety of your lower vision now and you couldn’t see past them even if you tried to press them to the side. There was simply too much flesh. The only thing that kept them from spilling out across your desk was your shirt, holding up admirably, though your neckline was beginning to stretch away from your throat, getting pulled in the direction of your nipples.<br />
<br />
Your nipples calmed down after a while too, just like your breasts, the itching feeling becoming more background noise and seeking a new target, though they were still growing slightly. You hands were now entirely filled with them. They were surprisingly heavy to hold, even with your breast attached, and squeezing them caused some flesh to spill between your fingers like a stress ball.<br />
<br />
Now sweat was pouring in rivers down your neck as you grew desperate to just cum already, your ministrations having carried you over the edge dozens of times yet still no sign of release in sight. That would soon change however as the itchiness you could now definitely identify as the wish at work found its next target.<br />
<br />
Your dick.<br />
<br />
It was still twitching in sync with your heartbeat, so hard that it smacked lightly into your stomach each time it throbbed as the itch arrived. It felt nearly painful, your muscles clenching with each beat that filled your penis with blood, but you couldn’t scratch it, your hands stuck to your nipples as they demanded to be touched.<br />
<br />
This dilemma was soon solved through unorthodox means however. The itch caused your dick to grow, each twitch adding another inch, and as it grew, it scraped against your stomach. Bending forward as far as your now enormous breasts allowed, you tried to press more of yourself against your own dick, spreading pre against your belly.<br />
<br />
And yet your breasts and nipples were still growing with it, it was maddening. Too many sensations to try and get control of yourself. Pressing your arms into your breasts to reach your nipples caused your dick to throb, which lead to you bending further forward, which pressed the nipple-flesh spilling from in-between your still squeezing hands into your desk, which caused your arms to hug your breasts even tighter.<br />
<br />
This circle of pleasure continued for minutes more, slowly intensifying with each flare of your pulsing shaft as it expanded.<br />
<br />
In such a state the absence of sensation was much more jarring than the presence of it, and so when your breasts finally stopped their mad itching you noticed immediately. They were now so large that they simply rested on your desk, your formerly baggy t-shirt now nothing more than a glorified bra as it held you breasts contained. All the while your growing dick chased your receding shirt up your stomach, so far that it now rested with its pre spewing head directly underneath your breasts, just an inch away from slipping between them.<br />
<br />
Something you hadn’t noticed before was how your balls were also growing with your penis, forcing your legs apart now with their mass. They were still not so big for you to think they were massive but they had swollen significantly. Forcing your legs closer together you also instantly noticed something else. It felt good to put pressure on them. As a man, or whatever you are now, you were intimately familiar that what you were doing right now, squeezing you legs together with your balls in the middle of them, should’ve been extremely painful and have you retching.<br />
<br />
Yet the only thing that happened as you clenched your legs, was that you felt a glob of pre-cum shoot out of your dick onto your boob flesh from underneath. In fact, squeezing your balls felt just like your breasts, now that you thought about it, no hard organs in the middle to damage, just more flesh to stimulate, filled with cum to squeeze out.<br />
<br />
Continuing to gently press your legs into the side of your big ball-sack, it sped up the growth of your penis immensely and as your tip reached your breasts and slipped between the folds of flesh, you knew this was exactly as what you wanted. This was the most sexually pleasing thing you ever felt. Your own body was too big for yourself, too stimulating. Each second felt like an orgasm that just continued to build instead of end. Each heaving breath in, was like climbing a mountain, and each breath out was quick and sharp, as you realized there was an even taller mountain to reach.<br />
<br />
Your nipples stopped their growth sometime around when your dick reached the middle of your chest, encased from all sides and put under pressure. A steady flow of pre from squeezing your balls lubricated its way up. Your hands were now simply there for touching your gigantic nipples, too small to get your grip around them entirely and content to simply massage them along with your breasts.<br />
<br />
While your cock slowly inched its way up towards your neckline your balls also stopped swelling ever larger. They were so big now that they were spilling over your lap, pressing your pants lower and were nearly touching your chair on the other side of your legs.<br />
<br />
Before you even saw you own penis breach your neckline, a small fountain of cum burst from the cleft of your breasts like from the blowhole of a whale, forming a small puddle and trickling down into your t-shirt once it overflowed out of the small crevice your breasts had formed.<br />
<br />
Waiting a few seconds while holding your breath was agony. You were simply so desperate to cum for real, to finally achieve that immense relief promised to you by the ad that you were trembling even harder now.<br />
<br />
The sight of your cock-tip was like the rising of the sun after a long and stormy night, simply mesmerizing. Now that you could finally see it, you were quite shocked that it didn’t seem to have grown any thicker. It had to have only grown longer and longer, supported by your breasts on its final journey to your face to keep it in place for you.<br />
<br />
All the better, your mouth was the perfect size.<br />
<br />
You let a few seconds pass simply admiring it, and as it grew just that last bit longer, you leaned your head down and enveloped it with your lips.<br />
<br />
Your tongue’s movements were ravenous, slathering the pre-stained tip with your saliva. You pressed your teeth into it as hard as you were able, to scrape against it in any way you could, the itch of the wish still omnipresent in your mind now that you could finally scratch it. Moving your head up and down your shaft wasn’t even necessary to pleasure yourself.<br />
<br />
You did it anyway.<br />
<br />
All too soon it was dawning on you that your orgasm was coming, all the foreplay with your breasts, your nipples and even your balls, an appetizer to the main course. Now that you had your dick in your mouth it was only a matter of time.<br />
<br />
Your throat was working constantly, swallowing each bead of pre as soon as it shot forth from your meat, you even started moving your arms up and down slightly, letting the flesh of your breasts help at least a little bit.<br />
<br />
Funnily enough the first sign was the itch, it went away completely. From your breasts to your balls, the only thing you were feeling were no longer discomfort or the need to scratch  an itch that didn’t really exist. It let you experience the full force of the pleasure your new body could feel for the first time.<br />
<br />
You thought it couldn’t feel any better than before.<br />
<br />
You were wrong.<br />
<br />
All of a sudden your whole body cramped and shuddered. Your arms and hands disappeared into your breasts and nipples respectively as you pressed them as hard into yourself as you could. Your legs were forcing your balls together harder even than that. What would’ve brought only agony before now only served to please you more, pressing a gigantic load up into your cum-pipe and towards your eagerly awaiting face.<br />
<br />
Your eyes bulged as the first shot arrived, and you gagged as the second came.<br />
<br />
By the third you were nearly overwhelmed.<br />
<br />
Sometime after the fourth you had started swallowing.<br />
<br />
The next few minutes were simply an indistinct blur, moving from one orgasm to the next.<br />
<br />
It felt as if your body was accruing interest the whole time you were pleasuring yourself and was now paying it back.<br />
<br />
In your mind, the only thing that existed was your cock. The whole of your body sucked, squeezed, pressed and jerked in tandem to achieve ecstasy until nothing was left.<br />
<br />
While you were still cumming, but as it slowly wound down, you came to your senses slowly. Your penis was no longer in your mouth and you had leaned back in your chair. It now simply spewed your throat with load after load of leftover cum that dribbled down your sides and stained your shirt a dark grey, more than it already was anyway.<br />
<br />
You felt bloated, having swallowed shot after shot of your cum, but you were also utterly satisfied. Your legs even felt a bit of air again, seems your balls have shrunk after all the cum they expelled. You had no idea how that worked.<br />
<br />
‘Fuck it, magic wish ad.’<br />
<br />
You dick finally trickled to a stop, having spent every last drop of your massive reserves, drooping down to rest on your shoulder. As your mind dialled back into the local reality, freeing itself from your own pleasure dimension, you registered your surroundings again. Your speakers were still on.<br />
<br />
“...and that’s all folks, see ya in the next video!”<br />
<br />
That caused a chuckle to rise from your lips.<br />
<br />
It was a surprisingly girly sounding one.</p>
