<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A look at the contacts on Jeff&#39;s phone confirmed it.  Though his new female life was similar, having the same home and family, he had different friends than in his original male life.  He recognized the names of the girls now listed in his contacts; they were from his school.  But he didn&#39;t know much about them.  If he ever came across them while in this life, things could get awkward in a hurry.<br />
<br />
Jeff slapped his forehead in stupidity.  He had been so focused on becoming his own vagina, he hadn&#39;t thought how to handle this life in the meantime.  Granted, he only planned on staying like this for a day.  As soon as he&#39;s reunited with the conciousness in his vagina, he&#39;s planning to change back to male.  But it&#39;s not very likely that he&#39;d be able to avoid his new friends before that time.<br />
<br />
He went back towards the Chronivac on his PC.  There&#39;s gotta be some way to fix this situation.  He could change back to male.  His vagina self wouldn&#39;t like that, but would understand as soon as its conciousness is merged back with his own.  How do you undo a change manually, though?  Jeff looked through the transformation log.  There were two listed: the first being his transformation from male to female, and the second being the duplication of his conciousness into his vagina.<br />
<br />
Jeff opened the former.  To his surprise, not only could it be undone from here, but it could be modified.  In that case, what if there&#39;s something here that would allow him to still be female for his vagina?  Looking through the options, he came across the one that kept his awareness.  If he had turned it off, his memories would be altered to fit this female life, unaware that he had changed it.  He had previously left his awareness on so he could enjoy the transformation, and know to change back to male when he was done.  But now he has a second conciousness, located in his vagina.  That conciousness is the one enjoying the transformation.  He himself is only the host.  A host now living in a female body, but that&#39;s of little interest to him.  So it&#39;s not as important for him to remember his old life.<br />
<br />
Disabling his own awareness, an option popped up whether to retroactively disable the awareness of his vagina.  No, Jeff wanted his vagina to remember being male.  As soon as his conciousness is reunited with the one in his vagina, he&#39;d be able to remember being male, and know to change back to one.  And as far as he could tell, this was the best way to stay in this female life and allow the conciousness in his vagina to continue being a vagina.  With a deep breath, Jeff hit the &quot;Confirm&quot; button, and he felt a brief sense of dizziness.<br />
<br />
As the dizziness passed, Jess opened her eyes.  The fact she had eyes at all told her that she was currently not her own vagina.  Looking down between her legs, sure enough, there&#39;s her crotch.  She reached down and felt it.  And it felt... normal.  But she was certain that within her female sex, was a copy of her conciousness.  Which means, she herself had become the host.<br />
<br />
By all accounts, she should&#39;ve been disappointed.  She had wanted to become her own vagina, but from her perspective, he didn&#39;t get to.  And yet, she was okay with this.  Somehow, she found herself no longer interested in being a vagina.  It was as though all interest had been drained from her.  In fact, she found it strange that she wanted to be a vagina in the first place.  All the more strange that she now had someone living as HER vagina, especially a copy of herself!<br />
<br />
Well, despite how strange it was, the person in her vagina did want to be a vagina.  She wasn&#39;t sure if her vagina was enjoying herself, but either way, it was only temporary.  As soon as her conciousnesses are merged back together, she&#39;ll know whether this was an enjoyable experience or not.  For better or worse.<br />
<br />
For now, though, Jess returned to the Chronivac&#39;s settings.  If she ever wanted to do another transformation like this one, she wanted to know more about its failsafes.  If she had made herself unaware that her vagina was a person, what would happen if she then tried sending another copy of her conciousness to her unknowingly occupied vagina?<br />
<br />
Returning to the &quot;Other Person&#39;s Anatomy&quot; options, she once again tried setting herself to become her own vagina.  She no longer liked the idea of it, but as long as she didn&#39;t confirm it, there&#39;d be no issue.  As soon as she selected her vagina, though, another message popped up.  &quot;Failsafe: Currently selected anatomy is already occupied by another conciousness. Transformation into currently selected anatomy cannot be performed while occupied.&quot;<br />
<br />
Okay, good to know.  Not only does that confirm that a copy of her conciousness is housed inside her vagina, it also means she could&#39;ve set her host self to &quot;Unaware&quot; without worry.  Useful information should she ever choose to do something like this, again.  Although, what if she had been unaware, and tried to become part of someone else?  Upon choosing to become a vagina belonging to a random person, yet another message popped up.  &quot;Failsafe: Target is currently host to one or more other conciousnesses. To allow continued hosting and prevent possible harm to other conciousnesses, target&#39;s conciousness will be duplicated between current body and selected anatomy.&quot;<br />
<br />
So it would be just like Jess&#39;s current situation, except her copy would be in someone else&#39;s body instead of her own.  She assumes that if she wasn&#39;t currently playing host to herself, she&#39;d be wholly sent to another person&#39;s anatomy.<br />
<br />
Well, now that she understands the Chronivac&#39;s failsafes... now what?  For the next 24 hours, she is playing host to a sentient vagina.  In the meantime, she could play around with the Chronivac some more.  She may no longer be interested in being a vagina, but there&#39;s plenty of other options.<br />
<br />
Jess got up from her computer to stretch and think, walking around the room.  Nothing felt out of the ordinary.  But she imagined things felt pretty strange for her vagina.<br />
<br />
She pulled her panties off, and discarded them on the nearby pile of clothes.  She stood in front of her mirror.  There in her reflection was her vagina.  It was strange to think that a copy of her conciousness now resided in it.  But from an outward appearance, nothing was different.  In fact, it was now that she felt a little disappointment.  Her vagina was enjoying one heck of a transformation.  But for her, everything was normal.<br />
<br />
Well, that&#39;s easily fixed.  After putting back on her clothes and making a quick trip to the bathroom to pee, she returned to the Chronivac, and began looking through its options.</p>
