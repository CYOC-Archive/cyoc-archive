<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It must have been a few hours since I&#39;ve entered the library. I&#39;ve read a bunch of books of all sorts while keeping the protection of my socks so that I don&#39;t get any transformation out of these novels. After finishing another one, I stretch myself. This had been a hell of a sleeping session. I hear the door of the library crack open as someone enters the room. It&#39;s Abigail? She doesn&#39;t seem like the type to enter in a library.<br />
<br />
Abigail: Oh... you&#39;re there.<br />
<br />
Myself: Y-yeah... Since this morning in fact...<br />
<br />
I look at the pile of book next to me. I really read a lot didn&#39;t I?<br />
<br />
Myself: W-what brings you here?<br />
<br />
Abigail: Peace and quiet. The others won&#39;t stop questionning and touching. It&#39;s annoying! Samilla wants to &quot;pet the cat&quot;, Revand wants to get more info about the transformation process, and Trevor keeps blushing when he sees me! This is already difficult... If this is how random strangers think of me... What will my parents think?<br />
<br />
Myself: ...<br />
<br />
Abigail: S-sorry I... I don&#39;t know why I told you that...<br />
<br />
Myself: No it&#39;s okay... you can sit here if you want. It&#39;s really a quiet place.<br />
<br />
I pulled up my best smile. I can&#39;t help but wonder what I would do in her situation, probably that I would&#39;ve cried about it perpetually. She&#39;s really good to keep her cool after all this.<br />
<br />
Abigail: Thanks...<br />
<br />
She came to sit next to me.<br />
<br />
Abigail: What do we read?<br />
<br />
Myself: Hum... Right now I thought of starting this manga serie... Since I&#39;ve finished these novels...<br />
<br />
Abigail: Fine by me.<br />
<br />
We sat next to each other and started reading the manga serie. It seems like a fantasy type of story, and we read silently, Abigail peeking to my shoulder. Her tail sometimes touched me in its movement, but I tried not to place my attention on it, to let her have her moment of peace without questions. After a while though, I suddenly felt her head sitting on my shoulder, her breathing calm and steady. Did she just fall asleep? I did not expect that. I have to say, she&#39;s a lot less intimidating when she sleeps, almost cute! I feel like she&#39;s equal to me now, there is no act of superiority when she sleeps... I carefully placed my hand on her head and slowly pet her. This is a comforting motion for her, and a little for me as well. Wait, is she purring? I can feel a vibration from her as I pet her! At least she&#39;s well right now... I&#39;m kind of scared of all of this happening to me too... I mean, a transformation crushed the most resilient of us all... What if it happened to me? At least I can find some peace right now...<br />
<br />
Revand: Oh! There you are! Come you two! Theres something wrong with Hadley!<br />
<br />
As he entered the room, I pulled my hand off Abigail&#39;s head and my face turned red. He is already gone again, but that really surprised me.<br />
<br />
Myself: Hey Abigail... Wake up...<br />
<br />
Abigail: Huh? What? I&#39;m not asleep!<br />
<br />
Myself: Okay well... Revand just came and something is happening with Hadley!<br />
<br />
She jumped at the information and almost rushed out of the room. I quickly followed her at the best I could. Everybody were assembled around what I think is the bathroom door. Hadley is not with the group, but probably inside.<br />
<br />
Trevor: Hadley! Please respond to us! Is everything okay in there?<br />
<br />
Hadley: G-go away! I don&#39;t want you to enter! Everythings fine! I&#39;m fine!<br />
<br />
Her voice was shaky through the solid wood. She is not fine.<br />
<br />
Abigail: Hadley are you okay? I heard that something happened? It&#39;s important please open that door!<br />
<br />
Hadley: ...<br />
<br />
Abigail: Hadley! You gotta open!<br />
<br />
Hadley: Could you... tell the guys to go away? This is embarassing... and very intimate... and strange... and...<br />
<br />
Abigail: Trevor, Revand, and hum... Farim get out of here.<br />
<br />
They left in a hurry, not wanting to oppose to Abigail I guess. This left me, Abigail and Samilla, who is quieter than usual. Probably scared of what might have happened to the woman behind the door.<br />
<br />
Hadley: Are they gone?<br />
<br />
Abigail: Yeah... you can open now?<br />
<br />
Hadley: Okay... but don&#39;t judge okay? This is so... alien to me...<br />
<br />
I hear a click of the door, hinting at the unlocking. Abigail quickly open the door, only to find Hadley on the ground with... Eggs?<br />
<br />
Abigail: H-Hadley? W-what happened? What&#39;s going on?<br />
<br />
Hadley: They won&#39;t stop coming out! It&#39;s been like that since this morning!<br />
<br />
Samilla: What&#39;s coming out?<br />
<br />
Hadley: Eggs! I&#39;m laying eggs! They come at a continous pace! Each time one come out, another starts to build in! This is constantly uncomfortable... Like they&#39;re pushing out... Oh my... Here it come!<br />
<br />
As she said that, an egg rolled out from under her dress. Identical to all the others... It kind of looked like a chicken egg?<br />
<br />
Myself: Hey... Hadley? What kind of sandwich did you eat this breakfast?<br />
<br />
Hadley: I think it was... oh... Egg sandwiches...<br />
<br />
Myself: T-thats... What I thought...<br />
<br />
Abigail: Samilla, go ask the guys if they ate eggs sandwiches okay? Just to be sure...<br />
<br />
Samilla did not get asked twice as she walked outside.<br />
<br />
Hadley: I have to say *Huff*... I didn&#39;t expect all of that to happen *Puff*...<br />
<br />
Abigail: The moment I get out of here, I kill that motherfucking Tristan.<br />
<br />
Myself: Does is hurts?<br />
<br />
Hadley: Yeah... But I&#39;m used to it... Having three childrens and all... It&#39;s nothing compared to giving birth I&#39;m telling you.<br />
<br />
Abigail: Do you need help getting up?<br />
<br />
Hadley: No... no I&#39;m fine...<br />
<br />
She standed upwards, in a perfectly normal matter. She seemed abnormaly steady on her feet. I thought that it would make greater impact than this... And then another egg fell on the ground with a huge sound.<br />
<br />
Hadley: They... They really don&#39;t stop...<br />
<br />
Abigail: Damn... I don&#39;t really know what to do...<br />
<br />
Hadley: It&#39;s fine... we&#39;ll go tell the others that I... Well that this is happening to me... They&#39;ll understand... I think...<br />
<br />
And that&#39;s what we did. We went to see the guys, told them the news, and they seemed even more surprised than during Abigail&#39;s transformation. If we keep on this rythm... I&#39;ll be next... I just realized now that I&#39;m still bare feet and gloved of socks. I quickly remedy to this problem, but I swear Trevor was looking.<br />
<br />
Revand: This... This is something I didn&#39;t expect...Not that I expected anything really. But this is just depraved... strange...<br />
<br />
Samilla: The changes can be anything...<br />
<br />
The sound of an egg falling on the ground echoed in the central room were the guys had retreated earlier and where we all are now. Hadley&#39;s face frowned slightly before she tried to regain composure again.<br />
<br />
Hadley: Is there... anything we can do?<br />
<br />
Abigail: If there was, I would&#39;ve got these cat ears off of me right away.<br />
<br />
Revand: Well... all I can say, is to stay careful from now on.<br />
<br />
Abigail: Like we weren&#39;t already! It&#39;s you that told us that we should still eat anyway!<br />
<br />
Revand: Y-yes but... I was just warning everyone to...<br />
<br />
Abigail: To what? Theres no way to distinguish normal items from the magical ones! So what&#39;s the point? Being scared of everything? At some point we&#39;ll use the oven or something and guess what? It&#39;s might transforma someone! And we&#39;ll have no way to do anything about it! I&#39;m tired of this whole mess! And you take the all mighty act and decided to be our leader or something?<br />
<br />
Revand: I&#39;m just trying to keep our security paramount! We don&#39;t want what happened to you or Hadley to continue!<br />
<br />
Abigail: HA! Well your plan worked so far huh? We&#39;re already two down, and theres no guarantee for the others!<br />
<br />
Revand: I cannot do anything about it okay! I do my best, and if you&#39;re not please, just go away and do your own things!<br />
<br />
Abigail: You know what? That&#39;s what I&#39;m going to do! Everyone that&#39;s on my side! Come to the courtyard! I&#39;m going to make this work for real, and not let everyone get transformed!<br />
<br />
Hadley: Abigail... sweetie that&#39;s not necessary... Revand did his best so far and...<br />
<br />
Abigail: So stay with him! And get changed into a monster I guess!<br />
<br />
Trevor: Miss Abigail, that&#39;s nonsense! We can&#39;t be bulletproof out of all this, but Revand&#39;s system is our best shot!<br />
<br />
I see tears starting to build up into Abigail&#39;s eyes. She has had enough. The cat girl slammed the door of the courtyard when she exited, letting us all to ponder the argument that just happened. Nobody was moving...<br />
<br />
Revand: Well... If anybody is still with me, I&#39;ll be in the kitchen again, trying to manage something out...<br />
<br />
He left, and one after the others, they all followed him. Or at least almost all of them. I was left in the central room with Farim. And after a while, they actually left for the courtyard? I did not expect that... But that leave me wondering... Should I stay with the rest of the group and Revand&#39;s organized but unsteady tactic, or should I listen to the resilience and courage of Abigail, who seeks the good for us? I don&#39;t know what to chose anymore...</p>
