<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I was starting to get horny. My pussy was getting really wet thinking about having sex with Sam. I could tell that she was feeling the same. It didn't matter that Ron would be fucking one of us a little later. We both wanted him to have at least one sexual encounter before I changed him.<br />
<br />
Suddenly I saw Billy in the crowd. Billy was as much of a D&amp;D addict as Ron. Ron had told us that Billy was usually an elf in the game too. The only difference was that Billy picked a male elf. This gave me an idea.<br />
<br />
Ron seemed to be thinking along the same lines as he said &quot;Allison, you should transform Billy. I think that he would like to be an elf.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you still want to have sex as a guy before I change you?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well since I've never had sex before it doesn't matter to me&quot; Ron said.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you're going to make Billy Ron's boyfriend then we should include him in our group&quot; Danny said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a good idea&quot; Jack said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's go talk to him then&quot; Sam said. &quot;And let's make it quick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you want to make it quick?&quot; Ron asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You really need to get a clue&quot; Jen said. &quot;She's horny and she needs some relief.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, ok&quot; Ron said.<br />
<br />
We approached Billy who was standing near the edge of the carnival. When we got close Ron said &quot;Hi Billy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hi Ron&quot; Billy said. &quot;Having fun?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More than you know&quot; Ron said. &quot;I have a question to ask you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; Billy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you like to become an elf?&quot; Ron asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I sure would&quot; Billy said. &quot;But I know that it's not possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well stop thinking that because we can make it happen&quot; Ron said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah right&quot; Billy said sceptically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well actually it's Allison who can do it&quot; Ron said. &quot;But if you don't believe me we'll just have to show you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would like to see you prove it&quot; Billy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Change me first Allison&quot; Ron said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright&quot; I said. &quot;But first there's something else I should do. Billy, you keep all of your memories when reality changes as well as gain new memories to fit the new reality.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever&quot; Billy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just wait&quot; Ron said. &quot;You'll be blown away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So blow me away already&quot; Billy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ron, you are a female elf&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
Ron changed immediately. His black hair lightened until it was a platinum blond and grew down to his waist. His eyes changed from hazel to ice blue. His arms and hands slimmed becoming more feminine. His face became more feminine as well. He shrank until he was five foot one. I could see breasts form and grow to about a c cup. The most striking change though was his ears. The tips grew up and became pointed.<br />
<br />
Ron's clothes also changed. His tee shirt and pants became a green dress. There was some sheer fabric on the outside and something more substantial under that so Ron was covered up. The underlying fabric was like a tank top that showed off his cleavage while the sheer outer fabric went down to his elbows. The shoes that he was wearing changed into sandals that had straps criss-crossing over the top of his foot. His glasses disappeared. Evidently as an elf he didn't<br />
need them anymore. A couple of gold bracelets appeared on his left wrist. A gold ankle bracelet appeared on his right ankle. A necklace with a green stone and a fine gold chain appeared around his neck. A pair of earrings with the same green stone appeared in on his ears. A slim gold ring with another green stone appeared on his middle finger on his right hand. A green handbag appeared in his hand.<br />
<br />
Ron's transformation was finished. Now the memories came in. Ron's name was now Rayna. Some of the jocks in school had been pestering her to go out with them and she had kept telling them that she wasn't interested in them. One tried to force himself on her and that's when Danny came around the corner and pulled that jock off of her. They became friends right there.<br />
<br />
Rayna swooned a bit and I grabbed her to keep her from falling. &quot;Don't worry&quot; I said. &quot;It will pass.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now I know how you felt when new memories flooded your mind&quot; Rayna said.<br />
<br />
Billy looked at Rayna and said &quot;I can hardly believe this! You just transformed into a female elf! And one gorgeous one at that! Even though I know that you were a guy I want to have sex with you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that will have to wait&quot; Rayna said. &quot;I just can't get interested in you as you are. You have to become an elf.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem there&quot; Billy said. &quot;I want to be an elf. Please make me an elf Allison.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Billy&quot; I said. &quot;You are an elf.&quot;<br />
<br />
Billy's transformation wasn't as dramatic as Rayna's was. He lost just a couple of inches. His ears became longer and pointed like Rayna's. His red hair changed to almost the same platinum blond as Rayna's hair. His eyes changed from brown to a piercing blue.<br />
<br />
Billy's clothes didn't really change. His shirt became a red silk one. His pants became some type of black fabric that I couldn't identify. His shoe changed to boots. A thick gold ring with a blue stone in it appeared on his middle finger on his right hand.<br />
<br />
Then new memories came in. Billy was now Bandor. He and Rayna have been going out for about a year now though they haven't had sex yet. At least that's what Rayna has told me, Sam, and Jen.<br />
<br />
Bandor staggered a bit but quickly recovered himself. &quot;Well this is weird&quot; he said. &quot;Right now me and Rayna are the only two elves in existence besides our families.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At least you get to remember your previous life&quot; Danny said. &quot;Everyone else besides us don't know anything has happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you do this Allison?&quot; Bandor asked.<br />
<br />
I held up my right hand and said &quot;This ring changes reality to make what I say the truth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I'm glad that you can alter reality&quot; Bandor said. &quot;You've made me really happy. I'm an elf and I have a gorgeous elf girlfriend. Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're welcome&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sam, I now know why you said you wanted to hurry&quot; Rayna said looking longingly at Bandor.<br />
<br />
Danny and Jen were in quiet conversation about something. I had a good idea about what they were talking about. Finally Danny said &quot;I have some good news. Jen and I are getting back together. We're going to go to my house now.&quot;<br />
<br />
I saw that Jack was a bit down now. He was the only one who wasn't going out with someone. I decided to do something about that and knowing that he was straight said &quot;There's a girl for you here at the carnival Jack. You two will meet tonight. What happens between you two is up to you two.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Allison&quot; Jack said a little happier. &quot;You guys go ahead and go. I know you want to. I'll stick around for awhile longer. I was planning on doing that anyway before you said that I'd meet a girl here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope that you'll be happy with the girl you meet&quot; Sam said.<br />
<br />
We all said our good nights and went our separate ways. Jack staying at the carnival, Bandor and Rayna going to her house, Danny and Jen going his house, and me and Sam going to her house which happened to be closer than mine.<br />
<br />
On the way to Sam's house we had to walk through downtown. We had heard stories of girls getting rapped at night recently. I was pretty confident that we wouldn't be rapped. If anyone tried I could turn them into something that wouldn't harm us. Not only would we be spared the rape but other victims wouldn't have gone through it either. I didn't know that my overconfidence would lead to our rape.<br />
<br />
As we passed a dark alley someone grabbed me from behind and placed some cloth over my mouth and nose. This cloth smelled funny but I couldn't tell what the smell was. I struggled to get loose but whoever had a hold of me was strong. Out of the corner of my eye I saw that Sam was in a similar situation. I desperately wanted to say something to turn whoever had ambushed us into something. I couldn't speak though as the person who had a hold of me was keeping my mouth shut.<br />
<br />
As I continued to struggle I noticed that my attempts to free myself kept growing weaker and weaker. Soon I was unable to struggle and my eyes closed. As I fell into blackness I thought that me and Sam were about to be rapped. Or maybe a worse fate awaited us.</p>
