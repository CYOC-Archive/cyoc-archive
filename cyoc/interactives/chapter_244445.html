<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As he sat in front of his laptop, Richard tried to work out how it was possible for software downloaded from a disk to do as it claimed it could. On one hand, he didn&#39;t believe for a second it could. A lot of what it claimed could only be accomplished by being born with such features, or the option of surgery to alter a person&#39;s appearance. Yet, on the other hand, he&#39;d read fantasy books of such transformation, though none which involved a computer programme, so, despite his best efforts, he did wonder if there was any truth, or someone had taken the fantasy elements and made them real.<br />
<br />
&quot;Must be like larping or so type of role-play game,&quot; he thought after a bit.<br />
<br />
He had tried table-top, swords and sorcery types games briefly in Junior High, but it hadn&#39;t gone anywhere. The sessions set up through a club, he attended a couple of them, but stopped going when they people in charge didn&#39;t invite him back and the rest of the group made it clear he wasn&#39;t welcome. Having found this to be hilarious at the time, as the people who were part of the club were like him, the social outcasts, he discovered he was still amused by it. Thinking about the club, he wondered if what he&#39;d been sent was some sort of online computer game, which he figured might make it easier for him to connect with other people. Deciding this must be what the Chronivac was, he leaned forward, ran his finger across the trackpad, and tapped the option to scan him.<br />
<br />
A window popped asking if he wanted use the emitter or the built-in camera, and selecting the camera option, he was instructed to stand a couple feet away from the computer. After turning to his left, his right, around, then in a complete circle, Richard sat back down. Watching as the Chronivac loaded the information, he soon was soon looking at an in-depth and detailed profile of himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;How is this possible?&quot; he asked himself as he noted there were areas greyed out, preventing access, drop-down menus, and things which only became available when he made a choice. Discovering a timer, he wondered if it was to be set so a person didn&#39;t spend too long playing, and was thoroughly confused by the awareness option. Toggling through it, he left it set on only him being aware of any changes, and scrolling back up, he stopped at the top.<br />
<br />
The option for his name, birthdate, current date, sex, gender, height, weight, and species catching his attention, he highlighted his name, deleted it, changed it to something else, deleted that, inputted a third name, then reverted his name back. Playing with the sex and gender option, which allowed him to be male, female, girl, boy, woman, man, among other things he&#39;d never considered before, he tapped on the species list, and saw the longest list of creatures he&#39;d ever seen. Seeing things real, imaginative, as well as extinct, he clicked on cat, and watched his profile shift to accommodate his new species. Reverting things back to their default, he scrolled down. Wondering what he ought to change, if anything, he stopped when he reached information on his genitals.<br />
<br />
With a series of clicks and taps, he gave himself a dog&#39;s cock and the nuts of a mouse. Smiling at this, he observed how, unlike when he altered his species, nothing else changed. Tempted to revert it back, Richard instead wanted to know what would happen if he told the programme to save the changes then clicked on the option to initiate them. Making a few other changes, he gave himself the four nipples of an otter, and the white fur coat of an arctic fox and set it so the fur covered him from the neck down, but left his hands and feet bare.<br />
<br />
Amused by all of this, Richard almost undid everything, but, at last minute, added a timer for ten hours, saved the new information, and before he could change his mind, tapped the option to initiate the transformation. Expecting to see an error message because he hadn&#39;t provided enough information or to be taken to another page, Richard wasn&#39;t caught unaware when he suddenly felt hot. And then, as his abdomen started to tingle, he also grew flushed and turned on. Pushing away from the kitchen table and standing, knocking over the chair in the process, he let out a sensual gasp.<br />
<br />
Somehow, yet unsure how, managing to get his clothes off, which really didn&#39;t do anything to relieve how hot he suddenly was, he stumbled out of the kitchen, and ended up in the tub in the bathroom. Barely aware of the pelt of fur growing over him, Richard&#39;s attention was for the most part focused on the four sensitive teats he now had down on his abdomen and his morphing genitals. His cock turning bright red, getting bulbous at one end, it took him a moment to make himself reach down and touch it. But once he did, it was as if whatever was holding him back was swept away, and starting to work at it, he quickly figured out how to make it become hard, all as he developed a penile bone and sheath. Using one hand to stroke it, another to play with his teats, moaning and whimpering softly as he did so, it didn&#39;t take him long before he got his rocks off and blew his load. Seeing his cum looked like it usually did, the only problem he had was how much of a sticky mess it made in the white fur now covering him from the neck down.<br />
<br />
His transformation finished, he didn&#39;t move at first from where he was lying. Looking down at the white fur, touching it every so often, finding it soft to the touch, he also stared at his privates. His cock soon withdrawing back into his sheath, he noted his nuts didn&#39;t look too different, as they appeared to be a sack now covered in fur. Thinking about what was inside it, wondering if, like his dick, they&#39;d changed like he&#39;d told the programme, and he now had the balls of a mouse, he sat up, reached for the spigot, and began to run the faucet in the tub. Playing with the knobs until he had the right amount of warmth from the water, he stood, clicked on the shower, and began to slow process of cleaning himself up.<br />
<br />
Never had any experience washing a dog or a cat, Richard was unprepared for how much it took to clean the fur now covering his body. Trying his usual soap first, he soon gave up when it proved ineffectual and instead switched to his shampoo. Going through almost the rest of the bottle, it took him a bit before he worked out how to scrub the fur, the area around his genitals, as well as his teats, which were still sensitive to touch. Afterward, he went through almost every last towel he owned to dry off the fur, and even than he couldn&#39;t get it fully dry. Figuring to let the rest air-dry, he wandered back out to the kitchen. Righting the chair he&#39;d tipped over, he collected his clothes, draped his suitcoat over the back of the chair, then headed for his bedroom.<br />
<br />
There, he extracted his belt, tossed it on the bed, and threw the rest of the clothes into the laundry hamper. Starting to get used to what he&#39;d done to himself, Richard headed back to kitchen. Sitting down at the table, he woke the laptop up from its sleep mode, and began scrolling through the Chronivac software. Checking the timer, which he now understood was counting down until around 5.49 am when he’d revert back to how he was originally was, he set about exploring the programme and seeing what else it could do.</p>
