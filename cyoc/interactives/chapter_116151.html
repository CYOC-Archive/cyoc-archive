<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Feeling easier - in body, if not in conscience - after her discussion with Kayl, Merse completed her survey around the perimeter of the village and made her way towards it, confident she had allowed enough time to pass between her own approach and that of Pia and Drin.  Although Glasser Ridge was fortified enough to keep out most mountain beasts, it seemed surprisingly open for a town supposedly beset by bandits.  The guards at the gate appeared bored, but they did try to give the impression they were doing their job.<br />
<br />
&quot;A traveler?&quot;  one inquired skeptically.  &quot;What brings you this far out into the range?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just wandering,&quot;  Merse replied tersely, but made certain to act as though she were being secretive.  As dangerous as the mountain range was, if one was wanted for crimes in the realm, it was one of the easier ways to exit the realm while avoiding the border guards.  As there was little law enforcement presence at Glasser Ridge, the town guards would be less likely to bother with her if they thought she was a fugitive, since she might cause more trouble than their pay was worth if accosted.  Far better to feign ignorance and let the mountains kill her.  After scrutinizing her some more, the guards let her in, and she even managed to procure directions to the only inn in town.<br />
<br />
Upon entering the city, Merse trudged slowly towards the inn, taking her time and using her obvious unfamiliarity with the area as an excuse to look about.  As she walked, she noted an odd sharpness in the gaze of each person she passed, as though they were evaluating her surreptitiously.  Furthermore, there were no children or elderly in sight.  Even though this was a rough town, and not exactly family-friendly, even Dregsbale had its share of vulnerable citizens, which it duly exploited.  However, in Glasser Ridge it appeared every individual was rangy and alert, much more than a washed-out mining town should be.  When the mine began to dry up, those who could leave had done so, but none of the current inhabitants looked like anything was preventing them from leaving.  Merse blew on her hands to warm them as she finally approached the inn.<br />
<br />
Renting a room from the unctuous innkeeper, Merse followed the proprietor up a ramshackle stairway and down a dim hallway to a row of doors.  As she passed one, she smelled a unique odor.  Unlocking the next door room, the innkeeper indicated for Merse to enter.  After the door closed, Merse dropped her bags, then walked over to the wall separating her from the room with the strange smell, giving it a few taps.  Sitting calmly on the bed, Merse chewed on a bit of dried meat, and waited for night.  <br />
<br />
Sure enough, as soon as darkness fell and the majority of activity on the streets ceased, a slight knock came at the window.  Merse quickly opened it, and in slipped Pia from the ledge outside, having climbed across from her own window.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we really stepped into the hornet&#39;s nest this time, eh?&quot;  Pia grinned mirthlessly as she leaned back against the wall. <br />
<br />
&quot;The entire town, huh?  They&#39;re ambitious, I&#39;ll give &#39;em that,&quot;  Merse said thoughtfully.  &quot;What do you think happened to everyone else?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d rather not know,&quot;  Pia scowled, &quot;But I can guess.  Anyway, we&#39;re lucky they put us next to each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Drin?&quot;  Merse asked questioningly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn fool fell asleep, smartest move he&#39;s made since I met him,&quot;  Pia remarked sarcastically.  <br />
<br />
&quot;When do you want to make our move?&quot;  Merse raised an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably tomorrow night;  I can play apothecary during the day and scout the place, then we&#39;ll...&quot;  Pia stopped suddenly, dropping to the ground and placing her ear against the floor.  &quot;Six, maybe seven!  Damn, I didn&#39;t think they&#39;d move this fast.  Must be starvin&#39; up here to be that desperate.  So much for the plan...how should we play this?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Merse&#39;s brow furrowed as she considered how to deal with the bandits, straining her ears for the telltale creak of boots on the stairs.<br />
<br />

<br />
Fens panted heavily as he glared at the scruffy young heretic, who was simply standing about, as relaxed as if he were merely out for a stroll.  However, Fens had been attacking the man for the past hour, to no avail.  The heretic priest had simply sidestepped Fens&#39; onslaught as though he were gracefully allowing someone to pass him.  The man did not match the scent of what he assumed was the Soul-stealer, and as he had made no moves to attack Fens, Fens was fairly certain he was no slaver.  Nevertheless, the man&#39;s capabilities did leave Fens on edge, as he had never met a human who could move like that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we talk now?&quot;  the heretic asked cheerfully.  Deciding he had more important matters to attend to, Fens opted to withdraw.  Grinding his teeth at the half-smile on the heretic&#39;s face, Fens made another rush at the priest, lashing out as he moved past.  Although the heretic dodged as easily as before, this time Fens continued his forward momentum and began running full-speed through the forest in the direction he had last detected the Soul-stealer&#39;s scent.   Turning his thoughts to his prey, it was only when he noticed movement out of the corner of his eye that he skidded to a stop.<br />
<br />
&quot;You had your fun, now it&#39;s only fair you answer my questions,&quot;  the grinning heretic stated, standing directly in Fen&#39;s path as though he had merely stepped out of the forest.  Fens glared at the stranger, astounded at the impossible speed of what seemed a mere human, but no human could run faster than a wolfen on all fours!  However, while Fens tried to get over his shock, the next words he heard made his blood run cold.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot;  the heretic chuckled.  &quot;What can you tell me about this thing the tribes are calling a Soul-stealer?&quot;</p>
