<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty decided to make himself into a clown, but he wanted to do it right. He wanted to be the king of the clowns. He thinks about it for a moment, and when he&#39;s ready he decides to join in the fun. He closed his eyes and wishes to become the Clown King. <br />
<br />
After a minute he could feel that his changes were complete, he wishes for theirs to be a mirror in front of him, and when he sees himself, standing their is a clown with white skin, blue hair in an enormous afro, his checks had red circles on them and their was yellow eyeshadow around his eyes and it went up to his eyebrows, which were now black lines that went up in upside down &quot;U&quot;s that made him look suprised. His lips were now much thicker and were a shade of red that exaggerated them into a smile that felt stuck on his face. His ears had doubled in size and his nose was now a bright red sphere that was enormous on his face. <br />
<br />
His original clothes had turned into clothes fit for a clown king. His shirt was white with rainbow polka dots and around his neck was a ring of rifles that were yellow and had red strikes on the edges. His pants had grown until the band was hula hoop sized and were green and blue striped. They were held up by red suspenders that went over his shoulders, and the pants showed off his red heart underwear. On his feet were green and purple polka dotted socks that led his now size 20 feet in bright classic red clown shoes. To finish a red cape was on his back with rainbow edges and a gold crown with rainbow gems was on his head. <br />
<br />
Ty looked at himself and couldn&#39;t help laughing he looked SO funny. <br />
<br />
Now to grow my new population of subjects. Ty thought as he walked around the mall making more clowns just by waving his hand. After a while Ty got bored of this and decided to add some fun to everything. But he had to do something first. <br />
<br />
He looked around and saw the perfect someone. It was a large portly girl about his age with glasses, obviously a nerd who was crying as a group of other kids her age walked away laughing. <br />
<br />
Ty looked at the girl and got a great idea and decided to make her his queen. A clown queen, the city his kingdom, and the mall his castle fun house.  <br />
<br />
He walked near her, and she was dumbstruck at the clown standing in front of her. Ty looked at the girl and said &quot;Want to have those bullies bow down to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...yeah but how...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty said that as he pointed at each of the bullies, and they turned into fat, short, and dumb clowns that were almost immediately tripping over one another and being pranked. <br />
<br />
The girl couldn&#39;t help laughing.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s amazing, but how will that make me better than them?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Close your eyes, don&#39;t open them again until I tell you. Hyuck-hyuck&quot; Ty said this with and chuckle. <br />
<br />
The girl did so and Ty went to work. He first made her skin white as snow like his. Her lips then became a large Cupid&#39;s bow smile in red, and her cheeks had red blush on them. Blue diamonds them covered her eyes, and her eyebrows then disappeared and became drawn on swirly black lines. Her eyelashes then grew out until they looked almost anime proportions and caused them to flutter whenever she blinked. Her hair then  grew out and became southern belle style curls which then turned the same red as her lips and nose which was now a small feminine but very definite clown nose. Her facial features then softened into the features of a cute but beautiful clown. Her breasts also tripled in size and her but doubled giving her a heart shaped posterior. <br />
<br />
Next her original clothes began to change. Her original shirt and jean bloomed out into new clothes. First her pants became a pair of yellow and red bloomers, and her socks contradicted the pattern. Her shoes became Mary Janes with bubble toes with a red and white pattern and finally the rest of her clothes bloomed out in a dress, but this dress was an elegant crinoline with at least 3 feet of petticoats and large shoulder poofs. There was a red heart on the chest, with and the main was a bright blend of rainbow colors making it seem that a rainbow was created every time she turned. A small tiara appeared on her large fancy red hair, and two extremely large gold hoop earring hung from her ears that rested on her shoulders. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okie dokie, open you eyes.&quot;<br />
<br />
The new clown queen did and she saw her new clothes, felt her new hair. Touched her new crown, and Ty then squeezed her new nose and it made a high pitched beep. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my... this is... this is... the most wonderful thing that ever happens to me.&quot; She said in a high pitched voice and she spun around causing her dress to flail out making a rainbow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you...um...I&#39;m sorry what&#39;s your name, mines Sally.&quot; She said in a coy voice and a blush of embarrassment. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mine is Ty, the clown king. I saw you looking unhappy and I decided to make you happy and my queen. Now then, shall we go grow our kingdom together my queen.&quot; Ty said as he held out her arm, and Sally took it. &quot;Of course my king, I want to break in these new shoes and this dress.&quot; She said as she rested her newly form parodic on her shoulder, took Ty&#39;s arm, and the two of them walked toward the original jewelry store, or what was the Jewlery store. It was now overrun with clowns and every kind of prank you could imagine. But they all recognized the two royals as their leaders and they bowed their heads and honked their noses as they passed. Ty and Sally walked into the original Jewlery store where the clown ringmaster was outfitting a new clown man with a jumpsuit that perfectly fit him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ringmaster.&quot; Ty said aloud in a tone that suggested he wanted to talk to her. She saw him and walked over, her big shoes squeaking every time she took a step. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes my king.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have some business matters to attend to. I would like your two first assistants to accompany me. Also give them some clownzookas. While I am away I want you to clown every person who comes into the mall.&quot; Ty said<br />
<br />
The two original assistants, Hayley and Lisa skipped over to their king. With thier clownzookas at their sides. &quot;We have a mission, before I was you&#39;re king I had a family who was mean to me and made my life miserable. But now we are on a mission to go and have them join our cause and see the proper way to treat me and how to experience life.&quot; Hayley and Lisa giggled and honked their noses as the four of them began moving towards the mall door transforming every human they encountered. <br />
<br />
Sally asked, &quot; are we going to walk all the way there darling?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No we are going to travel with good speed and fun.&quot; Ty said that as he willed for his transportation to come it was....</p>
