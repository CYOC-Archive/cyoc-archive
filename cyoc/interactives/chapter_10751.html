<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Twin bothers Doug and Sergio weren’t exactly the most popular guys in school. They were both seventeen years old, they were about 6 ft 2 inches tall and they both weighed well over 300 pounds. They both had short, red hair and they loved wearing black leather jackets to school. They normally didn’t talk to anybody unless they needed something, and most people stayed away from them because they were known for their short tempers. <br />
<br />
Now Doug had met a cute African American girl named Rachel in math class and Sergio had befriended a Hispanic girl named Conchita in science. When the two brothers were separate, they were very friendly towards everyone. But when the bothers were together, it seemed like there was some sort of competition going on between the two brothers to see who came across as being the most “macho”. They were loud, rude and obnoxious, and they would treat their dates badly. Time and time again they would receive warnings at school, that their unacceptable behavior would not be tolerated on school grounds. So they decided to only hang out off school property, like at the pool hall down the street.<br />
<br />
It just happened to be that there was a party in the main auditorium at the high school, and both Ty and Peter were in the planning committee for the party. The high school’s Key Club organized it, and Ty and Peter had volunteered to help out. It was at this party that trouble would break out between the two couples.<br />
<br />
“Peter! I need you to run to the store and buy four more bottles of soda for the guests!” Ty shouted at his cousin, who was hanging decorations on the wall by the main stage. Ty was in the kitchen and was helping his buddies prepare the lasagna for that night’s dinner.<br />
<br />
“Ty! Do you have any money on you?” Peter asked him. Ty then grabbed a ten Dollar bill out of his wallet. He ten stretched his right hand all the way from the kitchen to the stage area, where Peter was standing. “Oh good, thanks, stretchy cousin!” Peter said, as he grabbed the money from Ty’s elongated hand. Ty quickly allowed his arm to snap back to its normal length, so that nobody would see him use his stretchy powers.<br />
<br />
“I’ll be right back, cousin!” Peter said. He then vanished into thin air, just before the first guests started to arrive.<br />
<br />
Just at that moment Angela walked in, carrying a large tray with snacks and veggies. She walked to the kitchen, where Ty was busy preparing the soup while Allen and Jason were preparing the lasagna and dessert.<br />
<br />
“Thank you so much for helping us with this party, Ty!” Angela said to him. She put the tray on the kitchen counter and walked over to Ty, who was standing in front of the large stove.<br />
<br />
Angela was part Caucasian and part Hispanic, so she knew how to speak Spanish as well. She had originally transferred from Miami and was a straight-A student in school. Not only that, but she was the President of the Key Club. She was just over 5 feet tall and had long, black hair. She wore a long, red dress and she had high heels on her feet. She liked Ty a lot, and wanted to use the opportunity to show him how much she appreciated his help.<br />
<br />
“Hey there muchacho… I think your soup is hot…” she said, as she walked up to him. Ty was caught by surprise when he turned and realized that she was standing very close to him. He then turned towards her, as she wrapped her long, slender arm around his shoulders.<br />
<br />
“You know what I think, Tyler?” she whispered to him. Ty cleared his throat.<br />
<br />
“What do you think, Angela?” he replied quietly, as he looked at the girl’s big, blue eyes.<br />
<br />
“I think your soup isn’t just the only hot stuff around here…” Angela replied, as she gently pulled Ty towards her.<br />
<br />
“May I have the first dance with you tonight?” Ty asked her, with a smile. He immediately wished for his shirt and jeans to disappear. Ty was now dressed in a black suit with a red tie, dress shoes and nice, black pair of slacks. Ty then looked over at the stereo and wished for the CD player to start playing a soft tune, as Ty and Angela made their way out of the kitchen. They walked on to the center of the dance floor as they enjoyed their slow dance. Ty had wrapped his right arm around Angela’s back, while he held on to her right hand with his left hand by his side. When the song had ended, Ty and Angela were surprised to hear a single applause.<br />
<br />
“Awww that was so romantic! Bravo, bravo!” Peter said, as he was still clapping his hands. Both Angela and Ty grinned when they saw Peter.  “Wow, Ty! You’re looking sharp, cousin!” Peter said when he saw Ty in his new suit. Ty then walked on over to Peter, while Angela got the cups out of the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“Hey Peter, I think she likes me…” Ty whispered to Peter. Peter’s face lit up, as he was happy that Ty had finally met a girl he liked. “But don’t say anything, okay?” Peter just nodded and assured his cousin that he wouldn’t say anything about their friendship.<br />
<br />
Peter quickly wished for his shirt and jeans to be replaced with his grey suit and navy colored tie. He then took his post by the front door, so that he could greet the guests and usher them to their seats so they could have dinner.<br />
<br />
No sooner had Peter taken his position, or Sergio and Conchita had entered the room. Peter ushered them to one of the tables and pulled up two chairs so that they could take their seats. Angela was best friends with Conchita, and she came up to the table to greet the couple. Several minutes later, Doug and Rachel walked in. Peter asked them if they had a preference for where they wanted to sit, and Doug stated that he wanted to sit next to his brother Sergio. Peter reluctantly ushered the couple to the table, for he had heard about the two brothers’ behavior at other parties before. He quickly walked up to Ty and quietly told his cousin to keep an eye out to the twin brothers.<br />
<br />
The two couples had only been sitting there for five minutes, or the first argument broke out.<br />
<br />
“I don’t like lasagna. I want to eat something else!” Sergio grumbled, just when Jason and Allen had served the food.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry, but that’s all we got tonight…” Jason replied.<br />
<br />
“Stop complaining, will you?” Conchita said to him. “Ever since you got here, you’ve been in a foul mood! Lighten up, okay?” Sergio wanted to say something, but he kept quiet.<br />
<br />
“I say we go out and get us some pizza or something…” Doug said, with a chuckle. “These guys are amateurs; they don’t know how to cook food!” This made both Rachel and Conchita angry. Especially since the girls knew how much work it was for the club to organize the party.<br />
<br />
At that moment Peter came over and poured water in all the empty glasses, just as the discussion started to heat up. Sergio had actually pulled on the table cloth, moving the glass over and causing Peter to spill water on to the table.<br />
<br />
“Oops! Sorry about that, Sergio…. I’ll clean it up…” Peter said, as he grabbed a towel from another table.<br />
<br />
“You’re such a stupid servant! What do you think you’re doing pouring cold water all over the table? Golly, we should have gone out for pizza instead of coming here to eat with this group of losers!” Sergio complained out loud.<br />
<br />
“Sorry…” Peter said, as he wiped the excess water with the towel. He began to get annoyed with Sergio and Doug, but he decided to stay quiet and walk away.<br />
<br />
Ty had just brought over a bowl of soup for Doug, when Doug gave Ty a nasty look as the bowl was placed before him.<br />
<br />
“What’s this?” Doug sneered, as he stirred the soup with his spoon.<br />
<br />
“It’s French Onion soup! I made it myself!” Ty replied with a smile. He worked hard at making a very good pot of soup, especially since it was the first time he ever had the opportunity to cook for a large group of people.<br />
<br />
“I don’t want it. It looks disgusting!” Doug said, as he grabbed the bowl of soup and turned it upside down, pouring the soup on to the floor, just in front of Ty’s feet! At first Ty was astonished when he did this. Then he became angry, so he turned around and walked towards Peter, who was standing by the entrance.<br />
<br />
“What a bunch of jerks! What’s their problem? If they hate our food then why did they come here in the first place?” Peter wondered out loud.<br />
<br />
“They’re here because the girls were the ones who wanted to come. They are both good friends of Angela, so they obviously knew about this party.” Ty replied.<br />
<br />
“I have a bad feeling about these guys. Let’s watch them closely…” Peter warned Ty.<br />
<br />
Allen started to play some CD’s with soft tunes, so that the couples could dance on the dance floor. Ty walked up to Angela right away, and the two were the first ones on the floor. They were quickly followed by Doug and Rachel. A few minutes later, Sergio and Conchita took to the floor as well. Both Rachel and Conchita had a hard time dancing with their partners. Not only were both men taller, but both women were wearing high heels in order to get a little closer to the height of the two men. Instead of making it easier on the women, both men were very rough on them, pushing and shoving the smaller women on the dance floor. <br />
<br />
At one point, Conchita lost her balance, and came crashing down on the floor. Allen immediately stopped the music, and Peter and Ty immediately came to see if she was alright. Ty wanted to extend a hand to help her up, but Sergio pushed him out of the way.<br />
<br />
“Get out of my way, bird brain!” Sergio sneered at Ty, as he grabbed hold of Conchita and pulled her up on her feet with much force. Then Conchita fell down again!<br />
<br />
“The heel of my shoe came off, you big brute! Can’t you be any gentler?” she yelled at Sergio. Ty proceeded to help her up again, but Sergio grabbed her first and dragged her to the table.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Sergio! Don’t be so rough on the girl!” Peter shouted at him. But before he could turn around, Doug had grabbed Peter from behind, turned him around, and slammed him with the back against the wall! Doug had knocked the wind out of Peter, and this had angered Ty a lot!<br />
<br />
Sergio then grabbed Ty just as he ran up to Doug, and he held him by his collar. At that moment, Peter had opened his eyes just as Doug was about to deliver another blow to Peter’s abs! At that very same moment, both Peter and Ty shouted something at the same time, and at the top of their lungs.<br />
<br />
“FREEZE!!!” they shouted, and both Doug and Sergio were frozen in time.<br />
<br />
Ty calmly walked back to Conchita and helped her back on her feet. She had to take her shoes off, since one of them had a broken heel. Peter walked up to Rachel, who was obviously shaken by the whole experience and began to cry. When Peter and Ty saw that the girls were alright, they were faced with the decision what to do about Doug and Sergio.<br />
<br />
“Those two big bullies! Somebody ought to teach them a lesson in respect!” Angela shouted.<br />
<br />
“Well, ask and you shall receive!” Ty said with a grin. Ty and Peter used their powers to levitate the frozen figures of Doug and Sergio and to make them appear before the girls. Ty then turned towards Peter to send him a thought using his psychic powers.<br />
<br />
“Peter, you take care of Sergio. I’ll handle Doug. Just follow my lead, okay?” Ty thought to himself. Peter smiled and just nodded back.<br />
<br />
Ty wished for Doug to unfreeze but he didn’t allow Doug to move his feet. Peter picked up on Ty’s wish, and wished the same for Sergio.<br />
<br />
“Hey! What’s going on here? Hey! What the heck? I can’t move!” Sergio said, as he tried to move his legs.<br />
<br />
“What is this? What happened? Why can’t I move?” Doug wondered out loud.<br />
<br />
“You two bullies ought to be ashamed of yourself!” Angela shouted at both men. “Poor Conchita broke her heel of her shoe and you two just continued to act rough with her!”<br />
<br />
“Well, we can’t help it that you two girls are so short and that you need to wear high heels just to get up to our shoulders!” Sergio shouted back.<br />
<br />
“You two should know what it feels like, having to wear high heels just because we’re shorter than you!” Rachel shouted back in anger. Ty and Peter looked each other in the eye and they planned their next move using their psychic abilities.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, both Sergio and Doug began to grow shorter! They were shrinking! Both men gasped as they realized that the room and the people who were standing around them were apparently growing!<br />
<br />
“Hey, I feel weird… My clothes are very loose… OH MY GOD! WHAT’S HAPPENING TO ME?” Sergio cried out loud, as he slowly began to dwindle in size. He went from 6’2” to 5’9” and was now just less than 5’6” tall.<br />
<br />
“What’s this? Are you doing this to me? I’M SHRINKING! STOP THIS! OH MY GOD I’M SHRINKING!” Doug shouted at the top of his lungs!<br />
<br />
Both men were now 5’3”… 5’2”… 5’1”… and the shrinking stopped when they were both exactly 5 feet tall. Ty and Peter just smiled, as the rest of the crowd was silent of shock. It was dead silent in the room, for you could hear a pin drop.<br />
<br />
Sergio and Doug stood there, suddenly looking their dates straight in the eyes!<br />
<br />
“Wait, we’re not done yet! We got another surprise for you!” Ty said to them. Ty then turned towards Peter, and sent him another thought. Peter followed suit and suddenly both Rachel and Conchita found themselves growing taller, even while they weren’t wearing their shoes anymore!<br />
<br />
“Oh my goodness! What is going on? I’m taller… I’M GROWING!” Rachel shouted out loud, as she looked down and realized that her body had grown longer and that the distance to her feet was larger.<br />
<br />
“Que esta pasando? Estoy creciendo! Mi Dios! ES UN MILAGRO!” Conchita shouted as she noticed that she was also growing taller now! Both girls were growing from 5 feet tall and were now slowly passing 5’4”… 5’6”…<br />
<br />
“This is insane! THIS ISN”T HAPPENING!!” Doug cried, as he saw his girlfriend grow taller than him.<br />
<br />
“This is like I’m LIVING OUT A NIGHTMARE!” Sergio shouted, now that he had to look up to Rachel.<br />
<br />
The girls continued to grow from 5’8” to 6’0”… And the growth finally stopped when both girls reached the height of 6’3” tall.<br />
<br />
“Well, it looks like Sergio and Doug are the ones who need to wear high heels now!” Ty shouted out loud! Suddenly Doug and Sergio found themselves levitating in mid air, about 4 inches from the ground. Their own shoes disappeared, and they were suddenly wearing high heel shoes!<br />
<br />
“THIS IS INSANE! PUT US DOWN!!” Sergio screamed at Ty. Ty and Peter then set the two bothers down and allowed them to walk again.<br />
<br />
“We’re OUTTA HERE!” Doug shouted, as he turned around and ran towards the entrance, tripping three times over the high heels that were tightly fastened to his feet. He stopped to try to pull the shoes off, but he couldn’t! Sergio did the same as both brothers stumbled out of the auditorium, falling and cursing along the way, to the delight of all the others who were present in the room.<br />
<br />
“Well, that will teach them! Now, let’s get on with our party!” Ty shouted at the group. Everyone was still left in shock at the strange event that had just taken place, so Ty walked up to Peter and grabbed his hand. There were over 100 people there, so Ty needed to borrow some of Peter’s powers to help make all those who were present to forget what had happened that night. Both Rachel and Conchita shrunk back to their normal height, and Peter used his powers to clean up the mess that was left behind in the auditorium. <br />
<br />
Allen went back to playing music again, and Angela immediately walked up to Ty.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Tyler… May I have this dance?” she asked him. Ty smiled and realized that he couldn’t say no to her, and the two slowly made their way on to the dance floor. <br />
<br />
In the meantime, Peter realized that he was tired of standing around, and he walked up to Conchita.<br />
<br />
Conchita just smiled, as Peter gently held her hand. <br />
<br />
“Conchita, quieres bailar conmigo?” he asked her, with a smile on his face. Her eyes lit up as she showed a smile that went from ear to ear. The two then slowly walked on to the dance floor, as the music continued to play. Even Allen got to dance, when he asked Rachel.<br />
<br />
Then Ty, Peter, and Allen danced the night away with their partners. The rest of the evening was uneventful, except for the many tunes and dance moves that were seen and heard on the dance floor. <br />
<br />
For Ty and Angela, it was like a Royal ball from a fairy tale. For the first time, Ty felt like he really began to show feelings for this girl. He wondered at first if she felt the same about him, for he was scared to read it in her mind. But when the music stopped, Angela closed her eyes and gently kissed Ty on his lips. Ty knew that his feelings about her were confirmed. Ty was in love.</p>
