<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Jenny was downstairs, her older (and only) brother, Samuel, entered their mother&#39;s home office thinking he would find Shannon there.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t, of course, but couldn&#39;t help but notice a strange computer set beside her usual one. Overtaken by curiosity, he examined it thoroughly and discovered the true nature of his reality and how this strange little computer, called a Chronivac, was involved.<br />
<br />
Convinced that if his other sister found it, she would be overflown with jealousy and use its powers to wreak Jenny&#39;s happiness with Jeff in a way worst than Shannon ever did, he decided to change reality profoundly, thinking he could improve the world while at it. But first, he made sure nobody would interrupt or other wise try to stop him while he altered reality.<br />
<br />
Being a man, his first change was to make it so no one would ever think to do a ceremony for a divine wedding, thinking that doing so would be akin to insulting god. (Or <em>the gods</em>, depending on their religion.) Instead the very fact god(s) united them and the presence of the link was all that was needed, making all couples under such circumstances make substantial economies.<br />
<br />
He followed this with creating a similar kind of link between parents and children, but not necessarily biological ones. Kids abandoned at birth wouldn&#39;t have such a link, (being orphaned because your parents died being another thing altogether) while adopted ones would have it with the peoples that took them in as part of their family.<br />
<br />
Then it was time to take care of the Shannon/Jeff case. First, he deleted all this nonsense about a ‘Jeff-mode’. While Jeff still existed as a parasite having taken over Samuel mother&#39;s body and life, the only voice he could use was Shannon&#39;s. Jeff would now also be very uncomfortable at any reference to his true self, preferring people to treat him as Shannon O&#39;Brian. The only concession he made was to let Jeff have his blue eyes instead of Shannon&#39;s green ones. That, and the well hidden retractile pennis business.<br />
<br />
As a bonus, he made it so Jenny and Jeff were born on the same day, which was also Shannon birthday. Not only that, but it was also on their 14th birthday that Jeff both became Jenny&#39;s husband and took over Shannon&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
But it still wasn&#39;t enough, not if he also wanted to improve the world, so he altered things so instead of whatever god or gods there was out-there, there was three goddesses, the first being a dragoness, and her two daughters being a nine-tailed kitsune and a phoenix. Unable to relate with humans the matriarch of the goddesses decided to give her role, powers and knowledge to a mortal. She arbitrarily decided to let luck choose, which ended with the powers going to Shannon who, thankfully, was currently in the process of being taken over by Jeff.<br />
<br />
While he was making Shannon&#39;s body his own, Jeff felt huge powers and infinite knowledge enter his entire self, be it his parasitic self or what used to be his mother-in-law. He could feel Shannon becoming younger, turning back to her 20, an age she would now keep forever. He could also tell that on top of his womanly form, he could also take the form of a dragon, or rather a dragoness.<br />
<br />
Not wanting to be separated from her mother, and not really understanding what was happening nor what it mean, the youngest goddess, the phoenix, decided to do the same as the dragoness and gave her role, powers and knowledge to Jenny, since she is Shannon&#39;s own daughter.<br />
<br />
As the phoenix&#39;s powers entered her, Jenny was feeling like her body was on fire, not understanding what was happening to her until she gained enough of the relatively young goddess knowledge, at which point she also knew that, unlike her mother, she didn&#39;t gain eternal youth. Instead she would age just like mortals do and, once too old to live, (or if she got killed) she would turn in cinders and be reborn as a baby, but with all the knowledge and memories from her previous life. What she didn&#39;t realize back then is that since her main form was human, even through she gained the ability to turn into a phoenix, she wouldn&#39;t turn into an egg from which she would then hatch. Instead, Shannon would be pregnant again, Jenny&#39;s birth somehow timed so she would always be born on her mother&#39;s anniversary. Of course, since their rebirth is the nearest thing a phoenix (divine or not) have to reproduction, Jenny was now sterile, but because of her new nature as a phoenix (even if its NOT her main form) she doesn&#39;t care.<br />
<br />
Unlike in the previous reality, Laura wasn&#39;t born as the older sister of Jenny and Sam, but as the third goddess, the kitsune one. In the new reality, she at first accepted what the rest of her family had donne. In becoming the new divine matriarch, Jeff didn&#39;t just become the head god/goddess, the one other divinities must obey, he also inherited the previous dragon&#39;s parental link with the two other goddess. Laura didn&#39;t care having become the daughter of a former mortal, one that somehow was both man and woman, even if he couldn&#39;t acknowledge his male side and was very uncomfortable when someone else did. Didn&#39;t care that her new little sister was also her step-mother either.<br />
<br />
Naturally, a lot of time had passed since and, having their goddesses now living among them, humanity slowly but surely turned to them guide and govern, to the point Shannon became the world empress which, in turn, slowly fused all languages in a single one.<br />
<br />
But even with all those precautions, Sam was still convinced that, if Laura found the Chronivac, she would ruin everything.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s where you&#39;ll learn of the place Sam made for himself in this new reality.<br />
<br />
Since the time between one of Jenny&#39;s birth and her being old enough to have sex is rather long, Jeff often use his dual nature to have sex with himself, sometime resulting in his sperm impregnating the part of him that is Shannon, and having a mortal, human child 9months later. Sam was one of those. Then, around 2 years after his birth a terrorist infiltrated his home and killed Jenny, causing her to be reborn again, as his little (but still divine) sister. What they only discovered years later, after Jenny reached 16 again, was that said terrorist had been helped by none other than Laura, who had not only grow jealous of Jenny&#39;s relationship with their mother, but also came to hate humanity, the very idea of having former mortals for relatives now disgusting her.<br />
<br />
After thinking on it, and since trying to reason with Laura only made things worst, Jeff saw only one solution. He turned Sam into a parasite, the way he had become one himself so long ago, and used his divine powers so Sam would be able to take over Laura&#39;s body. Still, Jeff had made some change compared to his case, so Sam would change his new body to make it look more like a female version of his old self, although with nine fox-tails and the ears being fox-like. He also made sure that, while Sam inherited all of Laura&#39;s powers and knowledge, none of her memories would be left, her mind proper being whipped-out.<br />
<br />
Naturally, now being a Kitsune, Sam became a shape-shifter, perfectly able to turn into his old self or a full kitsune of either gender. And yes, taking over Laura&#39;s body made Sam identifies as female now, somehow, having changed her name from  Samuel to Samuelle, but still prefer to shorten it as Sam. Some peoples still call her Laura, like the previous owner of her goddesshood, but she don&#39;t mind it, she make a better Laura than the original anyway.<br />
<br />
And of course, like her mother and sister/step-mother, and unlike the original Laura, Sam only have the best interest of mortals populating the world at heart.</p>
