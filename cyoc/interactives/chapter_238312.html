<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">And so it was. You went with an &quot;Easier&quot; job posting as it required minimal effort on your part other than to look around, and it often got new employees use to the thought of a new form before dealing with more exotic ones.<br />
<br />
You shook hands with the recruiter, went to a part of the office for a boring new employee orientation and some boring trainings on a computer. As crazy as it is that you are going to be transformed for this job, nothing could make that part of employee training NOT dry. You finished it up and were taken to a room to be transformed, dropping your belongings off at a locker and leaving you naked. As featureless as it could be, you learned in the training it was part examination chamber with a one way window and cameras, part-containment chamber incase anything went wrong (which according to orientation was very rare), and part training so employees could get use to the new forms for a bit before going to their actual job sites.<br />
<br />
How employees got transformed varied from form to form, in this case something looking like a retro laser gun popped out from a ceiling and &quot;zapped&quot; you for the lack of a better description, making your hairs stand on end. Shortly after, nothing was happening. You got bored after a minute or two until you realized you haven&#39;t moved for a bit. Trying to move did nothing, leaving you stuck in a slightly slouched position. A part of the room&#39;s wall slide open to reveal a mirror and you saw yourself transforming before your eyes.<br />
<br />
Being a mid 20&#39;s man of average looks, you saw yourself transforming to that of a female mannequin. Your skin turned to that of an off-white material of some sort. A plastic? Not that you were an expert on mannequins to know. You shrunk a few inches shorter than your 5&#39;8&quot; starting height. Your body shape became that of a feminine build while your head also changed accordingly. But you weren&#39;t really becoming a woman, as the transformation went on there was plenty of details that you were a mannequin even from a distance.<br />
<br />
Your head was bald, and your eyes, nose, mouth, and ears were lacking details in various ways. You had some make-up baked into your face to help with humanity, but a closer look would show your unmoving eyes, nose being more of a curved-bump with no holes, and lips with a neutral pout and no actual hole between the lips. The ears were even more undetailed bumps then the nose. For all that it felt that you were stuck and unmoving, you were able to somehow move your vision around even if the reflection showed your mannequin&#39;s eyes were completely still. <br />
<br />
Then there was the rest of your body. Your new feminine chest was more like a raised, pyramidal mono-bump. Stuck in your slight slouch pose, you were able to see seams at key parts of your body, although you didn&#39;t have many, looking more like a simple mannequin rather then an intricate one, but still good enough for SOME posing and you figure clothing adjustments. Your male genitals were gone, replaced with...nothing but a smooth area. Your feet were more like one large piece of vaguely feet-shaped plastic, but &quot;luckily&quot; your hands were actually detailed to look fairly normal...if stuck in one pose as they had no seams or indication they could be adjusted. There were other features here and there that helped with the idea you were a mannequin even to a casual observer.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, audio came into a room, one of the workers for the company. Which was weird, even if you went through the orientation, how could you hear? Luckily the technician provided some details on your new form. <br />
<br />
To any thorough examination, you were all intents and purposes a female mannequin. You are hollow and light, and tough outside of purposeful puncture or blunt force. Someone could adjust your body and even disconnect at the seams, although really the only &quot;adjustments&quot; is just circling a part in place.  However, there were obviously things that made you not just a human-shaped piece of plastic.<br />
<br />
You were still fully sentient. You could still hear, see, feel, and smell. The first two were about as normal could be, outside of being unable to blink. &quot;Feel&quot; felt odd and you had little to reference other then you feet on room floor and the air in the room. And although you weren&#39;t breathing, you felt you could smell but that felt off as well with little to go on. The last sense, Taste... well you didn&#39;t have an actual mouth, so you weren&#39;t surprised if it ever came up. The technician said more details of your senses would come up as you got use to the form and went on to the more fantastical aspects.<br />
<br />
Mino Security Solutions truly did want to its employees to feel happy and safe, within reason, and the special parts for your form represented. Although you couldn&#39;t blink, you never actually felt any need to other then a phantom memory. There was a special modification to make you comfortable with being a mannequin, mainly a mental adjust with being okay with staying still and regardless of pose. And as an inanimate object, you had next to no needs. There would be other things to experience as a mannequin, but mainly there were just changes and adjustments to be comfortable with your form, as well as oddly survivable in case violence and destruction happened. It was a guard position after all.<br />
<br />
The technician went on to explain the one thing that was very unique about being transformed into a mannequin: a 6th sense to know when someone was observing you and adjust accordingly. He went to explain it was easier to show than explain, and he said to try moving and specifically for a minute.<br />
<br />
At first you tried but there was a certain wrongness to it, and then after a few minutes, you almost fell over yourself with suddenly being able to move like a mental railing disappearing while leaning against it. After getting your bearings, you just tried moving, with enough sense to eventually do it in front of a mirror. <br />
<br />
A mannequin should not be able to move like that. One might think you were a human in a convincing mannequin costume, but that definitely wasn&#39;t the case. Whatever glossy material you were made of shouldn&#39;t of flexed and bend like that, especially outside of the seams. A costumed person also didn&#39;t make whatever creepy noise you made while moving. Your hands and fingers were able to move intricately. Your feet were still just chunks of plastic when it came down to it but you were able to move fine on them. You could turn your head but your face was still stuck in its neutral pout expression. But it was so off. Thinking to do more testing, you suddenly felt something and &quot;struck a pose&quot;. <br />
<br />
The technician quickly dispelled your momentary panic (although could he really sense ANY emotion from you?) and reminded you of your mannequin sense. The mirror did confirm you somehow struck the same slight-slouch pose you were in earlier. Once again suggesting experience was a better teacher, the Technician did some more looking-away and looking exercises to help you get use to your mannequin sense, and even giving you a marker and board on one of the walls to help you communicate since you couldn&#39;t talk anymore. <br />
<br />
You found out you had a strong sense for the pose a person remembering you in, although you could take other poses depending on context like being almost caught moving, crawling, or leaning against a wall. Basically you would strike often very vogue-ish or fashionable poses. And it was also near impossible to be actually caught moving, although someone could still hear you if you did move in a noisy manner, which you kind of did with the material you made off. But being observed didn&#39;t just apply to the naked eye. This included Cameras, recording equipment, and extremely long distances were you might still blend in. Your mannequin sense would tip you off. Once again, there was more to it but experience would be the best teacher.<br />
<br />
Before finally moving onto your job, you wrote to the technician you wanted to try a touching exercise. Sensing there was no observation, you went to touch yourself in any way. You could feel your fingers and parts rubbing and touching, but it felt odd with the plastic on plastic, and you had a feeling it was also muted somehow. You even knocked on yourself confirming your hollow-ness. The last experiment was to touch your monoboob  and empty vagina area. Now THAT set off some pleasurable sensation and showed you definitely had a sex-drive...somehow.<br />
<br />
Feeling comfortable in your body and also vetted by the technician, you were ready to be taken to the mall to do your duty as guard. You would spend one day in a woman&#39;s clothing store and take note of any suspicious activity during opening and closing hours. Only some MSS employees would know what is going on with you and definitely not any of the mall employees. <br />
<br />
Soon your sense went off, you struck a pose, and an employee picked you up and set you inside a van for transport. You were left a little horny when he held you by your monoboob for leverage. After some uneventfulness (well tipping over and just falling on the floor of the van was quite the event, teaching you that you didn&#39;t really feel pain luckily) and more handling by various people, your found yourself being set up in a...</p>
