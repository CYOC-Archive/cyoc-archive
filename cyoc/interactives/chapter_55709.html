<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So what are you going to do tonight?&quot; Jan asked as she and Rick walked out to their <br />
cars after work.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm going to go out to dinner and a movie,&quot; Rick said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what I meant,&quot; Jan said with a slight shake of her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Rick said chuckling. &quot;I'm not sure what I'll be doing tonight. Maybe I'll make <br />
someone a doll for me or Megan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be interesting,&quot; Jan said looking thoughtful. &quot;I just wish I could control <br />
dreams like you can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I keep telling you to do reality checks throughout the day,&quot; Rick said. &quot;Also when you <br />
go to bed to keep telling yourself that the next thing you see will be a dream. Doing <br />
that will enable you to realize that you're dreaming when you're dreaming.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I did realize that I was dreaming last night but the second I realized it I woke <br />
up,&quot; Jan said looking down with a sad look on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that usually happens at first,&quot; Rick said smiling. &quot;Now you need to realize that <br />
dreams are actually a different world. You've heard that if you die in your dream you <br />
die in reality?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well yes but that isn't true,&quot; Jan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it is true,&quot; Rick said sighing. &quot;Fortunately it's not that easy to die in the dream <br />
world. Do you know why you would die in reality if you die in your dreams?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would guess it has something to do with shock,&quot; Jan said unlocking her car.<br />
<br />
&quot;It would appear that way at first,&quot; Rick said unlocking his car. &quot;However the real <br />
reason is something else entirely. The real reason is that the dream world is a parallel <br />
world. Each of us is linked to a body in the dream world which is sleeping when we're <br />
awake here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then that would mean that when we die here our dream bodies die too,&quot; Jan said <br />
making a leap of logic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you would think that but that's not the case,&quot; Rick said frowning. &quot;Our dream <br />
bodies are much harder to kill than our waking bodies. I could disembowel your dream <br />
body completely and you probably wouldn't die. If your waking body dies then your <br />
consciousness just transfers to your dream body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Jan said with a smile. &quot;Will you make me into a doll for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If that's what you want sure,&quot; Rick said with a shrug. &quot;See you in the dream world <br />
tonight then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right see you tonight,&quot; Jan said waving then driving off.<br />
<br />
A few hours later Rick was getting ready for bed with a smile on his face. It was the <br />
weekend and he didn't have to work for the next two days which meant he could <br />
spend more time as Annabelle. He loved being Annabelle because he felt more <br />
comfortable as her than he did as himself. He ran through what he wanted to do <br />
making sure that he didn't forget anything. With a smile he slid between the sheets <br />
and fell asleep.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Annabelle woke with a smile on her face. Laying next to her was Megan. She spent a <br />
few minutes watching her sleep. She was beautiful with her shoulder length blond hair <br />
and sparkling blue eyes which she couldn't see right now. Annabelle sighed as the <br />
pressure on her bladder increased. If she didn't go to the bathroom soon she would <br />
wet the bed which she didn't want so she got up and headed to the bathroom. After <br />
relieving herself she stripped to get in the shower but stopped to look at her body in <br />
the mirror. Her long brown hair was down to the bottom of her ribs and her blue eyes <br />
sparkled like a gem. She was thirteen so she really didn't have curves as yet and her <br />
breasts were a small A cup and more of a cone shape than a rounded shape. She <br />
didn't mind though as they would develop some more and would round out even if they <br />
stayed as small as they were now. She looked down at her crotch to see a small patch <br />
of pubic hair. She wasn't thin but she wasn't fat either being in-between though a bit <br />
more on the thin side. She turned away from looking at her reflection and got into the <br />
shower. She spent a long time in there enjoying the feeling of the hot water on her <br />
body. It felt so nice after being in her alternate male body for most of the day. She <br />
wasn't the only one who felt more comfortable in a different body than the one most <br />
people saw. Her friend Saber Claw was much more comfortable in his anthro tiger <br />
body than in his human body.<br />
<br />
Annabelle sighed and finally got out of the shower. Wrapping her hair in a towel then a <br />
towel around her body she went back to the bedroom. She looked at Megan again and <br />
smiled. She went to the dresser and pulled out a pair of pink panties and marching <br />
bra, a red tee, and a pair of shorts. She looked at the diapers and was tempted to <br />
regress herself but Megan wouldn't be awake for another hour. There would be <br />
enough time later for them to play around. She got dressed then went to check the <br />
security video and the shield.<br />
<br />
Annabelle was cooking breakfast when she felt arms wrap around her waist and <br />
Megan said, &quot;Mmm Good morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning,&quot; Annabelle said with a smile on her face. &quot;How was school?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh it was ok,&quot; Megan said with a sigh. &quot;Nothing exciting happened except for Claire <br />
kissing me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do?&quot; Annabelle said finishing cooking.<br />
<br />
&quot;I kissed her back,&quot; Megan said laying her head on Annabelle's shoulder. &quot;I'm sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's no need to apologize,&quot; Annabelle said turning around and hugging her. &quot;You <br />
know we can't be together in the waking world for another five years. You deserve to <br />
have a waking relationship during that time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But all I want is you,&quot; Megan said sounding like she was whining.<br />
<br />
&quot;Think about it Megan,&quot; Annabelle said pushing Megan away a little to look into her <br />
eyes. &quot;In the waking world you're a thirteen year old girl while I'm a thirty-six year old <br />
man. You know that society would lock me up if we got together before you turned <br />
eighteen. I know you don't want that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan sighed and looked down saying, &quot;No I don't.&quot; She looked back up with tears in <br />
her eyes and said, &quot;But I love you and I want to be with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are with me though,&quot; Annabelle said with a smile. &quot;It's just in the waking world <br />
that we're apart for a few more years. Here in the dream world though we're together <br />
and that won't change anytime soon. Now let's eat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan nodded then kissed Annabelle with passion. Annabelle suspected that she was <br />
still feeling guilty about kissing another girl. After breakfast they took a walk around the <br />
grounds. The grounds were quite big with rolling hills. They were careful to stay away <br />
from the edges though since they didn't want to fall off and have to fly. While they were <br />
walking they talked about what they were going to do today.</p>
