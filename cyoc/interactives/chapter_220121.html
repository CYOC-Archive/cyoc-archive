<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Early the next morning, Raúl wakes up, the boy stretches and then grins down at his “morningwood”, “THAT was a great dream I had of me and “Mayumi”, hehehe… soon it’ll become reality,” he says to himself, “but first, I have a job to do,” the boy grab his phone from the nightstand and opens the browser. He then puts in “Mansions for sale” into the search engine, “wow, there are a lot of amazing Mansions for sale,” he says, he scrolls through the houses and reads the details, “man, they all look and sound amazing! I think I’ll choose the one closest to me, which is about 30 minutes, the price is two million dollars”.<br />
<br />
The Mansion the boy is looking at is a victorian style Mansion, it looks like a castle with beautiful old brickwork. It has a huge kitchen, which is connected to a large dining room. It also has a indoor and outdoor swimmingpool, a event room, private movie theatre, six bedrooms, which all have their own bathroom.<br />
<br />
Raúl nods, “this is the Mansion, perfect for MY princess, hehe,” he says to himself, the boy then opens the App and after a few minutes, he hears a “crack” and something fall onto his desk. When the boy checks he grins, there on his desk lie the keys to the mansion, “perfect,” he says, “now, time to design the parents, which means: time to pay Yuki Yoshida a visit!”<br />
<br />
Yuki Yoshida, is a 13 year-old boy, he is the child of Japanese immigrants, he has short smooth black hair and an athletic built. The boy has one secret: he is gay! Yuki never told a sole, nor his parents about his sexuality, because he is afraid of being bullied and dishonoured by his parents who absolutely hate gay people.<br />
<br />
Raúl grins to himself as he gets dressed, “Yuki thinks he is smart, but I noticed straight away that he is into boys,” he thinks to himself, “the way he always looks at me or other handsome boys! I am surprised that no one else seems to notice. He looks so miserable, but once I tell him my plan, I think he’ll be really happy,” so before the girls wake up, Raúl sneaks out of the house and makes his way to Yuki’s place, which is 45 minutes from his home.<br />
<br />
Raúl arrives at Yuki’s house and knocks on the door, when the door opens he is greeted by a beautiful Japanese woman, he assumes that it is Yuki’s mother.<br />
<br />
“Yes,” the woman asks, “can I help you?”<br />
<br />
“Good morning, ma’am,” Raúl says politely, “my name is Raúl, I’m a fellow student of Yuki. I’d need to talk to him about an upcoming project. Is he home?”<br />
<br />
“I’ll see if he is already up,” the woman says, “please wait here,” she then closes the door.<br />
<br />
Raúl waits for about five minutes, he then hears footsteps coming towards the door, the door opens and he is greeted by Yuki, who has a confused expression on his face, “hey, Yuki,” Raúl says, smiling.<br />
<br />
“Ra-Raúl,” the boy asks, “wh-what are you doing here?”<br />
<br />
“I’d need to discuss something with you,” Raúl says, “in private,” he gives Yuki a look that says: “I know about your sexuality”.<br />
<br />
“Oh,” the boy blushes a little, “um… okay… c-come in,” he then steps aside and Raúl enters, “f-follow me to my room,” Yuki says and starts heading up the stairs. Soon they walk into the boy’s room, Yuki sits down on the bed and Raúl takes a seat at the boy’s desk, “s-so what exactly do you want to discuss,” Yuki asks, his expression is a mixture of fear and confusion.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, Yuki,” Raúl says, “I am not here to make fun of you or make your life… more difficult. Oh, and in case you think that we… you know… I have to inform you that I am not into boys,” Raúl makes sure that he doesn’t talk to loud, not wanting the boy’s parents ruining his plan.<br />
<br />
Yuki’s eyes widen, “h-how do you know that…,” he cuts himself of.<br />
<br />
“… that you are gay,” Raúl finishes the question, Yuki nods, Raúl grins, “the way you look at me and other handsome boys is more than enough for me to tell”.<br />
<br />
Now Yuki is panicking, “pl-please Raúl,” he says, “please don’t tell anyone!”<br />
<br />
Raúl grins, “I won’t,” he says, “and I won’t need to, because I have an idea that would make you, I believe, really happy”.<br />
<br />
Now Yuki is confused, “hu? What… what idea,” he asks.<br />
<br />
“Hear me out first, then you decide if you want to do it,” Raúl says, Yuki nods, Raúl leans forward and speaks in a quiet tone, “what would you say, if I told you that I have a way of making your life happier. That I am able to take away the fear of being bullied and dishonoured by everyone, what if I told you that I am able to change your life?”<br />
<br />
“I… I’d say, you are weird,” Yuki says, “but IF there is really a way to change my life… I’d do anything to change it!”<br />
<br />
Raúl grins, “let me explain exactly what I have planned,” he says, the boy pulls out his phone, “but first, I need to show you something, something that will make what I’m about to explain sense”.<br />
<br />
Yuki, still confused, watches as Raúl types into his phone, when Raúl is done typing he looks at Yuki, “before I continue,” he says, “promise me to not freak out, or my plan will fail”.<br />
<br />
The 13 year-old tilts his head, he feels so confused, but he can tell that Raúl is being serious, “o-okay… I promise,” he says.<br />
<br />
Raúl smiles, “that is good enough for me,” he says, “now, watch this,” he then taps his phone.<br />
<br />
At first nothing seems to happen, Yuki raises an eyebrow, “are you making fun of me,” he asks, “I don’t see anyth…,” the boy’s eyes suddenly widen as he notices Raúl’s hair change colour and appearance, then his eyes change, becoming slitted, taking on an Asian appearance, his brown eyes become black, his brown skin turns pale and his face changes, matching Yuki’s, soon Yuki is staring at an exact copy of himself.<br />
<br />
“Hi, my name is Yuki Yoshida,” his clone… copy says, grinning.<br />
<br />
“Wh-what the f… hell,” Yuki squeaks, his eyes wide in shock, “Ra-Raúl?”<br />
<br />
His clone nods, “yup,” he grins, “how do I look?”<br />
<br />
“You… you look exactly like me,” Yuki says, “even your voice is exactly like mine! H-how?”<br />
<br />
“Let me explain,” Raúl says, he then explains to Yuki everything about the App.<br />
<br />
Yuki is in disbelief, “if I wouldn’t have witnessed it with my own eyes,” he says, “I’d not have believed it. This App of yours is creepy, but I guess you are about to tell me the reason you have come”.<br />
<br />
Raùl nods, “I noticed how depressed you have become, because of what you are,” he says, “so, I want to make you an offer, and it is up to you if you want to do it, because, if you accept, there will be no turning back”.<br />
<br />
“O-okay,” Yuki says, “tell me”.<br />
<br />
“First let me tell you a little back story,” Raúl says and then tells Yuki everything about “Mayumi” and what his plan is, “so, you see, I’d use the App to transform you into “Mayumi’s” new mom, then I’d transform the boy you are most interested in into your “husband” and “father” of “Mayumi”. You wouldn’t need to hide that you are into boys any longer, because you’ll be a straight woman”.<br />
<br />
After Raúl has finished Yuki takes a while to let everything sink in, “so,” he then says, “you met this “girl”, unaware that she is actually a transformed teenage boy, and discovered the truth when you scanned “her” with that App of yours. But instead of leaving her… HIM alone, you decided to mess up his life, by making him your girlfriend. In order to keep “her” as she is, you decided to design a fake life for her and you want me to be her mother”.<br />
<br />
“That pretty much sums it up,” Raúl, who by now has transformed back to his old self.<br />
<br />
“What… what will you change about me, apart from turning me into a woman,” Yuki asks.<br />
<br />
“I will not change anything, I will leave your mind intact, so that you will always remember who you were, but I’d add memories of your new life, in order for you to stay in character”.<br />
<br />
Yuki thinks it over, “okay… I’ll do it,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Seriously,” Raúl asks.<br />
<br />
Yuki nods, “yes, my life now is hell, and to be honest, I will NOT miss my parents, they are just full of hate and just… evil people,” he says, “imagining being freed of them and having this designed life instead, just makes me feel happy. I will miss being a kid, but… I’d have a job, someone who loves me, a “daughter” who loves me and just being able to decide about my life on my own!”<br />
<br />
Raúl smiles, “then, let’s do this,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Wait,” Yuki says, he gets to his feet and slowly walks over to Raúl and stops in front of him, he then suddenly hugs Raúl, starting to sob, “th-thank you… thank you so, so much!”<br />
<br />
Raúl is taken aback, but then he smiles, hugging the boy back, “my pleasure, Yuki,” he says, they then stop hugging and Yuki wipes away his tears, “now, are you ready to start your new life?”<br />
<br />
“I am,” the boy says, smiling.<br />
<br />
Raúl nods, he then opens the App and scans Yuki, he then opens the boy’s file and starts to edit. After a few minutes he looks at Yuki, “ready,” he asks.<br />
<br />
Yuki nods, he then takes a deep breath, “yes…,” and Raúl confirms the changes.<br />
<br />
The 13 year-old suddenly feels a tingle run through his body, causing him to shiver, “that felt weird,” he says, he then starts to feel himself growing and becoming older, “THIS feels even weirder,” he groans as his bones and joints pop and crack, but it is not painful. Next thing the boy notices, is his penis and balls retreat back into his body, causing him to let out a moan, “f-fuck, feels good,” he says, he then feels his empty sack become his pussy, which causes the changing boy to smile, “I won’t miss it, a penis is so effing annoyiing anyway,” he says. As the boy grows, his clothes grow with him, the boy’s hair starts to lengthen until it reaches just below his shoulder blades, his chest puffs out, forming two large and beautiful C-cups, “man… these girls are huge,” he, now she, says. Her hips widen as her butt becomes round and firm, giving her a beautiful hourglass figure. The “woman’s” face takes on a softer and more feminine appearance, finally her clothes change to fit her new gender, becoming a nice blue Kimono dress. The woman feels her brain tingle as new memories and information flood into her mind. Suddenly the room around her and Raúl seems to fade and soon the woman finds herself in a totally different room, which looks like a master bedroom, then she hears a ping sound coming from Raúl’s phone. Yuki turns to look at Raúl, who is grinning up at the now 30 year-old woman, who a few moments ago had been a 13 year-old boy.<br />
<br />
“How are you feeling, Yuki,” Raúl asks.<br />
<br />
“Is… is it over,” the woman asks.<br />
<br />
“Yep,” Raúl says, “your new life has now officially started”.<br />
<br />
Yuki smiles, “amazing,” she says, “and, to answer your question: I feel fantastic! I mean, I still got to get used to being a grown woman, wife and mother, but I can’t be any more happier!”<br />
<br />
Raúl smiles, “I am glad to hear that,” he says, “by the way: you look amazing!”<br />
<br />
“Really,” Yuki asks, “can I see myself?”<br />
<br />
Raúl points behind Yuki, “behind you is a full length mirror”.<br />
<br />
When the woman turns around she lets out a gasp, “is… is that really me? I look like a model!”<br />
<br />
Raúl chuckles, “I take it you love your new appearance?”<br />
<br />
“Yes,” Yuki says, turning around to look at her new body from every angle, “I turned out great!”<br />
<br />
“Now, all we need is to find you a husband,” Raúl says, “do you have any boy in mind who’d be perfect for that role?”<br />
<br />
Yuki thinks for a while, “hm… yes,” she says, “there is this handsome 12 year-old kid called Jared Kingston, he’d make a fine husband! By the way… where are we?”<br />
<br />
“Okay, Jared it will be,” Raúl says, “and we are in YOUR house!”<br />
<br />
Yuki’s eyes widen, “what do you mean… my house?”<br />
<br />
Raúl grins, “I used the App to “buy” a Mansion for the new family,” he says.<br />
<br />
“A MANSION,” Yuki shouts, “b-but how am I going to afford the bills?”<br />
<br />
Raúl chuckles, “trust me, Yuki,” he says, “I have everything planned out. Let me show you around your new home and I’ll explain everything while we go”.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” the woman says, she then grins, “oh, by the way… YOUNG man. You should show more respect when talking to a grown up… I’m MISS Miyamoto to you!”<br />
<br />
Raúl smirks, “I see you are already adapting to your new life really well, Yu… I mean miss Miyamoto”.<br />
<br />
Yuki chuckles, “that I am,” she says, “that was a joke, you, of course, may still refer to me as “Yuki”, since you are the one who gave me this gift! I can’t thank you enough!”<br />
<br />
Raúl smiles, “the only thing I want is YOUR blessing to be YOUR “daughter’s” boyfriend,” he says.<br />
<br />
Yuki smiles, “of course you have my blessing,” she says, “messing with someone else’s life is actually cruel… but… it is a lot of fun,” she then says, grinning.<br />
<br />
Raúl grins back, “and the only people who’ll know the truth are you and me!”<br />
<br />
“I promise, my mouth is sealed,” Yuki says, “under one condition: that you and me continue to have lots of fun with that App of yours”.<br />
<br />
“OR you could get your own App,” Raúl says, “then you won’t have to rely on me to be around and have your own fun!”<br />
<br />
“Actually… that is a good idea,” Yuki says, “but… do I have a phone?”<br />
<br />
Raúl nods, “yes, you do,” he says, “it is in your handbag, which is always hanging by the front door. You also don’t have to worry about clothes, food and everything else. Everything has been taken care of”.<br />
<br />
“Wow,” Yuki says, “you really want “Mayumi” THAT bad, hm?”<br />
<br />
“Hehe… yep,” the boy says, “I don’t want anyone else! Now, let’s do the tour, I got to get to work on Jared soon”.<br />
<br />
After touring the house, Yuki and Raúl are standing in the entrance hall of the Mansion, “so, Yuki” Raúl says, “what do you think?”<br />
<br />
“I… I don’t know what to say… other than: thank you… for everything,” the woman says, tears of happiness in her eyes and a smile on her face, “I for always be thankful to you, Raúl!”<br />
<br />
Raúl smiles, “and I will always be there for you, Yuki,” he says, “now, before I go, let me show you what is in your handbag”. The boy walks to the front door where a large pink handbag is hanging on a hook. Raúl take the handbag and opens it, he pulls out a purse and hands it to Yuki, “that is your purse,” he says, “inside you find credit cards, your new ID, your driver’s license, some cash, make up, a phone which has not only got the number of “Mayumi” in the contacts, but also mine, and when I have transformed Jared into your husband HIS number will automatically appear in your contacts”.<br />
<br />
Yuki nods and beams, “amazing,” she says, “just out of curiosity… how wealthy have you made my family?”<br />
<br />
Raúl grins, “oh… you are billionairs!”<br />
<br />
“WHAT,” Yuki shouts, her eyes wide, “you are crazy!”<br />
<br />
Raúl grins, “hehe, well… you do need to pay all the bills, so I figured, making you high society should help!”<br />
<br />
Yuki shakes her head and giggles, “you really are one of a kind, Raúl,” she says.<br />
<br />
“Hehe… I am just glad that a rich family “allows” a not rich kid to date their “daughter”,” Raúl chuckles.<br />
<br />
Yuki grins, “why would my soon-to-be husband and I, have anything against such a good, polite and well behaved boy dating our daughter,” she asks, winking at Raúl.<br />
<br />
Raúl grins, “one finally thing,” he says, he reaches into his pockets and pulls out some keys, “her are the keys to your new life, Yuki”.<br />
<br />
Yuki takes the keys with a shaky hand, a huge smile on her face, “I still can NOT believe it,” she says, “I hope this is not just some weird dream”.<br />
<br />
“Trust me, Yuki,” Raúl says, “when you wake up tomorrow you will find that this is as real as it can get!”<br />
<br />
Yuki smiles, “thanks so much,” she says, “now, get out and make sure that my HUSBAND isn’t late for dinner,” she then says with a wink.<br />
<br />
Raúl grins, “yes, ma’am,” he says, he opens the front door, “I’ll see you soon, Yuki,” he says.<br />
<br />
“See you soon, Raúl,” the woman says, she then closes the door and lets out a sigh, she then turns around, grinning as she looks around the huge entrance hall, “I think, after this intense life change, I could do with a little relaxation in the pool! Or I could use the time to examine myself… closer,” the woman grins to herself.</p>
