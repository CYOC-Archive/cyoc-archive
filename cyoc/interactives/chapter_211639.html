<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake found a very embarrassing photo where he and her mother was. This was taken year ago when they visited a theme park and his mom insisted that they should take a photo together. Well instead of her mother in the picture was her sister. He was sure about it since the motherly like person in the picture wore same shirt as her 7-year-old sister wears all the time. Which means that her &#39;mother&#39; is in upstairs doing something.<br />
<br />
Jake made an audible swallow as he tiptoed to her sister&#39;s room to witness her lying on her stomach. The room belong her younger sister, that&#39;s for sure, but had something off-putting about it. It was if it was mix between her sister&#39;s old room with more adult theme.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hi Jake.&quot; Lizzy waved her hand and smiled innocently as she peaked behind her back.<br />
<br />
Her sister&#39;s voice was much deeper than what she was used to and lacked the sterns voice what her mother would have. As Jake approached further to the room he saw that Lizzy was working on figurines and painting them with a paint brush.<br />
<br />
&quot;o-ho-hoo... Finally interested in your dear mother&#39;s fine arts?&quot; Lizzy laughed like she was quoting something obscure show. <br />
<br />
As she rose from the floor and place the half-way finished model to the table you could see her white blouse was covered in sweat. Jake could see Lizzy&#39;s breasts and nipples as the sweat had made the shirt more transparent. Lizzy didn&#39;t seem to care and walked past Jake to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Jake couldn&#39;t comprehend what to say about of this situation since her mother wouldn&#39;t do anyting like this at all. It was if she was acting like her sister, but more &#39;mature&#39; in a sense. Lizzy poke&#39;d her head from the bathroom door and asked if Jake wanted to come take a bath with her mom. His instinct said yes, but at the same time he felt that something bad was going to happen next.<br />
<br />
&quot;hi there sweety...&quot; Lizzy said with a baritonal voice and lower herself to Jake&#39;s eyelevel. &quot;I couldn&#39;t help but notice that you had your eyes on &#39;these&#39; as I walked past you. Care to explain why so..?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake immediatly became flustered. What was this feeling.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can see that your face is turning red. Do you find me...? Appealing..? Someone you can&#39;t take your eyes off?&quot; Lizzy teased and took down her jeans leaving only damped panties and the blouse which was revealing a lot of cleavage.<br />
<br />
&quot;I- Mom- What are you.&quot; Jake&#39;s mind paused as she called Lizzy as her mom without thinking. Was their relationship like this or what was happening. This had to be a bad dream. &quot;How about Luke? Where&#39;s Luke?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your brother?&quot; Lizzy smiled and took her blouse off. &quot;He&#39;s at work. But in the mean time we should...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sudden the front door&#39;s bell rung and Lizzy quickly run back to her room in panic. Jake still mentally frozen thinking what was happening with her sister. She looked older, she acted very upfront and was acted strange around him.<br />
<br />
Then as her mother quickly rushed downstairs Jake sprinted to his room to see what was going on. As he close his room&#39;s door he felt something. A warming sensation all over his body, as if he had a fever but not quite. Jake&#39;s legs suddenly gave everything under him and he tumbled down the floor next to his full body mirror. Then he saw the reason why her sister was so pushy with him all of a sudden.<br />
<br />
Jake was older.<br />
<br />
There was stubble all over his face like something a man in razor commercial would have after a shave. Jake&#39;s thinking was also much more mature, expressive and sexual. As he tried her best to raise up he could feel her legs tingling with warmth. As if someone was pulling him. Jake&#39;s clothes grew with him and body hair begun to grow in places where there wasn&#39;t none. Jake could only watch himself in awe as he witnessed his armpit hair growing and beard getting somewhat lenghtier.<br />
<br />
Then in her crotch something weird was happening. It was also growing hair. As the pubic hair grew his small pinkie finger sized penis grew into a thick beiny sausage like object. Jake could only watch in awe as his whole body looked as old or maybe older but not as older as his sister was.<br />
<br />
Jake heard someone knocking on his door.<br />
<br />
It was Lizzy looking a little bit distressed as you invited her to the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jake. Dear... Mommy just wanted to say that whatever happened just moment ago was, inappropiate, by mom.&quot; Lizzy said with very comtemplated tone and kept avoid eye contact with Jake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, do you find me appealing?&quot; Jake said as if to raise the flame once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;...&quot;<br />
<br />
Lizzy couldn&#39;t reply anything, but took a lenghty look at Jake. In Jake&#39;s face there was new determination. A new insightful understanding what was happening to him and Lizzy.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s my birthday tomorrow and I have something to say to you.&quot; Jake said with the confidence.<br />
<br />
Lizzy carefully walked inside and carefully closed the door while keeping an eye contact with Jake. Jake patted her bed and suggesting that she should come sit next to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, you know that I find you as appealing as you find me, you know. We have lived in this house for 18 years without father. Or you have and I&#39;ve been along with you. I NOW understand the feeling you let out when you saw me looking you like that.&quot; Jake explained as her mother sat next to him on the bed. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s that restricted feeling of the forbidden fruit that you can only pluck out of the tree once.&quot; Jake kept explaning. &quot;You see, I too now see that I could share that experience with you. You want to taste that fruit with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake had gained all the memories of this new life. In the instant he grew up. He was almost 18-years-old man. Living with her mother and his brother together. In his memories Luke was 31-year-old salaryman who still often came home to say hi to his family. Jake knew what he was. He was his brother&#39;s and sister&#39;s son. That was the reason why Lizzy was that pushy with him. She felt that itch she hadn&#39;t got in a long time. That trembling mix of fear and excitement like it was a rollercoaster of emotions.<br />
<br />
Both had an intence stares with each other, but in the end ...</p>
