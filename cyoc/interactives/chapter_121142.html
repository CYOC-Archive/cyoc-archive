<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was sort of air of silence as things at the hospital quieted down. James Harper Sr. and Elisabeth Harper went with the EMTs in the ambulance to the hospital while Samantha and Frances drove James Harper Junior and his younger siblings and the Jenkins drove Jenny and Harry after them. In many ways the second wedding hadn&#39;t gone quite as had been expected, but in many ways it had gone about as well as could be expected.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay?&quot; William asked to a young woman he&#39;d identified as Jenny&#39;s maid of honor, who was presently standing close to a young who practically towered over her, but held her quite gently.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m okay,&quot; Karen spoke, &quot;though... I&#39;m not sure on how to feel about this. I mean... the guy clearly wasn&#39;t nice and on some level probably deserved what he got... but I don&#39;t think even Jenny wanted him to die.&quot;<br />
<br />
William nodded at that. The confrontation had been explosive, and the yelling back and forth did attract the attention of everyone there. And while a truly physical fight was expected, it never came, but the fact that James Harper Sr. collapsed at the tipping point was something that put an end to it. William privately agreed that James Senior&#39;s death wasn&#39;t wanted by anyone, but from what he saw, that was a distinct possibility.<br />
<br />
&quot;He probably deserved it though,&quot; Peter Talbot spoke from behind Karen, &quot;trying to mess with his own daughter in such away... though, thankfully things worked out to be safe enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Karen nodded, &quot;and Jenny is with the man she loves and that Wilhelm guy can rot in a dungeon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jail, not dungeon,&quot; Peter chuckled.<br />
<br />
There were a few chuckles at the exchange, but from there, William nodded and began to head out. With the second wedding over and nothing more that he could do, he figured to head home and let Martha know all that had happened. The walk was quiet and in that, it allowed William the freedom to smell the fall air and even noting the change of colors in the leaves on the trees that grew within Moon Lake&#39;s city limits. In that it was relatively peaceful and one could almost forget that the town had just made it through a major &quot;scare&quot; over the Jenkins/Harper wedding. The only things that seemed to remind him of that were the jack-o-lanterns and &quot;spooky decals&quot; that made it clear that it was Halloween and that that the normal night&#39;s activities of trick or treating would come. But, with the worst of things passed, William continued on and actually tried to enjoy the quiet walk back to the Anderson home.<br />
<br />
He arrived to find that Alex and Ben were both still there and that the whole group was seated in the living room. Though, it was also clear that there was a lot of worrying that had gone on as he found that Ben was leaning forward on the couch, his elbows digging into his thighs as he held up his head seemed to be either looking off into space or to the floor. Martha was seated beside Ben with one arm wrapped around Ben&#39;s shoulders and her other hand resting on the shoulder Ben had the closest to her. Clearly, she&#39;d been comforting him. Nate was seated on the other side of Martha and was looking more toward Ben while Alex was seated in one of the dinning room chairs and was sitting opposite Ben. Eric didn&#39;t appear to be there, but then, he likely went with the Stovalls.<br />
<br />
William&#39;s return soon prompted a response from those present as everyone looked up. Martha even stood up and the two hugged shortly after he entered the living room, making his inner fox feel quite happy to have her arms around him. However, they couldn&#39;t go any further as William knew there were some other issues to take care of as well. Namely filling in the others on what happened, particularly Ben.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s good you&#39;re home,&quot; Martha said to William giving him a small kiss on the cheek, &quot;did things go okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d imagine things went about as well as could be expected,&quot; William answered, &quot;and not without the proverbial fireworks. Let me get another chair and relay everything that happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
He quickly moved back and collected another chair and then returned to the living room. As William set the chair down, he noted again that Ben&#39;s eyes were focused on him, clearly worried about Samantha and Frances. Ben soon confirmed William&#39;s suspicions when he spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;How are my moms?&quot; Ben asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re both fine,&quot; William assured him, &quot;there were the proverbial fireworks, but thankfully the worst fears of real violence was avoided...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank heavens,&quot; Martha gave a sigh of relief and Ben also looked a bit more comfortable with that.<br />
<br />
&quot;The metal detector detected the guns that both Dieter Wilhelm and his henchman were carrying and were confronted by Tachibana&#39;s security personnel and the police as soon as they came in the front door. They were arrested and were soon carted off,&quot; William continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Nate commented with a frown, though more evident of his dislike of what he&#39;d been told about Dieter Wilhelm that what might be thought after hearing William&#39;s comment.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about the Harpers?&quot; Alex wondered curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;That followed shortly after,&quot; William answered, &quot;Jenny&#39;s father in trying to defend Dieter was soon arguing with the minister and the police as they went through their standard procedure... and from there things went off... metaphorically speaking. Jenny&#39;s older brother began to argue with his father, either in defense of the minister or in defense of Jenny... or both. And it came off like he&#39;d had a LOT of frustration with his father over the years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;From what you&#39;ve told me about him,&quot; Nate cut in, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t be surprised.&quot;<br />
<br />
William nodded to his eldest son but then cautioned, &quot;maybe, but remember that a LOT of what your mom and I know... we know second hand, at least with regard to Jenny&#39;s siblings.&quot;<br />
<br />
There were nods from the others and they listened intently to hear about what would happen next.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, the argument raised a racket and drew many of us in the sanctuary out, along with many of the werelions that had been asked to provide help,&quot; William continued, &quot;they formed a sort of &quot;wall&quot; to keep the Harpers from charging into the sanctuary to get at Harry if it came to that, but the focus of the confrontation remained between the father and oldest son. Eventually, James Harper Sr. actually made a move to strike his son when Jenny came up from behind him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He didn&#39;t...?&quot; Ben began to ask, feeling a lump form in his throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d guess that James Sr. wanted to strike her, but between both Jenny and her brother arguing with him, he looked a bit torn to me,&quot; William asked, &quot;and in the ensuing argument and seeming threats... Harry couldn&#39;t take it and moved from the alter and past the werelions to further restrain Jenny&#39;s father from striking at Jenny...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened next?&quot; Martha asked when William paused and didn&#39;t immediately continue, &quot;was there a fight? Is Jenny okay? Was she able to recue her younger siblings?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s pretty much about the end of what happened in the church,&quot; William answered, &quot;the only big thing is that James Harper couldn&#39;t take all the stress and actually had a heart attack. He collapsed to the floor... and was rushed to the hospital. The Jenkins, and your moms, Ben, went with the Harpers to the hospital where I&#39;d assume that they&#39;ll be settling matters there. Hopefully things work out okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And my moms are okay?&quot; Ben asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, they were fine when they took Jenny&#39;s siblings to the hospital,&quot; William assured him, &quot;and I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be back soon...&quot;<br />
<br />
William watched Ben&#39;s chest swell as the young werewolf took a deep breath in and then let that air out. To William, Ben looked a bit better as he&#39;d gotten assurances that no harm had come to Samantha or Frances, though he also figured that for the moment there would still be some concern that wouldn&#39;t be solved until mothers and son could be reunited. However, with the news that everyone was okay, William felt they had made good progress.</p>
