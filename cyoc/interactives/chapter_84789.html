<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The cries of &quot;rah&quot; echoed through the cabin and came from the cabin&#39;s second floor. It started with one and then shortly after a second joined the first. Jenny watched as both George and Molly turned one ear toward the cries coming from their two infants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did we wake them?&quot; Jenny asked slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think so,&quot; Molly gave a soft smile, &quot;They&#39;re in that stage of life where most of what they do is sleep and when they&#39;re awake... they either want to be fed, changed, or cuddled.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny watched as Molly slid her chair back and stood up. Both tiger-people demonstrated many of the aspects of raw power that existed in all big cats. They were likely taller than a normal tiger would be if one stood it up on its hind legs, but based on what Clemens had told her, that was likely to allow for a more humanoid muscle design and grouping, as mundane quadrupedal animals, while they had the same muscles, the specific way they were arranged would not enable them to stand on two legs. The Animatrix Serum then altered muscle groupings and bones to allow for it, and thus lead to some differences between Animal People based on certain larger animal species and what would be the dimensions of the mundane animal. Animal people who were based on smaller animals probably had the same changes, but their sizes were still closer to their size as humans and their larger than the mundane animal was also due to the fact while the Animatrix Serum could change a lot, it could not shrink anyone down. And even with all these changes, George and Molly were powerfully built and would probably outpace any body builder with regard to strength.<br />
<br />
Their physical size was also something that Jenny was still in awe that. Their greenish-gold eyes were massive in size. While both George and Molly had behaved politely, Jenny was also fairly certain that if someone saw an eye that big in the dark of night and didn&#39;t expect it they would be startled out of their wits. Thankfully, George and Molly were polite and friendly. Some of it was a great surprise given the nonsense that was going around that Clemens had told her of.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll go see what it is they want,&quot; Molly commented, &quot;and will be back shortly.&quot;<br />
<br />
She then made her way toward the stairs when George called after her.<br />
<br />
&quot;If they don&#39;t decide to go straight to sleep... bring them down,&quot; George called, &quot;I would guess that part of the visit was to see them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe partly,&quot; Clemens corrected, &quot;but mossstly we are here to meet with friendssss.&quot;<br />
<br />
George nodded, &quot;and thankfully under pleasant circumstances.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joseph and Clemens both nodded to that. Joseph knowing that with the racist nonsense that had been started by Beauregard now over, George&#39;s overprotective nature of Molly would not be as so heavily tested as before. It was probably that that made him appear so aggressive to Joseph when they first met, and Joseph was certain that it was a flaw in George&#39;s character, even if made with noble intentions. But, things were calm now and George had no explicit reason to be so aggressively.<br />
<br />
&quot;We saw the Animal Tales episode you were in,&quot; George commented after a moment, &quot;It looked good... though to be curious... have you and Jenny come to any agreement or...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;On whether or not I&#39;d get my own set of scales?&quot; Jenny asked, &quot;No, we haven&#39;t gotten that far yet... it&#39;s still a permanent change and Clemens does have contingencies in case there are to be &quot;little&quot; Pattens but not a family of reptiles...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;re being careful,&quot; Joseph commented, &quot;not a bad decision... especially with the potential for odd behavior. Either some old hatred from others like Beauregard or some other group that isn&#39;t necessarily anti-Animal Person but isn&#39;t above using an Animal Person for things they wouldn&#39;t want...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone would do that?&quot; Clemens asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is possible,&quot; Joseph told him, and sipped from the glass of water that George and Molly had offered him, &quot;but for the moment, we can hope that things remain positive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure they will,&quot; Jenny commented, &quot;most of the more negative responses came out of fear and thinking you&#39;re all enslaved to instinct and now that the fact that Animal People aren&#39;t enslaved to their instincts... Clemens doesn&#39;t lay in ambush and crush small pets or deer in his coils when he becomes hungry... you haven&#39;t taken to patrolling large sections of Columbia Falls and clawed trees and eaten whatever tries to counter you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yesss,&quot; Clemens agreed, &quot;Insssstincct issssss there, but doess not control ussss.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So how long were the film crews with you?&quot; George asked curiously, &quot;My partner and I were filmed for a program called &quot;Frontier Force,&quot; which is sort of like the show &quot;Cops.&quot; They actually stayed with us about a week to get all the film they needed to put together the episode...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think one of my coworkers saw that,&quot; Jenny commented, &quot;Said the best part was you chasing a deer out of a convenience store or gas station...&quot;<br />
<br />
George actually laughed at the memory, &quot;That was the only real &quot;excitement&quot; that went on during that week... and it was excitement I preferred to others.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The inssane animal lover?&quot; Clemens asked, &quot;I ssssaw the newsssssss report on that... ssssuch a dissgracce.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And nearly killed me,&quot; George admitted, &quot;thus why dealing with a mundane animal was preferable.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny nodded, but looking at George in person was somewhat surprised by he said. The news had showed a large naked American Bison person being pulled into a trailer, but seeing George in front of her, even if he had changed out of his uniform in a hurry, it seemed odd to see George that close to death.<br />
<br />
&quot;Forgive me, but wouldn&#39;t you be strong enough to kill something as big as a bison?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but even with it... I would have needed surprise to be on my side,&quot; George explained, &quot;I didn&#39;t have that in Glacier... and even if I did... as an officer of the law... my mission is predominantly to see justice served. Not to kill enemies. In the end Washerman forced things to where he had to be killed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good that thingss got better then,&quot; Clemens agreed, &quot;and to anssswer your quesssstion... the film crewsss were with usssss about three or four dayssss.&quot; <br />
<br />
It was then that they heard Molly&#39;s footsteps returning. The cries of &quot;rah&quot; had ended while they discussed things, but the sound of Molly&#39;s pawed feet on the wood did carry down to them as she came down the stairs. Both Jenny and Clemens turned and looked to see Molly return, and in her arms were the two young cubs. At first Jenny thought they were asleep since their eyes were shut, but occasionally she saw little foot or hand kick or move about. She also saw a little orange and black tail twitch beneath Molly&#39;s arms. They were the cutest things that Jenny had seen with them looking like little orange and black balls of fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are they asleep?&quot; Jenny asked half curiously.<br />
<br />
Jenny&#39;s answer came when the cub in Molly&#39;s right army moved one ear, lifted its head for a moment and then let it fall back against Molly&#39;s arm and gave a short cry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rah?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Molly answered, again with a warm motherly smile as she looked down to Machli and Michael in her arms, &quot;but by human standards I gave birth three months early. These two are still quite healthy and are developing fine... but by human standards they are not fully mature. Their eyes are shut right now because their eyes haven&#39;t fully developed yet and they need to be shut to protect them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shouldn&#39;t they be in the hospital then?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are taking them to see pediatrician that specializes in working with infants in Kalispell,&quot; George answered, &quot;and the bill of health on them is healthy. They&#39;re premature by human standards... but by a tiger&#39;s standards...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They are right on time,&quot; Clemens finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;So long as we take them to their appointments and keep them safe and warm, they&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;George and I will have to wait to see their eyes... but they will open in time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which issss Maccchli and which isss Michael?&quot; Clemens inquired.<br />
<br />
Molly then slowly made her way around George and came towards Jenny to give her a closer look at the two cubs. Clemens leaned forward to look more closely and gently took Jenny&#39;s hand in his own.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Machli,&quot; Molly moved one cub which was &quot;chewing&quot; on the sleeve of Molly&#39;s dress.<br />
<br />
Clemens noticed the marking above the little cub&#39;s eyes. As with all tigers, there was a patch of white fur that came up the cub&#39;s closed eyes and created a half-circle above its eyebrows. And with all tigers, little Machli&#39;s marking was different from her mother&#39;s, her fathers, and her brothers. George had an equilateral triangle pointed downward above his eyes, Molly had what looked like the letter &quot;v&quot; above her eyes, and this little cub, Machli, had what looked like three dashes above her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sshe appearssss to like your dresss,&quot; Clemens chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know where she picked that up,&quot; Molly shook her head, &quot;She has been fed, and even if she is hungry, there is no milk in my arm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She does look precious, though,&quot; Jenny commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Molly smiled and then held forward the other cub, who took a foot to his little hip from Machli as she squirmed a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rah! Rah!&quot; Michael protested.<br />
<br />
Molly pulled them apart a little bit, and brought Michael forward again. The little male had what looked like a check mark above his eyes. It was similar to Molly&#39;s &quot;v&quot; marking but different in that the edge going up and away from the eye and toward his ears was longer than the part that went toward the eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Michael,&quot; Molly finished the introduction.<br />
<br />
&quot;They are darling children, you musssst be proud,&quot; Clemens gave a smile as he had noticed a &quot;brightness&quot; in both George and Molly as part of the introductions. Molly with her smiles and looking down to Machli and Michael. George also smiled and noticed that his eyes and smile also followed the two infants. <br />
<br />
&quot;We are,&quot; George gave a nod.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you like to hold them?&quot; Molly then asked.</p>
