<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;What? No! You&#39;re crazy! I&#39;m not staying!&quot; shouted James. &quot;You old hags are crazy! So give me back the money I paid you and let me walk out or else I&#39;ll set the cops on you!&quot;<br />
Alas, that threat had absolutely no effect whatsoever on the three old women.<br />
&quot;Calm down, you&#39;re our tenant now and you&#39;ve paid for six months already,&quot; said Matilda.<br />
&quot;Yes, why don&#39;t you have dinner with us?&quot; Gilda added while patting the chair of the large table in the dining-room.<br />
&quot;In your dreams, you evil bitches,&quot; growled James. &quot;Now move over or I&#39;ll be forced to move you aside myself!&quot;<br />
&quot;My, my, what a temperamental boy,&quot; tutted Hilda with a smile. &quot;I am sure we can change your mind, though. You might be a tad more amiable after a bit of food in your belly.&quot; <br />
&quot;Like hell!&quot; shouted James, but it was too late.<br />
Hilda snapped her fingers and one of the large chairs at the table moved, effectively coming to life. James stare wide-eyed as it approached like a great giant insect. No! It couldn&#39;t be real! But it was! These women were therefore really witches! The chair slumberingly move of its own accord, approaching his body frozen in fear, slipping under him, knocking his knees from behind. James was forced to sit in it but then the intricate wood decorations of the arms also came alive and wrapped themselves tightly around his wrists. He was attached to the chair! Held prisoner! And is ankles became seemingly wrapped too! He was stuck! He screamed as the chair hobbled with him on board to the table and as the three witches cackled in pure delight and joy. Hilda pinched his cheek instructing him to keep quiet and be good while they set the table and fixed the food. They were going to have soup so she hoped he&#39;d like it! With another snap of her fingers, a cloth napkin wrapped itself securely around James&#39; mouth, preventing him from swearing while everything was made ready. At three and with magic, things did go fast! Gilda watched the pot, Hilda set the vegetables and chicken to be chopped and Matilda set the table. A guest! How exciting! And such a cute one too! <br />
 However, Matilda was soon done. Setting the plates, glasses, cutlery and other table things by magic was rapid and no work at all. The broth was still being prepared so she decided to have a bit of fun with James. Just a bit of innocent fun. She diapered from his field of vision and crawled under the table. There, she removed James&#39; shoes and socks. The young man squirmed and protested but but with the gag, he couldn’t utter any comprehensible words. For all intents and purposes, it just looked like he was searing again. As for Matilda, she chuckled evilly at the sight of James&#39; bare feet. They were big feet but for her fun time, it was perfect! James was grunting, wondering what one of the witch was doing with his shoes and socks but the answer became clear quite fast. Matilda grabbed each toe and sang the nursery rhyme &quot;Ten Little Piggies Went To Market&quot; gently pulling and stroking each. James giggled but that wasn&#39;t enough. She then tickled him in earnest, first brushing her nails along his long arch then poking the balls of his feet, finishing with wriggles of her fingers under his toes, which the poor James had no chance of escaping. After all, he could try to pull his feet away, they were attached and were not going to move anywhere out of the reach of the witch. Matilda twirled and probed her nails all across her victim&#39;s feet and the results were immediate, especially with the poking in the crook of the foot arch and the light scratchings of her fingernail s under his toes. He giggled and squirmed like mad! His words were muffled but obviously he begged for the tickling to stop. Matilda merely continued adding babyish &quot;coochie coochie coos&#39; and asking if he was ticklish or how ticklish he was, calling him a little boy. James could just laugh and squirm and wriggle, incapable of escaping this torture. <br />
<br />
In the kitchen, the soup was getting well under way. While Gilda stirred assiduously, Hilda put back all the ingredients. Well, she did that, but she was also surreptitiously doing something else. Discreetly, she was mingling and dosing ingredients and whispering incantations over a phial, creating her own little transformation potion. As Gilda finished stirring the broth, Hilda carried the large pot on the table, glowing inside. She ladled out the steaming, savoury broth, seeing what entertainment Matilda was up to. Actually, it was perfect! No one would notice what she was about to do. Hilda slipped the made portion into James&#39; bowl of soup. Whatever her sisters had in mind for their young male guest, the idea in her mind was better. She smiled inwardly but also beamed at James as she set the plate of broth in front of him.<br />
&quot;Comfortable, young man?&quot; she asked sweetly.<br />
&quot;Ticklish! He&#39;s a ticklish one, this one!&quot; laughed Matilda under the table.<br />
&quot;Well, get up from under the table and sit down to eat,&quot; said Gilda as she entered the dining-room. &quot;We’re about to get started.&quot;<br />
Matilda obeyed and James&#39; gag was removed as the three witches sat down to eat. James was quite the breathless mess by now. And of course he was still tied to his large wooden chair. Gilda, having finished her bowl first, took his spoon and attempted feeding him in that fashion. James twisted his face this way and that, clamping his jaw shut. Not only he refused to be fed like a baby, but he did not wish to taste those witches&#39; food! Gilda tutted but her sister was more practical. Matilda rose from her seat and tickled James under the arms.<br />
&quot;Is the little baby ticklish there too?&quot; she asked teasingly.<br />
James could not resist laughing and Hilda poured the spoonful down his throat. James sputtered and coughed but the broth had gone down to his stomach. It was quite tasty, really, but he was not ready to admit that. He closed his mouth shut again and glared at the sisters. Hilda knew there was another way to go about this task. She waved her hands in front of the youngster&#39;s eyes and muttered a few words of magic. Immediately James&#39; face broke into a wide smile and he asked for more. He even finished with a &#39;please&#39;. Gilda laughed, asking if being fed like a baby was all right with him and James assured her that no, it was no problem at all and that the soup was delicious. After being spoon-fed the first bowl, James eagerly asked for seconds, which was promptly offered to him in the same way. Inside, James was boiling with fury. Yes, the soup was very good, but he had been cursed! He was enchanted to not have control of his body while it had fun obeying and pleasing three old witches! He could not do anything as it decided to act in a humiliatingly goofy way, no matter how hard his brain ordered it to act otherwise. Luckily, after the second bowl, Hilda waved her hands again in front of his eyes and whispered a few mysterious words. He was then back in control. He started to swear but stopped as he saw his body was sort of... glowing.<br />
&quot;What... What&#39;s happening?...&quot; he stuttered, frightened to the core of his being.<br />
What had they done to him now? Little did he know that two of the witches were just as surprised as he was. Hilda, for one, was smiling broadly. Her spell was kicking into action! She couldn’t wait to see the results!</p>
