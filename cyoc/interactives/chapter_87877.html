<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty changed Ashley&#39;s (formerly Dustin&#39;s) mind so that all she wanted to do was to sexually please Ty, it was her single and solitary purpose for existing. She looked up to Ty, loved Ty, and would crawl to the ends of the earth for Ty. This is how Ty would punish Dustin.<br />
<br />
Ty silently wished that Dustin in any form, regardless of his appearance, mental state, or efforts would not be able to turn him on.<br />
<br />
Ashley immediately began coming on to Ty and he wished her deodorant would fail, he let her know she was smelling bad, and she ran out of the room ashamed, to find her deodorant. When she came back Ty had gone downstairs and she was disappointed in herself again for failing Ty. <br />
<br />
She went downstairs to find Ty eating cereal, she said, &quot;There you are Tiger, I was wondering where you went.&quot; in her most seductive voice possible.<br />
<br />
Ty smiled knowing that he wouldn&#39;t have to keep this charade up for very long, &quot;I was just getting hungry.&quot; taking a bite of cereal.<br />
<br />
Ashley&#39;s mind screamed at her, &quot;How could you let the most perfect man in the world eat cold cereal? Isn&#39;t he deserving of a hot meal? How horrible could you be?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty really didn&#39;t mind the cereal at all, this was just his payback and he didn&#39;t even have to be mean, Ashley was doing it all to herself.<br />
<br />
Ashley offered to make him something hot and fresh but Ty declined, slurping the last of his milk. Well, at the very least she could give him company and eat with him! She sat down began eating as Ty poured another bowl. Each bite made her gain a pound of fat. Her hot body quickly melted away and pimples started to develop as her oil glands went into overdrive. Her round and bouncy body seemed normal to her despite remembering that she use to weigh about 60% of what she currently did.<br />
<br />
Ty got up and went to the living room turning on the TV to watch some cartoons. A few minutes later Ashley came in and sat next to him cuddling up, trying to be seductive. Being near her however was like sitting next to an industrial furnace and Ty couldn&#39;t bear to be near her so he pulled away and let her know she was a full on space heater.<br />
<br />
Undeterred, Ashley got on her knees and started excitedly pulling off his pants ready to give him the blowjob of his life and Ty stopped her, &quot;Thank you, but I&#39;m really not that into.... the mood.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shocked and hurt Ashley ran upstairs and into the bathroom, &quot;She tried so hard, she loved him, she just wanted him to be happy! If she can&#39;t make him happy then what good is she? Why is she even here?&quot; It was then that she saw herself in the mirror. Double chinned, greasy skinned, pimple infested face and she no longer wondered why Ty rejected her. She let herself become disgusting and she loathed herself. Sobbing quietly so as not to disturb Ty she sneaked back downstairs to the kitchen grabbing a large knife.<br />
<br />
Ty noticed time slow, Ashley had triggered the protections he had put into place. Time was still moving but more slowly, or maybe Ty was just moving faster? He calmly stood up and searched the house for Ashley, looking upstairs first. <br />
<br />
When Ty finally found Ashley time had almost stopped. Her face was beet red and stuck in a pained grimace with tears streaming down her face and one was stuck in mid air. Ty smiled sadly, he didn&#39;t like hurting his foster brother this way but he knew it was for the best.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dustin.&quot; Ty called softly. &quot;Dustin, it&#39;s time to come back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley&#39;s body rippled as Dustin&#39;s 16 year old form broke through the disheveled sex slave exterior, the last phase of Dustin&#39;s &quot;punishment&quot; was taking hold as Dustin&#39;s face slowly fell to horror. The true nature of Ty&#39;s wish was being revealed in Dustin&#39;s mind. <br />
<br />
All of Ty&#39;s desperate searching for love and acceptance, his need to please and be good, as well as his nights alone, crying himself to sleep while contemplating suicide and feeling worthless were being correlated to Dustin&#39;s 40 minute experience. Ty&#39;s most vulnerable moments were being pumped into Dustin&#39;s head with context so that he could walk a mile in Ty&#39;s shoes. This was his punishment.<br />
<br />
Dustin now understood intimately how he, Mark and June had made Ty feel all these years. Dustin felt what Ty had gone through to get into their home and his crushed heart when his new older foster brother acted like he was the scum of the earth. The list went on and on and on. Time sped back up going around a quarter of normal speed, Dustin dropped the knife and Ty picked it out of the air replacing it in it&#39;s holder. <br />
<br />
Ty stepped back and leaned against the fridge waiting for the spell or whatever it was, to complete. Time was going about 3/4ths speed and Dustin stared at him and fell to his knees, still crying. Ty&#39;s heart was moved and he stepped towards Dustin, who grabbed him in a strong hug and held his waist. Time suddenly snapped back to normal and sounds from the TV in the other room started making sense again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so sorry Ty, I didn&#39;t know what I was doing. I never realized how much you loved us. I didn&#39;t mean to, I&#39;m so sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty didn&#39;t just relive all his trauma but it was still pulling at his heart, and for the first time ever, he actually felt understood by a member of his family. Ty got choked up and couldn&#39;t speak so he held Dustin&#39;s head and rubbed his hair until the sobbing stopped though he was still muttering about how sorry he was.<br />
<br />
Ty wanted Dustin to feel better because they truly loved one another as family finally. Ty didn&#39;t know what he was doing but went with his instinct. He reached down and picked up Dustin who had shrunk down to a two year old&#39;s size but kept his muscular 16 year old proportions, and he hugged him tightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dustin, I have already forgiven you. Those are the old wounds from last chapter and I needed you to see all that so we could be in this next chapter together. If I didn&#39;t already forgive you, then you would have become something horrible like Marks 78 year old gay lover.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin began sobbing again, the magnitude of Ty&#39;s forgiveness, even before he realized how horrible he had been, was just too much for Dustin to deal with, he didn&#39;t deserve such a wonderful brother.<br />
<br />
Ty walked into the living room and willed the TV off. He laid Dustin down and made him fall asleep. Even asleep he was sobbing. Ty wished that the wounds that Dustin had felt faded for him as they had faded for Ty but over the next 5 minutes rather than 6 years. He also wished that over the next 5 minutes he would grow back to his normal size and then wake up.</p>
