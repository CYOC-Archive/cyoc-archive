<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff finished her last few periods and couldn&#39;t help but feel giddy about her date with Chris throughout the rest of the day. What movie will he take her to? Will he try to kiss her? Will he try to make a move? Will she smack him? Biology and English composition simply couldn&#39;t hold her interest!<br />
<br />
Once classes finally let out Jeff grabbed her purse and went to her locker grabbing her necessities for her homework when she realized her bag was emptier than it should have been.. &quot;Oh crap! The device... I can&#39;t leave it here....&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff scurried through the crowded halls and made her way to Mrs. Tomson&#39;s Office. Jeff knocked on the door to be greeted with a distracted but warm, &quot;Come in.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff entered and saw Mrs. Tomson, the 60 year old woman, at her computer deeply engrossed with something on the screen. Jeff quietly sat down at the desk and glanced over her Phys. Ed. instructor&#39;s cluttered work space. There was a small corner dedicated to a few trophies, presumably Woman&#39;s Volleyball and Cheer-leading championships. Questions of whether or not she will manage to bring her any of her teams to state before she retired were mentioned any time a student was chided for tardiness, or laziness.  <br />
<br />
Jeff felt warm in the small cramped space, it was awkward being enveloped in another person&#39;s private space... Glancing around Jeff noticed a picture of Mrs. Tomson and what must be her grand-daughter, or maybe her daughter Jeff corrected... Mrs. Tomson is only in her forties after all... Jeff&#39;s eyes darted across the room, unsure of a safe place to land, there were children&#39;s medical waiver&#39;s here as well as evaluation&#39;s, knowing too much could put them both in a compromising position. Where did that thought come from?<br />
<br />
&quot;Um.. I was hoping for my tool, um device? back, I need to catch the bus..&quot; Jeff said with growing discomfort as his presence hadn&#39;t even been acknowledged yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amazing.&quot; was the only response Jeff got.<br />
<br />
After a long pause, Jeff got anxious and spoke again, &quot;Um, so I&#39;d like my property back so I can get the bus before it leaves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yes...&quot; Mrs. Tomson replied turning around, she was the 32 year old Milf in the school, the other teachers were more seasoned but much older, and being the phys ed teacher, she attracted a lot of attention from the students, both male and female. &quot;I heard you, but we are overdue for a little heart to heart.&quot; she said with a coy chuckle.<br />
<br />
Jeff shifted uncomfortably. &quot;Tell me, and this isn&#39;t a trick question, What is your gender? In the simplest of terms for me, please. Or rather, I think the correct term, is your biological sex?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh,&quot; Jeff was dumbfounded. &quot;Male?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Fascinating&quot; she muttered, &quot;And are you interested in boys or girls?&quot; she continued. <br />
<br />
&quot;Girls!&quot; Jeff said without hesitation though this conversation was more intimate than he was expecting.<br />
<br />
&quot;And your relationship with Chris? From 4th period?&quot; she questioned.<br />
<br />
Jeff hesitated, He felt something... but all his thoughts were blurry in his mind. &quot;I uhh, I don&#39;t know.&quot;<br />
Jeff said slowly, and honestly. &quot;But I need to catch the bus otherwise Ill be stuck here till my parents can pick me up at 6.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, not to worry about that, you&#39;ll be fine.&quot; Mrs. Tomson said confidently, calming Jeff&#39;s fears though he realized there was no reason to take comfort. &quot;I&#39;m not a science instructor but I have a little experience with trial and error and ruling out variables. Diet, exercise, rest....&quot; Ms. Tompson continued. &quot;After confiscating this machine, I noticed things... were a little different around me...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s heart skipped a beat or several, though, inexplicably, something in the back of his mind told him to trust Mrs. Tomson. &quot;I pieced together that your device, can change certain circumstances, and after much trial and error... &quot; Ms. Tomson paused dramatically. &quot;The battery died.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff exhaled sharply and chuckled feeling much more relaxed in his friends office, he repositioned getting a sense that this couldn&#39;t be the end of his friends story... Peggy was obviously building up to something, as she does... In the distance the growl of the buses with loads of kids barely reached their sanctum, Jeff felt like he had forgotten something but pushed the thought aside, his friend was talking. &quot;And then what happened?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I plugged it in! I looked around and found this USB cable. I didn&#39;t find a charger so I had to plug it into the only USB port I could find.&quot; She gestured to a weird device plugged into her computer desktop. &quot;So I did class like usual and when I got back, I realized the strangest thing!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!?&quot; Jeff asked getting intrigued. <br />
<br />
&quot;It installed itself on the computer! Yeah! There was this whole new program on the computer; how it managed to get past the schools security is well beyond my expertise but knowing what the device alone could do, I had to check it out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Obviously.&quot; Jeff mumbled, feeling like he was missing something huge that was staring at him, He shifted his weight but remained focused on his girlfriend, which was easy, she was a smoking hot 25 year old brunette Phys Ed teacher.<br />
<br />
&quot;Up popped your profile.&quot; Peg smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Jeff asked incredulously with a smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;No really,&quot;  Peg chuckled, &quot;It had your profile, but not as the huge breasted, teen girl lusting after Christopher Mason.&quot; Jeff laughed at the absurdity. &quot;But as a 16 year old boy.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god, don&#39;t make me go back to that!&quot; Jeff laughed, <br />
<br />
Peg replied, &quot;Oh I don&#39;t intend to, at least not anytime soon.&quot; with an oddly serious tone and a chortle that sounded like she heard something ironic. &quot;So after looking through things on my free period I realized the device can do so very much more than the couple pre-loaded options.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; Jeff said beginning to wonder what the point of all this was.<br />
<br />
&quot;So I set up a few things. First returning your masculinity...&quot; Jeff cut in, &quot;Well I do approve.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I was just playing around with the one thing I knew how to do. That&#39;s when I realized there was a distance limit. Then I decided to make myself 35 years younger.&quot; Jeff just raised his eyebrows wondering why his girlfriend was making up such a story.<br />
<br />
&quot;But then to really play around, I dove into the mental settings and decided to play around with your profile so that even with the most glaring of proof you wouldn&#39;t want the device back, believe it&#39;s capabilities, or even bother to examine it.&quot; Peggy smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um sure, great... so are you ready for our date?&quot; Jeff asked growing a bit tired of this game...<br />
<br />
&quot;Almost honey, there&#39;s a bit more I need to tell you, just in case... I turned you into one type of man I had considered having as a boyfriend but never ended up catching. I plan on using my new lease on life to test out relationships with all different kinds of personalities and lives to see what works. Seeing that I can&#39;t return you to normal, you&#39;ll get be all sorts of different kinds of men and still be yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, so... just to make sure I&#39;ve got this, You&#39;re 60, I&#39;m really 16 and I haven&#39;t been working all day, but have been at school as a student... You&#39;re making it so that you can steal that thing from me, and date a ton of guys... who all happen to be me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That about sums it up.&quot; Peg replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you may be overdue for a vacation, but that last bit does sound a bit kinky...&quot; Jeff threw her a smirk. &quot;So what kind of person do you want me to be?&quot; Jeff asked thinking that maybe this was her way of trying to tell him something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh all of them! Introvert, extrovert, entrepreneur, maybe 10 years older, or 5 years younger, a submissive office grunt or a muscular laborer, avid hobbyist, or an intellectual who reads for fun, a sports fan or maybe a sports star? Maybe a rebellious biker, world traveler, racer, someone who earns way more than me, and way less. There are so many factors and all of them come with their own sets of perks and drawbacks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, well, I don&#39;t know what to say about that. So, date night, you ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More than!&quot; Peggy beamed a radiant grin and seemed back to her normal self.</p>
