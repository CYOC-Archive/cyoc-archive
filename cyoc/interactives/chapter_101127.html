<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">**Wrote really quick, so expect a few errors in continuity, spelling, etc - bj88<br />
<br />
**Link to photo that better describes the Watson house, though color is subject to change -  <br />
<br />
Ben and Alex pulled into the Watson’s long driveway at five. Their house was the typical raised ranch home**. <br />
<br />
“Are we supposed to do anything in particular with the kid?” Alex asked, as the two exited the car. <br />
<br />
“Not really. Just get to know him. Mom said we shouldn’t press the issue, getting him to open up, just yet. Better to let him do it on his own. The whole point is helping Jeremy learn to make friends.”<br />
<br />
“Maybe Eric would be a better fit than you or me. I mean, he’s about as socially awkward as they come.” Alex said. When he first met the younger Anderson he wasn’t sure if Eric was being rude, or stupid. Of course Nate explained his brother’s behavior, and after spending some more time with him, neither Alex or Ben had any problems with Eric. <br />
<br />
“You really think putting two socially awkward people together is a good idea? Two people who won’t talk to each other, not even if the house is on fire.” Ben asked with a laugh.<br />
<br />
“Good point.” The two walked up the small stairs and stopped at the entrance landing. Ben pressed the ringer and heard Gina calling Jeremy down from his room. She appeared at the door, wearing a simple navy blue dress and her purse tucked under her arm. Her light brown, almost blonde hair was done up in a bun.<br />
<br />
“You must be Ben Twist. It’s a pleasure to finally meet you.” Gina said, extending a hand to the boy with darker hair. <br />
<br />
“Yes. And this is my boyfriend Alex Ramsey.” Ben said shaking her hand.<br />
<br />
“Thank you for letting me hang out here while Ben watches your son. I hope it’s not too much of an inconvenience.” Alex said.<br />
<br />
“Not at all. Please come inside,” Gina stepped back to let them in. She heard Jeremy’s door shut, and then his footsteps on the stairs. <br />
<br />
“I’ve left emergency numbers on the refrigerator. Jeremy knows where everything is, but the bathroom is there,” Gina points down the main hallway to the door with a decorative wreath, “and the kitchen is on the other side of the dining room.” <br />
<br />
“Is there anything you wanted us to do? We’re more than capable of doing chores if any need to be done.” Ben asked, adjusting his backpack. <br />
<br />
“Thank you for the offer, but no. Jeremy don’t just stand there come down!” Gina said when she caught Jeremy watching them from the middle the stair case. The nine year old continued down the steps, cautiously sniffing the air. Even though he hadn’t experienced his first transformation yet, he could still detect some smells. <br />
<br />
“Weredogs?” he wondered. Jeremy still couldn’t tell the difference between dogs, wolves, and other coyotes like his mother’s family. Foxes were tricky but they generally smelled a little sweeter than the other candids. <br />
<br />
Ben and Alex watched the small brown haired boy descend the stairs. He was fairly average in height for his age, around four feet six give or take an inch. He had, they assumed, his father’s hair but his mother’s green eyes. <br />
<br />
“Jeremy, this is Ben, and his friend Alex. They’re going to be watching you tonight.” Gina introduced them. She refrained from using “boyfriend” since most nine year olds didn’t understand those kinds of things. Even in Moon Lake, children were blissfully unaware of what their parents or older siblings were doing when the lights went out. <br />
<br />
“Hi,” Ben leaned over to offer his hand. Jeremy shook it, still giving Ben a curious look. Alex followed suit, and the look transferred to him.<br />
<br />
“What are you two?” Jeremy asked after he let go of Alex’s hand.<br />
<br />
“Jeremy, how many times do…”<br />
<br />
“It’s alright Mrs. Watson. I remember when I was his age, I couldn’t sort out the smells either.” Ben said.<br />
<br />
“What do you think we are?” Ben asked Jeremy directly. The boy thought about it for a while before answering.<br />
<br />
“Chocolate labs?” he said. Alex chocked back a laugh, as did Gina. Ben managed to keep a straight face, but only because he was pinching himself. <br />
<br />
“Sorry, but no. You got the canine part right though. WereWOLVES.” Ben said. Jeremy’s eyes almost lit up at that, which Ben found very interesting. Maybe the kid was like a little Nate Anderson, fascinated by werewolves and their lore. Of course the one major difference being that Jeremy was already a were. <br />
<br />
“I’ll be back before nine. Jeremy’s bedtime is nine thirty on weekends, but I’d like him ready by the time I get back. I left some money for dinner on the counter. And remember, call me if you need anything, no matter how small.” Gina said. Both Ben and Alex nodded their heads like soldiers. Then Gina bent over to kiss her son goodbye.<br />
<br />
“Be good, alright. Don’t give them any trouble. I want a good review when I come home.” she said.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry Mom. Everything will be fine.” Jeremy said. It was in moments like that Gina saw John in her son. Before his death she would smile and then go about her day. But after, she had to stop the waterfall of tears, and try not to let her grief show. <br />
<br />
“Bye,” Ben and Alex waved to Gina Watson as she climbed into her own car and drove away. The group walks from the foyer and into the modest living room. The house has a very open floor plan, so they can see clear into the kitchen. A skylight throws the evening sunset into the room, painting color all over the carpet. When the two turn around, they see Jeremy staring at them as if they were Batman and Robin.<br />
<br />
“Uh, something on your mind kid?” Alex asked, sitting on the arm of the couch. . <br />
<br />
“Can I see?” Jeremy asks, almost begs. <br />
<br />
“See what?” Ben asked, though he had a feeling he knew what Jeremy wanted to see. <br />
<br />
“What you guys look like as werewolves. Please? My mom has this 'don't transform at home' policy so I’ve never seen her transform, or seen a real werewolf before. A few weredogs, but those are so boring.” Jeremy said.<br />
<br />
“There are plenty of weredogs who would be quite offended to hear you say they are ‘boring’.” Ben remarked.<br />
<br />
“So? It’s true, isn’t it? If I wanted to look at a German Shepherd standing on its hind legs, I can just go to YouTube. But werewolves are so much cooler!” Jeremy said with ramps fascination. It was becoming clear to Ben and Alex that Jeremy wasn’t like Nate or Eric. He was more a mix, having Eric’s intelligence and awkwardness plus Nate’s former obsession for werewolves. Something that had been remedied by becoming one. <br />
<br />
“If you really want to sure. But we’ll have to change out of our clothes.” Ben said.<br />
<br />
“Why?”<br />
<br />
“Well, werewolves are one of the bigger species of were. I’m about five feet, ten inches right now, but after I transform I’m more like eight or nine feet tall.”<br />
<br />
“Wow, so cool. Mom only gets a foot taller when she changes. Is that because coyotes are smaller than wolves?”<br />
<br />
“Probably, but it’s always in part due to the fact she’s a woman. Females of any species are usually smaller than the males.” Ben explains. Then, he and Alex start the process of undressing. They stay in their underwear, knowing that going completely naked in front of a nine year old is so very, very wrong. <br />
<br />
“Ready?” Ben asks, both to Alex and Jeremy. Jeremy eagerly nods his head. The two start the transformation, slowly so Jeremy can watch. Silver fur pokes its way out of Ben’s skin while darker gray fur covered Alex. Their fingernails split to form claws, and their toenails do the same. Ears migrate to the tops of their heads, and stretch into points. <br />
<br />
On Ben, silver fur meets sandy fur on his back. Where Alex is the classic gray colored schemed wolf. Both their tails push out at the same time, and then their legs change to a digitigrade stance. The last thing to change is their faces as they push out into lupine snouts. <br />
<br />
The entire time Jeremy sits crossed legged on one of the lounge chairs. He’s seen werewolf movies before (despite his mother putting a child lock on the Netflix), and werewolf transformations. But the real thing is a lot different than he expected. And a lot cooler. When the two are finished, Jeremy sits before them with his mouth hanging open. <br />
<br />
“You alright Jeremy? Not too shocked by our awesomeness are you?” Alex jokes. <br />
<br />
“Are you kidding? No way! I can’t wait until I hit thirteen!”<br />
<br />
“There’s no guarantee you’ll turn at thirteen.” Ben said, flexing his claws and toes. The carpet feels odd beneath his pads, mostly because he’s not used to standing on carpets while in his were form. Most of the time, when he changes, he’s on wood, solid ground, or dirt. His entire house is hardwood floors, with throw rugs. <br />
<br />
“I don’t care, I can’t wait! Being a werewolf looks so awesome.” <br />
<br />
“Uh, won’t you turn into a werecoyote when you get older?” Alex asked, suddenly wondering whether all the smells he’s picking up on Jeremy are from his mom. <br />
<br />
“Maybe, but my dad was a werewolf so I’m hoping I take after him. Mom never let him change in the house though. Said it was a pain to vacuum all the fur from the carpets.” Jeremy said. <br />
<br />
A silence fell over the room. Jeremy brought up his father like it was no big deal. Maybe to him, it wasn’t. Which worried Ben and Alex.<br />
<br />
“Is he in denial? Or acting?” Ben thought. And the fact that Jeremy had never seen his father change was also a bit of a surprise. Francis had told Ben that sometimes people will repress memories if they're too painful. Maybe Jeremy was. Or creating false ones to protect himself.<br />
<br />
"I take it your mom hasn't really talked to you about the were stuff then?" Ben said, sitting on the floor so he is at least closer to Jeremy's face. He and Alex are still about level with him, while Jeremy's in the chair anyway.<br />
<br />
"What don't I already know?" Jeremy asked.<br />
<br />
"A few things, but your mom should tell you, not us. Or at the very least we should get her permission." Ben said. He wasn't sure if they should tell Jeremy all the ins and outs of being a were, let alone about being a werewolf. If his father was one, then Jeremy would be too. Which was good, considering Jeremy's apparent fascination with werewolves. Of course there was also a chance he'd turn out to be a hybrid like Spencer Lawson. But those odds where one in a million, maybe one in a billion.<br />
<br />
"Stranger things have happened. And it's Jeremy being a hybrid is more believable since coyotes and wolves are natural cousins." Ben thought.</p>
