<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lucas got nervous. His physics class was with Dr. Yamada, an older Japanese man. While he was curious as to what kind of man Dr. Yamada would be, he was also nervous about it. What if Dr. Yamada was super attractive in this world? He’d be too busy staring and being horny to actually pay attention to class. <br />
He was right to be worried. Through the far door walked in a big muscular man, slightly shorter than Lucas, and overall a bit smaller, but had far better muscle definition than Lucas had. As he moved you could see every muscle adjust to his movements, you could swear you could even see his veins pulse as his heart beat. A necktie was tied around his bare neck, settling between his two pecs. His chest had some sparse black hair on it, not enough to cover anything. He wore a black sash around his stomach, covering some of his abs. A 11-inch semihard penis stood in front of him. Below that, two powerful legs that looked like they could bust down a door without even trying. Dr. Yamada had a thick mustache and a 5 o’clock shadow on his cheeks, his hair in the same short style Lucas was used to, with some of his black hair beginning to grey. “Good morning everyone.” a deep bass voice boomed,  coming from Dr. Yamada. “I hope everyone did their homework last night, because we’re starting today with a quiz.” He heard the class groan, and Lucas looked in his bag. This was the same homework he was assigned the day before, so he felt confident he could ace the quiz. <br />
After passing out the quiz, however, Dr. Yamada sat in front of the class in his desk chair and grabbed ahold of his dick and began stroking. “First person to finish with their quiz gets to clean me up. Except you Austin, I’m not having any more kids you filthy breeder.” He looked over to see a guy deflate a little, clearly this was Austin… but he looked like Lucas’ classmate Alyssa. He assumed Austin was this world’s version of Alyssa. Dr. Yamada began to moan as his dick reached its full stiffness, and he used his free hand to take off the sash covering his abs.<br />
Lucas tried his best on the quiz. He knew the content of the quiz, but he did notice that the questions were a bit more suggestive. One of the questions asked how fast the tip of a dick was moving if the guy was windmilling. Another asked how far cum would go if it shot out at a certain speed. It was all the same questions as before, just much more dick-related. He was also very distracted by his own horniness, which would constantly spike by either Dr. Yamada’s moans, his own biceps brushing against his sensitive pecs, or accidentally touching his sensitive abs with his pencil or hand. As hard as he did try, Lucas was not the first to finish the quiz. <br />
Lucas heard someone running up to the front and he knew he lost. He looked up and saw a young boy, looked like he was no taller than three and a half feet, wearing a T-shirt and cargo shorts ran up to Dr. Yamada and placed his finished quiz on the table beside him. Dr. Yamada smirked. “Congrats Blake, you get to clean me up today.” Lucas was confused. This was Blake? In his world, Blake was a big muscular football player, one of Chris’ teammates. He was also a huge homophobe, yet here he was, a short kid-like man, getting excited about cleaning off another guy’s cum!<br />
Dr. Yamada’s strokes quickened as his moans turned more and more into primal roars, until a couple minutes later when Dr. Yamada came. Blake watched excitedly as the cum splattered onto Dr. Yamada’s abs, arm, and legs, and after the third splatter Blake excitedly placed his mouth around the tip of Dr. Yamada’s engorged dick, swallowing every drop that came out after. Watching this filled Lucas with excitement and he couldn’t help but slip one of his hands under his desk and piece of fabric and stick two of his long, thick fingers into his pussy, sliding in smoothly, being slick with his own cum.<br />
Over the next few minutes, everyone else in class turned in their quizzes, most of them giving Blake dirty looks as he gleefully sucked on Dr. Yamada’s softening member. Lucas took his fingers out only to turn his quiz in, beginning to masturbate as soon as he sat back down. For the rest of the two-hour lecture, Dr. Yamada carried Blake around with him as he gave his physics lecture, while Blake crawled around Dr. Yamada, licking his arm, legs, and abs clean. Dr. Yamada was holding Blake in whatever position he wanted to be in with one arm and writing on the whiteboard with the other. Lucas tried his best to take notes, but he continued masturbating for the entire lecture, trying more fingers, different spots, different speeds. He just couldn’t help himself, with  as horny as we was and the absolutely sexy display in front of him. He found it hard to hold a train of thought, and wondered how this world’s Lucas dealt with this. When the lecture finished, Blake hopped off Dr. Yamada and left with the rest of the students. Lucas had to keep himself from masturbating, which he found incredibly difficult. Outside the hall, he overheard Blake gloating about drinking Dr. Yamada’s cum to a Thick outside between kisses. Lucas assumed this was this worlds version of Jessica, Blake’s girlfriend.</p>
