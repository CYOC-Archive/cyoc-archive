<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alec O&#39;Brien POV:<br />
<br />
&quot;That court case was an absolute joke! They didnt even let me defend myself properly, of course I think the boy is unnatural! Homosexuality is a sin in God&#39;s eyes but no they said that the Bible is not a liable source of a testimony, just wait until I get my hands on that fruity faggot boy, he&#39;s gonna wish he was sorry for ever doing this to me&quot; Alec furiously screamed in his head.<br />
&quot;Where the fuck are they taking me now?! Oh yeah of course... I&#39;m being taken to become a lousy fag, well good luck trying to do that you bastards&quot;.<br />
As soon as they reached the door of the laboratory, they put two sets of restraints on him, one for his arms and the other for his legs.  Looks like they really thought of everything to keep him from running from his new life. <br />
They walked him to the middle of the room where they just chained him to a bed so he wouldn&#39;t move. After being secured by the guards, a doctor with thick framed glasses inched closer to him with two huge syringes, a quick glance at his name tag told him the name of the Dr in charge of the lab, Dr Howard Klein. He was focusing so hard on the Doctor that he didnt even realise that the needles were in his ball sack and there was a white liquid filling the glass tubing of the syringes.<br />
After catching sight of this Alec stared to panic as he could feel a lightness spread all across his bottom half of his body as if he just relieved himself of pee.<br />
&quot;What- what the fuck are you doing you little bastard!! Give me my spunk back right now. Give me it back right no- ohhhh&quot;. In his fit of rage at his loss of cum, he didnt see the other smaller syringes of white liquid get injected into his balls, he instantly felt turned on having his testicles film out again, but not as much as his previous set of seed. His lengthy stick exploded at full attention but something was off, it wasnt the same 10 inch it used to be- it seemed to be shrinking from 10 to 9 and then to 8, 7 eventually stopping at a 5.5 inches.<br />
&quot;Oh god what the fuck is happening, why do I feel so horny&quot;. He screamed in ecstasy<br />
For some reason the guards have started to release him from his chains and restraints, yet he can&#39;t move, no! He doesnt want to move, he&#39;s in so much bliss he doesnt want to destroy it. Suddenly, he can hear popping sounds coming from within his body as his bones are starting to reform and shape into that of his 14 year old son&#39;s, which looked odd considering he still has the look of his 46 year old father. <br />
Alec feels a pulling in his hands and puts his hand in front of his face and sees his fingers turn slimmer and longer, finally being turned into his former son&#39;s hand. <br />
The changes didnt stop their though as he could feel his face reshape and elongate slightly, his nose pushes out into a more prominent shape with a small bump on the bridge, unmistakably Percy&#39;s nose, which is now his. The final transformation of his face is his cheek bones and lips, his cheeks become more angular and sharp edged whilst his.lips fill out to be more thicker. <br />
Panic starts to kick in as he realised he is becoming the one thing he ostracized for years. For a moment Alec had assumed the transformation had stopped, but was proven wrong when his eyes burn from the change of colour from his previous dark brown to Percy&#39;s emerald green eyes that always reminded him of his beloved late wife. He heaved in pain as his fat melted off of his body that had left him with his sons lithe lanky body and the final nail in the transformational coffin was the itching sensation all over his body as all his body hair retracted into his skin and left him completely smooth to the touch, the itching then intensified at this skull as he.could feel his once receded hair grow back into a slightly tamed mop of hair on his head, but the most shocking part was that his hair colour no longer was his beloved Auburn of his old body, but now a dark jet black that is complete reminiscent of his new body of Percy.<br />
The changes are complete, and the crippling horniness coming from his new hormone filled teenaged body was too overwhelming that he had no choice to climax and fully seal the swap by releasing Percy&#39;s seed. He was now well and truly the new Percy O&#39;Brien if  he liked it or not. He panted for a good couple of minutes before he regained composure and started speaking.<br />
&quot;What- wh- oh fuck I&#39;ve even got his fag voice too&quot;, the new Percy said in a voice that was higher than his previous body.</p>
