<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amanda sat quietly in class. After it had been clear that Ms. Chung wasn&#39;t coming back, which saddened Amanda because she really enjoyed her, the rest of the class started to chatter and get really loud, every playing some impromptu games from another across the room, but Amanda sat quietly. While she had been undergoing Kira&#39;s punishment in the bathroom, the mouthy dom had tasked her with finding another girl to join in on the fun. Kira was adamant that she was looking for someone who WANTED to be a sub. BDSM didn&#39;t work without consent, and Kira, despite her regal title as Queen-bitch, was eminently fair and understanding that what was pleasure for people like Amanda would be traumatizing for other girls. Amanda discreetly started asking her classmates questions to find out who enjoyed pain and humiliation.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Regina had half-heartedly been expecting to fall through a vortex of colors and strange, creepy non-Euclidean iconography, which is how movies and cartoons usually portray this type of thing. Instead, when she had swallowed her all-consuming fear and leaped inside the portal to satisfy her curiosity, Regina had instantaneously landed someplace recognizably terrestrial. <br />
<br />
Actually, the physics teacher was exactly where she had  just been, on the sidewalk in front of the high school she had resigned from in shame.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-huh&quot; she said, confused, wondering if she had been hallucinating everything for the last five minutes. Or worse, perhaps she was now schizophrenic. She doubted either of those possibilities, but both were a better possibility than the tripe that woman had been feeding her about magic. Then again, after the Great Change, anything was possible. <br />
<br />
Regina decided to walk back inside the high school. She was on friendly terms with almost all of the staff, and wanted to say her goodbyes before vacating forever to...who knows where. She was still quite teary eyed, and she expected an emotional farewell, at least on her end of things. <br />
<br />
&quot;Did I really just imagine that portal?&quot;<br />
<br />
As she entered the school building however, Regina suddenly found herself...elsewhere. The hallway, which had a completely different, older looking layout and architecture, was filled with people she didn&#39;t recognize buzzing about in every which way. Present were some high school aged kids hanging out in the halls, but mostly adults, and they were from all different types of ethnicity, age and background. No one was dressed like they came out of Ren Faire or as cosplayers for some geeky fantasy convention. Sure, the fashions seemed slightly off kilter from 2016, but not out of date as much as out of time altogether. It was if she had entered another version, another timeline of humanity&#39;s cultural development.<br />
<br />
To her surprise, a framed portrait of Isaac Newton hung in a gallery of paintings on the right hand wall. There was some Latin saying below it, and Regina cursed herself. As Reece, she had never taken the time to properly master the language. <br />
<br />
She continued to move along, feeling increasingly uneasy. She heard loud noises which sounded like like booms going on upstairs. The new Regina, who was quite a bit smaller and more fragile than she had been as a man, she wouldn&#39;t be overtaking anyone physically anymore, felt afraid that she might be accosted at any minute in this strange new place.<br />
<br />
It was when she had saw the giant fire breathing dragon, smoke emanating from his nostrils, stomp from down the hall that she knew she wasn&#39;t in Kansas anymore.  She immediately grabbed the door handle to the room immediately to her left and ran inside of it, slamming the door behind her.<br />
<br />
She was now in a library.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Back in the real world...<br />
<br />
Greta had been good on her word, and made a wish that born-women who wanted their old bodies back would have the chance to retrieve them. Tendrils of magic shot out all over the globe from her ring, sending telepathic suggestions to all born-women if they were really happy with their new selves, and that if they wanted to go back to the way things were, all they had to do was pray. <br />
<br />
One by one, various born-women who, for one reason or another had not come to enjoy their youthful, sexy figures were reverting back to their previously imperfect selves, undergoing a transformation in reverse. It admittedly wasn&#39;t very many women at first, and not all of them did it for the same reasons. Some, like Elizabeth, had philosophical reasons for wanting to revert back. Other born-women simply wanted nothing to do with the Great Change, or had felt uncomfortable in their new bodies. Quite a few who had reverted back didn&#39;t feel that they deserved the comely bodies they had been given, or felt it inappropriate for a middle aged mother to look no older than her teenage daughters. By and large though, the majority of born-women were happy with Greta&#39;s wish of youth and beauty.<br />
<br />
**<br />
&quot;Hey sweetums, I&#39;m back&quot; said Allison. &quot;I brought you some treats!&quot;<br />
<br />
Logan looked through the plastic bag to find M&Ms, gummi bears, Kit-Kats, and all sorts of candy. She also bought her a Whopperito. Logan smiled her thanks to her. Allison had considered getting Logan a teddy bear as well, but dismissed the idea because she knew it would remind Logan of her new gender, the last thing Logan wanted.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I masturbated to the thought of you earlier&quot; admitted Logan. &quot;I thought about you in your My Little Pony PJ&#39;s and I thought about how cute you were in them. I almost...I almost thought you&#39;d make for a good girlfriend. What the fuck am I thinking, right?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Allison&#39;s heart became all aflutter...<br />
<br />
**<br />
&quot;This place is expensive&quot; said Juliana looking around at Casa Hermana. <br />
<br />
Millie laughed. &quot;It&#39;s not that expensive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;On an assistant principle&#39;s salary it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Millie and Juliana were holding hands on the candle lit table, Juliana looking past Millie&#39;s large framed glasses and straight into her soulful eyes. She looked beautiful, decked up in a really nice yellow dress she had bought just for this occasion. Juliana was wearing one of the outfits that had materialized in her home, a blouse/skirt combination and platform shoes that looked really good on her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been saving up my money for years. I never had anyone to spend it on, until now.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s unbelievable that such a sweet person like you had never gotten a date before&quot; said Juliana. &quot;Really. Even if you looked a little bit goofy as a man, you&#39;re a total sweetheart.&quot;<br />
<br />
Millie grinned coyly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t really want to talk about the old me anymore. That part of me is dead and buried. When the change first happened I was so scared, I thought I was going to lose my job, my apartment, everything, since I had no way to prove who I was anymore. But when I set eyes on you, I somehow knew that everything was going to turn out alright. I&#39;ve NEVER been happier than since I met you, babe. By the way, banging in the janitor&#39;s closet at lunchtime was so hot. We need to do that more often.&quot;<br />
<br />
Millie started to feed Juliana from her plate...<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
 Elizabeth and Robbie were curled up together on the couch. They were both about to watch the President for the first time address the country about the Great Change. Elizabeth had taken Greta&#39;s suggestion to heart and was much more touchy feely with Robbie than usual. She was gently caressing her wife&#39;s entire body, squeezing her breasts, feeling her smooth thighs, and lightly fingering her vagina through her underwear.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how did you change back?&quot; asked Robbie, on the edge of an orgasm. She had liked seeing Elizabeth younger again, and was upset that when she had come home, Liz was back to her old self.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, here she is!&quot; said Elizabeth, pointing at the TV, ignoring her wife&#39;s question.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Baby Jo had, with her last ounce of strength, crawled out of her crib and began to climb down...</p>
