<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Erin awoke in darkness. It was warm and cramped, with slick padded walls gently pushing in on all sides. Erin remembered she was part dog-dick now, and she was cozied up inside her sheath. Well, the sheath she was in that was also part of her host Trish, the rainbow centaur.<br />
<br />
Everything was still. Nothing was happening. Erin was in no hurry to break this peace. As she relaxed she took the opportunity to meditate. She let her senes reach out and feel the world around her.<br />
<br />
She could feel her sheath pushing in on all sides of her body, and she could feel her shared bladder, which had partially refilled itself overnight. She felt her phone pinned between the sheath wall and a boob, and her arms were wrapped around her body in a hug. She could feel she was oriented with her left side facing the floor, the same way she fell asleep. She could feel her host&#39;s rhythmic heartbeat as it made her entire being pulse. She could feel the hollowness of her urethra, a desire for it to carry fluid destined for the outside world, a sensation starting at her throat and going all the way down her body. She could feel a cushion and a hindleg gently pressing into large testicles she had no hopes of ever touching. She could feel the air moving gently across the fur of the sheath she was tucked inside. On top of all that, she noticed she wasn&#39;t breathing. She felt no compulsion to take a breath.<br />
<br />
It seemed the sensory changes her host alluded to last night were more comprehensive than just making urine taste good.<br />
<br />
Being able to sense the world outside through their balls and sheath was a surreal experience for Erin, who was used to the limitations of a human&#39;s body. She wondered if she would also feel the prostate she knew would be connected to the bladder and balls.<br />
<br />
Erin could feel the leg pressing against her testicle shift and her meat cocoon roll so she was now facing down. Trish must be getting up.<br />
<br />
Erin decided this was a good time to break her trance. Stirring, she moved her arms and felt both her sheath on her hand and her hand on her sheath. It was extremely alien, so she spent the next few minutes just moving her arms around and exploring the sensations.<br />
<br />
She could feel a slow rhythmic pulling against the balls and could feel herself moving up and down in sync, which must mean Trish was walking around. The hoofsteps might have also been a giveaway, sounds that were both muffled and clearly audible, like she was listening with her ears plugged.<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t know what Trish was doing but assumed they would eventually need to use the restroom.<br />
<br />
Erin decided to use this time to check in on social media, or at least try to. She rescued the trapped phone and tried to find a position where could see it properly. She had a few notifications on instagram so she checked that first. Apparently she had been posting about her new life as a dick, because there were a few likes and comments on pictures she didn&#39;t remember taking. These posts were of course the app&#39;s doing; it dutifully shifted reality to make sense of the nonsense modifications she made. If she concentrated, she could recall taking the photos.<br />
<br />
Stretching out the sheath with one hand, she held the phone facing the wall with the other. It was still pitch black so she had to use the flash. After her eyes cleared, she studied the photo. The sheath walls were a pinkish-red with little blue and red veins running just under the surface, and her skin was the same tone as when she was human.<br />
<br />
Deciding she didn&#39;t want to blind herself again, she deemed the photo adequate and went to post it. &quot;Waking up in my own embrace&quot; she decided to caption it.<br />
<br />
Moments after posting it, she could hear a muffled ping.<br />
<br />
&quot;So that&#39;s why you didn&#39;t want to give it up last night,&quot; Erin heard Trish say, her voice loud and clear to Erin. She could feel the sound traveling down their penile bone, up her spine, and into her ears. A notification on her phone told her Trish just liked the post.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t get too cozy down there, we need to pee soon.&quot; Trish warned. Erin hoped it was a promise. The sudden appearance of a hardwood floor against their balls indicated Trish had sat down somewhere.<br />
<br />
The thought of a repeat of last night, being able to feel the urine flowing through her and the taste of it on her tongue sent shivers through her. Muscles tensed that she hadn&#39;t noticed before, pushing on the penile bone she was connected to and evicting her from the sheath&#39;s embrace.<br />
<br />
The first thing Erin saw when her head poked out was the bottom of the dinner table. Trish must be eating breakfast. She expelled the stale air from last night and drew in new breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning Trish,&quot; Erin greeted her host.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning Erin,&quot; Trish replied back.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what are we doing today?&quot; Erin asked. Her shoulders freed, she started to stretch her arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Once we drain the bladder and drain the balls, I figured it would be a nice day to gallop along the beach. I invited Cindy and Tina too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin was out far enough she could start limbering up her torso–or what now was considered her length–and was stretching side to side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmf, keep doing that and we&#39;ll have to handle the balls before the bladder,&quot; Trish called down in response to the partial dog-dick&#39;s wiggling.<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn&#39;t sound too bad at all,&quot; Erin teased, &quot;it&#39;s a date.&quot; She began to trace a finger along her body with her left hand. The caress of her finger on her sensitive skin made her and Trish shiver.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile her right hand was tapping on her phone getting another sentence to edit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Erin is intentionally teasing herself to make Trish horny.&quot;</p>
