<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(Violence because egg laying bee.)<br />
<br />
Dana woke up the next morning and she stretched out as much as she could before she got up. Dana looked down at her body again and sighed, but paused as she looked down at her breasts. They were larger than before, in fact they were the size of watermelons, but they were still as firm as before. &quot;What the hell? Ugh, what did Kat do to me now?&quot; Dana buzzed then she looked around the room and sighed as she saw her bees we’re all over the room.<br />
<br />
Dana then opened the window and allowed her bees to get to work at what they do. Dana then sighed and looked back down at her breasts, and she cupped and began fondling with them for a few moments. &quot;Yeah, they’re bigger, but why?&quot; Dana asked herself then she sighed and buzzed,&quot;Thizzzz izzzz going to be annoying.&quot;<br />
<br />
Moments later there was a knock on the door, and Dana heard the voice of her sister,&quot;Can I come in little sis?&quot; Dana paused then she walked up to the door and replied,&quot;Zzzure, but you better explain zzzzomething to me.&quot; There was a pause then Kat replied,&quot;Explain what Dana? I can’t really see you unless you say it’s safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dana groaned then she jerked the door open and pointed to her breasts then buzzed,&quot;Thezzze!&quot; Kat paused then she stared at Dana’s breasts for a moment and said,&quot;Oh wow, you must’ve been really busy with your drones I bet to get those. I didn’t expect them to knock you up so quickly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Knock me...&quot;Dana paused and a sudden thought popped into her head about eggs, and Dana buzzed,&quot;No...no, you are not zzzaying that....THAT happened zzzzo zzzzoon.&quot; Kat held up her hands in surrender and tried to calm her sister down and said,&quot;Hey now, you do realize how quickly gestation is for bees, and queens are said to lay lots of eggs. You’re just lucky that you mated with a smaller drone rather than one of your size....for now at least.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dana’s face turned white now and she walked back into her room and said,&quot;Oh god thizzz izzzn’t happening now. Pleazzzze tell me it’zzzz not happening now.&quot; Kat followed Dana in then she placed her hand on Dana’s shoulder to comfort her. &quot;It’s natural that you would feel this way, but stressing out won’t help you in this situation. You’re probably going to lay eggs today, and when you do you’ll know.&quot; Kat said to Dana in a calm voice then Dana looked up at Kat and just stared at her for a few moments.<br />
<br />
Kat turned around and said,&quot;I&#39;ll get a bucket, you&#39;ll see why once you get started. Just follow your instincts sis, and don’t worry about a thing.&quot; Dana paused then she nodded to Kat and took a deep breath to calm herself. <br />
<br />
A couple couple minutes passed and Kat didn’t return, and suddenly Dana’s body felt odd. Dana didn’t know why it felt this way, but then she looked down at her abdomen and suddenly it swelled up. Dana then panicked, and she saw a small lump move up from her abdomen into the pelvis of her thorax and immediately something told her to get herself over her hive combs. Dana did just that and waited in an awkward position about her combs and waited for Kat to return feeling a bit desperate about depending on her.<br />
<br />
Without another moment to think, Dana felt something push up against the walls of her vagina and she let out a loud and high pitched buzz of distress. Dana’s nipples then suddenly became erect and they dropped with a shiny, golden and sticky substance, honey. &quot;Damnit, where&#39;zzzz Kat?! Where’zzzz the hive?! Why aren’t the dronezzz doing anything?!&quot; Dana thought to herself then she felt her vagina walls stretch and she slowly pushed out a rice-shaped egg about 1 foot long. Dana then followed her instincts, and she looked down into the comb and allowed her breasts to leak their honey into the comb.<br />
<br />
Seconds later another lump moved into her thorax, and the process began again for her. Dana felt something push against the walls of her pussy and her breasts began to leak even more of the honey. It was then Kat returned as Dana&#39;s vagina wall stretched for the second time and she pushed out another egg into a comb.<br />
<br />
Dana shifted her position once the first comb was filled two-thirds of the way to the brim, and she saw Kat then buzzed,&quot;Itzzz, about tiaaaahhzzzzzz....&quot; Dana buzzed yet again, and her breasts began to leak even more honey from them. &quot;Just hang in there Dana, I promise it will get easier after the first few.&quot; Kat exclaimed then Dana looked up at her and buzzed,&quot;Eazzzy for you to ZzaAAAAGH!!&quot; Dana pushed out the egg, but this time felt slightly less painful and she actually felt turned on by it.<br />
<br />
Dana switched positions again then she looked up at Kat with the bucket and breathing heavily. &quot;What’zzz THAT for?!&quot; Dana buzzed feeling frustrated and just fed up with the eggs. &quot;After your eggs are done just empty your excess honey here.&quot; Kat exclaimed then Dana paused and buzzed,&quot;Am I a cowAAAAAGH!?&quot; Kat remained silent as Dana repeated the process and laid a fourth egg. This time Dana didn’t feel an excruciating amount of pain, and her scream sounded more like a orgasmic moan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nnnghaaah, zzzz....zzzzo many...&quot; Dana moaned as she shifted again to lay a fifth egg, and Kat looked at Dana then said,&quot;That’s it, just keep going.&quot; Another lump moved into her thorax, and Dana moaned again and she asked,&quot;How many?! How big izzz...nngh!&quot; Dana lake yet another egg, and Kat peered at Dana’s abdomen and said,&quot;Still a bit more, just keep it up!&quot; Dana gave her sister a quick nod then she continued her duty as a queen bee and pushed out each individual egg.<br />
<br />
After Dana was finished laying her eggs and filling each comb she laid an egg inside of she noticed her breasts hadn’t shrank a bit, and they were still leaking honey. &quot;I *pant* laid 14 eggzzz, and thezzze thingzzz are zzztill doing thizzz?!&quot; Dana buzzed then Kat paused and walked up to Dana with the bucket and said,&quot;That’s what this is for.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dana stared at the bucket for a few seconds then she looked up at Kat and said,&quot;I&#39;m....not zzzure how I feel about you for thizzz.&quot; Kat nodded to Dana then she said,&quot;I&#39;m sorry, but here anyways.&quot; Kat held out the bucket and Dana grabbed it then she walked over to the wall and sat down against it on the floor. Dana allowed her abdomen to lay in front of her and she laid the bucket on it and below her breasts to have something to drain the excess honey into.<br />
<br />
Kat then walked up to Dana and sat right next to her, and watched as the honey drained into the bucket. &quot;Are you okay?&quot; Kat asked then Dana looked up at her exhausted and said,&quot;What do you think?&quot; Kat paused then looked at the bucket and back to Dana’s body and said,&quot;Well I think I’m concerned for you. I also think you might need another bucket, and that you enjoyed laying those last few eggs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dana paused and looked to the bucket as it was halfway full in a couple of seconds and her breasts were only starting to shrink back to their original size and blushed. &quot;You made me zzzo....&quot; Dana peered down at her body and sighed,&quot;Pleazzze don&#39;t tell Mom and Dad.&quot; Kat looked at Dana then paused and said,&quot;Are you kidding? This is incredible for you little sis!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dana looked at Kat then sighed and said,&quot;Kat you’re an aunt to all of them, and you zzzay that thizzzz izzz good?!&quot; Kat looked at Dana then smiled and said,&quot;They’ll be large workers like you are as a queen bee.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about dronezzzz? Becauzzze incezzzzt is illegal for a reazzzzon!&quot; Dana buzzed then Kat smiled and said,&quot;You won’t have any of those. But trust me, you&#39;ll get some drones eventually from...other places. First though, you need a new bucket, and if you want to get done faster you can always squeeze it out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dana paused and blushed then watched as Kat stood up and left the room. &quot;Zzzzo I make wax and honey like breaszztmilk.&quot; Dana buzzed then sighed,&quot;I need to talk to Mom about this.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kat returned after a couple minutes and Dana gave the first bucket to Kat. Kat gave Dana the second bucket and said,&quot;They should be back to normal size by the end of this one, and you can keep this bucket for yourself too. I know your bees will love the stuff.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kat then left Dana to do what she did and Dana sighed and thought,&quot;Well, that didn’t feel that bad I suppose. The pleasure outwitted the pain in the end. Geez, how much more do they have in them?&quot; Dana then paused and reached a finger under the honey stream of one of her breasts and she licked it. It tasted sweet, really sweet, and she couldn’t help but love it unconditionally and feel like she should vomit at what she just did. Either way her breasts eventually emptied out to where they returned to their &quot;normal&quot; size, and the bucket was filled to the brim with honey.<br />
<br />
Dana then set the bucket to the side and leaned against the wall exhausted, and she knew that later she would probably be expanding her nest again, so her work seemed like I was never done. &quot;Dear god, what do I do now?&quot; Dana thought to herself then she looked to the door, and decided that she should....</p>
