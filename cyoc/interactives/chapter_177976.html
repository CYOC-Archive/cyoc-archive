Alex approached the house Dimas had described, heading around the back as quietly as he could, he found the loose brick which hid Dimas&#39; key to the back door.<br />
(Intelligence skill check DC 10, roll 1, CRITICAL FAILURE)<br />
Not pausing to summarize his plan, Alex drew his sword, jammed the key into the lock and swung the door forward, taking several big stepped forward, he heard the door slam against the wall before swinging back shut with a loud bang.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was THAT!?!&quot; <br />
A sudden rush of activity downstairs caused Alex to panic. <br />
People were coming. Looking around wildly, Alex wasn&#39;t sure what to do. He could see stairs heading up, and he could try to reach them.<br />
(Dexterity skill check DC 10, roll 5, +4 DEX, 9 FAIL)<br />
 Running forward, Alex was only halfway accross the room when he heard the steps running up the stairs, there was no way he wuld make it up the stairs before they would see him. A small alcove just under the stairs was full of hangings coats and aprons, Alex could reach it in time, but he wasn&#39;t sure if he could hide effectively. <br />
(Dexterity skill check DC 15, roll 17, +4 Dex, result 21 SUCCESS)<br />
Alex resisted his first urge to dive into the alcove, instead gently sweeping the hanging clothing to the side while he sidestepped in, sweeping them into place as he tried his best to remain still, breathing quietly.<br />
He could see a small portion of the room through the coats, there were two men in the room, looking around. <br />
&quot;What do you think that was, Corv?&quot; <br />
A small squeaking noise and then a sigh reached Alex&#39;s ears.<br />
&quot;Those damn kids have been throwing rocks at the door, they&#39;ve even torn some of the bricks out of the wall the little blighters!&quot;<br />
The other man visibly relaxed.<br />
&quot;I damn near pissed myself. Those little shits!&quot; <br />
&quot;yeah,yeah I know, but we can&#39;t deal with em&#39;  at the moment. Jakob said if we get any guards snooping around hell slit our throats.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like to slit a guards throat..&quot; The other one chuckled.<br />
&quot;Yeah, me too mate. Now look. I&#39;m gonna go fix those bricks so Jakob doesn&#39;t shit one when he gets back from the pub.&quot;<br />
&quot;All good mate. I&#39;m gonna grab some grub before we head back down.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sweet. Rustle me up some cheese if you find any in the cupboards.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sorted, mate. Sorted.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex heard one leave through the door he came in with, as the other started pawing through the cupboards. Interrupted by a voice from downstairs.<br />
&quot;Oi Corv! Everything all good up there?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, just some of the local ankle-biters being shits. I&#39;m just grabbing a bite then i&#39;ll be back.&quot;<br />
Alex watched as Corv worked his way through the cupboards, until he was almost directly in front of the alcove.<br />
He felt the weight of his sword in his hand. He had to fight at some point, although he was a little worried about the game rendering physical pain accurately.<br />
Alex saw Corv leaning forward into the cupboard next to him, head just out of view. He took a deep breath and lunged forward.<br />
(Attack roll 12 HIT , Corv HP 3/3 damage (1d8) 7. )<br />
The blade slipped right through Corv&#39;s thin shirt, sliding between his ribs and straight into his heart. A small gasp was all he could manage, as Alex slid Corv into the alcove he had been hiding in, hiding the body.<br />
Quietly walking to the window, Alex looked out and saw the other man sliding the last brick into place. Taking position by the door, he readied his sword for the moment it would open.<br />
(attack roll 17, HIT, Kidnapper HP 3/3, damage (1d8) 3)<br />
The door opened, the man stepping forward not registering the person in front of him inside the dark room wasn&#39;t his Corv.<br />
Alex lunged his sword forward, a quiet crunch as it pierced the mans ribcage, followed by a choked couch before the figure fell limp into Alex&#39;s arms. Alex paused for a moment, not sure what to do with the body.<br />
(Intelligence skill check DC 10, roll 19, +1 INT, result 20)<br />
Taking a deep breathe Alex realized he shouldn&#39;t rush things. Quietly he carried the body and placed it into the alcove as well, before taking a quick look around the room he was in. A small puddle of blood was visible where he had killed the 2nd man, but grabbing some rags from the alcove cleaned it up. The blood staining was visible but hard to see in the darkness, and there was no risk of slipping in the puddle now.<br />
Alex then summarized the situation. There was one captive, four kidnappers, two were dead, the most dangerous was out drinking, meaning only one enemy remaining. <br />
Smiling as he approached the stairs Alex remembered the trap, third stair from the top according to Dimas.<br />
(Strength skill check DC 15, roll 16, +4 STR, result 20)<br />
Slowly and carefully Alex went down each step, making sure his heavy armor didn&#39;t thud on any step. Looking closely he could see the small tripwire on the third step which he avoided, making it to the bottom stair.<br />
Looking behind the stairs he could seethe wooden planks headed backwards like shelves. He thought about moving the trap, but it would require some skill, or he could disarm the trap so no risk of him getting hurt on the way back upstairs with Korin.<br />
(Dexterity skill check DC 10 and 15, roll Natural 20, CRITICAL SUCCESS)<br />
Examining the trap, Alex found a simple latch to disarm it, allowing him to disconnect the tripwire. However on removing the tripwire from the bent nail it was connected to, Alex noticed another nail on the fourth step down. Thinking quickly, he carefully lifted the trap onto the next step down, thankful about not making any noise, before connecting the wire to the other bent nail.<br />
The fourth step was now trapped, but he knew he could disarm it again easily if needed.<br />
Peering through the doorway at the bottom of the steps, Alex found a small room with table and four chairs. There were 3 empty plates and mugs on 3 sides, and the fourth side had a nicer chair, a full plate of food and half full mug of ale.<br />
Ignoring the table Alex looked into the next room. A much larger room lit by several torches along the walls. At the far end, a young blonde man was bound, naked and spread eagled while another man gingerly played with his hard cock in one hand, his other sliding four fingers in and out of his loose hole, thick globs of cum dripping from the man&#39;s hand as he kept rythmically pumping. On a bench to their side, was a familiar bottle of oil and an array of yellow, red and blue vials.  All of them empty.<br />
The clothed man was laughing sadistically as he kept withdrawing his hand just before Kiron could reach climax, whimpering, and bucking against his bindings.<br />
&quot;Yeah, thats right. You’s just another little cum dump to serve hard cock now, ain’t ya. None of that i&#39;m to good to teach you guys my &#39;art&#39; bullshit now. Hahaha.&quot;<br />
Alex felt a strange feeling rise up from within him, his cock twitched at the sight but his head was full of anger, fury.<br />
(Attack roll 4, miss.)<br />
Stepping forward and swinging his blade, Alex didn&#39;t notice the vial on the floor until his foot had almost slid out from underneath him. The kidnapper turning around and stumbling sideways in fear.<br />
Regaining his composure, Alex re-balanced and stepped forward.<br />
(Attack roll 3, miss)<br />
The kidnapper grabbed a shield from the shelf behind him, pulling it in front of him just in time to deflect Alex&#39;s blow.<br />
(attack roll 11. HIT. Damage(1d8 + 4 STR) 12. Kidnapper HP 4.)<br />
The kidnapper struggled to his feet, placing the shield in front of him he charged forth, Alex stepping sideways and stabbing his sword behind the shield as the two men fell onto the floor. Rolling the limp figure off of him, Alex saw he had landed the killing blow right into the neck.<br />
Taking a moment to regain his breath, he heard  aloud BANG from upstairs.<br />
&quot;YOU BOYS BETTA HAVE MY GRUB READY!!&quot;<br />
Loud footsteps started plodding down the stairs, before a loud slicing noise split the air and the sound of something heavy tumbling down the remaining stairs.<br />
&quot;ERIN! ERIN COME HELP YA OLD MAN UP WHYDONTCHA&quot; <br />
The loud lumbering noises indicated that whoever it was struggling to get up.<br />
Alex crept to the doorway and saw a thin man with blood gushing from his left ankle and his fore head pulling himself up from the wall.<br />
&quot;ERIN! YA BETTER HAVE TURNED THAT POMPOUS LITTLE GOBSHITE INTO A TOTAL COCKHOUND. PAPA&#39;S IN NEAD OF SOME RELEASE TONIGHT.&quot;<br />
Alex felt bile at the back of his throat, as he stepped forward, not even realizing he was putting all his energy into this next attack.<br />
(Attack roll 15, damage 1d8 + divine fury 1d8+ 4 STR13, Jakobs HP 9/16)<br />
Alex felt the blade slice cleanly through, but he couldn&#39;t bring himself to look at the pitiful creature he had just slain. Turning back around, he heard the body crumple to the floor as he released Kiron, found him some rags to wear  and looked around before heading back off.<br />
On the table was a fancy silk bag of gold coins which Alex assumed was part of the payments Mr Vindegrast had been blackmailed for.<br />
Leading Kiron out and back towards the bathhouse, Alex could only observe the indrawn, drooling mess the man was. Strangely, Kiron had picked up the shield and refused to let it go, babbling incoherently as they walked back.<br />
<br />
An hour later, Alex left the bathhouse with a weakened but alive Dimas, and a newly buffed shield. Mr Vindegrast had provided the antidote to Dimas, and been very grateful at the return of most of his money, going so far as to shove a large handful Alex&#39;s way. Alex had felt an urge to decline the reward but suppressed it. He would need resources to help his brother and buy better equipment. Also the shield had been the property of Billy, who stared at the metal shield for a long time before handing it to Alex. <br />
&quot;It&#39;s yours.&quot;<br />
Kiron was no longer a babbling mess, but instead he was crawling around the room on all fours, rubbing his face against Billy&#39;s loincloth and grinning in excitement as he elicited a reaction.<br />
(Wisdom skill check DC10, roll 11 -2WIS, result 9 FAIL)<br />
Alex had failed to pick up on the vibe that something wasn&#39;t right about Bily&#39;s reaction to the shield, nor did he pick up on the effect that Billy discarding the shield had on Kiron. <br />
The young man&#39;s mind had snapped, fully broken at the failure of his lover to break free from the bathhouses perverse influence and return with him to the real world.<br />
If Alex had picked up on it, he would have realised that he had just returned Kiron Lightbringer the level 5 Cleric, back into sexual servitude alongside his boyfriend, Terror Billy the level 6 barbarian.<br />
Arriving at the barrack just after midnight, Paladin Treydevos approached him. <br />
&quot;There you are initiate! I have heard word of your deeds in the afternoon, but why are you returning so late?&quot;<br />
Alex explained he had been given a token to the bathhouse, helped the foreign diplomat and then saved a masseuse from some kidnappers, Dimas being the only surviving conspirator. Alex struggled to remember all the details, feeling like several important parts were missing as he recounted his tale.  He thought it was strange in the back of his mind.<br />
&quot;Very good initiate. I see all up you have received more then enough reputation. Astounding for only one days work I must add. Go get some sleep. In the morning is your initiation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please wait, I need to speak with him.&quot;<br />
A shorter, slender figure ran forward, his familiar voice perking Alex&#39;s ears right up.<br />
&quot;I told you, you would have to wait until the morning. Our initiate has been through enough today and needs his rest.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know but he knows me, I only need a mome-&quot; <br />
&quot;Enough!&quot; Paladin Treydevos grabbed the slender teen by the arm, causing him to wince, his thin framed glasses almost falling off.<br />
&quot;Wait, Paladin.... David?&quot; <br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; The young man cheered, almost jumping from the excitement. <br />
&quot;Initiate, don’t forget your rank. I am the paladin in charge and I have ORDERED you to rest. You may speak in the morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex watched forlornly as David was dragged away by the Paladins iron grip. Slightly deflated. It had probably only been an hour of real time, but it had been nearly a day of in game time, and Alex had been wanting David&#39;s advice on so many things in this strange game world.<br />
