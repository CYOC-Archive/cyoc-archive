<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jesse and Sam arrived at school, the buzz of chatter and slamming lockers surrounding them as they walked through the entrance. They exchanged a quick nod before splitting off in different directions to head to their respective lockers. As Jesse made his way down the crowded hallway, he could feel eyes trailing over him, following the curve of his floral crop top and the snug fit of his denim shorts. The stares came from all directions; girls gave him lingering, unsettling gazes, as if sizing him up, while boys shot sidelong glances filled with a mix of envy and curiosity. It made his skin crawl, and he quickened his pace, focusing on reaching his locker as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
He kept his eyes on the floor, ignoring the whispers and looks as he approached his locker. The clatter of metal filled his ears as he twisted the combination lock and opened the door, quickly reaching inside to gather his books. He was shuffling through his belongings when a familiar voice called out behind him, breaking through the noise of the hallway.<br />
<br />
“There’s my favorite cheerleader.”<br />
<br />
Jesse froze for a second, recognizing Tyler’s voice immediately. He turned around to see her leaning casually against the lockers beside his, her muscular arms crossed over her chest, the fabric of her tight t-shirt stretching slightly over her broad shoulders. Tyler was dressed in her usual style, jeans that clung to her athletic legs and a shirt that showed off the strength in her arms. Physically, she still didn’t appeal to him, but he could tell from the confident smirk on her face that she assumed she did. For a moment, he hesitated, but then remembered his role. <br />
<br />
“Hey, Ty.” Jesse greeted softly, bending down to grab a few more books from the bottom shelf. His voice came out gentle, almost demure, as he slipped back into the character of “Jess”, the cheerleader who thrived on this attention, even if it made him uneasy.<br />
<br />
Tyler’s pout was exaggerated, and she tilted her head playfully as she leaned closer. “Even though you left me on read last night.” she said, her voice dripping with mock disappointment.<br />
<br />
Jesse’s lips curved into a faint smirk as he straightened up. “Hey, I was tired.” he replied, his tone light. It was true that he had left her messages unanswered. Part of him almost enjoyed the idea of Tyler waiting around, wondering why he hadn’t responded. It was a reversal of his old world, where he was the one left agonizing over why the girls he liked wouldn’t reply to him. The thought made him feel a tiny flicker of satisfaction.<br />
<br />
“Too tired for me?” Tyler teased, her grin widening as she reached out to tuck a strand of hair behind his ear. Her touch was familiar, comfortable in a way that made Jesse feel strange. It was clear she thought she had some kind of claim on him.<br />
<br />
“A boy needs his beauty sleep. How do you think I stay so pretty?” Jesse forced himself to say, his voice carrying a playful tone he didn’t quite feel. The words sounded silly to his ears, and it took a conscious effort to keep a straight face. But Tyler bought into it completely, laughing lightly as if his response was charming rather than ridiculous. She just watched him with that same adoring look as he continued to gather his things.<br />
<br />
As Jesse slipped a few notebooks into his bag, he recalled the fib he’d told his parents last night about Tyler. He had made up a story about having a crush on her, describing how she was always sweet and carried his books for him. It had been a spur-of-the-moment lie, but now he was curious to see if it would actually hold up.<br />
<br />
He glanced at the stack of heavy textbooks on the shelf, and an idea popped into his head. “I’ll let you walk me to class if you carry my books.” he said, arching an eyebrow as if he were offering Tyler some kind of special privilege.<br />
<br />
Tyler’s eyes sparkled with amusement, and without hesitation, she reached out to take the books from him. “Deal.” she agreed, her tone eager as she took the stack from his arms.<br />
<br />
Jesse’s lips twitched into a genuine smile for the first time that morning, a strange mix of amusement and satisfaction bubbling up inside him. As Tyler hefted the books with ease, they began walking down the hallway together, Jesse keeping a careful step beside her. Tyler led the conversation, her voice upbeat as she recounted a story about practice, while Jesse played his part, nodding along and offering the occasional laugh or playful giggle. It felt almost ridiculous, like he was in some kind of school play, acting out the role of the ditzy cheerleader whose every little reaction seemed to make Tyler light up.<br />
<br />
He couldn’t help but notice how Tyler’s face softened whenever he laughed, how she seemed to savor each sound he made, as though it were a prize she’d won. The thought was both unnerving and oddly empowering, the attention making him feel like he was in control, even if it was just by playing a part.<br />
<br />
As they walked, Jesse still felt the weight of the other students’ stares following him. He could sense the looks—some lingering on his bare midriff, others glancing at Tyler with curiosity or jealousy. The intensity of it all was overwhelming, and without even realizing it, he found himself leaning slightly closer to Tyler, as if her presence could shield him from the invasive eyes. It was an instinctual move that gave him a strange sense of security, even though he wasn’t sure why.<br />
<br />
Eventually, they reached the door of Jesse’s first class. Tyler stopped just outside, shifting the books in her arms as she waited for him to take them back. Jesse accepted them with a small, grateful smile, letting his fingers brush lightly against hers. “Thanks, Ty.” he said softly, meeting her gaze just long enough to see the way her eyes lit up.<br />
<br />
“Anytime.” she replied, her voice warm and affectionate. She gave him a little wave before turning to head down the hall, glancing back at him one last time before disappearing around the corner.<br />
<br />
Jesse watched her go and then reluctantly turned to step into the classroom. Another day of surviving in his new role loomed ahead. The monotonous drone of lectures was a welcome reprieve, giving him a chance to fade into the background, where he didn’t need to actively perform as “Jess.” The familiarity of the classroom offered a strange kind of solace, a moment to breathe away from the stares and expectations.<br />
<br />
The day dragged along slowly, each period blurring into the next, and though he was growing a bit more comfortable talking to the boys around him, it felt forced. Topics like makeup, fashion, and beauty came up frequently, and Jesse fumbled his way through, pretending to understand the thrill of a new lip gloss shade or the latest clothing trend. He tried his best to mimic the casual enthusiasm the other boys had, nodding along and adding a “Totally!” here or an “I love that!” there. Somehow, no one seemed to notice his lack of genuine interest, and he felt a small sense of relief at the thought that he was blending in, at least on the surface.<br />
<br />
His comfort level with Vanessa had improved, too. The awkwardness that had once lingered between them was gradually fading, and their conversations now flowed more naturally. Despite this, the peculiar pull he sometimes felt around the other boys remained something he tried to ignore, pushing those thoughts aside and reminding himself that he was supposed to be into girls.<br />
<br />
As he spent more time with the boys, Jesse began to notice just how much they gossiped. In his old life, he had never paid much attention to the social hierarchy or the endless parade of high school rumors. But now, he was being filled in on everything: who was dating whom, breakups, fights, all the petty drama that seemed to dominate their conversations. It was surreal, hearing the way they casually tore each other down or spread rumors, even about their so-called friends. It made him wonder if they were saying things about him too when he wasn’t around. He suspected as much, and it made him uncomfortable, but he reminded himself that he had to play along if he wanted to fit in.<br />
<br />
Talking to the girls, oddly enough, felt like a relief. In his old life, speaking to girls had always felt like navigating a minefield; he’d overanalyze every word, trying to avoid embarrassing himself. Now, though, there was no pressure. No matter what he said, even if it was silly or superficial, it seemed to capture their attention immediately. They were so easy to read, their expressions lighting up with a smile or laughter at his slightest bit of interest. Even if he wasn’t attracted to them, it was fun, almost like a game. A light laugh, a gentle touch on the arm, a playful smile—any small gesture had them practically hanging on his every word. They were eager for his attention, and he found himself enjoying the act of teasing them. The way they looked at him, a mixture of admiration and nervousness, was strangely satisfying.<br />
<br />
As the day wore on, the familiar dread crept back into his mind. Cheer practice was looming, and despite the improvements he’d made with Vanessa’s help, he still felt uneasy. But curiosity tugged at him too; he wanted to see if he’d made any real progress. When practice began, he could tell right away that he was performing better than last time. While he still wasn’t quite at “Jess’s” level, he could now keep up with the choreography and avoid the awkward missteps that had plagued him before. When it came time for stunts, he even managed to pull off a back tuck, a move he never would’ve attempted in his old body.<br />
<br />
Jesse’s teammates noticed the progress and offered encouraging words whenever he nailed a move or even got close. It was surprising how supportive they were, and though he occasionally fumbled or missed a step, there was no trace of impatience or criticism. Their cheers and high-fives made him feel almost welcome, and he couldn’t deny that it felt satisfying to actually make progress.<br />
<br />
When he finally made it home, he shut himself in his bedroom, sinking onto his bed with a sigh. After a day of performing as “Jess”, he needed this private time to recharge, to drop the act and simply exist in his own thoughts. Dinner with his family was a routine he forced himself through, making polite conversation with his parents and joking with his younger brother, trying to keep up the appearance of “Jess” even at home. But when he returned to his room, he allowed himself to unwind, finding comfort in the quiet solitude. Without his usual video games to fall back on, he entertained himself by scrolling through his phone, messaging friends, flipping through social media, and occasionally glancing at the TV.<br />
<br />
The conversations with his friends were simple, a mix of gossip, jokes, and casual chatting. With the boys, he joined in on the usual gossip and harmless banter, while with the girls, he continued his casual flirtations, dropping playful comments that they responded to with enthusiastic emojis or shy replies. The attention was addictive, though it still felt strange, and he occasionally caught himself smiling at his phone, entertained by the easy thrill of being chased.<br />
<br />
As the night wound down, he found himself thinking about Friday—the game, the bonfire, and what might happen with Tyler. He had no idea what to expect, and the thought made his stomach twist with a mix of nervousness and excitement. For now, though, he’d managed to get through another day. He could only hope he’d be able to handle whatever the weekend had in store.</p>
