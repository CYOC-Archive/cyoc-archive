<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Draco and Susan are awakened by the sounds of Damian’s changes. They were the only one because of their advance haring. As they hear Jenifer and Damian start to clean up after Damian’s change the two lay there, looking at each other. Susan looks down at Draco’s sheath. <br />
<br />
“How does it feel?” She asks him in a whisper. “Does it feel overflowing like before?” <br />
<br />
“No.” Draco replies. “And I don’t want to try having sex again, not if it means potentially hurting you.” Draco was still a little freaked out after inflating Susan the last time they had sex. <br />
<br />
Susan takes Draco’s arm. “We don’t know if that was something that will happen from now on or something that the person that did this to everyone did just for fun.” <br />
<br />
Draco pulls away and flips over from his side to his back. “I still don’t want to risk it. What happens if you pop? I wouldn’t be able to handle losing you, especially like that.” <br />
<br />
“We have to try again some time.” Susan tells him. Draco turns his head to face her again as she brings his paw up to her breasts. “If we expect to have puppies at some point, we have to have sex. Also, we can’t live our lives not knowing. Besides, what are you going to do? Just try to hold all that in. You haven’t gone one full day without needing a release.” <br />
<br />
“But…” Try’s to speak as he turns his body back to Susan, but she brings her chest up to his face. Draco sniffs her left breast before giving it a gentle lick. <br />
<br />
“See.” Susan says. “You have a need as bad as I do. Maybe it’s from us being Hybrids, I don’t know. But we can&#39;t hide from it and we can&#39;t change it.” Draco starts licking the breast more as Susan lets out a small, low moan. <br />
<br />
“I see what you mean.” Draco relents before he lays his head on the breast. <br />
<br />
Draco starts thinking about the past week as well as the fact that seven days before, he was still human. Now it’s about to be Sunday again, him and Susan are about to return to school, and they are both completely changed. He is a Hybrid wolf boy, and she is a Part Hybrid wolf girl. Now, his brother is a Part Hybrid Lion from what he could hear from the other room. <br />
<br />
Susan moves her hand to pull Draco’s muzzle back up to her breast. “Please, continue. We can talk more in the morning, but I would love to fall asleep to you suckling on me again. I liked it before, and my breasts weren’t as big. I would like to see how it feels now.”<br />
 <br />
Draco smiles before kissing Susan on her lips. He then lowered his head and returned his attention to the breast he was licking moments before. Soon, he was sucking on the breast, taking a good portion into his mouth. Susan lets out another small moan, this time into her pillow. <br />
<br />
Draco works both of her breasts for a while until Susan is just about to her climax. Susan stops Draco before looking down to see that Draco was also turn on, his member and knot fully out of his sheath. <br />
<br />
“I guess now is a good time as any.” Susan says as she turns to precent herself to him. <br />
<br />
Draco takes a deep breath before placing his tip inside her vagina. “I hope you’re right.” Draco says as he pushes his knot into her. Susan and Draco both moan as they moved in unison on the bed. Soon, Susan is on her arms and knees as Draco is riding her from the back. He could feel them both getting close. Draco soon leans forward in concern as they both climax and he fills up her womb.<br />
<br />
 Unlike the time before, Susan’s stomach and womb didn’t expand like a balloon. There was a noticeable bump, but Susan thought that could be just from her size compared to Draco’s Penis. “See.” She whispers out of breath. “I’m fine. Its mite has been a onetime thing. If we ever find that scent again, we can ask the one behind this.”<br />
<br />
Draco starts crying into Susan’s back, happy that he didn’t hurt Susan. “I love you so much.” Draco whispers. “I don’t know what I would have done… if …. If…” <br />
<br />
Susan smiled and whispered, “Oh, my little Fuzzy Worrier.” They soon went to the bathroom to wait for the knot to go down and clean up before returning to bed.  <br />
<br />
Come morning time, Draco and Susan were the last two to make it downstairs. Damian was already showing off for the rest of the family. As they walked into the dining room, Draco took in his brother’s new form. His new Lion ears looked a little funny on his head, as his dark brown hair didn’t match well to the tan fur. He also noticed that his sheath as about the same size as Draco’s even though Draco was younger. Damian’s tail also didn’t wag like Draco’s, it more just hung lose behind his now nude brother. <br />
<br />
Susan felt bad for the boys’ mom and sister, who have to now see two of the sons in the buff for now on, with their sizable members, and their two girlfriend&#39;s nude as well.  <br />
<br />
“So, what do you all think?” Damian asks his family. <br />
<br />
“You are fuzzy like Susan!” Laura says. “I want a tail too.” <br />
<br />
“Not any time soon I hope.” Mrs. Thompson says with her husband nodding. <br />
<br />
“Thank you all again for letting me into your family.” Jenifer says. “I know it mustn’t have been easy.” <br />
<br />
“Come on now.” Mr. Thompson says. “We are parents to a Hybrid. What’s one more? Besides, you two are in love and were willing to mate with each other. We know that’s a little different for Hybrids and means a lot. Don’t think more on it. Now who would like breakfast. <br />
Today’s the last day before school break end.”</p>
