<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle knocked on the door again, with no answer.  Pulling out a pair of keys he began to unlock the door.  Kody ducked behind the wall as Kyle walked inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello anyone home?&quot; he yelled into the small house<br />
&quot;YES!&quot; Kody sneaks up behind Kyle and screams right into his ear<br />
&quot;AHHHH! Don't do that.... wait who are you?&quot; Kyle says<br />
&quot;Its me Kody&quot;<br />
&quot;Don't mess with me!  Who are you and how did you get in here?&quot; Kyle says quickly becoming hysterical<br />
&quot;No seriously... I'm going to have to explain this from the beginning aren't I...&quot;<br />
&quot;Look I just saw Kody in a police car being driven away you aren't him, and I don't care what explanation you have!  Get out!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kody quickly gets fed up, and plugs the Chronivac remote back into the mini laptop and scans Kyle.<br />
&quot;Well I'm sure you'll understand if I let you sleep on it a little&quot; he says opening the mental tab and changing the mental state to asleep.<br />
&quot;Like hell I'm going to let you sleep...&quot; Kyle eyelids suddenly grew heaving &quot;Let you sleep... sleep....&quot; Kyle falls with a crash the the floor and begins snoring.<br />
<br />
Kody leaned over and lifted the unconscious teen off the floor, and carried him to the bedroom where he dropped him on the bed.  Kyle let out a loud snore as Kody rolled him into the center of the bed.<br />
&quot;That snoring is really getting on my nerves&quot; Kody said typing into the remote 'Does not snore' and hit enter.  Kyle's snoring instantly stopped.  A thought suddenly formed in Kody's mind and he began to laugh.  Kody typed into the Chronivac 'Sings softly while he sleeps'.  Kyle rolled in his sleep and started singing into his pillow.<br />
&quot;Now thats interesting... however he could use a upgrade in pitch and actually learning the correct words would do him good&quot; Kody typed a few more commands into the Chronivac remote and Kyle's sleep singing suddenly became clear and precise, Kody had to admit it sounded better then original singers.  With one last command Kody typed into the remote 'T.V. remotes effect him as if it was a remote for him'<br />
<br />
Kody picked up the T.V. remote and started playing with it, increasing the volume, hitting mute, and even changing languages.<br />
&quot;Life is good&quot; Kody says as he hits the power button causing Kyle to stop singing.<br />
&quot;Got to go change a few things about my life that are... lacking&quot; he says walking out of his house.<br />
<br />
Getting into his tiny rusting car, he drives off.<br />
&quot;lets see what opportunities are out there&quot; Kody says pulling over and opening a newspaper to the job openings section.<br />
&quot;Low pay... low pay... have to actually think.... I didn't even know that was a job people got paid for... I hope thats not what I think it is... Hmm whats this?&quot;  Kody says spotting a modeling audition that was scheduled to happen in about a hour &quot;Perfect with my new body theres no way I woudn't get the job, and the pay is great!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kody pulls out of the parking space and heads off to the audition.  As he pulls into a nearby parking lot a corvette suddenly rushes in front of him and cuts him off.<br />
&quot;What the hell?&quot; Kody screams as he swerves into a fence.<br />
<br />
The other car stops and pulls over the driver gets out and starts to scream<br />
&quot;Did you fucking hit my car?&quot; he yelled<br />
&quot;You just drove me off the road and your worried about your car?!&quot; Kody screams back<br />
&quot;No one cares about that piece of junk!  If there is one scratch on my little baby I'm going to wring your neck&quot;<br />
&quot;Ok thats it if you want to act like a child..&quot; Kody says pulling the chronivac remote out and pressing the scan button.  The mans stats appear on the screen Kody quickly changes the mans age to thirteen, and hits enter making sure that no one but himself would ever know that the young teen was ever the man he was before.<br />
<br />
The man continues to scream as his voice begins to crack raising a few octaves.  His cloths quickly become too large as his body regressed to that of a teenager<br />
&quot;And one last thing&quot; Kody says as he types into the remote 'Sexually attracted to cars' &quot;since you love cars so much thought I might just give your relationship a boost&quot;<br />
<br />
The young teen suddenly grew pale as he saw the corvette next to him... so shiny... so smooth... so-<br />
&quot;Since you wont be needing these anymore I'll just take them off your hands&quot; Kody says pushing the kid away from the Corvette and taking his keys and wallet from him.<br />
&quot;Here kid want a car thats in your league? Go have fun with that one over there&quot; Kody says pointing to his old car.  Kody hopped into his new Corvette and drove off into the parking lot, as he watched the kid take off his over sized shirt and jump into the car.<br />
<br />
Kody walked over to the building that the auditions were being held.  There was a small line outside of aspiring male models, but Kody simply walked past them all and went into the audition room.<br />
&quot;Hy my name is Kody Whiterman, I'm here for the modeling auditions&quot; he says to the female secretary sitting at a desk next to another door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please be seated we are still waiting on one of our judges that should of been here thirty minutes ago... any chance you saw a thirty year old man in a corvette pull in?&quot;<br />
&quot;Um... no...&quot; Kody says nervously<br />
The secretary sighs  &quot;We can't wait any longer for him, I guess we will see you now, but from the looks of it I'm sure you'll do great&quot;<br />
&quot;thanks&quot; Kody said giving her a flirtatious smile causing her to blush.<br />
<br />
Kody walked into the audition room where he saw two judges looking bored.<br />
&quot;Hi&quot; Kody said<br />
&quot;Finally what took you so long!&quot; one of the judges yelled<br />
&quot;Oh I'm not the third judge, I'm Kody Whiterman I'm auditioning.  I was told to just go in since the other judge was...&quot; Kody glanced out the window and saw several police offices walking up to his old car that was rocking back and forth &quot;was... probably not going to show up...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, then I guess we will start without him... Go over there and strike a few poses.  Where is your audition form...&quot;<br />
&quot;I um... forgot to...&quot; Kody says watching the impressed expressions of the judges suddenly become annoyed. &quot;I left it in the bathroom give me one minute&quot; Kody says putting his hands in his pocket and quickly scanning the two judges.<br />
<br />
Kody walked out of the door and into the bathroom and quickly pulled out the chronivac remote.<br />
&quot;Now lets see a two minute transformation for...&quot; Kody hesitates a minute before typing 'easily appeased' into the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
Kody walked back into the audition room, as he passed the secretary he gave her another smile and walked past.<br />
&quot;So did you find it?  It would be a shame for someone with so much potential to not be considered on a technicality like that&quot; one of the judges yells<br />
&quot;I accidentally forgot it at home, I'm sure just this once you could cut me some slack and just pretend I brought it&quot; Kody says giving his best sad face he could.<br />
&quot;Ok, but just this once...&quot; Both judges say at once<br />
&quot;Now do you need anything else?&quot; Kody says<br />
&quot;No I'm happy enough with what I've seen come back here tomorrow, and we will take your first pictures&quot; the other judge says<br />
&quot;Thanks for your time&quot; Kody says as he hears the timer go off on the chronivac.<br />
<br />
Kody left the building with a grin on his face as he heard the secretary tell all the other wanna be models that auditions are over the job had just been filled.  There were a few sneers, a couple gasps, and Kody even heard one person start crying...<br />
&quot;Models...&quot; Kody whispers under his breath as he walks though the doorway.<br />
<br />
Kody walked past his old car the police were covering the naked teen with a jacket and handcuffing him.   Kody walked right past, as he heard one of the policemen say &quot;Says here the car belongs to a Kody Whiterman, theres a address here go send a car to his house and see if you can find him&quot;.<br />
Kody rushes to his new corvette hops in the drivers seat and rushed home.  He had to get there first before the police officer got there.  If he saw Kyle there unable to wake up, or the chronivac he could be in serious trouble!<br />
<br />
Meanwhile...<br />
At the police station Mr. Bishlerp (who still thought he was Kody) walked around in the tiny cell when he heard someone approaching.<br />
&quot;Ya got a visitor&quot; a cop says opening the cell door and moving to the side revealing a man in a suit... Kody's Father<br />
&quot;This is the last time I'm going to bail you out young man!  Go home and stay out of trouble, I'm going to have a word with that old principle of yours...</p>
