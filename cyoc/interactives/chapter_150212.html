<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your serpentine head shakes in resignation as the questions swirling throughout your mind seemed to hold no answer within sight. Even then, it was clear the scent that had filled the hallways had influenced everyone in a myriad of different ways, with similar results.<br />
<br />
Yet, as the question was dismissed, it felt as if an answer made itself known within that same moment.<br />
<br />
The immense feeling of horniness that had drowned out your humanity as you ravaged Tyson&#39;s bloating form, the overpowering sense of dread and sorrow as you had encountered Jessie along with the terrified aura she had radiated as she screamed in fear.<br />
<br />
Your slitted eyes widen in realization, clenching your fangs when the implications were revealed as well. <br />
<br />
The heady, musky scent amplified emotions and feelings of lust; encouraging latex beasts to devolve into sex crazed monsters and humans into fear-soaked wrecks.<br />
<br />
But… it unmistakably has affected you as well, evident by your recent devolvement.<br />
<br />
Splotches of multi-colored latex rippled as you uncaringly walked across them, not bothering to step over or around them. Even in the throes of apathy, your reptilian eyes couldn&#39;t help but take notice that the color of each latex puddle you stepped in began to bleach away into the color of yourself, shifting to a rich gold.<br />
<br />
Jessie took her time to walk around the puddles, knowing full well of its consequences should she touch but a single drop of latex. Your serpentine gaze lands on her once in a while, making sure to not leave her lest she fall into a puddle by mistake. Thankfully, just as your scales, the puddles that took on your color radiated a bright light that illuminates the darkness of the room.<br />
<br />
Reaching the pile of bodies that were your latex companions, an amused sigh slips from your lips as their heads swirled in confusion as they attempted to pull away from each other. Jessie arrived at your side the moment they had managed to separate, but the hard, soiled cocks of Alex and Tyson and Sam&#39;s dripping clit lay out in full display.<br />
<br />
Jessie pressed her mouth into a thin line upon gazing at the spectacle, but she didn&#39;t turn away.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a big girl now, so I&#39;m not phased.&quot; Alex&#39;s large form visibly shrunk in embarrassment as he stood up as quickly as he could, immediately running for his discarded clothes. Taking a moment to regain his bearings, with a shake of his head Tyson rose to his talons to follow his feline friend, who donned his apparel in haste.<br />
<br />
Your gaze shifted back to Sam&#39;s prone form, her breathing slow and labored, the experience no doubt having sapped most of her strength. Standing over her, you extend your hand, thicker and stronger arm bulging as the lizard woman accepted your help in getting her to her feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Martin,&quot; Sam grunted, voice audibly strained yet shrugged off with a smile. Rolling her shoulders and neck, her head tilted in curiosity as she strutted over to her pile of discarded garments. &quot;I have no idea why I did that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hissing in understanding, your gaze falls towards a pile of untouched clothing, unsoiled from any latex; yours. Trudging over to the pile, your graceful form bends as your claws clutch the silver hoodie in longing, as if you had reunited with a lost friend. Slipping on with relative ease, a scowl crosses your jaws as you note a previously unfelt problem. As with all hoodies made out of comfortable wool, your now noticeably thicker arms slid in without struggle; yet as your claws slipped out of the sleeves, a tightness fell across your arms and torso. The silver material conformed to your arms rather embarrassingly, practically skin-tight. Thankfully, the cloth did not tear.<br />
<br />
Sighing a hiss in dull resignation, you knew full well of what had occurred. While able to wear the hoodie, your new body stretched the fiber of the hoodie in order to conform, the cloth feeling uncomfortably tight. Even with your body having bulked up considerably, blush formed across your scales at how exposed you continued to feel.<br />
<br />
Slipping your legs through the black pair of briefs, your tail bent to your will; slipping through the hole made for it. Clasping a hand across your face, you couldn&#39;t help but hiss in embarrassment as the briefs felt even tighter than before, hugging your waist.<br />
<br />
&quot;We do have a bigger clothing set, Martin…&quot; Jessie smirks as you turn towards her and bashfully rub your head. Eyes falling to your second skin, your fangs clench as you held no doubt the garments were practically glued to you. Pulling at the hem of your clothing, you show it to Jessie. <br />
<br />
She nodded in understanding, folding the extra pile of clothes within her hands into a neat set. Arms protectively folding across your chest, your gaze follows the now fully clothed forms of Alex, Tyson, and Sam, the trio walking towards the exit with the last in lead.<br />
<br />
&quot;We should go now. I doubt staying in this smell is good for us, even with your nullifying light in effect.&quot; Sam&#39;s voice echoes sternly as she pulled the handle, the click of the lock resounding throughout the once silent room. Peering out to check for any threats, with a signal the purple lizard woman gestures for you and the others to follow.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can still see that other path,&quot; Alex suddenly speaks, a gruff growl escaping his throat while he was looking down the hallway where the musk lead to. &quot;Should we go after them?&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod, wishing to remove this threat. If the other latex creatures had powers of their own, returning their sanity to use said power for the benefit of good would prove to be a wise decision.<br />
<br />
Returning your nod with a grin, Alex cautiously walked out and began following the trail, Sam&#39;s svelte form trailing not far behind.<br />
<br />
Tyson&#39;s slowly shrinking muscles and returning intellect was visibly seen as he stopped himself from hitting his head on the doorframe, opting to duck under and follow Sam without injury.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll carry this set for that other latex dude you&#39;ll give sanity back. I guess you can protect my 6?&quot; Jessie smiled wearily at you, and you nod, showing the pearly whites in your mouth with a smile.<br />
<br />
As she walked out, you notice a darkening splotch under the hoodie&#39;s sleeve. It spread, making a sharp, hard line that cut through the brightly glowing gold scales. You pull the sleeve, stifling a surprised hiss.<br />
<br />
Sliding the sleeve back to cover the anomaly, the radiance of your scales slowly dies out as you walk out the door. Such occurrences were brought forth by your lapses in personality, no doubt.<br />
<br />
It was your <em>other</em> side.<br />
<br />
Stepping into the hallway, your scales involuntary twitch as an uncomfortable tingling feeling spread across your arms.<br />
<br />
Biting your forked tongue in dread, it was clear the growing black tattoos were carving themselves into your arms. The tingling only intensified as your mind flashed back to the ruthless nature you had demonstrated in taking Tyson.<br />
<br />
You snap free of the daze as a drop of drool trickles down your chin, gaze having involuntarily fallen to the Jock Eagle&#39;s backside.<br />
<br />
Wiping it away with a claw, your reptilian eyes fall to your hand, a hand that clenched into a fist.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Corrupted by my own lust...&quot;</i><br />
<br />
In an instant you recall the image of the twisted maniacal grin of the Mad Dragon.<br />
<br />
An image that shifted to the lust filled smile of the snake.<br />
<br />
Of <em>you</em>.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Are we truly so different?&quot;</i></p>
