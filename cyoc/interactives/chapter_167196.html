<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Alex wanted fun with his brother, Connor wasn´t part of that. Seeing Tony´s pleading look, Alex came up with a solution. He quickly wrote a change that would give him more time and punish Connor. The second he saved the change was the second Connor would have shot his load down Tony´s throat, but it stopped just on his cocks tip. Alex had frozen Connor nearly completely, the only thing Connor could still move were his eyes, but even frozen he was completely aware of his surroundings. <br />
Alex looked at the frozen Connor. It was similar to what Tony had been, only Connor was still flesh instead of glass. Mouth slightly open, eyes wide open and looking around, not understanding what happened.<br />
&quot;Tony, come here.&quot; Alex said, and Tony seems eager to move away from Connor, but is a bit slower in moving to Alex side. &quot;Now, I will punish your friend, Tony. You sit down and watch silently, as the good boy you are.&quot; <br />
Tony felt happy for the praise and for being rescued from Connor, even while he fought mentally. <br />
Connor´s eyes would have widened if they could. What Alex had said now made him fear what would happen to him. He also realized that Alex could have lied about Tony doing this to himself. But he was still trapped and could do nothing but wait what would happen.<br />
The first thing Alex changed was simple, Connor would have to endure the same needs as Tony. Therefore he raised the bar of needing to cum from 95% he was on already to 99% and locked it there. Connor´s need to empty his bladder was also locked on 99%, up from the 20% he was on right now. Grinning, Alex saved these first changes.<br />
Connor had no idea what came over him as his already horny mind got even worse, fogging up his thinking. He didn´t even realize his filling bladder until it felt as if a single additional drop would make it burst. His eyes were by now filled with desperation, neediness and fear.<br />
Even after being used to give his friend a BJ Tony felt a bit of sympathy and guilt for Connor. If he hadn´t experimented on himself, Alex wouldn´t have such ideas, at least he hoped so. It was clear to him what Alex had changed with one look into Connor´s eyes.<br />
Alex then looked over the other options. He found a tab that enabled the change of individual body parts, and quickly found his first target, Connor´s cock. While Tony had made his own cock simply vanish, Alex would make Connor´s part of his punishment. Selecting the bar labeled “Genitals – Cock”, Alex found it was right now set as “Animal – Human”, and by clicking on it some additional options came up, including a sensibility bar in % and check-boxes for example enabling or disabling if the body part could be felt by the owner of the body or if it was connected to said owners body. Alex browsed the options from the bar labeled “Human”, showing various other animals, which made him grin. But he decided against an animal cock for Connor. Instead he selected the Bar labeled “Animal” and switched it to “Inanimate”. Again he browsed over the options, but decided quickly on one of the first and selected “Dildo”. He unchecked the connected box and increased the sensibility greatly. With an evil grin he saved the changes before turning towards Connor.<br />
Connor couldn´t see what happened, but he felt his already hard cock growing even harder, as well as heavier. As Tony and Alex watched, Connor´s cock started to grow a bit and reshaped into a symmetrical looking dildo before falling off. Connor would have moaned in pleasure when the air tickled his now more sensitive cock, not knowing it fell off until it hit the ground with a thud. To that he would have screamed, as that was rather painful. After a short pause Alex moved over and lifted Connor´s now dildo-cock, touching it gently while showing it to Connor, who’s eyes would have widened if they could. The gently touch felt incredible, but Connor still couldn´t cum. Then Alex squeezed it a bit, and Connor would have screamed again in a mix of pain and pleasure. Alex then moved around Connor´s still frozen body and shoved his dildo-cock up his ass with enough force it vanished inside completely. Connor was nearly losing consciousness from the pain that inflicted, but though being frozen his body was unable to do so. The only sign of the pain were his eyes, and he couldn´t even shed tears right now.<br />
Tony felt even more sympathy for Connor, remembering the plug up his own ass, but didn´t know about the increased sensibility or that Connor could still feel his cock in that state.<br />
“I hope you like that feeling, Connor, because your dildo-cock will stay there, frozen on the edge of orgasm. But that’s not all I have planned for you.” Alex said as he moved back to the computer. If Connor could, he would have begged for mercy. Tony fought Alex command and finally was able to speak: “Please, don´t torture him anymore, Alex.”<br />
“Bad boy, I said you should watch silently, Tony” Alex said without turning in an angry voice, resulting in Tony to close his mouth shut and looking guilty for disobeying his owner. Connor could see Tony´s face and while still in pain and horny to no end was shocked how obedient he must be to look this guilty.<br />
Meanwhile Alex made two small changes to Connor, as he clicked on the bar for “Ass” and unchecked the box for openings. It was interesting to see he would be able to add more holes to Connor´s ass, but as he wanted the dildo-cock to stay inside he let it close instead. He also had selected the “Extra” for the inanimate dildo-cock to vibrate a bit.<br />
Connor didn´t feel his ass sealing itself, but he would have yelped as his dildo-fied cock started to vibrate, which for one increased his horniness, but also let it poke his bladder every so often. If he would be able to move right now he would drop to his knees, as his legs felt like jelly.<br />
Alex had only turned shortly before looking for his next intended change for Connor. This time Alex selected Connor´s balls, which were still were they belonged normally. With a grin he just unchecked the connected box and increased the sensibility again. He grinned as he watched them drop from their place, leaving Connor smooth sown there. Alex got up again and collected them from the ground, only to shove them into Connor´s slightly open mouth, one to each side with the ball-sack covering the tongue. The horny horror in Connor´s eyes made him laugh. “I hope you love giving BJs as much as you wanted to get one. But don´t worry, it won´t be mine.”<br />
Connor was horrified as Alex placed his balls inside his mouth. What had Alex planned for him?<br />
Alex returned to the computer and selected Connor´s mouth next. Like with his ass he unchecked the box for openings. Then he chose the tongue for the next changes. He switched it from “Animal – Human” to “Unusual” for the first, then had to type his wish in. Grinning he wrote “Cock” into the bar. Last he had an idea for a bit of extra torture and selected Connor´s teeth.<br />
They were switched from “Animal – Human” to “Unusual” as well, and he typed in “Feathers”, and enabled them to move on their own, without any control by the owner. Grinning he turned to Connor as he saved the changes again.<br />
While Tony and Alex watched Connor felt his lips closing on their own. He felt them connect to each other, but didn´t realize them sealing shut. His tongue started to swell and grow between his balls and teeth, pressing the empty parts of his ball-sack out of the way. Soon he would have gagged as it grown down his throat. Connor didn´t realize what was in his mouth until after the swelling stopped, as he remembered what Alex had said before. Then his teeth shrunk away into small feathers, and soon they started to tickle his sensitive balls on their own, making him moan mentally. Seeing the dazed look, Tony looked askingly at Alex, unable to speak up again. <br />
But Alex ignored Tony´s look grinning and decided to do his pet-brother one small favor. With a text input he made it so that whenever Tony was a good pet for a longer time both his bladder and his balls would slowly trickle their contents out of the tongue-cock Connor had now in his mouth. It would never drop below 90% filled, and whenever he was a bad pet it would fill back to 99% and the time would start anew. Connor in turn, would drink both Tony´s piss and cum, which would sicker into Connor´s full bladder before slowly dissolving and returning it to the 99% lock.<br />
After saving these changes he turned to Tony and explained: “I have programmed a small reward for you, if you are a good boy, but also a penalty for being a bad pet, Tony. I won´t tell you what either is, but it is connected to Connor´s last change. But now I need to assign Connor´s new role in life.”<br />
Tony was conflicted about that. He guessed whatever the reward he got for being good would be, it would be bad for Connor, but he also didn´t want to know what the penalty his owner had set for him. But he had no idea what either could be.<br />
Connor, who by now was sure his tongue was a cock now, could guess it was something bad for him, but was to distracted by his predicament to really focus his thoughts.<br />
Alex thought about the new role for Connor. He didn´t want a second pet, but maybe Connor could be something useful for him. Then it hit him, Connor could be his silent servant. Grinning he started to select and type the changes for Connor to fit that new role.<br />
He selected similar options to what he had on Tony at first, making him mostly obedient to himself, with being compelled to do as tasked even when unwilling to do so. He would be weak like Tony, but whenever his task needed more strength he would have it for said task. He would also gain the knowledge how to do his tasks automatically. As Connor no longer had a mouth, he wouldn´t need to eat or drink anything, and as Tony´s fluids would be dissolving, there wasn´t a need for letting anything out, either. <br />
Next Alex moved to other body changes. As he wanted Connor to be a silent servant, at least to normal body sounds, he changed both the voice option and the body sound option, which contained moans, whines and such, from &quot;Human&quot; to &quot;None&quot;, effectively silencing him. Not that a voice without a mouth could help much anyway. Alex increased Connor´s hearing by both changing his ears from &quot;Animal – Human&quot; to &quot;Animal – Elephant&quot;, even if he reduced the size a bit to fit Connor´s head, as well as raising the corresponding bar in the settings higher.<br />
Then Alex increased the amount of air Connor´s nose could breathe in to compensate the missing mouth, but didn´t change its form. To at least have one way to hear Connor was moving around, Alex selected Connor´s feet next and changed them from &quot;Animal – Human&quot; to &quot;Animal – Horse&quot;, which would turn them into hooves. He only dampened the overall sound of them by half to not being startled if everything else was silent.<br />
Satisfied with most of his changes he made one final change. As Connor wouldn´t be wearing clothes anymore, he deleted them from his body before he switched the body-hair bar from &quot;Animal – Human&quot; to &quot;Animal – Cat&quot;, giving him a fur-coat. He only excluded Connor´s hands, hooves and face from the fur, made it super soft, extremely sensitive and also made sure Connor wouldn´t shed any hairs. With all of that done he hit save and turned around to face Connor.<br />
Connor, still frozen in place, still endless horny with his vibrating dildo-cock up his sealed ass and his balls mercilessly tickled by his teeth turned feathers and a tongue-cock to suck on, was way to distracted to notice what mentally changed within him. When his throat itched a bit he didn´t realize it was his voice-box vanishing. But he felt a pull on his ears, which started growing to the side of his head until they were around half the width of his head, and covered more then three-fourths of it in height.<br />
A shot of air hit Connor´s suddenly naked skin, as his clothes vanished from around him. He felt his feet cramp painfully, but couldn´t even look what happened. As Tony and Alex watched, his feet slowly were shrinking away until it looked like a stump. That than thickened at the bottom, until the bottom was a bit bigger than his leg itself, hardening into hooves. Connor would have yowled in pain as a horseshoe was applied to the bottom, nails worming their way into his flesh to keep them on. The pain vanished shortly after, as Alex hadn´t wanted the nails to harm Connor when he worked.<br />
Suddenly Connor felt as if he was tickled all over as the fur grew in. It was the same light brown shade as his normal hair was. It was a real thick coat of fur, leaving no skin uncovered beside his face and his hands, and his hooves refused to be covered by it as well. Even the back of his now big ears was now much heavier by the thick fur on their backside.<br />
Alex stood up and mover over to stroke the fur on Connor´s body and was satisfied how soft it felt. To Connor that felt incredible, and if he were still able to he would have moaned in absolute pleasure. “Now that you are finished changing, Connor, I want you to know that you will be serving me from now on. When you regain movement, you will hug me before going down to make me a sandwich.” Alex then reactivated Connor´s movement. <br />
A shudder went through Connor´s body before he went over and tightly hugged Alex as if to say thank you, and the sensibility of his fur nearly was to much for him. Then, without pause he left the room to make Alex a sandwich. He couldn´t even stop himself from doing so, not that he could focus that much with all the sensations his body felt.<br />
Alex petted Tony´s head as he turned back to the computer. Tony wasn´t able to complain. Alex made sure nobody would ask about either Tony nor Connor, seeing as if everything was normal to everyone beside the three of them. He also made sure that Connor wouldn´t be overwhelmed by all the sensations before he turned to Tony again. “Now it´s time I gave you a test drive in the way Connor would have done before, so come and give me a bj, my little pet.”<br />
Tony couldn´t fight the command off, and soon was sucking away on Alex cock.</p>
