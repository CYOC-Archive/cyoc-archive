<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt-Lady remembered the parchment. She had no idea if the wand even worked on things like messing with people's heads. Or if there were any more wishes in it! Didn't old stories always say three wishes? And she had used two already!<br />
<br />
She got up and examined the parchment. The soda had blurred everything except 'Point magic wand', 'make a wish', and 'pay a price'. There was something that could have been a seven - or just an 'L'.<br />
<br />
Obviously the next wish would have to be handled carefully. Luckily, Matt-Lady had several years of Dungeons&Dragons playing under her belt. She got out a notebook and began writing a list. Brett's fantasy about the Devil would be useful as well as fun.<br />
<br />
After an hour of thinking, Matt-Lady had compiled a list of powers -<br />
<br />
1) change from Matt Laird to Mrs. DeSoto to a devil-girl that looked like Purgatori from the comics.<br />
<br />
2) change into any chosen person's irresistable sexual fantasy figure<br />
3) instantly grow or get rid of a devil-tail that could be used as a tentacle or a penis<br />
4) shapeshift anyone who swears to be a slave to him/her<br />
5) heal his/her slaves<br />
6) make his/her slaves fall asleep or awaken on command<br />
7) read the minds of his/her slaves<br />
8) let his/her slaves turn invisible and/or walk through walls<br />
9) be super-strong and heal instantly<br />
10) turn invisible and/or walk through walls<br />
11) spit fireballs<br />
12) Have a ten-inch penis whenever he/she wants<br />
13) Get red skin and devil horns whenever he/she wants<br />
<br />
Matt-Lady nodded in satisfaction. She pointed at herself and spoke; "I wish I had all the powers on this list." She figured that if there were only three wishes in the wand, he would be safe and he would still have magic powers.<br />
<br />
A quick zap, and Matt-Lady (now Matt the Devil) spent a half-hour experimenting, confirming all the new powers. He spent a lot of that time using his tail to butt-fuck himself while he jerked off. He thought a lot of the possibilities of the devil-girl form, especially in dickgirl mode with the new devil-tail/penis. Imagine, a cock in asshole and mouth and pussy, plus butt-fucking a boy and getting a blowjob all at once!<br />
<br />
And she was going to make Brett happy, too.<br />
<br />
But she needed a new name. AFter all, 'Matt' just wouldn't do for a bisexual devil, now would it? She got out her old Dungeons&Dragons books and found one that fit.<br />
<br />
Brett woke up to find his mother - or the devil that looked like his mother - naked and caressing his thigh.<br />
<br />
"Enjoy your nap, sweetie?" she asked.<br />
<br />
"Yeah," he answered.<br />
<br />
She smiled and crawled on top of him, taking his now-hard young cock in her hand.<br />
<br />
"Are you my slave, sweetheart?" she asked.<br />
<br />
"Yes, ma'am," he answered, breathing hard.<br />
<br />
She licked his chest, and his scars and cuts vanished. "You called me a devil, you know."<br />
<br />
"Sorry, ma'am," he said.<br />
<br />
"Don't worry about it. You know I'm not your mother." She straddled him and inserted his cock into her pussy. "Want to see what I really look like?"<br />
<br />
Brett gasped, "Yes, Ma'am."<br />
<br />
And she changed into her devil-girl form. Brett stared at her, goggle-eyed.<br />
<br />
"Am I beautiful, Brett?"<br />
<br />
"Oh yes ma'am!" he gasped.<br />
<br />
"So are you," she purred. She leaned over and gave him a long soulful kiss with lots of forked tongue. "And don't call me ma'am. My name is Ishtar. Call me ... 'Goddess'."<br />
<br />
"Y-yes, Goddess."<br />
<br />
She extended her tail and extended it into his asshole, delighting in his wriggling and yelping. She reached down and squeezed the base of his cock where their bodies joined. "Bigger, I think."<br />
<br />
And Brett's cock swelled inside her. She let it swell until she felt she could take no more, then began sliding up and down on it. She also fucked his asshole with her tail, delighting in the feel of ravishing this boy so completely.<br />
<br />
She allowed her cock to grow to it's fill ten inches and told the wide-eyed boy, "Jerk me off! Now!"<br />
<br />
Grabbing her cock with both hands, Brett pumped furiously as Ishtar writhed on his organ and tail-fucked his ass. Her eyes rolled back in her head and she squealed and cried out and came harder than ever before in her life, spewing sperm into Brett's ass and onto his chest while taking his load into her spasming pussy.<br />
<br />
Ishtar looked down at the sperm-covered boy and smiled. "Eat my cum, Brett. All of it."<br />
<br />
Without hesitating, Brett began to eat the white sperm off his own chest. Ishtar heard his thoughts, about how hapy he was and how he loved her.<br />
<br />
When he was finished, she dismounted and discovered that her magic had given him a cock easily a foot long. She enjoyed licking it clean and slurping their mingled juices off of it, making Brett moan and groan in pleasure.<br />
<br />
They cuddled for a while and she asked her boy-toy, "Now, sweetheart, what do you want, more than anything?" She saw the answer in his mind before he could even speak. "Oh! You want revenge. Okay, I can do that."<br />
<br />
They looked out the window and saw Bryan DeSoto and Don Desoto through their windows. They were joking it up and preparing dinner. Ishtar felt flashes of memory in Brett's mind, of being yelled at, chased out of the kitchen, not spoken to for entire days, while the older two boys got all the love and affection.<br />
<br />
Ishtar felt angry for him. "Don't worry, sugar. You'll get yours. I promise." She kissed him and said, "Put on your clothes and try to lure your idiot father outside. We'll deal with him first."<br />
<br />
Brett nodded and quickly got dressed, ignoring the sperm leaking out of his well-used rectum. Ishtar was tempted to clean him up, but business would have to come first. This was an ideal opportunity to test the wand.<br />
<br />
She heard Brett yell, "Hey Dad! You old douche-bag! You smell like sour farts!"<br />
<br />
That wasn't as subtle as Ishtar would have liked, but Don DeSoto charged out of the house, belt in hand, screaming vulgar threats.<br />
<br />
Quickly, Ishtar pointed the wand at Mr. DeSoto and said, "I wish Mr. DeSoto was Brett's bitch."</p>
