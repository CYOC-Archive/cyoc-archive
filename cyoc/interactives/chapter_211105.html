<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff spent all day walking the fence line. He didn&#39;t make much progress being a species of an animal that spends most of it&#39;s time grazing on grass. Jeff couldn&#39;t stop his body from feeding itself. The worst part was, the more time Jeff spent as a donkey, the more it came to irritate him. He was getting sick of the taste of grass, and his need to listen to his instinct to graze. His hands and fingers being &quot;locked away&quot; in a numbing sort of way was strangely becoming painful in his mind. He HAD to stretch his fingers! The constant itchiness all over his body that he could never scratch, especially in his butt hole, was getting to the point that was becoming harder to ignore. But graze away he did. <br />
<br />
As the sun was beginning to set on his second day as a donkey, Jeff finally finished his day-lomg meal. He had found he had migrated somewhere towards the middle of the field, but he was becoming mentally exhausted again. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, I can&#39;t spend another night as a donkey,&quot; he thought. &quot;I must find a way out of here!&quot; <br />
<br />
But his eyes were becoming heavy, and his donkey body&#39;s instincts began to click in again. Jeff only managed to take one heavy-hoofed step, before his eyes closed. Jeff soon fell asleep....<br />
<br />
It was yet another nightmarish dream. He dreamed about his hands and fingers closing into a couple of hooves, to be locked away forever. He could never pick anything up again. He couldn&#39;t push any buttons. Couldn&#39;t drive a car, nor dress himself. Anytime he tried doing something with his hands, he&#39;d thump his hooves onto whatever he tried touching instead. <br />
<br />
He tried opening a door and found hooves instead of hands that thumped on the door knob. He tried again and again at gripping the knob, but just kept pounding hooves onto it instead. He tried his other hand, but that too was a god damn hoof! He began pawing at the knob with both of his hooves over and over again, driving himself into a panic....<br />
<br />
&quot;Heeee hhaaww!!&quot; Jeff suddenly brayed loudly and wake up with a start! <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it was only a...&quot; &quot;Haaaww heee hhhaawww...&quot; He stopped &quot;talking.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My voice!&quot; He thought to say. &quot;Haaaww heee hhhaawww!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Haaww! His eyes flew open and he was greeted with the sight of a large gray-furred body behind him! And worse....<br />
<br />
HOOVES! Those damned dreaded hooves! <br />
<br />
&quot;Hee hhaaww hee hhaaww!&quot; He brayed, trying to deny that he was a donkey. That it wasn&#39;t a dream. That he had hands! But no! Hooves! He couldn&#39;t pick anything up or write anything! All he could di, was paw at the ground and walk upon them! <br />
<br />
The beginning of his third day was much like his first two. The panic-driven session as described above, followed by a period of eventually having to calm down and collect his thoughts. Only &quot;calming down&quot; and &quot;ollecting his thoughts&quot; was getting harder with each passing day. Each new day, would bring with it and entire day of being stuck to all fours. Of having and living with a disgusting body that was incapable of convenient human movement. Incapable of expressing thoughts beyond a few basic emotions. Incapable of any sort of dignified identity other than &quot;just another farm animal.&quot; <br />
<br />
Well, collect his thoughts Jeff eventually did. And calm down he did as well. The start of a new day, when the sun hadn&#39;t even started rising yet. Jeff knew he had to escape. He was in middle of trying to find either a break in the electric fence that his body was terrified of going anywhere near, or some way to break it. But first....<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, fuck! Not grass! Not again...!&quot; he thought, as his body took over once again, to again feed itself over the course of hours. Jeff was sick of the taste of grass. He was sick of having to eat like the god damn animal he was. Face to the earth. Lips curled back,. Big obnoxious unbrushed yellow-green-black front teeth grabbing yet another clump of grass. Head pulling back and upwards to tear the grass from the ground. The sound of the tearing. Then the chewing! The constant chewing and slimy mastication of green plants! Jeff saw what it looked like from random cows on the field. His fellow farm animals. Their teeth stained dark green, nuclear yellow, and outlined in black. He saw the horrendous slimy green mixed with thick saliva. He hated the idea of being stuck &quot;tasting&quot; that exact viscous slimy mix inside a grazing animal&quot;s mouth. But no matter how much he tried, he couldn&#39;t overcome the necessary survival instinct of feeding himself. Jeff could be crying tears the entire time he&#39;s stuck having to graze. He stuck with his own thoughts. His own fears. His own constant nagging in his mind of his handless hooves, itchiness, stuck on all fours, and unable to speak. But the hooves! They&#39;re the worst! They&#39;re like boots stuck on his feet, or rather, where his hands should be, that he can&#39;t ever remove. That are now a permanent body part. <br />
<br />
Time slowly passes. His belly begins to feel full. Unfortunately, constant uncontrollable smelly bowel movements keep making room for more. There is only typically a couple of hour time window Jeff has before he goes back into grazing mode. <br />
<br />
Now he&#39;s free to move about at will. For a little while. He begins to restart his survey of the field, as he walks in a straight line back to the closest portion of fence. He gets as near to the horrible snap-crackle-popping of his inanimate nemesis as he dares. He takes a moment to decide which direction to begin walking along the inside of the fence line. He decided it doesn&#39;t matter. He&#39;ll just pick a direction, and go. Which he did.<br />
<br />
Walking at as brisk a pace as his out-of-shape donkey body could go (which is a faster pace than a fit human, but slower than a horse at a normal walk), Jeff continues his journey around the field for....well...he has no way of keeping track of time. An hour, at least. Maybe not quite that long. He felt the first stirrings of his insides since he finished grazing. Several plops of manure slip out of his itching hindend. He knew he didn&#39;t have long, so he quickened his pace. <br />
<br />
There! Dead ahead! A building! He could barely make out its outline with his poor vision. But he could clearly see a boxlike shadow ahead. <br />
<br />
Moving with purpose, Jeff the Donkey headed in that direction. It didn&#39;t take long. It was closer than he expected. His vision really wasn&#39;t all that reliable. Not like his hearing and sense of smell were. Which was another humiliating disturbance to his human conscience stuck as a donkey. <br />
<br />
Anyway, Jeff approached what turned out to be the stable! A really large spacious One, at that! One side of the building has its wide double doors open, and there were several more animals he hadn&#39;t yet met just milling around in there. This farm sure gives it&#39;s animals pretty free range. Jeff was lucky in that one matter at least, if swapping places with a random ass donkey on purpose could be considered &quot;unlucky.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff tentatively wandered inside the the building. There was a clear opening on the other side!<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a second!&quot; he thought to himself. &quot;If I&#39;m not mistaken, the fence ended at the side of the building.....&quot; <br />
<br />
Without much thought, Jeff quickly trotted through the other side of the stable. Upon exiting, he....he was.....he was FREE! He was suddenly on the other side of that fence! <br />
<br />
&quot;Heee hhhaawww!&quot; he gave an excited bray, which quickly dashed his celebration. He was still a fucking donkey! But he had to get out of there....<br />
<br />
There was a dirt road that led from that stable. Jeff couldn&#39;t see very far, so he decided to stick to following that road. He also had a growing fear that whoever owns or runs this farm, may see one of his animals escaping. So he went at a quick trot down this dirt lane. It eventually led to a paved driveway!<br />
<br />
Quickening hus pace, Jeff too his first steps on hard pavement. The &quot;Clip-cloping&quot; of his hooves rang out in his ears! A rush of mixed feelings over came him.<br />
<br />
For one, Jeff periodically becomes &quot;,used&quot; to having hooves when his mind is focused on something. He was also used to the dull thudding sound of his hooves on soft grass and dirt. The sharp &quot;click&quot; noise of his front right hoof, brought a rush of the reminder that he&#39;s a hooved animal! <br />
<br />
For another, it was a brand new sensation of his degraded situation. Only hooves animals could make that particular sound on hard pavement! In addition to becoming utra aware of his hooves, he also became ultra aware of the donkey shape of his body he could clearly see and feel back there. His sexual fetish began to click in once again! That sound, in short, made him hard.<br />
<br />
Now Jeff is stuck with a male donkey&#39;s sexual frustration, with his feeling of degradation, humiliation, and frustration over having hooves again! All while he was in the middle of his best chance at escaping this farm and trying to....to.....to what...? Exactly...?<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it doesn&#39;t matter!&quot; he thought to himself. &quot;I&#39;m not quite free yet! I have to get away from here first!&quot;<br />
<br />
And so, steeling his resolve and forcefully burying his feelings as much as possible, Jeff made a bolt down the paved driveway. He hated this new sound his body naturally makes in it&#39;s movement on pavement. But he went right on to ignore it to get out of this place. <br />
<br />
It felt like it took eons to Jeff, but in reality, it was only a few minutes before he came to an actual road! He stopped for a second to attempt to look both ways and decide which way to go. But....<br />
<br />
A) once again, he couldn&#39;t see very far. And....<br />
B) he had no idea which direction led to where! Hell, he didn&#39;t even know where in this entire world he was even located! <br />
<br />
With a forlorn bray-huff, Jeff decided to go in the direction that he thought was downhill. Downhill might he good. It might lead to a stream. He could follow that stream. But he didn&#39;t think that far ahead. It was always one challenge to overcome after another first.<br />
<br />
So Jeff took a left on the road, and trotted for a little ways.</p>
