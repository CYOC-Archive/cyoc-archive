<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andy woke up the next morning rock hard. 12 inches of godly cock jutted out from his now more muscular thighs. 100 pounds in a week would result to about 14 pounds of muscle a day. After this first night, it seemed that most of it went to his thighs. Andy wrapped one massive hand around his massive dick but remembered that he had somebody who could help him with this now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hobbit!&quot; he called his voice now a deep, commanding bass.<br />
<br />
Hobbit appeared quickly. &quot;Yes, Sir?&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy pointed at his crotch and Hobbit immediately got to work. As an expert, Hobbit closed his mouth around the tip of the cock and began working his way toward the base, his tongue expertly gliding along the veiny skin. Andy closed his eyes as he lay in bed. It wasn&#39;t long until he he came a supersized load into his servant&#39;s puny mouth. Hobbit swallowed every last drop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get cleaned up and dressed,&quot; commanded Andy. &quot;We&#39;re going to the library. I need to do some &quot;reading&quot; and I want to check out how my new voice and other changes affect everybody else.&quot; Hobbit said nothing, just made his way to the bathroom and began showering.<br />
<br />
Andy wouldn&#39;t waste his time showering. He wrote in the book, &quot;I now have the ability to clean myself up at will. When I use this ability, it will be like I&#39;ve just showered. I will always always exude a musky alpha pheromone that everybody thinks smells good.&quot; The words took hold in the book and Andy was suddenly clean. His hair straightened out and the stench of sweat disappeared from his body, replaced by a scent that Andy couldn&#39;t quite place. It smelled like a combination of cologne and wood. It was incredibly masculine and arousing.<br />
<br />
Still naked, Andy decided to check his weight. He wanted to keep track of his growth, so he stepped on a scale. Andy&#39;s weight had gone up as he&#39;d gotten taller, but not by nearly as much as it was about to. 100 pounds of muscle would truly turn him into a titan among lesser men. Before he&#39;d written about his muscle growth, he&#39;d been about 195 pounds. The scale showed that he was now weighing in at 210 pounds. Andy was excited that the 15 pounds had gone to his thighs. He knew that throughout the week the muscle would go to his chest and arms and he couldn&#39;t wait. <br />
<br />
As Andy went to grab his clothes, he noticed that the pair of sneakers he had looked small in his massive hands. He had gotten this pair of size 13s at the mall a while back. That&#39;s when he remembered. He had been so distracted by all the other changes he&#39;d made that he&#39;d forgotten that he was going to end up being 6&#39;9&quot; by the end of all of this. Andy grabbed his tape measure and moved the poster on the wall, revealing his height tracker. The last height listed was 6&#39;5&quot;. Andy measured and he was now 6&#39;7&quot;. He marked it on the wall. Thanks to his changes, all of his clothes would grow to fit him. He picked up the size 13 shoe and watched it in his hand as it got bigger. The tag in the show now showed a size of 14. Andy dressed himself in a pair of grey athletic joggers that showed off his massive bulge, his now size 14 sneakers, and a tight black tank top. His upper body hadn&#39;t grown much muscle yet, but it wouldn&#39;t be long now.<br />
<br />
Andy glanced back at his height chart. At 6&#39;7&quot;, he was almost done getting taller. He liked the feeling of growth and 6&#39;9&quot; didn&#39;t even seem that tall to him anymore. He grabbed the book and adjusted his height growth for the remaining months. By the end of his growth, Andy would now be 7 feet tall. The rest of his measurements adjusted themselves in the book. Andy would wear a size 18 shoe by the end too.<br />
<br />
There was one area where Andy wasn&#39;t growing anymore. His glorious 12 inches were an instant change. At the time, he hadn&#39;t wanted to wait for the growth. But now, thinking about being 7 feet tall, Andy decided that 12 inches wasn&#39;t enough. He wrote in the book that over the next week as his muscles grew, his already huge dick would grow two inches longer, stopping at a massive 14 inches fully erect. Soft it would now be 10.5 inches with a girth of 9.5 inches. He thought back to when he grew it the first time and added that it will look even more powerful. His testicles would grow proportionately and he would produce 6 times as much cum as the average man of his age. <br />
<br />
As Andy led the way out of the dorm and Hobbit followed, he moaned in his new deep voice, thinking about how much growing he&#39;d do in the next week. He was turning into the strongest, tallest, smartest, most masculine human to ever walk the earth and he couldn&#39;t wait.</p>
