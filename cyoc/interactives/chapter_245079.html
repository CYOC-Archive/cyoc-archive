<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hailey Meyers sat in the passenger seat of the lead van with two more behind her, her crew had weapons ready in case anything should happen. They made their turn off going from the paved road onto a gravel road, before it became just a dirt path through the woods. Hailey hadn&#39;t liked that Lilith and Alyssa had made their escape from the warehouse of the Superior Church before she or her team could go in and arrest Sophie Kane.<br />
<br />
Hailey had intended on entering the Church&#39;s base sooner, but she had more urgent matters to attend to beforehand. After dealing with Fukushu and Alexa, Hailey ordered her reserve troops inside. A sweep of the area showed the entire Kane family had vanished, Hailey wondering if perhaps some of Lilith&#39;s allies assisted in the escape. Lilith Kane after all had some very powerful friends. The only thing she grateful for was Sophie Kane had remained quiet while out here in the middle of nowhere.<br />
<br />
The S.P.E.A.R. vans soon arrived at the residence seeing the mailbox that had the names &#39;Kane&#39; and &#39;Hoti&#39; on it. Hailey got out first, followed by the rest of her team.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everyone stay up front, I want to try and be civil about this.&quot; Hailey said.<br />
<br />
Hailey didn&#39;t have to wait for Lilith and her family to come out, as they were already waiting outside for her as they came out of their vans.<br />
<br />
Lilith and Eliana stood in front of their daughters, with Alyssa and Rebecca standing just a little ways behind them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lilith, you know why I&#39;ve come here today. You&#39;re harboring a known fugitive in the supernatural community.&quot; Hailey said firmly looking Lilith in the eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s my older sister you&#39;re talking about, and she was manipulated by a massive bitch who thankfully can&#39;t do anything to her anymore.&quot; Lilith said looking Hailey right back in the eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lilith, I know she&#39;s your sister, but your sister has a track record almost as long as her own father did. She has to be brought in for justice.&quot; Hailey said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Justice must be blind because my aunt hasn&#39;t done anything wrong for a week and that has to prove that she&#39;s not a threat to you anymore.&quot; Alyssa said speaking towards Hailey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alyssa,&quot; Hailey sighed sadly. &quot;I really don&#39;t want to tell you all the messed up things your aunt did in the past. But she has to be brought in for her crimes. She has done unforgiveable things over time.&quot; With a motion of her hand, Hailey instructed her team to exit their vehicles. The heavily armed team now awaiting orders. &quot;Please don&#39;t make this harder than it has to be. A simple I&#39;m sorry won&#39;t fix this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know, I think if these ladies are willing to forgive, so too would the church.&quot; A male voice now said as Caleb Moreland stepped out of the Kane house, carefully walking outside. Although the veteran hunter stood confidently, it was apparent he was still not a hundred percent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Caleb Moreland, I might&#39;ve guessed you&#39;d be here. Just like your dad, you&#39;ve got a big heart.&quot; Hailey said crossing her arms and giving Caleb a little smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, what can I say? My dad was tough, but he was also a loving man. That&#39;s why I&#39;m here, because Lilith and the rest of her family should be allowed to look after her sister now that she doesn&#39;t have anyone else in the world.&quot; Caleb said standing in front of Lilith with Hailey staring straight back at Caleb and giving a little chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you&#39;ve gotten better since your accident, but come on. I can tell you&#39;re not back to 100% yet.&quot; Hailey noticed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, no, that would be really stupid of me. Luckily, I didn&#39;t come here alone. Lilith has some good friends that also came out to support her.&quot; Caleb smiled and nodded towards the house again.<br />
<br />
Hailey was surprised to now see Jolie, Bob, Set, and Bong-Cha/Bomb-Pop coming out of the cabin last as Jolie casted a spell to darken skies allowing Bong-Cha to step outside without any worry. All of Lilith&#39;s friends now stood beside her and the rest of her family.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Death Riot!? When did Bomb-Pop decide to front a group again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Call it a reunion tour,&quot; Bong-Cha said, the vampire now lighting a cigarette. &quot;And it&#39;s Bong-Cha. You touch Lilith&#39;s sister, you&#39;re going to have to go through me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jolie added. Hailey shook her head taking a deep breath as she wearily eyed Death Riot&#39;s unofficial hype man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just because you called up your old friends for help, doesn&#39;t mean I won&#39;t hesitate to go inside and arrest Sophie myself. You all know you&#39;re just prolonging the inevitable. So I&#39;ll tell you one last time Lilith, and you too Caleb. Hand over Sophie Kane, now.&quot; Hailey said with her arms at her side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on,&quot; Caleb called. &quot;I figured you would be stubborn about this Hailey. So, I&#39;ve got one last surprise for you. Come on out!&quot; Caleb called towards the house.<br />
<br />
Hailey was shocked and surprised as was the rest of her team that now stepping out of the house, was Dracula himself. The seven foot vampire lord furrowed his brow, a low growl emanating deep within his throat as his eyes turned a deep red.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lord Dracula, this is quite the surprise. How may I ask did you get wrapped up in this situation.&quot; Hailey asked as Dracula walked towards the front stepping in front to stand next to Caleb.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m doing a favor for my grandson, Duke. And if my grandson needs my help with anything important, I&#39;m there for him, as I am for all my grandchildren and great grandchildren.&quot; Dracula explained his voice low, chilling Hailey&#39;s agents to the bone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Director Meyers, you still feel like trying to take us all on?&quot; Caleb rhetorically asked.<br />
<br />
Hailey looked at the members of Death Riot who all looked determined to stand their ground. She also looked at Lilith and Eliana, who equally looked determined to defend their home and Sophie. Finally Hailey looked at Caleb and Dracula as they both stared her down. Hailey could see the fire inside Dracula&#39;s eyes, as she could see with every vampire thanks to her own vampiric abilities.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ma&#39;am, what are your orders?&quot; One of her soldiers asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stand down. This is clearly a fight none of us would win. I want all of you to get back in the vans, I have some last words to exchange with the residents.&quot; Hailey said as her soldiers all began getting back into the vans.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lilith, you certainly haven&#39;t made this easy. I won&#39;t arrest Sophie today or any other day, provided you make sure she keeps in line. I chased that woman down for years and saw plenty of agents die directly or indirectly because of her.&quot; Hailey said as she now began to walk back to her van.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh and Caleb,&quot; she called, turning her head slightly as she offered the hunter a smile. &quot;Well played.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! What about my grandma? Can&#39;t she go free too?&quot; Alyssa asked concerned for her grandma Mary/Misery.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your grandmother still has a little while before we&#39;re able to release her back into your custody. Although she has been on good behavior as of late, so that&#39;s promising.&quot; Hailey said as she got into the van and the S.P.E.A.R. vans all now began to drive away.<br />
<br />
Lilith and Eliana breathed a sigh of relief seeing them all finally leave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for showing up Caleb, I don&#39;t know if we could have done this without you.&quot; Lilith said thanking Caleb and shaking his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, nothing to worry about. I&#39;ll do what I can to help you and Eliana out.&quot; Caleb said as Eliana nodded towards Caleb.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, well you all talk amongst yourselves, I gotta get back to my own family.&quot; Claeb said as he got into his truck.<br />
<br />
Lilith looked around as Alyssa and Rebecca were talking with the other members of Death Riot and asking them about the old days.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like to go inside with you to see how your sister is doing.&quot; Dracula said as Lilith nodded and led him inside while Eliana stood outside with the girls as the girls were amazed at the stories that Death Riot was telling them.<br />
<br />
Sophie Kane was sitting on the couch inside the house with her legs curled up to her chest and holding a pillow between them. Nearby on a table was the fairy Briar, who was resting up before she would be taken back to the fairy kingdom. She had stayed behind to unlock Sophie&#39;s memories that Linda Michaels had made Briar block out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sophie? Sophie, it&#39;s okay, they&#39;re gone. You don&#39;t have to worry about them.&quot; Lilith said reassuring Sophie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lilith, I....I don&#39;t understand how you can protect someone like me like this. I....I&#39;m a monster, a killer. I&#39;m.....I&#39;m just as cruel as our father was. The world is going to hate me forever for what I&#39;ve done.&quot; Sophie said almost to the point of tears.<br />
<br />
Dracula hearing this shook his head and put a reassuring hand on Sophie&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your family, your real family is the one that helps make you. Not the rest of the world.&quot; Dracula said as Sophie gave a soft smile and nod to Dracula as a thank you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sophie, I know this is going to be hard for you, but I promise you, Alyssa and I will help you adjust. You&#39;re still my family, my sister and I want to help you, and so does Alyssa. She believes in you. Believe in her.&quot; Lilith said as she looked out at her joyful niece and gave a little smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;She really believes in me?&quot; Sophie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, she does. She&#39;s got a kind heart. Like mom had.&quot; Lilith said as tears now filled Sophie&#39;s eyes thinking about her mother as she began crying and Lilith held her in her arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, thank you......&quot; Sophie said crying into Lilith&#39;s arms as Lilith gave a smile and patted Sophie on the back.<br />
<br />
Dracula could see it was his time to go now and quietly made his leave.</p>
