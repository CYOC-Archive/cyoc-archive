<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam just sat on the beach looking down at himself, now herself, her breasts where hidden by the same black t-shirt he had been wearing before he transformed both into a women and a mermaid. Inside his head, his voice was screaming his head off but his new shapely lips didn’t move and her new voice didn’t come out. It was as if his brain was being transformed a long with his body, he began to hear a familiar but female voice in his head. <br />
<br />
“Isn’t this great.” Said this female voice, <br />
<br />
“Who are you?” inquired Sam’s voice inside his head.<br />
<br />
“I am you, but I guess I or rather we can go by Samantha so we can keep the name Sam.” Answered the female voice, Samantha “Don’t we look drop dead beautiful.”<br />
<br />
“I do.” Answered Sam his masculine voice becoming slightly feminine as he looked at the shapely breasts hidden under the T-shirt, they had to be C cups if not D cups she would have to take off the T-shirt for a better look. The long jet-black curls was silky smooth as one of her hands reached up and touched it. <br />
<br />
“No this is wrong.” Said Sam out load however his voice was feminine just like it was in his head.<br />
<br />
“Maybe.” Said Taylor beside him/her as she grabbed her head and turned it to look her in the eyes. Sam/Samantha’s heart took off as he/she looked into Taylor’s blue eyes, she had changed but changed for the better. <br />
<br />
Inside Taylor’s head a battle was also going on but not as tough a battle as what was going on within Sam’s, maybe it was the fact she was still a women but her human side was fading as she accepted mermaid hood and the call of the sea. <br />
<br />
“Maybe, it is wrong, but it feels so right.” Said Taylor as she pulled her now mermaid boyfriend into a kiss. <br />
<br />
It was as if a bomb had gone off inside Sam’s head, his male side and the new mermaid side of his mind embraced the kiss full hearty, as Taylor ran a hand down her new longer neck and pulled her a little closer. <br />
<br />
“I love you no matter what, be you a man or a mermaid you are my love.” Said Taylor in a husky voice as pulled Sam down onto her lap bending over and kissing her gently while one of her hands brushed the slit where her new womanhood was hiding behind. <br />
Sam had never imagined kissing another man yet alone being a women kissing a women, while he had daydreamed of a three way with Taylor a few times she was always more then enough for him. Now Samantha was enjoying kissing another women as one of her hands moved up and wrapped around Taylor’s head pulling her down making the kiss deeper while the other moved to message the much larger and more sensitive breasts of her girlfriend.<br />
<br />
Inside Taylor’s head there was some screaming as her human side fought against the end even as her mermaid said moaned in pleasure as she kissed her black fin beauty. Sam had become a drop dead gorgeous women, silky smooth hair, a black tail which shinned in the warm sunlight and she could feel the wetness coming from her girlfriend’s sex. <br />
<br />
“What about kids, we want kids.” Said her human self in an attempt to regain control of her mind, both herself and Sam had talked about having 3 or 4 kids when the time came, being both mermaids would mess with that. <br />
<br />
“Oh…I have a plan.” Said Taylor’s mermaid self-back as she broke the kiss with Sam. <br />
<br />
“That was wonderful.” Said Sam’s sexy voice<br />
<br />
“Same here, I do have an issue we both want kids right?” inquired Taylor in a whisper.<br />
<br />
“Of course, you will make a wonderful mother and I will make a great fath…” started Sam only to realize she couldn’t father children anymore. <br />
<br />
“I have an idea, if you are open to it.” Said Taylor as she moved her head a bit to focus on Rose and more so on Nate.<br />
<br />
Nate was Sam’s beast friend and Rose had been Taylor’s best friend for just as long, both had transformed into beautiful and handsome merpeople that turned both of them on.<br />
<br />
“God no!” cried both human sides of the two new mermaids as they faded away even more into darkness.<br />
<br />
“I like it.” Said Samantha as they moved to the water’s edge and down into the sea, they didn’t go far coming back up to the surface by Nate and Rose.<br />
<br />
“You look wonderful, I just had to share this gift with you two.” Said Rose as she hugged Taylor and she hugged her back.<br />
<br />
“Thanks, maybe we can share something else as well.” Said Taylor as Rose raised an eyebrow but followed her friend’s gaze toward her boyfriend.<br />
<br />
“There has always been jokes about us having a four way? How about we do a poly relationship instead, both Taylor and I want kids and Nate seams like a great fit.” Said Sam in a smooth sexy voice, a voice which turned both Rose and Nate on just as much as it did Taylor.<br />
Rose had never dreamed about being in a poly relationship or even a lesbian relationship but she loved both Taylor and Sam, not as much as she loved Nate but more then enough. Maybe it was her new mermaid self or maybe she would have accepted it as a human but she nodded her head yes. <br />
<br />
For his part Nate was dumbfound as he looked at Rose nodding her head yes as she moved to swim beside Taylor and Sam in a line before him. A gorgeous blonde hair mermaid with a purple tail, a radiant red haired mermaid with a red tail whom he loved with all his heart and a black haired mermaid who seamed to give off sexiness just by swimming there and they all wanted him. If they where human he would have thought he was dreaming and as a merman he thought the same. Part of his human self which was still fighting said this was wrong, that the black-haired mermaid had been his best male friend only minutes ago. Still he nodded his head yes as all four of them swam together and embraced. <br />
<br />
For her part Shelly smiled, it had been a wonderful day so far, three new mermaids and a merman all in a relationship together poly relations where common enough in Atlantis, gay and lesbian couples did it a lot just to have kids even if they slept more with their main same sex partner. These three would be having children within months and that was the goal of this whole mission to turn humans to replace the population lost caused by human pollution.<br />
<br />
Still part of her felt wrong, that Sam seamed to fight mermaid hood longer and fought the sea as well. Was it wrong to turn them into merpeople, they seamed to be enjoying their new life or was it a false front? Her parents had said they enjoy their new lives much more then they ever had enjoyed their human lives but was that the drug talking? She wasn’t sure and part of her was concerned she was wrong, and another thought it didn’t matter all that much she had to save Atlantis and if some humans had to pay for what they did to the oceans by becoming merfolk so be it. <br />
<br />
Another part of her wondered if she was pushing it too far, coming back home with 4 new merfolk would be great and cause for congratulations. She wasn’t sure if she keep pushing it and transform the other 6 humans to come back with 10 and be praised or take what she had and leave with these four before they were discovered.<br />
 <br />
“So many choices.” Said Shelly</p>
