<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A series of snarls and hisses rang out from the cage that Vicky had brought forward. Inside was a raccoon who was clearly not willing to cooperate as it swiped at Vicky with its claws. However Vicky moved with surprising speed and strength as her hand darted to the weak spot at the base of the animal’s neck. The raccoon growled and flailed its legs in increasing desperation as its survival instincts told it to keep fighting. However Vicky demonstrated that she was an experienced animal handler as she effortlessly raised the raccoon out of the cage and brought it over to you.<br />
<br />
The raccoon continued to flail its legs and cry out in dismay as it hung limply in Vicky’s arms. You were soon able to tell that it was a female, based on the rows of nipples on the animal’s underside. Added to this, there was a brief moment when you locked eyes with the panicking creature which only confirmed your suspicions that she was once human like you.<br />
<br />
The two of you continued to stare at each other until Vicky interrupted you. “Here we are Princess, say hello to Jen, our new pet raccoon!” The raccoon snarled in reply as it looked up at Vicky in hatred. “As you can see she is still a little bit nervous, after all she has yet to be settled in with her new mate.” The raccoon once again growled and tried to bite at Vicky’s hand, but the sadistic woman only chuckled as she kept her victim hanging limply in her firm grip.<br />
<br />
“Yes, Jen is one of our more recent acquisitions; in fact she only arrived here late last night. And since she has yet to be mated, in her current state she would turn back to normal in a matter of hours.” Vicky then briefly paused as she looked down at the struggling raccoon with a sinister grin on her face. “Sadly though, there is no way I am going to let that happen.”<br />
<br />
Jen’s movements only got more violent as Vicky’s words hung heavily in the air. She was still trying to wriggle free and tear at her captor’s skin, but none of it ultimately did her any good.<br />
<br />
“As you can see Jen is quite a... disruptive individual. She was always trying to undermine me when she worked with me as a doctor back at the Stables. Indeed it is a shame to waste such a sharp intellectual talent in this manner, but you must understand that Dr Jenkins really was a terrible man…”<br />
<br />
The raccoon growled in defiance upon hearing her real name. Clearly she hated Vicky and her new body in equal measure.<br />
<br />
However, the raccoon&#39;s protests faltered slightly when Vicky reached towards her with her free hand and started to gently brush her fingers over the soft fur of her underbelly. Jen tried to swipe at the hand in protest, but when it gave a hard pinch to one of her sensitive nipples she could only let out a surprised yelp as her body seemed to tense up in shock.<br />
<br />
“That’s it, hush now dear,” Vicky said as she continued to explore and tease Jen’s soft, furry teats. The raccoon grimaced as she let out more pathetic whimpering noises. You could see the shame and regret in the creature’s wide eyes as you sensed that some part of her was starting to inexplicably enjoy this humiliating and emasculating treatment. As a result of this, the raccoon was soon left squirming and mewling in discomfort as her efforts to hurt Vicky steadily faded into nothing.<br />
<br />
With Jen subdued for the moment, Vicky resumed her story as she continued to stroke and tease the raccoon possessively. “Now where were we? Ah yes, I was just about to explain why Dr Jenkins is better off living as my pet raccoon from now on.” Jen stirred slightly upon hearing this, but a sharp tweak to another of the nubs on her chest made her return to her placid, slightly-aroused state.<br />
<br />
“As I was saying,” Vicky continued whilst smiling down at the flustered raccoon, “Dr Jenkins truly was an awful man. Ever since he joined the Stables he was always rough and cruel with the animals; especially when he used them for his sadistic experiments. He seemed to want our transformed visitors to suffer as much as possible as he tested all sorts of formulas on them. Some of these serums aimed to alter the subject’s mind, such that they were warped to hate every moment of their new lives.” Vicky then paused dramatically as she looked at you with an evil grin. “And then there were others that altered the subject’s physiology. In fact, why don’t I give you a demonstration…”<br />
<br />
Jen instantly snapped back to her senses as a small syringe was carefully inserted into her neck. Like before, she started to cry out and flail her legs as the syringe’s contents were steadily injected into her bloodstream. Sadly, Vicky didn’t relent or loosen her grip until the syringe was empty. She then removed it carefully as she watched Jen continue to bite and kick in panic.<br />
<br />
“Hmmm… it’s not so nice getting a taste of your own medicine, is it dear? Don’t worry, I’m sure you will enjoy its effects once they truly start to take hold.” <br />
<br />
You watched in fascination as the former doctor shut her eyes tightly and grimaced in apparent discomfort. However, when Vicky brought the raccoon closer you soon figured out what was really happening. You looked on in stunned silence as Jen’s whole body shuddered and tensed up. Then, things got more disturbing as you saw the raccoon&#39;s vagina for the first time. It had previously been hidden by the thick fur surrounding it, but now the tight slit clearly engorged as the lips swelled with blood. Soon you were even able to see a few drops of moisture coating the organ’s surface. Seeing this made you feel sick to the core as you were reminded of your own vagina and what had happened to it when you were in oestrus. Clearly this serum made the subject enter heat, which was why Jen was now visibly shaking in barely-contained need.<br />
<br />
“Ooooh, that seemed to work like a charm.” Vicky smiled as she held the distressed raccoon up to her face so that she could more closely inspect her crotch. “Of course I thought it would only be fitting for you to test one of your own formulas for a change. This one keeps you in heat permanently, whilst also boosting your sex-drive so that you can take full advantage of your new body.”<br />
<br />
Jen was clearly distraught by this whole situation. She cried out to Vicky, desperately begging her to let her go. <br />
<br />
Sadly, Jen’s pleas were only met with a cruel smile as Vicky looked down at the helpless raccoon. “It’s too late for that now you son of a bitch,” Vicky hissed at her in a suddenly vengeful tone, “you asked me to help cover up your sick experiments for you. You then tried to frame me when management caught wind of what you were doing. And then, once that scheme failed, you planned to silence me by turning me into one of your little lab rats. Well now that the shoe’s on the other foot I think it is about time that you suffered like your past victims. And when you’re sat in your cage swollen with kits and being fucked by your mate I just want you to remember that you deserve all of it. Now I think we ought to put you where you truly belong!”<br />
<br />
Jen squealed out in terror as Vicky marched over to the cages that were stacked high against the wall. There was then a flurry of distressed cries as the raccoon was unceremoniously dumped inside one of the cages. It was hard to see with Vicky blocking your view, but you thought you had a fairly good idea of what was now happening to the former doctor.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, your suspicions were confirmed when Vicky brought the cage over to you. Inside, Jen was now busy being passionately humped by a distinctly male raccoon as she squeaked out in dread beneath him.<br />
<br />
“Awww isn’t that romantic?” Vicky said as she put the cage on a nearby table before moving beside you. “I think they like each other!” <br />
<br />
You naturally followed Vicky’s gaze as you both watched the eagerly mating raccoons. Despite her protests, Jen’s cries for help gradually shifted into a chorus of hot and needy moans as she appeared to relax into a steady mating rhythm. As for the male, you could hear his balls slapping against Jen’s furry ass as he increased the speed and ferocity of his thrusting. He clearly had only one thing on his mind as he looked ahead with an intense feral hunger in his eyes.<br />
<br />
As the raccoons continued to enjoy themselves, Vicky leaned in close to provide further commentary. “Hmmm, well I must give credit where it’s due; these formulas really are something. Jen doesn’t know this yet but I have a few more injections lined up for both her and her mate. For Jen, I think that a couple of serums to reduce her gestation times and boost her litter sizes should keep her busy. As for her mate, I am sure we will be able to raise his libido so that it is closer to her level... not that he seems to be lacking in enthusiasm as he is!”<br />
<br />
You ultimately agreed with Vicky’s assessment of the male raccoon as you watched him pumping furiously in and out of Jen’s slick new orifice. It was clear that both were now desperate for the sweet release of orgasm as they moved and cried out as one.<br />
<br />
Upon noticing that it would all be over soon, Vicky briskly picked up the cage and held it up so that both of you could see the inevitable climax up-close. You could only stare in silence as Jen now looked at you with a wild excitement and passion in her eyes. Seeing this made you feel uneasy as you considered the fact that you probably showed a similar expression when Harry fucked you back at the Stables. Thinking about this made you feel a twinge of shame and regret as you felt your plump equine vagina sitting snugly between your thighs. All of Vicky’s talk about pregnancy and litter sizes made you slightly queasy as you only just realised that you yourself might be pregnant with Harry’s foal!<br />
<br />
You considered this grim possibility for a few moments before your thoughts were interrupted by an ear-splitting screech that shook the building. From your vantage point you were able to see a slight spray of wetness shoot out behind Jen as the male finally ejaculated inside her. You continued to stare between the couple as a mix of gooey sexual fluids started to seep out of Jen’s pussy before clinging stickily to the fur around it. Eventually though the couple did separate; with the male leaving Jen panting as she lay slumped in a heap, struggling to recover from the intense lovemaking.<br />
<br />
“There we are, what a good girl you are. It looked like you were having fun with that adorable body of yours.” Jen clearly wanted to defy Vicky, but she could only manage a pathetic whimper as she struggled to come to terms with what had just happened. <br />
<br />
“Such a fine addition to the collection, or at least you will be once your transformation has been sealed for good. If you can resist your mate for another week then you’ll return to your old self. Although,” Vicky said with a chuckle, “it seems I won’t have to worry about this eventuality for too much longer…”<br />
<br />
Jen briefly looked up at Vicky in confusion before she cried out in alarm as she felt a familiar pair of furry forearms gripping her sides. She tried to bolt away but was soon unable to move as the male raccoon loomed above her and used his weight to keep her pinned in position. Jen then let out another shriek of despair as she was penetrated for a second time. Vicky burst into laughter as Jen looked up at her pleadingly, even as the male started to pound into her like he had before.<br />
<br />
“Haha,” Vicky chuckled, “it seems that Jen’s fate will soon be sealed. I think we can leave these two lovers to it. After all, Jen will need to have a lot of practice if she plans to be a mother someday soon.”<br />
<br />
As Vicky said this you looked for a reaction from the former doctor. However, she was now too busy enjoying herself as she once again started to work in unison with the male on her back.<br />
<br />
And so, with her story having now reached its cruel conclusion, Vicky left Jen to it as she declared that it was time for another story. With this in mind she began pacing around the small building as she started hunting for her next victim.<br />
<br />
After inspecting a few of the various cages and glass tanks Vicky seemed to have made her selection. Meanwhile you could only watch in stunned silence as Vicky reached into one of the containers and introduced you to yet another one of her family’s unfortunate victims...</p>
