<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Curt had a couple more friends he could think of off the top of his head that might enjoy this new toy, and he was feeling pretty eager to let loose with it.  One of his old college friends had recently moved nearby, and while he was looking forward to meeting with her again before, the chance to let her enjoy becoming her fursona was making him all the more excited about it.<br />
<br />
He was driving down the highway, following the directions to her new address from his phone’s GPS, while Anna and Skyla sat in the other front seat, Skyla looking over the gun while Anna was busy petting down the new kitsune’s fluffy tails.<br />
<br />
“These things are just gorgeous!”  Anna squeed.  “And so soft and cuddly.”<br />
<br />
“Aren’t they?”  Skyla grinned and swished one of them across Anna’s face.  “That’s one of the reasons I went with a fox, after all.”  She turned her attention to the front seat.  “So you’re saying you just got this thing in the mail?  No hint at where it’s from, or why you’re getting it?”<br />
<br />
“Yep.  Completely out of nowhere, not that Anna or I are complaining about it.”<br />
<br />
<br />
“None from me either,”  Skyla nodded.  “Must be pretty fun getting to be a master of TFing after just imagining it for so long.  Who else have you changed, so far?”<br />
<br />
“Just you guys, for now…  And the mailman, back when I thought it was just a prank.”<br />
<br />
“Really?  I’m surprised you’re being so restrained with it.  I mean, if nobody can tell that you’re changing them, and people don’t treat the new furries any differently than normal people, it’s not like there’s any harm being done.  You could just go around and change anyone and everyone, and nobody’d be the wiser.”<br />
<br />
“Well, if it were just that, than maybe I would but- Rats!”  Curt sighed as he looked at the road signs above him, and back at his GPS.  “Ugh, I thought I set this thing to avoid toll roads!  Now it’s too late to get on a different one.  Either of you two have some cash I could borrow?  Of all the days to not leave some change in my wallet...”<br />
<br />
Skyla searched her own wallet.  “Sorry, I spent the last of my spare change on the vending machine.”<br />
<br />
“Well, this stinks…”  Curt groaned, as he pulled up to the booth.  “I am not looking forward to the extra collection fees…”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I’ve got an idea!”  Anna giggled, and whispered something to Skyla, as Curt began to explain himself to the booth’s operator.  Skyla got a mischievous grin, as well, and handed the gun to Anna, who quickly made a couple of adjustments on the HUI, before firing a bolt of lightening, green, this time, at the operator.<br />
<br />
“Well sir, I understand the mistake, but-”  The man in the booth said, before the bolt of lightning struck.  Suddenly, his clothes shifted around, his pants and shirt weaving together, and changing color to become a black dress with a white apron.  Short grey fur appeared all over ‘his’ skin, and she shrank a few inches, her body becoming female.  <br />
<br />
Her physique altered, her arms and legs becoming a little thinner, and her hips a little wider, the top of her dress pressing forward slightly as a modest pair of breasts grew from her chest.  While nobody present had an angle to view it from, her feet and toes grew a little longer, her toenails vanishing as her toes grew dulled claws.  Her spine stretched behind her, squeezing through a little hole in the back of her skirt, becoming a long, thin tail, with relatively little hair.  <br />
<br />
Her fuzzy face pushed forward into a rounded snout, cute little whiskers growing by the end of her now-constantly-twitching nose.  Her eyes grew a bit wider, taking a soft green color, while her  hair seemed to shrink back into the rest of her fur.  Lastly, her ears grew larger and rounder, almost half the size of her head, a lace headband appearing between them.<br />
<br />
But the physical changes weren’t the only ones the new mouse maid was experiencing.  Her mind, and even her entire reality, were shifting around her.  Her name was Meredith, and for as long as she she could remember, she had been an adorable mouse girl.  And as far as anyone but Curt, Anna, and Skyla knew, that was all she had ever been.  She opened her eyes, taking a breath in as she began to pick up where she left off.  “Since it’s you master, I’ll be willing to let you go through without the fee, this time.”<br />
<br />
Curt nearly jumped in surprise at the sudden change, turning back to look at Anna, who held the ray gun with a proud grin.  “See, now she’s friends with us, and super cute, too!”<br />
<br />
“Anna!  What are you doing?  You can’t just-”<br />
<br />
“Is something wrong, master?”  Meredith asked.  “You seem troubled.”<br />
<br />
“Er…  No, miss…  Meredith…”  Curt said, looking at her name tag.  “I’m really sorry to hinder your job like this.  You don’t have to do us any special favors or anything.”<br />
<br />
“Oh master Curt,” she shook her head.  “I insist.  What are friends for?”  The gate opened in front of them.<br />
<br />
“Well…  Thanks, I guess.”  Curt said.<br />
<br />
“You’re welcome, master Curt.”  Meredith smiled.  “If it’s alright with you, may I drop by your house after work, to help clean up a little?  It would make my day.”<br />
<br />
While Curt’s introvert nature made him hesitant to invite someone that was technically a stranger into his home, and he felt a little guilty about using the gun on someone he wasn’t already sure would want the results, he also hated to see his friends disappointed, and it seemed reality had been re-written so Meredith had been friends with him for some time.  There was no reverse button, this was what Meredith really wanted now.  If that’s what made her happy, he wasn’t going to let his guilt get in the way of that.  “Sure thing.  I’ll pay you back for letting us through here once I get back.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, master, that really won’t be-”<br />
<br />
<br />
“Look, this time, it’s MY turn to insist.”<br />
<br />
Meredith giggled, shaking her head.  “I suppose I can’t argue with that, master Curt.  I’ll see you this evening!”<br />
<br />
As Curt drove through the booth, and out of his new mouse-maid’s sights, he took a moment to ask his sister,  “Anna?  Why’d you do that?”  <br />
<br />
“You didn’t want to get the extra fines, and now you don’t have to.”  The cat grinned.  “Plus, I think Meredith looks a lot cuter like that.”<br />
<br />
“She’s not wrong.”  Skyla added.  “That being said…  You mean to tell me this gun had a ‘maid outfit’ setting, and you DIDN’T use it on me?  Now I just feel left out.”  <br />
<br />
“If it means that much to you, I can look into getting one later.  Never really saw the appeal of them myself.”  Curt shook his head, realizing he was getting off topic.  “But that’s beside the point!  That guy might not have ever wanted to be a mouse girl, and now she’s treating me like I’m her boss, or something!”<br />
<br />
“Well, thanks to that reality field thing, now we don’t have to worry about that.”  Anna said.  “She’s always been our friend, and she’s happy to help us out.  And the world is a slightly fuzzier place, which is always fun.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, but she wasn’t before.  I mean, he wasn’t, before.  It’s just…  Great power is supposed to come with great responsibility, you know!  We can’t just go around zapping people into servants willy nilly!”<br />
<br />
“Nobody’s killed uncle Ben yet, calm down,”  Skyla said.  “You’ve got a once in a lifetime opportunity here!  You’d be squandering it if you didn’t use it.  You gotta embrace the furryness!  Trust me, it’ll embrace you right back.”  The fox grinned.<br />
<br />
“Well…  I guess that’s one way to look at it…  But still…”<br />
<br />
“And the change worked out well for me!”  Anna pointed out.  “It’s probably been an improvement for Meredith too.  I don’t think it’ll hurt to make the world a fuzzier place!”<br />
<br />
“Well…  Look, maybe we can change some more people,”  Curt sighed, his fear of disappointing his friends overriding his worry about the implications of making random people infatuated with him, “especially if they’ve got some serious health issues that this could help fix, but for now, can you promise me that you won’t just zap anyone else without my say-so?”<br />
<br />
“If you say so,” Skyla nodded.<br />
<br />
“Well…”  Anna paw to her chin, and grinned playfully.  “You DID tell me that whatever you told me could be taken as just a suggestion…”  She held back a laugh at her brother’s panicked expression in the rear-view mirror.  “But I’ll hold back, for now…”<br />
<br />
Curt gave a relieved sigh.</p>
