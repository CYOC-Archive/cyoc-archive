<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This may be a mostly American thing, but a Resource Officer is an actual cop assigned to a school.  They are often but not always a chaperones on school trips.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andrew Farminga went still, his black wolf tail lifting up behind him, hidden only by the length of the hoodie he wore under his Assistant Coach jacket.  If it hadn&#39;t been for those few extra inches of black, it might be clear to everyone down in the parking lot the next time the bright white of lightening lit of the rainy night&#39;s sky... followed by a complete lack of thunder to follow.<br />
<br />
Those green eyes he had took in the sight of the men&#39;s youth&#39;s football team bus shaking.  His most recent experience with undesired sexual activity and sudden lust combined with the unsettling situation of vanishing exits and a giant empty cabin-like hotel in the middle of a State Park that probably shouldn&#39;t have one all cobbled together to create a pending dread and unease.<br />
<br />
Lifting his right hand, he pointed out towards the bus and yelled, &quot;Do you not see that!?&quot; but the roar of heavy rain—though a strange lack of wind—drowned him out.  He growled, barring his teeth.  Of course no one could hear him.<br />
<br />
Quickly he reached into his coat&#39;s front chest pocket and pulled his phone up to his mouth while pointing with the opposite hand at the bus a second time.  &quot;What&#39;s happening on the bus!?&quot; he repeated loudly over the walkie-talkie app.  His feet had already begun hitting the stone walkway hard as he took off town the hill towards the parking lot.<br />
<br />
He passed the numerous vehicles near the lights and cover of the closer side of the lot around the time Coach Banks had gotten back to the furthest bus and was banging on the door.  His eyes went to the windows of the boys&#39; transport and couldn&#39;t tell what was happening.  Rhythmic shaking framed a still covered back against one pane, while people moving near the front of the bus all were a scuffle that could have been a gang-bang or a massive fight or anywhere in between.<br />
<br />
Andy frowned.  He knew that without his unexplained sudden urge for animal fornication back in the cabin, most of those thoughts would never have come to his mind... but there was an urgency to how he crossed the pavement.  What if they got the doors open and a full pack of wolves—<i>real wolves!</i>—pushed themselves off the bus and ran off into the woods?<br />
<br />
Why did he have a sudden feeling of deja vü?<br />
<br />
&quot;Open this door!&quot; Coach Banks was yelling, banging on the window.  The glass panes of the door and indeed all the windows were all but completely opaque from moisture.  It was clear the inside of the vehicle was much hotter than the cold rain outside and so no one looking in from the outside could see much detail of anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;They might not be able to!&quot; declared Andrew as he approached the Coach.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?  Why!?&quot; Coach Banks asked, absolutely confused without Andy&#39;s context.<br />
<br />
&quot;They may not be in control of themselves,&quot; Andy offered honestly, though still withholding context.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it locked!?&quot; came Emily&#39;s voice, causing Andy to jump.  Looking over he saw her and Zelda approaching from the front of the bus, unsure why the had circled around from that direction.  &quot;It looks like a fight!&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy looked clearly relieved.  &quot;Oh, man, I hope so.&quot;<br />
<br />
Coach Banks turned quickly to glade at him.  &quot;What!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trust me, Coach, it&#39;s better than the alternative!&quot; he declared, pulling up the back of his jacket and making sure everyone present had a good look at him forcefully wagging his tail.  Everyone just stared at it.  &quot;If it&#39;s <i>just</i> a fight, we&#39;re OK.  Guys beating each other&#39;s ass is one thing... pounding ass is a different problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve lost your damn mind,&quot; said Thaddeus.  His wide noes wrinkled up at the idea that any of the boys would be doing <i>that</i> in the brief moments he&#39;d stepped off the bus.<br />
<br />
Andy pulled out his phone.  &quot;Speaker Call James,&quot; he said to his voice activation.<br />
<br />
Zelda shook her head.  &quot;Phone calls aren&#39;t getting off the mountain,&quot; she said.  &quot;Nothing is!&quot;<br />
<br />
Because Andy had asked for a speaker call, everyone could hear it ring aloud.  Zelda blinked, looking at Emily, then back to Andy.  &quot;Duhd, where er yhou?&quot; came James&#39;s response.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on in there?&quot; Andy demanded.  Covering the speaker with his thumb, he looked over at Zelda.  &quot;Maybe because I called someone <i>here,</i> it worked?&quot; he asked her.  Blinking, it was clear from her face that she didn&#39;t think that would make a difference, but she couldn&#39;t deny it.  Pulling out her own phone, she moved away and tried to call her mom again.<br />
<br />
James paused.  &quot;Fhuggen.  Somewhon elbuhed me in dah fayce when I thride to see whut Chrissopher and Horray were dohan in the back.&quot;  He coughed, and in the moments he wasn&#39;t talking everyone could hear louder the voices of other people yelling.  &quot;Fawk this issa lotta blohd,&quot; James offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you <i>open the door!?&quot;</i> both Andrew and Coach Banks managed to ask at the same time.<br />
<br />
James voice was confused: &quot;Uh... issut loaked?&quot;  A moment later, there was the simultaneous sound of the door unlocking, but also the sudden opening of the door where James tumbled out of the bus and onto his knees on the pavement.  He was clearly bleeding from both the back of the head and his busted nose as Andrew leaned down to pick him up.<br />
<br />
James smiled bloody teeth up at Andrew before looking passed Coach Banks.  &quot;Gun!&quot; the teen yelled.  Zelda screamed, and Emily pulled them both back around the front of the bus.<br />
<br />
Rushing up, gun out and pointed down, was the &#39;school rent-a-cop&#39; as the students derisively called him.  Officer Dowd was dressed in a combination of standard police blue with silver and black gloves he wore to try and fit the school colors.  His black boots came to a stop as he was blocked by Coach Banks turning and putting himself between the officer and the bus door.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s assault, so this is me, Coach,&quot; the dirty blonde-hair officer said, nodding towards James.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was an ahahdant,&quot; said James as Andrew lifted him to his feet.  James lifted his head back, holding his busted nose.  &quot;Axe-ah-dent,&quot; he repeated, enunciating.  &quot;Noh shooty.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was clear none of the students were comfortable Officer Dowd having his gun out, even pointed down, and most were made less comfortable when Coach Banks stepped between Dowd and the open bus door.  &quot;You&#39;re not gettin&#39; on dis bus with a gun drawn,&quot; the dark-skinned man made clear in tone.  &quot;We&#39;re already lost, we don&#39;t need to be dead too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dowd frowned.  &quot;There&#39;s wild animals out here,&quot; he said, justifying his firearm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not on the bus there&#39;s not,&quot; said the coach, putting his life on the line as he stood firm between the cop and the doorway.  &quot;Even Achak is in a cage on the <i>young ladies,</i> bus,&quot; he emphasized loud enough so Emily and Zelda could hear him.  &quot;Their not <i>animals,</i>&quot; he added.  He was clearly thinking of something specific when he said it, but not the curse to which he was unfortunately foreshadowing.<br />
<br />
Officer Dowd stepped to the side of the bus, sort of circling towards the door where Andy and James now stood.  They each actually moved to block him.  &quot;The woods,&quot; the policeman said to boys, then looked to coach.  &quot;I saw wolves,&quot; he added, though it didn&#39;t invoke the curse.  &quot;A half dozen... just over...&quot; he looked from where he&#39;d come from, then off the front of the bus.<br />
<br />
Dowd looked towards the headlights that lit up the rain at the front of the bus.  Stepping beyond the side door and towards the front, he noted Zelda and Emily there but kept walking a few steps.  Andrew looked at James, then Coach Banks, then back to the bus still shaking.  He was about to ask something when the tension briefly broke:<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Dowd asked himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;What what?&quot; Andy asked, noticing a bulge at the <i>back</i> of the officer&#39;s rain slicker and pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, wait,&quot; James realized something.  &quot;Isn&#39;t that they way you went to smoke?&quot; he asked, his head still back even as the blood began to slow.  Andrew looked at him.  &quot;Hey, he said not to tell the coach, but the dude was having a nica-fit and edgy cops are no bueno, so I watched him walk to the end of the pavement in front of the bus.&quot;  The boy explained.  &quot;But he just came from back there,&quot; thumbing over his own shoulder toward the girl&#39;s bus.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was trying to find the road,&quot; Dowd said, looking back from the front of the bus to the earlier.  &quot;It&#39;s gone!&quot; he said, declaratively.  Most of the others just looked at each other, except the Andy who just nodded like &#39;Yeah, we know&#39;.  &quot;So I went in looking for it, thinking there&#39;s just a part of path unpaved... and, uh, I saw wolves and pulled out my gun.  I went further and further, in a straight line, and came out back there!&quot; he concluded, turning to motion back behind the busses where he&#39;d come from.<br />
<br />
<em>But actually, a few minutes earlier...</em><br />
<br />
Officer Dowd stood at the edge of the pavement in the heavy rain.  He&#39;d put on a yellow and white rain slicker over his blues, a hat on over his head under the hood.  Reaching up, he made sure his cigarette was covered by the bill of the hat while he used a lighter to light the end of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ingrates,&quot; he said after a single puff.  &quot;Oink, oink, really?&quot; he asked himself.  &quot;[Pig] noises, really?&quot; he asked after another puff.  &quot;Just give me a reason,&quot; he added, looking down.  It was then that he noticed that the road in front of the bus was missing.  His shadow ahead of him had blocked much of his sight from the lights of the bus, but it was at that moment that Officer Dowd stepped to the left and right from the front of the bus, taking in the fact there didn&#39;t seem to be a road anymore.<br />
<br />
&quot;The shit is this,&quot; he asked himself, stepping forward down onto the grass.  Just before him was a heavily wooded space with the trees so close and limbs so low that he couldn&#39;t for the life of him figure out where the bus must have come through.  Glancing back, he saw James watching him out in front of the lights from behind the driver&#39;s seat.  They&#39;d be fine for a few minutes.<br />
<br />
Turning around, the policeman pushed a low branch out of the way and stepped into the tree-line.  The rain was loud on the leaves above, though the rain itself was coming down in little waterfalls all around him, rather than just pouring down through the trees.<br />
<br />
He was thinking about the terrain and how none of it felt like where they&#39;d traveled up and around a bend to get there when he&#39;d heard huffing and grunting.  &quot;Who&#39;s there?&quot; he asked into the air, a hand down on his holster.  The strange noise continued, and Dowd pushed forwards into the woods.  The noises were ahead of him, and a little up to the right.<br />
<br />
Leaning around from a large rock formation, he spotted the source of sound.  Nature.  Four wolves, two of which gripped over the backs of the other two, humping away, smacking balls against spades, about to be knot-locked within them.  Dowd found himself entranced, his own dick already rock hard without any warning.  Reaching down, he rubbed the front of his pants as he watched.<br />
<br />
<i>The fuck is wrong with me?</i> he wondered silently, having enough self-awareness to not make noise around the nearby wolves if possible.  Somewhere at the back of his pants, a curly pink tail began to push out from his tailbone.  Fatty tissue began to accumulate on his chest, lumping up not just there, but also just below as he grew an extra pair of nipples below the first.  <i>This is wrong,</i> he thought, almost gathering self control enough to hold himself back but certainly not enough to be aware of his transformation.<br />
<br />
His eyes shifted back up to the wolves in front of him and they&#39;d moved and thrust enough that Officer Dowd got a clear view of the raised tail of one of the males... except that the wold&#39;s softball-sized testicles were pushed forward by his own, thick, glistening vulva.  The sight of additional genitalia distracted the officer&#39;s logical mind and instead ensnared the lustful, animal instincts he was feeling.<br />
<br />
Even then, he closed his eyes and held his hand still, trying not to loose himself.  His tail grew a little longer, and his pecs a little more round, but they halted their progress.  Mayhaps that could have maintained until he heard one of the wolves yelp, at which point, he opened his eyes to more than he expected:<br />
<br />
Opening his eyes, there were two more wolves for a total of six.  The one Dowd had mainly been focused on, the hermaphrodite, had been lifted further up as the second wolf in front of him lifted up her body to reveal her—hir?—own red rocket that was easily the size of the officer&#39;s forearm.  This second wolf landed on the back of one of the new wolves, thrusting her length into its lupine cunt.<br />
<br />
But it didn&#39;t stop there, as that wolf too had a tapered crimson shaft that revealed as shi pulled forward and lept on top of what Dowd had originally thought was a the second male of the first four.  But no, they were all dual-gendered with comically oversize genetailia... shafts easily a foot long with softball sized testicles each where they were male, and plump tri-fold vulva only just smaller than Andy&#39;s now was were they were female.<br />
<br />
There were now five wolves bending in an arc, with the second of the two additional wolves whiping hir tail over the nose of the one at the &#39;front&#39; of the carnal congo-line.  That final wolf&#39;s organs were just barely smaller than the others, but that didn&#39;t stop hir from raising up hir front paws and wrapping them around the &#39;last&#39; wolf in the chain, thrusting forward into them.  A moment later, the &#39;first&#39; wolf revealed a shaft so girthy it could have been a small log... and lifting hir front too resulted in a yipe from that sixth wolf as the fifth pushed into hir cookie a little at first, then more with each thrust.<br />
<br />
Yes, all six wolves were hermapohroties—dual-sexed—just as the curse would intend as the final form for any trapped here.  Each had larger than normal genitals.  And now, all six together formed a fucking hexagon where half the wolves pushed back into the cock sliding into them while the other three pushed inwards to their companions... and then the roles reversed.  Thrust, thrust, thrust.  It was a wave of fur and muscles and lechery the likes of which Officer Dowd had never seen before, even in the craziest porno.  He was enthralled and struggled to get his belt undone before—!<br />
<br />
—too late.  The police officer looked down beyond his somewhat thicker pecs and to the wet-spot he could feel accumulating inside his pants as he creamed them thickly.  He oinked once, a confused noise on many levels.  His current changes were now permanent.  <i>This can&#39;t be happening,</i> he insisted, even though reality was showing him otherwise.  Touching the front of his crotch, he could feel the sticky exuding from inside.<br />
<br />
If the wolves heard him, they didn&#39;t care.  They were all knotted or about to be, and it was unlikely they&#39;d be able to chase him in their current state even if they wanted to.  Meanwhile, straight ahead, there was light and sound, and so he moved forward.  <i>Everyone&#39;s pants are wet, it&#39;s raining,</i> he assured himself, his senses slowing come back to remind him who and where he was. <i>No one will notice,</i> he nodded, unaware he was now licking his fingers clean.<br />
<br />
But as he pushed forward out from the woods ahead in the direction he&#39;d been traveling, he breached the tree-line and was now back behind the cheerleader&#39;s bus.  There was a commotion up ahead and he could see from where he was that the boys&#39; bus was shaking with trouble.<br />
<br />
Absently, he wondered how hormone-riddled teenagers would react to what he just saw and his lack of control came to mind.  What was going on?  Hand back at his side, he unlatched his gun from his holster and made his way towards the yelling near the headlights of the front bus.<br />
<br />
<em>Meanwhile, back in the present...</em><br />
<br />
&quot;You saw wolves, but you went straight passed them instead of coming back to let us know?&quot; asked Zelda, her almond-shaped eyes indicating they didn&#39;t really believe his story.  &quot;Why didn&#39;t you turn around?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Officer didn&#39;t want to reveal the whole story.  &quot;The wolves... they weren&#39;t going in a straight line...&quot; he said, and that part was true. Remembering the circle of sex they&#39;d formed, Dowd trailed off for a moment.  Shaking his head physically, he went on: &quot;But you&#39;re missing what I&#39;m saying: the path ahead lead back to the busses.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn&#39;t make any physical sense,&quot; replied Coach Banks coldly.  &quot;Now, put that gun away, Officer.  The only wolves here are Washington Wolves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily stepped around towards Andy.  &quot;Literally,&quot; she chuckled, pulling on his oversized wolf tail.  Andy yiped a real wolf yipe.  <i>&quot;Oh my god, I&#39;m so sorry,&quot;</i> she said as assistant coach turned his head to look at his best friend, tears at the corner of his eyes.  &quot;I thought it was a prop,&quot; she said, doubly-distressed that she&#39;d hurt her friend and that her friend now had a real animal tail.<br />
<br />
From the bus there was a commotion that could be heard out the open door.  Looking behind them, James and Andy moved out of the way as a number of the team quickly be began filing out of the bus and into the rain as if running from something.  Many didn&#39;t even have on their coats.<br />
<br />
Officer Dowd, who still hadn&#39;t put his gun away, used those coming off the bus as blockers between himself and the coaching staff.  While not everyone was off the bus now, most were, and as Andy and James ended up next to Coach Banks, Zelda and Emily yelled after the cop as he rushed onto the bus, gun drawn.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s he doing?&quot; someone asked, distressed.</p>
