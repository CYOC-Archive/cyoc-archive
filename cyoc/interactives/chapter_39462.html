<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>Knowing that Nate was always a bit of an outcast, Ty thought it would be best to try and get to know him. All the days that they had spent in the same classes, Ty realized that he never was part of the solution but an addition to the problem. Even though Ty never did anything to show discontent for him, he realized that not doing anything to show interest in him was just as bad.</Br>
<Br>Ty decided that it would be best to wait till the end of class to talk to the new werewolf and since that was over an hour away, Ty wished silently for the class to end. As the wish ended, the bell had rung signaling the hour and ten minutes had elapsed from when Ty wished, with all the students except for Nate leaving the room. It was then that Ty noticed frequently that Nate always waited, not wanting to rush or bring attention to himself. Ty shook his head, saddened that he had not noticed this earlier, then quickly packed up his things and rushed over to Nate who was just getting up out of the desk that had changed to meet his new body.</Br>
<Br>When Ty stood there, next to Nate's desk, Nate looked puzzled toward Ty. Not sure of what Ty wanted, Nate remained apprehensive in asking questions.</Br>
<Br>"Y... Yes, can I help you?"</Br>
<Br>"Oh... no Nate, there is nothing that you can help me with. I just wanted to come over and talk with you, that's all."</Br>
<Br>"Oh... so you are like the rest and want to make fun of me because I am different?" He said slightly angered by Ty's presence.</Br>
<Br>"Oh no, no, no! It is nothing like that at all! I just want to talk to you and get to know you... that's all, I swear!"</Br>
<Br>"Sure, that is what everyone says, then they get me buddied up with them and then I go to a get-together and then I become the butt of the joke that the person wanted to play on me in the first place! I don't think I am going to fall for that one again! Now please, go away!"</Br>
<Br>"Nate, I am really sorry to hear that about you and how things have gone for you, but please believe me, I just want to talk."</Br>
<Br>"So if we talk... then you will leave me alone?"</Br>
<Br>"Sure, if that is what it takes for us to get to know one another. We will chat and then I will leave you alone for as long as you would like."</Br>
<Br>"Alright, so what do you want to talk to me about because I only have a few minutes to get to class now."</Br>
<Br>Realizing that it was going to take some time to get to be friends with the only werewolf in existence, Ty knew he was going to have to make another wish. Ty then wished for something drastic to happen in the school that no one would get hurt over, but the school would have to be closed for the next week. Knowing that would not be enough, Ty also wished that Nate would accept any sort of invitation to get to know him better, just to make things slightly easier on Ty. When the wish finished, there was an announcement over the public announcement system.</Br>
<Br><Center>Students of Littleton High, this is your Principal and I need your attention. Due to unforseen issues, we will be closing the school for the entire week and we will be starting up classes next monday. The repairs that we need to make affect the entire school and this forces us to shut down. There will be no penalty for lost time since this is a maintanence issue. That is all.</Center></Br>
<Br>Ty looked at Nate the werewolf and smiled. "Well... I guess we don't have to worry about that next class now do we?"</Br>
<Br>"No... I guess not! So, what do you want to do next?" In hearing a bit of happiness in his voice, Ty smiled inwardly, knowing that he has already started off on the right foot. Even though he could use his wishing to do anything with people, Ty really wanted to get to know Nate for who he was... even though he is a werewolf on the outside, nothing about him or his life changed as far as Ty knew.</Br>
<Br>"To show that I only want to get to know you, I will let you call the shots. You name where we go and I will be ok with that... even if we have to be in the gym showers with me naked and you ready to tear me apart to feed on. How does that sound?"</Br>
<Br>Nate chuckled, then quickly stopped, not wanting to show Ty that he had any emotions toward Ty as it stood. "I think that sounds great, even if I get to have you for supper... should I want."</Br>
<Br>Ty chuckled audibly so that Nate could hear, even though he probably could hear it regardless of what he did. "So... sounds like a plan. Where are we going big guy?"</Br>
<Br>"I guess we could just go back to my place. That way, you are on my home turf." He finished with a slight grin.</Br>
<Br>"Sounds good! I want you to be as comfortable as you want to be."</Br>
<Br>With that conversation ending, Ty could see how Nate had warmed up to him slightly as it was. This was something that made Ty feel good about what he had done with his powers. Ty was also worried for a moment at how Nate might have taken the <I>naked in the gym showers to be eaten</I> comment, as Ty was joking but it could have been taken in the wrong way. If it had, he would have tried to make things better on his own, even though he could have used his wishing to undo what foul he did.</Br>
<Br>"Since we are headed to my turf, I need to know something."</Br>
<Br>"Sure Nate... what is it?"</Br>
<Br>"You are ok with me being a werewolf, I know this, but are you ok with the fact that I am gay too?"</Br>
<Br>"Yeah, why wouldn't I be?" At the end of Ty's statement, he could see another level of apprehension was taken off of Nate's shoulders. Ty knew that he was headed in the right direction and that was a great thing. To be more open and to show Nate that all Ty wanted was his friendship, he takes one big step in putting the ball in Nate's court. "Nate, you know I don't tell people this because I never wanted to be an outcast, but I am gay too. I never wanted to be with the in crowd, I just never wanted the automatic judgement placed upon me because of my sexual preference."</Br>
<Br>"Really!? You are gay too! Oh wow, I never would have guessed. Well, obviously your secret is safe with me. I am glad I know that I can be really open with you now!" He said with elicit joy and put his pawed hand on Ty's shoulder in a comforting gesture, guiding him out of the school and to Nate's house.</Br>
<Br>"So... where do you live Nate?"</Br>
<Br>"Oh, I live a couple blocks away from the school."</Br>
<Br>"Are your parents ok with me coming over?"</Br>
<Br>Like a boy who knew he got caught doing something wrong, Nate hung his head low and Ty could almost see a tear start to form. He then picked his head up and sighed. "Well, they would be ok with it if they were alive. They always wanted me to go out and make friends, but ever since I found that I was gay and a werewolf, I never really wanted to put myself out there to get hurt. As you already know, the one time I did... people hurt me pretty bad emotionally and then I just stayed to myself."</Br>
<Br>"Oh Nate, I am so sorry! Please forgive me and I am sorry to hear that about your parents. I am sure they were great people and I know that they are smiling when they are looking down at you from above, knowing that they raised a great son... regardless of who he is inside. I know they also loved you, gay werewolf or not."</Br>
<Br>Ty saw what he thought was a smile from Nate. "You know, you are right, they are and do. I know that they would have liked to have gotten to know you. Oh... why couldn't we have started talking a while ago?"</Br>
<Br>"To be honest, I tried to talk with you in the past, when you were in your human form, but you never gave me the time of day like you are now. I am glad for that, you know. I think you are the only werewolf I have ever gotten a chance to talk with."</Br>
<Br>"Aww... you know you are a pretty nice and sweet guy to talk with and it is a shame that I shrugged you off in the past. That's what I get for being reclusive. You are correct though, I am the only werewolf you would ever get to talk with."</Br>
<Br>"Oh... why is that?"</Br>
<Br>"Well... I am the last one of my kind. There aren't any other werewolves in existence that I know about or my parents for that matter."</Br>
<Br>"Wow... the last of your kind! How does that make you feel?"</Br>
<Br>"To be honest... lonely, but that is what comes with my kind. My parents were the last surviving members of the lycan clan. Even though we live for hundreds upon hundreds of years, my mom and dad were the last living survivors out of the dark ages. Back then, a part of the dark ages was to exterminate my kind."</Br>
<Br>"Oh wow, so how did your parents survive?"</Br>
<Br>"They lived in secret and seclusion. They ran for a while, then when they got so far from where they had lived for a while and no one knew who they were. Since they always had control of when and if they changed, unlike movies show, they remained hidden. After a while, they moved just because it had been a certain amount of time and they didn't want anyone suspecting anything about them."</Br>
<Br>"Wow, that sounds like a rough life! If you don't mind, how did they die?"</Br>
<Br>"I don't mind at all. They died in a car accident. Since there are no werewolf hunters anymore since we are pretty much extinct, that would leave only accidents to kill us off."</Br>
<Br>"So what exactly happened?"</Br>
<Br>"They were driving behind a semi that was transporting silver rods for melting down into silverware and other things. They kept at a safe distance, but the semi jack-knifed and the metal flew through their windshield, impaling both through the chest and into their seats."</Br>
<Br>"Wow, that does sound like quite the incident!"</Br>
<Br>"Yeah, it was. Now that it is over though, I inherited their wealth and home that was paid off, which we are at the main door of.</Br>
<Br>"So what are we going to do now. Are you going to invite me in for more conversation or whatever? Or, do we just see each other again in school?</Br></p>
