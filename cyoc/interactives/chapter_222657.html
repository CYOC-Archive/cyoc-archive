<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Susan just stood there stunned, on the ground to her right closer to the pool and the door leading out into the ocean water lied the now mermaid Amber who was lying on the ground with her upper body up so she could see. On her left now lying on the ground as well was her friend, Matt, his knees had fused together into a single limb just like Amber’s had and so had other peoples in the bar outside.<br />
<br />
“God damn it.” cursed Matt as he got up on the back of his hands so he could see. “You have got to be kidding me. What the fuck is happening?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know.” Sand Amber as she flicked her tail covered in multiple red and golden scales. “I had just taken off my tail, to replace you all for lunch when I found myself becoming an actual mermaid.”<br />
<br />
“You were pleasuring yourself when I found you.” Stated Susan as Amber blushed a bit. “And so, where a lot of the others outside.”<br />
<br />
“Others?” inquired Amber<br />
<br />
“It’s a panic out their others are becoming mermaids and merman.” Stated Susan “Mike the bouncer turned into a women right in front of us and others where doing the same. I even saw a woman becoming a merman so it’s a two-way street there.” <br />
<br />
“How…how do we stop this?” inquired Matt as he watched his legs fuse together from the knee down spreading down to his ankles. He was trying to stay calm, but it was clear he was hanging on by a thread.<br />
<br />
“How the hell are we supposed to know?” inquired Susan as Matt looked at her and then at Amber who had already become a mermaid.<br />
Before he could say anything more, there was ripping sound as coming ripping out of his swimtrunks tearing them to pieces where two sets of fins which looked almost like a dolphin, or a shark fins. They started growing just above Matt’s hips and rejoining his now single limb legs about halfway down to where his knees should have been.<br />
<br />
What also became very visible to the two women, was Matt’s member. Reacting on instinct Matt instantly moved to cover his junk however that would turn out to be a massive mistake. <br />
<br />
It was as if a switch had been flipped and instead of covering himself Matt’s hands began to move up and down as he began to pleasure himself in front of both women in the room. <br />
<br />
What none of them could have known and would only become clearer once more research was done was that what Matt was doing and what Amber had done before him was common among people in the process of transformation due to the mermaid virus. While not 100% of all cases had an almost uncontrollable urge to masturbate the number was extremely high most of all between if the person transforming was between the ages of 20 and 40.<br />
<br />
Susan watched as Matt began to moan in pleasure as he went to town on his junk, it was actually a pretty good size and nothing Matt should have been ashamed off however it was shrinking.<br />
<br />
With each tug his dick was getting smaller and smaller, shrinking down into a slit in his now fused legs.<br />
<br />
With a little bit of a whimper, it disappeared into the slit and Matt’s fingers began to plunge down like a women pleasuring herself. <br />
<br />
So Matt was becoming a woman, just like some of the people Susan had seen outside, that was a shame, she wasn’t sure if she liked Matt or Amber more as a person but her bisexual self wasn’t sure if she liked women or men more but she wanted to keep her options open. <br />
<br />
Then as if on que Matt’s dick began to come back out of the slit, it was different then before. Gone was the classic dick and in it’s place was something more animalist and much larger than before. <br />
<br />
Matt’s upper body began to change as well, he had always been fit. That was almost a requirement to work at the Mermaid’s Cove. He had to put on a merman’s tail and swim around and showing off his chest was part of that. However, his muscles became much more defined but not to the point of over doing it. His blonde hair became brighter but didn’t grow much longer than his normal crew cut style becoming something a kin to needing a haircut but looking very good without it. <br />
<br />
Then his tail, which had been a flesh color began to first become textured in multiple scales starting larger up near his hips and fins and getting smaller down to his ankles. His feet had flared out into a fluke, while Amber’s had become a more classic mermaid’s tail, Matt’s took a sharper almost V like shape. The colors began to come in.<br />
<br />
Normally Matt wore a blue tail for his work, the color that came in now was multiple shades of purple. Purple was normally a mermaid’s tail color at work, but he was getting a purple tail. Sure, some of the spots were dark purple but it was clearly purple. <br />
<br />
When the last bit of color came in, Matt let out a load moan as merman’s gist when flying out of his dick and hit the ceiling before Matt’s hands left his dick as it began to shrink back down before disappearing back into his tail.<br />
<br />
“My God.” Said Matt his voice full of a mixture of wonder, horror and pleasure.</p>
