<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jim brushed himself off as he stood up, now relieved of the pressure of Sandra&#39;s paw on his back.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Jim, would you be dear and drink that dragon potion for us?&quot; said Sandra.<br />
<br />
Several of Abby&#39;s heads leaned forward and bent down to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please.....&quot; they chorused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jim. don&#39;t do it, &quot; said Abby.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d stay quiet if I wanted to stay attached to this body, &quot; threatened the angry head.<br />
<br />
Abby didn&#39;t know what would happen if her head was chopped off, but she didn&#39;t want to find out.  She quickly shut up and leaned back, sulking.<br />
<br />
Jim had no intention of becoming a dragon, or having sex with one. All of them were crazy.  But what choice did he have?He considered slipping them different vials, possibly making them human again.  But although they could not open the vials, they could still read them.  All of them watched him review the vial labels over his shoulder.  Jim found the Hydra vial and got an idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, aren&#39;t I supposed to give this to her?&quot; asked Jim.<br />
<br />
&quot;Later, later.  Take the dragon vial first, &quot; said Sandra.  The lust was incredibly powerful, now that she was so close to finally getting to mate.  It clouded her judgment.  But she had enough sense to know that a larger Abby might become a problem for her.  She had no intention  of honoring her agreement once Jim had changed.  She was just going to snatch Jim and fly away.  The Hydra may have been bigger, but it had no wings.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the matter?  Don&#39;t you trust her?&quot; asked Jim, trying to pit one monster against another.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, what gives?&quot; said the angry head.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is only logical, &quot; said the intelligent head.  &quot;It would only serve to build trust and prove your loyalty to our agreement.  You weren&#39;t planning to betray us, were you?&quot;<br />
<br />
The other heads glared at Sandra angrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, it&#39;s not that.  It&#39;s just that .....&quot; Sandra said.  She looked around at the multiple  heads glaring at her with anger.  Slightly larger heads with very sharp teeth.  She was outnumbered.  &quot;Fine, fine.  You can have yours first.  Just hurry up and do it.  I want Jim to become a dragon as soon as possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim opened the vial and walked towards Abby.  He wasn&#39;t going to use it on her, of course. There was no way he wanted the creature to be even bigger.  But he might have a chance if he used it on Sandra.  Abby&#39;s heads didn&#39;t seem to get along very well, and a few more quibbling heads on Sandra might give him a chance to escape in the confusion.  He couldn&#39;t get the vial in her mouth, and he wasn&#39;t sure if it would work if he just threw it on her. So he used the only opening he could find.  He suddenly turned and rammed his arm into Sandra&#39;s cloacae up to his shoulder.  He twisted his arm, dumping the vial contents into her.  Some of the liquid had been spilled on the ground by his jerky motion, but a large amount was still absorbed.<br />
<br />
Abby&#39;s heads gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my, &quot; said Sandra.  &quot;Jim, what have you done?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her cloacae quivered, pulling tightly on his arm. He could feel warm sticky vaginal juices spilling across his arm. He tried to pull out, but his arm was stuck.<br />
<br />
Sandra&#39;s pussy felt fantastic.  She felt something building down there, almost like the beginning of a powerful orgasm.  Slowly the feeling began to creep across her entire body.  She had never felt such power before.  Becoming a dragon had felt good, but this was even better.  Because he had only used a portion of the vial, Sandra was becoming part dragon and part Hydra.  She was getting the best of both worlds.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know what you were trying to do, but thank you, Jim.  This feels wonderful, &quot; said Sandra, as her body began to grow in rapid spurts.  Sandra thighs and arms grew longer and thicker.  Her chest barreled out.  Soon, she was looking down at Abby.  Abby began to back away, now a little afraid.  The sight of the powerful beast cowering below her made Sandra feel even more powerful and she chuckled with glee as she continued to grow.<br />
<br />
Jim was quickly beginning to realize that this had been a very bad idea.  As Sandra&#39;s groin grew, he found himself being pulled towards her.  If he didn&#39;t do something soon, he would soon be trapped inside her.  He pushed off with his free hand, and his arm came free with a wet plop.  Well, almost free.  Thin tendrils of flesh curled around his arm.  He could see them pulsing and growing as Sandra&#39;s body continued to slowly grow. They were slowly covering his arm.  His free hand still gripped the vial.  As he dropped it, he saw that his hand had begun to change.  It now looker more reptilian than human.  He must have spilled some of the vial contents on himself, too.  It looked like he was going to change, too, whether he liked it or not.<br />
<br />
Sandra felt the change in her vagina and craned her long neck down to look at Jim.  &quot;Well, well. What have we here?  I was hoping for a mate, but it looks like I will just have to settle for a child.&quot;<br />
<br />
She grunted, and the fleshy brown tendrils pulled Jim towards her waiting womb. As he struggled against her cloacae, more tendrils snaked out and began to wrap around his body.  Soon, he lost his grip and was sucked inside the growing womb.<br />
<br />
Sandra grunted in pleasure as Jim began to change in her womb. She could feel her body connecting with his, feeding and pushing his transformation even further.  &quot;Yes, that&#39;s good.  That feels so good.  Come to mother.  She will protect you, and help you grow big and strong.  We&#39;ll grow together.&quot;  She grunted as another wave of growth caused her to expand even larger.<br />
<br />
Abby was beginning to panic.  She had no idea what Jim had been trying to do, but whatever it was had failed miserably. This was getting out of control, and she had to stop it.  For once, all of her heads were in agreement about something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sandra, you have to stop this.  This isn&#39;t part of the agreement.  This isn&#39;t what any of us wanted, &quot; said Abby.<br />
<br />
Sandra winced as her head split into two new heads.  One of the heads appeared dazed, but the other glared down at her with pure malevolence.  &quot;No, this isn&#39;t what you wanted.  I have everything I asked for.  I am pregnant, and even more powerful than before.  Why would I want this to stop?  In fact, I want more.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sandra turned to the dazed head that recently sprouted from hers and tore it off her body at the neck. The bloody stump quickly spouted two more heads, which she also killed with vicious assaults. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes, &quot; she crooned. &quot;More we need more.&quot;<br />
<br />
She continued until she had over ten heads, each more wicked and evil looking than the last.  They acted like beasts, and snapped angrily at one another.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, &quot; said Sandra as her growth slowed and her transformation completed.  She looked at her many heads. &quot;Now I am invincible, as well as powerful.  No one can kill me.  I am a god!&quot;<br />
<br />
Her heads bucked wildly with excitement.  Some of them shot flames, while others shot ice.  Sandra&#39;s body was massive, and her wings had grown to match her new size.  Her scales were still beautiful and dark, but spikes poked in strange places from all across her body.  Abby was big, but now her head was only waist high to the beast before her.<br />
<br />
Sandra craned down her long neck until her head was just before Abby.  &quot;I would run if I were you,&quot; whispered Sandra.  Soon, all of Sandra&#39;s feral heads turned to glare hungrily at Abby.  <br />
<br />
Sandra didn&#39;t have to tell her twice.  She and her other heads fled into Sandra&#39;s old cave, where Sandra was now much too big to follow.  Abby and her heads hoped Sandra would leave soon.</p>
