<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Blaise crooked a finger from where he lay sprawled out on the couch and Roy felt his feet carrying him closer, he knelt in front of Blaise, his chest rising and falling in slow, easy breaths. &quot;Let&#39;s see what desires a rolling around in that head of yours.&quot; The incubus cupped Roy&#39;s chin, bringing him in close so their mouths lingered less than an inch apart. Roy could feel the warm breath from Blaise passing between his lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you&#39;re a jealous one.&quot; Blaise said after a moment. &quot;So much envy over your two friends. Their easy confidence, Ryan&#39;s height, John&#39;s flirtatiousness, the way they sometimes seem to just look past.. no.. over you.&quot; Roy felt something clench in his chest as Blaise spoke, a little nugget of burning anger in his heart. Blaise raised his hand to Roy&#39;s cheek. &quot;Don&#39;t fret, we&#39;re a close family here, each member important and loved.&quot; Roy leaned into the hand on his cheek, the knot in his chest easing at the words. Roy&#39;s once flat chest began to swell as a warmth spread through him, long underused muscles beginning to grow and stretch under his skin. It felt.. good.<br />
<br />
&quot;See what I can offer you?&quot; Blaise said in an almost purr, running his fingers through Roy&#39;s prematurely thinning hair, the passing of his fingers causing it to thicken as Roy simply nodded, he couldn&#39;t take his eyes of Blaise&#39;s face. His mind felt like it was in a fog, but he also felt like he was thinking more clearly than ever. Why did he put so much trust in Ryan and John, clearly this red-skinned glorious man in front of him was truly worthy of his loyalty and would never forsake him.<br />
<br />
Blaise pulled Roy into a kiss. It was hot, almost uncomfortably so, but in a way Roy never wanted to stop. He felt the demon&#39;s tongue push past his lips, slide along his tongue and kept going. It felt like Blaise was snaking his tongue up into Roy&#39;s brain, tasting his thoughts, his dreams, his hopes, and his desires. He opened his mind to the probing, letting Blaise see every inch of his thoughts before they pulled apart. &quot;I see.&quot; Blaise said softly, almost lovingly. &quot;You want to belong, to be an equal, I know just what you need.&quot;<br />
<br />
Roy was pulled to his feet as Blaise stood off the couch, he no longer seemed to loom over Roy like some impossibly out of reach fantasy, no, now he felt like a protective force looking over him. &quot;Yes..&quot; Blaise purred into his ear. &quot;All you need to do is give yourself up to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Roy lips parted, as he nodded, a soft whisper coming from deep inside him. &quot;Yes.&quot; Roy suddenly felt that hot coal in his chest again and doubled over.<br />
<br />
&quot;I already planted the seed in you, let it grow...&quot; Blaise urged, moving around Roy in a circle, running a warm hand across bare skin. Roy nodded, resisting the urge to fight against that heat and letting it flow into him. His bones burned, but there was no pain, just heat. His limbs began to stretch, his spreading as his shoulder pulled apart, his body stretching and widening. The heat faded and he stood up at his new height, running his hands over his leanly muscled torso. &quot;Do you like it?&quot; Blaise asked. Roy looked to the demon who still stood taller than him, but no longer towered over him. Before he didn&#39;t even come up to Blaise&#39;s shoulders, now he would only need to tip his head upwards to taste those lips again.<br />
<br />
The incubus seems to read his mind, coming in close. &quot;Plenty of time for that later, Toy. I knew you were going to be a fun one to play with. But first, you need a little more meat on those bones of yours.&quot; Blaise slipped around behind him, his hands snaking under his arms and coming to rest on his chest. Roy felt a shiver pass up his spine as Blaise began to massage the barely defined pectorals, working his fingers deep into the muscle. Each squeeze and press made Roy&#39;s chest swell a little more, each tweak of his nipples causing them to become a little more prominent. Occasionally Blaise guided his hands down Roy&#39;s stomach, each pass of the fingers working more groves into his abs, until he was sporting a trim six pack, then around to squeeze his ass, each time his cheeks filling more and more of the incubus&#39; hands.<br />
<br />
As Blaise continued his massage, the growing muscle radiated outwards, his arms and legs beginning to thicken with new cords of strength, a sculpted physique meant to be admired and stared at. His cock still strained outwards from the previous attentions given to it by Blaise, now drooling a thick stream of pre. Roy felt at the edge of orgasm, but something kept him from passing over the tipping point. It was yet another fire burning in him, one that felt so good, yet so painful at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you feel, Toy?&quot; Blaise asked as he slipped back around to stand in front of a heavily panting Roy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amazing.&quot; Roy said honestly, raising his hands to grab a pair of pectorals that he could only ever have dreamed of having before.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re not done yet.&quot; Blaise said with a smile, &quot;Far from it. First, you need a proper beard.&quot; Blaise reached out and ran his fingers long Roy&#39;s jaw, causing a strange crawling sensation. Roy&#39;s hands snapped up to his cheeks, feeling the short, rough beard that had sprouted along his jaw. &quot;For what you desire, you need to be masculine..&quot; Blaise placed a finger between Roy&#39;s pectorals. &quot;Virile.&quot; He dragged his finger down, curly red hairs sprouting in a trail left by the finger. Then it fanned outwards, like a tree spreading its branches. A fine coating of curly hair grew all across his new pectorals, and across his six pack stomach. Right down until the finger touched his cock, causing his pubic hair to grow thicker and denser even as it lightened from brown to red. It continued to spread, thick hair growing in his pits and more down his legs and arms, even a fine downy coating across the twin cheeks of his rear.<br />
<br />
Blaise passed his hand through Roy&#39;s hair again, causing it to once more grow thicker and longer, a shaggy mane that framed his face. Roy could see a few strands across his face as they turned from his old brown color to a vibrant, coppery red. &quot;I&#39;ve always wanted a sexy redhead for my stage.&quot; Blaise cooed, seemingly delighted at the change. &quot;I&#39;m glad to see you want the same.&quot; Roy could see his skin, already pale turn a touch more fair, freckles sprouting along his shoulders and arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren&#39;t you doing this?&quot; Roy asked twisting a bit to get a look at himself.<br />
<br />
Blaise shook his head. &quot;I facilitate. This is your desire. To stand out, to grab attention. You certainly do.&quot; Roy found himself rewarded with another of Blaise&#39;s spicy hot kisses, and much to his surprise and delight he felt the demon&#39;s cock harden and press against his already throbbing member.<br />
<br />
After the kiss broke, Roy opened his mouth but was silenced by a finger pressed against his lips. &quot;I know what you want, and all in good time, but you&#39;re not done yet. We brought out the human you want to be, but we&#39;re not human, are we?&quot;<br />
<br />
Roy shook his head, knowing full well what was coming next. Blaise reached down and gripped Roy&#39;s cock in his hand once more. Stroking it slowly, gently. Each time coaxing out a little more length and girth, and then it began to change, the skin turning red as the head of his cock narrowed into a tip. A strange popping sensation came from the base of his cock as two bulges formed on either side. Red hair began to take on the texture of fur as it grew even thicker, covering his swelling balls. A thick ring of furry skin formed around the base of his shaft, tucked back behind his swollen knot.<br />
<br />
Roy stared at his reshaped cock in both horror and fascination. Though with each passing moment it was less of the former and more of the latter. &quot;This is your mark.&quot; Blaise said, still lovingly stroking Roy&#39;s lupine cock like a prized hound. &quot;Even as a human, it shows your true nature.&quot; It was huge. For him. Almost as large as the monster Blaise sported.<br />
<br />
&quot;You understand now?&quot; Roy nodded in response. &quot;Then let it out.&quot; Blaise said with an encouraging smile. &quot;Its in you, you just need to free it.&quot; Roy felt deep down, and found that little nugget of anger than had burned with him at the very beginning of this. All his jealousy and envy, and he reached inside himself and broke it.<br />
<br />
Roy dropped to his knees, his bones snapping and muscle tearing. It sounded horrible but it felt amazing. Like nothing he had ever experienced before. It was pure adrenaline. His already enhanced frame put on more muscle, growing even bigger. His red hair turned soft and furlike, spreading along his shifting form in a bright blaze of orange and red. Claws burst from his fingertips and toes as he legs twisted and reformed under him, his feet becoming massive paws. He arched his back, feeling something completely new slide free from the base of his spine, quickly growing a thick coat of fur as his new tail swished behind him. At the other end of his body, a muzzle pushed out from his face, splitting his vision with the orange snout. An urge formed deep within him, he stretched his face upward to the ceiling and let out a long howl.<br />
<br />
A hand came to rest on his head between twitching ears. Roy looked up to see Blaise smiling down at him, approvingly. &quot;Wonderful. A three werewolf show. Maybe I&#39;ll call you the Cerberus brothers. Hmm... that gives me other ideas.&quot; The incubus said with a devilish grin that made Roy eager and excited to know what that plan could be.<br />
<br />
Roy heard the door to the dressing room creak open and a gruff, somewhat familiar voice spoke up. &quot;Boss, Tank&#39;s on stage, we found him. Is that..?&quot; Roy looked over to see the hirsute man from earlier standing in the doorway once more. Jay? Thick and stocky, and he gave off a smell that made Roy&#39;s cock twitch. Behind him stood another man, taller and a bit leaner, but still well muscled. He looked less hairy, but that might just be the fact he was blond. He looked equally as eager as Jay as his eyes settled on Roy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jay, Ty, just in time. I found you a brother.&quot; Blaise stepped away from Roy, causing him to whimper slightly. &quot;Why don&#39;t you welcome him to the pack? Put on a little show for me.&quot; Blaise said as he slunk back over to his couch and sprawled out.<br />
<br />
Jay and Ty stepped into the room. They were wearing twin outfits, of black leather harnesses with silver studs, chaps, and codpieces. Roy wanted very much to try that outfit on himself, and he knew he&#39;d soon get the chance, but instead his two brothers were stripping out of their outfits as if they couldn&#39;t get them off fast enough. Chaps and codpieces fell to the floor of the dressing room, revealing each man had a lupine sheathe despite their human bodies, with their cocks already beginning to emerge from their furry homes.<br />
<br />
Roy crawled forward and stuck his snout right in Jay&#39;s crotch, nosing his emerging shaft and encouraging it out. Jay started shifting right in front of him with an aroused and eager growl. He felt a nose then a tongue under his tail, and turned to see Ty, the blond was shifting as well, turning into a golden-furred beast, who was already lapping at Roy&#39;s tail hole with his tongue. It made him squirm, but Jay reclaimed his attention by shoving a very erect wolf cock into his face, which he eagerly took into his toothy muzzle. Lapping at it with his rough tongue.<br />
<br />
A few more laps were given to Roy&#39;s tail ring before he felt something else pressing up against it, and with an encouraging flick of his tail, Ty thrust inside him. Neither of his lupine brothers were small, their lupine cocks would put nearly any human to shame, though there was a small part of him that noticed he was the biggest of the three between the legs, and a little bit of satisfaction. But he&#39;d treat them to that later, for now he was enjoying being spitroasted by his pack. Though they wouldn&#39;t be jealous of him, he knew. They were equals.<br />
<br />
Blaise reclined on the couch, stroking himself as he watched the show unfold. &quot;Oh yes, this will be very popular.&quot;</p>
