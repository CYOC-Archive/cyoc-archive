<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Can we go?&quot; Karen asked softly as she at at the dinner table at the Talbot home.<br />
<br />
The evening had gone fairly well, though Karen was still nervous about Jenny and very much wanted to see Jenny face to face.  True, neither she nor the Talbots knew the Jenkins family personally, but things that effected them would obviously affect Jenny and that was what worried Karen. Not knowing that Wilhelm&#39;s agent had been caught, Karen also had the concern that if this guy was willing to try a drive by shooting in the morning, there wasn&#39;t much to stop him from trying again when the word came out that he&#39;d missed his intended target or that his target survived the earlier encounter.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t see any legal reason that says you can&#39;t go,&quot; Peter said slowly from his seat at the table, &quot;but...&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen looked between Peter and his father Leon as Peter&#39;s voice tapered off at the end. Neither looked particularly confident, though Leon Talbot was still chewing on the piece of steak he had in his mouth. The answer was not the one that Karen liked the sound of as it gave more of an opinion of &quot;no&quot; than &quot;yes,&quot; which was what Karen wanted.<br />
<br />
&quot;From what you told us, dear, is that Jenny was not directly harmed,&quot; Regina Talbot spoke up, &quot;and while none of us like this any more than you, it isn&#39;t our business to interfere in affairs that for the moment relate only to the Jenkins family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But Jenny is my best friend,&quot; Karen spoke, &quot;I want to let her know I&#39;m here for her...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that is commendable,&quot; Leon spoke, &quot;but while we may be able to talk with the Jenkins family regarding security for the wedding, THAT will be something better served to wait until they aren&#39;t dealing with an injured loved one. As that is where our business and their business intersects.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d still wish to be there for Jenny,&quot; Karen spoke, &quot;the guy may not have hit Harry or even shot at her, but he&#39;s still representative of the the whole situation with her family. Let her know that she is loved by everyone and that she isn&#39;t at fault for all of this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter and Leon traded brief looks but realized that Karen wasn&#39;t to back off on the issue. Eventually, Peter gave a shrug and agreed to Karen&#39;s request.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose if that is what you wish, we can try for a brief visit,&quot; Peter spoke, &quot;but we cannot stay for long as we do not want to be on anyone&#39;s toes or butting into business that is not ours.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The hospital parking lot was fairly quiet by the time that William and Martha arrived. Much like Karen, they had come to give Jenny a brief voice of comfort and offer whatever support that they could manage in the situation. William clearly saw Jenny as something of an adopted daughter in many ways, and Martha wasn&#39;t exactly opposed to that. From what William had told her, Jenny&#39;s parents really didn&#39;t do Jenny any favors as parents, and the girl deserved far more than that. Especially with all the indications that Jenny&#39;s family might not accept all the changes that had happened in Jenny&#39;s life.  This agent of Dieter Wilhelm&#39;s being the latest of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe a guy would do this,&quot; Martha said softly to William as they reached the front doors that whisked open as they stepped on the pressure sensors, &quot;I mean... think on the poor Jenkins parents... the ones we met at your formal induction into the Skulk. They seemed like nice people and didn&#39;t deserve anything remotely close to this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I agree,&quot; William answered, &quot;they don&#39;t... but I suppose some people really have their own personal wants and desires well above what is right and wrong... and maybe, I&#39;m the wrong person to make that comment...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;An extramarital affair is not comparable with attempted murder or conspiracy to commit murder,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;and in the end, you realized just how in the wrong you were. This Dieter Wilhelm has done no such thing, if this guy was SECOND agent that he&#39;s sent here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You two are here to see the Jenkins as well?&quot; came a male voice making both William and Martha jump.<br />
<br />
There hadn&#39;t been many people around when they had arrived, but it wasn&#39;t exactly an empty parking lot. There were a few other people there, and William thought he&#39;d noticed a young man and a young woman getting out of a older but classic car not to far away from where William had parked the Anderson family car. As they looked back, they found themselves looking to the two new arrivals. One was a young male, impressively built, almost identical to Dean Myers in terms of musculature, though the scent was that of a different large feline, a lion rather than the dean&#39;s tiger. The young woman was noticeably shorter than her company and even shorter than William and Martha. Her scent also gave her away as a normal. The young man was even a few inches taller than William and Martha.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; William said slowly, &quot;William Anderson... and this is my wife Martha.  We met Henry Sr. and Lisa Jenkins at the induction ceremony that the Skulk had for myself, Jennifer Harper, and Harold Jenkins. We&#39;re here to offer all of them what support we can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even if it isn&#39;t much,&quot; Martha added, &quot;as friends... or at least hopeful friends of all of the parties involved in this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d suppose that shows you care,&quot; the male spoke, &quot;I&#39;m Peter Talbot and this is Karen Yuletide. She is Jenny&#39;s roommate and is wanting to make sure her friend is okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I suppose it best to move together,&quot; William offered and gestured with one hand into the hospital building.<br />
<br />
The two pairs then slowly walked into the hospital, and like Frances had earlier in the day, they found that Jenny and the Jenkins family in ICU waiting room where they waiting for full access to Huck Jenkins. They then made their way to that room and found Henry Jenkins Sr. talking with a young normal woman while Harry and Jenny sat in chairs nearby. The young normal woman was talking about wedding plans of some kind, but none of them knew whether they related Jenny&#39;s wedding or to another wedding. That conversation ended when Jenny looked up to notice the new arrivals.<br />
<br />
&quot;Karen! Mr. Anderson!&quot; Jenny spoke recognizing them right away.<br />
<br />
&quot;I came to make sure you were alright,&quot; Karen said quickly and moved to hug Jenny, before looking to a surprised Henry Jenkins Sr., &quot;I&#39;m sorry you&#39;ve had to go through all this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fine, ma&#39;am,&quot; Henry Jenkins spoke, &quot;though I do thank you for your concern.&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry then looked up to William and Martha, &quot;I remember you two from Harry and Jenny&#39;s induction into the Skulk... I take it you&#39;re here to check on her and Harry?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Primarily to make sure Jenny is okay,&quot; William answered, &quot;as she will need a family... and since her own biological parents seem unable or uninterested to do so... my family and I are more than willing to fill that role and give whatever help and advice we can. And we got along fairly well at the induction ceremony as well... so there is also the wish to offer what little we can to help you, sir. As you certainly didn&#39;t deserve this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can agree there,&quot; Henry answered, &quot;but I&#39;d suppose there were some good things...&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry Sr. then reached over to touch Betty&#39;s shoulder as she watched the two sets of new arrivals.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Betty Timid,&quot; Henry Sr. introduced her, &quot;and while I wish it could have happened differently... but she and my oldest son, Huck, have apparently been such good friends for years that they loved each other and never knew it, until today. They&#39;ve even thought to get married as well. Right now, Lisa&#39;s with Huck showering him with all the love a worried mother can give and seeing what the plans are from his perspective.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At the same time as yours?&quot; Karen asked to Jenny.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Betty answered, &quot;Huck and I agreed that&#39;d get in the way of Jenny and Harry&#39;s day. We&#39;ll have a small and more private ceremony about a week later. That&#39;ll depend on how well Huck heals... Thank goodness though that the doctors are confident that he&#39;ll be back to one hundred percent in no time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, hopefully, you&#39;ll be happy,&quot; Peter spoke as he moved beside Karen and shook hands with Jenny and Harry and then with both Betty and Henry Sr., &quot;and, Mr. Jenkins, you can be assured that my father and Moon Lake&#39;s werelions will assist the Skulk to keep as much trouble as possible out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Henry Sr. answered with a smile smile, &quot;It&#39;s nice to see so many people care.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Jenny managed a small smile and hugged Karen again, &quot;Thanks for caring.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re my best friend,&quot; Karen hugged Jenny back, &quot;I have to make sure you&#39;re doing okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I&#39;m doing okay, all things considered,&quot; Jenny answered, &quot;the bad guy was caught and no one blames me for the incident.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn&#39;t your fault, dear,&quot; Martha told her, reiterating the points made by the others that Jenny had talked with through the day.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we&#39;ll all make sure that your day goes well for you,&quot; Peter promised, &quot;as you deserve that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny and Harry both smiled at that.</p>
