<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kathryn changed into suitable clothing, practical business attire, in order to visit a local elementary school. It was a private Catholic school for boys.  <br />
<br />
Their uniforms were separated by grade. K through 4th grade, had to wear blue trousers, a white button down shirt, and either a blue long sleeve sweater, or a blue short sleeve sweater vest. The sweater had the school logo on the left breast. The 5th and 6th graders had the same uniforms, but had to wear a tie to denote their seniority as they are about to leave the elementary school, destined for the Catholic junior-senior high school (7th through 12th grade). <br />
<br />
Kathryn quickly noticed that some of the teachers were female. She saw a particularly gorgeous female enter into what was the 3rd grade class room. Long blond hair, sharp green eyes, perfectly smooth milky white skin, with a youthful bust body and long legs. She was pretty tall, close to 6 ft.She looked like she was in her late 20s. <br />
<br />
Kathryn followed her to the classroom, and knocked on the door right behind her. It was the early morning, a half hour before the students begin to arrive.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, excuse me,&quot; she said politely, smiling a bright toothy grin at the beautiful young 4th grade teacher. She turned and looked at Kathryn. &quot;May I come in? I&#39;m from the department of health, and I&#39;m here to inspect the school and each other classrooms.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. I didn&#39;t know I was going to have a visitor today,&quot; said the teacher.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, of course. It&#39;s a random inspection I was assigned to carry out. The school was only notified yesterday that I would be around.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK. Of course. Come right in. I&#39;m Trisha Atwood,&quot; the young teacher said, extending her hand in greeting.<br />
<br />
Kathryn grinned and shook her hand. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you....Ms?....Atwood.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mrs. But please, just call me Trish or Trisha. I don&#39;t like &#39;Mrs.&#39; from other adults.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course. Trisha it is then,&quot; said Kathryn still smiling. &quot;I&#39;ll just a quick look around. You won&#39;t even notice me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course. As you wish,&quot; said Trisha. <br />
<br />
Kathryn continued smiling, as she set about looking around the room. Inside student desks, along the base of the walls. She noticed a class photo of the current class hung up on the inside of the classroom door.  It was a fairly large print, so it could easily be viewed.<br />
<br />
In the photograph, the camera was facing the chalkboard. The letters of the alphabet was on a long poster-like thing that was taped to the wall above the chalkboard, strung lengthwise from wall to wall. It had both standard block script for each letter upper and lowercase. Each letter was paired with its cursive counterpart.<br />
<br />
The class with each boy as well as Trish, were smiling. (Two of the boys with goofy faces), their backs to the chalkboard, facing the camera. The photo subtly changed. A new boy, slightly shorter than the rest and one of the few with a goofy mischievous look on his face. The new boy had dark brown hair, very curly; like springs. Neatly trimmed on top, with a neat fade on the sides. The type of hair that would otherwise be perpetually messy when allowed to grow out. <br />
<br />
Kathryn appeared in the photo where Trisha was supposed to be standing. The teacher&#39;s desk appeared in the far left hand corner of the photo at the front of the classroom and to the left. Even more subtly, a small statue of a golden-colored boy with a terrified look stuck on his face appeared on that desk.....<br />
<br />
Satisfied with the changes she made in the photo, Kathryn walked to the to the back of the room and started rooting around the teacher&#39;s desk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um. Excuse me? Please. Don&#39;t touch my desk, it&#39;s private,&quot; said Trisha, crossing the room towards Kathryn. <br />
<br />
Straightening up, smiling, Kathryn answered;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am a health inspector, and it is my duty to inspect the classrooms thoroughly. Besides, this is school property. It IS subject to random inspections.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. Well. I don&#39;t really appreciate someone coming into my room unannounced and start rooting through the drawers of my desk. It is discourteous,&quot; said Trisha. &quot;Besides, it&#39;s been 20 minutes, and my boys will be coming into the classroom in the next ten minutes. So....if you please....?&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the students&#39; desks shifted backwards, and Trisha&#39;s desk as well as both Trish and Kathryn, appeared in the front of the room, on the far side opposite the classroom door. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa! What happened?&quot; asked Trish. Looking around at the strange changes, Trish was caught completely off guard and was confused. <br />
<br />
&quot;You just witnessed.....MAGIC!&quot; said Kathryn.<br />
<br />
&quot;What...? Who....who are you? Did you just change my room?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For the better, I assure you. The teacher&#39;s desk should always be at the front of the class, so she can keep her eyes on her students.&quot; <br />
<br />
Confused, Trisha began to protest, but was silenced by the witch. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come. Let me show you another little change I&#39;ve made,&quot; Kathryn interrupted. <br />
<br />
She walked over to the door, closed it, and pointed at the class photo. <br />
<br />
&quot;Look carefully. Do you notice anything different?&quot;<br />
<br />
More curious, Trisha followed Kathry over to the other side of the room. She looked at the photo, and instantly recognized the desk was now in it. She also notice.....she was not in the photo, but this strange visitor was! Standing in the place where Trisha was supposed to be standing! But it was her classroom, and her students!<br />
<br />
&quot;Well? Notice anything.....different...?&quot; Kathryn pressed after a minute of inspecting the photograph. <br />
........<br />
&quot;Well? Do you?&quot; after another moment of silence from Trish.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m....I&#39;m not in it...&quot; Trish responded in confusion and growing fear. What was going on?<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, on the contrary. You are. Look carefully at your....uh...MY....students.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yours...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Silence when I am speaking to you! Look! See anyone you do not recognize?&quot;<br />
<br />
Miffed, Trish did shut up and looked closer at each other face. Upon inspection, she noticed a new little 10 year old boy that wasn&#39;t there before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s that?&quot; Trish asked, pointing at the strange curly-haired boy, dressed in the school&#39;s proper uniform for those below the 5th grade.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why....you don&#39;t recognize him? Well....maybe not yet. But you will, soon enough. And you&#39;ll come to know that face. At least, a reversal of that face anyway, as mirrors tend to reverse images. Hahaha....&quot;<br />
<br />
While Kathryn was talking, Trisha could only stand there, frozen in place as she watched the picture on the door slowly getting higher and the strange woman slowly getting taller. Little did Trish know, her long straight blond hair was also slowly getting shorter, getting darker, and wavier. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now. Your desk is going to be about.....in the middle of the class.&quot; The students&#39; desks slightly moved in order to accommodate a new small desk for a new small 10 year old boy. A new name tag appeared on the new desk: Michael. The new name was written in large cursive script in red on green construction paper, and taped to the top. Just like all the other boys&#39; desks.<br />
<br />
Trish  felt her head was much lighter and cooler as her now much darker hair sucked into the sides of her head into a nice fade, curled into springs that were neatly trimmed on top. The color of her hair settled into a nearly black color. <br />
<br />
Her vision went fuzzy for a moment. Color and lighting noticeably shifted into softer, warmer tones than she was used to with the change of eye color from her sharp green eyes, to much softer dark brown. <br />
<br />
During these changes, her face had also been feeling funny, as her facial features shifted into a much more youthful appearance. Her body went through the same, as her fingers and toes also changed shape. Her insides shifted as her vagina sealed shut, and a little boy&#39;s penis snaked it&#39;s way into her changing underwear.<br />
<br />
Speaking of underwear, Trish noticed her clothes were changing and shifting about on her frame. Her heart stopped as her casual business attire turned into the navy blue pants and sweater combo of her students&#39; uniforms. The school crest appeared on her left breast. Or....whatever was left of her left breast, as her female breasts had shrunk down into the flat chest of the boy she was apparently becoming. <br />
<br />
Throughout all of these changes, Trisha continued shrinking until she reached her new 4 ft. 5 in. height she would be restricted to. A couple of inches shorter than the next shortest boy in her 4th grade class. Last to appear, were a a pair of smart black casual Doc Marten dress shoes on her small feet with nicely rugged soles on the bottoms suitable for an active boy her new age.</p>
