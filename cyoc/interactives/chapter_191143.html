<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dave browsed the selection of beers. He tried to remember what Todd had given him last night, but finally just picked a few of his own favorite brands. He added a bottle of whiskey to his cart for good measure, he felt like he was going to need something harder this weekend. He felt someone staring at him and looked over to see a woman in her late twenties eyeing him up and down appreciatively. She was quite attractive, and it had been a long time since anyone had looked at him that way. Well.. not exactly that way, he had never been quite what he was right now, but he hadn&#39;t been unattractive.<br />
<br />
He returned a polite smile. Strangely, while he felt pleased to have someone giving him that look he had no similar feeling welling up in him. She just wasn&#39;t what he wanted he realized with a start. A woman was looking him up and down like a piece of meat and he.. didn&#39;t care. Two days ago he would have killed to have that sort of attention. Had things really gone so far? Uneasy, he headed up to the registers and started unloading his purchases.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I see your ID?&quot; Dave looked up into the eyes of the dark haired young man behind the register, looking confused. He hadn&#39;t heard those words in years. The young man almost looked like a dark haired Todd, if not for the bit of scruff on a sharper chin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;ID. Store policy, anyone who looks under 35. Bit excessive I know but the boss&#39; rule.&quot; The young man offered an apologetic smile as he eyed Dave, quite a bit similarly to the young woman. This time he felt a curiosity welling in him from the look. He tamped it down. Hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;How old do you think I am?&quot; Dave asked as he dug for his wallet, feeling a moment of panic. Would the ID even be convincing anymore? Last thing he needed was to be arrested for trying to pass of another ID as his. He held it out, trying to keep his face calm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thirty?&quot; The young man said with a shrug. Taking the license. Dave boggled. Had he really lost a whole decade? &quot;Hey, thirty-three. I was close.&quot; The cashier smiled and he returned it as he took back his ID. Thirty-three? He glanced at the card in his hands. It had changed. The birthdate, his height, his weight, and even the picture. The man staring back at him was only vaguely recognizable as himself. Maybe a family member of his old face, but that thick full head of black hair, the stubble, those thick eye brows, the strong chin. Was th world changing around him or was he just going mad?<br />
<br />
He looked up as he was given his total and paid quickly with one of his cards. The cashier scribbled something onto the receipt and handed it over. &quot;Have a nice day.&quot; Dave grinned at the man and grabbed his purchases, only glancing to the receipt on his way to the door. At the bottom was scribbled &#39;Mike&#39; and a phone number. It made him feel a little giddy. It only lasted until he loaded up the bags in the car with his stuff from the apartment and sat in the driver&#39;s seat.<br />
<br />
Rolling down his window, he moved the side mirror to reflect his face. Staring back at him was the same face as on the ID. He touched his cheek with his other hand, feeling the slightly unfamiliar contours. Fundamentally, he still looked like himself but the changes were noticeable. Maybe he should grow out that stubble more, a short beard would really accent his jaw well. He shook his head. This was not the time to be thinking about styling. He shoved his mirror back into place and drove back to Todd&#39;s lost in thought.<br />
<br />
A handful of minutes later he was knocking on the apartment door and Todd opened it up. He moved aside so Dave could get in then helped him with the load by taking the beers to the kitchen. &quot;Welcome back, how&#39;d it go? If you don&#39;t mind me asking?&quot; Todd sounded his usual chipper self, and Dave found himself watching his ass in those tight jeans as he went into the kitchen. He quickly took his boxes to his cubby hole of a room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oddly. Found out she hadn&#39;t only kicked me out but was cheating on me.&quot; He stepped out of the room to see Todd watching him from the kitchen, sympathy on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, man, I&#39;m sorry. Anything I can do to help? Something you want for dinner?&quot; Todd seemed genuinely interested in doing whatever he could. It was something about him that had used to piss Dave off. He thought it was an act, brown nosing to the bosses. But it wasn&#39;t, Todd was just an annoyingly nice guy.<br />
<br />
Dave imagined walking over to Todd and pushing him up against a wall. Kissing him as he..<br />
<br />
Dave instead walked over to the couch and sat down. &quot;Nah, I just.. Weirdly I don&#39;t care. We were never right for each other anyway.&quot; Todd sat down next to him, hand coming to rest on Dave&#39;s arm, giving his newly thickened bicep a squeeze. He felt so much bigger than Todd now. They had been of a size only yesterday but now he had a few inches and quite a bit of weight on the other man. &quot;Todd.&quot; He said, finally. &quot;Does something seem.. off? Like things are just not the way they were or supposed to be or, I dunno? Things are just different?&quot;<br />
<br />
Todd shook his head. &quot;Only things different are how well you&#39;re taking being dumped and cheated on, and that beard you let grow from living in your car for a week. Sometimes wish I could grow a beard that well, but.. I don&#39;t think I could pull it off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Beard? Dave reached up fingers to his jaw, meeting a short but full beard instead of stubble. Hadn&#39;t he just been thinking.. &quot;Don&#39;t shave it off though, it looks good on you. Dave leaned in and kissed Todd. Not the peck from earlier in the day but hungry and needy. He felt Todd&#39;s hand sliding under his shirt, running along his stomach and chest, ruffling something under his shirt that felt good to have fingers running through. The kiss broke, but only so Todd could pull Dave&#39;s shirt off, then his own.<br />
<br />
Dave&#39;s chest and stomach were covered in a dusting of curly dark hair, thicker towards the center of his rounded pectorals, and in a strip over his  taught abs. Dave stared at his own six-pack in bewilderment. When has his stomach gotten so taught. Comparatively, Todd was lean and smooth, just the faintest hint of definition along his own torso.<br />
<br />
With a hand on his chest, Todd lightly pushed Dave back to lay down, then pulled his shorts down, letting Dave&#39;s hardening cock slip free. That was no average sized member between his legs anymore. It was longer, probably close to seven inches and thick, thick enough to make it look a bit shorter than it was. Pre glistened on the tip, slowly dripping down his shaft. Todd lifted himself off the couch to shimmy out of his jeans and let them fall to the floor, then he was on to of Dave, their cocks pressed together as he leaned in wrapping his lips around one of Dave&#39;s nipples again. Todd really did like playing with those, and Dave&#39;s were a bit on the large side, which seemed to please the younger man as he nipped at first one, then the other.<br />
<br />
Dave rolled his head back and just let Todd do what he wanted. It had been so long since someone pleasured him, he always seemed to have to be the one to do that work. He felt Todd&#39;s wait lift off of him, eyes opening in time to feel Todd grab his cock, and then the younger man was lowering himself onto the thick shaft, wincing slightly but moaning softly as Dave felt his cock slide into the tight warmth of Todd&#39;s hole. The feeling was so strange but so... good. He gripped Todd&#39;s hips to hold him as the other man began to slide up and down his cock, Todd&#39;s cock bobbing and slapping against Dave&#39;s stomach.<br />
<br />
He felt his orgasm building, Todd&#39;s moans growing louder and more insistent. Todd clenched around his cock as he came, cum spurting from his cock along Dave&#39;s stomach, the tightening of Todd&#39;s muscles around his own shaft bringing him to climax seconds later as he shot his thick seed into Todd.<br />
<br />
Panting and sweaty, the younger man laid himself on top of Dave, his head coming to rest on Dave&#39;s shoulder and chest, unconcerned for the cum quickly drying now smeared on both their stomachs. Dave&#39;s cock slipped free as it softened, but Todd stayed where he was, looking quite content. Dave felt a smile across his own face, even as his chest rose and fell in deep breaths as he came down from his high.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope that wasn&#39;t just a rebound fuck.&quot; Todd said, looking up at Dave.<br />
<br />
&quot;You started it.&quot; Dave responded with a laugh, one hand caressing Todd&#39;s backside. Soon though, both men drifted off and for once Dave wasn&#39;t too worried about what was happening to him, something was starting to feel right.</p>
