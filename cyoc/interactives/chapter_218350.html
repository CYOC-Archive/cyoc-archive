<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Benjamin stood completely still, the feeling of an incoming transformation has become all too familiar. This same feeling now flooded through his nerves, it was happening.<br />
Liam darted around his friend, more excited than scared. Benjamin always believed that the boy fantasized about transforming into an animal, which could sometimes really annoy the boy. But in the end, Benjamin was very happy to have a friend who thinks it would be cool to transform, instead of one who would laugh at him.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t see anything yet!&quot; Liam spurted out, while Matthew looked at his watch. &quot;It&#39;s 12:00PM, I need to go to work, I am sorry bud, I wish I could be here, but I can&#39;t cancel this work trip, I&#39;ll be back before long!&quot; Matthew said with hint of grief, he hated it when he had to go to work while his little brother was suffering another transformation, and now especially since he had to be gone for at least a month!<br />
Benjamin started to move again for a bit and looked at the ground. &quot;It&#39;s okay, I know. Don&#39;t worry I will be here with Liam, and if necessary, I can get to Rupert!&quot; said the young boy to his big brother.<br />
The two quickly shared a hug and helped load in a couple bags into the car. &quot;I&#39;ll see you when I get back, okay? You can always call me!&quot; Matthew said, as he waved his brother goodbye and drove off.<br />
<br />
Waving his brother goodbye, Benjamin felt a pinch in his backside. &quot;Ouch, what was that!&quot; He said as he quickly spun around, only to see Liam standing right there, with his hand stretched out. <br />
&quot;Sorry, sorry, I think your tail is growing in!&quot; Liam said pointing towards his friends back.<br />
Benjamin swung his head around to try to look at his behind, there was a faint hint of blonde hairs sticking out of his pants, looking just like the tail hairs of a horse.<br />
Ben quickly stuck his hand down his pants, there was definitely a tail there!<br />
&quot;Yeah, feels like it is a tail&quot; The boy said as he turned back towards Liam, who was once again looking at him funny.<br />
&quot;What is it? Can you see something else?&quot; Ben asked worried, the changes shouldn&#39;t be this fast!<br />
&quot;No, nothing yet, just remembered that my dad asked my to ask you something&quot; Liam said, looking kinda embarrassed.<br />
The two boys walked towards the field, near the stables.<br />
Inside these stables was a converted stall, bigger then the others, specially altered for Benjamin&#39;s transformations. It had a comfortable bed, a water and feeding trough and an actual TV.<br />
 Whilst the boys were walking, Benjamin could feel his tail growing longer and longer, until it hang passed his knees.<br />
&quot;Ugh, I hate tails, my pants are now incredibly uncomfortable&quot; Ben said annoyed, leading on a fence, he turned towards his friend.<br />
&quot;You needed to ask me something?&quot; he asked, as Liam suddenly looked very uncomfortable once again.<br />
&quot;Yeah, so... uhm... Dad wanted me to ask you something, in case you ever turned into a stallion..&quot; Liam said, as his friend was struggling with his tail, trying to keep his pants up, as he rose his head back towards Liam. &quot;What do you need to ask? Just say it, your worrying me&quot; Ben said back towards his friend, annoyed by his tail.<br />
&quot;Okay, here goes, dude, are you even listening?&quot; Liam tried to ask his question, but his friend was too busy with holding up his pants and trying to accomodate his tail, that he wasn&#39;t really paying attention. &quot;Just take off your pants, jeez, I really don&#39;t mind, we are completely alone, no one will see you, you&#39;re gonna have to take them off sooner or later anyway&quot; Liam said frustrated at his friend. &quot;I know, I know, but I don&#39;t want to be naked already, I didn&#39;t put on any underwear!&quot; Ben protested. Liam wanted to say something again but Benjamin looked up at his friend, and gave up, and pulled down his pants, his tail now free and from it&#39;s restraints and his genitals hanging floppily between his pants, but Ben quickly put his hands in front of his parts.<br />
&quot;That does feel better, but kinda awkward&quot; He said to Liam.<br />
&quot;Dude I have seen your parts more than once, relax&quot; Liam said to his friend. &quot;That was different, I was an animal&quot; Ben quickly defended. &quot;So, you&#39;re about to be one again anyway&quot; Liam quickly said to his friend, who was now looking defeated and removed his hands from his groin.<br />
&quot;Okay fine, you wanted to ask me something&quot; Ben quickly changed the subject, trying to avoid attention to his small member.<br />
Ben was the typical late bloomer, his height was just starting to catch up and his parts were also still struggling to maintain a relevant size.<br />
&quot;Yeah, about that, you know we keep other horses around the farm right?&quot; Liam said and asked. &quot;Yeah, your dad has a couple, I have seen them before&quot; Ben answered, not knowing where his friend is going with his question.<br />
&quot;So, a month ago, our only stallion died due old age. And now the breeding program here has kind of hit the rocks&quot;, As soon as these words left Liam&#39;s mouth, Ben&#39;s head shot up, looking really embarrassed, he knew exactly what his friend was going to ask him.<br />
&quot;Wait stop!&quot; Ben said, interrupting his friend, &quot;You want me to stud your mares?!?&quot;.<br />
Liam looked at his friend with an awkward smile, &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s actually kind of what we need you to do. Since Hyrus, our stallion, died we found out just how financially dependant we were on selling the foals, and we are kind off in debt right now, which you could help us out off&quot;, Liam said, looking worried. His father shared almost every detail of the farm with him, after Liam wanted to be more involved, this includes bad news every once in a while.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know Liam, I... I... I never even had sex with a human! I don&#39;t know what to think of it&quot; Ben stuttered out, wanting to help his friend, but unsure of his capabilities.<br />
Still the thought of having sex, even as a horse was enticing.<br />
&quot;Well, not to be rude Ben, but I think you do know what to think&quot; Liam said, pointing towards his friends penis, which was as erect as it could be, even a little wet with some pre.<br />
Just before Ben could say something however, he noticed something else about his member.<br />
He looked down and even though it was as erect as it could be, it was still growing.</p>
