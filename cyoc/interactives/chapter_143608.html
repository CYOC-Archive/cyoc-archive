<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty paused for a moment and really started to think about his situation. He recalled the recent sensation of growing heavier and stronger with muscle and blushed as he stood in the front yard sprouting wood. He quickly turned back and went inside the house.<br />
<br />
Once inside, Ty stripped and sat on the couch to gently stroke and tease his bulge to full size. It was a little more substantial than he remembered it and it felt really good. Absently stroking himself up and down, he began to think of the possibilities. He rubbed his harder stronger body with his free hand and savored the feelings it gave him.<br />
<br />
He looked around the house he had grown up in. One daily hell after another. Abuse, neglect, and pain was the order of the day. With all the bad attached to it, why would he bother to stay? Why would he want to be around these people? He looked out the closed living room shades and sighed at the boring suburban neighborhood. His boner had gone down and he simply sat and stared.<br />
<br />
Fuck it, Ty decided. I don&#39;t have to live here anymore. I don&#39;t have to be Ty the loser anymore. I can be whatever I want to be.<br />
<br />
Ty tossed his clothes on the floor angrily and stomped upstairs to his room. Once there, he stared at his naked self in the mirror of his dresser and considered. He turned, flexed his new muscle, and experimentally tried to press himself stronger. It worked, of course. Ty was overwhelmed by the sensations of slowly growing musculature as he hardened himself outward again, his lean muscle expanding. The tingles and stretching were undeniably erotic, as was the very concept that he was transforming. Ty watched himself grow from a small boy with some definition to a small boy with a subtle six pack, larger and defined pecks, and tight bulging arms and legs. Not bad. Not huge and restrictive, but he was definitely athletic and built. He stopped his growth and took a nervous breath.<br />
<br />
He wanted to be a man. He wanted to grow up and leave &quot;Ty&quot; behind. He watched in the mirror carefully and held a vision in his head. He felt the tingles, the pulses all over, and began to breath excitedly. The small muscular boy began to grow into a larger muscular teen. Ty practically cried with joy as he began to approach his proper body. From 4&#39;8&quot; he grew to 5&#39;4&quot;. He brushed hands over a fine dusting of male hair that he had lacked, cupped his larger balls and gasped. He reached back and fondled his tight ass and shapely thighs. He looked so manly and strong, not out of place on Dustin&#39;s team. Just some guy.<br />
<br />
Ty progressed himself further. He grew himself stronger. He changed his face, chiseled his jaw, shrunk his high cheeks, blued his brown eyes, and gave himself golden blonde hair. He stared back at a handsome man of 20. Athletic, six feet even. The unfamiliar face smiled in the mirror. No, he thought, not big enough. He broadened his shoulders, pressed himself larger, and grew to a sexy and hardened example of masculinity. He increased his height, his features, and settled on becoming a solid six and a half feet tall with a rugged outdoorsy body, hard and perfect with male muscle. He stroked rock hard abs, slapped his pecs with perfect manly hands, brushed his body hair, his pubes, and stroked his rough blonde beard.<br />
<br />
All the growth had left him flagged and hard. His cock of six inches bobbed excitedly in front of him. He looked down, gripped it, and decided to hell with it. The rest of him was bigger. Why be average when he could be exceptional?<br />
<br />
Ty grunted as the tingles began to course down his shaft. He felt it swell thicker in his hand and moaned as the length began to stretch away from his body. He watched in amazement and excitement as his penis lengthened and thickened. Thicker at the base and slowly tapering to a plump cocktip some twelve inches away. He stared in gaping satisfaction and turned, admiring his large and throbbing member. A full foot of manhood. He gripped the base of the shaft in his thumb and index finger and found at its full size he could barely curl the two fingers around its girth. This stayed steady to the head where it slimmed only slightly, but that big sensitive mushroom tip more than made up for it.<br />
<br />
Ty smiled at his gorgeous new physique and flexed, bulging his bicep. He was perfect. Big, built, manly, tall, well hung. He was everything he had ever hoped to become.<br />
<br />
After a warm erotic shower, Ty emerged, towelled off, and stared at the hunk in the mirror. He chuckled slightly. If Man Up Mark could see him now. He threw on some pit stick, and then realized he had no clothes.<br />
<br />
No matter, he shrugged. He snapped some loose jeans, didn&#39;t want to strange his new big little friend, heavy hiking boots, and a faded denim shirt into existence and covered himself with a worn old work jacket. Now he looked the part. Ty left his house, turned back from the sidewalk for a moment, shrugged, and began his new life.</p>
