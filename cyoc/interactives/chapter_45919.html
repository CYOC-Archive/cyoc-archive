<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Tome couldn't believe he had let this choice even enter his mind.  The idea of having sex as a woman was so bizarre to him that he'd never even played a female character during the course of PHUK, just in case.  He let Daniel be the one-off whenever he could… but Tome got so into his Role-Play sometimes that he worried that one night he'd just let things go to far and he'd never be the same again.</p>

<p>Tonight he would find out in no short order what the end of this would all be, because he was already undressed and within Gen's arms before he even knew what had happened.  He and Daniels' characters of Tracy and Misty were deep within the motions of the mating ritual when a larger commotion than had been there erupted outside.</p>

<p>Tracy and Misty's powerfully lean and muscular forms backed against Gen and Worg as the two set of twins continued their mating.  Their tails were to one side each as the men drove themselves in and out of their mates with a force only powerful by a Canis Sapien (Lycanis) male.  These dual twin souls were meant to be together, but just how true that was had not yet made itself known.</p>

<p>Tracy moaned with pleasure as Gen thrust against her from behind, her breasts going flat against the pillows that made up their bed.  Just opposite them were Worg and Misty holding the same positions.  The twins mirrored their actions in every regard, the women pushing against the men as the Rite continued.</p>

<p>Again their was a loud commotion outside, but the twins cared not.  The heat of the moment was building, the energy coursing along their fur and outward around the edges of the hut.  The moment of unity and perfection would have continued up until the last moment when an explosion rocked the earth.</p>

<p>The twins, still within their thrusting against each others, shared a moment.  Tracy looked into Misty's eyes as Gen looked into Worgs, and then the four mating Lycanis looked towards the opening of the hut.  There was a fire there, but their heat in the female's form continued.  As the mystical energies of the men flowed over the two of them, there was no stopping this mating.  Thus, even though there was a delay, they continued…</p>

<p>Just outside the hut, though, were the invaders.  Minotaurs and Centaurs had created an unstable alliance to finally bring down the Lycanis presence here in the desert landscapes just beyond the Flynwood Forest of the Ly's true home.  They were here to destroy them or run them off, but Misty and Tracy knew that not.</p>

<p>Because they had entered a storyline already in progress, they were unaware of the brewing war.</p>

<p>Even more unaware were they now as their mates' knots began to expand, ready to lock the each pair of male and female together.  But that awareness would come as a Minotaur warlock stepped within the flaps of the door into the hut, his height a massive twelve foot, but mostly hidden by his black robes.  He smiled at the group, tapping a hoof as if waiting for them to realize.</p>

<p>Tracy and Misty both saw him first, and Dnaiel called to Tome over teamspeak, "There's a Mino Lock interrupting the moment," he spoke, his breath somewhat missing while his character Misty was still within the act.  She thrust against Worg again just as Tracy did to Gen.</p>

<p>"Some privacy!… Invader!… Begone from… our hut!" Tracy called out a challenge to the Warlock.  He grinned, and snorted, and razed a black staff from out of dark energies beside him.  He pointed it's glowing red end at the four Lycanis and huffed.</p>

<p>"Ours is not for war, but for fear.  These are our lands and you have no place here," the Minotaur said.  "But as you are in an honored ritual, I had thought I would not kill you outright," he stomped a foot.  "But with your strong will, I must break that.  I will lessen your will to fight, and if not, then death shall be your only release!" he said, and motioned his staff in their direction, casting his spell.</p>

<p>To add further insult, however, Gen and Worg (presumably NPC's), were not distracted from their task at hand.  Though they noted the Minotaur, they did not see him as a threat.  They were the two strongest warriors of the tribe, and they would be with him when they were through.</p>

<p>When the Minotaur (Milotaurus) had said 'release!', Worg and Gen had each entered Tracy and Misty one last time, locking them together… and it was at that moment that they each lost themselves into the moment, unloading their semen (virtual or not) and mystical energies within the two woman being played by Tom and Dan.</p>

<p>The two woman, strong and powerful, felt their energies skyrocket… their bodies rocking against the men as they continued their thrusting.  The energies consumed them, and the two twins felt almost as single set.  Two complete forms in this hut collapsed near each other, their bodies limply moving together, their stamina drained.</p>

<p>It had been at that final moment, the moment of release, that Minotaurus' spell struck the four...</p></p>
