<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jess waited in the living room until she heard the scraping of pots and pans in the kitchen. James was cleaning up dishes after his meal. Her jumper no longer fit over her chest, so she had discarded it and was waiting to be able to flee the room in privacy.<br />
<br />
Unbolting the living room door, Jess padded as quickly as she could to the stairs and began climbing.<br />
<br />
Her heaving breasts bounced heavily, one at a time, as she ascended. It threw her off enough to have her grab the banister. As she ascended she called.<br />
<br />
&quot;James! When you have a second, pop upstairs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her heart was pounding. This was it. She was going to tell someone.<br />
<br />
Once in the bedroom Jess moved to the bed, slipping under the covers in a seated position. Blanket pulled up to cover her body, leaving only neck exposed.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
James dropped the pan he was washing. Jess had just called him to come up. What for he could only guess. Maybe she had found an electrical outlet or a phone charger or something.<br />
<br />
Shrugging he continued to scrub the pan until he was satisfied that it was clean. A quick towelling and he placed it back in the press he had found it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pfffff&quot; he exhaled. &quot;Better go see what Jess wants.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taking the steps two at a time he reached the top of the stairs in no time. Entering the bedroom he saw his sister snuggled up on the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;S&#39;up Jess?&quot; He queried. She looked nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;James, can you close the door please?&quot; Her voice was small, scared.<br />
<br />
He complied. Pushing the door closed.<br />
<br />
&quot;All the way. Lock it please.&quot; Jess insisted. James raised a questioning eyebrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;James...&quot; Jess repeated. More firmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, fine.&quot; James pulled the latch, locking the door. Maybe Jess had found something after all. Though what would warrant hiding from their parents he&#39;d never know. Unless.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jess, are you hiding booze under there?&quot;. Her face went crimson. She started sputtering. &quot;E-excuse me? What? How? You couldn&#39;t have seen?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess couldn&#39;t believe it. How had James seen her boobs? She had been so careful to hide them. All the curtains were closed, and there was no-one around when she left the room. <br />
<br />
James grinned. Jackpot. The firecracker had found some hard liquor. &quot;Well don&#39;t keep a guy in suspense! Show us what you have. I bet it&#39;s good stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess pulled the blanket up higher. What was James at? He actively wanted to see them? He seemed eager even. That was so messed up. &quot;James, why would I show them to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
James looked genuinely puzzled. He couldn&#39;t figure, why Jess would call him up here, to tell him she&#39;d found booze, then not show or share it. A more tactful approach maybe.<br />
<br />
Slowly, gingerly, James sat down on the end of his sister&#39;s bed, smiling and putting on his most comforting tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I want to see! Because, if you&#39;re willing to share, we can enjoy them together.&quot; He winked for good measure.<br />
<br />
Jess couldn&#39;t believe it. Her brother was sitting there, at the end of her bed, coming on to her. The was disgusted, and, if she was honest, a little bit flattered. <br />
<br />
All Jess&#39;s life she was a washboard, tiny girl. Always overlooked. Always alone. Never having gone on a date. Never having kissed anyone. Now here was someone, actively wanting to see her. Only this was so wrong. It was her brother, and her only wanted to see her because she&#39;d grown boobs.<br />
<br />
&quot;J-james. This is wrong&quot; She whispered.<br />
<br />
James smiled, warmly, it made her melt a little. He leaned in, whispering back. &quot;I know it&#39;s wrong, and we could get into trouble, especially with Mom and Dad. But isn&#39;t it worth it for some fun?&quot;.<br />
<br />
She couldn&#39;t... Not with James. This was not at all how it was supposed to go.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Melissa, James?&quot; She pressed. The back of her brain was screaming at her *JUST TELL HIM TO FUCK OFF! THIS IS WRONG*, but she didn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
James raised another eyebrow. &quot;What about Melissa?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if she found out?&quot;, Jess&#39;s mind was still screaming. Why was she using this language, nothing definitive, all leading questions?<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would she find out? Besides, she&#39;d be fine with it. She does it all the time too.&quot; James, had gone drinking with Melissa a few times, usually ended up with a lot of fumbling. James smiled at the memories.<br />
<br />
Jess&#39;s world was being flipped. Melissa was into this? With her brother? Her voice was tiny. &quot;w-with Steve?&quot;<br />
<br />
James scoffed. &quot;Of course with Steve!&quot; Steve, Melissa&#39;s buddy, was good buds with James, they hung around all the time and joined them drinking plenty times. James was beginning to get impatient now. &quot;C&#39;mon Jess, we doing this or what??&quot; He tugged at the blanket a bit.<br />
<br />
Jess *eeped* and held firm. &quot;Wait wait!&quot; she called. James stopped. She looked him dead in the eye. He smiled and winked at her.<br />
<br />
She couldn&#39;t, could she?<br />
<br />
&quot;You really want to? Now?&quot; She asked, one last time.<br />
<br />
He nodded enthusiastically. &quot;Now, tonight, tomorrow, as long as were alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her lip trembled with excitement and fear. She had never thought of James like this. Objectively he was very handsome, well put together. Out of her league for sure, were they just strangers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. But close your eyes first.&quot; She insisted.<br />
<br />
James smiled, he had it. &quot;No problem! Love this bit!&quot;. He swivelled on the bed, facing out, eyes screwed shut with his hands on his lap, palms up, cupped, expecting a bottle to be placed in it.<br />
<br />
Jess looked at her brother, sitting there so eager. God if she&#39;d known this sooner, maybe? No. Surely she wouldn&#39;t have. But. This place. Something...<br />
<br />
She gently peeled back the covers. Exposing her pink bags to the air. Nipples hardening. <br />
<br />
God, he had his hands out. He wanted to feel them obviously. <br />
<br />
Fuck it. If this was happening she might as well oblige. Just no finishing. An udder was the last thing she wanted. <br />
<br />
James could hear his sister step from the bed, around in front of him. He could feel the heat of her not a foot away. He was excited. Maybe it was Tequila, his favourite. Though with how this place was decked out it was probably Bourbon or Cognac.<br />
<br />
The heat from Jess began to grow, and James swore her breathing was getting louder. Louder? Or closer? Just as he was going to ask her what she was doing, he felt something graze his fingertips. Eager to receive, he moved his hands up, cupping to grab the expected bottle.<br />
<br />
What he felt and heard was not what he expected. The object was not hard, cold and cylindrical, but warm, squishy, pillowy. As his hands groped her heard his sister moan, breathlessly.<br />
<br />
*Oh. James*<br />
<br />
She barely two inches from his face. His eyes shot open, to see his sister, freckled face flushed almost as crimson as her hair, lips slightly parted and eyes half lidded, closing the distance. For a kiss...</p>
