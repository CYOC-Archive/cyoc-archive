<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The ride from the Park Theater was usually short, half an hour in time before unloaded onto the wharf dock and there loaded aboard the ferryboat, for another form of transport to the mainland. Four new mares and one bachelor stallion pony had time enough to gain carnal knowledge of their sensually different bodies.<br />
<br />
During the ride from the theater backdoor loading dock to the wharf, was a busy fun frolicking time for all going on the ride. Mental and sexual debauchery raged as did the erect cock on the man who never planned upon leaving the island Park in the physical form of an equine. He was as apprehensive about what Madame Illusia did to him on stage, she rearranging his genitals to looking exactly like the Welsh pony stallion she ultimately made of him.<br />
<br />
Promises are like pie crusts as both were as meant to be broken. Madame used her devilish powers to change people into animals for her show, and then sold them to the Park for slave labor, or had them sent to the mainland where they went to auction. The four girls turned into mares were on their way to unknown ownerships by different owners, but the stallion fellow, he gained a whole new sense of male lifestyle he had long ago forgot ever existed. Their wild fun ceased during the boat trip, as there each found their self as chained inside a small horse stall, leaving them to whinny, snort and stomp anxious hoofs at the wooden deck.<br />
<br />
The Welsh Mountain breed stallion had then two hours of lone time to think, as he considered what had happened to him on that fateful day. He thought back to his going to a theater for what was as advertised a showing of erotic magic had intrigued him to see for himself.<br />
He having entered the theater before the show began found a seat just four rows back from the stage. He remembered his sense of awe when four young and pretty women let the magician woman then cause their bodily selves to be changed, transforming, becoming as two Shire mares and two Quarter horse mares. He would have smiled if his pony lips allowed him, as he recalled the anxious new mares stood there on stage and urinated in front of a wickedly erotic seeking crowd.<br />
<br />
He was as anxious for those the magician transformed, and stood up, yelling that he wanted a piece of this action, as he exited the seating row and stepped up on the stage with wicked plans of buying the young mares. He became as surprised when the magician did quickly agree to sell him the four mares, as their being sold seemed to bother the mares worse than their physically being transformed into animals.<br />
<br />
He recalled having taken out his checkbook to write Madame Illusia a payment for all four pretty and properly conformation formed horses. He thought of when Madame showed him her evil eyed look, and with a wave of her hands, his body then changed. <br />
<br />
Oh how he felt scared at first. He so suddenly stood there then wholly naked. She, Madame had caused his body to change; he covered suddenly with the black fur of his pony self. He recalled his anxious gaze as he looked down at what on him felt aroused for the first time in many years. The wonder and sexual fantasy feeling Madame wrought for him. There before an excited audience, he who came on stage as a bold and greedy man, stood before all watching saw him become naked, furry, his Caucasian skin turned into thick, black, equine pony hide and he covered with a pelt of pony fur from head to toes.<br />
<br />
So suddenly, he became for Madame as another of her pets did. His transformed self-tended to arouse of him what for a decade of time not felt any reason to become stiff. Nervous, and feeling humiliated in front of a wildly erotic fun loving audience, he shivering, shook his long grown Pony-mane, causing his torso to shiver, making his stout pony sized penis to swaying. His nervousness coupled with how he became partially an equine, forcing him to snorting out his then wide nostrils, as feeling his nose and lips merging to form a muzzle and learn then how to graze, rather than to plant a kiss.<br />
<br />
Bending his short but broad neck to look and take inventory downward, he recalled of an old human torso was then looking young and strong. Yet covered in the black hide and hair of the animal he was mostly akin to, he realized that Madame rejuvenated his body to being similar to how he was when turning twenty-one.<br />
<br />
Anna, Betty, Joan, and Sarah being as then mares acted as would mares in estrus when near to a virile stallion, as they wanted to sniff at his erect cock.<br />
<br />
How fortunate for all there on stage that Madame signaled then the close of her act, and the stage curtain fell to separate the erotic audience from they who felt as doomed. He remembered well of how he thought it odd that those girls changed into mares seemed to accept their plights with uncommon ease. Although he became excited and not all elated about how Madame had changed him as well.<br />
He wondered, asking himself in many ways as why he went up on stage. He pondered whether his reasons for going up on stage was to save the girls from a possible doomed life of being animals; or was he greedy for seeing excellent horseflesh and wishing to gain a profit.</p>
