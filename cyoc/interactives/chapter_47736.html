<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I want to come with you&quot; Amy said wondering how hung Othello was again. She shook her head to try and clear the thoughts from it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay I'm going to open a portal&quot; Othello said evidently not seeing her shake her head. &quot;It will remain open a few seconds after I step through. You'll have to step through within that time. Do you understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do&quot; she said thinking about marriage instead of what he just said. She shook her head again tying to banish those thoughts but she was unsuccessful. &quot;Why am I having these thoughts?&quot; she asked not expecting an answer.<br />
<br />
Othello chuckled and said &quot;I'll leave that explanation to Moderator Raven. I'm opening the portal now.&quot; He raised his left hand and muttered a few words in a strange language. A shimmering portal grew from a tiny point to one tall and wide enough to allow him to go through. It was oval shaped and it looked like blue water with little ripples in it. When he stepped through it there were ripples across the surface like he was stepping through water.<br />
<br />
Remembering what Othello said Amy quickly ran and stepped through the portal. It was like walking through a sheet of water. She had expected to feel and see being whisked along a tunnel. Instead it was no more than stepping through a door from one room to another through a beaded curtain. She looked around at the immense room. The walls displayed different parts of the kingdom that constantly changed. She could see thousands of work stations with different races at them. Any race that could be imagined was represented from fantasy to science fiction to real world. Othello was heading to a section of work stations that seemed to be forest themed. &quot;When do you go on break?&quot; she asked catching up to him.<br />
<br />
Othello chuckled and said &quot;My own preference is for female centaurs for those types of activities.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy looked shocked and stopped for a second. When she was moving again she said &quot;I didn't mean like that&quot; in a low tone. &quot;I meant just to hang out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Othello chuckled again and said &quot;I saw how you looked at me. Just hanging out isn't the only thing on your mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy looked down and said nothing knowing he was right. She wanted him in her so badly that she could almost taste it. She had to become male again or she would go crazy. She was so preoccupied in her thoughts that she ran into one of the workstations. It looked and felt like tree branches that had been cut off and tied together with vines. &quot;Careful there&quot; a woman said. She looked to be about thirty with long blond hair in a Laura Croft style braid draped over her right shoulder. She had ice blue eyes and a very nice smile. She was wearing a plain white dress with white sandals. She had a silver necklace with a small light blue gem on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Tristy Chatchem&quot; Othello said to the woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just had to bring her here didn't you Oth&quot; the woman said.<br />
<br />
&quot;She is a special case&quot; Othello said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know&quot; the woman said. Looking at Amy she said &quot;I'm Raven Winterflake but don't go spreading that around.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot; Amy asked looking confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because when I'm not doing my Moderator duties I'm a fairy&quot; Raven said. &quot;If someone knows a fairy's name they can control that fairy. It's even dangerous to tell another fairy your name so most will give you either a name they made up or just their first name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh&quot; Amy said understanding. She glanced at Othello and said &quot;Othello said ou'd explain why I'm having certain thoughts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Raven nodded and said &quot;It's because you've been in that body for four years and you're mind has molded itself to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it's only been a couple of hours for me&quot; Amy said confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;It has been four years though&quot; Raven said. &quot;You see about an hour after the second hack that pulled us into the kingdom it was taken offline. This had the effect of freezing almost everything. A few of us remained remained conscious and able to move about but it tended to get boring most of the time. Anyway even though you weren't conscious of the time passing your mind still was. It had plenty of time to get use to the body you have now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I get out of the kingdom or at least can I become a human male?&quot; Amy asked with a hopeful look on her face.<br />
<br />
Raven had been typing on the screens in front of her as the conversation moved along. Now she looked up and said &quot;I wouldn't recommend it for you right now. In fact I recommend that you return to fairy size.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would I do that?&quot; Amy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you're still pregnant&quot; Raven said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't be though&quot; Amy said in denial. &quot;My stomach is flat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's because your child wasn't changed with you&quot; Rave explained. &quot;They child is still in your room like with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're pregnant!&quot; Amy exclaimed. &quot;But your stomach is flat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;While I change my form my baby doesn't&quot; Raven said. &quot;I don't look pregnant but I am the same as you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I didn't lose it or snuff it out?&quot; Amy asked shocked. She moved her hand down to her belly and tried to feel if there was life there.<br />
<br />
Raven smiled and said &quot;Of course you didn't. I'm a Moderator and I wouldn't lie about something like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How soon till I give birth?&quot; Amy asked her voice sounding far off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Soon&quot; Raven said. &quot;In fact we should be giving birth at the same time. Come to my village with me. It's in a low level zone. After we give birth you can make a choice. You could stay female and raise your child, you could become a male fairy and be my mate, or you could become human or whatever you want of any sex you want. It will be your choice. If you choose anything besides raising your child as it's mother I'll be happy to be it's mother. Here's something that may make your choice easier, it's highly likely that the Sensual Touch will be passed on eliminating it from you if you give birth. What will it be? Will you come with me and give birth or do you want to go ahead and change your sex now?&quot;</p>
