<br />
Alice Decrux was beside herself as she drove, stuck in normal clothes and form instead of her were-raccoon fursona.<br />
Not knowing what actually happened, Decrux was happy under the belief that her revenge against Harold Jenkins and Virginia McCoy was complete now that his daughter Melissa was now or about to become a were against her will. Perhaps even at Harold&#39;s own paws! She had hoped Melissa would be changed into a were-raccoon as a constant reminder to Harold of her victory and the fact that he never should have scorned her, but as long as his daughter was now something other than whatever it was she might have wanted to become upon joining were society, Decrux was happy.<br />
On the other hand, the horny cougarish MILF wasn&#39;t happy that she had to leave the four raccoon boys she had tricked into doing her dirty work for her by getting Melissa to drink the tainted punch.<br />
When they told her what happened* and that all were eligible for the reward of promised hot sex, Decrux felt her nether regions grow moist at the thought of taking on four males at once.<br />
Yet if they <i>were</i> successful, then the long arm of the law would soon be upon her for violating Statute 1A** again, which was something Decrux wanted to avoid at all costs!<br />
<i>But there will be plenty of nice hard cocks for me to fuck once I cross the border into Canada and hide among equally horny friends,</i> she thought, shifting positions in the driver&#39;s seat in hopes of bringing her legs together to hold off the building tension in her vagina.<br />
However, all thoughts of sex fled her mind as Alice Decrux spotted the bright lights of a police cruiser now flashing as an officer in the car yelled over its public address system to pull over.<br />
<i><b>OH SHIT!</b></i> was the only thought on Decrux&#39;s mind now as her foot pressed down hard on the accelerator.<br />
<br />
ELSEWHERE...<br />
&quot;So, that&#39;s the story,&quot; Principal Ian Andrews told the weretigers before him in the Moon Lake High School gym. Despite it being Halloween night, he was one of the few people present still in their human form instead of their fursona. &quot;Our security cameras show that Alice Decrux <i>did</i> spike the punch with something before the dance started, although until the test results come back, we don&#39;t officially know for sure it was her <i>Love Potion #9</i> aphrodisiac. However, the police are trying to track her down now, at least for questioning if nothing else. But one thing I would like to know is how did you two know to keep anyone away from that punch bowl?&quot;<br />
&quot;Considering our past interactions with Decrux, we suspected she might try something against Melissa tonight,&quot; said Virginia McCoy, while turning to look at her fiance.<br />
&quot;Besides, our daughter also has... premonitions,&quot; admitted Harold Jenkins, while holding the weretigress&#39; paw, still not consciously aware of his slip of pronouns. &quot;She gets it naturally from her biological mother, who always just chalked hers off to <i>woman&#39;s intuition</i>. But for whatever reason, Mel&#39;s seem to be stronger, especially since we moved to Moon Lake. She warned us Decrux <i>did</i> in fact spike the punch, although we weren&#39;t sure of with what ourselves.&quot;*<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; said Andrews. &quot;Well, a lot of <i>interesting</i> stuff happens around here. Fellow weres will understand, but publicly and in court, I&#39;d stick with Miss McCoy&#39;s explanation,&quot; he suggested.<br />
&quot;We will, but it&#39;s soon to be Mrs. Jenkins,&quot; said Virginia proudly.<br />
&quot;Really? Congratulations!&quot; said the Principal. &quot;When?&quot;<br />
&quot;As soon as I can obtain a marriage license and arrange an appearance before a Justice of the Peace. Probably next Saturday at the earliest,&quot; replied Harold.<br />
&quot;And you&#39;re invited,&quot; hastily added Virginia.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be there,&quot; promised Andrews, &quot;and since the police cleared you of any suspicion of violating Statute 1A**, both the School District and I will be expecting you at your post bright and early Monday morning.&quot;<br />
&quot;I will definitely be there!&quot; promised Virginia, as a smile crossed her furry muzzle.<br />
&quot;By the way, where is your daughter right now? The police will want a statement from her as well as you two in time,&quot; the Principal reminded them.<br />
&quot;Right now?&quot; said Harold, looking at his future bride. &quot;Right now Melissa is probably making a few dreams of her own come true.&quot;<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Melissa Jenkins walked hand in hand with her boyfriend Trevor Tyson back toward his pickup truck.<br />
By the time they reached it, the newest werecow of Moon Lake was getting the hang of walking on hoof-like feet, even as a smile stayed on her face at the thought of not only declaring her love for the werebull beside her, but giving him her virginity and joining were society in the process.*<br />
As they reached the front of the pickup, they reluctantly let go of each others&#39; hand to start gathering the pieces of their respective Halloween costumes, discarded where they disrobed before Trevor led the once human Mel off into the fields and made love to her under the stars.<br />
Yet, as Trevor finished picking up the last of his outfit, he noticed that the lady of his heart had barely moved.<br />
&quot;Is everything all right?&quot; he carefully asked her, for Mel was just standing by the passenger door and staring at her reflection in the large side mirror.<br />
When there was no answer, Trevor came closer and asked his question again.<br />
&quot;What? Oh. Sorry,&quot; Mel said, as she bent down and picked up the rest of her costume. &quot;It&#39;s just that I never got the full effect of what I look like now until...&quot; and then she turned and stared at her new bovine appearance in the mirror once more.<br />
Placing his costume in the passenger side of the truck cab through the open window, Trevor put a loving arm around Mel as he leaned closer to her. He had been gentle, kind, and tried to make the night everything she wanted it to be, despite the fact that being exposed to Decrux&#39;s <i>Love Potion #9</i> sped everything up to basically being spur of the moment decisions on Mel&#39;s part.<br />
&quot;They make a cute couple, don&#39;t they?&quot; Mel asked, leaning her head against him as she continued to stare at the mirror.<br />
&quot;Who?&quot; Trevor asked, a bit confused.<br />
&quot;Us, silly,&quot; she replied, before pointing at the mirror.<br />
He stared at the image for a moment before realizing she was right. A werebull and his cow. Or a werecow and <i>her</i> bull. Either way you looked at it...<br />
This was right. His heart said so, and obviously so did hers.<br />
<br />
&quot;No premonitions or visits from your mirror friend?&quot; he wondered.<br />
&quot;No. Haven&#39;t heard from her since this afternoon in your attic,&quot; answered Mel, before copying his actions and putting her costume through the open passenger window.<br />
&quot;I have all these new thoughts and feelings running through my mind right now,&quot; revealed Mel, before spreading her arms and twirling around, her new tail swishing in the slight breeze as she spun.<br />
&quot;What it&#39;s like to be a were, let alone a werecow. But most importantly, yours!&quot; said Mel happily, before she topped twirling and rushed into Trevor&#39;s arms to kiss him.<br />
Cow and bull locked arms around each other as their lips met.<br />
Even the sensation of their horns briefly rubbing against each other was exciting.<br />
Then when their lips parted, Mel smiled at her man once more, and Trevor&#39;s heart beat faster at the thought of she being the one he loved and wanting to spend the rest of his life with.<br />
Then her smile grew a bit more mischievous as she suddenly spun Trevor around and pushed him.<br />
Caught off guard, Trevor stumbled and landed on his back and rump in the front yawn surrounding the main house of Tyson Farm.<br />
But he didn&#39;t get a chance to stand again, for Mel was suddenly upon him, kissing him once more even as she reached down toward his rapidly engorging bull/manhood.<br />
&quot;Mel?&quot; Trevor asked. <i>She couldn&#39;t be—</i><br />
&quot;Sssh darling,&quot; cooed Mel, even as she moved to insert him within her. &quot;I&#39;m just claiming my man, now and forever!&quot; as she began to ride him.<br />
<br />
UPSTAIRS...<br />
Jacob Tyson awoke with a start.<br />
Farming instincts told the werebull something was wrong, but he wasn&#39;t sure what.<br />
He was about to reach down for the shotgun with the safety lock on its trigger that he kept under the bed when he realized what it was.<br />
Someone was rummaging inside the walk-in closet of the master bedroom.<br />
As he started to get up, Jacob quickly saw that the alleged intruder was actually his wife.<br />
&quot;Honey? Is everything all right?&quot; he said, wondering what she was up to so late at night.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been up for a while now because I couldn&#39;t sleep,&quot; replied Irma, his werecow wife.<br />
&quot;So you decided to rearrange the closet?&quot; he asked in disbelief, staring at her. Irma looked as lovely now as the day they married, if not more so, but weird moments like this left him wondering sometimes whether or not he should have remained single.<br />
&quot;No. I was sitting by the window stargazing earlier and saw them.&quot;<br />
&quot;Saw who? Wait. Did Trevor and his date ever come home? Are he and Melissa all right?&quot;<br />
&quot;Everything&#39;s wonderful,&quot; she replied with a smile on her face. &quot;I&#39;m just trying to find some clothing that will fit our future daughter-in-law.&quot;<br />
&quot;Our—&quot; Jacob Tyson started to say, but was interrupted by the noise of someone joyously mooing outside.<br />
Irma Tyson just smiled, kissed her husband on the cheek, and then the werecow went back inside the closet to look for more potential clothing for Melissa.<br />
