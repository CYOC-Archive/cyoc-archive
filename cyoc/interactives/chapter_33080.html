<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie was surprised, but not really stunned by the panther morph's request. And figured <br />
that many other female anthros might be asking the same thing soon enough. Including <br />
the stupid impulsive ones who wouldn't think about what would happen after those nine <br />
months were up. Katie wondered what would happen in those nine months. Logically <br />
speaking, such off spring would be legally USA citizens, no questions asked. But the real <br />
fact would be that the cubs that would be born, while humanoid, wouldn't have a human <br />
template to be transformed to. Transformation Park USA had never made one to Katie's <br />
knowledge, only used the information of the person -before- they were changed to make <br />
them human again when their stay was over. <br />
<br />
It often creeped Katie that the only thing between her and a lifetime stuck with a tail and <br />
fur was a major hard drive crash. Heck, that was the only thing between everyone <br />
transformed and such a life. Katie couldn't understand why anyone would want to spend a <br />
lifetime like this. Being human was hard enough. Of course the Management promised <br />
that there was a back up archive of everyone's human template in case of a fatal system <br />
failure, but Katie often worried about what the Management -wasn't- telling their <br />
employees and customers. <br />
<br />
&quot;wake up dear.&quot; Keith heard the voice of an angel and woke up with one looking down at <br />
him. Keith couldn't say he wasn't enjoying every second of this, but he did wish that there <br />
was a way to gauge their 'progress.' <br />
<br />
&quot;One of the huskies showed up and offered us a pregnancy test.&quot; Speak of the devil. <br />
<br />
Keith sat up, &quot;Well that's good news.&quot; Dang he felt sore in some places. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Said apparently said husky. She was a looker, but like any different species, Keith <br />
found he couldn't find himself attracted to her. &quot;In that case, no time like the present. <br />
Sooner done, the sooner taken care of.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right now?&quot; Keith asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not like you have other engagements right?&quot; The husky laughed. &quot;I'm Katie by the <br />
way.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jackie couldn't stop herself. &quot;Strange name for a dog.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wasn't born one.&quot; <br />
<br />
True, the anthros as a whole, made up their own events, keeping themselves entertained, <br />
they knew as humans they'd be bored with such a life, but being hyper evolved animals at <br />
the moment, their threshold of boredom had been greatly increased. It was almost if, even <br />
sublimely, the change got ride of, at least PART of that very human aspect 'beyond <br />
survival.' It was still there, but not as influential.<br />
<br />
Keith stretched, &quot;Okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie didn't bother to try and ask Keith to stay, knowing how that wouldn't go anywhere. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please follow me please.&quot; Katie led the couple.<br />
<br />
&quot;We aren't going to use... whatever it is you people use to get from here to there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope. We do have to have some secret.&quot; Katie said keeping up a cheerful face for the sake <br />
of the two park guests. She knew better than to bellyache to the two of them. &quot;We've also <br />
offered free examinations for your, mate, sir, since there might be unknown dangers to <br />
the pregnancy if one occurs. <br />
It's not like any of your species has ever been pregnant before.&quot; Indeed, Keith and Jackie's <br />
species hadn't existed a few years ago. <br />
<br />
Katie sold it well, as it was her job to. Besides, she honestly considered Murphy's Law in <br />
full effect here, and the more precautions were taken with these pregnancy as they were <br />
now beginning to occur, the better for everyone. <br />
<br />
&quot;By the way, we need to make a stop along the way.&quot; Katie said, &quot;We have to pick up your <br />
fellow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My what?&quot; Jackie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our confirmed, X chromosome added with child anthro woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh right. Leticia. Who was now rivaling Beauty Queen Hannah as the most popular doe in <br />
the park. Jackie found it incredible. Wondering how the most girly girls in the park were <br />
turning out to be former males, and the most manly men were former females. Jackie <br />
didn't know what to make of it. Katie just figured fate had a really weird sense of humor. <br />
<br />
The authority that Katie represented enabled her and her wards to path though the buck <br />
unchallenged. They found Jeremy and Leticia together near what had been used as the <br />
arena, though Leticia hadn't sat in her 'throne' since then. Though it might be particle for <br />
her to do so once she reached a certain stage.<br />
<br />
Leticia had greatly calmed down from her first shock, and the interviews with the news <br />
hounds had proven to actually help, talking about it calmed her down. Jeremy of course <br />
helped greatly too. <br />
<br />
While she had no obligation or need to, Katie put on an air of respect when address the <br />
herd leader and his female. While they were here in the park only at the grace of the <br />
Management, they had effectively calmed the problem with the bucks, so Katie felt they <br />
had earned it. <br />
<br />
&quot;So for the sake of your fawn, we're wondering if you'd let us examine you for any signs of <br />
possible complications.&quot;<br />
<br />
Leticia looked concerned, &quot;complications?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry, we just don't know the first thing about an anthro deer being pregnant, so <br />
it's best to learn what we can to help you later on. The panthers here want to see if they've <br />
managed to grow anything from their labors and will be with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
While having the panthers there made them unease actually, the deer logically agreed to <br />
the Management's request voiced through Katie. <br />
<br />
Like seeing their king and queen off, the herd looked on and stood at attention as Katie <br />
now led the two pairs to the entrance, she could have lead them though the husky's way of <br />
getting around at any time she wanted, but the park preferred she not reveal how that <br />
secret worked. <br />
<br />
The disguised building opened up, and Katie lead them in, it wasn't into one of the TF <br />
rooms the anthros found. Two more huskies were waiting for them. The room itself felt <br />
strange to the anthro now, enclosing, unnatural, alien, not alive like the park itself. <br />
<br />
Lead through a door without a handle or knob that slid open on it's own, apparently by <br />
remote, the anthros were stunned by the strange creatures waiting for them. They were <br />
furless except for their heads, their faces were squashed flat, and their ears were on the <br />
sides of their heads, not to mention the odd extra layers of skin over them, they couldn't <br />
even tell if they were male or female. <br />
<br />
Katie looked at their eyes as they remembered with a thunderclap what a human being <br />
looked like, she had heard of it before, but had never seen it. It was interesting to see. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello.&quot; Said the first man in the white coat, his square glasses up against his nose. &quot;I am <br />
Dr. Number One. And this is Dr. Number Two. Please don't ask, I know it sounds stupid, it <br />
was in my contract. I'll tell you my real name if you bother to ask because the huskies <br />
never report it anyway.&quot; <br />
<br />
The four anthros just nodded.</p>
