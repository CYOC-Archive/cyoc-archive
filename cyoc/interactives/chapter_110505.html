<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was no denying that Melissa Stovall and her daughter Julie were enjoying their respective moments.<br />
Both women were on top of the man they loved more than life itself, feeling their mate&#39;s hard were-merman cocks dive deep into their were-mermaid vaginas.<br />
Melissa and her husband Martin were in their Stage 3 forms at the deep end of the Stovall family&#39;s fresh water swimming pool, with full tails on display as she had her body pressed against his, her arms wrapped lovingly around him as the hard nipples of her bountiful bosom pressed against his chest. The fact that his wife continued to passionately kiss him while urging both of them on to new heights of ecstasy wasn&#39;t lost on Martin, who had a hold of Melissa&#39;s shapely hips and was doing his very best to satisfy her.<br />
<br />
Julie and her fiance Eric Anderson were only in their Stage 2 forms, their legs still scaly but separate, for hers were wrapped tightly around him as the young couple continued to thrust against each other.<br />
Otherwise, they were as deeply embraced and lost in the moment as her parents.<br />
Nothing else mattered except the mutual pleasure they were giving and receiving from each other.<br />
While who reached it first would remain an unanswered question, there was no denying that both couples more than achieved their goals, as the women laid their heads upon their men&#39;s chest in a tender after moment.<br />
How long they just laid in the bottom of the pool, silently cherishing their mate&#39;s presence that late Indian Summer afternoon went untimed, but eventually everyone realized that life went on and that they had to proceed with theirs.<br />
As if by mutual agreement, Melissa and Julie gave their men one last romantic kiss, and then left them to swim to the ladder at the edge of the deep end to leave the pool.<br />
Martin and Eric just laid on their backs at the bottom of the pool with smiles on their faces.<br />
Then Martin decided to sit up and have &quot;the&quot; chat he needed to hold with Julie&#39;s beau.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; began Martin, looking at Eric.<br />
&quot;Julie can be <i>very</i> persuasive,&quot; said Eric, failing to keep from blushing before his future father-in-law.<br />
&quot;She gets it from her mother, so I know what you mean,&quot; Martin replied, thinking about how much Melissa had changed since they got married and she became a were-mermaid, and not just physically. &quot;Blue green, huh?&quot;<br />
&quot;What? Oh, yes. Surprised both Julie and me when I first changed,&quot; answered Eric, looking at the fish-like scales of his legs. &quot;But we love each other and she&#39;s happy.&quot;<br />
&quot;Both very important things to have in any relationship. The necklace my daughter&#39;s wearing now...&quot; began Martin.<br />
&quot;My mom first made it for me to give Julie as a token of friendship, love, promise, and whatever else it was supposed to represent; but for some reason I kept forgetting it until after that magic moment last Friday here in your pool when... well, that is...&quot;<br />
&quot;When the two of you declared and consummated your love for the first time, and you willingly joined were-mer society,&quot; said Martin, finishing Eric&#39;s statement for him. &quot;Dig you give her the single pearl necklace <i>before</i> you knew its significance?&quot;<br />
&quot;No sir,&quot; swore Eric. &quot;Even before I became a were-merman, I knew in my heart that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with Julie out of and in the water, which is why I proposed and she accepted, because Julie feels the same way about me as I do her.&quot;<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; was all Martin said. <i>Melissa&#39;s right. Eric and Julie are like us, but in reverse, and without the 10 year gap it took her brain to realize what her heart was feeling was true.</i> &quot;I guess at this point I should ask what your intentions and plans are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Honorable,&quot; Eric answered instantly, still sitting across from him. &quot;According to our dreams—&quot;<br />
&quot;Dreams?&quot; asked Martin, wanting to hear Eric&#39;s version and compare it to what his wife told him.<br />
&quot;Julie called them prophecy dreams. Something a lot of weres allegedly have when facing a major decision that will seriously impact their future. All I know is that we each had them separately <i>before</i> I joined were society and together since then. Anyway, we marry after high school graduation, and don&#39;t have our first child until sometime after we&#39;ve established ourselves professionally post college graduation, but our extended family will have at least two children. A boy, Eric Anderson Junior and a girl that Julie names Melinda.&quot;<br />
&quot;At least two?&quot; repeated Martin, eyeing Eric closely. <i>He had prophecy dreams</i> before <i> becoming a were-mer?</i><br />
&quot;Well, those are the two we know of. We haven&#39;t seen much of our future beyond that, although our kids will be a couple of years apart age wise, and that the last dream we had showed them both elementary school age gathered around a pool for a cookout with both our families together,&quot; explained Eric.<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; said Martin, &quot;and your respective job prospects?&quot;<br />
&quot;I was some kind of a scientist for Tachibana Enterprises and Julie was doing something pro-oceans, but our work schedules were flexible enough so at least one of us was always home when the kids weren&#39;t in school.&quot;<br />
<i>That definitely sounds like something Tachibana would arrange, provided both of them were working for her,</i> thought Martin, knowing the leader of the Skulk. &quot;Well, it sounds like the two of you have everything worked out.&quot;<br />
&quot;Not quite,&quot; revealed Eric. &quot;There&#39;s one thing that I never got the opportunity to do, given the surrounding circumstances at the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? What&#39;s that?&quot; wondered Martin.<br />
&quot;Since I didn&#39;t know at the time that last Friday would hold the magical moment Julie escorted me into were-mer society, and you were away to check on your mother, I haven&#39;t had the opportunity to formally ask you for Julie&#39;s hand and permission to marry me Mister Stovall.&quot;<br />
Martin Stovall just stared at the young man sitting on the bottom of the pool before him and smiled. If they weren&#39;t in the water, he wondered if Eric would notice the tear of joy he shed at hearing that.<br />
While some would call it old fashioned, Martin was gentlemanly enough to seek out the father&#39;s permission of whoever he wound up marrying in life, like his grandfather did with his bride to be, and every Stovall did before him.<br />
However life had other ideas and he was never able to do this with Melissa&#39;s parents, so for Eric to ask him now for permission to wed his only daughter...<br />
<br />
&quot;You have my permission, son,&quot; said Martin proudly.<br />
&quot;Thank you Mister Stovall, and don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll make Julie the happiest were-mermaid on this world,&quot; swore Eric.<br />
&quot;I know you will, but I think that, at least when we&#39;re alone, you can call me Martin.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure. Now, if you don&#39;t mind, there is one other question I need to ask you,&quot; said Eric.<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot;<br />
&quot;How do you cope with the longing?&quot;<br />
&quot;Longing?&quot;<br />
With that, Eric explained the great emptiness (for lack of a better term) that both he and Julie felt being apart from each other during school that day.<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; began Martin, as he swam over to where Eric was sitting and leaned back against the side of the pool to be more comfortable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are they?&quot; Melissa Stovall asked her daughter.<br />
The two women, after they had left the pool, went into the house, dried off, got dressed, and had a heart to heart mother/daughter chat with each other in the kitchen over a snack while waiting for their men to come in.<br />
But that had been over an hour ago, and there was still no sign of either Eric or Martin.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll go see,&quot; said Julie, as she walked barefooted outside to the backyard.<br />
A couple of moments later, she came back in and said, &quot;Would you believe that they&#39;re sitting on the bottom of the pool together, in their mer forms, talking?&quot;<br />
&quot;Still?&quot; asked Melissa in disbelief. &quot;How did your father and Eric look?&quot;<br />
&quot;Happy,&quot; said Julie with a smile, feeling great that her fiance and her father were getting along.<br />
&quot;Then they&#39;re bonding,&quot; realized Melissa. &quot;You certainly found a wonderful man in Eric,&quot; she told Julie, while hugging her. &quot;We can give them some more time. After all, it isn&#39;t quite dinner time yet and they&#39;ll get hungry eventually,&quot; said her mother, before the ladies sat down at the kitchen table and resumed their own conversation.<br />
