<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><i>I wish that brothers could marry their sisters if their parents gave permission. I wish this were a very rare occurrence, like less than one in a thousand marriages, yet people take it for granted, as long as the married siblings follow the rules. And I wish Colleen and I were getting married tonight.</i><br />
<br />
"I thought this would look nice on the honeymoon," Colleen said, preening a little in her modest but sexy dress. "I wanted something I could wear to a nice restaurant, but that you'd want to tear off with your teeth when we get back to the hotel. You know Mom and Dad bought us tickets to Hawaii, right?"<br />
<br />
"No, I didn't," I said. "Hawaii, huh?"<br />
<br />
"Seven days, six nights, at a secluded resort on the Kona coast. All the finest scenery, sunniest weather, and best exotic cuisine. They gave me one of their credit cards, too, so we should do all right."<br />
<br />
"I suppose so," I said. I was dumbfounded. The wish ring had given me my wish, but it had gone further than I expected. I wasn't just marrying my sister; I was starting a new life in style. I started to wish we could consummate the marriage right now, but decided to wait until tonight, when the pastor would conduct the service in the city park.<br />
<br />
Wow, the ring even filled in that detail so seamlessly that I didn't even notice the memory until it appeared in my head, fully formed.<br />
<br />
Colleen must have noticed me staring. Maybe I had my mouth open or something. Whatever it was, Colleen suddenly made eye contact, and slid her hands down her sides, cupping her own hips seductively. "Do you like what you see, little brother?"<br />
<br />
"I do," I said.<br />
<br />
"Don't get ahead of yourself," Colleen said, wagging a finger at me in a mock warning. "There will be plenty of time to say that this evening!"<br />
<br />
My body trembled all over. My sister is such a sexy tease.<br />
<br />
I watched Colleen smooth the fabric of her new dress along her stomach. She has such a great figure. I want my sister to be my wife, but I want us to be a respectable couple, too. But then, I thought, I don't want to change her too much. Sibling rivalry has long been the most exciting part of our relationship, long before there I had any sexual awareness of her. Indeed, back when she had a flat, boyish chest and I didn't know what sex even was, our rivalry spurred each of us to do better in school, play harder in sports, and just be better people.<br />
<br />
My sister makes me want to be a better person. Even if we're going to get married, I don't want to lose that. So I squeeze my ring and make another wish.<br />
<br />
<i>I wish that siblings</i> have <i>to get married if their parents give permission, even if they don't want to. I wish that I asked permission to marry Colleen, so we could always be together, and produce children as smart and beautiful as ourselves. And I wish... I wish Colleen made up her own mind whether she consented to the marriage, but had to go ahead with it regardless.</i><br />
<br />
Colleen suddenly stopped preening, blushed, and twirled a lock of hair around her fingers. She had gone from a sexy temptress to a shy child in a moment, even if her flesh remained the same. Her lower lip quivered like she was going to cry.<br />
<br />
"What is it, sis? What's the matter?"<br />
<br />
"You know I didn't want to marry you, right, Joey?"<br />
<br />
"I know."<br />
<br />
"You were so excited when you asked Mom and Dad for permission to marry me, it almost broke my heart. You were so happy. You may be a snotty brat and a dorky kid brother, but you're <i>my</i> dorky kid brother, and I really do love you."<br />
<br />
"I know."<br />
<br />
"Just, you know," Colleen suddenly corrected herself, "not in a sexual way. Not before now, anyway."<br />
<br />
"Sure. I understand."<br />
<br />
"In fact, it <i>did</i> break my heart," Colleen whispered, and one tear trickled down her cheek. "I had a boyfriend, and he'd already asked me to marry him, and I'd said yes. Palmer. His name was Palmer. I had to break it off with him when Mom and Dad ordered me to marry you." My sister sucked in a deep breath, and her chest inflated, making her already amazing breasts only more exciting.<br />
<br />
My sister has spectacular tits. I don't blush to say it, either. If I were designing a statue of the ultimate love goddess, she would have my sister's breasts.<br />
<br />
"I didn't know that, sis," I said. "If I'd known you were already engaged, I would have gotten your permission before asking Mom and Dad to be your husband."<br />
<br />
"I'm a good daughter, Joey," Colleen said, so softly I could barely hear her. "And I try to be a good sister. And after tonight, I intend to be a good wife, even a good mother. But I never would have chosen this if Mom and Dad hadn't given me their final word."<br />
<br />
Wow. I hadn't intended that from my wish. I've never even heard of Palmer. That means she was engaged to him right up to the moment I made the wish to make her my wife. I didn't know what to say.<br />
<br />
After a long pause, I stepped up to my sister and placed my hands on her hips. "Do you love me, Colleen?"<br />
<br />
"I love you, Joey."<br />
<br />
"Are you attracted to me? Are you attracted to your baby brother?"<br />
<br />
"I never was before," she said. "But when Mom and Dad ordered me to marry you, I forced myself to think of you in a new way. It took a while to retrain my way of thinking, but now, I realize you may be the handsomest man I've ever met."<br />
<br />
"And you're a goddess of beauty, Colleen. Sexy, smart, talented. I think you and I are two halves of the same whole. I think we will make each other perfect." I cupped my sister's soft cheek in the palm of my hand, and used the other hand to stroke her hair. "But I only want to marry you if you want to marry me. So I'm going to ask the question I should have asked you in the first place."<br />
<br />
I could feel my sexy sister trembling under my touch, delicate as a new spring flower. She dropped her head, but lifted her eyes to look at me through the fringe of her hair, and waited for me to speak.<br />
<br />
"Colleen. Sister. The other half of my heart."<br />
<br />
"Yes?"<br />
<br />
"Will you marry me, and make me the happiest baby brother on earth?"<br />
<br />
The silence went on for what seemed like hours, though it probably only lasted four or five seconds. Then, all of a sudden, her smile was radiant enough to make midnight shine like brightest noon. I have a sexy sister, and tonight, I will have the world's most beautiful incest bride.<br />
<br />
"Yes, Joey, I will marry you."<br />
<br />
My sister caught my face in her hands and kissed me, hard, pushing her tongue into my mouth, and running her fingers through my hair. Her body on mine, her mouth on mine, was the greatest sensual pleasure I'd ever felt. Colleen and I came from the same womb, and soon, we would be joined back together for life.<br />
<br />
After a long moment, Colleen broke the kiss and leaned back, draping her arms around my neck.<br />
<br />
"You know, baby brother, Mom and Dad will be expecting their first grandchild to be on the way when we get back from our honeymoon. I'm still a virgin, and I think you are, too."<br />
<br />
I blushed, and ducked my head.<br />
<br />
Colleen took one hand from around my neck and used it to lift my chin. "Joey? Are you still a virgin?"</p>
