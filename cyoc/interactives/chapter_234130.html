<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aeaea has had plenty of time to develop since Miles had his visit there. His report on the colony was interrupted by the discovery of a sunken ship. With the discovery of that ship came the addition of a museum that covered a fair amount of ancient Greek history, particular regarding the Greek colonies and the trading routes between them. Other additions to the colony were experienced by Abby and Samson as they came here for their honeymoon.<br />
<br />
One of the first places they went to was the marketplace, which, as typical for a Greek colony, was right by the docks. Fortunately, the fresh catch from the sea was kept far enough from the rest of the marketplace. Abby really loved all the different trinkets that were available for purchase. She was particularly interested in the clothes available, including those based on the attire of ancient Greeks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I&#39;m just loving this chiton,&quot; said Abby, looking at the seafoam dress she was wearing, &quot;It feels like something you can wear at any occasion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Speak for yourself,&quot; said Samson, tugging at the bottom of his tunic, &quot;I don&#39;t know why you gave me the short one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you can show off your muscles, of course,&quot; said Abby, &quot;Now you look like a real Olympian like Hercules.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel more like Gluteus Maximus,&quot; said Samson dryly. A sudden sea breeze forced Samson to hold down the bottom of his tunic. &quot;This just seems silly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if you want some motivation for wearing it, how about I wear one while we race around the island?&quot; asked Abby.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know we did bring gym clothes,&quot; said Samson.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but part of the fun&#39;s doing it like the ancient Greeks,&quot; said Abby, &quot;Anyways, you&#39;ll like seeing my backside in one of those tunics.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who says I&#39;ll be seeing your backside? I can outrace you easily,&quot; said Samson.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like to see you try,&quot; said Abby teasingly.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
After their run around the island, Abby and Samson went to the Temple of Asclepius for a spa treatment. Aeaea could definitely earn the reputation of a health resort, especially with all the amenities the spa had to offer. The massages released a lot more tension in their muscles that they didn&#39;t know they had and the hot and cold baths were pretty relaxing. But things got steamy in the sauna.<br />
<br />
&quot;Abby, do you have any idea what that Asclepius was going on about?&quot; asked Samson.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly, I don&#39;t really follow that show,&quot; said Abby, &quot;75% of it just barely makes sense if you know mythology and I try not to think of the other 25%. But I guess people like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, anything else you want to do here?&quot; asked Samson, &quot;Go swimming? See what&#39;s playing at the amphitheater?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, all that, certainly,&quot; said Abby, &quot;But you do know our anniversary is coming up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Already? But we just got married,&quot; said Samson. Abby lowered her towel to expose her breasts. &quot;Oh, that anniversary,&quot; said Samson.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, I was thinking, just in case we&#39;re not back in Lyre in time, how about we do what we did in India?&quot; asked Abby as she took off her towel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, you think it&#39;s going to rain any time soon?&quot; asked Samson.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. The temperature is supposed to keep <i>rising</i>,&quot; said Abby as she stroked her husband&#39;s groin. It didn&#39;t take much to wake up his stallionhood which easily pushed open his towel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I wouldn&#39;t mind it being both hot and wet,&quot; said Samson.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I can provide both,&quot; said Abby before she slid his cock into her mouth.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Later that night, they sneaked out of their room and to a secluded grove. Oh, certainly they could have made love in their room, and that was certainly on the agenda. But ever since Abby&#39;s conversion, there was something special about riding Samson&#39;s schlong in the woods. Admittedly, they already did it before they left for their honeymoon on their special stump, but Abby wanted to recreate the magic here. And the way Samson suckled her nipples while she rode his mighty stallion just drove her while. Then she drew him into a deep kiss, partly to show her love and devotion to him, but also to make sure their cries/whinnies were stifled when they hit their orgasms.<br />
<br />
Abby sighed before pulling off of Samson. &quot;I feel like a lusty nymph with her horny satyr,&quot; she said, satisfied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shouldn&#39;t I be a faun? Those are the ones with horse tails, right?&quot; asked Samson.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can be my big strong centaur if you like,&quot; said Abby, &quot;Have you ever thought about having four legs?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not since I originally had them,&quot; said Samson, &quot;Though I have been thinking about the clip-clopping of other hooves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that so?&quot; asked Abby.<br />
<br />
&quot;Abby, we are legally married now. Your parents have no reason to object having foals. Your mother will be having one soon,&quot; said Samson, &quot;Isn&#39;t it our turn?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Almost,&quot; said Abby, &quot;You see, the Year of the Horse will be coming in two years. I definitely want to compete in it and it will be easier if I&#39;m not pregnant or recently pregnant. Besides, wouldn&#39;t it be great to have our first foal born in the Year of the Horse?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose,&quot; said Samson, &quot;But still...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you won&#39;t be starved for sex until then,&quot; said Abby, &quot;Anyways, we&#39;ve got things to take care of first. Setting up our household and jobs. Because I&#39;m not sure if we can raise our foal in the same house that their grandparents will be raising their uncle or aunt at the same time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess that would be awkward,&quot; said Samson.<br />
<br />
&quot;But we&#39;ll have everything figured out by then,&quot; said Abby and added in a husky tone, &quot;And as soon as that Zodiac Competition is over, we are going to mate until your balls run dry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samson raised his eyebrows and asked, &quot;Is that extra encouragement for me to win?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If that&#39;s what motivates you,&quot; said Abby. She noticed Samson was already rising up again. &quot;And I think that&#39;s a very effective carrot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shall I plant it again?&quot; asked Samson.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s take it back to our room,&quot; said Abby, &quot;I like sleeping outside as much as the next horse, but beds are more comfortable. And it&#39;d be less awkward if someone stumbles across us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samson gave a wicker as he followed his mare back to the House of Circe. As much as he&#39;d like to breed Abby until she full of foals, he respected her wishes. He waited 8 years to give Abby children, he could wait 2 more.</p>
