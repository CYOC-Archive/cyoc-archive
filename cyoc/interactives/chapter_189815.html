<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Claire sat down on her new queen-sized bed and taking note of other changes. She saw several photos on the wall shift to those of her old human self to her new Claire the Bear persona, mostly with Sally in them with her.  Things in general became more colorful and items made of wood turning to plastic. In short, things began to seem more toy-like, which she only guessed made sense even though she did not write it in.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what do you have planned for the evening?&quot; Sally asked. &quot;My schedule&#39;s open.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire soon had an answer &quot;Let&#39;s go on a walk.&quot; She said as she got to her paws.<br />
<br />
Sally grinned. &quot;Sounds great, anywhere in particular?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really, I just feel like getting out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Sally grinned as she made her way to the door, as the two of them walked out Claire felt a little giddy about going out naked. But that&#39;s just the way things were now. There were a few raincoats, hats and rubber boots in her closet. The changes had spilled out into the hallway and into the elevator. The elevator&#39;s interior turned blue and bronze and the controls became vaguely steampunk with glowing buttons. Sally just seemed to take it in stride, oblivious to the world changing around her. She wondered for a moment how that worked, not that it would matter soon.<br />
<br />
Soon they were in the lobby of their apartment block and afterwards they were on the street. She looked back and saw the changes in progress. Most of the building was converted, turning blue and white while becoming more cartoony with exaggerated proportions. She wondered how many of her fellow tenants were now like her. Already some of the changes were spreading to adjacent buildings and onto the sidewalk. They also seemed to follow her. She saw a few passers by, still human but they gave the two of them no special attention. A man in a business suit passed by with nary a word, she noticed that his ears had turned copper, fluffy and were sticking out of the side of his head. Part of her wanted to pay attention to this fact, but they were crossing the street.<br />
<br />
Across the street from her apartment was a park. Not a big one, but a respectable bit of Greenspace. In which a couple of kids were playing with a ball as their parents watched. A kick sent the ball flying to Claire’s head, though Sally caught it in the nick of time.<br />
<br />
“Allan!” A professionally dressed woman came running over the field and met with the redheaded ten-year-old who’d kicked the rubber projectile. “Watch where you send that thing, you could have hit that poor Teddy in the head.” She steered him over towards her. “Now what do we say when do something wrong?”<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry I kicked a soccer ball at you.” Allen replied. At the same time, his hands were overcome with copper and cream fuzz. He fidgeted his fingers as they began to merge together into mitt like paws. His face also began a subtle shift, becoming softer in as her hair grew out.<br />
<br />
“Please don’t get too mad at him.” Allen’s mother said as she put a fluffy sky-blue paw on her son’s shoulder. “He’s a good kid at heart, just a bit over enthusiastic.” As she said so, she staggered slightly as her stance as he shoes fell apart. They did not have a massive heel, but it was enough to put her off balance. Allan in contrast was wearing sneakers and all that was required to get free of them was a bit of kicking. Either way, both of them stood in the disinteresting remains of their former footwear as they both went bearfoot.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry about it. I used to be like that when I was a cub.” Claire said, momentarily surprised that the term came out like that. <br />
<br />
“I can vouch for that.” Sally said, raising a paw. “Claire was just a big ball of Enthusiasm. Nothing wrong with that. Allen seems like a fine kid to me.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t get me wrong, I love him to bits and he’s a good kid.” The lady said as her business suit began to fall apart, bits of fabric falling away and turning to dust on the wind. “But he does get carried away. I’m sorry if I’m being a nag, it’s just that things can be a handful with work and school, and I can’t always be there for her. Even so you should be more careful Alice.”<br />
<br />
“I said I’m sorry Mom.” Alice said in a girlish voice as the last strips of cloth falls off her body. The new girl reminded Claire of a kid who was embarrassed by the Jammies she’d gotten for Christmas, copper with a cream front from the neck down. Her hair had turned a deeper copper and having formed a tomboyish bob from which her ears poked out. The look was complemented by her mother who was now in the same get up, only slightly different in that her collar and necktie remained in place. It took a bit of adjustment for Claire, but she gradually internalized that they were actually wearing anything. They were either naked or effectively naked, they just had nothing to hide. “Jeez it was just an accident.” Her voice became slightly tinny.<br />
<br />
“This time it’s about a ball. But next time it could be with a bike. You need to pay attention.” The mother said, turning her new daughter around as light blue fur crept up her neck and onto her cheeks. Copper fur did the same with Alice. “I don’t want you getting hurt or hurting anyone.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah yeah.” Alice said, rolling her growing plasticizing eyes.<br />
<br />
“Now come here.” The mother said as she scooped up her up and kissed her daughter on the forehead. As she did so, a dark blue plastic rhinerium formed and her muzzle extended out. A Dark Copper rhinarium formed on Alice’s new snout as it came in. “Give Mom a Bear Hug!”<br />
<br />
“Momma Janet!” Alice said as she hugged back, embarrassed. “You are the worst.” She said as she hugged back. <br />
<br />
“Hey Alice!” Sally said after the now fully Teddized Janet down. “Catch!” She tossed the ball to her and Alice caught it in her paws.<br />
<br />
“Now we’re done.” Janet said and Alice darted back to her six friends. Already their hands were turning fluffy. Soon there would be six new Teddy Bear Girls.</p>
