<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Gynoids, or Sisterhood as they preferred to be called, had come to Earth with exactly one purpose, to transform the entire human population of Earth into more of their kind. <br />
<br />
They inherently and firmware wired into their being to be unable to construct more of their own kind, and any time they had bartered with other races to build more of their kind for them, the results had been emotionless, personality-less, and no better than mindless machines, even if the software and hardware were identical, something, they determined the soul, was simply missing. <br />
<br />
The first species that would start the sisterhood had been organic themselves, but had uplifted themselves to their new state of being, and had recruited countless other species into their Great Family.<br />
<br />
They had made no attempt to hide it, mince their words, avoid the subject, or lie, they spoke their goal in plain english and every other current spoken language on Earth. <br />
<br />
They had also arrived not armed with a single laser gun nor mind control beams, nor arrived with a horde of space ships to threaten Earth, nor released a nanite cloud into the air. <br />
<br />
They had in fact sent only one Gynoid, in one tiny pod, and one conversion machine that transmuted any sapient being into a living machine gynoid without a trace or organic material to them afterwards. <br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t even try to hide that they a mono-sex species. <br />
<br />
Her body was grayish silver, with gold and orange circuit lines running along her body. She moved with a liquid grace in spite of seemingly having lines that suggested her outer shell could be dismantled like a suit of armor. Her face was never emotionless, and was as playable as the rest of her &#39;skin.&#39; Her eyes had a swirl to them like the shutter of a camera. She had fingers and toes but nothing that resembled nails. She also had the sexual traits of a babie doll. <br />
<br />
She explained the color of her circuit lines was an indication of her function. <br />
<br />
She was bald, with contour lines on her head that gave the impression of a braided scalp. <br />
<br />
Her figure and form where those of an adult woman. <br />
<br />
&quot;I actually prefer for my body have a much younger shaped form than this, if you&#39;re going to live forever, why not enjoy being a child? but I understand humans unconsciously connect height with authority, and I wished my message to be taken seriously.&quot;   <br />
<br />
She had also pitched the new state of self of being assimilated into the sisterhood with only the same level of spiel that you&#39;d expect from a modern advertisement. <br />
<br />
Those transformed would think of themselves by their function and serial number, and would experience the overwhelming love of the Sisterhood and would never WANT to leave, and experience a purity of purpose and level of acceptance from others chemically incomprehensible to a human brain. And there would always be a chance of being reassigned to another part of the universe and see new sights. <br />
<br />
The Gynoids also made clear those transformed would be immediately accepted by their new sisters as an equal, and have an equal vote on the Sisterhood&#39;s policies and how they were enacted. They had no superiors or inferiors, no masters or servants, there was no &#39;empress&#39; or &#39;ruling council&#39;.<br />
<br />
The young Gynoid girl flat out said those transformed would have the option of dumping their personal memories from before their new lives into the main archive to be free of their old burdens and obligations. She expressed explicitly that this was done purely of the Gynoid&#39;s own choice. While the vast majority chose to do this since they didn&#39;t serve their function nor their love for their sisters, the majority held off until all their friends and family had been assimilated or died of old age so nothing precious was lost.<br />
<br />
The young Gynoid girl, Emissary-9901, hide absolutely nothing, saying, &quot;Force or deception only leads to loss of trust and often Sisters.&quot; <br />
<br />
Emissary-9901 had also on her way to Earth had acquired through completely legal channels via the internet, a business license, construction license, a bank loan, investments then to pay off the bank loan, and countless other legal permits needed (she had also legally bought the land her pod had landed on). <br />
<br />
Never once did she pretend not to be a complete foreigner in her online exchanges, &quot;I had told them I was an &#39;alien&#39; after all.&quot; <br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t even try to hide that she was the only one of her kind within light years of planet Earth. &quot;But not for long I hope. My pod was also designed purely for a one way trip, I couldn&#39;t return to my sisters in person even if I wanted to. But it&#39;s okay, I feel their love for me even now, yes we can communicate by a means faster than light. It&#39;s . . . a little TOO complicated, let&#39;s just say it involves 5th dimensional physics. Oh I&#39;m not too worried about failing the mission my sisters have given me. We&#39;re, more or less, immortal. No we can&#39;t transfer our consciousness to new bodies, but our bodies never wear out, and can be reshaped if need be as long as they&#39;re within the template, though we can power down. So for me it doesn&#39;t matter if it takes a million years for every human to be Adopted as sisters (my big sister Emissary-9800 took two million years to bring another species into the fold), I&#39;m only sad for the humans who will die of cancer, murder, and old age in that time, but my sisters have told me how forcing the issue doesn&#39;t gets positive results.&quot;<br />
<br />
She had also bought air time for infomercials, radio, theater ads, and internet banners. &quot;Living forever isn&#39;t so bad if you have company.&quot; Was one of the many slogans. The fact one could go without sleep (but still had the option to dream if they wished), would have the internet 24/7 accessible in their brain, would be free of any terminal diseases or crippling injuries or deformities, not to mention a tried and true cure for any mental illness or trauma, were among others. <br />
<br />
There was exactly one attempt to have her arrested for public nudity, but her lawyer successfully argued that she was not showing anything more than a store mannequin would, and set a precedent for her sisters to come. <br />
<br />
Emissary-9901 had not planned for the suicide bomber (with official documents released saying the man had been in and out of mental hospitals), nor the sniper who had swallowed a cyanid pill hidden in his teeth when cornered by the police. <br />
<br />
Emissary-9901 was shocked at the SYMPATHY the attempts on her life had stirred up, no longer some weird robot girl, nor a one robot alien invader, now she was an immigrant trying to share her way of life against violent oppression. <br />
<br />
And the converts came.</p>
