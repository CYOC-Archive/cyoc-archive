<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I had a very good view from below at her ample spheric breasts in that position. Steph clenched her jaws and pressed me down, her huge powerful tail resting on my legs. Just like her partner she had a very strong build, with visible muscles and defined cubic abs, but she was also very feminine and not overly bulk, much larger then me, but not huge enough to crash me with such manoeuvres. Although I did feel pressure of course, and more so - the psychological pressure of her wanting me deeper, stronger... more... to her size.<br />
<br />
I was never so ashamed of myself in my life. This magnificent creature was sitting on top of me, her godly forms and skill beyond perfection, and I, a mere mortal, was unable to give her the pleasure that she was expecting. It really pained me to watch her like this, with me so deep into her and still lost like a little adventurer. I grabbed her waist and pushed back as hard as I could. Steph moaned and spread her wings, opening her muzzle slightly and raising her head to the sky. She sat still for a few seconds, breathing heavily, her huge chest going up and down and almost her entire body shrinking a bit and growing back as she tried to recover. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let me show you how this is done&quot; Michelle gently pushed her lover away and now Steph rolled to the side, providing some space for the black dragoness. What did she mean? I gulped. If Steph was a goddess with pure white scales, something heavenly and unreachable, Michelle must have been a demon, her sleek scales black as night and yellow eyes with an almost predatory expression. Her body was just as well built as her lover&#39;s, but even larger in comparison. I was seriously afraid for my life now when she crawled to me, the bed dangerously squeaking under her weight. Her legs were long and powerful, ending in three razor-sharp claws each, which she made sure to lift up a bit not to shred me into slices as she threw one leg over me and rested on top, her curvy body and long neck towering over me. She slowly reached out to my chin, grabbing it carefully with her paw and directing me as she bent down, closer and closer. Our lips touched. I was mesmerized. Her huge yellow eyes were like something completely out of this world. Before I knew it, my lips parted slightly and I gave her a kiss that I will never forget. She returned it moments later by licking me in the face with a long wet tongue, but she did not seems satisfied. She kept pushing my lips with it and I, still puzzled about her intentions, finally caught on and allowed her in. We merged again in a moment of absolute perfection, her giving the rhythm, reaching out to me and then pulling back, letting me to explore her canine teeth and hot warming breath. As we parted, I noticed for the first time that her mouth did not feel as big as it looked. but now I was completely shocked. She did look smaller now, much smaller then moments ago, even smaller then her lover! Michelle became more human-sized, still a bit too large for a human girl, but about my height now, if only just a little taller. She retained her appearance and proportions though, her huge chest diminishing from gigantic to quite sizeable, but still very prominent on her shape. Her muscles toned down, not like a body-builder any more, but still visibly defined under the tight black scales. Her paws and tail shrank just a bit too, the claws still very fearsome, but not so life-threatening now. Only now after I had been staring at her for quite some time, I finally noticed that she was also examining me. She was sitting on top of me relaxed, but also a little... posing? Our eyes met and I got lost again in her yellow curious stare. Michelle seemed to smirk, but I couldn&#39;t tell for sure with her muzzle. She might as well have just decided to eat me. <br />
<br />
  &quot;Now... where were we?&quot; She smiled wider, revealing rows of white fangs &quot;Am I more to your tastes now? You don&#39;t need to reply&quot; She suppressed a chuckle as she leaned down and our crotches touched, now me noticing to my embarrassment how hard I was &quot;I can tell&quot; She smiled again, leaning even closer to me and gently pressing down on my cock. She was tight! So tight, I felt like a lost adventurer trying to squeeze through a narrow cliff. She had the same texture as her lover - very smooth and slithery like a snake, but the sensation was magnified tenfold now that she basically encased me. She let me all the way in and just as slowly started to pull out. I couldn&#39;t bear this sensation of scales rubbing against it just as I was about to go off. She did it on purpose, she was teasing me. I felt grief and anger as she very slowly took me out. I wanted back in, I was so close! She teased me, played with me, always making sure I was hanging on the very edge, but not tripping over. I was tortured. I closed my eyes and tried to imagine the sensation again, but felt the black dragoness putting her claw onto the top and intercepting me.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Unh-unh&quot; She smiled teasingly, inserting the tip of the claw into the opening and pulling the skin up with both other claws, sealing me completely &quot;Not just yet! Save it... for Steph!&quot; Her eyes narrowed as she giggled, pleased &quot;She wants you... right?&quot;<br />
<br />
  But I could not hold it any longer. I was about to cum, but if she held me like that this would be very painful. Perhaps, she was right about her lover, who seemed more interested in me, but right now I wanted Michelle and only Michelle. I couldn&#39;t hold it any longer, I had to get her now! I struggled and tossed her to the other side, now coming on top. I was surprised for a moment since she could easily overpower me if she wanted, but the black dragoness didn&#39;t act as reclusive as she wanted to appear. Perhaps, she did want me to advance after all. Now that I seized the initiative I had to come up with games of my own.</p>
