<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">CYOC was enjoying transforming people and changing up the world. It felt that more chaos was always necessary.<br />

<br />
Marc was the most stereotypical flamboyant gay man you would ever meet. Pink streaks in his short styled blond hair, a very wimpy <br />
physique, hwavy lisp, and a passion for all things &quot;fabulous&quot;, Marc was the very definition of a twink.<br />
<br />
Marc was out with his two girlfriends at La Bootique, a dress shop in their local mall. One of them, Laylea, was going on a date. She'd <br />
brought Marc and their friend Tanya along to help pick a dress for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like, ohmigod. Laylea, check out this dress!&quot; squealed Marc, after picking out a poofy leopard print dress from the rack.<br />
&quot;Marc, I'm 23 not 40!&quot; exclaimed Laylea. &quot;I'd rather not have something that looks cougar like!&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, you'll want him to know that you can play hard, kitten!&quot; exclaimed Marc, imitating a cat purring, as he clawed the air with his <br />
hand.<br />
Laylea laughed, &quot;Let's go for something that won't freak my date out, alright?&quot;<br />
&quot;Fine.&quot; said Marc, then he pouted, looking at other dresses. Marc looked at the rack, but was having difficulty finding any desirable items <br />
for Laylea to wear.<br />
&quot;Laylea!&quot; exclaimed Marc, &quot;There's nothing fabulous here!&quot; He sounded like a child who wasn't getting a treat when they wanted one.<br />
&quot;Calm down Marc, I'm sure there's something. Go look at the back of the store, that's not the only rack.&quot;<br />
&quot;Fine.&quot; said Marc, with attitude. He started to walk to the back of the store. He felt a little pain throughout his body, and his clothes felt a <br />
little tight.<br />
&quot;That's weird, I specifically buy clothes a size over mine in case I get fat and stretch. Ugh, this is a disaster!&quot; whined Marc, but then he <br />
remember his task. &quot;Right, I need to get dresses for Laylea. Gotta focus.&quot;<br />
Marc scanned the rack, but was soon finding himself bored. All the dresses looked the same, there was no real dresses that stood out <br />
as fabulous to Marc.<br />
Marc walked back through the store, to Laylea. &quot;Laylea, I'm getting bored of this.&quot; he said.<br />
&quot;Really? It's not like you to get bored of dress shopping, Marc.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, I'm bored. And my clothes feel tight. I'm going to look around the mall and see if I can get anything to change into.&quot;<br />
&quot;Erm... alright them Marc. Are you feeling ok? You look more.. brown, and your voice sounds different.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, what do you mean, different?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, it sounds less... erm...&quot; stammered&nbsp;Laylea.<br />
&quot;What, spit it out!&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, lispy. It sounds clearer than it did before.&quot;<br />
&quot;Why would you bring that up? Ugh!&quot; shouted Marc, as he felt another painful jolt throughout his body. &quot;I gotta change clothes... ugh.&quot; <br />
he said, as he left La Bootique.<br />
Across the hall, a Surf's Up was located. Surf's Up was a store for surf wear. Marc felt himself walk in there, not really caring what he <br />
was going to wear, as long as it was comfortable.<br />
He walked in and grabbed a pair of board shorts and went directly to the change room. In there, he stripped.<br />
He put the shorts on, not noticing there wasn't any tags or anything on them and that they fit him like a glove, despite being a large size.<br />
Marc was pissed off, being insulted by that stupid bitch Laylea. She was just like any woman, good for cleaning and cooking, and sex. <br />
His anger rushed through his body as his muscles expanded. His hair grew longer and lost the pink, spiking up in a cool haircut. His <br />
face became more macho, a face that any girl would melt looking at, well, if he wasn't so angry at the moment anyway. His feet grew to <br />
a size 16, thickening, as his flip-flops grew to accomodate. His muscle expanded, and his cock started to grow and fill with blood, <br />
tenting.<br />
Marc noticed this, and pulled down the board shorts, grabbing his big cock with his meaty hands and starting to jack off. He thought of <br />
that bitch, Laylea, and thought of ploughing her hard. He imagined ramming his cock in her ass and her vagina, as he rubbed and <br />
rubbed, starting to come to a climax, when suddenly a load of hot, thick, cum splattered against the change room door, followed by 6 <br />
more loads. Marc grabbed his head, as it was in pain now, and felt a bizarre feeling. It felt as if he was spinning, and the world around <br />
him was too. He looked up, and saw there was no mess on the stall, and his old clothes weren't on the ground.<br />
Those thoughts swiftly left Marcus' head as he left the stall and went into La Bootique to meet his girlfriend, Laylea. She was shopping <br />
for a dress for their date tonight. Lucky bitch, she would definitely be experiencing some great fucking tonight.<br />

<br />
The owner of the Hotel De Prestigion was strolling through the lobby. He was certainly succesful, owning a large profitable hotel, and he <br />
liked to show it off. His custom suit, navy blue, the hotel's color, was embroidered with the company logo over his heart. Gus O'Connor <br />
was certainly proud of his hotel.<br />
However, he wasn't entirely proud of his heritage. Gus was Irish, born Angus, and from a family who proudly represented themselves as <br />
such. Gus never connected with that in his upbringing, so after he moved out, he drifted from his family. Gus had his hair died dark <br />
brown, and had no trace of accent left anymore. Gus didn't like many traditional Irish things. He especially hated bagpipes.<br />
Gus was irritated, as there was an Irish festival going on in town, and that meant plenty of culture he had tried to leave behind. Gus <br />
tried to calm himself, by closing his eyes and thinking, &quot;It's only a weeks length...&quot; but loud bagpipe playing interrupted his thoughs.<br />
He opened his eyes to see a large Irishman in the lobby, playing bagpipes. Gus approached the man, keeping a stern look on his face, <br />
saying &quot;Excuse me, do you have no respect? We cannot have people playing bagpipes in our hotel!&quot;<br />
&quot;Ay, laddie, I'm truly sorry!&quot; replied the man, in a thick Irish accent, &quot;couldja please forgive me, I's just celebratin' the festival!&quot;<br />
&quot;Ah, I'm... sorry.&quot; replied Gus, &quot;Bagpipes aren't my thing. Are you here for a room?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, laddie. If you'd have any available I'd like to take one!&quot; the man replied.<br />
&quot;I'll be right back, sir.&quot; said Gus. He went to the check-in counter, and retrieved an unreserved key.<br />
Gus approached the man and handed him the key, &quot;Here, your room will be 407. Enjoy your stay at the&nbsp;Hotel De Prestigion.&quot;<br />
&quot;Many thanks, good lad. My name is Seamus O'Dwyer!&quot; the man said, as he stuck out his hand.<br />
Gus grabbed it and gave it a shake. &quot;Angus O'Connors.&quot; he replied, as they both went their own ways. Gus went on the elevator to his <br />
penthouse. He was feeling tired.<br />
Smooth jazz was playing on his entrance, he liked to keep it on all the time. Gus went to his luxurious bathroom and stripped down to <br />
nothing. He was skinny, with little body hair to speak of. He noticed his hair seemed a bit lighter, but disregarded it as the new light he <br />
had installed yesterday in the bathroom. Gus went into his room and crawled naked into bed.<br />
When Gus woke up, it was 4:00 PM. He heard soft bagpipes playing overhead instead of his smooth jazz. He listened for a moment, <br />
and decided he rather liked the sound of it. He went into the bathroom, and scratched his head of red, curly hair. It was feeling a bit <br />
itchy.<br />
Gus turned on the shower, waited for the water to heat up, and got into the shower. He patted his gut, and ran his fingers down his <br />
treasure trail. He felt, stimulated, doing that. Gus put anti-dandruff shampoo in his hands, and lathered his curly locks, massaging his <br />
scalp as he did. He then rinsed it out, and washed himself with Irish Spring soap.<br />
Gus got dressed in dress pants and a green polo shirt, and headed to the lobby. He saw his friend Seamus there.<br />
&quot;Hello buddy!&quot; he exclaimed, as he went downstairs.<br />
&quot;Angus! It's good to see ya!&quot; exclaimed Seamus in response. &quot;Do ya want to grab a bite fa dinna out?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sounds great to me, pal!&quot; exclaimed Angus. The two left the hotel, heading to The Shamrock, an Irish eatery.<br />
The two were seated, and got drinks. &quot;So, Angus, what part of the homeland are ya from?&quot; asked Seamus.<br />
&quot;I'm from Connacht, actually.&quot; said Angus.<br />
&quot;Me too!&quot; exclaimed Seamus. &quot;That's pretty cool!&quot;<br />
The waiter approached them and asked them to order food. Seamus ordered some Irish Stew, while Angus ordered some Black <br />
Pudding. When their food came, Angus devoured his, eating really fast. His belly rumbled.<br />
As the evening went on, Angus kept on eating servings of Black Pudding. Seamus was laughing and having a good time, as Angus ate. <br />
&quot;Angus, ya always knew how ta eat a bunch, you fool!&quot; exclaimed Seamus, laughing.<br />
After his seventh serving of Black Pudding, Angus felt a sudden sickness. &quot;Ugh... Seamus, we've got ta go back to ta hotel, I'm feeling <br />
a wee bit ill...&quot; he muttered.<br />
&quot;Sure, brother, just let me pay for your eats first!&quot; exclaimed Seamus, as he waved down the waiter and recieved the bill. He gave the <br />
waiter an hundered dollar bill and a fifty, shouting keep the change, as he took Angus back to the hotel.<br />
Angus and Seamus went to room 407, and Angus went directly to the bathroom. He took off his clothes in there, and rubbed his hairy <br />
chest. There was a lot of red hair on his body, and his gut was rather large. Angus scratched his face, as red hairs began to crawl out of <br />
the pores on his face, twisting and multiplying forming a decent beard and moustache combo.<br />
&quot;Oh, me head..&quot; stammered Angus, as his head started to pound. Angus got in the shower, and washed up, making sure to do a good <br />
job cleaning his hairy body.<br />
Angus went to the bedroom, where Seamus was lying on one bed. Instictively, Angus went to the wardrobe by the empty bed and <br />
pulled out sleep clothes for him, or rather, a large pair of underpants. Angus lied down on the empty bed and pulled the blankets over <br />
him. &quot;Brother, I'm going to bed. Good night Seamus.&quot;<br />
Seamus wished him goodnight, and left the room, turning the light off as he left.<br />
Angus O'Dwyer woke up to his brother giggling with glee. &quot;Seamus, why're ya so giddy?&quot; he asked.<br />
&quot;Brother, the parade is today! Dress up in yer kilt and get yer bagpipes, we're leaving soon!&quot; exclaimed Seamus.<br />
Angus ruffled his curly red hair on his head, and scratched the body hair on his chest. He put on his kilt, going shirtless for the day, and <br />
got his bagpipes. Angus was ready for the Ireland Parade.<br />
&quot;Aye, little brother,&quot; started Seamus as he noticed Angus was ready, &quot;Gonna let the world see your rug today?&quot;<br />
Angus let out a hearty, Irish laugh, &quot;The world best be ready for ma rug. Come brother, let's go play some bagpipes!&quot;<br />
Angus amd Seamus O'Dwyer left the hotel room, ready for the parade so they could proudly display their Irish heritage.<br />
