<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">From the doorway, Etta called him back.  “Hey!”<br />
Her boyfriend, Merritt Sivertsen, again transformed into an amazingly good looking 11 ½ year old blond boy came running back to her clearly enjoying even the simple act of running in his little body.<br />
“Yeah?” he asked grinning suddenly beside her. <br />
“Don’t we have to have a story that we’ve agreed on, before we talk to other people?”<br />
He sighed, with a bashful grin.  “Of course, I-I just get so into whatever identity I get changed into I-I sort of lose track sometimes.”<br />
<br />
They discussed it for a minute, both putting in suggestions and refining the story.  Etta told him that she’d come into the country from Poland when she was 14.  He’d have been 3.  They decided to say that their family lived in Idaho, now but Etta lived in DC and Marek was just visiting and getting to see all the sights.<br />
<br />
Elzbieta and Marek showed up at the neighbor’s barbecue and played their parts as the suitably deferential house sitters.  It was easier for little Marek.  He ran around the neighbor’s giant yard playing with the neighborhood kids, outrunning them, outplaying them, even the older ones, at every turn, wowing them and the watching adults with how fast he was.  <br />
<br />
Elzbieta sat among the rich pretentious dullard couples and bit her tongue as she listened to their stories the point of which seemed to be that they were wonderful for having made the money they’d made and now for having the outlook they did that other people’s money, not theirs of course but others’ should be given away.  They were all what she’d heard someone call ‘Champagne Socialists’.  She couldn&#39;t tell that any of them actually did anything productive.  She carefully offered as little as possible about herself.<br />
<br />
She was helped in this regard by a clear undertone of comparison and then jealousy on the part of the better looking of the neighborhood wives.  The couple of fat women didn’t feel any rivalry or threat to their status from her.  But her mere presence subtly took the better looking wives down a peg with her looks.  Etta was a beautiful 24 year old.  The better looking wives weren’t a match for her and were late 30’s desperately, conspicuously trying to come off as late 20’s.  They didn’t want to bring any more attention to her than necessary.  <br />
<br />
They had no such reservations about Marek, reaching out to feel his wavy blond hair, rubbing fingers against his cheek and making catty comments to each other about his little buns.  One wife sighed and remarked to Etta, “Your little brother is so gorgeous.  He looks like he walked out of a Maxfield Parrish painting.”  <br />
<br />
Marek didn’tpay any attention to it.  He was having too much fun just playing with the other boys.<br />
<br />
At one point, Etta waved for him to come over to her side.  He sprinted past a couple of the other boys to her hip.  <br />
“Let me run the machine’s control when we get back,” she whispered through his thick blond hair to his ear underneath.<br />
“You wanna make me much bigger, huh?” he whispered.  “Being alone with you always makes part of me much bigger!” he added and waggled his wispy eyebrows at her before running off.  In no time he was laughing again at being chased by all the other boys and their inability to catch him.  She smiled at how easily he enjoyed himself.<br />
<br />
It was really obvious at times like this.  But, Etta recalled that she’d had this thought about Merritt before.  Some people were simply miserable, always finding ways to be under a cloud even when the sun seemed to be shining everywhere.  Other people were simply happy and that was Merritt.  He could be perfectly serious and solemn but once a task was done, his natural condition was to be enjoying himself.  He had a wonderful afternoon running around and playing as an 11 ½ year old boy.  He hadn’t even minded being an ugly, hairy gorilla.  <br />
<br />
Etta thought of the list of his previous transformations that were displayed on the machine the night before.  Had he enjoyed that one, too?  Hmmm.  Bigger but maybe not quite in the shape you expect.  She smiled.<br />
<br />
It was in the back of her mind from then till dark.  At dusk, Elzbieta and Marek had said polite goodbyes to everyone and gone back to the mansion they were supposedly house-sitting and he went up the stairs.  “I want to get back to an adult body,” he said over his shoulder.  <br />
<br />
“Wait!” she called after him.  “Let me do it.”<br />
She begged to be the one to go through the menus and run the machine.  He sighed and nodded.  “Okay.”<br />
<br />
She told him how she’d paid close attention to what he’d done the night before.  And she had.  He knew she was sharp and he trusted her so little Merritt stepped off to one side and didn’t even look over  her shoulder at the screen.<br />
<br />
Etta just picked the previously used profile and made a couple changes, setting strength of libido at the maximum of the range and orientation to precisely mid range.  She pressed START and answered YES to the prompt asking if she was sure.<br />
<br />
Little Merritt felt the electromagnetic wave go through him and started growing.  But something was different.  This wasn’t the instantaneous change to his adult self.  Merritt got taller but not six foot one. His hips widened out and became even fuller and a wavy blond crown of hair became chestnut brown shoulder length tresses.  His penis shortened and shortened and disappeared leaving behind a pussy framed between wisps of light brown hair.  Her shoulders narrowed and at her chest were two D cup but still perky breasts.  <br />
<br />
Merritt had been turned into Mary.  “Very funny,” said Mary and Etta smirked at what a high voice she had.  Merritt’s was unusually low but as a woman, Mary’s was extra high.  It was the kind of voice that could mark a girl as a bimbo upon the first stray dumb remark.<br />
<br />
But Mary didn’t demand to be turned back or even complain.  She opened the closet door and looked at her extremely hourglass shaped female form.  Etta watched very carefully and noted that her boyfriend turned little boy turned female looked at herself in the mirror with something akin to a feeling of pride.<br />
<br />
Etta circled her and chuckled. “Oh my god..  You make such a beautiful woman.  I mean, you have a great ass as a guy, a pair of buns totally worthy of ballet tights.  But look at those!  Hahahahahahaha!  Oh my god!” chortled Etta.  “The Kardashians get inserts to have a super booty but that’s just you!”<br />
<br />
Etta slapped Mary’s ass hard.  She just had to touch those.  Mary spun on her and grabbed her hands.  The two wrestled for a few moments and tumbled onto the bed.  Mary was on top and looked down at Etta grinning.  She kissed her.  <br />
<br />
Etta gasped when their lips finally parted.  <br />
<br />
This!  Totally this!<br />
<br />
For the next hour two beautiful women feverishly kissed, caressed and licked each other.  Etta was surprised at how completely comfortable her one time boyfriend was with this.  <br />
<br />
In a moment of recovery afterward, Mary remarked to the ceiling with Etta lying beside her.  “I once saw some porn of two girls.  It was really hot and somebody in the room said every straight guy likes it because he thinks he’ll get to join in with them.  I didn’t realize that this was what he meant.”<br />
<br />
Etta got up and Mary didn’t pay any attention to it, she was still sort of regaining her bearings.  Suddenly she noticed the sounds of typing.  She looked over to the side of the room and saw beautiful Etta get up from the chair of the desk, click once, then click again and then stand a foot away.  <br />
<br />
Mary watched in surprise as 5 foot 8, 116 pound Etta became six foot one and a half, 175 pound Eddie, a strikingly handsome blond athlete with the same sky blue eyes, but with a strong jaw and chiseled cheekbones.  <br />
<br />
Eddie advanced on Mary, climbed atop the bed and then grinned down at her.  He grabbed her little wrists in his big hands and held her arms down by her sides and licked and blew his breath on her nipples.  He rubbed his palm hard at the top of the split of her magnificent ass, kissed her neck and the insides of her elbows and liked at her outer lips.  He made Mary wild with desire before he ever entered her and then amazed her with his staying power.  She moaned loud at all the different ways he did her.<br />
<br />
And when young athlete Eddy was temporarily exhausted, he turned to Mary lying half the bed away. “I love that you just go with it no matter what it is.”<br />
<br />
Eddie lay there pondering this for a few minutes when suddenly he noticed the sounds of typing.  And then he felt an electromagnetic wave go through him.  He flinched, wondering how he’d change but didn’t notice anything different.  He rolled to the side and saw Mary changing back into Merritt.  And then Eddie realized what had changed.  He wanted that extra round, extra deep boy ass now.  Now.  He got off the bed and approached Merritt and could see that something was different about him, too.  The look in his eyes!<br />
<br />
Merritt had made them both completely gay.  Eddie laughed.  So did Merritt.  They exchanged a few feverish kisses but then came the inevitable contest.  Each wanted to fuck that other boy.  Now.<br />
<br />
They wrestled to the ground, then were up then rolled down the stairs in one grappling ball of beautiful boy and then grunted and strained to gain control in the living room.  Eddie could see that he was slightly bigger and weighed slightly more but found that lighter Merrit was just as strong and faster.  In the darkened living room, Merritt asserted his superiority and bent Eddie over a low couch.  The blond resisted the chestnut haired boy until that first full thrust.  Eddie gasped.  It was quite different getting Merritt’s epic penis in this body.  <br />
<br />
Merritt slapped his buns as hard as he could and drove his huge dong into the masculinized version of his girlfriend giving him/her an extra little back and forth with his purple mushroom top just inside Eddie to stimulate the nerves there.  Eddie went from pained resister to pleased receptor in minutes.  When Merritt was finally spent he straightened Eddie up and they kissed again.  <br />
<br />
After just a short period of truce, Eddie started up grappling again.  “My turn!” he said trying to wrestle Merritt into position where he could express dominance over and desire for him.  But, again, lighter Merritt was simply a better athlete and a better wrestler and fighter.  This time he spread Eddie’s legs as wide as he could and stroked his penis with one hand.  Eddie completely surrendered to everything that  was done to him.  <br />
<br />
Again Merritt straightened him up and kissed him and again it was blond Eddie who violated the truce afterward with a slap of Merrit’s spectacular ass and an attempt to hold him in a full nelson.  But Merritt wriggled out of it and in short order had gained the upper hand on Eddie again.  But he couldn’t ignore the blond boy’s deep frustration at starting to lose yet again.  Merritt let him go and retreated, laughing, back up stairs.  Eddie chased after him and caught him in the bedroom.  <br />
<br />
Merritt couldn’t stop laughing and he just didn’t have the heart to dominate him again.  In short order, Eddie had Merritt bent over the side of the bed and was giving his slightly smaller lover everything he had.  At first it was very difficult for Merritt but after a minute he was loving it.  <br />
<br />
After finishing, Eddie chuckled, “You’re sure no one did that to you when you were taking ballet?”<br />
Merrit just laughed.  “Nope.  No one.  A lot of them wanted to . . . ”<br />
<br />
Now Eddie was exhausted and passive recipient Merrit went to the Chronivac again.  In a minute, Eddie felt an electromagnetic wave pass through him and saw breasts grow on his chest, his penis disappear, his shoulders and waist narrow, hips widen and hair lengthen.  She was beautiful Etta again.  <br />
<br />
And from the way Merritt grinned approaching her she could tell he’d returned his own sexuality to normal.  <br />
<br />
“Now that we’ve covered all the options . . “ he chuckled taking her in his arms and Etta laughed with him.  “I just want to be with you like this,” he said kissing her.<br />
“Me too,” she whispered.<br />
<br />
They woke up the next morning still spooning from hours before.  Merritt spoke both of their thoughts saying, “We’ve gotta make the right moves to be able to stay together like this.”</p>
