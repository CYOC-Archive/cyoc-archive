<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The man aproaches you he greets you with a hello he says hello to you and says he knows about the ring and that you have it you start to feel uncomfortable but he tells you that you needn&#39;t worry all he needs is for you to know the rings abilities and understand everything he tells you that he is aware of the incident at the school and makes sure to explain to you that you can be anyone you desire so long as you think about them while wearing the ring thankfully you took it off after your first &quot;experience&quot; with your new body and so there has been no more changes he says that the ring not only grants you the ability to trade bodies but it also makes whatever body your in immortal as long as it is you that is inside it the body will never age meaning you could essentially live forever second that once you switch things will become complicated he uses what happened at your school as an example even though you could get your old body back you will still be in custody while the the body you traded will ben free as people who have had their body stolen tend to make a scene and end up incarcerated in some kind of hospital he also makes sure to tell you that when you do trade bodies the ring will move to your new body with you that way the person who was removed from their body can&#39;t simply take it back you can be rid of the ring whenever you wish but you will still be in whatever body you were in when you discarded the ring and you&#39;d still be &quot;protected&quot; by immortality which means there&#39;s no going back once you abandon it once the ring is abandoned if it&#39;s not already in a populated area where someone will find it than it will appear somewhere that it will be found and lastly it isn&#39;t the only ring of its kind there are others with the same exact properties and it&#39;s not hard to find them but if you&#39;ve abandoned your ring you cannot use another you find as the rings know if you abandoned one of them and they also prefer a new user to begin with oh and he ads a final note you do gain access to the bodies previous owners memories all you have to do is simply think about it and you&#39;ll be able to &quot;remember&quot; something in great detail that way no one will grow suspicious of you. before the man goes he hands you a small booklet he tells you that if you ever need a reminder of what i told you all you need to do is read the book have a good day &quot;claire&quot; he says with a chuckle you stop to think about all that he says told you and you put the booklet in your jacket pocket and continue home as you enter your house you see claire&#39;s dad waiting for you he asks where you&#39;ve been he&#39;s a bit upset he tells you not to be out for so long he also tells you that he heard about what happened at school and wanted to make sure you were ok you laugh and say that your fine that it&#39;s over and that the boy (the real claire) is gone claire&#39;s dad smiles and says good he then retreats to what you now know is his office you also learned his name by &quot;rembering&quot; his name is anthony he owns several businesses and is quite rich his wife (and claire&#39;s mom) passed away three years ago since then it&#39;s been just the two of you and you also know that he&#39;s very busy a lot so claire never gets see much of him which suits you just fine acting like your claire all the time wouldn&#39;t be kind of boring and you don&#39;t like boring so you head up to your room which has a giant flat screen tv and an xbox you turn on both of them and see that claire had quite the game collection she had hundreds of games even games that were only released two weeks ago it&#39;s good that claire was a nerd like you it probably would have been difficult to convince anthony (the real claire&#39;s dad) that you have new interests acting is important now if people start to realize what you can do then &quot;your life&quot; would be very difficult after a bit of time playing some games you get a call from taylor you forgot you gave her your new phone number it was difficult trying to give it to her it&#39;s not like you knew you could just &quot;remember&quot; things you had to look at her phone and find it in contacts just to tell her thankfully her phone didn&#39;t have a lock on it or giving your number at all would have been hard you answer the phone and taylor says how much fun she had and asked if the two of you could do it more often and then she asked if this meant we were special and you say yes she&#39;s happy and you can&#39;t wait until your next meet up the thought of having sex with her again just exites you and you being in feel wet you can&#39;t help yourself and you romove your clothes and kneel on both knees rubbing your vagina you try to keep your voice down so anthony doesn&#39;t hear and you just quietly moan and moan each second feeling more pleasurable than the last you orgasm about 12 times and then finally finish you clean up same as last time and just like last time you don&#39;t even bother putting on clothes tomorrow will be friday and this will be the first real time you will he noticed in school you can&#39;t wait and your sure plenty of people will hit on you and you can&#39;t wait for the attention and friends you&#39;ll have.</p>
