<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer grunted as she bent to pick up the sodden towel from the floor of the bathroom. Hooves and ceramic tiles mixed poorly; she had learned this the hard way, landing on her girly ass several times in an embarrassing show of balance. She still wasn&#39;t used to walking around on hard hooves, and water with tiles turned everything into a skating rink. <br />
<br />
Wisely she&#39;d begun lining the bathroom and shower basin with towels before taking showers. It burned through the clean towels at a ferocious rate, but, since all she had to do was throw the wet towels into the hamper and go to sleep before they appeared again, magically dry, folded an fluffy in the press, she didn&#39;t mind using them liberally. Just another mystery of the cabin.<br />
<br />
With a *splat* the towel landed in the hamper as Jennifer deposited it there on the way  to the bedroom. Naked and dripping, she strode carefully from bathroom to bedroom, hips swaying and enormous equine cock bouncing. Once on the hardwood of the bedroom she was much more sure-footed and confidently crossed to the vanity. Picking a pre-prepared towel she began to dry herself. First burying her face in it, then wiping her shoulders, lifting her perky tear-drop breasts and drying under them, dabbing down her belly, before roughly tousling the fur of her lower abdomen.<br />
<br />
Sweeping the towel over her shapely thighs and long legs Jennifer finally returned to her privates. Carefully she dabbed dry the giant horsecock, and almost reverently cradled the enormous black glossy balls in furry towel. She didn&#39;t want to give it too strong a towelling in case the cabin took that as a sign she wanted to play.<br />
<br />
Finally Jennifer picked up a hair dryer and began the final part of her daily cleaning ritual, making herself pretty.<br />
<br />
Leaning in to her new looks and body, Jennifer had found she thoroughly enjoyed spending time on her image and trying different looks. She was constantly amazed at how different she looked depending on what she did with her hair, clothes and make-up.<br />
<br />
Today she began as usual, by blow drying and brushing the long hair of her tail and head. Both batches of glossy raven hair had grown incredibly quickly in the past few weeks, with her head hair reaching her lower back, and her tail hair draped down to her upper calves. Brushing her hair now was a mammoth task that took the better part of an hour, half an hour for her rich dark head hair, and another half hour to brush the thick hair of her horses tail.<br />
<br />
Once finished she turned with her back to the mirror and looked back over her shoulder. She still had the muscles of her former life, but they had been toned down a bit, now softer, more rounded, less sharp. Her arms and back looked good, fit and toned, but with widened hips, a narrow waist and two long curtains of black, one framed by the pale of her sides, the other tracing a black line between her pale ass cheeks.<br />
<br />
Jennifer winked over her shoulder and bit her lip. She looked good from behind, and she felt powerful because of it. She turned to the vanity and pulled out the heavy wooden chair. With a practiced motion she flicked her tail out of the way so she didn&#39;t trap it when she sat down. She then pulled a book to her, a book that had appeared one morning, no doubt created by the Cabin, but one she&#39;d come to rely heavily on. A book of style, fashion and make up guides.<br />
<br />
Painting her toenails was about the only thing she hadn&#39;t tried at this stage, considering their turn to hooves, but most other activities and styles she had trialled to varying degrees of success.<br />
<br />
Flicking through the book she stopped at certain pages, flicked between earmarked or tagged sections, and scribbled down notes on a little jotter beside the book. Eventually deciding on a combination she put the book aside and smiled. With glee her fingers danced up to her scalp, and with deft practiced motions, Jennfer braided her hair into a long triple braid running down her back. Not finished from there she also braided her horses tail and secured the ends with a yellow bow.<br />
<br />
Make up was next, simple touches of red making her cheeks look blushed against her pale skin. Glossy, saturated red lipstick made her lips absolutely pop. Nails were filed neatly and painted red to match her lipstick. She then stood and spritzed herself with varying floral scents surrounding her, before taking a dab of rose oil, and touching it to the base of her cock, and the tips of her nipples.<br />
<br />
Giggling like mad she opened the cloths drawers next and pulled out undergarments, or rather, an undergarment. A thong with a heavy laced front to it was produced that was slipped over her hooves and long legs; pulled up the string went snugly into her ass cheeks, while the front covered her pussy with room to spare; that room had a purpose though as she pulled the elastic band and dropped her giant horse testicles to sit neatly in the front pouch of the panty. A similar coloured elastic lace garter slipped around the base of her cock completed that part of the look.<br />
<br />
Jennifer didn&#39;t bother with a bra, she didn&#39;t see the point since her breasts seemed to defy gravity. So next she pulled one dress she had never tried on before. A shoulder clasping, thigh length silk chinese dress, in the most beautiful ruby red.<br />
<br />
It felt like flowing water as she slipped into it, like it was made to fit her every curve, and she felt like a goddess in it. Well, except for one problem. Jennifer frowned at her reflection; dangling between her legs and below the hem of the dress was her cock. A thick, flat, horses cock just hanging there, ruining the otherwise perfect image of a sexy woman.<br />
Brows furrowed and biting her top lip she thought for a moment, looking down over her chest. She picked at the fabric on the front of the dress, there was a little bit of give.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Maybe it&#39;ll slip up there?&quot;, she thought, then shrugged. &quot;Worth a try&quot;. Reaching under herself she hiked up the bottom of the dress to her hip, then gathered up the dangling horsecock and began stuffing the fat, flaccid, sausage up the front of her dress. Pressed flat but curved against her shape,  she could feel the warmth of it well past her belly button. The tightness of the fabric seemed to be holding it in place.<br />
Carefully tugging down the front of the dress she straightened it and stepped back to the mirror. Now, looking front on, she looked better, no dangling monstrosity, though the outline of a cock on her dress was still visible, it hid better and was at least, somewhat less obvious.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to look so pretty!&quot; she beamed, glancing sideways she looked out the window. &quot;Oh look Dad is back chopping wood...<br />
...Oh my...&quot; Jennifer&#39;s eyes went wide and pupil&#39;s dilated. <br />
*gulp*<br />
Blood started rushing around her body, cheeks running red, and erogenous zones tingling; she bit her lip.</p>
