<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;That makes sense I guess.&quot; Dawn responds, &quot;But what are we going to do in an isolated room? Wouldn&#39;t it be better to have people to mess with?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was thinking we&#39;d just change ourselves to start, I mean, it might be fun to see what we could do.&quot; Jarred replied while eying Dawn. For her part, Dawn didn&#39;t look sure, but all the same, she went ahead. &quot;Alright, nothing too dramatic though, how about you...&quot; what she was going to suggest though, was lost to the winds of time, as Jarred interjected with his own idea, &quot;I wish Dawn had cat ears.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whu..?&quot; Exclaimed Dawn as her ears moved up her head, becoming adorable triangles in the process as fur sprouted on them. &quot;Oh this is kind of cool.&quot; Walking up to Dawn, Jarred excitedly strokes her ears, only to be disappointed as Dawn jerks away. She sheepishly looks at him and quickly apologizes, &quot;Sorry, it just... Well... It feels weird.&quot; Based on her flushed face, &quot;weird&quot; probably wasn&#39;t the right word, but Jarred wordlessly accepted the excuse, his eyes still trained on his friend. Mumbling a wish under his breath, he reached out to Dawn again with a face of possessed wonder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jarred..? Uh.. Jarred!&quot; Dawn worriedly squealed stepping backwards as the hand continued it&#39;s approach. &quot;What are you doing Jarred?!!!&quot; Backpedaling, she hit the wall as Jarred approached. Squealing, she got into a defensive position on the floor, curled up so he couldn&#39;t get to her. He paused for a moment. His outstretched hand hovered. Then he reached down and ran his hand along her back. Stroking it. Dawn&#39;s tense body immediately relaxed, and a soft motoring sound began to come from her chest. &quot;Oh, that feels good.&quot; She purred, &quot;But, but please stop.&quot; She turned her flushed face to Jarred. &quot;Please, this is embarrassing.&quot; His arm continued to move in the circular motion. Up, down, and up again. &quot;Jarred, stop!!!&quot; She was shrieking now, struggling between her obvious enjoyment and her terror at her friends behavior. Finally though, terror won out, &quot;STOP!&quot; she screamed, pushing Jarred across the room where he fell and lay still.<br />
<br />
Getting up slowly, Dawn looked carefully at Jarred, not sure whether to be worried of him, or for him. Before she got a chance to sort it out though, he groaned and pushed himself off the ground, minus the look of possession in his eyes. Dawn sighed in relief at that, and tentatively asked him, &quot;Are you ok?&quot; Looking carefully at Dawn, Jarred began to speak, &quot;Sorry. I... I.... It was just...&quot; Taking a deep breath, he continues, &quot;Dawn, I&#39;ve liked you for a long time, you&#39;re just so cute and friendly and... Well... Those ears were the last straw, I... I just had to... Well...&quot; He trailed off, looking hopefully at Dawn. She stared thoughtfully at him for a long time, before finally replying, &quot;I forgive you.&quot; Jarred&#39;s face brightens momentarily, &quot;But, I think you should know, I don&#39;t like you back, you&#39;re a good friend, but I don&#39;t want a relationship.&quot; <br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
As soon as she saw Jarred&#39;s face, she knew saying that was a mistake. Like a storm brewing, a cloud passed over his face, and it only got darker as she talked. By the end of her sentence, she didn&#39;t know whether he was lost, or furious, but she knew one thing. She was in trouble.<br />
<br />
The silence was deafening as Jarred stared at her. Then, he spoke. &quot;I wish that you would have to do whatever I tell you to.&quot; Shocked, Dawn gasped, &quot;What?!&quot; Jarred merely continued though, &quot;Don&#39;t move.&quot; He commanded, then walked up to Dawn and began stroking her back. &quot;Ooh.&quot; She purred, before regaining control. &quot;Jarred, please, stop...&quot; She said weakly before breaking down into tears. &quot;Please...&quot; Ignoring her, Jarred continued, listening to her sobbing. Then he suddenly spoke, &quot;You know why you enjoy this right? I wished for you to like being pet, like a pet. I thought you&#39;d like it. I thought it would relax you. Hah, that sure didn&#39;t work.&quot; He spat the last part bitterly, then continued, more thoughtful this time. &quot;Well, I started this, I might as well go further. I wish that you would grow fur all along your body, along with a tail. In fact, I wish you were a full cat-human hybrid. Yea, that should be good.&quot; He stepped back and watched as midnight black fur spread along her body. Around this time, she stopped crying, a stubborn look growing on her face. She kept her silence though as Jarred walked around her, watching her tail sprout.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can move again. But don&#39;t attack me.&quot; Jarred commanded. Dawn&#39;s body was released with a stumble, but she quickly recovered and crossed her arms, glaring at Jarred. &quot;Take off your clothes and hand them to me.&quot; He droned. Dawn moved with a start, her body not hers to command, and a look of horror on her face. &quot;Jarred, this is too far!&quot; She screamed. &quot;Jarred!&quot; He didn&#39;t respond though, simply stares, emotionless, as she kicks off her shoes and puts them by his feet, then pulls off her shirt and pants, leaving her in only her underwear. &quot;Stop it Jarred!&quot; Dawn shrieks, terrified as she peels off her bra and panties and tosses them to Jarred, who, with a grin and a wish, makes the clothes all disappear.<br />
<br />
Watching Dawn try to cover herself, Jarred laughs, &quot;You can&#39;t see anything with the fur anyway.&quot; Dawn stops struggling for a second, and glances at Jarred, startled, his personality seems to have changed, yet again. No longer the sociopath monster from a second ago, he seems almost like his normal self. Taking a chance, Dawn ventures a guess, &quot;So... Are we good now?&quot; she quietly murmurs, embarrassed at her current state. &quot;What? Yea, we&#39;re fine now.&quot; Jarred responds, &quot;Why wouldn&#39;t we be? Anyway, we should probably head back before Sam gets back, unless you want to stay longer of course.&quot; Stuttering over herself, Dawn says, &quot;Wait, shouldn&#39;t you change me back to normal, or at least give me clothes?&quot; The look she receives is one of absolute confusion. &quot;What? No, everyone thinks this is normal now, except for maybe our friends, they&#39;ll all give you a weird look if you have clothes! Now come on, let&#39;s head back.&quot; Compelled to listen to him, Dawn walks up to Jarred and waits to be teleported back, only hoping that her seemingly insane friend won&#39;t do anything worse.</p>
