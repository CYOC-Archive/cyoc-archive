<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Josh come on up.” I said as I pick my next victi…I mean volunteer. However at this point I might as well called Josh a victim because I hate him. Josh is the popular boy in my class and came with all the negative stereotypes associated with it. He was narcissistic which is why he volunteered because he wanted attention no matter the consequences. Also he was a ladies man cause he has been flirting with multiple girls even though he has a freshman girlfriend which thanks to my upcoming trick will free her from him. As Josh came on stage I noticed his costume and decided to comment.<br />
<br />
“Umm this is a costume party not a black tie event.” I said observing that Josh is wearing a suit and tie.<br />
<br />
“Hey don’t mock a future businessman.” Josh answered which cause me to smile on the inside on what I’m going to do to him.<br />
<br />
“Oh a businessman so what you think you’re the next Donald Trump or Elon Musk?” I jabbed.<br />
<br />
“You bet.” Josh arrogantly answered which cause me to roll my eyes.<br />
<br />
“Okay then future Mr. Trump or Mr. Musk please stand here facing me.” I instructed pointing to a spot in front of me. The audience was to my right side so if Josh stand in that spot, the audience will have a clear view of his side. Josh did as I instructed and stood on the spot I pointed.<br />
<br />
“Okay now stay there and closed your eyes.” I instructed and Josh closed his eyes. I moved to retrieve a few things, first was a cane that due to its oddly shape looked like a crank. Then I grabbed the sheet I use in the act with Jessica in one hand and walked over to Josh. I set the cane down and grabbed the sheet with both hands then toss it onto Josh.<br />
<br />
“What the heck I feel a sheet.” Josh said in a panic. “Are you going to turn me into a baby?” Josh asked.<br />
<br />
“Relaxed Josh, I will not turn you into a baby. In fact you’re heading in the opposite direction.” I said to Josh as I pick up the cane before turning to address the audience. “Now while this trick is similar to the one I perform to Jessica however in that trick I ‘compress’ Jessica. I’ll be ‘expanding’ this time instead.” I hold up the cane to show the audience.<br />
<br />
“To ‘expand’ Josh I will touching to the tip of this cane to Josh’s back and ‘crank’ it to make Josh older.” I explain to the audience and due to him hearing it, Josh calm down.<br />
<br />
“Oh that is what going to happen? Go right ahead then.” Josh said from underneath the sheet. I smiled down as took the cane by the shaft and slowly moved it forward, mentally making my wish until the tip touch his back.<br />
<br />
“That is odd well better there than the basement.” Josh commented loudly earning a chuckle from the audience.<br />
<br />
“Two should do.” I whispered as I start cranking.<br />
<br />
<b>1 Crank</b><br />
<br />
“I feel a bit strange.” Commented Josh from underneath the sheet.<br />
<br />
<b>2 Crank</b><br />
<br />
Satisfied I stopped cranking then held the cane up before tapping the tip on the ground. A glow wave emitted from the cane and engulfed the room. Confusing the audience by that, I reach out to sheet and grabbed it. I yank it off revealing Josh who despite still wearing his suit & tie, he looked older. He was a little taller and his face looked really aged. I wish up a mirror and handed it to Josh who examined himself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
“Oh my.” Josh commented as he examine himself before looking at me. “How old did you made me?” He asked me.<br />
<br />
“Let’s see, each crank added on ten years. So thirty eig…” I started speculating.<br />
<br />
“Thirty seven. I’m thirty seven years old.” Josh interrupted, I knew he was lying. Me, him, & Brad are the same age only months apart with me being the oldest and Brad younger than me by two months. So simple math of 18 add 20 equals he is simply 38 years old. Although I don’t blame him from lying, no one wanted to admit they are close to forty.<br />
<br />
“Okay. Okay.” I said trying to calm him down. “But hey you look good for someone your age. Like that actor; John Stamos.” <br />
<br />
“You’re right.” John said as he finished looking at himself in the mirror before putting the hand mirror down and turn to the audience. “What do you ladies think?” He asked giving them a wink. All the single girls blush while the ones with partners just looked away; even Gabby, however Mrs. Brockman’s face was shifting from disgust to anger then back and it didn’t go unnoticed.<br />
<br />
“Mom are you okay?” Brad asked in concerned.<br />
<br />
“I’m okay but for some strange reason I’m a bit confuse.” Answered Mrs. Brockman. “Even though I know he is a boy your age who just got older and is just flirting but I’m remembering something else.” She elaborated. I lean on the cane interested.<br />
<br />
“So you have memories of his change life. Interesting. I guess you two have interacted before.” I commented. John turn to look at me.<br />
<br />
“Wait change life?” Asked John who was no doubt confused.<br />
<br />
“Well duh. I’ve literally regress a girl to a baby, accidentally turn one into a cursed statue, race change a group of girls, turn a boy into a girl, and made you older. You honestly think when I change people I would leave loose ends; like say oh I don’t know, Gabby’s parents remembering her being a him? No when I change people, reality alters outside this mansion to accommodate so now the international cheerleaders parents match the girls race & culture or Gabby’s parents remember her as always a girl never a boy. We just remember their former lives because we’re in the epicenter.” I answered before taking a breath to continue while everyone in the room (minus Mrs. Brockman) gasps.<br />
<br />
“What? You don’t think I don’t give you guys time to regret your decisions?” I asked the audience before continuing. “We’ll get the full memories of the changes to your lives in 24 hours. Plenty of time for you all to live life in your new lives and discover who you are in these new forms before the memories set in. After 24 hours the change is permanent unless you come find me to undo it before then. Maybe Mrs. Brockman knowing you should be a hint of what your life is like John.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah I’m older but I’m hell sexy and intelligent so I’m probably super important businessman.” John said while posing. This seemed to snap something in Mrs. Brockman as her face turn to show anger full time.<br />
<br />
“You…narcissistic man whore stalker!!!” Mrs. Brockman yelled taking the audience by surprised. This also cause John to flinch.<br />
<br />
“Mom what’s wrong?” Asked Brad in fear seeing his mom so mad.<br />
<br />
“I now fully remember his form now. He has been stalking me for a month!” Growled Mrs. Brockman. This shocked John.<br />
<br />
“Stalking? That can’t be right I’m a…” John start to say.<br />
<br />
“A businessman. I know that is how we met a month ago; when the company you work for and my husband’s company held a dinner together to celebrate a new project together.” Interrupted Mrs. Brockman. “You corner me when I was going to the bathroom and try to seduced me!” This cause the rest of the audience to gasped in shock.<br />
<br />
“Dude!” Exclaim Brad in shock John hold up his hands before responding.<br />
<br />
“Whoa don’t get me wrong Brad but your mother is hot and I know better than pinning after one woman.” John started to say.<br />
<br />
“That’s right you claim to have relationships with multiple women; but I became your personal favorite to have so you’ve been for the past month setting up encounters where we run into each other. You’ve been so damn persistent that I either divorce my husband or agree to have an affair with you and said you wouldn’t stop until I was one of your partners.” Mrs. Brockman interrupted sternly. That got a more negative reaction from the audience as all the girls started booing John follow by all the man.<br />
<br />
“Okay. Okay. Stop!” Said John and on curiosity the audience stopped booing. John straighten himself up, “I can see that I’m not wanted, so I’ll leave.” He announce as he got off the stage.<br />
<br />
“Good! Also next time you try to pull your ‘encounters’ with me; you will not like the consequences.” Mrs. Brockman sternly said as he walked by.<br />
<br />
“I’ll keep that in mind but no mater. I have a good job and dozens of girls I can choose from. Good day Mrs. Brockman.” John said trying to be professional as he head out the door. As soon as it closed the audience applauded what had taken place. I just smiled as all this went down.<br />
<br />
“Wait until he finds out he is a lowly office worker and his personal life sucks.” I said causing the audience to stop applauding and turn their attention to me. “What? Don’t worry your futures and lives aren’t as bleak as his.” I said addressing the changed people in the audience. <br />
<br />
“Your futures didn’t change because of race change or gender change and your life changes aren’t <i>that</i> drastic. His life change so drastically cause he was born thirty eight years ago. His future as a thirty eight year old would have been different twenty years from now if he was born eighteen years ago; not thirty eight years ago. But now he is doom for a miserable life because he was born in the wrong century.” I said ominously before smiling and putting on a cheerful expression.<br />
<br />
“I believe folks it’s almost time to end the show so it’s time for the final trick.” I cheerfully said. “Now for the last trick just as I brought the age trick full circle, I must pull the one other trick full circle. The trick that turn Gabe into Gabby.” I said motioning towards Gabby who blush.<br />
<br />
“That’s right this last trick is a transgender one as well but instead of turning a guy into a girl; it’s going to a girl into a guy.” I said before leaning forward. <br />
<br />
“Any volunteers?” I asked and to my surprise a couple of hands shot up in response. So many to choose from.</p>
