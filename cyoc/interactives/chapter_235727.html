<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Claire pulled out her phone, expecting another random notification, but instead saw a message from one of her friends—Erika, now Eric—a girl she knew from high school. They hadn’t been particularly close in the old world, but in this new one, Eric was one of the few who seemed to enjoy sending her weird, unsolicited photos.<br />
<br />
Opening the message, Claire’s eyes widened. It was a candid shot, clearly taken in secret—a man in a short skirt bending over to pick something up, unaware that his lacy underwear was fully visible. His toned thighs, smooth and tan, were on full display, and the angle left nothing to the imagination. Claire blinked in disbelief as the accompanying text popped up:<br />
<br />
&quot;Check this out! &#128520; Isn’t he such a little tease? Couldn’t resist snapping this when he wasn’t looking, lol.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire’s stomach twisted in a mix of surprise and excitement. She knew she shouldn’t approve, but something about it felt… satisfying. The power dynamic had flipped completely. This was how men used to treat women—secret glances, inappropriate photos. Now, women could play the same game, and men were none the wiser.<br />
<br />
She stared at the photo, her mind racing. Was it wrong to feel this rush of dominance? She typed back a quick response, trying to hide her curiosity behind a veil of indifference.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, that’s wild. Men really need to watch themselves, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric replied almost immediately. &quot;Right? I swear, some of them want us to look.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire smirked at the screen, feeling a thrill shoot through her. This world was hers for the taking, and she was just beginning to understand how to use it to her advantage. Shoving her phone back into her pocket, she leaned back on the bench and looked around the park again. <br />
<br />
There were men everywhere, each of them moving through life blissfully unaware of the shift in power. She watched as they adjusted their skimpy outfits, giggling amongst themselves, ignorant of the eyes that lingered on their bodies. Claire felt a sense of satisfaction wash over her.<br />
<br />
<i>I made this world</i>, she thought. And now she could enjoy it however she wanted.<br />
<br />
With a wicked smile playing on her lips, she stood up and started walking home, already planning how she’d use her newfound power—and her friends—to have a little more fun with this twisted reality.<br />
<br />
As Claire walked home, the sun dipping lower behind the buildings, she couldn&#39;t shake the lingering thrill from Eric&#39;s message. The world she had crafted was playing out exactly as she had envisioned, but the reality of it was even more intoxicating than she imagined. Men were no longer in control, no longer walking with unchecked confidence. Instead, they were delicate, scrutinized, and vulnerable—just like Claire had once felt.<br />
<br />
Turning down a narrow alley shortcut, she spotted a group of men standing by the corner, their attention fixed on their phones, laughing quietly amongst themselves. Their outfits were just as revealing as the joggers she’d seen earlier—one of them in a tight tank top that clung to his small waist, his shorts dangerously close to exposing more than just his legs. Another was leaning against the wall in a barely-there crop top and leggings, his long lashes fluttering as he scrolled through his feed. Claire slowed her pace as she passed them, her gaze lingering longer than usual. <br />
<br />
One of the men glanced up and caught her staring. His soft blue eyes widened slightly, and he smiled, a bit shyly, tugging at the hem of his shorts as if to adjust them. Claire felt her pulse quicken, enjoying the subtle flicker of nervousness in his expression. She had never experienced this kind of power before—the ability to intimidate without saying a word, to be the one who made others squirm under her gaze.<br />
<br />
Claire paused just as she passed them, pretending to check her phone. She heard their voices lower behind her, one of them whispering something that made the others giggle again. She couldn&#39;t help but smirk, knowing that they were probably gossiping about her the way girls used to gossip about guys.<br />
<br />
Her phone buzzed again—another message from Eric.<br />
<br />
&quot;You gotta see this one &#128521;&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire hesitated for a moment before opening the message. It was another photo—this time, an even more provocative shot of a man in the locker room, his skirt hitched up as he bent over to change his shoes. His tight, thin panties barely concealed what lay beneath, and Claire felt a flicker of heat rise inside her. It was a kind of voyeurism she hadn’t anticipated enjoying so much. The thrill of seeing these men—vulnerable and unaware—was exhilarating. She bit her lip, quickly typing a reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, where do you even find these boys? Lol.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric responded almost instantly. &quot;Oh, they&#39;re everywhere. Especially at the gym. We gotta go one day. you&#39;ll love it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire could almost picture it now: the rows of treadmills and weight benches filled with slender, beautiful men, all of them sweating and working out in the most revealing gym gear, completely unaware of the eyes on them. It was a fantasy come to life. The thought alone made her want to experience it firsthand.<br />
<br />
As Claire turned onto her street, she decided she was done just watching. She needed to dive into this world more deeply. She messaged Eric back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, let&#39;s hit the gym tomorrow. I wanna see these boys for myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric&#39;s reply was immediate. &quot;Yes! You won’t regret it. Trust me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire stuffed her phone into her pocket, her mind already racing with possibilities. This new world wasn’t just a game anymore. It was a playground, and she was ready to enjoy every inch of it. Reaching her front door, she paused, staring at her reflection in the glass pane. The sharp, masculine features she had once despised now carried an edge of authority. Her flat chest and stubbled chin felt like badges of power in this world where women ruled and men submitted.<br />
<br />
Pushing the door open, she stepped inside, already planning her next move. Tomorrow was only the beginning.</p>
