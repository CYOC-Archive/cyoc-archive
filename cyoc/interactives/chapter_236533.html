<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After the last client had left the building. Silvia came knocking on Jennifer&#39;s door. Her mom leaned herself on the door frame as she had something say but occupied by the beautiful maiden she saw in front of her. Jennifer was amazed how much her mother had changed.<br />
<br />
From top to bottom her looked gorgeous. No wonder so many people kept coming here as her mother was still young looking. Even for a someone in their mid twenties she looked more younger than older. Silvia had a long messy side cut reaching down to her ass as her hairstyle with bushy and unkempt parts. She had no tattoos on her face, but there was a noticeable earlobe piercing on the buzz cut side of her hair. On her upper lip she wore two piercings on each side making them look like small cute fangs. On her neck there were a lot of red and darkened spots indicating that her clients loved to spoil her to brim with kisses. Jennifer was also reminded that her mother also a tongue piercing which only could be noticed if she kisses or sticked her tongue out in open.<br />
<br />
Also as Jennifer&#39;s eyes went lower on her mother body. It was pretty much normal at this point that her mother hated clothes and loved being naked. Jennifer somehow remember that Silvia once mentoned that she would wear them only if there&#39;s a necessity. Only things that would cover her skin were the tattoos she had gotten over the years. The recent one, at her mother&#39;s lower stomach but just above her pussy, was sticking out like a sore thumb. It was one of those asian cartoon tattoos with fancy curved lines forming a heart. Jennifer couldn&#39;t remember what it was called but it with black, rose red and dirty pink colors it was eye catching. There were also the older tattoos like the detailed black and coal gray skull between her between her upper chest, both of her arms from wrist to shoulder covered in very colorful and detailed art and last her right hip having a tally marks with a text above it saying... <br />
<br />
Jennifer had to squint her eyes as the text was warping and twisting everywhere in her vision. She could see the individual words as a picture but it made it hard to read. <br />
<br />
&#39;There&#39;s T, O and P. A space. Follower by smiling part of the smiley face, Oh and Ehmmm..? That can&#39;t be right. Oh and P with a stick a penis.&#39; Jennifer was confused as that took a lot of mental energy from her to just understand what the weird symbols meant for her. At this point her mother had started to rant about something but Jennifer didn&#39;t listen as she was too busy ogling her own mother&#39;s body. After the tattoos Jennifer&#39;s eyes noticed her mother&#39;s breast size which was massive. They could had been so big that if you saw her mother behind with a bra you could see her chest bouncing up-and-down in motion. They were so massive that you could hide a regular sized soda can inside them without anyone noticing. The humb tip sized nipple with playing card sized brown salamis around them was sight to be seen. Jennifer was sure that her mother was in that size range that if she got any bigger she would have to buy custom sizeds bras to go outside. <br />
<br />
Silvia had a bit of a chubby belly that looked unnoticeable because of her chest going over them. The only thing that would be seen was the small part of cut pubic hair and the heart tattoo. Her hips and ass had also gotten wider as years had gone by. She didn&#39;t have a hourglass figure as the chest took all the attention from her other body parts but even Jennifer knew that for an average woman in her mid twenties she had a plus one sized ass that could smother anyone&#39;s head if needed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen-ni? Earth to my sweet little baby girl.&quot; Silvia waved her hand in front of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry mom. I was just... just daydreaming and...&quot; Jennifer explained as she scratched her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are starting to act like my customers if you keep looking me like that...&quot; Silvia sighed and rubbed her cheek. &quot;Anyway. Do I need to go second time what you are supposed to do today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uuhhmm, yeah if you could, I&#39;m really sorry for not listening as I just woke-&quot; Jennifer franticly explained.<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t notice how her mother had come so close by her that she was already pulling her head towards her mouth as they both gave a lenghty tongue smootch. Jennifer&#39;s heart was pumping hard as their tongues hit together and as she pulled her lips from her mouth there was a lenghty saliva string dripping from Jennifer&#39;s lips as she sticked her tongue out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now. I think that got your attention..?&quot; Her mother smiled as Jennifer could only stare at her mother and was listening whatever she had to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. Sweety. As I explained in detail. I need you to take this wallet with twelve benjamins inside it and go to the local supermarket to pick-up all listed in this list. The next client will be here very soon and I want you to use their car to do this. We&#39;ve been there before so you should know how to get there by yourself. I explain to my client them what you are doing and... and remember if you are pulled not to drive away and behave by stopping the car when you see flashing red and blue lights. Mommy made sure that the permit is inside here. Just act normal and don&#39;t be scared or do anything rash. Okay?&quot; Silvia explained as she handed a fat wallet and a big list of groceries that she needed to buy.<br />
<br />
Jennifer was felt flabbergasted as she still thought about her mom&#39;s actions.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know that mommy loves you and does this every month all by herself for two of us and one day when you are old enough you need to know how to do these things by yourself. Mommy can&#39;t be there for you all the time.&quot; Silvia explained as she walked back to the doorframe.<br />
<br />
In the distance Silvia spotted car lights and heard it approaching in their front yard. Silvia quickly ran to her own room and came back with a small bag filled with clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh and almost forgot. Here&#39;s some mommy&#39;s old clothes for you. I gave them a wash yesterday so people don&#39;t come up with too many questions for you.&quot; Silvia giggled as she threw the clear bag of clothes in Jennifer&#39;s arms. &quot;Mommy have to go now. See you in three hours. Love ya.&quot;<br />
<br />
Silvia then slowly closed the door and walked to the front door. Jennifer could hear her mother talking with the client and as she looked at the list, the words in it were an alphabet soup. She really had to concentrate what she was reading. Spelling and whispering every word quietly as she read them.<br />
<br />
&#39;Fuck. I know I should be able to read this but somehow all these long words are just too complicated.&#39; Jennifer thought. &#39;I give it a read once I&#39;m in the supermarket.&#39;<br />
<br />
She opened the wallet and saw it truly had twelve benjamins in there. Not literally but she knew that this guy&#39;s face meant she could buy a lot of things with it. There was also a small card with a picture of Jennifer looking stern and lot&#39;s of text surrounding it. She was sure that she never had this kind of picture taken and even if she tried to recall she no memories of such event.<br />
<br />
She then stood up as she it had to be the card what her mom talked about. Next she took all her dirty clothes and put them on top of a pile of dirty clothes. Then proceeded to put on the weird smelling ones. She wasn&#39;t sure what the smell was as it just felt &#39;fresh&#39; and artificial like those sprays her mother uses when grandma was around visiting them. She was now wearing a black tanktop that was two sizes big for her. Or maybe it was a blouse but who knew at this point. She also had Short shorts, long thigh high socks and running shoes that were just the right size for her. Lastly she wore the black plain bra and black velvet panties underneath everything. There also were a pair of cheap almost broken sunglasses and a cap with something written on it. She put the cap on and hanged the sunglasses on top of the tanktop.<br />
<br />
As soon as her mother and her client begun to do their thing. Jennifer exited the front door with the wallet tucked inside her short short&#39;s pocket. Outside of the house was a pick-up truck with a door fully open. As Jennifer approached it she saw it had keys attached next to the steering wheel. Jennifer was getting anxious as she had no idea how to operate a thing like this but soon remembered that her mother had given her basic driving lessons in empty parking lots as she had &#39;borrowed&#39; their clients cars to do shopping. Jennifer let out a small chuckle as she remembered her mother Silvia telling how grandma Mary got upset when she would also learn to drive at her age all by herself. Jennifer also heard from her mother that grandma Mary wasn&#39;t too happy when she actually learned to drive and go her license so quickly and without a hassle. Still to this day Jennifer being oblivious what the heck was a license and why grandma Mary got so upset to her mother. Jennifer thought driving was easy if they only build cars more to her size.<br />
<br />
Jennifer then hopped inside the truck and was amazed how natural it felt. She felt a bit big for her own taste but she could reach down to the gas pedal while steering the wheel just fine if she sat in a half standing position. Her body would hug the steering wheel most of the time but if she was quick she could do this. The drive wasn&#39;t a long one either as the supermarket was only twenty five minutes away. She started the engine and let the automatic car do most of the work as she slowly curved from the grassy road towards the asphalt hell.</p>
