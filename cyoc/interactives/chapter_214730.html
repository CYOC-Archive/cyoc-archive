<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen couldn&#39;t believe her eyes as she came to a halt in front of Kyle. And to her further surprise, Kyle immediately began apologizing to her profusely. It was too embarrassing of a display to not be sincere as well, which confused Jen to no end. <br />
<br />
Once her Mother finally removed her bit, Jen asked the question she has had ever since Kyle started begging for forgiveness. &quot;Um, sorry if this is off topic but... what&#39;s that smell?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle looked up at Jen and turned deep, deep red in the face while his hands shot around to behind his lower back. &quot;N-nothing. But again, I am so, so sorry for cursing you like this. Can you ever forgive me?&quot;<br />
<br />
But Jen was not listening. Something smelled and it was strong at that. Her full focus was now on this strangely addictive scent. She took a step forwards and bent over to sniff Kyle&#39;s shirt. The scent was much stronger. She continued to sniff around his body, but he started being difficult and refused to let her sniff his back side. This upset Jen, but with bound hands, she couldn&#39;t do much but try and out maneuver him, which wasn&#39;t possible with the size of her balls. But she now was certain that the scent was definitely coming from Kyle&#39;s backside. <br />
<br />
And that&#39;s when she was given the golden opportunity. Kyle&#39;s Mom walked out and told Kyle to show the Smith&#39;s &quot;horse&quot; around their ranch. Jen celebrated as this would mean she would get to follow behind Kyle. Kyle tried to protest, but was scolded and made to do it with the threat of going back into the barn if he didn&#39;t. <br />
<br />
Kyle gave in and began the tour. It took all of 10 seconds for Jen to take advantage of the situation and shoved her head up against Kyle&#39;s ass. Her brain lit up like fireworks as the scene&#39;s source was found. There was something about Kyle&#39;s crotch. Something she had to get for herself. So she bit down on his shorts hard, and yanked them back, literally tearing them off of his body in one go. <br />
<br />
Kyle was more stunned than anything, which cost him his chance to run. Jen had already found her target. Buried between his legs and facing backwards, was a fully functional mare pussy. And Jen just knew somehow that Kyle was also very much in heat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, so that&#39;s what it was. I get it now. You&#39;re a mare now, aren&#39;t you Kyle?&quot; Asked Jen with an amused look. Kyle&#39;s facade just collapsed in that moment, and he just let everything out. &quot;Yeah. I am. I have a female horse&#39;s entire reproduction system. And yeah, I am so badly in heat right now. I need to be impregnated Jen. And my parents... they just won&#39;t let me. I can&#39;t take it anymore. I need you to fuck me, please Jen. Breed me. I want your baby so much it hurts!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen may be spiteful, but she wasn&#39;t cold hearted. And despite their rough relationship. She didn&#39;t exactly hate Kyle, as she sort of started to kind of like her current body during the trip over. So, Jen explained how she needed Kyle to unwind her hands, which he did right away. <br />
<br />
Jen then grabbed him and forced him to turn his ass towards her and shoved one of her rapidly growing erections into his pussy. He was pretty tight but she still managed to fit it in as much as she could. Kyle cried in relief and pain, but that pain turned to pleasure as he adjusted his posture in order to better take the massive cock. <br />
<br />
Once Jen came inside of him, she pushed him off of her and began masturbating the other 5 cocks to their climax as well. Once all was said and over with. Kyle, who had stayed around and watched Jen finish getting herself off, helped return her hands back into their bindings, per her own request. She found it far easier to move around without having to worry about getting hard.<br />
<br />
Jen also noticed that unlike her, Kyle didn&#39;t have horse ears or horseshoes on his feet. &quot;So why did you change anyways?&quot; Asked Jen out of curiosity. <br />
<br />
&quot;Poor wording. When I made it so that people would see you as normal, the curse took it as making it appear normal, because you wouldn&#39;t be the only one it happens to. And so, I happened to see my family&#39;s mare and the next thing I know, I have her for my pussy and I am now doing her work in her absence. What about you though?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rodeo. I became the main event. 6 horses, one girl. Now I am some kind of super horse for my family or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No kidding. How did you even manage to pull that wagon all by yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have 6 horsepower. That much is nothing for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I see... that&#39;s still impressive. But what about the... ears?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You tell me. They just appeared. I have no idea why.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, maybe it was due to absorbing so many horses?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who knows. I don&#39;t really mind them though. And I have gotten used to the shoes as well. They are really nice to have. You should get a pair for yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle was a bit confused, but then noticed the bit of metal poking out from underneath Jen&#39;s feet. &quot;Holy shit! You have horseshoes on your feet. Doesn&#39;t it hurt? They normally nail them right into the hoof.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;These use glue I guess. Really good glue too. Though the metal also holds onto the sides just as well. It looks worse than it is, and they are very comfortable too. I can walk on any surface and have no issues.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That may just be a you thing. I can still walk on my entire foot afterall.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? I can&#39;t even touch my heels to the ground anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Meh, don&#39;t be. I like it. Weird right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kinda, yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will admit that it isn&#39;t all good, but so far there isn&#39;t really anything too annoying. Though I do think I will miss going to school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s going to be an issue though. I never said you couldn&#39;t after all. You do horse work, but you are also still a student. So you probably still have to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, maybe that&#39;s true. I wonder how different things will be though. Like who else was changed and such.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if it helps, I know one of your friends is changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who? And how?&quot;</p>
<hr/><h3>
Which one of Jen&#39;s friends changed, and how?</h3>
