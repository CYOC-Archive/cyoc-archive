<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The friends gathered around Hank as he moved his piece, except for John who was left alone on the bed, much to his disdain. Hank stopped on a space with a large question mark. &quot;A special space...&quot; Bob muttered under his breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Is that good or bad?&quot; Hank asked as nobody had bothered to explain the rules to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t know. Nobody&#39;s landed on it yet...&quot; Jack replied, reaching for the guidebook. He flicked it open and read aloud. &quot;It says a random physical or mental change will occur that can affect any amount of players. Just look into the black circle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hank leaned over and peered at the void in the centre of the board. He squinted at the glowing text floating in the middle. &quot;Generation Switcharoo&quot; he read out, before sitting up and asking &quot;What the hell does that mean?&quot; before letting out a loud burp.<br />
<br />
Everyone stared at Hank as a peculiar feeling overcame him, like a weight was being lifted off his shoulders. He instinctively clutched his belly, feeling it shake and gurgle. Looking down, his eyes widened as he watched his round gut decrease in girth with every short breath. Something really was happening! He laughed as that tingle spread to his scalp. Cautiously, Hank brought a hand to his head and nearly shouted in surprise. Rough bristles of hair were sprouting all over. Follicles were even reappearing where they&#39;d long since vanished. Hank leapt from his seat and darted to the mirror, seeing a man he hadn&#39;t seen in almost a decade. His hair was still growing back, thicker than ever and restoring his hairline to its former glory. His goatee had regained its former auburn colouring to match his short hairdo. His skin looked refreshed with nary a wrinkle in sight. Hank yanked on his thick hair, cringing at the pain he inflicted. This wasn&#39;t a dream, he truly was ageing backwards! He wasn&#39;t going crazy, this was real!<br />
<br />
As everyone stared at the increasingly younger man, Jack piped up in a cracking voice &quot;Uhm guys? Something&#39;s happening to me too...&quot; Everyone turned to see Jack was no longer 9 years old. He was growing up himself, already in the midst of puberty. Growth spurts were stretching him out like taffy while an acne outbreak erupted across his face. He gulped loudly as his Adam&#39;s apple abruptly jutted out from his throat.<br />
<br />
Ellis was the first to put things together. &quot;Ajá, I got it! You&#39;re both becoming each other&#39;s age, so Hank is the son and Jack is the dad! Qué suerte la tuya...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack looked overjoyed. Finally, the game was working in his favour! He jumped off the bed and joined his dad by the mirror, just as his acne outbreak subsided. He watched as his face lost its boyish charm, sculpting into a bold, rectangular jaw. He noticed that his blond hair had darkened to more of a sandy brown, while a smattering of dark blond stubble sparsely covered his face. Seeing that his T-shirt had morphed into a sleeveless muscle shirt, Jack didn&#39;t waste any time yanking it off to check out his toned body. A patch of hair was starting to sprout across his hard chest while a thin treasure trail surrounded his belly button and dove down into his jeans.<br />
<br />
As the two men sized up to each other, their ages suddenly flipped. Hank knew he was now younger than Jack when he realised he had lost all his muscle mass. He was a skinny guy with soft, pretty-boy features until he began college and dedicated himself to the gym. Jack, on the other hand had only gotten broader as he swelled with brawny muscle. Jack himself realised he was now the oldest when Hank&#39;s goatee vanished. His facial hair had all but faded away along with the majority of his body hair, while his hair had grown several inches into thick, wavy locks. Jack had a short, dense beard that only seemed to get larger as he continued to age through his twenties. As his beard grew longer, his hair considerably shortened in response. Curly, dark blonde hairs swirled around his meaty pecs, down across his six pack, and up to his shoulder blades. <br />
<br />
From here on out, the changes sped up. Hank went through a reverse puberty, shrinking down in quick bursts until he had to stand on tiptoes to properly look in the mirror. Jack always told him he&#39;d hung the mirror too high... Hank hopped onto the stool in front of him and gaped as his adult features faded away. His angular jawline rounded out and softened as baby fat made his cheeks chubby. He felt a little sombre as his prominent Adam&#39;s Apple shrunk away from view. Even more-so as he felt his cock shrivel up and his testicles pop back up into his crotch. As he lost another inch in height, Hank was now indistinguishable from any other 9 year old boy.<br />
<br />
Jack continued to age through his thirties. More body hair sprouted up his lower back, while some spilled over his shoulders to his upper back. His hairline rapidly receded across the entirety of his scalp, the shedding hair vanishing from existence. In a matter of seconds, his head was as hair-free as Hank&#39;s once was. To compensate, his beard kept growing wilder and longer until his neck was completely obscured. He gained more bulk, his pecs and arms swelling to mammoth proportions. However, his abs eventually vanished as his midsection softened and his waist thickened. To top it off, fine wrinkles crept out from the corner of his eyes and across his enlarged forehead to give him a weathered demeanour. He looked several years older than his actual 37 years of age.<br />
<br />
As their changes came to an end, Hank felt wistful. Seeing himself as a child again was surreal to say the least. He was an average schoolboy with a few missing teeth and a messy mop of brown hair. In fact, if his hair were any lighter, he would be virtually indistinguishable from his son at the same age. His work clothes had morphed into a colourful T-shirt and a pair of baggy shorts. He&#39;d forgotten what it was like to be so short and vulnerable. Everything around him was gigantic, even if all his son&#39;s furniture was now sized for him. Everyone in the room, aside from John for obvious reasons, towered over him. He looked across to Jack in awe, was this what he looked like to his son? So huge and goliath-like? It was eye-opening indeed. <br />
<br />
Jack took his time to inspect his body. He was a strong, stocky man with a shiny bald head and a shaggy, dirty blond beard that brushed across his broad chest, tickling his nipples when he moved his head. A scattering of grey hairs sprinkled throughout, giving it a duller tone. More hair coated the rest of his body, darker than his beard and leaving him very fuzzy. The feeling of his beard and chest hair mingling as he scratched his meaty pecs was just as surreal as the absence of hair when he swept a large mitt over his naked scalp. After discovering the large bulge in his pants and recalling Paul&#39;s experience growing up, he gave himself a subtle grope. He was relieved to feel no metal ring, yet intrigued to find his cock was considerably larger than his hand. Taking in his overtly manly body, Jack smirked in triumph. This was everything he wanted to experience when playing this game and more. <br />
<br />
As the others watched the two examining themselves, Bob found himself staring at the new boy with curiosity. He leaned over and whispered to Ellis &quot;He looks so much like Jack, it&#39;s unnerving...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ellis nodded his head and muttered &quot;Si si, I guess that&#39;s family for you. But what&#39;s really unnerving is how macho Jack looks. He&#39;s like the God of War guy, but super hairy...&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul watched in awe as Jack continued to check out the goods, even ignoring baby John&#39;s desire to continue the game. &quot;Wow Jack&quot; he sighed, &quot;you&#39;re like a muscley version of your dad. You&#39;re even bald like him, what&#39;s it like?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack grinned and rubbed the back of his head, a tingle going down his spine as he felt bare skin. His deep voice rumbled as he sheepishly said &quot;It&#39;ll take some getting used to but I like it. Dad&#39;s been bald for as long as I&#39;ve been alive. I remember him telling me I would lose it too, and he was right!&quot;<br />
<br />
Hank spoke up in his newly high-pitched voice. &quot;That&#39;s right, my hair started thinning before I hit 30. I&#39;ve been shaving it ever since. Or until it grew back a few minutes ago...&quot; he said, reminiscing over a time where he was actually older than he was currently. Looking up at his son&#39;s head, he added &quot;Actually Jack, I think you&#39;re balder than I was&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack snorted and said &quot;Uhm, I think I&#39;m the exact same bald as you were. See?&quot; He pointed to his head, which was as smooth as a bowling ball, then gave it a rub all round for good measure. &quot;Completely gone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hank smiled at his son&#39;s nonchalance over losing his hair. If only he had that kind of attitude. He explained &quot;Well yeah, you have a shaved head like I did. But if you look closely at the stubble pattern... Sit down&quot; Hank pointed to the bed. Jack obliged, squatting down onto the mattress. Hank clamoured on and got behind him, grasping Jack&#39;s shoulders so he could keep his balance. He knew he was small now, but seeing this furry mountain up close really put things into perspective. He stretched up and placed his tiny hands on Jack&#39;s scalp, slowly rubbing the surface like he was reading a crystal ball.<br />
<br />
Jack squirmed a little. If it was odd to feel his bald head with his own hands, it was downright peculiar to feel someone else&#39;s fingers dancing across his bare scalp. It felt almost ticklish. &quot;Mmmm, dad..?&quot; he mumbled quietly.<br />
<br />
After a few moments, Hank sharply declared &quot;Aha, I knew it! I still had this strip of hair growing across the top that I had to shave along with the sides. You, however, have absolutely nothing up top, it&#39;s smooth as anything.&quot; Hank took Jack&#39;s hand and placed it across the top of his head before sliding it further and further back until he stopped at the very back of his head where the texture changed from sleek to slightly grainy. &quot;You have complete male pattern baldness, son. I&#39;m a little impressed!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack flushed, a little taken aback. &quot;Thanks? I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s something to be proud of though...&quot; He knew he would be going bald by his dad&#39;s age but to lose all of his hair before his dad did? That felt different.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooh, I wanna feel your head!&quot; Paul exclaimed, reaching over before Jack could react and slapping a large hand on top of his head. &quot;Heehee, it feels so funny...&quot; he giggled.<br />
<br />
Jack was annoyed, but also felt weird inside. That ticklish feeling came back, made more intense by Paul&#39;s larger, calloused hands. The way Paul caressed his scalp made him feel good, real good... He closed his eyes and bit the side of his lip lightly before a guttural moan escaped his lips. He covered his mouth immediately, embarrassed by the noise he&#39;d unintentionally made.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe lay off the head rubbing there, lad&quot; Hank said, tugging Paul away from Jack. He looked back at his adult son and said &quot;It can be overstimulating if you&#39;re not careful&quot; with a knowing wink. Jack raised a bushy eyebrow, wondering if his dad ever had a similar reaction to a head massage. He became acutely aware of how hard his cock was. It pressed tight against his jeans, raring for release.<br />
<br />
There was a small cry from the other side of the room. John waved his stubby arms about and babbled in an annoyed tone. He jabbed towards the board game, and then at himself. &quot;I think he&#39;s saying it&#39;s his turn to roll&quot; Paul said before sweeping his baby big brother up off the bed and carrying him over to the table.<br />
<br />
With the fourth round officially over, John was a literal cry baby at 1 years old, Paul had become a rugged and dad-bodded 40 year old, Ellis jumped back to adulthood at 19 years old, Bob was a little younger, also at 19 years old, Jack almost returned to 9 years old until his dad interrupted the game. Now Jack was a buff, bald and bearded 37 year old, while his dad Hank had returned to his childhood at 9 years old.</p>
