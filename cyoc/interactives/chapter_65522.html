<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Shou Tucker was in an abandoned building, a place where no one would think to look for him.<br />
<br />
He had transmuted his daughter into a chimera just to keep his job, but now, older, wiser, and worse for wear, all he wanted was to make it <br />
right by bringing his daughter back to life.<br />
<br />
He had already gotten this far with the Philosopher's stone, but his will wasn't strong enough to attach her soul to this body.<br />
<br />
(Note: this takes place after the F.M.A. movie that concluded the series)<br />
<br />
Without it, he knew it would be much harder - especially with the Elric Brothers on the other side of The Gate, for he had kept up with current <br />
events.<br />
<br />
Still, he had lost everything - this lifeless doll was all he had left, and all that mattered to him now was giving it life - if for no other reason <br />
other than to atone for all the bad, thoughtless things he'd done!<br />
<br />
He had heard the various accounts of other people trying what he was about to do, and that all these ended in grotesque failures - creating <br />
homunculi in the process.<br />
<br />
He knew the risks, and the warnings against it, but he had nothing else to live for at this point, so he didn't care - as long as he could get his <br />
beloved daughter back.<br />
<br />
So he put some clothes on her, put her in the middle of the circle, marked his non-human parts (he felt that trading them for his daughter's <br />
soul would be a fair enough equivalent exchange), and activated it.<br />
<br />
In a flash of light, he found himself at The Gate. It opened, revealing all those Gate Children, their black, baby-like faces smiling sinisterly, and <br />
Tucker fell on his knees and begged with tears streaming down his up-side-down face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please,&quot; he cried in anguish &quot;give her back - my daughter - Nina - please give her back to me!!! I know I don't deserve her after all I've done, <br />
and I've failed countless times, but please, just this once, have mercy. Take away from me all that isn't human, and in exchange, give me my <br />
daughter's soul - put it in the body I made for her - PLEASE! I'M BEGGING YOU!!! I'll never ask you for anything again if you just do this one <br />
thing for this poor, wretched man!&quot;<br />
<br />
The Gate Children were silent, them reached out and put their small, black hands on his non-human parts.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're funny.&quot; one said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You really think you can trade us these parts for her?&quot; another continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well, you'll get her back alright,&quot; a third one said.<br />
<br />
&quot;but you might end up wishing you hadn't,&quot; a forth said with an evil smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;and if you do, then don't blame us,&quot; a fifth said.<br />
<br />
&quot;but blame your own selfish self instead!!!&quot; a sixth said with a look of evil insanity.<br />
<br />
The next thing Tucker knew, everything went black, and the last thing he heard before lost consciousness, was the wicked laughter of the Gate <br />
Children.<br />
<br />
When he woke up, he was back in the building, wearing his lab clothes, with a perfectly normal body.<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks like they accepted them.&quot; he said to himself &quot;I may have to examine myself further to make sure they didn't take any more than I asked <br />
them to, but that can wait. For now .... Nina ..... do I dare even look at her? What if I made another mistake - but no! This has to work - they <br />
said they'd give her back to me. Alright, here goes.&quot;<br />
<br />
He slowly turned around to see her lying there. She still looked the same - she looked perfectly normal, and still had that lifeless look in her <br />
eyes. Did it work? Did he succeed? He rushed over to her side. &quot;Nina,&quot; he asked afraid &quot;is that you? Are you there? Have you come back to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
She didn't answer, but continued to stare blankly at the ceiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;I knew it,&quot; he said sadly &quot;I asked for too much! Why did I think this would work, when nothing else in my life has?&quot;<br />
<br />
Then he got down on the floor, and started crying in his folded arms. &quot;I suppose it's for the best,&quot; he said to himself &quot;I mean if she really did <br />
come back, what would she say to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
While he was crying he heard a soft, gentle voice &quot;Daddy?&quot;<br />
<br />
He slowly lifted his head to see her face - still staring at the ceiling with the same look in her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nina?&quot; he asked, a bit nervous.<br />
<br />
Very slowly, her head turned to face him. She still looked the same - no emotion, soulless eyes, but she was staring at HIM with that look now!<br />
<br />
&quot;Nina,&quot; he asked &quot;Is that really you?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; she said, emotionlessly.<br />
<br />
Tucker was happy, but what he didn't know was that during all that time inside The Gate, she had accumulated a vast amount of knowledge - <br />
more than Edward had when he visited, so she could perform transmutation without a circle, and could now do all that Wrath was capable of <br />
and more - she could fuse with anything or anyone, and then separate to make it as if it never happened. She had full knowledge of alchemy, <br />
and of the world beyond The Gate. She was now mentally linked with her counter-part on Earth - the two girls now shared the same, exact <br />
mind - she could see whatever her Earth self saw, and vica-versa. They also shared all their memories. Both had the regenerative properties of <br />
a homunculus, but weren't ones themselves, and their ability to age had been taken away in exchange for all this knowledge and power, so <br />
neither of them could die (they'd be 8 forever), and she was fully aware of all this!<br />
<br />
Most importantly, she was fully aware of everything bad her father had done - especially to her and her mom, and she knew that her father had <br />
brought her back, and why he did it, but real question is, as she stares at her father blankly with those lifeless eyes, can she find it in her heart <br />
(which just started beating again) to forgive her father for all the bad things he did?</p>
