<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan's head turned to the right, and saw Josh.  His mouth hung open, and he slowly looked down to see their fused bodies.  He wasn't sure what was going on. &quot;J-J-Josh! What the hell?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh smiled, and started to walk over to where his little couch was.  He took it really slow, seeing how Dan was brand new to the conjoined body.  &quot;Come on, let's finish our Halo co-op we had going.&quot;  Dan made a face, but followed along, not having much choice in the matter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, Josh?&quot; Dan was looking down at them again, while his friend set up the t.v and game.  He was handed a controller and looked at his friend.  Josh looked back at him with a puzzled look on his face.  Dan had a few questions he wanted to ask.  Like why they were all of a sudden a two headed guy, and what was going on, but the only thing he could ask was, &quot;How can we finish our co-op game?  We only have one hand each.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit, you're right!&quot;  Josh stood them up again, and they walked over to place Josh's controller by the t.v.  They had quickly become accustomed to being fused, and strolled back to the couch to sit.  Josh took the other half of Dan's controller in his hand, &quot;Well, we'll still play co-op.  Just, under single player I guess.&quot;  They both chuckled, and started their game.<br />
<br />
At first they were getting nowhere.  Dan would run where and when Josh didn't want to, and Josh would aim and shoot while Dan turned.  But after beating the first and second level after an hour, they were starting to get the hang of it.  They were cruising through, and got about half way, when Josh saved the game and motioned for them to stand.  They went into the bathroom, and stood over near the toilet.  They gave each other a funny look, knowing full well that they had to pee, but didn't say anything.  They fumbled around with the belt that Dan had worn when they had become joined, and undid their jeans.  They glanced at each one more time, before Josh reached down and pulled out their dick.  Even as they did their business, they still remained silent.<br />
<br />
They redid their pants and belt, and started to wash their hands, which was extremely hard, before Josh spoke up, &quot;That was kinda weird.  I didn't know we were sharing a dick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stands to reason.&quot;  Dan looked at their reflection and shrugged, &quot;I mean, two heads, one body.  Doesn't surprise me.&quot;  They had made their way back to Josh's room, and sat down again.  This time they watched some t.v and shifted around till they were comfortable.  Josh didn't really care about what they were watching.  He was more interested in one of the actresses that he thought looked hot.  Without even thinking about it his hand slid under the front of his jeans, and he started playing with himself.  Dan didn't notice at first.  He was also watching her, and thought it was himself doing it.  But as they started getting hard he looked over to his right, and remembered that he and Josh were fused.  &quot;Uh, Josh?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, wha?&quot; Josh was snapped back to reality, and looked at his friend.  Dan pointed to their crotch, and Josh followed his gaze.  He felt himself turn red and look back at his friend, &quot;Oh fuck, sorry, I forgot! And well... she's kinda hot.  And usually there's no one around!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan start laughing, &quot;It's ok man, I just wanted to make sure you were doing it for the right reason.  I would be doing the same.&quot;  There was an awkward silence now that they had started watching the show again.  The next scene had the same girl, but this time at the beach and she was in a bikini.  Their dick twitched, and Dan rubbed the back of his neck.  &quot;You know... We already went to the bathroom with it...  So why not?&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh had to clear his throat, &quot;Really?&quot;  Dan nodded slowly and had a bit of a smile.  Josh looked back at the screen, then to Dan, &quot;We keep this between us.  Don't tell anyone, ever.  Ok?&quot;  Dan was grinning from ear to ear now, and gave Josh a thumbs up.  Josh took a breathe and slid his hand down their jeans again.</p>
