<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>So, interestingly, this is the number one punishment. Thanks for voting!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tex circled him, holding the Book, clearly in deep contemplation.<br />
<br />
“Penny for your thoughts?” Troy asked.<br />
<br />
“Well…I can do a lot of things. But what you need is some way to somehow relate to other people so you truly understand what you’ve done. I could turn you into my personal sex doll…but what does that do? It feels great!”<br />
<br />
“Oh.”<br />
<br />
“No.” Tex narrowed his eyes and nodded to himself. “No, I think there’s only two things I could do that would make a lasting impression. Possibly three. I’m going to make a phone call and ask permission.”<br />
<br />
“Wait, what?” Troy protested but Tex had already disappeared into the office.<br />
<br />
He waited. Five minutes passed. Ten. Then he heard a scuffle in the office.<br />
<br />
Troy turned just time to see Tex point his way and mouth something from behind the little glass window in the door of the office.<br />
<br />
“Wait, Tex-” Troy noticed his fur changing, becoming thicker and longer, medium-length. “You didn’t say what you were changing me into!”<br />
<br />
Tex opened the door and stepped back into the warehouse. Lenny walked in behind him, the black bear’s clawed hands on his officer’s belt. He surveyed Troy, whose hands were bulking up, his nails elongating into dangerous claws. <br />
<br />
Troy’s body swelled, muscles becoming huge and bulky. Memories flood his mind, most of them involving Lenny in his childhood. Trey blinked, ears rounding as they became more bear like. Why-why was he thinking about Lenny? But the more he stared at the bear across from him, the more familiar he became. He remembered being in school with Lenny, sleeping in the same room as him, having the exact same tastes.<br />
<br />
He shook his head. “I’m…what…”<br />
<br />
“Your punishment, Benny.” Lenny shrugged. “Sorry bro.”<br />
<br />
Benny? Who was-Treny’s spine popped and lengthened as he grew taller, shoulders flexing and widening. His beer gut now seemed more like a musclegut. His heart was pounding as he realized the memories were replacing him. He tried to think about his mother and father but they were Lenny’s parents, not his! Because, of course, they were his. Lenny was his brother after all.<br />
<br />
“No!” Trenny gasped.<br />
<br />
“Calm down Benny.” Tex said.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, I’m just…natural defense mechanism.” Trenny panted, trying to calm his rapidly beating heart.<br />
<br />
“Losing your self is terrifying.” Tex shrugged. “Let go.”<br />
<br />
Trenny took a deep breath and nodded, trying to relax and let the thoughts in. He deserved this and he’d be fine. The memories surged back.<br />
<br />
They weren’t just brothers, they were identical twins, absolutely inseparable since childhood and all the through college. Tenny remembered their graduation and the prank they played on Mom and Dad as they were identical in every way-more so than most twins. They were more like clones. Likes, dislikes, favorite foods, favorite colors. They even joined the police force together.<br />
<br />
Benny’s clothing shifted, his jacket and jeans shifting into a policeman’s uniform. A proper belt buckled itself around his ample waist and training filled his mind. Troy had mostly ceased to exist now, though it didn’t bother him. He had a brother he loved and a boyfriend that loved him. Benny smiled happily at his stony faced twin.<br />
<br />
Then the final memories flooded in. Benny hadn’t wanted to be a bear, he wanted to be a crocodile. It was the first time they’d ever disagreed on something. Lenny’s wife-another sticking point-had pushed him to choose bear. Benny had to choose bear as well…because he loved his brother.<br />
<br />
Worse, Benny had been more open and accepting of his sexuality than Lenny had. He knew Lenny was closeted-they’d experimented with each other after all. That’s why Benny had altered Lenny in this reality-he wanted to share Rusty with him. But something had gone wrong. Instead of just being bisexual as he’d intended, Lenny had becoming fully gay.<br />
<br />
Benny sighed regretfully and relaxed. Things got out of hand. Lenny stopped coming home in time for dinner, began going to the gym. Benny stayed on his patrols. The final physical shift happened then, as one extra centimeter of flab covered him. There was exactly a twenty pound difference between them physically now.<br />
<br />
The final memories hit, then. Benny was now no longer able to help Rusty or Lenny because he’d been told to ‘take some time off and reflect’ by the police chief.  His actions had caused a scandal and witnesses were demanding the department fire him. Benny was probably going to lose his job or at the very least tarnish his career because witnesses had seen him cause so much damage.<br />
<br />
“So what did you change?” Benny asked, running his hands over his heavy body, checking his belt to insure all items were in place. He looked up and saw Lenny’s hand on the Book. He remembered the awkward ride here, his brother asking to never see him again. &quot;My paw isn&#39;t on the Book like yours is.&quot;<br />
<br />
“I changed your DNA and physical age to absolutely match Lenny’s. You’re less a twin and more an exact clone.” Tex eyed his work critically. “You weren’t brothers before. Oh, and, not a bear either.”<br />
<br />
“Why would you do that?” Benny stared, eyes darting between his…brother?…And the big bull man standing next to him. “A sex toy is an easier change on reality. Paradox could shift us into this permanently!”<br />
<br />
“Because becoming a sex doll wasn’t personal enough.” Lenny shrugged, “I wanted you to understand me completely.”<br />
<br />
“No one knows if you changed them because they wanted you to or if you wanted to. I saw how you handled Todd earlier.” Tex added.<br />
<br />
“Wait, Todd was some kind of test?” Benny shrugged. “Yeah, I’ve decided to do right.”<br />
<br />
“Then why did you alter his memories as having always worked for you?” Lenny demanded. &quot;That’s a reality shift neither you nor he have any control over. He’s new in town, how do you know he didn’t arrive that day? How is he supposed to be here since last week? You keep complaining about Reality Auditors and then cause Paradox because you’re too lazy to train him?”<br />
<br />
“You guys are acting like I intended any of this!” Benny shook an ursine claw at Tex. “And I am fixing things!”<br />
<br />
“You never asked if I was okay after I got turned into a teddy bear.” Lenny said quietly. “And you don’t even really care that my relationship with my wife is platonic. All I can think about is Rusty’s dick, and I have to share that too.”<br />
<br />
Benny was silent. Of course, having lived the events of Lenny’s life, he could tell that to him, he must seem like a bad guy. A jealous, horny mess of a bear that always put his own needs first. It had never occurred to him that the experimenting they did in high school and college had just been that-experimenting. Instead he’d forced a new sexuality on his brother.<br />
<br />
Lenny strode forward and stood close...too close to Benny for his comfort, hot ursine breath now tickling his nsout. He reached forward and undid Benny’s uniform, unbuckled his belt, pulled own his pants. Benny squirmed but didn’t move, breath quickening.<br />
<br />
“B-bro?” Benny moaned. “What are you doing?”<br />
<br />
“What you secretly want, Troy.” Lenny whispered in his ear.<br />
<br />
Troy. The name send a weird shiver down Benny’s spine. Familiar yet unfamiliar. Had that been his old name?<br />
<br />
Benny gasped as Lenny got down on his knees and took Benny’s ursine cock in hand. Tex stood a few feet away, watching the brothers. Lenny&#39;s long tongue wrapped around his dick and then his muzzle reeled his cock into it, engulfed the full length. Benny relaxed and let his brother suck and bob, up and down. He knew it was wrong, they were brothers, but god could Lenny suck a dick. His eyes rolled back into his head and his claws clenched at each bob. Benny felt his orgasm welling up, Lenny&#39;s tender ministrations bringing him to the edge- <br />
<br />
Lenny flipped Benny over.<br />
<br />
“Wait, this-!” Benny protested.<br />
<br />
“Is what I want.” Lenny grinned and lubed up his twin’s asshole with a cool dollop of lube. &quot;Let&#39;s get this over with quick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Benny bit back a groan of frustration as his brother’s thick throbbing cock circled his hole. Lenny growled, bit down on the back of his neck like he was some bear bitch, then plunged in with one well-practiced thrust. Benny grunted as Lenny clapped his cheeks, smacking his prostate over and over. It was like they were made for each other. Benny leaned into the fuck, squeezing and clenching his hole around the thickly veined invader. One paw strayed to his dick and he started jerking himself to the rythym.<br />
<br />
The fuck was hot and quick. They panted, Benny huffing their identical sweat and musk. Fake brother or lowkey lover, it didn&#39;t matter. He only had one thing left to say.<br />
<br />
“I love you.” Benny whispered, fist pumping his own cock. He was close.<br />
<br />
“I know you do Troy.” Lenny grunted, then gripped Benny&#39;s hips and thrust deep with a roar. He came inside Benny, flooding his insides with warmth. “And I love you too. But let’s fix this first.”<br />
<br />
The warmth of his brother&#39;s cum filling his insides sent Benny over the edge. His cock cock spasmed hard, spurting cum on the pre-slicked floor. He panted happily. <br />
<br />
Lenny cleaned himself and zipped his pants back up. Benny rolled over and picked up his uniform. They sat in silence.<br />
<br />
“Okay, how do I fix this?” Benny asked after a minute.<br />
<br />
“How am I like this in the first place?” Lenny shrugged. “Undo it.”<br />
<br />
“Rusty said RK had walked him through it.” Benny swallowed. “I never used the Book, man, I swear.”<br />
<br />
“RK?” Lenny glanced at Tex.<br />
<br />
Tex nodded. “I’ll call him. But first, the final punishment begins.”<br />
<br />
“What?” Benny asked, and then saw that Lenny hadn’t move his hand from the Book. <br />
<br />
Tex pointed at Benny and Lenny and mouthed something under his breath Benny couldn’t quite catch-<br />
<br />
Lenny staggered, hand sliding off the book. He looked down at himself and then at Tex.<br />
<br />
“No!”<br />
<br />
Tex nodded. “Yes. Go home and be with your wife and kids, Lenny.”<br />
<br />
Lenny shook his head, as though trying to block out memories. Benny watched the whole thing play out, confused. What had Tex done?<br />
<br />
“Uh, what am I supposed to do?” Benny asked.<br />
<br />
“Go home and enjoy your time with Rusty.” Tex said. “I swapped you.”<br />
<br />
Benny blinked and stepped forward, placing a clawed paw on the book, becoming aware of the shift. So he was Lenny after all.<br />
<br />
“I called Rusty.” Tex said. “He knows. Dinner’s ready in an hour.”<br />
<br />
Lenny-now Benny-smiled and left the warehouse, looking forward to a lovely night with his boyfriend. Benny-now Lenny-stared after him in shock. <br />
<br />
“This isn’t permanent, is it?” BNL begged.<br />
<br />
“Until you fix it. Go home.” Tex pointed at the door. “My issues can wait. I’m going to use the time I have to fix the town. Something you should have been doing. And NO divorcing his wife, Benny.”<br />
<br />
Benny left, going home to a cold dinner and an even colder bed.</p>
