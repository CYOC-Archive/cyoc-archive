<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well...&quot; She said with a mischievous look in her eye as she twirled her hair. &quot;I wish Harry knew what it was like to...&quot; And then she lent in close to the genie so I couldn't here the rest. But the way the genie's eyebrows went up and up with every word she said scared me.<br />
<br />
&quot;As you command, mistress.&quot; The genie said, clapping his hands.<br />
<br />
It was strange, I didn't feel any different. But all of a sudden a long, blond strand of hair fell in my face. Reaching up to brush it aside, my hand struck something soft but heavy, and I suddenly felt my chest jiggle. Looking down, I was greeted with a pair of giant breasts! Looking across the room at the full length mirror I was shocked to see a big breasted blond babe looking back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Babe, like, what did you wish for?&quot; I asked in a pouty voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... nothing much.&quot; She giggled then. &quot;Just for you to become a hot, blond woman who loves her E-cup breasts and is proud of her amazing good looks. Oh, and by the way, you're new name is Rachel and you work as a model for a men's magazine. Also, the boys are coming over in half an hour, so I'd get ready if I were you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Boys?&quot; I asked, suddenly worried. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, our boyfriends. Look, I'll help you get ready this once, but you'll need to learn for yourself if you want to look good for the rest of your time.&quot; She seemed to sense my next question, and answer it for me. &quot;You'll be like this for a week, so get comfortable. But not too comfortable, I don't want to be woken up in the middle of the night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;By what?&quot; I asked, suddenly naive.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, you're a woman now. A woman with certain needs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Needs?&quot; I asked again, suddenly scared.<br />
<br />
But Sasha didn't answer, she just set about getting me ready for the boys. Forty minutes later I was sitting in a short, skimpy black dress with my legs crossed and leaning forward to give Lee a good look of my breasts. I was surprised by how hot they were, and soon found myself showing off. When I say showing off, I mean acting a bit ditsy so that Lee would have to come over and help. After a few drinks I began to loosen up a bit. After a few more the rule book was out the window. I was a totally different person. In fact, you would never have guessed that this ditsy blond girl, who was practically begging to be fucked, have been a man just forty minutes ago. I was even talking openly about my breasts, displaying how, with now hands, I could move them both. Somehow, that led to Lee sticking his ice cold beer between my boobs, which made my nipples come erect.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oops.&quot; I giggled, looking down at myself. &quot;Looks like the girls are popping up to say hello. If you want your beer, Lee, just grab it from the candy jar.&quot;<br />
<br />
A few hours and many drinks later I was a giggling mess. So much so that Lee had to carry me upstairs to bed. But as soon as that bedroom door closed, I were as sober as ever.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just sit down, big fella, and enjoy the show.&quot; I told him, untying the loop around my neck, letting the dress pool on the floor. Stepping out of it, I walked up to him in my high heels and lent in close. &quot;I'm all yours.&quot; I purr.<br />
<br />
So maybe I was still a bit drunk, because I don't remember the specifics. All I remember is that it was the best sex I had ever had. When I woke up in the morning I was still in my pantie and high heels, my black bra was lying on the bed beside me. Behind me, Lee stirred and I felt a hand grope my left tit. A moan of pleasure escaped my lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello gorgeous.&quot; Lee said, placing his other hand on my hip as his first began to massage my boobs. I had never felt anything like it. My nipples were stiff, but my breasts melted under his hands like putty, sending waves of pleasure rolling through my body that left me moaning for me. As his left hand busied itself with my boobs, his mouth found its way to my neck, and his right hand slide down to slip inside my panties. My moaning got louder as his fingers probed my tight, wet lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;You like it when I do that, don't you?&quot; He asked, and my slightly elevated moan gave him all the answer he needed. &quot;Would you like something else in there?&quot; He whispered in my ear, and, through the pleasure, I managed to nod my head. &quot;Well there's something you've gotta do first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Slowly rolling over, I saw that he had cast aside the sheets to reveal his rock hard member. I knew what I had to do, and the part of me formerly known as Brett screamed out in resistance, but it was useless. I needed to be fucked, and I didn't care what I did to get it. <br />
<br />
I wasn't quite sure what to do, so first I lightly kissed the tip. As soon as my lips touched it though, my body knew exactly what to do. I was surprised as the feeling of hardness slide between my pouty lips made me even wetter. The warm feeling spread to the rest of my body and I found my free hand went to my breasts, feeling the beautiful roundness and the stiff nipples. Without realising it, I started making sucking noises. After a few minutes my body was aching so bad to be fucked and, to my delight, Lee got up on his knees. As I looked up from where I was kneeling, I pulled back to speak. Just as I did so I felt something hot and sticky shoot all over me. His hot cum covered my breasts, and some trickled down from my mouth. <br />
<br />
I was so horny, and at this stage I would do anything for Lee. I continued my work, licking up his mess, and playing with him in my mouth, working him up to his horny state.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ready babe?&quot; Lee asked, turning me around.<br />
<br />
I was. I remember the feeling of last night, and knew I had to experience it while I was sober. I was just going to say yes, but it appeared that my body had other plans. &quot;Oh yes! Fuck me!&quot; I found myself screaming. He didn't waste any time. Bending me over, he entered my pussy from behind. If last night was good, the morning after was better. He thrust harder and faster the longer we went, but it still wasn't enough. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh.&quot; I moaned. &quot;Deeper.... deeper!&quot; I managed to instruct him between moans. The pleasure continued to mount. We cahnged positions many times, eventually ending up with him on his back, and me riding him upright. With each thrust and buck of my hips, I could feel my breasts wobbling violently and my hair being thrown about. The pleasure was building towards something now, as he finally found my G spot. I was screaming, loud and horny with each thrust. Finally I felt a hot spurt and the most immense pleasure rolled through me as I orgasmed. Afterwards, I was on my knees looking at the mirror opposite as Lee got up behind and began to massage my breasts. As I continued to moan, softly now, I looked at the girl in the mirror, the pleasure on her face, the soft, pleasurable lips, the lusty look in her eye. This was Rachel, and Rachel liked it here.</p>
