<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Zossie woke up in a rather groggy manner in the morning. Her entire body was a little sore and she was unaware that this soreness was caused by the changes the night before. She flung her blankets off her and stepped out of bed stretching from side to side before creeping downstairs for a glass of water. It was still raining outside so she watched the rain splatter against the windows backed by a steel gray dawn. Once she was hydrated she filled her water bottle some more and returned to her room grabbing a yoga mat and laying it on the ground. Immediately she grabbed her old laptop and turned on a video with a daily regimen.<br />
<br />
She stretched every single muscle of her body that morning and a half decent sweat built up in her skin. She quickly returned nimbleness to her body and was able to lift her entire body and hold a bridge for a good four minutes before she had to drop herself. By this point the video had ended and she was just doing stretches herself. She stood on her hands and held her feet pointed at the ceiling, she stood on one leg and held her body outwards diagonally, and finished by wrapping her legs around her arms and holding that position.<br />
<br />
Once done she grabbed her towel, phone, and speaker and headed to the bathroom. She closed the door and turned on her speaker putting the intro theme for the game “Ruinport: Legend of the Crystal Eye” and the song that would play over a storybook based cutscene began to play as she stepped under the water. The music filled her ears and she closed her eyes letting the cold water course over her body. Immediately any excess fat washed off her body and her limbs and muscles became more lean and nimble. She could suddenly recall being in gymnastics since she was six. Now she was one of the most senior members of the group and her steps were incredibly nimble, quiet, and quick because of it. Suddenly that bridge she had held had been a short one, she could now stand on her hands for ten minutes, bridge for upwards of twenty, and practically bend over backwards. Her limbs became double jointed to make her expertise assisted by her natural DNA and her body frame became more petite with smaller breasts and smaller hips. She got taller however and had to bow her head to allow the water to fliw through it. Her waist caved in to a perfect hourglass and her proportions began to smooth out until she looked like a beautiful and slim young woman.<br />
<br />
Next her hair shortened until it was near her neck. It wouldn’t flail around as a ponytail anymore and of tied back it would have practically no tail at all. She could recall having this hairstyle since she was younger and her skin paled a little from most of her exercising being done indoors and a smile spread across her face as the playlist of music she had began to change into story based game music.<br />
<br />
Zossie loves video games for the story. She loved RPGs, she loved villains, and she loved cinematic cutscenes. She rarely played a game long after the story had completed because the process of beating the game, unlocking things as she progressed, and starting from scratch enamoured her. Her collection began to shift and her requirements for a good game changed. The single player plot driven game was ideallic for her and as she opened her eyes she found herself thinking about stories, not just ones she was playing but ones she had thought up. She wanted to be a writer for video games when she grew up and had her sights set on a university computing degree with a minor in English so she could have the credentials. She wrote in her free time alongside gaming and could think of character arcs, analyze plot threads, and pick up on foreshadowing better than anyone in her grade. Her brain was currently thinking about a game she wanted to make one day where the story was about an adventurer that had to collect four sacred artifacts to defeat a great evil. The artifacts would be in four different worlds the player would explore and fight baddies in. She had character arcs for allies planned, a whole lot of cinematic ideas, and a hope that someone could see potential in her story. Her mind was hazy with imagination as she stood under the water smiling at the mere thought of one day writing a breathtaking and groundbreaking video game story that would rock the industry.</p>
