<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Caitlyn had just made her twenty-fifth consecutive basketball shot.  She just couldn’t miss.  <br />
She had thought when she wrote “perfect aim” on her list of clown traits that it would be <br />
only in regards to her pie throwing abilities.   Instead it looked like it extended to anything <br />
she threw.  She first realized it when the basketball had rolled over to Jill, Jenny, and <br />
herself while they were playing at recess.  One of the boys asked her to throw it back and <br />
she casually tossed it at the hoop and it went in.  Nobody could believe it, and after a little <br />
encouragement from Jill and Jenny tried again.  No matter where she stood on the court, <br />
even if she wasn’t facing the basket she could not miss if she tried even in the slightest to <br />
aim for it.  Finally the boys asked her to play and she had begun to dominate the game.<br />
<br />
Jill and Jenny laughed as their clowny friend ran up and down the court her feet squeaking.  <br />
Caitlyn was as funny on the court as off.  Boys kept tripping over her size 35 feet, and she <br />
would spin the ball on the middle finger of her four-fingered hands.  At one point she <br />
farted out her unicycle from her but and peddled and dribbled for a basket.  The boys tried <br />
to put up a defense, but whenever they guarded her she would fart and force them to back <br />
up.  “Hey no fair!”  One boy complained.<br />
<br />
“Hey you in my house now!” Caitlyn started, “And all we serve here is ‘shut the heck up’ <br />
with a side of ‘pick up yo face!’”  <br />
<br />
Jill and Jenny laughed as Caitlyn sneezed confetti into another boys face to make a play for <br />
the basket.  When she got close she jumped in the air to slam the ball, but being ten she <br />
was way to short to do so.  Caitlyn instead started to stretch her arms longer until she was <br />
able to put the ball in the hole and hang from the rim.  “Winner boys!  Don’t mess with the <br />
basketball queen clown next time!”<br />
<br />
All the kids cheered for their clown classmate, used to Caitlyn’s new class clown <br />
personality, but no one cheered harder than Greg.  Greg was a jock who had always liked <br />
clowns, and ever since Caitlyn changed into a clown he had begun to crush on her.  Now <br />
she was awesome at basketball?  He had to hang out with her.<br />
<br />
“Hey Caitlyn, “ Greg began as he walked up to Caitlyn and the girls.<br />
<br />
“Yes Greg?”  Caitlyn asked demurely.  She always had a crush on Greg.<br />
<br />
“You wanna hang out after school?”<br />
<br />
“Do I!?!” Caitlyn yelled while honking her nose.  She then realized what she did and <br />
composed herself.  “I mean, yeah, I guess so.  How about my house?”<br />
<br />
“Cool I’ll take the bus home with you.”<br />
<br />
“Cool.”<br />
<br />
“Cool.  See you then,”  Greg said as he walked away.<br />
<br />
Caitlyn turned to her friends excitedly and began to jump up and down with them.  She had <br />
a date with Greg!<br />
<br />
At her house Caitlyn introduced Greg to her mom Alice, her brother Mike, and Funzo the <br />
other clown who lived with them.  Afterward they went upstairs to play.<br />
<br />
“So how did you get all clowny?”  Greg asked.<br />
<br />
“My mom rubbed a special ointment on my feet and over a week I changed into a clown.”<br />
<br />
“You like it?”<br />
<br />
“Hell Yeah!  I get to act silly all the time, and nobody really says anything when I burp and <br />
fart anymore!”  And as if to prove her point Caitlyn issued forth an ear-shattering burp <br />
followed by a rank fart.<br />
<br />
“Cool!”<br />
<br />
“I know!”<br />
<br />
“You have any other ointments?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah.  Come with me and we’ll get them.”  Greg followed Caitlyn to her mother’s room <br />
where Caitlyn picked up the ointments.  Each tube was half empty now.  They then went <br />
back to her room.<br />
<br />
Greg looked over the different ointments and the muscle growth ointment caught his eye.  <br />
“Hey Caitlyn does this really grow muscles?”<br />
<br />
“Yep,” She smiled.  “Whatever ones you rub it on.”  <br />
<br />
“I’d like big muscles, the bigger the better.”<br />
<br />
“Cool!  I’ll show you how to water it down so it doesn’t last forever.”<br />
<br />
“No, I want it to last.”<br />
<br />
“Why, you’ll be huge and stuff.”<br />
<br />
“So?  Don’t you like being a clown?”<br />
<br />
“Well, yeah.”<br />
<br />
“So I want to have big muscles.”<br />
<br />
“Okay.  I get you.  I would hate if all of a sudden I went back to how I was.  I would never <br />
be happy again if I wasn’t a clown,” Caitlyn told Greg with a honk of her nose.  “Take off <br />
your clothes, they’re not gonna fit afterwards.  I’ll get a shirt and pants from my brother’s <br />
room.  They’re not gonna be pretty though.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Greg smiled at his beautiful clown girl, and moved one of her pink ringlets behind her ear.  <br />
“Whatever.”<br />
<br />
When Caitlyn came back with the clothes Greg was down to his underwear.  Greg was built <br />
like an average athletic 10-year-old.  Caitlyn smiles shyly as she took the tube from Greg <br />
and began to rub the ointment in.  Soon Greg’s muscles began to grow bigger.  After a few <br />
seconds they were twice their former size.<br />
<br />
“Bigger,” Greg told Caitlyn.<br />
<br />
“”No problem.”  Caitlyn smiled.  She started to rub the ointment on Greg when she farted.  <br />
She looked at Greg embarrassed.  Greg just smiled and kissed her on the nose.   Caitlyn <br />
smiled back and continued to rub the ointment on Greg.<br />
<br />
An hour went by when Greg’s mother showed up at the house to pick him up.  Alice called <br />
the two down so Greg could leave.  Caitlyn slid down the rail and landed on her big butt.  <br />
The compression squeezed a loud fart out of her butt.<br />
<br />
“Where’s Greg honey?” Alice asked.<br />
<br />
Caitlyn just smiled and looked up to the top of the stairs.  “Oh he’s coming.”<br />
<br />
Greg stood at the top.  He was in Mike’s clothes, but they barely fit.  Greg was huge his <br />
arms were 36 inches, legs 40 inches, chest 58 inches, forearms 30 inches, calves 32 inches.  <br />
His lats were so big he couldn’t put his arms to his side, and his traps came to the top of <br />
his neck.  Greg was a waling wall of muscle.<br />
<br />
“Gregory?”  His mom whispered.<br />
<br />
“Yeah mom,” Greg replied while flexing his bicep, making Caitlyn swoon a little.<br />
<br />
“Are you okay?”  <br />
<br />
“Never better.”<br />
<br />
“Well…say goodbye…I guess…”<br />
<br />
Greg turned to Caitlyn and grasped her four-fingered hand in his.<br />
<br />
“Goodbye…girlfriend.”<br />
<br />
“Goodbye…boyfriend.”<br />
<br />
Then they kissed goodbye.</p>
