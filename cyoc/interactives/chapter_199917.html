<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alora&#39;s arms were rather soaked from being beyond elbow deep inside her girlfriend&#39;s. But this was not the time to worry about that. She had 2 disheveled girls to make presentable in mere seconds. A task that was absolutely impossible to complete. And with Kara and Jeff both sweaty, panting, horny, and barely able to stand up on their shaky arms and legs, it sould be fairly easy to guess what was going on in the room.<br />
<br />
So she just scrambled to get the girl&#39;s at least cleaned up before the door was forced open and Kara and Jeff&#39;s mom hobbled in. To Alora&#39;s jaw dropping surprise, the woman she knew to be her girlfriends&#39; mother was pretty different than normal. <br />
<br />
She not only wasn&#39;t wearing anything, but her body was beautiful. The woman Alora knew to be a rather overweight and cranky old lady looked like she was no older than 35, and was as fit as a model. Even her boobs were pretty enormous for her body size, which now that Alora thought about it, matched both of her daughters&#39; situations. However her boobs were easily twice the size of Jeff&#39;s boobs, if not more. And they had almost no sign of any excess sagging.<br />
<br />
But while her upper half was impressive, her lower half was concerning. Her hips spread out to about 3 feet wide, adding almost 10 inches horizontally from her waistline on either side. It was like her hips were someone else&#39;s and her upper body was just placed down upon them. But while they were very wide, they had a good reason to be. Because nestled between her massive thighs, was a massive twin dicked udder. <br />
<br />
The pinkish mass was the size of an exercise ball and her dickteats were each easily over a foot long, each, and while flaccid. They were both as thick as a can too. Her legs, while strong and powerful, still kept their feminine charm, and her ass wasn&#39;t loosing out either. Even her cow ears had a cuteness to them as they poked through her long, straight, honey blonde hair. On her face, a look of unamusement was seemingly glued into place as it didn&#39;t even shift upon seeing the state of the room.<br />
<br />
Alora wondered if she had resting bitch face syndrome or something, but was quickly proven incorrect about that assumption. Jeff&#39;s and Kara&#39;s Mom, Clara, strode into the room, each step causing her massive mammaries to quiver and ripple with each step she took. Alora&#39;s eyes were glued to Clara&#39;s boobs while she watched them jostle about. <br />
<br />
Clara approached them, but then just walked by and opened up the window curtains and then the window in order to let in some light and fresh air. She then turned around and smiled kindly at the three girls. &quot;It&#39;s good to see you Kara, how are things going?&quot; She said cheerfully, as if nothing else demanded priority of her attention. <br />
<br />
&quot;Um... good. I guess. How are you?&quot; Managed to answer Kara. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just fine. Will you be staying long, or do you and Alora have plans for tonight? You are more than welcome to join us for dinner, Alora.&quot; Politely offered Clara to a surprised Alora. Clara&#39;s personality was vastly different from what she knew. <br />
<br />
As far as she could remember, Clara silently loathed her, and would go out of her way to avoid conversing with her, or even acknowledging her presence ever since Alora had come out. She didn&#39;t want her &quot;infecting&quot; Kara, which obviously isn&#39;t how it works, but she adamantly would not listen to a word Alora would say about it. <br />
<br />
So Alora didn&#39;t know how to respond when Clara suddenly asked her directly if she would like to stay for dinner. She was understandably hesitant to respond, thinking it was a trick question or something, but then Jeff of all people spoke up. <br />
<br />
&quot;You absolutely should stay, and I would gladly cook you anything you would like to eat since I know you probably don&#39;t want to eat what we&#39;re having.&quot; <br />
<br />
Alora was confused by this as well. She didn&#39;t understand anything. But she figured that something must have been drastically changed when she &quot;normalized&quot; the sisters&#39; condition. It most likely was a misunderstanding on her part on the scope of who would be affected when she toggled that box on. She thought it would just extend to the person themselves only, but from the looks of it, it made it normal for everyone, save herself.<br />
<br />
Upon comming to that conclusion, Alora was satisfied with it being the explanation for now and decided to roll with it for as long as possible. She figured that if things were different now, and she was openly accepted into the house without causing tension, then she shouldn&#39;t worry about it and just go along with it, for now at least. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, sure, yeah I can stay. Thank you. And what do you mean by that Jeff?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I highly doubt that you like grazing, correct? So I will make you something else&quot; softly explained Jeff. Alora now understood what she meant. <br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t know you knew how to cook human food, Jeff&quot; suddenly said Clara in surprise. It was a bit of a reality shock for Alora to hear Clara refer to it as &quot;human food&quot;. Jeff nodded &quot;Yeah, I wanted to learn how to do it, and whole I never tasted any of it, since I can&#39;t eat it, I think it comes out well enough. It almost always looks pretty close to what the pictures show at least.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I would love to have something. And you can make whatever, I&#39;m not that picky.&quot; Answered Alora, now a bit curious as to what exactly Jeff felt confident enough to claim that she knew how to make. <br />
<br />
With that decided, Jeff quickly trotted out of the room as she still was down on all fours, and went to get started on cooking. Alora followed after her, as with her being the only aparent &quot;human&quot;, she felt that she should at least be around to help ensure that her own food is still edible. This left Kara and Clara alone in the room together.</p>
