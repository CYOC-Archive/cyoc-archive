+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Angelica&#39;s primary mission was to observe and potentially help Jane/Janith if her observations proved that the succubus was truly seeking redemption. Though given their interactions in the church, Angelica was certain that Jane/Janith was seeking that. She was essentially leaving behind the &quot;side&quot; she had been born into in a long standing war against good and evil and the souls of humanity. Demons typically sought to destroy humanity, as succubi devoured male souls and incubi devoured female souls, though both demons had the capacity to feed on both genders if they had to. They didn&#39;t feel the concepts such as love because when they were created by Lucifer, a fallen angel, they were created to follow a path aimed at securing power or providing power for Lucifer as part of the &quot;civil war&quot; between heavenly beings. But Lucifer LOST that war and was imprisoned in hell, which was actually a prison, NOT a separate kingdom. But his followers still sought that, and might even try to free their master, and until Janith, as Jane fell in love, Angelica thought that ALL demons were that way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Most contradictory to your fellows,&quot; Angelica thought to herself as she silently patrolled the apartment.<br />
<br />
She paused for a moment to look into the master bedroom where the demon and her human husband slept. It was quite a peaceful scene, despite everything though William did look rather fearful, even in his sleep, which was understandable given the stories and the fact that demons did tend to follow what those stories told, until Janith fell in love with him. Though, in a way, she also sensed something special in William as well, something that he didn&#39;t notice and Janith likely hadn&#39;t noticed. It wasn&#39;t something that said &quot;hey I&#39;m some other supernatural creature&quot; or anything like that. It was a sort of purity and respect. It was an innate goodness in him that had won Jane/Janith&#39;s heart and triggered her change in behavior. She sought to redeem herself for him, which Angelica supposed was the power of love.<br />
<br />
But Angelica had also learned, as part of her training in heaven to recognize signs and potential as part of her assignments to monitor potential threats to humanity. The result of that was sensing a great deal of purity in the Janith&#39;s eldest daughter, who only had a human name, according to what Janith had told her. Julie had never even been given a secret demon&#39;s name and only had the human name that Janith and William had given her. And it appeared that the two of them had raised their children to believe in God and probably even to serve him in their own way, which was partially what got Angelica assigned to observe Janith in the first place. Demons typically didn&#39;t care about life or even the forgiveness that God would give them if they were willing to abandon their war to corrupt humanity and free Lucifer, and that left their powers dark...<br />
<br />
But due to Janith&#39;s obvious attempts at redemption and trying absolve any previous offenses that Angelica had not witnessed, Angelica had gotten the sense that Janith&#39;s powers, while still &quot;demonic&quot; in nature were starting to &quot;lighten.&quot; Now, due to Janith&#39;s past it was unlikely that she, herself, could find true purity. Redemption, forgiveness, and salvation, yes. Purity, no. BUT, Janith&#39;s attempt at salvation, and William&#39;s honest and pure love for her had lead to the potential that Julie had had inherited the &quot;light side&quot; version of Janith&#39;s natural powers, even if weakened because Julie was only half succubus, the resulting purity and goodness in Julie (coming to her from BOTH her parents) had lead to something that Angelica did sense and felt that she would need to protect.<br />
<br />
Now, Angelica knew nothing was truly &quot;set in stone&quot; and that humans had free will, and thus the ability to determine their own fate. But given the lineage that Julie came from, and the purity that Angelica could sense in her, Julie might one day give birth to a human prophet that would be able to help resolve the differences between Christianity (and all its denominations), Judaism, and Islam. Either in that they they would fully compromise and form a new religion that combined elements of all three or that they would compromise and that while they&#39;d remain separate, they wouldn&#39;t see each religion as truly different and that they would all get along regardless of their differences. This would also lead to better relations with those of other religious faiths that didn&#39;t necessarily believe in the same God as Christians, Jews, or Muslims and help protect all humanity from demons that Janith had rejected and left when she fell in love with William.<br />
<br />
Angelica continued to patrol the apartment and checked in on each child as they slept. The younger three seemed to peacefully unaware of what had happened that night as they had apparently already been in bed when the powers Julie had inherited from her mother began to manifest themselves. Julie was in deep sleep, though looking somewhat fearful as well. Angelica didn&#39;t sense that she was having any nightmare, but her sleep wasn&#39;t necessarily entirely sound either, but it was understandable. To suddenly manifest powers, abilities, and physical attributes that one didn&#39;t think was possible could be very frightening. <br />
<br />
Angelica also noticed differences in Julie&#39;s form from Janith&#39;s. Janith&#39;s skin was red. Janith&#39;s fingers and toes were tipped with noticeable claws. Janith&#39;s body was definitely built to seduce and enthrall human males, and also had a pair of dark red, almost black, bat-like wings growing from her back. In addition, Janith&#39;s crimson colored tail was tipped by what largely looked like a human phallus. Janith&#39;s slightly curved horns were also noticeably large for a succubus, which did indicate that at one time Janith had truly been like other succubi as horn growth was proportional to their feeding on humans. Julie&#39;s demon form, however, had white skin, no claws and human hands and feet, no wings of any kind, and her tail was spade shaped and almost looked like what humans drew to represent a heart. Julie&#39;s horns were also quite smile and were barely noticeable. Angelica even felt that if Julie let her hair grow long enough, no one would notice, regardless of magic or transformative abilities. It could mean differences in DNA or a result of the purity in Julie&#39;s powers that could lead to a future prophet, but the differences were there.<br />
<br />
Though Angelica also knew that Julie would need protection. Janith may abandoned other demons to seek redemption, which Angelica had promised to help Janith attain, but that didn&#39;t necessarily mean that other demons would take that lightly. While Angelica knew that angles would accept Janith&#39;s support for God and that God would forgive her, she also knew that many demons would see Janith&#39;s actions as treasonous to their war and would likely take some aggressive action when they sensed Janith&#39;s betrayal. While Angelica got the sense that Janith could defend herself if need be, Janith&#39;s husband and children would need protection as well, which Angelica figured would be a separate mission though still connected with her primary mission.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will protect you,&quot; Angelica said to the residents of the home and remained vigilant.</p>
