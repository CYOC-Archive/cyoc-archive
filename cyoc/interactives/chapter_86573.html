<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I&#39;m going to make Sam older, because he&#39;s the one who believes me&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam shouted &quot;Yes!&quot; and punched the air. &quot;Make me 18 so I&#39;m legally an adult. No no wait, make me 35 because then I&#39;ll be older than my parents! No, actually I don&#39;t want to get too old too fast, make me 21 for now so I can drink beer! But then I might need ID to prove I&#39;m really 21, make me -&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Slow down!&quot; Jimmy interrupted, slamming a hand over Sam&#39;s mouth to make him stop talking. &quot;I still need to remember how the rings work in the first place. I&#39;ll do requests after testing it&quot;. Sam sat down and impatiently waited for his friend. Conner rolled his eyes at his enthusiasm, still skeptic that anything will work. Jimmy closed his eyes and recalled the freaky events he saw earlier in the day. &quot;I think he made a wish out loud?&quot; he muttered under his breath. &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s it. A wish. OK. I wish Sam was 15 years older&quot;.<br />
<br />
Nothing appeared to happen. No sparkles, no swirly colours, no smoke. Conner scoffed and was about to make a sarcastic comment when Sam suddenly jumped up from his chair and started squirming. &quot;Guys, I feel weird. Is it working?&quot;. Jimmy and Conner looked at the shaky boy but it was hard to tell with his constant movement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you stop prancing about? You&#39;re making me feel sick&quot; said Conner.<br />
<br />
Sam shook his head and said &quot;Everything feels itchy and tight. I need to take my clothes off rIGht nOW!&quot;. Conner and Jimmy gasped as Sam&#39;s voice began to crack. But the boy didn&#39;t notice, too engrossed in yanking off his tightening clothes as quick as possible, leaving just his boxers on. He sighed in relief and muttered in a smooth, much deeper voice &quot;That&#39;s better...&quot;. He froze and said in surprise &quot;Wait, was that me? Hellooooooo! Shamble bobble dibble dooble! Oh my god, I sound like I&#39;m using anti-helium or something!&quot;. Conner and Jimmy only nodded their heads, too engrossed in their growing friend. Since taking his clothes off, it became very apparent that he&#39;d sprouted half a foot in height, and he was still growing. He&#39;d lost his chubby appearance, his weight now out of proportion with his height leaving him very lanky. Dark hair lightly sprinkled his arms and legs, while a few popped up in a thin line from his bellybutton leading into his underwear. Sam soon felt uncomfortable with the way his friends were staring at him. Sure he was going through puberty at an inhuman rate but they didn&#39;t have to stare so hard. Finally, he clapped his hands loudly in front of them and they snapped out of their stunned daze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah... woah! It&#39;s really happening. Dude, you look old enough to drive now! This is so unreal!&quot; Conner said ecstatically, his skepticism replaced with excitement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah and soon you&#39;re going to be old enough to drink alcohol! You should totally buy us some once this is over&quot; Jimmy added.<br />
<br />
Sam rubbed his head sheepishly and said &quot;Gosh, do I have to? Wouldn&#39;t that be illegal? I don&#39;t want to get in trouble hours after becoming an adult&quot;. He&#39;d stopped getting taller at an adequate 5ft 9 and his thin frame was starting to fill out in response, putting on a healthy mix of muscle and fat. His hand fell from his head to rub his chin, grinning at the pinpricks of hair that were multiplying across his face. More hair was spreading quickly across his chest and his stomach, not to mention thickening around his limbs. He&#39;d even gained a smattering on the back of his hands and feet.<br />
<br />
Jimmy shrugged his shoulders and asked &quot;Well how else are we going to get it?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Sam gave him an incredulous look, waved his arms up and down his growing body and threw them towards Jimmy. He said in a matter-of-fact tone &quot;You literally just used a magic ring to make me an adult. Use it to make yourself and Conner into adults as well, stupid!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jimmy blushed in embarrassment and said softly &quot;Oh yeah... What do you say Conner? Ready to join Sam in adulthood?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Conner nodded his head enthusiastically and eagerly replied &quot;Hell yeah! Then we can all go into town to enjoy the night!&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;We could totally buy some cigarettes and smoke them without anyone telling us how bad they are&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Smoking&#39;s never really interested me. Tattoos though, I&#39;m definitely getting one!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, me too! But first, we should find the cheapest bar and get drunk&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Forget that, we could go to a strip club! How sick would that be?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam coughed loudly to get his friends&#39; attention. They looked at him and gasped. He&#39;d stopped aging and looked positively manly. He had a few week&#39;s worth of facial hair covering his face which looked to be the same length as his hair, buzzed short and manageable. Since his beanpole period, he&#39;d put on a comfortable amount of weight that filled out his body nicely, looking like the kind of man who tried to keep in shape yet wasn&#39;t averse to a big, hearty meal. He didn&#39;t have much definition to his torso, although if he did, it was difficult to see through the hair that covered his body in a dense coating, even spreading over his shoulders and lightly scattering his back. His underwear were stretched tight around his waist, threatening to burst at any moment. &quot;So how do I look?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
Conner shook his head in disbelief and said &quot;Hairy... You know, if I didn&#39;t just watch you transform in front of me, you could introduce yourself as your uncle and I&#39;d probably believe you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jimmy nodded in agreement. &quot;Yeah, it&#39;s hard to believe you were our age only a few minutes ago. But not for long, I wis-&quot;.<br />
<br />
Sam yelled out &quot;Woah! Before you make that wish, we need to figure some things out first. Other than my body, nothing else has changed right? How will we get anywhere without ID? How are we going to sneak out of the house without your parents knowing and getting worried? And most importantly, what am I going to wear! My underwear are killing me, my bits need to breathe but I don&#39;t want to be naked in front of you guys...&quot; <br />
<br />
Conner spotted a discarded towel on the floor and threw it over to Sam. He held it up loosely around his waist and turned away from his friends just as a loud snap signalled the end of his boxers. Using his free hand, he yanked the ruined underwear off him before tightly wrapping the towel around his lower body. &quot;Well it&#39;s a start&quot; he muttered &quot;But my point still stands&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jimmy looked at the ring on his finger and said &quot;Hmm, I don&#39;t know. Maybe the ring can do more than just make you look older. Maybe it can make you think older, or even change our lives so we really are older! If only it came with a manual...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam scratched at his thick chest hair and said &quot;Well make a wish and give it a try. It&#39;s not like I&#39;m going anywhere looking like this&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jimmy thought it over, shook his hands out and said...</p>
