<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katlyn was having a blast, she and a group of guys she had met a few hours ago were partying on this beach, there were six of them, and they were all pretty hot, not amazing, but sporty enough to be football players. She was pretty as well, a little shorter than them, 5&#39;9&quot; to their 6&#39; heights, slightly curvy, with DD cup breasts. She was definitely cheerleader material, but had left that behind when she started college, she didn&#39;t have enough time for that. <br />
<br />
This beach party was very spontaneous, and she definitely had some kinky things in mind. It was a bit after noon when they all heard a distant series of thundering booms, cresting the hill was a gigantic twenty five foot tall, seemingly headless female body, dressed in heels and a frilly white dress. Stunned by the sight they barely time to react as they heard the body make a blood curdling scream, trip and roll right toward them, it crushed them beneath it&#39;s weight but they didn&#39;t seem to hurt, but something strange happened, suddenly they all removed their heads. <br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Jen&#39;s massive body stood up and she saw her hand move toward her head, she for a brief moment was excited that she may actually be away from this hell, when her body moved and placed her head in the hands of a busty girl with a body not unlike her own, that was when she noticed the six men around the girl, all with their heads held out in their hands and screamed as her head attached to the woman&#39;s body. <br />
<br />
------<br />
<br />
Katlyn and the men she still didn&#39;t know the names of placed their heads into the hands of the giantess body, and were unceremoniously attached to the body, their minds shifted and they started to walk robotically, the curse guiding their body away from the beach, and back to L.A. what they would do there wasn&#39;t clear, but the new collective mind would figure that out later.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Jen screamed in horror as the massive body walked away and the six male bodies started to close in around her, surrounding her in a circle each attached their necks to her head, after they had attached they all stood up, her new female body&#39;s feet lifted off the ground as they stood to full height, pressing in around her, leaving no room to move, and nothing to the imagination as they in unison stepped to the sea, Jen crying and screaming in seven alien voices as they drew closer to the ocean and finally were struck by a wave. Panic set in, this was her new form, she tried to push her beefy male bodies away from her only to find each move hindered by their closeness. Losing herself to panic and shaking her body responded the only way it new how, her male bodies in unison hugged her female center and sent her over the edge, the twelve strong arms making her even more claustrophobic she squirmed trying to break free as she fought against the bodies that were all under her control.<br />
<br />
&quot;STOP! NO!&quot; Jen screamed at herself, wrestling against the hug her, twelve new hands loosening only to inadvertently grope herself, hands grabbed her breasts and ass, caressed her thighs and rubbed her back, she felt her male bodies start to get horny, and felt all six of her cocks press against her hips, ass and crotch as they started to fumble under her control. Jen couldn&#39;t resist the sensations for long, as her male bodies continued to fumble, not knowing where or how to stop touching herself by accident. Finally unable to resist her growing hunger her new bodies started to strip off their clothes, much to her protests she found herself completely naked, much to her discomfort she stills squirmed. <br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t until this point that she realized that the bodies surrounding her center were lined up perfectly for sex, two to the sides and one in front and back of her, this made her even more uncomfortable as her new female body lost all control and grabbed the dicks of the two towards the front as the one in front shoved it&#39;s cock straight into her new pussy grabbing her hips, the one from behind shoved it&#39;s cock into her new ass grabbing and massaging her breasts. Her body&#39;s original owners were going to have and orgy, and they weren&#39;t going to miss out just because Jen had them now. Jen moaned, falling into the rhythm as the males to the back were being jacked off and caressed by themselves. <br />
<br />
Jen grinded herself, unable to control herself any longer she orgasmed, feeling bliss like she never felt before, her front body pulling out just on time, splattering cum against her stomach and breasts as she cam all over herself, collapsing to her knees she screamed, not in horror but in bliss, panting she moaned, her bodies pressed against each other, she nearly fainted, but kept with it. Jen thought she was done, but she felt her bodies start to move again, she moaned in protest but her bodies didn&#39;t listen, they wanted an orgy and they were going to get one, they started groping and caressing again as Jen helpless, begged for them to stop as they started to act up again, she bolted upright, turning her new monstrous form to face away from the sea as she tried to run away in vein, her bodies tight proximity turning her on again, her bodies original intentions for being on that beach becoming more apparent, her forward movement caused her to trip, her bodies tumbling with her, legs and arms now tangled her bodies continued to get horny and hard, and she soon found herself caught in another orgy, then another, and another, and another.<br />
<br />
Finally, after twelve, obviously curse propelled orgies, Jen was left with her seven sweaty bodies, covered in cum and reeking of sex, Jen could only pant, moaning in a chorus of baritone voices that drowned out her only feminine one, she lay there for a while. The sun was setting and she finally pulled herself together, what had horrified her from the moment she was forced onto these bodies was now just a dull memory, seemingly having been fucked out of her. Jen slowly moved all her bodies into a sitting position, her center sitting provocatively, surrounded by six studs, Jen sighed and finally spoke to her new bodies.<br />
<br />
&quot;You guys are a bunch of fucking wild pigs. Now we have to get a shower.&quot;</p>
