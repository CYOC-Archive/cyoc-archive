<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In the bustling mall, people were walking by, browsing and purchasing whatever items they need.  But in the mall, one lone woman was walking by feeling gloom.  This woman is 30-years-old with an average build with B-cup breasts, medium curvy build, and somewhat toned arms and legs.  Her face wasn’t much to look at was oval shaped, medium size lips, thin and long nose, and sky blue eyes.  Her brown hair was short and has a cowlick down to the side.  She was also wearing a V-neck stripped sweater that doesn’t show much cleavage, tight gray legging that go down to her legs, and a pair of walking boots with straps around it.  Her name is Vanessa and she is a bored woman looking for some fun in her life.  But the only fun around her the same old same old.<br />
<br />
Looking around, she could see people going on their phones and tablets, going on their social profiles, looking through videos, or tweeting some random things.  Looking on, she grunted and said to herself, “These people…  Is that what they do for fun?  Going on devices just to see the same old videos, same old tweets, or the same old status?  Whatever happened to the times when these social media sites and tablets don’t exist.  This generation is so dead.”  She sighed and continued to walk down the mall.<br />
<br />
From what she could tell, she was starting to live in the wrong generation.  Things were okay for Viennese for sometime, but when tablets and social media became a thing, it seems that people care more about their Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Youtube nonsense, and less on the life people had.  All the time in history, people her age never had those types of things, instead, the people in the past socialize outside, watch plays, movies, or TV in the past, depending what year previous generations have.  “These millennials, they don’t understand that others have in the past.  No one needed tablets, or video games, or social media to get by with life.” She said to herself with a sigh, “Sometimes, I always think that I’m born in the wrong generation.  That I would be in the generation that matters.  If I were to go back time to the generation that don’t need such pathetic things, I would by happier.  I would have more fun there then in this waste of space.”<br />
<br />
As she was walking down the mall, something caught her eyes and turned to see what it is.  On hindsight, it almost looks like some type of medieval store filled with weird and interesting trinkets.  Above the store is a sign that reads out loud, ‘Merlin’s Spells ‘R’ Us’.  Starring at the store, she was quite curious and said, “That’s odd…  I have never seen this store before.  Maybe it’s a new place.”  Her curiosity soon go the best of her, as she approached the store and opened door.<br />
<br />
Upon entering it, she could tell that this wasn’t no ordinary store.  There were various items within this store that’s out of this world.  From crystal balls to rings, old musty books to scrolls, even a bizarre things like computer programs, devices, costumes, furniture, and many other strange and unique things.  It was a store of unknown curiosity as she looked through all of this.  “Whoa…  Look at this place.  I’ve never seen anything like it.  Wonder what’s all of this is about.” She asked in wonder.  As she was looking at it all, she heard a voice from the distance.<br />
<br />
“Can I help you?”<br />
<br />
She soon heard the voice and turned to the direction.  That was when she saw an elder man with the long white bears and wearing a wizard costume.  Assuming it’s just someone in cosplay, she waved him off and said, “No, I’m just looking around.  Got to say, I never seen a place like this.  Have you opened before?”<br />
<br />
The old store clerk smiled and said, “Why, yes we did.  We’ve just opened about a week ago.  We always have certain customers come in here to see what trinkets we have and they also leave happy.”<br />
<br />
“Is that so?  Well, I say this place has quite an assortment.  All these books and items, it looks like you obtain quite a collection.” Vanessa said back.<br />
<br />
The clerk heard her and responded with, “Well, these are no ordinary items.  What you see here are special items that are magical.”<br />
<br />
Viennese turned back to him and raised an eyebrow.  “Magical?” she asked.<br />
<br />
“Why yes, they are magical.” He continued, “These items you see here contain special types of magic that can change someone’s life.  Rings that can grant anyone wishes beyond their dreams, scrolls that can change the person to whatever they please, costumes that will change a person’s livelihood.  Anything in this store can give people a second chance, a better future, or anything in-between.”<br />
<br />
Viennese heard him and was a little skeptical.  “Uh-huh…  Sorry, but I find all that hard to believe.  There is no such thing as magic.  Only think is technology that today’s generation only cares about.”<br />
<br />
The clerk sighed and knew that she was right.  “Perhaps you’re right.  People today think that silly devices showing them a world they cannot comprehend.  But what you see here is something that can change anyone’s perspective, including your own.”<br />
<br />
Vanessa chuckled and told him, “Is that right?  Well I don’t believe in magic.”<br />
<br />
“Maybe…  But you wish to live in a world where such technologies don’t exist.  To live in a past where life is simple, and fun.”<br />
<br />
Vanessa stopped browsing and was quite surprised by that.  “How did you…?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I know that you feel lost in the present, that you wish to live in the past with a generation that don’t need tablets, social media, or games to have a good time.  And that you prefer to born in a generation that is more sophisticated then today.  I can help you with that.” The store clerk said.<br />
<br />
“And you can grant me a chance to live a better life that this dead-end?” she asked out of curiosity.<br />
<br />
“But of course.” The clerk responded, “And I got just the perfect item for you.”<br />
<br />
He soon got to the counter and was going to get something.  At the same time, Vanessa approached the counter to see what he got for her.  Soon enough, he took a box out of the glass container and presented it to the woman.<br />
<br />
“This is what you looking for.  Something that will give you a better life in another generation.”<br />
<br />
Opening the box, Vanessa noticed that it was some kind of necklace with a small clock piece locket that was still moving.  She starred at it and said, “Wow…  That’s a nice looking necklace.  Though I don’t know how it’s going to help me.”<br />
<br />
The clerk chuckled and explained what it is.  “This, my dear, is called the Time Travel Necklace, a rare and powerful item in my shop.  Anyone who wears it around the neck will gain the ability to go back, or move forward, in time.  How’s it work is that the user of this necklace would say a certain place or a certain time they wish to go to.  Once they say it, the person would be whisked into a time vortex that will take them into that said time destination.  As they enter the vortex, the body and mind of the user will alter to fit that time period.  Not only that, but the mannerisms, language, and other certain traits will change into the type in that time.  It can even progress or regress the person’s age if they wish to, or become a historical figure of that time period, such as George Washington, King George, Queen Cleopatra, or any other figure.  The downside is when the person holds on to the necklace, you can still remember the past life that person had, along with new memories and skill in the time period the person chooses.  But if you remove it, those memories of the person’s previous life will be erased and be stuck in that time period forever.  So if I were you, I would hold on to the necklace for as long as possible.”<br />
<br />
Vanessa heard it all and was a little skeptic.  “Sounds a little risky if you ask me.  And are you sure that this necklace will actually work.  I still don’t believe in magic.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, it will work.  There were many people before you who obtained that necklace before and their lives are far more entertaining then that they had.  I’m sure you will enjoy it as much as anyone else.” He said to her.<br />
<br />
Vanessa looked to the necklace and couldn’t help but to feel a little iffy about it.  Indeed, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity in living in a generation where social media never existed, but she wondered if it will work or not.  So with an intent in living her dream, she looked up and said, “All right, I’ll take it.  How much is it?”<br />
<br />
The store clerk closed the box and placed it on the counter, simply handing it to her.  “No need for payment.  If this is what you really wish for, I’ll give it to you, free of charge.  You deserve it.”<br />
<br />
Now she was surprised.  Not only is this clerk offering her a Time Traveling Necklace, but it’s for free.  This is all too easy.  Could it be a scam, some cheap trinket?  Either way, she needed to see what this necklace can do and decided to take it anyways.  Grabbing the box, she looked to the clerk and said, “Thank you, good sir, I will cherish it.”<br />
<br />
The clerk looked on and said to her, “Naw…  Call me Merlin.  It’s nice to help those who are in need.”<br />
<br />
Vanessa heard that name and find that to be very familiar.  But she brushed it aside and took the box from him.  “Thanks again.”<br />
<br />
She soon turned around and left the store.  When she leave, the clerk, Merlin, watched on and was pleased with his latest customer.  “Such an ambitious girl.  I just hope that she doesn’t make a foolish judgment of error and cause some problems.” He said as he went back to work.<br />
<br />
Half an hour later, Vanessa was back in her apartment studio and was looking at the box on the table.  Slowly opening up, she could see the necklace in it and was starring at it for a while.  “A chance to live in a better generation than this…” she murmured to herself, “I never believe that this necklace can grant me that.  But I am curious as to what this necklace can do.”<br />
<br />
Looking around, she could see that her very dorm isn’t much to talk about.  A flat screen TV, a state of the art kitchen, a normal bedroom, a state of the art computer, a wide bathroom, and a lounge area.  All nice, but nothing to talk about.  “And to think I would leave my apartment to live in someplace different, let alone in a different time period.” She kept murmuring, “I would give it all up for a chance to a better life.  I just hope that what this Merlin said can actually come true.”<br />
<br />
Removing the necklace from the box, she wrapped it around her neck and stood up from her chair.  She approached the full length mirror and looked to herself before making that wish to send to another time period.  Knowing this is the last time seeing herself, she took a deep breath and said, “Well…  Here goes.”  She started to think what time period, what generation, she would live in that will make her life better.  But with many periods, it’s difficult to know what to choose.  After much thought, she came up with the perfect time period.</p>
