<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Oh, who am I kidding?!” Wes proclaimed. “You’re both just so cute like this, and it’s a warm enough night! Just your little diapers’ll be fine.” He drove the point home with a playfully light smack of each boy’s cushioned rear before unleashing a mini barrage of tickles upon the boys.<br />
<br />
The men-turned-toddlers each giggled helplessly, their attempts to bat away the big man’s hands proving just as adorable as they were futile.<br />
<br />
Finally, Wes let up, only to immediately scoop both boys up, ushering each to Nick’s bed, which they had both shared just a couple of nights ago. Memories of that night returned to Clark as the boys were laid down onto the bed… how soothing it had been to be held by his regressed roommate and how frustrating it was that neither could attain the release they so desired. Now, though, they wouldn’t even dream of such mature late-night excursions. <br />
<br />
Wes, taking off his shirt, returned to the bathroom. Before closing the door, he turned back to the boys. “I’ll be out in a few, you two! Daddy’s just gonna clean up for bedtime with his little guys!” He shut the door behind him, affording his baby neighbors a brief moment of privacy.<br />
<br />
Nick laid back on his pillow, feeling refreshed and revitalized after his bath with Clark. He grew mournful that this would likely be his last night being taken care of in this capacity, especially by this young, handsome neighbor of theirs. Moreover, little Nick had come to realize that perhaps he was a bit too excited by the sexual frustration that stemmed inherently from being a 28-year-old man trapped in a 2-year-old’s body. He knew, though, that Clark did not share this fascination, at least in the same capacity. It was clear to him that Clark savored the chance to be looked after, as he had almost always played the role of the protector, at least in his friendship with Nick, but Clark’s sex life was much livelier than Nick’s, and to be deprived of that in such a humiliating way must take some toll over time. Nick reached over for Clark’s shoulder and pulled the boy down to the pillow with him.<br />
<br />
Clark’s body landed softly on the pillow, and he, too, laid back, watching the ceiling fan whir around as the sound of Wes showering emanated from the bathroom.<br />
<br />
“Cwark,” Nick said softly, “Fanks for wetting me make you widdle, even if it did end up being a cwazy weekend.”<br />
<br />
“Welw, if I remembuh wight, you kinda did it wiffout asthking first,” Clark endearingly countered, squeezing Nick’s hand reassuringly.<br />
<br />
Nick turned away shyly, feeling a wave of guilt for his rash decision making. “Oh… yeah. Das wight… Sowwy dude… If I’m bein honest, I did kinda wanna see you as a widdle boy again.”<br />
<br />
Clark extended a playful slap to Nick’s arm. “You coulda made me big again aftuh you saw me bein widdle! I was wealwy horny dat day!” he teased.<br />
<br />
In response, Nick indignantly stuck his tongue out. “Fine. I gueth we can juss chalk it up as wevenge for da tighty whities!”<br />
<br />
The two laughed, and Clark brought Nick in for a hug, using the opportunity to kiss the other boy’s forehead. Clark responded, “Yah welw, I bet you wisth you were old enough fuh tighty whities now, huh?” Nick laughed and returned a gentle, “Mmmhmm” with an accompanying nod before their jovial reprieve was disturbed by the bathroom door opening.<br />
<br />
“Sthpeaking of tighty whities,” Clark whispered to Nick, fully aware that he’d be more apt to appreciate the sight of a freshly showered Wes, adorned in only his white briefs, exiting the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Nick quickly rolled over to behold the burly man that towered right over him. Just as quickly, Wes had picked up the boys just enough to move them across the bed. “Okay, boys, just gonna scooch your diapered little butts over there to make room for daddy!”<br />
<br />
In no time, the two had been swept over to the other pillow, and Wes had positioned himself on his side, facing the boys, one hefty arm lain over the two of them, cementing his role as their guardian.<br />
<br />
“Everybody cozy?” Wes inquired, moving his hand from Nick to Clark to give each of their diapered butts a loving squeeze.<br />
<br />
Nick replied, “Yah! Nithe and cothy,” and he scooted closer to Wes’s hairy chest. “Fanks for taking care of uth sinth we’we too widdle to take care of ouwselves,” and with that, Nick hugged the man’s arm that dutifully secured him in place.<br />
<br />
“Aww, Nicky,” Wes answered tenderly, “anything for my little boys!” Another pass of his hand from one boy to the other carried with it a gentle tousle of each boy’s freshly cleaned hair. “I won’t lie, it’s definitely a lot of work having to go get supplies and everything, but it’s a lot easier knowing it’s all temporary.”<br />
<br />
Clark playfully rebutted, tapping his little fingers on the big arm that made him feel even littler than he already felt. “Welw if ith’s too much work to go out and get shtuff, you coulda just borrowed some of my cwothes ya know?”<br />
<br />
“Well, little man,” Wes opposed, booping the boy’s nose, “I already tried your boxers on yesterday, and all I have to say is a man needs support, Clarky. Real men wear briefs.”<br />
<br />
“Nuh uh,” scoffed Clark. “Bwiefs are fuh widdle boys, Weth. Boxuhs are fuh men!” the toddler proudly proclaimed.<br />
<br />
“Hmmmm,” Wes mockingly pondered, “well in either case, you’re only wearing a diaper right now, so what does that make you, Clarky-poo?” Wes grabbed onto the front of Clark’s diaper and gave it a gentle squeeze to drive his point home.<br />
<br />
Softly and adorably, Clark hit Wes’s hand away. “Yah, yah, whatevuh: I’m a baby, I get it, Weth.”<br />
<br />
“That you are, sweet boy.” Wes said, leaning over Nick to give the argumentative tot a little kiss.<br />
<br />
Clark blushed, and he wondered, in that very moment, how it was that he could feel so endeared to this man who had been but a thorn in his side up until very recently. With every endearing kiss and loving, fatherly gesture, Clark’s masculine ego melted away to further unveil a burgeoning soft spot for Wes’s caretaking.<br />
<br />
“Ummm, Weth,” Clark peeped.<br />
<br />
Wes caressed both boys’ heads before responding, “What’s up, little guy?”<br />
<br />
“Welw… when dith is ovuh… do you fink maybe… ummm… we could do dith again evewy now an den…?” Clark meekly requested, clearly embarrassed for even asking.<br />
<br />
The burly cop was shocked at what he was hearing, his mouth moderately agape. “Clark,” he addressed him now without the babytalk, “are you sure?” He paused. “I mean, I---I really like this… being a temporary dad and all… since I never really got the chance myself, but… you’d really wanna do this more? Like a weekend back in diapers here and there?”<br />
<br />
Nick rolled over to face Clark now. He reassured him, “Cwark, I can do it wiff you! Ith not too bad bein widdle. And diapuhs aren’t too bad if it’s onwy fuh a day or two! I could even be your big bwo, too, and jus be wike nine. Or maybe even widdwer wike five!”<br />
<br />
“Nick…” Clark whimpered, his heart warmed by the proposition, “yah, okay! Ith a deal Weth. But onwy evwy now and den. I’m stiww a man aftuh all.”<br />
<br />
Wes reached over once more to squeeze Clark’s diapered little butt. “That you are, sweet boy. That you are.”<br />
<br />
With an exciting future planned for the three, all that was left was to restore things back to normal in the morning, as Wes had promised, and the big man snuggled closer to his precious little neighbors and held them closely as all three drifted off to sleep.</p>
