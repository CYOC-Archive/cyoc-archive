<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">So, with the remote in his pocket, Cody left the pool by his house and he strolled over to the popular sports bar, which was located just over a mile from his house. It was late afternoon already, so the place was rather crowded. Also, the sports bar was close to a large section of college housing, so a big group of college students liked to come there and hang out in the evenings since the place had a dozen big flat screen TV’s hanging on every wall, every TV tuned in to a different sports channel. <br />
<br />
Cody quietly strolled into the sports bar and he took a seat close to the main bar area, where he could still see the bar and the dining area. He was also sitting near the entrance to the kitchen, so the waiting staff walked right by him to deliver the food to their customers. <br />
<br />
There was a young waitress there. Her name was Madison, but everyone called her Maddie. She stopped by Cody’s table and she took his order. He just asked for some lemonade and an order of nachos. <br />
<br />
Right after Cody had received his order of nachos, four college guys walked in and sat at a table close by, they were loud and obnoxious. They shouted for the waiter to come over, and poor Maddie was the one who ended up serving them. Two of the college guys were tall and skinny, but the other two were slightly bigger and more overweight. All four of them ordered beers to drink and a large basket of nachos. Then, they all wanted plates with spicy chicken wings to eat while they watched their favorite sporting programs on the large TV screens. <br />
<br />
Poor Maddie was constantly running from the kitchen to the dining room, responding to the shouts and loud commands coming from the rowdy college students at that table. Especially the two bigger students, who kept on asking for refills of their beer mugs. Maddie couldn’t refill their mugs fast enough. <br />
<br />
The students all ordered the all-you-can-eat chicken wings, so Maddie also had to run to the kitchen with clean plates filled with new, fresh batches of chicken wings. The four students were eating them very fast. Finally, in the end, the students got up and paid, leaving behind a table which was a complete mess. <br />
<br />
Of course, it was Maddie who had to pick up all the trash, consisting of dirty napkins everywhere, including on the floor, spilled ketchup and mustard, on the table and on the floor, spilled drinks and all the dirty plates and silverware. She had to clear everything off the table, wipe the table down, mop the floor, and finally set the table again with clean plates and silverware so that it was ready for the next group of customers. This had to be done at lightning speed, or else her boss would get angry at her. <br />
<br />
Finally, Maddie sat down on a chair near the entrance to the kitchen. She had to take a break. She turned to Carol, who was one of her colleagues, who was also feeling exhausted at the time. <br />
<br />
“These college guys are such slobs. They come in here, sit down, they eat and drink all they want, they watch TV, and then they get up and leave. Why can’t I be a big, tall, fat college kid, like some of these boys? Instead, here I am, a short, skinny girl in high school, and I’m working my butt off as a waitress in a sports bar!” she groaned. “I’m overworked and underpaid…”<br />
<br />
“Aww, Maddie… It’ll be alright… I hear ya” Carol said to her, trying to console her. <br />
<br />
“Uhh… I need a smoke break…” Maddie sighed, as she grabbed her pack of cigarettes and walked outside. She stood outside near the back door to the restaurant, when Cody walked up to her from behind. Cody had overheard the conversation between her and the other girl, and he needed a few minutes to change the settings on the remote. When he finally had it right, he aimed the remote at her and pressed the button. He zapped her just as she was inhaling the cigarette smoke, and he quickly walked off, so she didn’t notice. <br />
<br />
When Maddie was done, she felt an incredible urge to go back to the bathroom inside of the sports bar. Once inside, she was overcome by an intense tingling sensation, all over her body. She moaned loudly as her limbs started to grow at a tremendous rate! Her legs grew longer and became thick and chubby. Her arms inflated as well, but as they became longer, they also formed layers of fat. Her stomach grew and grew, and she gained weight rapidly. Her long hair changed, and she now had short hair on her head. On the other hand, she began to grew hair on her chin and she grew a moustache! What was going on?<br />
<br />
“Ackkk!” Maddie gasped as her voice became deeper and deeper. Her torso widened and she just became bigger all over. She ripped out of her clothes completely, due to the amazing growth spurt. She felt awkward and bloated, because she had suddenly become so heavy and big. Not only that, but she had gained at least 6 inches in height as well. Lastly, she had an incredible urge to drink some alcohol right now. <br />
<br />
Carol, her other coworker, walked into the women’s bathroom when Maddie called out to her. <br />
<br />
“Carol! Please help me! Get me some clothes!” <br />
<br />
“Who are you?” Carol asked her. <br />
<br />
“It’s me! Maddie! Something happened to me! Help me!!” Maddie pleaded with her. <br />
<br />
Carol hesitated at first, but she clearly remembered seeing Maddie walk into the bathroom, so she complied. <br />
<br />
Carol quickly found some old clothes in a spare closet and she handed them to Maddie. While Maddie was busy getting dressed, she discovered one more change. <br />
<br />
“Holy shit! I’m a guy! I’ve changed into a MAN! What the hell happened?” HE gasped, as he examined his reflection in the mirror. He saw right away that his vagina was gone, and it had been replaced with a cock and balls. Also, the breasts were gone, and he now had a flat chest. <br />
<br />
“Maddie! You… You look like one of those college guys, now!” Carol said to him as he stumbled out of the bathroom. <br />
<br />
Just then, three college guys walked in and sat down. They ordered beers and chicken wings, and they were enjoying themselves at the table. Maddie walked up to them. <br />
<br />
“Hey, guys! Mind if I join you?” he said, as he sat down on the empty chair and joined them. <br />
<br />
This time, Carol was the one who had to serve the rowdy group of college guys. Once more, they all ordered beers and chicken wings. They all made a lot of noise, and they all left behind a terrible mess at the table once they got up, paid and left. All, but one. That one college guy, Maddie, he was very neat. His plate was clean, and the silverware and napkin were on the dirty plate. His side of the table was clean, and nothing was spilled on the table or on the floor. For once Carol got to serve a college kid who was neat, for a change.</p>
