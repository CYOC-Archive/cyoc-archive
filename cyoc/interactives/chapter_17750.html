<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You decide to spend the rest of the night at home; you’ll go shopping for new clothes tomorrow. You order a pizza from a local delivery place and relax in front of the TV while you wait. You are unaware of the fact that your hand has started to rub your little paunch of its own violation. Your very tight underwear pull even more as your member starts to tent them out in the front. You sigh happily when you hear the pizza guys knock at the door, and you bound to your feet.<br />
<br />
Your paunch sways slightly as you walk to the door and you realize your briefs are about to tear off. You glance down at yourself, and quickly pull your bathrobe about your shoulders. You tie it as best you can around your expanded waistline before getting the door. You are surprised to see one of your friends from the local bar, his muscled form clearly outline in his pizza uniform. He stares at you in shock; his expression says that he clearly recognizes you and the changes that have occurred.<br />
<br />
“What the hell happened to you? Are you having an allergic reaction or something?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, um, something like that,” you mumble as Chuck closes the door behind himself. He then deposited three large pizzas on the small table next to the door before taking his hat and coat off. You take them from him politely, though he must have recognized the confused expression on your face as he started to chuckle.<br />
<br />
“I just finished my shift and saw that you ordered some pizza, so I grabbed a couple extra pies and thought that maybe we could hang out. Don‘t worry,” he said as he sees your check in hand, “I paid the bill already.” You remember that he had always been after you in the past and the only thing that had kept you from hooking up was the fact that you were with Dan. You see him staring at your engorged package which is poking out from between the flaps of your bathrobe. “I hope your hungry, I know I am,” he says as picks up the pizzas again.<br />
<br />
The sun had set while you had been talking and had plunged your living room into darkness, the flashing colors of the television the only light in the room. You motion Chuck to take a seat next to you on the couch, as you pull the pizzas onto the coffee table in front of you. You find the idea of awakening your inner beast again somehow exciting, as you pull a slice to your mouth.<br />
<br />
Chuck nonchalantly places his right hand on your left thigh as he pulls a slice to his mouth. As you chew you find it harder and harder to resist the urge to stuff yourself with food, your will crumbling by the moment. Fortunately Chuck preempts you as he slides off the couch and onto the floor. You slide your ass over, straddling his tight body with your legs as he pulls the pizzas onto the couch next to you. Kneeling over you his six pack abs rubs against your dick as he pushes two slices into your mouth.<br />
<br />
“I’m not usually into big guys, but there’s something about you, something primal. Hmm, I have wanted to do this for so long.” Chuck runs his hands down your belly and pulls the straining briefs down enough to expose your throbbing cock. You moan in pleasure as you continue to eat, his tongue running over the shaft of your dick.<br />
<br />
You notice that your fingers are starting to fuse together as you shovel piece after piece of pizza into your emerging snout. “I had no idea you were so hairy!” Chucks says as he rubs his hands over your growing gut before dropping his mouth down to finish his meal. This time you revel in the change as it happens, the feeling of soft bristles emerging from your skin every bit as heady as the blowjob you are receiving.<br />
<br />
Finally sated after finishing off the second pizza, you groan happily and look down at Chuck. His head is just a silhouette in front of the TV screen and you notice two fuzzy points have started to emerge out from the top of his scull. You smile to yourself as you snort in pleasure, your tusks emerging from your enlarged snout. You feel his mouth shift, becoming longer and more narrow.<br />
<br />
“Let’s take this into my room,” you say, your voice thick with promise. You flip off the TV as you stand, plunging the room into total darkness. You don’t quite want to reveal yourself to him yet. Chuck giggles as you push him ahead of you, your furry belly rubbing against his back as you move. You strip off your bathrobe as you go, the shreds of your briefs drifting off of your meaty thighs as you waddle across the room.<br />
<br />
Your belly bounces as you waddle, rubbing against your dick with each step. You are so horny that you can hardly stand it, your tail swishing behind you in anticipation. You pull Chuck’s pants down before he sits down on the edge of your bed. You crawl onto the bed next to him, the spring groaning under your weight. He crawls over to you as he pulls your cock once more into his mouth. You do likewise, pulling his meat into your long snout.<br />
<br />
You pull your thick hooves around his thighs, noticing as you do that they are covered in fur. Your hooves grip his fur covered as tight as you feel a large tail emerge from his backside, the sensation overpowering him as he orgasms down your throat. Chucks throbbing dick rubs against your tusks as you spasm in your own discharge. You pull free, your large gut jiggling as you lay panting on your back. Chuck laughs in exhaustion as he lies next to you.<br />
<br />
“Woo, that was great!” He says as he sits up. “Wow, you’re huge!” Even in the dark room he can make out the giant curve of your massive furry belly. You snort as you roll onto your feet and waddle over to the night stand. He laughs again as he says, “You snort like a hog.”<br />
<br />
“That’s because I am one,” you say as you flip on the light, illuminating your massive form. You blink as you look down your snout at the large chubby raccoon that sits on your bed, his large tail wagging behind him. His muzzle is wide open in shock as he takes you all in. You sit back down on your bed, your tail swishing anxiously. “Looks like I’m not the only one who’s on the tubby side,” you joke, softly poking your hoof into his belly.<br />
<br />
“What the hell did you do to me?” He growls, jumping up and looking into the full length mirror on the wall. He is now a little larger than you were before this last change, and his paunch sways slightly against his still inflated member. His tail is also wagging in agitation, as he examines himself. You wait for a minute before you speak, letting him get a hold of the situation.<br />
<br />
“It’s some sort of curse. Ever since this morning, whenever I let my baser instincts get the better of me I change. It seems to spread to anyone I have sex with. You will change back, but every time you change in the future you will find that your human shape will be more and more like your animal form.” You snort as you sigh, dropping your head. “I’m really sorry, but this passion just takes over. I really didn’t mean for this to happen to you.”<br />
<br />
Chuck’s masked face softens as he looks at you in the mirror. He shambles over to the bed and sits back down next to you, placing his three fingered paw on your broad back, his fat ‘coon tail wraps about your prodigious ass. “I’m sorry I reacted like that. It’s really not that big of a deal. It‘s no as though it were permanent,” he grins at you, his ears perked forward. “I’ll just have to watch myself until we find some sort of cure.”<br />
<br />
You spent the rest of the night cuddling up against Chuck, your fingers probing his body as you fall asleep. The next morning you say goodbye to him as he heads off to work, and you head out to pick up some new clothes. You are now up to over 240 lbs and your overalls are starting to fit a bit your expanded waistline better. Your pointed ears are clearly visible and as you walk down the street you get several Vulcan hand greetings.</p>
