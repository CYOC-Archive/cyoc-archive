<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>I decided to call my brother on the phone, knowing that he has always envisioned things to be different in the world. Now the world would be his to mold, as well as my own.</br>
<br>I walk over to the cordless phone hanging on the wall next to the sliding glass door which lead out to my balcony, overlooking the entire city, picking it up to see if I could get a hold of him. I know that the best bet would be to just call his home. It is very fortunate for me that he lives a few floors below, that he works from home and is there most of the time. As I dial the number, I could hear the tone of the ringer travel through the ventilation shaft, as well as his rising to answer.</br>
<br>"Nate here." He said it with enthusiasm, hoping it would be a client returning his phone call or a new client referred to him by other clients.</br>
<br>"Hey bro, it's just me. Are you busy?"</br>
<br>"Oh... hey David, no I am not really. It sucks too, business is kinda slow right now. Why... what's up?"</br>
<br>"That is too bad. I was just wondering if you could come upstairs because I think I just completed that new tech stuff I have been working on. I think it is working, but I am not sure, so I could use another pair of eyes to help me determine if it is or not."</br>
<br>"Wow... you are done with your project huh? Sure, I would love to come up there and give you a hand. I am really bored up here and I have been waiting for something to do."</br>
<br>"Great... I will see you in a few seconds</br>
<br><center>***</center></br>
<br>I hang up the phone, replace it back on the holder and walk over to the door, unlocking it so Nate could walk right in. As soon as the latch clicks over and I turn around to sit on the large, plush, leather sofa, Nate knocks on the door. I continue to walk to my desired destination, speaking up and over my right shoulder.</br>
<br>"Come on in bro, it's open!"</br>
<br>Nate opens the door, then closes it softly behind him, while locking it, just in case there was a nosy neighbor wanting to be nosy and walk in on them. Nate walks toward me as I sit down on the sofa, I smile as he greets me with a brotherly hello.</br>
<br>"Hey David! So where is this machine you wanted me to help ya out with?"</br>
<br>"Well... it's in the next room, but I want to explain how it works real quick, before we go and try it out."</br>
<br>"Explain away, but don't bore me with techno-babble as you know, I won't know what you are talking about."</br>
<br>"Sure thing Nate, it is actually pretty simple. This machine I built makes whatever you want in the world to come true. Anything you could imagine will become reality. You have full and total control over whatever happens. It just requires two people to make it work. I guess it's an unintended safety protocol, ensuring that more than one person is okay with the change."</br>
<br>"You are bullshitting me aren't you?"</br>
<br>"Nope, not at all. Come on, let's check it out and I will show you."</br>
<br>I get up and head toward the seemingly empty room, which was intended to be a guest bedroom, but I decided against it when I started developing the machine, just because I would be able to manipulate reality if it worked, then I would just add more on, thus changing the size of the entire building. As I reach the threshold of the door, I look over my shoulder and see that he is in disbelief, hesitating to get up and/or fulfill whatever weird fantasy world I concocted. I turned around and motioned with my head for him to get up. Hesitant as ever, he gets up slowly and walks over to me. I smiled once again, happy that my bro was willing to help his brother out, no matter how Nate might have felt about what was requested. Turning around, Nate following now close behind, we enter the barren room, having only the machine in it's center.</br>
<br>The machine was as tall as the ceiling of the room, linking and grounding it to the world around them, which... if commanded to, it would send out it's emitted waves and nano-bots to do whatever the user wanted. In the center was a somewhat large sized door, just to be able to fit a larger sized person, just in case I wanted to help them to change their life and reality. On the exterior on the right side is the computer console, which accessed the machine, turning it on and activating the user's desired change by simply clicking <b>"Accept"</b></br>
<br>I walk over to the machine and stand near the console, while Nate does a quick walk around and once over. Nate just shrugs, not really thinking anything about it, but also somewhat puzzled at how it was supposed to do what I told him.</br>
<br>"So how is this thing supposed to work David?"</br>
<br>"I need you to stand in that doorway in the middle, then I will turn on the machine and then you need to think of something you would like to change"</br>
<br>"Dude, I have no idea what I should change!"</br>
<br>"Well then, how 'bout I help you out with that. One thing that I am ensuring is that whoever is operating the machine on both ends is ok with what either wants to change. You have to say out loud what it is you want, before the person operating the computer clicks <b>'Accept'</b> That way the computer knows what you want and you can't make a change last minute the other person is not okay with."</br>
<br>"That was a great idea bro, cuz' I was wonderin' what would happen if either of us changed something in thought, without even knowing it or not."</br>
<br>"Precisely! Now one simple small thing we could change that would immediately show itself would be something that affected either of our locations, appearances, or an item that wouldn't be in the room before you wanted it there."</br>
<br>"Got it! Well... because this is a test, I think we should start off kinda small, so... I am thinkin' of having something artsy added to the room. I know how you have always enjoyed the male form, especially since I've known you to be gay as early as our teenage years, while you looked at a magazine you got from an older gay man, full of firemen type guys. We both share that quality, as I realized a few years back when I remembered taking a look at what you thought was hidden and getting my first boner from it. Even when I thought about it then, as well as now, I get a boner from it. Another thing, which you've known we both share, is the idea of werewolves and other were-creatures. So how about we have a fully colored, anthro male bear statue, with a huge and human cock." As he finished the statement, I leaned forward to see a wide grin on his face as well as a tenting in his pants.</br>
<br>I smiled, half in delight as I never knew my brother was gay like me, especially since he just "came out" to me and half-enthralled as Nate had a nice touch about him, knowing that things would go exceptionally easy since they both shared taste in things and now lifestyle. "Sure thing Nate! That is a real nice request and something we will both enjoy seeing!"</br>
<br>I clicked <b>"Accept"</b> and the machine began emitting a low and barely audible hum. Slowly a small blur was being created, gaining size from being a slight orb to being a large ovalish blur, touching the floor beneath them as something was beginning to form in the room, a few feet in front of where Nate was standing within the machine. The blur stabilized in form, then began to focus, sharpening to begin making out what was being brought into their space of reality. As it finished, we both looked on in astonishment.</br>
<br>The statue was of an anthro-bearman having huge features. It's hands were paws which had human features and it's claws extended, it's forearms were of normal size to fit the rest of it's body, the biceps were 15" around, it's chest was 46" wide, a small bearish gut which didn't take away from or cover-up any other larger features, it's cock was a massive 12" long and 6" across from side to side, with a nicely shaped mushroom head, balls the size of baseballs, it's thighs were as massive as tree trunks, it's calves were an adequate size to hold up the massive beast, it's feet were normal sized anthro-male bear paws with it's claws also extended. The last thing to show was the color of it's fur. On the paws, both hands and feet, up the legs and calves, also along the forearms and biceps, creeping up it's trapezius's(neck muscles), around the neck to the base of it's bear head, along it's cheeks, continuing up the back of the head to it's round ears and head hair. It's human-like hair was medium length, styled fanning out from a center part, spiked and standing just above it's ears. The fur around it's muzzle was a golden brown, with a black colored goatee. The fur from the base of it's neck was a lighter brown with a reddish tint, covering it's entire chest, and down it's tummy, continuing down to it's balls and around the base of it's cock. The color of the cock was of a Caucasian male's beige flesh tone. </br>
<br>I looked on, happily I might add, never expecting it to come out in such detail. I tried to hide my enthusiasm, but it broke through anyway. "Nice going there Nate! Very nice indeed!"</br>
<br>"Thanx bro, I just thought about how it would look without saying anything while just asking for it as I said. On top of that though, I was really trying to push the limits of the machine and I guess it really can do whatever the user thinks up."</br>
<br>"Well... I told you didn't I? Well since that was really a freebie, what do want to happen next?"</br></p>
