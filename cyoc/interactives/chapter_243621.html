<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Daniel couldn’t help but feel sad as Sumire was silent through out the journey back to their room. Things seems to be silent as they got back to the room and went about the rest of the day. It was when they both decide to help give Henry a bath that Daniel decided to get some answers.<br />
<br />
“You know you’ve been awfully silent since we left restaurant. Care to explain what’s got you bothered? Daniel ask as he was scrubbing Henry in the bathtub trying so hard not to look at Sumire who was standing nearby. She had taken off her top and she was now wearing just her skirt, underwear, and her bra.<br />
<br />
“It’s just I expected better for my colleagues. Especially how boastful for Nathan was about how the Terrible Twos could never get a fast one on him.” Sumire commented as she crossed her arms beneath her chest. They neither know this, but both were glad that one was not looking at the other.<br />
<br />
“Yeah I can’t help a feel sorry for Pauline and what Mr. Cameron has done to her.” Daniel said only for Sumire to put a hand on his shoulder. Daniel was trying too hard not to resist the urge to look over his shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Hey don’t be like that Mr. Cameron, despite his gruff interior and look when he was older actually does care. He is a gentleman through and through plus he is  especially has a fond spot for Asians. If anything, Pauline and Madison are to blame for their current situation.” Sumire said as soon as she was finished, she took her hand off his shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Then how come Pauline was acting like that, she acted like she has always been 35 years old and a teacher?” Ask Daniel but rather than immediately answering, Daniel heard the sounds of what seems to be the medicine cabinet opening up in a pill bottle being lifted. Sumire then poke Daniel’s shoulder, which they established was a signal of switch partners. Daniel stood up and was handed the bottle while Sumire got down on her knees and start scrubbing Henry. Daniel looked at the bottle title.<br />
<br />
“Reality Suppressant.” Daniel read before turning the bottle on his back and reading the rest. “ Memories of two realities bothering you? Take two of these pills as is or dissolved in water and the memories that you had when you first entered the resort will suppress for 6 hours allowing you to enjoy what other memories you have. Warning: Any memories of age changing prior to taking these suppressants will also be suppress as well please exercise caution.”<br />
<br />
“He probably tricked her into taking that once they aged up to 35 years old. It’s also used in the normal restaurants drinks called Moothies.” Sumire commented. This stuck a cord in Daniel as he remembered something about dinner, how Thomas had two drinks while everyone else had one drink.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit, Ms. Carter did the same thing to Thomas. This explains why he was so lovey-dovey with her, in his new memories/reality they are a boyfriend and girlfriend. With this, they just suppress his old memories and…” Daniel exclaimed in trail off.<br />
<br />
“Allow Stephanie to enjoy her time with her ‘roommate’.” Sumire commented as she started washing Henry’s hair. Daniel noted that her tone was more bitter towards Ms. Carter than it was towards Mr. Cameron. He then put the pill bottle back into the medicine cabinet.<br />
<br />
“Do you think they would allow the effects to wear off?” Daniel ask remembering the back of the pill bottle saying the effects only lasted six hours. This got a laugh out of Sumire who finished rinsing Henry’s hair.<br />
<br />
“It would be awkward in the morning. I would imagine Mr. Cameron allowing that to happen. Would get Pauline quite a shocked.” Sumire said with a laugh at the end. Daniel visualizing what type of scenario will carry out, laughed as well before he noticed that she gain a serious look. “Stephanie I’m not too sure. If anything, she probably would continue doping him so she can have her way this entire trip.”<br />
<br />
<b>Later</b><br />
<br />
The impromptu couple just tucked in Henry to bed, Daniel wearing underwear and sleep pants designed to go topless while Sumire wore just a bra and underwear. As soon as Henry fell asleep, they quietly snuck out of his room. To Sumire’s surprise, Daniel followed her to the master bedroom and joined her in bed.<br />
<br />
“I know something is bothering you. What’s wrong?” Ask Daniel admiring her body. Sumire gave a sigh knowing that Daniel is inquisitive and would not drop the subject.<br />
<br />
“The only reason we teachers are here is to limit any potential Wainwright Incident. It’s just Mr. Cameron and me seem ideal teachers to do this. But Ms. Carter… I don’t know.” Sumire confessed.<br />
<br />
“Wait Wainwright as in Principal Wainwright?” Ask Daniel. Sumire nodded and took a breath as if she was gonna spill big secret.<br />
<br />
“Yes last year Principal Wainwright came to this resort with some students. It was during the week where the school was dealing with the whole Junior Prom/Seth Collins fiasco.” Sumire said.<br />
<br />
“Wait a minute when he left with high school Senior Taylor Keith and Junior Victor Davis?” Daniel interrupted. Sumire gave a snort as she was going to reveal something big.<br />
<br />
“Actually it was him and two of every students class. Two seniors, two juniors, two sophomores, and two freshman; the best and smartest from each class.” Sumire answered which confused Daniel before she gave a laugh. “I wouldn’t be surprised if you didn’t remember the others. This resort has a unique function that if you leave, the property changed then reality changes around them to fit their new changes. That’s why you don’t remember them.”<br />
<br />
“OK that would make sense but how were you and the rest of the teaching staff made aware?” Daniel asked.<br />
<br />
“It started out odd we got calls from parents that at first we didn’t think their children were enrolled or they miscalled. However, then we got calls from parents of Victor and Taylor asking where their children were and they were a week overdue from returning. So Vice Principal Lowell dispatched two teachers to get answers out of the resort. Now the resort was used to situations where extended stay happen due to out of control change, but this was kind of the first time that someone came and check up so they were open to helping us. And boy was a bad.”<br />
<br />
“How bad was it?”<br />
<br />
“It turned out six students walked off the premises changed as a result reality became permanent. A freshman and a junior became animals and were sent off to live at a ranch. A cow and a horse respectively.”<br />
<br />
“Holy cow.” Daniel joked before Sumire continue.<br />
<br />
“The other freshman left double the age originally entered as with a person they met at the resort. They were originally five times their age, but age down to match their new age. So they left as a newly couple which goes to the same for the two sophomores who aged up and left as a couple.”<br />
<br />
“Then that’s rude runoff with their true loves and never look back.” Daniel joked again, causing Sumire to laugh until she got serious again.<br />
<br />
“The other senior came from a broken home, and I don’t know if this counts as kidnapping. But apparently a couple learned of this and tricked the senior into becoming unborn in the woman’s womb and they walked out.”<br />
<br />
“Where was Principal Wainwright during all this?”<br />
<br />
“Apparently he felt victim to mental change and as a result, he was un-conceived by three generations. It took the resort stuff hours to track down the right people and have those generations plus the principal restored. Even after that Taylor and Victor refused to leave unless they were allowed to leaved changed.”<br />
<br />
“Wait what?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah turns out Taylor was originally a boy, and Victor was originally called Victoria. Given the fact we lost 3/4 of the students that came here we had to given to their demands.”<br />
<br />
There was silence for a few moments.<br />
<br />
“That is a lot to take in.” Daniel finally said.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, but it pushed principal Wainwright to negotiate with the resort that the adults from our school must have an immunity to mental change if they wanted our continued patronage. Then the teachers with good moral compass was selected to supervise the trip this time around to limit potential incidents now I feel we could just be adding more.” Sumire said about to go on a triage before Daniel gave her a hug which surprised her.<br />
<br />
“Don’t think too hard after all I’m glad we’re assigned together plus, didn’t you say you wanted to experience a few things?” Daniel asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes.” Sumire answered remembering when she confessed to Daniel while they were watching Henry at the toddler park.<br />
<br />
“Then feel free to do it. I’ll support you every step of the way.” Daniel said, kissing her on the cheek. Sumire just swoon.<br />
<br />
“You know just what to say to me, Daniel.” Sumire smiled before Daniel yawned and slipped under the covers.<br />
<br />
“Goodnight. Sumire.” Daniel said as his head hit the pillow and fell asleep. Sumire couldn’t help, but smiled as she too got under covers and turned off the light.<br />
<br />
“Goodnight.” Sumire said as she fell asleep as well.</p>
