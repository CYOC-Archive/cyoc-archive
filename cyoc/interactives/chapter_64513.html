<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan Standish was happy.  He was enrolled at the same college as Vinnie Cost and they were going to be <br />
roommates.  He was a bit miffed that Dylan had tagged along.  Ryan realized it was his own fault. He knew his <br />
brotherly admiration for Dylan and his love or lust for Vinnie were leaking through into Vinnie's psyche. Ryan <br />
knew too that Dylan liked hanging with his brother, even if his brother was his boyfriend's jockstrap.  <br />
<br />
Dylan knew it was a bit fucked up.  He knew Ryan loved Vinnie, but didn't know how to express it - except by <br />
becoming whatever Vinnie wished. He really thought he was helping Ryan out, but making sure Vinnie had Dylan <br />
as his boyfriend.  He figured, he could step aside when Ryan was ready, or they could keep sharing.  <br />
<br />
Vinnie flexed in front of the dorm room mirror.  He looked hot and buff in just his jockstrap and muscle tee <br />
shirt.  He knew that Ryan was his jockstrap and that Dylan was his muscle tee.  It had been a fucking wild <br />
summer. He had worn the brothers nearly every day. He actually thought of them as a matched set.  It had made <br />
moving up here to college easier.  Most of his old clothes no longer fit his muscled frame, and what he had <br />
fit into his backpack.  He had ridden up here on Dylan's motorcycle while wearing the Standish brothers. He <br />
thought it was all his idea.  He had figured out that Dylan and Ryan really had the transformative powers, but <br />
he had talked them into being his clothing for three reasons.  First, they could share a single room between <br />
the three of them.  He'd wear the brothers to bed each night.  He had the best dreams when he wore those two.  <br />
Second, they discovered that when he used the brothers to absorb his cum, the two big men were not hungry when <br />
the became human again.  He promised to keep them well fed, and by the end of summer was producing six or more <br />
loads each day into his absorbent jockstrap and whatever Dylan was that day.  Dylan had been a hand towel, <br />
terry cloth shorts, a robe, a Speedo, a wet suit, a singlet, a tee-shirt, running shorts, a pair of socks, a <br />
head band, sunglasses, a towel, and chamois. He was even a necktie for Vin's interview.  It was odd, but 95% <br />
of the time, Ryan was just a jockstrap, even when Vinnie wanted him to be boxers or briefs or anything else.  <br />
He was eager to become Vinnie's leather loincloth, when Vinnie want to play Tarzan on the ropes hanging over <br />
the swimming hole at the Standish's lake cabin. <br />
<br />
It had been a long day, Vinnie had gotten his dorm room assignment and registered for his classes.  He also <br />
registered Ryan for his remedial classes and Dylan for his classes.  He had hit the gym, and jogged home <br />
without showering.  His skin was shiny with sweat.  It looked great in the mirror. It looked like his muscles <br />
were oiled. He felt his pouch tighten up, and recalled that he hadn't cum all day.  The boys must be famished <br />
he thought. His muscle shirt was tucked inside his jockstrap, so he knew they'd both absorb his load as he <br />
hopped into the single bed and started jacking off.  It had been a long day, and he came once and passed out.  <br />
He had a wonderful wet dream, and probably came another 3 times in his sleep.<br />
<br />
His alarm woke him, and he cursed.  He had slept through the first alarm, and he'd be late to class.  He <br />
pulled on his clothes and raced across campus to class. He'd buy a bicycle today or tomorrow, he decided.  He <br />
totally forgot about Ryan and Dylan.  He was so excited about his first day at class, he totally forgot that <br />
as long as he was wearing them - they couldn't attend their classes.  Dylan tried to remind him a couple <br />
times, but Ryan was happy where he was.  In fact, Dylan suspected that Ryan was helping Vin to forget about <br />
Dylan and Ryan, because he didn't want to change back.<br />
<br />
Dylan remembered that awkward conversation he had had with Ryan after Vinnie had left them to complete their <br />
college applications.<br />
<br />
&quot;How am I going to explain to the guys that I'm rooming with you and Vinnie in a single room with just a twin <br />
bed?&quot; whined Ryan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, you don't have to tell them it's a single or that you have roommates, unless you want to.  For all they <br />
know you might be sleeping in a sleeping bag on the floor to save money. Hey, that reminds me. Remember when <br />
we were kids, and you wanted to go with me when I went to Scout camp?  You made a fucking great mummy bag. <br />
Let's say we take Vinnie camping some weekend, you can be a double mummy bag for the two of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan had bit his lip and nodded.  They'd be going camping next weekend. The plan was for Dylan to ride on his <br />
motorcycle with Vinnie holding on to his waist.  Ryan would be in the pack on Vinnie's back.  Of course, if <br />
they missed a few days of school, Ryan and Dylan might not be able to go, as they would have to catch up. <br />
Dylan concentrated at Ryan and Vinnie.<br />
<br />
Vinnie was in the Starbuck's Men's Room pissing at the urinal when he realized he was still wearing Dylan and <br />
Ryan.  It was four o'clock in the afternoon.  Vinnie had changed into his Barrista uniform and was just about <br />
to begin his shift.  He said sorry guys, and promised to take them off when he got home.<br />
<br />
It was after midnight when he got home. He fell asleep still wearing his uniform. In the morning, the alarm <br />
woke him. He was late again, but he had to change into fresh clothes, and he remembered to take Ryan and Dylan <br />
off. Then he left.<br />
<br />
Dylan changed back first, and to Ryan's surprise, he put Ryan on. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bro, I'm going to enjoy wearing you for the rest of the week.  Now I'll go to your remedial class first, and <br />
explain you had to take care of some family stuff this week, and I am just taking notes for you.  Then I'll go <br />
to my class, and then to your next class.  I planned my schedule around yours, so I could wear you, Ryan.&quot;<br />
<br />
He grinned and finished dressing, and then he ran to Ryan's class, and told that story to the teacher while <br />
Ryan angrily squeezed his balls. He was going to put his little bro in his place. He suddenly added, &quot;Dr. <br />
Smythe, I should tell you that Ryan may be out for two weeks, he's helping with some family business. Uh, you <br />
know helping sort out things after a death.&quot;<br />
<br />
Two weeks?  You wouldn't! Thought Ryan.<br />
<br />
Try me, Bro.  You be good, and it'll be you sitting in this class next week, not me sitting here wearing you.<br />
<br />
Vinnie felt naked all day without Ryan and Dylan.  He spent several hours in the supernatural section of the <br />
library stacks trying to decide what to do about Ryan and Dylan.  He needed them too badly. Hm, this passage <br />
looked interesting.<br />
<br />
&quot;...and Goodwife Abigail Hanson then took enchanted thread and sewed her name into the hem of the garment into <br />
which her husband had been transformed. Thus, enchanting him to eternally be her slave, by literally weaving <br />
her ownership of him into the very fabric of his being.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Enchanted thread?&quot; whispered Vinnie with an evil smile, as he adjusted his loose cock.  Damn, he missed that <br />
pouch.<br />
<br />
<br />
That night.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Ryan's already transformed?&quot; Vinnie asked when he got home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well, it'll be intimate with the two of us sharing the bed tonight, Vin,&quot; Dylan replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you're not transforming? Uh, would it be okay then if I wore Ryan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not tonight, Vin.  Tonight, it's just you and me. I made dinner,&quot; Dylan switched off the lights to reveal a <br />
candle lit dinner waiting on the window box.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, a romantic dinner for two?&quot; Vinnie was touched.<br />
<br />
By the end of the night, he was hornier and drunker that he had ever been before. Vinnie had the presence of <br />
mind to mention condoms as he and Dylan kissed. Dylan answered it wasn't necessary as long as he was wearing <br />
Ryan. That boy would absorb everything better than a condom, and besides both of them were STD free. Vinnie <br />
just nodded. He'd be sore in the morning.<br />
<br />
When Dylan woke up, Vinnie and Ryan were still asleep. He decided he was going to given Ryan any chance to <br />
escape.  So he pissed right through the pouch as he sat on the toilet and then showered while wearing Ryan.<br />
<br />
Ryan woke sputtering. Someone was pissing in him.  He instinctively absorbed the foul tasting liquid. Then he <br />
remembered Dylan was wearing him.  He was horrified when Dylan wore him in the shower, and then blow dried <br />
Ryan while still wearing him.</p>
