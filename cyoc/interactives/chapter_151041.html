<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Edward came to work late that morning and was a bit surprised to see that Frank Busard wasn&#39;t anywhere near his desk. The dull workaholic usually spent all his time in his cubicle slaving the day away. Never enjoying anything, never talking to anyone. It was almost enough to make him worry, but no, Frank just wasn&#39;t worth the effort. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mister Edward Graywood is requested in Richard Thompson&#39;s office, Mister Edward Graywood, in Richard Thompson&#39;s office.&quot;<br />
<br />
The voice ringing over the sound system made Edward jump, and he swallowed nervously, heading for the elevator. Inside, he chose the button for the highest level. While he waited, he tried to remember if he&#39;d been coming in late more often than usual lately, and couldn&#39;t tell. When the elevator doors dinged, he noticed that the secretary&#39;s desk was unmanned. With no other choice, Edward made his way into Richard Thompson&#39; office.<br />
<br />
He had only taken the first step into the room that the door closed behind him and someone popped a party cracker in his face. Startled, he tried to jump back, but more confettis and funny snakes flew in the air, almost blinding him. Cameras flashed enough time that he started to suspect a prank, when his body was hit by a sensation of weightlessness. His clothes suddenly fell off his skin, and he tripped and fell backward, like he had jumped off a cliff. He couldn&#39;t see much with the drapes hiding his surroundings, but Edward braced himself for the landing and winced when he hit the ground with his shoulder. <br />
<br />
Confettis floated down to his stunned body, drifting to cover his naked skin, as they now looked enormous for reasons he couldn&#39;t conceive. He tried to stand up, but couldn&#39;t move his arms, or legs, or... <br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t feel his limbs. At all. He couldn&#39;t move.  <br />
<br />
But he could still see, thank God. Everything seemed to have grown to enormous proportions. The ceiling was so far up ahead that it looked almost blurry, and the three pairs of shoes close to his head looked like minivans. Right there, over the desk, above the giants, a banner in bright red letter spelled out &quot;Congratulations for your promotion!&quot;<br />
<br />
Edward&#39;s brain was on the verge of completely giving up. Luckily, or not, depending on one&#39;s mood, a giant hand lowered itself from the air and closed itself around him. Around his form. His body was like a cylinder, like a tube, with two heavy weights at the bottom, like... oh God. <br />
<br />
The hand raised him to waist level with two of the giants in the room, who strangely had unbutonned their pants and pulled out their dicks. His brethrens. <br />
<br />
&quot;Congratulations, Edward Graywood!&quot; the secretary&#39;s COCK said! &quot;You&#39;ve been promoted to our new dicked division. As the CEO of the company allow me to personally welcome you to the team.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wait. That secretary&#39;s dick was Richard Thompson, aka Hardass Dick?! How?! Well, okay, no, he had a good idea about the &#39;how&#39; right now? But why was he acting like this was all a big great adventure?<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a big adjustment,&quot; the other guy&#39;s dick spoke gently, like an old pal would, and it was fucking insane! Being reduced to a penis wasn&#39;t an &#39;adjustment&#39;, it was a nightmare! &quot;Fortunately, Dad and I devised a method to help our newly changed employee. You&#39;ve been assigned an assistant that will act as your body.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frank&#39;s rough fingers stopped caressing him and twisting him around. For a second, Edward dared hope that the weird machine they were sticking to his skin might put an end to the nightmare, but all he felt was a faint sting that faded almost immediately. He didn&#39;t get much time to question it before he heard another zipper going down, the noise like a death sentence. <br />
<br />
For a long, revolting moment, Edward found himself pressed against a rock hard dick, whose head went just a little further than his own. That was humiliating as it was! But then, something even stranger happened, his body seemed to melt in the warmth of the dick&#39;s skin, his mind going blank in pure pleasure before things snapped back into place, and he was now facing two other dicks attached to two other bodies. &quot;Please... please tell me I&#39;m dreaming,&quot; he begged, wishing he had fingers to pinch himself with. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nope. You&#39;re not dreaming!&quot; Danny chuckled as if the whole thing was amusing. &quot;You are indeed a penis now! You&#39;ve got a whole life of orgasms to look forward to!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This was all a big misunderstanding!&quot; Edward pleaded, straining against Frank&#39;s shirt. &quot;I never signed up for this. I didn&#39;t want to be turned into my own penis!&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard seemed to bob up and down slightly, like someone nodding. The foreskin was pulled all the way back, highlighting the redness of the secretary&#39;s dickhead. &quot;In that case, you are out of luck, Edward.&quot; <br />
<br />
Those words sent a spike of adrenaline straight through Edward&#39;s whole cock body, and he stiffened almost painfully. &quot;W-what?&quot;<br />
<br />
Frank coughed suspiciously, as if he tried to hide a bout of laughter. <br />
<br />
&quot;The technology is experimental,&quot; explained Dick. &quot;There is no way to currently reverse the process, you see? You&#39;ll have to make due being a cock, Edward. It&#39;s not that big a deal. Your human body will do the things you used to yourself, you only have to direct them with a firm hand, so to speak.&quot;<br />
<br />
Edward lost it. He started slinging every insult he had in his vocabulary at the dickheads around him, spitting so much vitriol he had to stop and spit out clear liquid mid rant. <br />
<br />
&quot;Pfft, no initiatives, no risk takers amongst those new bloods. Take a good look, Danny. A dick that never dares and just whines won&#39;t go very far in this company. Frank, you can return to your work. We&#39;ll reveal the new workings of the department next week. This&#39;ll give your cock time to come to his senses.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, wait, please!&quot; Edward called out before being shoved down into a dark pair of boxers. Sounds began to get muffled and try as he might, rubbing himself against the fabric in hopes of somehow escaping only made his body throb and his mind hazy with lust. Fuck, that felt good. *Fuck*, that had felt good and he couldn&#39;t think like that. That&#39;s the kind of crazy talk that the CEO and his son spouted. He had to find a way to turn back to normal. <br />
<br />
&quot;Frank?&quot; he called out timidly, not wanting their colleagues to hear his voice. If they knew what had happened to him, he&#39;d never be able to show his face here again. &quot;Can you hear me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Seconds ticked by, or minutes, he could not tell, trapped in darkness with only the sound of typing high above and Frank&#39;s faint grumbling for company. Every so often, he tried calling again, but Frank either ignored him or didn&#39;t hear him. He prayed it was the latter and not him catching the crazy too. Frank was treating Edward like... like he was his cock and nothing else.  <br />
<br />
Edward&#39;s panic grew when he heard Frank call out for a bathroom break through the walls of fabric imprisoning him. <br />
<br />
The light almots blinded him when the walls fell down and he could finally breath fresh air again. But the urgency of his situation prevented him from losing time on marvelling. <br />
<br />
&quot;Frank, you can&#39;t! I&#39;m down here, that&#39;s disgust-&quot; The rest of the words never came up. <br />
<br />
Giant hands pulled on Edward&#39;s shaft and lifted him over his balls, which were readjusted over the boxers&#39; elastic. &quot;The thing is, Edward, I never could stand your voice. You better get used to being mute. I lowered your chip&#39;s volume to zero, and I don&#39;t intend to increase it anytime soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, he aimed Edward&#39;s head towards the urinals. <br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Frank sat down in his kitchen, booted up his computer and unzipped his pants. He wanted Edward to have full view of what was coming next. Frank teased the dickhead, pumping him to full length, right up to the point Edward was drooling enough pre to create a wet spot on the edge of the table. Just to make sure, FRank adjusted the angle of his laptop&#39;s screen, and clicked on the application for his emails. <br />
<br />
He typed a short message and grinned when his new cock jolted in what must be horror. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dear Richard And Son Inc.,<br />
<br />
Due to difficulties with my work environment, I have decided that work at Richard and Son inc. is not appropriate for me. I quit.&quot;</p>
