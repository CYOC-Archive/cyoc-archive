<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You began looking around and you saw a bunch of anthro animal girls standing around naked and with their wrists bound together with rope behind clear plexiglass windows. You then tried to walk and realized that there was a window directly to your front, and another to your right. There was a door behind you and there was a brick wall to your left. You looked down and realized your nudity and your wrists were bound like the others. Your body was really sexy though, DD boobs, wide hips and cushioned ass that any man could slap.<br />
<br />
You then saw an anthro weasel walk up with an anthro tiger that were fully clothed and had at least some sort of armor on. You felt your personality was different all of a sudden and your mind was being filled with Nimriel&#39;s memories. &quot;This one&#39;s been tricky to keep in check, in fact I&#39;m surprised that she&#39;s still bound. She&#39;s sassy, and had stolen a few things from time to time, and the only reason we know it was her is because we found where she hid it all. She&#39;s one tyrant of a lady, so are you sure you want her?&quot; The weasel asked and you heard them through the holes in your glass that were cut out for air.<br />
<br />
You then snorted in disgust and said,&quot;Speak for yourself weakling, I bet your customer could tear you limb from limb if he was compelled to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut it Slutty thief!&quot; The weasel said then slammed his hand on the window, and you decided to embrace Nimriel&#39;s character a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;The name is Nimriel, thank you very much. Besides the only reason I&#39;m not escaping is that I like the company here. You know besides the fact that nobody here has any spine enough to actually screw with you.&quot; You said and the door opened behind you and two really bulky bulls grabbed you and slammed you against the back wall.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the tiger roared and the bulls stopped and the weasel looked up at him. &quot;She&#39;s perfect for what I need, besides you all wouldn&#39;t want to damage your fine merchandise.&quot; The tiger said<br />
<br />
&quot;B...but, sir you do realize that she is....&quot; the weasel began but the tiger picked him up by the collar and held one of his giant claws to the weasel&#39;s throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;She is far more intelligent than you, and perceptive. She&#39;s even got the spunk to steal from her captors and scold them. So tell your men to bring her to me now, or else we can test her theory on my ability to tear you limb from limb rodent!&quot; The tiger growled then smiled with a large toothy grin. <br />
<br />
&quot;Y..yes....of course....h...how much would you like to pay?&quot; The weasel asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing at all, you said that she&#39;s been a large burden to you anyways. So you will give her to me for free, unless you appreciate your arms and legs, or maybe I should just take away what little balls you actually have.&quot; The tiger said motioning his claw down towards the weasel&#39;s pelvis.<br />
<br />
&quot;O...of c...course.&quot; The weasel said and nodded to the bulls, and the tiger threw him down onto the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, and DON&#39;T harm her.&quot; The tiger said<br />
<br />
The bulls shuddered at the tiger&#39;s words and took you around to where he was, and threw you onto the ground. You managed to take something out of one of the bull&#39;s pockets as you were thrown using Nimriel&#39;s skill. Suddenly your bindings snapped apart and the area where they did looked like it had been cut. You look to see that you had stolen a gold medallion that had a hoof forged onto it. You then heard growling and looked up in fear to see the tiger snarling, but he wasn&#39;t looking at you, he was looking at the bulls.<br />
<br />
&quot;You both just made a big mistake!&quot; The tiger roared and lunged at the bulls and slashed them both across the chest and stomach. The bulls looked at their wounds and held them to try to stop the blood, but eventually collapsed one after the other both bleeding out. The tiger then turned towards you and licked his claws clean of blood and you got up and turned towards him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you alright?&quot; The tiger asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I think nothing is broken.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, now lets go since I own you now, Nimriel was it? Let&#39;s go.&quot; The tiger asked and you nodded and the two of you began walking through a really run-down looking town. You got a number of looks since you were nude, so you covered your vagina thinking that you didn&#39;t want raped.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a shame that we aren&#39;t both mammals, or reptiles then maybe we could be together sexually.&quot; The tiger said<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m flattered by what you did, but who are you exactly?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;What makes you think I&#39;ll tell you?&quot; The tiger chuckled<br />
<br />
&quot;How about the thing that I swiped from the bulls before you attacked them.&quot; You said holding up the medallion.<br />
<br />
&quot;When did you...?&quot; The tiger said dumbfounded <br />
<br />
&quot;A thief is nothing without her tactics, if you&#39;re worried about me then just don&#39;t get on my bad side, and your stuff will be safe.&quot; You said smiling and giving the tiger the medallion.<br />
<br />
The tiger examined the medallion and smiled,&quot;You took such a weighty thing that has a reflective metal without anyone noticing. You are certainly going to work wonders for me. You&#39;ve earned to know it, so my name is Vagrex.&quot; The tiger, Vagrex said<br />
<br />
&quot;Well met, if the work involves thievery then you&#39;re in luck.&quot; You said feeling more and more of Nimriel&#39;s memories come to life.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you good at seducing?&quot; Vagrex asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh seduction is fun, especially when I come across a fool who&#39;s trying to go all the way, or thinks he&#39;s in love. That is until they figure out that their precious jewels are missing, and they usually blame the common mugger as opposed to me.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, because that&#39;s what you&#39;ll be doing for me.&quot; Vagrex said<br />
<br />
&quot;Where to? And what do I do?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Eagerness is charming from you, but you&#39;ll see, and a lady like you will have plenty of fun.&quot; Vagrex said and you continued to follow him. Vagrex took you to an area then walked into an ally and into the basement of a building. Outside the door stood a lion bouncer and he looked at you with a concerned expression until Vagrex said,&quot;She&#39;s our new worker.&quot;<br />
<br />
The lion then allowed you to pass and Vagrex opened the door for you and you entered the building, and it looked almost like a strip club with a bar, a &quot;private&quot; area with a sign saying &quot;pleasure area, a pole dancing area, and an upstairs that had a second bouncer.<br />
<br />
The second bouncer was a tiger like Vagrex, and Vagrex nodded to the bouncer and he walked the two of you upstairs. &quot;This the new girl bro?&quot; The bouncer asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, and she&#39;s better than she looks. Possibly even one of the best ones here.&quot; Vagrex said<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting, so she knows what she&#39;s going to do right?&quot; The bouncer asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I can hear you, you know, and it&#39;s kind of rude to judge someone when they&#39;re listening. Especially a lady like me.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t speak out of line.&quot; The bouncer tiger growled<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down brother, she&#39;s earned her worth, and she&#39;s no coward. This is Nimriel, and Nimriel this is my brother Werix.&quot; Vagrex said<br />
<br />
You and Werix squinted at each other, and you then spoke up,&quot;Feelings are mutual with me if they are with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Werix gave you a subtle nod, and then turned to Vagrex and said,&quot;What should we have her do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Vagrex then spoke up saying,&quot;Well, she&#39;s a professional thief and one that has experience with pickpocketing. She stole a polished gold medallion that weighs about 5 pounds as she left with me from a bull that I killed shortly after he, and his partner threw her to the ground. Also this entire building has an enchantment to prevent any and all pregnancies thanks to a previous demonic pregnant summoning by a cult, and the purification of a priest. So I think that she should.......&quot;</p>
