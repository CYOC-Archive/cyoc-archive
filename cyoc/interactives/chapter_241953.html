<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex prepared to go camping with his family for spring break, his earlier troubles had subsided and he felt like everything had left. <br />
He woke up and used the bathroom as usual, ate breakfast then packed up his bags and loaded in their van. It took 13 hours to get to their campsite. A very long drive. When they arrived Alex used the bathhouse and went to the pool. Swimming around was fun Alex thought, the sky blue, the breeze calm, smelling of salt from the nearby beach. Alex was hit in the head by a water toy suddently, hey sorry my lil brother hit you, he’s bad at aiming, said the boy, my names Ian would you like to play with us? Sure Alex replied, they had fun for hours running back and forth to the beach and playing various games. Laying down breathing heavy Alex felt good, showered with endorphins. As they went to the bathhouses only Ian and Alex went in. Ian and Alex pissed, then hung up their towels and took off their shorts in the same cubicle. Leaving only their wet underwear leaving very little to the imagination of one another. Alex felt himself blush, and his groin tighten. He struggled to fight off the erection, no worries we are both men Ian says and shrugs his shoulders thinking Alex was embarrassed, which he was… <br />
Ian waved at Alex to enter the shower with him and then immediately stripped off his undies like it was no big deal whipping them around in a finger and tossing them to their clothes in the cubicle behind them, Ian was probably about 16 and beautiful he thought very tall and his package was huge. His penis was filling with blood as he sheepishly took off his undies to join Ian, who pointed and said… your hard hehe. Alex threw his undies to the cubicle, yeah, so! I can’t always help it. That’s cute Ian said, and stepped closer to Alex. Almost nose to nose Alex noticed the head of Ian’s huge now also erect penis touched his erect tip gently, Alex blushed Ian towering above him and his penis easily twice as big if not more. Ian kissed him sending bliss waves though his young body it was his first time kissing another boy. Before he knew it he was turned around and Ian was kissing his bumhole. Licking all around and inside the clean warm hole. Making Alex feel things he never had before. Alex’s legs were shaking and he was making noises he had never heard before. Suddenly Ian stood up and his giant cock entered Alex’s ass first try the eggs had widened Alex out a little so he took Ian’s cock well. Alex moaning told Ian to cum. And within moments Ian said hhhgg hhhggg I am… and shot so much hot liquid into Alex’s hole Alex could feel it like he was peeing. The feeling inside Alex along with the pressure made him cum at the same time. The two layed together on the wall, breathing heavily. Alex wanted to try also. So Ian let Alex fuck him for a good minute and a half before Alex came his alien cum into Ian unknowingly to both of them passing it to Ian. Alex still had an erection as he out his pants on it took a very long time for it to go down. Same for Ian he noticed. The two really like each other so Alex asked if he could sleep over at Ian’s since their family had a camper not a tent. Alex’s mom met Ian’s family and agreed they could. Alex felt his tummy roll in his way up the hill. It was getting dark and he was heading up to the camper to eat and fall asleep at Ian’s. He recognized the feeling and hoping he could hold it off he didn’t really have much of a choice. He struggled for a moment then told Ian to Continue without him he wasn’t feeling good he would catch up in a minute. Breathing with the process sped things up, he felt the tightening of his muscles happen involuntarily at a rhythm he tuned in and within moments he came down the leg of his shorts as the egg stretched his anus farther than Ian’s cock could ever and rewardingly fell into his drawers, sighing and taking one step forward, hiking back up the hill Alex thought about how he could hide this no one could find it he had to make sure. Just then he slid on the grass wet from his cum. Egg still in the undies gravity pulled it to perfectly align as he hit the ground his ants was again spread wide and penetrated by the same egg, after a pop. Alex felt it shoot back up into him with an oof and damnit. Not again. He expected the contractions to restart but they didn’t, surprised at how no one had noticed him inn the brush yet he continued on toward Ian’s camper. They ate, all was well, and they had a great night. Ian’s family had left early in the rising so Alex snuck down and woke up Ian, Ian smiled as Alex stuck a hand down his pants and lowered himself to suck on his big cock. Alex moaned and licked pre cum off the tip as he plunged deeper and deeper it never took long for Ian to cum Alex thought well neither does it me. Within a minute or so Ian moaned and humped the back of Alex’s throat hard and came so much it spilled out the sides of Alex’s mouth. That felt great he said as Alex swallowed as much of his load as he could then went and rinsed his mouth off. <br />
They went to the nearby donut store and got some breakfast, sitting at the same booth. Suddenly Ian grabs Alex’s leg hard and says his name softly “Alex” his hand tightened and his face went kind of pale and blushy. He began to slightly move his hips and then Alex knew what was happening which frightened him all the more. As his friend jizzed his shorts even some falling down and hitting the floor! No time to explain he had to sit him down back at the camper and prepare him. Within a few moments he briefed Ian Ian frightened but surprised nodded his head suddenly his parents came back and asked if they were ready for lunch having just ate but not wanting to be suspicious they said sure and sat down for sandwiches. Neither could eat very much but as soon as Ian tried his body lurched downward in a very strong muscle contraction. He told his family he urgently needed Alex’s help outside and they let them go because they thought it was an excuse to play. They went straight to the bathhouse shower stall. And Ian grunted and silently screamed and gripped the tile hard with his fingers. He finally pushed out an egg. He also had a cum puddle in the floor beneath him. Panting. He got up and told Alex is that what’s supposed to happen? And passed out. Alex suddenly felt a stronger contraction thinking they had all gone away he was worried because he had forgotten and it had been several days since he fell on the last egg. He felt a “crack” inside him. His prostate suddenly was activated and his erecyion grew quickly. He panted and softly moaned as he felt contractions like none he had ever witnessed, before he knew it there was something much larger than an egg at his anal opening. He drew back and felt it slide inward its large form barreling his cavity. Soon a head was out and the arms and legs the baby looked just like Ian same hair and all, but Alex knew it had some differences, even if you couldn’t see it amazed to find he had milk as the babe latched on to his teat. Ian awoke to see the sight and passed out again. When he woke up the last time they told their parents who moved in together eventually. And the both of them and their child were inspected by science.</p>
