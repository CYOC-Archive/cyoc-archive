<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake woke up early on Monday. <br />
<br />
He had more energy than he had felt in a long time.  <br />
<br />
He clopped to the bathroom and let out a mighty stream of acrid piss. He had showered and done other things last night so instead of hopping in the shower, he took a moment to really study himself in the mirror.  He had avoided this all weekend, preferring to enjoy the time he had to himself without really acknowledging what he had become. <br />
<br />
In the mirror, he summed up his appearance. His long red and black face ended in a muzzle. He opened his lips and looked at his teeth.  He leaned back from the mirror and looked at the rest of his body.  His broad pecs, the puffy and pinkish nipples surrounded by darker  purple areolas. He reached up with a black nailed hand and pinched one.  He let out a muffled whinny.  <br />
<br />
Looking further he saw deep bs that were coated in the same glossy hair as the rest of him. Turning his side to the mirror, he was aware of his tail. It&#39;s darker hair at the base ended in an almost completely dark red tip. He gave it a flick and practiced moving it and lifting it up and away from his rear. <br />
<br />
On his left ass cheek he saw the tased skin and hairless patch on which the brand had been drawn by Jennifer.  He wiggles his ass and noticed the pinkish purple hole that rested between. The cheeks.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Giving himself one final look in the mirror, he winked one of his big eyes and flexed a bicep.  <br />
<br />
Jake had no doubt in his mind that in this monstrous form, he was hot.  He could still be the big man on campus.  Er at least the big horseman on campus.  <br />
<br />
He clattered downstairs to the kitchen, grabbed an apple and checking the clock, he decided he could make it on time to school if he jogged. <br />
<br />
He ran, his hoofs clattering on the sidewalk. <br />
<br />
Jake got to school right as the first bell rang. On Mondays he had gym first. Jake strode into the gym wiping off some of the sweat and latherin that had formed on his chest.    Today they were lifting.  <br />
<br />
Jake walked over to the weight bench and loaded up a barbell little more than his usual 250. Bumping up the weight to 280, he looked around for a spotter. <br />
<br />
Some of his teammates were in the class but most of them didn&#39;t meet his eye. <br />
<br />
Riley came up and clapped him on the back and said, &quot;Yo bro, need a spotter?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake nodded and Riley positioned himself at the top of the bench. <br />
<br />
Jake unracked the bar and began his first set. Riley began to quietly count. <br />
<br />
With every rep, a wave of hot air burst forth from Jakes mouth. Because of the length of Jakes face, Riley felt every exhalation as a hot wind on his crotch.  <br />
<br />
By the third rep, Riley was visibly tenting his shorts. His encouragement had gotten louder. &quot;Yeah bro. Get those gains. He said as Jane pushed up the sixth rep. Jake felt his pecs and biceps swell at both the exertion and the work of the curse. He finished the set with his own dick rising in response to the excitement Riley was showing, what with the obvious tent and the dark spot forming in the taunt fabric. <br />
<br />
As Jake racked the barbell and caught his breath, he heard Riley say in a low voice, &quot;Want me to spot that too?&quot; Jake followed his gaze to the horse  boner that was now pointing perpendicular to the bench. <br />
<br />
Jake mulled it over. Riley must have enjoyed the Friday night loads that he had been forced to service.  Jane was still pissed and didn&#39;t want to forgive Riley and Ben for the way they had acted at the pep rally. <br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; he said a little more forcefully than intended, &quot;You&#39;ve already got a job to do.&quot; <br />
<br />
Instead of giving in to Riley, Jake got the attention of Tom Jones. Tom wasn&#39;t on the team but Jake liked the look of the young blonde man.  He signaled him over and used the pheromones his body produced to induce his help. <br />
<br />
Tom wasted no time. He traced the entire length of Jakes cock from where it joined to his melonlike balls all the way to it&#39;s flared tip. Jake started his next set.  Pumping as Tom worked his shaft and balls eagerly.  <br />
<br />
By the time Jake had finished his third set, he was ready to blow. He laid the barbell back on the rack and let his arms relax. Tom put his lips around the tip of his massive dick and circled the flare with his tongue.  <br />
<br />
<br />
The first shot of sperm hit Tom in the back of the throat like a jet and he recoiled back.  Jake noticed that Riley had his hands in his pants and looked to be adjusting himself where the small wet spot had become a wet patch in the front of his shorts. <br />
<br />
Jake got up and walked to the locker room showers with thirty minutes left in the class.  He was surprised to see the area more spotless than it had ever been. It looked like it had been professionally detailed and disinfected.  The coach had probably hired an outside group to clean knowing that the team was going to throw a party if they won.  <br />
<br />
That cleaning team definitely got more than they bargained for when they placed their bid. <br />
<br />
Jake noticed with a little disappointment that the smell of manly grime had been completely stripped from the place.  Now, an almost foglike antiseptic atmosphere hung in the air. <br />
<br />
He turned on the hot water but didn&#39;t step in. He wanted to bask in his own seat and dirtiness for a bit. <br />
<br />
He wasn&#39;t surprised when he heard Riley trail in behind him. Riley shucked his shirt and his pants and stood next to Jake with a still raging hardon.  <br />
<br />
Jake looked at him with one of his large eyes. Waiting to hear what he was going to say.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Listen man,&quot; Riley said bashfully.  &quot;Sorry we egged you on at the pep rally. It was Ben&#39;s idea.  I don&#39;t know why I always go along with his shit.&quot; Jake turned to face him. <br />
<br />
&quot;I have always been jealous of you.  I&#39;ve always wanted to be you and then that night, I got to be with you... and the rest of the team I guess.&quot; Riley said getting quiet.  &quot;Listen, I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;ve been a real ass.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake gave what he thought on a horses face was a wry smile and said, &quot;A horses ass?&quot;<br />
<br />
Riley laughed and so did Jake.  Jake walked away from the running water and pulled Riley with him. He motioned for Riley to lay down on the bench. Riley did. His modest dick throbbing upwards. <br />
<br />
Jake straddled the bench and Riley facing away from him.  He tugged at his dick and just as Riley thought Jake was going to ride his dick. Jake lifted his tail and bounced his ass down on his face.  <br />
<br />
Jake felt Riley struggle in shock as the pillowy cheeks parted and his face was forced to encounter the folds of the sweaty hole. Then Jake began to feel Riley&#39;s tongue tracing the circumference of the wide hole.  Jake eased himself up allowing Riley a breath and Riley pulled the ass back to him greedily leaping at it.  <br />
<br />
Jake worked Riley&#39;s cock.  He was oddly unaccustomed to a dick  he could get his whole hand around. <br />
<br />
Riley thought about what he was doing. How he was debasing himself but he didn&#39;t care.  He wanted to be with Jake. <br />
<br />
Riley spurted rather quickly.  His cock leaving a few measly dribbles on Jakes hand.  Jake eased off of him and stood up toward the shower. That little bit of fun left him feeling self-satisfied and ready to shower and jerk himself to completion. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait!&quot; he heard Riley moan.  &quot;I want you to fuck me.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;We tried the other day. You may not remember.&quot; Jake said.  &quot;I&#39;m too big for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your cum will lube it up enough.  I may not be able to stand up tomorrow but I&#39;ll be able to take it without you breaking me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Riley&#39;s words were hopeful and optimistic. Jake decided to humor him. <br />
<br />
Jake smeared off some of the dried jizz from his session with Tom and smeared it on his finger as Tom got on all fours on the bench. <br />
<br />
Jake roughly jabbed the finger in and Tom yelped. &quot;If you can&#39;t handle this, you can&#39;t handle me.&quot; Jake said dismissively. <br />
<br />
He felt the hole quickly begin to relax and he began to coax two more cum coated fingers in and out of the ring.  After a few strokes he removed the two fingers and coated his whole hand in the pre that was now streaming from him like a river. <br />
<br />
Jake thrust his fist deep into the gaping hole.  Riley moaned again. This time in pleasure not pain. <br />
<br />
Burying his hand up to his forearm and pistoning it in and out slowly a few times.  Jake decided he could probably fuck him without killing him.  <br />
<br />
Jake reached his large biceps around the the smaller, crouching figure before him. He hoisted him up and walked him over to the mirror that was on the wall, his 20 inch dick slapping against the other mans torso as he went.  Jake sat down on the bench and lifting the whole weight of Riley by his thighs, he suspended him over his dick.  Then, with very little effort, he brought the man slowly down on the massive horsey rod.  <br />
<br />
Riley&#39;s moans were loud.  Jake joined him. He didn&#39;t think he would be able to fuck anything again. Well, at least another human.  He hadn&#39;t ruled out mares or jennys. <br />
<br />
Jake craned his neck around the back of the smaller man and watched as his cock distended Riley&#39;s four pack abs as he brought him closer to the tip. <br />
<br />
As he bottomed our, he realized he could see the entire outline of his shaft protruding where the majority of the vital organs Riley had should have rested.  <br />
<br />
If Riley was worried, he didn&#39;t show it.  Jake saw in the mirror that he had a blissful face.  <br />
<br />
Jake then realized that what Riley has said was true.  His cum made it so that he didn&#39;t hurt him. <br />
<br />
He said in a low tone, &quot;I&#39;m going to start moving.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake lifted Riley off his lap about a foot and the. Brought him down again.  Riley came without touching his cock. Jake lifted him and brought him down a few more times.  Riley moaned loudly as the warm intrusion gently prodded his insides. <br />
<br />
Jake said, &quot;Now you&#39;ve ridden a horse.  It&#39;s time for a horse to ride you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake pulled himself out with a wet pop and eased Riley onto the floor. With Riley on all fours, Jake forced himself in and out of him. First at a regular pace that rapidly quickened. <br />
<br />
Jake was eventually slamming in and out of him. His balls slapping back and forth hitting the whole length of Riley&#39;s  cock from the force of the thrusts. <br />
<br />
Riley was spurting with every thrust but he eventually ran out of cum.  Jake plowed faster and faster and then at the last minute, he pulled out and shot what could have been a couple of pints over Riley&#39;s back, neck and head. A few ropes of cum hit the mirror in front of him. Riley laid on his side. Panting and gasping for breath for a while.  <br />
<br />
Jake got up and went to the shower. He washed himself and towled off. When he finished, he saw that Riley was still laying there, a puddle of horsecum, human cum, and sweat.  <br />
<br />
Jake helped him to his feet, careful to not dirty himself up again. Jake&#39;s hole was still leaking from the precum that had been forced inside him. <br />
<br />
Riley wobbled over to his locker and fumbled I his bag.  Stopping more than once to brace himself against the locker to keep from falling over.  Finally he pulled out two items he had in there.  He turned and showed them to Jake.  Jake saw in his hands two large bulletshaped plugs.  Both were black but one had attached to it the imitation of a horse&#39;s tail. <br />
<br />
Still panting, Riley held them up for Jake to see and said, &quot;I got these on Saturday.&quot;  <br />
<br />
He hunched over and placed the un-tailed plug in his ass keeping whatever juices he had left in him locked inside.  <br />
<br />
Jake gave a disbelieving shrug and backed away saying, &quot;You made this mess.  You better clean it up before coach gets mad.&quot; He gestured to the puddles of fluids all over the locker room.  Don&#39;t blame me if you miss second period. <br />
<br />
Jake left the room and Riley began to shakily compose himself and look for a mop. <br />
<br />
Waking to class, Jake could still smell the sweat of the other boy soaked deep into his fur.</p>
