<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Feeling satisfied, Tyler worked his way down the hall, turning himself invisible and admiring his body as he considered what to do next. Toward the end of the hall, against the row of lockers, was a familiar face: Quintin, who always seemed to get picked on by Chase and Edward, two football jocks.<br />
<br />
Quintin was minding his own business, just trying to slip his books into his backpack, when Chase interrupted him and started bugging him for homework help, but by the time Tyler ran into them, they were outright robbing him of his notes and money.<br />
<br />
Tyler looked into Chase&#39;s mind and saw that he was a selfish and largely troubled young man. He played football fierce, but it was only due to his pent up rage and anger. The guy was always that way. Quentin, meanwhile, knew very little of fighting or defense, and was often at the peril of the freshman bullies.<br />
<br />
&quot;This won&#39;t do...&quot; Tyler told himself, and he communicated to Quintin via thought: &quot;Don&#39;t worry friend, fight back, and I will help you!&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Quintin never felt that kind of reassurance before, he immediately believed this voice in his head though he couldn&#39;t see who or what was talking to him. He stood and took a swing toward Chase, nailing him in the cheek. &quot;Awww! FUCK!&quot; Chase shouted, &quot;let&#39;s get this shrimp!&quot;<br />
<br />
But Chase and Edward were quickly surprised by what was taking place before them. Quintin was quickly gaining height and stature, surprising even Quintin as he looked down at his body. &quot;Holy shit!&quot; he shouted, &quot;OH, fuck! YEAH!&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking back up at the bullies, Quintin felt a new wave of assurance and strength wash over him, he started laying in on Chase while holding Edward with his other arm. Knocking them both to the ground, Quintin was forced to stop himself as his muscles gained more stature and weight. &quot;Oh YEAH!&quot; he shouted again.<br />
<br />
Quintin&#39;s knees buckled slightly as he felt his pants stretch, his cock growing low and plump while his balls went into overtime production, growing them large and pronounced. His ass locked in and grew out to a sharp bubble butt before the muscle climbed its way down to his quads, creating layers upon layers of muscle. The sinew reached down to his calves and bulked them up as well, before growing an extra layer of hair down and up his legs and package, Quintin itching with the new masculine features growing over him.<br />
<br />
Quintin laughed as the strength enveloped his upper body, increasing the weight and growth of the sinew across him. His height also increased, going from his normal 5&#39;6 to a bulked 6&#39;1, matching the height of his buddies. His pale skin grew out and darkened, holding in the muscle duplicating itself over his body. His pecs hardened and pulled up on his chest.<br />
<br />
Quintin brought his bulked and hairy arm up to his shirt ripping it off before dropping it and his backpack. He felt like the strongest man in the world! Easily overpowering this shrimp of a bully, a master quickly becoming a slave to the new super strengthen man. He took another step toward Edward to lay in another punch but his jeans ripped in half. Quintin, completely comfortable now in his new body, ripped his pants and underwear clean off and slipped out of his shoes, revealing himself in his new, naked, masculine state. &quot;Bet you don&#39;t have a body like this do you?&quot; Quintin asked menacingly. <br />
<br />
Quintin flexed his naked body and felt new layers of sinew bulking his biceps as they snaked down his arms and onto his hands. He snapped his back and looked over his shoulder and watched it grow out as new layers of muscle he didn&#39;t even know exist grow out, spreading out across his body, bulking out his newly hairy butt. His six-pack locked in and chiseled out, creating fine and discrete contours and they pulled up his rectus creating a cut V across his abs to his thighs.<br />
<br />
At this point Tyler showed himself and revealed his own naked body to the three men. Quintin turned and immediately new his creator, the god that allowed him to have this new body, stamina and athleticism. &quot;Tyler!&quot; Quintin said, &quot;thank you, man! I Feel like a god!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome, Quintin,&quot; Tyler responded. &quot;Let&#39;s leave these dorks to their own embarrassment, come on, you&#39;re a demi god now like the rest of us. I gotta introduce you to the guys.&quot; <br />
<br />
Chase felt a burning sensation surround him as Tyler and Quintin walked off, his clothes were disintegrating! &quot;What the fuck!&quot; he said, standing up to reveal himself naked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who are those guys?&quot; Edward asked, covering his dick.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s the track team, idiot,&quot; Chase answered, &quot;and they obviously have some sort of super powers. I want them and I&#39;m going to get them, even if it means forcing it from their fucking hands.&quot;</p>
