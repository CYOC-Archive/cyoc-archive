<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark and his girlfriend were walking around the store when at some point they stumbled across the bad boy aisle. They decided to explore it and read the description of some of the products. <br />
His girlfriend started reading the descriptions outloud and barely contained her smirk. The first product was a cream that would turn a boy&#39;s dick in to a vagina while simultaneously claiming that there was no you could tell the difference. between them. <br />
The next product was a device in the form of half an oval that would attach to your crotch and constantly stimulate you. It was marketed alongside the question: How long can you pleasure your girlfriend? If you can&#39;t last more than 1 hour you don&#39;t deserve to be a man! In that case of failing the machine&#39;s test your dick would be turned in to a vagina for 1 month. <br />
His girlfriend put down the devices and almost walked away laughing when she stumbled on to her boyfriend and they both fell on to the ground. <br />
While on top of him she felt his raging boner and saw the previous device she had looked at. She was starting to get what was going on. <br />
You are  hard at the prospect of what that device can do,aren&#39;t you?!<br />
I might be, why? <br />
So you want a cunt in between your legs? <br />
I don&#39;t know you seem to be having to much fun with yours while we&#39;re having sex.... <br />
Well in that case I think you should spend some time having one...<br />
But in that case, I won&#39;t be able to pleasure you...<br />
Oh don&#39;t you worry, she said. As she brought the same product but from the opposite shelf (the same thing but from the bad girl aisle).<br />
After they picked their products they went home and unpacked.<br />
They were getting ready for sex when his girlfriend unexpectedly attached the device to his groin grinning and asking him? <br />
Do you think you are a man? Because I think you aren&#39;t going to pass the test which proves you&#39;re one. <br />
This statement got him really hard and she knew it. <br />
She started going around him and touching him which almost made him cum, but she was careful not to over do it until the final question...<br />
At some point she got down to his   basin and started to draw on his belly the uterus and the ovaries with her finger almost making him cum.But the real fun is under these two components, it&#39;s a long and slick pussy that I know you want. <br />
Are you ready to loose your dick boy? Because I think you are... <br />
As she said that, she started to slightly push on the device creating a lot of pressure on him. <br />
At some point under her voice(encouraging him to let go of his dick) and the pressure applied to the device he started to come.<br />
In that moment his hands shot down to his crotch unable to touch it while he was furiously cumming.<br />
His girlfriend said that the device will keep him in this state for quite a while so they had some time to observe his changes. <br />
He was placed on his back by his girlfriend who was observing his stomach spasm up and down trapped in a state of orgasm.<br />
You will be fine... she said, as he was touching his stomach because of this peculiar feeling. It was just as strong as a normal orgasm but after a while of humping the bed and the air he didn&#39;t have energy for more than just observing and feeling his prostate trying to pump something that isn&#39;t there anymore.<br />
At some point his girlfriend observed through the blurry glass that his balls were going up in to his abdomen. At this observation he started trying to feel them through his pumping basin, which he surprisingly succeeded. They were going up and changing shape, and at some point they stopped quite a ways up in a symmetrical spot. He could feel them taking shape and his girlfriend was also tracking them through his hands. <br />
I think you are going to like what is happening now.<br />
His eyes lit up as he knew what she was talking about. At this point his girlfriend was telling him how his dick was shortening. It continued to pulse and shrink while he had his hands on his basin continously feeling how more and more of it was sliding in to his abdomen.<br />
At some point he said to his girlfrirnd that he couldn&#39;t feel it anymore. She said with a smirk that it  had probably turned in to his vaginal channel.At this point he started to feel around for it and he did manage to feel his vaginal channel in between his ovaries. It was so strange to feel his anatomy through his belly, his girlfriend also started to feel for it with her fingers giving him a pleasant sensation and managed to find its outlines saying with a proud voice that he was now the proud owner of a vagina. <br />
As she said that his stomach churned in a way that it hadn&#39;t before making his girlfriend massage his stomach trying to find what was wrong. As she did so she felt his prostate going up and connecting to his vaginal tube, while at the same time feeling it enlarge, turning in to an uterus.<br />
His mind  was all over the place feeling butterflies in his stomach, but that wasn&#39;t his stomach.....<br />
He asked his girlfriend what had happened and she said that he had lost his prostate. She also added that he shouldn&#39;t be to sad since he didn&#39;t have a dick with which to use it anyway at that point.<br />
He started being poked by his girlfriend in his abdomen examining  everything. <br />
At that point the device disconnected and the water filled with cum fell on the bed.<br />
Come on, take a look said his girlfriend as he got up to his feet.<br />
He started feeling himself around his navel. Everything was normal until his hands didn&#39;t hit anything. They just continued down in between his legs. At some point he felt the lips of his pussy and he was amazed at how good they felt,and they were much closer to his body than he had expected. <br />
His girlfriend looked at him biting her lip saying that she was going to have so much fun with him.He was also getting arroused all though this time he couldn&#39;t show it</p>
