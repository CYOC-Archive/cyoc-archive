<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It hit the ground, landing square on its top, and in doing so, hit the main button, and possibly some others as well!? All they knew was what followed, as the dark room lit up.<br />
<br />
FLASH<br />
<br />
In an instant, they both felt... off. The subtle darkness of their pleasant home was gone. The lights were all on in their home, and in addition there were strange added lights. There were Christmas, multicolored lights adorning the walls, and what looked like disco-like patterns all over the ceiling. <br />
<br />
However, staring at this made them both feel, sick? Rick looked down, and saw two tits staring back at him. They were slightly smaller than before, and were now held loose in some flimsy blue top. However, looking at it was difficult... his vision was, blurry. Did he need glasses now? However, the thought was funny to him... like, hilarious, causing him to giggle. The giggle turned to a laugh as he looked at his dainty, manicured hand again. His eyes could no longer keep track of it as his brain got fuzzy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shiiiit. Em, we&#39;re a little more than buzzed I think.&quot; She slurred slightly. &quot;You good?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;L. O. L. Like, i-if thisssis your tipesy then I don wanna see you hammer.&quot; Emily slurred.<br />
<br />
Rick turned to meet Emily&#39;s gaze, and his jaw dropped. Before him was a THICK African American woman, decked out in a killer red dress. She had a curly Afro, big hoop earrings, and a pair of matching red heels. Killer ass, killer tits, gorgeous... everything. The woman stumbled slightly, and the shock of it all actually helped Rick sober up a little as he struggled to catch her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh, my head.&quot; Emily moaned as she leaned on Rick&#39;s shorter shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on babe, let&#39;s get those heels off you.&quot; Rick grunted in his new soprano voice as the two hobbled towards the nearest bed.<br />
<br />
Bed was a strong word, as it was really a mattress on the floor with a bunch of basic-bitch college girl decorations like white lights, a board filled with pictures of family and friends and so on. As Rick took off Emily&#39;s shoes, he sobered up some more. His vision got clearer, and was able to look at the pictures.<br />
<br />
Apparently he, or rather she, was the basic-bitch in question. There were several pictures of this version of himself. There was a picture with his mom and dad from prom night, except instead of him in his crappy tux handed down from his dad, female him got a long, beautiful, purple dress. As Rick kept looking around at the photos, he kept getting more and more peeved.<br />
<br />
 There was one where his older brother&#39;s looked about 9, when he was 7, and based on the pic they were definitely should&#39;ve been on that crapy ski trip, but instead the picture showed them somewhere warm and tropical, with his gender swapped self wearing a one piece princess bathing suit. He was peeved because that&#39;s where HE had wanted to go that year, but his older twin brother&#39;s got their way.<br />
<br />
Every picture confirmed it. Normally, his older brother&#39;s got their way, but apparently, if he was born as a girl, he would&#39;ve been the favorite child, his mom and dad&#39;s little girl.<br />
&quot;Such, bullshit.&quot;  He muttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, you say something?&quot; Emily asked as Rick got the second heel off her foot.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sobering up too babe?&quot; Rick asked, rubbing his forehead as a headache formed.<br />
<br />
&quot;A lil.&quot; She chuckled. &quot;It&#39;s kinda... hard to remember stuff? I know who we, like, are but *BURP* whawere we doin?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We were older gender-swapped versions of ourselves... and were were getting stupid and careless and we dropped the camera.&quot; Rick sighed as he leaned back against the adjacent wall, staring with a sneer as his breasts jiggled. &quot;Why always a girl with this thing.&quot; He whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhhh I member... I was gonna fuuuuck you raw.&quot; Emily said with a laugh. &quot;It woulda been fireee.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up babe, you&#39;re drunk.&quot; Rick slightly slurred, his face turning red slightly. He didn&#39;t even want to THINK about what he was actually serious about doing. It didn&#39;t help that since he was still a woman his member below was quivering at the thought. &quot;You haven&#39;t even noticed your change.&quot; He quickly deflected, trying to ignore the wet feeling below.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I have I&#39;m a hot girl again.&quot; She smirked. &quot;No dick here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look down.&quot; He sighed.<br />
<br />
Emily looked down, and gasped. &quot;My titties grew!&quot; She laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look closer.&quot; <br />
<br />
Emily looked down again, seemed to stare, and then looked back up.<br />
&quot;My race changed?&quot; She asked, sounding a little more sober from the shock. &quot;Am I black?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, from the looks of it... your face looks kinda the same, so you&#39;re not just a different person. I think you&#39;re you if you were born African somehow?&quot; Rick speculated. &quot;God, I&#39;m glad this me hadn&#39;t had too much to drink. This is already hurting my head.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God, how hot am I?&quot; She asked. Emily quickly flung her hands to her head, then halted quickly, and returned slower to feel her new hair. &quot;Ooooo do I look fine?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You look great.&quot; Rick replied somewhat sarcastically before he brushed some curly locks from his face, then spotted the camera just to the side of the mattress. Rick swiped it, then sighed in relief.<br />
&quot;Okay, okay, good we can fix this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Helllllo!&quot; A valley girl sounding woman called from down the hall. &quot;You two hoes stop fighting yet?&quot; She called out happily.<br />
<br />
As a reflex, Rick shoved the camera to the side, hiding it behind the floor&#39;s mattress just in time for the door to open. In walked some lankey, blonde girl who looked absolutely bombed. She giggled upon seeing them, then just regular laughed before she spoke again.<br />
&quot;You good?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah, yeah we&#39;re good.&quot; Rick replied, trying to sound as genuine as possible despite the predicament they found themselves in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;m glad you&#39;re *HIC* not fighting anymore. I&#39;m sure Emma didn&#39;t mean to call you a skinny bitch anyway.&quot; She slurred with a laugh.<br />
<br />
Rick and Emily both shot each other concerned glares. How had the camera changed their lives? Were they even friends anymore? As Rick thought about it, he thought back to the wall of photos. There were tons of college girls in tons of pictures with this female version of himself, and none of them were this version of Emily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Riley.&quot; The girl &#39;whispered&#39; though loud enough for Emily to obviously overhear. &quot;Listen just be cool with her. She&#39;s from Kappa Alpha... Alpha whatever, but we gotta work with her for now if we&#39;re gonna beat thoooose bitches.&quot; She ended her rant, seemingly mid thought before turning away and stumbling.<br />
&quot;Oh and c&#39;mon the frats are gonna show up soon.&quot; She added with a smirk.<br />
<br />
Rick heard music from down below now that the door was open, alongside the chattering of partygoers. He shut the door again, and turned to face a now chuckling Emily.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s so funny?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno. Maybe me and you, sorority bitches with beef.&quot; She smirked. &quot;So, we gonna party or what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me?&quot; Rick asked, flabbergasted. <br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon Ricky, think about it! You never joined something like this. We go to parties and shit but never these types of things! You should get the full experience. Plus, like, why not? We get drunk, enjoy a night as sexy party girls, and change back tomorrow. Easy-peasy.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;How drunk are you?&quot; Rick sighed. &quot;You know I&#39;m not a big fan of parties... plus, why would I want to go to a party while I have tits?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why wouldn&#39;t you?!&quot; Emily laughed, causing Rick to blush while before rolling his eyes, then turning away with a pout to avoid confronting Emily&#39;s kinda valid point. Wouldn&#39;t it be fun? To be a hot girl at a party? It wasn&#39;t like it was ever a dream of his... but it could be fun? Maybe? But then again, if they didn&#39;t change back now, what if something happened? To the camera or between them? They could be stuck like this forever? Was he just overthinking it, over reacting?!<br />
<br />
&quot;So, whatcha say, Riley?&quot; Emily asked with a smile.</p>
