<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jensen, Kaylee, Fran, Darla, and Julie stood quietly as the curse ended. At first they thought it would be the end of their troubles, and five could enjoy a second honeymoon, since those that had been in the medical wing were well enough to go about on their own and didn't need the constant care... with the exception of Joy and Ingrid going with some of them to provide some nursing care, and Mother Glen getting some of the nurses from either the hospital or the nursing home that Mother Glen ran to provide extra muscle. Much of that would go on several weeks more.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's over,&quot; Kaylee hugged her husband, the triplets joining her, &quot;It's over and we're free.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Jensen nodded as he licked the muzzle of each of his wives.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, where would we go on this second honey...&quot; Julie began to ask when they were interrupted.<br />
<br />
&quot;TREVOR!&quot; came shouts from Bart and Kevin as they spotted the black and gray cub and took off, Jenny and Marcy close behind.<br />
<br />
Jensen and Kaylee looked up to see the young male cub being hugged by Madame Serenity. Although, who he was with didn't matter as Alice, Abbey, and Samantha were quick to join their half-siblings. They were forced to give &quot;chase&quot;.<br />
<br />
Serenity had only just set Trevor down when the cub was tackled from the side, with a series of barks following. She then looked down to see seven Lupman pups holding Trevor down and licking him with tails wagging.<br />
<br />
&quot;Help!&quot; Trevor cried out, &quot;Help! They're liking me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think the word is lick,&quot; Sabrina chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;That too!&quot; Trevor managed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bart! Jenny! Kevin! Marcy!&quot; &quot;Alice!&quot; &quot;Abbey!&quot; &quot;Samantha!&quot;<br />
<br />
Serenity then turned to see Jensen and his wives approaching. One reddish brown, three dirty blond, all with a prominent bosom... though the three blond Lupman were the biggest of the four.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alpha Jensen, Kaylee,&quot; Marie Tyson turned to face them, &quot;it would appear that your children missed my son.&quot;<br />
<br />
They finally managed to get their children before they loved Trevor to death.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're sorry if they've interrupted anything,&quot; Kaylee commented as she and Marie hugged briefly, &quot;it's just that his return has been rather big.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie looked down to her son, parts of his fur matted a little where he had been licked. They had raised some of the fur on his head and on his cheeks, but other then that, he didn't look too bad...<br />
<br />
&quot;It's alright,&quot; Marie spoke, &quot;I think everyone missed him, and I've been overjoyed to have my son back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can bathe myself!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; Sabrina teased, &quot;You might NEED a good lickin'.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You hang out with Nane too much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's good to see you again, Trevor,&quot; Bart said to him, &quot;You won't go away again... will you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't plan too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor found himself being hugged again.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Madame Serenity, the one who protected Trevor,&quot; Marie introduced the elderly woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;We've met,&quot; Jensen answered and offered Serenity his paw.<br />
<br />
They shook hands, before Serenity found herself grabbed by two strong hands and then looking face first into two large mounds of blond fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;She's helping find the pups of the gem teens and the pups that Lawrence and Anne adopted,&quot; Julie added and hugged Serenity into her chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sister...&quot; Fran and Darla commented.<br />
<br />
Julie looked down and blushed, &quot;Sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's alright,&quot; Serenity commented as she came up for air after being released from Julie's hug.<br />
<br />
Marie chuckled a little, &quot;Yes, Serenity has told me she was helping in the search for the missing pups.&quot;<br />
<br />
Caught in the present conversation, Serenity didn't notice Gillie slipping away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you made any progress in finding them?&quot; Julie asked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, Julie, Kurse's attack derailed that,&quot; Serenity spoke slowly, &quot;I'll try to get on it as soon as I can... although right now, I would like to take a little bit of a break.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We understand,&quot; the triplets said together, &quot;we plan to go on a second honeymoon when we can get the chance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;BLEH!&quot; came the response from their pups below them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it they're not too keen on the idea?&quot; Serenity quipped as she looked down at the seven pups.<br />
<br />
&quot;They're still at the stage where boys or girls are icky,&quot; Kaylee chuckled, &quot;give them time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We were thinking about going to a movie, if you'd care to join us,&quot; Marie offered, &quot;it'd let the kids be with their friends for a little while.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alpha and Omega!&quot; Marcy and Kevin cheered, &quot;we've seen the ads!&quot;<br />
<br />
That soon lead into a discussion of which movie to see.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Yamato leaned heavily on a set of crutches  as he and his sister wives watched the curse end. They were positioned at an edge of the gathering where the pack ended and the Pride began.<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn't have to come,&quot; Sonia Gen said to him, &quot;after what Kurse put you all through, you have the right to rest and recuperate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to see this through to the end,&quot; Yamato said simply, &quot;Besides, it has allowed me to apologize in person.&quot;<br />
<br />
Penny looked up from her wheel chair with Umeko pushing and Kirk and his parents and her parents beside him. She then sighed heavily.<br />
<br />
&quot;As far as I'm concerned, you're forgiven,&quot; Penny spoke, &quot;we both made mistakes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Forgiveness is one thing,&quot; Yamato answered, &quot;Honor is another.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maxwell half marveled at some of this devotion to &quot;Bushido&quot; that the Japanese Lupman exhibited.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what will you do when you're all healed?&quot; Maxwell asked, &quot;Penny's doctors say she'll be well in three weeks and Beta Julie has said you'll all be moving again in about the same time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do not know,&quot; Yamato admitted, &quot;America has no enemies on its borders, and the curse is gone... there is not much further need for a warrior. And there was some idea to be of service to our Alphas, but that won't come now, and Beta Julie was insistent that she be allowed to do the breast reduction surgeries for my mates.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Amen,&quot; Akane, Chiyoye, Umeko, and Eri said together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe we'll have puppies and continue my line,&quot; Yamato answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're Samurai, right?&quot; Jeff York asked after a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Yamato answered, &quot;though low ranking in comparison to other members of Japan's feudal nobility. My ancestors and their retainers were exiled from Nippon when they began to modernize everything... they eventually found their way to Glendale and joined the Pack, and served the Alphas valiantly. My own grandfather fought with the Japanese-American soldiers in Italy and France during the War... though unlike Patrick, Mr. P, he was killed in combat with the enemy. And died with honor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry you didn't get to know him,&quot; Jeff said slowly, &quot;but I have read some stuff that says that the Samurai became teachers when the feudal wars in Japan ended. They started the martial arts schools there. Perhaps you could do that. I'm sure Nicole wouldn't mind the help, and from what I've read, even if no one ever applies those lessons physically, wouldn't it help them gain the focus needed to succeed in other parts of life?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yamato blinked and looked to Chiyoye. The &quot;ninja&quot; Lupman shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;You present an interesting idea,&quot; Yamato spoke slowly.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
<br />
Three weeks later, Penny smiled as she walked down the isle, with most the pride and a fair portion of the Pack present. The wedding march played as she walked along. Umeko stood up with the other bridesmaids while Kirk waited for her with Yamato as his best man. It was somewhat of a shock to some in the pride that the two would be involved with the wedding, but some of Kirk's friends had actually left Glendale and couldn't make it back in time for the wedding.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are gathered here today to join together Kirk York and Penny Glen in Holy Matrimony...&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Ten years later, Penny looked on as her three light beige cubs played with four copper colored cubs. Kirk sat quietly beside her while Gillie and Herman sat close by. Things seemed to be going well for them all.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The end of the curse also brought a more solemn tone besides the hopes for a brighter future. Brian, Felicity, Gary, Bobbi, Bernie, Wanda, Nellie, Lexi, MJ, lioness Megan, Sasha, and Penny all gathered together after a little while. Umeko at that time was still pushing Penny's wheelchair. Mother Glen also came forward with Gillian beside her.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how will you plan to &quot;bury&quot; Fox and Elise?&quot; Mother Glen asked, &quot;since you've told me that you couldn't find their bodies after Kurse's destruction.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fran, Darla, and Julie promised to get Jensen to have a statue erected in their honor,&quot; Brian commented, &quot;I've asked Tatuli if she could put together a design for it... since Jensen might tend to get a bit over-dramatic in doing so.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fox and Elise would have wanted something simple,&quot; Gary nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now all we need to do is figure out what to say,&quot; Bobbi sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we should just give a simple eulogy of what we knew of them,&quot; Penny sniffled, &quot;it's all we can do... I'm going to miss Fox so much!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We all will,&quot; MJ nodded.<br />
<br />
Penny then turned, Gary, &quot;You and your cubs can move in with Kirk and I after the funeral... my place is big enough for you to join us... though we'll need something bigger if you take a new Prime Mate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Paul?&quot; Michael asked as he looked at the orange My Little Pony.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Orange Tang now,&quot; the My Little Pony said vocally.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wished to be one of them?&quot; Michael asked, barely realizing that &quot;Paul&quot; actually spoke to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... not specifically,&quot; Orange Tang answered, &quot;I wished I could speak again and it just sort of happened. You wouldn't mind having a sister instead of a brother?&quot;<br />
<br />
Michael knelled down and pulled the little horse into a hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose after all we've put with and had to put up with, it wouldn't be THAT big of a sacrifice to allow you to speak again,&quot; Michael sighed.<br />
<br />
Orange Tang nuzzled him back, &quot;You'll always be my brother, Michael. I love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I love you too,&quot; Michael answered, &quot;how did you know to just appear here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wished slash prayed that you'd never come to harm and it just happened,&quot; Orange Tang answered, &quot;part of the magic of the My Little Ponies, I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Michael commented, &quot;and what brings you to me, Anne?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't know you were in trouble, if that is what you mean,&quot; Anne answered, &quot;but I'm glad I could be here to protect you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michael stood up to be lifted into a hug by the cream furred Lupman.<br />
<br />
&quot;My reason for being here is to ask for some advice,&quot; Anne spoke, &quot;do you remember Jay, Pence, Toni, and Paula?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They are the pups you adopted, are they not?&quot; Orange Tang asked.<br />
<br />
Anne nodded, &quot;Yes, but Lawrence and I are expected our first biological children... and I do not know how to tell them that my pregnancy is not because I hate or want to replace them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michael sighed, and guessed he was needed for counseling. He turned to Orange Tang.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sister, you'll take care of yourself, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, brother,&quot; Orange Tang answered.<br />
<br />
He then watched as his &quot;brother&quot; now sister slowly trotted out to head back to Ponyland. Michael then turned to Anne.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come along, my child, I'll try to see if I can help you find the right words,&quot; Michael answered, &quot;would you like tea or coffee?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tea, please,&quot; Anne answered.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Nine months later, Anne sat in one of the medical wings as her twin children suckled from her. Lawrence, Margot, Ashley, and Megan were all around her with her adopted children peering curiously at the newborns.<br />
<br />
&quot;Their ears are floppy,&quot; Jay pointed to the white colored twin closest to him, a female.  Toni was on the other side and was closest to the other twin, a cream furred male.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our ears are always floppy as newborns,&quot; Julie commented, rubbing her own selling womb, &quot;the cartilage in the ear doesn't firm up for awhile.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So they can hear us?&quot; Pence asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course they can,&quot; Julie answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;What their names?&quot; Paula wondered, &quot;and can I hold one?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Best to let them finish eating first,&quot; Anne told them, &quot;then daddy will help you hold them. The male will be Joshua. The female will be Elise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They look so cute!&quot; Toni smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course they are,&quot; Lawrence lifted her up in a hug, &quot;they're part of our family, me you and your sister, Jay and Pence, Ashley, Margot, Megan, Anne, and now your younger siblings.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anne smiled as her family gathered around her. Part of her wondered if she had started something when the pack at the manor learned she was pregnant. Jensen and his wives took a second honeymoon, touring the Caribbean, and Kaylee, Fran, Darla, and Julie all came back pregnant, and smiling from ear to ear. And some time after everyone was completely healthy from the battle with Kurse, nearly everyone else became pregnant as well, with the exception of most of the omegas and for now the Japanese Lupmen females (their females were still recovering from the breast reduction surgery). Of them, only Joy was pregnant, by Ryan. Anne had been told that she didn't force them that they all wanted to be pregnant... or that it came as an unexpected but pleasant surprise.<br />
<br />
Though not that this didn't have its own difficulties. Julie spent a lot of time trying to make sure that Amethyst didn't spend too much time skipping while carrying twin pups inside her. And Jensen, Zack, Yamato, Roger, and a few of the others were busy preparing for the cribs needed for either a nursery or to be kept in their parent's rooms until they were weened.<br />
<br />

<br />
Twelve years later, Ulysses stood quietly as the wedding march began. Recovering from his shyness, he had found the courage to actually date someone. And as Millie, Robyn, Maxine, and Coral approached him, he couldn't help but smile. His choice of &quot;best man&quot; was somewhat &quot;odd&quot;, but Mary Hardy had always been his friend. He couldn't think of anyone else for that role, and Mary, and her Prime Mate-to-be, Trevor Tyson, were more then willing to help.</p>
