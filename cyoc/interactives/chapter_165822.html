<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Finn&#39;s life as the best in the Aldroosi tribe is forever lost when his more powerful adoptive brother stole the spotlight. Finn strives to make things right by stealing back what is rightfully his.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The night is cold and the hour is slow. Alec sat by the linen-covered table, waiting for a customer to arrive. When the temple bells tolled and the noise of the crowd hushed, the tent flaps fluttered open. A golden-haired archer enters the tent. Beside him is another human, brown-haired, gagged, and limb bounded by a tight rope. The prisoner’s eyes were in a daze. Saliva is dripping on his mouth. These are the usual signs of the skill [Trance], where the target undergoes a state of relaxation and docility. The skill is hard to pull off and Alec is wondering how an archer class can do such a skill. Unless this archer hired another to the skill.<br />
<br />
Alec looked at the archer and used his skill [Soul Manipulation: Character Appraisal]. It’s a minor skill which is incomparable to the amount of information it gives. He got it from upgrading his [Possession] skill to +3 these past few months. It allows him to see the Adventurer Card Info of someone else without asking for their card. It can be activated without the phrase so your target won’t know that they are being appraised.<br />

Adam’s skills are long but Alec cannot find the skill [Trance] - which cements the fact that someone else did it to his companion. And speaking of him, he activated his appraisal skill in his direction.<br />

<br />
Alec perked one of his eyebrows. This Alden has a longer list of skills than Finn - and even longer than his. His attributes even broke that rank A barrier - giving him another quantifier on his profile. It is said that the more letters in an attribute, the more advanced they are. And this kid has pierced through that at such a young age. It’s been months and Alec could barely break the rank A barrier for his Intelligence skill. If he could, he’d possess Alden right away - but that would scare his customer and he would probably bailout. Alec needs him - well, his money. Customers are sparse these past few days. The church of Zelianthos must have seen to that. <br />
<br />
“Welcome, Finn Eldridge to my humble abode.” Alec rasped his voice a little bit, which would give his profession more credibility.<br />
<br />
“You know my name.” Finn said, “then this must be the real deal. They said you can swap people’s bodies.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, for a price.”<br />
<br />
“Anything. Tell me. What is it?”<br />
<br />
It’s simple. “500 Gold Dragons.” The archer’s eyes opened wide. Five Hundred dragon coins is a lot of money, even for a baron of a province. <br />
<br />
“I- uh… don’t have that kind of money,” Alec was prepared to use his [Possession] skill on him and [Teleport] him to the city gates when he opened his satchel revealing a pristine azure gem the size of a beastman’s fist. Alec has only seen illustrations of the thing in books and a glimpse of it in the Temple of Helia which is held by the Grand Archon. It’s &#12304;Meganite Stone&#12305;, an exquisitely rare magical stone that can increase the mana storage of its owner. You only need to be in your inventory for its effect to activate. “This is my village’s treasure, the &#12304;The Aghanim’s Eye&#12305;. I have 350 Gold Dragons here and this will be the collateral for the other 250.”<br />
<br />
Alec thought for a bit. For this deal, he is the one coming at the top. He can use&#12304;Meganite Stone&#12305;to expand the number of customers he can cater by up to twenty more per day. He’ll earn more than what Finn would owe. So, Alec gave in to the offer.<br />
<br />
Before he could do the swap, he needs to learn why they want to do so. In this case, it is probably only Finn who has the say in what will happen. Alden has never said a single ounce of syllable ever since he got her. He probably doesn’t even know he is in this place. Asking the story is not a prerequisite of the skill but Alec acts as if it were. Doing the same thing every day can get boring at times. A little bit of story from the two - well, from Finn - won’t hurt. <br />
<br />
Finn was reluctant to tell his story at first as if there’s a lump of stone holding back his tongue. Alec assured him that other than the swaps, anonymity is another service his establishment provides. His mouth is bound and no words of their transaction will get out. Unless they wish to spread the tale of their swap. Assured by this, Finn told his tale starting in the tribe of Aldroosi on the Serpentine Lagoon far North of Alabaster.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
The Aldroosi is a tribe of hunters - excelling in both land and sea. The location of their tribe proved true to that. Northwards is an ocean extending as far as the eye can see but ends at the Arctic Archipelago. Southward is the Gristlewood Forest - a breeding place for various beasts that can reach the size of a house. The Aldoori hunted beasts and men that dare plan hurt their tribe. Despite their animalistic roots, the Aldroosi is a civilized tribe swearing fealty to the crown.<br />
<br />
Finn Eldridge is the son of the head of the Aldroosi tribe, Winter Eldrige. His father was a formidable hunter capable of defeating sea serpents with a single spear. And like his father and his forebears before him, Finn is destined to inherit their way of life and excellence in doing so. Until a brown-haired babe found its way on the Eldridge porch when Finn was just 2 years old. It was Alden. Seeing that the parents are nowhere to be seen, the Winter Eldridge took the boy and raised it as one of its own.<br />
<br />
Finn and Alden grew like real brothers. They ate at the same table, slept at the same bed, and rested beneath the same roof. They were inseparable and they shared the dreams of becoming a hunter like their father. <br />
<br />
At age 8, they started their training. Finn learned that he excelled in the art of the bow. He could shoot moving creatures while on a chase. He could hunt while the moon is hiding and the stars are smothered by the clouds. The faintest footsteps are as loud as the bickering of a married couple with his ears. Finn would be the best at the tribe if it weren’t for his adoptive brother.<br />
<br />
Alden, although weak looking, learned how to master the sword at age 8. He mastered the bow at age 9 and one mastery of another weapon per year after that. While doing so, he also learned how to use magic. He could one-shot a werewolf on a full moon whereas Finn would need a hundred arrows and the help of three other men. <br />
<br />
Alden is Finn’s brother, and although he might deny it, he could not help but feel overshadowed him. He repressed this feeling for a while. He can’t show any resent because Finn is also afraid that his Alden would resent him in return. If Alden did that, their father would do so too. Winter grew to love Alden more than Finn, his blood-born son. It’s unfair. So unfair.<br />
<br />
Then suddenly, by some snagged string of fate, Alden decided to leave the tribe at thirteen years old. He said he wanted to be an adventurer, and hope that he could use his skills to serve the world. The Aldroosi are a tribe proud of their hunting roots. The life of an Aldroosian Adventurer is unheard of but not entirely impossible. Since Alden is not of Aldroosi by blood, he was allowed to become an adventurer despite his father’s protests. <br />
<br />
Alden was gone. Finn thought he’d grow to hate his brother’s absence. And for a fact he did, but not in a way he expected. He became the best hunter after his brother’s absence, but there are whispers that his victory is hollow. He won by default and that is the same as losing. Finn tried to shut the villager’s comments, even beat one to a pulp. His dad got angry at him and even jailed his own son for a week.<br />
<br />
Finn trained day and night to show those villagers that his victory is by his hands alone. He trained to rise above the bar Alden left behind. He hunted beasts greater than the recommended for his level but after level 20, it was a slog getting from the next level. It’s like he was unworthy to pass the wall Alden easily jumped over.<br />
<br />
It’s unfair. So damn unfair. Finn cursed the gods, above and below, for the place he’s in. He thought what he’s experiencing now is the lowest he could get, he was wrong for the letters of Alden’s journey came over the mail. While Finn is hunting Level 25 Grizzly Bears, Alden is hunting Level 70 dragons. And while doing so, he managed to get a tight-knit party of fellow adventurers. Then for the rest of the letter, he listed the skills he has earned during his travels - which took up one and a half pages of paper.<br />
<br />
While Winter Eldridge is reading this, Finn is a hollow of who he used to be. The life Alden is living, it should be his. The skills he has, it should be his. His friends, his clothes, his strength, all of it, it should be his - and his alone. If he weren’t abandoned like horse-shit by his cunt parents, he’d be the only heir to the Eldridge tribe. <br />
<br />
At the end of the letter, Alden said he’s planning to settle down here in the tribe. He’s young but he has earned enough money and adventure to last him two lifetimes. He’s going to return with his friends seeing him off. <br />
<br />
For days, Finn was a teensy close at planning to kill his brother out of envy until he heard a rumor from a traveling merchant about a particular tent in Alabaster that can swap people’s bodies. If Finn was in his usual mental state, he’d laugh it off like some tall tale that merchants pick up from their travels. But he’s not in his current mental state and he’s desperate to have everything Alden has.<br />
<br />
In the guise of the dark, Finn stole the village’s &#12304;The Aghanim’s Eye&#12305;and left with a hired costly hypnotist from the band of merchants. They reached Alden’s party days later and introduced themselves with the pretense that they were going to escort them back to the village. Since Finn is Alden’s brother, the party easily trusted him. Until one night, Finn invited Alden to the deep forest to hunt together like in the old days. Within the embrace of the dark foliage, Finn bound Alden and the hypnotist, who’s been hiding all this time, used the skill [Trance] to subdue him.<br />
<br />
With the deed done, Finn traveled to Alabaster which took about a day and a half on a non-stop horse ride through forests and plains.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
It was a tale of brotherly bond ending in an envy for the other’s achievement. Alec resonates with Finn’s envy. Back in his old life, Alec had an older brother who excelled in football and joined the military. Since he was bisexual and accidentally outed himself to their conservative father. Every achievement meant nothing to his father. He hated his brother for a while - thinking that the world is not fair for the weak. Then he realized how dumb that was. He shouldn’t be pleasing his father and it’s not his brother’s fault that his father preferred him. <br />
<br />
Alec was close to denying Finn’s wishes. He wants to tell him to return to his tribe and apologize to his brother and father. In some way, he wanted him to find reconciliation and peace with them. But the determined eyes Finn is displaying throughout his whole story meant that there is no going back from this. His mind is set ever since he first stepped foot in the tent.<br />
<br />
“There is no way of reversing this,” Even though there is. Alec just doesn’t want to waste his time with customers that regretted their decisions. “You know that, right?”<br />
<br />
“I know and I don’t care. I don’t want to have this life that I should have surrendered a long time ago.”<br />
<br />
He is truly sure about this. With that in mind, Alec stood from his chair and began the spell. With his right hand, he touched Finn. His eyes are closed while his breathing is shallow yet brimming with the excitement of what’s to come. With his left, he touched Alden - a pitiful boy whose life is going to end due to his brother’s envy. Such a pity.<br />
<br />
[Soul Manipulation: Body Swap]<br />
<br />
Alec’s body is a conduit of souls. He felt this many times in the past but each feels different - as if he’s done for the first time. Their souls passed through his body, and for a moment in time, he could feel the characteristics of their soul. Finn’s soul is a disgusting despot that is not even worthy of the dirtiest dump. The fringes are so green that it would put jade stones to shame. It flickered erratically and revolted at the slightest of manipulation. Alec was supposed to be the shepherd of his soul but Finn is too impatient and coursed immediately to its new home. On the other hand, Alden’s soul is a magnanimous luminous ball of light. It’s powerful yet it has this aura of childhood kindness and naivety, It may be bright but its flicker is afraid and confused. He may not be functioning outside but he feels what is happening. His brother has betrayed him. Instead of feeling angry, Alec could only describe his emotion as pity and sadness. Alden truly is a kind soul.<br />
<br />
The deed is done. What transpired is sickening to the gut, but business and business. The world goes on even with one bad thing added to the lot. He may not like it but seeing that Finn chose him for the transaction, Alec was kind enough to undo the [Trance] on Alden’s body and place it to Finn’s.<br />
<br />
Finn, now in Alden’s body, broke free from his grasp and let out a laugh of triumph, His hands touched his arms, torso, and legs. He admired the meticulous sculpture Alden has carefully curated throughout his years of travel. He may not have seen it but Alec knew that the kind welcoming face of Alden is forever gone, replaced by an arrogant smirk and a mocking grin on the looking glass. He opened his palm and called out the elements within his grasp. Every power Alden had and will have, is now at the palm of his hands.<br />
<br />
“Thank you,” he said. “With this body, I feel the most powerful person in the world.”<br />
<br />
Alec doubts that. Alden has potential but Alec has seen more powerful people than him. <br />
<br />
Alec looked over at the side where Alden, now in Finn’s body, lies crying and drooling on the floor. In a small slice of time during their swap, he must have realized the new reality that awaits. Forever a slave, in a trance, in someone else’s body while his brother is masquerading as him. <br />
<br />
“What are you going to do about him?” Alec pointed at Alden.<br />
<br />
“I haven’t thought that far. I didn’t even think that this body-swapping is real.”<br />
<br />
“Say, I scratch 10 dragon coins off your debt in exchange for him.”<br />
<br />
“What are you going to do with him?”<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry. No one will find who he is. He’ll be my slave.” And both of them know for a fact that slaves are required to wear masks in Alabaster. Slaves are properties - their faces are useless for a property. And besides, Alec knows that Finn will kill him and bury his old body in a shallow grave. Making Alden a slave is merciful as it is.<br />
<br />
“Good, you can have him. Make sure no one finds who he is, or I’ll tell the Church of Zelianthos of your whereabouts. I know they are asking for your head.”<br />
<br />
Alec grabbed him by the arm which Finn tried to swat with some petty elemental skill. Alec may be weaker than Finn, but he has better special skills that place him on par with triple ranked mages.<br />
<br />
“You dare speak the name of Zelianthos in my tent after what I did, bro? That’s a dick move. I’m not going to reverse the spell right now but I’ll leave this.” A mark seared on Finn’s skin, that of the letter A inside a circle. “This is my mark, a countdown for your debt. When this circle turns completely black in a year and you haven’t paid your a thousand dragon gold debt, you’ll return to your old body as my slave forever.”<br />
<br />
“A thousand dragon gold! Preposterous. My debt is less than a quarter of that.” Finn was going to hit him with fists made of burning ice until,<br />
<br />
“You want me to turn that year into a month?”<br />
<br />
The frozen hand turned into a puddle and Finn slinked in defeat. He knows his place and he’d be sure to remember that. <br />
<br />
Finn bid his defeated thanks and left the tent. What happened may have shaken him to the core but he still has his brother’s power and body, and that is more than enough for him.</p>
