<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After the crazy Saturday that Ethan spent at the mall, he came to the realisation that trying to completely eliminate his perverted itch was probably going to backfire in some way, exactly as it just had.<br />
<br />
Like a spring being compressed into a smaller and smaller space, the second his mental state was taken off guard by Eric swapping them, the suppressed splinter of his mind had uncoiled with full counter-force, pushing him in the opposite direction much too fast and too far.<br />
<br />
Yet, he also couldn&#39;t just let his obsession take over as an alter ego either. He had to manage it properly, and that meant occasionally indulging to release the pressure a little, letting it out to vent the steam. Not so much that he lost control and gave in, but just enough to scratch the itch without going all the way.<br />
<br />
It was scary to think that he would have to CHOOSE to be this way sometimes, but also exciting. During the following week, Eric was fair with swapping their shared junk, giving near equal time with both large and small dicks. Whenever Ethan was small at home, he spent a good amount of time wearing the new underwear. Either under clothes when he was around Eric, or lounging around doing homework/relaxing in his room, it was a private pleasure that he got to secretly dress like the little boy he had embodied -- in the one key area, that was.<br />
<br />
It was days later, on Thursday during the following week, that Lucas made a suggestion while they were talking at a swim practice. He asked if Ethan -- and Eric too -- were interested in staying over on Friday night. Not just that, but he mentioned wanting to see the ring in action, and explicitly suggested they could have some harmless fun with it. The Sorensen parents would be away until late on Saturday, so they would have the house to themselves for the night at least. Lucas also noted that Conor would have to be included in whatever they did, since he wasn&#39;t about to just exclude him from any group activity while guests were around, but ... only if Ethan was okay with doing all this?<br />
<br />
Ethan thought about it.<br />
<br />
He did owe Lucas some kind of demonstration with the ring, given how patient and understanding his boyfriend had been so far. Perhaps in a safe setting with the right people, it could be a really healthy experience to share?<br />
<br />
So, with that in mind, he accepted.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take any convincing for Eric to be sold on the idea of a sleepover, especially when Ethan told him of Lucas&#39; interest in the ring. Though Eric certainly had been through his own personal difficulty because of the swapping power&#39;s addictive indulgence, he had emerged from it confident and perhaps more adventurous than before. Ethan, on the other hand, had suffered self-inflicted trouble multiple times -- twice needing to be rescued by Eric, and once in the form of his freshly-escaped psychotic break from reality -- but it had only made him more cautious.<br />
<br />
Still, he wanted to let Lucas in on this part of his life, and with a good amount of level-headed determination and an openminded attitude, he drove himself and Eric over to the Sorensen house after school on Friday.<br />
<br />
Lucas invited them in, all smiles, and after introducing Conor to Eric, they did a quick tour. It wasn&#39;t as spacious and expensive as the houses in Haylee&#39;s neighbourhood, but it was still a pleasant well-furnished two story suburban home, with a backyard and pool. For Eric, it reminded him of Brandon&#39;s place, only a slight bit larger and better kept.<br />
<br />
Once the exploration was done and their overnight stuff brought inside and safely deposited, they moved in to the lounge at Lucas urging to relax. In what was clearly a premeditated choice -- and Ethan didn&#39;t mind at all, though he was surprised it came up straight away -- Lucas brought up the ring, telling Conor what it was, and asking if they could see it in action.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously?&quot; Conor snorted, and could hardly hold back laughter. &quot;A ring that gives you a swapping superpower? Magic isn&#39;t real, Lucas. Your boyfriend is pranking you, and you fell for it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, it&#39;s not a prank. The ring is real, and it does exactly what he said. I&#39;ll prove it.&quot; Ethan held up his right hand, where the band was on his index finger. Not needing to be told, Eric handed his baseball cap to his older brother, who put it on. It took only a moment for him to concentrate, and then his left hand shrank, becoming smaller, the fingers more delicate. Simultaneously, Eric&#39;s morphed larger, becoming that of an older teenager.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; breathed Lucas. &quot;So that&#39;s Eric&#39;s hand attached to your wrist, and vice versa? Hearing about it is one thing, but seeing it is better. That&#39;s super cool.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell? It&#39;s REAL?&quot; Conor&#39;s eyes bugged out in shock, unable to stop staring as Ethan reversed the swap again. &quot;No way, it&#39;s actually true! Oh my god!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep!&quot; Eric agreed. &quot;All real!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, uh, Ethan, I was thinking, how about we have some fun involving it -- if everybody&#39;s okay with that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure.&quot; Ethan answered Lucas, hesitant. &quot;What did you have in mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, let&#39;s have a little competition between the four of us, say, a video game console battle. I&#39;d choose an FPS, since everybody here has probably played one, even Eric.&quot; The younger Morales nodded, confirming he wasn&#39;t too young to be familiar with first-person shooters. Eric knew those games were designed for older audiences, but he also knew online lobbies were full of shit-talking smartass kids around his age.<br />
<br />
&quot;Each round, the winner and loser will perform a swap.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Lucas could continue, Conor interjected with a question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Swap what, though?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dicks.&quot; Lucas grinned, the declaration made so casually. &quot;We&#39;ve got four that go all the way from small -- no offence intended -- to much bigger. Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re afraid, little brother?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Definitely not.&quot; Conor was indignant. &quot;You two,&quot; he pointed to Lucas and Ethan, &quot;should be the ones afraid. I&#39;d kick your asses.&quot;<br />
<br />
Swapping dicks, just like at home, but with two extra participants? Ethan&#39;s uncertainty was waning, and he began to feel some excitement for the idea. This could be fun! But ... what if he got Eric&#39;s cock and had to swap it away, but couldn&#39;t? His heartbeat picked up, nervous at the thought of not being able to explain such a situation to the Sorensen boys.<br />
<br />
Ignoring Conor&#39;s bravado, Lucas kept on, detailing the rules.<br />
<br />
&quot;It would work like this: if the winner is smaller than the loser, they swap directly with each other. Otherwise, the winner trades up with whomever has the next largest cock, and the loser trades down for the next smaller. If they&#39;re already biggest winner or smallest loser, then there&#39;s no change and we just play again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, can we have one other rule?&quot; Eric glanced to Ethan, having already noticed the slight anxiousness in his brother&#39;s expression, and understanding what it was about. &quot;Just so it&#39;s simple for all of us, let&#39;s make it so whoever is getting smaller has to do the swap. Like, sort of as a punishment for not winning by making themselves shrink. Make it extra uncomfortable.&quot;<br />
<br />
Internally, Ethan breathed a big sigh of relief.<br />
<br />
Eric&#39;s quick thinking had made it so he would never be stuck with a swap he couldn&#39;t do. Thank god for his little brother!<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s fair, adds more pressure. It&#39;s not just a race to be first, but to NOT be last.&quot; Lucas nodded. &quot;But! There&#39;s more! The stakes would also be: we set a timer for a couple hours, and when it runs out, after that final round is done and any swaps completed ... then ... that&#39;s it! We all stay that way for the night, locked in until at least the following morning. SO ... who&#39;s in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hell yeah, I am!&quot; Conor answered immediately and brashly. &quot;We all know what the prize is. I&#39;m taking your boyfriend&#39;s cock. No diss to you Ethan, but that thing is gonna be mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m in.&quot; Eric rolled his eyes at Conor&#39;s response. This was a no-lose scenario for him, because it wasn&#39;t like he could end up with anything less than he began with, and maybe he could more publicly enjoy Ethan&#39;s size -- if he could win it, and keep it! &quot;It sounds like fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
For Ethan, the idea was appealing, but more than that, it was safe. None of his weird perverted obsession would be exposed, and he could enjoy the ring without worrying. Best of all, he got to involve Lucas as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I am too,&quot; he said. &quot;Let&#39;s do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
Firing up the lounge television and console, controllers were passed out to everyone, and Lucas chose the game, the popular FPS title Call of Honor: Modern Combat. Creating a private lobby, he added the other three, chose the rotation of free-for-all maps, and with a button press, launched the competition, along with a countdown timer on his phone.<br />
<br />
It was game on.<br />
<br />
Round One!<br />
<br />
The first map was an open one, with lots of sniping and ranged engagement, and minimal cover. It fit Ethan&#39;s style perfectly, and despite not being the best at FPS type games, he found himself picking off the others, the .50 cal making it easy. The younger two traded kills, but couldn&#39;t quite keep up with him, while Lucas struggled. The round ended with Ethan first, and Lucas last, with the other two tied in the middle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like you&#39;re the first loser, big bro, so that means you trade with MOI. Though, probably shouldn&#39;t be calling you that anymore.&quot; Conor stood up, smirking and dropping his controller on the couch. &quot;We all gotta strip! No point in this if it&#39;s all hidden! I wanna see this happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, he was pulling off his pants, then shirt, and in seconds was stark naked and plopping back onto the couch. The other three looked at each other and then shrugged and followed suit -- there wasn&#39;t any reason to be shy. Eric went full on naked too, but the older teenagers kept their shirts only.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, here it is.&quot; Lucas grimaced, and donned Conor&#39;s beanie, then took the ring from Ethan and put it on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, that felt ... weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
The sight of Conor&#39;s junk, midway in size between Eric and Lucas, and girded by a willful mess of ruddy pubes, looked very strange on the older Sorensen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dunno, I like it!&quot; Conor was admiring what he&#39;d received, which was on the larger size of average for seventeen, and was definitely big for fourteen. &quot;Next round! I want another upgrade!&quot;<br />
<br />
Round Two!<br />
<br />
The next map was more balanced, with a mix of camping spots and brawling areas. Eric got off to a great start, dominating the first couple of minutes, until Conor began to catch up, with Ethan trailing him by just a few kills. Again, Lucas wasn&#39;t playing well, and combined with sheer bad luck, he was at the bottom of the table, with Eric the clear winner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, this is ... a development,&quot; Lucas complained, as Eric passed his cap across.<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t that &#39;underdevelopment&#39; for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
For Ethan, watching Conor&#39;s penis transfer to Eric was even stranger than seeing attached to Lucas, with the red hair seeming particularly out of place. Eric&#39;s tiny package on Lucas was just as weird, and though he didn&#39;t begrudge his boyfriend, there was a faint hint of jealousy that he hadn&#39;t received it.<br />
<br />
Though, with that, another personal realisation arrived.<br />
<br />
Ethan didn&#39;t really care about winning. Not that he wasn&#39;t actively competing in good faith, because he was. There was no intent to sabotage the game, but he was okay with not being first. He was MORE than okay with it, and the idea of coming in last was perfectly fine. In fact, he decided to execute more risky daredevil plays, simply so there was a higher chance of things going wrong.<br />
<br />
Because, if he just so happened to die a bunch of times, place last, and be forced to adopt a smaller cock?<br />
<br />
Well, that would just be really unfortunate, wouldn&#39;t it?<br />
<br />
He smiled to himself as the new map began loading.<br />
<br />
Yeah, super unfortunate.<br />
<br />
Round Three!<br />
<br />
With raging dust obscuring it, and a bunch of mid-range cover, the next map was perfect for Conor&#39;s speed-runner strategy, which hadn&#39;t quite been enough the previous times. Finally, Lucas managed to hit his stride, pulling some clever grenade throws, and duking it out with Eric in the map centre. When the final score popped up, Conor was well ahead, with Lucas beating Eric by a couple of kills, and Ethan dead last.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah,&quot; he shrugged, taking Conor&#39;s beanie, &quot;ya got me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck yes!&quot; Conor crowed. &quot;To the victor go the spoils of war! Told you I was gonna take it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric and Lucas were openly gawking, as the younger Sorensen&#39;s crotch swelled to its full softness. It was difficult for Ethan to keep the light blush off his face -- any downgrade was fine with him, and this WAS the property of Lucas, a sentiment his boyfriend seemed to pick up on and chuckle at.<br />
<br />
&quot;My friends can&#39;t call me &#39;fire crotch&#39; anymore. They&#39;ll have to name me &#39;The Cannon&#39; instead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down, Mr Killstreak,&quot; Lucas laughed, &quot;it&#39;s won&#39;t be for more than a night, and you&#39;re not home yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I&#39;m gonna be. Watch me take this baby away!&quot; He patted it affectionately. &quot;Roll the next round!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Coming right up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Round Four.<br />
<br />
With long corridors and larger open rooms, the industrial park map worked in Conor&#39;s favour again. Though Eric was close behind him, he held the lead to the end, with Lucas some kills short. Ethan could have maybe pulled even with Lucas, but despite the fact that he wasn&#39;t meaning to deliberately mess up, he slacked off, and near the end forced a couple of errors he didn&#39;t have to make.<br />
<br />
There was a subtle thrill of excitement as Ethan mirrored Conor&#39;s repeat victory with a second defeat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Undefeated champion!&quot; Conor was gloating. &quot;Nobody can stop me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not my day, I guess.&quot; Ethan took Eric&#39;s cap, the ring still on his finger from the previous time. The familiar pulling sensation occurred, and he had to work very hard not to actually smile at seeing his penis shrink.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t Eric&#39;s, but it was close!<br />
<br />
By contrast, Eric himself was looking admiringly at his newly enlarged crotch, complete with well-trimmed blonde pubic hair that Lucas clearly took great care of.<br />
<br />
&quot;Missing something, Sorensen?&quot; Eric squished the shaft in demonstration.<br />
<br />
Lucas jokingly covered himself. &quot;Only a few years of my life downstairs, apparently.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll catch up to me eventually, bro.&quot; Conor snorted, slouching where he was sitting like a king lounging on a throne. &quot;Which of you three will be losing next?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s find out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Round Five.<br />
<br />
Set in an office complex, with a warren of small rooms, stairwells, and tight corners, for the third time, Conor seemed to immediately get the better of everyone. As it got going, the other three caught up a bit, with Eric and Lucas trailing him by only a few kills. Now unable to help himself, Ethan was doing his best to make mistakes, short of fully throwing the match, and was sitting in last yet again.<br />
<br />
Then, from nowhere, in the last minute of play, Lucas started a ridiculous quick rampage, focusing solely on Conor. It turned out the elder Sorensen was best at short range combat, and he put that to work. Knife, shotgun twice, pistols twice again, followed by SMG, and finishing it up with a grenade for the cherry on top. The younger Sorensen&#39;s kill-death ratio tanked, and as the round finished, he landed on the bottom of the table by a fraction, just behind Ethan&#39;s very underwhelming numbers<br />
<br />
Mere seconds later, the phone timer reached zero, signalling the end of the competition.<br />
<br />
Ethan&#39;s disappointment was very real, but he feigned a certain level of relief.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wasn&#39;t expecting THAT ending,&quot; he mumbled.<br />
<br />
Conor, on the other hand, was so surprised he had almost nothing to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;I put my favourite map last for a reason. If you thought you were making it out of this unscathed, you don&#39;t know who you&#39;re dealing with.&quot; The cunning smile on Lucas face was almost from ear to ear. &quot;I always get the BEST scores when I play with pistols and knives.&quot; Snatching up Conor&#39;s beanie from where it lay on the coffee table, Lucas took the ring from Ethan. &quot;Say goodbye to it now, little brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
With an expression full of disbelief, the bragging turned silent, Conor looked on as he shrank ... and shrank and shrank ... to the smallest option.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, so, &#39;til tomorrow, right?&quot; His voice was impishly soft, trying to recapture the earlier suaveness with humour. &quot;I mean, it&#39;s JUST one evening, yeah?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric giggled at this, while Ethan and Lucas were pulling on their underwear, before the latter stood up, dragging Ethan with him. &quot;Maybe. Maybe we&#39;ll make it longer?&quot;<br />
<br />
Then Lucas was away, Ethan&#39;s hand in his, as they trailed through the house towards the bedroom.<br />
<br />
Conor looked down at himself, and let out a breath.<br />
<br />
It was going to be a long night.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
For a while afterward, Eric hung out with Conor, both of them properly dressed. They got along well, though Eric had never been friendly with the class-clown types that Conor seemed to embody. He was cool enough though, and without a bigger audience to play to, was a lot less rambunctious and loud. With the fighting done with, they played some co-op JRPGs, talked, drank some soda, and ate some of the junk food Conor foraged from the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Eric had to use the bathroom, so he excused himself, and went.<br />
<br />
Relieving himself was a new experience, and he took the time to examine what he was working with. Not as big as Ethan&#39;s -- which wasn&#39;t an insult, because basically nobody was -- the penis he had borrowed was the next best thing. Lucas kept it clean and tidy, and it was definitely on the larger side of average for seventeen. Eric had become something of an expert on size estimations, a thought that he knew was funny for somebody his age to be having.<br />
<br />
He wasn&#39;t the normal eleven year old, though. The ring had taught him SO much more than what his peers knew, and it had definitely helped him apply his brain in ways that gave him all sorts of insight he shouldn&#39;t have possessed.<br />
<br />
Still, he couldn&#39;t help but wonder -- how big was this one when it was hard?<br />
<br />
Wiping himself dry, he dropped the paper in, put the toilet lid down, and sat. Stroking it, it began to swell and thicken, until it was all the way hard.<br />
<br />
Not bad at all. It had to be at least seven inches, probably a little over that. More manageable than Ethan&#39;s leviathan girth-wise, too. Also probably easier to fit in the mouth for the same reason.<br />
<br />
In the mouth?<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder if I can,&quot; Eric thought to himself. &quot;It&#39;s about three inches shorter, but I can curl up really easy. I&#39;m not great at gym class, but I&#39;m super flexible, more than other boys. I can do stuff they only WISH they could.&quot;<br />
<br />
Leaning forward, he bent down, getting closer, until ... with some effort ... contact.<br />
<br />
It took more effort to reach, but he had swallowed Ethan&#39;s cock most of the way before, so he was sure he could do that here. Though he loved the size of his brother&#39;s masterpiece, it was true that this was a great size for sucking. Big enough to wrap his lips around comfortably, but not TOO big that he had to focus on his muscle control so he didn&#39;t choke. It was ideal, and he began to carefully hump his own face, not wanting to prolong his bathroom visit to the point of suspicion.<br />
<br />
With almost no warning, his muscles clenched, his cock going iron hard, and then it was exploding down his throat. Eric moaned around it while it spasmed and shot, easily swallowing everything his balls sent, normally accustomed to Ethan&#39;s much more voluminous output. It tasted different too. Not worse, or better, just different.<br />
<br />
Sitting up and stretching himself out again, he caught his breath, and made sure it all vanished down into his stomach. Eric licked his lips and sat back, tucking the larger Sorensen&#39;s dick away, before he stood, zipped up, flushed the toilet, and went to wash his hands.<br />
<br />
While it couldn&#39;t live up to the impossibly high standard he had for Ethan&#39;s cock, what Lucas had was pretty good -- a happy second.<br />
<br />
Though, he considered as he left the bathroom, he had to wonder if the first place holder was enjoying his prize just as much.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope,&quot; Eric thought as he returned back to the unfortunate Conor, &quot;they&#39;ll definitely be enjoying that thing more.&quot;<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
The moment they reached the bedroom, Lucas closed the door. It was tidy, with more floor space than Ethan&#39;s own, a double bed, closet, dresser, and a little study desk with a laptop. Lucas tugged him across to the bed, finally letting go of his hand once they were both sitting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about Conor. He&#39;s kind of an idiot with stuff like this. At least my plan didn&#39;t backfire, he needed to be taken down a peg.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot; Ethan smiled, the performative anxiety of the game and the need to cover his true feelings beginning to fade now that they were alone. &quot;I kinda figured you must have planned this out. Didn&#39;t expect to be dick-trading like Eric and I do at home sometimes, but it wasn&#39;t a problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted you and your brother to be comfortable, and have fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t have to worry about Eric,&quot; Ethan laughed. &quot;And me? It WAS fun, but ... um ... were you- ... were you wanting to go further?&quot; He scooted a little closer to Lucas, their knees touching. &quot;I mean, you DID bring me right to your room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot; Lucas was surprised. &quot;Well, I&#39;d be lying if I said I don&#39;t want to enjoy being the winner, but ... that doesn&#39;t seem fair to you when you&#39;re stuck with, uh, the third place consolation prize.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan swallowed nervously. How could he explain to Lucas that he didn&#39;t think of his current state as third largest, but as second smallest? That the order of value was backwards to him, and winning and losing were really opposites? That the only thing that could have made this more interesting was if he had managed to beat Conor to the bottom of the table and claimed the &#39;real&#39; prize?<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t mind. I- ... want to.&quot; He reached over and undid the top button on Lucas pants, the enhanced bulge filling it out more than it normally would. His voice sounded a little shaky from the daring boldness of his behaviour. &quot;Maybe we can ... pretend? Like, um, you&#39;re 17.&quot; He brushed his fingers over the impressive crotch bump, then indicated to his own. &quot;And I&#39;m 14. So that means, you&#39;re a senior who has a secret freshman boyfriend, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
His fingers continued on down to the next button, undoing the fly.<br />
<br />
OH.<br />
<br />
Now Lucas understood!<br />
<br />
Haylee hadn&#39;t been wrong about there being a sexual dynamic for Ethan.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right.&quot; Lucas played into it, and he shifted fully up onto the bed, sitting back with his legs slightly spread, and nudging Ethan up too. &quot;And I&#39;d love for you to put those pretty lips to work, babe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heart racing, Ethan got comfortable sitting in the space in front of him, and slipped a hand into the fly to pull out the goods. It was hardening as he held it, and his mind went a little blank.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d never done anything with a boy before, and this was literally his cock.<br />
<br />
Face to face, it was enormous, longer and thicker than it had ever seemed on his own body. There was something very intimidating about the sight, and he wondered if this was what girls had felt like seeing him before, but ... he was also getting very turned on, because it looked REALLY good attached to Lucas.<br />
<br />
With only a slight hesitation, he leaned in and kissed the tip, then immediately took the whole head in. Opening his mouth wider, he began to slide his lips down the shaft. It was like a marathon, and he went slowly, throat straining and eyes watering as he descended.<br />
<br />
He never remembered it being THIS big.<br />
<br />
There was probably another five inches to go, and Ethan had no idea how he could get all the way, but somehow, he felt another inch glide in, and he let out a muffled sound of astonishment and ... enjoyment?<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmmf. Mrrrhmm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haah, that feels- ... great, baby.&quot; Lucas whispered breathily. &quot;That&#39;s amazing!&quot;<br />
<br />
Another inch followed, and Ethan couldn&#39;t stop his right hand from extracting his own cock, while his left encircled the base of the one in his mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a freshman,&quot; he thought to himself, focusing on the sensation of yet another inch stretching and pressing against the lining of his throat. &quot;A freshman who is sucking his older boyfriend&#39;s huge cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
His hand ran up and down his borrowed penis; stiff, hot, and smooth. A bit over five inches at the most, the fact that he was fourteen, younger and smaller, made all the impressive length of dick crammed inside that much more exciting.<br />
<br />
&quot;MMmmph! Mhhmmm!&quot; Ethan was sucking now in earnest, almost slobbering as he barely had space to move. His tongue rubbed around the girth, in time with the thrum of Lucas excitement, and in tune with the hand stroking cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh, you&#39;re- ... you&#39;re the cutest!&quot; Lucas panted, abs tensing, grabbing at the sheets as he enjoyed the blowjob. &quot;The sexiest, the best!&quot;<br />
<br />
The cutest. The sexiest!<br />
<br />
Ethan&#39;s hand sped up, and he sucked even harder, closer, wetter, as tightly and quickly as he could. He wanted to please his well-hung hot senior-year boyfriend. He wanted to make him burst!<br />
<br />
With a final moan, Lucas did.<br />
<br />
The giant shaft lodged in Ethan&#39;s throat began to pulse, and then he was swallowing rapidly, his eyes wide in shock at the flooding quantity, his own pleasure cresting with the clear sound of his liquid splattering on the bedding. He was done fast, his youthful orgasm quick and intense, but Lucas kept on for a little longer. A few more seconds of swallowing, and the pumping subsided, the bigger cock finally spent.<br />
<br />
Lifting off it, Ethan sat up, the softening dick reversing course out of his mouth with a slick movement and wet with saliva and remnant cum. He coughed, and they looked at each other while they caught their breath. <br />
<br />
Breaking the silence, Lucas reached over and grabbed a towel from the laundry pile on the dresser near the bed. He wiped himself and the sheets clean, before offering it to Ethan, who was starting to feel the embarrassment kick in after the horniness had worn off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ethan, roleplay aside, that was seriously ... incredible.&quot; Lucas watched him finish cleaning up, both of them tucking themselves away and fastening up again at the same time. &quot;I wanted to do something with you, but I didn&#39;t know how to approach you about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan dumped the used towel to the side, and then moved up next to Lucas, and lay against his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry if I&#39;m weird about sex. Guys are just new for me.&quot; He hesitated -- perhaps he could tell Lucas ... more?<br />
<br />
Let him in on some things that only Eric knew?<br />
<br />
&quot;And it&#39;s also because, um,&quot; he dragged it out, fear gripping him, &quot;I ... uh ... I- ... I like having a small penis.&quot;<br />
<br />
There.<br />
<br />
He had admitted it, out loud.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ever since Eric and I started swapping, I&#39;ve been this way.&quot; He couldn&#39;t help himself from trying to lay it all out, so it made sense, or at least didn&#39;t seem like he was some perverted freak.<br />
<br />
Inside, he still felt like he WAS one, but he didn&#39;t want Lucas to believe that!<br />
<br />
&quot;It turns me on. I started thinking about it all the time. Like, hiding it at school so I don&#39;t get caught. I know it&#39;s really weird, but I ... can&#39;t help it.&quot; He gave a nervous laugh, though he wasn&#39;t at all in the mood for jokes. &quot;If I ignore it I just think about it more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, maybe you have a size fetish?&quot; Lucas response was measured, and even. &quot;Did you think that would actually bother me?&quot;<br />
<br />
What?<br />
<br />
Was ... he okay with this?<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a bit different from what I was expecting, but I&#39;m not going to dump you because you enjoy small dicks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even if it&#39;s like ... Eric&#39;s size?&quot; Ethan could hardly say the words, his face now gone so red he could only press it against Lucas shoulder, the sentence coming out like it was strangled because he scarcely believed he was discussing this with someone who wasn&#39;t his little brother. &quot;You&#39;d be ... okay with me being like that around you more often? I mean ... op- ... openly?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucas grabbed an amazed Ethan&#39;s chin and pulled it up so their eyes met, before he planted a kiss.<br />
<br />
&quot;Even if it&#39;s Eric&#39;s size.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan was dumbstruck.<br />
<br />
His secret was revealed, and ...<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Lucas didn&#39;t care!<br />
<br />
He certainly didn&#39;t have any worries about the sleepover now.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
The following day, the Morales brothers returned home around midday. After the initial fun of the game and following interlude, the rest of the evening was spent all four of them together. They created homemade pizzas, watched a couple of movies, joked around, and made the most of Conor&#39;s ego-inflicted deficiency. He was a good sport about it, but clearly found the experience disconcerting and the physical sensations discomforting.<br />
<br />
Once they got home, Ethan was relieved to see their dad had gone out again. Sitting with Eric in the lounge, they unwound from the socialising and talked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry for keeping Lucas dick from you guys.&quot; Eric was making light, though there was a thread of truth to it. &quot;I know you two probably did some sex stuff while you were alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I should have tried harder at Call of Honor.&quot; Ethan smiled and shrugged. &quot;You must have enjoyed it yourself though, Conor said you took a while visiting the bathroom.&quot;<br />
<br />
For a few long seconds, the younger was silent, but then, shyly, as if he wasn&#39;t sure he should even mention it, he said in a small voice: &quot;Actually, I- ... I was sucking it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait ... WHAT?&quot; Ethan&#39;s eyes bugged out and he stared at Eric. &quot;You can DO that?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; His voice was soft and guilty, like he&#39;d been caught committing a crime.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eric, that&#39;s- .... that&#39;s ... fucking amazing!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not upset?&quot;<br />
<br />
If Lucas could accept his own perversion, Ethan could absolutely 100% accept Eric&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! That&#39;s honestly really impressive! Like, I think for that you have to be really flexible, like people that do yoga, and kinda well hung. Not that the last part is problem when we&#39;re swapping, but still -- really impressive!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you&#39;d tell me off or something.&quot; Eric mumbled. &quot;Like when I messed up with the dogs. I&#39;m glad you aren&#39;t mad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Ethan shook his head. &quot;Because it&#39;s something that complements how you already are. We didn&#39;t end up with what we wanted at the Sorensens, because you would have been happiest with the biggest cock, just like I would have been happiest with the smallest. It&#39;s almost like we&#39;re meant to be like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Meant to be like that.<br />
<br />
The words resonated in Eric&#39;s mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;What if,&quot; he said, soft but serious, &quot;we are?&quot;<br />
<br />
They both looked at each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eric,&quot; Ethan murmured, &quot;what ... do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Eric whispered his reply back. &quot;I just feel like ... I want this more, in some way?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How would that work? What else is there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; he repeated. &quot;But I think you feel the same.&quot;<br />
<br />
Was Eric suggesting something different from their current sharing arrangement?<br />
<br />
The ring was only capable of so much, and couldn&#39;t just grant wishes.<br />
<br />
Ethan wasn&#39;t sure how to manifest whatever Eric was hinting at, which sounded like something ... less temporary.<br />
<br />
But, Eric was right.<br />
<br />
Ethan DID feel the same.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure what we can realistically do.&quot; He told his younger brother, who nodded solemnly at the response. &quot;Maybe there&#39;s a way, but I&#39;ll have to think about what&#39;s possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
He wasn&#39;t certain what that way would be, but he was interested in finding out.</p>
