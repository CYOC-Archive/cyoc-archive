<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You point at the doll sitting on the left side of the bed. You weren&#39;t sure which girl it was, but you knew that you definitely didn&#39;t want to see Nym, especially in this getup. Even though your identity wasn&#39;t easily found, you&#39;d rather not get any closer to him than necessary. The doll pointed to herself, almost as if in surprise, before getting up and leaving the room, maid following behind her. <br />
<br />
You were surprised that the situation resolved itself so quick. The other blonde doll in the room made no move to come get you, so you allowed yourself the freedom to stand up and get a feel for things. You feel tight as you walk around and your breathing is shallow due to the corset and gag. Your garters that rested on your thighs pulled on your stockings as you walked around, creating this gentle rhythm of alternating pressure on your legs. Your walking felt a bit off as well as you felt your legs pushed in together a bit more than you were accustomed to. You tugged on the belts at the tips of your stockings, trying to slip them off or unclasp them, but your efforts were to no avail. Your gloved hands fumbled around on the metal buckles and the belts themselves held on fast to the sheer latex they clung to. You started to peel back the panties, but abruptly stopped as the vibrators vigorously started up again inside of you. Maybe you&#39;ll keep those on for now.<br />
You rubbed your hand across the smooth skin above your crotch as well as your thighs. You would&#39;ve never have expected feeling yourself would be this good. Hands climbing upwards, you grabbed your waist, firmly squeezed by the corset. It was almost alien that your waist was this thin. And next...<br />
You gave an experimental squeeze of &#39;your&#39; breasts. They were large, plump even. The latex top did a good job of holding them in place, but this only made the feeling of the breasts pushing against your chest only be magnified. You pushed them together and felt a twinge of joy as they bounced back to position. You knew it was probably futile, but even still, you reached up and tried to remove the belt at your neck. It held, leaving you no access point to remove the latex top. You brushed aside the feathery strands of hair as you traced your hand up your back, following the trail of the zipper. Sure enough, it terminated somewhere inside your mask, which was equally inaccessible as well, locked onto your head as it was. <br />
<br />
You tried to take a sigh; it looked like you were at the mercy to these two girls, at least until the timer on the belts wore off. While you were busy examining yourself, the other doll had left the bed and was over by the closet. She removed the belt around her neck and deftly lifted the doll mask off her head, revealing Blue to be the one with you in the room. She looked over at you and said slyly, &quot;What? You thought we&#39;d lock ourselves in for 24 hours? There are so many better experiences we could be experience during that time.&quot;<br />
She opened up the closet and set the doll head on a shelf and began to remove the other articles of clothing. You wandered around the room, looking for any possible ways to escape or something to gain an advantage over Blue. As nice as you did feel right now, you were still their prisoner. But was their &#39;protection&#39; better than being without their help? You weren&#39;t quite sure yet.<br />
<br />
As you were walking around, you wandered onto a floor panel with a curious design. As soon as you stepped on it, beams of light burst out from an adjacent wall and traced your figure on their way up. They neatly ducked back into the wall, leaving you stunned. On a nearby counter, a gray-blue clump was being dumped onto the countertop. You were startled as you realized Blue had come next to you. <br />
&quot;Oh, I forgot that we hadn&#39;t turned it off. I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve ever tried making a suit from someone that was already wearing a lot.&quot; There was an alluring grin on her face now as she said, &quot;I suppose there is only one way to find things out.&quot;<br />
As she started over to the suit, you backed away and tried to put as much distance from her as you could. Suddenly, you felt a nerve twinge as the vibrations started up again, instantly sending you keeling over and struggling with the flurry of sensations. Blue began to waltz over with the newly crafted rubber suit in her hands. &quot;Your outfit is able to transfer vibrations to key parts in your body, such as your nervous system.&quot; She hefted the suit up in front of your face. &quot;What&#39;s interesting about this is that the inside of this suit is tailor-made for what you&#39;re currently wearing. There are indentations inside for each of your belts, while still ensuring a smooth surface on the outside. It doesn&#39;t have any eye holes, but we have a workaround already prepared. <br />
<br />
Blue bent down and began to feed your legs into the rubber suit, while you lay paralyzed helplessly, dildos rattling away inside of you. She seemed to make quicker progress this time compared to your initial transformation as their was only a suit to don this time. From your limited vision, you could see the blue-gray suit began to pass your waist. True to her word, it encompassed your body perfectly and soon she was up to your neck. As the hood was being pulled up to the top of your doll head, taking care not to leave any doll hair out, the zipper was rushed to the top and you were now blind. Combined with your ability to speak already being deprived, you felt very scared. Bizarrely, your vision soon brightened quickly and you found yourself looking at the ceiling of the room. This struck you as strange because you were most definitely still facing to the side on the floor. You jumped inside a little as Blue&#39;s face suddenly entered your view, and remarkably, your view changed to come closer to her at eye level. <br />
&quot;There is a screen placed in front of your mask&#39;s eyes. I&#39;ve hooked it up to a camera we have so you can see yourself.&quot;<br />
She set the camera up on a table, carefully adjusting it so it faced you. It was almost surreal to be looking at the gray, rubber mannequin curled up on the floor. You knew it was you, but there was no way you could look like that. You watched as Blue began to put another skinsuit to cover the manneq- to cover you. It was you, even though you felt disconnected. Soon you were now covered in another skinsuit, with long, chocolate brown hair, red eyes, and an open mouth, begging for something to fill it.<br />
A maid outfit was now being laid out and you were being dressed again. Black tights were rolled up your legs as black heels were fastened on to your feet. Black ribbons were tied around above your ankle as well. A typical black maid outift, with a white apron, was pulled down over your head, with the sleeves being tied off at your wrists with more black ribbon. Finally, a final black ribbon was tied around your neck with a neat bow. <br />
<br />
Blue then stepped back and tugged on a dangling rope cord by the wall. From the ceiling , a large amount of red rope descended, snaking into a pile next to you. You felt your eyes widen in horror as Red begin to take the rope towards you. First, she tied the rope together to go around your head. One rope came back behind your brown hair and was placed around your mouth, with an interlocking section going over your head. Next, Blue quickly made a typical rope harness to go on your body; she seemed to have experience with creating it. The harness was placed on your body, profoundly surrounding your breasts, as well as tying your arms together so they were above your butt. She then looped the rope multiple times around the top of your thighs and bound them together. To finalize it, she did the same to your ankles.Each section was then connected to one part at the end of the dangling part, placing your body in a scorpion position. With the whirl of a mechanical crank, you felt your body being lugged upwards and you watched as you were suspended by a good 5 feet of the ground. <br />
There was something about the sight that aroused you. While on the outside, it simply looked like a doll dressed as a maid suspended, you knew that inside was a blonde doll wearing a tight bondage outfit. Who would look any farther in to discover a gagged and aroused teenage male inside? <br />
<br />
You were knocked out of your reverie, by Red bursting into the room quickly, doll head cradled in her arms. She looked panicked. What she told Blue was...</p>
