<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was around the time his sister had just spread out the blanket for an outdoor tea party and their mother had called out that was ready that he felt himself come back. It was also about this time that the voice in his mind also came back.<br />
<br />
As he stood, realising that he had just spent an entire morning playing with Angela, and had been enjoying it, acting like a girl, the voice inside his head stated, &quot;This is not who you are. You are a ten-year-old boy and she is a six-year-old girl. You shouldn't be enjoying this. She's your younger sister,&quot; but all this was drowned out as the voice promptly switched course and said, &quot;She's your older sister. Of course you're supposed to enjoy playing with her. You're five. She's six. This is what sister's do when they get along.&quot;<br />
<br />
Following Angela inside, sitting down at the table, listening to the voice present two compelling arguments, Jeff felt himself being torn as he thought that what he was hearing was his own consciousness struggling to comprehend what was going on.<br />
<br />
As his mommy set a sandwich down he asked, &quot;Mommy? Am I still being punished?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For what?&quot; she replied as she set another sandwich down in front of Angela and when Jeff didn't right away answer, she glanced at him and said once again, &quot;For what?&quot; to which he shrugged as he found himself drawing a blank as to what he had been being punished for in the first place.<br />
<br />
Before he could say anything, Angela asked, &quot;Can I and Jenny play in the sprinkle this afternoon?&quot; to which Jeff added, &quot;And the pool?&quot;<br />
<br />
Their mother, apparently forgetting what Jeff had asked, first corrected Angela, telling her, &quot;Jenny and I,&quot; and than nodding, she told that it was okay and then headed for the kitchen, leaving the two to finish their meals, only coming back once to place a glass a milk next to each of their plates.<br />
<br />
As Jeff thanked her for the milk and than slowly continued to eat his peanut butter sandwich, he idly kicked his feet back and forth. As he did so, he wondered what it was mommy had apparently forgot about his punishment, thinking that maybe she had only acted like that to lull him. &quot;But why didn't Angela say anything,&quot; Jeff thought to himself as he picked at his crisps, took another drink from his cup and than finished his sandwich in two bites.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Jenny,&quot; Angela squealed out and realising his sister was already done, Jeff scooped up the rest of his crisps and followed her up to their room.<br />
<br />
Munching the crisps, he arrived just as Angela was shedding the last of her clothes and heading toward her dresser. Finishing his lunch, suddenly feeling like he should even be in the same room as this naked, six year old girl and that seeing her as so, Jeff blinked and was about to turn to leave when the voice said, &quot;And why shouldn't you see her naked. You're both girls and it isn't like you haven't seen each other naked before, as you've bathed and changed in front of each plenty of times.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unsure how he should take this, Jeff found that something about this rang of some truth as he found himself shucking off the pink bib-overalls. As he sister pulled on a red one piece bathing suit, Jeff kicked off his underwear and removed his shirt as he took a light blue one piece suit out of his dresser. Putting it on, he discovered it forced his male genitals between his legs, making him look more like a girl. But then his sister called out, &quot;Come on Jenny,&quot; and forgetting how torn he was between the ten year old boy he was sure he was the five year girl he was also sure he was, he smiled and ran after his sister, laughing and squealing in delight at what they were about to do.<br />
<br />
Outside, both barely noted that the blanket, tea set and plush animals had been moved up onto the patio as they ran toward the kiddie pool and just as they reached it, Jeff had a momentary lapse as he thought, &quot;This is wrong. I'm a ten year old boy, not a five year old girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
But than Angela splashed him and the thoughts were driven out of his mind as he splashed her back, chased her across the kiddie pool and through the sprinkle their mother had left running.<br />
<br />
Completely losing himself once again, Jeff only partly came back to himself when their mommy called them in for dinner and wrapping a towel around his shoulders, Jeff once again found himself listening to a voice warring back and forth, spinning one debate after another, first trying to convince him that he was ten year old boy. And than trying to convince him that he was five-year-old girl.<br />
<br />
But than both sides of the argument of what his sex and age was where driven away as mommy announced, &quot;After dinner you two are getting a bath,&quot; and realising that he was supposed to take a bath with Angela, Jeff balked, not liking the idea of sharing a bath with Angela.<br />
<br />
Trying to come up with a reasonable reason as to why he and Angela should have separate baths, Jeff found himself drawing a blank as he once again came back to the question of whether he was a five year old girl or a ten year old boy. And as tried to sort this out, dinner passed way to quickly for Jeff's liking as he found himself once again slowly stripping before his sister, who clearly had no issue removing her bathing suit in front of Jeff, as their mommy filled the tub with warm water and a pleasant smelling bubble bath.<br />
<br />
As Jeff climbed in with Angela and let mommy scrub his hair, Jeff tried to sort out the day that had passed so fast he hadn't thought such a thing possible until today. When mommy started to wash Angela, he attempted to come to terms as to what his age and sex really was. When they were told to get out, both smelling strongly of berries, Jeff still was at a loss as to what was going on as he was handed a pair of white panties with pink and purples heart printed on them and a nightgown with a pattern of shooting stars on the front, both of which he put on without a second thought and than followed Angela downstairs.<br />
<br />
Finding Mr Sparkles on the couch, Jeff lay down and cuddled the plush unicorn close, his mind racing as he watched the various programmes playing. When their mommy told them it was time for bed, Jeff found himself only to glad to go to bed, hoping that tomorrow would bring some answers, but silently figuring that it wouldn't as mommy tucked both him and Angela in.</p>
