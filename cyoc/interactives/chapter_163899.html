<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Deion the next day got up stretching as usual, his muscles aching from the full force marathon he put them all through the prior day. He groaned and looked at himself in the mirror by his bed, &quot;Damn, I knew those fucking squats at the end were probably a mistake...&quot; He got up and examined himself, seeing his cornrows still present and realizing that they didn&#39;t look half bad. In fact, they honestly looked better than his hair just plain and his hair done up in an afro did. As per the usual, Deion found himself first doing some flexing and enjoying the pleasing aesthetic of his muscles, then checking and seeing how long it&#39;d take for his latest book to get there on Amazon, and then getting dressed.<br />
<br />
But the fact was as time went on, it was getting easier and easier, he realized, to really just get used to and even like what he had become. There was no question he liked how he looked as this bodybuilding / football stud far better than he&#39;d liked being the wrestler he used to be. And honestly, as he looked at his black skin every single morning, he couldn&#39;t quite bring himself to dislike it. Sure he would like to return to being Alec, but he wanted to keep these muscles. The prospect of maybe actually having to stay Black was less and less of a difficult thing for him to accept.<br />
<br />
That morning as Deion got dressed in his usual tank top, shorts, and a jock jacket, he looked himself over again and smiled a little at himself. Today he had a pretty interesting little to do list. He was gonna try and reconnect again with Kayla, maybe not going forward romantically, and definitely check out if Savannah was into him. She definitely seemed to be so---<br />
<br />
&quot;Oof, Deion, man, no time for a wank this morning...&quot; Deion told himself as once again his libido started to act up. Cupping his groin and trying to force it down, all that did was make Deion quiver from the contact. But he still kept with it and managed to stop himself before he could get too far into this. He had to get his breakfast and head out to school. He certainly didn&#39;t want to be late. At the very least he still kept to his good schedule. <br />
<br />
As the black teen finished up breakfast as per usual, he got everything together plus a comb just in case he needed to keep his hair in order. &quot;Muscle, check, my dashing good looks, also check, backpack and valuables, check.&quot; And with that Deion headed out. The girls were as usual on their way to school so close by his own house. He soaked up their admiring stares and the way they thought they were being so subtle checking out his ass.<br />
<br />
But it seemed Kayla was not there today. Made him tilt his head a fair bit, but he shrugged and guessed she was dealing with something or was sick.<br />
<br />
As he got to school, Savannah immediately met him by the lockers, &quot;Deion, we are gonna need to talk about you and Kayla.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Kayla? Did something happen? I didn&#39;t see her with the other girls this morning.&quot; Deion replied, now feeling a good deal more concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;She went crazy last night, talking about her old boyfriend and you. Apparently she thought something happened. Her parents kept her home today while she sees a therapist.&quot; Savannah stated, looking around, and then said, &quot;I don&#39;t want this goin&#39; around school. I&#39;ll have Z E R O part in rumors. You&#39;re too hot to be involving yourself in loser grade politics like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
And thus she went off to her first period class, leaving Deion standing there looking perplexed and rather concerned.<br />
<br />
He decided he&#39;d need to like, facetime her or something and see what was going on, but that was when the bell rang and Deion hurried off to class. Damn it seemed like things were more complicated than he knew. But at least he could deal with that when the time came after school. Now he could just concentrate on dealing with class and his classmates.<br />
<br />
By the time the obligatory PE class came around, Deion was actually feeling pretty excited to see what had become of good ol&#39; Dave. While that weird episode Dave had was pretty...gross, he was also starting to wonder when Dave might notice something was awry. And Deion did admit now he had something of an affinity for PE. As Deion sat down in the locker room in an entire row of jocks and assorted sportsy guys taking off their clothes and putting on their PE clothes, he saw who he was looking for before long.<br />
<br />
There was Dave, talking and joking around with his friends about girls he&#39;d had sex with lately. As well as making an odd crack about one guy&#39;s ass.<br />
<br />
Dave had definitely changed. His body looked a bit more tanned than prior, and it seemed the transformation he was undergoing was a bit more slow still than what Deion underwent. His lips were slightly thicker, his nose slightly broader, his features in his face all around somewhat broader, more masculine. His musculature had if anything continued to tone up and increase in size - his glutes probably required a special size boxer brief, and even then Deion could see every dimple of that ass through the boxer brief.<br />
<br />
His biceps and triceps made distinct impressions on his arm and pushed outward enough that every distinct part of the bicep and tricep was visibly toned and jacked. He heard Dave groan in relief when the shirt came off and let Dave&#39;s massive shoulders and traps breath - that shirt was definitely getting a little too tight. The abs were like a cobblestone road almost, Deion swore. The obliques perfectly complimented every single striation of the abs. And it didn&#39;t take much for Dave&#39;s lats to poke out from his back and show at virtually any angle.<br />
<br />
He had been buff before, but the transformation was making Dave look incredible.<br />
<br />
As the guys started clearing out, Deion was one of the few left still changing into his PE clothes alongside...Dave. Deion looked over at him just in time for Dave to ask, &quot;You like what you see? I&#39;m just getting better and better. Hot damn do I look good...&quot;<br />
<br />
Deion even saw Dave&#39;s manhood, erect as can be in those increasingly tight shorts. He was turning himself on with just words. Deion asked him, &quot;Are you...sure this is all---?&quot;<br />
<br />
He was interrupted quickly, &quot;All what? All good? How can it be anything but good if it turns me on so fucking much and makes me this jacked fucking muscle stud...mmph...I&#39;ll be out soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, what are you even---&quot; Deion said as he got up, trying to indicate it was time to head out to go, you know, head to class.<br />
<br />
Dave however grinned and said, &quot;I gotta jack off first.&quot; And with that, Dave got up and headed into the bathroom part of the locker room. There&#39;d be nobody in here until class got done. Deion looked at the door and then looked where Dave went off.</p>
