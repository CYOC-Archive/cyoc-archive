<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I don’t what or who gave me this power. It could have been the electric shock I got in fourth grade when I was tricked into putting a fork in a toaster. Perhaps it had something to do with the storm six weeks ago that tormented the small town I live in: Granger, Idaho. Maybe it was the expired Lucky Charms I ate a couple months ago that tasted suspiciously like Reese’s Puffs. I don’t think I’ll ever know, but one day I woke up with a new ability. I, Tyson McKinley, have the power to change the size of men’s genitals and give them an orgasm whenever I felt like it.<br />
<br />
It started a month ago when I did it to myself. I stood in the shower shaving my pubes and staring at my measly excuse for a penis. It was three inches hard and my balls were maybe the size of grapes. The rest of the boys in my class all had horse cocks and had mocked me since seventh grade. <br />
<br />
I willed my penis to grow bigger, putting all my energy into it. I envisioned it happening in my mind and replayed it over and over again, but I felt nothing. Dejected, I got out of the shower and started to put clothes on. <br />
<br />
But then it happened. I tore my clothes off again and looked in amazement. My penis must have been 8 inches in length, with a pair of softball sized balls swinging below. <br />
<br />
I had a thought. I envisioned cum shooting out of my throbbing cock. I though of millions of sperm rushing out of my testicles and out of my shaft. After a few minutes of concentration, it happened. <br />
<br />
The best orgasm of my life resulted in a loud moan and warm, sticky cum all over the bathroom mirror.<br />
<br />
Over the next few days I improved my skills. After a week I was able to change the shape and size of my dick and balls just by seeing it in my mind. I could give myself an orgasm with a snap of my fingers.<br />
<br />
Then I had the thought of using the power on others. I decided to try it out the next day in the locker room.<br />
<br />
* * * <br />
<br />
I had just begun changing my underwear when I heard snickering behind me. I turned to see Michael Davenport and his group of jocks, all wearing nothing but jock straps.<br />
<br />
Michael’s huge grin quickly went away when he say my penis. I added a couple more inches in my mind and Michael and his side kicks screamed in what was terror for some and amazement for others. They tried to run but I snapped my fingers and they all doubled over with immense pleasure. Wet spots began forming on all over their jock straps.<br />
<br />
They couldn’t move from the pleasure. I decided not to let them have any more fun. In my mind I envisioned all of their cocks shrinking into little stubs and their huge balls becoming the size of blueberries. <br />
<br />
Their eyes bugged out when they realized what was happening. They held open their cum-stained jock straps and watched in fear as their once enormous genitals shrunk to the size of a toddlers.<br />
<br />
I could tell Michael wanted to attack me, but there was fear in his eyes. He ran out of the locker room  and the rest of the jocks followed suit.<br />
<br />
With immense satisfaction and glory I exited the locker room and wondered how I could use my power for good.<br />
<br />
In Spanish class, I couldn’t take my eyes off of Señor Jackson’s massive bulge in his pants. I wanted to see it even bigger. I envisioned it happening in my head and then opened my eyes and watched.<br />
<br />
The fabric of Jackson’s pants were being pushed out, straining from the force of his newly massive cock. I was worried his pants would rip but they remained intact. Señor Jackson hadn’t seemed to notice, so I snapped my fingers.<br />
<br />
He began moaning in the middle of a sentence about preterite verb conjugations. The orgasm lasted almost thirty seconds, at least that’s how long Señor Jackson has his eyes closed and was moaning.<br />
<br />
I tried to act as bewildered as him and the rest of the class. That probably wasn’t the best time to give him the best orgasm of his life.<br />
<br />
I refrained from using my power until the end of the day, when I was called into the principal’s office. I’ve had a huge crush on the principal since I moved to Granger. His muscles bulged out of his suit and his beard was beautifully trimmed. The man was either always fully erect or his penis was so large it just looked that way. I wanted to see how big it could get.<br />
<br />
Principal Montez began lecturing me about something in the locker room. I don’t know what he believed actually happened but I wasn’t really listening anyway. I envisioned his penis getting so big it burst through his underwear and his pants. <br />
<br />
I nodded in agreement to what he was saying but wasn’t processing any of it. <br />
<br />
“Why are you smiling like that?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“No reason,” I responded, still simile and horny as hell.<br />
<br />
He started lecturing again but then it happened. He moaned in the middle of his sentence and grabbed his crotch.<br />
<br />
“Sorry about that,” he said, blushing. “I don’t know what just happened.”<br />
<br />
There was a ripping sound and I knew his underwear was no longer useable. Then came the pants. Montez tried to hide it but he couldn’t take the immense pleasure. I hit the button on the intercom and his moans filled the hallways and every classroom.<br />
<br />
“Bigger,” I thought. “Much bigger.” <br />
<br />
His penis now reached his nipples and his balls were the size of baseballs. He looked like he wanted to cum but I wouldn’t let him. <br />
<br />
“BIGGER”<br />
<br />
I locked the door so no one would interrupt us, his moans still echoing down the hallways. His penis reached his mouth and he couldn’t help but suck and lick it. His balls were nearly the size of volleyballs.<br />
<br />
I got out my phone to take pictures, knowing this was something I would definitely jerk off to many times in the future.<br />
<br />
His cock finally reached the ceiling and his balls were the size of rubber kick balls. He was licking and rubbing his hands all over his shaft, unable to help himself.<br />
<br />
Finally, I snapped my fingers. Gallons of warm cum exploded out of his enormous cock all over his office and himself. I didn’t think his moans could get any louder and I suddenly wished I was him. <br />
<br />
He finally came to his senses and looked up at his enormous member. Then he looked me straight in the eyes and said “help me.”<br />
<br />
“Help you what?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Help my jerk off again. I need four hands to cover this whole thing.”<br />
<br />
I happily agreed, stood up on his desk, and together we jerked off many more times. Our moans were heard by every teacher and every student. Every inch of the office was covered in sticky cum. <br />
<br />
After being locked out, the secretary eventually called 911 and our session had to stop. I was expelled from the school and Principal Montez was fried. I shrunk his penis and balls back down but they were still huge. He was barely able to fit them in his pants.<br />
<br />
Montez and I became best friends, and we wanted to have the same experience again. In fact, Montez and I had sex every week. We found a place in the woods, and every time we got bigger and bigger. Soon the trees were covered in our cum. <br />
<br />
I may never know where this power came from, but I hope it never goes away.</p>
