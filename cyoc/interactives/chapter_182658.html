<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“So I really can’t go home?” Aaron asked.<br />
<br />
“I’m afraid not. I wouldn’t want to accidentally turn you into a dildo or something before the servitude spell is up” Steve said.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, that’s fair Mr. Ryerson.” Aaron responded.<br />
<br />
“Oof. Aaron. You were just wrapped around my crotch for the better part of an afternoon. I think you can drop the ‘Mr.’” Steve said with a laugh. “That does bring up a point though. Do you might if I make a change?”<br />
<br />
“Uh, I guess so.” Aaron said, a bit nervously.<br />
<br />
“I would like you to age 17 years to 35” Steve requested.<br />
<br />
“Whoa” Aaron mumbled as a tingle ran through his body. He experienced the same growing sensation as he did when he originally put on the booby trapped jockstrap and turned into Coach Ryerson. Aaron gained about an inch in height, and the muscles in his legs, arms, and chest started growing before Steve’s eyes. Aaron’s biceps, triceps, and forearms gained a moderate amount of size, as did his calves and thighs, though not as much as when he became Coach Ryerson. His waist expanded out, a layer of fat covering the abdominals. His chest grew wider, and both his chest and belly grew a light coating of dark brown hair. He retained the hair on his head, though a few grays started showing in the light blonde. His jawline once again grew more pronounced, and small wrinkles grew in around his mouth and eyes. Overall, Aaron had aged well. Steve towered over him a bit height wise, but Aaron had bulked up. Overall, it seemed like he was the type of guy who took care of his body, but didn’t live at the gym, a real cub of a man. What surprised Steve most was how much Aaron’s butt had filled out. As Aaron surveyed his changes, Steve put a hand on a meaty cheek and squeezed.<br />
<br />
“Woof bud. Looks like someone has been doing their squats!” Steve said with a laugh.<br />
<br />
Aaron glanced over his shoulder at his bubble butt and laughed. “Yeah, looks like it huh?” Aaron replied. Steve’s hand remained where it was.<br />
<br />
“Well, there were go. Now you’re a little more age appropriate to spend the night with my husband and me” Steve said with a gleam in his eye.<br />
<br />
Aaron turned his gaze away from his changed body to make eye contact with Steve, then glanced down Steve’s naked body to a towering erection. “Oh. Um. Well... Mr. Ryerson... I...” Aaron stammered.<br />
<br />
Steve withdrew his hand. “Bud. Relax. You’re my age for the night. Call me Steve” he laughed.<br />
<br />
“Right. Well, Steve. See, the thing is. Well. I know I sucked your cock when your husband made me human again, and that was great. But, well, see. That’s the most John and I have done with each other. And, well, the most I’ve done with any guy.” Aaron said, averting his gaze downward.<br />
<br />
“No worries bud, we won’t do anything you’re not comfortable with. We could even just get some pizzas and some beers and have a movie night. You are welcome to share the bed with my husband and me, but you’re also welcome to the guest room if you’d like. I’m sorry for being presumptuous about the whole thing!” Steve said, clasping a hand on Aaron’s shoulder.<br />
<br />
Aaron visibly relaxed. “Thanks, Steve” he said.<br />
<br />
“No problem!” Steve exclaimed. “And, as a way to apologize for wearing you home, any changes from here on out are up to you. You can try whatever you like. Taller, shorter, fatter, leaner, bigger dick. It’s up to you. Or nothing more if you want, you’ll just be a 35 year old until tomorrow around 3:45pm, then the spell is up and you’re back to your 18 year old body.”<br />
<br />
Aaron smiled. “Thank you! But, you uh, don’t need to apologize for wearing me home” he said with a blush.<br />
<br />
“Oh?” Steve said, smirking.<br />
<br />
“Well, yeah” Aaron said. “John isn’t the only one with a crush on you” Aaron brought his gaze back up to meet Steve’s.<br />
<br />
“I’m flattered bud, and I have to say now that you’re age appropriate the feeling is mutual. Like I said, though, whatever you’re comfortable with.” Steve said, pulling Aaron into a hug. Aaron returned the hug, wrapping his arms around Steve’s waist, turning his head to rest of Steve’s shoulder, and his hard leaky cock slid against the inside of Steve’s thigh. Steve smiled. He broke his embrace with Aaron, gently turned Aaron’s head to face him, making eye contact. He leaned in for a quick kiss, then knelt before Aaron. “Now, after the wonderful blowjob you gave me, it would be rude of me to not return the favor. If you’re comfortable with it, that is” Steve said. Aaron slowly nodded an affirmative. “Great!” Steve said, a wrapped his lips around Aaron’s cock.<br />
--<br />
“Man, I wish John could see me like this” Aaron said, surveying his body in a bedroom’s full length mirror. Brody and Steve sat on the king size bed behind him, admiring Aaron’s meaty butt.<br />
<br />
“Who says he can’t?” Steve asked.<br />
<br />
Aaron turned. “Huh?”<br />
<br />
“He said it himself. He should have been the one wrapped around me, not you. What if Brody booby trapped another jock and we paid him a visit?” Steve said.<br />
<br />
“Sure! Let’s tell the whole school I’m a wizard that does transformation magic. I’m sure that will be a great idea. Why not the whole town?!” Brody said, exasperated. <br />
<br />
“Calm down babe” Steve said. “John watched his boyfriend turn into me, I think he already knows. Plus, this way we could convince him not to spread our little secret around.”<br />
<br />
“Well, that is a good point. But that’s it. No more” Brody said.<br />
<br />
Steve gave Brody a quick kiss on the lips. “Good.” He stood up and walked to the large wooden dresser. He pulled out another black jockstrap with red lining. “Here ya go. Same spells if you don’t mind” Steve said with a grin. He turned to Aaron. “Alright Aaron, while he’s doing that let’s find you something to wear. You’re just about Brody’s size, follow me and we’ll find you some shorts and a tank top.”<br />
<br />
Aaron’s expression went blank. “Yes, sir” he stated, moving to stand directly behind Steve.<br />
<br />
Steve laughed, “Whoops” and both he and Aaron walked into the walk in closet adjoining the bedroom.<br />
--<br />
Aaron blinked. The last thing he remembered, he was naked in a bedroom. Now, he was sitting in a large closet wearing a pair of sneakers, basketball shorts, and a slightly loose tank top. He looked up at a still naked Steve.<br />
<br />
“Wha... where are we? How did I get dressed?” Aaron asked.<br />
<br />
 “Sorry bud, forgot about the servitude spell I have on you and I guess telling you to follow me was a command you had to obey. Here” Steve said, offering his hand, “Let me help you up. Brody should be just about finished with the spell. I’ll get dressed and then we’ll head to John’s house.”<br />
<br />
Twenty minutes later, Aaron, Steve and Brody waited in Brody’s Subaru, waiting for John to fall for the trap. Of course, once John saw the black jockstrap with the red lining, Aaron was fairly confident that John would put it on, but he was prepared to convince him as well. Aaron sat in the backseat, Brody in the driver’s seat, and Steve sat naked in the passenger seat. He had stripped once they got to the park in John’s neighborhood. They had brought backpack and stored Steve’s shorts, flip flops, and a tank top in it. Aaron had snuck around John’s house to the backyard and dropped the pack so Steve would have something to wear on the walk from John’s house back to the Subaru. Around front, Aaron placed the black jockstrap on the doorstep, rang the bell, and ran like hell.<br />
--<br />
John was a wreck. It was his stupid prank that had gotten Aaron turned into Coach Ryerson’s jockstrap. Laying on his bed, dozens of questions flew through his mind. What would Aaron say when the spell was up and he was human again? Would he be mad? How would John make it up to him? Maybe Aaron was enjoying it? John knew he would be. Wrapped around a man like...<br />
<br />
*Ding*<br />
<br />
The doorbell broke John out of his inner dialogue. He was home alone for the weekend, so of course he was naked. John sighed, got up from his bed, found a pair of gym shorts and a t-shirt to put on, and headed downstairs to the front door. When he opened, no one was there. He looked around, but saw now one. He looked down, and saw the jockstrap.<br />
<br />
“No way...” John muttered to himself. He bent down grabbed the piece of cloth, shut the door and ran back to his room. He shut his door, held the jockstrap up by the waistband, looking directly at the pouch.<br />
<br />
“Aaron! Can you hear me? I’m so sorry babe! I’ll make it up to you, I swear! I’ll suck you off twice a day for a month! You know what, when you’re human again, I think I’m ready. If you’re ready, you can top me. I owe you. I can’t believe Coach gave you back to me! I promise I’ll keep you safe until tomorrow.” John set the jockstrap down on his bed. “God, I wish you could tell me when you’re feeling right now. I can’t wait to hear what it was like wrapped around Coach’s cock and balls.” John pulled his t-shirt off and dropped his gym shorts, freeing his erection. “Tonight will be great babe. We’ll soak in the hot tub, we’ll watch your favorite movie” John picked up the jockstrap from the bed, “and I’ll make sure to sleep on my back so you’re not smashed between me and the mattress” John bent over, lowering the jockstrap to the ground “You can come with me on my run tomorrow, and then by midafternoon you should be human again and we can talk about how I’ll make this up to you” John stepped into the jockstrap and pulled it up his legs. Once in place, John felt an odd tingle run through his body.<br />
--<br />
“Oop. There it is” Steve said, feeling a tingle run through his body. “He put it on.”<br />
<br />
“I knew he would. That ass probably thinks he’s wearing me right now” Aaron said from the backseat. Steve and Brody laughed.<br />
<br />
“Well. I’d say Mr. Cooper is in for a surprise then. I’ll see you gents in a bit” Steve said, and disappeared. <br />
<br />
Aaron and Brody sat in silence.<br />
<br />
So,” Adam said. “You’re a wizard.”<br />
<br />
“Yup” Brody said, still watching John’s house.<br />
<br />
“Do you turn a lot of guys into Mr. Ryerson’s underwear?” Aaron asked.<br />
<br />
Brody laughed, turning to face Aaron. “No, not many. I know a few other guys in town who practice magic, and sometimes Steve and I mess around with them, but usually it’s just the two of us.”<br />
<br />
“Have you ever been Mr. Ryerson’s underwear?” Aaron asked.<br />
<br />
“Ha. Yeah, he’s worn me to school a couple of times. And sometimes I wear him to the gym, but there are a lot of other things we like doing” Brody replied.<br />
<br />
“Oh? Like what?” Aaron asked.<br />
<br />
“Oh jeez, let’s see. Well, Steve and I both really like flying. Hey, if you and John are up for it, maybe tomorrow morning we could be a small murder of crows and explore the neighborhood.” Brody said. <br />
<br />
“You... you can turn into animals?” Aaron asked in shock.<br />
<br />
“Buddy. Earlier this afternoon you were my husband’s jockstrap, but being an animal is shocking?” Brody laughed. “Yeah, we can be animals. Steve and I really like being dogs too and sniffing around the neighborhood, though it’s usually only one of us on all fours because of the leash law. Oh hey! Would you mind taking Steve and I for a walk later? It’s been a while since we got to be dogs at the same time, it would be great to sniff his butt again!”<br />
<br />
“Uh, yeah, sure. We could do that” Aaron replied. “Is that it? Birds and dogs?”<br />
<br />
“Oh God no,” Brody replied. “Steve grew up riding horses, so sometimes I’ll be his horse and he’ll be my rider and we’ll go for trail rides. I enjoy being a squirrel and running from tree to tree. Steve is a swimmer and likes to join our fish in the aquarium for an afternoon swim. Sometimes I regress our ages back to 20 for a weekend, but only when Steve and I have nothing big we need to accomplish, since we’re so horny we mostly just have sex with each other and nap for two days. Steve likes being his own cock and balls and replacing mine so he can ride around in my briefs. I enjoy a good coach and player roleplay, especially when Steve is the 19 year old and I’m his burly coach.”<br />
Aaron was shocked, albeit aroused, by the implications of what Brody told him. He hadn’t considered all of the possibilities of what the evening had in store for him. Just then, the passenger door opened as Steve returned to the Subaru fully clothed.<br />
<br />
“Alright, now that John’s here should we head home and start the party?” Steve asked.<br />
<br />
“Yeah babe. Aaron said he and John could take us for a walk when we get home.” Brody said.<br />
<br />
“Excellent!” Steve exclaimed. “It’s been days since I’ve marked my territory around the neighborhood!”</p>
