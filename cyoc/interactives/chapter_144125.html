<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Vanessa&#39;s cheeks heated up and she squirmed in her seat as she was driving back to return Erika&#39;s phone.<br />
<br />
She had been at the family house only for a short while last weekend to check on her siblings. The rest of  the time she shared a student flat with her boyfriend near her college. Somehow though, her thoughts kept returning to Max, Erika&#39;s husky dog.<br />
<br />
She had seen him last when the girls had a sleepover over the weekend. He was a gorgerous dog, with his wolf-like dark grey fur, his cute fluffy tail, his ice-blue piercing eyes... and he had quite an athletic build to boost.<br />
<br />
If he were human, he would definitively be a handsome hunk, Vanessa thought, barely aware of the pleasant warmth in her lower belly.<br />
<br />
She was definitively distracted though. As she stopped her car, she realized she had driven back to Erika&#39;s house instead of the family house where she had dropped Melissa and her sister&#39;s friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, what has gotten into me?&quot; she groaned.<br />
<br />
Vanessa decided to step out of the car and she walked to the front door, hoping Erika had come home since her drive to and back from college. However, nobody answered when she rang at the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess she might have stayed at Melissa&#39;s for a little while&quot;... she sighed.<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t want to waste too much of her lunch time going back and forth between houses. Perhaps she could just... leave Erika&#39;s phone here? But she feared it might get stolen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I could... leave it inside?&quot; she wondered, looking for an open window.<br />
<br />
After a short inspection, all the the windows turned out to be closed. As she circled around the house looking for a back door, she found her way to the backyard. A cute porch led to the house&#39;s backdoor, and she caught sight of Max resting down the steps, on a leash.<br />
<br />
As he raised his head and recognized Vanessa, he started wagging his tail excitedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there buddy!&quot; Vanessa giggled. &quot;What a handsome dog you are, yes!&quot;<br />
<br />
She walked up to him and sat on the porch&#39;s steps to pet him. He attempted to lick her hands and face excitedly, happy to have some company break the monotony of his day.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy! What a good boy...&quot; Vanessa cooed to him as she combed his wonderful fur with her fingers.<br />
<br />
As he rolled on his back to expose his belly for rubs, Vanessa could not help but oogle his plump sheath and balls. The short fur of his groin looked extremely soft as well... She let a curious hand wander down his belly to explore the area, cautiously touching Max&#39; canine junk. Max wagged his tail happily, letting out a low groan of satisfaction.<br />
<br />
Vanessa suddenly became aware that her panties felt extremely wet! She slid a hand inside her jeans and underwear; her fingers met with an extremely slippery clitoris and slit.<br />
<br />
Under her other hand, something moist poked against her palm. Max&#39;s doggy penis was slightly poking out of its sheath! She immediately pulled back both her hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s happening to me..?&quot; Vanessa winced. She felt extremely horny for some reason, and her boyfriend was not here to help. Her libido had always been pretty active, and she got on birth control early in her life to avoid troubles; but right now her pussy was on fire like never before.<br />
<br />
Hypnotized, she couldn&#39;t remove her eyes from the growing canine member.<br />
<br />
Max rolled and stood up, lowering his head to gently lick Vanessa&#39;s fluids off her fingers. The feeling of his tongue on her hand sent shivers up her spine. She felt hot and sweaty out of nowhere, and removed her leather jacket. Her nipples were poking obscenely though her shirt, as she had removed her bras to get comfortable over her lunch break.<br />
<br />
Not thinking much of it, she removed her shirt as well, exposing her chest in the open air. She had a taller figure than Melissa&#39;s and shared her curvy hips and large breasts, but without the slight chub.<br />
<br />
As she was sitting on the steps, Max shoved his muzzle under her chin, pushing forward as he demanded more pets, and Vanessa gasped audibly as she felt his moist member brush against the inside of her leg.<br />
<br />
&quot;M...Max! Wait a sec...&quot; she hesitated, but was cut short by a canine tongue licking her own and the inside of her mouth. She unvoluntarily arched her back and let out a moan, surprising herself but unable to contain her arousal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aah... I...&quot; she protested weakly as she laid on her back under Max&#39; weight. Somehow she found her hand wrapped around his member. It felt warm and slick, throbbing in her grip. Her pussy was buzzing in need, and she pushed her pants down, keeping only her panties. <br />
<br />
Max had his front paws on the porch where Vanessa laid on her back, while his hing legs were on the lower steps. Crouching over Vanessa, his erection met with Vanessa&#39;s groin and he started humping. Vanessa let out a lewd whimper as the dog rubbed against her panties and engorged clit underneath.<br />
<br />
The husky was licking Vanessa&#39;s neck and drooling over her breasts, which she grabbed, pinching her lubricated nipples to add to the excitation. She didn&#39;t know what she was doing but she had never felt this horny in her entire life; she couldn&#39;t help herself.<br />
<br />
As Max was chaotically frotting against Vanessa&#39;s covered sex, the tip of his canine cock got caught in her panties, slipping through one of the leg hole and forcing its way into her vagina.<br />
<br />
&quot;GNNH! MAax...&quot; Vanessa cried out in pleasure as her hips bucked out of her control, pulling more of the swelling member inside. Max thrusted deeper in reponse, filling her completely. She could not believe how good it felt, and her moans became louder as the dog&#39;s knot slowly expanded, rubbing against her G spot.<br />
<br />
As she tried to prop herself on her elbows, she realized Max could not pull out, his knot stuck into her. She let herself fall on her back again, helpless, as he pounded his throbbing cock deeper into her. If any neighbour would get sight of this, she thought...<br />
<br />
The idea was terrifying and turning her on at the same time. She felt an orgasm build in her... Biting her lower lips as she hugged Max&#39;s body tightly, she stopped struggling with her urges and let it come. Her climax hit so strongly she saw black spots in front of her eyes, and let out a suggestive cry of ecstasy.<br />
<br />
Max was not finished with her though. He kept slamming his cock faster in her pussy, rubbing his knot back and forth over her G spot. Vanessa, still riding the wave of her first orgasm, soon got hit by a second, a third, and a fourth orgasm, her moans getting more high-pitched each time.<br />
<br />
Finally, Max&#39;s cock began spasming more intensely, and Vanessa&#39;s pussy overflew with canine semen as the husky&#39;s knot buzzed blissfully against her tightening walls. A fifth climax hit her, making her howl lewdly, swept away in sexual rapture.<br />
<br />
It took her several minutes to come back to her senses. Max&#39;s knot softened and the dog pulled out of her vagina, letting a trail of fluids gush from Vanessa&#39;s swollen lips. As she was catching her breath, she felt the colder air over her wet breasts and thighs.<br />
<br />
Fuck, what had gotten into her? Did anybody hear her? Erika and her parents might come home any minute.<br />
<br />
Vanessa staggered to her feet, canine semen now soaking her panties, but she didn&#39;t want to risk being caught. Max looked up to her, wagging his tail, the pointy head of his red penis still poking out of his sheath.<br />
 <br />
Vanessa shivered, ashamed, and put her clothes back in a hurry. As she exited the house&#39;s property, she shoved Erika&#39;s phone in the mailbox. Jumping into her car, she drove back to college, still light-headed from the multiple orgasms she had. She still had just enough time to get to her next class before being late.<br />
<br />
The sensation of Max&#39;s cock pounding her had not left, hovering like a phantom limb. In the back of her mind, she wondered if her boyfriend&#39;s cock would ever make her come that hard...</p>
