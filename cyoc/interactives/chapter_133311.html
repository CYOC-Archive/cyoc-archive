<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ever since Zossie has discovered the magical abilities of being DJ Morpher she’d been living with Haley and using her sister as a test subject for all her discs. Sometimes the discs would go awry and things would get weird, like for example the time when Zossie has been testing her gender bender disc. It had failed to erase the female attributes from Haley’s existence so she had walked around as a hermaphrodite for a day. Another time Zossie had tried out a disc that made a person sluttier. Instead of the intended outcome of a personality matching Jez’s she instead got someone who was so dumb she was infantile. Safe to say she scaled up the intelligence in it. There had also been that time she had tried out an age regression disc that had sent them back in time and she had to wait sixty years for the technology to be invented again. She’d made quite the housewife but William had passed away so she’d regressed back to herself again taking Haley with her too. Haley deserved to be some sort of CEO over a housewife anyway. Sure knowing her kids thought she was dead bothered her but at the same time they’d survived and inherited a fortune from their father in the meantime.<br />
<br />
Today however Zossie was more interested in creating a disc that would regress a person in age but also let them retain some of their personality. She wanted McKenzie to remain who she was but also have a chance to escape the party lifestyle. To effectively grow up. She had a prototype song at her computer and just waited for Haley to appear. She wanted to regress Haley into a baby and see if she retained any of her characteric shyness and quietness. Zossie thankfully didn’t have to wait long as Haley emerged from her room with an empty glass of water. Zossie immediately hit play and music began to surge through the apartment. Haley’s eyes dropped before she began to shrink and crawl backwards in terms of age. Her clothes changed with her going through current teenage fashion trends as her breasts deflated and her periods ceased. The glass in her hands became plastic as she became a child, then a toddler, then fell over with the glass becoming a bottle. She began to suck on it as her clothes morphed into a cute yellow shirt and baby jeans while her feet became bare. Her hair began to retreat into her scalp while the bottle escaped her lips and she let it fall onto the floor. Zossie pauses the music and stood up scooping up her now baby sister and cooing her. Haley shyly avoided eye contact and Zossie smiled at this.<br />
<br />
“Success,” she laughed before sitting down before her computer and using the mouse to begin searching for another file to age Haley up again. Haley however slapped the space bar and the age regression song began again. The clothes melted off Haley as she became newborn. Then a chord shot out of Zossie’s vagina and attached itself to Haley. She was so shocked she didn’t react until Haley had been painfully pulled inside her leaving her womb distended like it had when she had been pregnant with Willian Jr. and Bianca. It shrunk further and further until just a baby bump was visible. So said finally snapped out of her daze and quickly found the progression song. She began to play it but instead of her baby bump growing she instead got her own body getting older. She paused the music at twenty five years old and used the regression song on herself. She delayed back to twenty years old but the baby bump remained the same. Scratching her chin she went back to the targeting and set Haley for a target. Haley began to regress more with the baby bump vanishing and shrinking further. Sissies set an end point and waited in angicipation as suddenly her clothes were off and she felt an orgasm in reverse. She was lying in bed with a bouncer from the club looming over her with his rock hard abs and body. He plunged his dick into her body and she moaned in pleasure as she felt that reverse orgasm play forward exactly how it had while Haley was regressing. The bouncer jumped her and fondled her breasts and Zossie found herself in complete bliss as he roughly handled her body. Before long they both orgasmed and he shot his load into her womb impregnating her with her sister who was now technically her daughter. It stood to reason that gender equality would just grow over time so Haley had a better shot at becoming a CEO or something in the future anyway. Plus Zossie did enjoy the feeling of being pregnant, especially because anesthetic existed now so birth wouldn’t be as excruciating. Plus her child would be Haley, a kid who had been so angelic her biggest problems had been being picky about mushrooms.<br />
<br />
At the very least Zossie has to wait until she was born to age her up again and she wasn’t sure if she wanted to do that. She’d Spent eighty years around the same age as Haley and raising her from scratch seemed fun, the only issue was her est subject was gone. But then again one of the bouncers was kissing her in the afterglow of an orgasm right now so she could always use him. She just kissed back sure she’d make a decision about Haley after she was born, at least now she knew not to drink and that the disc she’d just created worked so long as you didn’t regress someone too far.</p>
