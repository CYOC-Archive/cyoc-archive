<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It&#39;s been a few days since Jack created his age progression virus and people still didn&#39;t get what&#39;s happening. There are multiple theories: kidnappings, witchcraft and even alien invasion stories. A lot of people is scared, especially parents who try to protect their children, but there are also people who don&#39;t believe that something is happening.<br />
<br />
The Robertson family is part of them. They are a traditional young family, a father, a mother and their only child, a 5 years old boy. They live in a town close to where the infection started and despite the virus has already affected several kids in that town. They didn&#39;t think it&#39;s true.<br />
<br />
One day, they decided to go to the beach. They prepared some food, towels, lotion, etc. and drive to the beach. On the way, they heard the government&#39;s recommendations to stay at home but they ignore it and kept on their way.<br />
<br />
When they arrived, they immediately noticed that the beach was almost empty. There&#39;s only one man taking a sunbath. They laughed a little thinking that people was scared of nothing and they&#39;ll enjoy a peaceful day instead.<br />
<br />
While the parents take their stuff out of the car, their son started to wander around. He was already wearing a swimsuit so he can go to the water if he wanted, but he was curious about the man sunbathing instead. He came closer and noticed that he was sleeping.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr?&quot; He said as he made sure that the man was truly sleeping. &quot;Mr?&quot; He repeated and this time he slapped one of the man&#39;s wide thighs. He kept looking at the man for a few more minutes, admiring his big muscles, his big feet and giggling a little as he looked at the man&#39;s big pee-pee that was making a big bulge in his shiny speedo.<br />
<br />
Then, he got bored and decided to build a sand castle. He asked his mother for his toys tools and then he started to play. Meanwhile, his father was looking for an open grocery store and his mother was texting her friends about how wonderful is to have a beach just for them.<br />
<br />
She was so focused on her phone, arguing with her friends who told her she was crazy for going out that she didn&#39;t noticed that her little boy was changing in front of her. When she got tired of her discussion and looked at her son it was too late.<br />
<br />
Instead of her precious little boy she found a young man sitting in her kid&#39;s place. She can&#39;t believe it, that guy looked like a younger version of her husband, except for the muscles and the bulge that looked obscene in the tiny swimsuit he was wearing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Richard! Richard!!!&quot; She yelled in panic. &quot;Come!! Look!!!&quot; Her husband arrived as soon as he could and immediately noticed the young man playing with his son&#39;s toy tools. &quot;I saw it! I saw it with my own eyes!!! That’s our son!! That is definitely him!!!&quot; She yelled as she cried and pointed at the nude 18 year old guy playing in the sand. His tiny swimsuit has finally given up and he was now naked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you crazy?!!&quot; Richard said. &quot;He&#39;s not our son! Are you trying to make fun of me?!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No Richard! I’m not crazy!&quot; She kept crying. &quot;You heard the news about staying at home. I now understand why!!&quot; She was so startled by the sight of her once 5 year old boy. &quot;We should have obeyed it! But now it&#39;s too late!! It&#39;s too late!!&quot; She said nervously.<br />
<br />
Then she noticed that her son has started to play with his newly grown dick an balls. &quot;Richard!! You have to stop him!&quot; She couldn’t even watch.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-sport?&quot; Richard said as he approached to the naked man who his wife says is their son. Now that he is closer to him, he can see some resemblance to himself. &quot;Sport, don&#39;t do that. Please.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But daddy it feels good!!&quot; The overgrown boy said with a big smile on his face. &quot;It makes me feel all tingly inside!&quot; He said as he stroked his cock playfully until it got hard. &quot;Daddy, my pee-pee got bigger!! It&#39;s big like yours! It&#39;s big like the mister sleeping there...&quot; He pointed at the man sunbathing but he was gone. &quot;Uh? Where is he?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Richard! Get a towel or something, we are taking our little…I mean, our big boy home now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard nodded and helped his son to stand up. Surprisingly, the former kid was now taller than his dad. He smiled and followed his daddy as his raging erection bounced side to side with each step as it drooled precum to the sand.</p>
