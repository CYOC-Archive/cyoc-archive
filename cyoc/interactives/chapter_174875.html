<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Daddy, I&#39;m gonna splash you, cannon ball!&quot; Rebecca shouted as she was ready to jump into the pool, floaties and hair tied up.<br />
Her father David eagerly stood laughing as he readied for her jump.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright sweetheart jus- Ah, fuck bro, watch the hair!&quot; Derek scoffed, just as Roman dived into the pool and cascaded water all around. <br />
<br />
He was a handsome, strapping man at age 28, but with an adonis like physique and a skimpy red speedo, it was hard not to have some envy over the sunlight dancing around his black hair and beard. Rising from the water and slicking his hair back, Roman chuckled as water dripped from his red-brown tinged hair. He wasn&#39;t that far from Derek, age 27, but where Derek had mass, Roman was chiseled and toned. He flexed his biceps as the sun set upon his tanned skin and kissed the bulging muscles playfully. <br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t help it, man. Look at me, you really think this kinda beauty has to be ignored?&quot; He snickered. <br />
<br />
Roman had an exceptionally nasty habit of trying to put himself on top, but with his idyllic cheekbones and jaw dropping abdominals, one could easily forgive him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah, just be careful not to cause too much trouble, &#39;Liv was nice enough to let us use the pool for the model shoot. I don&#39;t wanna piss her off.&quot; Derek groaned, flitting water from his broad chest and swimming back to the edge of the pool to recline.<br />
<br />
He sighed, head tilting up as he closed his eyes and took in the luxury. He was lucky he had a wife like Olivia, of course, for an older woman the cougar had made it known that Derek&#39;s body was exactly what she craved. He didn&#39;t mind, hell, they weren&#39;t even &quot;married&quot;, but considering it was Olivia who wanted them to think about having a small wedding some day &quot;when they were both ready&quot;, he had to admit the idea was palpable. Her big, ample chest and those wide curves... The way she couldn&#39;t restrain herself around him and wanted him every-<br />
<br />
&quot;If you two are done arguing, I could use some sunscreen.&quot; Called out a voice from across the pool. Tilting his sunshades down, Enrique frowned as he saw the two bicker and placed his book away, laying down on the lounge chair. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t get your posers in a twist, bro, we&#39;re coming.&quot; Roman beckoned, jabbing Derek lightly in the chest as he swam over to ease off the tension.<br />
<br />
Enrique huffed, before turning around and lying flat across the lounge chair, green thong nearly eaten by the large rear end. Whereas Derek had the largest size, and Roman was toned, Enrique was the middle of the three, strong yet toned. All three had competed in various physique contests, and by sheer luck, the three struck it out over a mutual love over their bodies and their desire to compete. A shame Derek was with a MILF though, Enrique rolled his eyes.<br />
<br />
His loss, but it wasn&#39;t like he didn&#39;t remember Derek smacking his globes in the locker room the other day, or gritting his teeth when Roman posed in front of them for critiques. Some men were too dense... Although, that was exactly his appeal.<br />
<br />
Derek and Roman relented, pulling themselves out of the pool and waltzing over to their third friend with a walk so slow it could give Baywatch a run for their money. <br />
<br />
&quot;You trying to make me burn out here, or you gonna help a brother out?&quot; Enrique snarled, looking up from his perch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, you keep it up and maybe we&#39;ll just coat you in something <I>else</I>.&quot; Roman guffawed, grabbing the bottle of sunscreen that once used to be a floatie for a child. Squeezing an ample amount, he passed some over to Derek, both of them rubbing the liquid into their palms and began to work Enrique over.<br />
<br />
At first, it was fine, but as Derek and Roman rubbed and tugged his aching lats, Enrique groaned sensually.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck... Right there, yeah, keep it up...&quot; He continued, much to Roman&#39;s glee.<br />
<br />
&quot;You really get off to this, huh?&quot; Roman incited, Derek rolled his eyes, just as Enrique&#39;s sunshades nearly slipped off the bridge of his nose.<br />
<br />
&quot;More rub, less talking, Mr. &quot;I&#39;m too beautiful&quot;.&quot; Enrique mocked.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I am, but I think the real question is... Did you and the MILF hit it off, big boy?&quot; Roman wiggled his eyebrows as he turned to Derek. Derek growled, a distinct twitch in his trapezius muscles gave warning as Roman lost some mirth.<br />
<br />
Enrique sighed, putting his head down as he felt Roman slap his bubble butt with impunity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave him al-ow! ...She&#39;s into it, he&#39;s into it. He&#39;s our friend. Not our business, Ro&#39;.&quot; He spoke up. Derek mentally gained a breath of relief, at least in the scheme of things, Enrique would have his back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... But come on, we know she&#39;s always horny over you, I mean LOOK at her. LOOK at you! You two ought to be fucking like rabbits every night for all we-&quot; Before he could continue, Derek shot him a stare and Roman rolled his eyes still laughing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, fine, I give, I give, but heads up Der&#39;, MILF above.&quot; He noted casually. Derek and Enrique looked up almost immediately, spying Olivia holding the antique camera his family owned from their uncle Paul for quite some time. She smiled, shooting a seductive face to Derek before taking her leave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bet you 5$ she wants to jack off to some polaroid shots of us?&quot; Roman again pushed the envelope, cackling hysterically before bouncing his chest as Enrique groaned. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bro, at least act like your IQ is as big as your dick. You&#39;re hot as shit, but you&#39;re stupid as hell.&quot; Enrique groaned. Roman squeezed the bottle again to continue lathering on Enrique when the bottle wheezed air.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatev&#39;s, we&#39;re out of sunscreen anyhow. Any ideas, Einstein?&quot; Roman asked.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, as she eagerly recalled her man&#39;s visage, Olivia walked out of the guest room and placed the camera on the table near the stairs. Sure, she allowed her husband to invite his equally handsome friends for a little &quot;pool party&quot;... But Olivia knew that they couldn&#39;t take their eyes off her for one second. It was absolutely delicious having three men ogle her with her breasts ever being in the spotlight. She sighed, ideas drifting into her head as she went into her bedroom to find an outfit to wear. Derek was such a good boy, she was going to reward him... Although if any of his friends wanted to get involved, well, who was she to deny the fun? The more the merrier!<br />
