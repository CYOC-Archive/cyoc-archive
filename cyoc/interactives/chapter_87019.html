<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You know Runt, I have decided on something. I want to be a specific monster... one I&#39;ve been captivated by since I was eight. Thing is... I wonder if you could put a twist on it.&quot; I said with a grin on my face.<br />
<br />
Runt looked at me, his head cocked and very visibly interested by my words.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think the limits of my powers is? I told you Incan change anything by touching you. Speak your request and I will make it so!&quot; Runt said, sounding slightly annoyed by my questioning his power.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok... well... here it goes. I want to be an anthropomorphic werewolf, one with human traits like standing upright, keeping my thoughts intact and not become a bloodthirsty monster. In essence, I want to be me, but that&#39;s the tricky part. I don&#39;t want to be changed again... I want to be able to shift between forms, but I want to remain a werewolf. At the same time... I want you to change my soul. I... I want a demon&#39;s soul and my werewolf form would look demonic. In fact, I always want to be demonic, just not looking the part in human form. Can... can you do that?&quot; I asked a bit nervous by the request, but it was what I wanted.<br />
<br />
Runt looked at me, his eyes wide and grinned. &quot;Hmmm, a permanent demonic werewolf eh? That is certainly a request and one I can do... but changing your soul would make what I turn you into, as a werewolf, will be permanent. I would no longer be able to change you into anything else. What is in it for me?&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked at him and smiled, knowing that it could be done now, there was no reservation because I have always been on the dark side in games and fiction I&#39;ve written because there aren&#39;t ever any real life consequences for it. Now... if he did this, I&#39;d be free of consequences in the real world. &quot;What do you think is in it for you? You can have my human soul, but you can also have the soul of those I turn as well, creating a pack of demonic werewolves if you will...&quot; I said with a devilish sneer.<br />
<br />
Runt looked at me, his eyes looking me over as he paced back and forth a few times. I know that he had some reservations about it because he&#39;d be losing such a willing subject, but the offer of not one... but several human souls... dozens upon dozens... possibly to number the amount of humans on the planet. He grinned wickedly, knowing that claiming souls like that would make him a champion and celebrity in hell... if he ever returned. Then suddenly, he clapped his hands together and gave them a vigorous rub. &quot;Alright... I will do it, but there are a few things to tell you about this request. First, you&#39;ll be able to traverse between here and hell at your whim. You will have a reward in hell for this as well... a realm of your own where we will send you humans that are already damned for you to change and unleash upon the mortal world. Second, you and your pack will subjugate all humanity and always leaving 1 Billion of them to procreate and once the off spring are of the age of losing innocence, age twelve to be exact, you can make more... hell willing, you can even turn children if you like. You are limited to five hundred million males and five hundred million females. All werewolves will be aware of the number of humans left of each gender to prevent our prey from going extinct. Third, you can change children now as well, but they must be over twelve and they must choose of their free will to become what you are. Past eighteen, they are fair game. Fourth... you will only be able to turn others by them ingesting your semen or the semen of other demon werewolves. You can fuck them or have them fuck you, whatever tickles your fancy, but they must drink from you a full load of cum to change them... this too will harvest their soul for you to replace with a demonic one. Once their transformation into a demonic werewolf begins, you are free to do as you please. Finally, as I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t care because you are gay, no women can be like you and if a woman does drink from another wolf&#39;s seed, they will become male demonic werewolves. Is all of this understood?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hearing every word and stipulation, I grinned and then nodded. I couldn&#39;t believe he could do all of that... not to mention the depths of pleasure and depravity I was sure to experience. Going to hell to corrupt, turn and bring them back to the mortal world to do as we pleased... I got hard just thinking about it. Runt grinned as he watched my pants tent and grinned knowing just what he was going to improve most of all for my new and permanent form.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... judging by that wood, I&#39;m guessing you understand and agree to those terms. I just have to hear you say it... a formality when selling your soul and trading it for a demon one I&#39;m afraid.&quot; He said with a snicker.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! Fuck yes!&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
He grinned and approached me. &quot;Before I do this, do you want your clothes on or off? Do you also have any requests?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure... I got a couple and we&#39;ll do it clothes on. First request, make that beefy cop see me as his long time partner on the force and as the second, have him come in here to watch. I want him to be my first on this plane of existence.&quot; I said immediately knowing what I wanted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, first for your clothes...&quot; He said as he touched them.<br />
<br />
I grinned watching them change from normal clothes to that of an officer, fitting comfortably on my beefy body. Then suddenly Runt disappeared for a second and popped back in. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, he&#39;ll be in after I give you what you agreed to. Once that&#39;s done, he&#39;ll walk through your unlocked front door, locking it behind him and to make sure you&#39;ll always be secure to do as you please... all doors and windows will seal until you unlock the front door. It was nice while it lasted, but you are making things so much better for me in hell... I just couldn&#39;t deny you! Enjoy your new life and I&#39;ll be seeing you around my brother!&quot; He said and instantly touched my slightly hairy, but beefy chest.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, with that single touch, I could feel my chest clench with pain, nearly dropping to my knees. The pain was intense as my soul, buried deep within my being, was seized by his clawed fingers. Closing his hand into a clenched fist, I felt my soul being ripped from its&#39; housing that had been there for so long. Runt grinned and put that hand to his chest as I watched the bright light being absorbed. My heart raced, beating so hard and fast I thought it would explode. Then, he grinned as he pinched himself, pulling out a brilliant crimson light with black, sulphuric smoke wafting and swirling around it and shoved it into my being. He grinned again, as if to say &quot;have fun&quot;, then vanished while I felt the black, smoky tendrils latch onto my being. It pulled itself into the spot my old soul once used just moments ago. Immediately I began to feel it change me and in that instant I not only felt more alive than ever, but my mind was being filled with dark thoughts of depravity. I could see the cop with my mind, just outside the door, but Incould also see his family. He had two sons, both eighteen and nine months apart. I grinned thinking about them being next after their father. I groaned as my cock surged, my mind now envisioning the boys turned by me or even their own dad... how delightfully evil that would be. Then, just as I saw it, the athletic cop came in with a smile on his face greeting me like he knew me for years. The guy was going on thirty-seven, so he had plenty of time to make friends with numerous people over the years.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Zach...&quot; He said cheerfully, but immediately noticed I was on my knees in a bit of pain, &quot;... buddy... are you ok? Do you need me to take you to the hospital or anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... no I&#39;m fine Kyle, but thanks for the offer.&quot; I said with a pleasures grunt.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... what&#39;s been going on? I&#39;ve missed ya these. Past few days with you being on vacation.&quot; He said with a smile and a meaty hand placed on my broad muscled back, rubbing in a very sensual way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah? Is that so...&quot; I asked as I sniffed, suddenly aware of the non physical changes; sight, hearing and smell all were heightened to allow me to percieve what I previously could not... most importantly smelling his arousal.<br />
<br />
Immediately I knew that when Runt worked his magic to bring him there, he also made him gay and that we weren&#39;t just partners on the force... we were fuck buddies. &quot;Yeah... I&#39;ve missed you, that hot ass and that monster cock of yours. You know how I love&#39;em thick... I thought I was big till I met you!&quot; Kyle said, grasping my tent and giving it a firm grope.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah? Well to be honest, I was happy you were able to come here after your shift so I could suck on that soda can cock you have!&quot; I said in reply, feeling the demon spreading throughout my being, changing me from the inside to prepare me for the full transformation &quot;Plus... you know how I love having sex with you while in that uniform, allowing me to unwrap my gift that keeps on giving!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah... I have a big gift for you alright. I got a thick batch of sperm for you to guzzle like I know you love doing! Ever since you and Instarted fucking, seeing how you loved my thick and copious volume of cum, drinking most of down and then passing my last volley, which is always a good amount, into my mouth as we kissed... I can&#39;t get enough sperm myself. I&#39;m a sperm sucker and proud. I fucking hate calling it cum because sperm just sounds dirtier. You gave me something my wife never could and she never would swallow, always complaining about the volume and thickness. No... you my sperm catcher, you opened my eyes to a whole other realm of sex and I love you for it!&quot; Kyle said as I could smell his thick, syrupy pre, that was coating not just his underwear and pants, but the entirety of his hard and veiny cock.<br />
<br />
Suddenly I grunted in pleasure again, feeling the searing heat from my core burning away at my insides, burning away the human and replacing it with the infernal demonic werewolf instructions. I could feel my change coming... it was right on the edge and I welcomed it! &quot;Well Kyle, my feeder, why don&#39;t I drain your balls first... then you can have my thick sperm for your enjoyment eh?&quot; I said seductively as I reached out and have him a firm, teasing grope while curling my fingers into the waistband, ready to pull them down and get at the meat my mouth was watering over as images of us doing lots of sexual things in the past came to my mind.</p>
