<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate Anderson stood with his boyfriend Alex Ramsey at the top of the climb, looking out over Moon Lake and its namesake town.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s beautiful,&quot; said Nate, taking in all the natural beauty around him. &quot;How does it look when there&#39;s an actual full moon?&quot;<br />
&quot;That I unfortunately won&#39;t be able to show you for a couple days. The next one&#39;s this coming Tuesday night, so we won&#39;t be able to camp out over night because of school,&quot; replied Alex with a touch of sadness. &quot;But just as the full moon has cleared the horizon line, the lake reflects its shine like a mirror and light up the whole night sky. You can barely make out any of the surrounding stars until the moon is higher in the sky.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like you to show me,&quot; requested Nate. &quot;Weather and calendar permitting of course.&quot;<br />
&quot;The next full moon not on a school night is Christmas this year. That&#39;s out,&quot; said Alex, checking an app on his cellphone.<br />
&quot;Oh? Why?&quot; wondered Nate.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got other plans concerning me being with the man I love that night,&quot; replied Alex, before kissing his boyfriend again. &quot;Our next shots after that are January, April, May, and September of 2016.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then we definitely have a date for one of those,&quot; promised Nate, while putting his arms around Alex, before pulling him in for another smooch. &quot;Do you think we could...?&quot;<br />
&quot;Here? Now?&quot; wondered Alex, while licking his lips in anticipation.<br />
&quot;I can tell you&#39;re interested,&quot; said Nate, feeling the bulge growing in his lover&#39;s pants.<br />
&quot;Never said I wasn&#39;t,&quot; replied Alex. &quot;But if we&#39;re caught by a park ranger, we&#39;d get fined for public indecency. Worse if we can&#39;t control ourselves and go furry during the day in public.&quot;<br />
&quot;Damn. That&#39;s right,&quot; realized Nate, breaking the embrace between them. &quot;Maybe we can come back up here tonight and...&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve got it stud,&quot; promised Alex, before kissing him again.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m looking forward to it handsome. But what do we do in the meantime?&quot; wondered Nate, settling for just having his arm around Alex as he stared back out over the lake again.<br />
<br />
ELSEWHERE...<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know how to play chess,&quot; confessed Julie Stovall. &quot;Despite its fantasy elements, I&#39;ve never had any interests in the game.&quot;<br />
Her new boyfriend and future husband Eric Anderson looked at her in shock. &quot;I left my computer tablet at home, but I&#39;d be happy to teach you sometime. Growing up, me versus the computer on a lot of stuff was about the only way I had to pass the time back in Minnesota.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry to hear that,&quot; said Julie, brushing a lock of hair off Eric&#39;s forehead before kissing him. &quot;But you don&#39;t have to worry about that now.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; he said with a smile, before kissing her again.<br />
Soon hands began roaming across bodies, as Julie and Eric got lost in the moment. But when Eric started to reach underneath her shirt to caress her breasts, that&#39;s when Julie stopped the proceedings.<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve got plenty of time for that tonight,&quot; she promised, before kissing each of Eric&#39;s hands. &quot;Mom&#39;s already given us permission to use both the pool and the cabana.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; replied Eric, thinking about future events. &quot;What do we do in the meantime?&quot; he wondered.<br />
&quot;Something to take our minds off tonight,&quot; answered Julie, even as she thought about the bulge in Eric&#39;s pants pressing against her leg, and into other parts of her body. &quot;There&#39;s always this,&quot; she added, holding up a video game cartridge.<br />
&quot;Tennis?&quot; asked Eric, staring at the game.<br />
&quot;Yes. This version lets you choose your own player icons, and there&#39;s also two player options. We can play a mixed doubles game against a couple of computer opponents.&quot;<br />
&quot;But I&#39;ve never played tennis, real or virtually,&quot; said Eric.<br />
&quot;Then it&#39;s time you learned honey,&quot; said Julie, as she put the cartridge in the game console. &quot;When my folks built this place, they were hoping for both a tennis court and a swimming pool, but there wasn&#39;t enough land so as were-mers, of course they chose the pool. But even though the Moon Lake school district only has courses and teams every Spring and Summer, I&#39;ve played since Junior High, and I&#39;ll warn you, I&#39;m good.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay. I&#39;ll learn how to play tennis if you learn how to play chess,&quot; promised her boyfriend.<br />
&quot;Deal Mister Anderson,&quot; said Julie with a smile.<br />
&quot;Agreed my future Mrs. Anderson,&quot; said Eric with just as big a smile, before they sealed the agreement with another kiss.<br />
As they briefly embraced again, Julie felt Eric&#39;s body press the single pearl necklace around her neck in-between them. She smiled at the thought of having her lover, boyfriend, soulmate, future fiance and husband in her arms; before they sat back down on the couch and Julie began to teach Eric the basics of tennis.<br />
<br />
Unknown to the two young lovers, Julie&#39;s mother Melissa Stovall had seen everything from the open doorway to the kitchen.<br />
With a smile on her face and trying to hold back tears of joy, she walked back into the kitchen and her laptop to continue working on future projects for her computer company Stovall Systems, even as she thought about finding a chess tutorial for Julie and a beginner&#39;s tennis game for Eric.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
&quot;Oh yes! Harder! Faster! Deeper!&quot; the werevixen demanded of her husband, even as Dawn Hale continued to kiss and caress Martha Anderson&#39;s breasts.<br />
Douglas Hale responded by tightening his grip on his wife&#39;s hips as he started thrusting even more than he was into her moist pussy with his hard vulpine penis. The couple&#39;s tails were thrashing about in pure pleasure, almost in unison.<br />
&quot;I agree with the lady William,&quot; purred Martha the werecat, even as she moved a paw down to caress Dawn&#39;s clit. &quot;GO FOR IT STUD!&quot;<br />
The werefox behind her just let out a yip of pleasure even as William Anderson complied with his wife&#39;s request.<br />
The ladies were on their knees, facing each other while exploring their female lover&#39;s body as each man was behind his respective wife, fucking her cunt from behind.<br />
&quot;MMMMM....&quot; moaned Dawn, moving up to nuzzle Martha&#39;s neck and return the favor by massaging her clit. &quot;Don&#39;t you just LOVE IT when their hard top knot sinks into you?&quot;<br />
&quot;YES!&quot; agreed Martha, wiggling her ass against her husband. &quot;It&#39;s even better when they&#39;re in so deep, it takes a while for them to slip back out after they&#39;ve cummed. That feeling of it slowly sliding back out of you again...&quot; she moaned.<br />
&quot;Definitely!&quot; agreed Dawn, before kissing Martha again. <i>I&#39;d love to experience William while Douglas fucks you, but the arrangement has to be mutually agreed to, and I won&#39;t break my promises to you Martha.</i><br />
With everyone in their fursonas and heightened were-libidos at their peak, it wasn&#39;t long before the Andersons and Hales all experienced fantastic orgasms.<br />
Spent for the moment, the foursome laid down on the king sized bed, each couple taking a side as the ladies continued to face each other.<br />
Martha and Dawn resumed kissing and playing with each other&#39;s breasts, as their husbands caressed and played with their respective mates.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know about you, but I&#39;m multi-orgasmic and ready to go again. What say the moment they slip out of us, we change positions and 69?&quot; suggested Dawn, eager to taste William&#39;s fox juice mixed with his wife&#39;s honey.<br />
&quot;Interesting idea,&quot; agreed Martha, in-between suckles on Dawn&#39;s tits. &quot;But if you keep talking like that, they may never leave our cunts.&quot;<br />
&quot;Now that&#39;s something I&#39;d look forward to,&quot; admitted Dawn, wiggling her ass against Douglas. <i>I wonder how William&#39;s staying power is?</i><br />
Husbands caressed their wives as Dawn and Martha just continued to lay there and enjoy each other&#39;s company. But soon Martha began to realize there was an extra set of paws on her.<br />
She looked down and saw Douglas reaching past Dawn to caress what he could of his wife&#39;s playmate when William&#39;s paws weren&#39;t in a particular spot.<br />
Martha thought about saying something, but the feeling of six paws caressing her body while she continued to massage various erogenous zones on Dawn was just too good to pass up.<br />
<br />
When Dawn suddenly started switching positions so she could begin lapping at Martha&#39;s wet cunt, that&#39;s when the werecat realized that the cock of the werevixen&#39;s husband had finally slipped out of her.<br />
Dawn&#39;s own moist pussy was right in front of Martha&#39;s face. The thought of tasting both vixen honey and fox cum made the werecat hesitate, even as Dawn&#39;s talented tongue began bringing new pleasures to Martha. <i>She&#39;s as good as Samantha and Frances! I wonder what would happen if the four of us hooked up?</i><br />
Deciding to take the plunge, Martha moved closer and sniffed Dawn&#39;s pussy. The heady scent drove her wild and soon the werecat was lapping at her new partner&#39;s cunt like there was no tomorrow, demanding every drop that was hidden inside the furry folds of the werevixen&#39;s vagina.<br />
She had tasted werefox before, having plenty of experience enjoying William&#39;s output. Douglas&#39; was almost the same, but just different enough to be an individual taste as well.<br />
And mixed with his wife&#39;s juices...<br />
Martha couldn&#39;t help wondering what combined Andersons tasted like to the Hales even as she continued to drink out of Dawn&#39;s furry chalice.<br />
<br />
BUT LOST IN HER EUPHORIC STATE...<br />
Martha was unaware that when Dawn started lapping at her cunt, William&#39;s werefox penis was still inside her.<br />
The werevixen didn&#39;t care. In fact she was looking forward to it. His top knot had just reappeared outside of Martha as Dawn began licking what she could of William&#39;s shaft even as the last couple of inches slipped out of his wife.<br />
As soon as the head appeared, Dawn briefly sucked it into her mouth, licking the underside and all around even as she tried to gobble down any leftovers directly from it.<br />
<i>His staying power isn&#39;t much more than Douglas&#39;, but William definitely has the bigger dick,</i> thought the very horny Dawn, before going back to the tasty werecat pussy waiting for her.<br />
William shuddered in pleasure from the brief experience of his vulpine penis being in another talented mouth. He had promised Martha he would never cheat on her again, and the life/mate bond with his wife was as strong at that moment as it had been since he became a werefox.<br />
Yet William Anderson couldn&#39;t help wondering if Martha would be willing to exchange partners for a while, or even invite him along the next time she had sex with another bi-were female so they could make it a threesome.<br />
<i>I can see it in William&#39;s eyes, the way he&#39;s looking at me,</i> thought Dawn, before going back to concentrate on the juicy cunt before her. <i>Douglas wants to. I DEFINITELY want to. William wants to, now that he realizes he wouldn&#39;t be betraying the life/mate bond with Martha if they mutually played with others,</i> she concluded, not knowing about William&#39;s cheating past and the Andersons&#39; initial hesitation at considering this afternoon&#39;s orgy. <i>Now all I have to do is convince Martha it&#39;s okay to switch partners and this orgy can really get into gear!</i></p>
