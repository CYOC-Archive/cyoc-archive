<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dean looked at Jeff for a moment proud of what he had orchestrated. Jeff looked good and now had a new skill and career path that he had surely never even considered. Dean was pleased with himself, but what next?<br />
<br />
Dean was just staring at Jeff and after a moment Jeff asked if he was done.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! I...&quot; Dean stopped mid sentence suddenly going far away mentally. Jeff stared eagerly wondering what his friend was concocting. <br />
<br />
Without a word, Dean began typing and clicking furiously. Jeff asked what he was up to but was immediately shushed. Growing nervous, Jeff stood up to walk over to the computer but his friend put up a hand stopping him in his tracks.<br />
<br />
Dean smiled and clicked go. The machine beeped telling Jeff that whatever was happening was going to happen and he noticed the blissful excitement in Dean&#39;s eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, How do you feel?&quot; Dean asked eagerly, barely able to contain his excitement.<br />
<br />
Taking a quick inventory Jeff didn&#39;t find anything out of place. &quot;Fine, like normal. What did you do?&quot; Jeff asked smirking. Dean&#39;s exuberance was rubbing off on him and he was feeling quite curious. <br />
<br />
Dean just smiled, eyes still glistening, &quot;look in the mirror.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff went to the mirror and saw his normal self, average size, muscular build, short dark brown hair, medium stubble, piercing blue eyes. He was wearing a black suit like usual and had his sunglasses on his head. He looked back at Dean, unable to see what was different about the situation, then back at the mirror. Was it the suit? No something else. Looking back at Dean, almost asking...<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m 25.&quot; Trying to clarify he repeated, &quot;I AM 25. Dean, I said no mental changes.&quot; Jeff folded his arms and gave Dean a stern look of disapproval.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff, I know what you said but at least hear me out. Try to hold off judgement till I&#39;m done. Jeff..... You&#39;re my butler.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!?!&quot; Jeff boomed with his deep voice and the room echoed. He flushed with rage and immediately advanced on Dean.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait.&quot; Dean said calmly. &quot;That&#39;s the worst of it, I swear, and it isn&#39;t in the capacity you&#39;re thinking.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Explain quickly and clearly.&quot; Jeff was on the verge of violence and a million and one ways he could maim or kill Dean was flashing through his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your a pilot.&quot; Dean offered quickly. &quot;A skilled driver, everything from motorcycles to cruise ships to tanks. You know karate, as a master, and all other forms of martial arts and hand to hand, and weapon combat. You are excellent at archery and firearms. You are a master of disguise and special effects and acting. You know any language and can become anyone. You have an IQ of 170. You have military and para-military training. You are an expert medical doctor, strategist, assassin, escape artist, physical therapist, bodybuilder, psychologist, architect, pyrotechnic/demolitions and the list goes on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are everything anyone could ever hope to be, ever.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff staggered and sat on his bed, he knew so much but he was only 25. &quot;Why do I have the military training? I mean, I could leave now and disappear forever, here or into another country. I&#39;m sure of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dean beamed, &quot;Precisely, but you wouldn&#39;t leave without me, would you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No! You&#39;re my... my kid?!&quot; Jeff stared at Dean in horror; what had he done? That wasn&#39;t the right word but so many things were bouncing around in his head. &quot;Charge?&quot; Not quite right either. &quot;WARD! That&#39;s it, You&#39;re my ward!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff looked quizzically at Dean who sat silently enjoying the reality he created unfold before him. &quot;But Dean what about your pa... I&#39;m sorry! That was thoughtless of me.&quot; <br />
<br />
Dean had set the reality so that his parents were murdered by his uncle for their vast wealth. They were the primary investors for a company called TransDem Laboratories Inc. The company has done fantastically well and they sold out making billions. The uncle was caught and was on death row but Dean, the only living heir, was still in danger. With no family, he went into the witness protection program and was assigned to Jeff. Dean&#39;s real parents (from before this reality) were assigned a new comfortable life with one less child. Jeff got his histories confused and felt terrible about Dean&#39;s situation though Dean didn&#39;t feel a thing about this reality other than excitement.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s OK Jeff, I&#39;m not impacted by this reality&#39;s past like you are but go on... what are you to me besides my &#39;OLD&#39; friend?&quot; Dean thought he was hilarious.<br />
<br />
Jeff ignored him, &quot;To the rest of the world I am your father, uncle, or big brother as the situation warrants. I am your bodyguard, driver, friend, protector, and caretaker.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s mind was reeling, his 170 IQ and psychology major told him something was still wrong with this picture, &quot;Despite all the cool perks, I am almost a decade older meaning I lost a decade of my youth. Also I will watch over and worry over you for the next two years while you blow millions of dollars on fun stuff. What gives?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dean just smiled, &quot;You will age one year over the next decade, we will turn 26 together and then you will age normally. As for the fun you will do it all with me, and although you are 25 now, you will still enjoy things like you are my age, whatever my age is when we do something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You intend for this to be permanent or at least until you get tired of it, which won&#39;t be any time soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, at the very least we can try it, if we don&#39;t like it in a year, or three, or five, we can try something new. Come back to now, both be 25, maybe I can make you a druggie and I&#39;ll be your cop roommate but we will know the reality is made up so I wont bust you because we&#39;re friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a horrible idea!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dean just laughed and Jeff joined in after him.<br />
<br />
Jeff didn&#39;t realize that Dean specifically manipulated his feelings towards Dean to be just as he described above. Physical protection and friendship feelings come into play well before any parental feelings do, and Dean will use this to his advantage.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked around, suddenly seeming to become aware of his surroundings. &quot;We need to get back to our place, we shouldn&#39;t have contact with my family or any of your old friends. It was a bad idea for us to come here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grabbing the laptop with the Chronivac program Jeff guided Dean out the window, Dean found his new life exciting and couldn&#39;t wait to use all his friends new abilities.<br />
<br />
Drink, try disguises, travel the world, party, they are going to have so much fun!</p>
