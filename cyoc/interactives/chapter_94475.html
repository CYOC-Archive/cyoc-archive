<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Destiny and her friend Mary had been invited by another girl from their high school senior’s class to come and attend this party at some rich girl’s summer beach house near the coast of New England somewhere so the girls got in their jeep and drove off. It was a long weekend and there was nothing else going on so a party just sounded like the coolest thing to do that day. <br />
<br />
Furthermore, Mary had a friend living close by where the girls could stay and spend the night so they didn’t have to worry about driving back the same night to New York. It would be great! So, once they arrived at the beach house, they saw tons of cars parked outside and they were intrigued by the loud music that was blaring throughout the neighborhood. This was definitely the place to be. <br />
<br />
Once they arrived there, they wandered in and they made their way to where a few guys were standing around. A small bar had been set up, and one of the cute young men was serving drinks. There was a DJ with his equipment, along with a dance floor out on the patio and a small pool in the back yard. About fifty people were walking around and mingling together when a young man walked up to Mary while holding a beer bottle in his hand. <br />
<br />
“So, are you girls having fun yet?” the boy said to Mary. <br />
<br />
“Oh Eric… Absolutely. You got a couple of cute guys here… Including yourself!” Mary grinned, while flirting at her host. <br />
<br />
“Well, just be careful who you talk to and who you come in contact with. There is word that some of these guys have been infected with some kind of ‘Gay Male Virus’. I’m not sure whether that is true or not, but that is what a few people have been talking about. One girl has already gone missing and we had one guy walk around and we had no idea who he was but he had no clothes on… So, some weird shit has been happening around this place!”<br />
<br />
“Well, thanks for the warning, Eric…” Mary grinned. “I bet it’s all just a myth set up to keep us from having a good time. Parents will think of anything to prevent us from… Having a little kinky fun…” <br />
<br />
Mary then turned around and looked to see where Destiny was. Her best friend was short and athletic but she had nice, long blonde hair and she had smashing CC-cup breasts. She was wearing her fire-red top and her black jeans so she was just looking smashing. Lastly, she was wearing her new high heels so it made her even taller than she was. <br />
<br />
“Hey there Destiny… Keep you guard up, okay?” Mary said to her. Both of them were just sitting in high chairs by the bar. “Word is getting around that some guys have been infected with some weird virus that changes anyone into a gay male…” <br />
<br />
“Ohh please!” Destiny pouted. “I heard that one at school a few weeks ago! I don’t believe that crap for one bit! If a virus can change a girl into a guy then a virus can also change a guy into a chick!” <br />
<br />
Finally, after the two girls had spent almost twenty minutes just sitting there and talking to one another, one of the young men walked up to Mary and introduced himself to her. <br />
<br />
“Hi… I’m Stan! Can I have this next dance with you?” the boy asked her politely.<br />
<br />
“Sure, sweetheart!” Mary grinned as she stood up and walked over to the dance floor with the handsome hunk, leaving Destiny all by herself. <br />
<br />
“Ohh great. Here I am, all by myself! That is not right…” she grumbled, as she looked around the room. She glanced around and spotted a young guy sitting all by himself on the other end of the bar. She stood up, flipped her hair, and strolled up to him before sitting down at the empty bar stool right next to him. <br />
<br />
“Hey there, stranger…” she said in a low, seductive voice. “I saw you sitting here… all alone…” <br />
<br />
The man was in his early 30’s and he had a short, trimmed beard and a mustache. He turned around and glanced over at Destiny with a surprised look on his face. <br />
<br />
“Hey, what brings you here, cupcake?” he grinned. <br />
<br />
“Well, you looked like you needed someone to talk to, so here I am…” she grinned as she extended her hand. “I’m your Destiny…” <br />
<br />
“Well, that’s a cute name, Destiny…” the man said in a gruff, baritone voice. “My name is David… So, are you enjoying yourself so far?” <br />
<br />
 “Well… I would enjoy myself a little more if I could get to know you better…” Destiny smiled as she rubbed her hand over David’s chest. “Do you know what I mean, jellybean?” <br />
<br />
“Ahh, well they got a few private rooms in the back…” David said, as he stood up and led her to a small bedroom down the hall. They closed the door and she removed her clothes and so did he. Then they got in bed together and they cuddled up against each other for a few minutes. He then rubbed his cock and she stuck the tip of his large 8-inch manhood in her mouth so she could swallow cum that she was shooting thanks to his erection. They took turns and lay on top of each other, hugging and kissing, until they fell asleep. Finally, when Destiny woke up again, she crawled off of David’s body and put her clothes on and left the bedroom and closed the door. <br />
<br />
“Destiny! Where have you been?” Mary growled as she practically ran into her near the bar. “I have been looking all over for you!” <br />
<br />
“Oh relax! I was in one of the rooms with another guy…” <br />
<br />
“Are you kidding me? Haven’t you heard about this virus?” Mary gasped. “You could catch it and then--“ <br />
<br />
“MARY! I’m not gonna catch no stupid virus! You gotta be joking!” Destiny screamed at her. “I was just with some guy! Nothing happened! Nothing at all and we just… UGH!—“Destiny cringed as she doubled over and grabbed and held on to her stomach with both arms. <br />
<br />
“Destiny? What’s the matter? What’s going on?” Mary said, as her friend was leaning forward as if she was going to puke. <br />
<br />
“Arrhh…. Arrrhhhhhh…. AAAAARHHHHHGGG!!!” Destiny bellowed while holding on to her stomach. <br />
<br />
“Come on… Let’s get you into one of these rooms and get you in bed… You look like you’re about to get sick or something!” Mary screamed as she held on to Destiny and led her into the very same room where she was earlier. <br />
<br />
“UUUUHHH… It hurts…. My stomach HURTS…” Destiny cried out as she collapsed on the bed and Mary closed the door. <br />
<br />
“Do I need to call an ambulance to come and get you and take you to the hospital?” Mary wondered. <br />
<br />
“NooOOOoo…. NOOOoooOO…” she bellowed, as her voice began to change! Destiny’s voice became deeper! <br />
<br />
As Mary looked on in total shock, she began to witness the changes that Destiny was going through, right before her eyes!<br />
<br />
Destiny’s face changed completely. She gained more hair all over as the long, blonde hair became shorter but more facial hair appeared around the lips and around the chin. Hair started to sprout on her arms and legs as well, and in her armpits. Speaking of which… Her arms began to inflate with muscle while they grew longer. Her hands, palms and fingers grew bigger, thicker and longer while her nails shortened. <br />
<br />
Her breasts suddenly flattened and disappeared as thick, round pectorals surfaced in their places. Large round pecs formed and pushed her shoulders wider while her flat stomach had suddenly gained washboard abdominal muscles which led all he way down to her groin. <br />
<br />
Her female genitals disappeared completely, closing up the hole in her groin while at the same time small stubble formed between her legs. The stubble formed and grew thicker and longer until it formed into a long, 7-inch male penis with two round testicles hanging beneath them. <br />
<br />
Lastly, her quads thickened and widened with rock-hard muscle above the knees and her calves inflated into big, round balloons. Her feet grew larger as well, making her feet burst out of her high heels. She was completely unable to fit in her clothes now as her growing body caused her to burst out of her top and her jeans. <br />
<br />
Mary gasped. She almost cried. She raised up her hands and placed them over her mouth. Destiny no longer looked like that beautiful young, blonde girl she had known from school. No, she was now older, bigger and no longer a girl AT ALL. She had short, spikey hair and her face was clearly that of a… MAN! <br />
<br />
His arms were thick and muscular and his chest was big and wide… His torso was huge and his legs were long and muscular… He looked NOTHING like Destiny as all!<br />
<br />
Destiny just lay there when she finally opened “her” eyes and looked around the room, giving Mary a very groggy glance. <br />
<br />
“Uhhhrgg… What happened? I have this terrible headache right now…” she groaned. “Urrhhh, why does my voice sound so different? I sound like I came down with a horrible cold or something…” <br />
<br />
“Uhmmm, Destiny? You… Uhh… You look a little… Uhh… Different…” Mary said softly. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, well I FEEL different, too… And my clothes are KILLING me! Everything is too small on me! What the heck is going on? I can’t even wear my shoes anymore!” <br />
<br />
“You… You better check yourself out… In the mirror over here…” Mary said, as she pointed at the full-body mirror which was hanging on the wall next to the bed. <br />
<br />
Destiny slowly got off the edge of the bad and stumbled over to the wall. She wasn’t used to her height, her weight or her larger frame!<br />
<br />
When she saw her reflection in the mirror the very first time, her eyes bugged wide and her jaw dropped wide open as she let out a loud gasp at the sight of her new body.<br />
<br />
“HOLY SHIT! I’M A GUY!” <br />
<br />
“Uhmm… Destiny… You… You grew… You’re a man…” Mary said calmly. <br />
<br />
“MARY! I’M AN OLD MAN! WHAT THE HELL!!??” she screamed as she ran her big hands over her chest and face. <br />
<br />
“You… You’ve been infected, Destiny…” Mary stuttered. “You got the virus…”<br />
<br />
“WHAT THE HELL AM I GONNA DO? I DON’T EVEN HAVE CLOTHES TO WEAR!” she, or he, hollered out loud. <br />
<br />
“Okay… Okay… Destiny… I’m gonna ask around… I’m gonna get you some clothes… Just… Just stay here!” Mary stammered as she opened the bedroom door and ran out really quick. <br />
<br />
“Ohmygod… This is insane… I’m a guy… I’m a freaking GUY…” he said, as he sat back down on the edge of the bed while staring at his reflection in the mirror. “What am I gonna do?” <br />
<br />
Moments later, Mary returned with a set of shorts, a large shirt, underwear, socks and some old shoes.<br />
<br />
“Destiny! One of the other guys had a bag with extra clothes because he was spending the night here! So he just gave me these! He was about your size, so…” Mary cheered as she handed him he clothes. Luckily Destiny was able to remove all his old clothes and put these on and they all fit his new, bigger body!<br />
<br />
“Come on, let’s get outta here! We need to get you home!” Mary ordered as she and the “new” Destiny walked out past the bar. <br />
<br />
But then, something happened. <br />
<br />
On the way out, one of the guys at the bar turned around and stopped Destiny as he was walking towards the door. <br />
<br />
“Hey there, handsome… What is a cute guy like you doing, leaving so early?” the man said. <br />
<br />
Mary was almost out the door when she realized that Destiny was no longer following her. She turned around and realized that he was now talking to another man!<br />
<br />
“I… Uhh… I don’t know anyone here, so…” Destiny stuttered.<br />
<br />
“A cute guy like you? I never saw you enter! My name is James! What’s your name?” the big, imposing man asked him. <br />
<br />
“Uhh… My name is… Uhh… Derek…” Destiny said. Obviously he couldn’t use the name ‘Destiny’ anymore. <br />
<br />
Then James and Derek started talking longer and longer and longer… Finally, Mary just gave up on waiting and she left. It was obvious that James was a gay man. The next day, Mary checked Destiny’s Facebook and she saw that the account had been deleted. Instead, she got a friend request from a guy named Derek, who was now in a relationship with another guy named James. A few months later, the two men would get married.<br />
<br />
So, Mary was happy. At least her girlfriend Destiny ended up becoming a happy man after all!</p>
