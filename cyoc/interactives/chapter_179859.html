<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Walking around for half an hour with underwear and jeans that felt too tight in the right places left you mentally exhausted, wondering just how long you could still hold out. A bike ride, you decided, would&#39;ve been even worse an endeavor, and public transport was too public for transport. So instead, you and Sadie decided to travel to the city center by car, and parked in a parking garage about fifteen minutes away from the stores, including the Magic Shop.<br />
<br />
That did not mean however, that your Sadie wanted to make a beeline towards the shop, first standing around looking into the windows of other stores, looking for new clothes to wear. More in particular, shoes and legwear.<br />
<br />
Because although your jacket seemed to cover most of your bloated ass away from the view of the occasional sceptic onlooker, your girlfriend still had it in her to tease you about being a girl below the belt.<br />
<br />
You hated to admit that you&#39;d been staring at the shopwindow for adult toys for a little too long, taking in the nice colors, shapes, and sizes that seemed to spark something from deep within you. When you finally noticed Sadie looking at you with a big grin on her face, you blushed, and marched onwards, hoping the teasing feeling between your legs would dissipate at a faster rate at a quicker gait.<br />
<br />
So when you finally arrived at the Magic Shop in double the time you&#39;d expected it to take from the spot where you and Sadie parked the car, you&#39;d thought you were past the worst of trouble.<br />
<br />
Until you had to explain your predicament to the store clerc, the same person you&#39;d bought the stockings from. Her expression was already one of amusement, but also sympathy, as she watched you and your girlfriend enter.<br />
<br />
Once you were done explaining, she offered you the options she had available, the solutions for your unwanted transformation. Sadie, meanwhile was walking around the store, looking for a gift of her choosing.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are always solutions that the store can offer for permanent transformations applied through supernatural undertakings. From what I&#39;ve heard of your story, you want your penis back, is that correct?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not <i>just</i> my penis,&quot; you answered. &quot;My legs have turned into women&#39;s legs as well. My butt is jutting out from behind me, and I can&#39;t properly wear my own clothes anymore. I&#39;m not looking forward to a complete wardrobe change one of these days.&quot; Perhaps that was what your girlfriend was hinting at, pointing at and entering shops like Victoria&#39;s secret and the like.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can never guarantee perfect reversals for products with permanent or long-lasting effects, especially with some forms of magic over-ruling the effects of other forms. What I can do however, is offer you an assortment of products we currently have in stock that can, if not completely, then at least partially, solve the issues you&#39;re currently having with your new body image.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not having issues with my body image, I want the changes reverted, that is all.&quot;<br />
<br />
The clerk smiled. &quot;Please, give me a moment. I&#39;ll be back with an assortment of items from storage in a couple of minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded, and the shopkeeper went on her way.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; the woman started, grabbing your attention from the counter you were leaned up against, girlfriend standing next to you making small talk. &quot;I&#39;ve got three products from memory, which generally have a positive response from users, and hold low-risk, in suffering permanent changes, so long as they&#39;re applied properly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Starting with this salve, called &#39;Beast-Mode Muscle Oil&#39;. It improves muscle and hair-growth on the body. It&#39;s not dissimilar from testosterone shots some weightlifters might sometimes use to get strong quickly, although this requires no pill-usage, and avoids application through injection. Above all else, it&#39;s area-based. I&#39;d recommend using gloves when applying the salve, but if you were to smear it on your legs, for example, it would stimulate hair- and muscle growth specifically on your legs. As usual, don&#39;t use too much at once, and spread it out all over the areas on which you want to apply it. Regular treatment will improve the size and strength of your muscles, and the growth of hair over the long-term as well.&quot; The shopkeeper set it down on the counter, and offered you a smile. &quot;I&#39;d say twice a day, before going to bed and after waking up, with good, long walk or proper exercise in the afternoon, and you&#39;ll be set. Muscles will make you more masculine.&quot;<br />
<br />
It definitely had its benefits, but it didn&#39;t solve the problem <i>between</i> your legs. You nodded again, checking out the label, before looking expectantly at the shopkeeper for the other two products she managed to conjure up for you.<br />
<br />
&quot;This second salve... personally I just call it &#39;Viagra for Women&#39;, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s how you would want to call it. The salve, when applied on a woman&#39;s clitoris, will stimulate sudden onset growth, and its shape and size will make it look, feel, and act similar to a penis, though fully erect at a constant, with the changes dissipating after some amount of time, depending on how much of the salve you&#39;ve applied to your clit. When applying it to your labia, it will make them puff out a bit, becoming slightly larger and rounder. With a bit of imagination it would look like your testicles grew back.&quot; She glanced over at your girlfriend with a quirk of her lips. &quot;Again, be careful about applying too much at once. It will only make the erection it will form last longer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Choosing a temporary penis over a permanent clitoris was a choice you would&#39;ve made pretty quickly, but again, it wouldn&#39;t change you back completely, nor did it have lasting effects. Besides, although your new labia would grow out to look a little more like a ballsack again, there was still a leaky pussy between these plumped up lips. You knew Sadie would probably like this product though.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lastly, I&#39;ve got a dildo kit for you.&quot; The clerk said, as she lifted a box up the counter. You jerked back, eyes wide, face flushed. &quot;Just like the previous product, it&#39;s centered around enhancing pleasure in bed and improving sex life. This dildo kit is meant for couple&#39;s in particular though.&quot; She turned the box around, pointing at several images printed out on its side. &quot;Several items are packed in here, shapes and sizes of some of them based on animal parts, double-sided and hyperrealistic, including ballsack. The backside is smaller. It&#39;s the part the user can insert in their own vagina, with the other side functional to let others enjoy it, so to speak. Inserting them will create a link that makes it impossible for them to detach unless you, the wearer tug down on it from the bottom. Some can turn flaccid when you&#39;ve done the deed, or you&#39;re no longer aroused in general, others remain hard permanently, depending on which dildo you&#39;re using. You can continue walking around with them all normal and the sensations would be the same as having a normal penis, depending on the one you&#39;re wearing. You&#39;ll feel nothing of the rod-end you&#39;ve inserted inside your vagina.<br />
<br />
&quot;For the receiving end, I&#39;d recommend this.&quot; The shopkeeper slapped a small box on the counter, containing a gel of sorts, and gave your girlfriend a long, stern look, albeit with a grin on her face. &quot;&#39;Loose Lube&#39;, it is called. And as much as I hate that misogynistic creator for naming it that way, it absolutely works wonder, and I&#39;d highly recommend it. You can use it on any orifice, vaginal, anal, oral, your navel, you name it. Its price gets cut in half when purchased with the kit, for your sake more than our own really.&quot;<br />
<br />
You realized you&#39;d been staring again, this time at the large box on the counter, with images of far too realistic-looking animal penises on display. You weren&#39;t the only one looking though. Your girlfriend, who was always cheerful and talkative, had not spoken a word with you ever since the clerk returned from the storage with these products in hand.<br />
<br />
She finally turned to you with a smile on her face, one you couldn&#39;t really place as either horny of lovingly, but most likely longingly. &quot;I think I know what I want for my gift baby,&quot; she told you.</p>
