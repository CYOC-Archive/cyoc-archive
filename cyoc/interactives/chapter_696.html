<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Using more muscle than logic, Sean (who, in his changed state could easily have put one of them under each arm and carried them) managed to get the two skinny
<br> guys to the car and hustled them into the back seat. 
<br>
<br> &quot;Shith, I don'th feel tho - urp - good,&quot; Jay slurred, then shut his eyes and lolled his head back. 
<br>
<br> &quot;This can't be happening, dude. What the holy Hell is going on,&quot; Mark asked. When he realized Jay had passed out, he made to grasp Sean's shoulder, but was
<br> unable to reach it. he was stunned to see the the tips of his fingers only came up to the wrist seam of his sleeve, nothing but empty facbric dangling beyond. 
<br>
<br> &quot;Listen, Mark, I think you and Jay, uh, maybe got some bad beer or soemthing,&quot; Sean said as he gunned the car onto the highway. &quot;Let me just get you home - I
<br> bet we can sort all this out there.&quot; 
<br>
<br> Enough of the earlier 'lack of awareness' zap Sean had given was still there for Mark to acquiesce. 
<br>
<br> Once in his own parking lot, Sean pulled out the handheld unit and tried to scroll it to 'Obedience' - without even checking the percentage or other controls, he
<br> turned and zapped mark right in the forehead. 
<br>
<br> &quot;Hey, dude, wha're you ....&quot; Mark's voice trailed off. 
<br>
<br> &quot;Listen, Mark, first thing we have to do is get Jay upstairs. I'll take his legs, you take his feet!&quot; Sean ordered. 
<br>
<br> Mark got out of the car and moved to the opposite side, opening the door there. His pants fell down. His shirt now covered him to the knee. 
<br>
<br> &quot;Um, OK. Mark, take off your pants!&quot; Sean ordered when he reached the same side of the car. Mark did so. He ended up clad in socks, shirt and boxers that
<br> hung from one bony hip, the other side canted down nearly on a didagonal. 
<br>
<br> &quot;Shit. Mark, put your shoes back on!&quot; Sean said. Once that was done, Sean grabbed Mark's jeans and slung them over his shoulder. The top of the skinny boy's
<br> head now barely came up to Sean's shoulder. &quot;Now, Mark, help me pull Jay out.&quot; 
<br>
<br> Together, they maneuvered the passed out roommate up the stairs (Sean didn't dare use the elevator). &quot;Thank God he's so light!&quot; Sean thought. Jay's butt spilled
<br> out of the loose pants as they carried him. His waistband was now hanging from below mid-thigh, the elastic waistband of his underwear about 6 inches higher, and
<br> the ends of his shirt sleeves flapped, unfilled, in the air. 
<br>
<br>
<br> &quot;Damn, we made it.&quot; Sean thought as he and Mark maneuvered the sleeping Jay to his bed. Even with Jay in his reduced state, Mark had struggled to keep his end
<br> up during the trip, and was clearly quite winded. 
<br>
<br> Realizing he'd need to take some time to come up with a story that was not only plausible, but also acceptable, he took advantage of the still-obedient Mark. 
<br>
<br> &quot;Mark, strip Jay, then yourself. Then lie down next to him and fall asleep until I tell you otherwise, you are no longer compelled to obey me, or another zap
<br> supersedes this one.&quot; 
<br>
<br> Mark, thanks to the last zap, did as he was told. When both of them were on the bed, eyes shut, then, and only then, did Sean have the chance to see in full what
<br> he had wrought. 
<br>
<br> Two shorter-than-average guys. Body hair did not seem to have been affected (Sean didn't know about Mark, but had seen Jay in the buff enough to assume that
<br> no changes had occurred). 
<br>
<br> Everything was smaller, in proportion. Hands. Feet. Legs. Arms. Everything. 
<br>
<br> And each of them would have now been rejected for the 'before' picture of a Charles Atlas ad, as being too damn slight. 
<br>
<br> Sean figured their waists were now 18 - 20 tops - inches. No musculature broke the straight line of their arms or legs. Although in proportion, their hands and feet
<br> 'seemed' out of balance, due to the narrowness of their wrists and ankles. 
<br>
<br> Mark moaned, then rolled onto one side. Sean noticed his now flat butt, with a deep indentation on the side of the cheek facing upwards. 
<br>
<br> Jay's face, while noticeably thinner and sharper, hadn't changed all too much. In Mark's case, he had a pinched and sallow look now, and his formerly thick neck
<br> looked as if it would barely be capable of supporting his head. Ribs clearly were visible at his side. Jay's sunken chest moved shallowly up and down. His concave
<br> stomach formed a cavity so deep it seemed one wopuld be able to touch his spinal column right through the navel. Neither boys' feet reached even close to the end
<br> of the bed. 
<br>
<br> &quot;Not a bad night's work, if I say so myself,&quot; Sean congratulated himself. &quot;I bet I can fix it so they'll stay like this, too, with no way to bulk up again.&quot; 
<br>
<br> Sean went into the kitchen for a drink, gulping down 1/2 a can of beer in one draught. Jay's pants were still draped over one of his shoulders. Sean held them up
<br> and a sly smile crossed his lips. &quot;Yeah, that would be the final thing, wouldn't it?&quot; he thought 
<br>
<br> Sean headed back to the computer and plugged in the handheld unit, then brought up 2 windows, one with Jay's stats, one with Mark's. &quot;This first, then I'll come
<br> up with some way to make them think everything's normal,&quot; he thought. &quot;After all, when will I ever get this chance again?&quot; 
<br>
<br> Scrolling down the stats, he came to the particular one he needed and changed the appropriate numbers, then made sure to load the change into the handheld unit. 
<br>
<br> &quot;And this, too, just in case,&quot; he added. 
<br>
<br> Stepping into Jay's room, Sean pointed the hand unit at first his roommate, then at Mark, zapping each in turn. Both of them flinched as the energy hit them. 
<br>
<br> The second thing Sean had programmed in was a peaceful sleep command, set to last 12 hours. 
<br>
<br> The first command was a 'little' fetish of Sean's, one he'd only been able to read about on a certain web site up until now. 
<br>
<br> Jay was still on his back. Mark, on one side, was more difficult to see properly. Sean moved the Jay's side of the bed as the change began so he could more
<br> clearly see them both. 
<br>
<br> It was hard to notice at first, especially with his eyes moving from one to the other of them and back again, but - it was happening! Jay's cock was definitely getting
<br> shorter. Mark, having a bit more to begin with (even in his 'ectomporphic' shape) was shrinking a bit more slowly. 
<br>
<br> &quot;Oooh, yeah,&quot; Sean thought, watching his roommate's dick get shorter, shorter. Couldn't be much more than 3 inches now. He glanced at Mark, and saw the soft
<br> organ, which had been curved down to the mattress by gravity, pull inwards and straighter. 
<br>
<br> &quot;Cool,&quot; Sean thought. &quot;Just like that story!&quot; 
<br>
<br> He looked again at Jay, just in time to see the shaft disappear into his curly pubic hair. Only the head showed now. Then even that began to retreat until just the
<br> very tip showed from the thicket of hairs. 
<br>
<br> Mark was approaching the same state. His pubic hair, though, was thinner (Sean suspected he either shaved or waxed) so the final change was more evident. Just
<br> about 1/2-inch long dicks now graced each of them. Perfectly normal in shape and, according to what he'd programmed, function - just much, much smaller.
<br> Nothing else, apart from what had occurred earlier in the evening, had changed. 
<br>
<br> Sean crossed his meaty arms over his hefty chest and smiled. He was actually getting physically excited at what had transpired.</p>
