<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Molly&#39;s story is an old story that&#39;s been heard so many times. Though there were a few different variants to make it stand out. One part of the story is living as a lesbian in an era that was less accepting of them. Truthfully, that could have been any time before the last decade or so, but in particular, she was born in the 50&#39;s. Another part of the story is living as a tomboy in a society where women were expected to housewives. Molly had no interest in domestic activities like cooking and cleaning. She was far more interested in sports. And not the delicate ones women were allowed to play like badminton. Molly was a fan of boxing, wrestling, and she admired the growing trend of bodybuilding.<br />
<br />
As such, it wasn&#39;t much surprise that Molly was part of the Women&#39;s Liberation movement. She was even part of the Lavender Menace, which specifically spoke for the rights of lesbian feminists who were having their voice suppressed by both the majority and straight lesbians. That was where Molly first met Shelly, who also had similar interests to her. The two of them quickly fell in love and eloped. Though technically, it was an illegal marriage at the time. In fact, as far as the law is currently concerned, they aren&#39;t officially married even now. A problem which they&#39;ll be taking care of later.<br />
<br />
The next part of Molly&#39;s story was that of the boxer whose career was cut short. Molly and Shelly were both interested in boxing and wrestling, but there were naturally limitations to what they could participate in, particularly at the time. Molly was the only one who was fervent about pursuing a fighting career and the only who had a close enough physical build to let her compete. Unfortunately, the only place for women was an underground boxing ring that was run by the Mafia. And it wasn&#39;t just considered illegal just because women were fighting in it. For one thing, there were no gloves to soften the blows. And quite a lot of the fights were sexualized in some way. Molly had been in a few fights where she had to go topless for instance.<br />
<br />
Shelly worried about her partner and tried to talk her out of it. But Molly was adamant and said that one of them had to pursue the dream and she was the only close enough to do it. But as the saying goes &#39;close only counts for horseshoes and hand grenades&#39;. That wasn&#39;t to say that Molly didn&#39;t come out on top in all of her fights, but she under-performed by the Mafia&#39;s expectations. Molly was good at exchanging punches, but the illegal ring allowed a lot more grappling than standard boxing and that was where Molly folded. The other female fighters soon keened onto her weakness and Molly began losing more and more fights. The Mafia that had been supporting her were losing a lot of money now. Eventually, they decided to cut their losses and force Molly into retirement. Molly was fortunate that they only crippled her legs, they could have done something much, much worse.<br />
<br />
Molly&#39;s spirit wasn&#39;t broken with her legs, but it almost was. Shelly was still extremely supportive, caring for her partner even though she was now wheelchair-bound. At least the Mafia had left them enough money to live comfortably on until Shelly could get a job to support them both. When Animalia first came around, Shelly tried to convince Molly to sign up so she could be healed. But Molly was reluctant, not about becoming an Animalian, but thinking that she deserved to be one. It was her own pride that made her get into boxing and keep trying at it despite the obvious disadvantage she had. If she had stayed out of it or walked away while she could, she&#39;d still be walking. It took some convincing to eventually get Molly to come, particularly to take advantage of the discount for Pride Month.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
&quot;There isn&#39;t a danger of us falling out of love, is there?&quot; asked Shelly with concern.<br />
<br />
&quot;Despite what some people will tell you, no,&quot; said Dr. Stein, &quot;Despite what some people say, the Animalian virus doesn&#39;t &#39;cure&#39; homosexuality, just makes people compatible with heterosexuality. You may show some interest in males, but you&#39;ll still be in love with each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So there&#39;s no problems then,&quot; said Shell with relief.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not quite,&quot; said Dr. Stein, &quot;Though this is mostly a medical concern.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked Molly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, your legs were broken at least in two places and were not properly set when they healed,&quot; said Dr. Stein.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you&#39;ve had people grow back whole limbs,&quot; said Molly.<br />
<br />
&quot;True, but those people were younger, stronger. I&#39;m worried that the pain of your bones fixing themselves will be too much for you to take,&quot; said Dr. Stein, &quot;As such, I recommend going under anesthesia while your body changes. Just a brief sleep though the worst of the pain and you&#39;ll wake up in a better body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if that&#39;s what it takes,&quot; said Molly, shifting in her chair, &quot;Let&#39;s get on with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Molly felt pretty woozy when she woke up later. She had an odd dream, that she was walking across a frozen sea. Then the ice gave out underneath her and legs ended up in the freezing water below. It was so painfully cold, but Molly crawled out. She felt stronger for it too, much stronger. But she didn&#39;t feel stronger now. Actually, she didn&#39;t know what she was feeling. And what was that white thing with the black tip in front of her?<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when Molly&#39;s memories started to clear up. The last thing she recalled was them putting a gas mask on her while Dr. Stein prepped the injection. And she remembered what she wanted to become. Having been so easily overwhelmed both by other boxers and the Mafia thugs, she wanted to be something no one would be able to push around again. And considering a polar bear was the largest land carnivore that still exists, it seemed like a perfect choice. Her head swam as she sat up. While the anesthesia was enough to put her human body to sleep, a polar bear would require a lot more. It sill made Molly lightheaded though. She got a glimpse of a much bigger body covered in white fur before she flopped back down.<br />
<br />
Her attempt to rise didn&#39;t go unnoticed. The door opened and a tigress Animalian came in. She was wearing nothing more than a dressing gown, which didn&#39;t hide much of her muscular, curvy body. &quot;Oh, Molly, you&#39;re up already,&quot; said the tigress.<br />
<br />
Molly recognized her voice as well as the long braid of her hair. Although that hair was darker than she had last saw it and it had hanged down to almost reach her behind before, but now it only came to her midback. Then again, she was considerably taller than before. &quot;Shelly?&quot; asked Molly<br />
<br />
&quot;Who else were you expecting?&quot; asked Shelly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Another bear?&quot; said Molly, not completely out of her stupor.<br />
<br />
Shelly shrugged and said, &quot;Well, it&#39;s not like we could breed each other, so why not become different species?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess so,&quot; said Molly as she got up again. She was able to stay up, though her head still spun a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me help you,&quot; said Shelly, going over to Molly and help her up to her feet. Molly tottered a bit, but Shelly held her firm. Molly soon noticed that she towered over everything in the room. Looking in the mirror made it clear why that was so. As a polar, Molly looked around 8 feet, give or take a few inches and she was definitely not covered in blubber. She saw that amazons that female Animalians could be, but it was overwhelming to see her own body so big and muscular. Not to mention having fantastic tits. Just about the only thing left of the old her was her page-cut hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, I look fantastic,&quot; said Molly, flexing one arm, showing huge muscles underneath it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course you do,&quot; said Shelly, hugging her tight. Then Molly noticed that Shelly was very big too. Not that tigers were small, but Molly would have thought she&#39;d be much bigger than Shelly, far more than the few inches she currently had on her. &quot;Wait, aren&#39;t tigers smaller than bears?&quot; asked Molly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m a Siberian tiger now,&quot; said Shelly, &quot;If you were becoming the biggest bear, why shouldn&#39;t I become the biggest cat?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, we&#39;re not natural enemies now, are we?&quot; asked Molly.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Siberian tigers live too far south,&quot; said Shelly, &quot;And speaking of south, your lower half&#39;s looking much better.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly looked down at her legs, fully registering that she was standing on them for the first time in decades. &quot;I...I can stand again...&quot; said Molly in disbelief.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not for much longer,&quot; said Shelly in a teasing tone. She grabbed Molly&#39;s ass and squeezed it. &quot;I wasn&#39;t just talking about your legs looking better,&quot; she purred. She ran her hands over Molly&#39;s wide hips. Then Shelly leaned down and gave Molly&#39;s pussy a long lick.<br />
<br />
Molly moaned. Suddenly, she was glad she was naked right now. Her legs gave out as Shelly pushed her onto the bed. Shelly took the time to take her dressing gown off. Molly&#39;s eyes widened at the busy bodybuilder before her. She loved Shelly&#39;s body before, but now she was irresistible. &quot;You&#39;re looking amazing yourself,&quot; said Molly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I am,&quot; said Shelly as the tigress approached her. She climbed on top of the bear before pausing, &quot;Before we get to it, there&#39;s something I want us to do before the month is up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it might be a bit late for signing up for the IAC,&quot; said Molly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not that,&quot; said Shelly, &quot;I want us to have a real wedding, the one we should have had years ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not saying our first wedding didn&#39;t count, did you?&quot; asked Molly with concern.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, but we had to do it in secret and unofficially. But that was then. The world&#39;s accepting same-sex marriages now. I think we deserve to have a proper one,&quot; said Shelly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like that too,&quot; said Molly before she kissed her, their huge breasts mashing up against each other. There wouldn&#39;t be much more room for talking for quite some time. Fortunately, this was a bed that was built for large Animalians having vigorous sex on top of it.</p>
