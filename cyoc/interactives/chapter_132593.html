<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The alarm was going off again. 6.30. time to rise and shine. I was Jenna McKenzie. I looked in my dressing table mirror. There was an attractive girl in a bright red chemise and a white turban. Was that me? I used to be Zach. I was definitely no longer Zach. I pulled the turban off and shook my hair out. Blonde curls fell down to below my shoulders. If I had to be a girl, I guess I couldn&#39;t have chosen a better body. I was very good looking and as I had learned over the last couple of weeks a good dancer and talented at sport. I had a lovely family who appeared to love me. <br />
<br />
There were downsides. Jenna had a history. You could call her a slut. She had a reputation that was going to be hard to overcome. The body I inhabited exhibited strong sexual desires. I was a sort of nymphomaniac. To my male mind there was nothing wrong with that. However for a female I appeared to sit on the pointy end of the bell curve. And I was on the heterosexual end of that bell curve. At the dancing lesson last night Sasha an attractive female had invited me to &#39;experiment&#39; but I had to admit I wasn&#39;t all that interested. The male part of my brain was telling me that I should be. But I had to admit to myself I wasn&#39;t. I needed a male. I craved penis.<br />
<br />
I climbed out of bed and went to the toilet. I was defiantly female. I had to sit down to pee and had a G-string around my ankles. I actually found G-strings comfortable. As a male I never imagined they could be, however now that I was emasculated I knew differently. <br />
I flushed and went to the bathroom and washed my hands. Dainty little hands with mauve painted nails. I needed to repaint the nails. I had to trim them before playing netball the other night. They needed a touch-up. I used those hands to splash my face with water. I needed to wake up.<br />
<br />
I returned to my room and donned a dressing gown then went down to the kitchen and started making myself a bowl of muesli for breakfast. Mum came out of her room also in a dressing gown &quot;Good morning Jenna&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning Mum&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The weatherman said we might get a bit of rain today&quot; I looked out the window. The sky was only just lightening. It looked clear. &quot;Make sure you have an umbrella&quot; I tried to remember if there was one in my car. I would need to check. &quot;Will you be home for dinner tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably not. I&#39;m meeting Sarah, Zach and Amanda after work. We are going to the pub for drinks. I imagine we will say for a meal. I&#39;ll go to Sarah&#39;s straight after work&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well make sure you have a coat. I suspect it might turn cold as well as wet&quot;<br />
<br />
I finished my breakfast and went to Monique’s old room where I kept some of my clothes. I had seen several coats in the cupboard there I pulled them out and chose a tan coloured trench coat. I would put that in my car. So it would be handy if the weather turned cold.<br />
I returned to my room I needed to find something I could wear to work and for drinks later.  I pulled out several of the outfits and contemplated how they would look. I ended up choosing the pink faux wrap around dress I had picked up from the post office last week. I lay that on the bed then chose a lacy pink bra and panty set and went and had a shower.<br />
<br />
After dressing and applying make-up I went to the kitchen and made a lunch. I also gave Mum $100 for board. She saw what I was wearing and said &quot;Another new dress?&quot; I nodded. &quot;I would advise wearing pantyhose today. A change should come through early afternoon&quot; I didn&#39;t really know what she meant. However I wasn&#39;t going to argue. She had been female a lot longer than me. I made my lunch and returned to my room putting on nude pantyhose and a pair of white heels. I found a small fold up umbrella that I put in my tote bag along with my lunch.<br />
<br />
At lunch time I walked across to the shopping center and bought a new supply of the shampoo and conditioner I had been using since my perm. Even though I was only going to wash infrequently I found I went through a lot of the product whenever I did.<br />
<br />
In the afternoon one of Millicent’s patients was a no show. She offered to give my teeth another whitening treatment. Maria was happy for me to do so and I soon found myself back in the chair with Millicent working on my teeth. She and Maggie were also going to the Linda&#39;s party. Evidently Linda&#39;s parents were also friends of Millicent’s. Maggie would be there with her husband. She was getting a babysitter in to look after her 9 and 7 year old sons. They would not stay past 10. <br />
<br />
Millicent was happy with the way my teeth had cleaned up and said there was no need for a third treatment. She said that if she made my teeth any whiter they would not look natural. I thanked her for the treatments and returned to the front office. While I was getting my teeth done a weather change had come through. It was windy aan wet outside. I volunteered to stay late again because of the time I had missed. Maria and Linda were grateful.<br />
<br />
I tidied and swept the waiting area while the last patients were been seen.  So I was ready to go home once Millicent’s last patient had paid for his consultation. I wished I had listened to Mum and had my coat with me rather than to have left it in the car. I would get wet walking to the car even if it was only 50 meters away. I wasn&#39;t game to run in my 3 inch heels.<br />
<br />
Millicent finished and the patient paid for his treatment and made a new booking for 3 weeks’ time. I bade him goodbye then went and got my bag and told Millicent I was leaving. I got my mini umbrella out, it would barely cover my head. I found I was waiting at the door for the rain to ease, even though I knew it could be hours. Eventually I got up the courage and opened the door and stepped out into the cold. I had to take small steps because of fear of slipping in my shoes, but moved as quickly as I could. I arrived at the car and cursed myself because I didn&#39;t already have my keys out. As a male the keys were always readily accessible in my pocket but as a female with no pockets I kept the keys in my handbag. I copped an additional 20 seconds of rain as I fumbled in my bag for the keys. Eventually I was in the car with the door closed. I sighed with relief.<br />
<br />
I drove to Sarah&#39;s. She was home. I parked as close to her door as I could. I then reached across and tried to put on my trench coat. I soon learned this is difficult to do when you are sitting in a car. Eventually I got my arms in, then braved the rain and walked to her door. <br />
She had heard me coming and opened before I could knock &quot;Come in Jenna. I see you have got wet. Don&#39;t worry Biddy is out the back. He won&#39;t jump on you&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wasn&#39;t ready for the weather. It&#39;s a lot easier running in the rain when you are male - Unless you’re a transvestite&quot;<br />
<br />
She laughed &quot;Come through to the bathroom. I&#39;ll lend you my dryer&quot;<br />
<br />
I was wet but not dirty. I used her diffuser to dry my hair then the dryer in my dress. I redid my make-up and called out &quot;Are you ready to go?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep just waiting for you&quot; I walked out to the lounge. She had changed from her work skirt and shirt into jeans, a cardigan and sneakers. &quot;What are you looking shocked about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well. I&#39;m all dressed up and you’re just wearing ordinary clothes&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So? We are only going to the pub&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think I&#39;m overdressed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all. Remember I&#39;m currently a grieving widow. It&#39;s a bit too early for me to be out man hunting&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose so&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You on the other hand are Jenna. It would be out of character for you not to be dressed up. As a matter of fact I have an amber necklace that would look really nice with that outfit. Let me fetch it&quot;<br />
<br />
She went to her room and came back with a necklace that she placed around my neck. She also had two large sturdy umbrellas. &quot;Take one and keep it. It was Rod&#39;s. Much more functional than what you came with&quot; She gestured towards the mini umbrella I had bought from the car with me. &quot;Come on let&#39;s go. Are you happy to drive?&quot;<br />
<br />
I took out my car keys, put my handbag across my body and the trench coat on top. I told Sarah &quot;Let&#39;s go&quot; I opened my new umbrella and went out the door, pressing the button to unlock the car. As quickly as possible I was in the car with Sarah beside me.<br />
I dropped Sarah at the door of the Royal, then parked as close as possible myself. I hurried out of the rain. Sarah was waiting just inside the door. Zach had sent her a text while we were driving to say he and Amanda were in the lounge. I folded my umbrella and we walked through to the lounge. <br />
<br />
Zach and Amanda were sitting at a table. We walked towards them. They stood up as we approached. Amanda came and gave us each a cheek kiss &quot;Hi girls&quot; I noticed she was also in jeans and a simple blue top.<br />
<br />
Zach gave Sarah a kiss and a nod to me &quot;Hi ladies. Would you like a drink? My shout&quot; <br />
<br />
Sarah replied &quot;Thanks Zach. A white wine for me&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Same for me thanks&quot; I said<br />
<br />
There was a fire in the room and it was warm, so I took off my coat before sitting down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice outfit&quot; said Amanda &quot;I love the beads. Are they amber?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, they are Sarah&#39;s. She loaned them to me when I picked her up&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I just thought they would go with that dress&quot; commented Sarah<br />
<br />
Zach came back with a beer and 3 white wines.  &quot;Are you heading out somewhere later Jenna?&quot;<br />
<br />
I was puzzled by the question &quot;I have no plans. I thought we might be having dinner here&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh sorry. It&#39;s just you seem dressed up, nail polish, jewellery&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is what I wore to work&quot; Was he criticising me?<br />
<br />
I sipped my wine in silence. Zach asked Sarah about Rod&#39;s house. What was going to happen to it? Sarah replied that they had transferred to ownership into joint names before Rod&#39;s accident but she needed to talk to Rod&#39;s lawyer. <br />
<br />
Amanda told me that her boutique were bringing in new winter fashions and might be putting some of the summer styles on sale soon. She would let me know when would be a good time to visit.<br />
<br />
Sarah asked whether we were going to eat here. Zach replied the weather was too lousy to think about going anywhere else. I volunteered to go and get some menus<br />
<br />
I felt Zach&#39;s eyes on me as walked up to the counter where the menus were. I think he was critical of me for being so girly. What did he want me to do? Become a butch lesbian?<br />
<br />
I picked up 4 menus and returned to the table. I found I couldn&#39;t look at Zach. I was embarrassed by what I was.<br />
<br />
I choose a calamari dish for dinner and we all went up and paid for our own meals, well Zach actually paid for Amanda&#39;s.<br />
<br />
I returned to the table and finished sipping my drink. I felt like getting drunk but had driven so knew I should only have one more drink for the night. Sarah came back and said &quot;It&#39;s my turn to buy drinks. What would I like?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Just a lemonade. I have to drive&quot; She went over to the bar.<br />
<br />
Zach and Amanda came back together. &quot;You seem a bit down tonight Jenna. Is everything alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing serious. Just sometimes being a woman is hard&quot; I purposefully looked at Zach as I made that last statement.<br />
<br />
Sarah came back with a tray of drinks. I took my lemonade. I was pretty silent as the others talked about what they had planned for the weekend. Zach and Amanda were off to the movies tomorrow and Sarah said she had no real plans other than Pilate’s tomorrow morning. She needed to start sorting through Rod&#39;s belongings and invited Zach and Amanda around on Sunday to see if there was anything of Rod&#39;s he could use. She invited me to come around as well. We could have a barbeque.<br />
<br />
A waitress bought our meals out. Zach had a large steak. I would have had the same if I was male, but this body just didn&#39;t have the appetite.<br />
<br />
Amanda asked did I have anything on over the weekend. I told them I had been invited to a work colleagues 21st birthday and where the party was been held. Zach asked if I was planning to have a big night. I didn&#39;t bother to reply.<br />
<br />
We finished our meals and Zach suggested &quot;How about we have a game of pool?&quot; We had often played pool at this pub. There were two tables in the front bar. When I was Zach I had a fierce rivalry with Rod at pool. We were pretty evenly matched. When we took the girls here Rod would team up with Sarah and I would play with Amanda.  &quot;Do you know the rules Jenna?&quot; I took that as a personal slight<br />
<br />
We walked into the front bar. We girls placed our bags, umbrellas and my coat on a table in the corner while Zach racked up the balls. We agreed I would play with Sarah. He said I could break.<br />
<br />
It was different playing pool as a female. I was very aware that I was extending a heel clad leg out behind me whenever I had to lean over the table. I could feel all the men in the bar watching me, not necessarily for my pool shots. I was also aware of my breasts dangling, my dress was not particularly low cut, but when I leaned over the table I was exhibiting a lot of cleavage. However I had lost none of my skills and regularly potted balls. The 1st game came down to both teams being on the black. Zach potted a long shot to win. I immediately said &quot;Best of 3&quot;<br />
<br />
We won the second game with Zach and Amanda having one coloured ball left. The 3rd game went to the wire again unfortunately my cue ball ricocheted into a pocket when we were both on the black. Zach and Amanda were the winners.<br />
<br />
Evidently I had gathered quite an audience. 3 different blokes challenged me and Sarah or me alone. They offered to buy us drinks. Sarah said we should get going. Zach was looking pretty pleased with himself.<br />
<br />
We gathered our belongings, I put my coat on, said goodbye and left. The rain had eased to a light drizzle. Once in the car. I set off back to Sarah&#39;s. &quot;You seemed a bit down tonight&quot; commented Sarah.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was. I don&#39;t think Zach approves of his best mate wearing dresses and heels&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It did sound a bit like that&quot; she admitted &quot;He will have to get used to it. You are female now&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think he would be happier if I was a fat and ugly lesbian&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well unfortunately for him you are not. You will both have to learn how to cope&quot;<br />
<br />
I dropped her off at her door and made arrangements to meet her at the gym for Pilates in the morning. Before she left I unclipped the necklace and gave it back to her. &quot;Thanks for the loan. They are very nice&quot; <br />
<br />
I drove home. Mum was lying on the couch with her head in Dad&#39;s lap watching a movie. I said good night and left them alone. I prepared for bed and read a couple more chapters about Charlotte. The Captain and ship had left on another voyage but she had been left on the island to be lady of the fortress. At least she had her dowry box and wardrobe that she had been transporting to her new home in Scotland. Her Captain had seen that all her belongings were kept intact and transferred to her new quarters. Her maid Jane had somehow got to go on the voyage as the 1st mate’s mistress. She was now alone and couldn&#39;t speak the language. The house keeper pretended not to understand her and was making her very frustrated. She could do nothing but wait for the return of her Captain ensconced in the lord’s rooms of the fortress.</p>
