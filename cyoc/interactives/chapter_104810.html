<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After parting company at the diner with Eric Anderson and the Stovall ladies, Ben Twist held the passenger side door of his car open for Kenya Adaeze, who smiled at her boyfriend as she got in.<br />
Once he was inside and their seat belts were on, Ben turned to Kenya and asked, &quot;Would you like to go out to the Halloween Dance with me next Saturday?&quot;<br />
&quot;I will need to know more about it, but certainly,&quot; said Kenya with a smile. &quot;Yet, what about the rest of this date?&quot;<br />
&quot;There&#39;s someplace special I want to take you tonight,&quot; he said, starting the car.<br />
<br />
Soon, Kenya was recognizing landmarks as Ben found a public parking spot for the night in one of Moon Lake&#39;s many parks. After holding the door open for Kenya so she could get out, Ben went around to his trunk.<br />
Curious, Kenya watched him pull out a box of stuff, along with a cooler.<br />
Balancing the load with one hand, Ben took Kenya by the hand and lead her into the woods.<br />
Soon Kenya realized exactly where they were as they approached the fallen log where they first met.<br />
&quot;I hope you don&#39;t mind being here, but ever since we&#39;ve met, I think of this as the most romantic spot in Moon Lake,&quot; said Ben, as he sat his load down.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m flattered, my werewolf, but what did you have in mind?&quot; she asked, as he took out an old but clean blanket from the box and spread it across the ground near the base of the log.<br />
&quot;Just to spend a romantic night with the woman I love,&quot; he answered, blushing a bit as he raised his right hand to scratch the back of his head to express the nervous tic he had.<br />
Soon Kenya watched him set up a couple of pillows and a battery powered radio that he tuned it to a Seattle station that played music for lovers on Saturday nights.<br />
Ben Twist kicked off his shoes and socks, sat down on the blanket with his back against the log, and motioned for Kenya Adaeze to do the same.<br />
<br />
With her now barefoot next to him, Ben took the liberty of putting his arm around Kenya, to which she did not object.<br />
&quot;Now then, to answer your previous question. On Halloween the town holds a big dance for everyone. You can either attend in just your fursona, or wear a costume with or without displaying your were-ness. I&#39;m not sure how the day is going to go next weekend between you having to work while I&#39;ll be escorting my moms to attend a friend&#39;s wedding that morning, but I figured we could certainly have a good time that night...&quot; he said with a smile.<br />
&quot;I am not much of a dancer, but as long as I am with you,&quot; replied Kenya, snuggling closer against him.<br />
<br />
Ben paused to enjoy the moment before saying, &quot;This may sound corny, but other than being adopted by Samantha and Frances, you&#39;re the best thing that has ever happened to me Kenya,&quot; he began, trying to work up the nerve to say what he wanted to. &quot;Someday, I truly want to make our relationship a lot more permanent than it is now, but I just wanted to let you know that I really love you and look forward to the day when we can officially spend the rest of our lives together.&quot;<br />
Then he gently kissed her cheek.<br />
&quot;I love you too Benjamin Twist, but are you asking me to marry you?&quot; wondered Kenya.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m letting you know that someday I intend to ask that, but for now all I can do is promise to and express my love for the beautiful lady before me in the meantime.&quot;<br />
&quot;And this beautiful lady loves her handsome suitor, and looks forward to spending the rest of her life with him too,&quot; she answered, before they kissed.<br />
At first everything was slow and romantic, but soon the lovers felt the fires of passion begin to burn.<br />
<br />
Gently, Ben unbuttoned Kenya&#39;s top, exposing the lacy bra underneath.<br />
Kenya just smiled and purred encouragement as he lovingly caressed her breasts. First while they were still inside the bra, and then after he removed the undergarment.<br />
He tenderly teased, licked, and suckled each dark chocolate nipple at the end of her full mocha colored breasts. Enjoying the moment and taking his own sweet time to show his love for her. Thanks to his previous experiences with Kenya, Ben knew passion could be just as romantic as it could be quite enjoyable sexually.<br />
Kenya finished removing her blouse as Ben kissed his way up from her knees to under her thigh covered skirt.<br />
She felt him sniffing against the matching panties to the lacy bra, but then sensed them being moved out of the way to allow Ben to experience the tasty treat between her legs.<br />
Kenya started to moan in pleasure, even as she felt the werepanthress fur begin to spread out across her body.<br />
Claws dug into the old blanket and the ground beneath as furry legs wrapped themselves around Ben to keep him in place, despite the fact he was not dumb enough to leave the pleasures he was tasting and the joy he was giving her in return.<br />
It wasn&#39;t long before the werepanthress also known as Kenya Adaeze growled, announcing the first of many orgasms she would have that night.<br />
<br />
When Ben&#39;s head finally emerged from between her legs, the werepanthress hastily removed the last of her human clothing as she saw her boyfriend lick his lips.<br />
&quot;One of us is seriously overdressed my love,&quot; she purred, as Kenya sat up.<br />
Feline paws began opening his belt buckle and pants as Ben started removing his shirt.<br />
Soon the male before her was totally nude too as the werepanthress claimed her prey, licking and sucking the hardening cock between Ben&#39;s legs.<br />
But his first orgasm of the night would not be created orally, as she gently pushed him against the blanket before mounting him in a dominant position.<br />
Ben smiled as he felt his werewolf being released.<br />
The werepanthress let out an even louder moan as his human cock stretched and fulled her as his lupine red rocket grew to its full length.<br />
Ben&#39;s furry paws reached out to massage Kenya&#39;s breasts, before she leaned forward and allowed him to suckle at her teats.<br />
A cold, wet nose brushed against her fur as each breast was orally worshiped by a werewolf muzzle.<br />
Kenya took her time riding Ben, extending the pleasure for both of them until it reached a point neither could control themselves any more.<br />
Soon the werewolf howled and his werepanthress growled in unison as they experienced the first of what would be a multitude of mutual satisfactory experiences that night.</p>
