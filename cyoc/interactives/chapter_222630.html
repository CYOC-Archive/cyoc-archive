<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A serene serene Ile stretched across Mary Elise&#39;s face as she gazed out into the student parking lot. For the young teacher it had proven to be a very eventful summer.<br />
<br />
After years of waiting, Sebastián had finally asked her to marry him. Mary chuckled as she thought about it, the pair had been dating since high school and most of their friends were married with children. Sebastián though wanted to wait until he was done with school and had a job of his own. Now, with a position as a professor at a small school established, he felt it was the right time to propose.<br />
<br />
It struck Mary as odd that in a way they were doing things somewhat backwards. Before the close of the school year Amara had moved into the couples condo. The arrangement was at first thought to be temporary, however, Mary quickly took a liking to the fear demon. By July she asked Amara if she would like to make Mary and Sebastián home permanent. Amara of course agreed, the trio finding the living arrangement positive. Still, it struck everyone by surprise when Sebastián and Mary formally adopted Amara. Despite some initial worries about adopting a teenage fear demon, Amara was proving to be a welcomed addition to Sebastián and Mary&#39;s lives, even surprising the pair when she took Sebastián (and soon to be Mary&#39;s) last name of Kane.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enjoying the view?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary Elise turned in her wheelchair, gazing at a rather nervous looking Asian woman. &quot;Just enjoying the scenery before the start of the day,&quot; she sighed happily. &quot;Is this your first day? You seem nervous..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Michelle,&quot; she replied anxiously. &quot;Michelle Wong and yeah, first day. I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t catch your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary Elise McKinnon well soon to be Kane.&quot; Mary now held up her hand, showing Michelle the small engagement ring Sebastián had given her. Michelle now gushed, congratulating Mary Elsie as the pair smiled at one another. &quot;So Agent Wong,&quot; Mary Elise smirked after a short pause. &quot;Why has S.P.E.A.R sent you into this school?&quot;<br />
<br />
Michelle paled, trying to stammer an answer. How had this woman known who she was or even the existence of S.P.E.A.R? This operation was supposed to be classified and no one was to know her true identity. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I think you have me mistaken.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I doubt it,&quot; Mary smirked. Michelle now cooked her head, curiously gazing at the grinning auburn haired woman. &quot;Psychic,&quot; Mary stated, pointing to her temple. &quot;I scanned your mind when you walked in the room. Plus, Director McMillan stated she would be sending you here in an undercover role. Apparently, considering the reputation of the town, she thought it would be prudent to have an agent available in an observational role at school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Michelle replied sheepishly rubbing the back of her neck. &quot;And she thought I would thrive in this environment. I was always more comfortable in a school setting.&quot; Mary nodded, studying the woman carefully as she sorted through her memories. &quot;Top of your class at Princeton,&quot; she said softly. &quot;Graduated early, stellar evaluations at the academy, but you worry Director McMillan doesn&#39;t have alot of faith in you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michelle balked, avout ask how Mary knew this before remembering the teacher was Psychic. &quot;Do you mind not reading my thoughts,&quot; she groaned. &quot;Its kind of weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Mary chuckled. &quot;But you thoughts are practically screaming at this point. I&#39;m doing the best I can to not read them. Are you that nervous about your first day?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Terrified,&quot; Michelle sighed. &quot;School may have come easy to me but I didn&#39;t exactly fit in when I was in high school. Just being back in one is bringing up alot if really bad memories.&quot; Mary nodded, remembering all to well the social structure of high school. Thankfully she had plenty of close friends in her time, yet it appeared Michelle hadn&#39;t been so fortunate. &quot;You&#39;ll do fine Agent Wong,&quot; Mary reassured. &quot;And I&#39;d you need any help I&#39;m always here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I should be thanking you,&quot; Mary smirked. &quot;I&#39;m no longer the youngest teacher on staff.&quot; The pair now shared a small laugh, continuing to watch students enter the high school school. &quot;So anything in particular S.P.E.A.R is on the lookout for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just anything out of the ordinary,&quot; Michelle shrugged. &quot;Although they do want me to investigate one student in particular. A new boy that moved here recently. Travis Reaver, do you know him?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary nodded, she had heard about him from Amara but, had yet to meet the boy. All she had was general information, he was a nice guy, was dating Ann O&#39;Tooles adopted daughter, and he was the child of two very powerful parents. &quot;Yes I&#39;ve heard of him,&quot; Mary stated. &quot;Maybe you can help me then,&quot; Michelle said quickly. &quot;Considering the high volume of supernatural beings in the area we&#39;ve monitored families that move into town. We did a background check on family. The Reavers and their son Travis, we can&#39;t find anything on him or his family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve met him,&quot;  Mary stated. &quot;You don&#39;t have anytime to worry about him.Travis is probably the most polite teenage boy I&#39;ve ever seen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the families?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary smirked, giving Michelle a coy look as the agent anxiously stared at her. &quot;I&#39;m curious what you think,&quot; she said with a wink. &quot;I&#39;m pretty sure your agency has a pretty good idea. Am I right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Michelle fidgeted, her agency did have an idea. They suspected the Reavers were supernatural in nature but couldn&#39;t quite decipher what. Michelle though had a theory. &quot;Okay if I tell you what I know can you confirm&quot; she said quickly. &quot;I mean consideing you can read my mind I guess secrecy is out the window.&quot; Mary simply nodded,  Michelle taking a deep breath before continuing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think the Reavers aren&#39;t supernatural. I think they&#39;re different. Something, I don&#39;t know, primordial in nature.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really,&quot; Mary replied, raising an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes really,&quot; Michelle stated. &quot;Look, this is going to sound nuts but I started going through records. Pictures, documents, anything I could to try and get  any information on the family. Travis, he has a birth certificate but the parents? Its like they appeared out of nowhere. And get this, I ran their pictures through a database. Those images appear numerous times over a period stretching back to the first photos ever taken. That&#39;s almost 200 years!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It could be relatives.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was an exact match,&quot; Michelle exclaimed. &quot;I scanned them through the computer, the images 100% match their pictures. And it&#39;d even crazier I went back further looking for evidence. I found paintings, sculptures, even ancient drawings from civilizations such as the Greeks, the Mayans, hell even in Scandinavian and Middle Eastern tribes. All the pictures look the same as the photo IDs they used when they purchased their home. I...I think they might be some sort of deity.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary Elise nodded, obviously Michelle had done her homework and she was close. &quot;You&#39;re close,&quot; she replied, not wanting to leave Michelle in a lurch. &quot;But they&#39;re not deities. They&#39;re actually embodiments of natural forces.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Natural forces? What natural forces?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Life and Death,&quot; Mary stated, causing Michelle to balk. &quot;Yes I didn&#39;t believe it either but it&#39;s true. Travis&#39;s parents are something far beyond anything anyone has ever seen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what does that make Travis?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s human,&quot; Mary replied. &quot;But with a couple of extra gifts thrown in from his parents. Just know he&#39;s a decent kid so don&#39;t freak out on him or have your people take him into custody or whatever psi ops thing the government does.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Michelle stammered. &quot;So what should I do then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Enjoy the school year,&quot; Mary smiled. &quot;And get to know your students. You&#39;re going to be in for quite an experience.&quot;</p>
