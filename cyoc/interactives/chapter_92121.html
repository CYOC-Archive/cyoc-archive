<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The party began winding down, the various teams of rubber balloon creatures gradually coming down from the high of the party, Casper&#39;s question and Ashley&#39;s answer.<br />
<br />
There were no more noise complaints after the two police, now Synthetics, delivered their warning and went on their way, as the group did manage to reign in their rowdyness.<br />
<br />
The pair of latex creatures said their goodbyes and began to make their way home.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry to spring that on you, Ashley,&quot; Casper said, &quot;but I really do want to spend the rest of my life with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do too, Casper,&quot; she replied.<br />
<br />
They stopped midway down the street, hugging each other tightly, their rubber bodies squeaking together softly in the quiet hours of the night.  His lips met hers, arms wrapping around her waist, as hers reached up to wrap around his neck, one hand reaching up to rub over his shiny horns and to squeak along an ear.<br />
<br />
The two of them stopped at a convenience store, buying a small bag of styrofoam packing peanuts to snack on, the clerk scanning the barcode on Casper&#39;s rump, before he made a gesture and the clerk became a shiny orange and purple tiger-man, Synthetic and naked just like them, only a vest and a name tag to show his once human state.  He bore a barcode just like them, and lacked visible genitalia, like them, nozzle in place of a navel and mold lines sported about his form.<br />
<br />
As they clopped and padded up to Casper&#39;s apartment, and went inside, Ashley spoke again.<br />
<br />
&quot;We really ought to visit Haeliax tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I agree,&quot; Casper said.<br />
<br />
The two of them proceeded to get ready for bed, Ashley hung up her scarf on the bathroom door, as something caught her eye.<br />
She walked into the bathroom, and came back out with a bottle in her hand, the label declaring it to be latex cleaner and polisher.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s this?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where did that come from?&quot; the latex ram asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was in the shower...do you think it could have changed from shampoo when you changed yourself into a Synthetic?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; was his reply.<br />
<br />
She smiled at him, impishly, and vanished back into the bathroom.  The door opened several minutes later, and Casper had to pick his jaw up from the floor.<br />
Ashley had applied the polish to herself, her rubber skin positively gleaming, the light playing over every inch, highlighting every curve.  She sauntered up to the ram, handing him the bottle and a washcloth, then playfully swatting him on the butt.  &quot;Your turn,&quot; she said, winking.<br />
<br />
Casper blinked a few times, then stumbled into the bathroom.  He looked himself over in the mirror, thinking that perhaps he could use a polish.  It only felt slightly odd and amusing to him that the thought occurred so naturally to him.  He popped the cap off the bottle and applied some of the clear liquid to the washcloth, carefully placed the bottle down, and began to apply the polish to his chest.<br />
He marveled at how shiny it made his latex skin, and felt good too, like putting lotion on dry hands when he was human.  He polished his chest and down one arm, switched to the other, polished his face, ears and horns, the back of his neck, then drifted down to polish his stomach, blushing a bit when he brushed over his nozzle, but not when he polished over the bulge at his crotch.  Each leg and hoof was polished in turn, as was his rear, the cleft betwixt and the short tail above it.  He managed to get his back without too much trouble.  He looked over his newly shined body, liking what he saw and feeling good.  He placed the bottle back on the shelf of the shower, folded the washcloth and hung it up, and moved to open the bathroom door.<br />
<br />
It was Ashley’s turn to pick her jaw up off the bed as she saw Casper’s shined red and purple form, gleaming horns and hooves and all.  He moved over to the bed, squeaking softly as he did, looking over his fiancé´; she was reclined on the bed, tail laying seductively over her leg, one arm propping her up and the other draped over her hip.  She crawled over to him as he neared the bed, looking him up and down.<br />
<br />
“Wow,” was all she could muster.<br />
<br />
She reached up to run her hands over his shiny body, and it felt good when she did.  He bent down to kiss her again. <br />
<br />
“Casper, make love to me,” she said softly as the kiss broke, “I’ve wanted to for a while…but you probably knew that.”<br />
<br />
Casper began to say that he wanted to wait until after marriage, but given that he had just proposed, and he had no intention of going back on his commitment, and he was pretty sure Ashley wouldn’t either, he stopped himself.<br />
<br />
“I’ve wanted to also, Ashley,” he started again, “but I’m not sure how…to be honest.”<br />
<br />
She smiled, “Me neither, but lets just do what feels right.”<br />
<br />
“Are you really sure you want to do this?  I mean, we could get pregnant.” He offered.<br />
<br />
“I know,” was her reply, “but I’ve already agreed to be your wife, and yes, I am really sure.”<br />
<br />
Her hand was rubbing over his chest, but she stopped, as if to seek permission to continue.<br />
Casper thought for a moment, she was right, she did agree, and he was not forcing her to do this, it was her choice.  His choice as well, he realized.  If he wanted to wait, he was sure Ashley would respect his decision.  He leaned in and kissed the bright green lizard-girl again, wrapping his arms around her and hugging her to him, feeling the slickness of the polish on her, the soft squeak of their bodies pressing together.<br />
<br />
She pulled at him, and the two of them slid onto the bed, as their lips parted, Casper all but whispering “I love you.”  Ashley responded in kind, guiding him down to lay on the bed, slipping one leg over his and straddling Casper’s hips, the bulge of his crotch rubbing and pressing against the smooth spot between her legs.  It felt good, but not much more than holding hands.  Casper reached up to caress her featureless breasts, and she exhaled, closing her eyes.<br />
<br />
“Mmm, nice, but that doesn’t do much more than touching my arms or back…” she said.<br />
<br />
Opening her eyes, she looked into his, hands reaching up to his, gently guiding them down, lower and lower, guiding Casper’s hand to the nozzle on her stomach.  As his thick fingers rubbed over her nozzle, she shivered and gasped, making a squeak.<br />
<br />
“Does that feel good?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“Let me show you,” she replied, rolling off of him and to the side, turning him to her, as her own lithe, nimble fingers played over his chest, gliding down to rub over his own nozzle.<br />
<br />
Casper let out a low moan, the contact making tendrils of tingling energy radiate through his body.  He had played with himself a few times when he was human, this felt remarkably similar, but ten times as good.  He arched his back, pressing up into Ashley’s hand, pulling her into another kiss, her lips parted, rubber tongues teasing one another.  His three-fingered hand found her nozzle again, and mimicked her movements, rubbing, teasing, squeezing, until he felt her nozzle stiffen and pop proud of her stomach, followed shortly by his own.  He wondered, in the back of his mind, if this was the Synthetics version of an erection.  This thought, however, was replaced by another, a desire, a need to wrap his lips around that nozzle.  He wrapped his arms around her and rolled, bringing her on top of him, pulling her hips forward.  He positioned her straddling his stomach, his own nozzle situated pleasantly in the cleft of her buttocks, as she continued to undulate in pleasure at his teasing, their bodies squeaking against one another.<br />
<br />
“Oh, Casper,” she managed, “mmmm…”<br />
<br />
He continued his ministrations, finding the cap on Ashley’s nozzle starting to loosen, and in one right-feeling move, he popped it open, making her gasp-squeak again.  He could feel her do the same to his nozzle.<br />
<br />
He stopped for an instant, hesitant, and she looked at him, “Please, Casper.” she said, desire plain in her voice.  He bent forward, placing her nozzle in his mouth and began to blow.  Not fast, not hard, just steady, pushing air into his lizard fiancée.  The soft squeaks of their bodies, the slow hiss of his breath, her pleasured noises were like music to him.  <br />
<br />
“I can feel your breath, your warm breath…all over inside me…” Ashley moaned.<br />
<br />
After several breaths, he could hear the rubber of her body starting to creak, the air straining against her seams.  He wondered if Synthetics could pop, briefly thinking back to the kitten-girl who stepped on a shard of broken glass, none the worse for wear.  His musing was broken by Ashley’s voice.<br />
<br />
“Ah, Casper…no more…I feel like…I’m going to burst!” she cried, body spasming in pleasure.<br />
<br />
He lifted his head from her nozzle, and she rolled off of him, pulling him on top of her, grabbing his horns to pull his mouth to hers.  While deep in the kiss, they both felt the need to rub their bodies together, their nozzles rubbing against each other, sending waves of tingles and pleasure through both Synthetics. At their most frenzied moment, Casper felt a soft click, as the tip of Ashley’s nozzle seated within his own, and Ashley cried out in what could only be described as orgasmic pleasure. Casper could feel the air inside her flowing into himself, filling him.  He could feel his essence mingling with Ashley, like they were one soul.  In that instant, he could feel all her pleasure, all the sensations of her body, the pressure of the air inside her, pressing against her skin and seams, his arms around her, protective, his nozzle surrounding hers.  He could only hope she was also feeling him.<br />
<br />
The pressure of air equalized between them, and the feeling faded.  The two of them separated, panting, as Ashley gently pressed the cap on his nozzle closed, pushing on it gently to re-seat it in his navel, as he did the same for her, careful of how sensitive they both were, before hugging each other tightly.<br />
<br />
“Thank you,” said the rubber ram-man, and “thank you,” was the lizard-girl’s response.<br />
<br />
Ashley curled her tail around Casper’s legs and snuggled tightly against him, the evenings partying and recent efforts catching up to them, both drifting peacefully into the trance-like state that was their kind’s sleep.</p>
