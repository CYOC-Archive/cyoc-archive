<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hmm...&quot; thought Tracey to herself. &quot;I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll get along better if I made them the same age&quot;. She selected Ralph and Carlos and set both their ages to 20.<br />
<br />
The twenty-nine-year-old Ralph was the first to show visible signs of getting younger, as the bit of beer belly he&#39;d acquired began to deflate as he grew younger through his twenties. Carlos, who had lacked a beer belly, didn&#39;t seem to change at all at first, aside from a few weathered features on his skin here and there clearing up and smoothing over as with Ralph. Rather quickly where before had been pushing-thirty young adults, suddenly there were college age coeds, and their demeanor had completely changed as they were now equals in age to Rick and Emily.<br />
<br />
Ralph dropped the intimidation first, &quot;Look, I&#39;m glad you&#39;re having fun, dude, but save it for the bedroom - last thing you want is to get sunburn on your dick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You talk like you&#39;ve got experience with that,&quot; said Rick, covering his crotch with his hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Three words, Bahamian Nude Beach,&quot; said Carlos with a wink, which caused Ralph to shoot him a dirty look, and for Rick and Carlos to laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s nice, but can we get some privacy here?&quot; said Emily, covering her chest with her hands as she stepped into her bottoms. &quot;Just long enough to get dressed?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick stood defensively between his girlfriend and his friends, and Ralph and Carlos turned away with smirks on their faces. &quot;Sure thing&quot;, said Carlos, not without sneaking another quick glance in her direction.<br />
<br />
It was then that a new idea hit Tracey. “Hmm… Wonder what would happen if I change one of the husbands?” she asked herself. She turned her head back to the game and clicked on Carlos&#39; character, showing the many options on the menu. “This should be good”. Tracey said as she clicked on the gender icon, flipping it to Female. When she did that, she looked at the backyard next door to watch Carlos&#39; transformation.<br />
<br />
Almost immediately Carlos lost a few inches in height. The sudden drop in height made him gasp out loud, throwing him off-balance.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot; said Ralph with a grin. &quot;Getting light-headed? First time seeing a woman naked?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up&quot;, said Carlos and Emily in unison as Emily pulled her bikini top on.<br />
<br />
Next his frame started to diminish, as his muscles faded and his body slimmed down. Underneath his T-shirt his six-pack abs lost definition, smoothing out to leave a slightly toned midsection. At the same time the hair on his arms and chest thinned and retracted into his skin, giving him a more youthful look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I&#39;m done&quot;, said Emily as she stood up and stretched.<br />
<br />
&quot;Same&quot;, said Rick, adjusting the waistband on his swim trunks.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure took your time&quot;, said Ralph as he and Carlos turned around to face their friends. They still looked smug about having caught them. Something new was happening to Carlos though. His white T-shirt, once hanging loosely on him, was tightening, seemingly shrinking and clinging to him as its color darkened to a light blue. And his dark blue swim shorts were shrinking on him as well, slowly rising up his legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, maybe try to finish faster next time&quot;, said Carlos as Rick glared at him. Carlos&#39; voice was breaking, sounding more like a teenage boy&#39;s than a grown man&#39;s. And his increasingly clingy shirt made his metamorphosis even clearer. Tracey watched, fascinated and a bit turned on at the fact that she was watching a man turning into a woman right before her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are we doing now?&quot; said Ralph with a yawn.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s beer in the cooler if you want some&quot;, said Rick with a shrug.<br />
<br />
The nipples on Carlos&#39; chest started to grow and poke out under his tight shirt. Soon after, the flesh around his nipples began puffing out, forming little cones that were growing rapidly. The hair on his legs vanished as he became clean-shaven, followed by the rest of his body hair as his skin became smooth and hairless. The peach fuzz on his chin thinned and vanished without a trace. As his shirt continued darkening to blue and rising up his torso, exposing his flat midriff, his hips then flared out, giving him the start of a curvy figure. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mind getting me some?&quot; said Carlos to Ralph. As his Adam&#39;s apple vanished, his voice now sounded like a boy&#39;s, high and feminine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure!&quot; said Ralph, heading to the cooler.<br />
<br />
Carlos put his hands on his hips, standing in a rather feminine pose as they watched Ralph fetch beers. Their arms and legs slimmed visibly as they became more girlish. Their hands and feet shrank, becoming small and dainty, while their fingernails grew long and delicate. Their hips continued to spread, giving them an impressive hourglass figure, while her rear plumped out and filled out in turn, her tight blue shorts showing off its curves while her shirt - now a skintight crop top - showed off her breast buds.<br />
<br />
As Carlos&#39; masculinity grew more and more distant, the dynamics of the group started to change. Rick went to see what Ralph was doing, while Emily got up to chat with Carlos.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, so, uh, sorry about that&quot;, said Emily awkwardly. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fine, just get a room next time&quot;, said Carlos with a girlish giggle, her voice now the lilting soprano of an adult woman. Her face, already androgynous, grew more visibly feminine. Her nose thinned and grew a little smaller while her lips became puffier and developed a layer of lip gloss. Her eyes grew larger, more innocent and girlish, while her curly hair practically exploded and cascaded down her neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;So we&#39;re still friends?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Emily, oh my gosh! Of course!&quot; Carlos tossed her thick curly blonde hair over her shoulders, unconsciously arching her back as her breasts inflated like balloons. Her shirt, now the same dark blue as her shorts, morphed into a bikini top as her breasts filled it rapidly, while her shorts became a tight bikini bottom riding high on her hips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Also don&#39;t look now but I think Ralph has been staring at you&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, I don&#39;t have time to deal with this now...&quot; The curly-haired blonde rolled her eyes as she crossed her arms defensively. Tracey checked to see that her transformation had finished. She had turned out a few inches shorter than Emily, and a lot curvier, with DD-cup breasts barely contained by a rather skimpy dark blue bikini.<br />
<br />
&quot;Carla! Got your beer!&quot; said Ralph, striding over to the two women.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks&quot;, she said, taking it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do I get a kiss?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re just friends, Ralph&quot;, she said firmly, as Rick hugged Emily.<br />
<br />
Ralph shrugged and turned to Rick, while Carla walked over to Emily for safety. &quot;Some party this has been&quot;, he said. &quot;At least the beer&#39;s good&quot;.<br />
<br />
Tracey chuckled. This was fun! What could she do with the group of coeds at the pool now?</p>
