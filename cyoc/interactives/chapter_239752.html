<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You step out of the lake, the water streaming off your iridescent skin like liquid light. As you ascend the bank, your form begins to shift. The fin along your spine retracts smoothly into your back, the webbing between your fingers and toes dissolves like mist, and your gills seal shut. By the time your feet touch dry land, you appear almost human again—almost.  <br />
<br />
Your body still hums with power, your golden eyes gleaming with divine energy, your olive-toned skin radiant and smooth. Your muscles, honed to perfection, remain a testament to your new demigod heritage. Standing tall, your gaze sweeps the landscape, the world now a vivid tapestry of detail and sensation.  <br />
<br />
The lake and the clearing around it seem alive, pulsing with the same energy that courses through you. The ruins of the Greek temple loom in the distance, silent witnesses to your transformation. But this place, sacred as it is, cannot truly be your home.  <br />
<br />
“**You must claim this land, my son,**” Poseidon’s voice rumbles in your mind like the tide breaking against the shore. “**Build a haven worthy of your strength. Let the earth and sea answer your call.**”  <br />
<br />
Nodding, you raise the golden trident in your hand. Power flows through you, and with a single thought, the ground begins to stir. Rocks rise from beneath the soil, assembling themselves into sturdy walls. Logs from the nearby forest tumble forward, their bark smoothing and shaping into beams that interlock perfectly. Within minutes, a proud cabin stands before you, a blend of rustic charm and divine craftsmanship.  <br />
<br />
The cabin’s front faces the lake, its windows catching the glimmer of the water. A balcony juts out toward the clearing, offering a commanding view of your domain. Inside, the walls are adorned with carvings of waves and sea creatures, and the furniture seems grown from the earth itself, as if the forest lent its trees willingly for your comfort.  <br />
<br />
You step back, surveying your work. It feels right—strong, enduring, a reflection of your new purpose.  <br />
<br />
“**Well done, my child,**” Poseidon intones. “**Now, the sea calls you once more. Look to the coast. Someone approaches.**”  <br />
<br />
Turning, you see the distant figure of a man walking along the shoreline, not even questioning the magic that took you to the coast. He’s shirtless with a physique most appeasing to you, his tanned skin glowing under the sun, his movements casual as he strolls near the water’s edge. Something about him piques your interest—a flicker of curiosity, perhaps even a hint of desire.  <br />
<br />
Without hesitation, you stride toward the ocean, the trident pulsing in your hand. As your feet touch the water, you feel the shift begin again. The sea embraces you, and you welcome the transformation. Your legs fuse together seamlessly, forming a powerful tail adorned with shimmering scales that catch the sunlight. The fin along your spine unfurls, and your gills reopen, drawing in the life-giving water. Your human form melts away, replaced by the magnificent, mer-like shape of your underwater self.  <br />
<br />
Diving beneath the waves, you swim toward the man with effortless grace, the water parting before you like silk. As you draw closer, you slow your movements, letting your presence ripple outward. You call to him, not with words, but with something deeper—a melody that hums through the water and reaches his ears.  <br />
<br />
The man stops, his head tilting as though catching a distant tune. You surface a few feet away, your golden eyes locking with his. “Come,” you say, your voice rich and melodious.  <br />
<br />
He blinks, his lips parting in awe as he takes a hesitant step into the surf. “Who…what are you?” he asks, his voice trembling with both fear and wonder.  <br />
<br />
“Swim with me,” you say, holding out a hand. The trident gleams in the sunlight, its power a beacon that draws him closer.  <br />
<br />
He hesitates only for a moment before nodding. He wades into the water, deeper and deeper, until he’s waist-deep in the waves. You reach for him, your hand closing around his.  <br />
<br />
“Trust me,” you say, your voice low and soothing.  <br />
<br />
As you pull him into a deep kiss in the deeper water, the transformation begins. His breathing grows ragged, and his body shudders as Poseidon’s power flows through him. You hold him steady, watching as his legs fuse into a sleek, muscular tail. Scales emerge along his skin, their hue a deep, mesmerizing blue. His torso broadens, his muscles thickening and sharpening with divine precision.  <br />
<br />
He throws his head back, a groan escaping his lips as the changes wrack his body. “What…what’s happening?” he gasps, though his voice is filled more with pleasure than pain.  <br />
<br />
“You’re becoming one of us,” you say, your own voice tinged with awe. “A child of the sea.”  <br />
<br />
His arms grow stronger, his hands now tipped with claws like your own. His hair lengthens, darkening into thick, flowing waves that frame his chiseled face. His gills open along his neck, fluttering as he takes his first breath of water.  <br />
<br />
When the transformation ends, he floats before you, his newly-formed tail shimmering in the light. He gazes down at his body, a mixture of disbelief and exhilaration in his eyes.  <br />
<br />
“This…this feels incredible,” he says, his voice deep and resonant.  <br />
<br />
“It suits you,” you reply, a smile tugging at your lips.  <br />
<br />
He reaches out hesitantly, his fingers brushing against your chest. “You…you did this for me?”  <br />
<br />
“Yes,” you say simply.  <br />
<br />
Gratitude and wonder flood his expression, and he moves closer, his hands exploring the contours of your body. His touch is firm yet reverent, tracing the lines of your chest and shoulders before curving downwards towards your groin... he gently traces a finger up and down your slit until your mini trident exposes itself for him.<br />
<br />
He swiftly gets to work, wrapping his tongue around your length and starting to suck ravenously, immediately bringing you close to the edge... As he massages your muscles, a surge of energy pulses through you, reigniting the transformation you thought complete whilst blast upon blast from your mighty spear are drunk down by your seemingly hungry companion.<br />
<br />
Your body expands once more, the muscles swelling with renewed strength. Your chest broadens further, the ridges of your abdomen deepening into perfect symmetry. Your arms thicken, their veins pulsing visibly beneath your skin. Even your tail grows larger, the fin at its end spreading wide and majestic.  <br />
<br />
The sensation is euphoric, a crescendo of power and pleasure that leaves you breathless. When it finally subsides, you are bigger, stronger, more imposing than before. The man pulls back slightly, his eyes wide as he takes in your now-massive form, slowly wiping his mouth.<br />
<br />
“You’re…incredible,” he breathes.  <br />
<br />
“So are you,” you reply, your voice resonant with authority.  <br />
<br />
He smiles, a faint blush coloring his cheeks despite his new, godlike appearance. “My name is Kai,” he says after a moment.  <br />
<br />
“Kai,” you repeat, tasting the name. “I am Prince Tide of Atlantis and the Deep.”  <br />
<br />
“Prince Tide,” he says, the name rolling off his tongue like a prayer.  <br />
<br />
“**You have done well, my son,**” Poseidon’s voice rumbles in your mind, a wave of approval washing over you. “**Kai will be your companion, your ally. Together, you will rule the waters, guiding those who seek my favor and protecting the balance of the seas.**”  <br />
<br />
Kai looks at you, his expression a mixture of awe, desire and devotion. “What now?” he asks.  <br />
<br />
“Now,” you say, gripping your trident with renewed purpose, “we return to the oceans... There is much to learn, and many adventures to come.”  <br />
<br />
With that, you dive beneath the waves, Kai following close behind. The ocean welcomes you both, its vast expanse stretching out before you like an uncharted kingdom. And as you swim together, side by side, you feel the truth of Poseidon’s words: this is only the beginning.</p>
