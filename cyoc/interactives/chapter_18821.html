<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It's spring break and you're in your dorm room.  There's almost no one on campus and your whole floor, except R.A.'s room at the far end of the hall, is deserted.  Your roommate dropped out half way through the semester and you were informed that you wouldn't be getting another roommate so you have your dorm room to yourself.  Your roommate was a linebacker for the college team and left because his dad had died in a car crash, leaving him the only one to take care of his mom and younger brothers.  It was sad, but you weren't really that close to him.  He wasn't mean to you, but he wasn't particularly thrilled with sharing a room with a less than athletic guy.<br />
<br />
It's the day before you are to collect your stipend for the injections of the Ursus Magna formula and you've just stepped out of a hot shower.  You decide to take stock of the changes the formula has brought about over the last two weeks.  You go to your desk in the bedroom and get a ruler, a pencil and the tape measurer you bought for your ecology course which you used to measure small areas of fallow ground for study.<br />
<br />
You go back into the bathroom with your measuring devices and begin.  The hair on your head has completely grown over the bald spot and has grown out rather fast, but this is not what the ruler is for.<br />
<br />
You look at your beard.  It's gotten rather long in the last two weeks.  You haven't shaved since the injections and your beard is full, thick, bushy, high on your cheeks and connects down your neck to your new chest hair.  You're rather pleased with the way it looks and curious as to how fast it's growing.  You stretch out a few whiskers and measure them with the ruler from skin to the end of the hair and discover your beard has grown two inches in just two weeks.  Doing a quick mental calculation you realize that's over an 1/8th of an inch per day.  You're astonished by this; you'd heard there were men who could grow a beard at that rate, but no one you know can.  Even your hairy dad and you bald and hairy bearded older brother can't grow a beard to this length in a mere two weeks.  You conclude the formula has altered you to give you this new growth rate.<br />
<br />
You look in the full length mirror on the back of the bathroom door at your body.  You've grown taller, more muscular with just a little more fat and your endowment has increased in both length and girth.  Your body is covered in hair front to back and from your neck to your toes.  Two weeks ago you were smooth with just a patch of hair on your chest, now you look like a young version of your dad.<br />
<br />
You put your back to the door frame and put the pencil on the top of your head, marking the frame with your height.  You take out the tape and measure to the mark.  It reads 6' 2&quot;; last week you were 5'9&quot;… that's five inches taller!<br />
<br />
You then begin to jack yourself to bring about an erection.  You don't want to bring yourself to orgasm; yet, you just want to see how much growth you've gained since taking the Ursus Magna formula.  In a minute or so you're very hard, you sexual drives have increased as well.  You jacked off in the shower not ten minutes ago and you want to do it again, but you focus.  This is about measuring your changes, not self pleasure.  You put the ruler to Mr. Happy to see how tall the boy has grown in the last two weeks.  You measure almost nine inches and considering you were an average six before, that's an amazing change.  Your cock has also grown thicker; you're not the legendary 'beer can' thick, but it's probably half again as wide as it was before.  A quick grope of your balls tells you they've also grown.  If someone were to call you 'Bear Balls' it wouldn't be a joke.<br />
<br />
Finally, you consider your weight gain.  You have been eating a bit more than you usually do, but not excessively.  You consider you've been eating about half again as much as you did two weeks ago.  You've got a bit of a beer belly, but you can tell you've gained LOTS of muscle too.  Looking in the mirror you realize that no one would think you were a seventeen year old college freshman anymore.  You've filled out to a man's size and men your age usually don't have thick beards and back hair.<br />
<br />
You step onto the scale and it stops at 235 lbs.  The last time you were weighed, at the office where you got the injections, you were 195 lbs.  That's forty pounds, twenty pounds a week!  No wonder nothing but your sweats have fit since last week and the ones you wore today were riding up on you and straining around your new bulk.  Your former roommate was a big guy and you remember he left behind a set of sweats in your hamper.  You had washed them and put them in a box with a lamp of his with the intention of sending them on, but since he never contacted you after he left and the university wouldn't give you his home address, they've sat in the box waiting for you to throw them out. <br />
<br />
You go to the bedroom and fish the larger sweats out of the closet.  You're sure they'll fit and decide to wear them tomorrow when you go to collect your stipend… after that, that money is going into the bank and you're going clothes shopping.<br />
<br />
You click off the lights and climb into bed, naked.  Teasing your cock before the mirror has filled you with the need for release.  You masturbate, thinking about your sexy new masculine body, and just as you reach mind blowing orgasm you picture Doc McArt looking very much like you do, but older.  As you clean up with a towel, you consider that the formula might have made you bisexual… if not gay, but this is something that would be hard to talk to the Doc about when he asks about changes tomorrow.<br />
<br />
<br />
You get up and dress in the larger sweats which are just a bit roomy.  You head over to the office for your final examination and to pick up your stipend.  $5,000. will certainly be nice to have sitting in your bank account.<br />
<br />
You wait, like last time.  You're shown into the exam room and then Doc McArt comes in.  He's got a clipboard, digital camera and his stethoscope.  You notice the doc has a full head of hair now and his salt and pepper beard seem bushier and longer.  He's bigger than you remember too.  It seems the formula is working just as well on him as it is on you.<br />
<br />
He smiles and offers you a hairy meaty hand.  You clasp his with your own hairy meaty hand and exchange greetings.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Jones, what changes have you noticed since you took the Ursus Magna formula?&quot; he asks.<br />
<br />
There's something about him, something about his scent and his look that's causing you to get a hard-on.  You think about your changes and about how you had thoughts about the Doc last night.  You begin telling him about the inventory you took of your body last night and your findings.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very impressive.&quot; Doc McArt says in a distracted sort of way.  He looks at you with what you think might be sexual hunger and then says, &quot;OK, let's take some pictures of that former bald spot of yours and then you can pick up your check from Judy at the reception desk.  Please, bend your head down.&quot;<br />
<br />
You do as the Doc says and as you do you notice the Doc's pants are tented out with a rather large erection and he seems to be wetting his pants with pre-come.<br />
<br />
You suspect that you're giving the Doc the same hard-on he's giving you.  His body is close to you and you breath in the mixture of male musk and aftershave and it's making you tingle with lust.  Your cock is painfully hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, Mr. Jones, this concludes the test.&quot;  The Doc says.<br />
<br />
You look up just in time to see that he's checking out your package.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there something you'd like to tell me, Mr. Jones?&quot; Doc McArt says with that same hunger in his voice that you noticed earlier in his eyes.<br />
<br />
You're very turned on by this bearish man.  You decide to just tell him…</p>
