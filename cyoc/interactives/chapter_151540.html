<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lowering his head sadly, he asked his sister dejectedly why she was doing this to him. Did he really deserve to be treated this way?<br />
<br />
&quot;No. You weren&#39;t a bad brother. It&#39;s just that, this is my witching day and you were born specifically to be offered up as a sacrifice for my first human-to-animal transformation!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What!? What will mom and dad say when they find me missing? Find me like this!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, they already know! We had your new species already picked out the day you were born! They also picked out a buyer for you a week ago as well. He&#39;s expecting a fully-grown, strong, male jackass to work his fields. Not too young, because he wanted to save money. Young, virile, male donkeys are really expensive. But middle-aged over weight male donkeys command a cheaper price.<br />
<br />
Your owner will be an Amish man who doesn&#39;t use modern technologies. Instead, he uses beasts of burden like you&#39;ll soon be, in order to plow his endlessly huge fields. Hundreds and hundreds of acres.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan couldn&#39;t believe what he was hearing! They had this all planned out for him for the past 14 years!? They treated him like a normal child!? All those birthday and Christmas presents!? All of that schooling!? Schooling! He worked hard at school and earned all those good grades for nothing!? And all the while, his parents faking their pride in him, encouraging him; teaching him about how important his grades will be in the future! Now all hell ever be, is a donkey plowing fields for an unknown Amish family!? Never to use that hardwork ever again!? He&#39;ll never see his school, his friends, his classmates!? <br />
<br />
His friends! He was supposed to go on a camping trip with them next week! And his parents gave him permission to go, knowing he would never be able to go in the first place! Knowing full-well they already sold him to plow fields for the Amish! Just pretending like they&#39;ve done all along! He isn&#39;t going on this fun camping trip! They&#39;ll be going without him, while he&#39;s stuck on all fours munching on grass and hauling a plow endlessly up and down hundreds and hundreds of acres of farm land! <br />
<br />
This started making him angry and he started lashing out at his sister. But then, as he was about to raise a fist, his neck started awquardly growing longer. He could feel his jaw muscles growing stronger on the sides of his face, and he instantly got a splitting headache. His molars started to painfully uproot themselves. His sinuses felt like they were on fire! <br />
<br />
He slumped down on his haunches, holding his head in excruciating pain. His throat was getting soar, and he started whimpering and crying. <br />
<br />
The pain began to be so unbearable, he had to sit his furry ass down on the wet grass and mud. His moans started becoming slightly deeper and sharper at the same time. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Oh! Oh! My head! My teeth! What the fuck!? Oh! Oh! Ooohhhh!!! *Deep breath in: hhhhuuuuuuhhhhh*.....*Deep breath out: hhhhhhaaaaaaa*.... *In: hhhuuuuhhhhh* .......*out: hhhhhaaaaa*<br />
*In: HHHEEEEEEEEEE*....Out: hhhhhaaaaww*<br />
<br />
Hhheeeee hhhaawwwww hhaaaaeee hhhaaaaeww.<br />
<br />
Voice getting deeper:<br />
Eeerrrrgghhh HHHHAAAWWWWW eeerrrrgghhh hhhaawwww. Eeerrrrgghhh hhhaaww eeeerrggghhh hhhaawwww eeerrrrgghhh hhhhaaawww!<br />
<br />
His skull structure completely reshaping, the donkey sounds he was slowly beginning to make went unnoticed by him. He just kept saying; &quot;oh, oh, my head! It hurts!&quot; with each breath getting more and more sounding like a jackass as his neck continued to grow, his diaphragm shrinking deep in his insides so he will be unable to talk ever again, and his donkey vocal cords getting larger, yet less capable or forming very many sounds. <br />
<br />
His body began to puff up. Getting larger. Gaining more muscle and fat, in order to accommodate his larger neck. As this was happening, he fell back on his back, and rolled over onto his left side, gripping his growing, painful skull with his still-very-human hands. <br />
<br />
His new donkey teeth started pushing out as his snout grew longer and longer. His lips thickened and turned black. His teeth were very large, very blocky, and very yellow, with a blackish tint around the edges of each tooth and along his gum line. Donkeys don&#39;t brush their teeth, and he&#39;s quickly growing older towards middle-aged. His teeth were reflecting this fact.<br />
<br />
 His hands were getting larger, becoming manly hands. Same with his feet. Both hands and feet growing blond human hairs. Hairs on the tops of his toes and feet, and hair on his fingers. Blond, being the color of his human hair. This would be the very last vestiges of his human hair, before black karatin consumes his fingers and toes in the near future.<br />
<br />
His nostrils grow larger. And larger. And LARGER, as they flare outward, with the ability to take in more oxygen and increase his sense of smell to donkey proportions. <br />
<br />
As his air intake increased, so did the size of his lungs. As his lungs grew larger and slightly changed shape, so did his heart. Followed by all of his other internal organs. The biggest change of all, was his intestines and stomach. Turning into organs unable to ever process meat ever again. He&#39;ll only be eating a steady diet of grass and oats for a while. Meaning, forever. And his droppings will be a grassy pile of donkey manure.<br />
<br />
His skull now the exact shape and size of a large donkey, the pain shifted to his eyeballs. They grew larger, almost almond-shaped. His pretty, sharp, blue irises turned into the dull, dark, almost eyeballs of his new species. Taking his sharp 20/20 human eyesight away for good. Leaving him with the dull monochrome near-sighted donkey vision. His ears have also migrated to the top of his head, as his brain slightly changed shape in order to accommodate for the new location and auditory ability of his sharpened donkey hearing. <br />
<br />
With his head and neck now completely changed into the donkey he was quickly degenerating into, he opens his eyes to view the world with the lenses of a donkey for the first time.<br />
<br />
Breathing one last time outward: &quot;HHHHHAAAAWWWW!&quot;  before attempting to speak, he tries to stand up. But he&#39;s now larger in body. Much, MUCH larger! He also has the joints of a middle-age 40 year old man in his arms and legs. No longer the sort of 14 year old teenager he once was. And no longer the &quot;little brother&quot; to his now-younger sister. <br />
<br />
He is also fat. Not completely obese for a donkey. But still on the fat side. He now weighs a hefty 400 lbs as the species of a wild African donkey! He will eventually reach 680 lbs. But his rear-end and hips are still very much human.<br />
<br />
His still-human joints are now middle-aged, not able to easily stand up due to the 280 lbs he suddenly put on. His 40 year old middle-aged man&#39;s back aches. So does his 40 year old ankles. So he sits back down in the mud with a &quot;haaawww!&quot;<br />
<br />
He reaches for his face and feels the stout, stiff jaw muscles of his cheeks; if you can call them that. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck!?&quot; He attempts to say. Instead, haawwwing outwardly! <br />
<br />
&quot;Eerrgghh hhhaaw, eerrgghh hhhaaww, eerrgghh hhaaw, eeerrrgghh hhaawww,&quot; is all he is able to manage in his short-quick, panicky breathing as he feels around his head more and more. He reaches further and further outward along his snout, until he feels his nose. His soft, leathery donkey nostrils. All the while only saying &quot;eeerrggghh hhhaawwww eeerrrrgghhh hhhaaww eerrrgghhh hhhhaaawww.&quot;<br />
<br />
He opens his now-black, thick, donkey lips, and feels those! He pats along the top of the snout, up to between his eyes. Which felt....good! Almost like scratching a persistent itch! He begins to pet himself between his eyes, but then stops. He feels his huge, slimy donkey tongue, and slides it along his large, blocky, half-rotting middle-aged donkey teeth. He then used his manly hands to reach up and inside his mouth to feel his teeth in there. No more meat-eating canines for him! Just the large, ugly, utilitarian teeth of a large herbaceous beast of burden! <br />
<br />
Sighing again, he looks down sadly, stroking his thick donkey fur. Then brushed up against his huge penis! He forgot about that thing! He&#39;s also equipped with the monster-cock of a jackass, and will be from now on! Producing only donkey sperm! Whatever babies he now produces, will only be carried by a natural-born Jenny, and his foals will just be normal donkeys! Hell leave behind a long line of donkey descendents. Nobody ever knowing their forefather was a human. Just normal old african-variety donkeys!<br />
<br />
He&#39;d be crying, if donkeys could shed tears. Alas, they have no use for expressing emotions more complex than anger, satisfaction, or lust. And so, he no longer has tear-ducts to adequately express his deepening depression. <br />
<br />
His sister, meanwhile, was quietly looking on. Fascinated by the changes SHE did to him! And immensely  proud of her work! She&#39;ll be accepted into the witches&#39; academy, for sure! <br />
<br />
Smiling, she runs back into the house to grab a mirror and a flashlight. She wanted her brother to see how far he has progressed beyond feeling it with his hands. Rushing back outside a minute later, he is still sitting on his ass in the mud, in this steady rain shower at night. Weather hell just have to get used to. <br />
<br />
&quot;Here, have a look!&quot; she said to him. She held up the mirror close to one of his large BROWN eyes, and flicked on the light. <br />
<br />
Staring at himself, he sees the face of a donkey. He wonders why he&#39;s looking at a donkey, and asks as much. But all that came out was a &quot;eeerrrrgghhh hhhaawwww&quot;. <br />
<br />
He reaches up with his hands, and feels around his head and face again. The donkey in the mirror also has hands that does the same thing! That&#39;s him! That&#39;s what Dan looks like as a donkey! The mirror hit home. It wasn&#39;t just feeling his teeth with his tongue, nor his face with his hands. It was SEEING the blurry monochrome figure of a donkey head that hit it home to him! He looked just like any old donkey! The species he will be joining completely very shortly!<br />
<br />
He tries to talk, but can&#39;t. All he can do is bray!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hahaha, you&#39;ll also only be able to do that for a while as well! Hahaha!&quot;</p>
