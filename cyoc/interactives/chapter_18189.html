<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As he got upstairs, he could hear noises coming from Tommy’s room. It sounded like a man panting, but no, that’s what Timmy sounded like now – a man. But why was he panting? What was going on? As he pushed open the door properly  he got a shock. His brother was lying on the floor, his little bed was now too small for him now, naked again and with his big dick grasped between his two large hands, rubbing violently. He glanced up for a second as Jamie walked in, but didn’t seem to care. <br />
“Timmy, stop that.”<br />
”No”<br />
”Timmy now!”<br />
“Go….away” Timmy could barely get the words out as he masturbated profusely.<br />
“Timmy!”<br />
And suddenly it was over; Jamie watched as a large amount of cum sprayed suddenly from Timmy’s penis. Maybe even three times the amount that he could ever get from his more humble manhood. There was a big grin on Timmy’s face – almost a leer – as he laid back in smug self-satisfaction, his eyes closing.<br />
”Timmy” said Jamie, softer now “You mustn’t do that.”<br />
It was like talking to his brother was an effort now. “Why not?”<br />
“Because, it’s wrong.”<br />
Suddenly Timmy’s eyes opened and he stared coldly at his brother “It felt great.”<br />
Jamie couldn’t even believe he was having this conversation. He stood there dumb-founded. Suddenly, Timmy rose up from the floor- and Jamie felt himself take a few steps backwards, he was slightly intimidated!<br />
“I want to sleep now. Leave me alone” It wasn’t said as a request, it was an order and he wasn’t giving Jamie any chance to respond. Jamie stood rooted to the spot for a few seconds, as Timmy  walked, almost swaggered, slowly towards him. Until he was stood above his brother, his impressive body, his huge penis, standing before him. Jamie had to strain his neck to look up at his brother, but even keeping eye-contact was difficult for him. Jamie didn’t know what he was about to do, but he didn’t like it, he was out of there. And as Timmy shut the door firmly behind him, leaving his brother dawdling in the hallway, Jamie felt the tears gathering in his eyes.<br />
<br />
*******************<br />
<br />
Jamie froze outside Timmy’s bedroom, his hand close to the door – he was about to open it like he did every morning, but thought perhaps he better knock first. It was still early and even though he thought his brother was probably still asleep, he didn’t want to….disturb him.<br />
<br />
There was no reply. He tried again, calling out weakly “Timmy? Tim?” When his brother failed to respond for the third time, Jamie pushed the door open. The child-size bed that had used to belong to Jamie before being passed on to his little brother was obviously now too small for him, but he didn’t seem to be having too much trouble sleeping; face down, his large arms hanging over one end and his legs and big bare feet dangling over the other. Jamie gasped at Timmy’s magnificent, detailed, back-muscles, moving slowly up and down as he lay there in his stupor. It was incredible what this pill had done. Incredibly awful; but what would have taken years of development and work-outs had lasted less than a few seconds. He needed to find Charlie straight away and sort out what was going on. That big jock didn’t scare him anymore, he owed him. Maybe because it was only one pill Timmy had swallowed, the effects would eventually wear off and Timmy would be back to normal – he hoped so with all his heart. <br />
<br />
Jamie couldn’t help feeling that he was glad it was little brother who swallowed the pill and not him. At least this way, Jamie was still in control and able to sort the whole sorry mess out. Suddenly, the jock on the bed started to stir. Jamie stood there, transfixed, as he turned over, his magnificent chest and deep pectorals on display, pushing himself up from the bed with his bulky muscular arms. He rubbed his eyes and seemed to smile with sleepy recognition at his brother.<br />
<br />
Jamie smiled back “Hi, how are you feeling?”<br />
Timmy’s handed reached down to his jaw, where a smidgen of stubble was gathered, rubbing it slowly with curiosity. When he spoke his voice was a low drawl “I had a funny dream”. Then he stopped, shocked at the sound of his own voice. Gradually he lowered his eyes to his own chest and torso, amazed all over again.<br />
“It wasn’t a dream Timmy” replied Jamie, gravely.<br />
“No” Timmy was still caught up in a dreamy astonishment. He looked back up at his brother, mouth slightly open, and a look of earnestness in his eyes – as if to say ‘what now?’. Jamie knew that despite all appearances, and some of the events of last night, he was still his little brother.<br />
“Don’t worry about it Timmy, it’s going to be okay?”<br />
”Do I have to go to school?”<br />
“Not today, it’s Saturday. But no, maybe it’s best if you take a little break for a while.”<br />
“Cool.”<br />
“Do you want some breakfast?”<br />
”Yeah.”<br />
”What would you like”<br />
”Cocoa Pops.”<br />
”Okay”<br />
<br />
Jamie couldn’t help noticing that Timmy’s bedroom, cluttered with toys and bright decoration – red and yellow balloons littering the child-friendly wallpaper – had picked up a bit of a scent since yesterday. It was a man’s body-odour that filled the space, strong and potent. <br />
“You need a wash first, eh?”<br />
“A wash? I only had a bath yesterday.”<br />
”I know, but you might have to wash a bit more often for the next couple of days. Why don’t you go and have a shower while I get breakfast ready.”<br />
”A shower? On my own?”<br />
”Yeah, you’ve seen me have them, haven’t you. You know how to work it.”<br />
”Sure.”<br />
“Make you sure you wash yourself properly, and dry off. Then you can come down for your breakfast.”<br />
”Okay” Sat on the bed, Timmy smiled proudly up at his brother, about to have a shower on his own, like a big boy.<br />
<br />
Downstairs, half an hour later, Timmy tucked greedily into the bowl of cereal Jamie had given him. He was shirtless, unable to fit into any of his elder brother’s clothes that they had tried – but wearing the large pair of shorts that Jamie had found yesterday. His hair was damp, and his hairless muscular body glistened, still slightly wet from the shower. His arm muscle flexed admirably as he brought up the spoon to his mouth.<br />
<br />
”You don’t have to eat it so fast, you know.” Jamie teased.<br />
“I’m so hungry. Can I have another?”<br />
“Only one more.”<br />
Tim didn’t thank him, watching as Jamie slowly poured more cereal into the bowl. It was even a quarter full when he stopped. <br />
“More than that” demanded Timmy “Come on!”. In a single movement he tipped up the box in Jamie’s hands, so that his bowl overflowed with chocolate pops. Jamie was slightly astonished at his brother’s boisterousness, and watched tentatively as he grabbed the milk carton, sloppily pouring it in.<br />
“Careful Timmy.”<br />
Timmy ignored him, tucking in hastily. Jamie thought he’d leave him to it as he went upstairs to wash and dress.<br />
<br />
When he came back downstairs, Timmy seemed to have finished his breakfast, and was laying sprawled on the sofa, his naked legs stretched out and open, the delights of Saturday morning television occupying his attention. As Jamie glanced at the screen, he watched an attractive young female presenter, with her cleavage clearly on display, interview the lead singer of a famous boy band. Jamie looked down at his brother, his eyes fixed to the screen.<br />
“What about your cartoons?”<br />
Timmy looked up at him, seemingly annoyed. “I like her better”<br />
As he turned back to the TV show, Jamie watched a small smile appear on Timmy’s handsome face.</p>
