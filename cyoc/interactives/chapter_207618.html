<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The doctors briefed you on how some of the more practical parts of the swap would work. They explained they had a solid cover for you to give to your relatives and loved ones. It was actually pretty simple. You&#39;d tell people you were away for a year on a medical study, not specifying anything else, but you were available through message communication. Then, you&#39;d move into your own apartment, in your new body, as a sublet. All expenses paid and a fat reward at the end of the year. All that was left was to meet the person you&#39;d swap with and have both people agree to the swap. <br />
<br />
You were kind of excited about the whole ordeal. It would be weird, but this was so surreal. Who wouldn&#39;t be at least a little bit excited? Hell, you still had a chance to back down. <br />
<br />
The doctors left you alone while they were going through the procedure with the other person. Soon they&#39;d be done and in through the door your new home for the year would appear. You felt your heart beating faster and faster as you got more and more nervous. Who were going to peak through the door? You didn&#39;t have much more time to think about it, because in that very moment, the door opened. In came a woman. Probably about your age. She was cute. Hair dyed red, blue eyes. Petite... Well, petite was an undersell. The woman had dwarfism. She couldn&#39;t be much taller than 130 cm&#39;s. She looked at you, her eyes going wide. &quot;I&#39;m going to be a MAN?!&quot; the woman almost shouted. You hadn&#39;t even had time to think about it, but she was right. She would be a man. You&#39;d be a woman. A dwarf at that. You still felt like you had to go through with the swap. You needed the money. Being short and a woman was a small price to pay. But you were definitely going to have one weird year. That was for certain. <br />
<br />
The doctors just looked at the both of you and asked &quot;So, are you still swapping?&quot; as if nothing was weird about the swap. You just nodded. The woman in front of you was a bit more verbal. &quot;It&#39;s going to be weird being a man, but I&#39;m actually kind of excited to see how the weathers like up there&quot; she said, jokingly, while giving you a smile. <br />
<br />
As soon as you signed the paperworks, you were taken to another room. The doctors were eager to go. You were already about to have your bodies swapped. But you had just meet the woman. Didn&#39;t even know her name. You got washed, dressed and put in a bed. A nurse next to your bed told you to take a few deep breaths and soon, you&#39;d be in your new body. As you did, you felt a sharp pain in your arm. You had been injected with something. You felt the world start to spin and go dark...<br />
<br />
As you woke up, all you heard was the beeping of a heart monitor. You felt groggy. You tried to lean upwards but you lacked the strength to do so. What you could do, was look down. Two small lumps of flesh was protruding of your chest, hidden by a gown. Your arms felt shorter. No wonder, they were shorter. Your legs also felt as if they just stopped a bit too early. It was weird. Really weird. The feelings your new limbs gave you. For someone with dwarfism, this was all they knew. But you knew how it felt to be of normal stature - so for you, the lack of length in your limbs was a very foreign feeling. You thought about the woman. Wonder how she felt? Just as this was weird for you, this had to be equally weird for her.  Something else that felt weird was the lack of manhood. It was hard to describe, nothing really felt all that different, yet, but there was a clear feeling of lacking something. Like the way the fabric brushed against your body wasn&#39;t... right. Well, you&#39;d have more time to get acquainted with your new equipment later. You were a man in a woman&#39;s body after all. You were not going to miss this opportunity. Hell, after the year was up, the poor woman might get back her body and feel sore for a lifetime. You were not going to shy away from playing with a pussy, whenever you wanted. Even if that pussy now belonged to you for the time being. <br />
<br />
After a while, the doctors entered the room. They did all sorts of test to see if you were alright. After a while, they decided to go through what was about to happen. You were to be monitored for a few more days. After that, you&#39;d be sent back to your apartment to live your life for the upcoming year. But as they were done with the test, they told you to feel free to... explore. Or perhaps have a chat with the old Cindy. Cindy was the name of the woman you had swapped bodies with. A name you were expected to use for the coming year. <br />
<br />
The old Cindy had been awake for a while, it turned out. She, or rather he, now, was really excited about the whole thing. He loved being tall. You couldn&#39;t blame him. It did feel weird being this short. You could already tell everyday life was going to be a struggle. You had struggled out of the high bed and struggled into the sofa you were now sitting in. The old Cindy was also feeling pretty good about being a man. Apparently the old Cindy had already checked out his package and played around with it. Nothing sexual, things you&#39;d expect a little kid to pull off. Not strange given the situation, as in some sense, that was the stage the old Cindy was at for the moment. He&#39;d probably get to the good stuff given time. Now you were a bit worried you&#39;d get your body back after a year, dick pulled off. After chatting for a while, you went back to bed. You&#39;d have time to check yourself out later.</p>
