<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">*Several days after the Anderson/Twist dinner, and even longer since Eric and Julie’s movie date… <br />
<br />
“I’m home!” Eric shouted after entering the house. A sharp remark from Nate reminded him that the rest of his family didn’t need him to shout to hear. Eric made a point to then mutter an apology. He hung his still damp coat on the rack, and went into the kitchen. <br />
<br />
“So, how was the date little brother?” Nate asked from his seat in front of the TV. It was a little after eleven thirty, Nate preparing to watch one of the various late night programs. <br />
<br />
Eric, with his head in the refrigerator, simply shrugged in response. He and Julie had gone out to play mini-golf. And as this was Washington, the rain had changed their plans (again). So instead they spent two hours in a bookstore, and spent very little “quality” time together. After Eric told Nate what had happened, Nate couldn’t help but feel sorry for Julie. <br />
<br />
“Dude, you’re about as romantic as my big toe. I think Julie was hoping for something a little more intimate than browsing the local Barnes & Noble.” Nate said. <br />
<br />
“Where should we have gone? A brothel? Why do you care anyway? You always tell me to mind my own business, why can’t you mind yours?” Eric grumbled, slamming the fridge door. <br />
<br />
“You’re my little bro, gotta look out for you. I have more experience with the fairer sex.” Nate said. Eric rolled his eyes.<br />
<br />
“You’ve never had a girlfriend for more than five days, what experience? Getting dumped?” Eric thinks. <br />
<br />
“The point is, Julie likes you, and you show as much interest in her as I show in finishing ‘Withering Heights”.” Nate said. <br />
<br />
“Ya, great, whatever. Where are Mom and Dad?” Eric asked. <br />
<br />
“Out at a Skulk meeting, remember?”<br />
<br />
“Didn’t they just to one?”<br />
<br />
“That was Harry and Jenny’s wedding reception dude. You really should spend more time in the real world and not with your head in a book.” Nate sighed. Jenny, one of the resident werefoxes, and her steady boyfriend decided to elope before his parents finished the sentence. It wasn’t exactly a shotgun wedding, but it was close. They only invited close friends, and Skulk members. <br />
<br />
“Right, right. When will they be back?”<br />
<br />
“Who knows. Could be in a few seconds, could be hours. You know how those meetings go. I mean they don’t do the group sex stuff but things can still get…”<br />
<br />
“Gross man, I do not want to talk about our parents’ sex life!” Eric said, covering his ears. He was all good and fine with his family being more sexually active than before, but that didn’t mean he was okay with casual conversations about it. It was weird enough listening to Nate, Ben and Alex talk about the pack excursions. <br />
<br />
“Alright, calm down. No need to get your old man panties in a twist.” Nate said. As his show started, Eric took the opportunity to go upstairs. <br />
<br />
He glances at his cellphone before preparing to go to bed. There weren’t any messages on his phone, which lead him to think that maybe Nate was right. He makes the hasty decision to call Julie, and let her know he’s sorry the night didn’t pan out like she would have wanted. But she never picked up. <br />
<br />
Crestfallen, Eric tossed his phone aside and pulled the covers up over his head. He didn’t even care that he was still in his day clothes, or that his muddy shoes were on. <br />
<br />
From downstairs, Nate, who had been laughing at the TV, heard his brother scream in frustration. For a moment he wondered if he should go check on him. But Eric remained silent after that, and Nate knew that even if he went up, Eric was likely to just snap at him to go away. And with that, Nate turned his attention back to the TV, and whatever joke the host was telling. <br />
<br />
---------------------------------------<br />
<br />
“Julie?” Melissa called from the kitchen. Unable to sleep, worrying about Martin who was away for a few days to deal with the feds, she had been doing mindless house chores for the several hours. After reorganizing the cabinets, cleaning every visible inch of the kitchen, and polishing the stainless steel refrigerator, she had moved on to washing already clean dishes. <br />
<br />
Julie had just returned from her tedious evening with Eric. She was glad that he enjoyed himself, but she couldn’t have been more bored. Bookstore coffee and overpriced paperbacks wasn’t the swell night she had had in mind when she left the house. She had envisioned Eric wrapping his arms around her, showing her how to golf. Mini-golf, but still golf. Although in hindsight, that was fairly unlikely too. This was Eric, he wasn’t known for his passionate nature. <br />
<br />
“Ya, I’m home. Sorry I’m so late, we ended up at the bookstore in Lynwood.”  Julie sighed. <br />
<br />
“I figured something like that. Did you have a good time?” Melissa hesitated to ask. She knew Eric meant well, but he needed some coaching in romance. <br />
<br />
“I don’t know. Am I doing something wrong? Maybe I’m coming on too strong.” Julie muses, leaning on the kitchen counter beside her mom. <br />
<br />
“It’s hard to say. My advice would to just give Eric some time to adjust. Did you ever get around to asking him about Thanksgiving?” Melissa asked.<br />
<br />
“He and his family are already going to watch Ben Twist play. He said he’d pick me up around ten.” Julie said. That bit of information was really the only positive thing that had come out of their date. Eric had seemed like he was looking forward to that. And being somewhere in public with a lot of people would take some of the added stress off his shoulders. Julie suspected another part of the problem was that Eric was nervous about being alone with her. <br />
<br />
“When will Dad be coming home?” Julie asked. <br />
<br />
“With any luck, Thursday.” Melissa said, her tone a bit bitter. She tried to hide it, but Julie picked up on it. Her parents had told her about Martin’s “mistakes” several years ago, after her first change. And while it didn’t excuse his behavior, Julie at least understood some of her father’s motives for cheating on her mother. She herself was no saint. <br />
<br />
“Don’t worry Mom. Dad’s probably too stressed to think about anything else but work.” Julie said, patting her mother’s hand. Melissa smiles weakly, but in the back of her mind, still has her doubts. <br />
<br />
“You should go to be now, you’ve got school tomorrow.” she said. Julie kissed her mother goodnight and quietly retreated to her bedroom. As she changed her clothes, she paused and stared at the black cell phone that had once been in her pocket. <br />
<br />
“Eric hadn’t called or texted, should I?” she wondered. In the past the two had always sent a goodnight text, or something of the sort. Eric had to be home by now. Maybe he was talking to his parents, or Nate. <br />
<br />
Julie walked across the hall and into the bathroom. While brushing her teeth, she missed the call from Eric. When she returned to her bedroom, she didn’t bother to check her phone. She plugged it into its charger, and went to bed. Her gums still stung a bit from the overzealous brushing she’d given them. Unfortunately for her, she’d taken out her frustrations on her teeth. Julie drifted into sleep, the copper taste of blood settling unwanted on her tongue.</p>
