<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">// Hi. In the off-chance that someone wants to continue along with their own writing: I&#39;m a lazy soul who doesn&#39;t want to come up with a shitton of abilities for a make-believe RPG, but I dug myself into this hole. You can write your own abilities (if you&#39;re not lazy like me) into your chapter, I&#39;d be more than happy to riff along.<br />
<br />
<br />
I looked at the menus carefully. One thing that excited me was the prospect that I could get muscular like the wolf just by clicking some plus signs in a menu. Still, my physical attributes were being improved by Heritage, sl I should probably focus on improving my mental characteristics. Improving knowledge seemed like the number one priority if I wanted to be a mage. I did. <br />
<br />
Putting the two points into Knowledge, I clicked &quot;Confirm&quot;. Immediately, a fog cleared from my mind as I started to gain fundamental knowledge about the world we&#39;re in. Presumably, low knowledge didn&#39;t mean I was stupid, merely it meant how much I knew about this world and how quickly I could make connections using my knowledge. Looking at the wolf past the floating pop-up windows, I instinctively knew he was a Valgrave. A powerful mercenary. I didn&#39;t get a chance to look at his stats, but he must be incredibly strong and quick with his mind. Beastmen became less shocking to me as my mind acquainted itself with knowledge of many various races. <br />
<br />
&quot;I could get an upgrade to steal the knowledge of the little fella.&quot; I said chipperly, getting a curious look from the wolf. <br />
<br />
&quot;Would be useful, Dronoth. As you are right now, you&#39;re just fucking deadweight. Cute deadweight, but deadweight nonetheless.&quot; He said without a hint of hesitation in his voice. My brain only processed that he called me cute. I reached to the collar of my leather chestpiece to get some air as I felt myself growing hot. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, fantastic, you have the fucking hormones of a rabbit, too. Good to know you and the rabbit are sluts for bigger men giving you the slightest compliments.&quot; Boleyn said with frustration as he looked in the direction where the rabbit originally came from.<br />
<br />
The gigantic wolf was perfect. Every muscle on his body was developed to its limit. He was bigger, stronger, more dominant, more masculine… the vibrations of voice sent warm shivers down my back as my big ears longingly caught every word.<br />
<br />
F-fuck, I really do have rabbit hormones… hopefully that lust doesn&#39;t carry over with Heritage, else I don&#39;t see how I could get anything done. I focused my eyes back on the menu as I picked up Latent Magic and Knowledge Upgrade. This would set me on the path of a mage. Confirming the choices, I felt blood pour out of my muzzle as a new sense overwhelmed me. <br />
<br />
Magic was everywhere, in everything. Many things merely had a small tint, but living beings radiated so much of it, in various colors of the rainbow. It surrounded me, it surrounded the wolf, it coursed through the trees and plants. I wiped my nose, dropping my jaw in awe as I spun around, enamored by the beauty of the world around me.<br />
<br />
A stern voice took me out of it. &quot;Knew you sissy would try to connect with the magic of the world. Congratulations on becoming a wimp.&quot; Despite the magecism, there was a hint of playfulness in the wolf&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
<br />
Closing my eyes, I toggled the magic vision off. The world returned to its mundane beauty as I absentmindedly took Dodge as my final upgrade. Survival seemed like first priority.<br />
<br />
&quot;Done, Boleyn. What&#39;s our plan now?&quot; I looked up at the wolf. As I tried to look him in the eye, I instinctively felt my eyes drawn to the muscular chest. The wolf bounced a pec, making my eyes widen as I blushed further.<br />
<br />
&quot;Need to figure out how many allies he had, how strong they are, what they know, etc.&quot; the wolf shrugged. &quot;You think you can do that for me with your weird voodoo?&quot; He stepped closer. My ears raised up involuntarily. His chest was so close, if he wasn&#39;t wearing anything I&#39;d-.<br />
<br />
A snap of fingers took me out of my lusting. The wolf looked down at me, disappointed. &quot;I don&#39;t think you know how rabbits work, buck. They go without satisfying themselves once in a while, they start thinking with their dick instead of their brains. You need to jerk off.&quot; My brain short-circuited as I processed his suggestion. Something in my mind told this to be true. An unfamiliar confidence washed over me as I pulled off my pants and loincloth to reveal a growing 4&quot; covered in a sheathe of gray fur. Without any reservations, I began jerking off. A feeling of satisfaction washed over me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Meref, rabbits are fucking shameless…&quot; the wolf said stoically, turning away to keep guard. My knowledge told me that Meref was the god of love. Amusing.<br />
<br />
Thinking about how this wolf could bend me over and rail me until I couldn&#39;t walk, I instinctively connected with the memories of the other soul inside the body. <br />
<br />
Actually, something like that happened often. Back at the camp I have a boss, Palmer. Palmer is a rabbit like me, although much stronger. The image of the rabbit warrior&#39;s naked body pinning me down made me stroke faster. An another memory, one of hanging from the ceiling of a tavern bedroom, tied to it limb by limb as my legs were spread out to allow easy access to my boss flashed through my mind. I remembered every sensation…. One finger… two… t-three… release… the insertion of the firm shaft, slowly sliding in until…<br />
<br />
I couldn&#39;t follow the walk across the memory lane further. My sensitive shaft tickled signifying I was ready to finish. I stroked happily, letting a content grunt escape my muzzle. Ropes of cum shot from my penis, staining the grass and roots of the tree. <br />
<br />
Clarity washed over me as the sex-haze faded. I quickly thought about what I just did, shocked by my raunchy behaviour. I covered up my cock shamefully as I slid my loincloth and pants on. Why was I so happy to just masturbate on the spot? Why did I obey the wolf&#39;s order to do so?<br />
<br />
&quot;S-sorry, Boleyn…&quot; I sighed with a hint of shame in my voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;First time I heard a fucking rabbit apologize for being hornier than a teenage fox in heat. I could take it as another confirmation that you&#39;re really you, I guess.&quot; He turned around, inspecting the mess I made. &quot;Got your head in the game?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; I gave a firm nod, reaching into the memories of the rabbit as I drew on the necessary knowledge to know how to move stealthily and handle myself in a fight. The soul was more than willing to share, it would seem, as my movement became much more fluid and soft. The bow on my back was an extension of my form, a tool I knew as intimately as I knew my shaft. Effective distance, power, drawing speed all showed up in my brain, dictating my possibilities in combat. I even picked up a technique.<br />
<br />

<br />
I wanted to gain more knowledge, but my soul grew tired and heavy as I tried to reach for more. Best not to push myself. <br />
<br />
<br />
I shifted my posture to be straight, letting my giant ears fall behind my head as I pulled out the bow, grabbing an arrow and putting it straight into an apple on one of the neighboring trees as I pulled on the bow. My right arm knew the motion of pulling and releasing an arrow efficiently, my left arm deftly aiming as my eyes caught my surroundings and focused on the small apple. I turned around to my wolf companion with a goofy smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fucking uncanny. Maybe you&#39;re good for something. What are their numbers?&quot; Boleyn put a hand on my shoulder, looking at the shreds of the apple that I shot at.<br />
<br />
My mind told me we were 8, including me. Another ranger, a mage, three warriors, a barbarian and a rogue. The ranger scout would connect with me shortly, actually. He was probably 3 or 4 minutes away. A cheetah, proficient with a scimitar and a hand crossbow. I relayed the information to the wolf as the two of us quickly hurried into covering behind the same rock.<br />
<br />
He whispered to me as the two of us looked over the stone, ears lowered to not give away our position. &quot;I don&#39;t think we can take on all of them head-on, then, buck. I could take on two, you could maybe take out one, but the rest would fuck us up.&quot; I nodded, trying to spot the cheetah. He was a better scout than I am. Fast, didn&#39;t take fap breaks, knew more about the land than I did. Gave good head, too. I tried to figure out a strategy.<br />
<br />
&quot;It would be good if I could possess him.&quot; I sighed, trying to figure out how I would do something like that. &quot;Knock him out, then let me take over.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;How?&quot; He asked softly, seemingly warming up to me as I saw the yellow fur of the cheetah. He was well hidden, but he gave himself away when he came out to look at the mess I made, sniffing out the semen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seduction.&quot; I whispered back, coming out of hiding, sneaking towards the cheetah. Forty meters… twenty meters… five… GAH. The cheetah turned around with a scimitar pulled out, putting it to my neck instinctively before he recognised me. I froze in place. His hardened face relaxed as he put the scimitar in the sheathe (an actual one, not the one in his underwear).<br />
<br />
The man was wearing far less compared to my getup. He liked the feeling of the wind brushing against his fur. He wasn&#39;t wearing anything above his waist, making me blush as he hugged me, pressing my face into his chest and putting his head over mine. He was strong, experienced… a good friend… he held the hug for ten seconds, the taller cheetah withdrawing as he gave me a stern look.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re an oaf, Omel. At some point we should get Bosfor to cast a spell on you to castrate you.&quot; He ruffled my hair, his other hand waving at the mess I made.<br />
<br />
Knowing not to apologize for what came naturally to my body, I looked defiantly at the cheetah. &quot;Who would fill you up when you&#39;re hungry then, kitten?&quot; <br />
<br />
The cheetah&#39;s eyes sparked with familiar, playful anger. Putting his arms underneath my armpits and lifting me up effortlessly, he growled seductively. &quot;Who you calling a kitten, tiny? I should tie you up. Half an hour passes, and you&#39;ll be begging me to give you release.&quot; <br />
<br />
This was true. It was about six minutes since I came, so I had another fourteen before I needed a jerk. You&#39;d think this would make life difficult, but no, rabbits were allowed to stroke themselves anywhere, while doing anything. Combat was rather complicated, though. It was common to see an opponent disarm a rabbit using their horniness. It was common to see rabbits fuck their opponents, too. <br />
Worst was in the morning, where after a sleep rabbits would beg for sex. This is why I slept in the same tent as the boss. Both rabbits, both going insane in the morning.<br />
<br />
<br />
I utilized my high rabbit dexterity to my advantage. I bounced off of the cheetah&#39;s abs with my powerful paws, slipping out of his grasp as I got to do a cool backflip on the way down, landing on my feet. I wasn&#39;t faster than the cheetah, though, as when I tried to get behind him he tackled me to the ground, grabbing one of my big ears and hungrily whispering into it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or I could speed the process up along. I do love it when you&#39;re a submissive little mess.&quot; He released my ear, rubbing my crotch as he held me pinned to the ground with an arm, his thick legs restricting my movement almost completely. My balls stirred as I quickly filled up with lust. Trying to escape his grasp only made him pull down my clothes, revealing an erect shaft that he stroked eagerly.<br />
<br />
With every stroke, the will to resist faded. With every stroke, my thoughts of Boleyn and the ambush faded into irrelevance. With every stroke, I grew needier, hungrier, my eyes opening wide as I looked at the cheetah in a new light. Right now, the cheetah wasn&#39;t an enemy. No, the cheetah would set me free, so I needed to appease him… <br />
<br />
Seeing my gray-furred face turn red with blush, he stopped stroking me, keeping his grasp on me as he pulled his pants down. I looked at him with begging eyes, confused about why he stopped. With a smirk, he rolled the two of us around so that I was the one on top of him. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll have to pull your pants down for this one. Been a while since my cock went down the rabbit hole.&quot; He said assertively, stroking my penis a few times. The warmth spread to my rump, making me stick my tongue out as I removed my pants. When I reached for my loincloth, the cheetah removed it himself and then put it on my muzzle. I tried to take it off my face, but his hand held it firmly in place as he stroked my shaft a few more times. The feeling of disgust was replaced with eager hunger as I breathed my own smell in deeply, enamoured with the scent of my masculinity. <br />
<br />
My mind was completely under the control of the cheetah. With a stroke of my shaft, the man could get me to accept anything. This is why rabbits preferred to stay in ranged combat.<br />
<br />
I could see Boleyn making his way from the rock stealthily. To cover his approach, I moaned softly as I rode the cheetah&#39;s shaft. One moan after another, bringing the three of us closer and closer, until…<br />
<br />
The wolf caved the cheetah&#39;s head in, knocking him unconscious on the spot. I stood up, balancing my loincloth on my face as I stood fully erect, eager to get commands from the bigger wolf. He sighed, walking over to me and stroking my shaft a few times, getting my fervent attention.<br />
<br />
“Stop the fucking possession, runt.” I obeyed, separating myself from the flesh of the rabbit as I fell to the ground, landing directly on the cheetah. Fog faded from my mind letting me think normally again. Boleyn, wasting no time, started whispering something into the ears of the rabbit who was reclaiming his horny body as Boleyn stroked him. Boleyn laid down with the rabbit, putting him into his lap as the rabbit’s neck was innocently scritched by the wolf’s clawed hands.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I rested my hand on the cheetah’s bare chest. I would have time to cast possession before he woke up. Beginning the process, the world was once again reduced to simple shapes. Looking into the cheetah, the soul was… just a tree. At its root laid the consciousness, the sum of all parts, from which it branched through the whole body. I took the moment to appreciate that the spell seemed to lack internal consistency. First, it was cubes, then spheres, now the soul is a tree… whatever. My objective was to separate the root from the branches, then connect everything to myself. Grasping the root, I pulled, and pulled, until… <br />
<br />
I wasn’t very successful. The spell didn’t fail, nay, I was still casting it, but it did awake the cheetah. As I was melding into his body, he screamed, seeing my chest halfway inside of his. He grabbed me by my neck trying to force me out as I kept submerging deeper and deeper. This didn’t matter. What mattered was his connection to his body. Seeing the root pulse as it issued orders across its vessel, I tried to go the other way around. If I couldn’t pull the root from the branches, I could cut off the branches from the root. Tearing into a string with my hands, I gained control of a hand as I connected the branch into my own root. One by one, I seized control of the man’s body. At some point, I grew tired of his screaming, so I separated him from his vocal cords too. He was helpless to watch me take over his body as my head sank into his chest.<br />
<br />
Opening my eyes, I felt a throbbing pain in my head. I tried to stand up, falling over as I overestimated my familiarity with walking on digitigrade paws. Catching myself with my arms, I panted, trying to recover my breath. My heart was beating like crazy. Laying on my back, I stared into the branches of the giant tree above me. Soon, looking was too painful. I closed my eyes, just focusing on breathing in and out. In, and out… In, and…<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I opened my eyes, looking around me as I shot up anxiously. The sky was dark, packs of clouds still visibly roaming the open space above me. I could hear the crackling of a campfire next to me illuminating the makeshift camp.<br />
<br />
I was out, but it couldn’t have been for more than two days. The possession would have ended otherwise. I looked around, expecting to see Boleyn, but as I investigated my vicinity I recognized the tents. They belonged to the headhunters. How did I get here? Why the fuck wasn’t I in a tent? It’s cold out, despite my fur making it feel like a nice breeze. I got out of the bedroll, standing up with a grunt.<br />
<br />
What was going on? A tick in the corner of my eye told me I had achievements and level-ups to look through, but I felt like I had more pressing matters to deal with. I drew upon my borrowed knowledge of stealth, deftly moving my paws as I peered into the tents. There were three, each meant for two men to rest inside. Counting the snoring beastmen, though, I identified only five.<br />
<br />
A sixth man quickly identified himself as my vision was closed with a pair of hands. A soft, playful, young feline voice whispered into my ear.<br />
&quot;Guess who?&quot;<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t difficult. Drawing upon the cheetah&#39;s knowledge, I knew that this was Collie, a confusingly named black cat. A rogue. I channeled the cheetah&#39;s memories, figuring how I should behave to not arouse suspicion or anathema. The cat would enjoy some sarcasm.<br />
&quot;Probably the wolf we&#39;re tracking. I&#39;m about to die, aren&#39;t I?&quot; <br />
<br />
Removing his hands from my face, I turned around to look at the lithe individual. He was wearing a set of black leather, a black cloak blending into his black fur. Collie was black as fuck. Only his white fangs shone brightly in the dark as he spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope, guessed wrong.&quot; He said nonchalantly before his face took on a deadly grim face, scaring me a little bit. &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re alive, Tiber. Olem was killed by that fucker.&quot; He spat on the ground, clenching his fists as a tear formed in his large cat eyes.<br />
<br />
I grabbed him into a hug. Collie cried into my neck as I stroked his back.<br />
<br />
&quot;D-did we get that cunt?&quot; I asked, worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;We didn&#39;t...&quot; He held me back, wrapping his arms below mine. We stayed like that for probably ten minutes, just wallowing in sorrow, holding one another as we wordlessly expressed our feelings.<br />
<br />
I was a sheep among wolves. They were all hardened mercenaries, more or less. I was an amateur in a new world with only a special ability. One that would force me to get out of this cheetah&#39;s body within a day or two. I needed a plan of how to survive.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We watched the embers flicker as me and the cat sat in front of the campfire. My mind was elsewhere, so was the cat&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are we still following the wolf?&quot; I asked, running my fingers through my fur as I absentmindedly inspected my new body. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think so, yes. It&#39;s personal now.&quot; Collie sharpened a dagger, face growing angry. &quot;It might be impossible to defeat him. From what I saw, fucker swallowed several flasks of poison and kept on walking like it&#39;s nothing, even taking the two of you down. How&#39;d that even happen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Olem was likely wrapped around his finger, exploited where it mattered most for a rabbit.&quot; I connected with the cheetah&#39;s knowledge. Lying came naturally to him, which would be useful. I felt my soul growing heavier as a popup flashed in the corner of my eye.<br />
<br />
Proficiency Gained: Deception.<br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t see a good way out of this situation, however. If I told him I saw the rabbit get killed in front of me and then had a heart attack, it could be strange that my weapons weren&#39;t drawn. If I said I saw him die, he could question lack of blood on me, or how the rabbit looked. He probably wouldn&#39;t, though.<br />
<br />
&quot;When I arrived, Olem... Olem was already...&quot; I cried, feeling a paw stroke my shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay, Tiber.&quot; He said bitterly. <br />
<br />
&quot;I couldn&#39;t handle it, man.&quot; I put my face into my hands, hunching over as I wept. I felt like shit, lying to the cat, but I didn&#39;t want to get into danger.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m here for you, alright?.. You&#39;re my friend, Tiber, and Olem was a friend to all of us. We&#39;ll honor his memory correctly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With an orgy?&quot; I joked to lighten the mood. There was a long moment of silence before the rogue decided to humour me with a chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, with revenge.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two of us spent more time together before he returned to his tent. I was left to stand watch over the camp.<br />
<br />
This gave me time to navigate the menues. Opening my notifications up, I was flooded with a list of achievements.<br />

Looking at the attributes, I noticed that my dexterity was higher than it should be. Probably an after-effect of Heritage. God, I hope I didn&#39;t inherit the horniness. Or the submissiveness.<br />
