<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There were those who thought 'jihad' should mean 'spiritual struggle' and then there were those who believed it more properly meant 'holy <br />
war.' <br />
<br />
The beautiful office building didn't stand more than a mile from where the first true sword strike had been laid upon the infidels. It gave a <br />
beautiful view of what the infidels called 'Ground Zero.'  And like the little spider that climbed up the water spout, they were repeating their <br />
efforts so it may be destroyed again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mindless robots.&quot; The not unhandsome man in the business suit said looking at the sight from his window. <br />
<br />
A buzzer in his pocket went off. He sat down at his desk and unlocked a drawer to reveal a phone with no buttons or dial. All it had was <br />
another custom lock. Undoing it he picked up the silent phone. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lovely night.&quot; He said in a calm voice as the sun shined outside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Last sunset was awful.&quot; Came the reply code phrase. <br />
<br />
&quot;Report.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir. It's impossible to believe. It's should not BE possible! Osama bin Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about our friend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's, he's, he's dead! The infidels murdered him!&quot;<br />
<br />
A maid outside the office heard a overpowering enraged,  &quot;WHAT-??!&quot;<br />
<br />
There was dead silence as the man in the business suit made no reply for several minutes as he was given the details. Finally he said, &quot;Get the <br />
message to our prison contact, have him inform the doctor Eugene Changes we have reconsidered his officer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir.&quot; The line went dead.  <br />
<br />
~~~ <br />
<br />
Deep within the protective confines of the pentagon, a man with the stars on his shoulders that marked him as a general picked up the phone <br />
after being told by his secretary the line was secure and who it was. <br />
<br />
He actually preferred talking to her over the phone than in person. He would be a hypocrite he called her genetic modifications unnatural. But <br />
there was just something -off- about her compared to the other humans who had their gene tampered with by that mad scientist. <br />
<br />
It was her hair. The general didn't know how to best explain it. Something about it felt off, tacked on somehow. It was very real, and wasn't a <br />
wig, that much was certain, but something about it just didn't feel right when he saw it on her head. Maybe it had to do with her having been <br />
given the DNA of a male lion when he was genetically raped.  Lionesses were supposed to be baled. The general had studied biology before <br />
changing majors to military history.  'I guess it just stands out more for me.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Miss Doctor, it's a pleasure to hear from you again. We were VERY worried when those thugs tried to destroy your research and murder <br />
you. . . . <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes we have a vested interest. But you must understand that we truly do value you, you are a brilliant woman willing to serve her country . . . <br />
<br />
&quot;We discussed this before, you are completely free to work on a 'cure' on your own time without super vision or restriction.  But you are to <br />
when on the clock to continue to aid in the development of Project Valkyrie.  Change is too insane to be trusted and that leaves you... <br />
<br />
&quot;Good. Yes my son has volunteered to be the first subject once the technology has become safe enough for human testing. Yes I am proud of <br />
him wanting to sacrifice his humanity and manhood to serve his country . . .<br />
<br />
&quot;Doctor I'm disappointed. You know this technology is the new atomic bomb. It'll be developed by others with or without your help. If the <br />
technology is not controlled it'll run out of control. . . . Glade you understand that. . . . <br />
<br />
&quot;No. For the last time. I'm just making things go smoothly and don't spiral out of control. I'm NOT the one who came up with the idea of an <br />
small army of genetically engineered winged reptile women! The alternative was husky dog people.. . . Yes that's what I think of it too <br />
personally.&quot;<br />
<br />
~~~<br />
<br />
On the west coast, a number of men and women in business suits and casual outfits. <br />
<br />
&quot;So how did it go?&quot; Asked a tanned skinned woman with long black hair.<br />
<br />
A blue eyed blond haired man answered having just gotten off the phone, &quot;Perfectly. Better than perfect. Nothing ever goes exactly as planned <br />
but all the objectives have been met.  Beauregard has been sentenced to life imprisonment, tra la la, good bye forever. RAM is already or will <br />
be soon be labeled as a hate group.  The enhanced have been victimized completely and utterly now in the people's minds. Dr. Change is <br />
completely forgotten about and everyone in the media fixates on the stereotypical southern bigot Mr. Beauregard.  The enhanced are the <br />
heroes and their detractors the villains, that is what everyone is seeing now and will be for a long time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have just one question.&quot; Asked the youngest man in the room. His black suit and tie were a strange contrast to his dyed purple, blue, and red <br />
hair.He had inherited his grandfather's communication company only two months before and was still learning proper corporate etiquette. <br />
&quot;Where da Hell did you find that Syphilis infected Straw Republican/Straw Conversation nut job to set up as your villain in this production?&quot;<br />
<br />
The blond man rolled his eyes, &quot;As I said before. Beauregard is not even aware he has the disease. No one even bothered to medically examine <br />
him. His paranoia of doctors helped there so much. And with his history as a fundamentalist, no one is even remotely questioning his actions <br />
as being genuinely insane. Even his own lawyer didn't realize his client actually was crazy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That isn't what I asked dammit!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm setting up my points. Beauregard fell into our lap. He felt the protection laws were more interested in protecting predators feeding off his <br />
cattle than his cattle, and his falling out with the tigress was totally his own actions and his own fault for not compromising when he had the <br />
chance.  We intended him to be a stand alone villain, but when he formed his little club, and on TOP of that stealing from it at the same time? <br />
HA!  All we needed to do was slip in some donations with our insiders to make sure the group didn't go belly up before it served it's purpose <br />
and to lead him on the path he needed to take. The man is so blindly full of himself that he took everything we suggested as his own idea.  <br />
Expanding his targets from just the tigress to was something he'd never admit wasn't his own idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And?&quot; The young man asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;AND!&quot; The blond haired man said, &quot;He gave the people just what they needed. A totally unsympathetic villain with completely insane straw <br />
political stances out to murder an innocent woman already violated and her lover! . . . &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You should have kept a closer eye on him.&quot; A short faux-red headed woman said. &quot;Those punks trying to murder the lioness was NOT part of <br />
the script.  LET ALONE them altering themselves into enhanced. We scenario called for all enhanced to be sympathetic after the police finally <br />
tracked down Change after he stabbed us all in the back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He never saw our faces or even knows our names let alone heard our voices. All he knew was some funding with instructions to help him <br />
along what he was already doing on his own.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;THAT'S NOT THE POINT!&quot; The red-haired woman snarled, &quot;Beauregard nearly killed the best chance we have in his country of making the gift <br />
of becoming our furry selves real while you were fixated on making the gift publicly sympathetic.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That was a rather thoughtless slip up.&quot; The tanned woman said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Downright stupid if you ask me.&quot; Said the young man looking out the window bored.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look! No harm. No foul! And we've kept the punks out of the media's attention center. That's what counts. And this DOES help us in that the <br />
lioness will see the government can't properly protect her. We'll provide a good alternative.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe.&quot; The red haired woman said not sounding amused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Beauregard and his group have become the perfect antagonists that no one with any sanity or emotion will sympathize with. And Beauregard <br />
will die forgotten in prison when his disease he refuses to even accept he has kills him off and his drops off the public's mind like Change has.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Should we keep RAM around a bit longer? Or dispose of it?&quot; Asked a blue eyed black haired middle aged man. <br />
<br />
The faux red head spoke, &quot;The group is shrinking as it is already. If it manages to continue on it's own without infusions for a little bit, I vote <br />
we keep it around as a public stress release point until we move onto the next phase of making the gift something that the average person will <br />
WANT! If it implodes, no big loss at this point. It's served it's purpose. Molly and her husband are heroes in the media eyes.&quot;<br />
<br />
The young man said, &quot;Then let's get the lion chick on board and get the fur coats you never need to take off into the public wish list.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; The tanned woman said, &quot;Not yet. First we let the tensions between her and the military stretch as tight as they can before we move in as <br />
the heroes to save her from her blight. If he leaves on her own we offer a helping hand. . . . We'll get our new species, our true inner selves, <br />
soon enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
~~~<br />
<br />
They weren't all ranchers. And many of them of them, those were left, lad little of anything against Molly. At this point coming together become <br />
more of a habit they had formed since Beauregard had brought them together. <br />
<br />
&quot;Did ya hear da news?&quot; Said one of the few women there, &quot;We're officially a Hate Group, no better than the KKK or the skin-heads.&quot; She tossed <br />
a news paper on the table of the hall they were rent out of their own pockets after their donations that Beauregard had stolen had been <br />
declared non-refundable. <br />
<br />
A round man said pushing on his glasses, &quot;That would explain that prick I had to chase off the property dressed like a ghost sayin' how we're <br />
buddies now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Should have shot'em.&quot; The blond woman spat. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bastard would have likely sued our asses off, and the TV would have painted it as the 'forces of evil fighting among themselves' like the ghosts <br />
(KKK) and the morons (Mormons) do already.&quot; Said a young man in black off handed.<br />
<br />
An albino in a hat grunted, &quot;I guess we have only one real option then. Not that it was obvious before.&quot;<br />
<br />
The fat man asked, &quot;Wring our stolen money out of Beauregard's hide before they ship him off to prison?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; The albino said, &quot;As of now, officially, on paper and informally. RAM no longer exists. We are dispersed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can go home now?&quot; asked the man in black.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; The albino said, &quot;Beauregard was a thief and a maniac and wanted to be a murderer. But we still have people going around the country <br />
who had their DNA recklessly altered by a mad scientist using a new technology created by a maniac, a new technology that never went <br />
through one iota of testing, yet none of the victims were examined for side effects, like tumors. They discovered one side effect already that <br />
exchanging of fluids spreads the retro virus or whatever. And yet they never bothered to check for OTHER unseen side effect as far as the news <br />
papers were all told.  People who take self defense classes are considered legally to be constantly carrying lethal weapons. Yet these people <br />
who had their DNA raped are considered to be completely harmless!&quot; <br />
<br />
The man in black laughed, but the sharp edge was directly at his own self, not at anyone else, &quot;Too bad the guy who blew the whistle was a <br />
loony out for revenge?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh?&quot; Asked a reddish skinned white haired man sitting next to the young man in black.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on!  'Racist pig' my ass!!! Beauregard was out for revenge for day one! I don't know if he believed anyone he told us! But he just <br />
wanted to get back at the tiger-lady for telling him no! And his ego was WAY too big for any city-girl to tell HIM no!  He just wanted to pay her <br />
and her boyfriend back for not wanting to be his work hands!  All the BS about 'mindless animal' and 'dangerous' were all just so he could get <br />
back at someone who bruised his overblown ego!  He's as racist as the guy at the bar who stabs you for taking his seat is racist again people <br />
who sit down! Good riddance!&quot; <br />
<br />
One of men in the room who had actually LIKED Beauregard and still refused to believe he had been robbed blind stood up from his chair and <br />
walked out of the room and out of the meeting hall.<br />
<br />
&quot;And then there was one less.&quot; The woman blandly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Anyone in this for charisma is here for the wrong reasons.&quot; The albino said. &quot;RAM no longer exists. End of story. Our new mission plan is <br />
simple. One: get the government to put a collar and muzzle on this mad scientist technology before it becomes over the counter DNA or G.I. <br />
Wombat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Two,&quot; Said the fat man, &quot;Make sure people don't forget bein' human ain't all that bad and it ain't gonna make'em happy bein' somethin' else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Three,&quot; Said the blond woman, &quot;Make sure the mad scientists victims aren't going to spontaneously melt into slime or something similar and <br />
they get the examinations they should. Each one of them is completely different. So it has to be a case by case basis.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Declarers Rational Alternative Genetics Of National Sanity.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;DRAGONS.&quot; <br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
Changes walked away from the prison, the fence behind him. He had put on a lab coat over his bright orange prison uniform. It wouldn't fool <br />
anyone, but it wasn't meant to, he just felt naked without one.  He man he had taken it from wouldn't be needing it anymore. <br />
<br />
The prison riot was still going on, giving him the distraction he needed. But he wouldn't get very far even with the riot on. Except if his <br />
benefactors HADN'T been lying to him. And those mashed potatoes the convicts complained about had nothing to do with bad cooking. <br />
<br />
He check the watch he taken from his prison impound box. &quot;Five, four, three-&quot;<br />
<br />
The building shook behind him, several explosions happening at once. The explosives inside several unsuspecting prisoners going off at once. <br />
The prison was now in flames. It would be all that harder to tell whose corpse was there and whose wasn't. <br />
<br />
&quot;Two seconds slow.&quot; He readjusted the watch. <br />
<br />
The unmarked, white van drove up next to him and opened. He was actually slightly disappointed they weren't wearing turbans. Most were even <br />
Caucasian. But he recognized those looks in their eyes. And those uzis weren't for show. <br />
<br />
&quot;Get in.&quot;  Changes obeyed without question as they drove away from the prison. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm glade you chose to release me when you did-&quot; He was punched in the face.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are to be our instrument of justice against this nation of murderers. We are not your friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You need better people skills.&quot; Change wiped the blood from his mouth, &quot;You should have pretended to be friendly for a while longer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't care.&quot; The man who punched him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heh. Yes I know I know. You want this nation to be like the animals they already are to you? To be the beasts you've already judge them to be? <br />
Fine. Those near sighted prudes judged my art as a crime against humanity, a crime against nature. . . . But I'll create my art again. This time <br />
they'll all get to experience it first hand. This time more than a small carnival show. I'll be remembered at the world's greatest scientist and <br />
artist of this generation.&quot;<br />
<br />
The men with the uzis just rolled their eyes.  &quot;Can you do it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I can. I am Dr. Changes. DNA is my clay.&quot; If anyone had known Changes in person from before. They'd have noted a, well, change <br />
had come over the mad scientist. He was calmer now. Mellow. Almost passive. With a rather bizarre 'innocent' air to him. He had gone even <br />
more mad. Or had gone so insane he had reached a completely different but fully functional and rational state of thinking form everyone else. <br />
&quot;Thankfully I was able to slightly continue my research. I wasn't able to do as much as I liked with those cameras and guard everywhere, didn't <br />
want me to create  more 'monsters.' They were hoping to use my technology to cure birth defects and cure cancer. . . . Such narrow dreams.&quot;<br />
<br />
Again the men with uzis just rolled their eyes as they escaped the prison to where the doctor told them they should go next.<br />
<br />
Two days later, they arrived at an abandoned carnival grounds, where it had all begun. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now we begin again, right where we left off.&quot; Change said acting like he was in change.  &quot;Did you young men know the difference between <br />
DNA and RNA? And instinctual knowledge? No I don't think you would. It's not something most people do.  But far more interesting, brain cells <br />
in people's heads die every day. EVERY DAY! What a waste.&quot;<br />
<br />
The men with the uzis wondered where Changes was going with this rambling. <br />
<br />
&quot;But if my genius could grow a tail. Why not neurons? Well they did already since instincts don't come out of thin air, and a creature without it's <br />
proper instincts will choke on their own saliva or a thousand other things. Of course the Super Ego in theory rules over the Id . . . in theory. <br />
Now imagine if I had been working on something when arrested, something even my lioness didn't know at the time. And of course, that left it <br />
all incomplete. But what if I was able to complete it on myself while in that Hell hole? And it was already complete in all my works of art? Of <br />
course when I saw no one was accepting their grand destiny of becoming my art steps needed to be taken. Cages simply wouldn't do for MY <br />
art!  Now did you know that pheromones can trigger irreversible biological reactions?&quot;<br />
<br />
 ~~~<br />
<br />
In prison, the human bulldog members held down their leader (the one who had originally transformed himself, and though his body fluids had <br />
changed his two women and through them the rest of his gang).  <br />
<br />
&quot;He's gone freakin' nuts!&quot; Said one of the other bulldogs for once actually GLAD when the guard showed up with some tranquilizer.  Their boss <br />
had stripped naked and was trying alternative to bend the bars like he was Superman, squeeze through them, or just use himself as a battering <br />
ram!  The loyal gang members tried to get a few words out of him. But he just told them harshly that, &quot;What's with youses! Can't ya tell we're <br />
NEEDED somewhere! Somewhere we GOTTA BE! And do somethin' important! Dumbasses!&quot; <br />
<br />
The rest of the bulldog gang and their two ladies hearing about their man's sudden change in behavior didn't feel the slightest urge, feeling, <br />
compulsion, or need to 'be somewhere' or 'do something' except maybe actually HELP the guards hold him down as they put him under and <br />
strap him to a bed till he came to his senses. <br />
<br />
~~~~<br />
<br />
I was half asleep with my wife in my arms. I didn't think much of it until she tried to shake me awake, telling me there was somewhere really <br />
important we had to be and do, but I was too tired and worn out to really hear any of it. Eventually she left me be. I just fell asleep by the <br />
moment I realized something didn't feel right. <br />
<br />
When I got up in the morning, there was no sign of Molly. In the house or outside. I asked. And what I was told made no sense at all. Her <br />
bounding across the country side naked?  I had no idea that she was already long gone and in the hands of a devil I thought I wouldn't have to <br />
think about for the rest of our days. <br />
<br />
~~~~<br />
<br />
The men with guns and Changes saw them approach. Changes didn't see quite as many as he remembered creating. Then he remember some <br />
filth had apparently murdered some of his beautiful creations. Well, all art was unique and precious, but soon he'd be able to bring his self <br />
expression onto a scale he had not even dreamed of before. And they would all embrace their new selves in a way the entire world would never <br />
forget. <br />
<br />
The men with guns were not stupid. They knew Molly, Leona, and the rest had all free will, a conscience (as much as the godless infidels could <br />
have) and the ability to think their decisions through based on social conditioning. But what Changes promised was too tempting to pass up. <br />
An example to the rest of the world, no longer humans with bodies made into evolved animals, but intelligent animals that happened to go on <br />
two legs and had thumbs. Their social conditioning left meaningless to them. The nation of the infidels would fall apart and become a wild land <br />
of tribal animal people. And the world would see United States for what it was all along. <br />
<br />
Changes smiled and welcomed them with opens arms and they came to him. <br />
<br />
Molly joined the semi-rank and file crowd of animal people, just another one of their numbers, another one of their pack. This was the <br />
important place she had to go. It was more important than anything, even more important than her husband she had to sadly admit, though <br />
she had wished he had joined her. <br />
<br />
She stood naked and free along with the rest of her pack mates. Leona stood a bit closer to the front of the pack and Molly leaned a bit closer <br />
to her friends glade to see her again. <br />
<br />
The doctor examined Leona triumphantly. She made no protest or attempt to attack of harm him. It was the the most important thing in the <br />
world that she come here, and it was important than she, and her pack mates, even though they were all different species, they were a pack, <br />
protect and help the doctor, no, pack leader, in all he asked of her, of Molly, and all the others. Everything else was secondary. She didn't care <br />
he had outright betrayed her before, used her, stabbed her in the pack. Those things didn't matter, they were meaningless. <br />
<br />
The rest of the horde felt the same. Their families, their jobs, their friends, all superfluous in comparison where they --BELONGED--!<br />
<br />
The men with guns felt sick at the sight before them, but comforted themselves by reminding themselves these men and women were no <br />
longer human and thus shouldn't be offensive to the men with guns. <br />
<br />
Soon enough, the men with guns and Changes were gone, and the small horde with them. Dr. Changes had much to do, on a swifter and <br />
grander scale than anything he had before. And he wasn't sure how much time he had to do before his 'liberators' decided they didn't need him <br />
anymore. <br />
<br />
And the small horde, felt good to be back together again.</p>
