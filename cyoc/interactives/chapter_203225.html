<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chuck stood awkwardly outside his car with a thumb out at the edge of the road. It wasn’t the highway, oh no, the map program had sent him down an old dirt road near the Arizona-New Mexico state line. The nearest gas station was forty miles back. He could give himself a speed boost with the Book of Body but he didn’t want to trigger Paradox and lose himself out here. Alone.<br />
<br />
The hot noon sun beat down on his head, heating his horns up. Frankly, Chuck couldn’t see how they stood it, the steers across the road, out there under the hot sun all day. He was sweating like a horse and hoped no one would see him like this. Not like they would recognize him anyways.<br />
<br />
He’d changed himself, at RK’s advice, and was heavily muscled, though with a healthy coat of chub to lessen the impact and had increased his height an inch or two. His build was like a power-lifter&#39;s and the testosterone boost he’d given himself had left him with a healthy coating of hair. He’d also altered his dark, Mestizo complexion to more of a healthy sun-kissed tan like a Caucasian farmer might have, figuring he’d get a lift if he were white. Even changed his hair to a lovely dirty blonde, giving it a bit of length and a wind-blown appearance, enhancing the cowboy image RK had non-too-subtly placed in his head. <br />
<br />
He wished he’d had time to shop for more than just the overalls and white shirt he now wore. Maybe buy sunglasses and a hat to complete the look.<br />
<br />
It was the clothes that had landed him in this predicament. David had still been snoring when he went back to his room. He considered using David to buy him clothes that would fit his planned body, but he was afraid. Afraid his best friend would try to turn him into a woman again, against his will. Afraid he might like him and his big, beautiful cock. Chuck licked his rather dry lips and shook his head, trying to get his mind off of THAT, he was straight, he liked pussy. <br />
<br />
But he didn’t want to go out in public. RK had basically told him the reality shift was what had given him the horns and tail and ears of a cow and not following a trend, that he’d misused his Book and now he’d look like a freak. He hadn’t told RK that it wasn’t the tails, ears, or little nubs of horns that made all the guys laugh at him. And that’s why he believed RK when he’d said it was a punishment, because he couldn’t understand why he’d give himself THAT.<br />
<br />
He managed to make it to the Big N’ Tall store, hiding his horns and tail, though his ears still stuck out. Chuck had gathered up as much stuff in the size he’d wear as he could, keeping it simple and plain because they were much cheaper. He figured he’d only need about a week’s work of clothes, some socks and a pair of workman’s boots. At the checkout, thing became odd.<br />
<br />
Friends from his school wandered in the store. Mack and Jay. Mack was a tall and muscular, dark haired man who used to be on the swim team in highschool. Jay was rather portly with decent-sized muscles and short. They laughed between themselves, talking about this and that, and saw him standing at the register. Jay hugged him from behind while Mack circled around in front of him, eyes bright.<br />
<br />
“Oh shit, it’s my man Chuck!” Mack chuckled and slapped Chuck in the stomach.<br />
<br />
Chuck hissed in pain and went to rub his aching…sore spot, but Jay’s hands were already there, soothing them. The cashier and Mack were to busy to notice when those hands drifted down Chuck’s pants and rubbed his hardening cock. Chuck wanted to say something, but Jay was looking at him and his heart was pounding and he really wanted to kiss him.<br />
<br />
“Sir, don’t assault our customers.” The cashier, an older man, told Chuck sternly.<br />
<br />
“What? I’m just having fun with my old buddy here.” Mack smiled wickedly. “He can take it.”<br />
<br />
The old cashier eyed Chuck, who stood at the register shivering, eyes downward and said, “I’ll call the cops.”<br />
<br />
“Whoa, okay, geez, I was just having fun. Come on, Jay.” Mack sauntered off to the athletics aisle.<br />
<br />
Jay withdrew from Chuck’s pants, leaving a wet stain behind. He licked the precum off his fingers and winked as he left, jogging after Mack. Chuck stood stock still, incapable of understanding what had gone down. Did Jay think he was cute? Why had he been so hard when another man touched his cock?<br />
<br />
He could imagine himself going back, meeting up with Jay in the changing room, maybe…Chuck licked his lips…maybe they’d suck each other off? He shook his head, driving the image out of his mind. Even if he were…gay...or you know, whatever, no one could love an ugly pudgy guy like him. For a second he wanted to go back there, maybe use the Book to make himself just slightly more attractive and take a swing, but maybe….maybe he read the whole thing wrong. Maybe Jay wasn’t groping him because he was interested, but because he was cruel and if he went back Jay would loudly call him a fag and punch him like Mack had back in high school and he hadn’t even wanted to suck a dick back then.<br />
<br />
“Will that be all, son?” The old man asked him.<br />
<br />
Chuck looked up and noticed he’d only bought the one outfit, he’d forgot to buy more clothes….but the thought of going back out into the aisles with Mack and Jaw still lurking there made him shiver. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, I’m good thanks.” Chuck paid and left.<br />
<br />
He parked at an abandoned warehouse and used the reflection on the high windows to give himself the makeover and got back in his car. Chuck stared at the corn-fed and farm bred power-lifter cowboy look and decided he’d look strong enough to play the part of the Book of Body properly. Plus, they had no idea he didn’t normally look like this. Travelling somewhere no one knew him was kinda like a reality shift anyways. He-he could be anyone!<br />
<br />
Chuck was so excited at meeting these new guys and this tiger man, Troy, who he hoped would make him into a real bull man, reality shift and all, that he misread the route the map program had shown him. He hated the sound of the fake voice cutting in and telling him to turn here or there, so he usually just memorized the route.<br />
<br />
And now, a day later, here he was, stuck in the middle of nowhere with inflicting Paradox on himself the only option. Would he transform into an actual farmer’s boy, or just one of the steers that wandered the fields around here? According to RK, it could go either way. A bull took less effort, less memories to add him into reality. An Auditor could take mercy on him and give him the former, though. If he were lucky. But would he be happy?<br />
<br />
All Chuck ever really wanted was to be useful. He wished the people he’d helped would acknowledge him, but thanks to the reality shift, they never did. Even David, though he’d held the Book and regained his memories, had never considered him useful. Hadn’t even thanked him. Just said, ‘wow, that Book is amazing’. The Book. Not Chuck. Chuck wasn’t amazing. That’s why he’d jumped at the chance to prove his usefulness, make money on streams. But in the end, David hadn’t wanted Chuck, he’d wanted Juanita.<br />
<br />
Chuck sighed and checked his cellphone. Battery would run out soon. He figured he might as well check and see if that seller had posted any more of those Barnyard Buddies. Hoss Hank was hot as hell, now that he was…that he found men were…that his interests were broader. If only he wasn’t so expensive!<br />
<br />
Lost in thought as he was, he didn’t see the truck pull up alongside him until the man leaned out.<br />
<br />
“You doing okay there, boy?” The man in the truck asked, lowering his glasses.<br />
<br />
Chuck blinked, “Uh, no. My car broke down. Aren’t you, like, famous?”<br />
<br />
“Nah, man, I just look like him is all.” The man kept smiling at him and Chuck blushed and looked away.<br />
<br />
“Aw now, don’t be like that.” The man grinned and slapped the side of his truck. “Hop in Tex.”<br />
<br />
“Tex?”<br />
<br />
The man laughed, “Cause you’re as big as Texas!”<br />
<br />
Chuck blushed again and hopped in the passenger side of the rather roomy truck. He set his cellphone down and strapped himself in. The man picked it up, unbeknownst to Chuck, who was too busy struggling to get the buckle to click around his muscles.<br />
<br />
“Where you from, Tex.” The man asked, scrolling through the phone.<br />
<br />
“Nebraska.” Chuck finished buckling up and noticed Sam with his cellphone in his hand. His heart pounded. “Uh, it’s not what you think.”<br />
<br />
“Big Hoss Hank, huh?” The man stared down at his cellphone and chuckled.<br />
<br />
Chuck snatched up the phone. “It’s uh, it’s just an action figure.”<br />
<br />
“You into that stuff?” The man started driving, glancing over at him every once in a while, a sly smile on his face. <br />
<br />
“Yeah but it’s way too expensive for me. The guy making them is supposed to be releasing a new set soon. I wanted him to do a bull.”<br />
<br />
“Fits the theme. Has nothing to do with those ears you’re sporting, does it?”<br />
<br />
Chuck shook his head. “A jock at my school had pink horns and suddenly everyone was into biomodding. I bought in too, but they made fun of me for them.”<br />
<br />
“Wait, biomodding is a thing high schoolers are doing now?” The man shook his head in wonderment and disbelief, “Lordy I’ve been out of the loop.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah.” Chuck swallowed and tried not to cry. “The worst was the girls.”<br />
<br />
“Aw hell, Tex, don’t cry.” The man shook out a handkerchief. “You use that and keep it. Ol’ Sam knows how cruel them slags can be.”<br />
<br />
“Sam?” Chuck said. “Is that your real name?”<br />
<br />
“Is Tex your real name?” Sam smiled.<br />
<br />
“No, but I wish it was.” Chuck said.<br />
<br />
Sam smiled, “Now that’s one wish I can grant. Close your eyes and block your ears.”<br />
<br />
Chuck did as he was told and felt a hand press against his shoulder and-<br />
<br />
-What felt like a second later, he felt a hand shake him gently.<br />
<br />
“You feeling better, Tex?” Sam asked.<br />
<br />
“A lil, sir.” Tex drawled, wondering what had happened. “Sun must’ve gotten tah me.”<br />
<br />
“Good tah hear, big guy.” Sam eyed him, “Don’t mind telling me where you’re from?”<br />
<br />
“Born n’ raised in Texas, yessir.” Tex grinned and placed a piece of hay between his teeth and settled back into his seat.<br />
<br />
“Well hot damn!” Sam slapped the wheel and grinned, “So am I! Now, gotta ask one last thing, just to make sure you’re alright, never mean to imply nothing. You ever been picked on?”<br />
<br />
Tex snorted, “Hell no! Who’d make beef with a guy like me?”<br />
<br />
Sam grinned. “See, told ya I could make you feel better.”<br />
<br />
Tex nodded, wondering what the guy had done. He found himself staring at the man, eyes taking in his ruggedly handsome good looks, slightly weathered skin. He licked his lips, considering asking if the guy wouldn’t mind a blowjob. His cock hardened, making an outline in his overalls. Sam glanced over and laughed.<br />
<br />
“You getting sweet on me boy?” Sam chuckled.<br />
<br />
Tex blushed and sunk into his seat. “N-no.”<br />
<br />
“Aw, I know I’m good looking. You don&#39;t have to lie. But trust me son, you don’t want my tender affections.”<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. You&#39;re straight?&quot; Tex asked, crestfallen, ears drooping.<br />
<br />
“Used to be. But recently, I’ve found that guys can be fun to play with too. In fact, I made Hoss.”<br />
<br />
“What?” Tex asked. Did he mean-<br />
<br />
“That doll you were so interested in. I made him. Prototype’s in the backseat.”<br />
<br />
Tex turned to look and saw the box. Pristine, still in heat wrap. Big Hoss Hank the Horse. His heart raced. No one else could have that, it hadn’t even been released on the mass market! That would mean this guy really was-!<br />
<br />
“Sir, ya gotta know, I’m a real fan of your work!” Tex gushed. “The attention to detail! All those neat options! You know, you’re pretty famous in the online sex community.”<br />
<br />
Sam suddenly looked…uncomfortable. “Well, uh, yeah, I’m pretty okay.”<br />
<br />
“Okay hell, you’re a master! It’s an honor.” Tex blurted. “If I buy one, can you sign it?”<br />
<br />
“Uh…” Sam blinked. “Sure, I guess. You really like it that much?”<br />
<br />
“Dude.” Tex shook his head. “You really don’t know how big a following you have, huh?”<br />
<br />
“I mean, I knew I was pretty notorious in certain circles,” Sam muttered under his breath. “A lot of people are following me.”<br />
<br />
“It’s just so cool to meet you.”<br />
<br />
“Son,” Sam grinned, “It’s been enlightening meeting you. Hey, why do you wanna fuck that horse so much.”<br />
<br />
“It’s not about fucking a horse.” Sam frowned, “He’s like a fantasy creature, really. An exaggeration of a real human being. Something like him doesn’t exist, it’s-”<br />
<br />
Sam held up a hand, “Alright, I think I’m getting it. He’s an easy to understand caricature of the ideal man. Well, one kind, anyways.”<br />
<br />
“Exactly.”<br />
<br />
“I’m glad to meet a fan.” Sam paused, “This might come off as awkward, but you don’t mind if I, uh….”<br />
<br />
Sam gestured at Tex’s head.<br />
<br />
Tex blushed. “Go right ahead. I…you know I don’t mind.”<br />
<br />
Sam leaned over and ruffled his hair, scratching behind his ears. Tex leaned into the touch. The man settled his arm behind Tex’s back. Tex sighed happily.<br />
<br />
“Why do you hide them, anyways.” Sam asked as he gently scratched behind Tex’s ear.<br />
<br />
“Cause people think I’m a freak.” Tex shrugged. “Rather not have tah deal with drama.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, a life without drama sure is nice.” Sam nodded. “But I like to live a bit more dangerously.”<br />
<br />
“I just wanna be useful.” Tex sighed. “That’s why I’m going to this town in Arizona. Apparently there’s people like me there.”<br />
<br />
Sam cocked a bro. “Like, more people with cow parts?”<br />
<br />
“I guess. And other things.” Tex nodded. <br />
<br />
“What city,  if you don’t mind my askin’?”<br />
<br />
Tex shrugged, “Forest Trail.”<br />
<br />
“No kiddin’?” Sam’s eyes widened. “Address?”<br />
<br />
Tex handed him the slip of paper. Sam pulled over and read it. Then he read it again and compared it to his tracking slip on Big Hoss.<br />
<br />
“You didn’t tell me you was headin’ to a sex party, Tex!” Sam seemed excited.<br />
<br />
Tex blushed. “I can tell’em you’re mah plus one.”<br />
<br />
Sam wrapped his arm around Tex’s thick neck. “Boy, don’t you dare leave my side when we get there. I don’t want you getting’ over your head. These kinds of parties are way to dangerous for your young cock.”<br />
<br />
Tex blushed. “I don’t wanna leave you, Sam.”<br />
<br />
Sam’s smile froze for a moment and his eyes searched Tex’s. “You mean it?”<br />
<br />
Tex nodded, face reddening to near purple.<br />
<br />
Sam’s smile turned wry. “Man, I actually believe you too. First one, and it’s a dude. The irony.” <br />
<br />
Sam got out of the car and went to his trunk. Tex heard his fumbling with something, and then he came back with a leather collar and something that rang. Tex stared as the man presented him with a thick leather collar with a brass bell on it. <br />
<br />
“You trust me to put this on you?” Sam asked, eyes gleaming.<br />
<br />
Tex nodded. “I trust you with my life, Sam.”<br />
<br />
Sam nodded. “Yea, that’s the vibe I’m getting’. Lower your head.”<br />
<br />
Tex lowered his head and let Sam strap the leather collar to his beck. Tex stared. Somehow, the bell was engraved with his name. ‘Tex’. His heart swelled and he felt a tear slip down one cheek.<br />
<br />
Sam smiled and wiped away the tear. “Guess I found a partner after all. Let’s go to drop this package off. Then we’ll discuss the next doll in my line. A bull, right?”<br />
<br />
Tex nodded, cock tenting his pants and he did nothing to hide it. <br />
<br />
“Thatta boy, Tex.” Sam nodded at the bulge and placed his hand on it. “You’re mine now, and you don’t gotta hide who you are with me.”<br />
<br />
“Yessir.” Tex drawled happily, wiping away tears. <br />
<br />
Tex tensed as the man gently stroked his thick cock through his overalls, the bell around his neck tinkling gently. His hand fell on the messenger bag with the Book of Body in it, and for a brief moment, he remembered Chuck and his life…and he rejected it, thrusting the Book back firmly in the bag. <br />
<br />
He could feel the Paradox closing in on him, altering his life permanently. Chuck the straight, pudgy loser becoming Big Bad Tex from Texas, star linebacker and a very horny bisexual, his life as a poor city kid shifting to a big eating farm boy. His body altered lightly, chub thickening as the steak and potatoes did their work. <br />
<br />
For a moment or two, he panicked a little, losing his memories and control of his body were scary! He didn&#39;t want to be fat! <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t-&quot; Chex, er, Tuck, said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got you Tex, just relax.&quot; The man didn&#39;t stop despite the little potbelly jiggling out.<br />
<br />
Tex swallowed a burp that smelled like steak and the beer he&#39;d have with his buddies after winning the game and his memories shifted again, and he wasn&#39;t sure he wanted Sam to stop those long rubs anymore because...because...<br />
<br />
Because he started heavy lifting and playing football and his stomach pulled back a little, his muscles thickening in more natural areas, a muscle hump on his neck rising. He loved getting bigger, needed those calories. And he won so many games, everyone loved him. The man&#39;s hand kept stroking and Chuck-Tex let out a moan that sounded a bit like a moo, toes clenching.<br />
<br />
His cock, average-sized, began to grow in the man&#39;s hand. The rubs became longer, more pleasurable, and Tex wanted to beg the man not to stop now. He looked into Sam&#39;s eyes and the man smiled and flicked his bell, making it tinkle. Chex was his. Sam stroked faster now, long rubs, grip tightening. Tex&#39;s life was just so much happier and the man&#39;s hand was so nice, he lost himself in the strokes, let himself relax and let go. Chuck disappeared, stroke, by stroke, lost in a haze of big dinners and heavy weight lifting and football games and the long, gentle rubs Sam gave his cock.<br />
<br />
Tex snorted and came into his overalls hard. <br />
<br />
The man smiled and rubbed his little horns. Tex found himself writhing in pleasure at Sam&#39;s touch, little bell tinkling and when the man removed his hand and placed it around his shoulders, he didn&#39;t bother brushing his hair back in place and just leaned into the arm. He&#39;d found where he belonged.<br />
<br />
The truck drove off, leaving a cloud of dust behind.</p>
