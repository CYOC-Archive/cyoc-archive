<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Heather headed to the school cafeteria and saw Dita talking with Katie, Sharon’s daughter.  Heather moaned inwardly when she realized that Katie would probably want to hear what she had to say, but no, she wasn’t ready to hear it yet.  <br />
<br />
Dita looked up and saw her best friend approaching wearing the same odd expression she had that morning.  Dita waved her over with her wink and shining smile, then excused herself to Katie.<br />
<br />
“Dita, um…wanna walk over to Blimpie?  I’ll buy this time.  What I have to say, I REALLY want to keep between you and me.”<br />
<br />
Oh shit, Dita thought to herself.  What the HELL was going on.<br />
<br />
“Uh, sure girl,” she answered.  Dita waved goodbye to Katie, shrugging apologetically.<br />
<br />
The two teenagers were silent till they were off the campus.  “Dita, I’m sorry that I had to leave Katie out, ‘cause it’ll probably involve her too, before long.  I don’t know.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah?”<br />
<br />
Heather swallowed. “Last night I thought I’d treat myself to a movie, maybe ‘Queen of the Darned’ or something like that.  Dita snickered.  Heather almost never used profanity.  “When I opened the DVD player, there was already a disc there, called ‘Wolf Coven’.”<br />
<br />
“Never heard of it, was it like an indie flick or made long ago?”  <br />
<br />
“Well, I’m not sure what day it was made, but it was a pretty recent home movie.  The camera work was pretty lacking…and Deet, our moms were in it?”<br />
<br />
“….I BEG your pardon!?!”<br />
<br />
“Yes, your mother, my mother, and a lot of other parents we know.”  She slipped her arm around Dita’s.   “They were all wearing robes, and they were doing an initiation rite…for Katie’s mother.”<br />
<br />
Dita shook her head , bewildered.  “They’re witches?”<br />
<br />
“No Dita.  Werewolves.” <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Wendy knew that a promotion might help with the investigation, but she needed to clear it with her superiors. “I’m not sure, can I have some time?” she asked. <br />
<br />
“Wendy, I won’t take ‘no’ for an answer. Join me for lunch and we’ll talk it over.  How does Chinese sound?”<br />
<br />
Wendy shook her head.  “Lisa, I had Chinese for dinner last night…and boy were they mad.”<br />
<br />
Lisa burst out laughing.  “God, that’s horrible.  Girl, you’re gonna do fine here!  Okay then, smartass, how does Papa John’s grab your fancy?”<br />
<br />
The two women drove to the Concord Mall, singing to the 60’s music Lisa and Dita both adored.  “My daughter is a huge fan of Buddy Holly.  I’m not sure if that had anything to do with her wanting to get her pilots license or not.” Both chuckled at the irony.  “What’s her name again,” asked Wendy?  “Dita, I just gave her my maiden name…but no husband now.  What about you?  Are you anyone’s trouble and strife?”<br />
<br />
“No battle axe for me.  I’m not quite ready for a man yet, though…man there are nights when one could come in handy.”  Both smirked.<br />
<br />
Lisa looked off to the side of the road and nearly wrecked the Jeep Cherokee that she had recently paid off.   Speak of the Devil, she thought to herself, it was Dita and Heather walking together.  “Change of plans,” she announced to her passenger.  <br />
<br />
“Werewolves?  Our parents were in a werewolf movie?  Sheesh, how lame is that?  Were the effects any good?”  The last statements of Dita came accompanied with a sharp burst of laughter and an embarrassed groan.<br />
<br />
“Oh….Oh yeah.  Dita, I think you’ll agree that the “effects” were top of the line.  In fact, you will want to see it several times.”<br />
A blast from a car horn startled both girls.<br />
<br />
“Mommy!!” Dita squeaked cheerfully, running up to the SUV and planting a kiss on her mom’s cheek.<br />
<br />
“Hi there ladies.  Walking to lunch, I presume?”<br />
<br />
Heather was stunned at the turn of events, but managed to keep her composure.  “Hi Lisa.  I was just taking Dita to Blimpie for lunch.”<br />
<br />
“GREAT!  Hop on in, we’ll give you a lift.  Er, Lisa, would you rather try Blimpies, or maybe the girls would like Papa John’s??”<br />
After a few moments of frustratingly unassertive debate the four decided on the healthy alternative and headed to Blimpie.  <br />
<br />
“So Dita, your Mom tells me you’re working on your pilot license?”<br />
“I just have 14 hours, Miss Patel.  I still have to solo.”<br />
<br />
Heather snorted.  “Wish MY mother would let ME fly!”<br />
<br />
Wendy was bitterly sympathetic, she had been in Navy ROTC, but had missed her aviator slot by a couple grade point fractions.  “Don’t worry girls, there are ways, and call me Wendy” <br />
<br />
Lunch was delicious but frustrating to Heather, she had so much to tell Dita.  As the top of the hour drew closer, Lisa excused herself and motioned Heather to come with her.  They stepped outside.<br />
<br />
“Heather, do you know what I want to speak to you about?”  Heather shook her head wordlessly.  “I’ll give you a hint; your mother called me shortly after she dropped you off.”<br />
<br />
Oh.<br />
<br />
“It’s been one hell of a day for you hasn’t it, honey? What have you told Dita so far?”<br />
<br />
“Well…we got to the point where she asked about the special effects on the video.”<br />
<br />
“Excellent.  Heather, for the time being I want you to tell her nothing more.  Tell her that I want her to wait till tomorrow evening.  The four of us are going to be getting together tomorrow night for a sleepover.”  Lisa hugged Heather tightly.  “I love you like my own daughter, Heather, but do you have any idea who I am?”<br />
<br />
“Uh, the maternal parent of the best friend in the whole world to me?”<br />
<br />
“I am also the leader of a coven of werewolves, of which you will soon join.  As a pack leader, my authority and power over the pack is absolute…even past your eighteenth birthday.  Lisa embraced Heather again.  “A small taste of this power…”  Lisa kissed her deeply.  <br />
<br />
Heather’s eyes widened as she felt an overwhelming pleasure and warmth around her vagina, soon joined by a strange but wonderful tickling sensation in her armpits and around her thighs and abdomen.  Lisa released her, stroking Heather’s hair.  “Don’t worry.  I run a very relaxed ship.  You’ll do fine.  But remember what I said.  Hope you’ve already had gym today,” she chuckled.<br />
<br />
With only ten minutes to get back to class, Lisa drove the girls back to Reitz High School in record time.  Wendy raised an eyebrow at Lisa dexterity.  “Have a good rest of the day, you two!!”<br />
<br />
Heather waved but frowned.  There was a strange fullness under her arms and in her pants.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
“Good lunch!” Wendy exclaimed.  “Could I ask what you needed to talk to Heather about?”<br />
<br />
“Sure,” said Lisa cheerily.  “But not just yet.  We need to stop over at my house for a bit.”<br />
<br />
As they drove to Lisa’s home, Lisa decided to open the interview.  “Like I said Wendy, I really have been impressed with your work.  One thing though, you mentioned to Dita that you’d been in the Navy, but you didn’t say anything about it on your resume or your application, just that you were in physical fitness.”<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry.  I know a lot of people are put off by military service, so I figured that I’d just put my job description rather than who I was working for.”  Lisa frowned, putting a hand on the younger woman’s shoulder.  “Be PROUD of what you did.  What exactly was your role in the Navy?”<br />
<br />
“I left as a Lieutenant, a um…weapons officer.”<br />
<br />
“Really?  Not intelligence or security?  Sorry, you struck me as the type?”  They pulled into Lisa’s driveway.  “Ok, Wendy, here we are!  Come on in, and lets get this over with.<br />
<br />
“God, nice house”, said Wendy.   “Well THANK you.  Of course, when you divorce money, it’s often more lucrative than marrying it.  Sit down…please.”<br />
<br />
Wendy did so, her muscular but petite frame sinking into the soft leather of the loveseat.  Lisa pulled up another chair, resting her elbows on the armrest of the loveseat.  She smiled sweetly at her guest.<br />
<br />
“All right then.  Wendy, you asked me what I had wanted to talk to Heather about outside.  My daughter doesn’t know it yet, but both Heather and Dita have a…condition that I don’t want the general public to know about.  I insisted that Heather refrain from telling Dita more till tomorrow night till her mother and I could explain it more fully.”<br />
<br />
Wendy was stunned.  Lisa was really opening up.  “How bad is this condition?  Will it hurt their futures?”<br />
<br />
“Possibly.  Dita had mentioned the Air Force Academy as a possible school after graduation.  It may be too inconvenient with her situation.”  “Tell me,” Lisa asked brightly. “How would the accommodating would the FBI be if you had to be absent for three days every month?”</p>
