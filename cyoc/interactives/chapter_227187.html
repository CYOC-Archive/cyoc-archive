<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As reality came back into focus, Josh&#39;s vision was greeted by a copy of his body staring back at him, completely naked.  Josh, being a straight guy, was immediately off-put by the sight of a naked dude, even if it was a copy of his own.<br />
<br />
Anna, now in that body, noticed Josh&#39;s expression, and was immediately concerned.  &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;  Then, realizing that her voice sounded different, she immediately covered her mouth for a moment.  Then, releasing it, &quot;Was that me?  Oh my gosh, what happened to my voice?&quot;  She then looked down.  &quot;Where are my breasts?!&quot;  Anna rushed over to the floor-length mirror.  &quot;Why am I you?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh was now staring at what was effectively his own butt, something he had never seen before firsthand.  And it was just as uncomfortable to see as the penis that now dangled from his fiancé&#39;s crotch.  In a panic, he focused on going back into the white room.  With time being frozen while in the room, he had a chance to collect himself.  While he knew Anna would now be a comfortable nudist, he didn&#39;t expect reality to automatically whisk away her clothes.<br />
<br />
After a few moments, he started to feel guilty.  He specifically left Anna&#39;s sexuality the same so she could still be attracted to him, but he himself did not share the sentiment.  So, opening his own profile, he changes his own sexuality to &quot;bi&quot;.  Then, he hit the &quot;exit&quot; panel, returning to reality.<br />
<br />
Looking at Anna&#39;s male butt again, he was relieved to discover that it was a pretty nice butt.  A small part of him was actually proud to have a butt just like it.<br />
<br />
Anna turned back toward him, her maleness on full display.  &quot;Okay, I guess you CAN change other people.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh looked at her penis and smiled.  &quot;Yes, and thensome.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What, you haven&#39;t noticed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Noticed what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That you&#39;re naked.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna looked down at herself.  &quot;Oh, wow, you&#39;re right.  Weird, I feel so comfortable being naked, I didn&#39;t even notice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s because I changed you mentally, just like the VIP thing said I could.  You&#39;re now a full-time nudist!&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna looked at Josh worryingly.  &quot;You altered my mind?  You can really do that?  You didn&#39;t change anything else, did you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh held up his hands.  &quot;No, no, I like you for who you are, I ain&#39;t changing that.  I just made that one change to prove what I&#39;m capable of.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Proof made.  So, out of curiosity, where are my clothes?&quot;<br />
<br />
The two of them looked around the room, and made a few discoveries.  First, there was now only one suitcase in the room -- Josh&#39;s.  That means that either the two now share the same wardrobe, or the nudist no longer has clothes to wear.  Second, instead of one large bed, there were now two smaller beds.  Third, Anna still had a purse.  Curious what else changed, Anna grabbed her purse, and reached for her ID.  &quot;&#39;Andrew Home&#39;?  You mean we&#39;re actually twin brothers, for real?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For real!  As far as anyone is aware, we&#39;ve always been brothers, not fiancés.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew seemed hurt.  &quot;We&#39;re not fiancés, anymore?  Don&#39;t you love me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh panicked.  &quot;Of course I do!  It&#39;s just that, while we&#39;re brothers, it would be awkward if we were also fiancés, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew thought for a moment, then answered dejectedly, &quot;I guess so.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh felt bad, again.  He had honestly thought that Andrew would love being in his body.  He wondered if he should change her back to normal.<br />
<br />
While Josh was thinking this, Andrew walked back to the mirror.  Josh was right about one thing -- despite now being a male nude, she still felt like herself.  She still felt like a &quot;she&quot;.  And even if they can&#39;t be fiancés officially, she still found that she loved Josh.  She smiled at her reflection, before catching herself.  The person in the reflection may look like Josh, but it isn&#39;t actually him.  It&#39;s her.  She&#39;s got a body just like his.<br />
<br />
Reaching down, she cupped her ballsack in her hand.  It was real.  She could feel the testicles in the sack.  She could feel her hand holding her ballsack.  She let go, and lifted up her penis with a finger.  Then, she let it flop down.  She gasped in wonder, at the feeling of her penis flopping down onto her ballsack.  She started walking around, marvelled at the feeling of her male privates bouncing between her legs.  So many times, she had walked around with a strap-on dangling between her legs during roleplay.  But this was way better than the dead piece of plastic she was using before!<br />
<br />
She turned toward Josh.  &quot;Okay, I forgive you.  This is actually kind of neat.&quot;  She walked up to him and gave him a kiss on the cheek.  Josh welcomed the kiss, even despite it coming from a dude.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, but I wonder,&quot; Andrew thought aloud.  &quot;What about my friends?  I know I can change back to normal before we leave the resort, but Yuki, Sasha, and Maya will be here later today.  And then Heather tomorrow.  Are they still my friends?&quot;  She went back to her purse, and pulled out her phone to check her contacts.  Finding them there, she also checks her messages.  &quot;Okay, they&#39;re still my friends, I think, and they&#39;re still coming.  Also, my mom and dad&#39;s numbers are different?&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew handed her phone to Josh to show him.  Josh recognized the numbers.  &quot;Those are the numbers for *my* mom and dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, you mean your parents are now *my* parents?&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh nodded.<br />
<br />
Andrew smirked.  &quot;Good thing this is temporary, then.  Speaking of, how about we go out and enjoy this?  We could go to one of the different wings, and experience each of their transformations.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?  With my VIP powers, we can undergo all the transformations we want right here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, but I wanna see the stores and attractions.  Also get a bite to eat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh thought for a moment.  &quot;You go on ahead.  I wanna stick around and consider my options.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright.&quot;  And so Andrew casually left their room, in all her naked male glory.  Josh chuckled a bit.  It&#39;s a good thing this is a clothing-optional resort.  He assumed this was because various transformations may not be clothing-friendly.<br />
<br />
Josh stepped out onto their small balcony, looking at all the people out in the courtyard.  People of all sorts of sizes, ages, and species.  There were more than a few furries down there.  He noticed one guest carting around a potted plant, and wondered if the plant was also a guest.  Looking into the pool, and seeing people play with various beach toys, he suddenly realized that any number of objects down there could secretly be guests.<br />
<br />
Regardless of who&#39;s what, there was a lot of potential for fun.  Thanks to his VIP status, he could transform any of them in any way he wanted.  Although, he hasn&#39;t yet granted a transformation to himself.  Why let everyone else have fun without him?</p>
