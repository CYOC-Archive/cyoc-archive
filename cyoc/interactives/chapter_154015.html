<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Freddy thought about it for a moment and determined that it was best not to stay in the living room. The scene before him was beginning to turn him on. Sofya stripped off her clothes and exposed her ample breasts and smooth vagina. The other boys followed her and stripped off into their birthday suits. <br />
<br />
Fido could smell them on his sensitive nose. He could smell Sofya’s vagina and underarms wafting off an odor designed to attract mates. While the boys were subconsciously affected by it as they kissed and pawed at Sofya, Fido could smell the aroma smack him across the face, as his penis emerged from his sheath. It didn’t help that the manly, testosterone laden scent of the four male athletes turned him on as well.<br />
<br />
Whining before he trotted away, Fido headed to the kitchen area. He felt his exposed his tip waving through the air. While he was far enough way from them not to take in the sight of the orgy unfolding on the living room couch, he could still hear them going at it with his sensitive ears and smelled the overpowering aroma of sex on his nose. <br />
<br />
Trying to ignore this as best as he could, Fido laid down on the floor of the entryway that divided the living room from the kitchen. He shifted the attention of his ears to the conversation between Daniel and Duane talking place in the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“What’s up with you today man?” Duane asked Daniel.<br />
<br />
“What do you mean?” he replied incredulously. <br />
<br />
“You know what I mean. Don’t play stupid. You’ve been acting like a bigger piece of shit than usual.”<br />
<br />
“What did I say?”<br />
<br />
“You know what you’ve been saying. Don’t play dumb. You’ve been viciously going after kids in our school to the point where it crossed way over the line. You were saying all sorts of racist shit about that Indian girl and her friends and you went way over the line in what you said about Fred.”<br />
<br />
“I know you too well, Duane. You couldn’t give one iota of a shit about what I had to say about those nerdy school shooter losers. All you care about is that I was talking smack about Fred and you know it.”<br />
<br />
Duane paused for a moment, realizing that Daniel had a point. As ashamed as he was to admit it to himself, he didn’t really care all that much about the other kids that they had made fun of. <br />
<br />
“Besides” Daniel continued “I don’t see why you care so much. It’s not like I said anything that we haven’t all discussed before in the past.”<br />
<br />
“It’s going too far, Daniel. It’s going way over the line of harmless smack talk and right into straight on bullying.”<br />
<br />
“What about what I said wasn’t true?”<br />
<br />
“For starters, that you don’t think Fred is tougher than you are.”<br />
<br />
“He’s not, though!”<br />
<br />
Fido growled as he stared at Daniel, anger appearing on his doggy features. <br />
<br />
“Of course he is, Daniel” Duane replied. “And might I remind you, if I hadn’t been able to talk some sense into Fred on Thursday at lunch, he’d probably have choked your ass to death.”<br />
<br />
“Wow” Freddy thought to himself. “I can’t believe it. I’m so glad that Duane is actually standing up for me. Not that I deserve it, but it’s nice to know at least one of my friends isn’t a complete piece of shit. I wonder how Michael is reacting to this. I know he has to be listening in on this because he’s not the type of person to want to hear Sofya getting it on with a bunch of other boys. I know for a fact that he bugged that crevice in the kitchen cabinet.”<br />
<br />
“Hmmm” Michael thought to himself, as he listened in to the conversation taking place in the kitchen, proving Freddy right. “That Duane isn’t so bad after all. Though I’d feel a lot better about him if he actually stood up for me as well. At least it confirms that Freddy wasn’t lying when he said that he stood up for me after I left him with his team alone at lunch on Thursday. That’s a relief, for sure.”<br />
<br />
“Well” Daniel said, as the conversation between him and Duane continued on “it’s not like Fred played fair. He just lunged at me unexpectedly and completely caught me off guard. That’s not how gentleman fight. In a one on one setting, I’d totally kick his ass.”<br />
<br />
“That may be so” Duane replied “but you totally set him off with all of those nasty things you were saying about him and Michael.”<br />
<br />
“It’s only things we’ve ever said a million times before and Fred knows this.”<br />
<br />
“But Michael was around. That’s not bro code. We don’t go saying these things when the person we’re talking about is around and listening in. We talk behind their backs, not right to their faces.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know, Duane. That seems pretty cowardly if you ask me. If you really feel something strongly about someone, then why hide it from them?”<br />
<br />
“Because it’s not nice and much of it is just not true.”<br />
<br />
“What part of what we talk smack about isn’t true?”<br />
<br />
“For starters, Fred is not a big pussy. He nearly choked your life out and it’s not the first time you two were ready to go blows.”<br />
<br />
“Oh God” Michael thought to himself as he listened in. “Freddy really needs to get his anger under control.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know why you were so insistent on holding us back” Daniel replied dismissively. “It’s good for men sometimes to let their feelings out sometimes. Take it out on each other with their fists.”<br />
<br />
“Well” Duane replied “part of it is that I didn’t want the cops to get involved. I’m black and the police around aren’t always so friendly to me.”<br />
<br />
“It wouldn’t be your fault, though. We’d vouch for you.”<br />
<br />
“Still, it’s a risk that I’d rather not take. And secondly, I think that, deep down, you’re really just jealous that Fred has such a great relationship with Michael.”<br />
<br />
“Their relationship ain’t so great, Duane. You heard what Sofya said. They’ve been on edge for a while and he was about to get it on with her until Michael showed up unannounced at her house on Wednesday. Which, by the way, aren’t you bothered by the fact that Fred missed practice on Monday and it turns out he wasn’t really sick after all? I mean, what a dick move on his end. He knows that the state championships are coming up soon and we need all the practice we can get. To just go abandon us now and run off to see some new girl who, by the way, isn’t so special, and fuck her behind Michael’s back when we need him at practice, is a real dick move. You know that, right Duane?”<br />
<br />
“Maybe Fred is dealing with some shit we don’t know about. And maybe he and Michael are dealing with some problems right now, but we don’t know and maybe he needed time off to work that shit out.”<br />
<br />
“I think their big problem, Duane, is that Michael suffocates him so much and makes Fred spend way too much time with him. And God forbid anyone try to take him away from him for a while, Michael goes all weepy eyed and storms off in a huff. You saw it. That’s what set Fred off on Thursday. His boyfriend started crying because God forbid we wanted to catch him up to speed on what we’re doing to prepare for the state championship race. I mean, does that sound like a healthy relationship to you, Duane?”<br />
<br />
Both Fido and Michael, listening in on the bug line, fell completely silent. As much as both boys didn’t want to admit it, each felt a sense that Daniel had a point to make. Even if they now both agreed that he was a total piece of shit, both of them reluctantly admitted that there was some truth to what he was saying. <br />
<br />
“How do you know what a healthy relationship looks like, Daniel?” Duane asked. “You’ve never had a serious relationship before.”<br />
<br />
“If I wanted one” Daniel replied “I could have one. And, in fact, I did have one last year.”<br />
<br />
“And how did that work out for you, exactly? She left you in a huff and said you never gave her the time of day. We all heard it, Daniel. Don’t try to pretend we didn’t see her coming up to us at lunch and reaming you a new asshole in front of the whole team.”<br />
<br />
“She was too clingy, you know. Janet wanted to spend way too much time with me and I wasn’t really all that interested in spending any time with her. I thought I was being reasonable by meeting her half way, but evidently, that wasn’t enough for her. I can’t have a girl down my jock all the time, Duane. I’m not Fred.”<br />
<br />
Fido barked as he got up from his laid down position and trotted into the kitchen. He stood a few feet away from the boys as they continued talking. <br />
<br />
“Daniel” Duane continued “be honest with yourself. You don’t really care all that much about women as people. Sure, you like to go around and bang girls, but you never want to spend any quality time with someone who isn’t one of your bros. You bang them and leave. You can’t expect to maintain a happy relationship with any woman having an attitude like that.”<br />
<br />
“Where’s your girlfriend, Duane? You talk like you know how to treat a woman and be in a relationship and yet I don’t see any girl on your arm these days.”<br />
<br />
“I do have someone I’m seeing, Daniel.”<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah? Then where is this mysterious woman if you’re actually seeing somebody? How come we haven’t heard about her before? How come we’ve never met her?”<br />
<br />
“Because it’s none of your God damn business.”<br />
<br />
“Is it because she doesn’t actually exist?”<br />
<br />
“No!” Duane snapped. <br />
<br />
Daniel looked at him nervously, while Fido stood watching, standing on the floor below them in silence. <br />
<br />
“It’s because” he continued “I’m just starting to get to know her and I don’t want what you guys might say about her to poison her mind before I have a chance to build trust with her.”<br />
<br />
“What trust is there to build?” Daniel asked. “Either you like the bitch or you don’t.”<br />
<br />
“See, there you go. This is why I don’t want to introduce her to you guys just yet. I don’t need you calling her a bitch and making all kinds of nasty remarks while she’s around.”<br />
<br />
“What are you afraid of, Duane? Are you dating some ugly dumpster chick like Diya and you’re embarrassed about us finding out about it?”<br />
<br />
Fido growled upon hearing this comment. <br />
<br />
“No, Daniel!” Duane snapped. “She’s not some ugly chick. She actually happens to be a smoking hot babe from the next town over. But even if I were dating some chick who looked like Diya, do you think that I would, in my right mind, introduce her to you or tell you anything about her. What do you think the other guys would say about that?”<br />
<br />
“They&#39;d say that you’re crazy and they’d be right.”<br />
<br />
“And speaking of which, Daniel, that was some really racist shit that you said about Diya back there with the other guys. The stuff about her house smelling like curry and her parents wanting to marry her off to her brother was so incredibly offensive, that I can’t believe you all said it and then had the nerve to laugh about it like it some great big joke!”<br />
<br />
“It’s not a big deal, Duane. Calm down.”<br />
<br />
“No you calm down, you fucking stupid oaf. You seem to keep forgetting something in all of this and it baffles me that you don’t know what it is.”<br />
<br />
“What could it possibly be? That you have a fetish for ugly chicks? That you and Fred are gay together?”<br />
<br />
“That I’m black you fucking ignorant piece of shit!”<br />
<br />
Daniel looked on in silence as Duane’s face showed extreme amounts of rage. Fido laid back down as he looked up at Duane. <br />
<br />
“I’m black!” he continued. “I’m black! I’m blackity black black black! I’m black and I don’t like you making those racist comments about other minority groups in my presence.”<br />
<br />
“Oh” Daniel said as he pushed Duane back aggressively. “So it’s ok that we make all those other comments about people like how they’re ugly or whores or poor, but God forbid we talk about someone’s race, that crosses the line?”<br />
<br />
“Daniel….”<br />
<br />
“You’re a big hypocrite, you know that Duane? It’s ok for us to talk smack about other people, and you know you’ve had your fair share to say about Fred and the others….”<br />
<br />
Fido looked up, concerned about what his friend may have said about him behind his back. Unfortunately for Freddy, that wouldn’t be revealed at that time. <br />
<br />
“…but God forbid we touch upon a sore subject for you, like race, that goes too far. It’s not cool, Duane. It makes you a big giant pussy just like Fred.”<br />
<br />
Fido growled as he stood up again and bore his teeth at Daniel. <br />
<br />
“Either you’re all in on the ridicule and teasing” Daniel continued “or you should shut the fuck up. Either everything is fair game or nothing is.”<br />
<br />
“It’s not that black and white, Daniel” Duane replied. <br />
<br />
“See, there you go again making this all about race.”<br />
<br />
Duane lunged at Daniel and held him up against the wall. Daniel looked down at Duane in fear of his friend. <br />
<br />
“You better shut your God damn fucking mouth right now, Daniel. If you don’t zip it, then I’ll drag you outside this kitchen door and beat your fucking ass in to Sofya’s lawn. You can cry like a little child as much as you want, but Fred’s not the only one who is stronger than you.”<br />
<br />
“You do that…” Daniel replied as he began to compose himself, still held tight by Duane’s grasp “and I call the cops.”<br />
<br />
Duane paused for a moment, before deciding to let Daniel back down onto the floor. Fido’s baring teeth all out in rage. With a loud growling sound, he was ready to do what he needed to to defend his friend Duane from the piece of shit captain of their track and field team. <br />
<br />
“And this is why I never let you and Fred get into it to the point of calling the cops” Duane remarked to Daniel with a scowl on his face.<br />
<br />
Daniel looked on nervously as Duane composed himself enough to continue talking. <br />
<br />
“I’ve been thinking it over, recently, and Fred kind of has a point. You are a big piece of shit, Daniel, and he was right to go after you on Thursday the way that he did. My only mistake, in hindsight, was trying to save him from being suspended from school because I knew if he let lose, like he wanted to and was ready to, then you’d end up in a coma in the hospital.”<br />
<br />
Duane paused for a moment to let the words sink in to Daniel’s head. After a time passed, he continued. <br />
<br />
“He may be one of my best friends, Daniel. You don’t have a best friend because no one wants to spend more than a second with you in any personal capacity. I realize, in hindsight, that maybe I shouldn’t have joined in so much when we could get a bit vicious when talking about the other kids at school. But you know what, as the only black guy in the school, I really just wanted to fit in and didn’t want to do anything to stand up for somebody else. The only reason I don’t hang out with kids like Michael and Diya and their other nerdy friends is….”<br />
<br />
Duane paused before he revealed an uncomfortable truth.<br />
<br />
“Besides how nerdy and annoying they can be….”<br />
<br />
“Wonderful” Michael thought to himself sarcastically, as he listened in from his room. <br />
<br />
“….is that I didn’t want to be outcasts like they were. I had so much going against me to leave me iced out at school as it was. I’m black, I’m not rich, though my family isn’t poor by any means, but I’m a great athlete….”<br />
<br />
“Not better than me” Daniel replied snidely.<br />
<br />
Duane glared at Daniel before speaking again.<br />
<br />
“As I was saying, I’m a great athlete and I consider myself to be a guy’s guy. That’s the only thing that kept me in the good graces of a good posse of peeps and at the top of the social hierarchy at school. I didn’t want to risk all that for some nerds I never really liked in the first place. I wanted to feel like I belonged.”<br />
<br />
Duane paused again, taking a second to compose himself before continuing. <br />
<br />
“I wanted to feel like I had a good group of homies, but like, it’s not worth it to hang out with you anymore. Not all of the guys on our team are so bad. Fred, for example, is a good guy. He’s the best runner on our team and I get razzed about that constantly. Like, ‘Duane, how is it that a white guy is a better runner than you?’ But he is and I admire the fact that he and Michael have such a great relationship together. Maybe they’re having a rough patch right now, but I believe that they will work through it like all great partnerships do. And no matter what the other guys may say about it, I’m going to support them. Michael makes Fred happy and that makes me happy.”<br />
<br />
Fido shed a tear as he listened to his friend vouch for him. He felt joy that at least someone had his back when he wasn’t around. When this was all over, at least he had one friend left who actually cared about him. Based on what Duane said, he may still have the other track and field teammates as well. His world wasn’t going to fall apart after all, though he didn’t mind if it did as long as he could stay with Michael.<br />
<br />
Michael processed this revelation in his room as well. Sure, he and Duane were never going to be tight, but at least he treated Freddy well and stood up for him to Daniel. That, plus the fact that he was beginning to see what a piece of shit Daniel really was, and acknowledged that he had overlooked it in the past, made him alright in his book. <br />
<br />
“Diya and Freddy are never going to be best friends” Michael thought to himself. “It’s ok if Duane and I aren’t either.”<br />
<br />
Duane and Daniel stood in awkward silence as a hush fell over the room. Finally, Daniel sarcastically clapped as he looked on to a rage filled Duane. <br />
<br />
“Bravo, Duane!” he yelled sarcastically. “Bravo. It’s official. You have joined your friend Fred in being Michael’s little pets.”<br />
<br />
“Daniel….” Duane sneered. <br />
<br />
Fido growled as he barked and looked angrily at Daniel.<br />
<br />
“Aw, what’s the matter, you stray mutt?” Daniel asked sarcastically, as he turned to look down at a visibly angry Fido. “You want to be Michael’s little pet, too?”<br />
<br />
Losing all restraint, Fido began to bark loudly as he lunged up at Daniel. Daniel covered his chest as Fido dug his fangs into his arm. <br />
<br />
“Ow!!!!!!” Daniel yelled in incredible pain, as he tried to shake Fido off of him to no avail. “Get this dog off of me! Duane!”<br />
<br />
“Woah, holy shit” Duane replied as he saw Daniel rushing into the living room.<br />
<br />
While the two boys were having their discussion, Sofya had been getting it on with their other friends in the living room. The all American baseball player was under her on the couch as he pounded away at her vagina. The hairy beast of a football player, who, despite being only 17, turning 18 in a few months, had the body of a full grown adult, was fucking her rapidly in her ass. He gripped to her tightly, while trying to avoid looking at the baseball player fucking her vagina below him. From above, the baby faced football player was jacking off, occasionally putting his cock in Sofya’s mouth for a brief suck. In a chair across from them, the other football player, not as attractive as the other guys, beat his meat rapidly, extremely turned on by what he was seeing before him.<br />
<br />
The hairy football player orgasmed and ejaculated into Sofya first, coating the inside of her asshole with his ample sperm. When he came, this caused Sofya to moan as she felt an orgasm build deep within her. The contracting muscles in her vagina proved too much for the baseball player to handle, as he moaned loudly and shot the biggest load of his life into her inviting vagina. The scene proved too much for the baby faced football player who moved his penis into Sofya’s ample cleavage and shot his sticky load of creamy, white cum right down her chest. Sofya swiped a bit of his dripping seed from her bosom and licked it up erotically into her mouth from her finger with her tongue. <br />
<br />
Before the other football player, who suffered from erectile dysfunction, could blow his own load, they heard Daniel’s yelling as he entered the room, seeing Fido gnawing into his arm.<br />
<br />
“Ow!!!!!!” Daniel yelled at the top of his lungs. “Sofya! Get your dog off of me!”<br />
<br />
“Oh my” Sofya said with concern in her voice.<br />
<br />
She pushed the hairy football player off of her back as she got up and removed herself from the baseball player&#39;s still erect cock. Boy cum dripped down her legs from her vagina and her asshole. Sofya made her way over to Fido and began to smack the dog&#39;s back viciously. <br />
<br />
“Bad dog! Bad dog! Get off of him right now or I’m calling the pound!”<br />
<br />
Fido whimpered as he eased his grip on Daniel&#39;s arm and was thrown to the ground in rage. He caught himself on four legs gracefully, with blood dripping off of his teeth and into his mouth. Daniel cried out in agony as he looked to his arm, seeing large bite marks gushing with blood from the punctured wounds. <br />
<br />
“Oh my God!” Daniel yelled.<br />
<br />
“Woah Daniel” Duane said as he saw the bloody bite marks. “Yo Sofya, do you have something we can wrap his arm around?”<br />
<br />
“Maybe we should call a doctor” Sofya replied cautiously, showing genuine concern for Daniel’s severe injury. <br />
<br />
As Fido tried his best to ignore his friends and Sofya going over the injury he caused with his now bloody teeth, he looked to the other boys, who looked on at the scene before them in shock and disbelief. Though most of the other boys didn&#39;t do it for him, Fido noticed the hairy football player sitting on the couch, looking at Daniel in silence. The sight of his naked, furry body caused a movement in Fido’s member as he looked down to see his penis slink out of his sheath. <br />
<br />
The hairy football player turned Freddy on very much. Even though he was only 17, soon to be turning 18, he had a big, hulking frame of a linebacker and the body hair pattern of a 35 year old man. He had never seen a boy that age who was as hairy as the football player sitting on the couch before him. Hair covered his entire chest in a swath of brown fur, with ample pubic and underarm growth and a thick coating on his beefy legs. Unlike other boys his age, he had the starts of what would become a hairy back, which would soon become as thick as a Gorilla&#39;s hide. The hairy football player always had a sexy, five o clock shadow. One time, Freddy heard that the hairy football player could grow a full beard in under a week. <br />
<br />
This man was driving him crazy. If Fido didn’t leave the room soon, he’d want to lick his penis and ejaculate right there on the spot. If he did that, and turned back into Freddy right there in the living room, in front of his friends and Sofya, he’d be in big trouble. The entire operation would be compromised as his cover would be blown. Before he could give into his canine urges, however, a loud bang could be heard, signaling that the front door had swung right open. <br />
<br />
When the room of teenagers and Fido turned to the front entrance, they could see….</p>
