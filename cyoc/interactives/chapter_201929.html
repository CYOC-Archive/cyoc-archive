<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I watched Kelly, wary and excited, as she prepared to put the ring to use. Obviously excited herself, she took a deep breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;First: I wish that I can shift whenever I want, no more gradual phases or trigger words. I wish to freely go from this body, to a more anthro one, to a full wolf form, and to my old human form.&quot; Her breath shuddered as she felt the tingle of the magic settle in her.<br />
<br />
&quot;And second...&quot; My only warning was a slight widening of her grin before she pounced me, her bulk easily bearing me to the ground. For a few seconds her body was heavy atop mine, threatening to crush me into the grass even as the soft spreading of her furry breasts over me drove me crazy. Then she reared back onto her knees.<br />
<br />
I found myself on my back, staring up wide-eyed as she knelt over me, one leg to either side of my own. I squirmed uncomfortably as her hot, strong-smelling juices dripped from her bestial pussy onto my own groin. Despite myself, I could feel my cock clench and push rhythmically against my fly, seeking escape from its tight, wet prison.<br />
<br />
&quot;K-Kelly...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone&#39;s been a <i>bad</i> little boy.&quot; She leaned forward, and tickled my nose with the tip of her forefinger claw. My eyes crossed as I fearfully focused on it. &quot;You used that trigger phrase on me after we agreed there would be <i>no cheating.</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
I shook my head, pulling my eyes from the lethal digit to look pleadingly into her predatory gaze. &quot;Th-that&#39;s -- that wasn&#39;t cheating! I didn&#39;t use the ring!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, <i>I</i> think it was cheating, and <i>I</i> make the rules,&quot; she replied smugly. &quot;So, as a punishment, you don&#39;t get any say in the changes I&#39;m going to make, until I decide otherwise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ch-changes?&quot; I gulped. I was definitely regretting giving her the ring now. And yet... and yet... I couldn&#39;t help but anticipate what she was going to do to me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmhm. First, let&#39;s get rid of these clothes. I wish Joe was naked.&quot;<br />
<br />
And suddenly I was. &quot;Ahhh!&quot; I couldn&#39;t help but exclaim as my cock sprang free just in time for a fat drop of her hot juices to plop directly on the head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh, so eager for your punishment? What a naughty, kinky slut you are, Joseph.&quot; She pushed her claw into my nose a bit, dimpling it without breaking the skin. She wiggled it around, and then pulled it back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then...&quot; She licked her lips. &quot;Next to being a werewolf... there&#39;s something I&#39;ve wondered about for a long time...&quot;<br />
<br />
She touched the head of my dick, then moved her hand down and closed her fingers around it. My rod completely disappeared inside her paw, pulsing urgently, unable to move.<br />
<br />
&quot;What it&#39;s like to have a cock. So...&quot; She squeezed gently, and I whined in need, trembling, afraid to move at all lest it damage my tender little organ. Well -- it <i>wasn&#39;t</i> little... it just seemed like it in her grip. My unease was increasing as my tormented mind began to put together what she was saying. Not quickly enough however, as her wish still caught me completely off guard.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish that our genitals would be exchanged.&quot;<br />
<br />
<I>WHAT.</i> My attempt to protest, to question this came out as a strangled squeak as, just like that, the sensation of her hand on my cock vanished. In place of that hard extension I felt something spread apart, opening up a passage that ran so deep inside me that I felt like my soul had been exposed. At the same time, I saw my cock and balls appear on Kelly&#39;s groin, making me blink at the abrupt change.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhh... K-K-K... Kelly...&quot; I dug my hands into the grass, clenching at the sod as my hips bucked. But she was lost in her own change, a half-stifled grunt pushing form her maw.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nnnn...&quot; She had lifted her now empty hand from me to cradle her new ballsack. Although it was somewhat larger, it was still unmistakably mine -- incongruously human and still rather too small for her bestial frame. My stomach flip-flopped as, looking down, I confirmed that my dick was gone, replaced by a mound split by a puffy wolf&#39;s vagina. As with my equipment on her, it had shifted a little to fit, but it was still absurdly large.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhhh...&quot; I wavered. I could feel myself beginning to panic. In contrast, Kelly snorted with laughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not quite what I had in mind! I guess I need to be a little more specific. I wish our new genitals would change to match our bodies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;U-uh...&quot; I couldn&#39;t help but be a little relieved as I watched the triangular patch of black flesh shrink and narrow down into a pink, human slit. It looked good -- or it would have on someone ELSE&#39;S body. I didn&#39;t want to have a pussy! And I was really starting to get worried...<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Eyes on <i>me,</i> pup.&quot; I felt Kelly&#39;s claw, on my chin this time, urging me to look up at had transpired with <i>her</i> loins.<br />
<br />
...About where this was headed. <i>Shit!</i> The sight of that thing! Now I was <i>really</i> worried -- and also, again, really aroused. I couldn&#39;t tell the fear fluttering in my belly from my lust any more. I felt so helpless beneath that organ -- I mean, beneath her -- and I fucking loved it. I flushed, ashamed at enjoying this emasculation, but... damn it...!<br />
<br />
<i>Shit...</i><br />
<br />
~~~ <b>Kelly</b> ~~~<br />
<br />
When I wished for our genitals to switch, the change had been instantaneous. While the sudden shock of testosterone to my system had been fun, I much preferred time to savour the change.<br />
<br />
Thus I growled in deep pleasure as I felt Joe&#39;s measly human cock begin to swell with lupine virility. His balls -- MY balls! -- grew heavier and heavier, chicken egg-sized seed factories filling with puppy batter. The human skin pulled back from the round tip, becoming MY grey-furred sheath while the mushroom pushed out into MY large, pointed canine dickhead. Further and further, wider and wider grew MY shaft, a knot bulging out at the base, holding back the crumpled skin of the sheath. Demanding to be tied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yesss...&quot; I hissed through my fangs as pre began to flow along the hard length, dribbling out of the slit at the end. For a few moments I just relished the new sensation. It felt just like -- no it felt <i>way better</i> then I had imagined, large and powerful and <i>hard</i>. So big and hard. Still cradling my much larger ballsack with my left hand, I started to touch my improved penis with the other -- then I noticed that Joe head was lifted so he could look down along his <i>own</i> body.<br />
<br />
That wouldn&#39;t do!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; I growled in my new, husky alto. God I loved the way my voice sounded -- lower, authoritative with an animalistic rasp, but still unmistakably female. Sexy and dominant. I set my claw on his chin, encouraging his gaze to <i>my</i> glory as I playfully commanded &quot;Eyes on <i>me,</i> pup.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was <i>so</i> gratifying to see his eyes bulge. To feel his heart rate speed up. Oh, I had my prey right where I wanted him. I could smell the beading dew of his arousal -- a sweet feminine scent, a little lighter than my she-wolf musk had been. It made my mouth water, and I ran my tongue along my lips as I debated whether I should taste that flower first, or just ravage it with my giant new breeding tool.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what you see?&quot; I taunted. My wolfhood trembled, pushing out a glob of pre which fell on Joe&#39;s smooth-skinned belly, making the human writhe. I reached down, catching his wrists as he tried to wipe my juice off himself, and pinned them back down to his sides. &quot;Ah-ah, Joe. I&#39;m in control here.&quot; I tucked his hands under his body, and put my arms close to his sides to make sure he behaved.<br />
<br />
&quot;God you smell so good, Joe -- so frightened and so horny! So <i>feminine!</i> Just the way it should be beneath an alpha wolfess like me!&quot; I sighed, bathing his face in my warm, moist breath. &quot;I know you wanted me as a girl -- and I know you want me even more now, don&#39;t you? Now that our positions are &#39;reversed.&#39; You want to feel what it&#39;s like to take a big fat cock in you; feel it... pump... out wonderful hot semen into your belly.&quot;<br />
<br />
I had to pause, panting harshly, almost losing control from my own words. And from the spike in his female scent. Confirming that I spoke the truth. My smile grew even toothier.<br />
<br />
&quot;So the only question is, little Joe, whether I take you as-is... Or change you further.&quot;</p>
