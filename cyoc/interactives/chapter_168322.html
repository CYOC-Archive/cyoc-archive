<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"> You enter first, illuminating the room with the flashlight provided by Luisa. The light gave a yellowish hue to the room. There was a small desk that had been placed in the corner, out of the way. A poster hung on the opposite wall where a red cross had been drawn inside a white circle. At first glance there was no trace of violence.<br />
<br />
 Luisa comes in. She seems flustered and she didn&#39;t seem to really want to be there either. But she had made it clear that she would not leave without her husband.<br />
<br />
 The place seemed to have been abandoned in a hurry. Stretchers were thrown everywhere and discarded medical were stacked in the hallway. A sign at the entrance announced that they were unable to tend more patients. . So far you hadn&#39;t found any trace of any confrontation down there. <br />
<br />
 You think that maybe they had escaped, maybe the bunker had been evacuated and the patients were in a safer place protected by the army.<br />
<br />
 This line of thought disappears when you check one of the first rooms down the hall. A mountain of distinctively human bones rested in the center of the room, as if it were a macabre offering. The ground was covered with the spilled blood of those poor wretches.<br />
<br />
 Shit.<br />
<br />
 &quot;We&#39;re leaving.&quot; You whisper to your partner. You didn&#39;t want to attract whatever was nesting down there screaming.<br />
<br />
 Luisa seemed not to have heard you, instead she had her gaze fixed on a group of stretchers stacked at the end of the corridor, recently used, by the dark stains and the remains of crimson-stained bandages.<br />
<br />
 She had an object in her hand, an alliance with the finger that had carried it severed.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Luisa…&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;It belonged to my husband.&quot;<br />
<br />
 A feeling of regret floods you at what that meant.<br />
<br />
 &quot;We both stayed hidden in this place when those golems passed over the city.&quot;<br />
<br />
 You began to understand Luisa&#39;s way of acting. She had been present when the place had been attacked and that she had seen her husband being torn to pieces.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Stuart and I had been hiding from everything. After losing the house we were wandering for a while. We didn&#39;t even have to eat ... we were so hungry ... and his injury ...&quot;she shooked her head - We were found by a policeman who was passing through the area. He was looking for other people who had failed to take refuge underground and brought us down here.&quot;<br />
<br />
 You really didn&#39;t want to bother Luisa, but you needed to know what had happened down here.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Luisa, did Stuart die from his injuries? or was something else?&quot;<br />
<br />
 Luisa didn&#39;t seem to hear you and kept rambling.<br />
<br />
 &quot;The doctors were short of supplies but They did their best to save his life. They also had no food and I was still hungry all the time ...&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;Luisa, tell me the truth: Were you here when this place was attacked?&quot;<br />
<br />
 She put her hands to her head and her body began to tremble, as if she were remembering something terrible. You realize, mortified, your lack of tact and the horrible experience he must have suffered down here at the hands of those monsters.<br />
<br />
 &quot;I didn&#39;t want him to die&quot; her voice was broken by the pain &quot;... I couldn&#39;t do anything ... but he ...&quot;<br />
<br />
 You bring your hand to his right shoulder in an attempt to try to comfort the grieving widow.<br />
<br />
 &quot;… He was so tasty.&quot;<br />
<br />
 Your hand stops in the middle of the air.<br />
<br />
 The voice had taken a complete change of tone, instead of nervous now it had an anxious tone brimming with madness that she had tried to keep hidden. Her face had been transformed: Those small, nervous eyes were now round and eager, and a trickle of drool fell from her mouth. Your hands started to shake.<br />
<br />
 &quot;I ate him whole, then the doctor. Some of the others were also hungry so there was no more food left.&quot;<br />
<br />
 You didn&#39;t know if you could get out of that room but luckily you still had the bar that you had brought with you at hand. She kept rambling around the room until she was facing a bloodstained wall, her back to you. Moment that you took the opportunity to approach the bar that you had released.<br />
<br />
 &quot;God, she was delicious ... I can still remember that wonderful smell as i ripped the flesh of her calf.&quot;<br />
<br />
 It was as if she was commenting on the dinner she had had with her friends. But this was getting more and more wicked. With a firm pulse you start picking up the bar that you had left on the stretcher.<br />
<br />
 &quot;It was like a free buffet&quot; Heh. &quot; ... I haven&#39;t stopped thinking about its taste in the last few hours ...&quot;<br />
<br />
 Now you could hear a series of unnatural clicking sounds coming from the woman. Her body seemed to tremble with delight. You didn´t know how long this situation could last but if you wanted to get out of that place, it was best to end her as soon as possible. With a firm step, you advance towards her with the  pipe in your hands.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Those memories had almost faded ...&quot;<br />
<br />
 You raise the bar above your head and prepare to lower it over hers.<br />
 <br />
 &quot;... Until you showed up.&quot;<br />
<br />
 At that moment she turns around, revealing her features and leaving you completely paralyzed: the blue eyes had been replaced by shark eyes that stared at you viciously. The aquiline nose had been replaced by a porcine snout that sniffed the air in search of prey, but what made you stop in your tracks was the mouth; A black hole that took up half her face and was covered from top to bottom by fangs designed for the sole purpose of ripping flesh and crushing bones.<br />
<br />
 Now you knew the reason why there were no cerberos in the area.<br />
<br />
 The introverted and heartbroken Luisa Morrison had disappeared. Instead a new creature had taken her place and she wanted only one thing: Your flesh.</p>
