<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>"There's our exit," said Miggs as she walked at the front of the group once more, raising her right arm to point forward up the path.  Yaun walked with strong steps at the back of the group, his axe slung over his shoulder as he walked.  Between the two monsters was Eodor, the only human of the group… in the petite female body of Igna the sorceress who had taken all of her powers with her when she stole the prince's body with an ancient spell.</p>

<p>The succubus, the human, and the minotaur walked along, each the opposite gender from which they started their lives, but each determined to escape the World of Chaos <i>first</i>, before they might try to cure themselves.  For it was now that the group kept close ranks, with Miggs as the scout at the front and Yaun the strongman at the back to watch their flanks.</p>

<p>Eodor found herself distracted by the idea of the giant minotaur walking behind her.  She considered to herself that his armor covered very little of his form.  It was something quite appealing to females who might be in to that sort of thing, and Eodor was pretty sure that didn't include her.  It was, however, occupying an inordinate amount of her thoughts, so much so that at the time Miggs spoke, she almost walked right into the succubus' firm, round ass as she now stood stopped right in front of the human.</p>

<p>Stopping abruptly, Eodor looked around Miggs form to the white glowing energy just ahead.  It was large, and not of any particular shape, but it glowed with a white and pink outline of energies that danced along through the air and along the ground.  <p>"Curses," Eodor said softly to herself as she stepped over to Migg's right side, dodging the succubus' tail.  flicking her small pale hand up to knock her wavy red hair out of her eyes again, the young woman frowned.  "That <i>is</i> an Earthbound Portal… but it is in a state of transition and heavily guarded," she noted, moving her hand across in front of the group to motion at the silhouettes in front of the portal, front-lit by its energies.  "Even <i>if</i> we could get to it… it is unlikely we could puncture its gate."</p>

<p>The group took in the image of what was before them.  The swirling white and red outline that danced through the air up ahead was wide enough that a carriage might could part through it, but it was guarded by all manner of creatures on the side of the World of Chaos.  Actually, they all looked to be scratching and clawing at the image, having themselves a bit of a party as they tried to break through its face or otherwise throw each other through it.  The space within the outline itself seemed to house a valley of green with an early morning sky and an empty road.</p>

<p>"I do not understand," Miggs said, looking down at her prince.  "The monsters there, we could rush… but what does it mean that it is in transition?  Unable to be punctured… you mean the portal is acting only as a window?" she asked, her head tilting sideways and looking back to the view ahead of them.  Her tail flicked in agitation.  "What do we do?"</p>

<p>"Look for another way?" the tall brown minotaur at the back of the group asked, his hands going onto his thickly muscled hips.  "I've been all across these lands up here… this is the closest I have seen to a way back," he groaned deeply.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure.  In transition just means that the image we see before us may not be where the portal will rest in the Earth Realm when we go through it," she sighed, thinking it over a bit.  Rubbing her chin, she continued: "Well… a deeply magical entity could perhaps break the seal.  All those creatures up ahead are small.  Minions," Eodor explained.  "None of them would have the power to breach the portal… only when more than are ahead of us gather is that even possible as their sheer numbers allow them to overpower the gate as opposed to any of them actually <i>being</i> powerful.  That's how most demonic outbreaks <i>happen</i>," she explained.</p>

<p>"How does a Prince from Quell know of such creatures of evil?" the minotaur that was Yaun asked aloud, looking down at the petite young woman before him.  His form towered over her, his feet taking a few steps forward up to the two of them as he looked back up to the crowed ahead.</p>

<p>"My prince has many studied friends who can teach her things of that nature," Miggs answered before Eodor could.  Miggs knew that Eodor's lover dabbled in such things, and that had been where the prince had learned so much of demonic creatures.  Unfortunately, that thought snagged in Miggs' brain for a moment, and she narrowed her eyes… <i>Could the prince's companion have been the one to align with Igna?  He </i>had<i> been on the way there,</i> she considered.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you can help," Eodor looked over his shoulder and up at Yuan far above her.  "A minotaur is commonly a very strong magical creature indeed… that is why they are often ordered to guard important treasures or secrets.  If you contain all of the powers of one, then <i>you</i> may be able to breach the barrier and allow us back to the Earth Realm," she said, looking forward again.</p>

<p>"Mh," he grinned big and snorted, "You don't have to ask <i>me</i> twice," he grinned, pulling his axe up off of his shoulder and holding it in both hands.  "A succubus, a frail woman, and a minotaur… what a fight this will be if we cannot break this wall," he said to himself, thinking over what was said.  "I find the prospect of combat far more appealing than I ought.  No matter," he said, holding his giant axe up to his side, and stomping his feet down twice, lowering his head.  "Charge," he said with a grin, lurching forward into a powerful run, his head down as if to gore any who might be in his way as he made haste towards the portal ahead.</p>

<p>"No, wait!" Eodor called after him, taking a few steps forward.</p>

<p>"What is it, my prince!" Miggs asked, quickly putting a scaled hand of hers out in front of the prince to stop her movement.</p>

<p>"If he breaks the steal of the portal <i>now</i>, it will free all those monsters into Earth!" she said, looking up at her life-long friend.</p>

<p>Miggs' head jerked forward towards the minotaur who already had a small gremlin impaled on one of his horns.  She hissed and lunged forward, removing her broadsword as she ran forward towards the group.  Watching the man pull forth his axe and swing, she used her agility and grace to close the gap between them.  Watching the portal, she noted that the image on the other side of it was not what it had been just a moment earlier.  <i>Wonderful,</i> she considered, <i>The portal is </i>moving<i> on the other end.</i></p>

<p>Launching herself into the air with a forceful kick, she threw her wings out at the hight of her jump and proceeded to enact a downward dive towards her minotaur companion up ahead, hoping to stop him.  He had already thrown countless minions up into the air with his charge, flying to her sides as she dove.  Hissing her displeasure at the scene below, she sought to hit him in the back and stop him so that they might kill these creatures before letting them out into the Earth Realm.</p>

<p>She failed, somewhat.  Just as the ten foot tall mass of muscle collided with the portal itself, his feet stumbled as he struck the scene before them.  Her impact with his back&#151;instead of stopping him&#151;knocked him forward into the image and the two tumbled forward into the world beyond.  Landing hard on the other side, the succubus stood up quickly and turned towards the now open portal to Earth from the other side, looking in at the World of Chaos and Eodor far on the other side of the battle there.  With the minotaur behind her getting to his feet, she could not deny the feeling that something had just gone horribly wrong.</p></p>
