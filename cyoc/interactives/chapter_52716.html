<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After lunch, Craig seemed different to Felix. He thought Craig looked like he was a bit lonely, yet slightly jittery.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was some good stuff, Craig.&quot; Felix said while patting his stomach. &quot;Got anything sweet lying around?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Something sweet, hmmm? Well, wanna take a shower with me? We can help each other burn off the calories with this 'desert'.&quot; Craig said with a sly smile as he got up. Craig's Speedo was already beginning to tent.<br />
<br />
&quot;B-but... You're 25 and I'm 20! Don't you feel... Weird... About it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't feel weird about it, we're both men. We can do whoever we want... Well, if they're 18 or older. And I want you because I haven't had any sex for a year.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But why me? I'm nothing special!&quot; Felix yelled, obviously being influenced by his oldself's self-image complex. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa Felix... I thought you were smart or something. Maybe you haven't looked into a mirror for a long time.&quot; Craig said as he stood behind Felix. He began running his hands up and down Felix's arms and torso, groping at his various muscles. He even went as far as kissing and nibbling on Felix. &quot;You're so amazing. When you strutted on to the beach in this little Speedo, I couldn't even contain myself. I thought I'd cum by just looking at you. These big strong muscles, that handsome face, that big bulge... Felix, man... You're so... FUCK, words can't even describe how perfect you look to me. Then under the all these beautiful muscles is an equally beautiful personality. You should be asking why I haven't jumped on you sooner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;C-C-Craig, I... Um... Er... I just... You...&quot; Felix blathered, his face growing red.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you... Blushing? Hah! Reaaaally?&quot; Craig laughed as he backed away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't make fun of me! I just get... A bit...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you're a shy muscle man too? It looks like someones been poking around in my wet dreams. Felix, I'm not makin' fun of you. It's just kinda cute... It shows a more vulnerable side, ya know? A man who looks like a beast, but is a lil softie too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... Well I just don't do well with compliments... I don't know why... I like them and all but... You know...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry about explaining it, stud. Now just come on to the bathroom now...&quot;<br />
<br />
They kept going back and forth for about 5 minutes. However, Felix's new set of genitals have been producing a stronger form of testosterone and supplying his body with more and more of it. Craig kept making his advances, and Felix's body kept upping the ante until Felix could no longer deny both his and Craig's sexual needs. Felix felt his blood pressure slowly rise, his heart beat faster, his muscles tense up, and his cock stirred. His body was in control now, making Felix turn from an intelligent being to a sex-crazed monster. If he didn't agree soon, he felt as if he'd just pounce on Craig and go at it regardless of if Felix wanted to or not.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine! FINE! I'll do it... Just... Stop with the uh... Sexiness!&quot; Felix demanded, feeling his body relax a bit.<br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
Felix's gaze darted around the huge shower, trying to avoid looking at Craig. Of course they were both naked, and Craig was already hard. Felix only got a glimpse of his manhood, but it must've been 10 inches long and maybe 7 or so inches thick. Combined with those nicely toned muscles and the thin layer of bodyhair... Felix would've gone mad if he looked at Craig.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, stud, I'm right here. I mean, you're not even that tall, so you don't have to look down... Unless you want to look at it...&quot; Craig sexily said, pushing himself up against Felix. Felix felt himself growing a bit red as he felt Craig's rock-hard cock brush against him. His body twitched, as if it just wanted to lift Craig up and thrust into him.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's so big and hard... I mean... I-Uh... Craig... I never did this before...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously? Holy shit, dude, you've got be kidding! Looking like you do and not getting any action? I guess I'll have to help you out. Don't worry, I haven't done this in a year, but it's like riding a bike.&quot; <br />
<br />
Craig turned on the water before he gently guided Felix to the back of the shower, making Felix push his back up against the cold tiles. Craig began massaging Felix's muscles while periodically kissing them and groping them. Felix felt his face grow warm and his loins began tingling. Craig let one hand glide over Felix's pecs and abs, while the other hand slowly rubbed his cock. Felix didn't want to fight it any more. Not because of his body's influence, but because he wanted to make Craig happy. Craig was bearing with Felix's awkwardness, so it's the least Felix thought he could do.<br />
<br />
&quot;How big can you get, big boy?&quot; Craig asked, his tone making Felix even hotter. &quot;I'm about 10 inches long but... You look bigger... I can't wait till you use it... The biggest I had in me was 9 inches.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What ab-about a condom? Safe s-sex and a-all that...&quot; Felix struggled to say, finding that Craig was winning over his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are no condoms for cocks like ours, Felix. Don't worry, I'm clean. Don't be afraid to shove it all in me, but not all at once... Fuck Felix this thing is... At least 10 inches now but it's still growing... It has to be over 6 inches thick now too...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Craig I-AH... I want you to stop... Please...&quot; Felix begged, the pleasure emanating from his manhood finally eating away at his self-control. Craig was pulling out all the stops to get Felix hard, and all Felix kept doing was resisting. He thought he'd  just let go... He could trust Craig with his body for now... &quot;Nevermind... Keep... Going... I want you to...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess you really like it, huh? Heh, I think this is it, big boy... I should say big man. It looks 14 inches long... 8 inches thick... It's so hot and hard, I can't even believe this is real... I can't wait. Do it now.&quot; Craig said, turning himself around to brace against the wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;I won't let you down, Craig.&quot; Felix promised, wrapping his muscular arms around Craig and pulling him towards the middle of the shower. &quot;Since you like my body so much... I shouldn't be so far from you... So I'll hold you steady so you can feel me all over. I'm not sure how I'll do, but I want you to walk away from this with a big smile... It's the least I can do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For a guy who hasn't done this before... You sure know the right things to do.&quot; Craig said before letting out a large gasp. Felix had entered Craig, slowly working his girth and length back and forth so Craig could take it. &quot;Felix! Ah... You're... Keep going... Deeper!&quot;<br />
<br />
Felix didn't respond with words - but with action. He allowed the shower water to flow over his cock as he pulled out so he can smoothly enter until Craig was ready to stand a faster pace. Felix's cock was so hot, thick, and long, that Craig shuddered and loudly moaned as it massaged his sweet spot. Even Craig's cock was showing its approval by leaking loads of pre-cum. About ten minutes later, Felix had managed to work in all of his cock. He changed up the routine and only pulled out a few inches before sliding back in. Craig's body then responded with louder moans, more shaking, and cuming. Craig's legs began wobbling, so Felix hugged Craig even tighter to keep him steady.<br />
<br />
&quot;F-fuck! Felix... You're... So... Fuck... I can't...&quot; Craig said in between moans and pants, unable to continue due to his moans growing longer.<br />
<br />
Felix kept trying to prolong the session for a few minutes longer, but his cock couldn't handle any more of this insane pleasure. It shot out wave after wave of cum, making Craig have multiple orgasms as Felix's hot, thick, plentiful semen flooded Craig. Felix pulled out a bit by bit in between the shots until he was finally out. Felix rested his head on Craig's shoulder as he held Craig steady, trying to catch his breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... Craig, I'm glad you talked me in to this... You felt so good... No wait... You still feel so good...&quot; Felix said, gently kissing Craig's neck and shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Felix, you were... Amazing.&quot; Craig responded, lightly placing his hand on Felix's cheek. &quot;You can let go of me. I think I can stand now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want to let go, though.&quot; Felix said, rubbing his hands over Craig's blonde treasure-trail and chest hair. &quot;Heh, you know... I always hated body hair, but yours feels so good. It's not much, it's kind of soft, and it makes you look so manly for some reason... I bet all your other partners thought that too... And your manhood is impressive...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad you enjoy my body as much as I enjoy yours, big guy. Anyway, I hope you have a change of clothes in your truck or else you're going home in a robe... Or nothing at all if you want. I'm sure you'd be doing the world a huge favor by going out naked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh crud, I just remembered... I had to go pick up some clothes to replace my messed up clothes before going home. I guess I'll shower up and get dressed.&quot; Felix said, trying to change the subject. Any more compliments and he'd be red in the face again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mind if I come along? I don't want my boyfriend going too far during this date.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;B-boyfriend? I thought I was... Like... A one-night stand. And a date?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's only 2PM, and dates usually end when it gets dark in the movies... Oh and, I said I really liked you earlier. I meant it. We fucked already, but that doesn't mean you can't be mine. That means I'm all yours too. Ya know, to do whatever you want with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You make yourself sound like an object.&quot; Felix stated as he shampooed his hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I don't mind as long as you're the one holding me, touching me, and rubbing me... Besides, I don't think I could find another dude like you... And I don't think you can find another dude who can take all of your cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha... You're so straightforward... I love it!&quot; Felix said, giving Craig a peck on the cheek. &quot;Okay, I'll agree to be your boyfriend... I'd be pretty stupid to turn down a man like you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd be even stupider for lettin' a guy like you go without a fight.&quot; Craig responded with a smile as he lathered up a cloth to help Felix wash up. Well, it was more like an excuse to feel Felix up, but Felix was fine with that for once. &quot;Now let's get you cleaned up so I can watch you model in some tight clothes.&quot;</p>
