<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Steve....&quot; Janet asked with panic in her voice. &quot;What did you do?!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I have no Idea.&quot; He blankly stated as he stared at the child in the mirror.<br />
<br />
At this point the family was pacing the room in separate directions all panicking in their own way. Steve was trying to be calm but internally he was screaming along with them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom! Why am I dressed like an old lady?! Why do I see an adult me in the mirror?!&quot; Megan whined as she started to tear up.<br />
<br />
&quot;And why do I see some balding dude!?&quot; Alan yelled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Enough! Both of you just calm down!&quot; Janet yelled as she tugged uncomfortably at her new diaper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen.&quot; Steve said after finally composing himself. &quot;Whatever that book did to us, it can obviously undo it right?&quot; He said, semi hoping that his family would reassure his hope. They all nodded as they thought about it while Janet picked up the book.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, yeah honey you&#39;re right.&quot; Janet hopefully responded. &quot;We have the book right here... Steve, what page were you on again?&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve was already one step ahead. While Janet talked, Steve awkwardly walked over to his diapered wife. For some reason, he found it harder to walk. Steve grabbed the book from Janet and flipped through the pages. It was still fairly dark in the old house so Steve could barely see anything on the pages. He quickly realized that not only could he not find the page he was on, but it wasn&#39;t even doing anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Steve?&quot; Janet asked with an annoyed tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no.&quot; He whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no?! What do you mean oh no?!&quot; Megan screamed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down! It&#39;s gonna be alright okay?&quot; Steve yelled at his panicked family. &quot;Look it&#39;s too dark to see anything. And, uh, besides, we shouldn&#39;t do anything with it now since that&#39;d be risky.&quot; Steve lied, pretending to not have just tried to change them back. The kids looked relieved while Janet looked on with her brow raised. &quot;S-- so,&quot; He continued &quot;we should all just go to sleep in the car tonight alright? It&#39;s been a long and confusing night but we&#39;ll figure out this thing in the morning alright?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okayyy.&quot; Both kids whined as the marched outside, both uncomfortable in their new clothes. Steve walked up to Janet and she began to whisper in his ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t get it to work can you?&quot; She asked annoyed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, no, I can&#39;t. But I really can&#39;t see it! Look my mind is fried alright? Let&#39;s just get some rest.&quot; Steve reassured her.<br />
<br />
Janet rolled her eyes, too frustrated to even grasp the scope of what had happened. She took a few steps and suddenly found herself face planting on the ground. Steve, Alan, and Megan all turned in shock, then ran over to help her up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, are you okay?&quot; Megan asked while she lifted Janet up.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... no I don&#39;t think I am.&quot; She said as her legs wiggled. &quot;I... I can&#39;t walk!&quot; She yelled panicking. Her heavy breathing quickly turned to tears as she realized her new clothes weren&#39;t the only changes. Megan, on instinct, grabbed her close and lifted her from the ground. Megan was only in middle school, and yet with ease lifted her 40 year old mother off the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Megan... how-?&quot; Alan started.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know!&quot; Megan yelled. Suddenly, another instinct took over. Janet at this point had gotten over her initial shock, but for some reason she couldn&#39;t stop crying. Then, Alan and Steve watched in horror as Megan turned around and pulled down her shirt. Steve and Alan didn&#39;t need to see what was going on directly to figure it out. They heard suckling and Alan almost puked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Megan!&quot; Steve yelled with his face turning red. &quot;Awe you bweastfeeding youw Mommy?&quot; He asked, before quickly slapping his hand over his mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to your voice?&quot; Alan questioned, starting to sweat from all the magical chaos.<br />
<br />
Steve just stood there, trying to comprehend it all. There he was, a 40 year old adult man, but dressed in the clothes of a child and now forced to talk like one. He heard a burping sound as Megan turned around to reveal she was fully clothed again and Janet had stopped crying. The large 40 year old woman was still being held in her daughter&#39;s arms, but now her face was beat red. Megan was equally red as she set Janet back down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, this has been a lot for everyone.&quot; Megan announced, trying to play it cool. &quot;I think we should do what Dad suggested and just try to get some sleep in the car.&quot;<br />
<br />
The family all silently agreed. This time, Alan picked up Janet, also surprised by how light she felt. Megan strutted out in front while Steve trailed behind. He got one last glance at the mirror and saw a mother leading her family outside, while her husband held an infant and a young boy walked behind. He turned away and sighed as they got to the car, all still silent.<br />
<br />
Alan opened the car, now having the key, when his jaw dropped. Janet also saw what Alan saw and was not having it. She tried to protest, but found that Steve wasn&#39;t the only one with voice problems.<br />
&quot;Gah, bah ga boo!&quot; She yelled frustrated. She was shocked at what came out. She tried again but nothing sounded remotely close to English.<br />
<br />
Steve and Megan went around the car to see what the fuss was about when they saw the adult sized baby seat in the back. <br />
&quot;Oh, my, God.&quot; Megan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, this isn&#39;t even too surprising for me now.&quot; Alan sighed. &quot;Sorry Mom, but I think you&#39;re gonna have to sleep in that tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janet wanted to object, but she knew it&#39;d be pointless. Despite her body being that of her 40 year old self, she had as much freedom as any infant did. Alan locked her into the seat as Steve volunteered to join her win the back. Alan hopped in behind the wheel and Megan got in the passenger&#39;s seat beside him. <br />
<br />
Alan looked in the rearview mirror to see a tiny baby girl fast asleep, and a toddler looking boy drifting off to sleep. He looked back himself just to be sure, and sure enough his parents were still the right ages, just wearing the wrong clothing. Megan noticed this and placed her hand on his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know.&quot; She whispered. &quot;It&#39;s all... crazy. But we have this book thing. We&#39;ve been up for too long and none of this is helping anyone. Tomorrow we&#39;ll be home, rested, and ready to fix this.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you&#39;re right.&quot; Alan agreed. &quot;Man, since when are you so logical and comforting?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. I guess it&#39;s the same thing that&#39;s making Dad talk like a 4 year old.&quot; She chuckled. <br />
<br />
Alan gave her a quick kiss on the lips as they both laid back in their seats to drift off, before both shot their eyes open realizing what they just did. They spit and scraped at their tongues for a minute and then looked at one another.<br />
&quot;That never leaves this car.&quot; Alan declared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Agreed.&quot; Megan sighed before turning towards the window. <br />
<br />
Alan did the same and stared out into the night. His eyes, however, ended up glancing at a photo that laid on the floor. He picked it up and saw it was of the adult him and Megan, locked but the shoulder and kissing. It was a shot of their trip to the grand canyon a year or so back, but now they had changed in that as well. Steve was even younger in it, and the only trace of Janet was a bump forming on the adult Megan&#39;s belly.<br />
<br />
Alan realized what this may have meant for reality, but he was too tired and shocked to care. He laid back down and forced himself to fall asleep.</p>
