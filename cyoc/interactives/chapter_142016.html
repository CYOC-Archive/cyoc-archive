<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Noah wrote, ‘Phil and myself are now 22 along with my boyfriends. Phil and I are fraternal twins that live together.”<br />
<br />
Nick looked in his mirror. His height now makes since, but he didn’t want to be a father. He was still lacking in everything else. <br />
<br />
Nick heard shuffling and talking from the hallway. Two of his boyfriends were talking. <br />
<br />
“I’m really embarrassed Nick,” said one. “Noah saw me with extra clothes on.”<br />
<br />
Nick gasped. “You apologized right?”<br />
<br />
“Profusely”<br />
<br />
“I’m sure he won’t take it too seriously.” Nick said. <br />
<br />
“What if he won’t let me get on tonight with you guys?” Nome moped.<br />
<br />
The garage door opened and in must have walked Nedd. <br />
<br />
“Phil will be back in an hour,” Noah heard. “He wants to bring some of his friends over.”<br />
<br />
“Which ones?” asked Nome.<br />
<br />
“Ron, Bart, and Ainsley,” Nedd responded. <br />
<br />
“I’ll tell Noah,” Nick said. Nick opened the door and looked at Noah. “The trio of doom is coming home with Phil.”<br />
<br />
Nick left and Noah pondered. He knew those names. They were all neighbor kids. Must have grown up with him and Phil. <br />
<br />
No matter. He grabbed the book as well as a pen. <br />
<br />
“Whenever Phil brings anyone into the house, they will all become my boyfriend. Phil forgets about his friends as they turn into identical copies of my boyfriend. He grows jealous of my boyfriends and always makes new friends to bring over. Everyone thinks that my large group of boyfriends is entirely normal. Despite them all looking exactly identical, I can tell the difference.”<br />
<br />
Noah then waited patiently. He listened to the house. His boyfriends seemed to be doing various things around the house. It seemed like three of them were in the kitchen, one was in the pool outside, and one in an adjacent room. They were grunting loudly and Noah went to check it out. <br />
<br />
The upstairs hallway had changed. Noah had his room and bathroom at one end, but there were now only two other doors. One he entered a found it to be Phil’s. The other he found to be enormous. In it were five identical beds. <br />
<br />
On the floor was Nate, furiously doing push-ups. Instead of a foul smelling sweat scent, the pleasant foot aroma filled the room. Noah approached and Nate stopped. <br />
<br />
“Well if it isn’t the love of my life,” Nate said smiling. He jumped up and bear hugged Noah. Noah relished in the meatiness off Nate’s muscles before Nate let go. <br />
<br />
“Here,” Nate said pushing Noah to the ground. “You just lie there.”<br />
<br />
Nate leaned over top of Noah and began doing push-ups. It was erotic for Noah. He touched the muscles each time they came down. Every time he did, Nate groaned. His dick slammed into Noah’s chest before Nate started to shake. He fell onto Noah and began kissing him sensually. <br />
<br />
There was a knock on the door. Noah pushed Nate off of him as he shook on the ground. Noah made his way downstairs and opened the door. <br />
<br />
In walked a tall man with curly red hair. He was fit and strong looking.<br />
<br />
“Hey Noah,” the man said. He stepped aside revealing two guys and a girl. <br />
<br />
“Ron, Bart and Ainsley,” he gestured. Must be Phil. The five boyfriends showed up at the door as well. <br />
<br />
Phil gestured at Noah. “That’s Noah.”<br />
<br />
Gesturing in general to the tall naked men, “That’s Nate, Nick, Nedd, Nome, and Neil. Their quintuplets who live with us and are dating Noah. I can’t tell the difference, but they sure can.”<br />
<br />
The guests laughed and entered. They entered the family room (which seemed bigger than usual) and sat down in front of the tv. Phil sat down next to his friends on a couch. The others sat around on various chairs. Noah took a prime spot next to Ron on the couch. <br />
<br />
Noah already noticed something. Everyone had walked in with tennis shoes on, but all the guests were now barefoot. Phil turned on a movie and sat back. <br />
<br />
Phil felt a little squished. Ron was rubbing up against him and had gotten bigger. So had Bart. Ainsley looked less feminine. <br />
<br />
“It’s a bit hot in here,” Bart said. <br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Ron said. “Do you mind if we take off our shirts?”<br />
<br />
Phil was too captured in the movie and just waved at them. They threw threw off their shirts. <br />
<br />
Ron and Bart still had a little bit of hair, but were certainly looking like the rest of the crowd. Ainsley’s bra had disappeared and she was flat chested. <br />
<br />
After a while longer, Ron put his arm around Noah. Noah looked over. The last of the hair had receded from their bodies. They were taller and more muscular. Their hair had turned black. Ainsley was no longer recognizable as a girl. <br />
<br />
In synchronized motion, the buttons on all of their pants flew off. They slid to the ground without a moment of further notice. Beneath them laid identical blue boxers with identical bulges. <br />
<br />
Noah had a sudden spark of thought. He recognized these people. They were Patt, Pery, and Parn. They had been Phil’s friends, but now they were just three more boyfriends. <br />
<br />
A love scene appeared, and Patt grabbed Noah and started snuggling with him. <br />
<br />
Phil sighed and got up and left, beckoning at the rest of them to do their thing. <br />
<br />
7 other men jumped up at the opportunity and hungrily looked at Noah. They took his clothes all the way off without hesitation. Climaxing immediately, Nate spasmed out and cum exploded from him immediately. Nick and Patt began licking his nipplea seductively. Pery began giving him a blow job. Parn grabbed his chest and rubbed his own against him. Nedd and Nome massaged his legs and gripes over his feet. With one swift motion, Neil impaled Noah with his cock and began jerking off. Noah was literally lifted into the air by all of this and quickly passed out. <br />
<br />
He dreamed quite lucid dreams of him and a thousand boyfriends, each massaging him and groveling over him. <br />
<br />
He awoke in his bed, seemingly freshly bathed and cleaned. Light shone through the window onto his desk. Noah giddily got up and ran to his desk. <br />
<br />
He jerked to a stop and noticed something quite out of place. <br />
<br />
The book was gone.</p>
