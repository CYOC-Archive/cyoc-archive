<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hi, my name is Craig Matthews and my brother’s a giant. I’m serious, a giant. Anyone would think that was bullshit, and to be honest I’d agree, but sadly: <br />
it’s not. My 9 year old brother is a 9 foot tall, muscle-bound giant. It’s almost scary, and at first it was, but we’ve grown to be used to it. We’ve had to <br />
make a lot of changes to the way we live because of it. Timmy’s (my little brother) bedroom had to be extended 8ft and a custom-made bed had to be built; it’s <br />
12ft long and 8ft wide! We have to get designer clothes and shoes; Timmy eats about 5 meals a day and we still have to get him through 7 hours of school! As <br />
I’m telling you this, Timmy’s playing on his GameBoy with a copy of Pokemon FireRed. It was odd; he was so physically mature yet so childish! He was scared of <br />
the dark; believed there were monsters under his bed and often made me sleep in his bed so he’d feel better. Imagine a 9ft muscle stud holding you like a <br />
teddy bear! I still remember the day we found him like it…<br />
<br />
I was in the living room watching some re-runs of Doctor Who while Timmy was in his bedroom. He’d been feeling sick for most of the day, and our mum wanted me <br />
to watch him for the day. I think he had stomach cramps, because when I walked past his room I heard him groaning in pain. He’d locked his door, so I couldn’t <br />
check on him and he refused to open it when I asked. I was halfway through an episode when I heard a loud crash, like wood splintering and breaking. I jumped <br />
off my seat, and was about to run up the stairs when I heard loud thuds, like a heavy object walking down the stairs. Who could it be? To my horror, a large <br />
muscle covered body appeared in the doorway. I couldn’t see the face, since they were so tall they were blocked by the doorframe. The most horrifying moment <br />
was when the body revealed itself. It was Timmy!<br />
<br />
His body was a work of art: giant chiselled pecs, and a cobblestone eight pack that looked indestructible. Large, incredibly strong arms connected to meaty <br />
shoulders and manly hands. His legs were like tree trunks, incredibly large and incredibly defined. I swear he had no fat on his body (in fact we found at he <br />
had only 3% body fat!). The most eye-catching thing was his manhood. It hung there almost to his knees. It was easily over a foot long and about as thick as a <br />
Coke can! It was all wrong, because he had actually retained his childish age. He was nowhere near puberty, so he was totally hairless except for his head. <br />
His skin was a pale-tan, and his feet were easily twice the size of my size 10s. His face had hardly changed at all, except for a meatier neck. It was <br />
horrifying, and oddly beautiful.<br />
“T-Timmy? Is that you?!” I asked slowly<br />
“Erm, yeah?” he answered quietly. His voice hadn’t changed at all, still the insecure child he was yesterday.<br />
“What happened?!”<br />
“I don’t know! I felt weird all morning, and then this happened!” <br />
“How do you feel?” Timmy hesitated, and then looked over himself. He stood 3 feet taller than me, and put the biggest bodybuilders to shame. He spent a few <br />
moments staring, and then smiled slightly.<br />
“I feel- amazing!” He said with a huge grin. “Look at me, Craig! I’m huge! I’m even bigger than daddy!” He began feeling his giant physique, flexing slightly <br />
with each limb. He looked at his penis, and looked confused.<br />
“My willy? What’s wrong with it?”<br />
“What do you mean?”<br />
“It’s huge, it looks like a snake!”<br />
“Um, well. When you get older, your willy gets bigger too.”<br />
“No! I don’t want a biggy willy!”<br />
“No, no! It’s very good to have a big willy! In fact, you’ve probably got the biggest in the world. You should be really proud!” Timmy looked at his cock, and <br />
smiled. Taking his large hands, he picked it up. With two hands, it still hung over by a few inches. <br />
“It’s really heavy… Look!” He wiggled it slightly, and like a normal penis, it became slightly erect. “Ah! What’s happening?!” He shouted as it became full <br />
erect. It reached almost to his pecs, and was giant. Without his cock, I could see his large balls. They were about the size of softballs, and probably filled <br />
with testosterone. <br />
“Well, when you’re older. Your willy feels good when you touch it.” I said awkwardly. It was so weird seeing this. Thankfully, Timmy left that organ alone for <br />
the minute, and instead went to hug me. I felt almost crushed by his extreme strength. He let go, and childishly asked if we could watch CBeebies. <br />
<br />
Timmy and I sat on the sofa watching Big Cook Little Cook. I spent the entire time staring at Timmy. He sat there completely naked watching the irritating <br />
actors talk and cook cute little cakes. He laughed at the actors’ little jokes, and leant on his hand. His large arm flexed as he did, his bicep was huge; it <br />
must have been over 30”! Every time he laughed, his eight pack tensed admirably. I wasn’t sure if I was jealous, scared or proud. He was my little brother, <br />
and he’s a hunk! I didn’t know if he realised how big he actually was, because if he did it meant he could push me around a lot more. He could easily lift his <br />
bed, and more! I didn’t know what to do with him. On one hand, he’s my little brother; it’s my job to look after him, protect him! On the other hand, he not <br />
exactly little! I’d feel safer with him near me than the vice-versa. <br />
<br />
As I lay on the sofa, Timmy yawned. He then lent over and rested his head on my lap. <br />
“Craig?”<br />
“Yes, Timmy?”<br />
“Are you still my big brother?”<br />
“Of course!”<br />
“Ok. I love you, Craig.”<br />
“You too, Timmy.” I said stroking his hair “You too.</p>
