<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once Helen had calmed down and finally stopped crying Steve said they would have to have a very serious talk about it. <br />
<br />
Helen agreed but that they would need to do this elsewhere as the janitor would start cleaning work soon and she didn&#39;t want them to be found. She then asked to go to Steve&#39;s apartment as he lived alone, as she was keeping her condition a secret even from her family and didn&#39;t want them to find out like that.<br />
<br />
Arriving at his apartment, Steve prepared tea for his girlfriend, so she could be as calm as possible as they talk. As they talked he knew that Helen felt torn, because on the one hand she was not afraid of how she would be treated if people found out about her condition and that she even thought of surgically removing them, but when she thought about it she felt that somehow way she was enjoying her new members and was scared just thinking about losing them. He also understood that, from her words, she must have had more than one dick, which was not uncommon in those where the virus manifested itself.<br />
<br />
Steve made it clear to her that hiding like she was doing would only make things worse, that she was better off just publicly admitting her condition without being ashamed of what she was. And also said that if she was worried that he thought he wouldn&#39;t be with her because of her new dicks then she was wrong as he would be gay if he was with another man, now she was still a girl, only with something extra. He added joking that now she could understand men better than any normal girl.<br />
<br />
After that, with Helen finally fully accepting her condition, Steve said &quot;Now that this is no longer an issue between us, can I see it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think so, I&#39;m still ashamed.&quot; Helen said<br />
<br />
&quot;No need to be ashamed. You&#39;ve never had a problem being naked in front of me since we started dating, and anyway if we have a lasting relationship like we intended I have to see it sooner or later anyway.&quot; Steve said<br />
<br />
&quot;You are right. Just don&#39;t look at me with disgust, it&#39;s okay.&quot; Helen said, getting up and unbuttoning her skirt, letting it fall to the floor.<br />
<br />
Seve took a close look at his girlfriend&#39;s panties, where the dick line stretching to the side made it clear how big her new male member was, the same could be seen with her ballsack. As he watched her cock grew hard due to her having an erection.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t look at me like that. Look what you did, because of you I got hard.&quot; Helen said<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not my fault you get horny just for me looking.&quot; Steve said and a thought crossed his mind &quot;Yes, now I want to see this. I believe your dick is fully functional, so could you jack off here and now? I would like to see you do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You really are a pervert asking your girlfriend to do this kind of thing.&quot; Helen said<br />
<br />
&quot;You owe me after lying to me so much.&quot; Steve said<br />
<br />
Helen giggled and lowered her panties, exposing her hard 10 inch member to the open air, then began to stroke it.<br />
<br />
As Steve watched his girlfriend jack off he realized how much it turned him on because his cock got hard inside his pants. It was then, with the sway of her ballsack, that he realized there was something hanging behind it. &quot;Hey Helen, is it just me or is there something behind your sack?&quot; he asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, you must be talking about my other sack.&quot; Helen said, lifting her ballsack only to show a second ballsack right behind it &quot;It&#39;s for my second dick, this one grew backwards. See for yourself.&quot; and turned her back to him, allowing him to see the tip of another hard cock protruding from between her legs, so she bent down allowing him to fully see the second cock growing behind her second ballsack.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to admit, I&#39;m finding you sexier now that you&#39;ve got your dicks than before.&quot; Steve said<br />
<br />
Helen blushed and looked at her boyfriend in total surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not lying. See how much you turned me on.&quot; Steve said unzipping his pants and putting his hard cock out. He then grabbed Helen and they started kissing, meanwhile he rubbed his cock against Helen&#39;s front cock.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take Helen long to come, smearing Steve&#39;s clothes with her cum. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I haven&#39;t fully got used to my dicks yet and sometimes I come too fast&quot; she said, her dick getting limp<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem, I took the risk.&quot; Steve said, taking his clothes off completely. &quot;It&#39;s just a shame it&#39;s over already.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not over, I still didn&#39;t come with my backward cock.&quot; She turned around showing that her backward cock was still hard &quot;According to the doctor who examined me this is rare, but it is possible that the dicks of a girl affected by the Dicksprout virus are independent of each other. That&#39;s why I lingered in the bathroom at school before, I had to come twice and then clean everything up to avoid problems.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting. That means you&#39;re up for it one more time.&quot;  Steve said, approaching from behind Helen and lowering her backward cock, thus opening the way to her pussy. Quickly and penetrated the inner entrance of his girlfriend and, while he fucked her, her backward cock rubbed between his legs and the tip reached the space between his buttocks, despite the angle making any penetration impossible.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take long for Helen to reach another orgasm. This time she had cum being fired by her backward dick. Her boyfriend continued to fuck her while she came, it didn&#39;t take long for him to reach his own orgasm.<br />
<br />
With it all over Steve and Helen were laid down on his bed, where the two of them just enjoyed each other&#39;s company for now.</p>
