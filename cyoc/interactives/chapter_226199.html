<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Two artists that kinda influence the appearance of the women are n647 ad Osmar-Shotgun, give them a look for the proportions I have in my head if I describe them badly. </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A moan left her lips as she sat up and stretched. She had to disentangle herself from the bodies of the others on the bed before she could get to her feet. Stretching some more and rubbing her eyes, she moved to the window and opened the curtains to let some light in. The other three figures on the bed grunted and groaned as sleep started to leave them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright alright, up and att&#39;em bitches.&quot; Daisha said with a smile, &quot;It&#39;s a brand-new day so let&#39;s see what trouble we can get into.&quot; <br />
<br />
------<br />
<br />
Sherri was in the middle of getting dressed while Carissa was in the shower. Daisha and Shawna were in the kitchen, one cooking while the other reading the paper. Shawna looked over her shoulder as she flipped some pancakes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Daisha. After what we did to Sherri and Carissa last night; think we ever used the device for anything else besides like what we’ve been doing? Like what if we changed our past or something?&quot; <br />
<br />
Daisha thought as she put her paper down. The fact that device could make mental changes and even warp reality a bit to make the changes fit; it was a little worrying at least. And yet, why did she care? Why should she care? <br />
<br />
Of course there was the little issue of her previous self programming her current self not to think too deep about it. The same had been done to Shawna as well along with the Twins. Diana had a good amount of time while the Twins had enjoyed each other to program the device. Not just to wipe the slate clean for their new lives but with a special clause or two in place to help things out in the future. Mainly to make sure the duo didn&#39;t go too fair. <br />
<br />
But the pairs previous lives as Diana and Shawn were removed from existence.<br />
<br />
Instead the two had been orphaned sisters, who grew close together in all things and ways. It was only really after the discovery of the Chromatic ‘years’ ago that the two had gone down this path. After all who could else could they enjoy sharing this power with? No it only made sense to be with each other(at least that’s how it was programmed into them). The rest was history; college days, club nights, amazing figures, all nine yards. Within reason of course; there was no fun in just using the device to walk girls into bed with them. <br />
<br />
Way more fun to charm them. That&#39;s how Shawna met her friends Jalisa and Danae, they&#39;d brought the pair home one weekend to have fun and stayed friends with them for awhile before giving them a bit of an upgrade. And well last night they saw a chance to help another pair out on the fun and lifestyle.<br />
<br />
Or as Daisha put it, help some gals become “Big Badonka Bitches”.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah not really.&quot; she shrugged as she reached for her cup, &quot;Unless we were like, serial killers or something, whatever past life we had or didn’t have doesn’t matter a lick to me at this point. Think of it as.... reincarnation or something..., or like one of them anime shows I hear people talk about.&quot; Daisha muttered as she took a sip of coffee. <br />
<br />
&quot;Isekai, I think is the name. Think it means other world or new world life..., dunno, been awhile since I thought about it.&quot; Shawna said as she walked over with a plate of food and put it on the table. <br />
<br />
Daisha nodded as she started to pile up food on her plate, watching Shawna leave. Girl looked good in those booty shorts, even if it was Sherri&#39;s. Each of the girls were basically the same size now; 7&#39;2&quot; of pure ebony goddess with a booty that wouldn&#39;t quit, beach ball breasts and enough muscle mass to carry everything and maybe a little more, only still slim to the point they still had curves. They were basically super hero babes. <br />
<br />
The only real difference, besides taste in clothes and hair styles, were the tattoos. All four had a pure black vine tattoo wrapping around parts of their body, with a flower in the middle. Daisha and Shawna had them on their chests, right above their cleavage and in different colors; Gold for Daisha and a bright Purple for Shawna. The twins however had them as tramp stamps, right above their thick asses; Sherri having the gold flower and Carissa having Purple.<br />
<br />
It was something Daisha/Diana had thought up, a sort of &#39;branding&#39; of who was &#39;who&#39;s&#39;. Of course sharing was something they didn&#39;t have a problem with but she liked the color theme...., eh she&#39;d work it out later. <br />
<br />
That aside, while they could wear the twin&#39;s clothes, it&#39;d be a bit rude to fuck and walk out with someone else&#39;s clothes. They would stick around long enough to wash their club outfits and head out. Though it was the weekend so they weren&#39;t in a hurry. Maybe some all-day fun was in the cards for them. She just smiled at the thought of swapping partners before putting some hot cakes into her mouth, chewing away as her old life faded away. <br />
<br />
Turned out the fun was going to have to wait as Daisha had missed a few things during the rewrite. <br />
<br />
The four of them talked over breakfast, each one sharing a bit more of themselves. Of course, each pair knew much about their partner/friend/lover. <br />
<br />
Daisha was doing local work at a newspaper but graduated collage with a degree in business. Shawna for her part was still in collage, online courses, for web development and programming. Carissa and Sherri were also still in collage, Carissa studying photography and film while Sherri was doing fashion with some classes in marketing as well. Sherri also did some modeling work on the side though that wasn&#39;t the main way the sisters kept money coming in. <br />
<br />
&quot;We do weekend shifts at one of those self-storage lots. It&#39;s not bad, gives us plenty of time for our own studies and well, being this big and strong, it&#39;s pretty handy to help people move stuff in and out of units.&quot; Carissa explained before taking a sip of her drink. <br />
<br />
&quot;UGH if only the others weren&#39;t just giant jackasses. Always staring at my ass and making lewd comments about &#39;showing me a real man&#39;, fuckers.&quot; Sherri grumbled as she stretched, &quot;Jeff and Chris are such god damn pigs. I swear they&#39;re gonna trip over themselves over their tongues one day.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re bad, but the creepy Ricky I think is worse. Pretty sure he&#39;s smoking or doing something; you aren&#39;t that skinny without being on something. And I keep catching him either trying to break into units or sneaking out with items I know ain&#39;t his. Usually women&#39;s ones too.&quot; her sister muttered as she stuck out her tongue. <br />
<br />
&quot;If they&#39;re such jackasses and problems, how do they still work there?&quot; Shawna asked with her head tiled to the side. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s cause of Krista.&quot; Both sisters snapped at once as they stood halfway out of their chairs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Think of the oldest boniest meanest school m&#39;arm or librarian.&quot; Carissa started as she slumped in her chair. <br />
<br />
&quot;Then make her like Scrooge levels of frugal, and Karen levels of controlling.&quot; Sherri finished as she leaned back in her chair, hand on her temple. <br />
<br />
&quot;UGH the only reason she&#39;s manageable is that she&#39;s drunk half time and just sleeps in her office most the day. But she&#39;ll school your ass with a lecture that takes most the afternoon if she notices one thing out of place. So we just kinda take advantage of her being out of it to sneak studies... or make out sessions.&quot; she winked at her partner. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah..., our coworkers are shit.&quot; Carissa went on before sitting up again and taking a long sip of her drink, &quot;But so long as we avoid them, it&#39;s not horrible.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, sounds like you got a bit of a rough time there huh.&quot; Shawna said. Though a smile on her face was there when she looked over at her partner. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, well, you two do have a rough idea of what have in my purse right?&quot; Daisha grinned as she leaned forward, fingers steepled together. <br />
<br />
The twins nodded. After all they had this new life and shared love all thanks to Daisha and that thing she had. Granted they never thought about taking it for themselves. That&#39;d be rude and go against the programing Diana had put into them. Something Daisha would end up doing in the future.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about we find you two some new employment?&quot; the leader of the group smiled wide as she thought of ideas, &quot;Or maybe... help with some team building at your work?&quot; </p>

After all, why stop at just two new girls?</h3>
