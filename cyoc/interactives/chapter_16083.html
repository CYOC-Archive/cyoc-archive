<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Mr Longfellow's hands caressed his breasts he unbuckled his belt and pulled his hard-on out of his now unbuttoned CK boxers. Rick was shocked at the sight of this veiny, pulsing member, but his mother's senses kicked in and he reached out her slender, bronzed arm and grabbed it, running her nail up to the great head.<br />
<br />
Mr Longfellow entwined his tongue with Rick's stepmom's as he feathered it, stimulating Rick who could feel a now wet pussy between his legs. As Mr Longfellow struggled off his pants, Rick, almost on autopilot pulled his sweatshirt over his head and massaged his chest, toying with his erect little nipples. With another kiss, Mr Longfellow had positioned his erection at the mouth to Rick's stepmom's sex.<br />
<br />
Rick was shocked at how easily he had submitted to this and at the longing he now felt. He thought to himself, I had a sudden, uncontrollable desire to spread my legs.  I knew that, if I opened them, the pleasure I was feeling would increase.  I managed to get them around Mr Longfellow's knees.  He had an erection that  <br />
would choke a horse.  <br />
	My brain was screaming out that this couldn't be happening.  I was  <br />
a boy, what was wrong with me.  The urge to open my legs to him was  <br />
fogging my mind.  I suddenly realized that I was arching my pelvis up in  <br />
the air towards him.  I closed my eyes, still unable to stop thrusting my hips  <br />
upward, and trying to stop it was impossible, though I tried.<br />
	I then felt a pressure against the area directly between my legs.   <br />
Suddenly, there was an intense heat that went shooting up to the pit of my  <br />
stomach.  What was he doing?  I opened my eyes, and he was on top of me.   <br />
His face was directly over mine.  He was so close. The first thought to  <br />
enter my mind was to kiss him again, to feel his strong tongue running through my mouth.  I tried to resist, but I seemed to be  <br />
driven by some <br />
internal desire.  My mind was becoming more and more foggy with each  <br />
thrust of his hips, and I was being swept away by the sensations.  The  <br />
kiss was ecstasy.  Our tongues were twirling against each other, and I  <br />
completely forgot that I was a boy and let my stepmom take over. I wanted to feel her pleasure and feel what her man made her feel like inside her. <br />
	When I gained my next glimpse of sanity, I felt what like should  <br />
have been my erection, but  I was  <br />
wrong.  I suddenly felt myself become very wet, like a woman, and  <br />
something did grow, but it didn't interfere with his rod.  In fact, it  <br />
increased the sensations I was feeling to a point where I thought I was  <br />
going to faint.  Mr Longfellow's head seemed to be sliding above mine, and we were  <br />
no longer able to kiss comfortably.  I arched my head back and he bent his  <br />
down. It was then that I got the most horrible yet fascinating feeling of  <br />
my life, as his penis suddenly slid completely into me. I now felt fulfilled as a woman, and felt as if I was truly under the spell and command of this man. The feeling was  <br />
wonderful.<br />
	It felt as if a void, of which I was unaware, being filled.  I was  <br />
revelling in the feeling.  He then started to move back and  <br />
forth more quickly.  I found myself moving in rhythm with him.  I then heard a sound,  <br />
it sounded like a woman during sex.  I was ready to push him off when I  <br />
realized that it was I who was moaning.  Listening more closely to my  <br />
voice, I noticed that it was at least two octaves higher and much smoother and sexier than I was used to. So sexy.<br />
	Suddenly an increasing tension and desire took over, and I  <br />
couldn't think about anything.  This sweet tension was building and  <br />
increasing, and I could not get rid of it.  My whole body was on fire, and  <br />
ice cubes were sizzling everywhere.  His cock seemed to expand even more,  <br />
and I felt a sudden jolt.  I then felt something driving in further.  That  <br />
was all I could take, and a flood of sensetions exploded throughout my  <br />
body.  It was like my body was having an earthquake, and, just when the  <br />
tremors seemed to be dying out, they would suddenly increase again.  This  <br />
kept happening until I passed out, with the weight of the man who'd made me his on top of me.</p>
