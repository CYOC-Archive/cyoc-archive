<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Terry and Jack where the first to get into the massive water tank which would transport them to a medical center but both of them where beginning to wonder if that would happen.<br />
<br />
The tank was massive designed to hold around 120 merpeople and each truck pulled two of the massive things. With seven trucks total you wouldn’t expect the CDC officials to fill each tank to the max because while on paper it could fit that many merpeople that was only on paper. The fact that the officials seamed to be filling each tank to the max and judging by what they saw out the window they had called in additional trucks made both of them wonder if there was a center would take them all.<br />
<br />
“I am going to bet they dump us right in the ocean.” Stated Terry as he looked around at how packed the tank was becoming. <br />
<br />
The tank may have been designed to hold 120 merpeople, however that was if all the people who were transformed where the regular type of merpeople. Which was a normal human top half with a long scaled covered tail which was about the same length or slightly longer than their old human feet. That was the “Normal” however next to no one was the full normal. <br />
<br />
Most like himself where close, his tail was slightly longer then most or like Jack who was the “normal” aside from the pair of fins growing out of her hips. <br />
<br />
He looked around from his one spot near one of the windows he could hardly see any open space of water left in this tank. It wouldn’t have been too bad if everyone had found a place like him and Jack and just stayed there but almost no one was doing that. <br />
<br />
Everyone was moving around asking questions, it was almost always different versions of same three questions. Who are you? Have you seen insert name? Do you know where they are taking us?.<br />
<br />
“Tom…have anyone seen Tom?” yelled a merman who had pushed nearby the two of them, he was well built and looked like a normal merman but instead of scales he had fleshly tail in a mixture of black and white which looked like a killer whale. When he didn’t get a response, he kept moving on.<br />
<br />
“It will be alright, just stay calm.” Said a mermaid beside the two of them. She was an octopus mermaid with eight legs coming off around where her knees would normally have been. <br />
<br />
“I am calm.” Snapped the other mermaid with her, showing off her new shark like features. She looked almost more shark then human, no hair at all and a large fin coming off her back. <br />
<br />
“Mommy I am scared.” Said the little merbaby in her arms. “Where is daddy?”<br />
<br />
“Daddy is right here.” Answered the octopus mermaid which only confused the little kid. <br />
<br />
The kid had what looked to be a normal tail, which only added to the confusion, since both his or her parents now had very different tails and looked very different. Throw in the gender transformation and it was a whole mess.<br />
<br />
Looking around Terry saw so many different types of merpeople, almost three quarters of the tank was full of mermaids which made sense, the virus transformed 1 in 2 of males to females while only transforming a tiny amount of women into man. Still, he saw so many different types. <br />
<br />
He saw what looked to be a jellyfish like mermaid sitting on the bottom of the tank long thin tentacles splaying out all around her as she cried. He saw what looked to be a squid merman, his head had become pointed with fins on the side of his head and multiple arms coming out of his knee area. <br />
<br />
A mermaid and merman, one a normal the other an eel type hugged each other and tried to figure out everything was happening to him. <br />
<br />
“Are you Mary?” inquired a mermaid who suddenly appeared in his face.<br />
<br />
“No, I am Terry.” Answered Terry as the mermaid nodded and turned around, she didn’t have a tail per say but a long narrow stinger, she spread her arms to show her pinky had expanded outwards into what looked like a wing. She moved away, a stingray mermaid. <br />
<br />
“I think they are about done.” Said Jack as she looked up toward the top of the tank.<br />
<br />
“Why do you say that?” inquired Terry<br />
<br />
“They are loading up not fully turned people.” Pointed out Jack as Terry looked up. Built near the top of the water mark of the tank where multiple benches where those who where infected but not fully transformed could be transported as well. The benches allowed those people who still required air to breath. <br />
<br />
Before he could tell Jack he agreed the tank began to shake as they began to move.<br />
<br />
“Well, we are moving.” Said Terry as he looked out the window into the darkness of the park, he could see there where still more pods of transformed people waiting to be transported. “How people where in the park?”<br />
<br />
“If it was full, a few thousand at least.” stated Jack “Sorry I wish I could say more.”<br />
<br />
“TERRY!!!” yelled a voice “IS TERRY HERE!!!”</p>
