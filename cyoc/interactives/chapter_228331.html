<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake on impulse made a move, grabbing his brother’s cell phone and scurrying between Pops’ massive legs as he bolted out of the door.  He could swear he felt something hefty brush the back of his head as he was directly under Pops.  Not wanting to dwell too long on what the possibilities of what he felt were, he immediately dialed Wayne, hoping he knew of something to reverse the pill’s effects.<br />
<br />
He held the phone up to his ear as the call rang on the other end….and went to voicemail. Jake cursed under his breath as he redialed.  He could hear various grunts and moans coming from the room where he’d left Pops.  He assumed that in his absence, Pops had figured out a solution to his problem.<br />
<br />
The second call was greeted withe a drowsy, cottonmouthed “Joe? Whatcha want?” from the other end of the line.<br />
<br />
“Wayne! Thank god! It’s not Joe, it’s Jake, I need your help, like right now!” Jake proceeded to tell Wayne everything that had happened, and after a few misunderstandings and repeats, Wayne was caught up.<br />
<br />
“Look, you’ve got to get out of the house for right now. Meet me at the corner of Henderson and Picket in 5.  Slip out as quiet as you can.” And with that Wayne hung up.<br />
<br />
Jake managed to get out of the house unnoticed and met Wayne at the intersection about a block from the house.<br />
<br />
He saw Wayne waiting for him. Wayne was the youngest of the Triumvirate, only about a year older than Jake.  He was small for his age, and skinny-fat.<br />
<br />
“Ok, so the situation is bad, but not unsalvageable.  The bad news is there’s nothing to counter the pill.  Pops is going to be around for the next 10 hours or so.  The best we can do is try to contain him.” Wayne was rummaging through the duffel bag he’d brought with him.<br />
<br />
“Contain him?! How the hell do we do that.  I saw the pics of Cubbie and Pops probably didn’t look too big for him, but trust me, Pops is HUGE.” Jake caught a glimpse of some shiny fabric in the duffle bag.<br />
<br />
“Well, that’s why…..” Wayne fidgeted with the contents of the bag, “that’s why…..we…..” he continued searching, his voice trailing as he payed more attention to the bag than what he was saying. “Ah. There it is. That’s why we need these!”. He pulled out what looked like a shiny gold bikini bottom and a shiny blue one, along with a small bottle.<br />
<br />
“Women’s bathing suits?” Jake looked at Wayne like he’d lost his mind.<br />
<br />
“They aren’t bathing suits, their men’s posing suits.  Like bodybuilder’s wear.”<br />
<br />
“Huh? What do we do with those?”<br />
<br />
“We wear them after using these.” Wayne held up the small bottle.<br />
<br />
“Those aren’t-“<br />
<br />
“Yep!” Wayne said with a smile.<br />
<br />
“Look, no offense but I’m straight and I’d like to stay that way. Plus, I saw the pics of your trip and…” Jake shuttered at some of the debauchery he had seen in his brother’s phone’s photo album.<br />
<br />
“Do you want to help your brother or not?  He’s stuck as Pops for basically today, and he needs someone to ‘play’ with.  I know Cubbie and him will have plenty of fun, but that means I’ve got to be Cubbie for the next 12 hours too. I really hadn’t cleared my schedule. And if we’re being honest, being a horned up dumbass isn’t how I wanted to spend my day. You’re kinda the reason he’s in this mess, so you need to ‘man up’ too, and you really need. To. help.” Wayne accented the last three words, shoving the blue trunks into Jake’s chest with each one. “We both go into your garden shed, change clothes, change….other things… and then find Pops.”<br />
<br />
They started walking back to Jake and Joe’s house.<br />
<br />
“Oh and something about Cubbie,” Wayne looked directly at Jake, “well, he’s…well kinda dumb. I probably won’t remember what we’re doing after I become him, so you’ll have to keep us on track.”<br />
<br />
“Keep us on track?! But I have no idea what I’ll turn into.  I really don’t want to be some really fat dude.” Jake had come up with several excuses not to go through with the plan.<br />
<br />
“Ok, so you know Joe, he probably doesn’t find the idea of being an older hairy daddy appealing.  And look at Russ, he turns into some powerlifter dude.  He’s a theater kid, he really doesn’t have any interest in that.  I turn into a young pro himbo bodybuilder, and that’s not really what I’m into. But the pills, dude, they take care of it. Whatever you become, you’re going to love it while you _are_ it. Trust me, Cubbie loves his muscles, he loves other guys, and while I’m him, the whole thing is probably the most enjoyable experience I’ve ever had.” They’d reached the garden shed. “Let’s get our clothes changed.”<br />
<br />
They went in the shed and stripped, avoiding looking anywhere even close to each other.  Jake felt weird putting on the shiny posers. He’d never worn anything like them before, and wasn’t used to the way the fabric felt so smooth on his skin.<br />
<br />
“Do you get used to the way these things feel?” He asked Wayne while he was trying to get the pouch to fit.  It was way oversized for his smallish package.  He’d guess that even Pops may not be able to fill it out.<br />
<br />
“I never have, but I’m not a bodybuilder. Cubbie doesn’t seem to notice them.  Though he usually is just focused on ‘other’ things. Without going into too much detail, he likes the way they show off his….well, you know. Himbos don’t have too many inhibitions.” Wayne finished pulling up his gold suit and swung the shed door open.<br />
<br />
Sunlight flooded on the two underdeveloped friends as they stood in Jake’s back yard, with Wayne’s unruly blond mop and Jake’s short black hair standing in contrast to their pale, hairless bodies.  Wayne had a little more muscle than Jake, but neither would be called athletic.  And while not pudgy neither was overweight by any means.  Wayne had started the freshmen fifteen at colllege, but had managed to keep it more to seven or eight.<br />
<br />
He took out two pills and looked at them.  “Damn I get stupid when I take these.” He looked over his underdeveloped frame, feeling his nonexistent pecs and noticing the unimpressive bagginess of the gold posing suit he was wearing. <br />
<br />
He took a deep sighing breath and handed a pill to Jake, “OK, ready to see what the experience is all about?”, he looked at Jake.<br />
<br />
“I really don’t want to be a sex-crazed man beast for the rest of the day,” Jake took the pill and palmed it.<br />
<br />
“Who knows who you’ll be? We saw bikers, leather bears, daddies, powerlifters, polar bears, the whole spectrum of bear-dom while we were at Ursatown….,” Wayne looked down at his hands, nervously, “and….um… personally _experienced_ those guys too.”<br />
<br />
He shuddered as memories of the week and his participation in every sexual act he’d ever heard of, and more than a few he’d never imagined, flashed through his mind. He looked at the pill, contemplating an uninhibited repeat, this time with his friends. He quickly added, “You might become any of those, or you might even end up a dumbass himbo like me. Cubbie would like that. And anyway, we’ve got to help your brother. Trust me, the rut is real and if we don’t give Pops somebody to have ‘fun’ with, he’s going to leave that house and then how are you going to explain a DILF ex-bodybuilder parading around half - or fully - naked to your neighbors? There’s a reason this stuff is restricted to the resort.  Don’t worry, I’ve brought enough stuff in the duffle bag to accommodate whatever you become.  I just recommend the posers first because whoever you turn into, those will probably fit.”</p>
