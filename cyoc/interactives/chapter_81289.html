<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You sure?&quot;  Jessica asked, one eyebrow quirked and inviting.  &quot;This is a heck of a chance to experiment--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah.&quot;  Nick said. &quot;I mean, you caught me earlier.  I just...took care of myself.  I couldn't bone you if <br />
I wanted to.&quot;  His member twitched, sadly, in agreement.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I could set your refractory period to zero.  I saw it while I was sifting through the settings earlier--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aaand what if your boyfriend shows up?&quot;  Nick said, laughing nervously and feeling a little uncomfortable <br />
with his roommate having an answer ready for him that quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.  Well, we're not going out right now.&quot; Jessica said, helpfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, that's too--wait a second.&quot;  Nick said, his voice going from a feminine sympathetic coo--if in a <br />
masculine voice--to a stony realization.  &quot;You'd have told me if you'd broken up.  Did you use the computer <br />
thingy to make you not-an-item?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kinda?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...define 'kinda.'&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the Chronivac only does mass-rewriting of memories around a change.&quot;  Jessica said.  &quot;And that's really <br />
just making them 'normal' within the guidelines given.  Yeah, I'm sexy now, but all that means is that the <br />
world remembers I've always been hot.  You're a guy, but you've been single all your life, just having some <br />
platonic, non-romantic relationships with other guys.  You've never had a girlfriend, let alone had <br />
sex...though not for lack of interest.&quot;  She gave Nick a flirty wink.  &quot;Anyway, I could change _his_ memories <br />
so we were never going out, but everyone else would remember and someone would ask him and it would be weird, <br />
so I figured, hey, why not just use the Chronivac to do something to him and get him out of the picture?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, there's some sort of Random button.  I just hit that.  He's, like, a girl now, or a dog, or a girl dog, <br />
or a miscarriage or something.  I never met him, now, and so?  I'm single.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don't worry.&quot;  Jessica rolled her eyes.  &quot;I set it for twenty-four hours, and at the end of that he'll be <br />
right back where he was, maybe even in mid-sentence, and then he'll go on like nothing ever happened.  And <br />
about half an hour after that...Well, he'll come over, we'll screw, and maybe I'll give him a larger cock for <br />
the hell of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jess?&quot;  He walked toward her, and she grinned for a moment, only to be shocked when he forced his way past <br />
her.  &quot;This is fucked up.  All kinds of fucked up.  If I gotta change myself back, I will.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nick, don't mess around with that.&quot;  Jessica seemed worried, all of a sudden.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, what's the worst that's gonna happen?  I'm going to write myself out of the world?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's all sorts of little settings.  That's really powerful, and if you don't know what you're doing--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't know what I'm doing?!&quot;  Nick looked over his shoulder.  &quot;You might have just retroactively aborted your <br />
boyfriend and you think I don't know what I'm doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you could rewrite memories for individuals, set triggers for future changes associated with those <br />
memories, and lay traps for people who aren't doing what you want them to!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I wouldn't--&quot;  He turned back toward his roommate's bedroom, and then paused in midstep.  That was kind <br />
of disturbingly specific and applicable to the moment. &quot;What are you getting at--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember the baseball game?&quot; Jessica's voice was no longer pleading, nor commanding.  It was, if anything, <br />
shy and kittenishly affectionate.<br />
<br />
Nick hesitated, and turned with a smile.  &quot;Of course.&quot;  He said.  Somewhere inside, he felt something distant <br />
and troubling--the sensation of having forgotten something terribly important, and then forgetting that he <br />
forgot at all--and then put it from his mind, his roommate lounging against the doorframe.<br />
<br />
&quot;We had a bet riding on that, didn't we?&quot;  She said, the shyness starting to give way to something a little <br />
bolder.  It had been a drunken wager, but now that Jessica mentioned it his memory came clear as day.  &quot;Your <br />
team wins, you get me.  My team wins, I get you.&quot;<br />
<br />
He hesitated, deeply confused--Jessica had walked in on him minutes ago, after he had ejaculated, and he <br />
wasn't ready for another go-round quite yet.  And he'd told himself that he'd wait until marriage or <br />
something--that he wasn't ready for sex.  But enough beers, and he'd at least been willing to joke about it.<br />
Jessica started to advance like a predator, like a horny tigress.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Um.  Who won?&quot;  He asked.  He wasn't worried as such, but he was starting to feel quite a bit nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does it matter?&quot;  She said, resting a hand on his chest--oh, shit, he was still naked, wasn't he?--and <br />
pushing him back just slightly.  It wasn't enough to force him at all, but he was having trouble forming the <br />
presence of mind to resist.<br />
<br />
Her fingers reached through his tangled hair and pulled him down into a hungry kiss.  Nick hadn't even <br />
realized he was undoing the buttons on her blouse until it fell to the floor.  Her pants and camisole followed  <br />
seconds later, falling in an enticing breadcrumb trail toward her bedroom.<br />
<br />
Nick also didn't realize how close he was to Jessica's bed until he ran right into it; he tumbled with a yelp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah!&quot;  He fell with a loud *thump!* and Jessica's lust parted for just a moment as she watched, and laughed.<br />
<br />
Nick's flaccid cock still sat there, looking despondent as it twitched. &quot;Sorry, Jess.  I mean...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Nick.&quot;  She said--not quite on the bed, but planting a trail of kisses across his jaw, and down his chest <br />
and belly, stopping short of his thick, dark pubic hair and cock.  &quot;I think I can work around that.&quot;  And she <br />
turned to her computer.  &quot;Lemme just shut down a few windows.&quot;  She said, as she absently traced her nails <br />
down the inside of one hairy thigh.  &quot;It'd kinda suck if my friends Skyped in right now, you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot;  he laughed, slightly raggedly.  &quot;that'd be a story for my first time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mm-hm!&quot;  Jessica said.  &quot;So just lay right there and...&quot;<br />
<br />
&lt;Click!&gt;<br />
<br />
SET REFRACTORY PERIOD VALUE:<br />
<br />
0 hours. <br />
0 minutes.<br />
0 seconds.<br />
<br />
&lt;click!&gt;<br />
<br />
ARE YOU SURE?<br />
<br />
&lt;click!&gt;<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Told you it was simple.&quot;  Jessica said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;  Nick said, vaguely aware of the sudden tension in between his legs as his cock began to surge up <br />
proudly once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing.&quot;  Said Jessica, straddling him, planting one hand on his chest, and starting to grind herself <br />
against Nick's hardening, hungry erection through the fabric of her panties.  &quot;Just...mmmmmnnothing.&quot;</p>
