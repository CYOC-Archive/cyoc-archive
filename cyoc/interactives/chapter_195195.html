<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hmmm. They must be out or somethin. We&#39;re up and about a bit late in the day. I&#39;ll shoot Milo a text.&quot; Ollie shrugged after knocking before pulling out his phone, &quot;No worries though. I absolutely need some coffee. You hungry?&quot; He typed out a quick message:<br />
<br />
<i>&#39;Where are you?&#39;</i><br />
<br />
Curtis nodded, his floppy ears bobbing adorably. Ollie couldn&#39;t help but grin again, though it turned into a full smile when the soon-to-be dog tilted his head, probably subconsciously. &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothin. I just like yer ears. And yer face.&quot; He couldn&#39;t help but smile again as Curtis started to turn red, his tail betraying him. Ollie got a strange thrill in his chest whenever he made his new friend reveal his feelings. He was usually so reserved and tightly-wound, and the peek into his mind? Well, he might&#39;ve just gotten a new favorite hobby.<br />
<br />
Last night had been one of those nights you tell your kids about: when you meet someone you vibe with, and things just click. And how would you ever know without taking that chance and saying hi? Wasn&#39;t the first week of college all about meeting people anyway? New people didn&#39;t scare Ollie. They were an exciting new opportunity, even if it wasn&#39;t obvious.<br />
<br />
Hell, he&#39;d always been one to take on personal projects. In High School he was the one to sit with the new kid, or invite the outcast to hang out. Life was too short to feel alone--better to stick together. <i>Find your flock. HA!</i> He laughed at his own joke, and then harder at Curtis&#39; confusion expression. He couldn&#39;t stop smiling, even with his missing teeth. Today was a good day, but it&#39;d be even better with coffee.<br />
<br />
Curtis let out a small yelp, tensing as Ollie grabbed his hand and started towards the student union building, but he held on tightly. &quot;C&#39;mon. I bet the mornin rush is over by now. Didja wanna get yer stuff before or after breakfast?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, either works. I just need to be there before it closes at 5. Do you have anything you need to pick up?&quot; Curtis asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I haven&#39;t checked. Probably? I&#39;m starved. Let&#39;s grab somethin to eat first. Maybe we&#39;ll run into Milo on the way, or his roommate. And I met this other guy that&#39;s turning into a tiger--Sam. Have you met anyone yet?&quot; He realized he was walking a little fast and slowed down so Curtis could walk next to him instead of being dragged behind. He was naturally a quick walker, though he realized Curtis had slowed his walking at the question.<br />
<br />
&quot;...No. Just you, really. And Shro, but that was just now.&quot; Curtis looked embarrassed and on the verge of closing up again. Ollie needed to act quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I can&#39;t keep you all to myself! Not a problem. At all. Hell, I bet Milo will even wanna take yer picture.&quot;<i> There was that adorable head tilt again.</i><br />
<br />
&quot;What?!...No! I thought I was just going to watch you.&quot; Curtis looked mortified but distracted as they continued forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Naww. With those ears? Pssh. We gotta get that on camera! Can&#39;t keep fur like that to yourself. And that&#39;s not even mentioning your <i>eyes</i>.&quot; <i>There was that tail again. And the butterflies.</i> &quot;Actually, my changing eyes are the reason Milo wanted to take my picture in the first place. Though I was the one who offered to get nekkid.&quot;<br />
<br />
Curtis stopped walking completely. <i>Whoops. Too far.</i> &quot;Oh, I guess I didn&#39;t realize what kind of photoshoot it was. I thought it would just be close-ups or something.</i><br />
<br />
Ollie shrugged. &quot;I mean, everything&#39;s gonna change, right? So might as well get everything from the get-go.&quot; It made perfect sense to him, but he could see why it might&#39;ve been a bit much for Curtis.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you don&#39;t mind that I was going to watch?&quot; Was that a hopeful tone in his voice? His ears were sure perking up...<br />
<br />
&quot;Hell nah. I&#39;m not shy! It&#39;s just my body. Besides it&#39;s not like I&#39;m gonna look the same for much longer anyway, right? Might as well get somethin so I can compare.&quot; Ollie&#39;s explanation seemed to be working as Curtis began to move again. &quot;Don&#39;t you want to remember what you looked like before?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really? I guess. But I&#39;m not ready to get naked or anything like that.&quot; <i>Close enough.</i><br />
<br />
&quot;You do you. Though I sure hope you change yer mind.&quot; He winked and Curtis started to turn red again. <i>This was too much fun.</i><br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
&quot;I still can&#39;t believe you don&#39;t like coffee!&quot; Ollie said exasperatedly as they waited for their drinks. &quot;How can you not?! It&#39;s like a kick in the mouth that keeps you goin!&quot;<br />
<br />
Curtis&#39; ears splayed for a moment as he shook his head. &quot;It&#39;s too bitter. And it doesn&#39;t play nicely with my IBS.&quot; His eyes widened as though he&#39;d just said too much.<br />
<br />
&quot;It might balance you out then, Sweet Thing.&quot; He nudged Curtis&#39; arm playfully. It was a corny thing to say, but it produced the desired effect as the tail went to waggin again. <i>There&#39;s the good stuff.</i><br />
<br />
&quot;I run on coffee, and I mean that literally. I would always grab a venti before any of my meets. And one on the way home too. It&#39;s probably a good thing I was exercisin so much, or my heart probably woulda exploded.&quot; He laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ollie?&quot; The drinks were ready, and he walked over to pick them up--his venti double-shot and Curt&#39;s iced chai latte with strawberry puree. It was an unusual combination, but sounded good. He&#39;d have to ask Curtis for a sip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here ya go, Dog. Thanks for humorin me.&quot; His phone chirped and he handed Curtis his drink before fishing out his phone.<br />
<br />
<i>&#39;Grabbing breakfast. Meet us in the Dining Hall if you want.&#39;</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like we had the right idea.&quot; He grinned and showed Curtis the text. &quot;Shall we?&quot; He proffered his hand, which the future-dog took after a moment of hesitation and they started towards the Dining Hall, but immediately stopped as Curtis began to sputter and cough, leaning forward as his drink went everywhere. &quot;You OK over there?&quot;<br />
<br />
Curtis looked shocked, and he was covered in chai tea. His tail was curled up against his leg and his ears were flat on his head. &quot;I don&#39;t know what happened. I went to take a drink and my tongue got in the way or something. Like it doesn&#39;t fit in my mouth correctly.&quot; He was talking a little funny, but it was cute. He stuck his tongue out and it was indeed longer, and more flat. &quot;It took me by surprise...Fuck! I got it everywhere.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ollie immediately started towards the coffee shop again but spun and pointed at Curtis first. &quot;Stay!&quot; He ran and grabbed a fistful of napkins and sprinted back as Curtis continued to shake off his hands before adjusting the lid to his drink, holding it out. His tail was <i>not</i> wagging and he looked like he wanted to die. &quot;Napkins!&quot; He handed over a few and started blotting at the wet spots on Curt&#39;s shirt and pants. &quot;I don&#39;t think it will stain, so you don&#39;t have to worry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I should go change my clothes. Again.&quot; Curtis shook his head, looking defeated. &quot;Actually, you just go without me, OK?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not a chance, buddy. Here.&quot; Ollie handed over his drink and pulled off his hoodie. &quot;Wear this. No one will know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Curtis didn&#39;t look convinced, but his tail wasn&#39;t clamped against his leg anymore. &quot;Are you sure...?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ollie nodded and held out his hands to take the drinks before waiting for him to pull on the hoodie. &quot;See? You can&#39;t even see it.&quot; He grinned as Curtis&#39; ears perked back up and his tail relaxed. The ears and tail felt like cheating, but he was having fun. So much fun in fact, that...&quot;Hey Curtis? Actually, you missed a spot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Curtis looked down, trying to figure out what he meant as Ollie stepped up to him and their eyes met. &quot;Right here.&quot; He leaned forward and kissed Curtis on the lips as they stood in the middle of the walkway. The tail was going crazy now, and Curtis looked adorably flustered, though Ollie felt a light lick as he pulled away.<br />
<br />
<i>Too. Fuckin&#39;. Easy.</i><br />
<br />
Ollie made a show of smacking his lips. &quot;Hmm. Strawberry and Chai <i>is</i> a pretty good combination, though I&#39;ll probably still have them put a shot or two of espresso in it.&quot; He grabbed the dog&#39;s hand again and started walking as though nothing had just happened, though he wore a shit-eating grin, not realizing as a cleft split his top lip.<br />
<br />
<i>It was a good fuckin&#39; day.</i></p>
