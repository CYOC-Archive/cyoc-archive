<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake hinted for food or animals he could use for food. He found a shrub some small bird like creatures were eating with somewhat edible leaves and fruit and ate his small fill through an hatch that allowed his hands to grab the plant and through gloves feed himself After sometime he didn’t feel bad and no side effects he found so he documented the plant as edible and it didn’t taste bad either. He proceeded deeper into the tropical woods. No animals in sight aside from a few chipmunk squirrel like creatures who were to fast to catch.the only way would be to trap them Jake thought. Just then a vine and limb came crashing down on him breaking his helmet glass. Picking himself up and panicking he soon realized there was no alternative and stripped out of his suit to his trousers and laid his suit at camp crafting a makeshift spear he walked the path he had created but this time proceeded further into the forest than he had ever been before. Surprised he ended up Crashing down an embankment and coming too he was bewildered at how far he had fallen. He couldn’t climb back up. Great he thought he had to find another way up. Climbing up the side of the ravine was too hard so he followed it to a pleasant small pool of water at an area looking like an oasis he quickly grabbed some water and tasted it having been so thirsty it tasted fine so he drank and hoped for the best. He hopped into the water to bathe in his trousers and was so tired he ended up taking a small nap on the shore. He was startled awake by rope like tendrils that had slowly worked their way into wrapping around him in his sleep. They began moving faster even picking him up off the ground. The more he struggled the tighter they got he bucked and strained all the more feeling the plant stems crawling up his trouser underpants. Through his armpits around his neck and close to his mouth. He looked over to see a beautiful red flower and was scared for a moment he would be eaten. The stems momentarily secreted a sticky sap on his body and Suddenly his body felt very relaxed he could still feel everything as the tendrils wrapped around his testicles and penis in his drawers. He felt tendrils move toward his hole and made him quiver and buck in the air again fighting to not have this happen. The tendrils tore his drawers off him as they grew. And suddenly he found himself very aroused against his own will. Blood moving toward his penis making it stand on end. It was like what the plant wanted because a tendril began rope around his hard dick from the base to the tip just tight enough to feel good and when it secreted more sap he felt waves of pleasure ripple his being causing his balls to tingle and him to illicit a small moan straining his arms to get free he felt a tendril enter his pee hole and travel inside him causing him to shiver an feel a pleasure he had never experienced before it seemed to go deeper and deep till it felt like it wrapped around his prostate the stem swelling slightly in his urethra he had nerve experienced this before and was holding super still as he didn’t want to be permanently damaged the stem flexed in his cock which made his cock flex the pleasure was unbearable and he was so audible anyone could hear. Moaning and yelling and feeling waves of sensation akin to a climax for a very very long time. He felt a tendril prod his asshole gently again he puckered up but it entered anyway going super deep curious and wanting to figure him all out. Another one joined it. Then another he watched in almost shock and again mixed with pleasure wanting this to end but also feeling too good. A giant knot like bud in the end of one of the tendrils struck its self up to his bum hole which was being widened and stretched open by the other tendrils. Oh no oh no oh no he thought before it was shoved up deep beside his prostate feeling an ejaculation building he was worried it wouldn’t be able to get out but the tendril in his pp must’ve senses something because it began to infurl and leave his pee hole just as the seven exited the hole and sprayed all over him the plant and the jungle floor. He felt a small crack as the bud broke off inside his hole and the tendrils left and sat him down and the plant returned to normal hyperventilating he wondered if the water caused hallucinations. Feeling very homesick but still thirsty he drank more of the water and immediately felt sick from something he stumbled over to beside the plant that had abused him and crashed to his hands and knees he vomited and felt another wave of arousal hit his being. Knocking him onto his butt he felt the bud or whatever the plant had put inside him was growing and swelling inside him. He felt blood rush to his face and his dick his balls tingled and he grew stedily more aroused until he burst uncontrollably with nothing touching him and immediately felt another rising up right after and cumming again and then again and again he was sweating and at this point begging for it to be over as he came again groaning from the pleasure he felt the bud crack open inside him and came a last time this one almost painful a pearly white liquid suddenly drained from his ass and as he bent over and pushed it gushed out of his hole. Limping he returned to camp barely finding a way to climb back to the beach before dark his belly now swelling unnoticably. He fell fast asleep.</p>
