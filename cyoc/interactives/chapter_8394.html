<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Scott watched Saul head in to Tim's house through the rear door with a box under his <br />
arm.  The delays this morning were really starting to try his patience.  First Tim is <br />
nowhere to be found, and now Saul is running around doing who-knows-what, the <br />
muscular man fumed while hefting one of the biggest pieces out of the way for the <br />
other workers.  The ground vibrated as it slammed into the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep working,&quot; Scott said in his deep voice.  &quot;I'm going to go find out what the delay <br />
is in the office,&quot; and with that he jogged to the same door Saul had passed through.  <br />
The door was still ajar, and as he approached, he heard Tim and Saul's voices, though <br />
they sounded a little higher than usual.  &quot;Hey!&quot; he called out as he shoved open the <br />
door.<br />
<br />
There were two figures in the kitchen, facing away from him.  The sun was bright <br />
outside and it was taking a second for Scott's eyes to adjust to the darkness.  One <br />
figure was a little shorter than Tim, and dressed in something red.  The other looked <br />
like a child in a costume, with big rabbit ears stretching up.  The child jumped at his <br />
sudden arrival, appearing to levitate.  The other figure turned its head, and Scott saw <br />
an enormous fox looking back at him -- more than twice the size of any fox he'd ever <br />
seen, and standing upright!  It's back was to him, but its flexible neck allowed the <br />
head to swivel most of the way around to face Scott.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; Scott shouted again, now trying to scare the animals and run them out of the <br />
house.  There was nothing obvious nearby to grab as a weapon, and while Scott felt <br />
secure in his strength, he knew it was important to startle the animals out of trying <br />
their teeth and claws on him.  He was near a chair with a box on it, and with a swift <br />
kick he sent the box and chair flying across the room.<br />
<br />
There was a cracking noise, and the lid to the box sprang open as it rotated in space.  <br />
He watched as a fine mist of dust sprinkled down on the two oversized animals as <br />
they fled into the house.  The box clattered on the floor.<br />
<br />
That hadn't been quite the direction Scott wanted them to go, but at least he had <br />
them on the run.  He left the door wide open, and went around the table to pick up <br />
the fallen chair.  The box had fallen with its lid open, and he felt something push in <br />
as he grabbed it off the floor.  There was a flash, and he dropped the box, startled.  It <br />
landed closed this time, and he picked it up again.  There were five gemstones on the <br />
front which had survived his kick, but there were also some locks which were now <br />
ruined.  He frowned, and decided to apologize later, taking the box with him into the <br />
living room.  Right now he wanted to flush those animals out of the house and vent <br />
his frustrations on Tim and Saul for running off.<br />
<br />
Scott had barely gone three steps before he felt an uncomfortable pressure in his <br />
groin.  He tried to shove one hand into his pants, but the material was stretched tight <br />
and it was starting to hurt.  With a mighty yank, he pulled open his fly and felt an <br />
immediate relief of pressure.  Looking down, he was shocked to see his swollen sex.  <br />
He knew he was &quot;gifted&quot;, but each nut was now almost as big as a tennis ball, and his <br />
dick was spilling out of his underwear.  He felt the hint of an erection run the length <br />
of his penis as it swelled another half-inch.  Setting the box down on the coffee table, <br />
Scott sat down on the couch and let his pants fall around his ankles.  The animals <br />
would have to wait for a few minutes.<br />
<br />
* = * = * =<br />
<br />
Saul thought his heart was going to burst when Scott kicked the box.  Suddenly it was <br />
beating so hard and so fast, he easily sprinted out of the kitchen, but not before his <br />
white fur was coated by something from the box.  Tim was also running, up the stairs <br />
by the sound of it.  Saul's rabbit instincts were in full control now, and he didn't even <br />
think of going near the fox -- he knew he needed to hide, and fast.<br />
<br />
There was an obvious place to hide in the room, behind the recliner that sat across <br />
the room from the couch.  Saul jumped onto the back of the recliner and his feet <br />
scrambled against the wall as he tried to fit.  &quot;This would be perfect if I wasn't so <br />
damn big!&quot; he thought, adrenaline pounding in his temples.<br />
<br />
His head started to swim, and he bounced over next to the couch, and squished <br />
himself next to an end table.  Scott was moving through the kitchen, and the sound <br />
of the chair scraping as the human hefted it off the floor grated in Saul's keen ears.  <br />
He tried to settle down, but he felt too exposed.  He closed his eyes and tried to <br />
relax.  Too exposed.  The chair clattered on the kitchen floor as Scott stood it up <br />
properly.<br />
<br />
The noise was too much.  Saul could see Scott out of one of his sharp eyes, and Scott <br />
seemed enormous, muscular, and powerful.  &quot;Flee!&quot; the voices in Saul's head <br />
screamed, and he lept into motion again.  In two jumps, he was wedged between the <br />
recliner and the wall.  The window sill seemed far above, as he crouched.  Looking <br />
ahead, the space behind the recliner now seemed spacious, and with another jump <br />
and a kick, he was breathing heavily, but feeling a lot safer.<br />
<br />
As his breathing slowed, he heard Scott enter the room.  He inched forward, <br />
concerned that his tail was exposed for the large man to see.  With a tilt of his head, <br />
he looked back and saw that there was no problem fitting his whole body behind the <br />
chair.  He wondered why he hadn't dashed back here in the first place, and tried to <br />
figure out why he didn't fit before.<br />
<br />
Saul blinked, and his vision started to settle down after being jumpy.  The chair <br />
seemed to be moving next to him, slowly sliding away.  In fact, it seemed to be <br />
getting larger in all dimensions.  He heard Scott yank open his fly, and curiosity was <br />
stirred.  Saul had to see what was happening, so he crept forward to peek around the <br />
corner of the chair.  The corner seemed to move away as he approached, and his <br />
human mind realized that he had shrunk -- a lot, and he was still shrinking.  He was <br />
alarmed by this, but only slightly, as it was keeping him hidden.  His instincts were <br />
designed for a small body, and he could probably get much smaller before shrinking <br />
was a cause for worry.<br />
<br />
Finally, he peeked out from the chair and saw the cavernous room open before him.  <br />
The coffee table separated him from Scott, and the box now rested on the table.  Saul <br />
froze, knowing that any motion might attract the attention of this large predator.  But <br />
the predator wasn't even looking in his direction.  Instead, it was rubbing a huge <br />
boner -- at least as big as Saul's whole body -- into the dark fur on it's chest.  Under <br />
the table, with its other hand, it supported gigantic testicles against the force of <br />
gravity.<br />
<br />
Tim had been hung, but even he was nothing like this.  Saul shivered with excitement <br />
as he shrank, seeing Scott's temptation swelling before his eyes.</p>
