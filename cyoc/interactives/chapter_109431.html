<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Loki said swimming was a natural ability for mice and after some minutes, Brandon was a professional swimmer. He can overtake his granfather with no problem and to make two laps while his father was doing one.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a born swimmer, Brandon!&quot; Loki said. &quot;With your abilities I&#39;m sure we won&#39;t lose. Erik on the other hand...&quot; He thought what to do with his slowest member. &quot;I&#39;m not sure if you can fulfill my expectations... maybe you need some more practice...&quot;<br />
<br />
Loki used his magic to pick Brandon and turn him back to human. Brandon&#39;s body grew again to his previous size. Fur dissappeared from his skin as his muzzle and tail retracted inside him. After some seconds, Brandon was the seven year old kid he was before. He was naked for an instant but almost immediately a speedo appear on him.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was incredible!&quot; Brandon said. &quot;I didn&#39;t know swimming was too fun!&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad you liked it!&quot; Loki said. &quot;That&#39;s the attitude we need to win! Ok, we will wait a couple of minutes more and I turned you back too, Kyle and Erik!&quot;<br />
&quot;Meanwhile... Can I go outside?&quot; Brandon said. &quot;I wanna feel the pool&#39;s water.&quot;<br />
&quot;Feel? Alright. You can go.&quot; Loki said and Brandon ran out from that place. &quot;Ok, Kyle. I think you&#39;re ready. Erik let&#39;s see those paws in action!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle turned back to normal and he went out to see his grandson. Loki stayed with Erik for some minutes more when he heard a message from a speaker that said the competition it was going to begin. Loki sighed because he didn&#39;t see any progress in Erik&#39;s performance and they didn&#39;t have more time to practice. He turned Erik back to human and both boys ran to where Kyle and Brandon were waiting for them.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you do, dad?&quot; Brandon asked Erik.<br />
&quot;Terrible!&quot; Loki interfered. &quot;We need to be incredible to compensate his lack of ability.&quot; <br />
&quot;Hey! I&#39;m not that bad!&quot; Erik yelled. &quot;It&#39;s just that my feet are too small.&quot;<br />
&quot;My feet are smaller than yours.&quot; Loki said.<br />
&quot;But you&#39;re a god! You can be good at anything!&quot; Erik yelled.<br />
&quot;I can give you bigger feet if you want it.&quot; Loki snapped and Erik&#39;s feet grew a size. &quot;But that won&#39;t make a difference&quot;<br />
&quot;Stop discussing! The competition is going to start!&quot; Kyle said. &quot;Look! The other kids are already taking their positions.&quot;<br />
&quot;But we need a plan!&quot; Brandon said. &quot;It&#39;s a relay race!&quot;<br />
&quot;Ok, we will do this.&quot; Loki said. &quot;Me first, then Kyle, then Erik and finally you, Brandon, ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
Everybody nodded. Brandon was amazed that he was the last one because that means he has more responsability than the others.<br />
He and Kyle took their positions in the left side of the pool and Loki and Erik did the same on the right. When they were alone, Loki threatened Erik that he will turn him into a cabbage if they don&#39;t win the race. Erik was scared and promised he would do his best.<br />
When all the kids were in their positions a shot sounded and Loki jumped to the pool with sublime elegance. He swam like a torpedo almost as his feet weren&#39;t moving. After a moment, he arrived to the other side and Kyle jumped immediately. He wasn&#39;t as fast as Loki but he was average like the most of the kids in the competition. At least, they were still winning, with almost all the other kids far behind them, except for one team whose father was the swimming couch and he was shouting at them as he was expecting to win.<br />
After some minutes of swimming, Kyle arrived to the other side and he made a sign to Erik to jump who was a little frighted because of Loki&#39;s threat. He swam as fast as he could but it was obvious he wasn&#39;t enough fast to keep the first place and after a couple of minutes he was surpassed by the other team. When he arrived to the other side, Brandon jumped instantly but he didn&#39;t see him, he was too scared of Loki&#39;s face who was threatening.<br />
Brandon was doing his best to recover the leadership and he was moving his feet as fast as a professional swimmer. He was incredible fast but the other kid was very fast too. They were too close when they arrived to the goal. It was too close that the teachers needed to deliberate for a moment. Meanwhile, Loki was furious with Erik and he was to turn him into a carrot when the teachers came back and announed the winners.<br />
Despite the coach&#39;s compaints the teachers had decided that Brandon and Loki&#39;s performance were too outstanding to don&#39;t consider them as very good swimmers and they were too amazed of how Brandon can move his legs so fast. They were chosen victors and recieved medals and a golden trophy.<br />
<br />
&quot;We won after all!&quot; Brandon shouted happily. &quot; We&#39;re the best!&quot;<br />
&quot;That was too close...&quot; Erik sighed. &quot;I was thinking that I will end in someone&#39;s salad!&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s soon to say that.&quot; Loki said. &quot;You need to win the other competition if you don&#39;t want to be an onion!&quot;<br />
&quot;The students competition is over.&quot; A voice said through the speaker. &quot;Now, the teachers competition will begin in a moment. We remember you that this competition is in couples, so we need both teachers in the registration line.&quot;<br />
&quot;Did you hear that?&quot; Kyle said. &quot;Just two people can be in a team.&quot;<br />
&quot;But we are four&quot; Brandon said. &quot;We could divide us and to create two teams.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s unfair. The one where Loki would be could have an unfair advantage. I suggest just our two best swimmers go to compete.&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not a bad idea, Erik.&quot; Loki said. &quot;But the other two can be a good help two.&quot;<br />
<br />
Loki grinned as his sparkly magic began to float around them.</p>
