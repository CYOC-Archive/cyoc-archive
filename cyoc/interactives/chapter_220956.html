<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan floated helplessly in the jar in the dark cupboard.  Apparently,  his soul radiated actual light instead of just being highly reflective, as he could dimly see the other objects on the shelf with him. One was a metal talisman inscribed with arcane words. There was a miniature book, open to a spell.  He was sure that Kat had read it before setting it in the cupboard next to him. He figured it was important, and tried to read it. His light was too dim to read. <br />
<br />
He stewed there angrily thinking about all the evils his sister had done to him, and how he could get even. He suddenly noticed that he was shining brighter, and he could read the book now. As his anger faded so did his light.<br />
<br />
Dan said, &quot;Oh, it&#39;s like the Darkside in Star Wars! Anger is power.&quot; He concentrated on his anger and glowed brightly. Then he pressed his gaseous being against the side of the jar and read the caption in the small book, &quot;How to make your own genie&quot;.<br />
<br />
It began with capturing a tortured innocent soul. The more wronged and angry the captured soul is the stronger the genie slave would be.  The open page mentioned a talisman to use to enslave the genie when it has fully fermented. There were more instructions on the following pages, but how could Dan turn the pages. If he was a Genie or becoming one maybe he could will the page to turn. Maybe the spell on the talisman would help him master his powers,  make him master of himself. He shifted to the other side of the jar and focused his anger. He read and repeated the inscription again and again. The letters on the disk began to glow. He kept repeating the words. They had to be doing something.  Repeating the words on the talisman, stewing in his anger, and attempting to will the pages were the only thing he could do in her current state. It seemed like forever since Kat had done this to him.<br />
<br />
Kat had trouble falling asleep. She knew the soul of her kid brother was fermenting into a genie.  It would take centuries of fermenting to create a powerful genie, but time in the other dimension where her cabinet was located moved faster than real time. Each hour of her time was 100 years for Dan. In 8 hours or 800 years, she could complete the spell, and make her wish. It would take all of the power of an 800 year old genie to grant her wish, and then Dan would truly cease to exist forever, and Kat&#39;s other wish would come true.<br />
<br />
Eventually, she fell asleep.<br />
<br />
She was awakened by a commotion.<br />
<br />
The police were at the house. Her grandmother was packing her suitcase, and telling her, &quot;Hurry up and get dressed, Kat, I am packing your clothes you will be staying with me for a few days. Hurry our plane leaves in an hour.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Plane leaves? Wait why? What&#39;s happening?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened is your brother had been kidnapped. You will be safe in my home in the Catskills in a few hours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Dan wasn&#39;t kidnapped, uh,&quot; Kat couldn&#39;t say we ate him, so she said, &quot;Dan is spending the night at his girlfriend&#39;s house.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, he didn&#39;t.  His girlfriend called last night after you went to bed to check on Dan. He was supposed to come over yesterday afternoon,  but not to spend the night, but he never came. So since he wasn&#39;t there, never came home, and his inhaler and money are still here, your parents called me and the police.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Kat was surprised by these developments.  She had thought she would have time to cast a spell of forgetfulness before it came to this. She might have to use Dan up on a wish for everyone to forget he ever existed. She would rather not do that. But even less did she want to go to granny&#39;s house in the Catskill Mountains.  &quot;If you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;m a young lady now, and I&#39;d like some privacy, please, Granny!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No. I promised your mother that you would not leave my sight until either Dan was found or you were safely in my house. No one can steal you away from my home, Kat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if Dan is never found?&quot;<br />
<br />
Granny&#39;s stared hard at the girl. She asked pointedly, &quot;Why do you say that, Kat?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know.  I guess I&#39;m flustered. I don&#39;t like being afraid, and having to pack and travel at the drop of a hat. &quot;At the drop of a hat&quot; is what you say Granny when you mean all of a sudden or on a whim, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You used the phrase correctly. However the disappearance of a boy without his clothing is cause for alarm, and flight. It is not a sudden whim.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Without his clothing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re mother inventoried his clothing. And the only missing clothing, the police found in the family trash bin behind the house. Now stop dawdling, and dress now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat stole a glance at the wall which hid her interdimensional cabinet. Then hurriedly dressed. She would think of a pretext to slip back and grab the book, talisman and jar.<br />
<br />
Her pretext never came. Kat figured as soon as she was alone, she could teleport home, retrieve her genie, and teleport back.<br />
<br />
She was spirited away to the Catskill Mountains, and Granny&#39;s well warded farmstead.  No one could enter or exit that place without her express permission.  Kat was furious when she found even her powers could not allow her to breach Granny&#39;s 10 Generation Protection Spell. Apparently, each mother and daughter had cast and reinforced the spell. Kat had assumed that because she was blood kin, she could come and go as she pleased. However, the spell granted passage only to the owner of the farm, not blood relatives. <br />
<br />
She sighed.  Well, maybe she could study granny&#39;s spellbooks until her parents gave up on Danny&#39;s search. She doubted she would be here more than 2 weeks. And Danny woukd have fermented for 14 days x 240 years approximately,  so he would be a 3360 year old genie. And the older the genie,  the more powerful its magic. She grinned. So many more wishes before Dan vanished forever. <br />
<br />
In the other dimension,  the soul of her cannibalised brother in the jar glowed nearly as bright as the sun.  The talisman was spinning and glowing too, as Dan chanted the incantation for the umpteenth time. The miniature spellbook was shut now. He had willed ever page to turn as he committed each page to memory. When he had read the book from cover to cover, he willed it shut. The spinning talisman warped the time inside the cabinet so that it moved even faster. Dan was only aware of his anger, his desire for revenge and his growing strength. He would recite the incantation more times than anyone ever had. He would be the greatest Djinn ever. His sister was a powerful witch, she scared him, but when she came for him, it would be her turn to know fear. She hadn&#39;t read her spellbook completely or she would have read the warning never to allow the soul or genie to read either the book or talisman or the witch might lose her power of it.<br />
<br />
Danny glared at the talisman as it began to spin so fast that the shelf began to smoke.</p>
