<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">What luck! Salvador was walking down the familiar street in the Orlando suburb when he spotted the person who he was looking for right away. The Hispanic boy smiles, as he observed the tall teenager who had just rolling the lawn mower out of the garage. It was Peter, the tall, athletic sixteen year-old with short brown hair. He was wearing a t-shirt and shorts, as he was preparing to cut the grass on the front lawn of his cousin’s house.<br />
<br />
“Oye, Pedro! Que pasa? What’s up?” Salvador said out loud, as he approached Peter from the street.<br />
<br />
“Hey Salvador! What’s going on, amigo?” Peter responded, while pushing the lawn mower onto the lawn. Peter turned for a moment and glanced at the opened garage door. His eyes searched for the switch on the wall, which activated the garage door opening device. He sent a small dose of his awesome power at the switch, and the garage door started to slowly roll down, closing off the garage entrance on its own.<br />
<br />
“Pedro, I have a favor to ask of you. I want to help out an amigo of mine at school. He gets bullied and picked on a lot, and I want to ask you if you could meet me out on the schoolyard after school tomorrow? It really bothers me that he gets picked on so much and I want to help him, but I cannot do anything without you being there with me!” Salvador explained to his Transformation Wizard. <br />
<br />
Salvador also had transformation powers, but since he had received those from Peter, he could only use them when he’s near Peter. <br />
<br />
“Sure… What time do you want me to be there?” Peter asked the boy. His high school was right down the street from Salvador’s Middle School, so he knew that it would be relatively easy to meet him there so he could help his friend.<br />
<br />
“Meet me at school around 3:15 in the afternoon. I’ll make sure that Luis will be with me. So, what are you doing right now, Peter?” Salvador asked him.<br />
<br />
“Well, I want to mow the lawn today. We’ve had a lot of rain, and the grass is starting to get too long. I thought today would be perfect to mow the lawn since it is not too cold and the weather is very nice” Peter answered, while pulling the handle on the starter of the lawn mower, igniting the engine.<br />
<br />
“Let me try it. Please, let me mow the lawn for you! I’ll do it for my practice.” Salvador responded, with a big smile on his face.<br />
<br />
Peter nodded and moved back from the lawn mower. Salvador then stepped forward and stared at the mower, directing his power on the handle bars. The mower began to slowly roll forward, creating a trail in the lawn which was going in a straight line, until it reached the end of the lawn. Then Salvador directed the mower to make a half turn and then to come back towards where he and Peter were standing, but just overlapping the first trail left by the mower on its first pass, so that he didn’t miss cutting any grass.<br />
<br />
“Good job. You’ve improved a lot, Salvador! Keep your concentration on the mower, and try to cover all the grass on your first pass. That way, you’ll be finished in no time.” Peter responded as he tried to encourage his young apprentice while he continued to direct the lawnmower across the lawn.<br />
<br />
After about ten minutes he stopped and the mower came to a halt. Peter looked at Salvador, who briefly closed his eyes. <br />
<br />
“What’s the matter? Why did you stop?” Peter asked the thirteen year-old teen.<br />
<br />
“I just got tired of concentrating on the mower. I need to take a break, I guess…” Salvador said, while looking out over the lawn. He had done over half of it already.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry about it. I’ll finish it. But I’ll meet you tomorrow, okay?” Peter asked the boy.<br />
<br />
“Alright! See you tomorrow!” Salvador said, as he started walking towards the street, heading back to his house.<br />
<br />
Just at that moment, Ryan came walking towards the front of the house from the back yard. Salvador felt the giant muscle boy’s footsteps because the ground shook for every step he made. He then turned around and gasped at the site of the towering, ebony muscle boy!<br />
<br />
“Dios mio! Es un gigante!” Salvador said, with his jaw dropping wide open as he saw the giant boy walk towards Peter. <br />
<br />
“Peter, can you help me with my math homework? I know you like math a lot, and I just need some help with this” Ryan said to Peter, while holding the math text book in his huge hand. <br />
<br />
“Sure. Give me five minutes to finish mowing the front lawn and I’ll sit down with you at the coffee table in the kitchen, ok?” Peter responded with a smile, as he looked up at the big muscle boy, who towered over him. He loved teaching math, and Ryan’s education was his main concern ever since he had adopted him as his “big” little brother.<br />
<br />
“Who’s that?” Salvador asked, as he walked back towards Peter while he was pointing his finger at Ryan. <br />
<br />
“Hey Salvador, this is my adopted brother Ryan! Hey you two guys are almost the same age!” Peter responded with a grin on his face. It had just dawned on him that Salvador had not been introduced to Ryan.<br />
<br />
“Cool beans! Hey Ryan, I got a 95 for math in school. Would you like me to help you?” Salvador said, no longer feeling afraid of the giant muscle boy, now that he had been introduced as Peter’s adopted brother.<br />
<br />
“Sure! Climb on my hand and I’ll let you sit on my back, Salvador!” Ryan answered, while lowering his hand to the ground so that Salvador could step on it. Ryan raised the young wizard apprentice to his shoulder, where the boy climbed on it and sat on his shoulder with his legs stretched out in front of him, resting on the top of Ryan’s huge pectorals. The two boys walked into the house through the back door, while Peter finished mowing the front lawn.<br />
<br />
It was the following day, on a Friday afternoon, when the last bell rang at the Middle School, indicating that the last class was over for all students, and they began to celebrate the beginning of the weekend.<br />
<br />
Luis was a short, skinny kid with short, black hair and brown eyes. He had dark brown skin and he liked to wear jeans and t-shirts to school. But he got picked on a lot due to his height, and therefore he was very shy in school. Salvador, who was 7 inches taller than him, noted that Luis was always quiet and sitting by himself, and he decided to make more of an effort to get to know him. Unfortunately for Luis, several of the bigger guys in school had noticed how Luis was always quiet and alone. Not only that, but the fact that Luis was barely 5 feet tall, made him a favorite target for the bullies.<br />
<br />
Omar was a big kid. Standing 6 feet tall and weighing 240 pounds of solid muscle, the boy was the biggest kid in his class and he loved to show that in front of the rest. He wanted nothing more than to rule the school, showing off his strength and size at the expense of the weaker and smaller kids. Kids like Luis were perfect and favorite targets, and Omar looked for ways to taunt them and to humiliate him, just to instill fear and respect into the rest of the student body. Everyone was afraid of Omar, and Omar loved it. But in order to maintain the level of fear and respect, he had to constantly embarrass some of the smaller guys so that no respect would be lost during the school year. It was that time again for Omar to beat up one of the little guys so that the others would be reminded to who was boss at school. He had decided to beat up Luis after school and anyone else who talked to Luis as well. And he noticed that Salvador had been hanging out with him all day long.<br />
<br />
“Kill two birds with one stone” Omar growled quietly, as he slammed his left fist in the palm of his right hand. He waited for Luis and Salvador to make it outside, so that none of the teachers could say anything.<br />
<br />
Salvador and Luis had barely made it passed the door when Omar grabbed the two boys from behind. He then slammed both of them against the brick wall and prepared to lecture them before he would punch them.<br />
<br />
“Alright, you two runts! I see that Luis finally found himself a friend? Good, now I can beat up both of you at the same time!!” Omar growled, as he was holding both Luis and Salvador against the wall.<br />
<br />
“Don’t get your hopes up, dude! I have very powerful friends!” Salvador warned, as he silently wished for Peter to get there.<br />
<br />
“Oh, you got more friends? I would love to meet them!” Omar sneered back.<br />
<br />
“You will meet them right now! Just turn around!” Salvador shouted, as he noticed Peter and Ryan as they walked up to the building, standing right behind Omar.<br />
<br />
“AAAARGH!!” Omar shouted, as he gasped at the site of Peter and Ryan. Peter was wearing his all-white Transformation Wizard uniform, which made him resemble someone who practiced martial arts. He wore his white robe, his white headband and white boots. He had his arms folded in front of his chest, as he was waiting to see what Omar wanted to do to his apprentice and his friend.<br />
<br />
Then Omar looked up and noticed Ryan, the giant muscle boy. He gasped at the size of the boy, who slowly walked closer to him until he stood right in front of the bully. Ryan wore giant sandals on his huge feet, he had on a pair of cutoff jeans, which exposed most of his overly muscular legs, and he had no shirt on at all, exposing his huge pectorals and abdominal muscles for the entire world to see. His giant chest stood out several feet in front of him and his extremely thick and muscular arms were hanging from his titanic shoulders. The ebony boy stood twenty-five feet tall, towering over Omar by nineteen feet, and letting his massive shadow almost make Omar feel like he was standing in the dark while he was looking up to the towering boy with his eyes open wide and his jaw fully dropped open.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Salvador, is this guy bothering you?” Ryan asked, as he lowered his hand, grabbed Omar by the collar of his shirt, and lifted him up until he looked him straight in the eye, keeping his feet dangling almost 18 feet from the ground.<br />
<br />
“Omar, THESE are MY friends! Do you still want to beat us up?” Salvador asked sarcastically, while Ryan held Omar up in the air.<br />
<br />
“Ahh, this mighty little man is a bully? I HATE BULLIES!!” Ryan said out loud, with his mighty voice thundering across the sky, instilling great fear in Omar, whose jaw had dropped wide open out of amazement. Omar was suddenly trembling with fear, as his forehead broke out in sweat, tears rolled from his eyes, and his entire body began to shake. The angry look on Ryan’s face almost caused Omar to become so scared, that the bully almost fainted while being held up over 20 feet in the air. Omar’s face began to turn pale, and his heart felt as if it were pounding in his throat.<br />
<br />
“You can put Omar back down, Ryan. I think he is beginning to understand what it’s like to be bullied, for a change!” Peter calmly ordered the giant muscle boy.<br />
<br />
Ryan put Omar back down on the grassy field in front of the school. But before he could turn around and run, Peter wanted to ensure that Luis would not be bullied by Omar ever again.<br />
<br />
“Not so fast, Omar!” Peter shouted, as Omar tried to run away. Immediately Omar’s body began to levitate about a foot from the ground, and Peter used his psychic powers to make the bully hover back to where Peter was standing and to remain right in between Peter and Salvador while he was hanging suspended in midair.<br />
<br />
“How tall are you, Omar?” Peter asked Omar calmly.<br />
<br />
“I’m six foot even!” the bully answered, practically trembling with fear, since he could not move since his body was still hanging suspended in the air.<br />
<br />
“How tall are you, Luis?” Peter asked Luis next.<br />
<br />
“I’m only 5’1 feet tall…” Luis said softly, not feeling sure why Peter even wanted to know this.<br />
<br />
“Now go take care of your friend, Salvador. Make it so that Omar will never even THINK of bullying Luis again!” Peter instructed Salvador.<br />
<br />
Salvador gave Peter a confused look at first, but then Peter walked up to him and whispered something in his ear. Immediately Salvador showed a wide grin on his face, as he turned around to face his friend Luis, who had no idea what was going on or what Salvador and Peter had in mind to do to him.<br />
<br />
“Don’t be afraid, Luis. You will like what I am about to do to you!” Salvador assured his best friend, who was beginning to feel nervous and uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
First, Luis’ shirt and shorts began to expand, until the shirt was hanging down to his knees. His shorts were suddenly too big and too long for him as well. Salvador began to stare at his best friend, and Luis slowly started to grow taller. His feet got bigger, his legs and arms were longer, and his shoulder became wider. Peter placed Omar down besides Salvador and Luis, and immediately the bully noticed that Luis was now just as tall as him!<br />
<br />
“You have always been the shortest guy in class. Well, Luis, from now on, you’ll be the tallest in our class!” Salvador said out loud, as Luis grew an inch taller than Omar. Then Luis’ chest expanded a little more, his calves grew thicker and his arms became bigger as veins covered his quads and his biceps. Luis became muscular enough to resemble a swimmer, and Omar gasped when the boy turned towards him to show off his new body.<br />
<br />
“You will never pick on Luis again. If you do, then I will ask Ryan to come take care of you!” Salvador warned the bully. Omar turned pale when he saw what happened to Luis. He made a few steps back, turned around, and ran towards the street, leaving Salvador and his friends standing by the building, laughing while he tried to run away as fast as possible.<br />
<br />
“Alright, Ryan! You were awesome!” Salvador cheered, as he gave Ryan a high five. Ryan quickly grabbed the Hispanic boy and gently placed him on his left shoulder.<br />
<br />
Peter quietly walked up to Luis, who was still looking down at his own legs and arms, admiring his new body. <br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, Luis. I will make it so that nobody will wonder how it is possible that you have grown over a foot in one afternoon! Everyone will think that you have always looked like this, and Omar will never pick on you again. I hope you are feeling more confident now, so you won’t feel lonely or shy when you’re at school!” Peter calmly reassured Luis, who was just beginning to get used to his new height.<br />
<br />
Salvador, Luis, Peter and Ryan slowly began to walk towards the street. While they were walking, Luis grabbed hold of Salvador’s arm.<br />
<br />
“Thank you, Salvador! I love my new body! And thanks for taking care of Omar!” Luis whispered.<br />
<br />
“Don’t thank me. Thank Peter and Ryan!” Salvador answered. <br />
<br />
As the foursome walked past the park towards their house, Peter wondered who he would change next. And for Luis, it was one afternoon he would never forget.<br />
