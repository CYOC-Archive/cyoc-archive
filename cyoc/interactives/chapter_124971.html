<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Trent decided to go back to the gay bar to try out a new idea.  He was a God now, and sure looked like one too, so he knew he wouldn’t have any trouble finding a willing partner.  But he didn’t exactly want his partner to be willing.  The merge with Ryan had been enough of that for him.  No, now he wanted to dominate someone.  And he knew just how to do it.  But he needed some clothes first.  He looked through his closet and drawers and found a nice outfit of tight jeans, a white v-neck, and a black leather blazer.  Except when he tried to put them on, he discovered that they were tailored to his old body.  And while he liked how tightly drawn they were on his new muscles, and how they accentuated certain bulges, on other parts of his body they felt uncomfortably tight and looked like they were going to rip.  Trent was disappointed, until he realized he could simply absorb and regrow the clothing.  His skin began to melt to welcome in the new addition, and in moments he was standing naked in front of his mirror again, admiring his perfectly sculpted form.  Slowly he decided to recreate the clothes, and they grew out of his skin like extensions of his body, this time perfectly tailored to his new bulked form.  A roguish smile and wink confirmed that he liked the look.  What he didn’t like as much, though, was the fact that he could still feel through the clothes just as he could through the gloves.  He wondered if he could change that.  He willed his consciousness out of the fabric.  It took a couple tries, but soon the clothes were just plain clothes, on a very sexy man.  He headed back to the gay bar. <br />
<br />
When he entered, he got a lot of stares.  He was clearly the most attractive guy there, and he now had a certain commanding aura about him, part of which he absorbed from Ryan and part of which was the result of the ring.  He began to survey the crowd for his next prey.  A tall, muscular Latino man sitting at the bar caught his attention.  Trent made his way over to the bar and sat a few stools away.  He glanced over at the man to get a better look. He had smooth, rich, tan skin, a strong jawline and cheekbones, square, white teeth, and shiny raven black hair.  He was just as muscular as Trent was, but had a slightly wider frame and tighter clothes.  He was incredibly handsome.  Trent wanted him, wanted to dominate him, and wanted to be him.  But he was busy chatting up a younger white twink sitting next to him.  So Trent decided to try an idea that had occurred to him as soon as he had resolidified.  He took off one of his black leather gloves and placed it on the table.  While no one was looking, he, with the part of his mind inside the glove, turned it into black goo and sent it slithering toward the hot Latino man.  He oozed his way into the man’s drink, and dissolved himself into it.  A few minutes later, the man took a sip.  With part of him now sliding down the man’s throat, Trent brought the rest of the glove back to resolidify on his hand.  In his muscular body, he stood up and walked out of the bar, back home.  <br />
<br />
About an hour later, the Latino man, Carlos, began to feel sick to his stomach.  He was now dancing with the young twink, whom he was trying to get lucky with.  He began to feel more and more nauseous, and decided to sit down for a minute.  Before he could head over to a chair, though, he froze up.  He had lost control of his body.  He became terrified, and tried to call for help, but he couldn’t move his lips.  In fact, they were shaping themselves into a little kind of smirk, an expression Carlos had never made before, but which he had seen another guy who would hang around the bar a lot make quite a few times.  The twink noticed, and began to ask if Carlos was alright, but before he could finish the question, Carlos collapsed into a tan pool of flesh and began slithering toward the door, absorbing his clothes with him.  Numerous guests were startled when the liquid flowed around their feet, but they quickly forgot about it amidst the music and liquor. <br />
<br />
Back at Trent’s house, Trent’s “default” form was sitting on the bed, naked, as he had reabsorbed his clothes.  As he sat there expectantly, a bronze goo began seeping in through the doors.  He smiled to himself.  He resolidified te goo into Catlos’s muscular, nude body.  Shryan lay down on the bed.  Carlos walked up to him.  Trent was both of them.  As Carlos’s body lay down on Shryan’s, Trent felt the rock hard muscles pushing against each other from both sides.  The bodies started making out, and Trent could feel all of the muscles as they pressed together, from the bulging pecs to the thick, hard arms and rough, cobblestone abs to the strong, large legs.  Carlos’s body began to melt again.  Trent relinquished control of it, and fell back into his own merged stud body.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Carlos woke up.  He didn’t know where he was.  He didn’t know WHAT he was.  He couldn’t see or hear anything; he could only feel a warm muscular body taking heaving breaths that seemed to touch him everywhere at once.  Was this his body?  What was he now?  Was he still at the club?  Why did he feel like he was on a bed of some sort?  He tried to get closer to this body.  He started moving.  Oozing?  As soon as he moved, he felt the body he was covering begin to stir.  He heard it moan.  It wasn’t his body.  But maybe it could become his body?  Maybe he could take control of it.  He squeezed himself around the body and began to constrict it.  He flung himself around the head and covered the mouth and nose.  He chained the body to the bed with himself.  But the body started chuckling.  Then, a few seconds later, it began to lose its rigidity.  It began melting, but it was pushing outwards, into Carlos, tightening him more around itself.  All of the sudden, Carlos was full again.  In fact, he felt even more muscular than before. He saw himself nude in the mirror.  He saw he was taller, wider, had a significantly bigger dick, and even had a thick black beard.  But when he tried to stand up, he found that he couldn’t.  He was in a body, but he had no control over it.  Then, in another instant, he was surrounding the body again.  This time he could somehow see the mirror still.  He saw his enhanced body, now wearing his green button-down shirt, unbuttoned, flexing.  God, it looked incredible, the bulging shoulders, arms, and chest straining the fabric of the shirt, the rich caramel skin dancing over the hard abs.  But he wasn’t controlling it.  But he could still feel it inside of him.  But where was he in the mirror?  Or was he.... dear god, he was the shirt!  He saw Trent smirk in the mirror, then strip him off.  He fell onto the floor, then felt himself get hung up in the closet.  Trent looked into the shirt’s “eyes,” said “Thanks for the new skin, bro!”, and closed the closet door, but not before he cycled for a fraction of a second between the bodies of his three hunks, just to show Carlos how inhuman he really was.  Trent was gonna have fun with this power!</p>
