<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ever since she was a wee lass growing up in the Highlands, Muriel Lockhead dreamed of having an adventure. As one can imagine, there wasn&#39;t a lot of excitement to be had in being a Scottish shepherd&#39;s daughter. When Eustace had came to Scotland on business, it was a whirlwind romance between them. He was charming and lovable enough, but one of the major reasons she wanted to marry him was to live in America, a land filled with possibility and excitement. The reality was a bit disappointing. Eustace owned a lemon farm which did pretty well in Alabama&#39;s weather. It was good, honest business, but Muriel was bored to tears with it. At least sheep kept you busy. When Eustace eventually passed, she kept the farm partially out of obligation, but mostly because she was too old to be going off and not knowing what to do with herself.<br />
<br />
Muriel had been good neighbors with Effie Wilcox and was surprised to get an invitation for her to join Animalia. She had heard of that growing community and she couldn&#39;t deny that it was something she&#39;d really want to do. If there was anyplace for adventure, it would be there. She packed up all her things, called a real estate agent about selling the farm, and headed west. Initially, Muriel was planning on becoming a sheepdog. It wasn&#39;t anything fancy, but shepherding would have been a welcome relief for her. But then Muriel found out what Effie had changed into and what the invitations were for specifically. The others were quick to jump at the chance of joining Project Mesozoic and Muriel didn&#39;t hesitate either. And she didn&#39;t just want to become any dinosaur. She had a rather specific one in mind.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re glad that you&#39;re signing up for the aquatic division,&quot; said the scientist, &quot;Most of the other volunteers have signed up for the true dinosaurs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How many others are becomin&#39; sea lizards?&quot; asked Muriel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only one other besides you. You&#39;ll be meeting her after your conversion,&quot; said the scientist, &quot;Now, we&#39;ve been able to collect a lot of fossil samples from different museums, so you can choose from-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What kinda plesiosaurs do ye have?&quot; asked Muriel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me show you,&quot; said the scientist before pulling up a file on the computer. Several images of plesiosaurs viewed from above appeared on the screen. &quot;There are several different kinds, so-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That one,&quot; said Muriel, pointing at the plesiosaur with the longest neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Elasmosaurus</i> I assume you make that choice for the neck, right?&quot; asked the scientist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aye, why shouldn&#39;t I?&quot; asked Muriel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, perhaps I should explain how the necks are supposed to work,&quot; said the scientist before picking up a goose-necked lamp from a nearby table. &quot;I suppose you&#39;re thinking that the neck of an <i>Elasmosaurus</i> is as bendy and flexible as this lamp, right?&quot; he asked, bending the lamp in a few directions.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not like they&#39;re giraffes, right?&quot; asked Muriel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not quite, but not as much as you think,&quot; said the scientist, straightening out the lamp, &quot;You, despite all the extra vertebrate, the spinal column is rather stiff. <i>Elasmosaurus</i> could swing it side to side and up and down in a limited fashion, but it can&#39;t bend its neck as easily as a swan&#39;s.&quot; He demonstrated by moving the lamp as he talked, the neck of it bending, but not to far.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; said Muriel, a bit disappointed.<br />
<br />
&quot;However, considering how much time you&#39;ll be spending on land, I think we can make a few modifications to make your new form more comfortable,&quot; said the scientist.<br />
<br />
&quot;How so?&quot; asked Muriel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we can simply augment the genes relating to the spinal column to include similar genes from an animal much more malleable regarding the shape of its spine,&quot; said the scientist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like a snake, ye mean?&quot; asked Muriel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Precisely. Considering you&#39;ll become an aquatic species that will need plenty of muscles to support yourself out of water and not be crushed by your neck, I would recommend a green anaconda,&quot; said the scientist.<br />
<br />
&quot;So I&#39;m gonna become half anaconda/half dinosaur?&quot; asked Muriel.<br />
<br />
&quot;First off, <i>Elasmosaurus</i> wasn&#39;t a dinosaur. Marine reptiles were distantly related to dinosaurs. And no, you won&#39;t become half-anaconda. You may have similar markings to an anaconda, but this is very common,&quot; said the scientist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ye&#39;ve made other sea lizards before?&quot; asked Muriel.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, but snake DNA has been used to allow fish who lack any fins that can be converted into legs to slither on land,&quot; said the scientist, &quot;In your case, you&#39;ll be getting a serpent&#39;s flexibility.&quot;<br />
<br />
Muriel thought this over briefly. Becoming a plesiosaur was exciting enough just on its own. Becoming part snake barely seemed like anything. And at least it won&#39;t be from a venomous snake. &quot;How long will it take for ye to make this modification?&quot; asked Muriel.<br />
<br />
&quot;A bit of time, but not long,&quot; said the scientist.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
In less time than Muriel would have thought, the serum for her was ready. Muriel requested some privacy as her transformation was going to get a little bit graphic. As such, her doses were in the form of two dermal patches. Once she was stripped down to her bra and panties, she attached them to either side of her neck. She could feel a tingle in her skin as the serum was absorbed. The effects were quick to be noticed. Naturally, it was the neck itself that was the first to show changes. There was a slight creaking and popping as the vertebra in it started to extend before they started multiplying. The changes swept up her neck to affect her head as well. Pretty soon, her face started becoming covered in scales as her white hair started falling out.<br />
<br />
The changes were also working their way from the neck down. Signs of aging started to erase as green scales covered more of her body. Loose skin tightened up as muscles started building. Her knobby knuckles shrank as her fingers became as dainty as they used to be. But then the fingernails started extending into claws as webbing started appearing between the fingers. Her bra became more snug as her breasts started to become firmer before swelling larger than what they had been before. Muriel smiled to herself as she felt her breasts through her bra. It was actually becoming pretty tight now. All it took was a little pulling to rip it off, allowing her lime green melons to spring out, the dark green nipples erect.<br />
<br />
Muriel hadn&#39;t told this to anyone, not even her late husband, but she was a little bit bisexual. She wasn&#39;t sure how far she&#39;d want to go with another woman, but she had no qualms on servicing herself. She was already finding her lengthening neck more flexible as she bent it forward. Considering how big her breasts were growing, it was a short distance between her nipple and her mouth. Muriel found the sensation rather arousing as she suckled from her own breast. She barely paid attention to how her face pulling out into more of a muzzle as she drank the tangy reptilian milk.<br />
<br />
But her lower half was also going through plenty of changes. Her feet flattened before they spread out, a thick webbing appearing between the toes before extending further out and forming into flippers. Her legs became very muscular, but still curvy. Her panties strained as her hips widened, which pressed them against her slip even more. But her growing tail was what finally caused her underwear to snap. Muriel hissed as she felt her pussy get exposed to open air. Now was for the very graphic display of her changing body. Her longer neck extended further down, past her breasts, down her stomach, before resting her head at the waist. Muriel extended a longer tongue past two rows of sharp teeth. It took a few tries before she was able to touch her slit with her tongue. She gave a bit of moan before her neck extended a bit more, allowing her better access.<br />
<br />
The nearly complete <i>Elasmosaurus</i> moaned as she ate out her own pussy. She squeezed her breasts and teased the nipples as she pushed them against the neck that was currently between. Never had Muriel felt this good. She needed to stop calling herself that. If Effie can change her name to Tyra, so could she. Of course, the only choice was for the creature she was modeling herself off of. She was going to sign her Animalia forms as &#39;Nessa Lockhead&#39;. She had been fascinated with tales of Scotland&#39;s infamous lake monsters ever since she was a wee lass, now she was becoming a sexy version of it. Her tongue drove in deeper, lapping up her own juices. Pretty soon, she felt herself starting to reach her limit. But she didn&#39;t pull away, she kept licking until her pussy gushed out a small torrent of juice as she orgasmed.<br />
<br />
After licking herself clean, Nessa craned her head back to look at her new body. She was definitely well-stocked in both muscles and curves. Certainly more muscle than some people might expect. But Nessa liked it, it made her feel strong. She also liked the green color her body had taken on, even thought the exact shade different on the back and the front. She could only surmise the black stripes on her back were from the anaconda DNA. But that mattered little. How many could say what a plesiosaur&#39;s skin color is supposed to look like? Nessa grinned to herself before trying to stand up. It was awkward to do with her new height, not counting the neck. But soon she was standing on her new flippers, ready for the next part of her adventure.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Nessa swam easily through the pool, her webbed hands, feet, and tail propelling her with great efficiency. She could also hold her breath a lot longer than she would have expected herself to. But she didn&#39;t need to keep her hand underwater as she swam. She simply raised her head up out of the water in a swan-like curve. She looked for all the world like the infamous &#39;surgeon&#39;s photograph&#39; of the Loch Ness Monster. Though if she came all the way out of the water, she would definitely show a sexier figure than the real Nessie. But Nessa wasn&#39;t just here to pretend being the monster of a Scottish lake. She was eager for Tyra to show up so Nessa could hear more about her old friend&#39;s new stud.</p>
