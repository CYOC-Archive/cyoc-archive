<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Clark was usually a good student, but today he was distracted. His thoughts were only focused on one thing, the effects of the jacket he was wearing. He already saw how well the jacket worked for Phil. His friend went from flabby to muscly, chunk to hunk! Clark could only imagine how this magical jock jacket would change him. Perhaps he could finally stand next to his father without looking like he was adopted.<br />
<br />
Clark&#39;s father was pretty much the poster child for the perfect military man. His father was tall, muscular, intimidating, and handsome to boot. Meanwhile, Clark was none of those things. It doesn&#39;t help that his father and the people around him were actually nice about his insecurities and told him to follow his own path. Though honestly, that just made him feel worse about his situation. He wanted to be a man like his father, and everyone was basically saying that wasn&#39;t possible. Well, thanks to this jacket, his dreams will finally come true, and he wasn&#39;t going to miss any of it!<br />
<br />
Oh, wait, no. The teacher just gave him a dirty look. Better start paying attention again. Throughout class, Clark switched back and forth between paying attention to the lesson and checking his own body for changes. He swore he could feel them. His muscles a little harder here, his body feeling a bit bigger there. It seemed to be working, but Clark couldn&#39;t tell for sure. He would have to wait until class was over. It was a long wait for the impatient student, but eventually, he was free from class and rushed to the bathroom as fast as he could without getting into trouble. Though along the way, he noticed that there was a spring to his step. Could this be a clue as to what kind of jock he was transforming into? Probably, but there was no time to think about that; it would just be quicker to get to a mirror.<br />
<br />
Clark arrived at the bathrooms and was relieved to find that no one was there. Good, he would have some privacy here. The student approached the mirror, and his initial observation was: He looked taller! Sure, Clark would have to be sure to make sure, but it was proof that the jacket was working. Alright, it was time for the moment of truth. Clark took off the jacket and his shirt and gazed at the mirror. He liked what he saw, he really liked what he saw.<br />
<br />
He was ripped!<br />
<br />
His pecs were no longer flat but were now actually sticking out. His abs, he actually had abs now! And they had some crazy definition. His shoulders were broader and rounded out. His arms, even if they weren&#39;t nearly as big as his father&#39;s or even Phil&#39;s, Clark still felt a lot of power in them.<br />
<br />
Clark was just ecstatic at these changes; it had really energized him. So, energized that, almost on instinct, Clark started bouncing on the balls of his feet and started punching the air. He wasn&#39;t quite sure why he was doing this, but it felt good. His punches were quick yet had a lot of force behind them. It made him feel so strong like he could take on the world. <br />
<br />
After a while, Clark stopped after he broke a sweat. Woo, that was invigorating, and it seemed like it was now clear what kind of jock Clark was turning into. A boxer, huh? Not the first type he thought of, but damn, did it feel good to become one. Yeah, this also certainly would be helpful for his military career. <br />
<br />
Clark flexed his new muscles for a bit until he had to go to class. He was about to put his clothes back on before he remembered that he needed to take a progress photo. Posing like the jocks he saw on social media, Clark snapped a photo, put his clothes back on, and sent the photo to Phil and Jax and went to his next class.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------<br />
<br />
It was lunchtime, and Clark arrived at the cafeteria, looking for his friends. Phil wasn&#39;t hard to find as not only was he in the usual spot they ate, but his new size made him hard to miss. Though it didn&#39;t seem like Jax was anywhere to be seen. Anyway, Clark made his way to the table and sat down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, hey there, Clark. I&#39;ve seen your progress pics. You are looking great. I&#39;m sure your Dad will be proud.&quot; Phil greeted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, thanks, friend. I feel great too.&quot; Clark flexed an arm and gave Phil a cocky smirk. It was clear that his confidence was through the roof now, &quot;By the way, where&#39;s Jax?&quot;<br />
<br />
The next thing that happened shouldn&#39;t have surprised Clark, but somehow it did. Phil had reached down and pulled up Jax, who was apparently sleeping on the bench. Once again, Clark shouldn&#39;t be surprised that this happened, as Jax was still tired from spending all night researching and the fact that this was far from the weirdest thing Jax had ever done. It was just that Clark wasn&#39;t expecting him to be so close.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, is it class time already?&quot; Jax was still a bit groggy but perked back up to his lackadaisical persona quickly. &quot;Oh. Hey, Clark. You&#39;re looking buff. I can&#39;t wait till I get a turn with that jacket. Speaking of which, I&#39;ll probably have to figure out where the first reports of these jackets appeared so I can help narrow down where these jackets are made. But that&#39;s after my nap.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jax then proceeded to disappear from sight and went back to sleep on the bench. Oh, Jax. Honestly, Clark was feeling a bit, well, not useless, but he felt like he really wasn&#39;t pulling his weight in the jacket investigation. He should really get to researching once he gave the jacket to Jax.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway,&quot; Phil chimed in, &quot;Guess what? You&#39;re looking at the new member of the weightlifting team. Coach Greyson said he was really happy to recruit someone as handsome and funny as I was.&quot; Jax rolled his eyes at this but couldn&#39;t help but crack a smile. Honestly, it was kind of comforting to see that even if Phil&#39;s body had changed, he was the same lovable class clown.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, nice. I have to figure out if there&#39;s a boxing club at school. If not, I can always see if there&#39;s a boxing club around here. You think Jackson would be a good sparing partner?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I thought I was the funny guy,&quot; Phil said with a smile, &quot;But if you&#39;re being serious, you might want to take a rain check. Even if you&#39;re bigger than you once were, you&#39;re still only a lightweight boxer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m only just a lightweight boxer now. But that might not be true by tomorrow. I still have the jacket for that long after all.&quot; And Clark couldn&#39;t wait to see how much he&#39;ll grow.</p>
