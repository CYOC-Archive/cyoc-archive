<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Upon the computer monitor in front of him, John saw the details that described his wife Heather slide into the background and up underneath the information of the other Bruno copies listed there.  His first reaction was that he didn't want his wife turned into a male dog, and he reached out to try and stop the situation before the loading bar could complete.  He didn't really believe all this, but he certainly didn't want to chance it.</p>

<p>John reached out reflexively and started smacking the Escape Key over and over again.  It wouldn't stop, but it seemed to hesitate.  He started tapping it over and over again like trying use F8 to get into Safe Mode and the computer started making the default error sound, 'bing'ing each time he hit Escape.  A second later, the program seemed to crashed and John's eyes went wide.</p>

<p>"What are you doing, honey?" Heather asked from the doorway as she looked over the fragments of where the doorframe had been smashed in.  She looked down at the two dogs who were tied together with their knot, and at the one licking itself clean.  "And what's with all the Brunos?" she wondered, seriously confused over the situation.</p>

<p>"I'm not quite sure, but I'm trying to prevent it from happening again," he said as he reopened the Chronivac application from the CD-ROM Drive.  The screen revealed 'Recovering from Unexpected Quit' and John breathed a sign of relief as Heather walked over and stood behind him.  However, a moment later, as it said 'Restoring Defaults', John noticed a sudden shrinking feeling and looked at his hands to see they had already turned into white, fur-covered paws with thick black pads.  "No!" he yelled, dropping to the floor as even his voice began to change.</p>

<p>Heather screamed out as John's body shifted it's back legs to a more canine view, his cloths seeming to unrealistically slide off of his body and onto the floor as he was slowly covered in the white and black fur of a husky.  A tail sprung out from just above his butt and his eyes turned a beautiful ice blue as his face extended out into a muzzle.  His ears slid up on top of his head, his teeth filled out into canine sharpness, and his waist thinned up leading to his back legs as his body fell onto its side onto the floor.</p>

<p>As John the Bruno began to pick himself up onto his four legs, almost naturally, it spied that the other dogs in the room were once again exact copies of himself.  He felt a little dumber, but still human, and whined to himself as the dog that was penetrated began barking in English "Get him out of me!" over and over again.  The one licking himself off began mumbling to himself, and John began to realize that all of them had the same Bruno-human voice.</p>

<p>"I don't believe this!" Heather said, shocked, but no longer screaming.  She was gathering her sense and looked at the screen in front of her as the Chronivac menus came back into view.  A quick glance of the screen was enough for her (as it was for John) to figure out what had happened.  As she was reading, the Brunos huddled around the computer chair, looking up at her.  She had thought it was to see what was on the screen until one of them stuck their nose into her crotch.  "Hey!" she said and smacked him, then realized it could have been John.</p>

<p>"What are you doing to my wife!" one of the Brunos growled, revealing to Heather that it must have been one of the other three men listed on the screen.  That one put his paws up on Healther's legs and she petted his head.  He gave a canine grin and said, "C'mon, hon.  Let's go back to our room," he said, and wagged his tail.  "I know what you want."</p>

<p>Though Heather wasn't completely turned off by the idea, she thought it was rather inappropriate.  Looking back to the screen revealed that 'Sexual Drive' was set to 'Overpowering' and she cautiously knocked it down a few notches to 'Above Average' and hit 'Save Changes'… and if a realization had just come over John, he blinked and frowned up at Heather whining an apology.  She just petted him on the head and looked back to the screen.</p>

<p>"I don't know who is who of them," John said, turning his ice blue eyes to the other huskies.  The two tied together all started talking to claim who they were, but they all had the same voice.  Heather frowned and looked back to the screen, trying to see if there was something helpful there.  Sure enough, an option for 'Voice' to be 'From Original File' was there, and she selected it and Saved the Changes.  "Oh wow," John said in his own voice, shaking his head, "I'm so sorry I missed these things.  Could you hit 'Save as Defeault'" he tilted his head, looking up at her.</p>

<p>"Better than being all the same dog with an overactive sex drive and the same voice?" she smirked a bit as she saved the default again, looking down at him.  "Now, quickly, tell me what happened."</p>

<p>John briefly detailed what had just happened to him, but the voice of Erick (the one who had put his nose into Heather's lap) interrupted at the end: "I didn't mean for any of this to happen!  I didn't want to be a gay dog or anything… I just thought it would be cool to use the Chronivac to, you know, make our lives better!" he claimed, though it was mostly a lie.  He recalled all the things he had intended to do to the group, but had no intention of admitting to them.</p>

<p>"Someone get this mutt out of me!" screamed the husky being mounted in Jeff's voice.  "It's like… he's lodged!  It kind of hurts, and I can feel something wet inside of me!" he started to whimper as the real Bruno put one leg over him and stepped to the side so they were butt to butt.</p>

<p>"OK, now lets not be hasty," Heather laughed a bit, thinking that she never really liked Jeff and she'd take all the time she needed.  "Let me see what all this does," she said, moving a slider here and there.  Looking to John, she started thinking about his offer and a little twisted grin came over her face.  John, seeing it, lowered his head to the floor and just lay down, watching her, a low whine coming from his throat.</p>

<p>Heather lowered the Fat to 7% and increased the weight to 99lbs.  She went to the gender options and saw all kinds of variables just relating to gender and sex.  She increased the size and capacity of the 'Default's balls so that they were double the size and six times the capacity…  She increased the shaft length so that it came another three inches up the belly, and moved the girth up to another inch.  Content with the changes, she hit 'Save Changes' and 'Save as Default' in turn.</p>

<p>John made a bit of a moaning sound as he and the other three Bruno's bulked up, the muscles rippling lightly underneath the fur of their their now lean and thick canine forms.  Jeff, on the other hand, screamed out as his penetration by the real Bruno became deeper and firmer.  "Oh, God!  What did you do!" he whined while the real Bruno made a low cooing sound of enjoyment behind him.  "Get this fucking dog out of me!"</p>

<p>"Fucking dog!" Bruno said in a dull voice and laughed, standing butt to butt with Jeff.  He laughed a bit, and Jeff growled back at him.</p>

<p>"Jeff, shut up… Heather has control over our bodies, and more!  Don't make this worse!" Erick said as he slowly padded over to Heather, his head down, and a low whine slowly came out from him.  The muscled dog begged forgiveness with his eyes while saying, "Heather, please… I know we've had troubles, but I didn't mean it a second ago.  I couldn't control myself.  Please don't turn me into a shit-demon or something," he begged.</p>

<p>"I wasn't intending to," she frowned at him.</p>

<p>"Don't whine to that bitch!  She's only made this worse than it was before…" Jeff growled at Bruno's knot finally began to loose the blood flow, allowing it to slide out of Jeff's anus since it wasn't actually designed to go there anyway.  Jeff coughed, lowing his head, "Thank fucking God," he cursed.</p>

<p>Erick was saying 'Watch what you say' while John was adding 'Don't talk to my wife that way' as Heather began to look over the screen in front of her with a bit of a smirk.  She highlighted just Jeff's entry and went through the Gender Options from 'null', 'male', and 'hermaphrodite' until ending on female.  She smirked and hit 'Save Changes' as Jeff was still talking.</p>

<p>"There's no way I'm going to watch my mouth.  I'm a fucking dog!  A big fucking dog with giant balls and shit… I will fuck that bitch up so hard, she'll&#151;" and Jeff coughed without finishing.  Heather slid the chair around, looking at Jeff with her arms cross under her breasts.  He could feel his giant balls shrinking as the sucked back into his body with a violent hiccup, his sheath shrinking and folding back on either side as it slowly turned into his new canine vagina.</p>

<p>Reflexively, Jeff tried to move the muscles to flex the base of her penis and found inside that she had moved the new muscles inside of her new vagina instead.  She looked up at Heather with a growl as the woman flipped her brown hair over her shoulder with a smile.  "Who's the bitch now?" she smirked.</p>

<p>"Oh, snap!" Erick coughed, his jaw dropping.</p>

<p>"Now, let's see about fixing the rest of you," she said, turning back to the screen as the big muscular female husky stalked up behind Heather's chair.  John padded over between Heather and Jeff and growled at the new bitch, taking a protective stance on behalf of Heather.</p>

<p>"Don't make it worse for yourself," Erick yuffed lowly at Jeff.</p>

<p>"Advisable," Heather grinned as she quit the Chronivac problem and ejected the CD, sliding it back into its case.  "C'mon John," she said as she stood up and gathered up the rest of the Chronivac package.  "Maybe you can help me understand this before I risk turning myself into a dog," she said, and headed for the door.  Jeff nodded and followed after her.</p>

<p>"Don't just walk away from me!" Jeff growled in her still male and human voice.  She followed them to the door on all four legs as John followed Heather out of the room.</p>

<p><i>"You!</i> will stay here in your room while we figure this out… or I'll… make you into a fly and swat you into a smear on the wall," Heather said, pointing her finger back into the room at the floor between Erick and Bruno as she yelled, <i>"Sit!"</i> she sneered, thinking s
he had some balls (so to speak) to still be making demands of her.</p>

<p>Jeff growled at her but went back into the room and sat down on the floor.  She was very unhappy with how her day had gone so far… quite a rude awakening.  And it infuriated her further when Bruno merely laid down and Erick said, "Yes Mam," as politely as he could in his human voice.</p>

<p>"Good boys," Heather smiled to the two males in the room.  "If you're both good, I might leave you better than I found you," she smiled and shut the door (though it didn't lock anymore).  "Now," she said, looking down at John.  "Let's see if you can help me with this," she grinned.</p></p>
