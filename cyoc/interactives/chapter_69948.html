<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff lay on his bed and stared up at the ceiling, his thoughts in a turmoil of mixed emotions of what happened over the course of the last two hours. After a moment, he looked at the purple plush dragon sitting on his chest, rolled on his side as he felt the tears begin to prick his eyes and hugging the plush closer, he whispered, &quot;Angela.&quot;<br />
*****<br />
<br />
It had started with a strange sensation in his abdomen and groin. As Angela took Crisps the bunny from her bed and started to prattle on about all the things they could do, Jeff thought at first that the strange feeling meant that he had to go to the toilet, but immediately dismissed this as he thought to himself, &quot;But I have already gone potty,&quot; stood and headed for his dresser, where he took out a pair of white tights with faded pink hearts printed on the fabric.<br />
<br />
Apparently forgetting the necklace at the moment, Angela announced what they could do and setting her plush bunny down, she headed for their shared toy-box and began taking out a couple other plush animals and dolls. Nodding, Jeff told her, &quot;Uh-huh,&quot; as he sat down on his bed and started to pull on the tights, unaware that as the sensation in his groin and abdomen grew his change was speeding up as the sack that once held his testicles split in two and one half began to form the vulva while the other half migrated into his body and began to stretch and form everything from the vagina up to the oviducts.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can make our dollies look pretty and than we can play pretend and maybe have another tea-party and maybe mommy will let us play outside or we could play dress-up,&quot; Angela stated, still pulling things from the toy-box and glancing at her, Jeff thought how wonderful each one of these things sounded and telling his sister so, he finished pulling on the tights, not really caring that his odd, split wiener had migrated to between his legs.<br />
<br />
And than Angela saw the necklace and commenting, &quot;She really doesn't look good with that on her,&quot; and reaching for the medallion, she started to lift it off, but stopped when she gave a short squeak and immediately popped her fingers into her mouth.<br />
<br />
Watching as his sister sucked her fingers, Jeff stood and asked, &quot;What's wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
As she pointed at the plush dragon and the necklace, Angela removed her fingers from her mouth long enough to exclaim, &quot;It but me!&quot; and than started to put her fingers back into her mouth, but stopped and instead stated, &quot;Jenny? Something's wrong. I can't see.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thinking Angela was having him on, Jeff wasn't sure how to take this and was about to comment that it was very funny when he noticed his sister's eyes and the hand that wasn't stuck in her mouth. Walking over it her, he squatted down and stared at her for a moment before he realised that her eyes were now pink and appeared to be stitched on.<br />
<br />
As Angela commented, &quot;Everything tastes funny,&quot; Jeff watched as the hand that wasn't in her mouth turn more and more light purple and the fingers shrink up into what appeared to be three, pink claws.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is happening,&quot; Angela whined as he neck began to stretch up and the area beginning just below her jawline started to take on a sparkly texture and started to move down the front of her neck and disappear somewhere beneath her shirt.<br />
<br />
Scared, Jeff glanced at the plush dragon, understanding slowly coming to him that his sister was turning into the thing and looking back at his sister, he watched as she tried to say something as he head elongated and her ears turned into two nubs that stuck straight out from the back of her head. Reaching for her, the odd feeling in his abdomen and groin, Jeff asked, &quot;What can I do?&quot; wanting to desperately help his sister, but unsure what he could and was supposed to do.<br />
<br />
Before him Angela began to shrink, but stopped when she was about fourteen inches. Trying to stand, she began to open her mouth, which Jeff noted was now bright pink inside and appeared to be made of fabric, to say something, but unable to do so, she struggled forward, mouthing the words, &quot;Help me,&quot; to her sister, who didn't understand what it was she was saying.<br />
<br />
And than, as her shirt slipped down and she tripped over her clothes, Angela found her legs and arms locking in place and mouthing one final time, &quot;Help me,&quot; she felt herself slip away. And as her transformation finished, she had one final thought, &quot;It really didn't hurt,&quot; and than she felt herself drift away as everything inside of her made the final transition to what could only be a type of polyester batting, what Jenny's plush dragon was stuffed with.<br />
<br />
Tears slipping down his face, Jeff grabbed the plush dragon that had moments ago been Angela and whispered, &quot;No!&quot; and &quot;Come back,&quot; several times before glancing at the other dragon and the amulet.<br />
<br />
Thinking, &quot;It did this to her and it most likely did this to me,&quot; Jeff hugged the plush dragon that had been his sister close with one arm and brushing the tears away, he suddenly back-pedaled away from the other plush dragon and amulet, fearing that he would transform just by being near it.<br />
<br />
As the fear slowly overtook him, Jeff leaped to his feet and glancing about the room, he dashed out of the bedroom, still holding Angela the plush dragon. Racing downstairs, he squealed out, &quot;Mommy!&quot; not caring that he sounded like a little girl, only wanting to find the one person his mind told him could make sense of all that had happened and squealing out, &quot;Mommy!&quot; a second time, he tore into the dining room.<br />
<br />
When he saw his mother sitting at the table eating an apple, Jeff launched himself at her and placing his face in her lap, he felt the tears begin to fall again as his mommy gently ran a hand over his head and asked, &quot;What's wrong, sweetheart?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hiccupping, Jeff held up the plush dragon and exclaimed, &quot;It's Angela!&quot; as he looked up at his mother.<br />
<br />
Smiling, his mommy took the dragon and asked, &quot;So you have finally figured out her name?&quot; in a tone of a mother dealing with a very upset child.<br />
<br />
As Jeff shook his head, he pointed at the plush animal and cried out, &quot;No! It's Angela. My big sister. She's been changed into,&quot; and hiccupping again, he lapsed into tears.<br />
<br />
Still smiling, Jeff's mother replied, &quot;I don't understand this game, sweetheart. You never had a sister,&quot; to which Jeff began to cry even harder and tried to push away from her, thoughts that, for some reason, she didn't understand coming to mind.<br />
<br />
Pulling Jeff back to her, she began to comfort him and after a moment, she said, &quot;Why don't you explain what happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
A simple nod from Jeff and crawling up into his mommy's lap he realised that not only had the odd feeling in his groin and abdomen had gone, but so had his strange, split wiener. And than he thought, &quot;Girl's don't have a wiener,&quot; and gazing at the plush dragon, he slowly began to tell mommy what had happened to Angela.<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Afterward, still being held by her mommy, Jeff allowed himself to carried upstairs, grabbing the plush dragon off the table before the two of them had left the dining room. When they had reached Jeff's room, her mommy had whispered, &quot;I know how much you'd like a sister, but mommy cannot get you one at this moment,&quot; and setting Jeff down, she indicated toward the bedroom and said, &quot;See. Just you. No Angela,&quot; as Jeff noted that the room had been redecorated for one girl instead of two.<br />
<br />
Rubbing a fist in her eye, Jeff whined, &quot;But I had a big sister,&quot; to which her mommy smiled in a patient way and said, &quot;Somebody is need of her nap,&quot; and guiding Jeff over to the bed, she assisted Jeff into the bed and than lay the plush dragon down next to the girl.<br />
<br />
As she did so, she commented, &quot;Go to sleep and when you wake up, everything will be okay. Okay for you, me and for Angela,&quot; kissing Jeff and than the dragon as she said this.<br />
<br />
Nodding, Jeff glanced at plush animal that used to be her sister and than shut her eyes. When she heard the door close, Jeff opened them and gazed up at the ceiling, in a turmoil of mixed emotions rolling through her. After a moment, she snuggled up to the plush dragon, realising that without the amulet she was now going to be a girl and that there was no way for either her or her sister to turn back to whoever they had been before.</p>
