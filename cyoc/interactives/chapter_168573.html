<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chet Landon was heading on his way out to the gym when he stumbled upon the nightclub.<br />
<br />
By all appearances, Chet was the typically masculine &quot;bro&quot; - 18 years old, six foot four inches tall, 240 lbs of muscular man, a shaved head down to a buzzcut, and slate grey eyes. He was wearing a white tank top, workout shorts, and boxers under the shorts. He was tinkering with his phone, talking with his girlfriend about what he was going to want to do that night. Chet seemed like he was the pinnacle of high school &quot;jock&quot; masculinity.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know babe, I love it when you do that thing when you take it into your mouth like you do. Just drives me wild. I&#39;ll do that for you some more if you help me out like that more.&quot; He said as he took the highly sexualized phone call, and then kept moving. Chet had before then considered himself by and large entirely heterosexual. He&#39;d lost his virginity about four years prior, to someone in his year of high school. Ever since then and having made use of a variety of...workout assistants...he&#39;d become something of a known playboy around campus. In fact the girlfriend he had now was hardly even in the first ten of his paramours.<br />
<br />
Which made things even stranger for young Chet when his breath was just taken away and he felt his dick grow tight and erect in his pants, all at the sight of a man standing at the door to some kind of club. His mouth hung open, and Chet wanted to do so many things with this man. Despite considering himself straight beforehand and in fact being something of a heavyhanded bully, he could understand immediately  understand the gay people around the campus. &quot;F-Fuuuuck...he&#39;s hot. No, no Chet! No! You&#39;re...you&#39;re straight!&quot;<br />
<br />
Do straight guys fantasize about taking a dick up their ass though? And feel their derriere pulse as he imagined the scenario...?<br />
<br />
“Enter, changing to someone completely new and experience the best night of your life. Or leave.”<br />
<br />
He was not even aware initially that the sexiest guy he&#39;d ever seen had even spoken before just registering it all at once. Chet quivered a bit on his feet. He was feeling suddenly quite sweaty, and like if this place had more people - women surely - who were as sexy and irresistible as this guy, then he wanted in. The best night of his life definitely sounded agreeable. And what the girlfriend did not know could not hurt her.<br />
<br />
A grin showed on Chet&#39;s face as he anticipated what kind of a night he could have tonight. He nodded quickly, losing track of how many times he nodded.<br />
<br />
The man swung open the door, and Chet was all at once taken by how many bright lights there were in the club, and the masses of dancing and amazingly attractive people inside of the club. Men and women both all seemed amazingly alluring. Men were all rippling with musculature and were tall and hot. The women were toned, hard bodied party girls of the sort Chet quite enjoyed, the sort whose workout routines he frequently found himself enjoying for all the wrong (right?) reasons.<br />
<br />
Was he even gonna be let in on this when he was just wearing workout clothes?<br />
<br />
Chet didn&#39;t hear any objection or any sneering at him as he walked into the nightclub, eager to make his entry and not thinking or caring about what might be going on in here. He just felt the heat of the room on his body, and how amazing it all was, heard the music beating loud enough to resonate deep inside of him, and saw the amazingly attractive patrons. Chet just had to get in there and have some fun. His manhood was tight in his shorts, almost as hard as concrete.<br />
<br />
Before long Chet was dancing with the other people in there, and multiple times he was pulled into the embrace of women in the club, feeling them grab and grope at his body, touching his muscles. His body, which seemed to be sweating to a tremendous degree, was their focus. Everyone in here could see that Chet had an amazingly buff physique. And they loved it! He gasped as he felt one of the women grind her groin on his cock, and returned the favor in kind.<br />
<br />
One of them was running her hand through his hair, which seemed curiously longer than usual, eh, he decided, he was just gonna need to get a new haircut anyway. Nothing unusual there. Even if he did feel like there was something unusual, Chet did not really care to raise any alarm. Especially if this meant that his enjoyment would be cut short.<br />
<br />
Chet next danced with a woman and felt her hands rub on his chest and abs, and he could feel spikes of pleasure coming from her tender touch, &quot;Ohh yeah babe, worship my muscles.&quot; She took that as an indication this was wanted, and kept going. Chet had never exactly been one for nipple play, but hot damn were his nipples feeling good today. It was like they were lightning rods to his cock.<br />
<br />
The dancing was getting more intense and Chet swore with the amount he was dancing, sweating, and grinding away, he was amazed he wasn&#39;t cumming too soon. His voice sounded oddly softer and somewhat more girly when he spoke up, &quot;Fuuuck, I love this place already!&quot; He didn&#39;t mind it though, he just guessed he was feeling hoarse. He probably could use some water... well, once he was done dancing.<br />
<br />
Chet kept going and it seemed...maybe it was just his perception, but his butt seemed tighter, bigger, and more prominent, and the rest of him seemed to be becoming thinner somehow in the light. Maybe just a trick of the light. He brushed his long hair out of his eyes. His dick was so fucking hard, he needed to get this taken care of before he went home. He could definitely pass this off as a workout.<br />
<br />
Chet felt some woman guide him to the back, and much to his surprise right then and there she helped get his shorts down and fished out his dick. Maybe it was his bleary sweat stained eyes, but his dick seemed smaller, but no less hard for it. His balls just looked tiny and pulled taut to his body. Chet was gonna say something when the woman grabbed and felt at his &quot;awesome pecs&quot;. Chet moaned outloud and felt his dick jerk a bit, it was all he could do to stop himself from cumming too soon.<br />
<br />
She went down on him as she kissed her way down his toned, tight little torso. Wasn&#39;t he big and buff? Ehh he felt so good, he could deal with this later. Workout more and get bigger again or something like that. Chet gasped as he felt her take his dick into her mouth. Whatever he lost in size he more than made up for in sensitivity. He almost thrashed around as she took it in her mouth all the way, licking at his incredibly sensitive cock head. He could feel his body tickling, tingling, a sensation like a full body orgasm starting to build up.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, Chet had never felt like this, and he could almost feel addicted to it. He wanted more of this, like it was something new he could not get enough of...<br />
<br />
Then he came - and it felt like he came buckets, even though barely anything was discharged from his cock. Finally, Chet was directed by her hand, touching his pectoral as she led him toward the side even with his pants half way down. There was a mirror there, and Chet could see the hot woman he had been getting oral from, and this other hot woman - amazingly attractive, tanned, tight gym honed body and with light blond hair, long and pretty.<br />
<br />
Chet realized in short order as he touched his chest...that was HIM! Chet was feeling a barrage of conflicting emotions. Surprise, confusion, betrayal...but largest of them all was arousal. Chet could see he was the hottest girl he&#39;d ever seen, and she was easily even hotter than the girlfriend or this other woman by her side. Chet gave up to the transformation in short order, she was just feeling too incredible. She was going to be the hot new girl, the queen of the cheerleaders as soon as she stepped into school.<br />
<br />
Chet couldn&#39;t help herself - she went into the heat of the club yet again, feeling the amazing sensation of men&#39;s bodies against her own. The feeling of tight and toned musculature as their hands and manhoods rubbed against her through clothes. Chet almost missed her old masculinity, but in the moment, she didn&#39;t terribly mind her venture into the feminine. Chet gasped as she felt someone rub up against her from behind.<br />
<br />
Oh, it was Dale, from school. That senior nerd he had always picked on. But now Dale was looking so much MORE. Taller, more muscular, stronger and more proud. His pale skin had been changed out for a bronzed tan that indicated Greek ancestry, flattering the musculature that now bulged out in his nerdy t-shirt and pants. Chet threw herself into an embrace and a kiss with the newly masculine Dale. She could not get enough of him.<br />
<br />
Ohh, if only tonight could last forever...<br />
<br />
---------------<br />
<br />
But the stipulation of the club was that it only transformed those who went there for one mere night, until they left. As the people started to leave the club and file out through a variety of doors that seemed to exist only for them, Chet followed suite...only to find herself become himself again as he walked out, the transformation knocking him over in its speed and sudden nature. Chet was no longer Chet the beautiful girl, but Chet the handsome, muscular 240 lbs jock.<br />
<br />
He did not see where Dale went off to, but as Chet gathered himself from the floor and desperately looked back at the nightclub entrance, he found himself looking at nothing. Chet looked around, it was around the time when he was supposed to get done with his workout and head home. Yet he remembered many, many hours inside that nightclub...<br />
<br />
Chet pulled himself up, standing and regarding himself. In all the years he&#39;d experienced life as the strongest, best looking man at the school, he&#39;d never felt so...inadequate. He&#39;d felt so incredibly good when he was a woman. And he started to wonder...do I want to do that again somehow?<br />
<br />
Chet started walking home, contemplating the matter...</p>
