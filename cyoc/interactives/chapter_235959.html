<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Boss stood stunned into silence. How was this possible? How had a teenage boy not only destroyed the Hourglass, but revived the kitsune as well? Gazing around the center of the kitsune capital, the Boss could see the entire population standing before him, obviously confused as to what happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;How?!&quot;<br />
<br />
That was all the Boss could utter as he stared at Darren. Darren looked exhausted, a fierce look on his face. The teen looked as if he had finished a marathon, his breathing ragged as the childish Tatsu and Shizen stood by his side. Grunting in rage, Darren now cast another spell. Opening a portal, Darren now cast a spell, launching the Boss through the portal before following with Tatsu and Shizen. As the Boss crashed to the ground in a heap, Darren tried to regain his strength; watching as the Boss now lept to his feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do?!&quot; the Boss bellowed. &quot;How the FUCK did you destroy the Hourglass?&quot; Darren had no answer. Every fiber of his being throbbed with pain. He felt as if his muscles were shredded, the teen sinking to his knees. &quot;You idiot,&quot; the Boss screamed. &quot;This was your plan? Revive the kitsune and stick us in the middle of the fucking woods? And you didn&#39;t even reverse the effect of the Hourglass on Tatsu and Shizen!&quot;<br />
<br />
Angrily the Boss now stomped forward, Darren seeing the look of pure rage on the man&#39;s face. He could barely move, having used nearly all his power to revive the kitsune. At this point, he wasn&#39;t even sure if he could mount a defense. &quot;Leave him alone!&quot; Tatsu and Shizen called, their voices thin and childish as they stood in front of Darren. The Boss scoffed at the kindergarten aged kitsune. &quot;Brats.&quot; he grunted, kicking the pair away and watching them tumble.<br />
<br />
Withdrawing a pistol, the Boss now aimed it at Darren’s forehead, his brow furrowed. &quot;You may have saved them but at what cost?&quot; he asked. &quot;In the end, it&#39;s a temporary reprieve. I&#39;ll kill you, then them, and then the rest of those pathetic figures you traveled through time to save. Face it Darren....I can&#39;t lose!&quot; Darren could do little more than scowl, awaiting the Boss to fire. Instead, two blurs now jumped from behind him, kicking the Boss away as he unceremoniously tumbled backwards. Coughing up dirt, he cursed as he played eyes upon Raiden and Sachiko. &quot;Fucking perfect,&quot; he grumbled, dusting himself. &quot;Two more grade school gods. I can&#39;t believe I gotta deal with two more munchkins with a god damn bed time!&quot;<br />
<br />
As the Boss angrily began to conjure a spell, Darren focused on Raiden and Sachiko. He had only one hope left, but it would require the rest of his strength. Reaching out, his rings began to glow, the kits confused as a series of lights swirled around them before a blinding flash of light engulfed the area. The Boss instinctively shielded his eyes, confused as to what happened before gawking. Standing before him were an adult Raiden and Sachiko.<br />
<br />
The newly minted nine tails standing in front of Darren in confusion. Raiden, adorned in a black hikama with green trim, his red highlights running through his fur. The kitsune looked more muscular than either is grandfather or father as he cautiously flexed. Sachiko, adorned in a light blue kimono, looked herself over. The kitsunes white fur immaculate, possessing a curvy figure similar to her mother Ayami. &quot;Sachiko,&quot; Raiden asked, his voice strong and powerful. &quot;Did...did we just grow up?&quot; Sachiko nodded, still bewildered by her own transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;You got to be shitting me.&quot; the Boss groaned, his shoulders slumping. As he now tried to cast a spell, Raiden noticed. Moving at speeds that caught everyone by surprise, the newly adult celestial delivered a devastating gut punch, sending the Boss soaring into the air. Crashing unceremoniously to the ground, the Boss cursed before looking into the smirking face of Raiden. &quot;Oh I think I&#39;m going to enjoy this.&quot; the black kitsune said with glee as he sprinted towards his enemy.<br />
<br />
Darren could do little more than watch, a smile growing on his face. Watching the pair of newly minted celestials the teen could see they surpassed the Boss easily. Raiden eclipsed both his grandfather and father in strength at this age, battering the Boss with blows that caused the leader of the Normal to bounce off the earth. The back and red kitsune fired off massive blows, keeping the Boss off balance. Even when the Boss did recover, Sachiko was there. Darren watched as Sachiko tapped into her divine magic. The snow white kitsune blinding the Boss with holy light before striking him with bolts of lightning. The Boss screamed in pain and rage, his emerald robes burned and charred from his body.<br />
<br />
Landing in a heap, Raiden and Sachiko now approached. The Boss was burnt, his robes in tatters leaving his body exposed. Grasping the Boss around the neck with one of his rails, Raiden snarled as he looked to deliver a finishing blow. &quot;Do it,&quot; the Boss smiled through bloody lips. &quot;I dare you. Dont be a little bitch about it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Sachiko said softly, her voice angelic as she gently placed her hand on Raidens arm. &quot;He&#39;s finished Raiden. Look at him, he&#39;s weak and finished. Let him live with his shame.&quot; Raiden grunted in annoyance, tightening his grip on the Boss’s throat as he stared the man in his swollen eyes. &quot;Leave,&quot; Raiden growled. &quot;And never return, for next time...I won&#39;t take it easy on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dropping the Boss, Raiden and Sachiko turned to walk away, ignoring the man completely. &quot;Where are you going?&quot; the Boss exclaimed. &quot;Do you think you can just turn your back on me?! Get back here!! This isn&#39;t over! I can&#39;t be stopped...I won&#39;t be stopped until every!single! One of your filthy kind is dead!! Do you hear me DEAD!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sachiko turned slightly, her eyes narrowed as she listened to the Boss rant. Raising an eyebrow in annoyance, she watched as a lightning bolt struck the Boss, knocking his face into the dirt with his legs comically sticking in the air. Another bolt quickly followed, Darren, Tatsu, and Raiden wincing as it struck the Boss in between his legs. The only sound coming from the Boss was a high pitched whine of pain. &quot;Was that really necessary?&quot; Raiden asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well he was being a jerk.&quot; Sachiko replied, glancing at Raiden.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay true but a lightning bolt to a guy&#39;s bean bag...it&#39;s kinda overkill.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the two nine tails now approached Darren, they could see the teen smiling. &quot;You feeling okay Darren?&quot; Raiden asked, assisting the teen to his feet. &quot;Yeah I&#39;ll be okay.&quot; he grunted. &quot;Think I just need a nap.&quot; Raiden and Sachiko nodded, turning now to Tatsu and Shizen. The pair of grown down gods smiling with pride. &quot;I&#39;m so proud of you two.&quot; Shizen chirped. Raiden smiled, crouching down to so he could be at eye level with his grandparents. &quot;Thank you.&quot; he said softly before sheepishly rubbing the back of his head. &quot;This is...really weird. I&#39;m not used to you two being this small.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a bit weird for us too.&quot; Tatsu replied, shifting his oversized clothing on his small frame. &quot;But we are both so proud of what you two have done. Now, we just need some help growing back up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Sachiko mused, an impish smirk on her face. &quot;I think they look kinda cute like this. Maybe they can stay like this for a little while.&quot; As Tatsu looked to complain, Shizen threw her hand over his mouth. &quot;She&#39;s joking,&quot; she sighed. &quot;And judging by how the Catalyst looks, it might be a little while before he can reverse the spell.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah sorry.&quot; Darren grunted. &quot;Might need a minute or two. Hope you don&#39;t mind Raiden and Sachiko babysitting.&quot; The four kitsune now laughed. Realizing that soon enough things would be as they were.</p>
