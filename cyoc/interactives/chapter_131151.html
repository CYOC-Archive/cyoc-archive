<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I wanted to sleep in on Sunday morning but at 6.30 Biddy was scratching at the door. I guess Sarah had a bit of a hang-over as his head was under the pillow and he was moaning for the dog to shut up. I got up and let the dog in.<br />
<br />
I went to the toilet and changed my pad. There was enough blood to make me glad I had thought to put the pad in last night. I came back to the bedroom and reminded Sarah of his idea to use the medallion to cure a hang-over.  He asked me could I help and as I knew I couldn&#39;t change I agreed. I went to the cupboard got the medallion and the &#39;Rod Showered and Shaved&quot; bag out. The medallion zapped me but I knew any change would quickly revert as I was still menstruating. I touched the medallion and the sock from the bag to Sarah.<br />
<br />
30 minutes later the invigorated Sarah was fucking me. When the changes were complete he said he felt great and had asked how I felt. I mentioned how I was disappointed when he fell asleep last night.  He said that he would like to make it up to me. We fetched a towel to save the sheets and in no time my void was been filled. Biddy was an interested spectator. <br />
<br />
I decided to take a bath when we were finished while Sarah wanted to mow the lawn. He said he would have a shower after that. I asked Sarah &quot;Do you have any suggestion as to what I should wear today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a floral sundress that would be perfect. Go and run your bath. I will have the outfit laying on the bed before I start mowing&quot;<br />
<br />
I had a long hot bath and washed my hair. When eventually I got out I found a blue and white, sleeveless, knee length dress on the bed with some white sandals. I put on the outfit then dried and styled my hair. Sarah finished mowing the lawn and saw me when he came inside. He said I looked nice but should put on just a little bit a lipstick.  He suggested that after he showered we could drive over to collect his car from Karen&#39;s house.<br />
<br />
We did exactly that. I dropped him off and he followed me back home. The thought crossed my mind that I might well have spent more time in this body than in the &#39;Rod&#39; body.<br />
<br />
Once home together we marinated the meat we had bought yesterday and Sarah showed me how to make a salad. While doing that Sarah suggested we don&#39;t tell &#39;Zach&#39; that we had swapped bodies. He was curious to see whether &#39;Zach&#39; could tell. <br />
<br />
I was setting the outdoor table under the shady Jacaranda tree a bit after 11 when Biddy started barking at the front door. &#39;Rod&#39; went to see who it was. He came back shortly after with &#39;Zach&#39; and Amanda. We chatted about what we had got up to in the last few days. I gave them a very abbreviated version of last nights party. They had gone to the cinema last night and seen &#39;Ready Player One&#39; a newly released movie.<br />
<br />
Biddy was barking again. This time I went to the door and let Hilda in. She greeted me with a kiss asking how her favorite daughter in law was. I introduced her to Biddy, then took her out the back to join the others. <br />
<br />
Zach introduced Amanda to Hilda. You could see he was excited to be with his real mother and perhaps slightly exaggerated the role she had paid in his upbringing to Amanda. However I understood his motivation and did not correct him. &#39;Rod&#39; (really Sarah) opened a bottle of champagne and we toasted &#39;Zach&#39; and Amanda&#39;s engagement. <br />
<br />
Rod and Zach swapped the champagne for beers and went to start the BBQ. Leaving us ladies to small talk. Hilda was keen to know whether we (as in Sarah and Rod) had made any investigations about our own wedding. Amanda volunteered that there was a wedding expo in 3 weeks time that she and Zach were planning to look at, she suggested that I and Rod should come with them. <br />
<br />
Hilda came with me when I went to the kitchen to bring out the meat, mushrooms and onions that &#39;Rod&#39; was planning to barbeque. I showed her the salads we had made. As we were collecting the meat she said &quot;Sarah, I am so happy with Rod&#39;s choice of a bride. You are such a lovely girl. I just want to say that I am really looking forward to grandchildren some day and I&#39;m sure you will make a wonderful mother&quot; Whoa I thought, the pressure is starting already.<br />
<br />
However it did get me thinking. As I was enjoying my lunch, &#39;Zach&#39; and &#39;Rod&quot; were talking about basketball. I thought about what it might be like to be a mother. How would it feel to be 8 months pregnant? To watch my belly expand. To feel my baby kicking. How would it feel to breastfeed? It actually didn&#39;t feel all that scary.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want to come Sarah? ............Sarah?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I was daydreaming. What was the question?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We were going to take Biddy for a walk, To walk off lunch&quot; said Amanda. <br />
 <br />
&quot;Sure, good idea. It&#39;s a lovely day&quot; <br />
<br />
We took the dirty plates inside, then all of us went for a leisurely walk around the block. As I walked beside Hilda and Amanda, I scolded myself for thinking about babies. What had I been thinking, I&#39;m Rod, I&#39;m male. If ever I have children I will be the father..... Yet here I was in a sundress and sandals, feeling my breasts bounce and my bottom wobble. I currently had all the plumbing to be a mother. Life had certainly taken a strange turn. <br />
 <br />
After we returned Hilda and Amanda insisted on doing the dishes. &#39;Rod&#39; and &#39;Zach&#39; were out cleaning the barbeque. I made a pot of tea. Hilda and Amanda joined me and it felt like I really had a family again. Everything just felt so comfortable. <br />
<br />
When the boys came back in Hilda said she had greatly enjoyed the afternoon but that it was now time for her to get going. Amanda and &#39;Zach&#39; also decided it was time to go. It was hugs and kisses all round as we said our goodbyes. <br />
<br />
I found I was holding &#39;Rod&#39;s&#39; hand as we walked back in the front door. Once inside I found myself giving him a another hug. I told him &quot;I really enjoyed the afternoon&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I did as well........I don&#39;t think that &#39;Zach&#39; picked that we had swapped&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I think I&#39;m getting pretty good at being Sarah .....and you make a very good Rod&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right now I have a very stiff rod. Would you care to come to the bedroom and see?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You read my mind&quot; I replied</p>
