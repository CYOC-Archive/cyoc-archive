<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;God damn!&quot; Mike roared again as he felt the surge of power running through him. <br />
<br />
&quot;D-dad?&quot; Jeff uttered as he stared at the colossal lion standing in front of him. He barely even noticed the dripping running down Mike&#39;s leg as his vision barely lowered beneath his massive chest. Mike&#39;s ears were nearly touching the ceiling. But he made sure to palm the flat surface while his arms were nearly fully bent before looking back down.<br />
<br />
Mike slowly looked down, realizing the size difference between him and his son. There was nearly two feet that he had to look his son in the eyes. The top of his son&#39;s head barely came to the bottom of his chest. &quot;Now that won&#39;t do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Jeff barely got the syllable out before Mike pushed him out of the way. Jeff wasn&#39;t even an annoyance as he was easily pulled out of the way of his computer. He watched as he dad typed away at the keyboard. &quot;Wait! What are you doing!?&quot; he tried to pull the lion away, but there was nothing he could do about it. Mike weighed nearly five times as much as he did and his massive arms and back made it impossible for him to break through the natural defenses that Mike&#39;s size gave him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dad! No! Seriously! Wait!&quot; Jeff continued to try to get in but couldn&#39;t. Mike was just too big. His shoulders too wide. <br />
<br />
Mike finally stood up. &quot;And done,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;D-done?&quot; Jeff stammered as what looked like several paragraphs of sentences had been strung together. The green progress bar appeared and began to load. &quot;F-uck...&quot; he uttered before falling to the floor as an intense feeling ran through him. It was almost a numb pain that was so deep into his body that it went down to the bones. He clawed at the floor. His nails turned sharp, sharper than any human could make them and tore into the carpet of his room.<br />
<br />
Jeff moaned in pain as his body writhed against the floor. Muscle was adding onto his body at an alarming rate. He could feel his bones growing longer. It was the one thing he always knew that his dad wanted, a son who could play sports. Jeff felt his body growing stronger by the second. His thin frame easily showed off the muscle. Thick biceps grew onto his arms. His chest pushed out in front of him but his waist stayed fairly thin. As he grew taller, it naturally had to grow with him to support all the new weight he was developing.<br />
<br />
His ass flung up into the air. It almost felt like it&#39;s natural position as it gently wiggled back and forth. A strong feeling emerged out of his tail bone as it started to grow longer. New nerves grew right along with it as it wagged back and forth, growing well past a foot and then two.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thata boi!&quot; Mike gripped his meaty ass.<br />
<br />
Jeff let out a sensual moan. Through all the discomfort that seemed to only release a sense of pleasure. His face scraped against the carper with his tongue falling out of his mouth. It was far larger than it needed to be. Slowly his face began to stretch to fit it again as his mouth and nose molded more into a maw. Razor sharp teeth filled his mouth as his eyes turned into a golden hue.<br />
<br />
The changes finally slowed and Jeff felt his body relax. &quot;Fuck... Fuck... Fuck...&quot; he breathed as he was finally given his senses back. He looked down at his body to see that he was given the same golden fur that his fur had. <br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon boi. Take a look at what your daddy gave you,&quot; Mike said, easily lifting Jeff off the ground. He spun Jeff around to get a proper look in the mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah...&quot; Jeff uttered as he saw his body. Even if he wasn&#39;t as big as Mike that didn&#39;t mean he was small. Only when the two were standing next to each other. Instead of coming up to Mike&#39;s chest, Jeff came up to his shoulders. He must have been at least 6&#39;6&quot; and well over 300 pounds of muscular bulk. There was still a line of abs running down his front, but not nearly as defined as anything in a magazine. Jeff raised his arm giving it a flex and watching the powerful bicep bounce along with it. He ran his paws over his thick meaty chest, down his abs, and around his firm and perky butt. Then paused. &#39;Where are my clothes?&#39;<br />
<br />
The realization hit him hard as he looked at his almost completely nude form. Nothing other than a stained dirty jock covered his body. He watched as the realization hit his cock, making blood engorge the member. It was just another thing that had grown far larger than it had been. Even though Jeff had never been ashamed of his size, he couldn&#39;t deny that this had to be at least double what he was working with earlier. The jock stretched and strained over its girth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like someone enjoys their transformation,&quot; Mike said. His big arm over Jeff&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
Jeff felt his dick throb with excitement. &quot;Oh! Daddy yes! I love it!&quot; he leaned into the one armed hug and gently pecked the bigger lion on the cheek. His hands had made it to the front and back of Mike&#39;s body gently rubbing the much bigger and stronger lion. It took him a whole 3 seconds before he realized what he&#39;d just done. &quot;Huh?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww... You know that daddy loves you,&quot; Mike leaned back down to return the kiss. Jeff naturally accepted it. Their tongues rolled around in each other&#39;s mouths. Jeff felt a tingle in his hole. The longer Mike kissed him and the more he felt those strong hands explore his body, the worse that tingle got. <br />
<br />
It got so bad that Jeff couldn&#39;t even focus on the kiss anymore. He was gasping for air as the sexual arousal only increased. &quot;Dad-dy...&quot; he panted. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m pleasing my boi,&quot; Mike growled. His kisses were no longer on the mouth, rather running down the side of Jeff&#39;s neck. He pushed the smaller lion onto the bed.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s body splayed out, but his asshole was on full display. He watched as Mike dropped his shorts and underwear to reveal his cock. &quot;Oh daddy!&quot; he cried out as he saw the size of the member. Fear and arousal mixed together as he wondered if a cock that size could actually fit inside of him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry boi. I&#39;ll take care of you,&quot; Mike said as he hoisted Jeff&#39;s feet over his shoulders and positioned his cock against Jeff&#39;s asshole. It leaked pre, generously lubing up the tight hole. He pressed his tip against it.<br />
<br />
&quot;OH DADDY!&quot; Jeff squealed in delight. The tingle burning his asshole felt fully satisfied. Jeff&#39;s body twisted wildly as his claws dug into the mattress to hold himself still. Pleasure rocketed through him as he felt more of the cock invade his insides. But his asshole gently grasped it. Holding it tightly as Mike pushed more inside. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck...&quot; Mike panted. He hadn&#39;t realized just what he&#39;d typed or how good it was actually feel. It was like he was a teenager again, feeling it for the first time all over, but somehow even better. His cock throbbed inside Jeff&#39;s welcoming body. It was taking all of his control not to finish right away. Each thrust took him right to the edge. He gripped Jeff tightly, doing his best to keep going. But eventually it was too much and his cock released, filling the inside of his boi.<br />
<br />
The sudden jerk of Mike and the wet feeling inside Jeff, was too much for him as well. He felt his cock release into the stained jock. A large load that instantly coated the thin fabric and began leaking out of it. &quot;Oh gawd... Oh gawd...&quot; Jeff panted as he felt himself coming down from the climax. His body laid there limp for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn,&quot; Mike growled. &quot;That was good...&quot;<br />
<br />
The deep rumble of Mike&#39;s voice brought a smile to Jeff&#39;s face. He felt his cock harden again at the sensation of the compliment. However, a loud knock to the front door brought the two back down to reality.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it,&quot; Mike&#39;s growl wasn&#39;t as pleasant this time. &quot;Go get cleaned up. I&#39;ll be downstairs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded as he watched Mike put the football jersey and his shorts back on. He laid down for a second before hearing Mike&#39;s voice again. &quot;And no using the computer without daddy&#39;s permission.&quot;</p>
