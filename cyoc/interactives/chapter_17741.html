<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The childhood dream had been realized, what Mr. Fran tried had come true and he actually became a male Donkey. It was as he fell from his pleasuring another Donkey's wild desire he saw the spell kicking in once more.<br />
<br />
Landing on his chin he was at hoof height to the females standing around him. They seeing their verile male fall all began to get nervous and started to move about the trailer.<br />
<br />
Seeing his arms return and hoofs splitting into didgets to become once more fingers, he strained to get up and stand. The milling about of the Jennies kept knocking him back down as he felt his own weight change to that of an old human man.<br />
<br />
Oh no, no, no, noooo!&quot; groaned Mr. Fran as he sat there on his flat and hairy butt watching what he so loved just melt back to his old self.<br />
<br />
The truck and its trailer were moving down the highway as Mr. Fran started to wonder how far from home they'd come. Thoughts of his car still parked on the side road and what was even more horrible, the Tome of Possibility was laid open across the seat. He worried if his car were stolen, vandalized, or worse the book itself were stolen or damaged, all this worked in his mind.<br />
<br />
All night long the truck, trailer, and a small herd of donkeys rolled down the highway. It was early morning when the truck left the roadway and travelled to a ranch and farm. <br />
<br />
Mr. Fran was by this time mostly human with the exception of ears, hair and skin, a tail, and what he fondled often his sheath and its general contents. Peering threw the slats in the side of the trailer he could only wait until he was discovered.<br />
<br />
The hiss sound of air brakes, and the truck stopped at a corral. As he peered out so did the others inside the truck as several bales of sweet hay stood alluring all to charge to of the trailer of eats.<br />
<br />
A moment of truth as Mr. Fran stood there waiting for the rear door of the trailer to open and withstanding the rush or not, he'd be found.<br />
<br />
Nervous, embarressed for what he looked like and then too naked and recognizable too, he longed for to be a Jackass again if even for the rest of his life! If just there was a way, or then looking the trailer over he wished for any mode of escape.<br />
<br />
The golden red light of sunrise suddenly provided him the view of a roof hatch and of all things a ladder going up to it. He pushed and shoved his way toward the front of the long trailer pleading with his lovers to give way.<br />
<br />
Halfway up the ladder he was having trouble standing on his hind hoofs being the wrungs were rounded. He thought that this thing would be hard to stand or climb on with human feet, but it seemed impossible to climb with hoofs.<br />
<br />
A creeking sound and all inside thr trailer were standing alert and ready to exit. Then the rear door fell open allowing those inside to stampede out into the open corral.<br />
<br />
The ranch owner was soon having an arguement with the truck driver as the count of his new animals was short by one. He was mostly angry since the one missing was the important Jack male for which he'd planned to use to start the herd.<br />
<br />
Laid out on top of the trailer was Mr. Fran. He listened with obvious interest to the arguement going on below. The sounds of the donkeys eating and making their loving sounds had him getting erect, but he wanted to get home even more than to stay and helf make the herd grow.<br />
<br />
It was decided that the truck must have left his male donkey at the slaughter company and was then ordered to return there. <br />
<br />
Soon an angered man driving the big truck was heading up the highway back to the Fulbright Slaughter and Auction center. Once it hit the highway Mr. Fran climbed back down into the trailer as the ride up top was a bit too breezy.<br />
<br />
The bright rays of light pouring threw the slats of the truck's trailer was having profound effects on Mr. Fran. He watched with interest as his human feet and toes came back. The falling out of his hairy coat made him chilly in the breeze flying through the trailer as a truck driver raced back to town.<br />
<br />
It was almost sundown when the truck returned to the slaughter house as Mr. Fran had changed back with one odd exception. Although he had his own human testicles again the sheath and that monster donkey penis remained as they had been when being used. He wondered why he kept it thinking that it might be due to his mating as the vaginal slime and his donkey sperm still crusted and coated the organ.<br />
<br />
Now with human feet and no solid hoofs he climbed the ladder and using the slats on the outside of the trailer, climbed down to solid earth. Still naked he ran and dodged from parked car to parked car looking for anything he could use for clothing. He found in the backseat of one car a ladies pink robe. Try as he did it was all he could find and using it for some covering he headed across country to find his old car and maybe the Tome.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile back at his ole' woody car sat a fella named Jeff. He had been just out walking in the early morning and seeing the nice condition old car setting on a side road he thought to have a look.<br />
<br />
Peering inside the interior was something to behold. The seats made of thick vinyl and scotch patterned cloth along with a dashboard having crome and paint made this car very special. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mint condition and standing here open and by itself on an old private road, why?&quot; thought Jeff.<br />
<br />
Walking around the car he saw nothing of nobody expecting to see a body or something for a reason why this antique was left to the elements.<br />
<br />
Then he saw the old big book laid out open and filling the backseat.<br />
<br />
Opening the rear door he leaned inside and picked up the book taking car not to injure it in any way.<br />
<br />
Looking and then finding the right spot Jeff sat down and began to look at the old book. It took only a first quick looksee to tell this was something of witchcraft and the works of magic. The more he paged through it he saw spells which wheeled great power. If power it had he was one who had a wish like Mr. Fran but in a differing sort of way.<br />
<br />
Having kept his finger making the place the book was left open he returned to the page and read the spell to himself. Seeing the penciled in markings Jeff thought and laughed wishing down deep to try it and hoped it really would work.<br />
<br />
Chuckling out loud he placed the big book down on the grass and thinking for a split second he then started to read aloud.<br />
<br />
&quot;A wish and dream of _________Jeff_____________ to be,<br />
as by the power of this Tome one would see,<br />
by night and day for________a week_______________ granting me time.<br />
One asketh and be blessed to know, feel, as sublime,<br />
the form, body, shape, and life of_____Bunny Rabbit__________.&quot;<br />
<br />
No sooner said than Jeff looked up into the sky wishing to his longing heart he was a cute furry bunny rabbit. It might have been as he looked into the sun but whateven he fell backward laying flat out and went sound asleep.<br />
<br />
&quot;What!&quot; thought Jeff as he awoke from his short slumber.<br />
<br />
Trying to sit up again he could not and rolling to one side tried again to push himself up. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the H..............!&quot; he muttered to himself.<br />
<br />
Looking down his hands were covered if not coated in a light brownish hair. It covered his hands, ran up his arms, he stopped and then looked back at the Tome.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I'm dreaming this all!&quot; he muttered again.<br />
<br />
A push up from his foot sent him rolling ass over apple cart across the grass. He shook his head feeling something battering his skull like a couple of soft balloons.<br />
<br />
Furry hands reached up and touched, felt, and jumped away from two tall long furry ears, his ears!<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no I was joking!&quot; he tried to say but his words came out sounding wrong. Next he stood up but doing so he looked at his feet and gasped.<br />
<br />
His shoes were not far away but there was no way he could put them back on as his feet were very much longer and also furry.<br />
<br />
Fumbling and almost struggling he began to strip off his golf shirt and the sweat pants he was wearing for his daily time of exercise. A tug to his undershorts and he stood undressed but no longer in need of clothing.<br />
<br />
Turning his head this way and that Jeff sized up what happened to him. H lifted his feet up and checked out legs now with powerful strong muscles. His arms too were much stronger as under the thick fur stout muscles bulged. He danced in a cicle looking at his new self, thinking and remembering the movie Harvey. Indeed if there ever was such a creature Jeff looked ever so much like that big Pooka.</p>
