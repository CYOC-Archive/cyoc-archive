<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">something else...<br />
<br />
It already ensnared his sight when he glanced at the camera and saw an honest-to-god anthropomorphic fox sauntering to the counter, where Lisa Wright manned the cash register. She glanced over to the fox, barely reacting despite clearly being about to handle a vulpine customer. It was as if he, Jacob made sure as he watched the squared shoulders and male form of the anthropomorphic fox with clearly masculine mannerisms, was a normal customer as he took out his card and started to order his food.<br />
<br />
The fox didn&#39;t chat with anyone else on his way to her counter; his teal windbreaker and casual jeans fit well on his foxy form with accommodating tail hole for his well-kept tail. The orange-white fox pointed his claws to the food he wanted as Lisa punched them in, but Jacob was now focusing on her.<br />
<br />
As they interacted, Jacob watched as Lisa shifted about with each blink he took. It was as if the world was updating for him, with each blink, her ears had already migrated to the top of her head through holes in the uniform&#39;s cap. It was never there to begin with, and he watched enraptured as her black canine ears flicked in place. They were fluffy, he noted.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell.&quot; Jacob watched on, no longer working on his vegetables as he stared at a transforming Lisa. If he was a stalker, it would have been an alarm bell, but he&#39;s not, and he&#39;s taken. Once more, he blinked and saw her face was now a wolf&#39;s muzzle with sharp teeth as she smiled at the fox.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take Jacob long to realize that each blink he took changed her, so he tried to alternate blinking one eye. However, despite having his sight on the grainy camera, she continued to change slowly. He watched as her arms gained a healthy and thick coat of fur, the waves of follicles flowing down her arms before it overtook her fingers, the claws changing like an AI warping video.<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t react at all, continuing to finish her transaction with her customer as he paid with his card, her paw pads gently tapping the digital register&#39;s screen. By this time, she was a whole she-wolf standing on two legs, wearing her uniform and even shoes.<br />
<br />
From his knowledge of furries, she didn&#39;t look to be overly animalistic since she didn&#39;t have digitigrade legs. She was still in her shoes, straight legged and quite humanoid.<br />
<br />
A tap on his shoulders snapped him out of his reverie, turning around to find Mark scowling at him. &quot;What are you looking at the bitch for?&quot; <br />
<br />
Mark Hanson, lanky 5&#39;1&quot;, 23 years old and a graduate of social sciences. Stuck working this fast food joint because he couldn&#39;t find a fitting job. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whuh? Lisa?&quot; Jacob stammered as he glanced over to Lisa again, the she-wolf&#39;s tail wagging slowly. The fox was now tailed by another waiting customer, literally, as the fox&#39;s tail had bothered someone else.<br />
<br />
Jacob’s eyes flicked to him — a broad, bald guy in a tight black shirt, built like a bouncer. He scowled down at the fox-like customer, arms crossed over his barrel chest.<br />
<br />
The clean-shaven head and the rough face on him belied the fact that his muscles were tight on his black tee, the cargo pants he wore stretched tight with thick legs. The fox&#39;s furry tail had mistakenly swiped his crotch, and the man clearly had called the fox since said vulpine turned to glance up at the taller male.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you&#39;ve been staring at her for like a minute like you&#39;ve seen a ghost.&quot; Mark followed up, watching the camera as well but from what Jacob could tell, he didn&#39;t find anything wrong.. &quot;You got the hots for that she-wolf, Jacob?&quot;<br />
<br />
Flabbergasted, Jacob could only sputter in shock. He watched the monitor again, this time noticing the brute of a male changing as the fox interacted with him. Without blinking or gazing away, he said to Mark. &quot;Dude, you don&#39;t find the fact that Lisa is a wolf furry weird?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s as weird as the fact that I&#39;m working a fast food joint despite having a degree.&quot; Mark crossed his arms, disgruntled with his reality. &quot;No, not at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob watched as the regular customer changed, his ears moving up into sharp points over his heads to what he immediately recognized as Doberman ears, clipped into shape despite the calls for it being inhumane. If it wasn&#39;t for the fact that he&#39;s changing, the clipped ears would fit the tough guy that was now sporting gold-tinted tattoos on his muscular arms. The black skin of the ears looked out of place over the clean-shaven head if not for the fact that the black fur was rapidly spreading over that expanse.<br />
<br />
Jacob didn&#39;t even blink this time. He just stared as the buff man&#39;s features shifted, his scowl twitching just slightly before his entire body seemed to ripple. His nose darkened, broadening into something more canine.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you see about Trevor?&quot; Jacob asked Mark, who was at his side, watching the screen with him. He could see Mark squinting at the screen, and for a second Jacob wanted to believe his co-worker could see it.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you&#39;re asking me, nothing much. Other than the fact that he constantly hits on Lisa.&quot; Mark said with barely any interest in watching what to him was normal.<br />
<br />
Jacob watched Trevor&#39;s head change into the head of a doberman, the thick neck of his rapidly changing as the change went under his tight compression tee. The black short fur traveled under the tattoos, still visible thanks to the thin fur normal to such dogs. <br />
<br />
The man&#39;s jaw widened, thickening, his lips blackening into something distinctly more muzzle-like. His already impressive muscles swelled, his shirt stretching to accommodate his new form. His fingers flexed, nails darkening into something just shy of claws. Soon, a large and in charge anthro doberman stood behind the fox, though this time, he was much closer to the smaller beast of prey.<br />
<br />
He was still him, still standing with the same posture, same crossed arms. But now, instead of a scowling man, there was a scowling doberman standing in his place.<br />
<br />
Unexpectedly, Trevor, who he knew was homophobic and straight, went with wide arms and hugged the fox from behind. He even set his head over the fox&#39;s, like some lost pup wanting attention. Trevor was straight-up gay now?<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn&#39;t you say Trevor hit on Lisa a lot?&quot; Jacob asked as Mark walked away upon seeing Trevor&#39;s casual display of affection. &quot;He&#39;s hugging that fox guy and looking like he&#39;s humping.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark shrugged, continuing with his work like it was the most normal thing in the world. &quot;He&#39;s bisexual. That guy&#39;s his boyfriend, man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob already figured out that direct interaction was the cause of transformation; that didn&#39;t need too much brain power to discover, after all. As he watched Trevor carry the fox towards the toilets, Jacob instinctively knew what they were up to. Even through the monitor, that dog was horny.<br />
<br />
He felt his stomach twist, the very idea of having to clean up whatever mess they were up to going through his mind. He did want to go and tell them not to fuck in the stalls, but if he did that he might change himself!<br />
<br />
What luck that it was his turn to do the stalls tonight...<br />
<br />
He glances around. The other employees move as usual, filling orders, chatting, unbothered. No one else seems to notice... except him. Whenever any of the anthros, Lisa included, chatted, the customers changed. As more customers went through Lisa&#39;s counter, more furries sat themselves in the joint.<br />
<br />
He watched as a lanky guy in a cat print black hoodie claim a seat for himself for his number to be called, but that was who he <i>was</i>. The guy had brought in a laptop with him, with a water bottle in his other hand. But instead of becoming a lanky antho, now a bona fide gymbro sat there. <br />
<br />
His posture changed. The slight hunch straightened as muscle stacked beneath his hoodie, his arms thickening, his chest broadening, his once-skinny legs filling out with powerful definition. The loose fit of his hoodie and jeans suddenly didn’t seem so loose anymore. The new snow leopard still wore the same clothes, doing the same work on his laptop without any breaks in his pace, but now he was curling an iron dumbbell that looked heavy in such a public space and was now jacked! It was outright changing people into who they weren&#39;t! <br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t occur to Jacob that Mark had become disgruntled seeing Jacob continue to stare at the monitor. He didn&#39;t notice Lisa turn around to briefly talk with said co-worker and then turn around before his brain caught up to the recent developments. There were a lot of beastfolk now in the fast food place, some changing species as a rather overweight woman eating a cheeseburger after interacting with a mink that had changed from interacting with her friend who had gone through Lisa&#39;s counter, changing into a big-bodied polar bear. <br />
<br />
Some of the women he could see changed in stature; some did not. He watched a customer transform, her breasts popping into D-cup size as she sat down, her cow cleavage taking up space that she had to push her tray further away from her body. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oi, Lisa said she&#39;d prefer if you do that stalking when in private.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob was confused, the deep baritone talking to him with such casual tone but completely unrecognizable to him that he looked over to who he thought was Mark.<br />
<br />
What he saw caused his heart to skip a beat, as the now a whole 2-feet-taller minotaur waited for his reply. Jacob could only balk in shock as he scanned the guy, still wearing Mark&#39;s uniform that he could recognize, but fitted entirely for the new stud he had become!<br />
<br />
&quot;Mark?&quot; Jacob asked, unable to believe what just happened. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah bro?&quot; Mark had turned to his station, preparing meat patties for the customers to eat but glanced over briefly when his name was called. The fact that Mark had replied confirmed his identity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... you&#39;re a bull guy?&quot; Jacob continued to talk, feeling like he had forgotten a very specific rule he just figured out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Weird, I know, a bull working in a fast food joint. Whatever makes money, though.&quot; He turned back to his work as he grilled the patties he unpacked.<br />
<br />
With a jolt, Jacob realized his mistake. There was a tingling in his body, and as he looked at his arms it was changing shape. He was transforming..</p>
<hr/><h3>
The question is, what is he transforming into?</h3>
