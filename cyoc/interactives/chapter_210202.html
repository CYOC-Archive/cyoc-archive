<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When it was time for their lunch break, Mark and Luke collected Aidan at his class. Mark was also looking how Ben had done, seeing him still beet red and crying in his seat. After the trio was outside, with Mark supporting him to walk, they quickly got to the picnic table they had sat in the day before, eating in silence. Luke had made a wonderful lunch for Mark and himself, and Aidan enjoyed his liquified meal as well.<br />
Only after finishing it, Mark asked: “Hey Aidan, how is your classmate Ben doing? When I saw him, he looked not so good?” As Aidan wouldn´t know he had changed anything with Ben, he would see it as if Ben had been like that all the time, therefore would have noticed a change in his behavior.<br />
Aidan looked at Mark as he answered: “I don´t know. Normally he has no problems in class, but today, he did nothing but sit there, bright red, and was crying the whole time. He never even pulled anything out of his bag to work with.”<br />
Mark was torn at that. Part of him was satisfied that Ben would experience what he did for being mean to Aidan, but the bigger part of him was already pitying him. To anyone but Ben and himself, he had always been like this, and no one would bat an eye at him. Ben himself was now completely helpless, at least as long as he had no idea how to work his trapped body. Maybe he was too harsh to the young man and should reconsider his punishment.<br />
And Mark could guess the same was true for the three bullies at his brother´s school. He had acted in his anger, not in a fun way like with the others. The only thing different between the three and the others was that they had deserved a punishment, while his brother, his friends and Aidan all had just been changed for his own fun. Luke had been another case, as part of it was punishment, and another that he had chosen himself what he would be in form.<br />
To Aidan, who looked at him in slight confusion, and Luke, who had a somewhat knowing look in his eyes, he answered: “That´s bad, maybe he really is sick today? Maybe I will talk to him, invite him to come home with us to find out. By the way, Aidan, would you be okay with coming home with us later? I want to show you something.” He would make the changes to Aidan´s living when they were home, not now.<br />
Aidan looked somewhat surprised by that. “Okay, if you want me to come visit you, I have nothing else to do beside whatever homework I get later. And it´s more work for you, at least as long as you help me move around, right?”<br />
Mark grinned in answer. “That will not be a problem, don´t worry. But if I invite Ben too, I guess Luke will help you today, as I help Ben. Only if he accepts, that is.”<br />
After a quick dessert for Aidan, meaning being sucked of by him, the trio returned back to their classes for the day. As Mark helped Aidan back to his class, he saw that Ben still was bright red and crying, but gave a pleading look towards Mark as he saw him.<br />
Seeing that, Mark walked over to Ben, who showed a little hope of being freed now. “How is you day so far, Ben? Enjoying yourself?”<br />
“How could I enjoy anything, trapped like this? Please, I learned my lesson, I will never bully Aidan or anyone else again. I can´t take this anymore. What have you done with my body after you left? I can´t stop pissing myself.” Ben said, begging Mark to end this misery.<br />
Mark smiled a bit. “I won´t change you back right now, Ben. But I invite you over to my place after classes, and then we will see how to change your punishment. I guess I have been too angry with you, maybe we can find something better. And for your question, I just decided that, as I made sure your underwear is absorbent as a diaper, that you won´t need any control down there, so I made you incontinent. Nothing big.”<br />
Ben looked at him in horror for that last part. “Incontinent? Like a baby with no control what´s over? No, please, Mark, take that back.” He now pleaded some more. It dawned to him that was another thing Aidan had to deal with.<br />
“No, as I said, you will stay as you are, at least until the day is over, Ben. Now, want to come over to my place or not?” Mark said to that, seeing the mental pain Ben went through right now.<br />
Ben sobbed a bit more, but accepted Mark wouldn´t relent now. “What other choice do I have? I guess it´s either going with you, or stay as I am for even longer.”<br />
Mark smirked at that. “Yeah, that could be the consequence. But at least I will help you get to my place. Slithering like you do, it would take hours, at least while you are as inexperienced doing so as you are. I will get you and Aidan later, then. See you.” He waved as he left, seeing that Ben would have no choice but to accept being trapped for the rest of the day.<br />
As Mark sat down in his seat next to Luke, he was promptly asked: “So Ben is just another victim of your bad humor?” Luke sounded annoyed. Mark was harming others for his own fun, not seeing the harm he did to them as such.<br />
Mark sighed. “No, Ben is another case. When I escorted Aidan to his class this morning, he was bullying Aidan for not walking like a man. I did this as a punishment, and he is aware of that. But I plan to change his punishment later, as I wasn´t thinking as clear as I liked to do. Now, take notes for us, please.”<br />
Luke had a little bit of understanding for what Mark did now, but didn´t like it any better than before. But he was forced to do as Mark told him, so he focused on the arriving professor, quickly sinking into his task of taking detailed noted.<br />
<br />
At the end of their classes, Mark and Luke went over to the rooms where Aidan and Ben had theirs. Luke would help Aidan walk, while Mark somewhat carried Ben behind them. He had made sure Ben wouldn´t weight much to others, so whoever helped him wouldn´t break anything under him.<br />
Ben was relieved to not be forced to slither home, as Mark had been right, it would take hours right now. He wasn´t that comfortable being carried the way Mark did it, feeling like a sack of potatoes over his shoulder, but he wouldn´t complain. Not that Mark decided to drop him off somewhere and leave him alone.<br />
Reaching the house, they saw Chris and the other four were watching something on the tv, and Mark asked Aidan to wait for him downstairs, as he went up with Ben first. He could have done them together, but this way Aidan wouldn´t know what happened to Ben, and wouldn´t ask questions about Mark´s suggestions for Ben. Luke went to make something to eat for all of them, and left the others alone.<br />
Mark closed his door behind him, setting Ben onto his bed before opening his laptop to use it for changes he would make. Then he turned towards Ben again, already having a few ideas what he could do with him.<br />
Ben sat there, looking pleadingly at Mark, hoping he would be shown mercy now. He was sure he had learned his lesson, but couldn´t be sure if Mark saw it the same way.<br />
“I guess you have learned something from this, but as I said before, I will only change your punishment somewhat, not let you go free of it for now. I have a few suggestions, and will let you chose for yourself which one you would be more okay with.” Mark explained, a small grin building up at Ben´s dropping face.<br />
Ben felt crushed that Mark wouldn´t end his punishment now, but he was sure if he himself could chose, whatever was the next would be better than this. “Okay, if you must keep me punished, then say what you think as an alternative. I´m sure anything would be better than being some big worm.”<br />
Mark´s grin widened. “We will see. As I made sure nobody knew you had changed, when I asked Aidan, he said you normally are good in class, even while a worm at that point. He said you were just crying today, not knowing that your situation only started today. So, my first suggestion is to let you stay as you are now, a big worm, but give you the knowledge how to work with it, so while your life will be harder than before today, you could life. I guess your punishment would be over after a week either way.”<br />
As Mark paused, Ben thought only shortly about it, but then dismissed the idea. “While it would be easier to work my body, I just hate being like this, so no to that.”<br />
Mark nodded. He would see what option Ben would take in the end. “Okay, the second suggestion would be that, as this is a punishment for how you have treated Aidan, I make you similar to him. Meaning, while you aren´t a worm anymore, you would get his treatment of diapers and crawling, making you another big baby. Would that be better than being a worm?”<br />
Ben´s eyes widened for that. “Please no, I´m sorry for how I treated Aidan, but no, I don´t want to be a baby like him. It would be better, yes, but also quite embarrassing for me.”<br />
The grin on Mark´s face widened. “So, your only problem with it would be the embarrassment? You know, I could easily take that from you, and maybe you would enjoy yourself a bit. But okay. As a third option, how about I release you from your normal life for the week, by making you more like a pet snake or something like that? You see, no classes, no responsibilities, nothing but staying home, sleep all day and eat from time to time. What about that?”<br />
A shudder went through Ben. “I´m not anyone´s pet, then being like this is better. At least I have the option to refuse something. As a pet, I would be forced to obey you in a way, I guess? No, thank you.”<br />
“I didn´t say you would be forced to obey me. As far as I know, a pet snake isn´t trained like a dog to do anyone´s biding. Maybe for some snake charmer, but as I´m not like that, you would have nothing to fear like that. Do you have an idea for a punishment for yourself, that you would think is better?” Mark asked, wanting to see what idea Ben would have himself.<br />
Ben thought a bit about it. “How about some snake like creature that at least can use his arms? Like a naga in fantasy games? I would still be slithering around, but at least not be completely helpless? I mean, Aidan isn´t completely helpless, isn´t he?”<br />
“Would that still be a punishment, then? Or just a wish fulfillment based on your current situation? And Aidan is mostly helpless. Okay, he can use his hands, but they are still a bit restricted. Let´s make a deal. You can be either of the mentioned suggestions of mine for the week you are punished, and afterwards, if you want it then, I can make you something you want to be. What do you say to that?” Mark suggested. He already planned on something if Ben didn´t want to, but let´s see first if he takes that option.<br />
Ben thought about it. “So, you will make me whatever I wish for, if I take one of your three suggestions as my punishment for the week? What if I decline that?”<br />
Mark grinned evilly. “Then, I could just choose for you, or just let you stay as you are. Even take away the knowledge that I´m responsible, so you have no one you could blame for it.”<br />
Ben´s eyes widened in fear. That would be horrible. “Please, no. That would be terrible. Let me think about the options, and I will tell you what I take, okay?”<br />
Mark nodded at him, an turned to his laptop, giving Ben some time to think about it.</p>
