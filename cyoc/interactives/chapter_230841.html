<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen thought for a moment, she wanted Kyle gone, he and his creepy little friends always stared at her during lunch, she knew they wanted her and she didn&#39;t like that. Kyle for his part waited, hoping that she would go easy on him, meanwhile Jen remembered something that a friend had sent her. They had been talking about something in a private chat when her friend abruptly sent her a weird picture. It was a photoshop picture of a woman with two bodies, both connected to her neck, “reverse conjoinment 1” was the title. Her friend sent it with the message “Men really can get off to the weirdest shit.” <br />
<br />
This thought pushed itself into her head and she hatched an idea.<br />
<br />
“Hey Kyle?”<br />
<br />
“Y...yeah?”<br />
<br />
“Did you know that our moms work in the same office?”<br />
<br />
“No.... wait... Don&#39;t do anything to my mom!”<br />
<br />
“Oh, about that. She got the promotion that my mom was trying to get, what makes her so much better than my mom. Now that&#39;s a problem, and I know you have weird fetishes, like conjointment.”<br />
<br />
What was she planning, Kyle thought to himself nervously, where was she going with this?<br />
<br />
“So, I&#39;m going to get rid of you and punish you both at the same time. For your transformation, your going to be conjoined to your mom, at the neck.” Kyle was about to yell at her, she continued. “Where ever your mom is right now, you&#39;ll go to her, when you see her, her head will disappear, and her body will join yours at the base of your neck. If your the same height as her, she&#39;ll get bigger, enough to be able to carry you around and cradle you in her lap. Her body will stop aging, until your her age, and will be as healthy as you are now. Her body will continue it&#39;s daily activities, working at the office, shopping, washing and so on, she&#39;ll take care of your body as if it was part of her already as well, everything will be taken care of by her, everything.” This last word was said lustily. “Everyone around you will treat this as normal, even forgetting you as Kyle, calling you by her name, and if they talk to you, you&#39;ll speak as if you were your mother, down to the way she talks, acting as if you were her. If she talks to you, herself that is, no one will notice her talking directly to you even in public, in private if you talk to yourself you&#39;ll speak like her, even though your the one talking. If you try and use the curse, if you can make it happen, she&#39;ll slap her hand over your mouth until you stop trying, she will decide when to use the curse, on who and how. You&#39;ll be somewhat okay with this, treating it as more of an inconvenience in public. You can panic, scream and do whatever you want in private.”<br />
<br />
Kyle was silent, this was a nightmare, why was she doing this? “For your dare, you and your kinda sorta mom but self, will never use the curse to change your new selves, and will never bother me or my family with the curse again. I hope you like your mom, you&#39;ll be a part of her soon enough.” Jen hung up the phone and Kyle dropped his and started walking under the control of the curse. He tried to stop himself as he walked, grabbing door frames, a table and the wall as his legs marched him to the kitchen. His mother was on her way out the door when she froze and turned around, her head disappearing as she did. <br />
<br />
Sheila Perkins was 42 years old, a little taller than Kyle, 5&#39;6” to his 5&#39;2”, she had wide, childbearing hips, but a modest c cup bust. Kyle watched in panicked silence as her body started to grow larger, she got a little wider, but a lot taller, her clothes growing with her. She was clad in a business dress, a knee length blue skirt, a blue blazer, white blouse and a pair of black 3” heels. Her body continued to grow larger, seeming to gain a little muscle and definition. Finally stopping at a solid 7 feet tall, it walked over to Kyle, embraced him in a final separate hug, then walked behind him, picked him up in a bear hug, and pressed her neck behind his head. <br />
<br />
He felt a shock, and then the entirety of of the amazon that now possessed him became apparent, Kyle wanted to scream, that&#39;s what he wanted to do, but he felt suppressed, a dull panic was all he could muster. His male neck didn&#39;t feel much pain from dangling there, maybe the curse had made his neck muscles better. He tested out his body and found it woefully useless, at the absolute mercy of the body that was his mother. <br />
<br />
“Oh biscuits.” Kyle said in an even mix of his and his mother&#39;s voices. “Now look at what you did Shhh... Shhhee...” Kyle couldn&#39;t get his name out. “Shhheilaaaa. That&#39;s not my name, my name is Shhhh... Shhhheeeeilaaaa. Sheila. Sheila Perkins!” Kyle teared up, first his mother, then his name, but she was still here, just not here. “I&#39;m Sheila Perkins, let&#39;s get this straight little man.” Her hand grabbed his crotch. “I brought this into this world, and even if we are one, you are now me, and we are Sheila Perkins.” It wasn&#39;t that Kyle was under any control, it was all him except what her body was doing to his. “And now that you fudged up with the curse, I have to make this work. Now let&#39;s go.” She walked over to the door, grabbing her purse as Kyle squirmed his body around. “And stop squirming,” She lightly punched him. “You&#39;ll make me fall, and I&#39;m not breaking my heels because my new accessory wants to fight against a curse he fudged up.” <br />
<br />
The minute that her first foot stepped out the door he was forced to stop squirming, becoming more placid. “That&#39;s better,” She hugged her new addition, “Just because you don&#39;t like it, it doesn&#39;t mean I can stay home, I need to pay bills after all.” His mothers body walked them down the stairs of the apartment building, down to the parking lot and sat them down in the car seat, swinging her legs under the steering wheel she encountered a new problem. <br />
<br />
“Cheese and crackers, what am I going to do with you...” She slid the seat back and her still somewhat cramped massive form now sat his body in her lap, pulling the seat belt across them, she started the car. “Let&#39;s see if I can still drive with your stupid body sitting in my lap. At least I make this look good.” Kyle felt insulted. “Oh, did I hurt your feelings? I messed around with the curse and now I have my body attached to my mother&#39;s, and I talk like I&#39;m her but I&#39;m me! I&#39;m...” He tried to say his name again, “Sheila.” He looked at himself in the mirror and his mother&#39;s had touched his face. “At least I make can work with this. Too late for make up today, I go all natural.” Her body turned on the car and pulled out of the parking spot, starting the drive to work.</p>
