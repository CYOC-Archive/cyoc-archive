<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Merlin checked his watch, “I should really be checking up on that frat party of yours.” There was no telling what trouble a bunch of oblivious college kids could get up to with his magic. “One of you get over here please.”<br />
<br />
He looked out over his workshop. Mark and Gabe had been fully restored to their human forms, and were currently rummaging around for clothes in his lost and found. That just left two satyrs to go. Travis looked like your classic satyr. Goat fur from the waist down, a bit of scruff on his chest, horns coming out of his head, and a permanent look of mischievousness behind his eyes. Peter on the other hand had clearly embraced the form in other ways. His goat fur didn’t taper off at his legs, and continued to slide up past his hips. He had had the tuff of fur on his chest, as well as notable bits of fur on his forearm and elbows. Even his hands had noticeable little hoof caps on the end of each finger. The most striking change however was his face. Peter’s eyes had shifted into a pair of yellow goat eyes, complete with square pupils. His face had pushed out into a blunt muzzle, and his sideburns were indistinguishable from the fur that littered the rest of his body. His face was framed by two large goat horns and a pair of scruffy goat ears. One got the distinct impression that they were dealing with someone who was more goat than man.<br />
<br />
The two goatmen exchanged looks. They had some idea what to expect now. Merlin would use his magic to shift their goat legs into goat pants. It was a neat sleight of hand, and seemed pretty straightforward.<br />
<br />
“Baah, I guess I’ll go first?” Travis clopped forward. “Peter will probably take a while.” He chuckled. He gave his body one last examination with his hands. It was still hard to believe this was him. He ran his fingers over his hips, watching the fur taper off by his belly button. There was no seam, no trace of his former humanity. Just an all natural good old fashioned satyr. He reflexively slid his hands down a bit further, and then he stopped walking.<br />
<br />
“Actually… You go next Pete.” Travis started blatantly rubbing his sheath. Baah! He… he was going to miss this. Not just the big goat cock, but the freedom that came with it. He loved how impulsive he felt as a satyr. They just did whatever they wanted to do, and right now he certainly knew what he wanted to do. “I’m gonna get this bad boy off one more time before giving it up.” He cupped his hand around his his sheath for emphasis. “You two have fun.”<br />
<br />
“Baah?” Peter bleated curiously.<br />
<br />
“Yes I’m sure!” Travis grinned, clopping over toward’s Merlin’s desk. He plopped down in the wizard’s chair, wasting no time before he started to tease himself.<br />
<br />
“Please don’t-“ Merlin started to berate Travis, but saw it wouldn’t be much use, “Hmpf, satyrs.” He shook his head, pointing a finger at Travis, “Try not to make a mess on my desk.”<br />
<br />
Merlin walked back over to the large circular rune on the center of his workshop floor, “I suppose that just leaves us for now.” He gestured for the scruffy satyr to join him, “It looks like they did a number on you.”<br />
<br />
Peter walked over, nodding his head, “Baah, bah baah baah.”<br />
<br />
Mark laughed as he walked back over with a fresh set of borrowed clothes. Thankfully there were about two dozen t-shirts with the university’s logo on it, and Merlin had a big bin of flip-flops. This probably wasn’t the first time someone borrowed clothes from him.<br />
<br />
“He’s been talking like that ever since we had a threesome,” Mark explained.<br />
<br />
“Baah bah.” Peter waved at the human. He looked a little nervous. Skittish maybe? It was harder to read goat expressions.<br />
<br />
Merlin nodded, “He was just explaining that.”<br />
<br />
“Uh huh…” Mark gave the shopkeeper and unconvinced look.<br />
<br />
“What?” The Wizard grinned, “I speak goat.”<br />
<br />
Travis squirmed on the wizard’s chair, “Baah, I can get the gist of what he’s saying.” He had managed to fully coax out his shaft at this point, “I just couldn’t tell you what the individual words mean.”<br />
<br />
Mark’s eyes went a little wide, “Woah, keep that thing away from me.” He stepped out of Travis’ err, splash zone. “It all just sounds like bleats to me,” he said, watching Merlin and Peter from a safe distance.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, we’ll have him back to normal and speaking English in no time.” Merlin gestured at his rune, “Step into the circle please.”<br />
<br />
Peter bleated hesitantly. “Baah bah?”<br />
<br />
Merlin nodded his head, smiled reassuringly, “It’s not going to hurt. I promise.”<br />
<br />
Peter clopped onto it reluctantly, “Baah.” He rubbed the back of his head, “Baah baah.”<br />
<br />
Merlin gave the satyr a curious look, “Really?”<br />
<br />
Peter nodded again, “Baah baah bah.” His cheeks went red as he quickly clopped off the rune again.<br />
<br />
Travis sat up, ignoring the trail of pre dripping down his shaft. “Are you sure? Look at us goaty.” He gesture down at himself for emphasis. His cock twitched, and he quickly went back to stroking when he realized he now had an audience.<br />
<br />
“Yeah… I don’t think this is going to work.” Merlin chuckled.<br />
<br />
Mark blinked, “What’s going on?”<br />
<br />
“Hang on,” Merlin carefully stepped around Travis and started digging through his desk. He pulled out a small circular loop of metal. It was too large to be an ear ring, but too small for a bracelet. He walked back over to Peter and Mark, holding out the large metal cuff. It had a completely smooth finish to it. “Alright, one second…” Merlin waved his hand over the cuff. His hand and the metal began to glow, and a set of runes started to carve themselves into the surface of the cuff. After just a moment, the glow died down.<br />
<br />
The wizard held the cuff up to the satyr, “You tell ‘em Peter.”<br />
<br />
Peter gave Merlin a confused look. “Baah?”<br />
<br />
The wizard shook his head, “Right, you guys don’t understand any of this.” He mimed placing the cuff on his head, “It’s alright. It’s just a translation spell.”<br />
<br />
“Baah?” Peter looked at the metal loop for a moment. He reluctantly took it from Merlin, then repeated the wizard’s gesture. Peter carefully lowered the cuff around his right horn. The cuff seemed to tighten a bit as it settled, and the fur on the back of his neck stood up for a moment.<br />
<br />
“Can you hear me now…?” He bleated tentatively. The words escaping from his lips were still completely bestial bleats.<br />
<br />
“Oh wow.” Mark stared. “Loud and clear.” He blinked, “I mean, they’re still just bleats, but I could understand exactly what-“<br />
<br />
“I want to stay like this…!” Peter cut Mark off. He clopped in place bashfully, “I mean- Do I have to change back Merlin?”<br />
<br />
The wizard laughed, “This spell relies on you convincing the magic your goaty bits aren’t real. If you want to stay like this, there’s not much I can do.”<br />
<br />
“Really?” His tail started to wag rapidly. “Thank you…!”<br />
<br />
“Are you sure you’re sure Peter? I know it’s pretty easy to get caught up in all the excitement.” Mark smiled sheepishly. Travis let out a lusty bleat of agreement. “But you’re uh- Pretty goaty?”<br />
<br />
“I know…!” His eyes lit up excitedly, “It’s perfect!” He ran his hands down his furry legs, then across his scruffy, partially-muzzled face.<br />
<br />
“…perfect?” Mark echoed.<br />
<br />
“I just…” Peter’s ears twitched shyly, “I don’t think I liked being a human very much.” He patted his thighs, “This feels right to me.”<br />
<br />
“If you’re sure?” Mark watched him curiously.<br />
<br />
Peter continued to explore the fur on his body, but wasn’t particularly focused no his sheath. His tail was wagging a mile a minute. “Yeah!” He blushed, “I can’t believe I can stay like this…!” Peter’s ears suddenly shot up, “But- Oh man, uh- I am kind of a big conspicuous goat monster. Will I have to start doing classes online? How am I going to get groceries…!”<br />
<br />
Merlin held up a hand, “Relax. You’re not a monster. You’re a satyr.” He smile, “There’s like fifty of you on campus. We’ll go get you enrolled in the magic department in the morning. They have beginner classes for this sort of thing.”<br />
<br />
“Really…?” A wave of relief washed over Peter. “I had no idea.”<br />
<br />
“We like to keep a low profile,” Merlin started to root around in his desk again. “In the mean time, I can always whip up an illusion spell for you.” He pulled out another blank horn cuff.<br />
<br />
“Baah…! Better…! Make that… Two!” Travis moaned. His cock was leaking a steady stream of pre, and he looked like he was moments from climaxing.<br />
<br />
“Fuck…!” Merlin bolted away from his desk in a way that probably wasn’t very becoming of a wizard.<br />
<br />
“Baah, baah, baaaaaaaah!” Travis let out a string of lusty bleats, finally pushing himself over the edge. He was a randy satyr, but he knew how to listen. All of his seed landed on his face and chest, and the wizard’s desk was spotless. His chair on the other hand might need a thorough hosing down…<br />
<br />
Gabe watched the scene unfold as he walked back over from the lost and found, “I warned you Mr. Wizard.” He laughed, pointing at the flustered Merlin, “You got lucky.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah yeah.” Merlin dusted himself off.<br />
<br />
“Baah… Towel please?” Travis smiled from underneath his sticky mess.<br />
<br />
Merlin rolled his eyes, waving a glowing hand as dismissively as possible. In an instant, the satyr’s mess vanished and the chair was spotless. Travis’ fur even looked like some tangles has been brushed out.<br />
<br />
“Wow, you need to teach me that!” Travis got up to his hooves, “If we’re staying satyrs I mean.” He gestured over at Peter.<br />
<br />
“Now hold on.” Merlin held up his hands, “Him I trust.” He pointed at Peter, “You?” He pointed back to Travis, “Leaving you in goat legs is just asking for trouble. I’d be responsible for a couple of new satyrs popping up on campus every week.” Merlin gestured around at the group, “Just so we have an understanding, this is a one time thing. I’m going to use up most of my magic for the week cleaning up this little mess.”<br />
<br />
Travis stood up, his cock starting to slide back into its sheath, “Hey, that was a big mess.” He huffed, “And Peter and I do everything together. If he’s staying a satyr, so am I.”<br />
<br />
“Baah…! Uh- Are you sure Travis? You don’t have to do this.” Peter started to wag sheepishly.<br />
<br />
“I’m sure!” He grinned, “Come on, you’ve gotta have some outlet on campus.” He nudged Peter playfully.<br />
<br />
Peter’s eyes went wide, “Somehow I think I’m going to be your outlet.” He coughed into his hand, “So to speak.”<br />
<br />
Merlin watched skeptically. “I’m not sure my little circle here will be able to do its thing in a day or two if you change your mind.” He gestured down at it, “Why don’t you try renting some satyr pants for a while and then decide if you want to leap into this?”<br />
<br />
“Baah, guys, I’m sure!” He clopped over to the others, “Just think of it like I’m changing my major.” He laughed, sarcastically bleating, “Hi, I’m Travis, I’m on the cocksucking track with a minor in satyr studies.”<br />
<br />
Merlin crossed his arms, “O-kay. I’m totally not letting you leave like this.” He laughed, “Get on the circle.”<br />
<br />
“Baah? What?” Travis blinked, “I thought you said it only worked on willing people.”<br />
<br />
Merlin nodded, “So you were paying attention.” He chuckled, “Step onto it and convince me you’re a responsible satyr.”<br />
<br />
“Baah…?” Travis tilted his head, hesitantly clopping onto the rune, “Really?”<br />
<br />
“You said you wanted to be a satyr.” Merlin nodded, raising a glowing hand and placing it on Travis’ chest, “Convince me you’re a responsible one.”</p>
