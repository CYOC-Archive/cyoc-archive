<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The seawater&#39;s effect on Erin was more that revitalizing, it was a positive nitro-boost to her already nymphomaniacal sex drive. A succubus has nothing on a siren in the sea, as John discovered (approximately half-a-dozen times in a row) while waiting with Erin on the beach. In the state she was in, John discovered to his amazement that he could get Erin off in any number of ways—coitus and cunnilingus of course, but also playing with her boobs was sufficient after a while, and even the gills on her neck and sides and the lateral lines that ran down either side of her fishtail were so sensitive that kissing and teasing those brought her to orgasm number four.<br />
<br />
John was downright exhausted and barely able to think, when he was saved by the appearance of the nautilus: an aptly named vehicle, not for any reference to Jules Verne novels, but because it really was shaped like a huge nautilus shell, albeit with forward-facing headlights and a viewport, two rows of portholes each running down the port and starboard sides of the craft, and some sort of glowing pink crystal embedded in the tail end that served as propulsion. <br />
<br />
The vehicle rose up out of the water some distance out, not coming anywhere near the sandbars or shallows where John and Erin had been cavorting for much of the last few hours. As soon as it did, Erin spotted it, pointed, and told John to hang on tight—she would swim them both out. John was getting a little nervous now, but he did as Erin asked and held her from behind while she used her powerful fishtail to propel them both out to the nautilus. <br />
<br />
A hatchway opened up near the top of the craft, just above the bridge, and the green-haired head of a cute mermaid popped out. &quot;Erin? You called for a ride?&quot; The mermaid&#39;s head was shortly followed by two bare, green-nippled breasts that casually came to rest on the edge of the hatchway.<br />
<br />
Erin motioned for John to go ahead of her and climb up onto the ship. &quot;Maeve! It&#39;s so good to see you—it&#39;s been too long!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah it has,&quot; said the other mermaid, eyeing John. &quot;Who&#39;s this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is John Robertson. He&#39;s… well, he&#39;s my mate. He&#39;ll be coming with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to meet you,&quot; said John, offering his hand to shake. (He tried not to stare at the mermaid&#39;s chest. Even after all the time he spent with Erin, there was something inescapably prurient about seeing a topless mermaid that zapped his male brain with lustful thoughts.)<br />
<br />
&quot;Air-breather, hm?&quot; said Maeve. &quot;Wait a sec.&quot; She didn&#39;t shake his hand; she merely ducked back down into the ship, and she didn&#39;t close the hatchway behind her. Through the opening, John could see that the ship was flooded up to the level of the ocean-surface with sea-water. Presumably, once the vehicle dove underwater again, it would flood completely.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think she&#39;s going to get you a <i>cohuleen druith</i>,&quot; said Erin. &quot;Every one of our nautilus ships is equipped with a few, just in case we need to rescue an air-breather, or take one along for the ride.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve heard that phrase before,&quot; said John. And he had; shortly after meeting Erin, when he&#39;d gone on his internet bender, researching mermaid folklore. &quot;Is that the magic item that&#39;ll help me breathe under water?&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin nodded, and half a moment later Maeve appeared again with a necklace in hand: a blood-red stone, about the size and shape of a grape, set on a gold chain. &quot;Here you go,&quot; she said, passing the necklace to John. &quot;Make sure you never take this off while we&#39;re down below, or you&#39;ll be crushed so fast you won&#39;t have time to drown.&quot;<br />
<br />
As far as John knew, a <i>cohuleen druith</i> was supposed to be some kind of red hat or golden cap, so he was a little surprised to see the necklace; but he was also grateful. A cap would be trickier to keep on his head at all times. Not wanting to seem ignorant, he said nothing of this, thanked Maeve for the necklace, and put it on. (The moment he did so, the stone began to glow softly.) Then he helped Erin to clamber up onto the strange u-boat, holding her hands while she flicked her fins until her fishy butt was sitting next to John&#39;s. After that, between Maeve and John, they were able to help Erin climb over the side of the hatchway and spill herself into the water waiting below. Then John followed, and he plunged into the cold seawater inside—<br />
<br />
And he could breathe. He could see, despite the low light. He felt the effects of neither cold nor pressure. And he could even hear and speak normally. <br />
<br />
Maeve finished closing up the hatch and then embraced Erin, and soon the two mermaids were chatting like old friends. Erin was asking after—friends? family members?—and Maeve had more than a few questions about John and about life on land &quot;among the dry-born.&quot;<br />
<br />
John looked around and saw that he was indeed on the bridge of craft: below the front viewport, there was a very complicated-looking dashboard, all glowing crystals and sci-fi-looking widgets, along with shell-shaped seats for a pilot and a co-pilot; and behind those, two more seats for passengers. A passageway led from the bridge back to the rear of the craft, where several cabins, holds, and presumably a galley and other chambers were located. <br />
<br />
John&#39;s gaze was drawn to the co-pilot&#39;s seat, which was occupied by a merman whose look was very different from those that John had seen in Muir Oigh&#39;s pub back on land. This merman had silver-blue tail-scales, ebony skin, and short-cropped hair that was also a shade of aqua blue. Just as Maeve wore no seashell bra, this merman wore no harness across his bare chest. He said nothing, but watched John with equal curiosity while the mermaids chatted and caught up.<br />
<br />
At last, Erin turned to John and said, &quot;John, I want you meet Maeve, my sister. And sitting over there in the co-pilot&#39;s chair is her friend, Oisin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Closer than friends, I should think,&quot; said Maeve. &quot;We&#39;re mates these days. You&#39;re not the only one who went and found herself a man, sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Congratulations to you both!&quot; said Erin. At Oisin, she asked, &quot;How long did it take her to finally work up the courage to make a move?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Too long,&quot; chuckled the merman, &quot;considering all the signals I&#39;m sure I was sending. But she finally got it into her mind to &#39;seduce&#39; me—on the trip here.&quot;<br />
<br />
John laughed aloud at that, and Erin giggled, while Maeve blushed until her cheeks were a coppery green. John decided to be polite and turn the conversation in another direction, so he asked, &quot;Do you pilot ships like this for a living, or is it just, like, your own—what was it called again, a nautilus?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s the family ship,&quot; said Maeve. &quot;Properly speaking, our mother owns it. &#39;Sin and I just got keelhauled into doing the driving.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She says that,&quot; said Oisin, who looked over his shoulder at John while still expertly fiddling with a few controls, &quot;but the truth is, Maeve was very excited to see her sister after so many years. As am I; it has been too long, Doctor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be so formal,&quot; Erin laughed. <br />
<br />
Oisin answered with a shit-eating grin. John was beginning to like this guy.<br />
<br />
&quot;All right, all right,&quot; said Maeve, who floated over to the pilot&#39;s seat and allowed her tail to drift down into it. &quot;We&#39;ll catch up properly once we&#39;re back out in open waters and can set the autopilot again. In the meantime, you two go get settled. Your cabin is the furthest back, starboard side. And don&#39;t worry—this old girl has very thick walls.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was all the incentive Erin needed to strip off her seashells, stow them in her small case, and take John by the hand. </p>
