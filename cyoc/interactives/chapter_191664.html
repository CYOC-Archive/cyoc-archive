<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It wouldn&#39;t take long for the vacationing jocks to put two and two together - and realize the connection between Muscle Tech-X and the sudden and yet very welcome muscular growth spurt that Vincent got. He was far from the biggest grower on this stuff, but he&#39;d gone from simply athletic to more or less an amateur teen bodybuilder. Even his tan looked a bit more impressive for it! Tony tilted his head a little bit as he evaluated all the gains Vincent got from one bottle. He&#39;d gone from 160 lbs to 210 in the blink of an eye - and now he looked like he was primed and ready to strut his stuff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, you have got to try this stuff,&quot; Vincent vouched for it as he adjusted his now much tighter shirt. Thank goodness he always bought really big shirts - fit to grow into. He just didn&#39;t really think that he was going to grow into them quite so quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, obviously this stuff was what&#39;s responsible for you pulling a hulk on me,&quot; Tony stated, though as he looked at Vincent he pondered at what the catch might be, &quot;...There&#39;s gotta be a catch though. Nobody gets anything so easily. Mom always told me folktales about that. We should be careful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh, don&#39;t be such a negative nancy,&quot; Vincent waved his hand and smirked, &quot;Why are you looking a gift horse in the mouth? Just imagine all the babes we could get with if we buffed up on this stuff.&quot; He estimated that his calves must&#39;ve put on some serious size as he adjusted his pants. Fuck they were like diamonds...kinda turned him on, suddenly fitting so snugly in his clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just...dude, you know what they say about steroids...&quot; Tony&#39;s resistance was however wavering despite what he was saying. He was already getting up and moving toward the vending machine even as he said all this. The idea of suddenly becoming buffer than ever was an exciting one. Coach was always ragging on Tony to put on more size here, put on more size there. He bet that this stuff would give him all the size Coach could ever ask for and then some.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude,&quot; Vincent gave a lewd smile and cupped his groin, &quot;I&#39;m feelin&#39; my balls right now. They do not feel any smaller. If anything they feel bigger. Give the stuff a try...in fact...&quot; He moved over and bought another two doses, surprising Tony who almost fell backward. He very narrowly almost dropped the dose when Vincent tossed him a container full of Muscle Tech-X. &quot;I&#39;m feeling like getting some more size.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren&#39;t you big enough!?&quot; Tony asked frantically, even as he stared at the container. Hearing it swish around, almost in tune with the heightening rhythm of his heart.<br />
<br />
&quot;Never any such thing~!&quot; And with that Vincent popped it open and started drinking it down in one overeager gulp, not wanting to waste any time with more dramatics. He knew what felt good, and what he liked, so he went right for it. Whether that was ultimately good for him or not...he didn&#39;t care at the moment. All he knew was how much bigger he wanted to be.<br />
<br />
As Tony watched, Vincent shook and pulsed, his whole body seeming to twitch and start quivering. &quot;Ohh baby, it&#39;s starting...oh fuck I&#39;m gonna cum in my pants!&quot; Tony winced and looked away, just in time to hear the sound of a zipper opening and Vincent turning away toward the side of the vending machine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh...UHHH! UHHHHH! UHHHHHHHHHH!!&quot; The grunts were getting deeper and more impressive. Tony gulped as he heard a few haphazard sprays of what he could guess was cum hitting the side of the building and the ground even as he watched Vincent&#39;s back bulking up a little bit more. If the first batch put size on him, this batch improved his tone even further. Etching utterly striated lats and an even nicer v-taper leading to an arrow pointing at his increasingly tight and pronounced ass. Though as Tony watched it seemed his ass got a little too big. &quot;OOH fuck! Fuck me! My <i>ass</i>!! So fucking tight!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ignoring the homoerotic undertones, Tony observed a pair of increasingly impressive arms raised up after zipping up Vincent&#39;s pants in a flex. Every part to the bicep toned up and became more impressive, fighting for room with a tricep that strained the underside of the shirt sleeve. Even Vincent&#39;s forearms looked thicker, stronger, and his hands looked more brutish, capable, and large.<br />
<br />
Vincent turned around and Tony almost could not believe his eyes. Vincent&#39;s face looked more handsome than usual - but in a remarkably odd, model like way. His lips were thicker, his tanned skin looked more sensuous and---and hairless! The stubble Vincent usually had was gone, lending him a new look. Even his hair looked thicker, wavier, and with a slight curl at the end.<br />
<br />
His pecs were even further toned up and impressive than they were from the first dose, though if Tony had anything to say about them, it seemed almost like Vincent overtrained them. His pecs were great - but they were so intensely developed, they jutted in a way that made them seem...too pronounced. Vincent lifted his shirt to show off - under those huge pecs, the abs that had just came in further developed - complimented by strong and well defined obliques. All leading to a slim line of hair, vanishingly slim, leading to a still quite thick, hard manhood, sticking out prominently at the front of his pants.<br />
<br />
Vincent&#39;s thighs and quads seemed to become another &quot;too big&quot; muscle - they looked almost too impressive by comparison to the rest of him. By the time Vincent was done changing he adjusted again and realized while his clothes fit, they were far, far too snug on him now. He definitely needed something new. &quot;Heh, I gave you quite a show eh Tony? What do you think of the new Vincent?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony evaluated - Vincent had probably put on another 15 or 20 lbs, not as huge a leap as the first, but the major gain this time was in tone and body structure. But Tony just could not get over some of the changes. Vincent was just different in a number of places. Too different. Something had to be going on...but even as the jock thought about this, he looked down at the can of MTX in his hand. Tony gulped, &quot;I...I uh, you look different Vincent...so fucking different. I-I wanna get different too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking down at the can of MTX in his hand, Tony contemplated the use of it - and hopefully, he believed he could try and keep himself to one use. After all, he didn&#39;t want to end up like Vincent...right? Even as some women walked down the beach and appreciated the show Vincent readily put on for them, Tony felt conflicted. Whatever was going on with Vincent, he wanted to know what it was before he went much further.<br />
<br />
But at the same time he didn&#39;t want to miss out. Fuck...fuck...!<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, as big as I am now, and I am pretty fucking big,&quot; Vincent said with a flex of his bicep, &quot;I am thinking that once you get that dose down, I might just go for another.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren&#39;t you good with this?&quot; Tony asked in a panicked whisper.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, I might be. But fuck that felt good, and fuck I like where I&#39;m at...at the same time, I mean, you ever see those huge mass monsters on the field? I need all the advantages I can get.&quot; Vincent shrugged, &quot;Tell ya what, you try it out. And I&#39;ll see what I feel like doing.&quot;</p>
