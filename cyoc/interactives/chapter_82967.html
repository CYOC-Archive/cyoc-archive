<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Agent Sherman held out her badge, yet again, wondering what had gone wrong in this country that she had to explain herself to some sort of <br />
naked dog woman. &quot;Diane Sherman, FBI. Are you in charge of security here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; said Katie. Not strictly true, but clearly this woman was not in the mood to hear her say she'd have to contact her supervisor.<br />
<br />
&quot;My partner and I are here to apprehend a possible serial killer, here under the alias Maxwell Harrison. By denying us entry, you are placing <br />
yourself in a position to face some very serious charges of your own, and every minute we stand here you're putting more of your attendees at <br />
risk. Now will you, or will you not, let us through?&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie stood there slack-jawed for a moment before responding. &quot;Of course!&quot; she turned to the receptionist, &quot;Pull up his records so they know <br />
what he looks like, then call technical and have them override the doors already! Excuse me, I need to tell the rest of the security staff what <br />
they're dealing with right away.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
The minotaur nodded before replying in the sort of well-practiced tone one would deliver a lecture. &quot;Obviously, I would need to see some proof <br />
of all this before taking any sort of action, but tell me, are you certain any of these allegations constitute enough of a problem that I should <br />
have to?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course they do!&quot; shouted Naomi, &quot;what sort of question is that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For the most part,&quot; he continued, &quot;none of what you have said strikes me as particularly out of line with the way the park has always operated. <br />
Take your companion here. Oh yes, I did my research after you first called. When first attending the park, I must assume she had absolutely no <br />
interest in women, nor in spending the rest of her life as one, before coming to the park. Nor, I suspect, had you any desire to gain a <br />
submissive aspect to your very nature when dealing with monkeys. There are far more extreme alterations to the structure of one's brain and <br />
various hormonal interactions that many park guests are forced to deal with without the benefit of any foreknowledge, particularly with that <br />
'random' button in play.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's completely different! You're comparing individual choice to some sort of sick social engineering! You can't just hand a government the <br />
power to round people up and alter them that fundamentally without their consent!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Quite true. That business about foreign powers is quite alarming, both as an ethical matter and, frankly, one of someone within the company <br />
distributing our patented technology on the black market. Still, you of all people are an odd one to be such an advocate of free choice. Do I not <br />
recall hearing a number of anecdotes from your term as head of security about your desire to force every male under your command to <br />
'upgrade' to femininity? Incidentally, from what I've read, you may actually have been onto something with that. Apparently the most promising <br />
new husky at the park, under some unusual circumstances, was changed from generally loathsome undesirable man to an exceptionally eager <br />
to please, loyal, and honest husky. Her performance reviews are all rather remarkable, and her attitude seems to have considerably improved as <br />
well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, Naomi thought, eliminating the defective Y chromosome was a project she could get behind, but this was bigger than that. &quot;I would never <br />
have seriously forced that on anyone and you know it. Besides which, we're not talking about some sort of alternate punishment for criminals <br />
here! We're talking about rounding up the homeless off the streets. People whose only crime is falling on bad luck.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would very much need to see evidence that suggests such people are being, as you say, 'rounded up' against their will. What I do know is that <br />
when this technology first needed testing, and there were a distressing number of unknown risks involved at the time I assure you, far more <br />
than any possible new variations in the works today, volunteers were substantially compensated financially for an extreme risk to their lives <br />
and very concept of self. Does that sound like an offer one would take were they not in the most desperate of financial situations to you? While <br />
I would love for this technology to be made available to everyone free of charge, we are far from a point where that is possible. These <br />
transformations are currently the domain of the wealthy, along with the astounding medical benefits they provide. If I were living on the streets, <br />
I'm certain I would jump at a chance to be a part of that, no matter what risk may be involved.&quot;<br />
<br />
Naomi was not at all happy with the direction this conversation was taking. &quot;And I suppose you have some positive spin on this business with <br />
the deer too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Frankly, I'm hard pressed to find the negative,&quot; the minotaur replied. &quot;As I understand that particular situation, of which I was indeed informed <br />
some time ago, a number of people, all of their own free will mind you, made a wager amongst themselves, and the only special request being <br />
made of the park was to wave a clause in the standard policy preventing guests from altering forms within a single visit. Frankly I'd been <br />
against that item from the start. And once again, you should be the last one to object to their terms. Have you had a recent change of heart on <br />
your particular brand of radical feminism, or is it some principle about officially sanctioning gambling within the park?&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Agent Johnson snapped as he watched the receptionist explain the situation over the phone to yet another obstinate park employee. &quot;This is <br />
just a huge waste of time. I'm going to do what we should have just done from the beginning,&quot; he said, marching towards the transformation <br />
chamber. &quot;Besides which, if humans are never allowed inside, he'd know we were after him from miles away. A little undercover work is clearly <br />
called for.&quot; He tossed his jacket and tie to the floor, and continued shedding articles with each step.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop it Johnson,&quot; Sherman urged while racing over just as he closed the door. &quot;This is no time to indulge whatever odd little fetish you might <br />
have. You are not going to embarrass the bureau by apprehending this suspect in the body of some sort of inhuman freak!&quot; She yanked on the <br />
door, but it had already locked. On her last nerve herself, she started throwing her weight into it.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, the override went through!&quot; The receptionist called over.<br />
<br />
Sherman staggered through the suddenly open door, stumbling into a rather embarrassed Johnson, just before the transformation he had <br />
hastily punched in began.</p>
